rugbyunion,3e1s1h,saviouroftheweak,20,Tue Jul 21 08:09:58 2015 UTC,"Nice work guys! It took a little while to properly take off but once you went into proper rugby talk it was great (Aus-SA, player welfare, ERC etc.).  I'd love to participate if you're not too scared of having a French view. If you guys can structure talking points a bit more (which I'm sure will come along) it'll be awesome! You can have different sections like Recent Games, Rugby Politics, Tactics, Upcoming Players etc."
rugbyunion,3e1s1h,fettsack,16,Tue Jul 21 11:32:02 2015 UTC,"I'd love to participate if you're not too scared of having a French view.   Think everyone would love a French person to speak. If not for the rugby, then at least for the accent. It's a fascinating league and French people add quite a different perspective in the English language dominated sport.  On a related topic of content: We've been discussing how it should be structured in general, we have some ideas in which direction this could go in, but I don't think we're fully decided yet.   I like the sound of having a diverse panel of 10 or so posters (NH, SH, UK/IE, FR, SANZAR, Emerging) who will register their interest to join, then take a number of them any given cast. 3 as a minimum and I'd say no more than 6, as it could get messy. Edit: That way if someone's unable to make it, someone on that list might be free to jump in. Anyone else have thoughts on this? Would you prefer it to be more or less regular/predictable as who would speak?  Then the other main question that you raised is: keep the style free flowing or have a loose agenda of points? A rough or loose agenda would give it structure and some time in advance for people to look up any relevant info/watch highlights. For example we didn't know in advance what we'd discuss and when it came to Sam Burgess I wasn't able to contribute as much as WJ or Saviour. Edit2: Would be important not to make this rigid or restrictive.  Split it into separate match analysis (Post match 30-60min) and general discussion podcasts (Leagues, RWC, developments, players), or mix them both into one (like the ""alpha"" podcast in this thread)?"
rugbyunion,3e1s1h,harblstuff,4,Tue Jul 21 12:09:45 2015 UTC,"keep the style free flowing or have a loose agenda of points?   I'd imagine it depends on how much of a show you want versus how much a podcast you'd prefer. I think something like Second Captains, which has topics/interviews etc with space in between for the bants is a nice structure to build off.   For example we didn't know in advance what we'd discuss and when it came to Sam Burgess   A bit of an agenda would pull the whole thing together I think, you don't want your new guest to be sitting quietly, unable to contribute, as everyone else waxes philosophical on the pro and cons of the Eastern European climate in forming Top 14 front row players. Or whatever.  On a side note I always imagined u/harblstuff was a 60 year old veteran, scarred by the decades of Irish losses, and with a voice like gargled gravel. Now I don't know what to think anymore..."

The only critique i would have is when /u/WallopyJoe  is speaking you can hear the match in the feedback making it hard to understand sometime (I have an Irish friend with a ridiculous accent so it wasn't that! haha) I have recently got back into rugby after a 5 year stint (dislocated elbow) and this is doing an awesome job of getting me up to speed :)  Looking forward to the next one!

I think there's at least one Bosnian player in the Top 14."
rugbyunion,3e2sv6,BZH_JJM,9,Tue Jul 21 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"Tim Visser's younger brother Sep is handy enough. He plays for the Netherlands. Also, if their countries had qualified, it's not unimaginable that Sevens players like Adérito Esteves (Portugal) and Collins Injera (Kenya) would make themselves available for selection. There is also big Stan Wright who is the current captain of the Cook Islands and who won two Heineken Cups with Leinster in 2009 and 2011.  *edit: Just remembered Vasily Artemyev who played u-19s for Ireland before being capped at senior level for his home country Russia. Played two seasons for Northampton Saints and scored 9 tries. Speaks with a hilarious Dublin 4 accent for a Russian."
rugbyunion,3e2sv6,wowjiffylube,3,Tue Jul 21 15:49:11 2015 UTC,"Dutch guy here, Sep Visser came to my mind as well.   The Dutch national team is currently in the ENC, in Division 1B (having been promoted after apparently winning the second division last season, woo!), but as far as I can tell Sep didn't play. Our current team, as listed, doesn't include Sep. I'm guessing he's focusing on his playing at Edinburgh, and will probably do what his brother did and stick around until he's potentially eligible for Scotland.   Regardless, I doubt we'll ever make it to the RWC, at least in my lifetime."
rugbyunion,3e2sv6,savois-faire,2,Tue Jul 21 16:07:44 2015 UTC,"Sep will never be eligible to play for Scotland, having already been capped for the Netherlands, however you're probably right that he's focused on nailing down a spot at Edinburgh."
rugbyunion,3e2sv6,wowjiffylube,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:44 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have a pro contract with Edinburgh any more, with it being a few years now since he did. He currently plays for Boroughmuir who are in the Scottish Premiership which could be described as a semi-pro competition at best.   I don't think he is one the best players missing the WC."

rugbyunion,3e2sv6,truffs1010,3,Tue Jul 21 18:11:15 2015 UTC,Julien Berger (Belgium and former La Rochelle stand-off) is probably a notable absentee.  Also a few of the Russian national team will be decent players as they are probably the only national team missing the WC with a fully pro domestic league at their disposal. Vasily Artemyev (former Northampton wing) will be probably their most notable player.
rugbyunion,3e2sv6,HMFCalltheway,2,Tue Jul 21 16:49:34 2015 UTC,Probably Stan Wright from the Cook Islands. Might be getting a bit long in the tooth now but he was a solid prop in his pomp.

rugbyunion,3e38x6,savois-faire,6,Tue Jul 21 17:29:13 2015 UTC,He did get banned for life. His name is Pieter van Zyl and the ref was David McHugh - that Wikipedia page has more info about the incident.

It was quite ridiculous, he wasn't even that good - in fact until Leinster's ridiculous injury streak this season, no one ever wanted to see his name on the bench, let alone starting.  He's alright now and has been here for a few years, even still."
rugbyunion,3e29it,harblstuff,2,Tue Jul 21 13:27:25 2015 UTC,"Played a few games for the Hurricanes and straight into the Irish squad, did he even get a game for Leinster first? I'd have been livid if I was a prop playing for one of the provinces and that happened"

We all have problems with the 3 year rule, but where do you lie on Bent's ties to Ireland?"
rugbyunion,3e29it,COfadaM,4,Tue Jul 21 14:55:40 2015 UTC,"I think the grandparent rule is even worse than the three year rule, honestly. At least residency-qualified people have actually lived in the country they represent."
rugbyunion,3e29it,faintsausage,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty much agree with faintsausage. At least 'project' players like Strauss, Payne and potentially stander have served some time playing in the provinces and proving themselves. The Bent situation I feel is one of the worst examples as he was brought straight into the Irish squad without playing at pro12 level. It was crap way of doing things and sent an appalling message to props busting a gut for the provinces to be given a chance."
rugbyunion,3e29it,KerryExile,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:17 2015 UTC,"But then you look at people like Kevin Kilbane, playing for the Irish soccer squad, who was/is devoted to team and jersey, but who has never lived or played in Ireland outside of internationals. Living in a country doesn't necessarily prove much in the way of loyalty or genuine feeling either.   without playing at pro12 level.   Do you mean that he never played provincially, or that he never played at that level of rugby? If he played for Ospreys, then came to Ireland would it be more acceptable? Many Irish internationals over the years have come from London Irish and the like."
rugbyunion,3e29it,COfadaM,11,Tue Jul 21 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"Good article. I can see both sides to the argument that if someone qualifies, and it's just playing by the rules, then it's fair enough. Scotland could potentially win more games and be a better team.  On the other hand, fuck that. It winds me the fuck up that we keep putting SH journeymen onto a plane to come and play for Scotland, instead of them playing club rugby down there. Dangling the carrot of international rugby, and capping players like them over seriously overlooked talent like Roddy Grant (as an example).  When I was wee, I wanted to play for Scotland. My dad and I went to every home game, and I got to see my team play against some of the best teams/players the world has ever seen. Then the next weekend, they were back at clubs and you'd bump into them at the clubhouse at Stirling County after your mini rugby games.   These days, I'm a little sad to say that I'm not as arsed about Scotland's results because it doesn't feel like it's really our national team anymore. Watching Glasgow this year has been awesome, having success with mostly Scottish players, but the Scotland setup is intent on finding folk from south of the equator because they must be better"
rugbyunion,3e29it,DuskytheHusky,8,Tue Jul 21 12:30:49 2015 UTC,Upvote for Roddy Grant.  It's ironic he was born in Botswana ha.
rugbyunion,3e29it,cocacolamakesmehyper,7,Tue Jul 21 14:23:01 2015 UTC,True...but he's ginger. I'll allow it
rugbyunion,3e29it,DuskytheHusky,3,Tue Jul 21 14:35:25 2015 UTC,"Mate, he's Scottish as fuck. No denying it.  He's also head and shoulders, in terms of heart, above many of the other flanker candidates we have, IMO."
rugbyunion,3e29it,cocacolamakesmehyper,2,Tue Jul 21 14:43:28 2015 UTC,It must feel pretty shitty if you are a born and bred Scotsman waiting for your first cap only for a low-profile foreigner to come in and take it. Or a Scottish fan who loyally supports grassroots Scottish rugby and then being told to support a guy who has never stepped foot in Scotland.
rugbyunion,3e29it,RedNave,5,Tue Jul 21 15:00:16 2015 UTC,"I point this out every international window, but the Scotland squad is more Scottish than people give it credit for.    Strauss and Nel bring it up to an almighty 3 players who qualified through residency, and the majority who qualified through grandparents are English but played for Scotland at lower age levels.  Due to internal migration between us and England, its heard to hold it against them."
rugbyunion,3e29it,RedNave,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"For the record I didn't post this to point the finger at Scotland, that was the author. I think most Unions are guilty of it to some extent. It does bring up a few interesting points about what should be acceptable in International rugby though. I'm not sure a guy who has never been to Scotland should be dropped straight into their RWC squad, likewise the line between temporary mercenary and genuine immigrant are blurry."
rugbyunion,3e29it,hutchero,4,Tue Jul 21 15:33:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to direct that to you, just putting it out there in general, as the media seem to paint Scotland as some kind of put together team of other nationalities with no Scots in it. (The Telegraph do love to slag us off at any chance)  It's an interesting point.  If someone qualifies for your national team and they have the quality to perform, giving you the best possible chance to win, should you as a team not take that player?   Kinda dammed if you do dammed if you don't scenario, you lose people complain that you didn't take the risk, you win people complain that their is a lack of 'Scottish-ness' and would rather lose that way than win.  As it is Hardie is just in the training squad, much like Hugh Blake was, in the end the whole discussion around Blake proved moot as he never got into the final squad, and is currently not on the books for either domestic team next season.  Brendan Laney, Glenn Metcalfe and Sean Lineen are famous examples of those who were parachuted in yet become accepted.  Heck you rarely/never hear people complain about the Kilted Kiwis who helped us win the 5 Nations, nor the ones that got us almost to a RWC final."

Absolutely agree and it should be down to the IRB to determine what is fair. Maybe at least a year for players qualifying on ancestry and 5 or 6 years on residency.   Hardie is a pretty good player but I'm not sure if he would really improve the Scotland squad. So either he doesn't get picked and it was a waste to bring him in over a Scottish player or he is included and doesn't make a difference so a young Scottish player missed out on an opportunity to go to a RWC."

rugbyunion,3e29it,HMFCalltheway,6,Tue Jul 21 15:06:47 2015 UTC,Cowan is qualified through his Scottish-born mother. Getting rid of the ancestry rule for parents would be a step too far I think.   Remember the likes of Tommy Seymour and Jim Hamilton qualify through their direct parentage.
rugbyunion,3e29it,DuskytheHusky,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah. In all honesty, I'm a bit touchy about the subject. I shoot for Scotland/GB, and the number of Surrey Highlanders in the Scotland team really grinds my gears. Guys who weren't good enough for their own country decide to compete for ours. Grrrr"
rugbyunion,3e29it,HMFCalltheway,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:42 2015 UTC,"Surprising that we need to bring in people for shooting with the number of shooting estates in the highlands, mind you the highlands are sparsely populated and filled with incomers from all over.

rugbyunion,3e29it,HMFCalltheway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:51 2015 UTC,Ok I know people that shoot clays (and game birds) mostly and I thought it was fairly popular here.  Not really involved in shooting myself apart from the odd clay shoot and occasionally using my air rifle at home so I'm not that clued up on it. How big is target shooting here as I've only ever came across it here by talking with a mate I know who was involved in his university shooting club?
rugbyunion,3e29it,HMFCalltheway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:47 2015 UTC,"It's bigger than you think, but it's not like it gets any publicity beyond Glasgow last year. University is a popular way to get people involved who wouldn't otherwise have had exposure to it, but it's still a pretty niche sport. Maybe one day when it's all televised and we are winning millions, we might get more people watching ;)"
rugbyunion,3e29it,faintsausage,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:22 2015 UTC,Ok thanks for the info. Good luck with the national team and I hope you beat out those Surrey Highlanders.
rugbyunion,3e29it,cubeyescube,7,Tue Jul 21 16:51:43 2015 UTC,I genuinely don't like the way the granny rule has been used here as even though Hardie is a good player he should not be parachuted straight in the Scotland training squad with out making the commitment to play over here before hand and show us what he can achieve here.  However the Daily Telegraph never ceases to annoy me whenever they report on Scottish or Celtic rugby in general. They hardly ever report on anything good in our game and if there is a problem in the game in general they seem to specifically target us for criticism. Even though this is a current story so it should be the main focus of the article they do not mention the examples of English granny qualified  players and arguably their exception for the Vunipola brothers    doesn't hold up well as it could be argued they could be representing Wales through their upbringing.  For all the good coverage the telegraph give rugby they really do annoy me with the purposefully controversial pieces and almost constant English bias.
rugbyunion,3e29it,RedNave,4,Tue Jul 21 14:22:52 2015 UTC,"The Vunipolas have been in England way too long to make that argument, as has our one and only granny player (Barritt). They would all have qualified by now even under the harshest residency rules that anyone has suggested.   I'm all for balanced reporting but the fact is that the current English setup is among the least offenders on this front, certainly when compared to the other home nations."
rugbyunion,3e29it,HymenHoarder,3,Tue Jul 21 16:15:44 2015 UTC,Taqele Naiyaravoro?
rugbyunion,3e29it,HMFCalltheway,4,Tue Jul 21 14:16:31 2015 UTC,"This is my take on it.  Toonie is a student of the game and a massive fan of Super Rugby and Fijian Rugby.  He spends time during our off season down with Super Rugby teams, having spent time with the Waratahs and Crusaders last off-seaon.  I imagine when down there he noticed Naiyaravoro and wanted to sign him for Glasgow, as we badly need non-Scots qualified players as almost all our Backs go onto Scotland duty leaving us very bare bones.    Tonnie probably went to the SRU to sign him, when SRU probably then figured they could try and poach him for Scotland via the residency route."
rugbyunion,3e29it,HMFCalltheway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:01 2015 UTC,I wonder what kind of relationship he has with those clubs. Is he friendly with the coaching staff? Our season ends when theirs is coming to a close so maybe he just goes down to watch the finals and do some scouting?
rugbyunion,3e29it,the_oncoming_storm,2,Tue Jul 21 16:09:38 2015 UTC,Are you referring to Oz poaching him from Fiji or Scotland signing him with the possibility of poaching him before Oz does it?
rugbyunion,3e29it,cjgroveus,4,Tue Jul 21 15:58:53 2015 UTC,At least our Union team isn't as bad as our league team where it is a token Scot at best amongst a team of Scottish ancestry players.  I'm only mentioning this as many other Scots on here probably don't know that Benji Marshall was surprisingly linked with playing for us in League recently. However this was reported by a few Aussie tabloids that thought he would switch allegiances because of a Scottish great-grandmother. Benji it turns out was not best pleased about this and would not have been allowed to switch anyway.
rugbyunion,3e29it,RedNave,5,Tue Jul 21 16:09:21 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I'm more comfortable with the residency rule than the ancestry rule. Increasing the length of residency before qualification seems an obvious ploy. 5/6 years would seem to be a reasonable extension.  That said, I've also no problems admitting that I'm looking forward to seeing Strauss, Nel, (and hopefully du Preez next year) playing for Scotland.  It doesn't wind me up as much as it does others."

I'd be pretty surprised if Bath doesn't have another brilliant season next time around."

And I hope so, think we've got enough firepower and squad depth to be there or there abouts for the end of the season. 10 is our main issue though, Devoto hasn't looked up to the task when we've played him at fly half."
rugbyunion,3e2yli,trc007,2,Tue Jul 21 16:26:56 2015 UTC,"But you would hope that would be sorted by the arrival of Priestland. My concern is that he won't play much at all and if called upon due to Ford being with England etc he would be rusty as hell.   Ignoring everyone being away for world cup the only positions I think that need strengthening are a top class second row to partner Attwood, a scrum half as I'm still a little unconvinced by Cook at times although perhaps Matawalu will provide a good option to job share with him and perhaps a top class winger to finish off our backline. Everywhere else I'm pretty content to let them continue to develop and grow together because of course it is still a very young team even down to Thomas and Auterac in the front row so there should be plenty more to come from them.   All in all exciting times ahead I think - let's just hope they can continue to play exciting heads up rugby but with a bit of the nous that sarries showed in the final."
rugbyunion,3e2yli,wrecker59,2,Tue Jul 21 17:24:52 2015 UTC,"The flyhalf comment was for the world cup period - maybe shoud have made that clearer. And agree with you on 2nd row + scrum half being the weaker areas, hopefully Evans and Matawalu can settle in alright and produce the goods."

Length is half the field and set markers/cones 3-5 metres apart for width.  2) Split into 2 teams. Using the narrow field, one team attacks the other defends.  Rules  a) Score a try using only, ruck/mauls, pick/drive and one out passes.   b) Not allowed to:- Pass more then once in a phase or long cutout passes. No kicking.  c) Coach decides what amount of effort he wants. Say 50 percent to 90 percent intensity.  I found, just by doing this simple drill regularly, the confidence in our defense improved greatly, whether you where a back or forward."
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,mb44k,8,Tue Jul 21 08:54:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely like the sound of this one, going to suggest it tonight.  One question though, did you run into defenses being able to predict the offense's moves too easily? That they would just demolish the guy knowing you only got one pass per phase?"
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,HanaHonu,9,Tue Jul 21 16:19:26 2015 UTC,We used to do a narrow field where the defenders had to hold a tennis ball on each hand.  Really useful for getting kids to use shoulders and arms and forget about grabbing
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,JollySars,8,Tue Jul 21 19:12:41 2015 UTC,Touch
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,cape7,4,Tue Jul 21 08:10:47 2015 UTC,Touchj is only good for regular rugby if you play properly by the rules and only use it as fitness.  Otherwise it just breeds bad habits and players get lazy at tackling.
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,The_Kwyjibo,2,Tue Jul 21 09:06:53 2015 UTC,it just breeds bad habits   Our nz coach hated touch for the very reason. Bad habits in game like running sideways instead of forwards.
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,mb44k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:20:35 2015 UTC,"We play a variation on touch depending on when the season starts. So our season starts in a month we do touch rugby, but it has to be with 2 hands on the target. If you only get 1 hand on the target can still run through but can't score a try. This eliminates the running sideways habit :)"
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,Exiledwolf,2,Tue Jul 21 09:36:17 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Running sideways was just one aspect. Our coach hated touch because it negated pretty much every skill we learnt from doing drills, especially defense."
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,mb44k,0,Tue Jul 21 10:50:24 2015 UTC,"It's honestly not too bad doing it this way, and it does turn into contact eventually as everyone starts to get a bit tired haha"
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,Exiledwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:57:00 2015 UTC,You shouldn't really be running sideways in touch either to be fair
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,cape7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:07:02 2015 UTC,"Depends what level touch you play. If its social, then who cares lol everyone runs whichever way they want. But more serious teams that utilize positions like the link, run sideways to create options for his outside pivots."
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,mb44k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:44:03 2015 UTC,"I've been having this argument with my team for the past few months. We're playing touch during our off-season to try to keep in shape but it's teaching and reinforcing a lot of bad habits. The worst part is that some of our better guys can do it, they know when and when not to do sideways; this then teaches our not so good players that running sideways is OK.  I'm trying to just enjoy it for the fun and fitness but it's hard sometimes."
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,grafvonorlok,2,Tue Jul 21 12:51:55 2015 UTC,"Touch can be very helpful for most of the game, there are a lot of variations that help to focus on improving different areas.  For instance, i've found that it can really improves defense. Once everyone has their actual tackle technique down, most of the linebreaks come from players not communicating, not keeping a solid line and having bad spacing. Touch can be very beneficial for that. If you introduce an artificial ruck you can work on setting up ruck pillars and linespeed."
rugbyunion,3e1jq4,cape7,3,Tue Jul 21 10:06:10 2015 UTC,The many variations of touch alongside good tackle practise is the way to go.

rugbyunion,3e25vh,BZH_JJM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:53:32 2015 UTC,Kenya will win the Africa qualifier if they actually field a team. Their union and sevens program is a mess with players not being played and coaches getting fired but refusing to leave.  The only continental qualifier that's a toss up is Oceania. I think whoever doesn't win the Oceania tournament wins the repechage.

rugbyunion,3e15oz,hoffawaffle,8,Tue Jul 21 03:58:26 2015 UTC,I love the ambition! Others will have different views but atleast here in NZ everyone of authority had been a coach at some point unless you're a fantastic financial backer of a team or club. Even then your decisions go before a board.   I can't imagine fast tracking through it quicker. What is your age? Qualifications and your knowledge in rugby?
rugbyunion,3e15oz,jeffrey2ks,4,Tue Jul 21 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"I'm currently 27  Business qualifications are that I have worked as a market and financial analyst since getting out of college. Some advertising, competitive analysis, patron retention, financial forecasting. Wouldn't call myself an expert but more of a jack of all trades with analyst work (if it involves data, I do it) and with playing rugby for 8 years and have coached off and on, I think the only thing on the coaching side of the ball would be scouting for now (low level I understand.) While everyone does want to be a coach, I understand I bring more to the table on the analyst side, but I wouldn't turn down an offer to be a scout as I know that can also lead to my eventual goal. I want to make USA Rugby better, either through business and financial leadership or through player GM decisions.   Can you tell me what Atlas is in NZ. When I google it I only get a travel agency."

rugbyunion,3e15oz,trees0n,3,Tue Jul 21 05:06:48 2015 UTC,"I'm going through a career change myself hoping to get into sporting administration/operations. I gave up playing and jumped on the board for my local rugby club because I wasn't happy with the way things were going in Sydney's South West.  I got into a postgrad Sport Management course start of the year to further knowledge, but also to network with other peers and lecturers (abundance of contacts).   Try keeping up to date with North America Caribbean Rugby Association (NACRA), which is the World Rugby regional association the USA belongs to. All regional associations have week long conferences during the world cup year, so try your best on finding a way to sit in one of their workshops. The other route really is to go through your national Olympics committee if you're interested in 7s.  Lastly, read, read and read. Plenty of books out there by sports administrators and universal issues in other sporting codes that occur in rugby."

rugbyunion,3e15oz,sennais1,2,Tue Jul 21 05:11:48 2015 UTC,"A few leads, though just waiting for my current rugby club's season to finish up then looking at my options end of season. I'm more into governance, funding, admin, etc more than coaching and high performance side of things.  Like Jeff said above, many club/administrator CEOs come from a finance background. Australian rugby isn't going too well financially and have put a lot of the rugby public offside in the last 12 months with the introduction of a new national registration system and increased fees at the grassroots level.  John O'Neill (former ARU CEO) released his biography 'It's Only a Game' several years ago you might enjoy. It details his first stint at the ARU, his time at the FFA with Frank Lowy, followed by his return to the ARU. He was the head of both sporting codes when they each went through their golden periods."

rugbyunion,3e0gc6,Bangkok_Dave,10,Tue Jul 21 01:35:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that, I'd rather someone young that's going to stick around. To be honest, Michalak is past his prime, not what we need if we are wanting to be true contenders next year"
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,Douges,10,Tue Jul 21 01:41:37 2015 UTC,"Its absolutely a stop gap. That is a good thing.  Queensland are not going to be able to pinch an international player who is part of his national team or pushing to make their national team - this is based on national eligibility, and also money.   Their best bet is to get someone at the end of their international career, a European, who wants to challenge himself in the Super Rugby competition, even though he could get better money back in Europe.  Freddy Michalak is this kind of player. He is a very good player, will add lots of experience to the young Reds squad, and will only help the young fly halves in Queensland to develop.  I don't understand why this news is looked down upon by Reds fans. I think it's excellent news. Who else would be (realistically) preferred in the number 10 jersey next season?"
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,Bangkok_Dave,4,Tue Jul 21 03:03:17 2015 UTC,"Ah that's a fair enough point, I guess I'm more of a fan of finding someone local (I really wish I could see a list of who is off contract this year) and KEEP them, hold them tight.   Fred may still have some flair in him and teach our young guys enough, but I don't want a new flyhalf, arguably the leader on the pitch gone every 1-2 years and replaced with a new guy."
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,Douges,3,Tue Jul 21 04:41:22 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think there really is no fly half in Australia ready to step in. McKenzie shows promise but is not going to be ready for next year. Duncan Paia'aia must be held in high regards by somebody but I haven't seen much of him, and he certainly didn't look ready this year. Greene is another prospect from club rugby.  Like I said, I can't see anyone else around."
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,Bangkok_Dave,2,Tue Jul 21 04:57:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's pretty heartbreaking, let's hope in the coming years the NRC blooms with ripe, young talent ready for the picking."
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,Douges,2,Tue Jul 21 05:12:14 2015 UTC,Paia'aua apparently played a couple of games at centre this year during the Under 20s World Cup. I don't know if you can read anything into that though.  We'll probably only get to know more about what he can do during this year's NRC for Qld Country.
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,GreatJusticeForSGU,3,Tue Jul 21 05:12:37 2015 UTC,I'm down on this news because this is a decision born out of massive QRU strategic incompetence rather than what is best for the team.  It was known that Cooper's contract was up in 2015.  It was known that Khoder Nasser was going to play his usual game of contract chicken.  It was entirely foreseeable at the end of 2014 that in 2016 we could be left in a situation where we had no long-term replacement for Cooper yet we let both Harris and Lucas go in favour of McIntyre and Paia'aua.  In April the first shot was fired with reports of Cooper going to Toulon yet it takes us until July to enter the international market for a replacement.  During a World Cup year.  Where by now all the quality flyhalves have been studying a French phrasebook for months.  On top of all of this we are forced to let go of Thomson who was one of the few players to actually play well this year.  I don't blame Michalak. I'm sure he'll play ok enough but he definitely did not set the world on fire with the Sharks last time he played Super Rugby.  </rant>  tl;dr We are now playing bad rugby both on the field and off the field.
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,GreatJusticeForSGU,3,Tue Jul 21 03:51:07 2015 UTC,"They do have someone young who will stick around, Jake McIntyre. What you don't want is to chuck him into the deep end without a paddle for a season. Michalak allows him to learn of someone with plenty of experience and he can come off the bench and get some game time. This way, if they don't sign quade in 2017 they will have a super rugby standard home grown five eight to take the reins. Smart move in my opinion"
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,Grandmaster_flashes,2,Tue Jul 21 03:02:40 2015 UTC,feels like a stop gap... abeit pretty poor choice for a stop gap
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,sdre,3,Tue Jul 21 02:32:29 2015 UTC,Is this Christmas?
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,ConspicuousPineapple,2,Tue Jul 21 08:07:10 2015 UTC,"Wait, Quade just resigned for 4 years didn't he? Does this mean he's moving to a different Aussie club?"
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,Douges,8,Tue Jul 21 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure of the details but I'm pretty sure they are working out a deal so that Quade doesn't play for a Super Rugby club, and focuses on Rugby 7s for Rio."
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,Douges,4,Tue Jul 21 01:16:24 2015 UTC,"Ah that's fair enough, I'm sure there is a ruling that you have to actually play in a 7's comp. before being eligible for Rio"
rugbyunion,3e0gc6,GreatJusticeForSGU,4,Tue Jul 21 01:24:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, anyone wanting to play 7s in Rio apparently needs to be committed exclusively to the program from ""January 1 [2016] at the very, very latest"".

rugbyunion,3e0gc6,trees0n,3,Tue Jul 21 01:36:29 2015 UTC,"They have the Oceania qualifiers in November, which only top spot goes through to Rio. Australia will only have trouble with Samoa. 2nd and 3rd place go through to a repecharge."

rugbyunion,3dz5ch,Philosopheme,19,Tue Jul 21 10:17:10 2015 UTC,"Nobody seems to mention that they are very hard. Very very hard. Saint Jonny's famous drop goal was immediately preceded by at least one miss. As someone  mentioned, if your forwards are dominant enough to get you in a good drop goal position you probably have the momentum to score a try or at least force a penalty. This means you're only really gunna need to pull them out of the bag in the dying moments of a game. So not only do you have the pressure of a wall a screaming players charging you down you also have to take the kick from a pass meaning you may not be in the ideal body position. Plus, you hold the success or failure of your team in your boot. I'm willing to bet if kicking drop goals all day would guarantee victory everyone from England to New Zealand would be banging them over all day long regardless of cultural bias but they are just too risky and difficult without enough of a pay-off to be relied upon to win games."
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,J0nShannow,7,Mon Jul 20 22:09:06 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of the time, if your pack is capable of consistently putting you in positions where drop goals will be reasonably easy (inside 30m, right in front of the posts), they're capable of getting you over the line for a try. Focusing on trying to get a drop goal rather than having it as a fall back is basically leaving points on the table.  EDIT: Just wanted to add that even if you were to commit to this strategy and have it work, it completely lacks a contingency. IMO you would need to commit all your time training to get this to work. But lets say you enter a game and go down by a converted try and a penalty early. You now need to score 4 times to go ahead unless you abandon your gameplan that you commited so much to. I definitely haven't thought about this as much as better coaches and players have, but I don't really see enough of an upside to take a massive risk."
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,doctorjones31,20,Mon Jul 20 20:35:55 2015 UTC,"It's a boring game plan and a poor spectacle for the fans (this is actually important).  You need dominance in the forwards. You can't always rely on having that.  It's only 3 points at a time, drop goals are difficult and unreliable due to having to manufacture space and the pressure on the kicker.   IMO, it's a more reliable strategy to concentrate on trying to score tries and only taking drop goals if a golden opportunity presents itself."
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,DrFaithfull,11,Mon Jul 20 19:03:26 2015 UTC,And if you have domination up front you'll probably be winning penalties or grinding out tries anyway
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,hutchero,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:38 2015 UTC,"It's a boring game plan and a poor spectacle for the fans (this is actually important).   It is nowhere near as boring as penalty penalty penalty. The Jannie de Beer game was a lot more fun to watch than a game where he just kicked five penalties instead.   I really hate penalties, but I have no idea how to make them much harder without incentivizing teams to lie on the ball at every ruck."
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,savardfaire,2,Tue Jul 21 11:04:50 2015 UTC,"It's the same game plan as penalty penalty penalty. It relies, for the most part, on forwards eking out either space for a drop goal, or a penalty."
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,DrFaithfull,0,Tue Jul 21 11:47:50 2015 UTC,"The gameplan to winning penalties is often pretty similar to scoring a try given how most teams play up the middle and only go out wide when they have to.   You can't logically say droppies are more boring than penalties. Watching somebody kick a ball off the tee with zero pressure on him is a fuck of a lot more boring than watching somebody try to kick the ball through the posts by bouncing it off the ground on its point with a flanker bearing down on him, who can legally block the ball, pick it up and run with it. If they were the same, you'd see drop goals all over the place as the risk of your guys being called for a penalty or somebody knocking on wouldn't be worth the extra phases necessary to get a whistle."

rugbyunion,3dz5ch,saviouroftheweak,9,Mon Jul 20 22:17:42 2015 UTC,"No major team has yet attempted such a strategy, in my opinion, because of a fear of being accused of ruining the game as a spectacle.  Some teams have, in the past (England in 2003 comes to mind) heavily used the drop goal as a tactic, but no team has ever that I am aware gone full tilt with it as a strategy... where 100% of the focus is on continuous shots at goal.  The reason, I think, is fear. In order to make it happen you need a coaching staff, management and players completely committed to the strategy, training specifically for it. If this were to happen then I would expect a radically different style of play compared to anything we've ever seen. It would take a long time to perfect as you'd need total commitment to train out old habits.  I think the public and player backlash would be severe, also if the strategy actually turned out to be effective I have no doubt that the laws would be be changed to nerf it... drop goals to 1 or 2 points I'd expect. Not worth the effort. Fascinating to think about though."

rugbyunion,3dz5ch,cape7,9,Mon Jul 20 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"If you have a guy with a cannon of a leg like Frans Steyn, the laws are actually skewed in favour of a team trying a strategy like this.   If a team misses a shot at goal dead, the defending team has to dropkick it back to them from the 22. Then they could just rumble  another couple phases to get Steyn in position and try again. As long as Steyn made sure to either nail the kick or push it dead, they could keep doing this over and over."
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,cape7,4,Mon Jul 20 20:43:34 2015 UTC,Totally! Imagine if you selected 2 or 3 specialist kickers with the rest of the back line being defensive specialists. Completely disregard try scoring as an option and take drop goals from everywhere within the half.  I suspect what would happen is the value of the drop goal to be reduced and/or changing the laws so that the opposition gets the ball back from where the attempt was taken in the event the ball is kicked dead.
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,ycnz,4,Mon Jul 20 21:04:49 2015 UTC,"Until they actually did change the rules though, it would be open season. I'd love to see Georgia give it a go in the world cup, they have most of the pieces to make that happen"

rugbyunion,3dz5ch,ya_y_not,4,Tue Jul 21 10:55:33 2015 UTC,"I mean, the strategy itself is also flimsy. Even without the public not wanting it it isn't very appealing. What if you go behind early? Go down by a converted try and all of a sudden you need to abandon the strategy or score 3 times. It's high risk with an very uncertain level of reward."
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,doctorjones31,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:30:15 2015 UTC,"You've posted twice that being down by 7 or 10 ""early"" is a problem.   It really isn't. Watch any test match and see how a team uses a penalty 25-40 metres out when they are 10 points down. They almost invariably go for goal to score the 3 points.   You don't start knocking back penalty kicks until you are 15 - 20 points down. Even then, most of the time you are going to lose regardless of which strategy you've employed."
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,cape7,3,Tue Jul 21 08:01:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they're intention isn't to aim for a penalty, it's to try and score a try. If they get a penalty they'll take it, but that won't be their gameplan. Getting a penalty is basically being ""given"" 3 points at the highest level. Taking a drop goal isn't.  Penalty kicks are far easier to convert than drop goals, even with the best conditions for a drop goal. A good kicker will probably go 4/4 on his penalties from basically anywhere inside the 10. Taking those same kicks as drop goals won't get you close to that good a return. If you're able to go 4/4 from drop goals, you're almost always in a position where could push for a try and force a penalty as a fall back."
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,DoctorDbx,7,Tue Jul 21 08:16:58 2015 UTC,"Its culturally looked down upon in New Zealand from the lower levels of the game. There is a heavy focus here on running rugby, the goal is to blow through the defense and get over their tryline. If you take a drop kick, its sort of seen as an admission that you couldn't break the opposition defensive line with ball in hand and you were forced to try something else.   This is compounded by the fact that to take a decent dropgoal attempt, you need to be a decent portion into their territory, you need forward dominance and preferably the defense on the back foot. If you have all that, you have the perfect attacking platform! why go for a dropkick when you are perfectly set up to take them on in the backs. Have a go son"
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,MasterEk,4,Mon Jul 20 20:51:54 2015 UTC,"Its culturally looked down upon in New Zealand   And yet Zinzan Brooke?  Let's not get carried away about some Rugby nobility here. Both Grant Fox and Dan Carter amassed their shitload of points through the boot, and Fox was a brilliant drop goal exponent.  The reason for the waning popularity was the introduction of the 5 point try. Prior to this the drop goal was a tool in the arsenal of every 1st 5. Now it is more rewarding to push on for the try."
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,cape7,3,Mon Jul 20 22:21:04 2015 UTC,"Zinzan Brooke's drop-goal was some other thing.   The All Blacks had already smashed apart England courtesy of Lomu at his absolute rampaging best. The English seemed to have no answer. And then they kicked it downtown, found Zinzan, and he audaciously dropped a goal from 47m.   It was supremely funny, for one thing, but seemed to mark a level of dominance I have never seen before or since. After one of the most complete halves of rugby you could ever see between top nations, Zinzan pulled out something wild, unnecessary. It was almost gratuitous."

At amateur club level and in schools the drop goal is generally looked down upon unless time is up on the clock and its been that way since the late 90s, those people then make up a very loud portion of the rugby community and it becomes a pervasive identity. Crowds boo their own teams for attempting dropkicks here.   I can't really comment about the change to the 5 point try as i was 2 years old at the time, all i can say is this is what i have encountered in my experience."

rugbyunion,3dz5ch,p-wing,2,Tue Jul 21 04:28:41 2015 UTC,"Prior to the introduction of 5 point tries (92/93 depending on your hemisphere) drop goals certainly had their place in the game.  They have always been a risky endeavour, but when they were worth half a converted try (or 75% of a non converted try) they were a popular option for teams camped in the oppositions quarter.  In the modern game, defense is more organised and quicker out of the box, making the drop goal both a longer range gambit and less rewarding than in the amateur days.  Still it has made its mark in several world cups and has served its purpose in deciding many a Rugby match."
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,cjgroveus,2,Mon Jul 20 22:26:17 2015 UTC,Short asnwer?  It's a low percentage play.
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,DoctorDbx,4,Tue Jul 21 01:36:49 2015 UTC,"It's not like it hasn't happened before - Jonny Wilkinson DID abuse the drop goal, and to great effect.  However, the circumstances have to be right in regards to positioning, and generally you need to be close enough to the goal that you're fighting for a try anyways, so it might be better keeping it on the ground. It's also more reliable to work for a five-pointer, and take three when/if you are awarded a penalty.  It's a little weird from an American viewpoint: our default setting is ""if the drive stalls, kick the field goal."" Well, drives don't often stall, and those that do without possession changing will often result in a penalty for the attacking team."
rugbyunion,3dz5ch,cjgroveus,2,Mon Jul 20 19:37:08 2015 UTC,"Because refs dont seem to be able to ref the offside line correctly anymore. Players are no longer specialist kickers. Carter, Steyn, Steyn, Larkham, Wilkinson.   Forwards are faster too."

rugbyunion,3e19x1,Rand0mNZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:49 2015 UTC,I don't understand where they get this 10 years business from. Stephen Hendry has the record of 96 months at the top which isn't 10 years either. A stupid clickbait title when it really didn't need to be. Putting the All Blacks in that list is easily impressive enough in itself.
rugbyunion,3e19x1,harblstuff,5,Tue Jul 21 08:34:48 2015 UTC,"It's ten years in total, not consecutive. Pretty impressive considering the rankings haven't been around for much more than that."

rugbyunion,3e19x1,JuicyEmmental,2,Tue Jul 21 09:08:46 2015 UTC,Difference is that 96 months equals 8 years not ten. Whereas the ABs have spent over 520 weeks as #1 which is equal to 10 years.

They had a golden opportunity to build a new stadium on the Britomart reclamation back in 1999, in the heart of the CBD, directly next to the new transport hub and waterfront.

If they were remotely serious about creating a decent ground, they could start by telling the resident's association to get fucked and remove the gigantic grass verges to create a normal-sized road, then add a pedestrian footbridge across from the railway terminal."

Seems kind of pointless to build a stadium to hold two events a year when you're giving the shaft to fans of rugby and soccer, which hold way more events there and are more popular sports to begin with.   Plus, at the risk of ruining what makes the Basin Reserve great (aka doing an Adelaide Oval), you could always build one or two proper stands to get you up to 20K and really make it the number one cricket ground in the country."

rugbyunion,3dwxb7,imrichard,4,Mon Jul 20 09:05:36 2015 UTC,"It's good to do with Skelton in the lineout because it forces SA to have someone stand at the front of the lineout. Etzebeth was there for a while until they just went with Bismark standing at the front with the hand out. Still, it means he isn't somewhere else lifting."
rugbyunion,3dwxb7,jbarbz,9,Mon Jul 20 12:04:50 2015 UTC,"I really like this from the Wallabies, if they want to run lineups like this where Skelton plays lock but doesn't get lifted, then they need to be inventive at lineout time.  I would try this lineout set:  Skelton-Hooper-Simmons-Slipper-Kepu-Fardy-Pocock.   So putting Skelton at the front of the lineout as a lifter, then putting Hooper as the front jumper and Simmons directly behind him.   That way, Hoopers lack of height is mitigated by Skelton and Simmons being able to get him half a foot higher in the air than regular lifters, he is also very light and athletic so he could get up off the ground in a flash for that quick front ball.   Hooper would also turn around and lift Simmons. That pod would have to move back to get seperation from the oppositons front jumper, like this:  Skelton------>Hooper-Simmons-Slipper---Kepu-Fardy-Pocock  judging from how the opposition counters this, there are a few options available. If the opposition doesn't move, they can just throw Simmons up just infront of their middle jumper. If they move their front pod back, that leaves Skelton all alone to take a quick ball like in this gif. And if they mirror, that leaves Skelton one on one with the opposition front lifter, who is probably a 6'0 prop, he should be able to take that ball in a one on one jumping contest easy.   This also leaves a pod to lift Fardy at the back of the lineout. If they want to get really tricky, both Fardy and Simmons could switch out and jump in between Slipper and Kepu.   This setup also plays into the Wallabies strength in playing two opensides, normally teams would be hesititant to have their 7 tied up in the lineout, but this setup leaves the hardworking Pocock and Fardy off the back anyway."
rugbyunion,3dwxb7,cape7,2,Mon Jul 20 10:32:55 2015 UTC,"That way, Hoopers lack of height is mitigated by Skelton and Simmons being able to get him half a foot higher in the air than regular lifters, he is also very light and athletic so he could get up off the ground in a flash for that quick front ball.   The problem is shorter jumpers have further to move to reach that height so the opposition have the ability to respond.   Another point I'd make is that you keep far more balance having a taller lifter behind the jumper than in front in order to allow the jumper the ability to lean forward more easily and claim the ball."
rugbyunion,3dwxb7,Hitchhikingtom,2,Mon Jul 20 10:51:43 2015 UTC,"The problem is shorter jumpers have further to move to reach that height so the opposition have the ability to respond.   That is an issue, but given that Hooper is 10-15kg lighter than the locks hes up against, i think the fact that he would get off the ground faster than most and the lifters would be able to move him through the air quicker would help to level the playing field there. I would only go to Hooper on his call as a shotgun ball if he saw that his opposite wasn't paying attention or wasn't in a position to challenge.   Another point I'd make is that you keep far more balance having a taller lifter behind the jumper than in front in order to allow the jumper the ability to lean forward more easily and claim the ball.   Having Simmons behind him at roughly the same height as Skelton should cancel out any major issue here"

But I don't think the point is where a team might temporarily take a spot. If they did something to snag a spot, then they deserve it but will need to work hard to hold on because they could just lose it again.  Here though, looking at the average over a period of time is the best way to see how a team is.

rugbyunion,3dvidq,Ged_UK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:16:17 2015 UTC,"In general we have State funded and independently funded.  Public schools are independently funded.  The history of it though was that there were no state funded schools. There were church schools. So people started public schools which were not affiliated with the church or crown, so that their sons could be educated about more pressing things such as the sciences.  Of course now there is a very strong (and very good) state funded education system, but there are many types within there.  Comprehensive schools are a catch all term for a state funded school which is not selective based on ability.  These could be Community schools which are funded by a smaller government authority and staff are employed by the state, input from staff and parents into the running of the school comes through Parent Teacher Association meetings.  There are also CofE VA schools (Church of England Voluntary aided schools) which are primarily state funded but receive extra money from donations by the church, usually this means very little more than they are just a bit better funded.  Academies are like american Charter schools.  There is central government funding available but schools are encouraged to seek out private sponsorship to pay for new facilities or surplus staff.  They are also given more autonomy on how they are run with an elected board of governors making decisions from staff pay to student intake.  They can be very positive, but if schools have one large private investor then there can be conflicts of interest.  If a big contractor (like Carillion) funds a school, is it really in their interest that all students aspire to do Further study and go to University? or would they prefer that students leave school at 16 and do apprenticeships with building firms?  Anyway, tl;dr funding for UK schools is complex"

Obviously some comprehensive schools have offered rugby for years (when did you go to school by the way?) particularly in Gloucestershire, it has always been a very positive area for rugby, really not discriminatory at all. But the main autumn sport for a comp is football. Lots of comps now have rugby teams, hell the one I teach at has two! one for under 18s one for under 15s  But every, EVERY, literally every single (the fat kid, the science boffin, the weird computer nerd and the football mad) able bodied boy will play rugby. The school I went to had 6 rugby teams PER YEAR GROUP. That means 30 rugby teams in the school. I was never very sporty and so was in the 5th XV each time. Not only that but we trained 3 times a week and had at least one inter school match per week.  The school I am going to be teaching at come September has even more rugby teams. Hell they have 4 girls teams. They have 10 all weather rugby pitches with flood lights and one with a fucking covered spectator stand.  I am not trying to boast about privately funded schools facilities.  Not by a long shot, I actually hate that it gives these people such an advantage.  I am just trying to point out that if someone is ""middle class"" to the point that they went to a public school, then of course they played rugby.  That is rugby's roots and that is still where a lot of it gets played and a lot of players come from.  Of course some comps play rugby, and of course Gloucester Academy is an incredible place to train, but you are really not understanding how much rugby is a part of public school life. Rugby is a hooligans game played by gentlemen.  This phrase is not just saying that rugby players are surprisingly polite, but that they are literally gentlemen.  I will now run down some of the highest capped members of the England squad:  Haskell: Wellington College (independent)  Ester: Dulwich College (independent)  Cole: Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College (grammar school)  Care: Prince Henry's Grammar School, Otley (Voluntarily supported grammar)  Youngs: Gresham's School (Independent)  Wilson: Harton Technology College (first true comp! and in south shields none the less!)  Ashton: St John Fisher Catholic High School (another comp)  Lawes: Northampton School for boys (Grammar)  Robshaw: Millfield (independent! and guess what they have represented at the Olympics every year since 1950 something)  Brown: Wyvern College (Comp)  Wood: Woodlands (actually one of the first comps in the country   Harler: Heathfiled (a proper comp, as in community school not academy)  Farrell: St Georges (Now an academy but was private before 2012)  Morgan: Katharine Lady Berkeley's School (Academy)  OK so seems like a decent mix?  State funded: 64% (21% grammar)  Independent: 36%  Well look at nations stats:  State funded: 93% (difficult to find grammar school stats as they don't technically exist anymore and some school are grammar schools just by name, some are still properly selective)  Independent: 7%  Obviously my selection of the top 14 most capped members of the England squad is a small sample size, but it does show a very clear trend."

You seem to be focussing a lot on schools rugby, believe it or not that is only part (and a small one) of the sport. To say that Rugby is an upper or upper middle class sport is plainly wrong. The clubs I've been involved with have been a broad mix of people and it really gets my goat when people assume that rugby is a toff's game."

rugbyunion,3dvidq,cavendishasriel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:18 2015 UTC,"not at all.  I have just shown you that of the top 14 capped players on the England squad 1/3 are from independent schools.  I am not saying that the only place to play rugby is in a posh school. of course not. I never said that.  But you seriously cannot deny that it is primarily a middle class sport.  But also that my original point that Benedict went to a public school so of course he played rugby.  I did not say ""He played rugby so he is obviously from a public school""  You are being intentionally obtuse."

rugbyunion,3dxvsp,mycl,9,Mon Jul 20 13:37:43 2015 UTC,To chime in to what you said there. The uppies and box kicks have NO purpose if you don't compete for it in the air! Folau was winning every single high ball. Could we not realise that after the first 3 attempts?
rugbyunion,3dxvsp,cubeyescube,3,Mon Jul 20 13:51:17 2015 UTC,"It was an odd tactic - the vast majority really did go to Folau. So much so that I figured it wasn't good positional play by Folau as it was deliberate.  The only reason I could speculate they were doing it was to keep him out of the attack. Taking a high ball in the contact area effectively keeps a player out of the attack for 2-3 phases. Perhaps the Boks figured Folau would be a crucial piece of our attack, and that if they needed to kick for territory, which of course they would eventually, it would better to take him out of the equation in expense for 10-15m or so of territory. The thing you don't want is to give him space to get a run on, or to link up with anybody."
rugbyunion,3dxvsp,gonltruck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:39:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I really couldn't understand this - like why not change the tactic? When you realise Folau isn't having an off game in the air (2-3 box kicks) you're probably never going to beat him..
rugbyunion,3dxvsp,SAGuy90,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:02:08 2015 UTC,This!!!!! Thank you. I'm so over this shit game plan. It doesn't work. We have no trophies from the past 4 years.
rugbyunion,3dxvsp,moreballsplease,10,Mon Jul 20 18:41:14 2015 UTC,"Typing as I think:  Starting lineup:  Forwards seemed solid, Jannie and beast silenced a few critics in dominating the scrums. Bismarck was fantastic. Didn't see much of Matfield. Back row seems okayishly balanced while missing Vermeulen. In general the backline is exciting and looking dangerous on attack, Pietesen seems slightly off the pace. Willie is hot and cold. Jesse Kriel and de Allende look very good, I think it's a stroke of genius to put Kriel on outside centre. Pienaar is fucking nowhere, always slow to clear the ball after taking three steps backward, passes at the player, not allowing them to run at the defense, which is criminal with Pollard at 10, constantly leaving him stranded on the back foot with the defense in his face. All those fucking box kicks at Folau.   Replacements:  The replacements I think is half the reason we lost. Other than Lood de Jager, all of them were far worse than who they replaced. Strauss was disappointing but might have just had an off game. Who the fuck is Heinke van der Merwe? We need Koch, Kitshoff (injured), Oosthuizen (injured). With the amount of injuries at loose forward (Botha, Alberts, Kolisi, Vermeulen, Coetzee now) Mohoje has to play, and for reasons we shall not mention, possibly play ahead of Whiteley (heh) and Jaco Kriel. I don't think he ever was up to international standard and was lost again this week. Didn't see much of the backline replacements as we kicked away all our possesion in the second half, at least their defense seemed okay. Lambie could have come on sooner.   The other half of the reason I think we lost the game was when we started playing negatively to defend the lead in the second half. Would the AB's ever stop attacking and applying pressure? The 'game plan' of kicking, combined with poor execution, Pollard missing the line kick from a penalty and the Wings not winning a single ball in the air, lead to Aus setting the pace in the second half. The weak performance of subs and poor decision making in the second half lost us the game. Maybe we needed Matfield or any captain other than Pienaar on the field?   Hopefully we can still fix this before the WC, but the plan seems to focused around Pienaar and a decade old way of playing the game. If we get some key players back from injury we might win despite Meyer's best efforts, purely on player ability."
rugbyunion,3dxvsp,moreballsplease,7,Mon Jul 20 13:58:06 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed reading your sentiments. I have to agree, Oupa is just not at that level. I like him and think he's a good player, but not at this level (not yet for that matter). Pienaar. Man, the box kicks, the poor passes and slow service. Don't like him. He can stay in Pomland.  Heinke... I don't know him at all. When he came on his pants were pulled up way too high and that already put me off. Did not scrum well.  Petersen should be replaced by someone who can actually make an impact on the wing, and compete for the high ball.  But I was really chuffed with our first 60 minutes. Solid. Bismarck should not kick. Everything else he did was perfect."
rugbyunion,3dxvsp,I_am_LordHarrington,3,Mon Jul 20 14:16:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks, ja, FFS Pienaar. The problem is that there isn't much hope at scrumhalf, I mean fucking Rudy Paige is in the squad. Reinach could be good, Faf also, but with du Preez injured we don't have any experienced players at 9. Is Sarel Pretorius still available? of Rory Kockott even?   Those pants, the less said. He was however very unlucky to be the only guy penalized for sealing off in the whole game despite it being done constantly.  What happened to Cornal Hendricks? injured? How did Senatla do for the Stormers?  Bismarck should just keep his feet on the ground and out of people's faces and away from the ball."
rugbyunion,3dxvsp,elljaysa,2,Mon Jul 20 14:30:02 2015 UTC,I know he's 36 (not that your country has an issue with old players) but Neil de Kock has played well for Saracens for nearly a decade. Saracens also play a similar kick-chase type game so he'd be used to that.

rugbyunion,3dxvsp,elljaysa,2,Mon Jul 20 17:19:05 2015 UTC,"i agree with everything you said here, but to defend Matfield a bit the line out was very smooth for the little while he was on. but man i cant stand Pienaar, the way he takes those steps back at the ruck makes me want to loose my shit. puts the whole backline on the back foot and allows the defence to push up. and then there are those box kicks... but i think we must have faith. they will tweak a few things and hopefully things will last 80min next time."
rugbyunion,3dxvsp,hautspurs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:53 2015 UTC,"I'm really worried that we're going to go into this World Cup with the same wingers who won in 2007... They're not great competitors for the high ball at this stage of their careers, and Willie le Roux is playing a deep FB most of the time to act as a second FH, so it seems crazy to employ the box kick strategy at all."
rugbyunion,3dxvsp,JJLMul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:23 2015 UTC,"We certainly need to change to a more grounded game that utilizes our forwards' ability to win rucks and keep possession. The backline is damn dangerous with the ball in their hands, and shouldn't be bypassed because Ruan Pienaar cannot toss a ball in front of Pollard.   On a slightly warmer take, I'd like to see Le Roux at winger for Pietersen and Lambie at FB. I know Lambie has divided opinion, but I like him at FB. I also like the work Le Roux did for the Cheetahs at winger, and think he has a lot to offer as a different approach to Pietersen.   And the lads gotta get healthy."

rugbyunion,3dy7y5,Anglo_Mana,7,Mon Jul 20 14:40:40 2015 UTC,"The game has moved on from kicking wins games I think especially against NZ and Australia. It can obviously turn the tide of a game but Ford's boot isn't terrible and is worth most of those points.  If you think we can slowly build into the oppositions half with the intention of forcing a penalty and getting 3, similar to 2003, then you're optimistic. The work that the top level back row players are putting in at the breakdown to steal the ball legally and before they're in the penalty danger zone is ridiculous. So to base a whole game plan around something that has been targeted over the past 10 years by defenses is probably not a smart move but that is my opinion.  Ford can kick at goal and offer a threat of penetration on the ball. Farrell can kick at goal slightly better but offers far less on go forward ball. Farrell unlocks Ashton and Strettle on the other hand Ford unlocks Joseph, Eastmond and Watson. I would lean towards the squad being built in Ford's favour and I personally like the direction it has headed. I can however see that Farrell knows how to win big games"
rugbyunion,3dy7y5,saviouroftheweak,2,Mon Jul 20 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"The big difference between 2015 and 2003 is that England were amazing in 2003. They really were a great team.  Wilkinson was a great goal kicker, but he was also more than handy around the park. As well as being great in set-pieces and at the breakdwon, the English forwards were menacing around the park. Even the backline was good.   They had a range of strategies, which meant that oppositions couldn't simply over-commit to stopping the 10-man rugby they favoured. As well as all those drop-goals, they scored 36 tries."
rugbyunion,3dy7y5,MasterEk,2,Tue Jul 21 02:56:47 2015 UTC,"I'm probably a little biased to Farrell from watching him more. For me, if we had a playmaker at 12, I would go with Farrell, but if we have a battering ram (Burrell/Barrit etc) at 12 I'd take Ford as we'd have very little creativity in midfield.  I wouldn't suggest such an old fashioned game plan with Farrell as you've suggestive, just slightly more conservative. Is Ford's strategic kicking as good as Owens?"
rugbyunion,3dy7y5,saviouroftheweak,7,Mon Jul 20 15:25:16 2015 UTC,I think if he plays the kicking game he has shown in the Junior World cup with his inch perfect bombs it is on par with Farrell's. But I hope we keep the ball in hand and kick very selectively.   I will say that Farrell's game management came through in the Aviva final and it was excellent. My only counter is that the final was a decidedly English affair. With Watson injured early and no one for Bath able to pick up the creative flair hole that his departure left they fell apart. Farrell grew in his kicking game with Watson's absence and imo it turned the tide of the whole final. It did show how a defensive team can counter attacking flair very nicely.
rugbyunion,3dy7y5,T_Finchy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:34:16 2015 UTC,"I think that we will probably have to have a battering ram at 12 given the loss of Manu (Joseph for all his many strengths is not the biggest centre in the world).

rugbyunion,3dy7y5,bobsyouruncle2001,0,Mon Jul 20 20:07:05 2015 UTC,I can however see that Farrell knows how to win big games   This is what swings it for me. Ford looks shaky at times especially kicking out of hand.
rugbyunion,3dy7y5,Chuckles1188,3,Mon Jul 20 17:33:38 2015 UTC,So Farrell is better because he lacks the self-awareness to notice that he's quite crap?  Much more significant though is that Faz is prone to bouts of petulance and stupidity that Ford is above. That's a trait that had many calling for Hartley's head for a long time (and indeed eventually saw him dropped) but for some reason Faz gets a free pass

He attacks the line with speed and good stepping, can pass under line pressure to effectively get it out wide. His kicking is pretty good (still finding his feet at international level a little) and his support running is much better than Farrells. Farrell has place kicking, goal kicking, solid defense, some turnover ability etc. IMO Farrell is a less talented player and may not see many internationals past 2015."
rugbyunion,3dy7y5,bobsyouruncle2001,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:31:35 2015 UTC,"Faz has no idea how to run a backline. Ford has an instinctive eye for a gap, and the pace and skills to exploit them. He's an excellent kicker from hand and roughly level with Faz in the place kicking stakes. The only area where Faz shades Ford is in defence, and Ford is no slouch there either but lacks bulk so tends to lose a few extra yards making the tackle. I'm frankly willing to take that loss in exchange for a player who is in all other aspects equal or superior (and is much more likeable)"
rugbyunion,3dy7y5,I_am_LordHarrington,-2,Tue Jul 21 09:15:17 2015 UTC,"If we want to win the WC we have to win seven games in a row. If we lose one game we're almost certainly out of contention. England cannot afford to leave points off the board.  Not only is Ford not consistent enough for that he's also not got the playing style for it.   World Cups mean playing conservative rugby and grinding out wins. Forward dominance to force penalties, kicking for touch and using the set piece to turn the screw. It isn't the time or the place for flash rugby, throwing the 50/50 ball or looking for the miracle offload. It's about doing the basics right, over and over and over again. Taking your chances clinically when they come and playing to your strengths.  Ford isn't ready for that, he got taken apart in the Ireland game by sexton and he really didn't fare much better against Farrell in the Aviva final. His game management is poor and his defense, whilst solid is unremarkable.    He's an electric talent and exciting to watch but he is not the 10 to win you a world cup. At least not yet, 2019 though..."
rugbyunion,3dy7y5,bobsyouruncle2001,6,Mon Jul 20 17:23:14 2015 UTC,"Yes he can be consistent but at test level he has mostly delivered. Against Australia in the Autumn England played conservative, forward dominant ten man rugby and won and this was with Ford playing ten.   Ford may not be quite as good as Farrell in terms of kicking tactically and at goal but that is not to say Ford cannot kick because he absolutely can.   The reason Lancaster picks Ford is because he can without worry. England will play forward dominant rugby no matter what because we have one of the best packs in the world. With our forward dominance we can get over the gainline and get quick ball and by doing that we earn the right to play wide. When Ford and Joseph link up something will happen.  We need the Ford/Joseph axis to win because no matter what team we put out we will play attacking rugby because that's how Lancaster wants to play. Therefore we need Ford because that's how we get the best out of our backline."

James Down is a good signing, was a good player for us before but tended to spend too much time on the physio bench.

rugbyunion,3dwu5r,jbarbz,7,Mon Jul 20 04:53:09 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the biggest problem was how lateral our play was. All coaches, no matter what level, should bang on about 'earning the right to go wide.' The Wallabies didn't earn this right on Saturday so their play went wide without any punch or go forward. A big problem with this IMO is the lack of ball carrying forwards we had on Saturday night. If you look at effective ball carriers that we had then it would be very low. This is where the weakness has been for a long time and needs to be addressed if Aus are going to win the RWC. In addition to that, if Cheika starts without Pocock and Hooper in the starting then 15 then he's either deaf, dumb, stupid or all of them combined. They worked immensely together and Pocock was arguably our most important player in the limited time he got on the paddock. Giteau being injured puts a damper on the team for next week although I agree with you that Toomua should slot straight into that 12 jersey. His straight running should benefit QC a lot more. Seeing the Reds lock partnership there after the season they had is very off putting, Arnold should be there being blooded for the upcoming RWC. Higgers and Hooper should never be seen on the same park again as they play too wide to complement each other, one or the other or we'll get monstered at the breakdown like the first half on Saturday. I don't think Mitchell did enough to warrant a starting jersey, I'd feel pressured to throw Tomane straight into a starting jersey after the SXV season that he had with Mitchell adding experience off the pine."
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,rhydianl,6,Mon Jul 20 05:20:57 2015 UTC,"In general, I'd say Australia's bench was far better than SA's.  And that we benefited greatly when Meyer made a massive mistake sub'bing his front row at 55-60mins.   Playing flat attack in Cheika-ball is a must. Cooper was too deep at times, and probably needs to be more direct to mix things up. His service & combination with 12 & 13 was quite good.   Our forwards' ball running was ineffective. We consistently played one-out runners  & didn't make the Bok's forwards think about who to tackle. Horwill & Pocock's injection rectified that.  Springboks had a field day at our breakdown until our bench arrived. Higgers, hooper and fardy didn't do well there & this needs to be addressed."
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,vagrantfoul,3,Mon Jul 20 06:56:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed completely that the Australian bench bossed the SA bench. Strauss at hooker had a shocker and Bismarck was playing like the old Bismarck from two years ago.   As OP said, that was probably the difference in the end. SA won the 1st half, Australia the 2nd - and the one that matters."

rugbyunion,3dwu5r,sdre,2,Mon Jul 20 13:41:17 2015 UTC,"I think our one-off runners (read: forwards and halves) were getting dominated in the contact, whereas our outside backs were having good times getting over the gainline. It also reminded me a lot of the Reds vs the Bulls 2010/11 where we would just run the Bulls off the park with constant sideline to sideline stuff, with kicks intentionally staying in the field of play and aiming for the sideline just outside their 22.  Having said that, do you think the pick-and-drive (I'm a big fan) was the option to get some go forward down the middle? Which could have had the added benefit of making securing the ball easier (since support was constantly being beaten to the ruck by SA backrow), and  bringing defenders in closer like you highlighted was needed."
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,sdre,2,Mon Jul 20 05:26:11 2015 UTC,"In my limited game experience, I don't know if Australia has enough in their forward ability to pick and drive effectively.  SA is known for their pick and drive ability. ABs make excellent decisions with their Pick and drive to suck in enough defenders to create an overload on the wing... hence the offloads and tries."
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,rhydianl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:22:14 2015 UTC,"That is a good point. I've seen glimmers of it at Super Rugby level for a few of the franchises but it's not something we generally do. I guess the key is to be quick at recycling the ball which requires accurate and effective clean outs.   It might be a better tactic vs the All blacks who avoid overcommitting to breakdowns and like to fan out a lot more in defence. Still, you need to ensure your forwards are getting back to their feet quickly otherwise that one drive too many gets isolated.   It would be nice to have a plan B other than kick when getting metres in close is tough."
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,Clay1408,2,Mon Jul 20 06:28:30 2015 UTC,Yeah that's why we need to identify Australia's game plan. I can't put a finger to it.  Is it the tahs way of using their big forwards to crash ball.....
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,rhydianl,2,Mon Jul 20 08:52:26 2015 UTC,"Constant pick and drives are a thing of the past. They're now more or less just used to suck in a defender and wait for your team to get reset again. I like the quick pick and go (see Steve Mafi for the Force) where there are lazy defenders as soon as the tackle is made. We just need to learn to win contact, get past that gain line by a half margin and it makes one hell of a difference on the overall play. This would also help our breakdown efficiency. Too many times we got caught missing players when cleaning out so or just simply not being effective and at least taking space. Pretty frustrating to watch when they're rookie errors, but it's much simpler just sitting on the couch drinking beer. We can't forget that we were playing against a world class side with a very strong forward pack though, Bismarck in particular is something else!!"
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,DoctorDbx,2,Mon Jul 20 06:27:40 2015 UTC,"Pick and go's can still be an effective tactic, as long as the speed/intensity is high. Say if you just committed one person to the ruck and the next forward picked up and carried the ball on, I think it would be difficult for a defence to stop. You would need quite a fit tight 5 for this to work well though"

rugbyunion,3dwu5r,rhydianl,10,Mon Jul 20 12:17:54 2015 UTC,Skelton needs to go to NRC and find some fitness.
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,sdre,6,Mon Jul 20 05:21:14 2015 UTC,"I would say his biggest weakness vs the boks was getting dominated in the second phase of contact. So he would draw in defenders and hit them well, but then just flop to the ground for an easy pilfer and doesn't hold onto it (which happened twice).   First around 8 minutes he just flops to the ground, Kuridrani and Simmons were inaccurate, and Skelton just let them snatch it immediately from his hands. This one was hard to apportion blame because of the cleanout, SA not rolling away and potentially coming in the side. I would probably blame Kuridrani who was first and coming from the side of where the pilferer came from. Edit: actually I watched it again. Just a poor cleanout by Kuridrani. Skelton hit really well and could have fought to stay on his feet but Kuridrani was way too inaccurate and didn't identify the threat in Louw.  The second was around 31:40, which was skelton on the ground letting them rip it straight from his hands. Simmons again was ineffective at the clean out but I thought Skelton could have held onto it longer and we would have retained it without penalty. Edit: At least Simmons tried to clean out. Skelton got hit and spun towards Higginbotham's side who just wandered on through looking for the offload and didn't even try and clean out Bissie. I may be a Simmons apologist   Still, apparently Skelton has the best maul defence in the game and  unless mauls change before the RWC (completely fucking impossible to defend against), he might be vital. Or refs could just do a Nigel Owens and let the entire opposing team leave their feet and tell teams to use it!  Edit: But yes. I would say this comes down to fitness on his part. He has definitely improved this season with I think the highest average minutes per game of any lock in Aus. It's good that he can play 80 mins in a pinch (say a starting lock goes down injured in the first minute). I think he will be great from the bench where he can focus on impact and not endurance."
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,douthinkthisisagame,7,Mon Jul 20 05:37:52 2015 UTC,"Why is Skeltons fitness always under a cloud? It was the same talk this time last year when he was omitted, there was talk about his endurance improving during the Super XV comp and now people are talking about his fitness again.  Who is training and feeding him? I dont think the NRC is going to improve his fitness mroe than Wallabies squad - Gittau was talking about how intense their sessions are - NRC would be a huge step down from that (even tho it is match fitness)"
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,Meshkent,3,Mon Jul 20 08:39:30 2015 UTC,"Yes Skelton made some mistakes in contact but I personally thought most of the problem is the breakdown effectiveness. Like you've pointed out, too many times in crucial stages of the game one or two blokes were making the simple error of making a missed cleanout or not 'taking away space' when they needed to. You cannot blame Skelton for this, he has done his job, broken the gain line and placed the pill back ready for the next phase."
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,Clay1408,2,Mon Jul 20 06:31:47 2015 UTC,"I be the first to admit that I was giving Skelton some shit during the match thread.  That said, Skelton looks servely lost and unfit. He's panting so much and rightfully so. To move 140kg of mass as opposted to 120kg (Eben, DeJager for example) requires alot more energy expenditure.   I'm not sure if its directly correlated (e.g but Skelton needs to up his fitness and running(more sprints more fitness/crossfit work) to be more active in linking up and providing support as well as pick and go)"

In European conditions in a WC, that's a massive liability.   Another big positive, I think, is character, self-belief and handling pressure.

rugbyunion,3dwu5r,Flys_Lo,5,Mon Jul 20 08:02:36 2015 UTC,"What's more, is that Giteau doesn't seem to be much better at goal-kicking, missing that penalty from 40m out in front of the posts IIRC.

rugbyunion,3dwu5r,shinypenny01,2,Mon Jul 20 09:23:29 2015 UTC,Awesome. I would too but I thought he might still have the yips. Well that solves everything because I think lealifano has that good balance between attack and defence that other candidates might lack.
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,zanger_done,2,Mon Jul 20 09:34:03 2015 UTC,Well he is on a plane to Mendoza with Gits injured - but we will see whether he gets a cap.
rugbyunion,3dwu5r,shinypenny01,2,Mon Jul 20 09:45:11 2015 UTC,"I was going to say Lealiifano too. He's a great kicker, and a real danger in mid-field and on the counter attack.   SA has a similar quandary at 10. Pollard is a fantastic attacking flyhalf, but his kicking can let him down. (Though he was good on Saturday). It's a rare treat as a Springbok supporter to see a flat number 10, running hard at the line. Lambie is a better kicker, but his attacking skills have stagnated in the last few years."

rugbyunion,3dwu5r,Anglo_Mana,4,Tue Jul 21 00:37:09 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think its clear as daylight.   1) Pick Pocock, Toomua and Horwill for the next games. Always pick your best performing players for the team.  2) Get consistency across the players, the players will gel. Team will get result, confidence gets built before RWC. It's extremely frustrating to try to get a team together to play together as a team when the players keep changing.  I know that it isn't as simple as it looks (Tactics against specific teams, the way we want to play the game.) But Australia needs to look at their own crop of players and decide what kind of ball games do they want to play; start building towards it and stick with it. Building on their strengths rather than copy another country's style of play."

rugbyunion,3dvmoh,night_dude,9,Mon Jul 20 02:39:55 2015 UTC,This tactic is beyond me. Most of the kicking was box kicking from behind the ruck. Really there was little attempt to kick it into touch. And I don't understand why they persisted with it when Folau was so fucking solid under the high ball. The game plan just felt completely off and incredibly silly.
rugbyunion,3dvmoh,Dontevenjoke,5,Mon Jul 20 05:09:41 2015 UTC,I was shouting at my TV the whole of the second half.  The thinking seemed to have been:  Springbok backline looks dangerous with ball in hand + Folau is the best in the world under the high ball = Kick all our possesion to Folau.

But, more importantly, Israel Folau - from a NZer's perspective - finally lived up to the hype that the Aussies have been ladling on him. He was immense in this game. Just nullified EVERY tactical kick that went anywhere near him.  Both teams' loosies were huge in this game, though. Hooper was great, Pocock was immense, but shit Louw and Coetzee and Burger each had monsters too. These Bok backrowers just hit anything they can, hard, and then get back up for more.  The World Cup is going to be so intense."
rugbyunion,3dvmoh,ozwozzle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:30:59 2015 UTC,We kicked a lot of ball at them in the autumn and I was nervous about the game plan given Folau was at 15 that day. But it came good - it was actually halfpenny that finally put a hole in the boat in the 6N. Was surprised the boks persisted when he was clearly just stupid good at taking everything with air on it. Hooper is a freak
rugbyunion,3dvmoh,mimo2,2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:01 2015 UTC,What is the rules regarding the saffa guy not contesting the ball and just running up and standing under Folau's jump causing him to flip at 1:42. Is that a legit thing you can do?
rugbyunion,3dvmoh,ozwozzle,4,Mon Jul 20 03:53:47 2015 UTC,"I think Habana lost out on the foot race. If he had gotten a step or two earlier, he probably would have deemed it close enough to try to take the ball but once he looked up he probably realized it's one of those situations that if he did try to take the ball he could have been penalized for taking the player out in the air. So smart play for realizing the situation, in my opinion."

rugbyunion,3duq4g,PetevonPete,2,Mon Jul 20 03:30:05 2015 UTC,"Wyles was born in the US and grew up here until he was 11. Corbisiero was also born in the US and lived here until he was five but chose to play for England. Are you saying that you would prefer the US not select these guys because they are too English? What about someone like Manu Tuilagi? He moved to England in his teens and played the majority of his rugby life there. Would a team  like Samoa be wrong to want to select him (had he made himself available)? It's tough to select a lot of homegrown players that stay in the US, playing a lower standard of rugby, when we have the option to select full time professionals. I agree that developing players in the US is important and grassroots is the way to go for that development, but I don't think that development is on the shoulders of the Eagles selectors. It may discourage home based players that people with dual citizenship are getting selected but the Eagles coach's job is to win test matches. Wyles has been a great servant to USA Rugby and deserves the captaincy."
rugbyunion,3duq4g,SamoanSidestep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:11 2015 UTC,"Of course he deserves to be on the team because he's the best player who's eligible. And obviously we want our adult players to go overseas for club ball because that's where they can play professionally.  But he only lived in the US until he was 11. His parents are English. He went to school in England and learned rugby in England. If he had been guaranteed a spot on the English national team, he probably never would have played for the Eagles at all. It can be disheartening to the grassroots development of the sport to know the best players on our national team are the scraps from other countries. It maintains the image of rugby as a European sport that happens to be played by Europeans living here, instead of an American sport."
rugbyunion,3duq4g,PetevonPete,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:54 2015 UTC,"Define legitimate issue. I've been following the Eagles for over 15 years now and there's always been a healthy selection of foreign-trained players. It does tend to get worse when there's a foreign coach but there isn't one at the moment.   The frustrating problem is the foreign guys are often just better. Nobody was complaining about Mike Hercus basically being an Australian when he was running the backs in the 2003 RWC, passing the ball to South African Philip Eloff to run over some Japanese defenders. In my entire time following the Eagles there's been only 1-2 Americans at the flyhalf position because it might require more native rugby intelligence than any position on the pitch, and we just don't have anybody native who can do that."
rugbyunion,3duq4g,savardfaire,8,Tue Jul 21 11:18:30 2015 UTC,"Any idea what the reasoning is behind this? I know he had posted on instagram after the lineup for the Samoa match had be released with the hashtag ""intimeout"". I wonder what's going on."

You get the sense that he got told he wasnt captain anymore and that they want to use him as an impact sub or something and he didnt take it well. Tolkin called his bluff and now he'll spend a few weeks really pissed.  Hopefully he will come around realize he still wants to play a role and rejoin the camp for the RWC.

Yes, his impact as of late hasn't been what it was used to but he was great coming off the bench last year during the fall tour. This IS a loss as the side is losing his leadership, experience, and physicality.

rugbyunion,3duq4g,PetevonPete,3,Mon Jul 20 00:29:22 2015 UTC,"Barrett and Dolan can both play number 8, but whichever doesn't will likely line up as a flanker (as Dolan did last night). Manoa can play in the second or back row and typically has lined up as a lock for the U.S. but I think the emergence of Greg Peterson could push him into the back row. Manoa has mostly been playing lock because we have fewer capable locks available than we do back row players."

Even though he is apparently 25 and 200 lbs, he looks like he's 17 and about 175. I cringed a few times when Tuilagi or someone was flying towards him...but he handled himself just fine."

rugbyunion,3duq4g,job895,2,Sun Jul 19 19:24:40 2015 UTC,"Rugby is catching on so fast in America (I play in college),    Hate to say it brah but thats been the song since I started playing in '96: ""US is turning the corner."" ""The sleeping giant begins to awaken."" ""Its catching on and becoming mainstream."" And yet here we are two decades later, still a little worse than Canada and just a little better than Uruguay. Its just not a sport with any kind of significant money behind it here, so while more people may join the amateur ranks and give it a try, we're still firmly 2nd tier and even losing ground to countries belatedly joining the modern world."
rugbyunion,3duq4g,pufftaste,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:37 2015 UTC,"We're actually worse than we were 20 years ago, which is enormously fucking frustrating. We used to beat Canada a lot more than we do now, we beat Fiji and Samoa in 1999 and used to wallop Japan regularly. We didn't qualify for the RWC in 1995 (the Americas lost a spot due to South Africa coming back) but we lost a playoff to Argentina by something like 12 points that year - the Argies would murder us now.  American rugby is really weird, it's never been more widely played. When I played in high school in the Bay Area (America's rugby heartland) there were something like 8 teams for the entire region. Now there's 50. Cal was Cal, but now there's St. Mary's, Stanford has a good program, and Sac State has made some Sweet 16s IIRC. Yet none of this is translating to the highest level."

My guess is the rise of the professional leagues means the tier 1 countries are that much better, while general political and economic change throughout the globe means the third world is coming on hot if not leapfrogging us altogether. Still, hard to even fathom that a rich country of over 300 million that loves contact sports is just barely better than a country 1/100th of its population. And its not like rugby is the most popular sport anywhere outside of the south pacific either; soccer is king, so its our leftover athletes against their leftovers too.  Sigh... Just so sick of hearing that American rugby is an up and coming powerhouse. Certain signs are good (e.g. amateur participation, some parity at the top of the collegiate level) but as far as Im concerned until there is some traction at the international level we are just spinning wheels, and as you pointed out, even backsliding."

It leads to higher prices, a blander entertainment scene and ultimately, more people drinking at home and loading up before they go into town. One sensible solution which might go a way to improving our binge drinking problem would be to jink the liquor trading rules to favour on-licenses. Why would people pre-load at home if on license alcohol was cheaper?   Edit: I thought this was r/newzealand. Although I understand pubs everywhere are under siege :("
rugbyunion,3dvhqu,fantasticmrfoxr,4,Sun Jul 19 22:39:18 2015 UTC,Yea the liquor law changes over the last couple of decades have killed the local pub and pushed people into pre-loading as much as possible before going out or just not going out at all.

I feel like our loose forwards are very similar in play style and our tight forwards aren't cutting the mustard at the breakdown. I remember watching a Samoam attacker go to ground and Thiel (Hooker I think?) tried to poach ball but just got blown off the ball resulting in a penalty. It was technique related, he was there first but didn't ""jackal"" correctly. Just need a 7 with great rugby IQ and technique breakdown and I feel like our attack and defense will click better."

Now dont rag on me for referencing 7s (where its a lot easier to jackal) but Danny Barrett is pretty damn good there as well. I remember against South Africa (i think) towards the end of the game on his own goal line, he arrived at a breakdown 3 v 1 or worse and managed pin the ball  for the win.  But now maybe he is being asked to focus on other parts of the game so isnt in as many breakdowns...I dont know.  I definitely think the observation is valid though. And I also think skill wise its a weakness of US players coming from less technical coaching as they develop. Will be interesting to see how they down in this facet against Japan."
rugbyunion,3dwbwc,Mariusuiram,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:08 2015 UTC,Samoa as a first international test is probably a bit intimidating for relatively scrawny flyhalf. Its not like they are technically dominant but...I mean just look at Tuilagi.

Savea on the other hand would be sorely missed, with Piutau leaving after this year the wings would be lacking.

Even taking out Savea, Jane, NMS and Piutau, theres still George Moala, Waisake Naholo, Seta Tamanivalu, Patrick Osbourne, James Lowe and Rene Ranger who are all up to scratch. Then there are utility players like Fekitoa, Ngatai and Buckman who could jump in there. And then there are the young guns like Reiko Ioane, Tevita Li, Jonah Lowe, Lolagi Visignia and whoever else rears their head in the upcoming ITM cup bubbling under.

rugbyunion,3duls8,WallopyJoe,3,Sun Jul 19 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"I was watching as well. They looked absolutely wrecked out there. Fitness will need to be seriously worked on otherwise much more explosive and seasoned teams will run them ragged. On attack they seemed to just shovel the ball out wide and it was very easy to defend against. Failing the outside break they would just run back inside into contact. They don't look natural with ball in hand, or look comfortable running off one another. Their play was very individualistic, which looked problematic as they didn't appear to have anyone with x factor. But in saying that, they have managed to achieve more than anyone had expected in such a short time frame. They are still on course for the Olympics and that deserves celebration. It can only be onwards and upwards from here."

rugbyunion,3dtyjq,metompkin,2,Sun Jul 19 14:44:11 2015 UTC,Replay on espn3 if you are american.   Camera work was deplorable. Most of the match was such a tight zoom on the action so you couldn't see the back line setting up. You couldn't see the second receiver beyond the scrum half after a ruck. The only time they panned out was after a kick and then they would zoom in super tight to the fullback.   My last paragraph just describes the short clip. I was pretty upset.

rugbyunion,3ducwj,confusinglycurious,16,Sun Jul 19 15:45:28 2015 UTC,"Think of it like this..  You could teach a person to cook in a short period of time and while they would be competent, they will still be worse than someone who has been cooking their whole life/career.  I'm sure Rowntree and the rest of the staff could teach Burgess the lineout but compared to someone like Retalick or Alun Wyn Jones who are deemed lineout experts he will come off second best, which could decide the game and ultimately England's world cup.   Also, Burgess would have to learn a new lineout combination with a new hooker (assuming Rob Webber doesn't make the cut) and new lifters (other than maybe Atwood).  Personally I think he should be a great option on the bench to cover 6 and 12/13, heck worst case scenario injury wise stick him on the wing Lomu style. He's just not going to get to the levels of line out expertise required to be in a World Cup winning XV in the time."
rugbyunion,3ducwj,captain_cabinets2,2,Sun Jul 19 15:57:13 2015 UTC,"I can understand that it takes skill; I certainly don't mean to belittle that. If it were hooker and throwing in we were talking about I would get it for sure. However, for the rest, you need someone who makes the decision (Lawes), and then 3 experienced catchers - front, middle or back, - Lawes, Launchbury and Robshaw, is that not enough? Otherwise, is it really that hard to catch the ball if you have learned the calls to the details of - ok, 2 steps back, jump, weeee... catch...?  I can also see the benefit of combined with an aggressive runner for if things go well/defender for if line out is stolen, for example?  As I say, I don't mean to belittle the skills, and Burgess is just a relevant example at the moment that made me wonder. Didn't Brad Thorn come from League and end up in second row (i.e. lineout involvement)?"
rugbyunion,3ducwj,J0nShannow,6,Sun Jul 19 18:37:34 2015 UTC,"To use the chef analogy again. Not only are you learning to cook in a michelin starred restaurant, in the kitchen Alun Wyn Jones is watching your every move to determine what you are gunna do next and fuck it up for you. While im sure Burgess can learn the calls, catch the ball and pass it back without embarrassing himself he is likely going to be very easy to read while he is going to have no idea how to read the opposition in defence."
rugbyunion,3ducwj,frakturfreak,3,Sun Jul 19 19:22:26 2015 UTC,"I think Thorne started in the back row in his first union games before he was shuffled to the second row. I don’t know how the point on backrow lineout jumpers was in the last decade. But surely Thorne had more time to learn his trade, I suppose."
rugbyunion,3ducwj,MasterEk,3,Sun Jul 19 19:06:29 2015 UTC,"Brad Thorn shifted to League and played in the Crusaders & Canterbury in 2001. I don't remember him playing anything other than lock.   Lock was, for Thorn, more straightforward than flanker. He was adequate in the lineout. He might have been designed for scrummaging (in the second row). As a flanker, he would have been relied on to deal with the breakdown extensively. There was no way he had the pace to be a back.  He was selected for the All Blacks that year, and turned it down. The cited reason was that he wasn't sure if he was committed to union. At the time, I remember thinking that there might be other factors at play--particularly that he might not have felt ready.   Thorn started in the Canterbury/Crusaders set-up, which was one of the most supportive and organised rugby settings in the world. The All Blacks were a mess at the time. Wayne Smith was really struggling as a coach, there was an intensively political environment, and there were problems all over the show.  He was a comprehensive lock by the time he joined the All Blacks.  It wasn't a great time for All Blacks locks. After Ian Jones and Robin Brooke moved on, there was a shortage of depth in the second row. Chris Jack debuted in 2001, joining up with Norm Maxwell, but there was nobody else in the frame (aside from journeymen like Todd Blackadder). Selecting Thorn might have been a symptom of this.  It wasn't long until the All Blacks had a great set of locks."
rugbyunion,3ducwj,captain_cabinets2,3,Sun Jul 19 20:55:30 2015 UTC,I think it's more to do with disrupting/defending the oppositions lineout that the real skill is required.  It's an interesting discussion though I definitely see where you're coming from.
rugbyunion,3ducwj,dazhealy,2,Sun Jul 19 19:16:29 2015 UTC,"It's not quite as simple as you're making it out to be. Ideally you want as many jumpers/lifters as possible to have as many different possible pods as you can. And again, its not even as simple as jumping and catching. There's a confidence that can only be built by experience, and subtle differences with the way different players react or move. It took me ages as a lifter to get used to a ""new"" player, which meant drilling continuously with him until I could figure out the way he took his steps, how long his stride was, whether he bounced pre jump, and how to anticipate where exactly would be the best place to position my legs, arms and body to execute a successful jump. Now I've never been a jumper, but I'm fairly sure there's a similar story for the jumpers. Obviously the criteria needed for pro athletes would mitigate a lot of that, but it would still take time to sort out, time England probably don't have."
rugbyunion,3ducwj,savois-faire,8,Sun Jul 19 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"Mostly it's important that it's executed as well as possible. If your line-out is weak, your opponent will give you line-out after line-out to try and force an error on your part. And any setpiece is an important moment where a mistake could cost you dearly. Here's Rowntree, Lawes, and Hartley explaining further: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tztumVGVE1U"

rugbyunion,3ducwj,MasterEk,2,Sun Jul 19 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"I would guess that they tested him in the lineout, and it just didn't work. Now is not the time to start training someone in a core role in the game.  Having lineout options is critical. If you are consistently throwing to 2 & 4, not only can the opposition make a mess of your line-out, they can also predict your plays off the line-out. Being able to throw to the back of the line-out opens up lots of options."
rugbyunion,3ducwj,krakkerz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:58:35 2015 UTC,"The skill to move, lift and, especially jump are much harder to do at speed and with accuracy under pressure. Every level you go up it gets harder and more critical, as well.  I don't think it's necessarily a case that Burgess couldn't learn the lineout in that time, but that he may not be able to learn it to the level required at speed and under pressure and still manage 100%, which is the desired standard."
rugbyunion,3ducwj,lynam1104,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:17:24 2015 UTC,"To me the only reasonable explanation of this would be instinct, he could learn the technicalities of line-out, the mechanics, the functions. But learning instinct past a certain age is very difficult. Would be the only reasoning to me that makes sense, the issues is the same logic is applied to the breakdown, something he seems to have taken to well enough."

These 2 were the only undefeated teams this year. WP are generally very strong though.
rugbyunion,3dto3z,grootes,2,Sun Jul 19 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"Couple of things:   The top 3 schools in SA are all from the WP region (including Paul Roos who recently beat Brisbane Boys of Australia, 35-3, to be crowned best rugby school in the world), this means that they were always going to be heavy favourites coming into this game.  /u/Grootes covered the second point really well. The Craven Week has been around for a while, with over 270 Springboks having come through this event; yet the organisers still struggle with getting the format right.   The third point is that EP just didn't seem to pitch for the game. Passes weren't going to hand and they were falling off tackles, it was quite embarrassing actually."

rugbyunion,3dtndl,ridernorth,2,Sun Jul 19 20:23:05 2015 UTC,"Signed and officially registered (meaning legally checked) by the french LNR. I'd bet on a 200,000€ or 300,000€ fee. He must really love hard the Olympics."
rugbyunion,3dtndl,CitronBleu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:51 2015 UTC,"Rumour was €150,000. Leinster's asking for €250,000 for Kane Douglas which is reported to be higher than what Toulon is asking."
rugbyunion,3dtndl,harblstuff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not a lawyer, but 150,000 use to be the fee when a letter if intentions (a pre-contract not yet registered in France) is not respected. Once the real contract is signed or more, registeted, it could be much more, usually it's one of the clauses. I don't know about Cooper's contract, but I know Boudjellal takes care to these sort of things."
rugbyunion,3dtiru,I_Gets_The_Reference,8,Sun Jul 19 08:39:39 2015 UTC,I'm sure it varies country by country.  But the coach is going to be the main voice with input from a panel of wise heads to make sure nothing crazy is being done.  I believe at the moment NZ have:    Hansen Ian Foster (assistant coach) Grant Fox (1987 First-five)
rugbyunion,3dtiru,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,5,Sun Jul 19 09:09:08 2015 UTC,"The current French coaching team is:   Philippe Saint-André, head coach Yannick Bru, forwards coach Patrice Lagisquet, backs coach   and the England team is:   Stuart Lancaster, head coach Andy Farrell, defence coach Graham Rowntree, forwards coach"
rugbyunion,3dtiru,fettsack,2,Sun Jul 19 09:27:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the difference with NZ is that Fox isn't part of the coaching team at all."
rugbyunion,3dtiru,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,2,Sun Jul 19 10:17:17 2015 UTC,But the french selection policy is long gone
rugbyunion,3dtiru,tangfest,3,Sun Jul 19 14:05:33 2015 UTC,"You forgot Wayne Smith (brought in this year for the world cup), and Brian Mclean (also assistant coach) :-)"
rugbyunion,3dtiru,Kiwiindoha,3,Sun Jul 19 12:54:58 2015 UTC,"They are coaching, but I don't know if they are formally in the selection panel."
rugbyunion,3dtiru,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,2,Sun Jul 19 12:55:38 2015 UTC,"Very true, I would say they have some input, but yeah potentially you are right"
rugbyunion,3dtiru,Kiwiindoha,2,Sun Jul 19 13:10:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no one would ignore anything Wayne Smith has to say about a player but I am pretty sure that when it comes time it's those 3 guys in the room for however long it takes to make the teamsheet."
rugbyunion,3dtiru,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,6,Sun Jul 19 13:25:45 2015 UTC,"In my dealings with semi-pro to pro rugby it's 99% the head coach(es) choice. Obviously there could be input with outside factors (sponsors, contracts etc.) but at the end of the day if the head coach can't get what he wants then why would he be there? The only sport I've been involved in that commonly have selectors 'employed' is cricket.  The Aussie cricket team does this and have done for a long time, the selection board normally involves the coach, captain and a few experienced heads whose sole role is just selecting the squad/team."
rugbyunion,3dtiru,rhydianl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:02:13 2015 UTC,Most sports here in Australia the coach has a big say and is usually on the board of selectors but the rest are ex players or coaches and ARU appointees.
rugbyunion,3dtiru,sennais1,3,Tue Jul 21 06:32:50 2015 UTC,It refers to the coaching team. Head coach gets the final call but all the coaches and senior staff (eg. Medical staff) will get together to discuss individuals and make the selection.
rugbyunion,3dtiru,J0nShannow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:01:29 2015 UTC,"I imagine selectors is a throwback from the amateur days,when coaches didn't have time to travel the country watching Rugby"
rugbyunion,3dtiru,MichaelHeneghan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:13:46 2015 UTC,Up until the beginning of the Schmidt era Ireland had a bizzare policy of the coach having to justify his selections to a board in the IRFU just before the match day squad was announced.  It was one of the things he changed.

Titi may be. And fry didn't look awful Barrett is once again shown to be the real deal and has great hands. I just hope he gets paid to stay on the 7s side next year Duratulo looked better than expected. Could definitely make the bench for the WC Dolan looked bad...maybe because he hasn't played at all Palamo makes me sad. He could have been playing professionally the last 8 years and be our star center. But I don't think he starts over Kelly and Niua now. Wyles and scully are like batman and robin. Love them Macginty had his jitters but looks the real deal. He makes things happen. Which you can't say about Tl'E. Shalom + AJ is a good combo"
rugbyunion,3dsl1o,saviouroftheweak,3,Sun Jul 19 04:15:34 2015 UTC,"I was impressed by Titi, and he's still very young (especially for a prop).   He's probably going to be USA's long term tighthead (?) option, Tolkin should be starting him as much as possible."

This may not have been Samoa's best side, but it was also far from the eagles best side as well. Threaten Palamo looked like a turnstile out there and showed why Suniula will be the starting inside center for the world cup. Not to mention the team's real captain didn't even play tonight, and neither did their best professional player, Samu Monoa."

Over all the only test teams they haven't beaten are the All Blacks and the Springboks (though they have had a draw with the 'Boks).   They have never lost to the French (2), The Irish (2), Argentina (2), Scotland (2) and Samoa (10) as well as other lower ranking sides.   Admittedly they are often used as a warm up game for a touring team so are often not meeting a side at the peak of its powers, but the record really does speak for itself, they are a strong side by-in-large!"
rugbyunion,3dsyaq,flyboyblue,5,Sun Jul 19 07:53:49 2015 UTC,"Also, the Maori are 2-2 against England all-time and 2-1 in the professional era. I think something that mitigates the fact that the international sides might not be at full strength in a tour game is that the Maori have such a high turnover of players that cohesion must be a problem.  At this point in time, I think that with a full schedule of international matches, effective NZ B and C teams would be right up there with the 6 Nations teams. South Africa could also put a really good B side out there, not so sure about the depth in Australia."

Well there was the 2006 Commonwealth Games which Lote Tuqiri and Matt Giteau were 'parachuted' into. People said we did badly at 4th, but it's really not that bad. But the competition has probably changed since then.  I guess I'm just sick of Quade pushing this sevens thing (started early in the year) as a matter of ""who has the right to be selected for the Olympics"", rather than ""please let us skip a bit of Super rugby, play a world series tournament and see how we go, then select on merit"".

rugbyunion,3dqo8q,Shadowing_Lemma,4,Sat Jul 18 17:32:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Even there his body position is all wrong. He's started to move right, so even if he didn't commit to Cooper, AAC would probably have broken the line by hitting de Allende's soft shoulder. Kriel has lined Cooper up perfectly, cutting off the outside line. At that point, he needs to be shouting at de Allende to hold position."

rugbyunion,3dss0j,Baxter_Cain,14,Sun Jul 19 02:42:40 2015 UTC,"Horne has his ticket to the WC locked in. No issues for him missing a week or two - gives the other guys an opportunity to push for their spot - AAC, Speight, Tomane and Mitchell are probably competing for 3 spots.  Regarding Genia - sad news if it keeps him out for a while, but really he is not effective at the moment in this Wallabies team. Genia and Cooper can play very well together if (1) Genia's running game is working well, and (2) Cooper has a big ball runner playing outside him. Neither of these two points are true right now.    Genia's slower service to Cooper works well in the right set-up as Cooper likes to play the ball flat and close to the opposition's defensive line. He looks to create space for outside backs through footwork and sleight of hand, but this only works when he has a straight running 12 who he can 'bail out' to if there is nothing on. If he is playing inside a more lateral 12 like Giteau (or to a lesser degree Tomua), he has no bail out, and if there is nothing on he is forced to take the ball into contact where he is easy to deal with.   And when Genia's running game is on, then the double threat of Genia and Cooper is very hard to deal with in this situation, as it forces the inside defence to be more conservative. If Genia's running game is not on then his slow service is a liability.  Phipps at 9 playing inside two of Foley, Toomua and Giteau is preferred for me. Genia adds nothing from the bench in this setup."
rugbyunion,3dss0j,Bangkok_Dave,3,Sun Jul 19 03:13:51 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ. Just need more time for Giteau to gel again with Cooper. Go back a few years last time Giteau was in gold, the Wallabies backline was full of running (2010 Tri-Nations Sth Africa Leg). 2011 saw Gits dumped for a ball crasher in McCabe at 12. We all know how that played out...   Australian rugby does not have an imposing midfield runner since Mortlock finished up. A ball playing 12 is the only option today. It doesn't help when you have guys playing one position at domestic level and another position at international level (Ashley-Cooper, Toomua, Lealiafano, Giteau, O'Connor, etc). For me, despite Kuridrani's form, Ashley-Cooper is my pick for outside centre. He suits Cooper's flat passing game off attacking setpieces really well.   I also put this down to Cheika's coaching role at the Waratahs. If I was the Wallabies coach during the world cup year, I would try to influence the Australia S15 teams to play Wallaby prospects in their ideal positions ready for World Cup. But he can't, since he is the Tahs coach."
rugbyunion,3dss0j,trees0n,4,Sun Jul 19 04:59:49 2015 UTC,"Sucks. I'm still interested seeing if a Genia, Cooper and Toomua combo works though if he can come back but there's not a lot of time now.  Realistically though next game was probably always going to start with Phipps, Foley and Toomua then have Giteau come on at 60m with Toomua moving to 10."
rugbyunion,3dss0j,GreatJusticeForSGU,4,Sun Jul 19 04:00:16 2015 UTC,I really thought Genia and Cooper were ineffective last night.  I hope Cheika moves Cooper to the bench and starts with Foley/Toomua
rugbyunion,3dss0j,white_falcon,5,Sun Jul 19 04:14:45 2015 UTC,I doubt they would have been any more effective because our forwards were getting shitfucked for 60 minutes until Horwill and Pocock came on.

rugbyunion,3dqopd,cape7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:13:10 2015 UTC,"You know it is extremely difficult to defend against a well weighted high ball when you are set in position and the attack is running onto the ball.  If you watch Rugby League, a contestable high kick is the most common play on last tackle. This is for a reason - it works more often than any other kind of play. The best defenders of high balls (of which Folau is one) still struggle against it.  It is an effective 'one shot' play, as evidenced here."

rugbyunion,3dsa4c,silentgolem,2,Sun Jul 19 01:12:38 2015 UTC,"Canada are missing Jebb Sinclair &  Jamie Cudmore.  I'm not sure if they're missing Taylor Paris or just not playing him  Japan are missing Fumiaki Tanaka, Akihito Yamada, Michael Leitch, Male S'au & possibly some other players."
rugbyunion,3dsa4c,Herreg,4,Sun Jul 19 01:36:53 2015 UTC,Why the fuck do the best games of rugby seem to be played between these two sides. I've enjoyed the shit out of this twice now two years running.
rugbyunion,3dsa4c,no1skaman,2,Sun Jul 19 00:44:53 2015 UTC,"There's a LOT of history between us. Both Canada's and Japan's first international was against each other in 1932, with Japan squeaking out a win (9-8). Add on to that two draws at consecutive World Cups... There's a LOT of history."
rugbyunion,3dsa4c,mattgrande,2,Sun Jul 19 01:02:57 2015 UTC,I can honestly say that watching the two sides last year in the PNC was the most enjoyable and best game of rugby i have ever seen. Many contest that but i fucking stand by it.
rugbyunion,3dsa4c,no1skaman,3,Sun Jul 19 01:07:15 2015 UTC,Noticed a lot of people behind the try zone despite a half empty stadium. Are those just much cheaper tickets?  Edit: never mind. Realized it's just US fans pregaming the next match.

rugbyunion,3dsrsc,Springbks7,2,Sun Jul 19 02:40:19 2015 UTC,Kenya were unlucky not to qualify for the World Cup.
rugbyunion,3dsrsc,I-Lu-v-Hy-p-hen-s,3,Sun Jul 19 07:15:09 2015 UTC,So were Zimbabwe I think. Didn't they all win 2 games and it came down to Namibia having 1 extra bonus point and Zimbabwe having a better Points difference for the Repechage?
rugbyunion,3dsrsc,highlander35,2,Sun Jul 19 08:50:15 2015 UTC,Yeah. Namibia didn't deserve a place at all.
rugbyunion,3dsrsc,I-Lu-v-Hy-p-hen-s,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:51:46 2015 UTC,"It was even closer than that. They all finished on 10 points. Zimbabwe were about 12 points up in their last game against Kenya, but chose to have the shot at goal and deny Kenya the chance at a losing bonus point rather than go for the 4 try bonus point themselves. They guaranteed they'd finish above the Kenyans, but the Namibians cake out and smashed Madagascar to go through on PD."
rugbyunion,3dsrsc,highlander35,3,Sun Jul 19 09:16:46 2015 UTC,"Given that Namibia lost to Madagascar (about 14 places below them in the world rankings, IIRC), and had to play another year in the African second division, I thought they weren't too deserving of having another shot at it. Plus, they've been at the tourney since 1999, getting a bit bored of their shiteness.   It's only fun when it's someone new and original getting torn to shit."
rugbyunion,3dtanf,jeffrey2ks,3,Sun Jul 19 06:25:03 2015 UTC,21-16 Samoa.  Good game overall.  Samoa used their size well early and tired out by the end.  I'm biased but I thought this was a loss by the US rather than a win by Samoa.  US lost the ball inside the 5 several times and constantly forced an extra pass when they needed to take it to ground.  Their only try was off multi phase play inside the 10 when they took their time and finally broke though.  I don't know where you are but it was on espn3 and you can replay it there for free if you are in the US.

rugbyunion,3dq02y,TheAbeLincoln,5,Sat Jul 18 12:01:46 2015 UTC,i couldnt understand that move either? he was brilliant all game and had such an impact at the break down.....why take him off?
rugbyunion,3dq02y,daieou,8,Sat Jul 18 12:05:34 2015 UTC,"Because we cannot afford to have Matfield, de Villiers, Duane and Bismarck all injured fron a captaincy perspective, let alone the fact he's probably the best Hooker in the world from a breakdown perspective. No one will give a shit about this tournament in a months time, people will be talking about RWC 2015 for decades. I think the bigger issue is the lack of depth in the squad, due to the fact we've given no other fucker a chance at Front Row until now."

rugbyunion,3dq02y,darthreallynasty,7,Sat Jul 18 15:10:02 2015 UTC,Exactly. I love the Genia of 2011 but for whatever reason he's not the player he was. Why does he move so laterally and wait three or four seconds before passing? As soon as Phipps came on our offence sped up by double.

rugbyunion,3dq02y,cheekybeeboo,3,Sat Jul 18 12:24:57 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. Hooper plays more like a smaller, faster 8 than a traditional openside anyway. Absolutely must have him and Pocock starting.  Skelton was pus and I think there were shades of the old Horwill tonight."

rugbyunion,3dq02y,DoctorDbx,8,Sat Jul 18 10:11:36 2015 UTC,Kuidrani hands like feet tonight
rugbyunion,3dq02y,Baxter_Cain,9,Sat Jul 18 11:17:51 2015 UTC,Pocock in 5 just proved his worth. Awesome charge down.   Still think they shouldn't of taken his higgers off
rugbyunion,3dq02y,justhadtosaythis,10,Sat Jul 18 11:19:49 2015 UTC,And there it is. Pocock you beast.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,pseudodoc,9,Sat Jul 18 11:26:25 2015 UTC,Pocock with the turnover just booked his starting position
rugbyunion,3dq02y,daieou,8,Sat Jul 18 11:26:44 2015 UTC,wow cant believe what just happened.... well done to Aus though. kept the pressure on and played for the full 80 min unlike the boks. i am impressed by certain individuals in the bok team but wtf is Mohoje  in that squad? and why take of Bismarck? good wake up call. and i have to say the ref had a great game also.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,cheekybeeboo,5,Sat Jul 18 12:13:04 2015 UTC,"The subs changed the game. For the Boks, to the negative and for the Wallabies to the positive. So that shifted the balance completely. What a last 10 minutes. Boks defence was great."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,darthreallynasty,3,Sat Jul 18 12:22:09 2015 UTC,Bismarck was like a vulture to our shitty ruck security. He's like a 3rd flanker.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,JPil1999,9,Sat Jul 18 15:09:19 2015 UTC,I'd go with Toomua at 10 and Giteau at 12 next week. Foley play's Toomua's role next week.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,biffo678,5,Sat Jul 18 12:34:27 2015 UTC,What about Phipps at 9?
rugbyunion,3dq02y,crazymunch,3,Sat Jul 18 13:15:58 2015 UTC,Genia is injured so that's a near guarantee Phipps starts
rugbyunion,3dq02y,da_gan,24,Sat Jul 18 14:27:30 2015 UTC,Australia always amaze me when you look at the popularity of union compared to their other sports.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,5cimos,6,Sat Jul 18 12:00:31 2015 UTC,This is an interesting comment. Can you clarify what you mean?
rugbyunion,3dq02y,BadCowz,17,Sat Jul 18 12:05:06 2015 UTC,"Australia 42,100 registered players  New Zealand     146,893  South Africa 651,146  England 1,990,988  Hold the phone ....

rugbyunion,3dq02y,Henezz,12,Sat Jul 18 12:08:50 2015 UTC,"Union is about the 4-5th most followed sport and really only played by 2 states. It's behind AFL, NRL, Soccer, etc"
rugbyunion,3dq02y,plato44,9,Sat Jul 18 12:08:15 2015 UTC,So it's that QC tonight...
rugbyunion,3dq02y,Jaeger999,15,Sat Jul 18 10:41:04 2015 UTC,Pocock you sexy beast
rugbyunion,3dq02y,CommanderSpastic,7,Sat Jul 18 11:26:10 2015 UTC,"Wallabies playing, Ashes is on and Freo are playing! Does it get any better than this!!"
rugbyunion,3dq02y,SuperCrossPrawn,6,Sat Jul 18 09:45:11 2015 UTC,Tour de France after the rugby is pretty great for me!
rugbyunion,3dq02y,Bangkok_Dave,2,Sat Jul 18 09:45:53 2015 UTC,"Golf too, and it's blowing a gale which makes it fun."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,CommanderSpastic,3,Sat Jul 18 09:48:34 2015 UTC,Plus the tour and Real is versing Roma. There is so much sport tonight
rugbyunion,3dq02y,justhadtosaythis,8,Sat Jul 18 09:51:13 2015 UTC,"That look on Will Skelton during the beginning of the anthem LOL  ""Awwww yiss"""
rugbyunion,3dq02y,Dontevenjoke,7,Sat Jul 18 10:05:46 2015 UTC,"Will South Africa go ahead and run the fucking ball! I know we like a kicking game, and often I'm ok with it... But fuck me, this box kicking and shit needs to fucking stop, god damn it!"
rugbyunion,3dq02y,night_dude,5,Sat Jul 18 10:46:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all the up-and-unders to Israel Folau were just... pointless. He nailed every single one."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,bobbysborrins,6,Sat Jul 18 12:12:03 2015 UTC,"There was so much promise for this halves paring, everyone was saying how exciting Cooper and Genia would be... so far there has been nothing but flat attack and useless kicking from the both of them it looks like they've both stayed firmly in the Dean's era of the wallabies. Either they need to step there game up quickly or we need to hope that cheika will take the both of them off"
rugbyunion,3dq02y,DoctorDbx,7,Sat Jul 18 10:52:04 2015 UTC,You watching the same game?
rugbyunion,3dq02y,jc-f,2,Sat Jul 18 10:52:39 2015 UTC,Yeah it is such an exciting game from both sides.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,BadCowz,8,Sat Jul 18 10:53:38 2015 UTC,Miracle win by the Wallabies!
rugbyunion,3dq02y,jbarbz,6,Sat Jul 18 11:59:10 2015 UTC,ITT: erections
rugbyunion,3dq02y,DoctorDbx,7,Sat Jul 18 12:23:06 2015 UTC,Hooper tackling like a demon but fuck me he needs to learn how to clean out better.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,Jaeger999,8,Sat Jul 18 10:34:18 2015 UTC,We just can't be two men short at the breakdown like we are right now. Hooper and Skelton really need to get there and put in.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,rugbyfiend,3,Sat Jul 18 10:35:31 2015 UTC,If Pocock could play lock. Would you take him over Skelton?
rugbyunion,3dq02y,jbarbz,6,Sat Jul 18 10:36:14 2015 UTC,That's outrageous the Bok player was offside not the Wallaby player.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,SouthAfricanD,7,Sat Jul 18 10:42:24 2015 UTC,Best referees in the game. Never doubted them for a second '
rugbyunion,3dq02y,guustavoalmadovar,6,Sat Jul 18 12:01:18 2015 UTC,Fucking Springboks. Did we just decide to fuck off in the second half.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,dubdubdubdot,3,Sat Jul 18 12:01:23 2015 UTC,"Nah, quade Cooper did."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,SquidgyGoat,6,Sat Jul 18 12:02:08 2015 UTC,Well done Aus. Good to see you get a win.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,chuckedaway86,6,Sat Jul 18 12:02:40 2015 UTC,Kurindrani making amends for screwing up the greatest try of all time before it could even get going on half time.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,krypter3,6,Sat Jul 18 12:04:28 2015 UTC,"The best outcome from the game, in my opinion, is the exploration of combinations. I think we've discovered some really telling information on who's up to scratch, not based on individual skills, but on how they interact with the team as a whole. I'm going to be very interested in seeing who Cheika picks to start next game!"
rugbyunion,3dq02y,DoctorDbx,5,Sat Jul 18 12:07:45 2015 UTC,"Pocock needs to start with Hooper.  I loved the energy Phibs brought, he linked up with Quade nice.  Toomua was great.  I love Quade but Toomua would not look out of place at 10."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,Goodmorninglisteners,4,Sat Jul 18 12:14:33 2015 UTC,Well we either need to fix our forwards or find a backline that can operate with 90+% backfoot ball.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,DoctorDbx,3,Sat Jul 18 12:24:57 2015 UTC,Good call. Quade and Gits lack of size made them suffer when they had no option but to take tackles. Toomua's size alone is a factor to take into consideration at selection for next week
rugbyunion,3dq02y,Goodmorninglisteners,3,Sat Jul 18 13:02:31 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter who we have from 9 up if we can't get them clean ball with space to use it.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,GreatJusticeForSGU,3,Sat Jul 18 13:04:14 2015 UTC,"Genia is probably the best 9 at managing difficult ball. But yes, the breakdown really needs sorting out, not only were we not committing many numbers, but also were even generally struggling with one-on-one cleanouts. Wallabies must keep their feet to be more effective"
rugbyunion,3dq02y,ValentiaIsland,12,Sat Jul 18 13:07:55 2015 UTC,Not sure I see the point of moving the match discussions to an IRC server.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,ValentiaIsland,10,Sat Jul 18 09:15:46 2015 UTC,IRC? What year is it?
rugbyunion,3dq02y,reddititis,6,Sat Jul 18 09:21:40 2015 UTC,"got a fright there, 10.05 gmt is 11.05 British Summer Time."

rugbyunion,3dq02y,small_far_away,3,Sat Jul 18 09:31:00 2015 UTC,"oh right, well done South Africa"
rugbyunion,3dq02y,ScottishUser,5,Sat Jul 18 09:34:39 2015 UTC,"Oh Quade, what are you doing with that pass!"
rugbyunion,3dq02y,krypter3,5,Sat Jul 18 10:54:01 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that Quade was having a go and trying to keep the ball moving, but a pass like that while so close to your own try line against the fueled up Springboks was too risky. He could have cost Australia another 5/7 points."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,jc-f,7,Sat Jul 18 11:01:24 2015 UTC,"Nah Kuridrani would have been at fault there.  He didn't even try to catch it, just threw a palm.  It's funny how if Kuridrani caught it, people would have been like omfg that was so amazing."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,Kreasy,3,Sat Jul 18 11:03:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the pass itself wasn't too bad, but the fact he threw it while deep in his own 22 was what made it horrible."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,wurdtoyer,4,Sat Jul 18 11:03:22 2015 UTC,Gits back on! Glad to see he's ok
rugbyunion,3dq02y,StopStaringAtMyJunk,5,Sat Jul 18 11:50:53 2015 UTC,Moore looks fkn badass.

rugbyunion,3dq02y,justhadtosaythis,4,Sat Jul 18 10:53:56 2015 UTC,"You watch, there will be a score of changes next game.  Then more the next, and the next and we'll still be left scratching our heads at world cup time because nobody has had a chance to build any combinations."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,elljaysa,4,Sat Jul 18 11:06:45 2015 UTC,What a try
rugbyunion,3dq02y,dr_chim_richaldz,3,Sat Jul 18 11:13:13 2015 UTC,the hell is the commentator talking about. There was nothing wrong with that pass from Cooper...
rugbyunion,3dq02y,maniac6911,4,Sat Jul 18 11:18:49 2015 UTC,"Anyone else think this tournament is already seeing the signs of a World Cup year? Some early substitutions with the likes of the entire springbok front row, Carter and SBW being rested for next week. This has been a good 50 mins, I can't help but think it's a bit of a blooding game now though."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,admartian,5,Sat Jul 18 11:20:38 2015 UTC,I think Toomua needs to come on for Giteau. He's had some good tackles but he's been a bit uninspired at attack. Toomua should straighten it up. Phipps speed of clearance off the breakdown has been great too.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,Kreasy,5,Sat Jul 18 11:28:58 2015 UTC,Aus Wheeled that so heavily should have been the other way.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,TastyAnimal,2,Sat Jul 18 11:31:16 2015 UTC,Drew Mitchell and Matt Giteau - what is this 2006?
rugbyunion,3dq02y,blindside06,2,Sat Jul 18 11:32:37 2015 UTC,"Damn, hope Gits is alright."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,DoctorDbx,2,Sat Jul 18 11:42:16 2015 UTC,"All I can say is I know exactly how the Aussie supporters feel after that spill.  EDIT: LOL, and after that scrum."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,guustavoalmadovar,4,Sat Jul 18 11:45:32 2015 UTC,Cooper should keep this jersey from tonight. Probably his last Aussie one.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,ValentiaIsland,3,Sat Jul 18 11:46:31 2015 UTC,Don't think so... Hope so... But don't think so
rugbyunion,3dq02y,GreatJusticeForSGU,5,Sat Jul 18 11:58:41 2015 UTC,You fucking beauty. So so close.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,rimbad,4,Sat Jul 18 11:59:07 2015 UTC,can't see it  oh great try actually
rugbyunion,3dq02y,GreatJusticeForSGU,5,Sat Jul 18 11:59:10 2015 UTC,Still a lot of work to be done but it is still nice to win.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,douthinkthisisagame,7,Sat Jul 18 12:11:52 2015 UTC,I hate booing the kicker
rugbyunion,3dq02y,DoctorDbx,5,Sat Jul 18 10:12:27 2015 UTC,Fucking shit fuck motherfucker.  That pass is what people are going to use against picking Cooper for the World Cup and then we are going to be stuck with playing fucking Foley and fucking Phipps as our midfield.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,douthinkthisisagame,4,Sat Jul 18 10:57:17 2015 UTC,What's wrong with Phipps and Foley? Much better game managing players
rugbyunion,3dq02y,wahpoutang,3,Sat Jul 18 10:58:24 2015 UTC,"If Kuidrani caught it he would have had an almost open run to the line. The pass was good, the catch awful.  Why didn't Folau kick it out? He's been shit tonight."
rugbyunion,3dq02y,DoctorDbx,4,Sat Jul 18 10:58:40 2015 UTC,It's an all round thing though. Why are we throwing miracle balls in our 22
rugbyunion,3dq02y,SouthAfricanD,5,Sat Jul 18 11:03:03 2015 UTC,I have an erection THIS FUCKING BIG.

rugbyunion,3dq02y,SuperCrossPrawn,5,Sat Jul 18 12:04:39 2015 UTC,this is also very true
rugbyunion,3dq02y,WallopyJoe,3,Sat Jul 18 12:15:18 2015 UTC,Should be a cracker! Hoping South Africa win it but without Vermeulen and De Villiers could be a tough ask especially at suncorp
rugbyunion,3dq02y,WobsJack,2,Sat Jul 18 09:11:42 2015 UTC,"Indeed it will be a tough ask. Our back line on average is very inexperienced and Aus will most certainly be trying to exploit that. Whilst we are experimenting so much I would have like to see more changes, like JDP sitting out as I don't see him starting in the latter stages of the world cup. We are also essentially playing a 4th choice No.8, I think Burger balances the other two loosies well, but without Vermeulen or someone like Arno Botha to take over I think the boks will struggle with rhythm with lots of broken play suiting Oz. Who knows though, we have some exciting and brilliant players and we could blow them off the park! Can't wait for this match."

rugbyunion,3dq02y,morningriZe,3,Sat Jul 18 12:03:24 2015 UTC,Boks threw that game away.  Had a comfortable lead and went into their shell.  The injuries didn't help but bloody hell was the lack of leadership in the last 25 telling.
rugbyunion,3dq02y,BullNiro,3,Sat Jul 18 12:05:52 2015 UTC,"Wow. What a game. What an ending!  If Aussie bonus-point Argentina and the ABs have a tight game against the Boks, we'll both be on 9 points each. That would make the AUSvNZ game the next week the tiebreaker.   Either way it's gonna be a cracker of a Rugby Championship."

They know they are competing with AFL Soccer and league which is already established. They know theyre market and position. $20 a ticket makes it sooo worth it for good rugby.  Also helped immensely convincing the wife with the kids into coming."

rugbyunion,3dq5ho,ayedfy,10,Sat Jul 18 12:13:58 2015 UTC,$60 for the nosebleeds. Steep

rugbyunion,3dq5ho,sennais1,7,Sat Jul 18 12:29:51 2015 UTC,I got offered one but it was $90.  Considering that it's the most expensive of three codes played at Suncorp this weekend it didn't seem worth it. Great game but I'm glad I enjoyed it from home rather than fork out $30 for three beers on top of the ticket.
rugbyunion,3dq5ho,ayedfy,4,Sat Jul 18 12:20:16 2015 UTC,"Sheesh. I know it's a test series, but it doesn't really help a sport that's struggling enough as it is in this country."

rugbyunion,3dq0cy,HyphyBurrito,3,Sat Jul 18 11:17:10 2015 UTC,The 'pro' one is just a polyester tight fit but this is the actual quality the players will wear. Different panels made out of different stuff. That's the marketing gumph anyway. I got it for myself as a birthday treat and the fact it's a home world cup.
rugbyunion,3dq0cy,WallopyJoe,2,Sat Jul 18 13:13:16 2015 UTC,I'm still wondering this. Canterbury have done the exact same thing with Ireland's jersey and I just don't see any reason at all for buying it.

They're only doing a limited run of 2,015, but I can't see how this is at all different to the one at the next price point, aside from the box and certificate.  Maybe Ireland's LE will be a slightly different shade of green..."

rugbyunion,3dq3nt,AndydaAlpaca,11,Sat Jul 18 12:53:21 2015 UTC,You're our greatest rivals but not in a bad way. Like from what I know the two teams are great friends and as a South Africa you have ingrained in your head the fact that NZ played us when no one was allowed too. In my mind I know NZ from 1995 and it doesn't hurt when we lose to you. I mean I remember being at a music festival and everyone stops and watches the SA vs NZ. Its just that we are rivals. We go hard against you
rugbyunion,3dq3nt,SouthAfricanD,5,Sat Jul 18 12:30:25 2015 UTC,Why does my fourth grade social team play so much better against the top team?  Everyone lifts to a challenge.
rugbyunion,3dq3nt,royal_oui,5,Sat Jul 18 13:39:07 2015 UTC,You only play as good as your opposition. Hence why SA brings out their top game against NZ.

rugbyunion,3dq3nt,Kiwiindoha,2,Mon Jul 20 07:53:43 2015 UTC,"It was 3-1, not 4-0.   Home ground advantage plus the infusion of new blood such as Fitzpatrick, Jones, Kirk, Stanley, Gallagher and Kirwan meant the 87 team was far superior to the Cavaliers."
rugbyunion,3dq3nt,GGG_letsdothis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:33:03 2015 UTC,"My bad about the W/L ratio, but you're forgetting that those new players joined precisely due to the rebel tour."
rugbyunion,3dq3nt,xb70valkyrie,3,Sun Jul 19 20:51:14 2015 UTC,you're forgetting that those new players joined precisely due to the rebel tour.    Which is true and bolsters my point. The 87 team were not simply the Cavaliers but were a fusion of the new Baby Blacks and the Cavaliers. They were far superior to both previous teams.    FB  15  John Gallagher RW  14  John Kirwan OC  13  Joe Stanley IC    12  Warwick Taylor LW    11  Craig Green FH    10  Grant Fox SH  9   David Kirk (c) N8    8   Wayne Shelford BF  7   Michael Jones OF    6   Alan Whetton RL    5   Gary Whetton LL    4   Murray Pierce TP  3   John Drake HK  2   Sean Fitzpatrick LP    1   Steve McDowall   That's the 87 final starting lineup with non-Cavaliers marked in bold.   If you look at the Cavaliers 4th test team:   15    FB  Robbie Deans 14  W   Craig Green 13  C   Warwick Taylor 12    C Victor Simpson 11    W   Michael Clamp 10    FH  Wayne Smith 9     SH  Andy Donald 1   P   Steve McDowall 2     H   Hika Reid 3     P   Gary Knight 4     L   Andy Haden 5   L   Gary Whetton 6   F   Alan Whetton 7     F   Murray Mexted 8     N8  Jock Hobbs (c)   only 5 made the 1987 team.  I'd agree that if there was no Cavaliers tour then the Cavaliers would have made up the bulk of the 87 ABs. However due to their bans it allowed the ABs to refresh and they were far better for it.   It was one of the greatest ABs teams of all time playing at home. They won every World Cup match by 20 points or more in a time where scores were far lower than today.   Not saying it wouldn't have been a great game but the 87 team weren't the Cavaliers. Gerber vs Stanley would have been enough to watch it alone though.
rugbyunion,3dq3nt,GGG_letsdothis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:56:02 2015 UTC,"Those players were selected due to the Cavaliers being banned for two tests after the tour. It turned out that the players who had participated in the Cavalier tour had great difficulty getting back into the side given how good the so-called 'Baby Blacks' turned out to be.   The Cavaliers v SA 'tests' (matches I suppose) were, on the score-lines at least relatively close (although the last 2 tests were a bit more one-sided). I think it is reasonable to argue that the '87 All Black team (being demonstrably better than the Cavaliers) would  have beaten SA on the balance of probabilities.   We'll never know though and its a classic yarn for pub banter."

rugbyunion,3dq3nt,savardfaire,3,Sat Jul 18 22:47:42 2015 UTC,If you're a top tier nation looking at a realistic chance of beating the all blacks you usually need to play at a higher intensity. They force you into it because they're playing at a high intensity themselves.
rugbyunion,3dq3nt,amplebooty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:19:25 2015 UTC,I couldn't comment (although here I am) as I don't watch them unless they're playing NZ or AUS.
rugbyunion,3dq3nt,threalseymourskinner,0,Sun Jul 19 23:19:25 2015 UTC,It's the same with all teams. They all life to play the All Blacks. More so then they do other teams.
rugbyunion,3dq3nt,batzman,14,Sat Jul 18 12:18:08 2015 UTC,"Dunno. I think for Ireland, maybe Scotland and Wales also, playing England is the game everyone really lifts for"
rugbyunion,3dq3nt,nerohamlet,2,Sat Jul 18 12:37:35 2015 UTC,i'd say the same for a team like Georgia against Russia
rugbyunion,3dq3nt,MichaelHeneghan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:33:57 2015 UTC,No.  6 nations is bigger as is beating England/France away.   It would be great to beat the all black's but most would prefer a grand slam.
rugbyunion,3doxe5,swainj,13,Sat Jul 18 01:34:34 2015 UTC,"Well, fuck.  A shame really, as he's been playing incredibly well for the last year or so.  Hopefully he has a good recovery, and can stay in such good form."

Carried off the pitch but I was up and walking within 10 minutes. I was in pain the rest of the day and night but just assumed it was a severe dead leg. Went to the walk in centre the next day for two suspected broken wrists (same day, separate injury...) and the nurse sent me to A&E with a suspected top break of my tibia as well as my wrists. Now I'm out for 8 weeks with technically a broken leg, even though I walked on it for 24hours +"

rugbyunion,3doxe5,halfpastlate,2,Sat Jul 18 02:34:33 2015 UTC,No chance.
rugbyunion,3doxe5,Rand0mNZ,3,Sat Jul 18 02:41:47 2015 UTC,He was in the training squad last year. It's not too unlikely.
rugbyunion,3doxe5,linglingdang,5,Sat Jul 18 03:37:09 2015 UTC,"They've still got Milner-Skudder in the squad waiting for a go as well as Cory Jane's return. Besides with the way Dagg played it's likely the All Blacks back 3 ends up being Savea, Dagg, Smith."
rugbyunion,3doxe5,trouting,2,Sat Jul 18 03:40:08 2015 UTC,Crotty played well on the right previously. Also Charles Piatau is quality.  I prefer Ben Smith at Fullback.

rugbyunion,3doxe5,batzman,2,Sat Jul 18 23:26:50 2015 UTC,To be honest I don't think he would have made the final squad anyway
rugbyunion,3doxe5,randomalbumtitle,3,Sat Jul 18 01:41:18 2015 UTC,"Really? He played well on Friday didn't he? Had a big break at one point, although I will admit that Justin Marshall embellished it substantially."
rugbyunion,3doxe5,canetrain,4,Sat Jul 18 01:56:07 2015 UTC,I think he did well. But over the past two weeks it would be hard to leave Piutau out of the squad. I'd be keen to see him in 14 with Savea at 11.
rugbyunion,3doxe5,ycnz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:01:58 2015 UTC,"Really? Admittedly Piutau's been hamstrung by his team, but still, he's never quite set the world on fire when I've been watching."

rugbyunion,3doxe5,batzman,3,Sat Jul 18 10:16:31 2015 UTC,Played pretty well other then a few knock ons. Just the fact that there is so much outside back cover I don't think he would make the cut.
rugbyunion,3doxe5,halfpastlate,3,Sat Jul 18 02:03:04 2015 UTC,I agree I think Hansen & co would've gone with Piutau as the extra winger.
rugbyunion,3doxe5,batzman,5,Sat Jul 18 02:44:03 2015 UTC,"Yea he offers cover at full back, wing and centre so a better option."

rugbyunion,3dq7uw,BendMyDickToMyAss_,8,Sat Jul 18 13:38:11 2015 UTC,"If you're watching a video of Giteau explaining how to transition into pro rugby, you won't find it in the US.  It's not that we don't produce good rugby.  It's that mainly, this country does not have coaches or programs to where there are clear and obvious paths to transition into pro rugby.  I would suggest, if you're serious, to look to playing overseas.  In NZL or AUS or ENG.  The US has a very big problem respecting the game.  We overlook fundamental basics, and proper ways of coaching.  I had a teamate move to NZL one summer to play a season.  He said he learned more in 3 months, than he did playing for several years here.  When he came back, he admitted a significant drop in his enthusiasm to play rugby in the US anymore.  It's just an unfortunate truth that US players are all products of unfortunate circumstances to were we have the blind leading the blind."

rugbyunion,3dmzld,sdfdsize,11,Fri Jul 17 16:15:59 2015 UTC,Nonu boshing people? Who would have thought! I think Nonu is great but Nonu being strong is the worst play to show to show how good he is.
rugbyunion,3dmzld,the_ugly_judge,8,Fri Jul 17 20:31:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm pretty sure even the biggest Nonu doubter wouldn't accuse him of lacking upper body strength.
rugbyunion,3dmzld,sm00thArsenal,19,Fri Jul 17 23:01:37 2015 UTC,Surely the Nonu doubters are long gone. Particularly after the season he had with the canes
rugbyunion,3dmzld,pooroldben,4,Fri Jul 17 16:58:10 2015 UTC,The only thing that concerns me is the shoulder charges. His brain seems to switch off sometimes. e.g. the shoulder charge on Nadolo during S15
rugbyunion,3dmzld,Lyesalot,4,Sat Jul 18 07:31:05 2015 UTC,"This is where I stand. Amazing all round player. Incredible at times. But he really does things sometimes that leave you scratching your head, then totally redeems himself with something stellar."
rugbyunion,3dmzld,jeffrey2ks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:56:49 2015 UTC,"Basically this. During his return to the Canes, he waas back on form."
rugbyunion,3dmzld,MrTuxedoMan,27,Sat Jul 18 02:35:43 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand the hate Nonu comes in for - he used to be a reckless and hotheaded player, but has developed into arguably the best 12 in the world. Difficult to place anyone above him in terms of how rounded his game is."

rugbyunion,3dmzld,reggie_007,2,Sat Jul 18 02:03:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that, SBW player out if good skin last night."
rugbyunion,3dmzld,Flys_Lo,5,Sat Jul 18 02:38:11 2015 UTC,"He did. After his season with the Chiefs, as a Wallabies fan I was sadly hoping for him to have lost his form because he is such a weapon, but his tackling was immense last night and his trademark late offloads putting players in space looked as dangerous as ever.  However I'm still not sure he will be starting with the form of both Nonu and Smith."
rugbyunion,3dmzld,Pukako,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:54:51 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons the Highlanders beat the Chiefs all game this yeah was that they had worked out SBW's flaws and exploited them. Always have someone rushing up on his side to disrupt or grab the 50/50 offload,  and he doesn't like the big tackles being put on him. Also a liability at the ruck for the most part, although he went okay last night."
rugbyunion,3dmzld,wigguno,2,Sat Jul 18 04:06:15 2015 UTC,"50/50 chance of offload? you mean 50% offload left, 50% offload right"
rugbyunion,3dmzld,Nelfoos5,6,Sat Jul 18 13:08:08 2015 UTC,"Smith > Nonu > SBW. They may play together in pool matches but when it counts, we have to pick the combination who has played together for a decade and formed one of the best centre pairings ever, and they're both currently in fantastic form after a great Super 15 campaign.  Also I hate SBW so I'm slightly biased."
rugbyunion,3dmzld,Infinity_Complex,-3,Sat Jul 18 03:26:55 2015 UTC,Nearly everybody I know that watches rugby in NZ doesnt rate him - he is too inconsistent. He kicks way too often and he mays a shocking amount of mistakes
rugbyunion,3dmzld,ARP31,6,Sat Jul 18 12:27:20 2015 UTC,New Zealander's are notorious for being hypercritical of their own players/team though aren't they? I think there's definitely a gulf between his club form and his international form though - I'd say an on-form JDV is the only world 12 who can come close to him
rugbyunion,3dmzld,cape7,3,Sat Jul 18 12:36:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the only person i've really heard say they don't rate Nonu is you on this subreddit."

rugbyunion,3dmzld,BZH_JJM,5,Sun Jul 19 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"I think even the most extreme Nonu doubters would admit that he always performs in black. The main complaint was for a few years, he didn't really play that in Super Rugby."
rugbyunion,3dmzld,Speedbump_NZ,3,Fri Jul 17 19:53:30 2015 UTC,That was more a headbutting session between Nonu and Hammett.  The Nonu doubters typically shut up once he switched the yellow jsersey for a black one.
rugbyunion,3dmzld,ycnz,-9,Sat Jul 18 03:54:41 2015 UTC,"Also, he's a cunt."

When Richie had a bad foot most of the last two years Cane stood in for the ABs and Richie would come on as the no. 6 for the last 20ish minutes whilst cane stayed at 7.  From what I can tell atm he's fallen out of favour for Julian Savea as the 2nd best kiwi open side.  I'm an Aussie though so maybe a kiwi can tell you more.

If u are in the oppositions try area and u as an attacking team knock the ball on while the ball is on the ground, that is a try. Because there is no downward pressure required for a try in union.   Witnessed last year."
rugbyunion,3dq6af,Baxter_Cain,2,Sat Jul 18 12:29:36 2015 UTC,"No, a knock on is a knock on, if you are attempting to score a try and you knock it on, that's a knock on, scrum 5 defending.   If you knock on in your own in goal (as per OP's question) that's a scrum 5 attacking"
rugbyunion,3dq6af,The_Orgasmo,2,Sat Jul 18 12:40:44 2015 UTC,"If all that is required for a try in union is hand or finger contact with the ball in the try area and no downward pressure, how would one knock it on as the second u touch it, its considered a try?"
rugbyunion,3dq6af,Chubbs_McGavin,4,Sat Jul 18 12:48:15 2015 UTC,You need control for a try in union. A knock on is not control.
rugbyunion,3dq6af,daveh1980,4,Sat Jul 18 21:30:46 2015 UTC,"If ball is stationary on ground and you touch it, you are correct, that is a try. But if you knock it on/drop it then, (obviously) no try.   The scenario you are talking about has nothing to do with OP's question."
rugbyunion,3dq6af,Baxter_Cain,2,Sat Jul 18 14:03:50 2015 UTC,"Law 22.1  There are two ways a player can ground the ball: (a) Player touches the ground with the ball. A player grounds the ball by holding the ball and touching the ground with it, in in-goal. ‘Holding’ means holding in the hand or hands, or in the arm or arms. No downward pressure is required. (b) Player presses down on the ball. A player grounds the ball when it is on the ground in the in-goal and the player presses down on it with a hand or hands, arm or arms, or the front of the player’s body from waist to neck inclusive."
rugbyunion,3dq6af,metompkin,2,Sat Jul 18 12:58:57 2015 UTC,"So our guy dove and slid in the wet with his arm extended. As he was sliding across the line, the ball left his hand but the ball had passed the try line while sliding (touchies call). Other team called lost possession. I am starting to see this clearer now with the definition.   I wonder if touching is also because u can't use downward pressure if the ball hits the goal posts...?"

rugbyunion,3dof3w,rsabulls,10,Fri Jul 17 23:34:14 2015 UTC,The problem being that you can't legally defend them once they get going. As it stands they're a cheap tactic that utilises sanctioned obstruction.
rugbyunion,3dof3w,threalseymourskinner,6,Sat Jul 18 06:52:35 2015 UTC,Part of the game is power and strength if you dominate the opposition in this way you should have the advantage in that situation.
rugbyunion,3dof3w,saviouroftheweak,2,Sat Jul 18 08:37:57 2015 UTC,"The maul is almost never about strength or domination. In a maul, rarely does the attacking team actually power straight through, they usually wrap around the sides. If you disagree, just watch one carefully."
rugbyunion,3dof3w,bobwinters,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:37:48 2015 UTC,"That's a bit of a circular argument, though. The team forming the maul has an advantage before power and strength come into it, because of the way they are enforced."
rugbyunion,3dof3w,belriose,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:49:29 2015 UTC,In a sense but the choke tackle underlines how a defense can take advantage of the same law.
rugbyunion,3dof3w,saviouroftheweak,2,Sun Jul 19 19:06:57 2015 UTC,Of course you can legally stop them. Put more men in front of it and physically stop it. The idea that it's legalised obstruction is nonsense. There are clear rules to how a maul is formed. It really does seem like Hansen wants to make rugby union all about how the AB play. He is entitled to his opinion but that's all it should be seen as. If he's that worried about the maul maybe he needs to deal with it on the training paddock like everyone else as opposed to suggesting restructuring the game to suit his team.
rugbyunion,3dof3w,0_kelvin_ballsack,2,Sun Jul 19 07:41:19 2015 UTC,"It's part of the physical, powerful half of the game. Rugby has both big guys driving through the defense and little guys running around it. It would be a shame to lose either."

So often you'll see ball carriers briefly unbind, and the refs don't pick it up.  Don't remove it, just work out how to ref it correctly.   Maybe the closest touchie should be involved with either the attackers or defenders when it comes to a maul?   I don't know, but there's got to be a better way to do it."

rugbyunion,3dof3w,ronnierosenthal,5,Sat Jul 18 05:42:29 2015 UTC,Not really. Most mauls don't last more than a few seconds before one team infringes or releases the ball. I'm not sure of the stats but I'd wager the ball spends very little time in/behind a maul over 80 minutes.

I mean, you never find people in soccer proposing players be able to pick the ball up and throw it to make it more exciting.  edit: just re-read it ""there's never been anyone injured in a collapsed maul"" - what the fuck? People DIED in collapsed mauls when it was legal under the ELVs."
rugbyunion,3dof3w,J0nShannow,2,Sat Jul 18 16:22:10 2015 UTC,The easiest legal way to defend it is to stop it moving. Once it's no longer moving forward the attacking team has a short space of time to either get it moving again or they have to pass it out. I don't get why the rolling maul is getting so much flak these days. Not just from Shag but from a variety of directions.
rugbyunion,3dof3w,BZH_JJM,3,Sat Jul 18 09:30:11 2015 UTC,I once saw a team do a rolling maul in a sevens match. It was wonderful. Hansen must angling for the NZ tag rugby position after comments like this.
rugbyunion,3dof3w,threalseymourskinner,3,Fri Jul 17 23:44:03 2015 UTC,The problem Shag was addressing was that there isn't a lot you can do to defend against them.
rugbyunion,3dof3w,Flys_Lo,9,Sat Jul 18 06:48:37 2015 UTC,"Well there is. You can not set as the opposing team (preventing the maul from occuring), and just go after the ball carrier.  You can also reach through the maul and get the ball carrier, which will almost always guarantee a penalty in your favour."
rugbyunion,3dof3w,bobwinters,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:37:19 2015 UTC,The Chiefs were sacking the maul throughout the S15 and I noticed the under-20s did this as well. I just have NO IDEA why the ABs don't use this method.

rugbyunion,3dof3w,JohnP93FAGGOT,6,Sat Jul 18 06:08:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, so lets not say one sided then. Instead lets ask, seriously, how many games in the last 5 years would you have bet against them?   I think theyre awesome and super talented etc and I'm not trying to take anything away from that, but its boring as shit going into a game knowing they're almost certainly going to win. That's why the S15 series is much more enjoyable, for me at least.   I remember when the Aussie cricket team was all but unbeatable for quite a few years, and the Aussie fans got bored. I can relate to that. For reference, I'm a Kiwi."

rugbyunion,3doryh,shizzelez,2,Sat Jul 18 05:03:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, nah, mate.   Despite having good backs, Fiji struggle with tight play against higher ranked teams so are always going to find it difficult to establish a proper platform. Of particular concern is their difficulty in defending rolling mauls, especially from lineouts. I'd expect England to repeatedly exploit that.  There is hope though - New Zealand can't defend rolling mauls either. They conceded two tries at home against Argentina yesterday. Their coaching team don't know how to fix it so they're trying to whinge their way to a law change. I suppose they're nervous ahead of the World Cup. Though New Zealand are often the best team in the world, they've never won a World Cup away from home so it's understandable that they feel the need to stack the deck in their favour. If the Kiwis' unsporting attempt at cynical manipulation of the laws is successful, Fiji will benefit too.  This was an entertaining match though, which is what we should really be talking about on this thread isn't it?"
rugbyunion,3doryh,shizzelez,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:25:52 2015 UTC,But Argentina couldn't defend the All Blacks relentless line attack. You say that the ABs can't win a world cup away from home. I counter that with only the Springboks and the All Blacks have won at home.

Waisake Naholo has also been ruled out with a broken leg, while Lima Sopoaga, Colin Slade and Beauden Barrett will provide the options at first five.  The squad flies out to South Africa this morning, stopping over in Sydney before arriving in Johannesburg on Sunday evening. The All Blacks play South Africa at Emirates Airline (formerly Ellis) Park on Saturday 25 July.  All Blacks Head Coach Steve Hansen said: ""In deciding on the squad to travel to South Africa, the selectors based their selections on three criteria. Firstly, we have picked experienced players who are well aware of the challenge of playing South Africa at home.  Secondly, we want to give some other players the opportunity to see how they cope under the extreme pressure of playing South Africa; and thirdly, we took into consideration the fact that some players in the squad could do with having a break for various reasons, so they will be staying home to freshen up.""  All players who are remaining in New Zealand will be given individual training programmes to work on and will reassemble with the rest of squad in August and be available for selection for the Bledisloe Cup Tests."

rugbyunion,3dmzfc,michedlp,6,Fri Jul 17 17:20:14 2015 UTC,"Good bench option IMO... 2 reasons.  First, he has the experience at that level (code is irrelevant), he knows big-matches almost better than any of the fellas in the squad, so he can impart a lot of knowledge there. And he has the added bonus(in a weird way) of having lost a home-world cup... That's a lot of drive right there.  Also, sure, he's there officially as centre, but with him on the bench, you can have a 5-2 or 4-3 split, depending on how you look at it. Too many backs get fucked, throw him in the centres, too many forwards, throw him at 6.  There's a lot to be said for utility, look at our back 3 for starters..."

Luther Burrell is a similar race as Eatmond, yes, but he's got 20cm and 22kg on him - very hard to mix those two up.  Third: no need to be a aggressive about a simple mistake."
rugbyunion,3dmzfc,Chuckles1188,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:13:15 2015 UTC,Considering him as a flanker isn't THAT crazy since it is where he's played his best rugby since taking up the code. It's still not surprising that someone who isn't an expert in the setpiece is not being considered at blindside though. Frankly I'll be fairly surprised if he makes the final squad

However, perhaps more deserving centres have missed out because of this - Elliot Daly? And I won't be happy if Kyle Eastmond misses out for Burgess."

Now having Ford and JJ our attack is a lot smoother but less destructive (Burrell doesn't fill the manu hole). Saying that we've dealt fine without Manu.

I have a few mates that did some training sessions with him, and they said he was excellent!"
rugbyunion,3dm7ol,muelindustries,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:01:01 2015 UTC,I have trained with him as well actually. I still get called the nickname he gave me.
rugbyunion,3dm7ol,BullNiro,2,Mon Jul 20 02:12:07 2015 UTC,Well you can't say that and not tell what it is and the story?!
rugbyunion,3dm7ol,muelindustries,2,Mon Jul 20 02:19:17 2015 UTC,"Well, it was the second last year of high school and we had a training session with him. We were arguably the best team in the comp without scholarship players (so, 2nd best team, best team had a captain of the Australian Schoolboys) so we were all pretty good.  At the start of the session he asks my name and I was kinda nervous. Jones coached the Wallabies in the first World Cup I really watched them in and I thought he was the bees knees.  I don't know whether to say my first name or my last name, which is what I am called at school.  I blurt out my last name, kinda nervously, not very clearly. He says ""Alright Mori!""  One problem, ""Mori"" is not my name. I said it so unclearly he took a guess. And I am not stupid enough to try and correct Eddie Jones.   All of our best forward were also first VIII rowers (my year set Australian records) so compared to them I am a bit jockeyish. I am a 5'10"" fullback/winger/flanker kind of player.  It's a tackling drill on a cold morning, first drill of the day, we're all just waking up. A bit wet. Eddie is looking on slightly disapprovingly, it's the first session of the year but so far it's been a bit sluggish.  I want to impress him. So I decide whoever comes up I am going to lay a real tackle. Now I avoided our scrum half who was a kiwi and a bit of a psycho but I get the tallest of tall timber, a strong runner who knows how to stay up when someone tries to tackle him.  Good positioning is hard because his hips are so high and his strides so long. He can change speed well. He's running at me and I anticipate his change of direction.  I go in there and I angle it to hit him as hard as I can and pile him into the turf and land his face right in front of some dog shit. It was a good hit.  ""Look at Mori! Mori's got the right idea!"" Jones proclaims.  From then on I was Mori and whenever I do anything on the field (or in the pub, etc) my mates go ""Mori's got the right idea!""  I don't know if it's a good story but that's what happened."
rugbyunion,3dm7ol,BullNiro,2,Mon Jul 20 02:44:27 2015 UTC,That's a brilliant story and good nickname! I'd be proud if it were me!
rugbyunion,3dm7ol,muelindustries,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:47:18 2015 UTC,Ha! Cheers. Also should be mentioned he was pretty much exactly who I was expecting. He's an awesome guy.

rugbyunion,3dm64f,Johnkane46,2,Fri Jul 17 12:14:37 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of an Adidas style jersey, let's see how it looks when it's out.   Pros: Logos aren't too prominent or mis-aligned (eg. Canterbury logo on the previous light green Ireland jersey was at a weird angle). Dark blue stripes on normal blue looks nice, fading stripe design on the back, white shoulder/collar is new and could be interesting. Looks potentially slick.  Cons: Still no yellow, not even a small bit.  Other comments: It's not a radical change from the standard Canterbury design, but as far as change goes, it seems to be in the right direction. The previous season's home jersey just had nothing going on, no imagination whatsoever."
rugbyunion,3dm64f,aGingRKid,3,Fri Jul 17 12:40:57 2015 UTC,I get what you mean about the yellow. Last years ERC jersey was slick...  as long as we're not going back to those Leinster tops.

rugbyunion,3dleuw,small_far_away,3,Fri Jul 17 07:52:17 2015 UTC,That's some rugby 08 offloading!!
rugbyunion,3dleuw,bartiemorgan,3,Fri Jul 17 07:54:16 2015 UTC,What a pick up from Nonu
rugbyunion,3dleuw,gezaarr,3,Fri Jul 17 07:57:13 2015 UTC,they went for touch.  oh crap...
rugbyunion,3dleuw,ignarteaga,3,Fri Jul 17 07:58:05 2015 UTC,Well there was little chance in stopping that
rugbyunion,3dleuw,BlackYosh,3,Fri Jul 17 07:58:45 2015 UTC,Crowd going nuts after that. Great set piece move but the attack leading up to it was beautiful. That's more like it ABs!

rugbyunion,3dleuw,gezaarr,3,Fri Jul 17 08:08:03 2015 UTC,That's some fucking sexy counter rucking

rugbyunion,3dleuw,sebitapincha,3,Fri Jul 17 08:52:41 2015 UTC,Sub scrum-half for Argentina has made a difference. Much quicker off the base and gets them going forward.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,small_far_away,3,Fri Jul 17 08:56:14 2015 UTC,Holy shit that's gonna be something we need to work on. It's gonna be something World Cup opponents constantly hit us with.  Our maul defence is a joke.

rugbyunion,3dleuw,WallopyJoe,2,Fri Jul 17 07:50:56 2015 UTC,Nice tackle
rugbyunion,3dleuw,Mar7coda6,2,Fri Jul 17 07:52:52 2015 UTC,Naholo to score.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,Open-Collar,2,Fri Jul 17 07:53:23 2015 UTC,"So far, stream on that hotspot connexion across the street from the office is holding. Fingers crossed."

rugbyunion,3dleuw,plato44,2,Fri Jul 17 07:58:08 2015 UTC,Christ have the NZ wingers not boshed through a tackle yet?
rugbyunion,3dleuw,PatLook,2,Fri Jul 17 07:58:20 2015 UTC,"Rights boys (and girls) - I'm normally a league fan, but I've watched the first 20 mins, since I'm a kiwi and all, but I have to say this is the fastest Union game I've seen for a while. Are they all like this at the moment, or only the internationals? I didn't watch any of the super 12 this year, so this is an honest question."
rugbyunion,3dleuw,workingaroundit,8,Fri Jul 17 08:00:40 2015 UTC,"To be honest, this is a bit slow after watching the Super Rugby final the other week."
rugbyunion,3dleuw,small_far_away,7,Fri Jul 17 08:01:41 2015 UTC,this. I've seen faster. One of the springboks all blacks games where boks had to score a BP to try and win the rugby championship was the fastest international game I've seen
rugbyunion,3dleuw,small_far_away,3,Fri Jul 17 08:03:12 2015 UTC,"Saying that, Internationals tend to be more competitive and faster in general. But there are always exceptions, such as that Super Rugby final."
rugbyunion,3dleuw,workingaroundit,3,Fri Jul 17 08:05:42 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying, I guess when you are playing for country pride there must be a  mental thing going on there"
rugbyunion,3dleuw,Pukako,3,Fri Jul 17 08:09:31 2015 UTC,I've found super rugby to be the most even perhaps abnormally fast paced rugby union league in the world. Even compared to internationals. Stuff like breakdowns and scrums seem to be quicker in Super Rugby
rugbyunion,3dleuw,krnr,3,Fri Jul 17 08:13:24 2015 UTC,Yeah - AB's go for speed and as much precision as they can get.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,HymenHoarder,2,Fri Jul 17 08:01:32 2015 UTC,"i always was thinking that pre-bind in open play isn't allowed, is it?"
rugbyunion,3dleuw,richyeh,3,Fri Jul 17 08:03:18 2015 UTC,"If you bind from behind it's all good I think, right?"
rugbyunion,3dleuw,plato44,2,Fri Jul 17 08:06:35 2015 UTC,AB's seem a bit sloppy right now.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,I_am_LordHarrington,2,Fri Jul 17 08:03:19 2015 UTC,WTF?
rugbyunion,3dleuw,workingaroundit,2,Fri Jul 17 08:07:31 2015 UTC,The Argentine hooker looks like a really short version of Martin Johnson.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,small_far_away,2,Fri Jul 17 08:07:45 2015 UTC,Where was the support???

rugbyunion,3dleuw,cape7,2,Fri Jul 17 08:08:35 2015 UTC,Great counter rucking.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,Mar7coda6,2,Fri Jul 17 08:09:11 2015 UTC,"The All Blacks are only committing 2 players per ruck, just no space for the Argies"
rugbyunion,3dleuw,jeffrey2ks,2,Fri Jul 17 08:09:55 2015 UTC,That is a beautiful counter ruck
rugbyunion,3dleuw,EnjoyTheSauce,2,Fri Jul 17 08:10:23 2015 UTC,Can someone fill me in with the score I'm stuck waiting for a bus :(
rugbyunion,3dleuw,workingaroundit,2,Fri Jul 17 08:15:23 2015 UTC,11-6 ABs

rugbyunion,3dleuw,ThaFuck,2,Fri Jul 17 08:17:20 2015 UTC,11-6 ABs leading (38th min)
rugbyunion,3dleuw,BanGy,2,Fri Jul 17 08:17:31 2015 UTC,Nonu try on the bell. Carter slots it from the edge. 18-6 ht
rugbyunion,3dleuw,ignarteaga,2,Fri Jul 17 08:20:53 2015 UTC,Half time 18 - 6 AB's leading.

rugbyunion,3dleuw,night_dude,2,Fri Jul 17 08:19:16 2015 UTC,I think that klaxon has to be an advantage to the all blacks if they're used to it - it startled me and I'm not even there. Surprised they're allowed to get away with it
rugbyunion,3dleuw,cape7,2,Fri Jul 17 08:21:18 2015 UTC,"Prediction - Next week's back 3 will be Savea, Dagg and Smith with Naholo on the bench. We have 2 fullback/first fives to cover the other spot and surely Naholo and Dagg are earning it"
rugbyunion,3dleuw,adequateharpy1,3,Fri Jul 17 08:23:13 2015 UTC,Milner Skudder might get a run
rugbyunion,3dleuw,bobwinters,2,Fri Jul 17 08:25:27 2015 UTC,Joubert is quick on the whistle. He didn't get a chance to place the ball.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,gezaarr,2,Fri Jul 17 08:35:27 2015 UTC,I don't think it matters if he's not the tackler.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,small_far_away,2,Fri Jul 17 08:36:36 2015 UTC,How is Nonu taking taking these balls
rugbyunion,3dleuw,BlackYosh,2,Fri Jul 17 08:39:12 2015 UTC,Gift wrapped try there.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,bobwinters,2,Fri Jul 17 08:43:53 2015 UTC,One of the easier ones he'll ever score
rugbyunion,3dleuw,ignarteaga,2,Fri Jul 17 08:44:01 2015 UTC,Would not be surprised if that was a stray boot by Richie ;-).
rugbyunion,3dleuw,reggie_007,2,Fri Jul 17 08:44:29 2015 UTC,"Its 6 am, and we are trailing by 26 points.  It´s been a pleasure, but im gonna go to sleep..."

rugbyunion,3dleuw,PatLook,2,Fri Jul 17 08:51:53 2015 UTC,Great maul try there.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,pensivenoodles,2,Fri Jul 17 08:52:08 2015 UTC,"Awesome try. The refs must've been told recently to speed up the calls at the mauls? He said ""use it once"" literally straight away."

rugbyunion,3dleuw,small_far_away,2,Fri Jul 17 08:54:37 2015 UTC,What did the Pumas take at half time?!?
rugbyunion,3dleuw,SimilarSimian,10,Fri Jul 17 08:57:16 2015 UTC,Something that takes about 10 minutes to kick in...
rugbyunion,3dleuw,NaranPol,2,Fri Jul 17 08:57:41 2015 UTC,Argentina looking tired now.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,reggie_007,6,Fri Jul 17 09:05:28 2015 UTC,Creevy leaving made a notable difference.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,SimilarSimian,2,Fri Jul 17 09:09:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think he had a bit more in the tank."

rugbyunion,3dleuw,small_far_away,3,Fri Jul 17 08:59:29 2015 UTC,Awesome tries? From a maul...
rugbyunion,3dleuw,Pukako,5,Fri Jul 17 09:09:57 2015 UTC,That is a bit unfortunate for Argentina. Definitely think it was knocked on by the NZ 3
rugbyunion,3dleuw,bobwinters,2,Fri Jul 17 07:58:08 2015 UTC,For Fucks sake! Why are we still using Williams? Nonu has got too many hospital passes so far.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,someguyinbk,3,Fri Jul 17 08:12:53 2015 UTC,He had a very poor season. I doubt he will get much game time when they start picking their best squad.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,small_far_away,4,Fri Jul 17 08:15:17 2015 UTC,absolutely bullshit call playing the ball on the ground
rugbyunion,3dleuw,Littlerthanlittle,2,Fri Jul 17 08:15:02 2015 UTC,Yeah it confused me? Can I not dive on a ball on the ground and then pop it up to someone?
rugbyunion,3dleuw,small_far_away,3,Fri Jul 17 08:16:33 2015 UTC,He was already on the ground when he picked up the ball.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,Harlequin5,3,Fri Jul 17 08:18:45 2015 UTC,Ah right ok. That makes more sense.
rugbyunion,3dleuw,da_gan,3,Fri Jul 17 08:20:48 2015 UTC,Naholo is ridiculous. What a player

Personally, I once caught my own kick off and ran straight through to put down under the posts in a 7s match. Opening try of the game after approximately 12 seconds. It must have looked brilliant, but the sheen was somewhat removed from the feat because it transpired the opposition were both awful and very hungover; we ran about 10 tries past them during the 14 minutes. Still though, for 30 glorious seconds I felt like a proper world beater.  DISCLAIMER: I'm still not even sure if catching your own kickoff is legal, or if the ref had a shocker"

I have several tearing runs, big tackles, smashing hits with the ball in hand, and 1 try on the day. Lots of pats on the head at the end.  The best bit about it? I usually play wing/fullback."
rugbyunion,3dko6t,TheNinjaWarrior,2,Fri Jul 17 09:32:42 2015 UTC,"My first season playing at u16s, and I was a scrawny, unpromising winger who couldn't tackle, playing in a team who hadn't won a game all year, going into the penultimate match of the season. I was on the bench as we headed into another loss, 17-5 down with fifteen to play when the coach emptied the bench, seeing as it couldn't go any worse.  I came on for a scrum five. The number eight picked up and charged at me. I dropped him to ground, got back up to my feet then made a follow-up tackle on the scrum half. Our backrow got over the ball, won a penalty and we survived. My confidence began to grow, and I decided I was going roam and play some rugby. I'd been a pretty decent 7s player, and could step, and decided to play as I wanted to.  We got the ball in the 22. I ran an ark round onto the other wing, hitting a line, I handed off the winger and rode the fullback's tackle over the line. Our ten nailed the conversion. 17-12.  They played it short from the kick-off. Our scrum-half took it, and a prop stepped in at 9. He passed it to me on the short side, but I'd noticed we had numbers on the openside. I began to run across field, and joined our backline there, still with the ball, jinking past two of their on rushing tacklers.   I straightened up as this huge, hairy ginger number eight threw himself at me. He probably weight twenty stone and was built like a portaloo cabin. I was smashed but, as he hit me, transferred the ball into one hand and threw the best offload I have honestly ever seen. It flew perfectly horizontally, twenty yards, past all of their defenders and into the hands of our winger. Nobody noticed it happened, too focused on the tackle. By the time people saw, it was too late: We'd scored under the posts. 17-19.  The referee blows up for full time. My first win in rugby, and our first of the season. All thanks to me. It never got better than that."
rugbyunion,3dko6t,SquidgyGoat,2,Fri Jul 17 17:47:22 2015 UTC,"Best/worst moment: First time in a scrum (prop), about 3 weeks after I decided to try rugby, I caused 3 restarts because I didn't know you had to bind onto the opposing prop. Sir, ""have you ever been in a scrum before?"" Me, ""not against people."" I'd only practiced on the sled :-( .   Played the entire match and finished with a burst blood vessel in my eye due to improper breathing in scrums.   The coach likes to bring this up every time he's drunk."

rugbyunion,3diij9,Hitchhikingtom,20,Thu Jul 16 15:28:46 2015 UTC,"Recent History *In 2013 did well in the Pacific Nations Cup (beating Tonga, FIji and the US and losing a close one to Japan in the torrential rain.  Ran Ireland close for about 55 minutes and then the floodgates opened. *In 2014 lost an agonizingly close game against Scotland (with a very controversial red card leading to the winning penalty).  Fell to shambles for the rest of the year and lost games to the US, Japan, Samoa, Romania and an RFU Champions XV. All were pretty close, but that doesn't really cut it.   Team Composition *About 10 or so players play professionally in Europe (more on them later) *Many of the non Euro pros play on the 7s circuit *The balance are amateurs, coming mostly from the British Columbia teams (where they play a standard winter season), followed by Ontario (where they play in the summer because the pitches are unplayable from November through March.)  Notable Pros *Jeff Hassler - Ospreys wing.  all Pro 12 team in 2013/2014 season.  Was going very well until a season ending injury this year.  Fast & Hard.  *DTH Van der Merwe - Glasgow wing (moving to Newport).  Glasgow's all time top try scorer.  Likely to play at wing or inside centre for Canada.  Hard.  *Tyler Ardron - Ospreys second/back row (195 cm 111kg and mobile).  Can play lock, 6 or 8.  *Jamie Cudmore - Clermont 2nd row. a bit of an old warhorse.  Hard as a bag of nails that itself is made of nails. Prone to getting cards, you don't see much of him in the loose, but from what I hear he basically and slowly saps anyone's will to live in the tight over the course of a game.  Super good at punching people. *A number of players (largely tight 5 and back 3) play D2 rugby in England, France and NZ.     Set Up Assuming Ardron plays lock, a typical Canadian set up would be Tier 1/2 pros in the tight 5.  Amatur/7s back row, 7s based 9-13.  Very good wings, slowish fullback who can kick a ball into a peach basket from 50m.  They always give a good fight and can run a decent team close for about 55 minutes.  All the 7s skills in the backs can make them a bit fun to watch at times, and the boys up front love to have a bash..... Then the fitness differential sets in and the scoreline widens."

As aggravating as the whole situation is, the vast majority of supporters are excited to see him coming up, they're just aggravated with the whole mess surrounding it,which has been exacerbated by his agent and current manager, who I believe the ARU have told to shut up now.  He signed a very lucrative contract, him, or his agent, is now trying to renege on it.  In order to get the money for said contract the SRU had to let certain Glasgow players go.    Why then, should because he has suddenly has a change of mind and forgotten how contracts work, should he just be released from it and the SRU take the hit financially and Glasgow on the pitch.  In no walk of life would you sign a contract then change your mind without facing some kind of repercussions.   As it currently stands, the contract is for 3 years, he'll be in Glasgow for 3 years, unless some agreement between the unions is arranged."
rugbyunion,3dhfxk,RedNave,3,Fri Jul 17 01:50:46 2015 UTC,"He would be getting uncomfortable because he is having second thoughts for personal reasons and now the management and some fans are, with increasing fervour, insisting he play whether they like it or not:   As it currently stands, the contract is for 3 years, he'll be in Glasgow for 3 years,   That is bound to make things uncomfortable.  Contract obligations aside - would you really want him to play for Glasgow if he didn't want too?"
rugbyunion,3dhfxk,cubeyescube,2,Fri Jul 17 02:03:35 2015 UTC,I get that he has a young family to think of but surely the contract would/should have been discussed with his wife before he signed it?  Don't want him to be forced to stick with the contract but if he truly doesn't want to come anymore then compensation is probably due from the ARU. It is very likely that 2-3 players were released by Glasgow to fund the contract for Naiyaravoro so it would leave the club a bit buggered
rugbyunion,3dhfxk,KPATB,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:53:48 2015 UTC,"You don't want a guy skipping practices and dragging his bottom lip around for 3 years. Do you really think you can strong arm a player into playing for you and that will be a good thing for your team? Hes not likely to put the hard yards in or have any pride in the jersey.   Its a shitty situation, but if the ARU refuses to come to the party with any compensation, i don't think you'll want to force him either."
rugbyunion,3dhfxk,cape7,5,Fri Jul 17 09:41:53 2015 UTC,This really pisses me off as a Glasgow supporter. Why would you sign a contract and then try and renege on it!?! It's now pretty likely he'll be resented for trying to wriggle out of it and he'll be pissed off being made to come. Now after spending what's very likely to be a large amount of money they are very unlikely to get the best out of him.
rugbyunion,3dhfxk,WhiskyBluff,7,Thu Jul 16 10:39:18 2015 UTC,He has a young family and wants to stay with them. Seems like he didn't think it through. Can't really be angry with someone for changing their mind.
rugbyunion,3dhfxk,oncewerelawyers,4,Thu Jul 16 11:46:41 2015 UTC,I'll feel bad it he can't bring his family with him but his actions do not only affect him. It's entirely probable that certain players have had to leave Glasgow to pay his sizeable wage bill.
rugbyunion,3dhfxk,TheMeanderer,2,Thu Jul 16 13:17:00 2015 UTC,If he was worried about that why would you sign a 3 year contract?! Decisions have consequences he's an adult and should know better.
rugbyunion,3dhfxk,WhiskyBluff,6,Thu Jul 16 16:32:14 2015 UTC,"Unless sex education lied to me and babies are really brought by a stork in the middle of the night, I'm sure he was well aware that he had a young family when he signed the contract."
rugbyunion,3dhfxk,RedNave,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:13:12 2015 UTC,Now after spending what's very likely to be a large amount of money they are very unlikely to get the best out of him.   You guys should just let him go. Naiyaravoro isn't the smartest cookie and it's only his second year in top level sport. He made a mistake - or his agent talked him into it.  If he doesn't want to go then don't make him go. A player can't play well if he resents being put in an untenable contract position.
rugbyunion,3dhfxk,cubeyescube,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:17:07 2015 UTC,"You guys should just let him go.   And play with only one winger then this season?  Interesting tactic.   Naiyaravoro isn't the smartest cookie    Ignorance is never an excuses.  His agent should of advised him better and what he was getting into, but it seems they were more interested in trying to get more money.   A player can't play well if he resents being put in an untenable contract position.   And we resent being put into the position where we have now lost 2 key players to fund this move, and now are being told by people to let it go."

rugbyunion,3dhfxk,pickledpeas,2,Thu Jul 16 12:48:33 2015 UTC,"Townsend said this in the signing article-  ""We look forward to him joining us at the end of the season and we know he'll be with us regardless of any international commitments.”"
rugbyunion,3dhfxk,KPATB,2,Thu Jul 16 12:57:14 2015 UTC,"Nothing was ever officialy stated as far as I'm aware, but when the SRU offer someone a 3 year contract you can more or less assume its with an eye on getting them a Scottish cap."
rugbyunion,3dioja,Humperdink34,11,Thu Jul 16 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"I think his hype is justified. He may not seem to be as dangerous as he once was, but that's because the world has become aware of his danger. He's creating more try and break assists by his drawing power on attack.   His kicking was very lack lustre in 2014, but he's worked on it immeasurably this season. I think the opposition will be surprised to see him breaking off way more distance for touch in the RC.   Defence is the only real question. We've never really seen all that much one-on-one. But I think he covers what needs to be done. He's just not an aggressive defender.   Also, I used to panic when the high ball went up to our fullback. I don't even flinch when he's under it. Mostly I just think the opposition are stupid for kicking it to him when he's, in my opinion, the best in the world at catching it.   All in all, I think there are more traditional all round fullbacks in the game (Le Roux, Smith, Halfpenny come to mind.) But I wouldn't trade any of them for the spark and excitement Folau brings."
rugbyunion,3dioja,dr_chim_richaldz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:32:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said, he has become such a good playmaker for other guys as he now draws 3 defenders as soon as he gets the ball, he almost never is tackled cleanly and almost always manages to get an offload away and is the best player I have ever seen under the high ball its not even close.  The few downsides are his kicking and the fact that he seems to almost always step back inside and doesn't have much of an outside move.  Defensively I'd say he is average but isn't a liability.  All in all like you said not the most well rounded player, but ball in hand he's the best player on the planet IMO."
rugbyunion,3dioja,ObiWanCobi,6,Fri Jul 17 14:22:44 2015 UTC,"He has the best aerial game out of anyone, seriously unreal under the high ball, and is a good runner, but I don't think he's the most well rounded player out there. I'd have Ben Smith in my team over Folau for sure. Or maybe just play Folau on the wing and have both!"
rugbyunion,3dioja,NZGrade,6,Thu Jul 16 23:52:01 2015 UTC,No.
rugbyunion,3dioja,BHHooker,8,Thu Jul 16 20:05:13 2015 UTC,"Probably not the most informed as I don't watch too much Super Rugby but in my opinion he's a brilliant carrier and runner with the ball, got a great step, speed and strong too. He's also great under the high ball as far as I can tell due to his AFL background.   However, he's a poor kicker. As a fullback really this should be your strength or at least one of your main attributes. This means teams can pin him back and he'll always try to run back, which can end up with individual brilliance but a good defence should shut him down and gain huge metres.  So in my opinion he's not overrated as an attacking player but overrated as a fullback if that makes sense. Didn't he make his debut at 14? Seems he'd be better suited there. Or are Australia's only other 15 options Mogg, Beale, O'Connor and Mitchell? Who understandably may have Aussie fans wishing them away from the first XV.  (Apologies for any typos etc. wrote this on my phone)"
rugbyunion,3dioja,captain_cabinets2,6,Thu Jul 16 17:14:05 2015 UTC,"I think that they play him at fullback because he can create more of a surprise for the opposition defence. He also drags attention which creates space around him for the others. He's the competition leader or co-leader in: line breaks, runs, tackle busts, run meters per game and offloads. These stats speak for themselves. Source  In defence I don't see him missing tackles but I don't have stats on that. As you said the other options are Mogg and Beale that are not reliable in defence, O'Connor who's not having a great season and Mitchell who is on form. I think that his ability under the high ball puts him ahead."
rugbyunion,3dioja,fettsack,4,Thu Jul 16 17:30:44 2015 UTC,"I agree--it seems to me that they line him up at 15 because it allows him the freedom to attack from anywhere on the field. He's great at patiently following a play until it's time for him to get the ball, and then bam. He hits the gap and it's try time"
rugbyunion,3dioja,Smoky-Indo,3,Thu Jul 16 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"He was the best in the air in the entire NRL when he played there, and that is a sport geared towards spectacular catches on the last tackle in the try-zone.   He was rubbish at AFL funnily enough."

rugbyunion,3dioja,cubeyescube,8,Thu Jul 16 22:59:16 2015 UTC,Great on attack. Average on defense. Doesn't read the game too well and often finds himself caught out of position.
rugbyunion,3dioja,batzman,3,Thu Jul 16 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"No. While hes an average kicker, hes such an outstanding runner of the ball that teams don't want to kick to him. Unless you have your chasing line absolutely perfect, he will run it back with interest.   He can tear any defence apart like few other players in the world can, thats enough to warrant the hype"
rugbyunion,3dioja,cape7,3,Thu Jul 16 21:24:10 2015 UTC,He is a wing playing at fullback.   The territory game will be Australia's Achilles heel.
rugbyunion,3dioja,bakwan,6,Fri Jul 17 01:40:57 2015 UTC,"I think he's a very good player but would be better suited being at 11. As a Kiwi, I wouldn't even consider trading him for Ben Smith. Maybe Dagg."
rugbyunion,3dioja,Rand0mNZ,2,Thu Jul 16 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"Depends whose rating you're going by. Personally, I think he's an absolutely brilliant fullback, though his kicking could do with a bit of work."
rugbyunion,3dioja,savois-faire,2,Thu Jul 16 19:49:24 2015 UTC,"As a fullback? Yes. As a wing? Fuck no, if anything the opposite"
rugbyunion,3dioja,Chuckles1188,3,Thu Jul 16 20:25:39 2015 UTC,It's hard for him to get enough space on the wing to make the most of the fact that he's the best open field runner in the game
rugbyunion,3dioja,ozwozzle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:07:00 2015 UTC,"So get a better fly half who can move teams around the pitch and get the ball where it needs to be when the space appears, don't shoehorn him into the wrong position to give him a better highlight reel"
rugbyunion,3dioja,Chuckles1188,2,Fri Jul 17 09:04:04 2015 UTC,Or we can just work around the fact that he doesn't have a brilliant boot and keep letting him be a headache in all the open space he gets as a fullback
rugbyunion,3dioja,ozwozzle,0,Fri Jul 17 09:19:41 2015 UTC,"Open space that has been created by having the ball booted deep into your territory. The thing is it does look great sticking him in open space and letting him counterattack but all it's doing is getting you back to where you were before you lost possession. Stick Beale at fullback, he's a solid runner and has a good boot. Stick Folau on the wing, have Kuridrani break the line and then straighten and put Folau through. It will produce a lot more tries than having Folau run it out of his 22"
rugbyunion,3dioja,Chuckles1188,2,Fri Jul 17 09:49:55 2015 UTC,"He started on the wings and he wasn't getting enough ball, and when he was only a fraction of the time did he have enough space to work his magic. He's scored like 15 tries off the 30 odd games we've had him at fullback, that's not too bad.."
rugbyunion,3dioja,ozwozzle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:31:33 2015 UTC,"And in his 5 tests on the wing he scored 3 tries, which is a better strike rate (although admittedly it's also tough to extrapolate from it given such a small number of games). How much ball he gets is not as important as a) what he does when he does get it and b) why he is getting it"
rugbyunion,3dioja,Chuckles1188,2,Fri Jul 17 12:07:07 2015 UTC,It's so simple when you put it like that. You'd better get on the phone to Cheika. I'm pretty sure he hasn't thought about any of that.
rugbyunion,3dioja,krakkerz,2,Fri Jul 17 10:32:42 2015 UTC,"I would say he's not the best tactical kicker, but that's not why he's considered a good player. He runs great support lines and is always in position to score tries. I think most people know what to expect from his game"

His offense is very good, he has great speed and an awesome step, but evidently his kicks are average at best.  Obviously they don't play him as a traditional fullback but as an offensive running threat. He also lead in offloads this year which means he can draw defenders to him and keep the play going."

The Wallabies did it a few times from my memory, as I'm told did the Welsh.  It really typifies the professional/amateur crossover of the mid to late 90's where defensive structures were still not up to the standard as attack, but a lot of set play was being experimented on in very imaginative ways, particularly in Australia and New Zealand - see also.  Remember once seeing the All Blacks use Lomu as halfback in one scrum close to the line, and George Gregan lifting in the lineouts. Rarely see that kind of thing happen these days!"

rugbyunion,3dg3ur,SquidgyGoat,19,Thu Jul 16 01:11:19 2015 UTC,Not even Aussie but really hoping it works
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,FourFiveSeven,11,Thu Jul 16 01:16:22 2015 UTC,"Even though Genia and Cooper have done absolutely nothing for the past two years, while in 2014 and 2015 Foley has dominated the stats amongst super rugby five eighths for nearly every facet of the game?"
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,peteav,12,Thu Jul 16 04:25:46 2015 UTC,I've never seen a player play himself out of instant selection like Foley did in the semi.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,DoctorDbx,10,Thu Jul 16 04:40:11 2015 UTC,Phipps too. That first pass. Jesus.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,warbastard,4,Thu Jul 16 04:52:07 2015 UTC,"Amongst the four five eighths in the semis, Foley was =1st in try assists, 2nd in metres ran, 2nd in carries, 2nd in defenders beaten, 3rd in missed tackles, kicked 4 of 4 penalties and had a pinpoint cross field kick to put Horne in. He also completely outplayed Quade in the reds v tahs game a few weeks before.   Foley wasn't left out on form by the way, he's still the first choice five eight."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,peteav,4,Thu Jul 16 06:16:28 2015 UTC,"completely outplayed Quade in the reds v tahs game a few weeks before.   It's not hard to outplay an opposing 10 when the rest if their team crumbles around them. Not really a fair measure.    That being said though, even though Foley had a shocker against the Highlanders, I think he's hard done by, but will most likely get a call up for the All-Blacks..."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,projone,5,Thu Jul 16 07:22:30 2015 UTC,"Foley hasn't been hard done by, there is a reason the media hasn't made a big deal of this, its to give Quade a full game to show where he is at."

rugbyunion,3dg3ur,sdre,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:30:08 2015 UTC,Reds forward pack hasn't been great for Genia. I think in France we will see just how good he is.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,BullNiro,2,Thu Jul 16 05:12:13 2015 UTC,vs Pienaar/Pollard/de Allande. Should be riveting.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,ruggeryoda,16,Thu Jul 16 08:26:20 2015 UTC,"James Slipper - (Reds - 63 Tests) Stephen Moore, C - (Brumbies - 92 Tests) Sekope Kepu (Waratahs - 52 Tests) Will Skelton (Waratahs - 8 Tests) Rob Simmons (Reds - 50 Tests) Scott Fardy (Brumbies - 20 Tests) Michael Hooper, VC - (Waratahs 42 Tests) Scott Higginbotham (Rebels -31 Tests) Will Genia (Reds - 58 Tests) Quade Cooper (Reds - 53 Tests) Rob Horne (Waratahs 25 Tests) Matt Giteau (Toulon - 92 Tests) Tevita Kuridrani (Brumbies - 20 Tests) Adam Ashley-Cooper, VC - (Waratahs - 104 Tests) Israel Folau (Waratahs - 29 Tests)   Reserves   Tatafu Polota-Nau (Waratahs - 50 Tests) Scott Sio (Brumbies - 5 Tests) Greg Holmes (Reds - 13 Tests) James Horwill (Reds - 58 Tests) David Pocock (Brumbies - 46 Tests) Nick Phipps (Waratahs - 28 Tests) Matt Toomua (Brumbies 21 Tests) Drew Mitchell (Toulon - 63 Caps)   I'm happy enough with that side for this game. Clearly some degree of experimentation, and I think we will see quite a lot of rotation in the coming games to work out combinations etc. I think this side is a long way away from the team that will run out against England in October."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,Bangkok_Dave,15,Thu Jul 16 02:07:51 2015 UTC,5/3 bench split is interesting - probably means we'll be attempting to run the Boks around in a fast-paced game.  Phipps and (to be brutally honest) Horwill are lucky to be there given recent form.  Phipps is double lucky that Stirzaker isn't in the squad given his last game against the Highlanders.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,GreatJusticeForSGU,7,Thu Jul 16 00:37:19 2015 UTC,I don't agree with that Horwill pick at all!
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,Thatreallyjusthappen,10,Thu Jul 16 00:42:05 2015 UTC,I'm on the fence. I think a lot of Horwill's issues this year at the Reds were clearly because he didn't want to be there. Let's see if a change in environment and coach sparks something.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,DoctorDbx,14,Thu Jul 16 00:48:57 2015 UTC,"Where Horwill gets a leg up on other potential reserve locks is in the set piece. He is one of a few locks we have who can manage the tight head side at test level. Skelton couldn't last year, but I think will this year. Arnold is untried there and plays mostly on the left, IIRC.  Horwill is also a very good lineout jumper. You just need to see this year's SR stats to see that. He is also a capable caller and can do the role seamlessly when Simmons isn't there.  Most of the time, your 4 is your main lineout guy and your 5 is your scrummager. Along with the likes of Matfield and O'Connell, Horwill is one of the very few who can be both at test level. So, while he's somewhat out of form, those things keep him in touch with the squad."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,krakkerz,12,Thu Jul 16 01:45:17 2015 UTC,Get that logic and reason out of here! He didn't get a 100m try every game so he's literally the worst player in the world now.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,WaterPokemon,7,Thu Jul 16 03:40:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry. I forgot where I was for a minute there.  Bloody Horwill, why would we pick him? Should have picked Naiyaravoro at lock. He's big and scores tries. That's all there is to it, right?  :)"
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,krakkerz,2,Thu Jul 16 05:03:14 2015 UTC,Fingers crossed that will be the case! I'm so happy Giteau is back as well. Really excited to see how he performs.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,Thatreallyjusthappen,5,Thu Jul 16 01:44:23 2015 UTC,I really expected to see a 6-2 split with two locks. It seems Cheika is looking for a fast paced game. I'm interested to see how this works.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,krakkerz,11,Thu Jul 16 03:17:08 2015 UTC,"This is a strong team IMHO. We're a real chance here if this team can click. On paper, it's very attacking."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,DoctorDbx,8,Thu Jul 16 00:49:56 2015 UTC,We're a real chance here if this team can click.   The Australian TAB has the Wallabies at $1.55 and the Boks at $2.45 head to head.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,plato44,12,Thu Jul 16 00:59:29 2015 UTC,Jesus. Don't trust those odds. I'd say the Boks have had the edge against the Wallabies lately.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,warbastard,14,Thu Jul 16 01:28:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not much of a gambler, but the Springboks at $2.45? I'd buy that."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,MasterEk,3,Thu Jul 16 01:36:16 2015 UTC,$1.62 and $2.20 on the NZ TAB...
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,plato44,7,Thu Jul 16 01:44:34 2015 UTC,The Boks have a horrendous record in Brisbane from memory and it was one each home and away last year. I'm not throwing money at the Wallabies until the RWC.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,plato44,3,Thu Jul 16 01:42:53 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the last time the boks won up here, it'd be years."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,capt_dacca,3,Thu Jul 16 02:09:52 2015 UTC,I can.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,GreatJusticeForSGU,4,Thu Jul 16 03:32:16 2015 UTC,I won't ever forget that. I was there! Ewen's first game as coach as well.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,warbastard,2,Thu Jul 16 04:53:15 2015 UTC,"It was very recently.   But prior to that, it was in the 70s (which was partly due to apartheid but let's not let that get in the way of the story)."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,gentleben88,3,Thu Jul 16 07:21:12 2015 UTC,"Looks like the odds are judged on SA's Super Rugby form. But the foreign stars are back and previous form (even if it was almost a year ago) you'd have to be backing the Boks, or at least not have odds that stacked."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,snomanDS,3,Thu Jul 16 02:08:52 2015 UTC,"Betfair (UK) had Boks at 2.76. Just taken some of that action. Gives me some reason to cheer one of the teams on I guess!   I shall source some biltong and say ""ja"" as much as possible and get right into the spirit."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,Morfee,2,Thu Jul 16 02:49:17 2015 UTC,I hope you didn't put your house on it. The Boks have won once at Lang Park/Suncorp.

rugbyunion,3dg3ur,blindside06,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:17:21 2015 UTC,"While I think/hope we get up, those odds have to look good to anyone taking SA on form."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,krakkerz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:46:46 2015 UTC,If anything it's a damning indictment of the Boks.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,BullNiro,14,Thu Jul 16 01:49:56 2015 UTC,I think we all need to take off our hats to David Pocock who has managed a stunning return to Test Rugby.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,QuadeCooper,2,Thu Jul 16 02:07:43 2015 UTC,"Holmes too, 7 years (I think) between drinks and to be in the fold for the wallabies again is pretty impressive."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,projone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:07:30 2015 UTC,Damn right.  That guy is a bloody menace.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,I_will_remember_this,7,Thu Jul 16 08:25:04 2015 UTC,I suspect he'll be giving everyone in the squad a run over the next couple of weeks. Hard to read anything in to these teams
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,strewthcobber,6,Thu Jul 16 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"I think this is a really good team. I personally would have liked to see Tomane or Mitchell starting (or both with AAC bench), and obviously Pocock in for Hooper. However, World Cup time is approaching so we just gotta trust in Cheika and get behind the boys.   Carn Wallabies!!!  Edit: Horwill I don't like, but I imagine it's to give him the option of keeping the set-piece together while playing Hooper and Pocock and benching Skelton after 60 mins or so."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,jbarbz,3,Thu Jul 16 01:04:48 2015 UTC,Pocock coming on with 30-20 minutes remaining will be devastating to the other team. I think anyways.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,Thatreallyjusthappen,18,Thu Jul 16 03:53:19 2015 UTC,"Pocock coming on with 80 minutes remaining would be devastating to the other team. I think Hooper is the better impact sub, kinda like Beauden Barrett. A world class player worthy of being in a world XV, but even more valuable coming on from the bench."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,jbarbz,4,Thu Jul 16 04:07:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed - he's a better runner of the ball so he can inject his pace into a tired defense, while Poey would be better to start in order to establish dominance at ruck time."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,Floee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:40:29 2015 UTC,100% agree.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,sdre,6,Thu Jul 16 06:30:54 2015 UTC,Stoked to see Pocock return!
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,ReindeerFl0tilla,5,Thu Jul 16 01:32:27 2015 UTC,Genia and Cooper in the halves?  Perfect chance to use this pic http://i.imgur.com/BO7rmKK.jpg
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,blindside06,9,Thu Jul 16 04:16:42 2015 UTC,"Gah - Mitchell over Tomane? That's a bad choice in my opinion. Tomane's had a great season and is a very hungry player.  Horwill over Arnold/Mumm? Horwill must be great in camp, I suppose."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,cubeyescube,7,Thu Jul 16 00:54:48 2015 UTC,I think what your forgetting is that this game is going to be used as a trial by Cheika. Too not give Mitchell a chance after we grabbed him from France would be ridiculous. Even if Mitchell plays well Tomane will get a go during the rugby championship i reckon.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,Casentwho,4,Thu Jul 16 02:44:06 2015 UTC,"I think Horne and AAC are such knowns at test level that he should have given Mitchell and Tomane chances to prove they are a level above. If they fail to fire, we can easily go back to the tried and true in Horne and AAC. Though Tomane has had plenty of chances before this year."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,jbarbz,7,Thu Jul 16 01:06:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe what Cheika and co. are going for is consistency and maturity first and foremost, then use that as the standard instead to build a team around instead of purely physical abilities, as we may have been guilty of in previous years. Goes to explaining Horwill's selection.  It means the backline can play a bit more intelligently. Sudden running backline moves off regular run-of-play ball was a part of the Wallabies great strengths in our golden era, but for that you need very disciplined players with good game sense."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,cubeyescube,4,Thu Jul 16 02:33:17 2015 UTC,"you need very disciplined players with good game sense.   More to the point, you need a forward pack that doesn't get assfucked."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,ya_y_not,2,Thu Jul 16 02:48:54 2015 UTC,Yep. Jones and Connolly didn't do enough to get the forwards up to scratch (though we produce a shitload of great flankers) and we have been paying for it ever since.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,BullNiro,4,Thu Jul 16 05:15:39 2015 UTC,Agreed Tomane has been playing out of his skin.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,QuadeCooper,3,Thu Jul 16 01:27:31 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised to see Mitchell on trial at fullback
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,shulzi,6,Thu Jul 16 04:04:22 2015 UTC,"Mitchell doesn't have to be the best utility back, just has to be better than Beale."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,DoctorDbx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:19:51 2015 UTC,Exactly
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,shulzi,3,Thu Jul 16 06:18:28 2015 UTC,Interesting side. Gotta get behind it. I wonder if Chieks doesn't want to show his strongest hand to the Boks in case we come second in the pool.  I will wait to judge it until I feel like I know what he's up to.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,BullNiro,2,Thu Jul 16 01:51:49 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I think I can see Cheika's thinking with the backs bench... Hear me out...    9, 10 & 12.  Phipps for Genia (No brainer), Cooper gets injured/subbed - changes with Toomua and Giteau moves to 10, alternatively Toomua subs for Giteau.   Then again, I've had a bit to drink."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,projone,2,Thu Jul 16 07:28:40 2015 UTC,Good luck lads I hope you go good.  I hope you fire on all fucken cylinders mates so we can have a cracker semi final in the world cup.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,bigstee,2,Thu Jul 16 10:16:51 2015 UTC,I'd say the run on side is about 80% correct.   Picks I don't agree with: Skelton Hooper Horne Kepu  I know that sounds anti-Waratahs but I believe the better picks would be: That guy from the Rebels over Skelton (can't remember his name this second) Pocock Tomane Holmes (but he's on the bench so that's an improvement)
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,warbastard,6,Thu Jul 16 01:33:58 2015 UTC,"I suspect you mean Jones. If that's the case, he's a left lock/lineout guy. The scrum at Test level requires a right lock who is primarily a scrummager. Skelton has developed into that.   With that said, I think Jones should have been in all the squads in front of Dennis and Mumm and might have been worth the shot instead of Simmons (who I rate very highly, BTW)."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,krakkerz,4,Thu Jul 16 01:50:12 2015 UTC,"that's a bit of a flog, Hooper and Pocock are 6 of 1 half a dozen the other. They just bring different perks. we have no-one capable of matching the physicality of the Boks and AB's bar Skelton, especially if you include Rob Simmons lack of impact everywhere. maybe Tomane for Horne pretty muh bring the same stuff but Horne has been the most consistent Australian Winger over the last 2 seasons. Kepu isn't even negotiable, he's so far ahead of the rest of our tightheads it's not funny. If Jones was competing with anyone it was Simmons as he has a similar game."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,darthreallynasty,4,Thu Jul 16 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"I thought Simmons was ordinary this year until I read this article and just saw how valuable he was. I think Skelton is definitely needed against the boks but I would contend with your phrase that Simmons lacks impact ""everywhere"". He is definitely needed to match the boks at set piece time. We also need someone to hit rucks if we are going to play both Hooper and Higginbotham in a back row. Simmons hit more than 10 rucks per game more than every other second rower (his 34 to everyone else 18-22) in aus this year. Luke Jones does a lot of running as does Hooper, Higgingbotham and Skelton. So for this lineup (and almost any lineup), Simmons with his set piece and ruck work should be a lock-in. If you had Palu or McCalman in for Higgers (who I think tend to hit more rucks), you could afford a more running second row in Jones (who hit an average of 17 per game - half of what Simmons does).  Edit: I think the selected second row combination is good but Jones should definitely be in the squad, even the bench."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,jbarbz,5,Thu Jul 16 04:01:11 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear. There are different ways to use players and Simmons is used as a traditional left lock. His lineout skill is superb and his main function in attack during the EOYT was to clear rucks, which he did very well.   During that tour, he stole 9% of the lineouts he faced *, as well (that is an absolutely astounding statistic at that level) and disrupted the opposition ball at least that again - perhaps twice as much. Plus, he is a very competent maul defender - especially in sacking the lineout jumper. In fact, between him sacking and Skelton reaching the carrier, I'm sure our maul defence will be sorted.  He's a player who is happy to concentrate on clearing rucks to secure the ball in attack, make his tackles in defence and command a very, very good lineout.  While I wouldn't say he's necessarily at the same level, those of a certain age will remember someone else who did those things, we called him 'Nobody' and made him a national hero.   *- Subject to a very basic ffwded review of the matches and some maths. Don't shoot me if it's not exactly spot on."
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,krakkerz,3,Thu Jul 16 04:55:55 2015 UTC,Horwill is also no slouch at maul defence.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,DoctorDbx,0,Thu Jul 16 05:18:28 2015 UTC,Keep Horne get rid of AAC
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,Coffee12345,3,Thu Jul 16 10:15:48 2015 UTC,That guy does not pass the ball that often that is true but I admire AAC for being able to get tackled and take his medicine. Sometimes our backs shovel shit ball on to someone else to deal with before thinking of going to ground and recycling it.
rugbyunion,3dg3ur,warbastard,0,Thu Jul 16 11:07:28 2015 UTC,"Get rid of AAC, rather have Tomane or Speight"

rugbyunion,3dhen5,YuukuRyougan,7,Thu Jul 16 09:03:56 2015 UTC,"He's just signed for Sale, from Racing Metro."
rugbyunion,3dhen5,wherethefisWallace,4,Thu Jul 16 09:17:48 2015 UTC,He's been at Racing and not hugely happy for the last season - has been on the bench consistently despite being in the best shape of his life. He's been missing Northampton/Franklin's Gardens/England and now finally has an opportunity to come back to play for Sale.   I for one will be excited to see him playing around the country - hopefully he'll be at the stoop at some point.
rugbyunion,3dhen5,Omblae,3,Thu Jul 16 13:10:42 2015 UTC,I'll definitely make the effort to head to the Stoop for him.

Going to be weird seeing him play in the Prem again for a side that isn't the Saints, but I hope he goes well at Sale - he'll always we welcome at the Gardens."

rugbyunion,3djnjx,plato44,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:26:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Lots on the line for the Wallabies in terms of form and the lack of game time is not helping. Springboks are expected to win from and SA perspective and the Wallabies need a win to give momentum. An away loss of the Springboks wouldn't be the end of the world but would be a good positive step, if the won, on to the RWC."
rugbyunion,3djnjx,SAGuy90,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:28:51 2015 UTC,"I dunno how much i agree with this article. They author seems to put a lot of emphasis on the wallabies not having test experience this year even though it is our most experienced side in years. Yes the Springboks got an early game in versing the World XV, but is that more effective than just having an extra week of training? Hard to say, imo. The Wallabies are tipped to win, and i think given the performance of SA teams in the Super Rugby this year, that's understandable.  I think the Wallabies will win comfortably at suncorp this weekend. It's pretty close to the team i would have picked, though truthfully I don't know a whole lot about the South African team. I guess if the Wallabies get stomped i'll eat my own socks  EDIT: It's probably important to note that in terms of Rugby this year, this test only serves the purpose of ""testing"" our players before the World Cup. The team we are fielding this weekend probably won't be the team we field in the World Cup, so either win or lose we will learn a lot from this game. I can't express how much i am looking forward to watching Test Rugby again. Good Luck to both teams :)"

rugbyunion,3dj334,lapsuscalumni,13,Thu Jul 16 17:58:47 2015 UTC,The Australian Rugby Union recently implemented 'Giteau's Law' Meaning that although most players playing abroad are not allowed to play for the Wallabies there is an exception for players who have: Played 60+ tests for the Wallabies and previously held an ARU contract for 7 years.
rugbyunion,3dj334,HyphyBurrito,3,Thu Jul 16 18:24:03 2015 UTC,Ahhhh ok cheers
rugbyunion,3dj334,fettsack,7,Thu Jul 16 18:35:36 2015 UTC,Same exception applies to Drew Mitchell who's also been called back by the Wallabies

rugbyunion,3dj334,orbit123,-13,Fri Jul 17 00:45:04 2015 UTC,"He was born in Australia, therefore he is allowed to play for he Australian national side....."
rugbyunion,3dj334,savois-faire,7,Thu Jul 16 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"Are you completely ignorant of the ARU's rules, or are you attempting a joke?"
rugbyunion,3dj334,orbit123,-12,Thu Jul 16 19:47:18 2015 UTC,http://www.theroar.com.au/2015/04/22/breaking-overseas-players-to-be-eligible-for-wallabies-selection/  So looks like you must be the one completely ignorant of the ARU's rules.
rugbyunion,3dj334,savois-faire,9,Thu Jul 16 19:51:24 2015 UTC,"That you're not eligible to play for the Australian national side if you play for a club that isn't in Australia..   If you move to a club abroad, you give up your eligibility to play for Australia. England and a number of other countries have the same rule. Now, Australia has changed the rule slightly so that some players playing abroad, like Giteau, will be eligible for the Wallabies.   They basically added an exception to the rule for players who have played in Australia professionally for 7 years or more, and have played a certain amounts of test matches for the Wallabies."
rugbyunion,3dj334,orbit123,-11,Thu Jul 16 20:04:50 2015 UTC,The main factor that makes him eligible is hat he was born in Australia.....
rugbyunion,3dj334,savois-faire,7,Thu Jul 16 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"The main thing that makes him eligible now (like, what OP was inquiring after), despite not being eligible under the previously held ARU policy, is that the ARU changed it's rules on overseas players, as you can see in the link you provided when you edited your previous comment to completely change what it said. From the article:   The Australian Rugby Union has announced a major overhaul in its player contracting policy, with elite players based overseas to remain eligible for Wallabies selection. Announced today, and effective immediately, players who have appeared in over 60 Test matches for Australia and have had a contract with Australian Rugby for seven seasons will remain eligible for Wallabies selection, even if they are plying their trade overseas.   The reason Giteau is eligible now is because of the ""major overhaul in player contracting policy"", which was (as I said in my previous comment) the fact that ""players who have appeared in over 60 Test matches for Australia and have had a contract with Australian Rugby for seven seasons"" (that was in the part where I said ""They basically added an exception to the rule for players who have played in Australia professionally for 7 years or more, and have played a certain amounts of test matches for the Wallabies"")."
rugbyunion,3dj334,orbit123,-10,Thu Jul 16 20:19:31 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, OP could have typed his exact question in to google and had the correct answer instantly.   Enjoy your 34 down votes, fool."
rugbyunion,3dj334,orbit123,-14,Thu Jul 16 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"The OP new mentioned anything about being eligible now.... And no, my edit was for a spelling mistake. So hardly completely changing what it said...."
rugbyunion,3dj334,savois-faire,7,Thu Jul 16 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"Given the fact that this was recently changed, and that the post is obviously in light of that, you know as well as anyone that OP asked because he heard about Giteau being picked up for the Wallabies and wasn't aware of the change in policy (as evidenced in the rest of this thread), so don't be deliberately childish about it.  And your comment before originally said ""and what rules would that be?"" rather than what it says now (which is fairly obvious when you look at my reply to your comment, as it clearly doesn't match what you changed it to be), and you know that as well as I do, so don't be deliberately childish about it.   Do enjoy the rest of your day, and expect no further responses from me."

We witnessed glimpses of it in this previous 6N but they have to this point lacked the consistency. Home advantage George Ford is the second coming.    Reason why they will not:   Youth team with a distinct lack of experience that will be telling against teams packed full of players that have already played in WC's, where the stakes are much higher and pressure is more telling.  Many believe we haven't hit our potential yet, but maybe this is as good as it gets?   N.B. Despite what happens this year, 2019 will be England's year."

rugbyunion,3dd3c6,IIICXMCM,9,Wed Jul 15 10:32:28 2015 UTC,"Our pack is awesome, for sure. I don't worry too much about Ford or Farrell, although each of their strengths are the others weakness. Brown I'm not worried about either (I mean, I'm a Quins fan so I've been watching him for around 10 years anyway.) Youngs I'm never quite convinced by, if he keeps a level head we'll be ok, but if makes snap decisions as he often does, we could be scuppered.   Watson and May (or Yarde, or Nowell, take your pick really) should be fine, the centres are the big question mark for me. They all play well on their day, but I have no idea which pairing is best or which will actually turn up come the WC."
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,Spitfire221,7,Wed Jul 15 11:16:58 2015 UTC,"The centre pairing I like the most from the ones currently possible would be JJ with Barritt on the inside. We're definitely not in a shortage for quality there, but getting a good pairing is key above all else when it comes to centres. I liked Burrell + JJ at the 6N, but I think Barritt is comparable to Burrell in playing style, and a fair tad better at the moment.   Slade, Daly, and Eastmond are perfectly good options as well, of course, but the pairing that I imagine working best would be Barritt + JJ. Oh, and there's 36 as well.. I always forget about 36.."

See our attacking play against France in last game of 6N as well as us out muscling teams in the past with our physicality.  2) Home advantage. We have beaten New Zealand at Twickenham, this should mean that mentally the team should not be afraid of anyone coming here to play us.  3) Our forward pack should rival any other in the world. Especially with potentially the best international lock pairing back fit - Launchbury and Lawes.  Reasons why we won't:  1) We are inconsistent and could choke under pressure - see us against Wales in Cardiff 2013 for the grand slam.  2) A young team with lack of experience, one error or poor decision could decide the game.  3) Pool of death. Despite home advantage it is still going to be very difficult to top Pool A against Australia and Wales.

Don't get me wrong, he's good, but he's not great."
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,squeak37,7,Wed Jul 15 19:59:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe a bit overrated, he has his moments if class and a few sub par moments, as with any young player whether he hits is potential is a big factor.

Watson is who you want to watch, personally feel he'll be the best of the youngsters we've got (bar maybe Ford and Slade but even then), he could be insanely good."

He'd possibly move when he's older but that's understandable."
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,PatLook,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:11:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with the loyalty aspect being significantly bigger, and I'd like to believe that it's important enough, but money is creeping in with its influence. Armitage (too lazy to check spelling) is a great example of it.  I'm glad we didn't back ourselves into a corner like England did, Sexton has been invaluable to us, but one of our top players moved away in his prime. Thinking others wont is verging on naive. I just hope World Rugby manages to organise global salary caps or something to prevent a mass exodus to France"
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,squeak37,4,Thu Jul 16 15:56:51 2015 UTC,"It's not really the same with Armitage, he left when when he wasn't particularly close to the England team, and THEN found incredible form."

Armitage was only getting a handful of caps before he left, wasn't the player he is in France at all. But he threw away his chance by leaving.  The salary cap needs to be raised at some point, with only 10-15 years to play at a very high level players need to think about their future.

rugbyunion,3dd3c6,PatLook,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:51:10 2015 UTC,I'd assume as his contract with Bath is pretty good plus all the money he gets from England he'd have little interest in toulon.
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,amplebooty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:50:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of people thinking I'm too cynical about the whole situation, but the simple fact is that he'd earn more in France than England.

rugbyunion,3dd3c6,squeak37,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:47:45 2015 UTC,"If he keeps his england spot he'd probably end up making more money than in france. They're getting around £16, 000 per gam this wc."
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,amplebooty,4,Fri Jul 17 09:50:23 2015 UTC,"It's funny you say this because he did get a go in an England shirt a couple of years ago and was pretty underwhelming, although clearly his club form wasn't what it was now and his form has gone up and down a bit. I haven't watched enough premiership to really judge and I'm sure I'm buying into the hype but he is certainly dangerous and if he replicates his best form consistently then he will be worthy of it. I hate how few specifics I can remember of 6N now that you mention it haha, I'm going to have to rewatch every game!"
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,Clavdivs_Gurnard,4,Thu Jul 16 00:27:14 2015 UTC,"Both players can be figured out.

rugbyunion,3dd3c6,El_Codgerino,8,Wed Jul 15 11:08:43 2015 UTC,"WILL:   They've done it before, away from home, and facing the home favourites in the final. This year, they'll also have home advantage. As well as beating Australia in the autumn, they've now beaten Wales twice in succession - once already this year, with a weakened team. Stuart Lancaster has had 4 years with the squad and knows what each and every player is capable of.    WON'T:   England's biggest hinderance are themselves (and not just Tuilagi, Hartley, Cipriani.) Their reputation remains as the ""Could-Have-Been-Kings""; in every Six Nations since 2011, they've only managed to finish 2nd, losing to Wales twice, Ireland and France over the last 4 years. Against France, it was only by 2 points. Despite their recent success, England have scored far fewer points against Wales than vice versa (England 65 - 83 Wales.) In a group that will likely define the QF places by points difference, this can be crucial. Like any team that progresses through Pool A, they will have the most difficult task in order to reach the final (i.e. face the All Blacks and South Africa in order to get there.)"

rugbyunion,3dd3c6,squeak37,0,Fri Jul 17 02:13:01 2015 UTC,"Because World Cup finals are about more than the quality of the rugby.   That game was the story of the incredible pressure that was on that team, of McCaw playing most of the tournament with a broken foot, of playing with the 4th choice fly half, of an entire nation on the edge.   Criticising the quality of play is missing the point of World Cups."

You want your finals to be between the two best teams playing at their best, not the best teams playing rubbish. The England Australia final in '03 was a better final, that had the nailbiting finish."
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,I_am_LordHarrington,13,Sat Jul 18 21:05:11 2015 UTC,"Why they will:   Home advantage. Strong forward pack. Play smart ten man rugby that is effective in world cups.   Why they won't:   Hugely difficult pool. They can't even put out too much of a weakened team against Fiji, who were close to beating the Maori All Blacks. One loss sees them through to play South Africa in the quarter final. If they make it through them it is a likely semi final against NZ. Slightly unsettled build up with 2 key players out through discipline already. Inexperience at 10.  No established centre pairing."
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,Philosopheme,3,Wed Jul 15 11:17:08 2015 UTC,What do you mean by ten man rugby? I don't think I have heard that term before.  Edit: I found it https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_man_rugby.
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,StuHardy,8,Wed Jul 15 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"The article explains it well, but leaves one notable absence. Quite often 10 man rugby will come with quick wingers who can run the pitch on the counter attack and sneak in a try.   It also under represents the importance of the 10, as traditionally most of the points will come from penalties, which need to be scored."
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,AliCat9100,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:51:09 2015 UTC,Never won a home world cup before. Beaten by the All Blacks 4 times in a row. No Tuilagi.
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,Clavdivs_Gurnard,6,Wed Jul 15 13:20:06 2015 UTC,"Will:   Beaten the Aussies and the Welsh the last two times we played both teams. Dominant forward pack and two talented tens (potentially three with Slade but if he is picked he is likely to play centre) means we can play really strong ten man, knockout style rugby (e.g. against Wales and Australia last season) When we try to throw the ball about a bit it can go really well.   Won't:   When we try to throw the ball about too much it can go really really badly. Could easily lose composure (see against Ireland this Six Nations). 36."
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,Babirusa1,27,Thu Jul 16 20:45:31 2015 UTC,"Reasons why they will:   Clearly a strong squad, some great players in there (Ford, Joseph, etc.) Can beat both Wales and Australia on their day Home advantage which will be huge   Reasons why they won't:   A lot of young players - Ford crumbled under the pressure and was generally subpar in the Aviva Prem final Although they can beat Wales and Australia, Wales and Australia can both beat England... They can't win the RWC because Wales are going to :-)"
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,rugbyfiend,9,Wed Jul 15 09:41:18 2015 UTC,"The last point for ""won't"" isn't fair, because that applies to every other non-Wales team too.   :-)"
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,Babirusa1,5,Wed Jul 15 13:58:38 2015 UTC,"Reasons they will:   Great, experienced pack. The tight five in particular are the match of any side in the tournament Great squad depth. They have 2 or 3 international quality players available in nearly all positions. Home advantage will be huge.   Reasons they won't:   Inexperienced back line. Some real star quality in Ford, Joseph etc. but lots have fewer than ten caps and only Ben Youngs has been to an RWC before. The centres are still in issue. Barritt and Joseph likely to be first choice pair but they've never played together and who gets the back up spots is a mystery. Difficult to see them getting past the All Blacks."

rugbyunion,3dd3c6,amplebooty,5,Wed Jul 15 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"Why they will:   Their pack. Will be one of the strongest and fittest teams at the world cup. Home Advantage. Hugely important. Ridiculous strength in depth.   Reasons why they won't:   First 15 may not be quite as strong as Wales and Australia's, though strength in depth is superior. Still not sold on the halfback combination and whoever will partner Joseph in the centre. Lancaster tends towards conservative selection at times, maybe even more so under pressure at his first world cup."

rugbyunion,3dd3c6,bbook13,6,Sat Jul 18 10:32:28 2015 UTC,Will:   Great set piece Great training environment/ethos/management etc.  Best second row pair in the world (with Retallic/Whitelock) Ability to score when they dominate (thanks to Ford's efficiency on the front foot)   Won't   Tough pool might see them come out already tired. (They should come out) Their defence wasn't great during the Six Nations (see games against Italy and Scotland; France game doesn't count because it was insane) Immense pressure on their shoulders Ford can be bullied to underperform (it hasn't been done by anyone yet) I consider them second most likely team to win the tournament.
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,Grivyn,5,Wed Jul 15 16:56:22 2015 UTC,"Why we will : Very strong at set piece/mauling, our forwards can match any other pack and dominate games at points. We have a versatile backline able to play open, aggressive rugby (Ford, JJ, Slade, Nowell etc.) but also 10 men, defensive orientated rugby (Farrell, Barritt, Goode). We have probably the most depth in any country except New Zealands backs.   We're the home country so support should help a lot and we have the last game in our pool meaning we'll know what we need to win by if it comes to that.  Why we won't: Ecluding Brown (37), Barritt (22), Farrell (29) and Ben Youngs (47) our backline experience is lacking compared to our forwards. Assuming Ford, JJ, Nowell, any wing bar ashton we'll have a very young backline which could easily be our undoing."

Oz game could go either way, both capable of beating the other. But I don't think they could beat the Wales that bested the Irish in 6n. But Wales have a tendency to improve as they go, which you can't really afford in a WC. So I think the Welsh oz and English games could go anywhere, god knows what Welshmen will turn up to play!!"
rugbyunion,3dd3c6,IIICXMCM,4,Wed Jul 15 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"They looked pretty good against Australia in the fall, and had a mostly dominant 6 nations. Their game against Ireland looked like most of their games against elite competition and was characteristically underwhelming of them. With that being said they have as much talent as any team they'll face not wearing black and barring some sort of conspiracy will have the crowd on their side for all of their matches. The big question for them will obviously be who will wear their 10 shirt. Unless they are genuinely inspired by their home fans, I would imagine they will have a typically lackluster performance and with their tough group, may not even advance to the knockout stage."

Even though the stripes are simply diagonal, there was a strong criticism about it, argentines are proud of their flag and are adamant in its proper display, even in something such as a sports kit.   Plus. in all past RWC´s the shirt did have a similar design, i guess that Nike decided that, in such in important rugby year, the shirt should have a more ""conservative"" and classic look.

The maturity of the Welsh may just make them favourites, but the stats indicate Australia will beat them."

A scenario I can imagine is that Wales will beat England, who will beat Australia who will beat Wales. That way it comes down to bonus points/performances against Fiji and Uruguay.

A few of their players are a bit thuggish (Hey kettle, pot here, you're black).  If you mean disciplined around game plan/defence then you're sort of right, but they are beatable.

Also we're tapping into the Samoan and Fijian communities we have. I'm not downplaying white players, it's just nice to see a better cross-section of our society on the team.  I know you might relate, because I've witnessed SA become more comprehensive in the athletes in your society becoming interested in rugby over the past 20 years.  If some of our gridiron players would join, I'm sure we could give anyone a run for the money."
rugbyunion,3ddlpa,kiwirish,9,Wed Jul 15 16:16:23 2015 UTC,"If some of our gridiron players would join, I'm sure we could give anyone a run for the money.   It's exactly this bullshit argument that makes me not want USA rugby to succeed. And I say that as someone whose brother will more than likely end up playing for them.  It's like you're not recognising that it's a very different game that requires a very different skillset. Sure, if you trained up some of the best gridiron players in rugby for a decade, then they'd be pretty good rugby players, but the way a national team grows is through immersion from a young age, you can't teach the intuition of a player who has had a rugby ball in their hands since they were 3. NZ doesn't win rugby games because we have the best athletes, we simply have the best system.   A few gridiron players won't do anything without players who grow up only playing rugby with coaches who have done the same and know the game. At the moment the best collegiate rugby teams would get rocked by most 1A level high school teams in the Southern Hemisphere."
rugbyunion,3ddlpa,JesteroftheApocalyps,-6,Wed Jul 15 20:23:09 2015 UTC,"I respect your logic, and of course if you check my comment history, I have chosen you guys to win the WC because the ABs are purely disciplined.   That being said, we have a huge amount of athletes who, if they were interested, could give you guys a run.  Yeah, they would have to take a pay cut, work out how to offload and not crash into someone onion-to-onion, but put some of these guys on the wing or whatever, they're going to make you break your own ankles. (I know this is old footage, but there are plenty of dudes that can make steps like that and make someone lose a footrace to the tryline.)  Yes, we would probably lose because NZ is a fucking rugby machine.   My argument is that the best athletes in the US are playing more prolific sports.   We're not a rugby nation like you guys are.  But if we were, we could possibly trash you guys."
rugbyunion,3ddlpa,kiwirish,8,Wed Jul 15 21:35:02 2015 UTC,"Athletes in the US are not imherently better than athletes in other countries.   The fact is NFL players are great and look amazing in highlights because of a few reasons:   Highlights are cherry picked to grab the best plays; Because they are able to use that sport's weaknesses to capitalise on it; and, Because they have played it forever.   I respect American Football as a great game and am always kept up-to-date on College Football during the season, hell I even know a lot of the BYU Football players, but to say that you can take gridiron players and turn them into amazing rugby players is just ridiculous and insulting to rugby players and fans, while also being obknoxiously nationalistic by saying that American athletes are just better.  American Football by large is a game reliant on pure speed, power and high bursts of energy for short lengths of time. It also is a game that because of the forward pass and blocking rules allows more exploitation of the defense by the offense and means that a traditional straight line defense won't work. The defense in football is all about not letting someone get a step ahead because it's about stopping yardage entirely, while the offense is all about making one play at a time.  In contrast, rugby is a game far more reliant on stamina, flowing tactics and playing for a long time. No forward pass and obstruction rules make it that much harder to exploit a defense because coming up in a straight line forces them to keep going wider and forced to the corners, or trying to hit straight through which is fairly rare anyway. A rugby defense doesn't care for yardage, it cares about recycling possession and trying to force turnovers at the breakdown, it cares about utilising territory and possession strategies to score.  Yes, if the USA invested money and effort to grow the game they'd improve, but to suggest you can just turn gridiron players into worldbeaters is insulting and nationalistic."

I can tell you that the common misconception of foreign people about gridiron athletes is that they can't maintain the stamina of running around, but I'll tell you, that's a myth.   Just because our game involves short bursts of effort has never meant that US athletes can't easily transition into rugby.  My high school gridiron team, we used to run miles around the track non-stop, running drills for hours every morning.   NFL players do the same.  So I'm not being a nationalist prick, I'm just telling you what I know.  You ever practice and train in American football? No. Well I have for 4 years. You actually play rugby?

If Ireland didnt play GAA, hurling or soccer, we would have a better rugby team.  If Australia didnt play league, they'd have a better rugby team.

I bought the NSW-Country tickets online and entered the hostel address (needed an Aussie address), they were in an envelope behind the desk when I arrived. I did the same for the Brumbies game but picked them up at the stadium. I was on my own for these games.  We got Rebels tickets somehow from some guy on the street but they weren't hard to get in general. We bought Melbourne (test 2) tickets for about $70 somehow on a website, can't remember which one.  Me and a mate paid $250 for the final test tickets from the ticket website I think. The only issue is that NZ stadiums are smaller so getting tickets would be harder, I'm not even sure myself to be honest!"

rugbyunion,3dcj4y,theGeorgeall,6,Wed Jul 15 05:38:58 2015 UTC,Happy about Burger starting but would really have liked to see a completely different front row. Would love to see Pat Lambie at 15 with Le Roux at number 14.
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,theGeorgeall,6,Wed Jul 15 05:42:04 2015 UTC,Yeah can't remember the Sharks scrum doing all that well this year. I still feel that they will lift on the international stage and can't fault players like BdP with the work they put in during open play.
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,Typhon13,3,Wed Jul 15 05:50:31 2015 UTC,To be fair the biggest concern really is Jannie. The other 2 usually get the job done.
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,theGeorgeall,2,Wed Jul 15 08:16:12 2015 UTC,"Jannie's scrummaging hasn't been bad, but he's a liability on defence."
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,Meshkent,4,Wed Jul 15 09:54:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, also both him and his brother have an issue with discipline. Jannie should be suspended for his shoulder charge into Bakkies Botha's head on the weekend."
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,theGeorgeall,2,Wed Jul 15 10:02:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he deserved at least a yellow for that charge IMO.   Bismarck seems to be regaining some form, but he really, really needs to keep a cool head in the WC. A yellow at the wrong time could easily cost us a game."
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,Meshkent,3,Wed Jul 15 10:04:12 2015 UTC,The chance of him not keeping a cool head has been the only reason I have preferred Strauss in the past year or so. But an inform Bismarck is irreplaceable.
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,theGeorgeall,2,Wed Jul 15 10:11:14 2015 UTC,He promised to change after his long last ban in Super Rugby. Let's hope he has.

rugbyunion,3dcj4y,Jeroz,3,Wed Jul 15 06:27:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think he is a bit past it now. He should have retired a few years ago. I hope he can go out on a bit of a high this year, for his sake."
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,rugbyfiend,5,Wed Jul 15 10:41:33 2015 UTC,"I like this team, can't wait to see what the midfield can do against Giteau-Kuridrani! For those who want Jannie out, who would you start instead? Also isn't Mvovo slightly better than Piertersen?"
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,fettsack,3,Wed Jul 15 10:18:05 2015 UTC,"Regarding Jannie, almost anyone would do the job as I see him as a massive liability. Vincent Koch in particular has been in good form. Mvovo is better than JP but still not as good as other guys who have missed out on call ups to the extended squad (S'bura Sithole and Ruan Combrinck) Also Willie at wing and Lambie at fullback would be good/better."
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,theGeorgeall,5,Wed Jul 15 11:29:27 2015 UTC,No Steyn?
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,ruckovercdn,3,Wed Jul 15 14:38:41 2015 UTC,Morne or Frans? I think Frans still hasn't come to a contract agreement and Morne had a great season in Paris.
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,Johnson96,5,Wed Jul 15 15:41:39 2015 UTC,"Frans, who's hard to to argue against in terms of offering a lot at 10, 12 and 15. Morne.... I think he's fallen to far down the depth chart, fairly uninspired in attack in his last few games for the Boks. We don't get Top 14 in Canada anymore, so I haven't been able to follow him at Stade though."
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,ruckovercdn,2,Wed Jul 15 16:18:20 2015 UTC,"I agree that Frans should be in the squad for his versatility and boot, but the SARU fucked up by not following through with their contract.  And Morne had such a great season for Stade Francais that it would be hard to deny him a spot in the training swuad at least."
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,Johnson96,3,Wed Jul 15 16:21:54 2015 UTC,"Well they're both in the wider training squad, that was announced a while ago, I guess Frans in injured at the moment.   I don't doubt Morne, but he's going to have a hard time pushing out Pollard and Lambie."
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,ruckovercdn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:37:48 2015 UTC,Francois Steyn tore his pectoral muscle and is rehabbing with the Sharks; he is still in contention for the RWC.  Morne Steyn is just a known entity and Meyer wants to see if Pollard has more to offer
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,sportsfreak80,3,Wed Jul 15 23:26:30 2015 UTC,That's a very inexperienced center combo
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,drayeseez,4,Wed Jul 15 06:01:04 2015 UTC,The center pairing is the least of SA's concerns.
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,theGeorgeall,3,Wed Jul 15 08:14:52 2015 UTC,Has JP Pietersen been playing well this season? It seems like he always gets picked. I haven't been impressed in a long time. Drought of good SA wingers or what? Is Cornal Hendricks out?
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,justhadtosaythis,6,Wed Jul 15 10:44:47 2015 UTC,If you are really bored watch Ruan Combrick's highlights from 2015. It's hard to judge a player from a highlight reel but JP's 2015 highlight reel would suck balls. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlnO9ZT-zJw
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,theGeorgeall,3,Wed Jul 15 11:22:49 2015 UTC,Looks like a strong powerful runner!
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,justhadtosaythis,2,Wed Jul 15 12:16:36 2015 UTC,Ruan looks to be in much better form than JP. How's his positional play and kicking? Haven't watched much of him.
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,SAGuy90,3,Wed Jul 15 12:59:51 2015 UTC,He's a natural fullback apparently so I assume his positional play is satisfactory but haven't watched enough to make a call. He's a good kicker and can also kick for goal. He should have been in the squad.
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,theGeorgeall,2,Wed Jul 15 13:16:37 2015 UTC,Can also kick for goal??? Whaaaaat. We need an additional starting 15 kicker. JP is old news.   Oh and Jannie starting. Fuuuuuck!!
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,SAGuy90,2,Wed Jul 15 13:26:55 2015 UTC,I agree.
rugbyunion,3dcj4y,theGeorgeall,2,Wed Jul 15 13:37:15 2015 UTC,"No JP has not been playing well. There are wingers who are quality who have not even been selected for the extended squad, such as S'bura Sithole and Ruan Combrinck(Probably others but these guys stood out). Not saying these they are the answer but I would have liked to see them tested and I believe both can do a far better job than JP is currently doing."

rugbyunion,3db01q,SouthAfricanD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:35:57 2015 UTC,"He's English, he plays overseas and we have so much depth in the hooker position. Unless Bismarck and Strauss are injured he probably won't get a (deserved) call up."
rugbyunion,3db01q,SAGuy90,2,Wed Jul 15 05:13:32 2015 UTC,"English mate, really? John Smit was English.. Let's be honest we are blessed with many great hookers and have been for quite some years. Bismark has been the n01 for years and Strauss is also really good. Brits has been playing well in Europe for years. Chiliboy, Tiaan Liebenberg was also a solid choice. We have plenty. Burden is good, really good, and deserves a shout but its not easy with so much choice."
rugbyunion,3db01q,SouthAfricanD,2,Wed Jul 15 06:28:34 2015 UTC,"English plays a part under HM don't deny it. If Lambie played as inconsistently as Pollard he would be crucified every week and people would want blood. Pollard can play badly but always ""be given another run"". It plays a part."
rugbyunion,3db01q,SAGuy90,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:43:38 2015 UTC,"Lambie has had many chances, more than Pollard. Lambie has only starting paying better within the past year. He has been very hot and cold, particularly in the green & gold. Last year he started to show some stability. Lambie has been playing since 2011 for the Boks, Pollard made his Springbok debut in 2014. I think you have a bit of Shark supporter bias bru."

rugbyunion,3dc836,linglingdang,4,Wed Jul 15 05:41:14 2015 UTC,"Nah, Skelton will be subbed after 50, Fardy will move to lock and Pocock will come on. He'll be like a limpet on a few rucks in the last 15, I reckon. The Saffas just have no idea how to deal with Pocock."
rugbyunion,3dc836,Junglinguy,20,Wed Jul 15 05:56:38 2015 UTC,I see your point but personally I would think it would be better to have Hooper come on late and cause a lot of havoc in the loose against tired legs.
rugbyunion,3dc836,linglingdang,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:10:41 2015 UTC,I'm on board with this!
rugbyunion,3dc836,DampWaffle,7,Wed Jul 15 22:04:54 2015 UTC,The Saffas just have no idea how to deal with Pocock   Bryce Lawrence isn't refereeing this game...
rugbyunion,3dc836,Meshkent,5,Wed Jul 15 09:58:41 2015 UTC,He consistently had it over them at the breakdown over 2010-2011 until the endless injuries started. Not just the one game. Schalk Burger in particular was absolutely dominated repeatedly.  This is my favourite example.
rugbyunion,3dc836,rugbyfiend,-7,Wed Jul 15 10:46:09 2015 UTC,"Jesus, you really need to learn to spot bias when you see it mate.   Also: yes, Pocock is a fantastic player and he's given SA plenty of trouble. That was very much a tongue-in-cheek winge about the second worst refereeing performance of the 2011 RWC. (First of course going to Joubert's handling of the final)."
rugbyunion,3dc836,Meshkent,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:53:32 2015 UTC,"Eh, my point still stands. They try and pry him off the ball which, once he's over it, never works. The Kiwis send runners at him and make him the first tackler which nullifies (generally) his pilfering."
rugbyunion,3dc836,Junglinguy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the beauty of sport is that all our armchair analysis will be put to the test on Saturday. Let's see how he does!   It's going to be a cracker of a game."
rugbyunion,3dc836,Meshkent,3,Thu Jul 16 11:27:57 2015 UTC,"I dont really watch a lot of super rugby, but every time ive seen skelton he just seems so slow, like hes almost walking to every breakdown. Is he really that good?"
rugbyunion,3dc836,muelindustries,8,Wed Jul 15 08:48:56 2015 UTC,"His workrate at times is poor (although it has improved substantially), but he can be quicker than his size suggests, very good ball handling skills - and I don't recall a player that is better at singlehandedly destroying a maul.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JmH5ARzPUI"
rugbyunion,3dc836,Flys_Lo,4,Wed Jul 15 10:00:43 2015 UTC,"He's a great runner with the ball, with excellent hands. He is amazing at maul defence and counter rucking.  He is barely a lineout option, and his scrummaging is still questionable (it appears better than last year).  He is universally considered to be in Australia's starting side, but lock is probably our weakest position.  So in summary, maybe."
rugbyunion,3dc836,strewthcobber,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:51:54 2015 UTC,He has size and his physicality around the rucks is what's needed against the Boks.

rugbyunion,3dc836,gezaarr,2,Wed Jul 15 04:58:50 2015 UTC,"He's been great EVERY season. He's been a victim of depth for awhile now. That always seems to happen in the back 3 nowadays (See: Luatua, Ardie Savea).   Replace the props with flankers, I say, they're just slowing us down."
rugbyunion,3dc836,night_dude,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:53:54 2015 UTC,"Boooo!!!!   Rugby would be shit without props.  Also, I like Higginbotham as a player, but understand fully why he has not been a regular starter - he has been less than effective doing tight work, and has not been so good at bending then defensive line when running into heavy traffic.  He has, however, shown this season (and shown glimpses last season) that he has improved these parts of his game."

rugbyunion,3dc836,Cursed_Sun,2,Wed Jul 15 07:58:48 2015 UTC,"Yerp! it was during the Ewen McKenzie saga.  Thought this was a reply to another comment, my bad. Yeah excited to seeing him play!"
rugbyunion,3dc836,Bangkok_Dave,7,Wed Jul 15 08:15:20 2015 UTC,Oh fuck sake. Cheika seems to have hit it right. I'm worried come World Cup time.
rugbyunion,3dc836,dr_chim_richaldz,2,Wed Jul 15 05:49:21 2015 UTC,Think how we feel!
rugbyunion,3dc836,Bangkok_Dave,7,Wed Jul 15 19:20:53 2015 UTC,"Few points:  I doubt the competition for the number 7 jersey is anywhere close to settled. I'm sure Pocock and Hooper will both get starting opportunities before the WC.  Both AAC and Hooper are in the starting side, and as Vice Captains that is fine for the first international game of the season. Both will be under immense pressure to keep their starting spot, but both at least do have that opportunity given to them.  The 9-10-12 combination is obviously (1) there to give Phipps, Foley and Toomua a rest, and (2) an experiment to see how there guys go against real opposition.  Happy to see Higgingbotham given the number 8 jersey, hope he plays well  enough to retain it. Palu will come back into the squad at some stage though.  Otherwise no real surprises."
rugbyunion,3dc836,reggie_007,3,Wed Jul 15 08:37:09 2015 UTC,"Higginbotham has more than earned that spot (and I say this as a Waratahs fan). He's been far more destructive than Palu,this year and I think Palu will have trouble getting back into the team if Higgers continues his Super Rugby form.   This team allows jumpers in Fardy, Higgers, Simmons, and to a lesser degree, Skelton. Knowing how easily Higginbotham can cover flanker, Fardy should be watching his heels too."
rugbyunion,3dc836,mb44k,2,Wed Jul 15 12:47:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with all that. I do, however, expect Palu to be given an opportunity, and if Higgingbotham doesn't perform on Saturday that may be held against him."
rugbyunion,3dc836,shulzi,11,Wed Jul 15 14:06:39 2015 UTC,"Underestimate the Aussies at your peril. They well be very dangerous this year, and I can see them topping their world cup pool. This will be a great test, and looks evenly matched.  That said, the Boks have the extra week to blow out the cobwebs, so will also be very tough."
rugbyunion,3dc836,Douges,5,Wed Jul 15 05:37:51 2015 UTC,Havent watched that many tahs games. Is rob horne actually really that good now or dont we have anyone better for wing like out injured etc ?
rugbyunion,3dc836,Grandmaster_flashes,10,Wed Jul 15 03:37:56 2015 UTC,He was probably one of our form wingers. Has the knack of being sat the right place at the right time.
rugbyunion,3dc836,batzman,2,Wed Jul 15 04:09:16 2015 UTC,I know you're a regular poster but that flair confuses me
rugbyunion,3dc836,rugbyfiend,4,Wed Jul 15 06:18:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Im going to change it back. Too many times have I had to explain that when I say ""We"" it means Australia.  I changed it because I said I'd support SA in the WC if Beale wasn't dropped. He was initially and then was brought back in later in the tour. Settled for a change of flair."
rugbyunion,3dc836,Grandmaster_flashes,3,Wed Jul 15 08:00:47 2015 UTC,"Horne is really solid and actually pretty quick, especially off the mark.  I didn't rate him a few years ago, but the beginning of last year he really pumped it up a gear"
rugbyunion,3dc836,shulzi,3,Wed Jul 15 03:57:24 2015 UTC,By far the most consistent winger this year in super rugby and also our best defensive player in the backline
rugbyunion,3dc836,IIICXMCM,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:56:27 2015 UTC,He doesn't really seem like a winger? Not very illusive e.g. no step/ pace or have size to smash through tackles. Not the best finisher.
rugbyunion,3dc836,lapsuscalumni,5,Wed Jul 15 03:55:07 2015 UTC,"He started at centre but reinvented himself as a winger. He's actually been fantastic this year and last year, he's an extremely strong runner despite his size."
rugbyunion,3dc836,Meshkent,4,Wed Jul 15 10:47:32 2015 UTC,"Hmm no step, I seem to remember him stepping 2 players to score the winning try against the boks last year.."
rugbyunion,3dc836,ConspicuousPineapple,3,Wed Jul 15 05:54:43 2015 UTC,Yeah his step and defence are great
rugbyunion,3dc836,Bangkok_Dave,2,Wed Jul 15 06:19:24 2015 UTC,"Giteau is a beautiful player, so happy to see him back (may be less happy come WC vs. England).   Certain sportsmen bring their sport to life. See Federer, Messi, Shaun White, Ronnie O'Sullivan. Giteau is different mustard to current 10s/12s."
rugbyunion,3dc836,dr_chim_richaldz,3,Wed Jul 15 10:43:47 2015 UTC,Bring out Pocock!!!!!
rugbyunion,3dc836,rugbyfiend,3,Wed Jul 15 08:55:54 2015 UTC,"I'd love to know, what do the Aussies here think of Quade? He seems either to be miraculously good or disastrously bad with little in the middle.   Edit: extra ""either"" removed"
rugbyunion,3dc836,dr_chim_richaldz,5,Wed Jul 15 10:00:57 2015 UTC,"He's like an australian Michalak, but less biased towards the ""bad"" side."
rugbyunion,3dc836,misc_ALEINS_AER_HERE,9,Wed Jul 15 12:47:04 2015 UTC,Can't win the WC without Quade starting.
rugbyunion,3dc836,QuadeCooper,2,Wed Jul 15 11:40:57 2015 UTC,We couldn't win it when he was starting either. We just have to hope the right Quade turns up.
rugbyunion,3dc836,sdre,6,Wed Jul 15 23:12:52 2015 UTC,Yep that's more or less it.  I rate him as our best 10 frankly.
rugbyunion,3dc836,dr_chim_richaldz,5,Wed Jul 15 10:48:56 2015 UTC,I'm excited to see Larkham's influence.

rugbyunion,3dbvdo,bakwan,6,Wed Jul 15 03:01:28 2015 UTC,"No, France is mostly unaware of blind and open sides, they play with two flankers. Dusautoir traditionaly wears 6 and he's more of an openside so that's why a lot of people think that the numbers are like that."
rugbyunion,3dbvdo,fettsack,8,Wed Jul 15 08:37:14 2015 UTC,not only is Pocock an amazing openside but he is also an all round great role model.

rugbyunion,3dbvdo,jbarbz,3,Wed Jul 15 03:16:58 2015 UTC,Aus prob have the 2 best open sides in the world no doubt. Even better than Richie at his advanced age.  Just need to find a consistent front row and the Aussies would get a lot more consistent.
rugbyunion,3dbvdo,FurryCrew,2,Wed Jul 15 07:34:33 2015 UTC,What I got out of that clip is that John Mitchell is starting to get a bit of a South African accent.

rugbyunion,3d9x1b,shellcordovan,15,Tue Jul 14 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"The team is:    Tony Woodcock (111) Keven Mealamu (124) Owen Franks (68) Luke Romano (18) Brodie Retallick  (37) Jerome Kaino (57) Richie McCaw - captain (138) Kieran Read (73) TJ Perenara (11) Daniel Carter (103) Charles Piutau (15) Sonny Bill Williams (24) Ma'a Nonu (94) Waisake Naholo Israel Dagg (47)   Reserves:   Codie Taylor Wyatt Crockett (37) Nepo Laulala (1) Jeremy Thrush (11) Liam Messam  (40) Andy Ellis (27) Colin Slade  (18) Ryan Crotty (14)    Interesting to see Nonu back at 13 - if I remember correctly, he didn't have the best time there the last time he was shifted out to accommodate SBW. I'm glad that the coaching staff is blooding new players and allowing Dagg to hopefully work his way back into form before the RWC."
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,savois-faire,4,Tue Jul 14 17:18:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever seen an ABs line-up that I didn't find absolutely terrifying, but man that is a scary looking 23."
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,Rand0mNZ,9,Tue Jul 14 23:56:20 2015 UTC,It's definitely not a full strength 23.
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,Haasts_Eagle,9,Wed Jul 15 01:37:33 2015 UTC,Ben and Aaron Smith are probably away having their adamantium grafts done as we speak. Savea has already had his and is probably cultivating pure mass.
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,yeek05,30,Wed Jul 15 02:46:30 2015 UTC,Ellis and Dagg should go buy a lotto ticket.
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,NZGrade,4,Tue Jul 14 22:02:51 2015 UTC,"Ellis yes but I think Dagg has to be the most harshly criticised player in NZ, by far. Admittedly he hasn't been at the same level as he was during the last WC (when he was incredible), but he is still a key player for the ABs.   He has probably the biggest boot (or one of) in world rugby, and I've lost count of how many times the ABs have been pinned down, only for him to hoof it 70 metres and get them out of trouble. I would guess his punt is a central part of their defensive / get out of jail strategy, and teams like the Springboks will alter their game when he's at the back because you almost never win a kicking contest against Dagg.  B. Smith is the better all round player now, but I think the team is strongest when both are on the field. Some of the link play between those two last year was brilliant."
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,yeek05,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:17:36 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you but I feel as though he's on his way out and always injured. There are so many other young fellas who could fill that spot and Hansen should be giving them some experience before the WC comes round. Dagg was pivotal in the last WC but he definitely hasn't been playing well this season, and the new guys have been making an impact in the Super Rugby. Well, that's my two cents, fwiw."
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,NZGrade,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:36:56 2015 UTC,"He was going pretty good for the Saders this season before getting injured, his running and passing was looking more like it used to.   I think if he gets his confidence back and a few successive games in black under his belt, he will be all good. He is only 27, so still in his prime years."
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,night_dude,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:49:19 2015 UTC,"Hard out. Ellis is only there because it's his last game in Christchurch, surely. He was bloody awful last week."

rugbyunion,3d9x1b,considerspiders,6,Tue Jul 14 20:10:24 2015 UTC,Still resting Smith I guess
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,lapsuscalumni,7,Tue Jul 14 22:46:29 2015 UTC,"I guess seeing how Piutau did against their first test in Samoa, they are keeping him on the starting XV. I thought that with him going to Ulster they would be less willing to start him.   Also I was hoping to see NMS and Feks in the line up."
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,acideath,4,Tue Jul 14 18:32:23 2015 UTC,"Hansen isnt that petty. If he is eligible and playing well enough for selection he will be selected. I imagine that they will want him to return in 2 or 3 years as well, best keep Chucky P interested in a return, he will be just building up to his peak by then."

rugbyunion,3d9x1b,Mutant321,5,Tue Jul 14 21:10:52 2015 UTC,CJ is pretty highly rated within NZ rugby. I think he's still got a good chance of making the team if he can sort out his fitness.

rugbyunion,3d9x1b,003_,7,Wed Jul 15 10:50:17 2015 UTC,Why Dagg? I think his time should be up with the ABs. Put Piutau or Ben Smith at fullback. That would allow Milner-Skudder and Naholo to get some experience and usher in the next generation.
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,ruckovercdn,7,Tue Jul 14 17:34:03 2015 UTC,"While I agree that Milner-Skudder, Naholo, etc. should get experience on the international scene, the RWC is the primary concern at the moment. The new generation won't have enough experience for the RWC if ushered in now, and Dagg's huge boot is helpful for tournament-style play."
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,fernta,6,Tue Jul 14 17:43:13 2015 UTC,"If you don't think the yung guys are expeianced enough, isn't this a great chance to blood them against Argentina?"
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,Foveaux,10,Tue Jul 14 21:22:01 2015 UTC,"New Zealand have 4 test matches before the RWC, which isn't even close to enough to build enough experience. At this point, it's worth more to continue building coherence and strengthen existing combinations in the current team than to introduce new players into the mix."
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,night_dude,2,Wed Jul 15 00:01:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say this is the most experienced ABs line-up by a long-ways, and Hansen is already trying to balance it.  I'd think the reason why is because Naholo is already on the right wing, and Hansen would probably want to bring in Milner-Skudder on the wing before making him start in one of the most important positions on the field with no test experience.  Totally agree with what everybody says about Dagg here, though, he was great this Crusaders season and that game against Samoa wasn't great, but it really wasn't for everybody. If he can do well here and prove himself, he has a huge boot and experience which is what we need for the WC. If you really want to get rid of him, get rid of him after the WC."
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,fernta,3,Tue Jul 14 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"I recall an interview the day Hansen announced the squad names after the Super 15 final, he said in the interview that a player like NMS would start on the wing to get accustomed and shift from there. He didn't even dance around it, so I think you're spot on there."
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,Lyesalot,2,Wed Jul 15 02:13:11 2015 UTC,"Fully agree about Dagg. I think part of the backlash against him is to do with the wealth of back-three magicians we have now (I know that I would LOVE to see NMS out there instead, from a personal perspective) but he hasn't had much of a chance to show how good (or bad) he still is yet.  I mean, sure, he's not as good as B. Smith, but who is?"
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,Mutant321,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:59:11 2015 UTC,"Savea/Smith/Dagg still creates the best overall back 3 imo, even if you want to argue Ben Smith is the better 15.  Ben Smith had a much better 2013 scoring so many tries compared to in 2014 where he had a fair share at FB - even if he was a good defender/good vision as the leader of the outside backs, he could never really peak through like he did on the wing. Dagg can still play defensively with his big boot, so the advantage is mitigated.  Why I think that back 3 is the best, especially if Dagg finds the form he had earlier this year - he's barely had a chance to fucking play all season, but he actually did do really well this year until he was out with injury."
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,cape7,7,Wed Jul 15 11:13:16 2015 UTC,I think it's more that Smith can do with a rest and Dagg deserves a chance in better conditions in front of a Christchurch crowd.  Although I agree with giving a Milner-Skudder a go instead.
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,Koreapsu,3,Tue Jul 14 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"In a WC, fullback is a crucial position. If Dagg is playing well, he's a good steady option - good under the high ball, and a huge punt to return any kicks. He really needs to play well in this match though."
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,cape7,3,Tue Jul 14 20:16:00 2015 UTC,Dagg was one of the players of the tournament last world cup and a constant fixture in the All Blacks dominant run since then. Hes in patchy form but deserves the chance to prove that he still has what it takes in the black jersey. Hes in the same situation Mills Muliaina was in last time around.
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,batzman,3,Tue Jul 14 20:38:06 2015 UTC,About to be dropped for a better player then?  That injury Mils got saved the coaches from having to make a tough call.
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,batzman,5,Tue Jul 14 23:32:13 2015 UTC,"In the sense that he's the incumbent and has the chance to prove he should still be there. If he doesn't step up then yeah, he'll be replaced.   Personally, i think he still has it and i would start him at 15 if the world cup final was tomorrow"

rugbyunion,3d9x1b,pizzalord_,-2,Wed Jul 15 03:45:50 2015 UTC,He is. Watch those tries. Admittedly he's running great lines and finishing off or scoring a try after the defense is broken but he accelerates too slowly and is just plain slow when running at pace. Rewatch those 11 tries again. You'll sit their and think 2 things: unparalleled support play assisted those tries and 2: damn he's slow.

rugbyunion,3d9x1b,plato44,25,Tue Jul 14 22:41:21 2015 UTC,way to piss off your European audience   As someone who gets up in the wee small hours to watch the 6 nations and autumn internationals (where two matches are scheduled at the same time) in the northern hemisphere if you could ever so politely go fuck yourself that'd be great.
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,Curufir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:42:47 2015 UTC,If it was at 3 am on a Friday night/Saturday morning I could at least watch.  It kicks off while I (and most other) Europeans are starting work. Doesn't seem like a particularly good move from a commercial point of view  I suppose in hindsight the RWC started on a Friday morning but that was stoopid too.
rugbyunion,3d9x1b,QuadeCooper,2,Wed Jul 15 07:18:14 2015 UTC,from a commercial point of view   In a country that lives and breathes rugby there is no live free to air TV coverage so please don't bleat to me about commercial points of view. I was actually surprised that this game is on a Friday night and I couldn't explain the rationale for it being so. Maybe someone better informed can enlighten both of us...

rugbyunion,3d9rim,Clavdivs_Gurnard,2,Wed Jul 15 20:45:39 2015 UTC,I'm torn between wanting Morgan starting or bringing him on at a later stage to wreak havoc. If both of them are fit it makes sense to have Billy smash it up hard for 50 minutes and then let Morgan go town for the rest. Either way with the international form Vunipola started to show this 6N it is an awesome position for us to be in.
rugbyunion,3d9rim,PatLook,3,Wed Jul 15 15:35:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what you mean, Morgan is probably one of the most destructive impact subs you could have, and Billy would do a good job in the 50 minutes. Personally I feel Morgan can do it usually for the full 80and really rate him as a world class 8. However whether after his injury he could last 80 minutes and not be completely knackered is not a sure thing, and I'd rather it be him off the bench with Billy starting if that's the case."
rugbyunion,3d9rim,Clavdivs_Gurnard,4,Wed Jul 15 16:00:06 2015 UTC,"In my heart of hearts I too just want to see Morgan play the full 80, his carrying is so much fun to watch. I'm sure they will both be used for maximum effect!"

The top 9 gave very little time for their understudies to perform well according to the stats as they played the majority of the important games. Whereas Murphy (as Heaslips understudy) had a chance to play very well in a massive game against England , Italy and a bit against France (all of which he excelled in) this will have tipped the stats in his favour a lot hence him making the list.  But I agree. He is going to be a world beater very soon. But nowhere near one of the best number 8's in the world. He is not even one of the best 8's at Leinster"

rugbyunion,3d8cpq,D-Hex,2,Tue Jul 14 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"Jorge Campos:       Jorge Francisco Campos Navarrete (nicknamed El Brody or Chiqui-Campos or El Chapulín) (born 15 October 1966 in Acapulco) is a retired Mexican footballer, who played as a goalkeeper and striker.  A notable player of Mexico in the 1990s, Campos was an eccentric player, known for his constant play outside the penalty area, his acrobatic goal style, and his colorful play attire. His strength as a goalkeeper was his leaping ability and speed, which seem to enable him to overcome his relatively short height for a position that could use a height advantage. [citation needed] He had been officially billed at 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m), although he is actually 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m). He was widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.    Campos also made for an effective striker, a rare example of versatility in football. [citation needed] At times, he would start a game in goal, and transfer upfield later in the match, mostly at the club level. His trademark, self-designed bright kits contributed to his popularity.

rugbyunion,3d8cpq,WallopyJoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:25:12 2015 UTC,It does. The training tops have been really nice the past season or two.
rugbyunion,3d8cpq,0ffice_Zombie,2,Tue Jul 14 11:31:27 2015 UTC,It looks nice but it's a bad choice of colours. The only other team in green in South Africa with a very dark green. So to play against them they choose a black and green jersey... If they do play each other the ref will probably force South Africa to play in white so that we can see properly.
rugbyunion,3d8cpq,fettsack,2,Tue Jul 14 12:18:20 2015 UTC,We've played South Africa while wearing a black jersey and they wore their regular green jersey in 2012. Not sure it's an issue.
rugbyunion,3d8cpq,0ffice_Zombie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:23:33 2015 UTC,It works but it's pretty shit. Look at the SA-World XV game. Their jerseys are annoyingly similar and that's without the green shoulders.

rugbyunion,3d5n9f,metompkin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:17:56 2015 UTC,You think so? Drop kick restarts on the turf that I play on are horrible. Not enough bounce so it's very difficult to get under the ball to give it sufficient height.

Which is really astonishing when you look at the relative number of registered players in each country.  I know this is courting with danger but what about the influence of pacific genetics? look at how all the pacific islands outplay countries with far greater populations and resources. Fiji are amazing at sevens, Samoa gave the all blacks a decent run and American Samoa provides a disproportionate number of players to the NFL for its population size.  Even the wallabies have had plenty of players with Pacific roots and look at the NRL.  I know its not the major reason, or even in the top 5, but i cant help but feel that these countries produce a lot of big lads who can run very fast and have handy skills."
rugbyunion,3d5eq1,royal_oui,5,Tue Jul 14 13:48:47 2015 UTC,"While what you say probably is true. I'll just note that many of the very best players in NZ have no pacific roots.

rugbyunion,3d5eq1,bobwinters,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:30:07 2015 UTC,definitely - those guys are just freaks and they happened to choose rugby. those guys would fit in the natural athlete category and could probably play any sport they chose. guys like that are like AB De Villiers - anything (sporting) they touch turns to gold - in Australia the majority of those guys get sucked into AFL or League unfortunately :( in the rest of the world they probably would choose Soccer.
rugbyunion,3d5eq1,royal_oui,2,Wed Jul 15 11:14:11 2015 UTC,"I do think having the close relationship with Pacific Islanders is a factor, they are more physically built and, coupled with the superior training facilities and support NZ can offer compared to Pacific Island nations, it turns these natural athletes into stars in their sport."
rugbyunion,3d5eq1,snomanDS,3,Tue Jul 14 21:22:26 2015 UTC,"NZ doesn't just have a close relationship with Pacific Islanders; Pacific Islanders are a significant part of the population. NZ is, after all, an island nation in the Pacific, which has its own indigenous Polynesian people.  In the All Blacks team just announced, there are (best I can tell) three players who weren't born in NZ: Jerome Kaino who moved to NZ when he was 4, and Waisake Naholo and Nepo Laualala who both went to high school in NZ.   The other non-Maori Polynesian players (Keven Mealamu, TJ Perenara,  Charles Piutau, Ma'a Nonu, and Sonny Bill Williams, by my reckoning) were all born in NZ.   If I were to generalise,  I would say that the Polynesian players mature, physically, earlier than in other countries--but it seems hard to look at the Welsh, French, and South African teams and call the size of Polynesian players decisive. You can also look at the All Blacks...  But the Polynesian communities--particularly Samoan, Tongan, Fijian, and Maori--have extremely strong rugby cultures. As you say, couple that with a genuinely economically developed nation, and you get a hotbed for locating passionate players, with real talent, and committing the resources to developing them."
rugbyunion,3d5eq1,MasterEk,22,Wed Jul 15 11:05:15 2015 UTC,"Because when a country has been playing for so long, probably only less than England Scotland right? It breeds a higher level of competition and skill. It doesn't necessarily matter what the population is, SA, England, France, and Australia all have much higher populations, but the mid caliber rugby players in each of those countries are not as good as NZ's. Since NZ has very little competition in getting players at an early age, unlike most other countries like Aus, Eng, France, Wales, Scotland, Argentina etc. NZ can have all their diverse athletes put their skills into rugby, instead of splintering off to a sport which better fit their skill set.   For example: The U.S. has a ton of big sports that compete against each other to get youngsters to play their sport. Although Baseball is a really big sport there, they are actually tied as the best country in the world at baseball with Cuba, South Korea, and Japan. Baseball is the biggest sport in all these countries supposedly, and their best athletes with diverse skill sets mostly all go baseball, thus boosting the talent level. But in America, kids who have a knack for baseball at a young age, over another sport, only bring their more narrow skill set to baseball. Those who have more of a knack for a different sport like hockey and basketball, go there.   So in short, diverse skill sets will increase the talent pool since young athletes don't have quite the luxury to pick different sports. Instead, they bring their own unique abilities to rugby in NZ because the athletes don't really have the same opportunity to pick a sport which may be better suited for the specific strengths."
rugbyunion,3d5eq1,003_,10,Mon Jul 13 18:32:36 2015 UTC,I remember reading an editorial in an NZ newspaper from a soccer coach complaining about low enrollment rates among children because they all wanted to play rugby - the author basically put the onus on parents to encourage kids to move to soccer if they were cut out etc for rugby  Probably the only country where people need to be encouraged/forced to play soccer (not that I'm complaining)
rugbyunion,3d5eq1,upsidedownj,16,Mon Jul 13 18:43:02 2015 UTC,"Junior soccer participation rates outstrip that of rugby, but almost every boy and a high number of girls in new zealand have played rugby in a structured environment at some point in New Zealand."

rugbyunion,3d5eq1,kiwirish,14,Tue Jul 14 02:37:13 2015 UTC,"Another big reason for NZ is definitely our age group systems, unlike most countries NZ's system is weight based up to early teens as opposed to age. This leads to better development of skills as you don't have much bigger children just running rampant steamrolling smaller players. Then when switched to age based teams the players have already developed good handling and tackling skill sets that allow the smaller players the ability to deal with bigger ones running at them."
rugbyunion,3d5eq1,Grivyn,3,Mon Jul 13 22:03:45 2015 UTC,"I've been a proponent of Wales adopting the NZ system for a long time. There are a lot of parallels between Wales and NZ when it comes to rugby (which is probably why we tend to get on so bloody well), and I think following the NZ lead in terms of age-group structure, or something similar, and encouraged participation in other forms of rugby (e.g. tag) would do us the world of good."

Anything else could come across as a cultural generalisation.  But in my experience the children who grew up to be All Blacks were not taught that losing is okay. McCaw, Anton Oliver, Sean Fitzpatrick and a few others who slip my mind have all spoken in their biographies how they were taught from an early age to be winners. It's probably no coincidence that there exists a high instance of All Blacks in familial lines in comparison to other countries.  I'm sure I've seen a couple of papers on this very thing.

rugbyunion,3d5eq1,fettsack,15,Mon Jul 13 19:38:58 2015 UTC,"I think that rugby in schools is a huge part of New Zealand's positive culture of rugby. Comparing it to the other tier 1 nations: In the UK (England, Wales and Scotland), Australia and SA it's mostly in privileged schools, the rest of the population is focused on other sports. In Ireland it seems pretty good from what I gather but it's also blocked by other sports being more popular (yet they're one of the best nations, also with a small population). In France there's no proper rugby in schools."

We played touch before school, interval and lunch time. Any spare minute we had we played touch. We also carried a ball around with us wherever we went and passed it between us on the way to each class. Even the guys who didn't even play rugby did this.  And I went to a 3rd division school, no players have ever made a provincial team, let alone the All Blacks. This leads to a majority of the population having rugby skills leading to an awesome foundation of talent."

Rugby's historically a lower-class game in Wales, and that's still the case. Upper-class Welsh schools veer far more strongly towards soccer and many have deliberately phased-out rugby in recent years. Sadly, many lower-class schools aren't as rugby-centric as they used to be (health and safety concerns over the physicality of the game, for fuck's sake), a trend that I really hope can be reversed. There is a huge traditional appetite for rugby in Wales, and I'd love to see it given broad priority as our national sport. Soccer has more money, but rugby has Wales' heart.  I went on a bit of a tangent there, eh?"

rugbyunion,3d5eq1,ThatHamiltonGuy,7,Tue Jul 14 05:12:42 2015 UTC,"Kiwi here.   We have very good youth rugby participation, we have competitive events for 6 and 7 year old kids.   At around school year 6 (10 years old) we have representative rugby matches, in my home town Te Awamutu, which is in the Mighty Waikato, our year 6 representative rugby tournament was known as Roller Mills. Unsure of the meaning to the name now. We also had kids teams defined by weight, so under 40 (kg), under 50s, under 55s, under 60s, under 70s etc etc.  Anyway, Waikato has perhaps 30 towns? So at 11 years old I was in a full on competition.   So moving into high school, we have similar regional tournaments as well as national tournaments.   After players come of age and leave school, we go back to our local regional team competitions. Te Awamutu had TA Sports, Marist Old Boys, Pirongia, Kihikihi and a couple more possibly. These rugby clubs have youth, under 19s, under 20s, seniors, senior a, b and reserves.   One town in a region with 30 towns.   Multiple competitions.   From our region, we have Waikato, waikato a, waikato secondary schools, etc etc which all compete in national tournaments composed of 16 regions.   Then we have Super Rugby.   Then we have passion, lots of it, at every level of the sport.   Then we have our cultural fan base. Our country's people love rugby. So even at a 6 years old game, you'll not be surprised to see couple hundred people watching it on the side of the field.   So I put it to the combined fact of passion for rugby, early/young exposure, well organised age/weight competitions with great options for progression in rugby as a player going from 6 years old to the big stage, locally, regionally and national as a player does come of age.   We set this up before any other country had anything near the focus on rugby development we do.   If I'm correct, we had nationally organised tournaments 30+ years before other countries, please don't quote that, just something I have a vague memory of reading some time ago.   We are a rugby mad high performance factory. Also known as New Zealand lol."

I played League in Aus when i was a kid and i thought it was unheard of in NZ but with since the Aukland team started recent test victiories i seem to be hearing a lot more about League in NZ.  I was watching a video of that Nathan Friend backflip pass try and the crowd was huge. I was honestly suprised to see so much support for the Warriors.

rugbyunion,3d5eq1,Mutant321,6,Tue Jul 14 16:57:21 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it's the whole rugby system. Kids start playing around 5 (even though a lot aren't allowed to play until later), and are taught to be competitive from the beginning.  Until pretty recently, NZ wasn't ""famous"" for anything other than rugby. Because of that, we are really desperate for the ABs to win everything. A lot of countries are really into their sport, but I'm not sure there's another national team who is expected to win every single game. That expectation is actually a good thing at the moment, as it's being used to drive the team forward.  Also, remember that we're currently in one of the greatest (if not the greatest) periods of NZ rugby ever. It started around 2005 and has run until today. It may well come to an end after this world cup. Although NZ was often #1 before that, they were nowhere near as consistent. We're in the professional era now as well, so I wouldn't be surprised if there is a dark period for NZ rugby on the horizon (within 10 years or so). It's not outside the realms of possibility that NZ could fall outside the top 3. That's when the expectation actually starts to become a bad thing, as coaches get axed consistently, etc."
rugbyunion,3d5eq1,tomasnz,3,Mon Jul 13 20:28:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily say there's a reason why we'll have a dark period.  I mean our U20s are consistently champions or finalists, our Secondary School sides almost never lose, our top high school teams constantly win the world title, so it's a sign that our depth and youth are still there. We just need to stop idolising some players so much that we don't let others take their responsibility.  McCaw should have taken more limited roles following the 2011 RWC to allow more ability to test younger players in those positions. The NZRU should control this and make the older veterans who are only going to last another RWC cycle take more limited roles and less minutes onfield to give more opportunities.  In the midfield it's been done fairly well, but largely due to injuries occurring to players. But I can see it becoming a problem in the future where players stay around as leaders for so long that the coaches eventually lose them permanently without someone who has had the experience to at least not be detrimental on the field."
rugbyunion,3d5eq1,squatdog_nz,2,Tue Jul 14 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"Well, ""dark"" could be no longer #1 (outside the top 3 is less likely, but not impossible). Other countries are starting to take rugby more seriously, so over time it'll become harder for NZ to remain as dominant. Not to say we won't always be near the top, but the last 10 years have been something special.  I don't think it's necessarily about the individual players. We'll always have amazing talent to draw from. It's about what goes on around them. In the late 90s/early 2000s NZ was struggling to transition into the professional era, and the performance of the ABs suffered as a result. It culminated in losing the 2003 WC joint hosting rights, which meant a clear-out at the top, and NZ rugby becoming truly professionalised. The legacy is with us today.  I know it's really hard to remember what it was like back then, because of how amazing the current era is, but there's just no reason why we will necessarily dominate like we have for the last 10 years. In fact, I'd say it's impossible that we will be this good forever."
rugbyunion,3d5eq1,Mutant321,2,Tue Jul 14 03:00:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting thoughts.   As a Springbok fan myself, I am rooting for a so called ""dark period"" for you guys! (Consisting of the Springboks being #1 and the ABs #2 - at least for a while). I rather doubt it'll happen, but one can hope... :-)   A parallel could be the Australian cricket team. They were impossibly dominant in the late 90s and much of the 2000s, arguably more dominant than the ABs have been over the last decade. And look at them now. That doesn't seem very likely, though. I swear every year there's another young New Zealand player I've never heard of who sets to rugby world alight."

That kind of dominance is beyond the current Australian team."

I mean I think we still won a tri nations or 2 during the period... and beat most of the touring teams... but was hairier then than now..
rugbyunion,3d5eq1,michedlp,7,Tue Jul 14 13:35:25 2015 UTC,"In 1870, when rugby was first brought here, it was originally played in schools. We didn't have any other sport bar cricket and horse racing (none of those featured so much in the winter), so it just took off, gaining so much popularity that we had made a national team within 14 years. Then, we sent them to Australia on a tour and won every game. So there's the big heart & soul bit.  The reason we're so good is because of the amount of players there are. Hell, in Auckland alone, there's enough world-class players to fill three teams. Quality also comes in the form of Pacific Island immigrants, who have a natural tendency to be good at the sport due to their physical characteristics. Not to mention the rugged farmers who had had enough of sheep. So there's quality.  Since 1905, when the Originals toured the Home Unions, nobody expected a tiny colony of hardly 1 million people to do any better than, say, Canada, who toured Scotland and did shit a few years earlier. Apart from the other small sheep-obsessed nation, we whooped their arses and became a household name in places like Leeds and Glasgow. There were sell-out crowds for almost every game, and England saw a chance to make a huge profit and give none of it to their players, of course.  TL;DR: A perfect blend of soul, skills and stash."

Right now, you go buy whatever shirt you want, pull it on and say you're a supporter. Imagine the only way to do that would be to get one yourself. How much harder would you work to get it? How much harder would you work once you got it, to keep it?

Australian cricket had an incredible period at the top of the world but is now much more evenly matched and often beaten.  I would love to think NZ is having a purple patch - especially with so many big names retiring after this world cup - but looking at the squad depth, i beleive they are destined to be world beaters for a long time to come.

Thats almost as many New Zealanders born in those three Pacific Islands as there are foreign born residents in Wales from every non UK country combined.  Added to that, the likes of Tana Umaga, Julian Savea, Ma'a Nonu, Kevin Mealamu etc aren't included in those statistics because they were born in New Zealand. 60 percent of the Pacific Island population was born in New Zealand.

Vodafone's sponsorship with Manchester United was seamless because the red was already represented - the issue here is whether they'll add it to a shirt that doesn't have it (will look bad) or leave it out (making the logo less recognisable and therefore less valuable). It's not whether the white will go with the green, but whether they'll use the red anyway, like they did with Dublin GAA."

rugbyunion,3d4fj6,ronnierosenthal,2,Mon Jul 13 16:30:10 2015 UTC,"Because rugby fans tend to have more money than average and phone companies are always trying to get at higher-spenders who will pay a premium for tie-ins like privileged access to sporting events, etc."

I mean, yeah, I suppose Sainsbury or the national rail or whoever could take over the sponsorship but it wouldn't fit as  well."

I've seen so many massive props destroyed by smaller, slender, muscular types with good technique.  ... still I guess you're not planning on playing in the front row!  Back when I was young we were a fairly average prepubescent  team and week in week out we were coming up against these huge guys who apparently were our same age (I call bullshit!). Anyway after a year of getting ran over we worked harder and learned how to tackle regardless of our size... it's the old adage, the bigger they come the harder they fall!   Roll on a year the team we lost to 70-0 in the first game of the previous year we drew with 3-3 in the first game of that year, before going on to go undefeated for the season.   Nothing much changed. Granted a couple of guys got bigger but the most of us were the same. The key thing was that we lost the fear and knew how to tackle. We learnt how to utilise space and avoid collisions in attack. Play to our strengths.   If you're keen then don't let your size hold you back. Sure it may not be easy at first and yes and putting a bit of bulk on won't go amiss but concentrate on your technique and hold no fear. You'll only get hurt if you half-ass it... ok you might still get hurt but fk it. It's worth it!"

Neither are out-and-out speedsters (they're not slow though, obviously), but I pick them because they do the basics correctly. Their positioning is great, they never miss tackles, they have good handling, and they work hard for the team. In short, they've made sure that they're committed, technically competent, and hard-working. As such, I've no problems in picking them. One of them was actually up for player of the season, due to his commitment and consistency."

rugbyunion,3d34mm,whiskeyboyo,7,Mon Jul 13 03:36:47 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on Chieka's game plan.  More open running game? Hooper.  More traditional 7 needed? Someone to disrupt the ruck? Consistent turnovers and a solid solid defender? Pocock.  Thing is; both are fit and in form, so Chieka's spoilt for choice really."
rugbyunion,3d34mm,sdre,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:50:26 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think you're set for ball carriers in the pack if you're playing Skelton along with Higgenbotham at 8. I would start Pocock, then bring on Hooper in the latter stages against tired legs."
rugbyunion,3d34mm,Aquapig,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:35:10 2015 UTC,"Thing is, Pocock goes strong for more than 80 mins. I haven't seen him slow down, or seem to catch his breath throughout his entire games. The man's got a mean engine.   Critically, you will want someone to disrupt play and commit players to the ruck to get the extra man on the wing. Hooper coming on, could signal a sign of desperation where play is more broken.   Honestly, I will never sub hooper on pocock simply because Pocock offers more to the modern game. (e.g pilfer, man committed to rucks)  Only reason to sub hooper on would be that pocock is injured.

rugbyunion,3d34mm,muelindustries,2,Mon Jul 13 06:22:28 2015 UTC,Well im an idiot!   Then 2 for Hooper seems a little low then!
rugbyunion,3d34mm,wogmafia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:24:21 2015 UTC,I am thinking that pilfer is for a clean turnover not including a penalty for holding onto the ball on the ground.

rugbyunion,3d34mm,Downandoutinporto,3,Tue Jul 14 19:18:07 2015 UTC,"Why not play both of them? Sacrificing I line out option I guess, especially if Skelton started (which he wouldn't, surely)  but I don't see where else they would lose out? Seems to be more to gain by playing both, and a point of difference."
rugbyunion,3d34mm,douthinkthisisagame,5,Mon Jul 13 09:11:18 2015 UTC,2 lineout options will simply not work at a World Cup
rugbyunion,3d34mm,fettsack,4,Mon Jul 13 09:56:08 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this lineout option argument. You do want a tall thin second row (or Tom Wood style back row) as your front jumper to win the ball with speed and accuracy. The rest of the lineout needs to be more tactical. Both Hooper and Pocock can jump, so can Higginbotham if he's picked at 8.  I keep hearing that you need tall jumpers but that's bullshit. What you need most is a tall back lifter whose entire height is used when the jumper's height only count from the arse up. So a jumper with very long legs isn't going higher than a shorter bloke with the same upper body height."
rugbyunion,3d34mm,douthinkthisisagame,2,Mon Jul 13 10:08:27 2015 UTC,It's not to do with tall jumpers. Hooper hardly ever jumps and pocock does occasionally. Both of them are 2nd tier lineout options.
rugbyunion,3d34mm,strewthcobber,2,Mon Jul 13 11:14:58 2015 UTC,"It's not that they're short (though that doesn't help). It's that they don't do it very much at all. (eg Hooper took 8 lineouts all Super season and Pocock just 4 - and some of those will have been quick and/or unopposed)  Generally you don't want your 7 tied up in the lineout, he needs to be ready for the next breakdown both in attack and defence. So they don't do it and don't have the practiced aerial skill required at the very top level."
rugbyunion,3d34mm,sdre,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:22:12 2015 UTC,"| Generally you don't want your 7 tied up in the lineout, he needs to |be ready for the next breakdown both in attack and defence. So they |don't do it and don't have the practiced aerial skill required at the |very top level.  exactly."
rugbyunion,3d34mm,sdre,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:45:11 2015 UTC,I think in this modern game; the most important lineout option is someone who can coordinate with the hooker and is in sync. I'm at a loss which lock/backrow excels in this (forgive me its 7.45am) but I remember coaches picking specific backrowers just for this.  the line out calls are so important.
rugbyunion,3d34mm,dr_chim_richaldz,0,Mon Jul 13 23:44:20 2015 UTC,"You're exactly right. The height differential is more advantageous when the taller person is lifting. As someone pointed out, McCaw became a regular jumper, so why can't Pocock or Hooper?"
rugbyunion,3d34mm,douthinkthisisagame,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:28:34 2015 UTC,"New Zealand has Retallick, Whitelock and Reid as genuine first choice lineout options with Mccaw as a backup"
rugbyunion,3d34mm,dr_chim_richaldz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:15:53 2015 UTC,"And Australia would still have Higgers/Fardy, Skelton, Simmons. Skelton will jump for the wallabies. He already has for the Tahs. And the fact that he's unexpected as a jumper will come into play during the RC.   Also the height differential. Tall guys lifting short guys have more reach than the reverse."
rugbyunion,3d34mm,douthinkthisisagame,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:21:11 2015 UTC,Skelton is a 2nd tier lineout jumper. I get the height argument it's to do with having a few genuine lineout options. Yes Skelton can jump but he's not a safe option
rugbyunion,3d34mm,ruckovercdn,2,Mon Jul 13 11:49:21 2015 UTC,I actually think Skelton lifting either of them would negate any height issues
rugbyunion,3d34mm,dr_chim_richaldz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"But perhaps it's always been the old way of thinking. I would interested to see someone experimenting with it. You could potentially put the short jumpers out of reach of the taller ones. When I played, I had the tallest players lifting me because I was the lightest forward. Not the tallest. I stole plenty of opposition ball, and easily won my own throw in.   But perhaps it's the old way because it's still the best way."
rugbyunion,3d34mm,amplebooty,2,Mon Jul 13 12:03:56 2015 UTC,"but I don't see where else they would lose out?   They'd be lightweight and under powered for one, without a good enough lineout."

rugbyunion,3d34mm,fettsack,2,Mon Jul 13 09:42:21 2015 UTC,"I like Gill but he seems quite penalty prone to me. So I checked his season stats:  Gill: 14 penalties conceeded in 15 games (of 74min av). Hooper: 16 penalties conceeded in 17 games (of 79min av). Pocock: 9 penalties conceeded in 14 games (of 73min av).  So Pocock is ahead but Gill's on par with Hooper so my instincts were off.

rugbyunion,3d34mm,fettsack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:35:12 2015 UTC,I'd have them the other way around to have Pocock on the ball straight out of the scrums. Hooper's fast so he can get there from the other side of the scrum.

rugbyunion,3d2227,weavin,3,Mon Jul 13 22:47:56 2015 UTC,A few articles from the period of his axing. He was dropped for 'embarassing' the ARU and Deans and his goal kicking was also pretty bad at the time. There was a definite rift with Deans who did more to embarass the ARU than Giteau for sure.   1  2  3

rugbyunion,3d1ja7,Dan0r,15,Sun Jul 12 19:32:01 2015 UTC,"Hallo Leidensgenosse.  Well, there are no TV stations showing rugby regulary in Germany.  The only thing you’ll get this year is 20 matches of the World Cup on Eurosport.  However for Sevens Rugby Europe usually offers official streams on Dailymotion.  And in the ENC 1a (The tournament below the Six Nations) all home games were streamed at a sportdeutschland.tv of the Deutsche Olympische Sportbund.  For regular league games and any other information you’re pretty much left with totalrugby.de and rugby-verband.de. But those only offer text updates.  For any other games in the Aviva Premiership, Pro12, Top14, SuperRugby, ITM, Currie, Tier1 Internationals you’re pretty much left with the streams in the Match Threads and uploads on YouTube/the websites of these competitions. (The English premiership uploads all games with comentary a couple of days after they’ve been played, without score and time indicator tho).  Or just visit your local club for a game.  EDIT And I think there will be at least some sevens shown in the olympics if the guys at ARD/ZDF/Eurosport aren’t complete fuckwit idiots and move those to their online livestreams or paid second channel."

rugbyunion,3d1ja7,ShaneQful,4,Mon Jul 13 11:01:24 2015 UTC,I know when I was in Cologne some of the Irish bars would show the games if you asked to put them on. Although they are mostly full of English people who want to watch the premiership(ugh soccer).
rugbyunion,3d1ja7,ZeSkump,2,Mon Jul 13 00:45:22 2015 UTC,"As /u/ShaneQful said, I would recommend the pubs.  Furthermore, from what I got from my Erasmus in the german puppet city of Maastricht, there are many options. I went a good amount of times in Köln and Aachen, and both of these cities had pubs where you couuld ask them to play a specific channel.  The best option IMO though remains to get in touch with your local club, so 1/ they might know where, and 2/ you can be a big enough number to book bars for the events.  Good luck !"
rugbyunion,3d1ja7,patrick_k,2,Mon Jul 13 08:14:22 2015 UTC,"Hey Irish lad in Frankfurt here. If you are in Frankfurt, check out O'Reilly's Irish pub near Hauptbahnhof. One of the only places I can think of that shows games (6 Nations from the BBC). Also great atmosphere for the games with fans from all over Europe. The Anglo Irish in Alt-Sachsenhausen also had rugby on in the past when I was there.   There's also a guide to online streaming in the wiki, or failing that a VPN + BBC iPlayer/RTE Player is also a decent option."

rugbyunion,3d0ivg,Shadowing_Lemma,4,Sun Jul 12 15:20:28 2015 UTC,"I will say, I like the flow of how the Match Threads have always been. People comment the most during a lull in play, like at scrum time or try time or what have you, but if something particularly good happens a flurry of comments will always follow that. And an problem I can see occurring with irc, which although present in what we have already isn't quite so bad, is how staggered comments will be on the same event being followed by people watching via different sources. Whether our standard shitty streams, Acestream or live on the Tele, the sync is off  between lots of users. I think irc chat might exacerbate the issue."
rugbyunion,3d0ivg,WallopyJoe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:17:51 2015 UTC,"Possibly right I was comparing my experience on the HD YouTube stream which was consistent for all I suppose.

rugbyunion,3cyi71,Bigeasy600,28,Sat Jul 11 23:37:18 2015 UTC,"There must be an attempt at wrapping the arms, otherwise it's usually deemed a shoulder charge, which is illegal in union."
rugbyunion,3cyi71,Lolliprop,5,Sat Jul 11 23:38:46 2015 UTC,Illegal in any code of rugby since last year.
rugbyunion,3cyi71,frakturfreak,17,Sun Jul 12 16:59:09 2015 UTC,Law 10.4 (g) Dangerous charging. A player must not charge or knock down an opponent carrying the ball without trying to grasp that player.
rugbyunion,3cyi71,strewthcobber,11,Sun Jul 12 00:25:33 2015 UTC,"Basically, yes. He didn't wrap, therefore he didn't tackle, therefore it's a foul."
rugbyunion,3cyi71,savois-faire,3,Sat Jul 11 23:40:32 2015 UTC,The reason he would've got carded is not because of the lack of arms (which is a penalty) but because of the 'grass cut' (shoulder charge to the knees) is considered extremely dangerous.
rugbyunion,3cyi71,The_Orgasmo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:46:03 2015 UTC,"It looked to me like a roll into the shins.  Also, it's at the very least, unusual to tackle with your shoulder blades."
rugbyunion,3cyi71,BobMacActual,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:53:36 2015 UTC,So did he get carded? Because honestly that was pretty bad.
rugbyunion,3cyi71,M15CH13F,6,Sun Jul 12 06:01:04 2015 UTC,"He got yellow. It's in the title, just not the colour."
rugbyunion,3cyi71,AndydaAlpaca,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:47:40 2015 UTC,"It's alright for us to do that in American football. I remember my second game of rugby ever. I was 16 in high school and we were playing a men's team in the area. I did this to a giant Hawaiian prop. Guy had to be 130 kgs no joke. I got up and everyone was staring at me because he was slow to get up. I ended up connecting my shoulder with his knee. I only got a yellow card, but the embarrassment was enough to keep me from ever going that low again."
rugbyunion,3cyi71,003_,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:07:08 2015 UTC,imo if you look at the slowed down part at his right arm it seems like he was trying to wrap but the runner smashed into him
rugbyunion,3cyi71,IamJordan21,15,Sun Jul 12 04:09:34 2015 UTC,I'll take two of what this guy is drinking/smoking.

rugbyunion,3cyi71,A_MightyBiscuit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:49:45 2015 UTC,That tackle is illegal at most levels of american football too
rugbyunion,3cyi71,jqpeub,-11,Sun Jul 12 13:19:21 2015 UTC,"Dangerous and dirty, hope he gets suspended"
rugbyunion,3cyi71,batzman,7,Sun Jul 12 04:01:47 2015 UTC,"Oh please. It's a yellow, not worth a suspension"
rugbyunion,3cyi71,ptashark,0,Sun Jul 12 04:45:22 2015 UTC,Player could have landed on head and broken neck. Just as dangerous as a tip tackle.
rugbyunion,3cyi71,batzman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:59:29 2015 UTC,"Player could shatter a ein and puncture a lung with a normal tackle as well. Biggest issue with that tackle was the no arms thing, and I've seen quite a few guys tackle like this. I don't like it, but a yellow is punishment enough."
rugbyunion,3cy553,skeeter1980,19,Sat Jul 11 20:56:33 2015 UTC,I know it was only against a thrown together team but SA looked excellent there.
rugbyunion,3cy553,the_ugly_judge,5,Sat Jul 11 22:23:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I watched some of the game and they looked so much more clinical than the ABs did against Samoa. Got me a little worried, but I think the ABs'll come right."
rugbyunion,3cy553,fernta,6,Sun Jul 12 02:00:41 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't read too much into that Samoa game. Tbh Samoa are an absolutely brutal team and any team would've had a hard day out there.   Springbok backs looking much more dangerous than last year going from these highlights. De Allende looks to be a real find, and Pollard's running game is threatening. Must be said that 'World XV' looked rather shit though!"
rugbyunion,3cy553,NZGrade,2,Sun Jul 12 02:04:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the young guys were on fire. Schalk Burger was in the mix too, pretty awesome how good of a comeback he has made"
rugbyunion,3cy553,down_ranger,11,Sat Jul 11 22:34:43 2015 UTC,Do they just forget how to tackle when not with their normal team? Or are they trying to save themselves from injury?
rugbyunion,3cy553,Jeester,8,Sat Jul 11 22:45:59 2015 UTC,Just lack of defensive cohesiveness. They won't have worked together for long so it would be so much easier to find a little gap or a softer shoulder.
rugbyunion,3cy553,phar0aht,2,Sun Jul 12 00:45:05 2015 UTC,"More the latter I think. This an opportunity for SA players to make an impression right before the start of the test season, whereas World XV was just out having a bit of fun really."
rugbyunion,3cy553,LegendxFundz,11,Sun Jul 12 00:42:03 2015 UTC,Does anybody else think its crazy that De Villiers is back playing Test rugby not even a year after he dislocated his knee. I mean he did look a little slow when he got that ball but it still astounds me that he is recovered enough to be confident in playing full contact at the Test level. I've hurt my knee with more minor injuries than that and I'm still not sure if it could handle playing test rugby!
rugbyunion,3cy553,zimprop,3,Sun Jul 12 02:28:16 2015 UTC,There's actually a full documentary series on his recovery process up on YouTube if you are interested.
rugbyunion,3cy553,definatlynotabear,2,Sun Jul 12 06:21:46 2015 UTC,Do you mean this?
rugbyunion,3cy553,k726xah,3,Sun Jul 12 06:46:54 2015 UTC,"Skip to Part 2. Part 1 is basically half an hour of all the angles and description of the injury, it's horrendous."
rugbyunion,3cy553,fettsack,6,Sun Jul 12 10:25:42 2015 UTC,The support lines that the South Africans were running there were superb.  Looking forward to watching Le Roux play this world cup
rugbyunion,3cy553,longjohntaller,3,Sat Jul 11 22:17:30 2015 UTC,le Roux running on for Habana was great. He knew he was coming too
rugbyunion,3cy553,ValentiaIsland,6,Sun Jul 12 07:00:22 2015 UTC,"What I got from watching this as a Bok fan:  Positives :   Backs in most key positions really  impressed me. Pollard, le Roux, de Allende, even Pienaar. Yes Pollard made mistakes as well (kicking), but he looks better than we've had at fly half for a very long time. He could be one of the greats.  We're running into space, the game plan looks to be coming together.    Negatives :   Scrums are still a big worry. Time to make the call on replacing Jannie now I think, so his replacement has time to settle before the World Cup. Don't give him more opportunities and then change just before the WC.  It looks like the plan at outside centre is Jean deV with Kriel as backup if Jacques Fourie stays fat and unfit. I'm worried that we don't have a standout specialist outside centre.  We really need Duane at 8 for the WC. Not because Whiteley was bad, but Duane is on a level with Kieran Read, and we need that. Schalk is a great backup though."
rugbyunion,3cy553,ricoza,3,Sun Jul 12 08:06:28 2015 UTC,"Jannie is a walking penalty machine, he's got to go."
rugbyunion,3cy553,scamper2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:42:22 2015 UTC,"problem is just who can replace him. we don't have a lot of people who can play his position. he's improved his game off the ball in my opinion, he's been making more tackles (or trying to) and become more useful during open play.  i want us to sort our backline out and let the players sink into position now. i don't think pollard is up to the pressure and we're not doing ourselves favours by mixing players and positions up every game. and we need to work on our tactical kicking. im so sick of useless box kicks. if ruan pienaar gets the ball at the back of a maul or scrum theres a 90% chance of a useless box kick. i have nothing against it if there aren't other options, but just make sure there aren't other options first. reinach would be my starting pick.  damien de allende is kicking ass and taking names. i was swearing at him when we played against him in super rugby but in the green and gold he's awesome.   agreed that we need duane back. thor brings a major impact to the game although whiteley is a good sub."
rugbyunion,3cy553,spacemanza,9,Mon Jul 13 07:11:38 2015 UTC,Why do they even bother with a world 15? You would think a world 15 would be the best players in the world rather then a bunch of randoms thrown together on a pitch. Would much rather a proper test playing nation up against the Springboks.
rugbyunion,3cy553,batzman,13,Sat Jul 11 23:01:55 2015 UTC,World 15 minus South Africa. Minus any current player in a world cup squad.   I heard Mike Harris name in there. No where near top player in Australia. Let alone the world.
rugbyunion,3cy553,birdy9221,2,Sat Jul 11 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"Haha yea exactly, seems pretty pointless. The dregs of rugby thrown together"
rugbyunion,3cy553,batzman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:09:40 2015 UTC,No international players
rugbyunion,3cy553,douthinkthisisagame,8,Sun Jul 12 09:25:06 2015 UTC,"South Africa needed a game to get them going, and since we aren't as spoiled as you lot with Samoa and Fiji around the corner, and it's a little difficult getting a NH team for a single game. So it makes sense."
rugbyunion,3cy553,ptashark,4,Sun Jul 12 04:31:53 2015 UTC,Ja next time let's play Zim.
rugbyunion,3cy553,I_Gets_The_Reference,3,Sun Jul 12 09:37:27 2015 UTC,"in all fairness, this XV squad has 8 current Toulon players"

rugbyunion,3cy553,sdre,4,Sun Jul 12 00:11:09 2015 UTC,Looks like SA Vs Toulon to me :3  inb4 toulon buys the entire SA team for their next season

rugbyunion,3cy553,saviouroftheweak,8,Mon Jul 13 09:11:32 2015 UTC,So an international side at the peak of a World Cup cycle against the equivalent of a mid table club side and the commentators couldn't love it any harder.  EDIT: I know it's their jobs but England thrashed the 'Barbarians and I berated Barnes equally for over egging the significance of it.

rugbyunion,3cy553,grootes,3,Sun Jul 12 09:10:45 2015 UTC,Kriel at 13 was very positive! He can definitely develop into a great outside centre.

It is also neat that the 1977 Fiji team was coached by my father. I will put in the email, 'Now I am CEO you best come and beat my team, because my father's team beat you'.  ""We will have our day! The Lions should know that Fiji is the only country they haven't beaten! It should be a bee in their bonnet. Our message to the Lions is, 'You can pass us by, but you will have to come back here one day, to redeem yourselves! You can't run forever!'.""   That's awesome, really bold move by a tier 2 nation too.  I'd like to see a little more of these rivalries develop.  ANZ Stadium was a lot nicer than Apia Park too, I'd definitely like to see more big name teams go to Fiji."
rugbyunion,3cy856,marmitechips,8,Sun Jul 12 00:59:28 2015 UTC,Did he only just ask now? Its probably something he should have been asking as soon as NZ were announced as hosts. Plus the additional cost to the team and the touring fans probably make such a thing prohibitively expensive.
rugbyunion,3cy856,J0nShannow,-20,Sat Jul 11 22:36:07 2015 UTC,Other nations really need to step up and follow the All Blacks lead in visiting island nations.

rugbyunion,3ct99u,MajorLeeScrewed,5,Fri Jul 10 18:50:00 2015 UTC,They had every opportunity to get momentum behind them but got themselves flat footed and also used terrible technique
rugbyunion,3ct99u,batzman,-3,Fri Jul 10 19:50:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so does that not make the play less impressive?"
rugbyunion,3ct99u,MajorLeeScrewed,13,Fri Jul 10 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily it makes the Samoans  less impressive not the attacker, if he's good enough to exploit their poor defense then good on him."

You can either read this article as look at all the change Beale has made (Edit: he hasn't thus making it a shitty puff piece) or as i read it look at the potential (as person not player) he has he just needs to realise it himself."
rugbyunion,3cupb5,truehoneybadger,3,Sat Jul 11 01:58:24 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he gets sap pieces written about him whenever something controversial happens.   My guess is that he'll be picked for the South African even after his shocking year."
rugbyunion,3cupb5,It_Is_Known,7,Sat Jul 11 05:46:54 2015 UTC,"Like it or not, he's a role model. There's no indigenous presence in rugby union. And when there has been, they've been unbelievable players.   Beale has had stuff to deal with, and it comes from an addictive nature within a large percentage of indigenous Australians. The temptation to give in, considering the opportunities available to him on any night out, would be immense.   Anyone who has spent any time around aboriginal families or communities will be aware that Kurtley would not be his own man. He'd have the pressure of supporting many family members (not dissimilar in the way a lot of PI players do), coupled with the resistance to constant temptation.   He's done some things I disagree with, no doubt, but it's pretty easy to look at it on face value and write the guy off. Maybe he is just a cunt? But I can't imagine so many teammates standing up for him if he didn't have some substance to his character."

Specifically, certain dispositions."

Saia and Anthony Fainga’a of Tongan and Aboriginal descent were born on 2nd February 1987 in Queanbeyan, New South Wales, where they started playing rugby league as five year olds with the Queanbeyan Kangaroos. From a young age it was evident that the twins were something special. Not only were they at least a head taller than any other kid on the field but they were determined and loved playing together."
rugbyunion,3cupb5,strewthcobber,4,Sat Jul 11 12:23:56 2015 UTC,"You're totally right. They're of Tongan descent too. My mistake. Although Kurtley has a more immediate connection to his heritage, which is fairly obvious in his appearance."
rugbyunion,3cupb5,dr_chim_richaldz,4,Sat Jul 11 12:33:57 2015 UTC,Is he a cunt or is he just a bit thick? Impression I've always got of him is that he's your typical sports star whose talent takes him a long way and makes up for his lack of brains. Just he's had a few more personal problems than his fellow idiots.

Even when he's doing bad there may be some good; his $45,000 fine from the Di Patston texting scandal went to the Lloyd McDermott Development Team, Australian rugby's indigenous talent unit.   If he wanted to be a good bloke and donate money to the development team, couldn't he have just done that and not have a go at Di? I get that they are trying to show he has strong values for his indigenous heritage and that's okay, but they should have worded it... I don't know, better than that. It comes across (to me) as a pathetic justification for what he did when I imagine they just couldn't think of a better way to bring it up. Seems like lazy writing."
rugbyunion,3cupb5,jbarbz,-12,Sat Jul 11 02:10:45 2015 UTC,"I can only reason that he's selected in the 'Tahs and Wallabies because the talent pool in Australia is at its absolute nadir. Also, nice to see Australian inherent racism coming through in the name of his birthplace."

As a Welshman, I'm disappointed that Adam Jones didn't make the list - for several years he was truly world class, probably the best in the world when it came to scrummaging at one point, and I'm not sure a successful team has relied so heavily on the tighthead being fit.

rugbyunion,3cs2o8,arsebiscuits1,6,Fri Jul 10 09:42:08 2015 UTC,I agree while I think it would be foolish to make him stay I think the ARU should pay if they want him released. He did sign a three year contract and Leinster lined their ducks up based on that.
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,MethylRed,4,Fri Jul 10 09:48:28 2015 UTC,"To be fair the ARU didn't sign the contract, Douglas did, it's not up to them."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,cubeyescube,4,Fri Jul 10 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"They are the ones requesting him be released from the contract so he can return to the ARU. I assume it would be the same in any sport. If the new employer wants a player out of contract, they foot the buy out fee."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,Thelomen_Toblakai,3,Fri Jul 10 16:36:14 2015 UTC,"I suppose the analogy would be when Northampton signed George North. North officially bought out his own contract, but in practice Northampton paid him to buy it out, because otherwise it wouldn't have been worth his while."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,ronnierosenthal,3,Sat Jul 11 00:52:13 2015 UTC,"Oh by all means, let him go - but there has to be compensation.   He left Australia to earn money, he came to Leinster on a three year contract, he hasn't performed (for various, understandable reasons) in his first season and is now called up to the RWC squad for Australia.   Rightly put Leinster said they expect him back or to be compensated. After that's rejected, he's homesick. It's a bit odd, though I don't mind if he leaves, Leinster's entitled to be compensated."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,oncewerelawyers,6,Fri Jul 10 09:46:39 2015 UTC,"The issue is, it's an employment contract, so if you want out, you'll get out of it. No Australian court would ever hold up a contract with a non compete from a different country. It's a restraint of trade."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,ronnierosenthal,7,Fri Jul 10 14:15:06 2015 UTC,"No Australian court would ever hold up a contract with a non compete from a different country. It's a restraint of trade.   Well his contract's not in Australia. Besides, the issue wouldn't be whether he can sign another contract (he can), it's whether he can sign another contract and have it approved by World Rugby (they won't).  Even if were to come down to legalities, signing the contract with Reds would effectively invalidate his contract with Leinster, so there would be a penalty to be paid, though I suppose he could escape it by never signing another contract in Europe."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,0_kelvin_ballsack,4,Sat Jul 11 00:54:11 2015 UTC,That sort of attitude is exactly what the ARU would love to see. The value of Aussie players in Europe and elsewhere would drop dramatically if they can just piss off out contracts on a whim. I believe he is contracted therefore on the books of leinster. Which means he cannot be signed by another team. They need to release his contract or he can't sign for anyone else. If he did I believe the recipient team would be on the hook for the termination of contract cost.
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,oncewerelawyers,4,Fri Jul 10 16:10:54 2015 UTC,"Just reporting facts mate. Not sure what the WR contracting rules are, but Australian employment law would have no issue with him coming to the Reds and breaking his Leinster contract without any break cost.   I don't believe it's the right thing to do, but hey, that what the restraint of trade laws say."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,CaisLaochach,3,Fri Jul 10 16:16:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's true - we're dealing with different jurisdictions and laws.   He and every other player in Europe is fully in their right to board a plane and leave, there are reasons why they don't.   This is why the situation is problematic, it could set a very bad precedent in Rugby Union."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,reddititis,2,Fri Jul 10 16:22:35 2015 UTC,"Sports law has moved on a bit since the Bosman debacle.

rugbyunion,3cs2o8,arsebiscuits1,2,Sun Jul 12 08:51:40 2015 UTC,"How so? Hasn't worked out for him there, what if no other team wants to pay for his exit? What's he supposed to do? Be jobless for two years? What would you want if you were in his situation? Douglas and his wife have a baby on the way.  Things didn't work out. Happens all the time in footy. If it is true he wants out, how is it that Leinster can justify holding him back?  Why do you guys deserve compensation anyway?"
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,BullNiro,8,Fri Jul 10 15:40:21 2015 UTC,"Primarily for breach on contract. He signed on for 2 more years. He understood the consequences of signing a legal document detailing his terms of employment for this amount of time. He declared intent to go long after it was an option for Leinster to find a pound for pound replacement who was as good as him.   As a result it is looking like we will not have lock cover during the World Cup, which was a huge reason he was kept on, this will have a direct influence on our results and our overall income next year.  Also ""compensation"" is a fancy word for ""buying him out of his contract"" it is standard in all walks of life for money to change hands when a contract is broken. No need to get uppedy about it"
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,arsebiscuits1,4,Fri Jul 10 15:56:59 2015 UTC,Every Leinster fan I have talked to have told me about how shite they think he is.
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,reddititis,2,Sat Jul 11 07:02:35 2015 UTC,Depends how you look at it all. Yes he underperformed. But so did literally every player all season for Leinster. His poor play I put exclusively down to shitty management.
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,ronnierosenthal,2,Sat Jul 11 17:24:21 2015 UTC,"Ah he wasn't so shite, just things aren't going well for us and he isn't a brad thorn/Hines. Devon toner got the same shit, when you're that tall you stand out and every little mistake is obvious, he hit a shit ton of rucks and was a gangly monster great at scragging the ball carrier in the maul plus pretty decent in the scrum. Not overly mobile and average hands."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,0_kelvin_ballsack,4,Sun Jul 12 08:58:48 2015 UTC,"How so? Hasn't worked out for him there, what if no other team wants to pay for his exit? What's he supposed to do? Be jobless for two years?   He's not jobless. He has a job with Leinster that Leinster have to pay him for, as long as he turns up."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,cubeyescube,6,Sat Jul 11 00:57:27 2015 UTC,The contract works both ways. If Leinster wanted him to leave they'd be paying through the nose. It sets an ideal precedent for the ARU if he gets to leave for nothing.
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,0_kelvin_ballsack,4,Fri Jul 10 09:58:44 2015 UTC,Why should the ARU have to pay if Douglas is seeking leave to go back to Australia on compassionate grounds?
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,ronnierosenthal,10,Fri Jul 10 15:49:37 2015 UTC,He's breaching his contract to sign with the reds so he can play in the WC. Shoe on the other foot if he was asked to leave he'd want his contract bought out. Compassionate grounds would be believable if the new rules for Wallabies qualification hadn't been drafted only a number of weeks ago. Also he could have mentioned this way sooner than now. Seems like they are using the compassionate grounds line to hamstring Leinster and negate their request for compensation. He is the one who is breaking contract. Not Leinster. We now have no time to find a replacement. It's an appalling way to treat a club that signed you for 3 years in good faith.
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,monsterChomper,3,Fri Jul 10 16:02:39 2015 UTC,"Because that's what it will take to have his contract cancelled so he can go back and benefit Australian rugby. The ARU can call him up for the RWC if they want, but if they want to abide by their own rules they'll need to negotiate a release from his Leinster contract, and for that they'll have to pay for Leinster's losses."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,ronnierosenthal,6,Sat Jul 11 00:48:58 2015 UTC,Would he get anywhere near the Wallabies? He has been absolutely shite for Leinster
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,pickledpeas,4,Fri Jul 10 16:48:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, he has 14 Test caps with Australia, he played for the Waratahs under Cheika as they won the Super Rugby title from 2014 and was in his favour.   Now Cheika is the Head Coach of Australia and he approached Kane in Dublin last Autumn, during which meeting he was rebuffed being told by Kane that he wished to see out his contract at Leinster.   This is the second time Cheika is looking to bring him home, so yes, he would definitely have a starting position in the Wallaby team. Cheika would not kick up such a huge storm for him if he didn't.  Kane had no break between the SH season and his start at Leinster, he had an injury towards the end of the season and was playing for Leinster at the lowest point in our team's record for the last 11 years. He didn't have a good season and seemed very timid, but he has the skill and ability. I feel he lacked the motivation in the last year."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,0ffice_Zombie,3,Fri Jul 10 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"Playing lock for Australia is far more suited to Kane than playing in Ireland. Less physical work, more running around on the wing looking pretty."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,BullNiro,3,Sat Jul 11 01:01:40 2015 UTC,"With Ben Marshall gone and Kane's apparent departure Leinster are going to have some issues at lock.  Best of Luck to Kane though, can't begrudge a man for wanting to play for his country."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,ronnierosenthal,3,Fri Jul 10 11:40:48 2015 UTC,He made the decision to come to Leinster knowing full well he may be giving up hopes of international rugby. Not sure I'd have much sympathy for him from that angle.
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,thegreycity,2,Fri Jul 10 13:10:41 2015 UTC,But imagine if you got offered the opportunity after being told your career was over? As though you wouldn't jump at it.  Really he shouldn't have left it so late though. I hope it works out with Leinster getting comp'd but not for maybe half the amount that we're looking at right now.
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,0ffice_Zombie,3,Sat Jul 11 07:06:23 2015 UTC,"Despite lock being a weak position at the moment, he wouldn't be as big a loss as you would expect. That is, if we're adequately compensated."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,ronnierosenthal,3,Fri Jul 10 09:02:37 2015 UTC,"Moloney's showed more in a handful of games than Kane has in a full season. Him, Mike Mac and maybe a ringer who didn't make the Argentinian World Cup squad or something, be grand."
rugbyunion,3cs2o8,reddititis,3,Sat Jul 11 01:06:03 2015 UTC,"Yea, cut him lose, get the compensation for breaking the contract. Annoying that he has left it until July to decide this, if he'd done it earlier we could have prepared for it a bit at least. ""Compassionate grounds"" bollocks to that."

rugbyunion,3crtbv,phar0aht,14,Thu Jul 16 02:23:33 2015 UTC,For me Daly should not only be in the squad but get a bench spot to. With Farrell covering 10+12 Daly can then cover the whole of the rest of the backline.   I don't want to see JJ forced out to the wing again when a back 3 member goes off and we've only got Farrell and 36/Burrell on the bench.   I fear he's destined to be one of those great club players who never get a shout at the top level.   Still maybe this leaves a bench spot open for Slade??

rugbyunion,3cr6mz,R8_D8_8_ATE_M8,2,Fri Jul 10 16:37:30 2015 UTC,"Well he's had a horribly super rugby season, before that he walked out of the wallabies and got dropped by the team and nearly got his contract ripped. Even though he played well in Toulon he needs to prove he still deserves to be in the squad and he didn't this season but he will probably get in the squad when he's healthy any way."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,Morfee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:38:14 2015 UTC,"Do SH nations always call the front row ""tight forwards"", and second row ""loose forwards""? I'm always so confused when NZ commentary is on. ""Second five-eighth, the fuck?"""
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,Flys_Lo,5,Fri Jul 10 10:07:45 2015 UTC,"Tight Forwards comes from ""Tight 5"" in a scrum. Loose forwards is the back row.  The 5/8th thing is just NZ, and comes from league."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,_antipodean_,3,Fri Jul 10 10:17:32 2015 UTC,and comes from league.   Ah no. The term pre-dates league and comes from when New Zealand added a player between the half back and three quarter (modern day centre). Being erudite chaps that logically became the five-eighth.
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,marmitechips,2,Sat Jul 11 06:20:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, I've always wondered about that, and never knew!  Edit: always wondered, but never googled.  Looked it up, but thanks for providing the post that gave an answer and the incentive to google it!"

rugbyunion,3cr6mz,yourgrandmasteaparty,10,Sat Jul 11 07:32:09 2015 UTC,Surprised Lealo was left out. I thought he was much better this Super season.
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,projone,7,Fri Jul 10 04:14:01 2015 UTC,Wasn't he supposed to be one of the few players that started every game of the season (and performed)?
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,yourgrandmasteaparty,5,Fri Jul 10 04:16:38 2015 UTC,That's what I read. Played an insane amount of minutes and was essential for the Brumbies defensive line.
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,leach89,4,Fri Jul 10 04:21:52 2015 UTC,What's that!? You want a number 10 that can tackle?? What is this 2003!?   In all seriousness though it's insane Beale is in the side and Lealo isn't.
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,anticsrugby,4,Fri Jul 10 10:50:15 2015 UTC,"Lilo doesn't cover fullback (no, I don't support Beale playing there) and his other positions are the most crowded in the camp right now.  It was inevitable that one of Toomua/Giteau/Lilo was going to miss out.  Appears that Cooper will be starting at 10 and the Cooper/Toomua combination is pretty proven. Giteau offers a similar play style to Lilo but can tentatively cover halfback should shit totally hit the fan and has a much better % from the kicking tee."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,ObiWanCobi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:06:18 2015 UTC,"what makes you think Cooper will start over Foley, has there been any indication?  I thought Foley was the man moving forward"
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,anticsrugby,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:33:05 2015 UTC,Cooper has been the flyhalf getting first team reps the entirety of training camp.
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,ObiWanCobi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:35:40 2015 UTC,"cool thanks, that's exciting I've always been a huge fan of his.  Foley's a solid player but I feel like that's really all you can say about him solid and safe.  Cooper on the other hand can be the best 10 in the world on his day (its been a long time since we've seen that though) or he could lose you the match, lets hope he regains that pre 2011 injury form"
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,anticsrugby,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:39:59 2015 UTC,Agreed on all points (although I'd be pretty damn happy with 2013 Bledisloe/EOYT form too!)

rugbyunion,3cr6mz,mikehunnt,22,Fri Jul 10 03:02:54 2015 UTC,"Cummins, cut like a gypsie's jail sentence."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,shulzi,6,Fri Jul 10 06:43:02 2015 UTC,Looks like most cuts were pretty obvious. Palu I assume is being rested. Notable inclusions seem to be Naiyavarouo and Mumm
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,anticsrugby,5,Fri Jul 10 03:13:00 2015 UTC,"Palu hasn't been doing contact work at training so shock horror, may be injured."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,Pinstripe819,3,Fri Jul 10 11:05:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, all pretty reasonable. Hanson and Kerevi are probably the closest to breaking back into the squad. If Genia doesn't find his top form I'd expect White to get another crack. Holmes had an amazing season and fairly leapfrogged Faulkner."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,projone,8,Fri Jul 10 03:22:55 2015 UTC,"Disappointed Kerevi didn't get a chance, and thought Lealo would have been given the nod. Don't quite understand Mumm and Horwill though?"
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,shulzi,7,Fri Jul 10 04:03:22 2015 UTC,Cheik's experimenting still. I suspect the rugby championship will be focused on experimenting and cohesiveness more than wins
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,cubeyescube,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:00:20 2015 UTC,Cohesiveness I guess. Building a strong team atmosphere.
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,projone,8,Fri Jul 10 06:25:41 2015 UTC,"So now we play ""Pick your starting 15""     Slipper  Moore  Holmes  Simmons  Skelton  McMahon/Fardy  Pocock  Higginbotham  Genia  Cooper  Horne  Giteau  Kuridrani  Mitchell  Folau   Not too sure about the bench, but I'd have Hooper, Naiyarovoro and Toomua to come on against tired legs.  Edited: Added Holmes to No.3"
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,flendors,5,Fri Jul 10 04:10:16 2015 UTC,Sio is a loosehead. Kepu or Holmes at 3. Also Fardy>McMahon.
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,white_falcon,4,Fri Jul 10 05:43:15 2015 UTC,Does McMahon jump? If not they're limited to 2 jumpers unless they decide to lift skelton
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,rugbyfiend,4,Fri Jul 10 05:09:30 2015 UTC,Pretty sure I've seen Skelton jumping at a Tahs match this year.

Think he will be taken to the WC though as an option at 6, and also to cover at 7 for the smaller games to give Hooper and/or Pocock a rest."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,cape7,2,Fri Jul 10 06:29:35 2015 UTC,All three backrow players could probably go up if they had to. McCaw has turned into a top option the last couple seasons after never doing it for the first part of his career.

rugbyunion,3cr6mz,GreatJusticeForSGU,2,Fri Jul 10 04:27:10 2015 UTC,I suppose there was no point to bringing Giteau and Mitchell back now if we weren't going to start them but it's very hard on Toomua and Tomane as they have been playing well this year.  Now is the time to find out if Giteau and Mitchell are playing well enough though.
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,projone,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:36:23 2015 UTC,"Now is the time to find out if Giteau and Mitchell are playing well enough though.   I'd probably pick this for the Springboks, then depending how it goes start looking at options for Toomua/Tomane."

Played no rugby in the last 2 years, and in the few wallabies games he played last year he really wasn't impressive. The only good game he had since his return this year was against the lowest ranked team in Super rugby. Foley has been the form five-eight in super rugby for the last two years. He has led the stats sheet in almost every facet of the game amongst five eighths, well ahead of Beauden Barrett and Lima Sopoaga."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,anticsrugby,2,Fri Jul 10 10:49:28 2015 UTC,"Foley has been the form five-eight in super rugby for the last two years.

rugbyunion,3cr6mz,Son_of_Coco,7,Fri Jul 10 22:13:17 2015 UTC,So is Naiyaravoro staying or going?
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,cubeyescube,6,Fri Jul 10 03:41:25 2015 UTC,"I'd say he was probably still going - given that Glasgow seem to think so. However, so is Genia, Higginbotham, Horwill, Cooper (probably) and Kepu. Giteau and Mitchell will not be playing next year, either."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,Son_of_Coco,6,Fri Jul 10 04:13:26 2015 UTC,Its hard to keep up with all the back and forth regarding his contract. I could be wrong but isn't there a clause stipulating that if he gets a Wallabies cap he can pull out of the Glasgow deal?
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,cubeyescube,3,Fri Jul 10 04:21:45 2015 UTC,That was the press but it is hard to know really. Not sure if it was a rumour or a fact. Glasgow seem pretty sure he will be playing for them. I personally hope not!
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,FrenchyFungus,2,Fri Jul 10 04:27:15 2015 UTC,"Glasgow have denied that: http://www.planetrugby.com/story/0,25883,3551_59539,00.html"
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,krakkerz,2,Fri Jul 10 08:17:52 2015 UTC,My understanding is that the clause was in the Edinburgh contract that he backed out of before the Glasgow offer.
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,Shadowing_Lemma,2,Fri Jul 10 08:21:20 2015 UTC,Is there any substance to the rumour that Genia wants out of his move?
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,RedNave,2,Fri Jul 10 09:09:32 2015 UTC,"He's coming, it was confirmed that contract had no such provision that an Aussie cap let him out of the contract.  If he isn't coming, well then the ARU better be ready to offer us a lot of compensation."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,flendors,4,Fri Jul 10 09:57:52 2015 UTC,"The Squad will need an extra prop and hooker at the World Cup (and maybe another halfback), so I would say that at some point another outside back and a backrower/lock will be cut."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,darthreallynasty,2,Fri Jul 10 05:50:28 2015 UTC,Beale + McMahon or Arnold
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,krakkerz,4,Fri Jul 10 06:48:22 2015 UTC,"Here's where I think this is going. Not that I would do this, myself.....   Slipper Moore Kepu Simmons Skelton Fardy Hooper McCalman Genia Cooper Tomane Toomua Kuridrani AAC Folau TPN Sio Holmes Arnold Mumm Higginbotham or Pocock Giteau Beale   I think Cheika likes a 6-2 split with two locks, one of whom can cover 6. The loose forward spot could go to either Higgers or Pocock, depending on the situation. I suspect Pocock for the Boks.  The backline is largely the incumbent one from last year with Cooper and Genia in the halves. I think Giteau covers 9, 10, 12 while Beale will be the outside backs replacement.  As I said, not how I'd necessarily do it, but I thinks it's what we;ll see."

rugbyunion,3cr6mz,krakkerz,4,Fri Jul 10 08:20:31 2015 UTC,"Much as I agree with you on Hooper and AAC, I just don't think they'll be left out. They are the vice-captains."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,sackrace,7,Fri Jul 10 08:22:55 2015 UTC,"What I hate is we won't play AAC in his favoured position, but will insist on having him on the park, so we end up with a centre who was once a wing taking a specialist wing players place.  I like AAC, but ffs play him at 13 if you're going to play him."
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,Coffee12345,6,Fri Jul 10 08:51:55 2015 UTC,Kuridrani is way better
rugbyunion,3cr6mz,sackrace,3,Fri Jul 10 10:05:52 2015 UTC,"He certainly was last year at least. I'm not saying play AAC as first choice 13, just that he should be played as a 13 and not a wing. If Kuridrani warrants selection over AAC, then he should be on the bench or not in the match day 23."

rugbyunion,3cqbix,amplebooty,2,Thu Jul 9 22:43:31 2015 UTC,That's a grueling fixture list.
rugbyunion,3cqbix,fishboy2000,5,Fri Jul 10 05:41:28 2015 UTC,I'm soooooo excited about this!!! as the team photographer for the Northland Taniwha and part time Event photographer for Toll Staduim I better be getting sideline for the first match of the tour!
rugbyunion,3cqbix,mikehunnt,7,Fri Jul 10 05:50:18 2015 UTC,Can I carry your film for you?
rugbyunion,3cqbix,fishboy2000,3,Fri Jul 10 06:20:27 2015 UTC,I'll need to see your resume
rugbyunion,3cqbix,mikehunnt,12,Fri Jul 10 06:56:59 2015 UTC,"I, um, taught John Kirwan everything he knows about coaching. I have been Nick Cummins elocution and grammar tutor. I was  Matt Dunnings dietician and drop kick inspiration.  I did a brief stint as Chris Ashton's modesty mentor. I was Bakkies Botha's anger management counselor. Did a bit of hairdressing for Chabal."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,fishboy2000,3,Fri Jul 10 09:58:59 2015 UTC,You're in!
rugbyunion,3cqbix,HMFCalltheway,7,Fri Jul 10 20:32:20 2015 UTC,"I know this might annoy a few Kiwis but I would have preferred a schedule where the Lions played either Fiji, Samoa or a Pacific Islanders side rather than a provincial union side. One of these sides would likely be stronger opposition than the provincial team and it would be a huge event for the islands. This may not be the biggest money spinner though so they may have to play in NZ to meet commercial targets.   If making money is a major aim though the Lions could have stopped off in Tokyo, Chicago or Toronto instead where they could really grow the game globally and improve the brand presence."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,pakhammer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:44:47 2015 UTC,Why couldn't they have done it when they played Australia?

rugbyunion,3cqbix,BullNiro,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:12:31 2015 UTC,Oh good god. It's been 8-10 years of pure desperation.
rugbyunion,3cqbix,Charredcheese,8,Sat Jul 11 07:11:42 2015 UTC,Time to sell literally everything I own.
rugbyunion,3cqbix,NZGrade,8,Thu Jul 9 23:08:29 2015 UTC,"No test in the South Island is disappointing. Yes the stadiums are pretty small, but Forsyth Barr for a lions test would've been brilliant."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,acideath,4,Thu Jul 9 23:39:57 2015 UTC,It is more accommodation they were worried about. The lions will be coming with a lot of people.
rugbyunion,3cqbix,Supertrinko,6,Fri Jul 10 06:30:54 2015 UTC,"She'll be right mate, my mate Steve-o down in Otago could get a few spare mattresses out."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,afunky,6,Fri Jul 10 11:53:36 2015 UTC,"Its also about making money too.  Eden Park holds 20K more people than Forsyth Barr - an extra 20,000 people at say $100 a pop is an extra $2million in revenue"
rugbyunion,3cqbix,GreatBumbershoot,6,Fri Jul 10 08:06:17 2015 UTC,"Ah why does this keep happening, Leave the UK to come to NZ, rugby world cup at home.  Return back home, lions tour in NZ."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,Johnson96,3,Fri Jul 10 03:31:34 2015 UTC,I think the issue here is that you don't have your priorities straight.
rugbyunion,3cqbix,savois-faire,3,Fri Jul 10 14:36:01 2015 UTC,"Oh man. That is a long wait, considering I cannot fucking wait!"
rugbyunion,3cqbix,cape7,4,Fri Jul 10 08:52:56 2015 UTC,"Unless the Super Rugby sides rest most of their top players, this is going to be a much tougher tour for the Lions than last time around. Looking forward to it"
rugbyunion,3cqbix,sirwaltermanny,7,Thu Jul 9 23:26:28 2015 UTC,"Stripped of All Blacks though, one would assume."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,cape7,3,Fri Jul 10 01:01:33 2015 UTC,"Even still, that's only like 3 of the champion Highlanders out and a super team without All Blacks is a hell of a lot stronger than an Itm cup team without All Blacks. Hell last time they played Manawatu when they weren't even in the NPC first division."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,afunky,4,Fri Jul 10 02:08:12 2015 UTC,"I have to say i'm disappointed that the provincial unions will no longer get a crack at the Lions.  Part of what made previous tours awesome was that the provincial centres got to host the Lions, and have a crack at knocking them off."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,batzman,11,Thu Jul 9 23:28:57 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree, I'd much rather a Super rugby team play as they will be far more competitive and make for a better match."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,acideath,3,Thu Jul 9 23:39:07 2015 UTC,Lions is more of an event than just a couple games though. Let the amateurs have a crack at something special. It dosnt actually matter if you get cricket scores
rugbyunion,3cqbix,afunky,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:34:00 2015 UTC,"What angle you come at this from, but but the lions are a once in 12 years experience.  Part of the magic of these tours in the past has been that the Lions have gone out into the regions and engaged with local communities.  With the way this tour is scheduled it seems like that will be not possible."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,brool215,4,Fri Jul 10 00:45:57 2015 UTC,Yeah but just looking through the 2005 results all the provincial teams bar Auckland (between 2 tests = 3rd string Lions team) were soundly beaten. The Super teams I'm guessing will play during/following their bye weekends so should have fairly strong lineups.
rugbyunion,3cqbix,afunky,2,Thu Jul 9 23:40:26 2015 UTC,"Apart from the Manawatu match none of them are really hidings though.  The fact that they are not playing provincial teams probably has more to do with Super Rugby running into July now, as opposed to it finishing in early June, as was the case the last time they were here."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,97Craters,2,Fri Jul 10 00:20:34 2015 UTC,The irony of all the complaints surrounding the two tests at Eden Park is that there'll probably be even more complaints in two years time when no one can get tickets for the three tests. Now imagine if they'd gone with Dunedin in that situation...
rugbyunion,3cqbix,throwaway27382,4,Fri Jul 10 12:00:09 2015 UTC,"How are the Lions supposed to have any chance of beating the ABs with games every 3 days, especially up against the 5 Super XV sides AND NZ Maori?!  Blues (yes I know) and ABs supporter here btw"
rugbyunion,3cqbix,Ciggie_butt_brain,5,Fri Jul 10 00:41:44 2015 UTC,No doubt they will have a test team to play the Maori and test matches and a mid-week team to play the Super 15 teams. They usually tour a big squad.
rugbyunion,3cqbix,plato44,4,Fri Jul 10 01:30:07 2015 UTC,They usually tour a big squad.   They brought their own lawyer last time.
rugbyunion,3cqbix,ruckovercdn,4,Fri Jul 10 04:14:58 2015 UTC,Given England's recent discipline that's probably not a bad idea
rugbyunion,3cqbix,plato44,4,Fri Jul 10 05:05:50 2015 UTC,"""The poor test results of the 2005 Lions, despite having one of the most experienced playing squads and the largest management team of any Lions tour, led to criticism of Woodward, particularly his selection policy, and prompted commentators to question the future of the Lions""  Typical Woodward."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,BullNiro,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:11:29 2015 UTC,Sheer arrogance. You can't just take an over the hill (which they were by 2005) England team to NZ and expect to win with a gameplan that had be solved by then.

rugbyunion,3cqbix,plato44,3,Fri Jul 10 06:56:28 2015 UTC,"All the bells, all the whistles but no game."
rugbyunion,3cqbix,Hitchhikingtom,2,Fri Jul 10 07:00:15 2015 UTC,You do remember they won that time?
rugbyunion,3cqbix,plato44,3,Fri Jul 10 08:54:01 2015 UTC,In '05? lost three tests and to NZ Maori as I recall...
rugbyunion,3cqbix,Ciggie_butt_brain,2,Fri Jul 10 22:29:38 2015 UTC,Lost all three tests badly
rugbyunion,3cqbix,batzman,3,Sat Jul 11 03:05:16 2015 UTC,The super rugby teams will be weakened as most All Blacks/Maori All Blacks won't be representing their super rugby franchise therefore I assume a Lions B team will be played against them.
rugbyunion,3cqbix,TheNinjaWarrior,2,Fri Jul 10 03:36:30 2015 UTC,So...now stop over match in the US? I know it was a long shot but it would of been awesome to see.
rugbyunion,3cqbix,fatdruggyelvis,2,Fri Jul 10 07:01:37 2015 UTC,Agreed. Would be great showcase for rugby in the States

We toured BC way back (2008?) and kinda made shit of everyone; like 60 points on Crimson Tide and anyone else we played. The following year Shawnigan toured to us. We won, but it was tight, and a really good game. They absolutely seem to be the standard in BC rugby; I imagine they do a lot to advance the game in Canada by setting the bar in the schools game at that level."

rugbyunion,3coejq,finnfb,67,Thu Jul 9 14:06:34 2015 UTC,"As gutted as I am I'm going to have to watch ITV, that's completely outweighed by the fact it's not gone to Sky. That would of been a travesty."
rugbyunion,3coejq,pipboon,39,Thu Jul 9 14:47:36 2015 UTC,It's bad enough we've got to suffer their coverage of the World Cup. Pray to god Adrian Chiles isn't involved.
rugbyunion,3coejq,ExclamationMark88,19,Thu Jul 9 14:09:37 2015 UTC,Thankfully it looks like Wales home matches will stay on BBC. Breathed a sigh of relief when I saw that
rugbyunion,3coejq,Llan79,8,Thu Jul 9 14:32:15 2015 UTC,That's worse for me though because I'll go to the home games.   The away games are the ones I'm likely to watch on TV :(
rugbyunion,3coejq,domalino,8,Thu Jul 9 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"I thought they did a pretty respectable job during the last WC, It's infinitely better than it going to sky anyway."
rugbyunion,3coejq,MrGhkl444,6,Thu Jul 9 15:00:59 2015 UTC,Wasn't there an ad break half way through the opening ceremony?
rugbyunion,3coejq,shaolinoli,5,Thu Jul 9 15:43:12 2015 UTC,I don't think they really showed the 2011 RWC opening ceremony. But to be fair does anybody really want to watch it?  If it's not the Olympics I'm not interested.
rugbyunion,3coejq,wn_,4,Thu Jul 9 15:46:06 2015 UTC,"I just remember it coming off as really jarring and a bit disrespectful to the host nation really, it wasn't even at the end of a segment, just right in the middle of whatever they were doing. It's not like RWC opening ceremonies are particularly long or drawn out."
rugbyunion,3coejq,shaolinoli,5,Thu Jul 9 15:49:50 2015 UTC,I don't think they showed the 07 ceremony at all so if they showed parts of 2011 it's a step up.  BBC have done similar though. They didn't show a second of the Rugby League world cup ceremony and I don't know if they ever show the FIFA world cup ceremonies but if they do I can't remember any of them.  I'll be more annoyed if they cut to adverts between the anthems and kick off. Nothing cuts the tension more than that gurning cockney geezer telling me to gamble.
rugbyunion,3coejq,wn_,3,Thu Jul 9 15:58:58 2015 UTC,"uugh, tell me about it."
rugbyunion,3coejq,shaolinoli,-1,Thu Jul 9 16:01:08 2015 UTC,If it's not the Olympics I'm not interested.   I'm not interested in the Olympic opening ceremony either. Load of people spending taxpayers' money on stupid shit.

rugbyunion,3coejq,wn_,2,Thu Jul 9 15:41:17 2015 UTC,What's with the Andy Nichol hate?
rugbyunion,3coejq,SparkleRhino,2,Thu Jul 9 21:52:52 2015 UTC,Can't stand one eyed cheerleader pundits. Nichol is a prime culprit.  I don't mind him so much when Scotland aren't playing but at times watching the BBC it just feels like all the pundits are trying to big up their favourite players rather than offer any valuable insight.
rugbyunion,3coejq,wn_,4,Thu Jul 9 22:27:21 2015 UTC,And Inverdale and Guscott. Actually BBC is really shit for rugby when i think about it
rugbyunion,3coejq,pooroldben,0,Thu Jul 9 18:11:35 2015 UTC,But all three are great when their respective nations lose.
rugbyunion,3coejq,ValentiaIsland,15,Thu Jul 9 19:52:30 2015 UTC,"ITV isn't to everybody's personal taste but this is a really great outcome for British rugby.  Top class rugby remaining on Terrestrial television until 2021, a more lucrative contract for unions who desperately need the money and two broadcasters covering the event instead of just BBC can't be a bad thing."
rugbyunion,3coejq,wn_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:29:59 2015 UTC,ITV isn't to everybody's personal taste but this is a really great outcome for British rugby.   ITV always used to have Greenwood. Got a lot of time for him as a pundit.

rugbyunion,3coejq,ronnierosenthal,24,Sat Jul 11 01:33:25 2015 UTC,Pleased with the news because it keeps the whole tournament on FTA television. The understanding amongst journos is that Sky made a bigger bid than the BBC/ITV one but was rejected.
rugbyunion,3coejq,abczyx123,14,Thu Jul 9 14:29:41 2015 UTC,The execs didn't feel that the fallout from going to sky was worth the minor bump in revenue.
rugbyunion,3coejq,Enyapxam,13,Thu Jul 9 14:32:17 2015 UTC,It's not. The fallout would have been apocalyptic.
rugbyunion,3coejq,Titanomakhia,10,Thu Jul 9 15:22:17 2015 UTC,I'm just glad its still on FTA TV.   And that we don't have to listen to Stuart Barnes

rugbyunion,3coejq,TheLeviathong,2,Thu Jul 9 18:50:26 2015 UTC,"I can live with that.  I wonder if, in the future, Super Saturday will be planned as either all on BBC or ITV."
rugbyunion,3coejq,StuHardy,3,Thu Jul 9 14:50:55 2015 UTC,"My only problem is this will inevitably mean Stuart Barnes on commentary - even though there are weak commentators with the BBC as well, nothing riles me more than Barnes."

They'll get a few more old dogs on board, and we'll see Adrian Chilles (No thanks) or Steve Rider (Also no thanks) given the lead anchor job. Sky's coverage would almost certainly have been better, but I'm so glad it won't be shifted over."
rugbyunion,3coejq,SquidgyGoat,7,Thu Jul 9 14:40:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, but ITV sport is routinely terrible. Always has been."

They might get Inverdale if they offer more for his freelance services as he lead ITV's French Open coverage. Though he does normally do BBC 6 Nations, I'm sure I read he's set to lead the ITV World Cup coverage."

rugbyunion,3coejq,SquidgyGoat,2,Thu Jul 9 19:30:21 2015 UTC,ELI5: How does this compare to American TV? Is this like CBS and Fox bidding on hosting rights and it's a free over the air broadcast or is it like ESPN in which you much subscribe to cable or is it a premium service that you have to pay for?
rugbyunion,3coejq,metompkin,3,Thu Jul 9 16:00:38 2015 UTC,The BBC and ITV are free to watch either online or on your TV. The BBC's advantage is that it doesn't have advert breaks. SKY and BT Sport are subscription services that you need to pay for and they have been buying up all the sport recently.
rugbyunion,3coejq,J0nShannow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:17:53 2015 UTC,OK. I have cut the cord on cable TV here in the us. I can't justify paying $100/ month for a bunch of useless TV. I don't get to watch a lot of american sport except for whatever is being broadcasted over the air and there are limited choices on NFL games. I usually have to find what I can for rugby online.  I've tried having my father in law to me how television licenses work in the UK but didn't seem to totally understand it with having to pay an annual tax on the amount of televisions you owned.

rugbyunion,3coejq,metompkin,2,Thu Jul 9 20:44:47 2015 UTC,It's odd that netflix is actualy a money saver over there. That internet is very steep though
rugbyunion,3coejq,rimbad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:14:31 2015 UTC,We consume so much here and that's why services cost a bit here.  There is a reason why our cell phone technology grows so fast.  I watched the London 7's on my cellphone on the beach in highdef and it didn't buffer or pixelate at all.  $140/ month for 6GB of data and all you can eat minutes and texts/pics.
rugbyunion,3coejq,metompkin,2,Thu Jul 9 21:27:50 2015 UTC,I get that for £30
rugbyunion,3coejq,rimbad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:31:10 2015 UTC,We do enjoy lower taxation in general though.  Capitalism at its finest...
rugbyunion,3coejq,metompkin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:44:16 2015 UTC,"I've lived in both places - although am an Aussie. Lower taxation in general isn't always true. I know in my case it wasn't. Living in California, Income tax at my rate was the more in the US than the UK and Australia. It got worse once you added in medical insurance etc.  That said, consumer products (clothes/vehicles/electronics etc.) are usually always cheaper than anywhere. Your consumer services (telephone/internet/cable) are often more expensive than Australia, and almost always more expensive than the UK."
rugbyunion,3coejq,Flys_Lo,3,Fri Jul 10 02:17:42 2015 UTC,"You get 4G in a lot of the UK, plus you get decent Internet for decent prices, much much better than the US"

rugbyunion,3coejq,003_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:23:32 2015 UTC,The World Cup broadcast in the US is split between Universal Sport and NBC. I don't know if that helps you but if not there are ways to get around ITV's geo locking and i'm sure there will be streams on here from the kind folk of this sub. The TV licence is a standalone fee that every household with a tv set pays. This money goes to the BBC to fund their tv and radio stations. I have no idea why it started up like that and in the future its going to change slightly so every household pays regardless of whether or not they have a TV. Either way its nice having channels that don't stop for adverts every 5 minutes.
rugbyunion,3coejq,J0nShannow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:24:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, we have PBS which is similar to BBC in the way it is funded.  It also has no adverts.  It also doesn't offer a lot of popular programming compared to the privately owned media companies.  I knew about NBC/Universal Sport showing the RWC matches but I won't be in the US proper around that time.  I'll be in Puerto Rico and am not sure how that's going to work out."
rugbyunion,3coejq,metompkin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"If you own a TV you pay a license fee, this basically funds the BBC including radio   You need to pay this no matter what you watch if it's on cable (sky) or not. If you don't watch live TV you don't need to pay it   License is roughly £150 a year"
rugbyunion,3coejq,naryn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:35:46 2015 UTC,We have pledge drives maybe twice a year and people can donate towards PBS.  They still get some operating funds from the federal government.

rugbyunion,3coejq,Shinskay,2,Thu Jul 9 16:31:41 2015 UTC,"No, they want viewing figures. It'll be on ITV1 when no other matches are on.  Edit - and I'm pretty sure the 6N want maximum exposure so they'll want staggered ko times."

Last year both the Huns and the Blacks had D1 and D2 teams - the Huns also have a D3 side known as the Horde. Like the guy above said, you'd have to get a workout in with each to determine who is a better fit for you personality-wise.  Both teams have their fields geographically very close to each other in East Austin. If you're going to be living far South, like outside of Austin and in Buda, you might want to give the San Marcos Greys D3 a look - https://www.facebook.com/GreysRfc .

rugbyunion,3cqbwk,mattgrande,4,Thu Jul 9 23:45:57 2015 UTC,Women's Rugby is a CIS designated sport and Quebec traditionally produces some of our country's best athletes. It seems the boys still want to play football.

rugbyunion,3cqbwk,bigxblack,9,Sat Jul 11 02:37:33 2015 UTC,"Well a 36 man world cup training squad was released today (missing some 7s guys and injured players), and only two of them are from Quebec. Although to be fair essentially all the selection is done through our provincial national tournament, and Quebec doesn't even have a team in it, so maybe we're missing out on some quality players? Not sure. They usually put out decent teams in the junior national tournament though. They've got a really good sevens team though. Also saw a bunch of rugby on my clubs preseason tour to Montreal this year.  So to answer your question, they don't have much of a presence nationally, but as far as I can tell they're about average for the country."
rugbyunion,3cqbwk,TheTallestGnome,8,Fri Jul 10 00:23:57 2015 UTC,"FRQ (Federation Rugby Quebec) is a fucking mess. People dont know what they are doing, and the few full time staff they have are way more interested in taking pictures and posting on facebook to do anything.   They have zero junior leagues!!! 0. zilch. none. Great clubs such as Ste-anne's, MTL Irish, Beconfields, Parco, have no designated games for their U18, U16 or U14 teams. All of them have resorted to travelling down to Ottawa to play the EORU (Eastern Ontario Rugby Union) clubs, Blues, Scottish, Indians, Beavers, and Irish.   There has been no serious attempt at a senior mens team because there is always a concern about player quotas. (problem being it is way easier for EORU players to travel to MTL then to Toronto to train, so Quebec executives dont want Ontario residents playing for a team funded by Quebec Tax Dollars). So they cant guarantee the best players will be chosen, so no one wants to take the chance and try out.   The Competition system the have set up is hardly adequate, with only a 6 team top division and 6 team divisions going down to 3rd division. They constantly reject a 8 team league and no one seems to be looking forward.   Their website never works. No one has a clue what is going on. Every Ottawa and the Kingston team are constantly at odds with the FRQ and their teams (about admin things, about score sheets, about player cards, about not having ARs for 1XV games). The FRQ teams come down to Ottawa and destroy the locker rooms, shit in the shower, steal all the signs, and dont respect their enthronement.   /rant"
rugbyunion,3cqbwk,michedlp,4,Fri Jul 10 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that's a bummer."
rugbyunion,3cqbwk,21Tauler,3,Fri Jul 10 05:02:52 2015 UTC,"What he said... The FRQ is run by a bunch of idiots that think they know what they're doing, which is the worst part... As soon as 7's was announced as an olympic sport, they just bailed on anything 15's and started forcing teams to do 7's (they were actually planning on docking points from clubs in the 15's competition that didn't send teams to the 7's tournaments.... yeah). The divisions have been re-worked every year for the past 6 years, because reasons, so each year if you're not in the super league, you have no idea who you're gonna be playing. They've changed they're website a bajillion times and each time is worse than the last, and it's only in French... They switched to online registration this year, which you had to enter in your personal details 4 times, answer 4 pages of questions about your health, then would crash when you have to put in your credit card, so you have to start over again. A lot just gave up trying. They have this really weird fascination that forcing teams that wish to progress up the league MUST have 2 teams, they seem to believe it will build rugby generally, rather than just make the big clubs bigger and the smaller clubs that can just put a team together perenially struggle because those without game-time leave the club and go where they can play, rather than stay and try to out-perform the incumbent. This left clubs that have plenty for 1 team but not enough for 2 (like Kingston a year or so ago) spend most of their time whipping teams by 50 points because they're put in the same division as the smaller developing clubs.  My club had to build our own junior and youth programs with 0 help from the FRQ, the people that are in-charge of that are the kind that say they care, but since they're tied to specific clubs, only care that their club is doing well, and not about anyone elses'. We've lost a lot of the U18 kids because they cannot play senior rugby under any circumstances (they did, after persuasion and noticing that the general consensus of the clubs was turning against them when taylor paris walked on the park for Canada, allow for a way for a U18 to play senior, but made it so convoluted that it was actually impossible), so there's a big age-gap where the U18's just walked away, when if we'd been able to give them game time at the senior level they would have been hooked for life.  At the provincial level, last i heard it was over $1000 to play in the provincial team, and that didn't include travel expenses or anything like that, and that was on-top of what you paid for your club. Who the hell wants to pay that? They seem to be getting their act back together, but they did themselves no favors.  20 years ago, rugby was the #5 sport in quebec (behind hockey, soccer, and i forget the other 2), but you could say they did what the ARU did, and figured it would just carry on... They stopped requesting money from the government, and the associations that grant cash, so there was no money to do anything. They haven't tried to get a sponsor for the league, or for anything really, clubs are left to their own devices, and when you have a problem and go to them, they tell you tough shit figure it out yourselves.  If i sound bitter, yep."
rugbyunion,3cqbwk,21Tauler,3,Fri Jul 10 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"Back in the 70s and 80s Quebec had very strong rugby clubs and competed well at the provnicial level.  It has fallen away significantly since then (which has also led to a decline in the level of rugby in Ottawa, as there is now much less competition nearby)."
rugbyunion,3cqbwk,ruckovercdn,2,Fri Jul 10 14:08:48 2015 UTC,"I should add (as did mattgrande) that a meaningful portion of the Canadian Womens' team is from Quebec, and that the current women's World Rugby player of the year is from Quebec."
rugbyunion,3cpw1u,threalseymourskinner,3,Thu Jul 9 20:40:43 2015 UTC,"Noticed a bit of negative slack in some of the comments in any given news site regarding this decision, and I'm kind of with the coach on this one. It's a diplomatic calculated approach, best preparing (in theory) his team for the RWC.  Ideally, with key players out or not, the lessons learnt from this upcoming test match should be the same.  I'm sure it wasn't a decision made lightly, so I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt. Argentina is increasing its stance on the world rugby scene every test match they play. They're doing something right."
rugbyunion,3cpw1u,jeffrey2ks,2,Fri Jul 10 01:51:42 2015 UTC,"It is in no way true they are increasing their stance in world rugby.   Their ranking has continued to drop over the past 8 years and is only slightly above it's 12 year low of 2005  Rankings  They fought hard to get a team into meaningful yearly competition and they are already choosing to rest players after consistently finishing last.   Performing year in year out in TRC is going to do more for their rugby than a RWC 1/4 final every 20 years.  If the players are actually injured, then so be it, but this seems a lot more like rotation from a team without the cattle to produce a decent team at the best of times."
rugbyunion,3cpw1u,Koreapsu,2,Fri Jul 10 04:18:00 2015 UTC,"You are angry that they aren´t fielding the best team but the fact is that they can´t because the four players to miss the match didn´t recover from the injuries they sustained during their club season.   Other players such as Tuculet, who was injured, WILL play.  If i were the Pumas Coach i would be resting Lobbe from all the TRC but Hourcade won´t because of one simple fact, they want to play and win. It is VERY unlikely that they could beat the AB´s but they will take every shot they can, this includes fielding their best teams. If you know spanish i will link you to a couple of recent interviews where he states this. Everybody in the squad knows that to win at the RWC you need to be competitive and this includes beating the three SH giants as well.  Regarding the rankings, first off, Argentina rose a lot simply because they had an incredible team during the 2007 RWC, after that many players retired and the team was left in shambles. Why does this happen? Because Argentina always relied on brilliant players playing in Europe, the UAR has realized this and implemented several development plans which helped bring players like Matera and Montero into the rugby scene. This, obviously, takes time. During 2008 to 2012 Argentina remained competitive, they played against teams like Scotland and generally won, but with all due respect, they aren't at the same level like England or the Southern giants. During the 2011 RWC they played reasonably well with a close loss against england, beat Scotland with a wonder try from Amorosino and lost against the eventual Champions, not granting them a try until the 68th minute of the game.  Then came the R Championship. Playing against these teams would almost guarantee successive losses, especially at the start where there was another massive loss of players such as Ledesma.  Nowadays, only Bosch, Ayerza, Lobbe, Leguizamon and Hernandez remain from that great 2007 pumas squad. The rest are young but very talented players, IE Sanchez, Montero, Imhoff.  It was with this very new team that the Pumas beat Australia. Perhaps a weaker than usual Wallaby team because of the whole Beale saga, but important victory nonetheless.   I know its hard to ignore the stats, but it is important to recognize that there is a lot of work behind the scenes, and im more than positive that Argentina will be more competitive in the future years. Context matters and hopefully this may slightly change your point of view."
rugbyunion,3cpw1u,xValarax,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:48:19 2015 UTC,"First off I'm not angry at all.   If they want to give themselves no chance at all, that's fine, and as I said if they are legit injuries then so be it, that happens.  We'll see if Argentina are better in the coming years.   Personally I think (barring injury) they need to be fronting with their best team, and their best game plan, against the best teams and testing themselves.   This isn't about overplaying squad members, it's about identifying if people have it in them to foot it with the very best.   They aren't going to work that out playing against Scotland."
rugbyunion,3cpw1u,Koreapsu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:51:44 2015 UTC,I can't argue those stats huh.
rugbyunion,3cpw1u,jeffrey2ks,2,Fri Jul 10 04:20:48 2015 UTC,"Hernandez got injured during the Toulon Champions cup victory and from what i know he was struggling to recover.  Senatore was also injured from the Worcester Warriors vs Bristol.  Matera got injured when the Pumas played against the french Baa Baas a fornight ago, it is a sprained ankle or something like that, evolving well but not fully healed either.  Lavanini was also struggling with injury.  Why do i say this? All four players are coming back from injury and from what i´ve gathered they aren´t recovered 100%, why would someone risk key players when they aren´t healed properly yet?  Other players like Tuculet were injured but passed the health check and are going to play.  Plus, Hernandez missed the 2011 RWC for not recovering on time from a nasty injury, i would put him in cotton wool until kickoff against NZ in September. (I would also add Lobbe if i could)  And note that other ""Key"" players aren´t rested, Argentina, unlike other TRC nations, will field an almost fully fledged Pumas squad. Creevy, Sanchez, Lobbe, Imhoff, Bosch, Carizza, Agulla and my favorite Prop, Don Marcos Ayerza."

To call it ""piss poor"" is not a great summary.  First home game they drew 16-16 with the Boks.  First game against NZ they were 5-6 down at halftime.  Same season they lost 23-19 to Australia and until 60 minutes were winning 19-6.  The next year they lost 14-13 to Australia.  I'll stop there.   ""Piss poor""? No. Piss off.  Resting players is done by every team, all the time. Especially in a World Cup year. Should they play every good player every game? No. You're actually, honestly suggesting that countries should only rest players if they're ""good enough""?   You're tacky and I hate you."
rugbyunion,3cpw1u,Koreapsu,-2,Fri Jul 10 12:08:07 2015 UTC,"Who'd they beat?   Is it 1 win so far?   How's their ranking points?    Worse than they've been in 10 years.   Even by their own low historical standards they have been piss poor recently.  They are going to get a quarter on the back of a weak pool.   If they make it further, on the back of these rested players then fair play I was wrong.   But it isn't going to happen.  As I said I hope the ABs  ruin them, and fucking go Tonga at the RWC - it'd be great to see them advance instead of the precious  argies."

rugbyunion,3cpvla,Aquapig,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.

rugbyunion,3cpvla,continental-drift,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:42:05 2015 UTC,Well because there wasn't really a pass if he took the ball from the other player without the ball leaving the other player's hand before the try scorer had control of it.
rugbyunion,3cpvla,alfix8,2,Fri Jul 10 04:22:29 2015 UTC,Placing the ball into a teammates hands who is in front of you is still considered a forward pass.

rugbyunion,3cpvla,alfix8,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:43:00 2015 UTC,"Often gets confused, as people look at law 12.1(a) which says:   Unintentional knock-on or throw forward. A scrum is awarded at the place of infringement.   BUT, you have to look at the definition of what a ""throw forward"" is.   DEFINITION: THROW FORWARD A throw forward occurs when a player throws or passes the ball forward. ‘Forward’ means towards the opposing team’s dead ball line.   Given a pass where the ball is in the air is covered by ""when a player throws"", the term ""or passes"" is more like the action I would take if I were to pass you a bottle of beer. With a rugby ball, that must be flat or backwards.   In many cases where a ball is passed forward the recipient is in an offside position anyway."
rugbyunion,3cpvla,sionnach,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:00:16 2015 UTC,"Technically not forward as at the point where the ball is transferred both players have contact with it so the ball doesn't travel forward out of one player's hands, it doesn't travel backwards either so it counts the same as a flat pass.  To clarify it doesn't matter where you are standing when you receive the ball only what the ball has done between leaving one player's hands and coming into contact with the next player or the ground. Perfectly legal to run ahead of the ball and reach back behind yourself to receive a pass assuming the pass did not go forwards."

I will say that USA Rugby has to get their stuff together, however. As a still-active player, I don't know what their larger vision is, and I'm still confused by the reasoning for the GU changes."

rugbyunion,3coq96,ruckovercdn,2,Thu Jul 9 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"Club level stuff exists, and they go up to the Atlantic and Pacific Premiership competitions. It's all amateur though, partly because National governing bodies can't operate professional sports in the US."
rugbyunion,3coq96,Mariusuiram,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:23:50 2015 UTC,But for whatever reason he is absolutely convinced that all amateur US rugby players are worthless and he should only focus on bringing ex-NFL players in and teaching them rugby.

rugbyunion,3coq96,Themalster,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:15:25 2015 UTC,"Basically.  Every professional league in the USA actually has a guaranteed monopoly on their respective sports market from the US congress.  One pro Baseball league, one pro NFL league, etc.  it makes some men very rich, but it also unifies the sport under one umbrella."
rugbyunion,3coq96,LegendxFundz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:45:48 2015 UTC,So would Rugby Law not have needed congressional approval for the NRFL?
rugbyunion,3coq96,Themalster,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:12:43 2015 UTC,Not at this time.  Most of the reason that congress granted the monopolies was to settle inter-league disputes.  ie NFL league A wants X and NFL league B wants Y.  Congress stepped in and made them one league.

Why the hell should USA Rugby sanction that when they won't follow some pretty simple rules?"
rugbyunion,3coq96,Themalster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:39:18 2015 UTC,"and thats why it fell apart.  He wanted it done his way, even though that way isn't how it works at all.  He also wanted to bring in former NFL players to play the game, and while they have the athletic ability, an XV of former NFL players against even a team from the Pacific Premiership would end in an awful debacle.    If I were running this, I would make a pro league that fed off of three regions, Pacific, Midwest and Atlantic, with each region getting eight ish teams.  Each team would be encouraged to bring players up through a farm system from the local area.  I would try to coordinate business sponsorship with teams from large local businesses, and run a salary cap that was competitive with European and Super Rugby incomes.  And then grind it out."

rugbyunion,3coi5u,thumpymcwiggles,43,Thu Jul 9 14:35:31 2015 UTC,Teams that look to purely muscle their way to victory have not been successful for a while now. South African super rugby teams have been criticised for being too 'route one' haven't been in a super rugby final since 2012 and haven't won since 2010. French 'le bish and le bosh' has been 'le joke' since 2011. Wales' 'Gatland ball' has got them to third place in the last two 6 nations. I know people moaning about rugby degrading into meatheads running into each other is fun but its a load of crap. Defences improving 100 times over since the amateur era is a better explanation for the current state of the game. Look at any amateur match such as the 'try from the end of the world' and you will see the attacking team running through a scattered field as the individual defenders try to work out what to do. Compare that to a modern game where a line break results in an organised line moving backwards in an attempt to stifle the attack. While the dominance of defence is not the route to exciting rugby neither is shaking your head and saying 'players spend too much time in the gym these days' frankly its a lazy analysis that does a major disservice to modern players.
rugbyunion,3coi5u,HyphyBurrito,6,Thu Jul 9 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the dense yet entirely correct comment. I agree a hundred times with you, but I think we need to work on something to weaken the defense. I have no idea how, really, but we have to continue to make rugby interest grow. The only way to do that is by making it more impressive and shiny with line breaks.  Maybe that's one of the reason they chose 7 over union for the Olympics, it's more interesting for the average watcher (who is clueless about rugby in general anyway)."
rugbyunion,3coi5u,PinguRambo,8,Fri Jul 10 00:35:28 2015 UTC,I think tournament format and country inclusion were the major reasons for 7s inclusion.
rugbyunion,3coi5u,PinguRambo,2,Fri Jul 10 01:11:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely, but the amount of tries and line breaks are also participating in those, it was the only thing I was saying."
rugbyunion,3coi5u,cape7,3,Fri Jul 10 01:13:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely makes the sport marketable. There are tons of extremely boring Olympic events, that's why they sell us so hard on backstory. You're right that the Rings were happy to get something fun to watch."
rugbyunion,3coi5u,_frostillicus,6,Fri Jul 10 15:19:17 2015 UTC,"They didn't put union forward because its just not feasible to play any decent sized XV tournament in the time frame. You can play 4-5 sevens matches in a single day, that would take weeks in XV."
rugbyunion,3coi5u,abr0414,13,Fri Jul 10 07:25:32 2015 UTC,"Can anyone else see things evolving into some sort of cycle? Where players get so large that small players have the advantage, so player size starts decreasing until big players have the advantage again? Just a though"

rugbyunion,3coi5u,PetevonPete,9,Thu Jul 9 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"i like this, an emphasis on speed and agility will bring excitement and skill.

rugbyunion,3coi5u,Aquapig,9,Thu Jul 9 15:13:01 2015 UTC,This could really have a trickle down effect in age grade systems as well. I'm sure there are countless kids who were ebbed out of systems because they didn't quite have the measurables early on.
rugbyunion,3coi5u,threalseymourskinner,6,Thu Jul 9 15:31:45 2015 UTC,"Yep, we're in real danger of going down the Soccerball route in that the big lads who are athletes get picked and worry about the talent level later. Sure, athletic ability is important but you can coach a lot of the conditioning and strength, you can't coach the innovation and creativity unless you spot it and encourage it early on.   Also I miss the game where every kid at school could play a position at rugby and not have to be a behemoth at 15."

It certainly can be hard for spectators to tell exactly what's happened, but even then it's usually pretty obvious when a scrum is under pressure and going down because of it. I'd say the ""50/50"" cases are when the scrum's are more evenly matched, and it's down to one prop rather than the whole pack being under pressure."

rugbyunion,3co3f3,harblstuff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:32:23 2015 UTC,"If so, I hope it's Adidas still because they almost never go wrong with kits."
rugbyunion,3co3f3,bonji96,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:36:47 2015 UTC,"It was already widely reported that Adidas dropped the Lions, which coincided with their gigantic deal to produce the Manchester United kit.   Hence why I think it's most likely an announcement related to the kit, two years out from the next tour seems about right."
rugbyunion,3co3f3,harblstuff,2,Thu Jul 9 13:41:01 2015 UTC,It'd be quite fun if we wore Canterbury shirts to NZ in 2 years
rugbyunion,3co3f3,WallopyJoe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:42:14 2015 UTC,Ahh somehow I missed that article.  Definitely agree with you now that it is probably an announcement about the kit manufacturer.
rugbyunion,3co3f3,bonji96,5,Thu Jul 9 13:57:09 2015 UTC,Something about Gatland dropping BOD maybe? (fuck you I wont forget about it. YOU FORGET ABOUT IT!!)  Maybe next Head Coach? I imagine all eligible coaches are too focused on the WC to even care about coaching the Lions yet though

rugbyunion,3cnnsr,fernta,2,Thu Jul 9 13:00:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it was so good to see him slice through defensive lines earlier this season. It's a real shame he got injured again because he was looking sharp on attack after a couple of mediocre/injury-affected years."

rugbyunion,3cnnsr,highlander35,5,Thu Jul 9 13:07:42 2015 UTC,"No, 2015. Did you watch any of the Crusaders games this year?"
rugbyunion,3cnnsr,fernta,0,Thu Jul 9 13:12:02 2015 UTC,Yep. Didn't think he played anything beyond competent this season. Even if the Crusaders had an injury free side I would have had both Slade and Taylor ahead of him.   Probably would have got the right wing spot for mine if that had eventuated.
rugbyunion,3cnnsr,highlander35,3,Thu Jul 9 13:20:59 2015 UTC,Taylor ahead of Dagg? What?
rugbyunion,3cnnsr,NZGrade,2,Thu Jul 9 21:31:07 2015 UTC,"Really? His performance against the Bulls and Lions (I think it was) was sublime. Not enough to make them win, but Taylor and Slade ahead of him at fb?  He has not been bad this year, 2014/2013 he hasn't been great I agree, but there wasn't anything wrong with him this year."

He's been playing 6 for Toulouse with Gallan playing well at 8 and he doesn't really have the same impact from there. He's back in the French group though so I'm hopeful he'll be back to his don't argue style rugby for the RWC.
rugbyunion,3clvk8,fettsack,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:24:25 2015 UTC,He was injured pretty badly about a year and a bit ago.  Has been struggling to come back from it.   Progress has been slow and there were some minor re-injuries this year.  Toulouse has had the injury bug for years now.  I used to think it was just an unlucky streak.... starting to think it is more a fitness/conditionning/physio/player care issue.  There has always been plenty of squad rotation for rests.

I spent £80 on Wales v Ireland this year, I stayed at a friends flat and flew to Bristol and was picked up (cheaper flights) - I still spent 220-260 euro in total (food, booze, soccerball ticket for Swansea)  So yeah, I can only imagine how much I'd be set back if I had a more expensive ticket or multiple tickets (fly over one weekend, back, then over again)  Instead I decided to spent 430 euro on a Leinster season ticket and convinced my father to buy one too, converting a Mayo GAA fan - either the greatest or worst idea I've ever had. Far better from a price perspective."

Trains don't fucking go into Wales until the afternoon on a Sunday so London etc are out.  Neither of us Drive so the Ferry aint a great option either.  But we are prepared to spend €250 each if we have to.  So all in all it is looking like almost 700 euro... and I couldn't care less. Once in a lifetime stuff

rugbyunion,3chhi1,Jaeger999,16,Wed Jul 8 03:30:26 2015 UTC,Watch him offload the water bottle during the next timeout.

rugbyunion,3chhi1,forte2,7,Wed Jul 8 03:11:05 2015 UTC,Brad Weber on debut I think would be better. give him a run
rugbyunion,3chhi1,wowjiffylube,17,Wed Jul 8 03:10:50 2015 UTC,Hanson knows what he's doing. This game raises the odds at the TAB for the world cup.

rugbyunion,3chhi1,QuadeCooper,11,Wed Jul 8 02:57:09 2015 UTC,At least Dagg and Ellis are making it easier for the selectors to make their team for the World Cup

rugbyunion,3chhi1,plato44,11,Wed Jul 8 02:00:22 2015 UTC,Missing Smith's quick flat passing. Really shows how important he is to the side.  Ellis is not clearing fast enough and not getting it away fast enough. Give Weber a go.
rugbyunion,3chhi1,Foveaux,5,Wed Jul 8 03:10:44 2015 UTC,"You really notice the difference. With Smith and Perenara every pass is out in front and crisp. It makes such a huge difference in how much momentum a player has going into the next tackle, especially against a team with good line speed.   Today pretty much every pass was behind the player or at an awkward height, forcing the receiving player to slow right down and be in a slightly awkward position hitting the line. Makes such a huge difference.   While Ellis didn't do anything particularly dreadful today, it really just shows how class Smith and Perenara truly are."
rugbyunion,3chhi1,plato44,5,Wed Jul 8 08:52:54 2015 UTC,"agreed. HB is the most important position in rugby now days, so much so for the ABs too."
rugbyunion,3chhi1,marmitechips,11,Wed Jul 8 03:14:10 2015 UTC,See ya Ellis (never to wear the black jersey again).
rugbyunion,3chhi1,WallopyJoe,6,Wed Jul 8 03:24:10 2015 UTC,"Sad but true. He's lost whatever made him special.   And compared to Assron Smith he's a glacier with the ball.  Edit: don't give me that look, I absolutely meant Assron."

rugbyunion,3chhi1,I_will_remember_this,2,Wed Jul 8 03:44:11 2015 UTC,A shame really that such an important game for Samoa was ... so shit.
rugbyunion,3chhi1,BlackYosh,10,Wed Jul 8 03:46:13 2015 UTC,Well that was downright embarrassing.
rugbyunion,3chhi1,HTtakesphotos,19,Wed Jul 8 03:45:28 2015 UTC,"30 degree heat, day game, second/third choice backline, first game for the season.  All things considered, it could have been worse.  The Samoan crowd got what they came to see - a good game where Samoa really looked like they were in it.  Not the prettiest of spectacles, but a win is a win, and I'm stoked for Moala and co getting their first AB caps.  And Carter didn't break his leg!"
rugbyunion,3chhi1,sandollars,3,Wed Jul 8 03:46:00 2015 UTC,I don't like Moala. I think it's that I don't like his name. It sounds like Koala. Koalas are cunts.
rugbyunion,3chhi1,Foveaux,19,Wed Jul 8 08:02:51 2015 UTC,Well that was fucking atrocious. I know they normally a bit rusty in the first test of the season. But we're going to need multiple cans of CRC to sort this out.
rugbyunion,3chhi1,BlackYosh,14,Wed Jul 8 03:43:45 2015 UTC,Yeah we don't usually have tests with a 4th string backline in 30 degree weather after two days of meet-n-greets though.

rugbyunion,3chhi1,minutesir,3,Wed Jul 8 04:12:18 2015 UTC,"True,  I was surprised in how late we flew over. But this has to be the first mid-week test that the AB's have played in. But have to give credit to Samoa they relished this opportunity and gave a game for their fans.   But I'll admit I'm a little salty about the result, just expected a better result."
rugbyunion,3chhi1,sandollars,10,Wed Jul 8 03:54:29 2015 UTC,This half time show is not bad.  That tackle by the guy in blue shorts made it for me.
rugbyunion,3chhi1,rektd,7,Wed Jul 8 02:51:36 2015 UTC,It's already more exciting than the rugby.

rugbyunion,3chhi1,Koreapsu,10,Wed Jul 8 03:48:04 2015 UTC,Dan Carter's kicking and ability to get through a game
rugbyunion,3chhi1,HTtakesphotos,7,Wed Jul 8 03:51:07 2015 UTC,george moala was a definite highlight
rugbyunion,3chhi1,My_usrname_of_choice,7,Wed Jul 8 03:51:57 2015 UTC,Carter kicked pretty well. Although thats the only positive I can think of.
rugbyunion,3chhi1,wowjiffylube,4,Wed Jul 8 03:51:32 2015 UTC,Carter played well considering tge service he got from Ellis was glacial.

rugbyunion,3chhi1,considerspiders,8,Wed Jul 8 02:09:19 2015 UTC,"Ellis should never be allowed to wear the Black jersey again. Webber made a far bigger positive impact, despite that try he contributed to letting through. His vision and pass were far superior to Ellis. Loose forwards were pretty quiet, midfield wasn't linking to the outside backs well, and Dagg was his usual boring, uninspired self. Front Row was showing the lack of Rugby they have played this year. Overall we were missing our 1st pick back line."

rugbyunion,3chhi1,wowjiffylube,7,Wed Jul 8 01:21:19 2015 UTC,He's not commentating. He's just presenting the game at the beginning (and maybe half time/full time). Sky is not that retarded.

This is typical. Not excusing it, just saying.  EDIT: Peeps, the point is we start out bad and not how bad e.g. in 2012 we started out at a 2/10 bad, not a 1/10 bad. I wouldn't read into it too much regardless of result."

rugbyunion,3chd7w,wrapyourwillysilly,21,Wed Jul 8 00:27:38 2015 UTC,Anyone interested in long term development of the sport would battle against sky. Sadly Murdoch often wins by large sums of money in the short term to the right people. I would never have found rugby without free to air six nations as none of my family watch/understand it so by pure stumbling I found a sport I enjoy watching.

rugbyunion,3chd7w,disco_jim,6,Fri Jul 10 08:57:49 2015 UTC,"I really don't want to have to stream the Six Nations off a website. I really don't like ITV (or UTV as we have it here), but if an alliance with the BBC is what it takes to keep it away from Sky, then I back it 1000%.  Hopefully, our Minister for Communications here in Ireland has the good sense to make the Six Nation free to air. But if it went to Sky, I cant help but think he'd cave and allow it be sold off."
rugbyunion,3chd7w,PeteIRL,3,Wed Jul 8 08:12:39 2015 UTC,"The IRFU is against legislation to keep it free to air and the government can only protect Ireland matches, meaning for the other 10 matches you will need Sky."
rugbyunion,3chd7w,harblstuff,5,Wed Jul 8 08:19:43 2015 UTC,"Sky or BBC/ITV. But I'd take just the Ireland matches if that's what it came to. It'd be infuriating, but better than losing the entire tournament."
rugbyunion,3chd7w,PeteIRL,2,Wed Jul 8 08:33:05 2015 UTC,"We may not even get it here if they do split it with ITV. We would have if we still had UTV but I reckon UTV Ireland (as the new channel is called) wont screen them here as they more than likely wont have the rights.  I do love being able to switch over to the BBC for some games, especially the Scottish ones for some reason."

rugbyunion,3chd7w,savois-faire,5,Wed Jul 8 08:43:03 2015 UTC,"Tories and Murdoch seem to be conspiring to cripple the BBC. I think they are under estimating the amount of damage that would be caused to rugby by moving to Sky; most people I know are only ever exposed to it through the 6N. I'm assuming they'd say they reinvest in growing the game, but it seems to me that no matter how much money you put in, a sport that most people can watch and see is popular on TV is always going to have a huge advantage."
rugbyunion,3chd7w,Aquapig,4,Wed Jul 8 11:38:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, BBC losing the funding of the over 75 tv licences (just in time for the baby boomers to gracefully age into this bracket), politicians hoping to force the BBC website to downscale, playing for iPlayer.... Seriously, what the hell?"

Yup. If the 6N committee are going to piss off a lot of people and damage the growth of the sport, they'll at least demand considerable compensation for doing so. Where, from that rationale, is a decision being made for the good of the game and not just to line pockets? That's a rhetorical question, by the way."

rugbyunion,3ci7xb,yourgrandmasteaparty,3,Wed Jul 8 19:43:56 2015 UTC,Rugbyfilms has done a good job with SuperRugby and seems to be setting up to do the international scene for this year (at least for NZ). Youtube has a few channels with middling success as the broadcasters have finally started chasing down copyright infringement for rugby in the last year. Check here regularly for posted games or ask really nicely and sometimes people will point you towards recorded games.  There's a website called Across the Tasman that I'm not a part of that has torrent links but you need an invitation (hence my lack of involvement).

It has always seemed to me that was just something people like to repeat but doesn't have a huge amount to back it up.  First games of the year since 2005:   2005: 91-0 vs Fiji 2006: 34-23 vs Ireland 2007: 41-11 vs France 2008: 21-11 vs Ireland 2009: 22-27 vs France ( A loss!) 2010: 66-28 vs Ireland 2011: 60-14 vs Fiji 2012: 42-10 vs Ireland again 2013: 23-13 vs France 2014: 20-15 vs England   So all up a few beatings and some pretty comfortable wins. One loss (mad props to the French for beating us in NZ) and then only one win was even within the 7 points for a theoretical bonus point.   I feel like lately we are much more vulnerable at the end of the year.    2014: 34-16 vs Wales 2013: 24-22 vs Ireland (Some of you may recall this one. It was okay.) 2012: 21-38 vs England (A comprehensive loss, fair play) 2011: 8-7 vs France (another people may recall, maybe unfair to include as it was finals football at its ugliest, but still super close.)"

rugbyunion,3cfvja,NINJAS-IN-FATPANDAS,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"Good riddance to Roger. Worst thing Welsh rugby has ever done is hire that man.  Hopefully the RSA can be renegotiated into a more workable document, with a more sensible man at the helm. The current one needs a legion on lawyers to make sense of.  Good luck to the man, he has got a hell of a task to bring the WRU into the 21st century."
rugbyunion,3cfvja,Enyapxam,2,Wed Jul 8 07:14:10 2015 UTC,"Roger Lewis has had little power or influence since last year's coup. I'm not a massive fan of everything that he did but his remit was to restore financial stability to the WRU and to prioritise the national team. He was very successful at doing that. I understand that regional supporters find it frustrating that their teams had to cut their cloth accordingly, but let's stop pretending that that he is evil incarnate. He wasn't responsible for every regional failure and mistake. He most certainly can't be used as a scapegoat from now on. The regions now hold the whip-hand and can no longer dodge responsibility for their own actions. There is no-one left for them to blame.  The jury is out on Martyn Phillips. There's not much substance or detail in the BBC interview. I suppose that's understandable when his first day isn't for a few months. In the interview with WalesOnline he wants to be 'in the riverbank'. At the same time he wants to be 'between the riverbanks' (so in the river). But definitely not in a lake. Lakes don't go anywhere, you see. That will allow him to remove the roadblocks (from the middle of the river) so that he can get into a 'virtual circle' [sic]. That sort of muddled middle-management speak doesn't fill me with confidence but we'll give him the benefit of the doubt for now.  My biggest fear is that he's a stooge for Gareth Davies and his regional pals. It is essential that the correct balance is established between national, regional, club and grass-roots rugby. It would be reckless and damaging for the sport in Wales for regional interests to ride roughshod over the others - they must be kept in check. It will take a strong character to do that. Is Martyn Phillips the right person for that? Time will tell but on first impressions he certainly doesn't seem to be particularly assertive."

Can’t they just make like it Football, wearing the same jersey for one season for all games be it World Cup, Six Nations or tours?  Or it’s just my view that no tournament deserves a fancy jersey for its own, but if you want to go fancy, do it all year round and not just for the world cup."
rugbyunion,3cg4kz,frakturfreak,6,Tue Jul 7 17:42:21 2015 UTC,I am very happy with the Adidas tendency to stay very conservative on the match jerseys and go nuts on the training kit for the All Blacks.  The reason they have a different RWC jersey is that the ban on sponsors means a lot of the jerseys are being rejigged anyway so you might as well make a new one.

I don't care if the play was not as fluent as it should have been or if the passes were not as statistically accurate as they should have been, the fact is that 2 teams went on the field and played their guts out.   And like every game that matters, either side could have won.   For me, I thoroughly enjoyed the game. Both teams threw convention out the window and played the game like they remembered the game.

rugbyunion,3ceulp,amplebooty,2,Tue Jul 7 14:40:45 2015 UTC,They are usually given the option of 2 contracts - one contract if they retire from Test rugby (i.e. more $$$) or another contract if they don't (i.e. paycut). A few island players were quoted in the Sunday Times as having been offered such options. I remember Trevor Leota missed the 2003 RWC for this exact reason. Never played for Samoa again.

While I applaud his stance (plus having a laugh @ Toulouse is always a nice bonus), I fear you're over-estimating his bankability on the market. Toulouse's scrum last year was totally dire, mostly because of Tialata apparently finding fascinating insects in the grass and wanting to have a closer look at them (ditto Pulu during his stint as injury cover), but neither Census nor Steenkamp were the stalwarts they were suposed to be either. And he managed to sign a 3 years contract at the end of a season : rather nice when you're 34  So that's a rather bold move.   I'm happy to say that at least half of the guys I see on the ST's fan forums, while fearing he'll come back injured, still think he did the logical thing and are willing to let that pass."

Every club has, except Stade and CLermont. Pau has started on june 15.  And there's the risk he'll come back injured. Or that he'll go to the RWC.  But, really, the problem is that the top 14 is too bloody long.

rugbyunion,3ceulp,Sidus_Preclarum,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:32:58 2015 UTC,"It's not about what internationals Samoa is a part of. The IRB have their international windows and the clubs have a vested interest in not allowing them to sprawl outside their allotted time.   I think this is more a part of a bigger spat between the European clubs and the IRB.   This early on yes the clubs should relent, but they'll see it as a power grab by the IRB. The worst ones I'm are the likes of the Lions tour where players come back broken after being through the island meat grinder. Not so much France but then salary capped English teams are fucked if one of their expensive players picks up an injury over the summer.  That's without the rest periods that mean you lose those players for the crucial opening matches"

rugbyunion,3ceulp,ronnierosenthal,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:06:28 2015 UTC,"This is the prime argument for a global season. All top level club comps to play simultaneously around the world, then all the test matches have a larger, single window in which to play and schedule matches consistently and fairly, plus the players actually get a proper off-season and recovery without having to overlap with Autumn/November tour tests causing burnout and unshakable injuries.  The European competitions especially (Top 14, Premiership, Pro 12) already have a myriad of other sports with which to compete with on the annual European TV schedules so they are reluctant to restructure and risk losing their cash cows which is understandable only from a business perspective.  If technology were good enough to provide a sustainable online model that generated income on par with current broadcast deals then TV wouldn't hold such sway..."

If you want to catch european rugby(champions cup) or domestic leagues like the top14(french), aviva premiership(english), Guinness pro12(Mix of italian, irish, welsh and scottish teams) the channels you will probably mostly be using are sky sports and bt sport. Its just a matter of finding what exact channel the match is on such as sky sports 2 or bt sports 1. Usually you can find the channels matches are going to be broadcast on from this subreddit of upcoming fixtures or you can go to planet rugby. They usually have preview articles for upcoming matches and in those previews they say the exact channel its going to be on.  You can try a test run for the other site which is first row sports. So you can see that they have a link up to watch Samoa v the all blacks. When you click on that link it brings you to the stream where you watch it from which is here. You just have to find out the time for your own timezone that its on.

However, the ref who gave it (forget who it was now) had given a similar one in a league match, so at least he wasn't being inconsistent in any way. Despite missing their captain for most of the game, Wales managed to come very close to winning anyway. So yes, the work luck is quite appropriate. A different ref, and Wales almost certainly win."

Warburton might have got away with it 6 months earler, but ""that tackle"" fell exactly within the parameters for red.  FWIW, IMHO the main reason why Wales lost that semi was that the Welsh scrum weren't nearly as effective without Adam Jones (who was injured). Also, we had lost Priestland to injury, and S Jones and Hook were dire replacements. They had several chances to win the game and couldn't.  The red card comes next on my list."

I'm seriously quite worried about this French fixture, quite annoying seeing new fans or part time fans of rugby in Ireland thinking we're going to rip France a new one and cruise into the semi finals. I'm praying to my shrine of BOD that it goes our way, but you never know with France - they could lose to Italy and beat us in the group stages."

Shame as I do like France quite a lot really.
rugbyunion,3cee3y,ZeSkump,8,Tue Jul 7 07:42:30 2015 UTC,"Their problem runs much deeper than the coach. The French players have had fall outs with their coach as long as I've been following rugby- with Laporte, Lievremont and now PSA. From what I've read there seems to be serious issues for power between the national setup and clubs (players released to the France squad just 1 week before the 6N for example) and an old boys, 'we-know-better' mentality at the top of the FFR. It's chaos, but that's French rugby for you."
rugbyunion,3cee3y,I_will_remember_this,3,Wed Jul 8 10:15:43 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget something else : the cultural fascination for amateur rugby. There is an incredibly dense network of small clubs (the one I played for was rather good, and e had no more than 40 licensed), which has the upper hand above the federation. On the other hand, you can't really compete with huge financial power -and the results too, let's not be petty- of the big clubs, when it comes to the League.  I don't know how it is intricated (which one is a cause or a consequence of which other fact), but what is certain is that there is a tremendous competition between the two, and it doesn't help the building of a coherent and appeased relation between institutions -let alone negotiations for subventions and the status of players.  However, as you said, both in the instiution and on the field, for the French players, ""chaos is a ladder"", as the creepy dude said."

So when a team underperforms, the first reaction is ""pfft, I knew we were worthless anyway"".  So it's not that we don't expect much from our teams, we actually expect way too much. It's just that we're very sore losers: we'd rather tell ourselves we lost because we sucked rather than because the other team was good.  So when a team has poor results for a long time, we start taking it as a joke, and feeling that the team owes us an apology or something. It's pretty sad, but on the other hand, when at some point everybody is already disappointed in you, you can play without pressure."

Wont:   They're France Horrendous Coaching situation Strike will happen (during pool?) Kicking is dodgy at the best of times, only Parra is somewhat reliable.

rugbyunion,3cee3y,ronnierosenthal,6,Tue Jul 7 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"Playing their way is how South Africa lost to Ireland in the Autumn, we knew what to expect and how to counter it (without many of our first choice players) well in advance, despite coming to Dublin after beating the All Blacks. Australia too but with that backline you can create so many chances from nothing, we were lucky to shut them down in the second half (and for that yellow against South Africa, but that's no guarantee of a win/loss), and they had a shit Rugby Championship. Clearly the less predictable team does better against us.   Brute force also tends to beat Ireland, we're not a physically big team - teams that manage to lock us down and beat us up can win, such as Wales and England - I can imagine replaying South Africa in South Africa and losing, our away record isn't great, England and Wales both had our number when they were at home, but all three were outsmarted in Dublin.  Combine unpredictability and size and you have the perfect combination to beat Ireland, ie. France - all France needs to do is stop making mistakes and play accurately and we're fucked. We won in France because the pass was a mile forward, we won in Dublin because we had a ridiculous amount of kickable penalties.   So how will we do in a semi-neutral venue (Cardiff will have an Irish invasion), away from home, against a team that could play in a way that we have no idea what to counter, with enough size and speed to sit down any Irish player? And people think I over react about this French fixture... I hope I'm just overly cautious."
rugbyunion,3cee3y,squeak37,2,Tue Jul 7 23:18:45 2015 UTC,"I've been wary of France for ages, but we have an easier pool because we beat France twice on the trot. Now Italy will be targeting France as the match they can pull a win, not the match against us. We shouldn't ignore Italy, but I think they're going to focus more on France than us, which suits us.  With regards to the actual game... We pulled out the choke tackle for the first time vs. Australia last world cup, I'd say Schmidt has a plan for France.  On a side note, I do not understand why all 5m penalties are not instant tries for us. Chip it up over the line, have Toner grab it and fall, easy 7 points. Harder to do if they see it coming, but could be a lethal surprise attack from close"

France smash through the Quarters with a 50 point margin.

Excluding 1991, they've always reached the last 4. (3x Runners Up, 1x Bronze, 2x Fourth.) Beat Australia in the 2014 Autumn Internationals.   Won't:   Phillipe Saint-Andre's indecision in selecting a consistent XV has ensured that the current team do not gel to the same level as any other Tier 1 XV. Yes, they may be better than Scotland & Italy, but lack of understanding your teammates can be severely detrimental. France have been terrible in the Six Nations since the last RWC; they won the Wooden Spoon in 2013 and haven't finished higher than 4th in the other years. The Top 14's stance of bringing in foreign players for the biggest clubs is effectively killing emerging French talent.

Since then they've looked like they may as well be drunk every time they've played us. They also got pretty close to beating NZ that year and haven't gotten close since.

rugbyunion,3cg0l3,Reds_Klizun,3,Tue Jul 7 17:38:23 2015 UTC,I doubt whether or not he'll make the squad as Lancaster is probably taking Ford and Farrell as his fly halves with Slade (centre) and Goode (fullback) also providing cover there.

However that was the most pointless thing I have ever seen on a rugby pitch  It even got a mention on Wikipedia  Turns out it was a consolation try in a match they were heavily beaten in. Could you imagine if he collided with the physio? Bad news all around

rugbyunion,3cf5k5,wn_,5,Tue Jul 7 15:47:44 2015 UTC,"Nah, dude, Sevens isn't for risking taking out a physio and causing further damage to an injured player. Sure, yeah, he didn't take her out (it was a bloody close thing though), but there's absolutely no need to take that risk. There's showboating, and then there's being an arse."
rugbyunion,3cf5k5,Shadowing_Lemma,3,Tue Jul 7 16:37:53 2015 UTC,I think it's really about how unfazed that physio is. That's a woman who knows how to take care of a man!
rugbyunion,3cf5k5,fr0gnutz,2,Tue Jul 7 21:22:58 2015 UTC,"People really are mad at this? Clever does not care, he is a wildman on the pitch but a really nice guy off it. Clever likes to razz people.   Sevens has a culture where this isn't something to frown upon. If this was 15s, then yea he needs to be punished.   Come on people, Clever is just giving the press something to talk about. This was sevens where his team was losing by a lot."
rugbyunion,3cf5k5,003_,8,Tue Jul 7 16:39:37 2015 UTC,"No one is calling for him to be punished. All that's being said is that diving over a physio tending to an injured player, putting both at risk of considerable harm (or additional harm in the case of the injured player) from collision with 110kg of airborne dipshit, is unnecessarily risky, and a dick move.   Citing the showboating, entertainment culture of sevens is completely missing the point, not to mention inaccurate. There is nothing in the culture of sevens which suggests that risking badly injuring a physio and another player is acceptable."
rugbyunion,3cf5k5,Shadowing_Lemma,-1,Tue Jul 7 18:46:55 2015 UTC,"Yea I understand what COULD of happened. But it didn't. It was a dick move and could of gone horribly. Sevens does have a culture that loves a show. What he did does nothing to his image in my mind. It's who he is. He is an entertainer, and doesn't take things so seriously. I would be more upset if Dan Carter did this. If Clever messed up he would own up to the consequences. And yes, if he did collide with the physio during this stunt, he would of been punished."

Well the Laws still state timing rules like in football somewhat, without the benefit of stopping time and booting it out after 80 minutes straight.  And if you please some grammatical correction.

And then there is the choice to make between bin gefolgt and habe gefolgt, but that doesn’t really matter for this sentence, because normally in German you would say:  Ich habe den (well yes it’s accusative in this variant) Liveticker verfolgt.  gefolgt would suggest, the live ticker was running around somewhere and you went after it, instead of following the events that are written on the ticker."

If you know anything about rugby, no one is taking the pitch the day after a match to jog and run drills. Not even the ABs do that. And of course it's not just a piss-up: everyone on both teams get a chance to recouperate, and chit-chat and take notes on what happened during the match.  That's how rugby is much different and superior to other sports: you try to fucking kill each other on the field, you put your best out, you kick the tires and light the fires, you get knackered, but when the final whistle blows, everyone is friends, and both/all the teams have a huge meal, sing songs to each other, and get hammered together.

rugbyunion,3ccs21,Shadowing_Lemma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:45:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely, I don't agree with the assertion made that Tait wasn't in the same ""hemisphere"" in terms of talent though."
rugbyunion,3ccs21,markturner,3,Tue Jul 7 13:23:24 2015 UTC,It is reasonable though. Henson should have been alongside Shane as one of the handful of modern players recognised among the Welsh all time greats. I don't think anyone has Tait in there.  Henson had about 3 coherent seasons and managed two grand slams and a Lions tour from that.
rugbyunion,3ccs21,G_Morgan,11,Tue Jul 7 17:14:10 2015 UTC,Could someone give me a short rundown of exactly what happened to / with him? He became something of a celebrity and that took precedence over his playing? Help?
rugbyunion,3ccs21,I_do_love_you_peanut,19,Tue Jul 7 01:26:38 2015 UTC,"Attitude, life choices and Charlotte Church were all factors."
rugbyunion,3ccs21,rhydianl,6,Tue Jul 7 01:52:17 2015 UTC,"Bit of a strange one because he went looking for the media attention despite being clearly uncomfortable in the spotlight.  Injuries played a big factor too of course. His Achilles rupture in 2009 (after a long string of unrelated injuries) was essentially the end of him as a player as we knew him. Also broke his leg in a 2011 world cup warm up match, which could have been his re-emergence had he gone to New Zealand but who knows.   I spoke to Shane Williams (sorry, name dropping) about him a year or so back, he basically said that he took time away from the game after all the injuries but never really got back into it. That Gavin had left the game and the game had moved on.  Still a classy player but he's been a bit of a shell for a long while now."
rugbyunion,3ccs21,wn_,4,Tue Jul 7 07:39:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. He was a strange bloke and someone who needed to be very well managed, unfortunately as he was coming through the Welsh setup wasn't in the best state. The most depressing thought is I'm sure if he'd come through a few years later into the current Welsh setup, Gatland would have handled him a lot better.  Such a waste of talent in the end, could have been one of the greats. Genuinely had anything you could have wanted in a 12. Kicking, defence, distribution, eye for a break. Aaaaand now I'm depressed."
rugbyunion,3ccs21,Honey_Otter,16,Tue Jul 7 07:59:11 2015 UTC,"But it worked out well in the end, you guys ended up with Jamie Roberts who can kick, pass, spot a gap...run...into things"

rugbyunion,3ccs21,AnchezSanchez,8,Tue Jul 7 17:56:47 2015 UTC,I still rate Henson as the most complete centre of his generation. None of the current lot can do everything he did as well as he could.  If he had the mentality of someone like Dan Carter I'm sure he could have been the greatest Welsh centre of all time and pushing for one of the best in the world.
rugbyunion,3ccs21,jamiroq,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:41:29 2015 UTC,"the Welsh setup wasn't in the best state   That's the key point. Injuries aside (and I think he had the talent and ability to adapt his game, over time, mitigating the limitations imposed by recurrent injury), there was no one in the Welsh management structure who had any idea how to deal with Gav once his focus started moving away from rugby."

rugbyunion,3ccs21,Anglo_Mana,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:30:13 2015 UTC,"Slow start to his career because he was seen, rightly or wrongly, as having a bad attitude. Famously Steve Hansen left him behind for the 2003 RWC in favour of Garan Evans (who nobody outside Stradey Park considered a rugby player). Strangely it turns out that decision came after a RWC trial game where Henson was actually playing very well but made one mistake on the final whistle.  Got in under Ruddock and won a GS. Got injured. Came back under Gatland who thought the world of him and won another GS. Got injured. Then a lot of fucking around with clubs because he felt the O's did him no favours rushing him back from injuries.  Career petered out the moment he took the daft decision to move to a club where his competition was the coaches boy."

rugbyunion,3cdyln,lapsuscalumni,12,Tue Jul 7 04:08:44 2015 UTC,"It's New Zealand's provincial competition, so a step below super rugby. Is a mix of super rugby players who aren't internationals and club players. There's 14 teams spread across the country and draw from a smaller area than the Super Rugby teams. All blacks are signed with the teams but almost never play due to the competition being on at the same time as international season. I can't remember how much they're paid exactly but I think they generally get somewhere around 20-30k for playing the season."
rugbyunion,3cdyln,linglingdang,9,Tue Jul 7 04:21:23 2015 UTC,"I think I read somewhere the 20-30k is the lowest main squad players are paid. Most players are more than that, but not Super Rugby level money."

A number of NZers would rate the competition a step higher than super rugby because the competition is more personal. More so because in super rugby the teams with the all blacks tend to dominate and the super teams tend to only play in eight locations around the country. So to a number of kiwis this is THE REAL RUGBY CHAMPIONSHIP."

rugbyunion,3cdyln,Ehran,9,Tue Jul 7 07:38:57 2015 UTC,"Others have pretty well explained what the ITM Cup is and about pay. I'm focusing on players alternating between leagues.  In New Zealand, the club rugby season goes along at the same time as the Super Rugby season (Feb/Mar to Jun/Jul), while the ITM Cup overlaps the mid-year tests and The Rugby Championship (Jul/Aug to Sep/Oct).  With the tiers going:  All Blacks > Super Rugby > ITM Cup > Club Rugby   This means that players usually have the opportunity to play in two leagues, the All Blacks and Super Rugby, Super Rugby and ITM Cup, or ITM Cup and Club Rugby.  ITM Cup unions are compensated for players that move into the All Blacks because it means those players can realistically no longer play in the ITM Cup or for their own clubs."
rugbyunion,3cdyln,Supertrinko,3,Tue Jul 7 06:54:27 2015 UTC,"-It is another league like Super Rugby, its the New Zealand national competition. Above club rugby and below super rugby.   -Every New Zealand Super Rugby player that isn't playing test match rugby plays in the ITM cup.    -The players are paid, but not a lot. The non-super rugby players still have other jobs.   The ITM cup is part of New Zealands tiered rugby system.   -At the bottom tier, you have amateur club rugby that you or i would play if we went down to the local rugby club and signed up.   -Then, the very best club rugby players may get selected to play ITM cup rugby  -Then, the very best ITM cup rugby players may get selected to play Super Rugby  -Then, the very best Super rugby players may get selected to play for the All Blacks.   Instances of players climbing up the tiers like that are less common nowadays due to schoolboy prodigies leaping straight into ITM cup or Super Rugby their first year out or going through the sevens avenue, but it does happen.   Here is Nehi Milner Skudder playing amateur club rugby for Massey, then in 2011 he gained selection for the ITM cup side Manawatu, then he made the Hurricanes and now he has made the All Blacks."

rugbyunion,3cdyln,I_will_remember_this,4,Tue Jul 7 11:04:07 2015 UTC,"A bit of an addendum to the already excellent answers: Concurrent to the main ITM cup is the Heartland Championship, which consists of the 12 smallest, mostly very rural local unions. Some players do make their way up from this level, for example Marty Banks was playing for Buller (a small mining region) three years ago, but most young players from these areas get noticed quite early (Dane Coles is from Horowhenua-Kapiti, but moved to Wellington College half way through high school and went into the Wellington development system).  Between 1979 and 2005 the competition had three divisions with promotion and relegation, but there wasn't much variation in which teams were promoted and relegated, particularly between the first and second divisions.Hawke's Bay won the second division four of the five seasons between 2001 and 2005 but kept losing the playoff against the bottom-placed first division team.   Today there are two divisions within the ITM cup, with teams playing all of the teams in their own division and about half the teams in the other division. The two divisions then each have their own semi-finals and finals, with the winner of division two being promoted. In the Heartland Championship the teams 1-4 are split into one finals series, while 5-8 are in another."
rugbyunion,3cdyln,emperorrimbaud,2,Tue Jul 7 08:54:15 2015 UTC,"In an interesting twist, recalled All Black Hika Elliot played for Poverty Bay last season. He is the first player selected for the All Blacks out of a non ITM Cup/ NPC division 1 side in a very long time."
rugbyunion,3cdyln,cape7,2,Tue Jul 7 09:34:21 2015 UTC,"The ITM Cup is a national competition similar to the Currie Cup (South Africa) and the National Rugby Championship (Australia). It's the third tier of rugby in NZ, behind the All Blacks and then the Super Rugby provinces. I'm not certain on exact pay but usually players are paid but at a substantially lower cost than Super Rugby players etc. There is a mix of players involved in the teams, a lot of young blokes working hard to get a gig in a Super Rugby franchise, some lower level Super Rugby players and then a few high quality Super Rugby/International players gaining match fitness. It's a really good league to follow being very competitive with a lot of rivalries but still holding a 'community' feel behind it."

I still remember the away game against Castres where in 58 minutes he had 1 carry for 0 metres, 2/3 successful tackles, 1 lineout take and a knock on.   Next season will be a rebuilding one for Leinster after the aMO'Calypse anyway, they might as well give game time to Moloney, Beirne, Thornbury, Kearney or Denton and hope they develop into a decent player rather than waste it on someone who doesn't seem to care."

If Cheikas tactics worked, and the ARU bought out Kane's contract, I'd have no problem with that. I'd even take Quinn Roux ahead of him + the extra NIQ spot and funds free for another signing elsewhere."
rugbyunion,3cfnbd,amplebooty,6,Tue Jul 7 15:23:27 2015 UTC,"great idea   I think you misspelt ""stupid"". Dude, it's a club competition. This isn't fair to anyone:   Clubs are a business, and the Champions Cup is supposed to be a great money maker. They would have much less opportunities to profit from this with your system. Totally unfair to players in English clubs: less would get to participate in the ERCC, and foreign players wouldn't have even less incentive to stay in England than they have now. They'd all flee to France. I agree that flooding the clubs with foreign players might hurt the national side in the long run (although this isn't proven yet), but it seems pretty healthy (and even necessary) to attract and hire some. They also generate money, which goes back to the first point. No fan would stand by this. Everybody wants to support their team in any competition, not a weird hybrid arbitrarily built. The crowds would undoubtedly be smaller. So, yeah, also money. Totally unfair to other teams in the competition. This was is so obvious I won't bother going into details.   There is absolutely no reason why a country would only field national players in a club's competition. This doesn't make sense. And there is also no reason to merge different clubs for one competition."
rugbyunion,3cfnbd,ConspicuousPineapple,2,Tue Jul 7 16:06:25 2015 UTC,How can Europe be a club competition when up have the ireland their regions and wales got rid of their clubs? This would help the national side and raise the standard of the competition. It wouldn't interfere with the domestic comp.
rugbyunion,3cfnbd,ConspicuousPineapple,3,Tue Jul 7 16:45:28 2015 UTC,"It's a competition between clubs that evolve as such during the whole season, not clubs formed arbitrarily just for one championship.  And the point isn't to help the national sides, it's to provide a way for the best teams in Europe to play in the same tournament, and incidentally provide good rugby for the spectators. If you want big crowds and a big audience, you need to show the best players you have, not weird national teams. This would effectively remove a lot of the appeal from the English league for foreign star players, and in the long run, hurt the clubs. If you hurt the clubs too much, you hurt the sport as a whole.  Ireland and Wales have a different system simply because they can't have a big competition with a lot of teams like England does. And that's a good thing for England, that means they have more teams to choose from, more variety in playstyles, more depth. The difficulty to choose and train players scattered across lots of teams is a problem international teams want to have."
rugbyunion,3cfnbd,pirtesP,2,Tue Jul 7 16:59:14 2015 UTC,"offers some interesting options, english talent wouldn't be scatterd all over england but condensed into 4 teams. just like ireland and wales. with the amount of quality players england has it surprising countries like wales and ireland can properly challange them. on the other hand, when scotland merged all their clubs into 4 (now 2) clubs it didnt benefit them in any way i guess."

rugbyunion,3cfnbd,J0nShannow,2,Tue Jul 7 18:34:33 2015 UTC,"The problem this would throw up for the national team is our depth. At the moment one of our key strengths is out ludicrous depth. Just look at this years 6N where we were decimated with injury and still managed to put in a consistently high performance. It would reduce English player's exposure to top level European rugby to just those 4 teams meaning relatively few would see anything beyond the usual Aviva opponents, which won't help anyone's progression.   The other thing to consider is the clubs themselves would violently oppose this since they stand to lose out on all that sweet Europe money particularly clubs like Bath and Saracens that have a shout at the title and all the rewards that offers.  While I don't think its a stupid idea, French clubs buying up the place does make it look like the future of European rugby is pretty one sided, I don't think things would work out the way you hope. I believe that it would absolutely make England more competitive in the Champions Cup but I also think it would be damaging to England's national team.

rugbyunion,3cckqh,Foveaux,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:03:21 2015 UTC,"That's why we need him. They were both educated in Canterbury, after all! Honestly, we've lost McCaw --- a great player, but not so big a deal when you have Todd to replace you, and then pretty much every fucking first five, and that's it. It's not actually that bad, but we urgently need a new good first five - you need that to do well in playoff rugby. If I was Crusaders management, I'd do everything in my power to get the best first five they could, because besides that, they're deep in every other position.  Taylor/Slade/Carter are out, and we've bought in the second-string Waratahs first five, Ben Volavola. Don't know anything about. Mo'unga's come in from the wider training group, too, but it looks like it's cover for fullback on wikipedia, that's what it says. He played first five for the U20s last year but didn't get selected this year, I don't think. Was also in Canterbury. So those two.  Really, it's frustrating. That's historically the fucking deep deep deep position, and now it's all gone, which is okay, but everything else is deep. Just sign a top level player at that position and then you're set."

rugbyunion,3ca5s7,Myburgher,12,Mon Jul 6 13:00:43 2015 UTC,"Jonathan Kaplan tweeted that because the TMO could not see separation between ball and hand when it was grounded, he should award the try. Clears it up IMO."
rugbyunion,3ca5s7,KiwiMaoriJapan,5,Mon Jul 6 16:48:02 2015 UTC,"Seems pretty reasonable to me.   For those moaning about the try, there is a very good case for a penalty try.  Nehe tried to kick the ball out of Dixons hand which is illegal and a professional foul. Penalty try and 10 mins in the bin.  Nehe's kicking leg prevented Dixons arm in going down any further and dislodged the ball from his hand.   If the ball didn't brush the in-goal then the refs should have awarded a penalty try and binned Nehe for 10.  The refs had 2 choices as far as I am concerned and the Hurricanes should be glad a try was awarded and instead of winging they should look at the stats:  Hurricanes won most of the important stats but turned-over too much ball, 21-15.   Highlanders were far superior in defence too, dominating in all areas.  I think the defining moment person was Sopoanga. He controlled the ground and gave the Hurricanes more opportunities.   I really thought the Hurricanes would win but the Highlanders deserve the credit."
rugbyunion,3ca5s7,Meshkent,2,Mon Jul 6 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"Completely agreed the Highlanders deserved the win. Handsomely.   But, not seeing how that foot was a deliberate kick trying to dislodge the ball. Dixon plants it on the foot, then loses control. As far as I can see, it was simply a trailing foot, not deliberate."
rugbyunion,3ca5s7,KiwiMaoriJapan,2,Tue Jul 7 06:01:21 2015 UTC,"Trailing foot is fine, its his left leg. He kicks it at the ball.   That is the leg that also stops Dixon's movement and dislodges the ball.   I am just saying if people want to argue the try there is a a counter argument for a penalty try.   One angle on the replay looks 50/50, the other looks 90% try, I can understand people being upset but if it wasn't awarded do you think it should be a penalty try?"
rugbyunion,3ca5s7,Meshkent,2,Tue Jul 7 06:21:55 2015 UTC,"Ah... Wow. You're right!   The video on this page proves it. I had a whole answer typed out about how you're wrong, but... yes, Nehe tries to kick the ball out of his hand.   So either try, or penalty try and a yellow. Good spot. I stand corrected."
rugbyunion,3ca5s7,KiwiMaoriJapan,2,Tue Jul 7 06:31:45 2015 UTC,Thanks! I have been downvoted a lot for siding with refs. Its not a popular opinion but I stand by my words and dont mind eating a few downvotes to create interesting discussion.  I remember seeing it live and was wondering if the commentators were going to bring it up but they didn't. I guess they were caught up in the barnstorming run.   I just wonder if that action persuaded the TMO to award the try or whether the TMO genuinely thought it was grounded. We can only speculate...
rugbyunion,3ca5s7,Meshkent,2,Tue Jul 7 07:01:50 2015 UTC,"I wonder about that too. It still seems pretty clear to me that he didn't actually place the ball (see this pic).  In any case, justice done in the end..."
rugbyunion,3ca5s7,KiwiMaoriJapan,2,Tue Jul 7 09:02:44 2015 UTC,"Agree again, in that photo I would not award a try. Not surprised media has decided to print this one.  But check these out. TMO go it right."

rugbyunion,3ca5s7,Meshkent,7,Mon Jul 6 11:31:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there have been quite a few strange TMO decisions in the last few years.   Rugby would benefit from some kind of 'doubt goes to the defender' rule or something. (Akin to cricket, where doubt goes to the batsman). The TMO would have to believe that a try had been scored beyond reasonable doubt, not on the balance of probabilities."
rugbyunion,3ca5s7,MashedHair,7,Mon Jul 6 11:49:22 2015 UTC,Surely Doubt going to the attacker is better for the game and the fans. Disallowed tries would drive a lot of people away
rugbyunion,3ca5s7,Meshkent,2,Mon Jul 6 19:04:17 2015 UTC,"That's a good point as well. We want to reward attacking rugby, so you may well be right that doubt going to the attacker ought to be the rule.   Edit: words."

rugbyunion,3ca5s7,Morfee,5,Tue Jul 7 11:48:42 2015 UTC,"We have that really: The ref should ask ""try/no try"" and benefit will be given to the defender, and ""any reason not to award the try?"" for benefit going to the attacker."

rugbyunion,3ca5s7,Meshkent,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:26:54 2015 UTC,"Yup. The TMO awarded the try. Not sure if it was the ""any reason not to award"" or ""try or no try"" question.   There was one angle that seemed to suggest that it was a try - maybe. The rest seemed to suggest it wasn't."

rugbyunion,3ca8vt,_antipodean_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:22:13 2015 UTC,It's not a tour. It's a one off. Samoa has previously indicated their preference for having matches played in New Zealand because of the greater financial benefits they receive.
rugbyunion,3ca8vt,adequateharpy1,0,Tue Jul 7 03:28:14 2015 UTC,Yet there was a campaign to get them tour/visit there last year.

rugbyunion,3ca8vt,adequateharpy1,-1,Tue Jul 7 04:07:21 2015 UTC,It was a lot bigger than one guy. You obviously think its right that a team who has benefited from talent from the island should never tour the island.

So the NZRU should tour because New Zealand has been a target for Pacific islander migration? What an idiotic suggestion.  I'm guessing that would explain why you're so vocal about South Africa touring Zimbabwe, Zambia, etc.?"
rugbyunion,3ca8vt,adequateharpy1,-2,Tue Jul 7 08:04:44 2015 UTC,Its idiotic not to tour a test playing nation. Zimbabwe is not a test playing nation.

rugbyunion,3cem7y,darthreallynasty,2,Tue Jul 7 10:17:47 2015 UTC,2 years he's been injured and when the rumours first started he stated his loyalty to the Sharks and said he wanted to pay back the loyalty shown while he was injured. Now he's done a 180 and is leaving. So yeah I think I can call him ungrateful. He could of easily said he was looking to move instead of lying and then moving.
rugbyunion,3cem7y,darthreallynasty,2,Tue Jul 7 11:51:01 2015 UTC,Well he probably saw the incredible competition of Dave McDuling coming in and decide to call it a... pffft I couldn't type that with a straight face!

rugbyunion,3cai4c,cynic_male,3,Mon Jul 6 11:41:25 2015 UTC,I feel it will only be closer than people think because we're missing a lot of good players and they won't be going hard in a friendly match before TRC and RWC.  Though still it should be around 40-15 scoreline.
rugbyunion,3cai4c,kiwirish,2,Mon Jul 6 21:20:15 2015 UTC,"That's where I'm putting it myself, maybe marginally closer."
rugbyunion,3cai4c,fernta,5,Tue Jul 7 01:16:37 2015 UTC,"LOVE! I've expressed my opinion on this test match, but it's here, let's do what Kiwis and Samoans are best at - enjoy a great game of Rugby!!"
rugbyunion,3cai4c,jeffrey2ks,-1,Tue Jul 7 00:42:18 2015 UTC,"I still stand by the fact that this game shouldn't be happening. Makes no financial sense, risking players to injuries and due to the timing of the game it cheapens the all black jersey as caps are being awarded to players who wouldn't be there but are because the super rugby final was a couple days ago"
rugbyunion,3cai4c,batzman,14,Mon Jul 6 19:03:35 2015 UTC,"Eh. I like it.  With the AIG money now we can afford a game a year where we probably couldn't so much before.  Players get risked all the time, one more game isn't too much, I bet a lot of the guys are glad of the hit-out before the RC starts. A lot of them haven't played for almost a month.  There will be maybe 4 guys who wouldn't have got a cap at this time if not for this game but that doesn't mean they are not worthy of the jersey. We are losing massive talent in mid field so I have zero problems with auditioning Moala and Ngatai. Prop is another spot where we won't have massive depth so Laulala is fine.  Weber is a bit lucky, but his form has been pretty outstanding, to get as much game-time as he got ahead of Pulu.  Ideally I would like to see us play a fixture exactly like this every year, rotating around Samoa, Tonga and Fiji. It would let us blood some young guys relatively painlessly each year and get the group together with real purpose that bit earlier."
rugbyunion,3cai4c,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,0,Mon Jul 6 19:40:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe they will get a call up next year, maybe they won't but the fact that a ton of players are unavailable does cheapen it. I wouldn't have had a problem with this game if it was bought about on good terms. However the political pressure and the likes of NZ ""owe"" it to Samoa is just BS. If anything Samoa ""Owe"" NZ"
rugbyunion,3cai4c,batzman,4,Mon Jul 6 20:45:31 2015 UTC,"Well, this is a stronger side than the one that played the USA. Which was just a sell out. I feel better about this than that game."
rugbyunion,3cai4c,considerspiders,2,Mon Jul 6 22:52:37 2015 UTC,Wait a second... how does Samoa owe NZ??
rugbyunion,3cai4c,cat-n-jazz,4,Tue Jul 7 05:25:00 2015 UTC,"IF the do owe NZ, it would be because of how many Samoan internationals over the years have spent most/all of their lives in NZ, come up through NZ development pathways, and played some or all of their professional careers in NZ. While only 13 All Blacks have been born in Samoa and I don't think all of them developed their rugby in Samoa. The argument about players of Samoan descent playing for NZ is also quite fraught, because where do you draw the line? If we take it to it's absurd conclusion, every country owes everything to Kenya.  I don't think either really owes the other. I just think it's a good thing for rugby in general for the bigger sides to visit the physically or fiscally smaller nations once in a while."
rugbyunion,3cai4c,emperorrimbaud,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:29:27 2015 UTC,Hm. Fair point.
rugbyunion,3cai4c,cat-n-jazz,2,Tue Jul 7 08:35:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Its criminal that this is the first time the All Blacks have played in Samoa, considering how many player of Samoan descent have played for the AB's and how strong a part Samoan heritage plays in Kiwi culture. There will be a lot of very happy Kiwis of Samoan heritage right now and surely that's what All Blacks games should be about?"
rugbyunion,3cai4c,collkiwi,2,Mon Jul 6 23:31:40 2015 UTC,"How is it criminal? The Pacific Islands lack the infrastructure to make it profitable, and since professionalism that is the only thing that counts"
rugbyunion,3cai4c,kiwirish,3,Tue Jul 7 06:37:22 2015 UTC,"If you want to look at it purely as a business case, Auckland is the largest Polynesian city in the world. By going to the literal grass roots of this demographic you are pushing your product client side, early-stage. You are leveraging your brand identity in an emerging market to produce a sustainable new source of All Black fans. Its low hanging fruit."
rugbyunion,3cai4c,collkiwi,2,Tue Jul 7 08:34:51 2015 UTC,So we should be seeing a game against the Maori All Blacks some time soon then?

rugbyunion,3cai4c,considerspiders,2,Mon Jul 6 22:48:20 2015 UTC,I agree. We should lock all the players away in prison cells lined with cotton wool and put all the team's money in a long term savings account.  Stfu

rugbyunion,3cbbyr,WhiskyBluff,3,Mon Jul 6 18:43:15 2015 UTC,"I would say give him 1 or 2 years. He will end up like Hogg, too good a player for Scotland and therefore will not be considered with the ""greats"" but still an incredible player."

rugbyunion,3cbbyr,WhiskyBluff,2,Tue Jul 7 07:20:06 2015 UTC,"That's a bit of a silly comparison, both are 21 and internationally capped nailed on starters for their club teams.

rugbyunion,3cbbyr,LothianNumpty,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:30:47 2015 UTC,"Even if it was more competitive i would argue Gray would still start. He is genuinely excellent player with good leadership skills and is still young. I just don't think SHC will reach the heights of Webb, Murray or Smith. Don't get me wrong i want him to and i think he is a brilliant player from his performances in a scotland and edinburgh shirt just not world class."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,WhiskyBluff,2,Tue Jul 7 10:05:35 2015 UTC,"Again, he's 21 and has just finished his first full pro season, Webb and Murray are 26, where were they at 21?

rugbyunion,3cbbyr,WhiskyBluff,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:22:44 2015 UTC,9 always seems to be the position we can reliably produce good players in.
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,some_sort_of_monkey,9,Mon Jul 6 18:20:06 2015 UTC,Morgan Parra on his day is nothing to mess with but he hasn't been perfect. Adds the kicking at posts which not many scrum halves can but has been messed around because of it by being played at flyhalf.
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,saviouroftheweak,7,Mon Jul 6 16:38:39 2015 UTC,"Smuth is hard to beat, but there are a lot of fantastic 9s in the game at the moment. Perenara was a joy to watch in the SR final."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,savois-faire,6,Mon Jul 6 17:10:57 2015 UTC,"Perenara is a work horse who's a bit under credited for his work ethic due to such high levels of competition.  I believe he's going to be the next great, though.  He's just so much better than his previous season and that's a trend with him and has been."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,mr_rustic,6,Mon Jul 6 20:52:21 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on who is the best after Smith, and I'm hesitant to believe it's anyone in a Wallaby jersey. But this is how I feel about Australia's scrum halves:  Genia - A tad slow now. Not what he was, but showing flashes of it.  Phipps - Passing has gone wonky this season. But defense is exceptional.  White - Kicks too much (although his kicking game can be very impressive). Passing accuracy and speed is great. I'm curious to see his game without the box kicks.   Stirzacker - Craftiest son of a bitch out of all of them but is still young and developing. In 4 years he'll be giving the world headaches."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,dr_chim_richaldz,5,Mon Jul 6 23:16:54 2015 UTC,"I can't wait to see how Stirzacker turns out, hope it's not disappointing."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,sackrace,12,Mon Jul 6 23:50:08 2015 UTC,Lads this is easy.  It's clearly Peter Stringer
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,arsebiscuits1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:52:28 2015 UTC,Definitely the best over the age of 35.
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,Firehen,6,Tue Jul 7 12:57:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone's that close, at least at the moment. Danny Care was for a while (perhaps even better than Smith was at the time), and then there were the few years where Genia was untouchable. Rhys Webb has the running game, and Conor Murray can control the game, but only Aaron Smith does both to a world class standard."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,Aquapig,4,Mon Jul 6 18:51:45 2015 UTC,What happened to Genia? I remember for 2-3 years he was the No 1 threat on the Wallabies.
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,collkiwi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:05:21 2015 UTC,He got picked up and carried 400 yards down the pitch by Ferris.
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,AAAAAAAHHH,6,Tue Jul 7 12:40:29 2015 UTC,"Ben youngs had a fantastic 6N. Connor Murray is stronger defensively and probably has a better kicking game but youngs is lethal around the ruck. Agree with OP though, smuth is on another level at the moment"
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,kingkreep95,5,Mon Jul 6 19:53:25 2015 UTC,"Fumi is both really unlucky and really fortunate to be playing on the same team as Smith. Great pass, and because of his size he always goes as hard as he can into contact, although it's not always enough. But playing against the world's best will be great for him and Japan in the long run. Would love to see him play more so I can judge his kicking game, but damn I live that son of a bitch."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,Polamora,9,Tue Jul 7 01:09:13 2015 UTC,Well Danny Care was approaching something close to world class in 2014 and then dropped off the boil. Connor Murray is good and probably the best if not top 4 in the NH.
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,amplebooty,4,Mon Jul 6 17:52:42 2015 UTC,Smuth  Murray  Webb
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,Warty_Intrusion,15,Tue Jul 7 14:10:40 2015 UTC,"I might be biased obviously but I would argue that Conor Murray is pushing Smith close. He's the top scrumhalf in the NH by some margin. While his pass doesn't have the snappiness of Smith's, his box-kicking is at least as good if not better, he has tremendous physicality close to the line and in the tackle, and an excellent breakdown game.   In the last couple of seasons he has also emerged as an excellent playmaker, particularly at Munster but still evident for Ireland, directing not just his forwards but also creating opportunities for the backline. This is enormously useful for Ireland due to the steep drop off in experience at 10 behind Sexton.  Smith and Murray are two very different styles of scrumhalf, and as such it's very difficult to say who's definitively better. It's like comparing Andrew Mehrtens and Stephen Larkham."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,wowjiffylube,9,Mon Jul 6 16:31:05 2015 UTC,"Smith and Murray are two very different styles of scrumhalf, and as such it's very difficult to say who's definitively better   Nah, it's definitely Smuth.  Murray I'd say is a clear second though."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,wn_,5,Mon Jul 6 17:01:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, smith way ahead of everybody. Connor Murray has a good chance of being the second best, but aaron smith is way ahead of the pack."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,fernta,6,Tue Jul 7 02:01:24 2015 UTC,In my equally biased opinion Rhys Webb pushes him close these days. Perhaps doesn't control the game as well as Murray but he's the top try scorer in the Pro12 and has improved more than any other Welshman this year.
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,Babirusa1,6,Mon Jul 6 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"True, probably the most dangerous of the lot with ball in hand and capable of turning a game on it's head by himself. For me though, his kicking game and decision-making aren't quite there yet, but those can be improved in time. Terrific player to watch."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,wowjiffylube,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:56:35 2015 UTC,Agree with that. Webb's gone from no hoper to good test scrum half in the space of about 2 seasons. But there's still a long way to go in terms of composure and consistency.  I'd say he's probably somewhere around Danny Care in terms of style and ability.
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,wn_,3,Mon Jul 6 17:04:35 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to say because the best scrumhalves in the World right now have quite contrasting styles.  Smith is #1 we can all agree. Now there's a few good options. The best tactically is Murray with a great kicking game. The most talented is Genia, how many scrumhalves can step five people and run 50m tries? Both Webb and Care are ""x-factor"" kinda players. Then you have the more classic guys, not doing much fancy but with a quick and efficient game: Youngs, Phipps or Parra.  On form from the last few international games I'd say that Youngs and Murray are slightly above the rest."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,fettsack,2,Mon Jul 6 19:59:59 2015 UTC,"Ruan Pienaar, great hands, kicking is top notch and cracking running with the ball. So good he is, he can also play outhalf."
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,chief_boom,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:41:15 2015 UTC,Agree 100%. Ulster do not play as well when he is not on the pitch.
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,arsebiscuits1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:52:11 2015 UTC,He's had more than a few dodgy performances in an ulster jersey though.
rugbyunion,3cbbyr,WhiskyBluff,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:16:04 2015 UTC,Who hasn't? He's had way more good games than bad. Ruan makes such a big difference to the Ulster team. Gives the team that extra wow factor. No other player makes such a difference to a team (maybe Nick Williams when his head is screwed on properly).

rugbyunion,3cbbyr,chief_boom,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:07:39 2015 UTC,consistency is part of being the worlds best. Dont think Ruan is consistent enough to be up there. There are plenty players who on their day are great but being a truly world class player is about performing at that level all the time. Any professional athlete will tell you that.

His service is sharp and he can kick, plus his partnership with Dan Biggar is so well-oiled now they basically act as one player. He's the scrum-half Wales has wanted and needed for a very long time."

I will say this though; I feel as if the Springboks over the last few years since 2011 have not had a consistent side, people coming and going far to regularly. We see J.Foure, du Preez all coming back. F.Steyn has been in and out of the fray for a while. Its weird. I feel like this will cost the Springboks more than Vermuelen being out, which don't get me wrong, is a huge loss if he doesn't play!  Time will tell."
rugbyunion,3ca6w9,SAGuy90,10,Mon Jul 6 10:32:20 2015 UTC,Agree. The fact that we're months away from the world cup and don't know:  1) Who our backup locks are  2) Who our backup 8 is  3) Who our first choice 9 is  4) Who our first choice 10 is  5) Who our captain is  6) Who our centre pairing will be  Is pretty atrocious.

rugbyunion,3ca6w9,SAGuy90,3,Mon Jul 6 11:36:15 2015 UTC,"That is really kind of you to say, but to be honest, our depth isn't that of NZ, where we have one style of play and that everyone adapts to that and understands it. Our style is so erratic half our own players don't seem to know whats going on. Look at the Super 15, if it wasn't for the stupid log points setup we would not have had a chance."

rugbyunion,3c9r1z,white_falcon,14,Mon Jul 6 05:12:44 2015 UTC,Thank god for that. Had to be Moore. Because Hooper isn't anywhere near assured of a starting spot (I'd pick Pocock to start every day of the week) and also because Moore is just a more reliable leader to me. Always good to have a captain in the front row to directly speak to the referee at scrum time too.  I suspect both VC's (AAC and Hooper) will be starting on the bench for much of the international year.
rugbyunion,3c9r1z,RTJ120,6,Mon Jul 6 06:25:32 2015 UTC,"While I don't disagree, wouldn't it be weird to name vice captains who weren't going to make the starting team?   Obviously bar injury you would expect Moore will play at least 60 mins of each match but even if AAC and/or Hooper came on at 50/60 mins as ""Impact Players"" and assumed the captaincy aren't they going to be missing the ""feel"" of the game and sort of start cold?"
rugbyunion,3c9r1z,RTJ120,14,Mon Jul 6 06:32:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe AAC is further up the wing totum pole than I give him credit for, but I suspect the VC's are more for a quasi-leadership group off the field than even needing to be on field.   To the point, I just can't see how Pocock isn't going to be the starting 7 after his season and given how much more effective he is than Hooper at the breakdown.   Wing is where he have the most depth to me so AAC has competition but he may well be starting on the wing, so at the very least he could be in the starting side."
rugbyunion,3c9r1z,sackrace,5,Mon Jul 6 06:37:51 2015 UTC,"I bet they play AAC on the wing, they seem determined to play him somewhere."
rugbyunion,3c9r1z,dr_chim_richaldz,8,Mon Jul 6 07:52:25 2015 UTC,"With his defence, kicking ability, strong fend and speed, it would be a shame to leave him off the field. People criticise his ability or reluctance to pass, but if that's the case, wing is probably perfect."
rugbyunion,3c9r1z,sackrace,3,Mon Jul 6 10:02:55 2015 UTC,"That is one view. I tend to think playing a fantastic centre on the wing rather than any one of our specialist wings is a bit daft. Plus i think he is a bit slow these days, when he was younger he had the pace to be a real wing option but not so much any more. Just my opinion."
rugbyunion,3c9r1z,dr_chim_richaldz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:06:51 2015 UTC,"I agree he's probably not as fast as he was. But our wing options are Naiyarovoro, Horne, AAC and now Cummins due to Speight's ban/leave. Horne will undoubtedly be on one wing, I would have guessed Speight on the other, but I think it will be AAC because he brings a more complete game than others, even without the natural pace a winger usually has. I assume Kuridrani will be in 13.   Whatever happens, I'm pretty excited to see the 23 man team."
rugbyunion,3c9r1z,RTJ120,3,Mon Jul 6 10:13:37 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd have Mitchell as a lock to start. His experience, finishing nous and vital left boot make me feel he's essential."

rugbyunion,3c9r1z,MasterEk,3,Mon Jul 6 10:15:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Pocock is the much better player and should be the captain IMO. He is a thinker while Moore is only captain because he doesn't have much competition for his spot. My one defining memory of Moore will always be when Giteau told him to shut the f&k up so the brumbies could knock Moores previous team the reds out of playoff contention with a penalty when Moore just wanted them to kick the ball out.  I gained a lot of respect for Giteau then."

I'm not so sure of current form, but he rises to big games and he has wrecked the All Blacks in the past.  He's also one hell of a leader.

rugbyunion,3c9r1z,rhydianl,5,Mon Jul 6 07:23:09 2015 UTC,Moore is a great choice. He deserves the Captaincy. He has been a top quality player and loyal for years. I think his experience is crucial in a RWC year. Hooper still too green. Look at McCaw in 07.
rugbyunion,3c9r1z,xValarax,9,Mon Jul 6 07:23:35 2015 UTC,"Thank God. As great of a player Hooper is, he's a been one of the worst captains I've seen.  No doubt once he gets a little more experience he would flourish in the role."
rugbyunion,3c9r1z,teds_bear_hugs_hurt,9,Mon Jul 6 05:52:02 2015 UTC,I think worst is a huge understatement. He was thrown in the deep end through injury and didn't come out if it shamed. A bit of work on ref management and the continuation of his rugby skills would make him a solid leader.
rugbyunion,3c9r1z,It_Is_Known,2,Mon Jul 6 10:02:27 2015 UTC,"Plus, he´s just 23 years old. Its hard to be a good captain at that age."
rugbyunion,3c9r1z,ridernorth,4,Mon Jul 6 12:50:54 2015 UTC,"Seems a good choice. Interesting that Pocock didn't even get selected as a vice-captain. I wonder if that's because of his lack of time in the Wallabies jersey over the past few years, or if it's because of something else."

It's rugby not politics.   I agree with everything he has stood for and commend him for using his profile to effect change on these matters, hence why it is best if he stays as a regular but influential player"
rugbyunion,3c9r1z,shulzi,7,Mon Jul 6 07:12:35 2015 UTC,I couldn't have said it better. You're bang on the money. Pocock is a great guy and he stands up for important causes however his values are not necessarily the values of the ARU. Too risky.

In my opinion the ARU have shown a lack of leadership in their treatment of Pocock. On the flipside of the Wallabies don't like standing behind him it's reasonable to not make him captain.  With all that said, Moore is a fine choice and having a front rower as captain makes sense. Two Dads and Hooper wouldn't be my VC choices but I think that the only other person in the backline who could possibly take it is Gits and he has been out of the fold for too long. Maybe Phipps would have been a good choice but it's all done now anyway and I don't think anyone can be too unhappy with the outcome.  My 2¢."

rugbyunion,3caok7,TheAxeofMetal,6,Mon Jul 6 12:42:32 2015 UTC,"Well that's a weird decision. I understand the thinking of the ref, trying not to be unfair, but adapting the rules as you see fit is the last thing you should do as a ref. It's infuriating for at least one of the teams when that happens. It weakens your credibility and makes the players think you don't actually know how to ref. When you don't know what really happened, make a call, but a sensible one.  In this case, I probably wouldn't have allowed the try if I hadn't seen the grounding and had a reasonable doubt that he did, and it would have been a 22m drop out. I also think it goes in the spirit of the game more, as scoring on a ""fuck up"" from the other team doesn't feel quite right."
rugbyunion,3caok7,ConspicuousPineapple,2,Mon Jul 6 15:03:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, while as I of course have a personal involvement and think that the try should have been awarded, I would have preferred a 22m dropout because at least that is reasonable."

rugbyunion,3caok7,fernta,2,Mon Jul 6 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure if that's kosher, but you can see the reasoning. Trying to keep the game going. I still think giving it a try would have been the right call, surely they'd be able to roughly see?  Did you score off the scrum?"
rugbyunion,3caok7,fernta,2,Mon Jul 6 13:24:37 2015 UTC,"We did not, I kinda think that we where all a bit put off by the call and not fully focusing, it wasn't our best game. The ref had some odd calls though, like not allowing the tackled player to put the ball back, I had tackled, shown hands then gone for the ball like you should, bam pinged for not allowing him to place the ball back."
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,afunky,27,Sun Jul 5 10:47:11 2015 UTC,"If I scored a try like that, I'd definitely be searching for mentions of name at 4am too."

rugbyunion,3c6q6n,xValarax,9,Sun Jul 5 13:23:23 2015 UTC,Well there we have it great TRY!
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,saviouroftheweak,-5,Sun Jul 5 15:41:43 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/BY6OqcovEQg?t=1m12s  Watch the ball rotate unimpeded after the attempt at grounding. It's made contact with only the leg as the ball continues to spin long ways under itself. Ball is in the air spinning at the height it was supposedly grounded at.   Then watch at 1:20 slow mo shows the ball hit calf and you can still see calf under the ball. Then it begins the spin unimpeded and never touches anything else before he loses it forwards.
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,phro,8,Sun Jul 5 16:53:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for the link. I see downward pressure still applied as it touches the grass. Great try IMO.
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,ThaFuck,2,Mon Jul 6 02:54:36 2015 UTC,"That's interesting I see the opposite. The first angle at 1:12 doesn't seem to show it touching the grass until after it's released. At full speed it looks like a try though.  Still I don't support either team, so I'm not going to lose sleep over it :P"
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,onemanandhishat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:45:09 2015 UTC,I'm neutral too (Chiefs). I think it's one of those calls that will simply be divided. The slow mo has been watched by everyone enough times now that it's never going to be a black and white affair.
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,ThaFuck,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:00:08 2015 UTC,"I get super bored by these discussions. Kinda agree with you, somewhat controversial try.. TMO ruled one way or the other. Move on..  Refs decided what happened, from that point it did happen, little more point saying whether it did or didn't beyond that."
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,tomasnz,2,Mon Jul 6 11:52:18 2015 UTC,You only need to have your hand on the ball when it touches the ground. His hand is still on the ball as its weight hits the ground
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,Shunto,0,Mon Jul 6 02:59:47 2015 UTC,"Watch again. Grounding is on the leg and then it begins an unimpeded spin. It is maybe grazing blades of grass, but the ball spins a full revolution in the air without going downwards any more after the initial attempt."
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,phro,-7,Mon Jul 6 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"I was actually shocked when they awarded that try. Watch the replay. He grounds the ball on another player's foot, lets it go, then it falls onto the pitch. I've probably rewatched that specific bit of footage a dozen times. It wasn't grounded.  Then again, I may just be bitter because the Hurricanes are my team."
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,temalyen,12,Sun Jul 5 15:02:38 2015 UTC,Hurricanes should have mowed the in-goal a bit better.

rugbyunion,3c6q6n,saviouroftheweak,-4,Sun Jul 5 23:15:19 2015 UTC,"Too hard to tell from that angle, too elevated and far away to be definitive, the first angle shown was in the best position and clearly showed it wasn't touching grass while in control."
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,xxihostile,6,Sun Jul 5 23:50:36 2015 UTC,Disagree and so did the tmo and that's all folks
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,saviouroftheweak,-6,Sun Jul 5 23:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah because TMOs in super rugby have proven to be so competent this year. Whatever man, the highlanders still deserved the win but I am sick of people saying that was a try."
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,xxihostile,6,Mon Jul 6 00:07:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah because TMOs in super rugby have proven to be so competent this year.   As opposed to the infallible accuracy of arm chair analysts watching the exact same replay?  Get over yourself. At this point it is, and will always be, an opinion. Yours isn't necessarily the correct one that everyone should accept just because you say it is."

At the end of the day and in the spirit of the game, awarding the try was a perfectly reasonable decision to make.  If you're still disgruntled, then that's just the nature of the game. Tell the Hurricanes to defend their line better next time."
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,Shunto,-8,Mon Jul 6 02:57:48 2015 UTC,"Referees aren't supposed to referee according to the spirit of the game or just because ""he deserved the try"", they referee to the rulebook which the TMO did not in that try decision."
rugbyunion,3c6q6n,xxihostile,2,Mon Jul 6 03:27:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that's how the referee should approach the situation; I'm saying that's how you should.  The referee's did approach the situation against the rule-book, and they decided it was a try. Get over it."

rugbyunion,3caazp,fettsack,3,Mon Jul 6 11:49:22 2015 UTC,"The Pro12 is probably the most annoying tournament to watch on TV, with not all coverage being in English. Sky Sports (only paid broadcaster), TG4 (Irish), BBC Alba (Scottish), BBC2 NI, BBC 2 Wales, RTÉ, S4C (Welsh) - sometimes you forget to check which channel it's available on, if it's even being shown - because despite all of the broadcasters, some matches are still not televised.  I'm unsure who covers the Pro12 in Italy, if it's even covered. All European matches are split between Sky Sports and BT Sports, leading to it being a pain in the arse again if you forget to check in advance which broadcaster holds the rights to the matches you want (or if you check and forget/get mixed up)  As for Irish matches, 6 Nations is free on RTÉ as are the Autumn Internationals. The Summer Tours are behind Sky Sports.   The RWC15 is unfortunately being covered by TV3, who in their unending wisdom have brought in fans' favourite Stuart Barnes. RWC11 was covered by Ryle Nugent and RTÉ, which gave the fans a regular dose of Rylegasms. RWC07 was covered by TV3 and was shite."
rugbyunion,3caazp,harblstuff,3,Mon Jul 6 12:08:04 2015 UTC,"All Wallaby test matches are on free to air, and if you're in Sydney you get one game of the local comp per week (the Shute Shield) as well.  For the World Cup all Wallaby matches will be free to air and probably the QF, SF and GF at least to NSW and Queensland.   However, given the time zones, only the diehards will be watching (and there are fewer and fewer of those)"
rugbyunion,3caazp,strewthcobber,2,Mon Jul 6 12:24:08 2015 UTC,"In Germany, we will get 20 matches on Eurosport, including opening ceremony and final, plus the most important group games of England, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa and as looks like all games from the knock-out stages bar one or two exeptions, which will be on their paid channel.  I hope this won’t be a one time hit wonder like it was on Sport1/DSF or the one year they tried to show the Heineken Cup/Six Nations and where sued by a Spanish TV company because they send in on FTA when they had it on a pay channel.  So the World Cup really is the only time, there is any rugby on German TV, be it FTA or Pay-TV."

rugbyunion,3caazp,tomasnz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:39:30 2015 UTC,"In France, most of the rugby is on Canal+ which isn't freeview.  TF1 the biggest private freeview channel got the rights to the biggest games and the knockout stages for the RWC but otherwise they don't show any rugby, which explains why their coverage every four years is so goddamn awful.  France 2, the biggest national channel gets some of the big European Cup games and the Six Nations every year. The quality of their coverage is far superior to TF1 but not as good as Canal+.  France 4, smaller national channel, showed all the France group games and knockout stages of the Women's World Cup last year, with a decent coverage as well."

NZ is odd in the high the number of households with pay TV subscriptions, and having no laws or regulations mandating a certain amount of sport be broadcast free to air. Sky has such a huge advantage over TVNZ and Mediaworks when it comes to bidding that those two have almost completely given up broadcasting sports"
rugbyunion,3caazp,emperorrimbaud,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:22:55 2015 UTC,Here in the UK the 6 nations is free to view and so is the world cup this year but all the club level is behind subscription plus the autumn internationals are behind subscriptions too.

Then you can take the marketability boner you have been nursing for some time and use it to support Real Madrid and the New England Patriots as well. It comes down to this, you clearly are only interested in a team when they are the best.

My ITM cup team is shit but I still support them 100% the Chiefs were shit for 15 years but I still went to their games. What I was getting at was that because the All Blacks are the best and most winning side in rugby they are able to market their brand better than most.

That tells me you are interested in the All Blacks 'brand'. Ie your happy to see them play great attacking rugby, but when others replicate this style you still insist they are boring.

In the NH, if they can blow, they're damn well going to blow. Yes, yes; I know im being subjective and generalising, but as a whole, defences are favoured in the NH."
rugbyunion,3c88we,amplebooty,3,Mon Jul 6 08:39:25 2015 UTC,"You raise a good point but some SH refs let too much go on for the sake of a flowing game. Knock ons in rucks are missed all the time, offside doesn't exist a lot of the time, hands in the ruck happens all the time etc. The sort of reffing in Super Rugby is not what you need/want in internationals but on the other hand you don't want the whistle coming out all the time."

rugbyunion,3c88we,amplebooty,2,Mon Jul 6 08:55:33 2015 UTC,I think it also might have something to do with super rugby being an international competition and refs are put under a lot of pressure to make popular calls.

rugbyunion,3c88we,cape7,2,Tue Jul 7 01:43:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, i think thats how all games should be refereed, its just better viewing"
rugbyunion,3c88we,amplebooty,2,Mon Jul 6 09:41:19 2015 UTC,But rules are rules and at times i get annoyed watching (as a neutral) refs miss clear penalties.
rugbyunion,3c88we,cape7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:51:03 2015 UTC,"Its not a simple case of rules are rules though because there is so much scope for interpretation. If referees really got strict and whistled every little thing they possibly could, the game would grind to a halt. If its up to me, as a neutral, i would rather the game flowed freely. As long as the referee is consistant, im fine with him letting little knockons from the halfback go, or telling a 7 to get his hands off and giving him a bit of time to get out of there before blowing it up."
rugbyunion,3c88we,amplebooty,2,Mon Jul 6 10:06:23 2015 UTC,"I like a good flowing game as much as anybody but i don't like seeing it at the expense of the rules. Obviously it being rugby it's very hard to ref and you need to make a few decisions at each ruck. Nigel owens usually gets the balance right but for me SH refs are far too lenient at times and can be frustrating during internationals when one team is flying off their feet, having hands in the ruck and not being penalised."
rugbyunion,3c88we,cape7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:09:29 2015 UTC,"Well, 'too lenient' is subjective, i think that referees in the North are too strict and end up turning it into a start stop affair that just grinds on. Personally, i'm fine with a referee letting a team fly in off their feet or have hands in the ruck as long as he is a) constistant in his rulings and b) calls it the same way for both teams. If the opposition is coming in off their feet, have a word to the referee, if he doesn't have a problem with it then don't sit around crying about it, you just need to adjust. Those sort of adjustments make great teams imo"
rugbyunion,3c88we,amplebooty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:29:15 2015 UTC,", i'm fine with a referee letting a team fly in off their feet or have hands in the ruck as long as he is a) constistant in his rulings and b) calls it the same way for both teams   That's a bit of a paradox as it suggests a ref will occasionally penalise an offence but not all the time. Consistently inconsistent is your preferred approach?"
rugbyunion,3c88we,cape7,0,Mon Jul 6 10:33:56 2015 UTC,"Well rugby isn't black and white mate, its not simply a case of 'rules are rules' because there is so much that comes to personal interpretation.   If you are asking, 'do i think a referee should look at the exact same offense committed in the exact same way and call it a penalty sometimes but not other times' then no, that is the opposite of what i am saying.   To reiterate, refereeing often comes down to personal interpretation, they will have a particular threshold that an offense has to reach before they call it, some are more leinient than others and thats fine, as long as they use the same threshold every time for both teams.   For example, you're not allowed to go off your feet at the ruck. However, lets say the defending team only commits one man to the ruck, and the attacking team sends 5 in there, causing the guy at the front goes off his feet due to 4 guys behind him and only one opposition player to oppose him. Technically the attacking team has broken the rules, but many referees would say that the attacking player wasn't intending to seal the ball off and that the defending team had no hope of competing for possession in that scenario anyway, the balls available at the back so play on.   What i'm saying is that i'm fine with both interpretations there, as long as you are consistant in what constitutes a penalty, and you call it the same way for both teams."

rugbyunion,3c6tfm,hypertension13,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:16:16 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. :)  Hooper's not been bad this season, but hasn't been tearing up trees, either. Considering that Moore has been confirmed as the Australian captain for the World Cup, Hooper's place is now arguably far from secure. For my money, for all that Hooper gives attacking verve in broken play, Pocock's ability at the breakdown in particular, is irreplaceable."
rugbyunion,3c6tfm,sdre,2,Mon Jul 6 11:56:44 2015 UTC,Hooper is the biggest Seagull in Aus rugby. Plays more like a back IMO.  Also Pocock is the top of my rugby man-crush club so I'm very biased towards him.

rugbyunion,3c6hyh,FourthAlchemist,5,Sun Jul 5 13:32:36 2015 UTC,"Highlanders relied heavily on fekitoas defensive reads and pace, defending quite narrow all night. Almost came undone here but it was a gamble that payed off."
rugbyunion,3c6hyh,twoshoesjacky225,5,Sun Jul 5 14:45:44 2015 UTC,Good point. Fek has to be the best defensive reader in the game at the mo. He was responsible for most for so many shut-downs of Hurricanes plays on the night.
rugbyunion,3c6hyh,KiwiMaoriJapan,5,Sun Jul 5 15:27:57 2015 UTC,"In Chiefs vs Highlanders, there was a beautiful tackle from Fekitoa on Andrew Horrell.  He completely reads the play in that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZEKZfeW8B4"

rugbyunion,3c6hyh,I_Gets_The_Reference,7,Sun Jul 5 08:22:48 2015 UTC,I'd say the pass was a little to blame but most of the fault goes to Savea.  If it had been a flat pass then it would have been a certain try.

rugbyunion,3c606v,darthreallynasty,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:24:40 2015 UTC,Taqele has a pretty loose carry though. His hands are too big.

rugbyunion,3c606v,SquidgyGoat,4,Sun Jul 5 07:29:21 2015 UTC,Physically Nadolo and Naiyaravoro seem similar except Nadolo is quicker. So Nadolo.  Although Naholo might be the hardest to actually have a chance of taking down because he is the most agile and quick of the 3.
rugbyunion,3c606v,assorti,3,Sun Jul 5 10:04:57 2015 UTC,"having seen Nadolo in the flesh, Nadolo.  Freakishly huge human being."

rugbyunion,3c4zjp,threalseymourskinner,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:56:24 2015 UTC,"what are you talking about? the highlanders scored twice as many tries as the canes, i feel like a 7 point margin fairly reflects that..."
rugbyunion,3c4zjp,gaz_caulfield,5,Sat Jul 4 23:29:29 2015 UTC,"If the last pass to Savea has been in front of him he scores on that play 9 out of 10 times, guaranteeing a 2 point margin. The canes were in in until the Banks droppie"

rugbyunion,3c4zjp,threalseymourskinner,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:16:13 2015 UTC,It should have been around 35-32.
rugbyunion,3c4zjp,BZH_JJM,4,Sun Jul 5 06:45:50 2015 UTC,I'd agree with that. I also think it's right up there in the debate of which Super Rugby final was the best out of the 20. There's been lots of close finals but not many (if any) as entertaining and high quality as 2015.
rugbyunion,3c4zjp,allnightshort,3,Sun Jul 5 07:08:43 2015 UTC,1998 final (Blues V Crusaders) was pretty exciting - A Crusaders come back win the the dying minutes (through a James Kerr try from memory).
rugbyunion,3c4zjp,afunky,2,Sun Jul 5 10:39:29 2015 UTC,"A pretty monumental victory too, given that the Blues had won both of the championships up until that point, and that it started the Crusaders' dynasty."

rugbyunion,3c4zjp,allnightshort,3,Sun Jul 5 09:27:45 2015 UTC,Didn't watch most of the Super Rugby season but it was a fantastic game in and of itself. The score doesn't demonstrate how close it was. The whole thing was decided by a handful of moments. Incredible from start to finish.
rugbyunion,3c4zjp,J0nShannow,6,Sat Jul 4 22:57:33 2015 UTC,I thought the hurricanes vs the waratahs in Wellington was the best match. Both teams had their moments of relentless dominance and brilliance. It's a pity the waratahs couldn't maintain that level throughout the season.  Disclaimer: I missed the first 18 minutes of the final so my opinion might be invalid.
rugbyunion,3c4zjp,jbarbz,11,Sun Jul 5 00:19:41 2015 UTC,"That first 18 was some of the most physical rugby I've watched. Both teams absolute bricks, in both attack and defense. Pretty much watching two trucks hitting head on consistently."
rugbyunion,3c4zjp,FerociousSalmon,2,Sun Jul 5 02:03:25 2015 UTC,"I will definitely track down a replay and watch it. When I started watching at 18 mins in, the game looked unrivaled this year with the intensity and skills on display. However, I think both teams were a bit worn out in the second half and mistakes and nerves crept in (understandably). Absolute cracking final nevertheless and certainly leagues better than anything the Reds dished out this year.  Edit: Watched it. It seems I originally switched it on moments after the best run of play - the 3-4 minutes ending at 19 mins in. Cracking stuff."

rugbyunion,3c60pj,bradders90,0,Sun Jul 5 20:22:00 2015 UTC,Nigel Owens reffing
rugbyunion,3c54an,DrFaithfull,7,Sat Jul 4 21:47:09 2015 UTC,"Absolutely - I genuinely believe Poite treats Australia more harshly than he does other sides, particularly around scrum time. Will play into the cynical English scrum's hands.  I was a Joubert fan up until the Waratahs/Highlanders semi final - he makes me nervous now.  All-in-all not super positive about the appointments in any of the big games!"
rugbyunion,3c54an,cubeyescube,4,Sat Jul 4 23:02:41 2015 UTC,I think Poite was the ref in the 3rd lions test as well; the one where Alex Corbisiero and Adam Jones dominated the wallaby scrum.
rugbyunion,3c54an,rugbyfiend,7,Sat Jul 4 23:10:13 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately 1 or 2 dominant scrums mean that every 50/50 decision for the rest of the match went against the Wallabies. Don't get me wrong, we would have probably lost anyway, I don't think we were ever going to recover from Smith going off, and Mogg being shit."
rugbyunion,3c54an,rugbyfiend,5,Sun Jul 5 02:57:56 2015 UTC,Yeah man we're fucked come scrum time with Poite in charge. England will definitely be a scrum-heavy match too.
rugbyunion,3c54an,cubeyescube,3,Sun Jul 5 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"I am very optimistic about our scrum. Time will tell but I wouldn't be surprised if it is the better of the four southern hemisphere teams. That's a massive, massive call but the stars are aligning well in terms of form - we've got four dominant props - and the Wallabies organisation top-down know how important the set piece will be.  I even think legitimately we will be able to achieve parity or dominance with the English and Welsh. Yes, a huge call.  BUT, like I said, it's almost as though Poite legitimately doesn't like the Wallabies. Not only does he give us no stick or respect at all but he ignores teams who play silly buggers with us also.   As an aside, the scrum trick de jour these days is to fake an opposition's early push by laying off before the ball comes in. Works well if a scrum knows they have the rub of the green - expect the English to give it a go or two come September!"
rugbyunion,3c54an,rugbyfiend,2,Sun Jul 5 06:47:31 2015 UTC,"That is optimistic indeed! I think with scrums, any team on their day can be fantastic, but that doesn't make it likely. I.e. when the Wallabies dominated England's scrum on the 2012 Spring Tour, that was a glorious island in a sea of mediocrity."
rugbyunion,3c54an,reddititis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:05:43 2015 UTC,"Poite is French, French award dominant scrum every time, if you get one good push and then collapse next few scrums you'll get a reset at worst. If you get milled, he'll switch."
rugbyunion,3c54an,jbmass,0,Sun Jul 5 20:46:00 2015 UTC,Three months before the games and the excuses are already out. Incredible.

rugbyunion,3c54an,HTtakesphotos,3,Sun Jul 5 01:16:28 2015 UTC,No effect. All Blacks' easy pool should eliminate any undue influence by poor refereeing - not that I imagine there to be any of that.
rugbyunion,3c54an,G_Morgan,3,Sun Jul 5 06:08:38 2015 UTC,Whichever referee we get is a horribly biased cunt who needs to be expunged from the game for ruining our obviously otherwise unstoppable RWC campaign.
rugbyunion,3c54an,dantailby,2,Sun Jul 5 18:14:48 2015 UTC,As an England fan I'm pretty happy with Poite for the Australia game. We'd look to use our pack anyway but the scrum dominance and the penalties that will inevitably come from Poite will play a big part I think.   Hard to judge the rest but nothing is be too worried about.
rugbyunion,3c54an,wn_,2,Sun Jul 5 08:11:23 2015 UTC,I'm hoping Ireland v France will be a good game as Owens is reffing. (Yay I have tickets)
rugbyunion,3c54an,craftycrifty,2,Sat Jul 4 23:11:16 2015 UTC,"Worst possible outcome really. Joubert for the Aussies and Garces for England plays to our weaknesses in both matches.  Garces will crucify our scrum against England if we can't get parity, and the aussies will have a field day at the breakdown with a more lenient SH ref.   If it was the other way round and we had the Frenchman for Australia and Joubert for England I'd be chuffed. Oh well."
rugbyunion,3c54an,jbmass,2,Sun Jul 5 10:22:15 2015 UTC,"Considering Pollock gave up international refereeing after that Scotland vs France debacle, it seems we've landed him for an unfortunately, disproportionate number of games. i.e anything >0"

rugbyunion,3c54an,reddititis,-1,Sun Jul 5 15:18:04 2015 UTC,"Guys - a ref could never have that big an impact on the game.  Let's take South Africa vs Australia in the quarter-final last time around. Yes, South Africa were dominant and arguably the better team on the day. BUT did referee choices cost them the match?  No. It was their fault to let Pocock steal balls off his feet. They should have pinned him to the ground by sitting on him.   Realistically, how many refs actually understand the offside rule anyway? Not many. It's very difficult, so don't blame it on the ref.  For a full breakdown of my finest breakdown, see here."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,rektd,39,Sat Jul 4 13:30:26 2015 UTC,"For me he got the ball down, and regardless, honestly one of the best tries I have seen, he carried three blokes with him a full 7/8 yards to get to the line in the first place.  The bar I was in went mental."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,ron_manager,14,Sat Jul 4 14:11:44 2015 UTC,I feel like the title takes away from the awesomeness of this try
rugbyunion,3c3o01,saviouroftheweak,7,Sat Jul 4 14:26:10 2015 UTC,A blade of grass in it but definitely a try.   I think he channeled Whitelock for that try.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,KiwiMaoriJapan,15,Sat Jul 4 16:57:40 2015 UTC,"As a Canes supporter, I didn't want it to be a try, but it was perfectly fair to award it."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,ycnz,23,Sat Jul 4 20:23:16 2015 UTC,"Try all day. A phenomenal one. The side of his hand is still putting pressure on the ball while it's touching the grass. If that's not a try, it's a millimeter from being one and when the margin of error is so incredibly slim, in the spirit of the game the try should be awarded"
rugbyunion,3c3o01,deadlysyntax,19,Sat Jul 4 14:40:33 2015 UTC,Ball touched grass without his hand coming off the ball.   No problem with that being a try.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,HisHaskness,9,Sat Jul 4 13:46:26 2015 UTC,"Where's the controversy? Grounded with downward pressure. Nothing controversial about it, but a good try."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,munkifisht,12,Sat Jul 4 18:22:53 2015 UTC,He is still applying pressure when the ball rolls off the leg and hits the ground.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,jart1987,10,Sat Jul 4 13:42:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, there is no need to apply pressure. He just needs to be in control of the ball when it touches the ground. You only need downward pressure when the ball's already on the ground and not in your control."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,ConspicuousPineapple,-1,Sat Jul 4 14:52:56 2015 UTC,"Doesn't roll off. Spins a complete revolution in the air. Never changes direction off the leg, just spins at a height that it could have never reached ground.  I believe it's so close that it might touch grass blades and is therefore a legit try, but it definitely doesn't hit anything solid."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,phro,11,Sun Jul 5 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"An awesome try with downward pressure, no need for control and no controversy unless you're a Hurricane fan."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,saviouroftheweak,-1,Sat Jul 4 14:20:51 2015 UTC,If he had no control and it touches an opposition player then that would make it a knock on. Control is important here not downward pressure.   Seems a fairly controversial decision given the comments (by non-canes fans) ITT and the context.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,saviouroftheweak,7,Sat Jul 4 16:02:35 2015 UTC,"He had control of it the whole time it was in contact with Milner's leg so wasn't a knock on. He then had downward pressure, in goal, making it a clear cut try and the correct decision."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,saviouroftheweak,-4,Sat Jul 4 16:08:02 2015 UTC,It definitely looks like a try from that angle but from the other there's a clear separation between the ball and the ground.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,flyingflibertyjibbet,12,Sat Jul 4 16:27:29 2015 UTC,One frame further on and the ball is on the floor with his hand still on it The fact we are having this talk takes away from what was an awesome moment of rugby but I honestly understand where you're coming from.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,phro,-4,Sat Jul 4 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"I couldn't conclusively say that's on the ground (here's a pic where it 100% is) and the ball doesn't react in a way as if it had touched the ground, it arguably touches a few blades of grass though.  I think I watch too much league (where it would have been no try)."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,saviouroftheweak,5,Sat Jul 4 17:25:29 2015 UTC,In league it's even more likely to be a try as they would've given benefit of the doubt.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,phro,-1,Sat Jul 4 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"That's not how league does it any more, it would have come down to whether the on field ref called a try or no try before sending it up."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,saviouroftheweak,0,Sat Jul 4 23:10:11 2015 UTC,Don't think so. The ball rotates on an axis in the air from the view behind the try zone. The tip spins under itself unimpeded and does not touch grass.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,MajorLeeScrewed,2,Sun Jul 5 16:58:58 2015 UTC,Unimpeded is optimistic considering wet grass
rugbyunion,3c3o01,fungiblecog,0,Sun Jul 5 17:03:18 2015 UTC,Well you can clearly see it grounded on leg and then it completes a full spin in the air. Never goes lower until after he's clearly lost control.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,HisHaskness,2,Sun Jul 5 17:07:37 2015 UTC,Yet 5 points given oh the humanity
rugbyunion,3c3o01,chantlernz,5,Sun Jul 5 17:16:05 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say clear.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,ptashark,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:35:47 2015 UTC,Nowhere in the rules does it say anything about 'control'. This is one of those things that's been repeated by commentators so often everybody thinks it's true.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,J0nShannow,6,Sat Jul 4 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"True, but it says holding which you can interpret as the same thing.   22.1a Player touches the ground with the ball. A player grounds the ball by holding the ball and touching the ground with it, in in-goal. ‘Holding’ means holding in the hand or hands, or in the arm or arms. No downward pressure is required."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,threalseymourskinner,-3,Sat Jul 4 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"Rubbish. Holding just means the ball is in the hand of the player, nothing to do with control."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,kiwirish,8,Sat Jul 4 20:56:24 2015 UTC,That's a try
rugbyunion,3c3o01,assorti,5,Sat Jul 4 17:12:42 2015 UTC,The fact this video runs at about 2 fps doesn't help the 'controversy'
rugbyunion,3c3o01,phro,5,Sat Jul 4 19:56:14 2015 UTC,Nothing controversial about it. A clear and impressive try.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,4Tenacious_Dee4,4,Sat Jul 4 22:54:19 2015 UTC,As much as I wish tries like this didn't count because they're very borderline.  It's a try by the current definitions of downward pressure.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,2,Sun Jul 5 00:16:33 2015 UTC,IMO when it's 50/50 then the benefit of the doubt really has to go to the attacking team.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,squatdog_nz,2,Sun Jul 5 10:10:30 2015 UTC,All the pressure is on the guy's leg. Watch the ball spin on it's axis in the air at the same exact height as he loses control. The tip of the ball spins under itself unimpeded at the height it was supposedly grounded at.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,macababy,4,Sun Jul 5 17:00:44 2015 UTC,"I probably wouldn't have given it myself, but I wont say it was a howler."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,RugbyAndBeer,14,Sat Jul 4 13:53:03 2015 UTC,You couldn't pay me to be the one who had to make that call.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,HisHaskness,2,Sat Jul 4 14:36:42 2015 UTC,It was a try.  Dixon didn't have the best perspective from under a four-man dogpile and wasn't sure he had forced it.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,AcePlague,3,Sun Jul 5 01:15:59 2015 UTC,"As a neutral, I'd say it's a brilliant defensive play with the boot, and no try. He loses possesion when he slams it into his boot, and it goes forward, not back, before he touches it down.     But it's close enough that you can't fault the ref either way."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,macababy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:30:40 2015 UTC,"Then it's a kick from the other player, he recovered, and tapped it downwards."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,RugbyAndBeer,7,Sat Jul 4 16:48:46 2015 UTC,"If it's a deliberate play to kick the ball out of the hands then it's a penalty try   20.4 e) Tackled near the goal line. If a player is tackled near to the opponents’ goal line so that this player can immediately reach out and ground the ball on or over the goal line, a try is scored.  (f) In this situation, defending players who are on their feet may legally prevent the try by pulling the ball from the tackled player’s hands or arms, but must not kick the ball.   If the boot just happens to be there then it is good defensive play."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,macababy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:54:30 2015 UTC,This needs a lot of attention
rugbyunion,3c3o01,Connor_mcb,7,Sun Jul 5 14:03:18 2015 UTC,"That's, not how the rules work."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,dr_chim_richaldz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"Isn't it, though? If he applies downward pressure onto the boot, it wasn't a knock. So if it's off the boot, it would be a kick, right? The rulebook defines a kick as when a foot moves the ball a visible distance. And if we're saying it goes anywhere, as you say it went forward from the carrier's perspective, then it moved a visible distance, and is therefore a kick."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,grubbr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:38:57 2015 UTC,"He has to be dispossessed before the kick can occur. And as soon as he loses that possesion forward, it's a knock then it's a kick by the other player, but a backwards kick is no different than any other backwards bumbling of the ball."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,ugomonyespacecraft,2,Sat Jul 4 21:55:57 2015 UTC,From England so I'm neutral the ball was placed on yellows foot than came backwards off yellows for no try
rugbyunion,3c3o01,profbucko,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:40:01 2015 UTC,I was neutral on this game too. I wouldn't have given it. Hurricanes did themselves no favours to get back into it though.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,WookieeSolo,2,Mon Jul 6 08:28:38 2015 UTC,"In realtime it looks like a try for all money, however Dixon's immediate reaction (mouthing the F word a few times) suggests he knows deep down he didn't score. Either way, a clutch play deserving of a match-winner."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,FinchyNZ,2,Sat Jul 4 21:18:05 2015 UTC,Don't think that was a try.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,warpal,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:27:53 2015 UTC,What's that celebration at the end?
rugbyunion,3c3o01,TruFalcon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:51:25 2015 UTC,"Sure, it was controversial but give the man props he literally carried 3 + men over the line and manages to scrape some grass on the way down. I wouldn't say it was a clear try but after some tmo it became clear enough that he scored."
rugbyunion,3c3o01,jordyGW,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:50:59 2015 UTC,It wasn't a try. Even the bloke that scored thought it wasn't a try. Unless that was his celebration face for scoring a try in the final. Good poker player if so.
rugbyunion,3c3o01,Athrul,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:41:15 2015 UTC,No try... even Dixon knows it wasn't.

rugbyunion,3c24o6,Synjin,35,Sat Jul 4 08:01:43 2015 UTC,"--Yarns of debatable quality incoming, just cleaning up the last of the Speights---  What a game. NZ rugby is as healthy as ever, whether the old guard of rural nz talkback listeners and Herald writers believe it or not. Where else could you see a contest like that in the world?  You guys have to try and understand. I got my first of five Highlanders jersey in 1998. I wanted so badly to be a Highlander as I was coming up, as did most of my peers. As a young fella my mates and I would go to every single local match for years on end (and it is fucking cold down here) with little to smile about afterwards.  Over time the Highlanders descended into mediocrity,  with minimal All Black selection, player talent drying up and stale coaching all leading to less and less interest from crowds -and not to mention the rest of the country.  The resurgence in recent years - better coaching, less restrictive styles of play (to put it short letting brown boys do their thing as well as the hardass southern men archetypes) has turned them into such an exciting and entertaining team to watch, it really is a story 20 years in the making.   I won't say I've been the staunchest or most diligent supporter over the past few years, but man, what a feeling. I feel 9 again."

I think this is the best I've felt for a team I have supported (in it's various amateur and professional guises) for nearly 3 decades. Those forwards have been magnificent.

He had our forwards fired up, savage at the breakdown and playing at their best. Add in a good set piece coach and you're laughing.

It seems like they know if they underestimate them, the Aussies will get up and grab it. A side note....I cannot believe Will Genia is being allowed to leave Australia. Before we had Aaron Smith, Genia was a player I would've loved seeing play for the ABs. Good luck with the Reds next year mate."
rugbyunion,3c24o6,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,6,Sat Jul 4 10:57:06 2015 UTC,"It's nice that we are guaranteed a new first-time Super Rugby winner.  In the downside, whoever loses will be the only NZ team never to win the competition.  They both play great fast rugby, I just hope we have a good game."
rugbyunion,3c24o6,sennais1,7,Sat Jul 4 07:05:32 2015 UTC,Neither are the Reds but to spite my North Island co-workers I'm hoping the Highlanders get the trophy to take home to their frozen tundra where it will stay fresh.

rugbyunion,3c24o6,warbastard,11,Sat Jul 4 09:33:47 2015 UTC,That first 20 minutes was amazing. I and every other rugby nation on Earth are shutting our pants after watching that. If that is what NZ teams are capable of in a final that is fucking scary.   As a Queenslander I am fucking pumped for the Highlanders. I feel that Otago and Queensland are very similar in mentality (both the yokels/hicks of their countries). Very happy to see them win the final.
rugbyunion,3c24o6,small_far_away,5,Sat Jul 4 10:16:54 2015 UTC,Nonu destroyed that guy. Jesus.

rugbyunion,3c24o6,bobwinters,6,Sat Jul 4 09:07:37 2015 UTC,It's a shame that only one team could go away with the win. Highlanders played so well in the finals while the Hurricanes were the best all season. Both deserved the trophy.

rugbyunion,3c24o6,BelleOfTeBalls,5,Sat Jul 4 08:26:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, well done Highlanders.   But am I the only one who noticed the really high tackle on Marshall (by I think Osbourne). So instead of a lineout for Highlanders it should have been a Canes pen?"

I'll give him the try-saver, but he threw away his chance, and really was otherwise silent today. Otherwise the Hurricanes' handling of the breakdown made it really difficult for them to make any serious damage. For two free-flowing teams, the Highlanders really executed everything well."

rugbyunion,3c24o6,PetevonPete,5,Sat Jul 4 08:22:45 2015 UTC,Congrats the Highlanders. Long time coming for you. We will have to rebuild now and get a chance soon. Was an all time classic game and I called Banks winning it for them.
rugbyunion,3c24o6,ruck_it3,4,Sat Jul 4 09:23:49 2015 UTC,3:35 kickoff here in the east of the USA. Time to party right into the 4th of July with some rugby!

My significant other's original province of residence has allowed me to take some stake from this non-Australian final.  But seriously. Dang - the Highlanders really played so well I was blown away. Such a well coached side it makes me weak in the knees...
rugbyunion,3c3esy,cubeyescube,8,Sat Jul 4 12:38:14 2015 UTC,What a fucking game
rugbyunion,3c3esy,Foveaux,9,Sat Jul 4 12:43:06 2015 UTC,"Aaron Smith was unbelievable for the Highlanders along with all of his forwards, I thought for a while when the Hurricanes had that 15 minute spell of domination they would turn it around but Savea bombing that try was the turning point.  I honestly think Smith is the best 9 I have seen in my lifetime, such a natural passer and seems to just glide through games.  A fantastic finale to the competition all up."
rugbyunion,3c3esy,ron_manager,8,Sat Jul 4 14:18:42 2015 UTC,That game was the rugby equivalent of those guys in Mad Max who were sitting on the hoods of the cars and spitting gas into the air intake to make everything go faster.

rugbyunion,3c3esy,snomanDS,4,Sat Jul 4 14:47:49 2015 UTC,"That was an amazing game to watch. The defence on both sides were immense considering the attacking. The fact that no tries had been scored in the first 30 minutes despite the end to end play showed it. From the get go the Highlanders looked the better team and the Hurricanes then succumbed to the pressure they were constantly put under, and then some really careless mistakes at crucial moments kept them behind the 8 ball. At this point I don't know if I want Hurricanes players playing in the rwc final (if we make it), Piri almost lost us the game in 2011 wellingtonians just can't handle the pressure."

rugbyunion,3c3esy,ycnz,4,Sat Jul 4 12:07:49 2015 UTC,Barrett played well under pressure? Did you miss the first half?
rugbyunion,3c3esy,saviouroftheweak,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:24:02 2015 UTC,He was under far more pressure second half and was running lines and kicking goals if anything it showed he could recover. Also he threw 3 awesome wide passes and as a 10 I love his playing style.
rugbyunion,3c3esy,ycnz,2,Sat Jul 4 20:26:41 2015 UTC,We lost by 7. What was his kicking percentage?
rugbyunion,3c3esy,saviouroftheweak,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:34:40 2015 UTC,Not good enough obviously but you wouldn't have scored what you did without him. You would have turned the tide had Savea caught the ball and you can't blame Barrett for the loss. I don't like the notion that you miss some kicks and therefore you had a shit game.
rugbyunion,3c3esy,chantlernz,2,Sat Jul 4 20:48:21 2015 UTC,"Like it or not, in a final that notion will always be correct. Big games will always be largely dependant upon kicks, and Beaudy missed far too many."
rugbyunion,3c3esy,saviouroftheweak,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:04:00 2015 UTC,"It's a weird comparison but Jonny missed a couple of kicks in that 2003 final against Australia and Ben Kay dropped the ball in front of the line, it just turns out he got the one that mattered. I agree he should make those kicks but it's crazy to think he might not miss a few."
rugbyunion,3c3esy,ycnz,2,Sat Jul 4 21:26:24 2015 UTC,"His distribution is very good, but his goalkicking is average at best.  And I definitely wouldn't place blame solely on Barrett - we had a shit game across the board."
rugbyunion,3c3esy,saviouroftheweak,2,Sat Jul 4 21:35:12 2015 UTC,I agree with that
rugbyunion,3c3esy,lagbort,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:36:09 2015 UTC,"I still find our obsession in nz with the number 10 having to be the goal kicker very strange. Other teams / countries have no problems with the goal kicker being a wing, fullback, no. 9 etc. But a 10 in nz who isn't the outright best goal kicker on the park is somehow deeply flawed, even if you have others who are good/ better kickers in the park (as the hurricanes did last night)."
rugbyunion,3c3esy,ycnz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:52:28 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming part of it is trying to line him up for All Blacks selection as their kicker as well. With luck, that won't be happening..."
rugbyunion,3c3esy,kiwirish,2,Sun Jul 5 06:40:37 2015 UTC,So we deleted a perfectly good and established thread because a few whiny people went online knowing there would be spoilers?  What a crock of shit.
rugbyunion,3c3esy,threalseymourskinner,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:20:07 2015 UTC,"Whilst much of the scoring came from conversions etc, the quality of play and the attitudes of the team was just phenomenal. Lots of end to end action and a real testament to what rugby is all about. A worthy final (although, for me, a disappointing result).  Next year is definitely our year."
rugbyunion,3c3esy,TruFalcon,-11,Sat Jul 4 22:58:21 2015 UTC,7 point game and a horrendous decision which gifted the Highlanders 7 points at halftime makes this outcome a joke IMO
rugbyunion,3c3esy,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,16,Sat Jul 4 12:48:12 2015 UTC,Not Savea dropping that ball cold or Barrett missing a dozen kicks?  k.
rugbyunion,3c3esy,oconnomiyaki,2,Sat Jul 4 12:56:30 2015 UTC,Not to mention tying to offload on every tackle and constantly giving it away.
rugbyunion,3c3esy,TruFalcon,-5,Sat Jul 4 18:08:29 2015 UTC,Neither of those would have mattered if the video ref could have made the correct call from one of the dozen replays. The Hurricanes shouldn't have to overcome the officiating as well as the Highlanders
rugbyunion,3c3esy,saviouroftheweak,7,Sat Jul 4 13:12:11 2015 UTC,Dropping the ball over the line and missing kicks means that they didn't play well enough to win. Regardless of officiating Canes couldn't finish it off today
rugbyunion,3c3esy,TruFalcon,-6,Sat Jul 4 13:37:11 2015 UTC,Highlanders didn't play well enough to win either then but they still gave them a trophy
rugbyunion,3c3esy,saviouroftheweak,9,Sat Jul 4 13:40:24 2015 UTC,Kicked their chances and scored their tries worth every point of their win.
rugbyunion,3c3esy,poolnallinnit,3,Sat Jul 4 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"that appears to be a very bitter response. Otago fully deserved the win, clearly the better team on the day."
rugbyunion,3c3esy,deadlysyntax,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:12:20 2015 UTC,"Dry your eyes mate. That was a fucking great try. Downward pressure while the ball was touching grass. 4 Canes unable to stop one man. ""Highlanders didn't play well enough to win"", don't walk away from this game bitter, or looking for a scapegoat, it was a truly great game of rugby and the Highlanders earned their win."
rugbyunion,3c3esy,fernta,2,Sat Jul 4 14:53:04 2015 UTC,"You can't pinpoint moments throughout the match where maybes and shouldn'ts happened because the same could have been said for either said. Hurricanes played worse on the day, and the Highlanders deserved to win. From one angle it looked like a definite try in my book, even if it was for a split second."
rugbyunion,3c3esy,KiwiMaoriJapan,2,Sat Jul 4 14:09:57 2015 UTC,Pretty sure TruFalcon is just a troll.  2 teams played out of their skin and the underdog conquered.   I think all rugby fans can appreciate that game no matter what side you are on.

rugbyunion,3c3i3j,cubeyescube,3,Sun Jul 5 01:33:26 2015 UTC,"Probably - the whole team up-and-down from Fox Sports are amateurish, out of ideas (latching onto others) and damaging to the sport. But seriously, it's no good. We're talking about the popularity of a whole sport - at present it is all dependent on these guys. I think the ARU forget this."
rugbyunion,3c3i3j,plato44,3,Sat Jul 4 12:47:35 2015 UTC,"Bloody Phil Kearns irritates me especially, especially during last week's festivities."
rugbyunion,3c3i3j,Supertrinko,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:58:34 2015 UTC,True. They are cringe worthy.
rugbyunion,3c3e3q,dom65659,3,Sat Jul 4 11:09:19 2015 UTC,I'd support the idea. Only problem would be funding not sure how that would logistically make sense
rugbyunion,3c3e3q,Chinpoko_Master,5,Sat Jul 4 14:45:36 2015 UTC,"I remember it was touted a few months ago that London Welsh and London Scottish could join the league if the Italians pull out, which is a possibility as far as I know due to the non payment of fees. Would be interesting, but I think its a couple of years away yet."
rugbyunion,3c3e3q,themelancholysloth,5,Sat Jul 4 15:34:39 2015 UTC,"It makes loads of sense to the teams. No relegation is enough by itself but I have no idea why the Pro 12 would want to do it. If they eject the Italians then they are just exchanging sub par teams for sub par teams. Also, now the Italians are paid up with the other teams they don't have any reason to kick out the Italians. If they decide to add the two teams without kicking anyone out they are just adding mediocrity for no clear reason.   The only up side I could see would be that the increased stability would allow meaningful investment in the clubs allowing them to potentially improve over a period to a high enough standard to be meaningful to the league but its a big if.   Plus there is the whole problem of treading on the RFU and Premiership's toes which I can't see going well for anyone."
rugbyunion,3c3e3q,J0nShannow,2,Sat Jul 4 19:10:00 2015 UTC,"I think they'd be hockeyed once again, they were very close to conceding 50 points a game in the aviva and some of the Pro 12 A sides were able to hold them off last time they played in the B&I cup so I can't see them being competitive.   They need to find their level first in the Championship and not make wholesale personnel changes like they did at the start of their disastrous 14/15 season."
rugbyunion,3c3e3q,yimrsg,6,Sat Jul 4 17:53:55 2015 UTC,"Makes perfect sense for them. There's no relegation so they can get those juicy travelling Irish numbers every year, they play in a league with some prestige every year, which also features a few teams they might have a resonable shot of beating, and they'll always have a route to Champion's Cup rugby open at the top of the table to work towards."
rugbyunion,3c3e3q,COfadaM,-1,Sat Jul 4 11:55:11 2015 UTC,Hope they do it. Won't have to deal with the RFU who tried to make things difficult for them
rugbyunion,3c3ccf,coldlymph,6,Sat Jul 4 10:39:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah to beat those teams 3 weeks in a row is an awesome effort. They deserve to be champions. Feel sorry for the Canes though, such a good season but couldn't win the one that mattered."
rugbyunion,3c3ccf,flendors,3,Sat Jul 4 11:49:17 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's easy to say this now, but the losses they did have in the season kind of foreshadowed them not winning the title. A well organised game plan and strong defensive effort has succeeded in disrupting their tempo a couple of times this year. The set piece didn't always look like that of a champion side, either."
rugbyunion,3c3ccf,Aquapig,2,Sat Jul 4 21:06:23 2015 UTC,Probably. Plus the only team to win going in outside the top 2

Is it likely they would be awarded two large events in a two year period?  France already hosted a RWC in recent memory, but it's probably the 'safest' bet (large capacity, UTC+1/Europe, accessible). Honestly, I see it mostly as Ireland vs Italy. The IRFU already claims to have 40% of backing for 2023 (Source)  If that is to be believed, then unless there's a seismic shift to Italy, it looks quite likely that Ireland could end up hosting the event.

Debts of £12m repaid. £7m profit. *Fee of £55m paid to the IRB ***Fee of £80m paid to WR    Both are the revenue netted to the Union of the host country. The Lions tour is not another tour, it's the Lions tour - and I see the revenue from that potentially increasing in future tours too. Ontop of that add in the fact that more Home Nations fans will travel to the host nation, the knock on economic effects are also larger than any tour.   I would be surprised if a SH team hosted the RWC (breaking with what appears to be an informal tradition of swapping hemispheres every four years - or rather, returning to Europe for a 'safe' and accessible RWC. [Edit: Average & depending on what year (due to amount of countries participating) total attendance numbers of European RWCs are higher]) and if I'll be honest, I would be shocked if they would award two prestigious money making tournaments/tours to one country with a two year period.  Phone Edit: also there is a misunderstanding that 2021 is already decided upon, far from it. I said the lions tour is still speculative, the current agreement runs out in 2017. While they want to potentially expand it to new countries in the new agreement I can see the need for a 'safe start' in 2021,  while that would be RSA, anyone's guess is as good as mine. RSA as the front runner but not guaranteed makes sense, if the union wants the RWC then move the lions tour elsewhere (Argentina, USA & Canada, whatever their new agreement looks like)"

There was a big fancy dinner to be had though and the school turned a blind eye to the kids having a few beers so that was incentive enough to go along.  I wasn't a big rugby fan at that point either, didn't watch sports as a kid. So whilst I knew the guy handing out the prizes was a good international player I wasn't really sure who it was.  Nowadays I look back in ground swallowing embarrassment as I remember the moment when Francois Pienaar handed me possibly the worst prize in rugby. Two years earlier he was lifting the Webb Ellis Cup as presented to him by Nelson Mandella, and now he was giving some skinny 13 year old with a bowl cut a third team ""best and fairest"" shield."

Played in a mixed touch football comp against luke morahan and the hurdler sally pearson. Ran into morgan turinui once at the cinemas and jerome kano walking shirtless at surfers paradise.

It would, in the long run, do more damage to the South Sea Islands than good."
rugbyunion,3bzshd,reggie_007,3,Fri Jul 3 14:19:20 2015 UTC,"I'm all for this with a couple emphases, you have to have blood ties to a second nation AND you can step down a tier but not up or across.   Chris Masoe can play for Samoa, but not France etc.  People are harping on about protecting the integrity of international rugby, but countries are already taking the piss with eligibility laws. We have guys like Michael Bent, Brendon Laney, Gareth Anscombe Thomas Waldrom etc flying into a country for the very first time and pulling on the national colours a week later. We've got guys like Jared Payne, Samuela Vunisa, Rory Kockett etc with no real ties to a country representing them at test level on residency.  This proposed rule won't harm the integrity of the game any more than the existing ones do. The only difference here is that the old guard is benefiting under the current situation and the next tier down would benefit from this rule change. You can't have your cake and eat it too, either tighten everything up, or allow the lower teams to benefit as well"
rugbyunion,3bzshd,wn_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:09:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. For all the talk about poaching from the islands, this seems like a good way to give back in a very meaningful way."
rugbyunion,3bzshd,cape7,4,Sat Jul 4 11:18:03 2015 UTC,"To be honest I can see this leaving tier 2 nations MORE susceptible to poaching.   ""Oh come and play for us in your mid twenties and we'll let you run out for Samoa when you're old and knackered""."
rugbyunion,3bzshd,wn_,4,Fri Jul 3 18:42:06 2015 UTC,"The cases were a guy is good enough to make the All Blacks but chooses Samoa instead are very, very rare. This would make the tier 2 nations stronger, without a doubt."

rugbyunion,3bzshd,squatdog_nz,2,Sat Jul 4 18:28:17 2015 UTC,It's a good idea for players who say pick to play for the All Blacks... Get 10ish caps and then get replaced by another player. They might not be All Black level anymore but they would certainly still do a job for Samoa.

rugbyunion,3bzshd,cape7,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:18:34 2015 UTC,"I fully understand having two allegiances but I maintain that committing to one at senior level should be a definitive choice. It's a tough one to take individually but I imagine the extra mess it'll create, especially for the Pacific Island countries that have a many double nationality players. They'll have players, like Nanai-Williams who would be glad to play for either and start playing for Samoa because the All Blacks are full. Then he'd make the All Blacks and screw Samoa over since they were already counting on him."
rugbyunion,3bzshd,Eisr16,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:57:02 2015 UTC,"This change has been proposed in the past with the specification that players can step down from a tier 1 to a tier 2 nation but not the other way around. That is the kind of rule i would want in place.   The eligibility rules as they are aren't exactly perfect, and they are heavily skewed towards the big tier one teams who have their own lucrative professional competitions. Right now a lot of teams are strengthening their teams with residency players, Samoa can't do that because they have no professional league so can't attract anyone into the country to generate any residency players. On the contrary, they end up losing quality players like Bundee Aki and Uini Atonio."
rugbyunion,3bzshd,ycnz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:15:51 2015 UTC,I see the reasoning but no.   We should do everything to avoid having a situation in anyway similar to the farce that is international cricket.

rugbyunion,3bzmaw,Dan148,2,Fri Jul 3 18:07:12 2015 UTC,"it's quite big, especially at uni and schools level. The varsity match between Waseda and Keio got 20000 people a couple of years ago. Sorry, the source is in Japanese. Maybe the big reason why our national team isn't so good is because some of these players are already burnt out from the extreme practice that they have had to do until that point.  Wiki has a pretty good page on it"
rugbyunion,3bxo5q,sandollars,8,Fri Jul 3 00:29:34 2015 UTC,Why would they shrink the venue from 12k to 8k seats? I'd think Samoa could easily fill a bigger stadium. Also any idea of if/how this will be broadcast in the US? Would love to catch it live.

You would have gotten more then 8000 Samoan fans in and they could have made some actual money to share.   I feel it legitimises the Samoan rugby administration and I totally disagree with any action that does that.
rugbyunion,3bxo5q,tbld,2,Fri Jul 3 06:40:31 2015 UTC,"But playing the game in Samoa helps Samoan people more, selling merchs, food and drink etc."
rugbyunion,3bxo5q,shizzelez,3,Fri Jul 3 14:00:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure I understand sorry. Are you saying the extra money they get from selling food goes to the Samoan rugby union?   Do you really think that would be more then half the gate at a 50,000 seater?"
rugbyunion,3bxo5q,tbld,3,Fri Jul 3 14:11:01 2015 UTC,No the people living there. Not saying the money will go to SRU but to people who own shops etc.
rugbyunion,3bxo5q,shizzelez,2,Fri Jul 3 14:13:41 2015 UTC,I think you are massively mistaken in the number of people who will travel to Samoa for a 1 off midweek game. The idea was to bring the game to the people. But at the ticket prices and with only 8k seats that's now not happening either.  The idea was not to provide major economic boost to a country.

rugbyunion,3c014n,Eisr16,3,Fri Jul 3 20:18:48 2015 UTC,The main issue that I can see before you even look at the sustainability of it would be - what union would they fall under ? If I'm not mistaken the RFU would need to give the green light ? I can't see the English clubs being agreeable to a foreign league moving in on their commercial market and they'd be dead right not to.
rugbyunion,3c014n,Eisr16,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:20:04 2015 UTC,"The RFU would definitely have to agree, and the commercial side is not even something I had thought of, but hey getting other perspectives was why I posted it. The other side of it is would the pro12 teams want them? I mean all it would do is change which two teams are anchored to the bottom of the table."
rugbyunion,3c014n,faintsausage,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:34:35 2015 UTC,"Yea , I don't think the Pro12 teams would be jumping at the prospect either. The main winners would be London Welsh/Scottish and I don't think its a good idea to bring them in over the Italian teams. A weaker Italy isn't good for European rugby."
rugbyunion,3c014n,some_sort_of_monkey,2,Fri Jul 3 22:48:15 2015 UTC,"London-based teams   London Welsh    lol.   Seriously though, you're welcome to them. Welsh are all kinds of terrible and Scottish aren't even in the premiership; English rugby would lose nothing of value."
rugbyunion,3c014n,faintsausage,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:26:13 2015 UTC,Welsh are moving back to London. I know a lot (in fact probably all) of Scottish rugby fans feel we need at least a 3rd pro team and using (the improving) London Scottish is seen by many as easier than starting from scratch. From what I have heard Scottish don't want to be promoted to the Premiership for a couple of years yet so I am not sure weather they would want this.
rugbyunion,3c014n,RedNave,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:31:51 2015 UTC,"Scottish are in no danger of being promoted any time soon; they came 8th this year Worcester and Bristol are miles ahead of them.   Edit: Also, less than half their squad is Scottish, you'd have to basically scrap the current setup to integrate them as a new Scottish team."

rugbyunion,3c014n,MichaelHeneghan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:45:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah but considering they have gone 9th, 8th, 5th, 3rd in their four seasons and only went pro 3 years ago they are on the up pretty fast but from what I have heard they won't accept promotion if they win for ~5 years (unless they feel that the prem is about to be imminently ring fenced)."

rugbyunion,3c014n,sionnach,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:23:32 2015 UTC,I agree but if this was on offer (which I don't think it is from Scottish anyway) I think the SRU should seriously consider it.
rugbyunion,3c014n,some_sort_of_monkey,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:42:02 2015 UTC,"I can't see the sensibility of this. The teams will not be good quality. Who will support them? I live in London, but am Leinster born, bred and buttered. I'd go to the game when Leinster come to the big smoke (though I doubt they'll be able to get a stadium vaguely in London proper). I think that's the only commercial avenue - away supporters living in London coming to matches. Not a great starting point.   I'd prefer to see the AP and Pro12 merge into two divisions. Not saying I'd want that, but it would be better than adding shit English teams to the Pro12."
rugbyunion,3c014n,redstarduggan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:46:31 2015 UTC,I know a lot of London based Scots who would probably be more likely to go to pro 12 games than the Championship and while I would probably support Edinburgh when they came to town I would support Scottish when they played anyone else.

A few players probably could make it into the NPC here but it'd be hard and it'd be off the bench like them first.

He is battling for a starting spot, and would probably only start a few matches next year. He is too good for that.  Haven't seen much of Peter Grant recently, but he must be a step up from Ebersohn.  Maybe next year the back line at the Force will actually be able to do something, with (9) Matthewson, (10) Grant, (11) Cummins, (12) Godwin, (13) Tapuai, (14) Morahan, (15) Haylett-Petty. That's a pretty solid back-line. Hopefully Foley will actually allow the back line to play with ball in hand once in a while."

For a Tier 1 nation, yes the 15s national side has a lot more prestige than 7s, but thats not really the case yet for 7s in the US. Keep in mind that 4 of the 7s starters are likely to make the the WC squad (and Hughes probably could have as well...). With the Olympics and the fact that the US is actually doing pretty well at 7s; it could easily be a situation where 5 years from now, more Americans know the the 7s players than overseas professionals playing 15s (Manoa, Scully, Wyles, etc). I'll preemptively apologize for the US to the international rugby community. I'm sorry you all will feel compelled to complain about how we are ruining the integrity of the game, or whatever.

Impossible to tackle even before you take into account the whole fire breathing, winged demon thing.  Tywin. He's a master tactician and after watching Ireland's improvement under a master I would like some of that action.  Dothraki. Strong, well conditioned and can be lead successfully.

If you actually wanted to get in shape: Brienne. If you wanted to have a good time: Bronn. Get a big hit on Joffrey, get Ramsay at the bottom of a ruck. Targaryens = Wales (dragons), Lannisters = England ($$$, think they're more powerful than they actually are), Scotland = Baratheons (look good on paper but Stannis and Renly are already out of the running), Boltons = France (looks like they're not doing much until they slit your throat), Tyrells = Italy (come from a very nice part of the continent, their power is always underestimated), Starks = Ireland (something something honor, POC, etc.). White Walkers could probably hold a solid defensive line, dragons would have trouble grasping the concept of offsides. Tywin seems more adaptable. If Stannisball isn't working, there'd be no Plan B. If the Dothraki have a reliable kicker, I'd go for them. Wildlings would be too indisciplined. Ned Stark would be better. Daenerys would make a bad call against your team, then yellow card a player on the other team to try to make up for it, then have a player on your team executed to make up for the yellow card."

rugbyunion,3bvcv4,RedNave,3,Thu Jul 2 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"He does seem to be displaying difficulties at understanding what a contract is.  If he does stay we better tell Scarlets we are getting DTH back, because violating contracts seems to be allowed now."
rugbyunion,3bvcv4,RedNave,3,Thu Jul 2 14:10:48 2015 UTC,"Just seen this article too. A bit worrying  'Speaking about getting out of his deal with Glasgow, Naiyaravoro said: “I’ll probably still have to sort that out, there is still a lot to sort out with that, for now getting the selection is an indicator of me trying to settle in and try to chase the residency again. I’ll probably settle here first, and look to overseas afterwards.”'"
rugbyunion,3bvcv4,hazza1205,5,Thu Jul 2 14:39:30 2015 UTC,"I saw that, the club seem to be pretty clear that a contract is in place.  If some of the rumours are true that DTH and Maitland were allowed to leave to free up funds for this move, if we're not getting him I hope the club and the SRU rain ungodly hell down on him and the ARU, I wonder if they have the funds to fight a legal battle."
rugbyunion,3bvcv4,FrenchyFungus,6,Thu Jul 2 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"What Tahs fans had been hearing was that there seemed to be a get-out clause in the contract which stated that if he was to be capped by an international team this year (Aus or Fiji) he would be able to back out of the contract.  So while he may not deserve a Wallabies cap atm (he doesnt), he might get picked lest we let him go and he turns into another Nadolo.  Wish I had a source for this though."

rugbyunion,3bvcv4,RedNave,3,Thu Jul 2 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"He has signed a contract, and one which has been confirmed to contain no such provision that if he was selected for Australia he could renege on it.  He is now looking at ways to cancel his contract.  He's also spent the last year going back and fourth between playing for Fiji and playing for Australia, betting each against each other for the best deal.  That does signal someone of low integrity."
rugbyunion,3bvcv4,TheMeanderer,2,Fri Jul 3 08:14:51 2015 UTC,I get why people are downvoting and if he really is doing it for his family then fair enough - but if he reneages on his contract it just isn't his life he's affecting.

rugbyunion,3bvkbu,fernta,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:17:01 2015 UTC,"So much hype surrounding Nehe Milner-Skudder this season, but I don't see much attention directed at Damian McKenzie. He's had a superb Super Rugby season for the Chiefs, one of their standout players even though he was benched for much of the season.  He plays 10 and 15 just like Barrett, and his decision making/execution is really sharp.  All Black potential."
rugbyunion,3bvkbu,deadlysyntax,6,Thu Jul 2 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"He's fantastic, I agree. Huge talent, still think he's a bit young but definitely in the mix in the future. NZ has huge outside back sources historically, but man, even then a bad time to be in the mix.  Milner-Skudder is a bit more flashy and exciting, which would contribute to being standing out more by the public and even to selectors, but they're certainly not unaware of McKenzie, he's fucking talented."
rugbyunion,3bvkbu,fernta,3,Thu Jul 2 14:47:07 2015 UTC,McKenzie will be there next year if he keeps it up. I think Rennie mentioned he preferred Marty ahead of Damian at 10 because of his maturity in implementing the game plan. Damian is immense raw talent and he's fearless and another season should see him mature. There will be more room next year too with Barrett looking at Rio and Carter and Slade heading offshore. ABs fullback and 10 is well looked after at the moment. Nehe also plays 14 which I suspect played it's part in his selection.
rugbyunion,3bvkbu,fettsack,2,Fri Jul 3 02:07:00 2015 UTC,"Cruden Barrett Sopoaga will be the pecking order next year. If Barrett does go to the olympics, likely he'll be the third, but there's so many outside backs I don't think he'll be cover for any of them, and I don't know if he warrants a 4th first five position in the ABs if Barrett stays. His flexibility will help him in the future. He's almost in a Colin Slade kind of position."
rugbyunion,3bvkbu,say-something-nice,0,Fri Jul 3 02:14:56 2015 UTC,"McKenzie made a tackle every 16 and a half minutes, Milner-Skudder every 42. I find this very very low!"
rugbyunion,3bvkbu,reddititis,6,Thu Jul 2 18:17:05 2015 UTC,"Mckenzie is tiny and played 10 a bit, every team is going to see him at 10 and send every ball carrier down his channel, thus loads of tackles  Fullbacks never make that many tackles, example: excluding the game against scotland (7 tackles) halfpenny had 5 tackles in the entire six nations, if your fullback is making alot of tackles, the rest of your team is probably being ripped to shreds in defense. Hurricanes were super dominant this year therefore low tackles by the fullback"

Although currently ranked below England, Wales, and Ireland, I don't think that's an accurate representation.

Shit set-piece to directionless captaincy to political infighting. Almost like an evolving virus. I doubt that the tears infused will help the all black's to a satisfactory degree.   Take the flu for example, a virus which constantly mutates resulting in multiple strains. Depending on conditions, one strain of the virus will be more likely to be dominate within a population than the other strains. Yes you can take a flu shot, but that will only target the expected dominate strain, not any of the others. This explains why you can have a shot but still get the flu.  If we continue to use the virus/wallaby line of thought then each strain may be viewed as a general facet of play. Our set piece may be the expected area of mediocrity this year, but what's to say that general play kicking might slip in there too. Will the all blacks be prepared for this?

rugbyunion,3bt95s,royal_oui,17,Thu Jul 2 06:25:15 2015 UTC,A little bit further down the page is an article from the same site about how the Highlanders are likely to be confused by flushing toilets when they come up to Wellington for the Super15 final. Neither article is a serious social commentary that can be used to psychoanalyze a country of 4 million people.

rugbyunion,3bt95s,mufflar,-4,Fri Jul 3 02:47:25 2015 UTC,That's a very Australian style article. Sounded like their cricket team wrote it. I'd much rather we worked hard and were humble in (potential) victory.
rugbyunion,3bt95s,Cemetary,18,Thu Jul 2 07:08:12 2015 UTC,Crap article slagging off Australia gets a crap comment slagging off Australia.  Nice work.
rugbyunion,3bt95s,royal_oui,-2,Thu Jul 2 07:20:50 2015 UTC,"There is a distinct difference between the Australian cricket team and Australia. Aussies have a little chip on their shoulder, the cricket team has a whole lumber mill."
rugbyunion,3bt95s,Cemetary,6,Thu Jul 2 08:07:37 2015 UTC,The aussie cricket team can be pretty full pf themselves regardless of the era. It was nice seeing the NZ-Eng series be very competitive but played in the right spirits.
rugbyunion,3bt95s,amplebooty,2,Thu Jul 2 10:05:06 2015 UTC,Yes indeed
rugbyunion,3bt95s,Cemetary,-4,Thu Jul 2 11:41:07 2015 UTC,"There is a distinct difference between the Australian cricket team and Australia. Aussies have a little chip on their shoulder, the cricket team has a whole lumber mill."
rugbyunion,3bt95s,Cemetary,9,Thu Jul 2 08:07:34 2015 UTC,and kiwis are such humble and self deprecating folk they purport to be. especially All Black supporters.

I'd also like to thank Mr Carter for helping to make sure that Sir Clive fucking Woodward never got a job coaching any rugby team ever again. A true public service from a great man, and a great player"
rugbyunion,3bumgf,Chuckles1188,3,Thu Jul 2 11:59:17 2015 UTC,Is he not seen in any positive light over there? Cuz 2003?
rugbyunion,3bumgf,ThaFuck,4,Thu Jul 2 14:06:51 2015 UTC,"In the general media, he's still seen as some kind of coaching genius. He played a fairly major role in the Olympic team's preparations for London 2012 which was a major success.  I think it's only non-English rugby fans that have a negative opinion because of how he fucked up the Lions. McGeechan and Gatland were far better Lions coaches."
rugbyunion,3bumgf,ox_,2,Thu Jul 2 16:00:59 2015 UTC,No he botched this Lions tour by selecting a hugely bloated squad so he had a midweek team and a test team.
rugbyunion,3bumgf,some_sort_of_monkey,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"Amongst the general public (if they know who he is) probably yes, but among most English rugby fans the  feeling is that the team won 2003 not particularly thanks to anything Woodward did."
rugbyunion,3bumgf,Chuckles1188,4,Fri Jul 3 08:46:50 2015 UTC,"I personally would call it the best, but I would like to hear what other people would have had their best.   It'll be interesting to see if there will be a performance like this when the Lions come to visit again in 2 Years time."
rugbyunion,3bumgf,kingkreep95,9,Thu Jul 2 07:50:33 2015 UTC,He's the greatest fly-half of all time in my book
rugbyunion,3bumgf,MiracleBalls10,2,Thu Jul 2 11:39:22 2015 UTC,"That performance really was something special and certainly the best that I can remember. He was unplayable that day. I don't think that it's possible to compare performances from different eras but just for fun of it, here are a couple of others that deserve honourable mentions:  My father's generation talk about Barry John for the British Lions in the victory against New Zealand in the first test in 1971. His tactical kicking completely destroyed Fergie McCormick. McCormick never pulled on an All Black jersey again. Of course, the game has changed so much that highlights of the match seem bizarre to today's audience.  As a boy, I remember being mesmerised by Mark Ella who revolutionised outside-half play on the Grand Slam tour of 1984. I spent ages looking at the way he took the ball close to the defensive line, drawing opposition players before releasing his runners and looping around to run good support lines off them. At the time, it seemed a completely new way to play the game. But this was over 4 games rather than one test."
rugbyunion,3bumgf,reddititis,-8,Thu Jul 2 23:06:23 2015 UTC,The indisputable fact that bod was taken out off the ball and two all blacks should have been sent off and banned.   Edit: Didn't read the rest of the article. Shame the paper can't focus on the skill of carter rather than dragging up such a shameful moment in all black history.
rugbyunion,3bumgf,reddititis,3,Thu Jul 2 10:14:59 2015 UTC,"Yea it is pretty shit that it has to be brought up, but it's what the NZ Media does, they have to bring up the negative topics when talking about a positive one."
rugbyunion,3bumgf,cape7,5,Thu Jul 2 10:34:25 2015 UTC,"Think its just that paper, they employ that crazy welsh? Nh journalist, it works though in all fairness.   Have to admit I like the fact that kiwi papers are critical of the team regardless of the result, it isnt nice but sets a higher standard than just winning, downside is they occasionally blame the kiwi players when a team outplays them which rarely happens in fairness."
rugbyunion,3bumgf,tobomori,2,Thu Jul 2 11:21:54 2015 UTC,The narrative created after the fact was excessive and removed from reality. I would say that is an indisputable fact
rugbyunion,3bumgf,reddititis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:20:34 2015 UTC,It had to be a kiwi paper to think that the reaction was excessive.
rugbyunion,3bumgf,da_gan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:46:56 2015 UTC,I just don't think its relevant and it really annoys me that they feel the need to write so much about it when talking about a legend like carter.
rugbyunion,3bumgf,some_sort_of_monkey,3,Thu Jul 2 22:01:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely the best I think. I remember at his peak I thought he could do no wrong. I've never seen such a complete player. He wasn't just good at everything, he was great at everything. Except for scrummaging, maybe. And the way he made it look all so easy."
rugbyunion,3bumgf,afunky,3,Thu Jul 2 11:14:44 2015 UTC,His lineout skills were amazing. The way he could throw it in and then lift himself was incredible... But yes easily one of my favourite non Scottish players. In fact probably my favourite player fullstop.
rugbyunion,3bumgf,hutchero,3,Thu Jul 2 15:38:13 2015 UTC,It's the best individual performance I've seen in my life.
rugbyunion,3bumgf,sionnach,2,Thu Jul 2 21:00:38 2015 UTC,"I was at that game, incredible atmosphere and Gareth Thomas scoring quite early but then it became the Carter show and it was glorious to watch"
rugbyunion,3bumgf,flying-columns,2,Thu Jul 2 13:26:57 2015 UTC,"Difficult to say any single performance was the best ever. There's so much history that so many of us don't know enough about, and it's hard to compare performances over generations as the game has changed so much. I think all you can say that it was the best performance in recent memory."
rugbyunion,3bumgf,jbarbz,-13,Thu Jul 2 12:34:23 2015 UTC,Please...
rugbyunion,3bumgf,Foveaux,12,Thu Jul 2 10:05:04 2015 UTC,I bet it was pretty disappointing when you counted backwards on your 10 fingers and realised it was referring to 2005 and not 2003.
rugbyunion,3bumgf,reddititis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:24:47 2015 UTC,"Like, I know you're an England fan boy, I don't judge.   Who would take the cake for you? If you have one in mind. It's hard to nail down a best performance by a single player in a team sport like this."
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,It_Is_Known,12,Thu Jul 2 03:56:57 2015 UTC,So stoked to see Giteau and Mitchell back.
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,rugbyfiend,5,Thu Jul 2 04:29:59 2015 UTC,Gits very much so. He was unlucky to have to play under Deans who was a poor fit for the job.
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,BullNiro,11,Thu Jul 2 06:12:25 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Giteau under Deans was a player who marched to his own drummer, a byproduct of his own hype and the Brumbies' setup at the time. It always appeared that he didn't stick with the gameplan, and the amount of times he'd kick when we were on attack frustrated me to no end."
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,shulzi,3,Thu Jul 2 07:59:23 2015 UTC,"Ah true, I also should have said that Gits was a poor fit for Deans."

rugbyunion,3bu2oz,Saadik,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:15:13 2015 UTC,Yeah really suprising to see Giteau. Hopefully he still has the pace to make an impact in international play.
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,TryTime_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:38:31 2015 UTC,"He's been phenomenal in Toulon the last couple seasons, the best player in an outrageously talented squad."
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,wowjiffylube,13,Thu Jul 2 17:02:03 2015 UTC,I feel for Cummins but given his form it would be hard to warrant taling him. At least as far as the backs go it seems form is being rewarded.   Don't know if that is also true with some of the forwards selections though.
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,sackrace,3,Thu Jul 2 05:53:30 2015 UTC,I hope Cummins gets some vox pop segments going over there

rugbyunion,3bu2oz,royal_oui,7,Thu Jul 2 14:03:43 2015 UTC,Fucking tough on Gill but I'm stoked to see Holmes back in the mix.  Also no captain decision yet?
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,GreatJusticeForSGU,7,Thu Jul 2 05:01:37 2015 UTC,Hopefully Moore.
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,Douges,5,Thu Jul 2 05:07:45 2015 UTC,"I would love to see Pocock get it, but I think you are right."
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,Jiffyrabbit,2,Thu Jul 2 07:03:07 2015 UTC,"The only problem there is, people will then complain that 'Pocock only got the 7 jersey over Hooper because he is captain'.   I just, once and for all want to see who Cheika plays in the 7 jersey and who starts from the bench."
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,Douges,11,Thu Jul 2 07:41:50 2015 UTC,He'll play Pocock at 7. Madness not to
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,WILD_CARD_BITCHES_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:14:18 2015 UTC,"I think Pocock has a better interaction and relationship with the ref's, and is a better leader than Moore. Moore is good, but often too quiet, and it's easier to influence a ref while hanging off the side of a scrum, rather than having your head buried in the middle of it."
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,dr_chim_richaldz,2,Thu Jul 2 14:41:15 2015 UTC,"Very tough on Gill. I think he walks on to the team in most other nations and he cant even make the Aussie squad. Not sure how they do it but Aust churns out an incredible amount of quality 7s, too many for them all to get the recognition they deserve. Gill now, Croft not too long before him."
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,poolnallinnit,2,Thu Jul 2 14:06:34 2015 UTC,Sure is. It's good to know we have a quality 7 miss out tho. He may still get a gig with lots of games before the WC kicks off.  Maybe he can slot back to 7s earlier??

rugbyunion,3bu2oz,surfmeh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:30:25 2015 UTC,"He gets a bad wrap as a scrummager, which I think is undeserved, but on a 50/50 call refs well be 80/20 against him, his opponents play to that (as you would) hence he becomes a liability in terms our penalty count... You forget that Moore, Sio and Benny dominated some pretty big Sith African packs.  Ps I noticed the phone auto corrected south to Sith, and I'm good with that!"
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,Squid_Chunks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:59:02 2015 UTC,"You are right. Alexander is a decent enough prop. He has flaws, but can be dominant at SR level.

rugbyunion,3bu2oz,shulzi,3,Thu Jul 2 04:32:36 2015 UTC,Mumm's only highlight has every been that fend. That's it.
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,MrSouthWest,11,Thu Jul 2 07:56:23 2015 UTC,You obviously didn't see him at Exeter?  Captain fantastic.
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,shulzi,3,Thu Jul 2 08:13:08 2015 UTC,"No, tbh I doubt many Aussies have. My judgement has been based on his time at the Waratahs, now and before he joined the Chiefs. Do you have a highlight package on file of his time at Exeter?"
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,MrSouthWest,12,Thu Jul 2 08:14:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think he has a highlight package of sorts but there is this youtube video of him scoring a great try which typifies his time in Europe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMVo1OQ6UPQ  I also posted this on another forum which may help explain his time in Europe:   When Mumm first signed for us all the discussion from our fans stemmed from the only time we had heard his name mentioned before - when he did that famous hand-off. We/I anticipated it might be just another solid Southern-Hemisphere import to the Aviva Premiership who would stay a few seasons before leaving again.  What became apparent is the class/talent/professionalism of Mumm. For an outsider/Aussie to be chosen as captain within a year of being at the club is testament to his character and impact in the dressing room. At Exeter we have a very close group/family of players so for him to be able to step up and do that is remarkable.  Off the pitch he is a true gent (http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Exeter-postman-receives-unexpected-gift-departing/story-26680459-detail/story.html) and embraced the local people and area. I had the pleasure of meeting him a few times and he would always be happy to stop in the street for a chat or a photo. He admitted leaving with a heavy heart and we would have him back in an instant.  On the pitch he really excelled. Much has been made that he has been playing at a mid-table side and not in the top of European Rugby. Whilst this is technically true – Exeter have risen from a newly promoted club to a title-contending team in the time Dean has been at the club. We have won one trophy, been in the final for it the following year and we impressed in our first season in the European tournament securing our place in it for next season this year again. We missed out on the title play-off this season thanks to points difference on the final day of the season and on our day with Dean steering the ship can beat anyone beating the table-toppers Northampton on their own turf and Champions Saracens away too. We are highly regarded in the UK for our expansive style of play and we are many people’s ‘second’ team.  Dean’s individual performances have been very good for us throughout his time here. Admittedly, man of the match performances are hard to remember but his work ethic, unseen dirty work, lineout calling and general leadership often go by unnoticed. He has also managed to score some absolute beautiful solo tries often running it in from the halfway. He earned a nickname ‘Captain Fantastic’ when he was here.  This is not to say I cannot understand your surprise to his inclusion but I think his ability to play 4/5 & covering back row too is a useful asset to have in a World Cup in a likely cold and wet England where the forward game will prevail and injuries will arise. He won’t and shouldn’t be your starter but I think his reliability to do a job when called on is undervalued. His knowledge of the European game from his time here will also be useful."

For that matter has Dennis earned his place? I'm not too sure.   Like many, I'm of the mind that in order to play well in this upcoming international season we need to roll the dice on a few players and trust in them, and in Cheika's skills, and expect them to rise to the occasion.  Horwill and Dennis will never be as good as their opposite All Black numbers, but Jones and Coleman could be. Time we give it a whirl!   Question marks for me over Mitchell aswell, and Mumm for that matter. Wondering if those players got the nod due to their experience in the European conditions?"
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,shulzi,3,Fri Jul 3 01:36:35 2015 UTC,Dennis Mumm and Arnold should all be FAR behind Jones if you've got Skelton in the 2nd row. Dennis skelton lineout got massacred against highlanders in the SF
rugbyunion,3bu2oz,Coffee12345,4,Thu Jul 2 05:28:06 2015 UTC,I thought for a second that you'd merged Dave Dennis and Dean Mumm. Luke Jones should be there

rugbyunion,3bu2oz,lordsword,3,Thu Jul 2 08:39:10 2015 UTC,I think the big issue with vaea is line out and experience.

He looks so slow and lost when he toddles from one breakdown to the next set piece.

He has been the 3rd best loosehead so is duking it out with the 3rd tightead, Faulkner, (or would've been Alo-Emile if not injured) for that 5th prop spot.  I can see the utility in Dave Dennis and Dean Mumm (lineout specialists, cover 4-5-6-8), though why both of them would be included baffles me. Almost exactly the same sort of player. Much better served going for Coleman or Jones I feel."

Good work-rates and ball carriers.   Sio and Holmes will be their respective reserves.    Both are good scrummagers, though Sio does a lot more than Holmes around the park.  Holmes was injured all international season last year so didn't get selected.  I think Sio was injured for EOYT, so you probably wouldn't have seen him. Been around the Wallaby squad for a few years, just unlucky with injury This pair better at scrummaging than the starting pair, but not as good around the park.    Smith and Faulkner are the respective reserves for the bench.    Both duking it out for a 5th prop spot Smith better player during the season, but only covers loosehead Faulkner can cover 1 and 3 and was in the Wallaby squad last year, though hasn't been at his best this season (maybe that's due to the Force as a whole being terrible this year)"

rugbyunion,3bu2oz,NZGrade,5,Thu Jul 2 14:49:05 2015 UTC,"Yeh, remember a lot of people wanted AAC to take over his #13 incumbency for internationals, as his Super Rugby form hadn't been as good. But when he got into that gold jersey, he became a new man.  I remember someone made a comment about how some players work well in the extra space provided in Super Rugby, and thrive, whilst not working well in the more constricted space of a test. However, some players tend to work better with less space. Kuridrani, for example, isn't the fastest person, nor does he have the best footwork, so when he has the extra space, he isn't as able to utilize it as, say Beale. However, when he gets to the test stage, he is able to use his strength and his fend to make good metres and breaks. Just a theory however. I have suspicions this has been a similar problem with Nonu for most of his Super career"

rugbyunion,3bttzq,prodious,6,Thu Jul 2 02:33:07 2015 UTC,"First of all, you look solid in the scrum, which, as a prop, is your number one priority. Everything else is just extra bonus things at this point.   Other things you can work on: good hustle on defense, but a lot of the time you seem to be shooting up ahead of the rest of your team. That's really more the job of the flankers or centers, unless you're 100% sure you will make the hit. Otherwise it creates big gaps, especially around the ruck. Also, as a prop, your most important role in defense is to, when at all possible, be the first man off the ruck on either side, to make sure no one can take an easy pick-and-go.   Lineouts are another very important area. Obviously, you aren't as big or strong as you are going to be, but neither are the guys you are lifting. Make sure you can really throw them up into the air. Getting a quick lift is an easy way to make sure your lineout lifts are on point, as that's both a good way to build an attack and also to stop the opponent, if you can steal their ball."
rugbyunion,3bttzq,BZH_JJM,2,Thu Jul 2 05:56:16 2015 UTC,"Not bad, pretty good by American standards.  Scrums: Body position could be better, you need to get lower. It looks like a problem in general for both packs though. If you don't get low enough as a tighthead, the looshead can easily drive you up, and a disrupted tighthead is a disrupted scrum. On setup try get your left foot back far and your right foot further up and wider from your shoulders, It should be extending outside the scrum. On the bind call drop your right foot back, and on the set call rock forward and sink. Keep your head and just up so you can create a good platform to transfer power. It looks like both second rows are starting on one knee, so possibly encourage them to start on both as it allows them to get into a better position easier. However this is again by no fault of your own.  Your hooker's setup needs to be improved, both of his feet are in line, whereas he should drop his left foot back and bring his right foot forward to support the front row. He also needs to squat down and bend over to allow the props to setup at a lower body height.  Possibly try to get a longer bind so you an remain packed tighter against the opposing looshead, again preventing him from countering you.  Lineout: When lifting you really need to squat low especially from the front, as you are a bigger bloke this can be hard, however is definitely something that is good to work on.   Try and walk towards the jumper as you lift, almost like both lifters are squeezing a pimple. At 7:49 your back lifter is walking in however you aren't, putting the jumper off balance.   Open play: Try and hit the rucks a higher spped, your a big lad so use that size to your advantage. Try and clear out more, this is usually the flankers job however someone of your size can be a deadly force being the first to the ruck.  Work on getting around the corner, by that I mean standing on the side of the ruck that play is moving. This is 99% going to be the open side. This is where the opposition forwards are going to be, so you need to be their making big defensive plays.

rugbyunion,3bt02f,harblstuff,2,Wed Jul 1 23:31:59 2015 UTC,"Very well, actually! We won the Women's 6 Nations this year (won the Grand Slam two years ago) and performed better than expected in the 2014 WRWC - in the same competition the Irish Women's team was the first Irish team to beat a team from New Zealand.  The Grand Slam brought one or two matches to live TV, the achievements in the WRWC have convinced Ireland to make the team fully professional (and they're currently pushing the sport for women, along with now setting up infrastructure for a professional set up) and another good W6N performance saw the sport return to public TV.   We're now going to host qualifiers for the Women's 7s in August and we are also going to host the 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup in Dublin.   That said, we're still behind England and New Zealand. Two teams that can easily give us a good thumping. We're around the same level as Wales and France.   Edit: FYI, the first top tier female referee for the men's game will probably surface in the Pro12, I think England also has a female referee moving up the ranks in the men's leagues too."

I don't even mind John Campbell, but fuck his sanctimonious garbage regarding this shit. Last time we played them we had 3 digits on them. There's no reason to go over there at all, let alone a RWC year. If the argument of ""pillaging"" was correct, sure, but you could make better arguments for Fekitoa and Naholo, Jerome Kaino is from American Samoa but moved at 6.  Why does the number of pacific islander immigrants influence why we have to play there? I mean, I genuinely don't understand why. It's not looking good either on there side, so it's a complete failure all around. And in a WC year of all years. Next year I could go along with and say ""okay, just to appease them."", but the minor chances of injuries is still even worth it this year.  if you have Sky, watch the ""The Breakdown"" replay. John Campbell legitimately sounds drunk and stoned during his interview. Incoherent."

rugbyunion,3bsv3s,noobkiwi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:51:07 2015 UTC,"I think we'd give them back more if we played the game in NZ or even an exhibition in England/Hong Kong or some place that is going to make them some money.   I know it’s not all about money, but really what else do we have to offer that we don't already? We already fund the bulk of their players’ salaries and player development with most of them playing their non-international rugby here.   What they get from this game is a lesson on how to get wrecked by a 3rd string AB team who have barely played together. This game helps no-one IMO. I'm all for helping PI nations out, but this is not the way. It would be different if the country had cash and infrastructure to funnel into rugby development like Japan or the US, but Samoa isn't going to be attracting top-tier talent anytime soon.  Don't know about this other excuse ""we play too much rugby"". It isn't really a problem for NZ, due to the depth we have.   I think NZRUs' priority should be in Aus and helping grow the game there. Japan and the US are valuable but if Aussies are strong, it makes the market a better place for more PI players to find a team."
rugbyunion,3bsv3s,grubbr,5,Fri Jul 3 02:21:24 2015 UTC,"I have a sinking suspicion this will be the last visit to the islands for a while. While the sentiment of an ABs visit has been noble and the occasion one for the history books, the reality is it will have been a costly exercise for the SRU to undertake and the tangible benefits on the local development environment, I suspect, will be short-lived before returning to sub-par standards. I truly hope not but I won't be holding my breath."
rugbyunion,3bsv3s,GGG_letsdothis,3,Wed Jul 1 22:23:47 2015 UTC,I think a better way for NZ to stand up for Samoa would be to use their power to get better treatment of Island players by NH clubs. e.g. releasing them for the World Cup.

Hell, we certainly ain't going to profit from it. And it's no secret that average Samoan can barely afford shoes, they're having to fork out big money to attend a match the Prime Minister promised would be such a joyish occasion for the Samoan people.

rugbyunion,3brqxh,harblstuff,2,Wed Jul 1 23:26:50 2015 UTC,Made same comment on another thread... Too many Irish players chatted too him and we lost his ear.
rugbyunion,3brqxh,reddititis,2,Wed Jul 1 23:46:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Barnes was already on to us at the breakdown.   It's quite interesting, after the Ireland vs France match (Barnes reffed) and Ireland v England match, we were slated in the press for our New Zealand tactics at the breakdown (borderline, not necessarily illegal - but we're not afraid to push the ref)  The difference is when New Zealand realises it's not working, they stop. For some reason when he pinged us early on, the Irish players weren't thinking straight (I would have said playing the referee was one of our strong points since Schmidt came on board) - especially SO'B - and instead of adapting decided to whine.   Barnes is (despite what biased Irish fans would make you believe) actually quite a good referee, if emotionless in his decisions - I have no doubt he reviewed IREvFRA and IREvENG when he found out he was appointed.   I just think if it was Walsh he wouldn't have been as aware and would have gotten away with what we shouldn't have."
rugbyunion,3brqxh,harblstuff,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:51:56 2015 UTC,He is quite good but he picks on teams/plays that piss him off and ignores the other team for significant periods.   Personally felt our breakdown tactics were fine but wales countered by 2nd player flopping in tackle on tackler and while our complaints were legitimate he felt we were slowing which is fine as he was consistent.
rugbyunion,3brqxh,reddititis,2,Thu Jul 2 08:30:34 2015 UTC,"There wasn't a lot wrong with it - but that's not what he perceived, is what I meant. In the run up there was criticism in the British media about Ireland's breakdown, especially in Ireland vs England, but also a bit in Ireland vs France. Barnes having refereed one of them, probably looked at both and had it in the back of his mind to pay more attention to Ireland's breakdown - he was strict, Ireland wasn't necessarily wrong but neither was he, then the players started to get on his nerves and the rest is history."

rugbyunion,3bsrzd,Sweet-As-Bro,3,Thu Jul 2 13:40:48 2015 UTC,"If we all top our pools (and Argentina comes second as I imagine they will) I will be very smug.  He's right though, rugby championship has problems. Essentially there aren't enough games to make it a real comp. Maybe one extra team would be good (Japan maybe?) but the schedule is crowded already as is.  6 nations is a great tournament but is made possible by proximity, you can really attend away matches. A lot harder for the Championship."
rugbyunion,3bsrzd,BullNiro,2,Thu Jul 2 02:42:17 2015 UTC,"He means from a commercial perspective for example,  Six Nations - 15 Games, 1,040,680 (69,379 per match) (near capacity)  TV Audience is 120 million with the BBC recording an average of 8 to 10 million per match. At one point last year RTE recorded 60% of Ireland viewership were watching Ireland v England.  In 2014 Six Nations was worth about 400m GBP to the host countries through economic activity.  Tries - 62 (4.13 per match)  Rugby Championship - 12 Games, 430,582 (35,882 per match)  I looked pretty hard to find viewing figures for the RC but SANZAR have the shittest site of all time and I couldn't find them.  Tries - 50 (4.17 per match)  I threw the tries in because I found it interesting it was so close (although skewed by super Saturday)"
rugbyunion,3bsrzd,MethylRed,-2,Thu Jul 2 08:28:42 2015 UTC,"So he is offering to help the Southern Hemisphere is he? Sounds like he wants the NZ, Aus, SA and Argentina sides to play in the NH. He wears his beret a bit too snug if he thinks that is going to happen. The northern tours don't suit his calendar, so why not mutilate the SH timetable?!   Perhaps along with those numbers you mentioned, one could sum the total populations then compare the numbers as a percentage. That would present it for what it is - using the SH to bolster coffers at our expense. If the 6 nations is so successful, he doesn't need the help of the SH teams. If he really wants to grow the game, perhaps he should consider involving more T2 nations up his way before trying to pinch the SH glamour game for his fkd up ideas.  There are already plenty of SH players who ply their trade in the NH clubs without him wanting to take the 4 national teams he mentioned."
rugbyunion,3bsrzd,Sweet-As-Bro,4,Thu Jul 2 09:09:36 2015 UTC,"I think he is saying that the RC could maybe be marketed and compete better with other sporting events from a financial perspective. I don't think he is saying anything about having SH teams play in the NH. He is laying the ground work to get a unified season I would say rather than conflicting ones like we currently have.  This would allow for more interesting competitions along side the current ones. What about a champions league style provincial tournament between the top Super and Heino teams. That wouldn't be possible without a unified season.   I understand what you are saying about getting T2 teams more involved but like it or not the T1 teams are the ones that sell rugby and generate the income to develop and run the lower tier leagues like the FIRA cups and the Pacific cup. Without the money generated by the T1 teams this wouldn't be possible so while the utopian idea of having T2 nations compete and the top level is great they are ranked as T2 teams for a reason.  I think you are finding fault with what he is saying a bit early on to justify your reaction.  Rough calculations put populations at, Six Nations - 194 million ~  RC - 122 million ~  So for a third more population you get over double the attendance and about the same in TV viewers Id say."
rugbyunion,3bsrzd,MethylRed,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:28:11 2015 UTC,The SH unions also need the NH tours because they pay so well.
rugbyunion,3bsrzd,Enyapxam,0,Thu Jul 2 11:24:13 2015 UTC,"So for a third more population you get over double the attendance and about the same in TV viewers Id say.   So he is proposing more games? If not, then he is proposing cutting the Rugby Championship games? Where would the games be played? Certainly not in the SH because as you pointed out the value would lie in those games being played in the NH. He wants the SH teams to generate more coin but at the expense of the Southern Hemisphere competition. SH - 6 wc's between them. NH - 1. It's obvious which is the powerhouse.  If you look at how many games are already played in the calendar year, there is little room to add more. I read it as the SH will pay one way or another.    What about a champions league style provincial tournament between the top Super and Heino teams.   The Champions League of rugby wont happen without some concessions somewhere else. Club rugby is not the 4 nations he was talking about, but even so, that would create even more games and it's already a full year. Commercially, he should be grateful for 7's and if he thinks he will milk the SH it simply will not happen.   I think you are finding fault with what he is saying a bit early on to justify your reaction.   My justification is being able to watch the best rugby in the world. You can keep the 6 nations and I'll settle for the 4.  EDIT: Typo. SH - 6 WC's not 5"
rugbyunion,3bsrzd,Sweet-As-Bro,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:54:39 2015 UTC,I think you are misunderstanding my point here. He is saying that the RC is probably not performing to the financial position it could as in it should be making more money but it is being handled incorrectly by SANZAR. No one has said anything about moving the location/cutting games/altering the competition and I dont understand where you are getting that from. You are drawing somewhat random conclusions.  Why cant a cross hemisphere competition happen In a unified Calender? Run Super/Heino/Domestic at the same time and run Six Nations and RC at the same time and cut touring to once per year alternating hemispheres. That leaves room for a top 3/4 from each hemisphere competition.  The seasons are of a similar length they just start as one ends so why not unify?  You can still watch what you deem is the best rugby in the world it might just be at a different time of year.
rugbyunion,3bsrzd,MethylRed,0,Thu Jul 2 12:12:10 2015 UTC,"And I think you are misunderstanding mine. I don't care about the financial situation. I don't care about the NH at all. You have finished your season and before our national sides do the rounds, there is talk of changing things up for the almighty buck.   No one has said anything about moving the location/cutting games/altering the competition and I dont understand where you are getting that from.   Umm, from here:    Run Super/Heino/Domestic at the same time and run Six Nations and RC at the same time and cut touring to once per year alternating hemispheres.   Right there is an alteration! You even mention the word ""cut"", for fuck sake right after asking me where I get this farcical idea from?! Do you think the SH is going to play in summer or is the NH going to play in theirs, by the way?  See, he didn't mention clubs at all. He mentioned the 4 nations. And I read into it what you are already suggesting. Now you are proffering a Champions League. More changes. Super 18 hasn't even kicked off!   The tyranny of distance is already a heavy burden down this way, so why add to it? Every end of year tour sees the SH teams play over your way and that isn't enough?  See your idea is great in a utopian rugby world, but utterly unworkable without sacrifices somewhere and I know exactly who would be bearing the brunt of it."
rugbyunion,3bsrzd,Sweet-As-Bro,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:06:30 2015 UTC,"So how do you expect to grow rugby or to even support the current status quo if it isn't making the money it should do? You wanted the inclusion of T2, that requires cash!   Right there is an alteration! You even mention the word ""cut"", for fuck sake right after asking me where I get this farcical idea from?! Do you think the SH is going to play in summer or is the NH going to play in theirs, by the way?   This was my suggestion not his so I still don't know where you got that from his suggestions. Also with my suggestion the brunt is shared equally by scraping the already redundant EOY tours. They a nothing games and are the easiest to cut to make room in the hypothetical calendar. Like you not caring about the NH I genuinely couldn't give a fiddlers if SA or NZ come play us in spring each year. I watch the games but I wouldn't miss them or care if they happened or not. Especially if it was something worth playing for.  Its up to world rugby to determine the calendar or schedule for a unified season and if it did happen both would end out having to make changes and sacrifices. You can't have everything your own way and neither can we.   The tyranny of distance is already a heavy burden down this way, so why add to it? Every end of year tour sees the SH teams play over your way and that isn't enough?   And the NH teams travel the same distances and the end of their seasons, you aren't being taken advantage of with the tours and if distance is an issue scrap them like I suggested? For my suggested club competition ideally it would be held in a single location each time to reduce travelling for the club teams and it could be rotated beween unions to generate revenue to support that local union.  Why do you feel you always get the raw end of the stick? Do you think WR is out to get the All Blacks?"
rugbyunion,3bsrzd,MethylRed,0,Thu Jul 2 13:45:23 2015 UTC,"Indeed it was your suggestion. That was used as an example of how easily one thing can lead to another. Let me ask you a question: do you think he wants to increase the ticket sales to SH games to generate more cash and take an excise duty? I don't. Do you think he means play more games in the SH? I don't. How do you think he means to generate more cash? I wait with baited breath to hear it.  No the NH teams do NOT travel the same distances. You have that utterly wrong. Go check a globe and see where Africa is in relation to NZ, Aus and Argentina. For that matter, if you think Ireland's furthest adversary (Italy) is as far away as Argentina is from Aus or NZ, then you have one crazy notion of distance!  (Shots fired!)  And what is this raw end of the stick nonsense? If someone doesn't agree with your opinion, then they must be attacked by Ethos? Your argument is flawed and your kung fu is weak - like the NH game, like your idea of distance, and like your suggestion that WR could ever ""get"" the AB's. The game in NZ doesn't rely on WR. WR relies on the AB's. Certainly not Ireland. I can return fire too.  EDIT: For the pedant above - discounting the EOYT's the regular 4 nations involves the hectic travel distances, unlike the 6 nations. Arguing the point on EOYT's is moot."
rugbyunion,3bsrzd,Sweet-As-Bro,0,Thu Jul 2 14:33:40 2015 UTC,"Where did I say anything about the travel during the regular season? Read what I said again,   And the NH teams travel the same distances (at) the end of their seasons, you aren't being taken advantage of with the tours and if distance is an issue scrap them like I suggested?   Which was a reply based on your comment,   Every end of year tour sees the SH teams play over your way and that isn't enough?   My comment was in direct response to yours on the EOY touring set-up that is currently in place. I in no way suggested that the Six Nations teams have to travel the same distances or timezones as the RC teams and you are finding what you want here. The comment had nothing to do with anything except the touring.   And what is this raw end of the stick nonsense?    Is in response to the chip you seem you seem to have on your shoulder that WR and the NH boogyman is out to get you and NZ by stealing all your games and players away from you. You intimated several times in your replies that the SH is going to be ""bearing the brunt"" of any changes made by WR. I didn't suggest the game in NZ relied on the WR either, my question was based on the premise that of why would WR try to screw over the AB when they are the biggest money spinner for them.  Of course someone can disagree with my opinion or ethos that's fine and what a constructive conversation is about. My problem is that you already seem to think your back is against the wall and are unwilling to suggest any realistic changes to improve the reach of the game. You stance seems to be that the frog better not screw with my rugby on the TV.  The NH game is more profitable than the SH and so drives more revenue at domestic completion levels all the way up to international which provides more money for grassroots at the end of the day. This in turn increases reach and improves popularity. The suggestion from the article is that SH Rugby could maybe take some lessons to improve cash flow and reach which in turn will grow the game."

The city of Glendale has invested a huge chunk of money into promoting their city as a Rugby first town. They built a rugby specific stadium to attract national championships which has come to fruition many times over. Their home based clubs is one of the tops in the us. I imagine they've also promised some serious financial incentives for England to visit for two weeks.
rugbyunion,3brs3t,metompkin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:03:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't really know much about Glendale's rugby history (I only skied in my time in CO) but I meant more generic altitude training facilities (not rugby specific,) which are all over the place. For example, I checked out the Swiss Olympic one in St. Moritz which is around 2700m I think.  Re-reading the article it says that Glendale has the only high altitude training facility in the world - which is definitely not true.  Wikipedia article on altitude training says its preferable to be 2400m (8000ft) or higher."
rugbyunion,3brs3t,gonltruck,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:53:49 2015 UTC,Just read the Wikipedia article on altitude training and I think you overshot St. Moritz by almost 1000m.  Glendale and St. Moritz are about the same altitude.

rugbyunion,3brs3t,philosorugger,10,Wed Jul 1 19:40:19 2015 UTC,Just from the top of my head but I think high altitude training is to boost the number of red blood cells in the body. Making breathing more efficient. Red blood cells have a 90 day cycle so I guess the effect would last at least 3 months
rugbyunion,3brs3t,crazyc1,2,Wed Jul 1 20:25:02 2015 UTC,"Pretty much yes, the best way to capitalise on the benefits of altitude is to live at altitude and a mixture of training at low and high altitudes. The effects really don't last that long and as soon as you move back down to normal altitude your body starts to adapt to a normal partial pressure of O2. It's a widely used method of training but it's surprising how little ""conclusive"" evidence that altitude training works there is."

rugbyunion,3bs5lw,sennais1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:04:48 2015 UTC,"Being a bit bigger would probably be a plus; strength and athleticism is better than size; skill, technique, and knowledge trump anything but the freaks.  But none of it is exclusive.  Even in defense, the priority list is the same - a small skilled tackler beats a big oaf, and may even have a better chance to compete for the ball.  All of these traits will develop over YEARS, the best thing you can do is fit in at training from day one; which requires understanding what is going on and where to be, along with having the ability to catch and pass.  Experience is the most enlightening thing for a new player, that is why more than anything I suggest finding and training with a local club.  Summer 7s is fairly casual most places, but great for getting a feel for the flow of the game and getting lots of ""catch and pass"" in."

Focus on receiving passes in advance of training and fitness. I'd avoid trying to learn passing without help or you could develop some bad habits. Run sprint ladders on a marked field. Something like, sprint to the 10 and back, then jog to the 10 and back, then sprint to the 20 and back, jog to the 10 and back, sprint to the 30 and back, etc. Or just Google some sprint drills and do those. Anything is better than nothing with that type of work."

rugbyunion,3bs5lw,jasjori24,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:58:24 2015 UTC,"Scrumhalf/halfback is usually where the smaller fellas go, but it's a complicated decision making decision, and you need to have a good pass so you won't start there. You'll probably start on the wing and if you decide to continue playing and you improve you'll probably move to halfback eventually!  If you know  very little about rugby besides the fact it's a contact sport, something that differentiates it  from american football is requires cardiovascular endurance as well. So run.  However, the best thing you can do is watch a few games, get the gist of the sport, learn the rules and pass pass pass. Then run.  Lifting is also helpful and gaining mass, but yeah, these 3 things. Learn the basics of the game, how to pass, run, and lift."
rugbyunion,3bs5lw,crazyc1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:20:26 2015 UTC,"At this early stage, just keep it simple. Understand what your position(winger) does on the field in attack and defence.   Fitness:- Work on completing a sprint training program(google it), it will give you a good solid base to work from. Should last 1-2 months. Later you can work on agility and power training. Lifting weights is not essential this early, infact it will slow you down depending on your current BMI. At this point, you just want your body prepared for the things to come. Stretch often, before after training/game. The more flexible you are, less likely to get injured and helps improve overall performance.  Diet:- Count your calories accurately, very important. A very simple app like myfitnesspal can help getting you started and track everything. THIS article explains how to count calories and why its important.  Just a sample diet what you can Eat/Drink during the week:    1)-Water. At least 1 litre a day.  2)-Protein(tuna,sardines,beef,pork chicken,protein suppliements etc ..) and other low GI foods will keep you feeling  fuller for longer and aid in muscle tissue repair while maintaining muscle mass and burning fat for energy.  3)-Vegetables(broccoli, cabbage, carrots etc ..).  4)-Fruit especially bananas-help reduce effects of muscle cramp.  5)-Beet juice(1-2 ounch a week) great before/after a cardio session. Help carry oxygen throughout the body, detox and anti-inflammatory.  6)-Wholemeal foods like wholemeal bread and wholemeal rice. - Excellent source of energy/carbs/minerals etc.   Avoid eating: white carbs like white rice, bread etc. Important minerals are removed from these foods during manufacture.  Your diet should consist of at least 100-200grams of protein per meal/per day. Buy a food scale to accurately measure this. Meals dont have to be 5 star, just a simple tuna wholemeal sandwich is packed with the essentials.   Discipline, doing what needs to be done, even though you don't want to."
rugbyunion,3bs5lw,vatothe0,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:48:39 2015 UTC,"There is no ""scrum"" position. I play at a D1 rugby school and it's extremely competitive. I don't know about you guys but you just gotta go see how it feels. That being said. Skills is important. Buy a ball and pass it around with some one. It'll help you going in so you're not completely lost when throwing around a ball. Secondly is fitness, you need to have conditioning. So work on conditioning. Weight training can also help but fitness and ball skills are more important. I'm far more stronger than most of the guys but they're still playing more game time because of their rugby skills."

Now we just need to figure out how to put him and Hooper in the same team. But seriously, a fit Pocock is arguably the best openside in the world. Before he was repeatedly injured they were saying he was at least as good as McCaw, and I think that with McCaw's gradual decline past his best, Pocock can own that title now. He is an absolute match-winner, and we have lost matches in the past (when he wasn't injured) almost solely due to his absence.   3) Australia usually play above their level come World Cups, it is hard to judge how we will go based on ingoing form.   4) Despite the majority of talent going to league/AFL, the Australian franchises still have some great young talent coming through (e.g. Scott Sio), who will play out of their skins if selected.   5) Our attack is always decent. Definitely not as lethal as we looked going in to 2011, but still decent enough to score tries against the best.   Won't:  1) Set piece issues. Despite some (albeit inconsistently) strong Super Rugby scrummaging, the Wallabies remain pretty poor, with the exception of the occasional match. Our lineout has traditionally been a huge strength since the 90s, although I've noted a lot of our Super teams have been shit with lineouts this year, especially the Waratahs in the SF.   2) Although I mentioned that talent, we still have a poor range of talent coming through compared to NZ or the Home Nations, it is actually ridiculous how little support Rugby gets in Australia these days :( This translates to way lower depth. Some key positions where we have poor depth are lock, fly-half & full-back.   3) We can't close out against the ABs. How many fucking times have we lead them then fucked the ending in the last 4 years? Other than the HK match in 2010 and Brisbane 2011, we haven't been able to close out against the ABs and win. I can confidently watch Australia play anyone else and say ""yeah we can win this"", but when I watch AB matches I know we're going to fuck up at the end. In the past it wouldn't have been an issue with the traditional NZ RWC choke, but I'm pretty sure they're over that now.   4) 'Pool of Death'. Yeah look if Australia is in form, it's our pool to win. If we are average, I expect to come 2nd behind England. So much will be unknown until after the Rugby Championship."

NRL and AFL have effectively and aggressively expanded with new franchises and huge TV rights deal. The end result is a slide by the Wallabies, which means less people watch and even less money going in.  Why would you play rugby when you have a small chance of making the Waratahs and earning a good salary, when you can play for any one of 16 NRL teams and make better money.   Union was huge in the late 90s/early 00s, but since then it has slid big time. I don't think people really fathom how small rugby is here, the ITM and Currie Cup are huge, but here we can barely get the NRC off the ground."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,rugbyfiend,2,Wed Jul 1 05:23:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, to expand the ARU is absolutely terrible"
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,mikecasey,10,Thu Jul 2 05:17:01 2015 UTC,I think most fans agree it comes down to a combination of poor managment/ old boys club mentality & a lack of support for the grass roots.
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,Herreg,7,Wed Jul 1 05:26:49 2015 UTC,"And that poor management means a lack of support to the grassroots. Outside of the eastern and northern suburbs of Sydney, Canberra, and Brisbane it's rough going to get anything decent for your club.  And even in those places it's not like they're on top of the world."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,BullNiro,4,Wed Jul 1 07:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yep hit the nail on the head there. I know in QLD the QRU doesn't really give a shit about anything that's not Premier Rugby. Living up in North Queensland I don't know of any local union players who have even got a wiff of interest from the QRU, yet there's dozens of guys who have played Union here and ended up signed to an NRL club. There's not much interest in supporting rugby if you're outside of Brisbane, which is a shame because so many talented guys just end up playing league."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,GumbySloth,8,Thu Jul 2 11:18:38 2015 UTC,"I reckon the answer is pretty simple. Because of TV rights etc, timezones and tradition most people in Australia's only exposure to rugby is the Bledisloe cup.  We haven't really gone close to winning it for ages so everybody assumes we're rubbish and doesn't bother watching any other games. So there's no exposure, the best athletes don't see rugby so aren't drawn to it. We lose again. And the cycle continues"
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,strewthcobber,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:42:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, they should really be pushing for to get at least one Aussie Super Rugby game on FTA each week, or to get some coverage for the NRC. They need to grow interest in the sport outside of the traditional strongholds."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,GumbySloth,2,Thu Jul 2 11:19:43 2015 UTC,"Frankly, most of the games of Super rugby I watched this year, particularly the Aussie derbies, would drive more fans away then they attract.  I am a reds supporter though.  I have no idea what the answer is, and suspect that if it was in anyway easy it would have been done."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,strewthcobber,6,Fri Jul 3 02:38:07 2015 UTC,"we have poor depth are lock, fly-half & full-back.   I think you have quality at fullback:  Folau to start with Dane Haylett-Petty, Mitchell, AAC and JOC as potential cover.   Haylett-Petty is a diamond in the rough and has had a huge Super Rugby season, I think he's a fantastic player and should be considered for selection based on form; and we all know the others can be outstanding at international level.  For the JOC naysayers, you should consider him at test level because:   he was quality in the last world cup; he's very capable under the high ball; he's got great footwork to both get out of trouble and threaten in attack;  and he's got solid defence."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,sdfdsize,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:37:15 2015 UTC,You're right about backup at fullback. It's just that nobody else has worn the Wallaby 15 since Izzy showed up. Also agree with JOC and want to add that he's a quality finisher and can counter attack pretty well too.
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,Senatorjuan,3,Fri Jul 3 21:17:29 2015 UTC,"we still have a poor range of talent coming through compared to NZ or the Home Nations   Strangely, I think at least some of us would look at Australia and think you have a better range of talent coming through than we do. Certainly results over the past decade still suggest you have the upper hand."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,ronnierosenthal,2,Thu Jul 2 03:24:17 2015 UTC,Folau is a freak. He has been my favourite player to watch this year.

rugbyunion,3bpvt3,sdre,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:37:33 2015 UTC,"I'll add to the won't column by saying that I don't think Cheika has the analytical nouse to bring a winning game plan to each opponent. England and Wales will require different tactical choices and overall strategies. Unfortunately Cheika has this bullish, attacking rugby is the only way mentality that just plays right into the hands of teams who know how to win scrum penalties, disrupt quick ball and steal line outs. The Wallaby backs won't get the ball or will be pegged behind the advantage line and be starved of possession.   What I'm really saying is that Cheika wants to win the World Cup with his 'brand' of rugby and other teams are going to prepare solid ways of countering it. Cheika needs to win ugly sometimes and the Wallabies need to be able to play the Home Nations at their own game before they can use the attacking backline.   Also I am worried that he will overemphasise attack over defence. Defence wins World Cups. Australia only conceded one try in the 1999 World Cup (and it was against the USA!)."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,warbastard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:08:07 2015 UTC,"But the problem Cheika faces is that there is a lack of technical proficiency in our forward pack to support a highly technical and precise game strategy, our best bet would be to relay on our disrupting and explosive forwards and backs to steal games with flowing attacking pressure. In saying this however this strategy is still ultimately a bet, but I think our best one."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,stevehoffmann,33,Tue Jul 14 01:49:16 2015 UTC,"Will   Great line up on paper. Already written off as favorites so going in with no expectations (which is when they play their best RWC imo).   Quade, Kurtley etc   Won't    Great line up on paper. Quade, Kurtley etc"

rugbyunion,3bpvt3,xValarax,13,Thu Jul 2 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"Will    Cheika seems to have realised that the Wallabies can't keep neglecting the scrum. He's put a lot more attention into it for the tahs and this attention should translate over to the Wallabies. The front row is looking the best it's been for years.  Excellent record against Wales.  Pocock. What a time to regain form.   Won't   The pool of death, of course.  Our kickers aren't good enough. Australia's win record over the past few years hasn't been brilliant"
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,AHouseBuiltOnSand,2,Wed Jul 1 07:01:53 2015 UTC,"Australia's win record over the past few years hasn't been brilliant   Close losses versus Ireland and France might contribute, but aren't necessarily the norm either.   A losing streak is just as likely to be broken as a winning streak, Australia worries me for this RWC. If you top the group and we top ours, we'll most likely meet - I don't know which team worries me more, Cheika's Australia having a second go at Ireland or England at home during a RWC."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,harblstuff,10,Thu Jul 2 10:38:14 2015 UTC,"Won't   6/14 test wins in 2014, including a poor tour of the Northern Hemisphere. Assuming they finish behind England in Pool A they will likely play South Africa. A tough ask and they've lost 4/5 last meetings with SA.  Bringing in foreign players under new rules (eg Matt Giteau and Drew Mitchell) might disrupt the team.   Will   Israel Folau looks like a hell of a player and good on the counter They should be able to beat Wales and make it out of the group. A win against England could also give them a nice route towards the final.  On their day they can beat teams like SA, NZ and Eng at Twickenham."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,trillrocky,2,Wed Jul 1 05:12:01 2015 UTC,I'd still pick Ben Smith over Folau
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,fettsack,11,Sat Jul 4 06:52:32 2015 UTC,Won't:    Scrumaging is likely to be very important in this World Cup Their classic fuck ups at the end of the game (coughNic White) Cheika shouldn't have coached the Waratahs this season   Will   Pocock owns the breakdown The can now do rolling mauls (watch the Brumbies) Their backline can be unpredictible Bonus
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,BadCowz,0,Wed Jul 1 06:36:16 2015 UTC,Wow Pocock was ordinary in that S15 semi final
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,shulzi,10,Sat Jul 4 09:59:45 2015 UTC,"Won't   Relatively new coach and staff, leading to a complete restructure of the team Potentially not enough top-tier talent compared to NZ (seen most recently in super rugby finals) history of Australia's scrum may lead to preconceived notions by referees Nearly all of Australia's goal kickers have a goal kicking percentage of under 80%, while all previous winners of the RWC have had a goal kicker that has that level of consistency Lineout is still a question A big ask to come out of the pool of death top to take the easier route to the finals   Will   Despite a new coaching staff, team bonding and gameplans have been still been proactively addressed heavily during the Super Rugby season We have some real scrum coaches in Nick Stiles and Mario Ledesma, along with some real replacements for that hinge Ben Alexander POCOCK'S BACK! Giteau's goalkicking and experience are a vital addition to the side We have enough depth in the backline to minimise the 50/50 nature of Quade and Kurtley Our state of flux allows us to fly under the radar"
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,Grandmaster_flashes,8,Wed Jul 1 17:22:28 2015 UTC,"Will   we have one twice, so let's make it a hat trick  we don't even know who is starting due to some great depth in the back line and flanker position in particular our scrum is actually looking decent  if we get through our pool in top place, we will have the easiest run to the final    Won't   we don't know who will be starting. Which is a Double edged sword as our combinations might no click in time pool of death  running rugby may not be the best game plan in the NH we don't have a good kicker"

rugbyunion,3bpvt3,It_Is_Known,8,Wed Jul 1 05:12:32 2015 UTC,"Under Ewen, White was told to be the clearer of the ball. That won't happen again. Im more concerned about Phipps's terrible passing game."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,shulzi,2,Wed Jul 1 05:57:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how much of Phipps' passing game is a result of the game plan. Cheika's encouragement for his scrum halves to move fast with the ball means it's a higher risk maneuvre when passing. While slower passing may guarantee more possession, the extreme form of that is 'two-step george', where the opposition can easily identify where the ball's going."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,rugbyfiend,4,Wed Jul 1 17:09:23 2015 UTC,That's a concise way of putting it.
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,Herreg,7,Wed Jul 1 05:13:21 2015 UTC,"I think Nick White's chances to fuck up again are pretty slim, Cheika knows Phipps pretty well and would be an idiot not to select him, or even Gitaeu."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,rugbyfiend,10,Wed Jul 1 05:17:40 2015 UTC,Phipps was very bad in his last two games for the Tahs so his spot might not be as solid with Genia looking ok despite being behind an arse facing forward pack.  The Rebels fan in me wants to see Stirzacker in the mix but I guess he's a project for the future.
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,GreatJusticeForSGU,6,Wed Jul 1 05:30:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I think Stirzacker is a great prospect but this year he's lined up behind several established SR 9s with Wallabies caps.

General hatred towards NSW won't help.
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,Pinstripe819,14,Wed Jul 1 05:55:12 2015 UTC,I am so absolutely sick of copping repeated 50/50 scrum calls against the Wallabies.

rugbyunion,3bpvt3,sennais1,2,Thu Jul 2 20:52:08 2015 UTC,Vastly improved set piece.   One of the battles the Wallabies need to win this year will be the propaganda war surrounding the scrum. Our management seems to always abdicate to the English press on this point and it has cost us badly.  As distasteful as it sounds these kind of media games are important during world cups. Even a coach of a dominant side like Hansen still plays the game.

rugbyunion,3bpvt3,rugbyfiend,9,Wed Jul 1 09:48:20 2015 UTC,I think Kepu is definitely one of the best around the park tightheads at the moment. Don't understand why you wouldn't rate him? Slipper used to be a bit flimsy but has improved into a stalwart and I think Sio is only on the up and up. we have a shitload of really young promising locks that won't really come into play until after the world cup.
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,wowjiffylube,9,Wed Jul 1 10:08:45 2015 UTC,"It's ok, let them underrate our tight 5 at their own peril, I would prefer that. Skelton has turned into a physical monster this season, Kepu, Slipper and Sio are all decent props (I'm not calling them World XV but they're solid). Moore is very good.   I can understand why Skelton is underrated if you just went off last year, but he is an absolute beast as of 2015."
rugbyunion,3bpvt3,strewthcobber,3,Wed Jul 1 12:17:23 2015 UTC,"Generally, being ""good around the park"" is not the quality you're looking for in a tighthead. Handy, sure, but not the most important thing."

rugbyunion,3bpvt3,darthreallynasty,2,Wed Jul 1 10:35:47 2015 UTC,Skleton is a powerful ball-carrier but is he powerful in the tight and the scrum? That's where really big guys usually have problems against lighter guys who have core strength.

He won the Rugby World Cup with Australia and the Currie Cup with Western Province.  He won 15 caps for the Springboks between 1992 and 1994, scoring 4 tries and even captaining them on one occasion. He also made a record 156 caps for Western Province during Western Province's golden period before he moved permanently to Australia.  In Australia he played two seasons with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks before switching back to rugby union for New South Wales. He was selected for the Wallabies a total of 11 times, scoring a hat trick against Ireland on debut. All but two of his caps were from the bench. He did make a capable replacement for Toutai Kefu in the 1999 World Cup Quarter Final in Cardiff when the former was banned but it turned out to be his last cap.

rugbyunion,3bmpsx,speculumfight,7,Tue Jun 30 13:44:50 2015 UTC,"There's no great conspiracy. It's partly on merit and it's partly a commercial decision.  The schedule is influenced by TV audiences. The broadcasters want the most important matches at prime time (Saturday evening, Friday evening, Sunday afternoon) so that they can maximise viewing figures and get return on investment through advertising revenue. The best audiences tend to be where the game has been established for some time (tier 1 nations). The TV companies want these teams to be scheduled for the best TV slots. The knock-on effect is that they play roughly a week apart. Teams that are less commercially attractive are scheduled around this.  From World Rugby's point of view, the World Cup is a showcase for the game and they want to ensure that the best quality rugby is presented to the biggest audiences. This tends to be matches involving the higher seeded teams so teams ranked 1 and 2 in a pool are given higher priority than those ranked 4 and 5 who are seen as having less influence on the outcome of the tournament. In practice, this roughly aligns with the wishes of the TV companies.  This double-whammy means, for example, matches between England, Australia and Wales are scheduled for prime-time slots on the weekend because they attract a big audience and are important for qualification. Games like Canada v Romania happen during the least attractive TV slots because they will not attract a large audience and because they are less likely to be important to qualification. It really doesn't matter too much when Romania play France or Ireland - the matches won't be competitive and will primarily only be watched by the supporters of the teams involved - these sorts of matches fill in the gaps. That's roughly how fixture scheduling works, in my opinion.  How could the 'minnows' change this? 1) Improve their playing standard so that they are seen as genuine contenders and seeded higher, 2) Bring more money / viewers.  How could World Rugby change this? It's actually quite difficult. To give every team full recovery, the format of the tournament would have to change - it would go on for ever, be a logistical nightmare and be less attractive to TV companies and sponsors. Alternatively, if they handicap teams equally, then the biggest matches will be played at odd times, preparation for the big matches will be effected for one of the teams, and they will lose some of the revenue that sustains the game between World Cups.   How can rugby fans change this? Be genuinely interested in Tonga v Namibia on a Tuesday afternoon. Watch the TV coverage in sufficient numbers. Buy the products that are advertised. Send the message that this match will generate revenue equal to England v Australia. Then, next time, the minnow teams will be given better consideration at least on the commercial side. Will you be doing that? Is that the message you'll be sending? Somehow, I doubt it. I'm a big rugby fan and I won't be taking time off work to do that."

Pro Rugby is still relatively young and these countries simply haven't been around long enough to have the system to produce a high caliber team.

The Australians, by the way, had a full week to get over that taxing run-out against the Blossoms before facing Wales.    Mmm, it's almost as if there is a reward or incentive for winning games at the World Cup.   Look carefully, though, if you watch. You’ll soon spot the playing field isn’t as level as it might seem.   Of course it isn't.

There's also the European Rugby Champions Cup (was Heineken Cup) which is the rugby equivalent of the Champions League which only includes European teams.  The main international competitions are the Six Nations (England, Wales, Ireland, France, Italy & Scotland), and The Rugby Championship (NZ, Aus, SA & Argentina).  As for what counts toward the World Cup, most teams qualify for the World Cup through their international ranking, and all international games effect teams rankings.  Edit: Grammar"

As far as professional leagues go everyone in their country wants to win their league, but the true prize is getting selected to play for your country. Mind you American sports are all almost national leagues( with some Canadian teams). So there is no higher level. Look at soccer though.

rugbyunion,3bobg0,batzman,3,Tue Jun 30 21:04:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, in theory. The host unions try to play lip service to the partner unions by occasionally sending one of the lesser games to them. Usually it's only one or two a season, if any. Some teams are better at it than others, but they're all pretty poor.  Typically they sell more tickets to a game at the home stadium, but that might be because they usually only ever host lesser teams at the regional stadiums. However, we saw bumber crowds at the regional stadiums this year and it was great.

rugbyunion,3blyt5,maface,3,Wed Jul 1 03:40:02 2015 UTC,"Meh, it could be worse. The tartan is a nice touch, though it doesn't really match the colour of blue we play in.  Why did the entire video have to be in a stupid Instagram filter? You can't tell what it truly looks like"
rugbyunion,3blyt5,wicked_sustain,2,Tue Jun 30 09:42:38 2015 UTC,"The collar should be white, in-keeping with the latest test kit and the majority of the classical shirts from the amateur era (I could be wrong about this though). The alternate kit is good but the collar makes it look too much like a press tee.   Nice touch with the tartan. However, while I can appreciate the pattern, I fear we may see more than our fair share of upturned collars this autumn*.  *see rugger buggers."

rugbyunion,3bm0gz,Absence-of-Gravitas,9,Tue Jun 30 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"A ""free"" market wouldn't allow these sorts of monopolies. In a perfect world every broadcaster would be able to run their own coverage of every sporting event and we would be able to stick with the broadcaster we like most.  I guarantee that it would be the BBC for almost everyone."
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,Popeychops,5,Tue Jun 30 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"I think the ""Free"" part of Free Market doenst mean free ""as in beer"" but free as in ""you're free to go f yourself"""
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,Absence-of-Gravitas,4,Tue Jun 30 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"With the exception of Butler, Moore, Cotter and a few pundits I can't think of much I'd miss about the BBC coverage.  Downvote me if you must but I don't see why BBC should get it on the cheap. If it has to stay on terrestrial (which I think it should) ITV and C4 should be allowed to bid.  Put it this way, would you rather the coverage move to ITV or a tier 1 nation go broke? I know what I'd choose."
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,wn_,2,Tue Jun 30 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"I guarantee you'll change your mind about ITV after the World Cup. I remember 2011 and it was absolutely shite. God awful. I'm not even sure how they fucked it up so badly given how simple the formula of broadcasting sport is, but they did.   ITV is shit at everything."
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,domalino,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:41:17 2015 UTC,"Same problem in Ireland, TV3 have the World Cup, not looking forward to that, luckily I'll be at a good few of the games so won't have to put up with it!"
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,black_sambuca,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:18:54 2015 UTC,Really? I watched the Ireland - France game last year on an Irish channel which has adverts. It was far worse than the advert-free Beeb.
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,AlyoChem,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:33:25 2015 UTC,"Not really a fair comparison, RTE v BBC. Take into consideration that our national broadcaster has ads because it's budget is roughly less than 10% that of the BBC.   The ads are only shown during half-time, not during live play. That it eats into about 6 minutes of half-time analysis is fair enough since that's whats needed to bankroll several weekends of live sport's coverage, of what is a minority sport in Ireland.  A fairer comparison would be the sports coverage from BBC Scotland (if it had no institutional or budgetary support from the rest of the UK) v RTE.  What do you reckon was far worse?"
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,Tech46,4,Wed Jul 1 21:23:46 2015 UTC,"Absolutely awful if this happens, and really short sighted in terms of sport popularity. The amount of friends who haven't been into rugby and then have watched because I've watched it at the time, and loved it. Can't do that without any free to view platform..."
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,SushiBandit1992,3,Tue Jun 30 21:18:53 2015 UTC,We've lost the world cup to fucking TV3 who can't even do HD to standard aerials only through a skybox or cable! RTE can manage HD fine FFS.

rugbyunion,3bm0gz,bakaattack,7,Wed Jul 1 22:37:50 2015 UTC,"I know the world is slowly moving to privatisation, so I reckon the BBC should start having a pay to view sports channel  its bad enough having to buy to get sky, but i wouldn't mind paying £5 a month for sport with the BBC production team which is miles ahead of sky.  I know it isn't perfect, but these events will continue to move to Sky and I'd rather swap my Netflix for this instead of having to get a sky package"
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,criscros88,11,Tue Jun 30 13:38:19 2015 UTC,"They already do, that's why we pay for a tv license."
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,Simmo7,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:01:12 2015 UTC,"the BBC production team which is miles ahead of sky.   Not sure of this, i have always found the production quality of sky and BT to be top notch. Sky is just soured by the fact that most of their commentators are fuck wits. Greenwood and Quinell are good value though."
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,Enyapxam,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:10:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly the problem. Their production is fine, their analysts are shite. Still though, national broadcasters should carry the 6 nations. It's just the way it should be."
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,black_sambuca,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:17:42 2015 UTC,Terrible idea. They lost half of F1 a few years back too sky. They also lost the MotoGP to BT. BBC rarely have good shows anymore only reason I watch the beeb is for sports and the odd show here or there (all that comes to mind currently is peaky blinders)
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,LostInTheVoid_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:04:05 2015 UTC,"As much as I think BBC is the best place for the Six Nations, as it should be on free to air, but I can see Sky making a series push to get the rights, given the rights they have lost to BT Sport"
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,Exile28,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:07:52 2015 UTC,It would be a terrible loss to the BBC if the Six Nations was to be lost to more 'commercial' TV station. It would sadden me deeply; I don't have Sky (yet) and this would deprive me of yet more sport.  Come on commission and own place!

rugbyunion,3bm0gz,J0nShannow,15,Tue Jun 30 10:01:27 2015 UTC,I disagree. I think it's one of the best things they do. Look how bad ITV do football - that's the standard of coverage we'll see if they get it.
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,truffs1010,9,Tue Jun 30 11:16:41 2015 UTC,Look how bad ITV does at World Cup rugby. Diabolical stuff.
rugbyunion,3bm0gz,J0nShannow,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:51:30 2015 UTC,I don't really follow football so I can't comment on that front but the lineup of commentators they have announced for the world cup sounds phenomenal.

rugbyunion,3bmkju,Vanadyel,2,Tue Jun 30 12:55:55 2015 UTC,"Google Translate   Throughout the season, the medical staff of ""yellow and blue"" conducted in collaboration with Professor Vincent Fir (Medical Biochemistry Department Head of the CHU Gabriel Montpied Clermont-Ferrand) a research on concussions dosing the blood concentration of a protein which are increased after a shock to the head. A relevant study that could quickly lead to its use on a wider scale ...  The S100 beta: that her name, she was the center of attention this season, the side of the pitch and the ""yellow and blue"" who studied his every identified brain changes after each shock. In partnership with Professor Sapin team which studied for many years the assays of this protein in brain injury, Clermont has implemented a systematic determination of S100B after shock phenomena in order to find a correlation between "" brain shock ""and"" elevation of this protein in the blood. ""  ""The brain not an organ like any other! ""  As a recent study by Professor Fir reveals, the evolution of this biomarker (patients received emergency in several French hospitals after a cerebral shock) is indicative of the severity of the trauma. In order to protect their players, beyond the framework imposed by the IRB, the Clermont medical staff decided to extrapolate this study players to ASM. Aware that ""the brain is not an organ like any other! ""Physicians"" yellow and blue ""Thibault Mathieu Stiernon and Abbot have paid special attention to the study."" We are confident that the assay of this protein shows significantly from traumatic brain. During the season, we have seen a systematic increase in its blood level after all proven cases of concussions on our players, and especially an increase that had endured over time. This contrasted with the assays of the players who received many shocks during a match but that had not been concussed, ""says Dr. Stiernon."" We even went further by correlating clinical signs in this assay by observing the return the ""normal"" state. When the player feels nothing more, this protein back to a clean baseline to each player, ""adds Dr. Abbott. A higher rate than the basic level is a kind of signal ""warning"" indicating that the brain is still ""suffering"" because of the trauma and all precautions must be observed. ""The risk is to hand field a player whose brain is still ""fragile state"" because we know very well that at that time, the second shock will be even more ""traumatic"" and potentially ""dangerous"" for the player of the brain "" insists the Stiernon Doctor. Risks that do not want to take the Clermont doctors who, throughout the season, used the S100B protein as a ""barrier"" to back on the field.  ""A blood test is rational ...""  ""Several times we took the decision to delay the return to training of some players who had not found a"" normal ""dosage despite the disappearance of signs"" obvious ""and the opportunity to do so under the Protocol"" concussion ""current. ""You have to understand,"" says Dr. Stiernon, ""many signs of the protocol are subjective and players tend to underestimate their symptoms for several reasons: the first is that they do not feel hurt."" The KO is now accepted but less obvious symptoms are very often overlooked by players who want to continue to play. ""They are in the short term and do not become aware of the medium or long term, yet the brain can be shaken and therefore ""in a fragile situation."" The second reason is in the post match interview to 48 or 72 hours. ""The boys are competitors and they can voluntarily silence the small signs that the effects of the trauma are still present to play the next game ... With dosing, we protect that. If 36 hours after the match the protein is not returned to its ""standard"" rate (established in the beginning of season individually for each player), we do not question the boys on the field and we are taking the next step overcome established in the protocol, ""Dr. Abbott strongly ahead. This will take the pressure or guilt ""blood assays do not lie! ""He concludes. A ASM no question of playing with the physical integrity of the players and two precautions are better than one, hence the desire to find new biomarkers supposed to protect their players. After one year, the time is the first assessments and transition from the stage ""researcher"" in ""precursor"". Thus Clermont doctors presented their work (published shortly) Professor Decq (neurosurgeon in charge of concussion protocol to the NRL and FFR) which, interested in this new approach, wants to expand the study of the contribution of S100B to other clubs next season.  With this new complementary approach to the protocol already in place, the medical staff of ""yellow and blue"" could well be the cause of a practice on a larger scale, in the championship of France and why not many au beyond ... More than ever, when the players' health is at stake, it is everyone's interest to play ""collective"" ..."

rugbyunion,3blpcd,WallopyJoe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:47:30 2015 UTC,Sadly we weren't offered it. Not aware of any outlets with it at the moment. Do they have a competition store?

rugbyunion,3bkmok,cape7,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"I guess I am looking at the promise of the players and not their past.  There are around 6-8 guys who will be in contention for the next world cup and at least 2 that may even get a call up this year if there are any injuries in the current squad. If they can find cohesion like their first test in Japan last year this team will be electrifying.  The best teams are those that play with cohesion and there seems to be some top class combinations in the squad.  As far as Super XV, there are some good combos from the chiefs and the highlanders in there. There are also a few players who I think should be in Super and are not, Joe Royal is amazing to watch.  Without injuries and including players from the ABs there could be a world class team on the field but as it stands it looks either strong or promising in all areas.   It will be a game of youth and skill VS experience and ability, both teams will play with passion and pride and nothing will be left out on the field. Damn I wish I could be there."

rugbyunion,3bl507,moreballsplease,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:34:40 2015 UTC,Hoohaa was probably the best saffa wing in Super Rugby and gave a good reckoning of himself in the last RC. At least he avoided the aimless box kicking for the most part.

If I remember correctly Halfpenny was meant to be doing a kicking one but was injured so couldn't and was forced to turn up anyway so had nothing to do but watch which was why he seemed in a mood

Yeah he just stood at the side of the pitch and looked like he'd dropped his ice cream, don't think he smiled in the video at all.

rugbyunion,3bjvo1,minutesir,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:48:41 2015 UTC,"As things stand, Sanchez  is the main fly half (No brainer choice) while Socino (Plays in Newcastle) is his replacement, i would put Urdapilleta in place of Socino.   Santiago Fernandez wasn´t included in the list as well but he was more of the Phelan era whilst Urdapilleta was coached by Hourcade on several occasions with the Pampas."

From there, the bigger clubs (Eastwood, Uni, Randiwck, Easts) pick away at the talent, leaving the emus with no senior players. The ARU to this point has just kept the Emus on absolute basic life support, rather than have them flourish as a major force of Rugby."

Hopefully Taylor (who has been brilliant towards the end of Sarries season) and Swinson make a full and speedy recovery."

He's a good club wing but I don't think has it yet. Seymour has taken years to get to the level he's at right now and I think this is maybe a bit soon. Loved to be proved wrong!

I like that Dunedin crowd has been slowly growing as the Highlanders did better and better. The Chiefs match was nearly sold out and the noise would have you believe we were at capacity. The Zoo in full swing adds an extra leg I reckon.

rugbyunion,3bhaif,MashedHair,2,Tue Jun 30 00:19:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe somewhere down the line clubs can do a process like this where tickets for big matches have a priority queue or something like that for people who have watched x number of matches over the course of the season, similar to what football (soccer) clubs has.

rugbyunion,3bhskt,scruntly,18,Mon Jun 29 09:41:01 2015 UTC,"3 Conferences of 5 teams: Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.  You play the teams in your own conference twice instead of once for almost everyone else. The winner of each conference progresses to the finals and the next 3 best teams across the conferences, only counting overall points, progress as well.  Next year the format will change again with 6 (up from 5) South African teams and a Japanese and Argentine team."
rugbyunion,3bhskt,sissyhitsnhissyfits,8,Mon Jun 29 10:09:05 2015 UTC,"Teams are split into three conferences based on which country they are from. So you end up with 5 NZ teams in one conference, 5 Aus teams in another, and 5 SA teams in the final conference.  Teams play the four other teams in their conference twice (home and away), and four teams from each of the other two pools once. So all up there are 16 regular season games played. Each team is given two rest weeks, giving you 18 regular season rounds in total.  For the playoffs, the winners of each conference are automatically given the top three places, with the teams with the higher total points placed highest. The next three places (4th - 6th) are decided by the conferences being combined into one table, and next three highest placed teams gaining these places.  The first playoff round is between teams placed 3rd - 6th. The winners of these games go to the semi's, then the winners of the semi's make it to the final.  And if you think that's complicated you should check out next years format. It's confusing as fuck."

rugbyunion,3bhskt,cape7,2,Tue Jun 30 08:14:06 2015 UTC,"I really don't even think next years format is that complicated, just foreign.  Two conferences split into two divisions - 10 in the Australasian conference, 8 in the South African conference, which includes Argentina/Japan.  Each division plays other members of the division 6 times, 5 times from the other australasian division (or from one of them if you're in the SA conference) and 4 times against the SA division (or from the other one if you're in the SA fonerence  Then it's the number 1 from each division, so 4 all together (1 from South Africa 1, 1 from South Africa 2, 1 from NZ division, 1 from Australian Division) are then ranked 1-4 from their points, then the next top from the entire SA conference, and the next 3 best from the NZ/Australasian division are ranked 5-8 on points (I believe).  then you've got your seeds sorted 1-8 for the playoffs!  I don't really think it's even that complicated, just foreign to Aus/NZ/SA. It's probably more fair than this years, even in some regards. Plus most explanations of it are crap."

rugbyunion,3bhskt,fernta,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:07:07 2015 UTC,"Why cant they just move perth into the SA conference, make it 9 in each conference and get rid of the divisions all together.  Top 2 off each conference qualify as 'top 4' teams and 4 other teams qualify determined on points. Any argument about further travel for the Force is negated by having the Argentinian and Japanese team in the same conference facing the same demands."
rugbyunion,3bhskt,mufflar,3,Tue Jun 30 01:05:20 2015 UTC,"Two main reasons  The whole point of the conferences is to ensure teams play against their own country as much as possible, as ratings for ""inter-conference"" games domestically are much less.   I would imagine Force in SA, and conversely SA games in Perth would be the least attractive games of all for the TV money men in Australia. Force games are certainly the lowest ratings in Australia, and SA games are watched by almost no-one at all.  Second reason is that NZ especially (but also Au) want some games in South Africa as it means splitting the lucrative Europe TV money at the good timezone can be done more equitably - SA are in a much stronger position to take more of it if there's not many NZ games in SA.  That's not even mentioning the 15 hour travel time"
rugbyunion,3bhskt,strewthcobber,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:02:37 2015 UTC,"Yea but Force games are the least attractive matches regardless of who they play.  But the second point is a very good one and there would be little room for games against teams in other conferences in that format if you assume home and away against all teams within your own conference. Plus it would lead to the my conference is better than your conference stuff, which is mind numbing"
rugbyunion,3bhskt,mufflar,6,Tue Jun 30 04:35:00 2015 UTC,sanzar gets together every year in a big room. with cigars. and whisky. and their bankers. then they decide how they can make more money while ruining the competition. the easiest way so far is to just keep adding more and more teams and stretch the season out while paying some marketing people to explain to us how its good for the game. thats how it currently works.
rugbyunion,3bhskt,spacemanza,0,Mon Jun 29 18:51:16 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that room is in Joberg.

rugbyunion,3bhskt,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,2,Mon Jun 29 10:05:28 2015 UTC,"Basically there are three ""conferences"" Aus, NZ and SA. Every team in a conference plays each other home and away so that's 8 games. They also then play four teams from the other conferences away and then another four home to make up the 16 matches in a super rugby season. The top teams from each conference gets into the knockout stages and then the next highest placed 3 teams also get in. from these 6 teams the two highest get to skip the quater finals and go straight to a home semi final. the other 4 teams get paired off and play for a spot in those semi finals then its pretty straightforward from there."
rugbyunion,3bhskt,WhiskyBluff,2,Mon Jun 29 10:10:18 2015 UTC,"The thing to remember is that South Africa and New Zealand have domestic competitions which are considered important enough that they need to have a place in the calendar with high level players.   SO Super Rugby is limited to 18 weeks to fit those competitions in, as well as TRC, June international tours (in normal years) and end of year tours, as well as an off season.  A balance had to be struck to fit as many teams as possible (for the TV money) against a season length that doesn't let you play everyone twice. Teams playing domestically also rate much higher than playing against other countries so they were prioritised."
rugbyunion,3bhskt,strewthcobber,2,Tue Jun 30 00:44:55 2015 UTC,"Next year's a bit different, because we've got an Argentinian and a Japanese team joining.  So to accommodate, SANZAR have reorganised the format.  Super Rugby 2016 will now have two Groups:   South African Group Australasian Group   Each group has two conferences, the South African conferences have four teams each, while the Australasian conferences have five each. That's a total of 18 teams.    Who is in what conference?  The new Argentinian and Japanese teams will each join a South African conference, so each conference there will have three South African teams and a foreign team. I don't believe it has been decided which South African teams will go where.  The Australasian Group is split into the current New Zealand and Australian conferences.    Who plays who:  Each team will play six games against their own conference members.  Then they will play against all the teams in one of the conferences of the other Group. So each year will have you alternating which conference of the other Group that you play.  They will also play all the teams in the other conference of their own Group.    What about the finals?  So the winners of each conference (four teams in total) move on to the quarter finals. Ranked in order of competition points, they become Seeds 1-4  Then, the next best team from the South African Group, plus the next three best teams from the Australasian Group will fill up the remaining ""wildcard"" spots. Again ranked in order of competition points, they become Seeds 5-8.  This does mean every finals will be three teams from the South African Group, and Five teams from the Australasian Group. The eight teams will then play a traditional finals format until a winner is decided.  The seeds will be split in the common way, with Seed 1 vs Seed 8, 2v7, 3v6, 4v5.    This new format has some advantages over the current system, like massively reducing travel time for players; it also has disadvantages, like playing even less teams of the total than you currently do."

rugbyunion,3bgb33,SquidgyGoat,12,Mon Jun 29 01:06:42 2015 UTC,"As soon as WR starts really cracking down, clubs are simply going to stop signing Tier 2 players. It's really a Catch-22, particularly for the PI countries, who, unlike the US or Canada or some of the ERC countries, will never have the population base to support a pro league."
rugbyunion,3bgb33,BZH_JJM,7,Mon Jun 29 03:27:28 2015 UTC,"I think they would just deal with it honestly. The majority of these players are good enough that if one club doesn't sign them because they will be on international duty sometimes, there will be another club willing to step in. If the Pisi brothers, Sinoti Sinoti or Nalaga etc are looking for a club, someone will make them an offer"
rugbyunion,3bgb33,cape7,7,Mon Jun 29 04:47:08 2015 UTC,"The thing is, it's not the very top tier who are retiring: It's often underrated or aged player, who know they're vulnerable. Census Johnstone, Dan Leo and Capo Ortega aren't huge superstars, but are key players for their teams.   I think it's still awful but almost forgivable when club sides force players to miss internationals, but making them miss a World Cup is so far against everything rugby stands for it makes me feel a bit sick, and begins to make the World Cup feel a bit pointless."
rugbyunion,3bgb33,SquidgyGoat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:44:17 2015 UTC,"Well, Dan Leo retired because he wasn't selected, probably due to speaking out against the SRU. Census was pressured to retire, but i honestly believe that if World Rugby came in and put the kibosh on this bullshit, he would find a gig somewhere. They are only pulling this shit because they can get away with it"
rugbyunion,3bgb33,cape7,2,Mon Jun 29 08:53:06 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Census Johnstone has a young family, who live in Toulouse and are very happy there. Even if he does get a job elsewhere, he has to uproot his family, and potentially take a paycut. Not ideal."

rugbyunion,3bgb33,cape7,2,Mon Jun 29 09:01:42 2015 UTC,Exactly. French clubs are basically keeping Tier 2 rugby alive.
rugbyunion,3bgb33,SlowWing,2,Tue Jun 30 12:37:55 2015 UTC,They're going to ruin international rugby.   Without French clubs there wouldn't be professionnal Tier 2 players.
rugbyunion,3bgb33,SlowWing,13,Tue Jun 30 12:34:50 2015 UTC,It's a different situation Tonga faces because it's true they don't have the ability to keep there players solely in Tonga. Players have usually 10 to 15 years of pro playing time. So of course they want to do what they can to provide for themselves and family. But faced with big pay contracts they'll sign not realizing what they're signing away. I think these European clubs should be frowned upon for the bureaucratic rubbish. It feels like they're hell bent on making Rugby as complicated and silly as football has become.
rugbyunion,3bgb33,jeffrey2ks,12,Mon Jun 29 01:30:38 2015 UTC,"It's actually sillier than football, because FIFA brings the hammer down on clubs who don't release their players. Look at AFCON, that could not come at a more inconvenient time for European clubs but African players get released for that competition because FIFA has the power to say if they're not released, the club is fined and not allowed to use that player for the duration of the competition (even if their country is crap and goes home in the group stage)."
rugbyunion,3bgb33,savardfaire,2,Mon Jun 29 08:11:28 2015 UTC,The sad thing is you're actually dead right.
rugbyunion,3bgb33,jeffrey2ks,5,Mon Jun 29 09:54:20 2015 UTC,"There is something to be said about how Fifa's relatively flat structure where almost no country has more influence than their one FIFA vote prevents the kind of nonsense you see around international rugby for Tier 2 countries. There's more Tier 2s than Tier 1s, and Tier 3s would vote with Tier 2s so you'd get the international system sorted out quick.  Of course you could also get some pretty bad corruption as well, but  the IRB needs to do a solid and stand up to the English and French clubs."
rugbyunion,3bgb33,savardfaire,3,Mon Jun 29 10:25:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah the current voting system is fucked:  -Wales, England, Ireland, Scotland, France, NZ, Aus and SA all have 2 votes each.   -Argentina, Canada, Italy and Japan have one vote each  -Then the 6 regions of the globe, Europe, North America and the Caribbean, South America, Africa, Asia and Oceania each have one vote.  So Fiji, Samoa and Tonga who are supposedly Tier 2 and have been ranked in the top 10 over the past few years all share one vote, along with the rest of oceania. They have 1/14th of a vote each.  If the NH countries decide to vote as a bloc, there really isn't anything anyone can do about it. This happened In 2004, 2009 and 2011, when the IRB voted against proposed eligibility changes that were designed partly to help strengthen the Pacific Island nations by allowing players to represent Tier Two Nations after a one-year stand-down if they had played for a Tier One Nation. Just on sheer numbers, the overwhelming majority of member countries voted in favour of those changes, but the home nations didn't like it and were able to shut it down with superior voting power. Say what you want about the eligibility changes, maybe its a good idea maybe its not, but the point is the power imbalance in voting is not right."
rugbyunion,3bgb33,cape7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:53:43 2015 UTC,"but the IRB needs to do a solid and stand up to the English and French clubs.   Well firstly the premiership has way less foreign stars than top 14, it even has less than the pro12. Plus i really don't see what can realistically be done within the framework of european rugby considering a huge majority of the revenue comes from England and France in the first place."
rugbyunion,3bgb33,amplebooty,5,Mon Jun 29 11:18:59 2015 UTC,"English clubs did this before anyone, I remember Trevor Leota having to give the RWC a miss back in 2003.  The IRB can get the purse out and pay for it, or they can just go the FIFA route and say fuck you. The first is probably a little more conciliatory but almost any mean would justify the ends here, which are getting the best, willing players in Test matches and especially the World Cup."
rugbyunion,3bgb33,savardfaire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:25:34 2015 UTC,"English clubs did this before anyone, I remember Trevor Leota having to give the RWC a miss back in 2003.   And we also made a salary cap to limit around that time to limit player salaries beyond an optimal market value, which was going to happen. I'm just glad it's France's problem now and not currently Englands tbh."
rugbyunion,3bgb33,amplebooty,9,Mon Jun 29 11:29:56 2015 UTC,They want to own the game and it will end up worse than football if it keeps going this way.
rugbyunion,3bgb33,reddititis,3,Mon Jun 29 01:32:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's so much that they want to own the game as that they don't want the goalposts constantly  being moved by the international game.   With salary caps being what they are, keeping a player on the roster that you can't use half the season is uneconomical"
rugbyunion,3bgb33,Vehlin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:45:54 2015 UTC,And a player will learn more and develop faster by going too a rwc and being exposed to a higher level of rugby which will benefit the clubs.

rugbyunion,3bgb33,amplebooty,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:35:10 2015 UTC,We need a global season with set international windows and no club rugby being played.  I would personally love some games in the summer months.
rugbyunion,3bgb33,Enyapxam,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:26:35 2015 UTC,Competition from other sports in most countries would allegedly make that financially unrealistic. I assume cricket as it's a summer game and gaa in Ireland but I don't know.
rugbyunion,3bgb33,reddititis,5,Tue Jun 30 13:02:47 2015 UTC,i wonder why Tameifuna isn't in the squad.  Hoping Manu not being selected is because they have a final to play and will be put in at a later date.
rugbyunion,3bgb33,tweedledee49,5,Mon Jun 29 01:28:12 2015 UTC,I thought he withdrew from Tonga to try for the All Blacks... Not sure about that though.
rugbyunion,3bgb33,reggie_007,3,Mon Jun 29 01:34:15 2015 UTC,"He did originally, but the All Blacks weren't keen on him so hes moving to Racing Metro in France. There are rumours that he is going to try and qualify for France on residency like Uini Atonio, hes still only 23 so hes a baby in propping terms and could have a lengthy international career even after sitting out residency.   So hes either doing that, or hes one of those players who is having pressure put on them by the French clubs not to play for Tonga."
rugbyunion,3bgb33,cape7,4,Mon Jun 29 02:58:04 2015 UTC,I think he'll play for France eventually and perform well but have a slightly unpredictable streak.

rugbyunion,3bgb33,_antipodean_,3,Mon Jun 29 08:07:18 2015 UTC,I think it's time IRB stepped in. Japanese Clubs have also tried their best to keep their international players from seeing any international action. The Springboks were only allowed last year to play in half of the games.   I think if the Jap + French clubs do that they should be heavily fined or something. It's fucked up. I feel like I'm watching the most sinister side of capitalism and bureaucracy creep inbetween the fans and the game. It's time for the IRB to put forward an ultimatum on the matter.
rugbyunion,3bgb33,Dom24,3,Mon Jun 29 13:58:12 2015 UTC,"This is why I don't buy people defending WR by how much they spend to develop the game in poorer countries.

rugbyunion,3bgb33,metompkin,2,Mon Jun 29 02:36:47 2015 UTC,"Your putting the players in between a rock and a hard place.  The tier 2 nations largely don't get paid for the world cup. I believe that Josh Matevasi had to pay for his own flights to go to the training camps for Fiji.  The financial rewards for not going are substantial, your asking these guys to choose between playing for their country and supporting their loved ones. I believe I'm right in saying that a lot of these guys send money back home to their families.  At the end of the day its the players choice whether to retire from international rugby, I'm not entirely sure what you could do.  Perhaps WR could stump up the cash for T2 players to be paid for their time with their international sides?"
rugbyunion,3bgb33,Enyapxam,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:25:21 2015 UTC,"How about if in RWC years...    Any player who refuses a call to national duties is to be paid his normal salary by the IRB for a period of 3 months (1 month before, during, and 1 month after).    During this time, he cannot play for any club.    That should solve the problem, shouldn't it?"
rugbyunion,3bgb33,chief_boom,-5,Tue Jun 30 08:02:54 2015 UTC,"I dislike this residency rule. Ridiculous that someone can play for another country from only having lived there for a few years.

IMHO you should only qualify to play for any country is if you were born there. I might even push it to that your parents were born there. Maybe."

rugbyunion,3bg6gy,Karnaan,6,Mon Jun 29 05:45:30 2015 UTC,High potential for it to happen - I think Ireland are probably the most dangerous on recent form. Home town advantage could lend some aid to an England side who seems to keep teetering on the wrong side of potentially very dangerous. You would always be an idiot to not expect the Boks to be a dangerous factor and only a fool rules out teams like Oz and France though to me they feel like the dark horses (so much is going to hinge on who comes out of the pool of death).  If we lose it could be worse as long as epic rugby is played and a good time is had then I will be happy.

rugbyunion,3bfv72,amplebooty,2,Sun Jun 28 23:20:45 2015 UTC,I think Cheika will put a team on the field that will play ugly but will win. They played in disarray last year due to off field bullshit (thanks Kurtley) and no Pocock and still came close to beating the AB's twice. They'll qualify ahead of England IMO.
rugbyunion,3bfv72,amplebooty,2,Mon Jun 29 02:25:07 2015 UTC,that will play ugly but will win   IMO if they do that they're limiting themselves way too much. They don't play ugly very well regardless of how good the brumbies maul has been. Pockock and Moore are big names back for them but i doubt it's enough.
rugbyunion,3bfv72,reddititis,2,Mon Jun 29 07:08:09 2015 UTC,Like I said elsewhere the rugby championship should show their intentions. The Tah's style of play was more ugly than anything and  the Brumbies were...effective to a point. We all know that SR doesn't transition to test rugby but the Highlanders and the Hurricanes style  has made me watch SR again...
rugbyunion,3bfv72,reddititis,2,Mon Jun 29 08:36:31 2015 UTC,Yeah i pretty much only watch the nz conference plus a couple games against the better teams in SA/Aus. Huuricanes have been great it's just a shame smith/nonu will be moving on.
rugbyunion,3bfv72,reddititis,3,Mon Jun 29 12:13:19 2015 UTC,"That's actually my worry, if they take on England/wales physically at their own game they might get beaten up  and have nothing left by knockouts even if they win."

rugbyunion,3bfv72,sirwaltermanny,3,Mon Jun 29 02:35:55 2015 UTC,"Well 91 and 03 were good tight contests, 87/99 the French literally partied after beating the favourites and were too hungover to compete in final (players admitted that in a review of 87 and I've heard rumours about the same behaviour in 99 ).   11/95 were fantastic for the host nations and the emotion from the occasion was tangible even on TV (plus Donald was always a player I felt never got/took his chance with nz and so many legends finally winning it..plus my kiwi friends crying with relief made it special) despite being appalling poorly reffed games with serious off field issues (French revolt/poisoning) let alone on field like rougerie on McCaw/sa players taking out lomu off ball (which no one talks about - he was put in a choke hold from behind and punched ).  07 was consistent with the style of the two teams in the tournament so it was about as good as could be expected.   Edit: I'm really old.....I can remember more about those finals than I do Irelands performances or lack thereof in rwcs outside of one or two games."
rugbyunion,3bfv72,rugbyfiend,2,Mon Jun 29 11:16:46 2015 UTC,"That '11 final was the most uncomfortable rugby game I've ever watched and the French should have won that day. And old??? I'm so old I can remember going to the '71 Lions v Maori game at Eden Park. I'm so old I can remember full houses at Eden Park for provincial games and Wellington always seeming to have the wood on Auckland.

rugbyunion,3begsp,Shadowing_Lemma,3,Sun Jun 28 15:52:32 2015 UTC,No doubt Smith and Nonu are the heart of the side. That penalty he picked up probably held him back on the Top 10. He has been included in the in form centres lists pretty much all season however.

rugbyunion,3be5lk,douthinkthisisagame,12,Sun Jun 28 11:07:37 2015 UTC,"The video seems to imply that Buckman was tackled because he was held while his elbow was on the ground, but accepts that the tackler was not holding Buckman when his knee touched the ground.  The law is that the knee is what counts, not the elbow. Therefore he wasn't tackled.   A tackle occurs when the ball carrier is held by one or more opponents and is brought to ground.  15.3 Brought to the ground defined  (a) If the ball carrier has one knee or both knees on the ground, that player has been ‘brought to ground’.  (b) If the ball carrier is sitting on the ground, or on top of another player on the ground the ball carrier has been ‘brought to ground’."
rugbyunion,3be5lk,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,5,Sun Jun 28 16:30:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification. I've been watching too much American football where the elbow counts as well. Thought it was the same but obviously not
rugbyunion,3be5lk,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:38:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it doesn't come up as much in rugby, whereas obviously every inch counts on every play in the NFL.  When I was first explaining the rules to an American friend he was weirdly insistent on knowing exactly when a player was tackled and I realised then that I didn't really know. Mostly players just automatically go into recycle-the-ball mode as soon as they are on the way down so you aren't testing where the exact moment is."
rugbyunion,3be5lk,LiamWenn,6,Sun Jun 28 20:58:15 2015 UTC,"Tahs are a bunch of cheats anyway, every time the other team doesn't get called for something in Sydney it gets replayed on the big screen till the ref notices but when the tahs infringe there is no replay shown."

rugbyunion,3be5lk,fernta,0,Mon Jun 29 04:25:27 2015 UTC,Penalty against hooper then. Buckman scored so it didn't have influence over the game
rugbyunion,3be5lk,gonltruck,9,Mon Jun 29 06:41:11 2015 UTC,"Craig Joubert is a good referee & in the context of the game I can't see anything wrong with the decisions highlighted in this video. You can't expect any referee to be 100% perfect & the Australian TMO ruled on numerous decisions throughout the match.  Warratahs are a great team so I believe fans look for excuses when the underdog team wins; I don't think this was helped by Phil Kearns commentary which had a clear Australian bias.    Angle of player & tackle is difficult to call reckless, Naholo has arms around Horne's chest which quickly rise to his neck/face with momentum. Plus Horne rotates his body to extend his arm with the ball to complete the try. Possibly been given a warning or penalty if a try wasn't scored though I can't see this as yellow card/penalty try worthy. Not really fair to compare to the swinging arm later in the game which went straight in the face of Osborne.   Correctly awarded, Aaron Smith was clearly onside so I'm not sure why this was considered ""controversial"". Palu had clearly detached from the scrum & this was closely examined on replay during the match.   By the laws of the game ""a tackle occurs when the ball carrier is held by one or more opponents and is brought to ground"". To Joubert's credit I wouldn't consider Palu's hand on Buckman for a fraction of a second as being held, isn't it usually expected that they're held for 1-2 seconds? Nonetheless I can see why some would see this as a tackle & thus requiring Buckman to release the ball properly. I wasn't sure about the earlier penalty on Phipps though he was possibly held for longer & the tackling players did go over him bringing him to ground.    In order to determine if an offence prevents a probable try you need to isolate the offending player (Poitgeiter) from the play. Osborne was millimetres from scoring & to a certain degree his own hand was preventing the ball from being grounded. If you examine closely you can see Osborne retract slightly when he's hit in the face by Poitgeiter plus Poitgeiter rolls over him at the end. If you completely take away Poitgeiter it's most certainly a try as momentum would taken Osborne over the line plus he would have had the ability to extend his arms the extra few millimetres. Phipps only appeared to stop the try because Poitgeiter infringed which consequently slowed down Osborne & pushed him horizontally."
rugbyunion,3be5lk,AJayZa,3,Sun Jun 28 14:50:47 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you on 4. For a good explanation, check Steve Walsh here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wtYc-PPCCE).  The player who infringes is ""taken out of the equation"" and the referee decides what would happen if they weren't there. if Potgieter isn't there the try is absolute.  OP's measure of ""it must be probable the try would have been scored"" is incorrect as he is including Potgieter in the equation."
rugbyunion,3be5lk,reggie_007,-5,Sun Jun 28 15:19:26 2015 UTC,I'm not including Potgeiter in the equation. It needs to absolute a try would have been scored. There is uncertainty whether Osborne could reach out. There is also uncertainty on how much impact Potgeiter had which I feel was very minimal
rugbyunion,3be5lk,Foveaux,6,Sun Jun 28 20:36:20 2015 UTC,It needs to absolute a try would have been scored.   No it doesn't. It just needs to be probable.
rugbyunion,3be5lk,Foveaux,4,Sun Jun 28 23:41:05 2015 UTC,"Look at the change in position of Osborne when he is hit by Potgieter. There is a drastic change both in direction and he also gets rotated (as mentioned above).  I can understand why, as a Waratahs fan, you feel hard done by but I believe Joubert made the correct decision under the laws."
rugbyunion,3be5lk,_antipodean_,3,Sun Jun 28 21:17:59 2015 UTC,"I tried explaining this as well. As a fan of the club, i can only imagine how hard done he must feel. But to be blinded/trying to find excuses to explain the outcome in a different manner...."
rugbyunion,3be5lk,Foveaux,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:42:25 2015 UTC,I have clearly stated many times that the highlanders outclassed the Waratahs and deserved to win. Don't put words into my mouth
rugbyunion,3be5lk,sdre,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:39:16 2015 UTC,"As antipodean said, has to just be probable. Used to be ""certain"", though."
rugbyunion,3be5lk,sdre,3,Mon Jun 29 01:39:49 2015 UTC,"Number 3 is wrong in the video. Buckman was not tackled, ""an elbow on the ground"" is not deemed brought to ground:   15.3(a) If the ball carrier has one knee or both knees on the ground, that player has been ‘brought to ground’."
rugbyunion,3be5lk,gonltruck,5,Sun Jun 28 20:38:21 2015 UTC,There was also a forward pass from Foley that was missed in the lead up to the Waratahs try.
rugbyunion,3be5lk,gonltruck,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:51:03 2015 UTC,"I agree, the pass was forward. That indecision didn't have as direct impact on the game although it would have halted momentum and potentially a try."
rugbyunion,3be5lk,Infinity_Complex,7,Sun Jun 28 20:33:49 2015 UTC,Highlanders were far the better team on the night but there is reasons for Tahs fans to be annoyed at some of the descisions. I'm happy to discuss these decisions in more detail in the comments if you ask.
rugbyunion,3be5lk,Lyesalot,8,Sun Jun 28 11:09:16 2015 UTC,"At about the 43 minute mark the Tahs are penalised about 5 metres out from their try line. Aaron smith takes a quick tap, and is tackled by Phipps, who didn't get back to the try line. Smith is held up and the highlanders ate awarded a scrum. It should have been a penalty try as Phipps stopped a certain try by being in an offside position.   Also, Pottgeiter definitely speed the Manu try with his swinging arm. He stopped the forward momentum."
rugbyunion,3be5lk,rugbyfiend,3,Sun Jun 28 11:19:05 2015 UTC,"I'll take another look at the game as I only have vague memories of that moment. I'm not sure if this is a valid argument or not but I have never seen a penalty try awarded for offside. Legally, it probably should."
rugbyunion,3be5lk,Infinity_Complex,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:25:47 2015 UTC,"If it's a cycnical play stopping what would presumably have been a try, it would likely be awarded a penalty try don't you think?"
rugbyunion,3be5lk,rugbyfiend,2,Sun Jun 28 20:13:29 2015 UTC,Don't think that it constitutes as cynical in that situation. Maybe to the rule of the law (which I admit to doing in my examples) but I've never seen it happen before
rugbyunion,3be5lk,_antipodean_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I'd consider it cynical, you have to be back and not retreating often gets you marched back further (that happens a lot). When you're on your line and you can't be marched what else is there to do when people are offside?  Especially given he had to retreat because the Highlanders were awarded a quick tap. So infringement followed by another stopping a try. But just my thoughts on that section."
rugbyunion,3be5lk,Infinity_Complex,2,Sun Jun 28 20:50:50 2015 UTC,Its yellow card territory for mine. Penalty tries mean that it is absolute certainty a try would have been scored.
rugbyunion,3be5lk,_antipodean_,2,Sun Jun 28 20:53:41 2015 UTC,Penalty tries mean that it is absolute certainty a try would have been scored.   See here.
rugbyunion,3be5lk,im_philbo,2,Sun Jun 28 23:43:02 2015 UTC,"I agree, but if Smith was held up, there could be some argument that had that player not infringed he wouldn't have been held up. I would have gone with yellow card though, as you say. I just wanted to illustrate things really aren't black and white and a lot seems to be going into these calls when there was plenty missed for both teams."

rugbyunion,3bcdem,BZH_JJM,12,Sun Jun 28 20:49:37 2015 UTC,"I suspect Barrett is joking. But for those people who are taking seriously, I'd have to politely and respectfully disagree here.   If your argument is ""That will teach him a lesson for lying over our ball"". Players are committed to winning, they will do almost anything get an advantage, players already put their bodies on the line with crushing tackles. If rucking is allowed, you can bet your ass players won't care, they will still lie over the ball.  Sometimes you have to create rules to protect the players from doing stupid shit."
rugbyunion,3bcdem,bobwinters,7,Sun Jun 28 05:20:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Believe the deterrent is actually the ensuing penalty and not player vigilantism. If you can't take the law into your own hands anywhere else on the field, why in the ruck especially since there may be innocent players at risk of injury and in vulnerable positions..."
rugbyunion,3bcdem,CaptBaha,3,Sun Jun 28 07:41:35 2015 UTC,"And the penalty shouldn't just be for players not rolling away, but also for players falling over the ball where they physically can't roll away. Here's a good example of Richie Mccaw doing this when it was legal. Mccaw is hard (some would say stupid), he would fall like this all game even if his back was getting coated with boot marks."

In last night's case, there was a defender lying all over the ball not rolling away, so rucking is how you get him out of there.  Edit: I stand corrected. It should be legal though."
rugbyunion,3bcdem,reggie_007,11,Sat Jun 27 22:57:38 2015 UTC,16.3(f)   A player rucking for the ball must not intentionally ruck players on the ground. A player rucking for the ball must try to step over players on the ground and must not intentionally step on them. A player rucking must do so near the ball.
rugbyunion,3bcdem,strewthcobber,4,Sat Jun 27 23:45:53 2015 UTC,"Traditionally yes that is how you get them out of there, but completely illegal under current rules."
rugbyunion,3bcdem,rugbyfiend,6,Sun Jun 28 03:21:47 2015 UTC,"You are allowed to use your feet to get at the ball if you can see it but I don't think x-ray vision counts.   Yes, the brumbies player should have rolled away but that doesn't give Barrett the right to staircase him.   At the time I was praying for a yellow card but that was the desperate aussie in me.   Edit: although not too long ago this would have been perfectly legal. I think."
rugbyunion,3bcdem,jbarbz,5,Sat Jun 27 23:15:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah it used to be legal, I miss those days but that was high school shit. It was such a good deterrent.   However! It's pretty bloody brutal so I am all for it not being allowed in the game today."

rugbyunion,3bcdem,Foveaux,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:23:26 2015 UTC,Arse. Players were carved up rather than concede a try. Colin Meade's won a game by getting penalties for excessive rucking by lying on every single ball. Don't have a link to vid where he was talking about it.

rugbyunion,3bbg34,Shadowing_Lemma,31,Sat Jun 27 16:51:21 2015 UTC,Right call. Illegal action resulted in an obvious try not being scored. Yellow and penalty try.
rugbyunion,3bbg34,ptashark,16,Sat Jun 27 19:25:59 2015 UTC,He is trying hard to stop a try from being scored. But when he gets hit you can see the impact and the change in body position. Had Osborne not been hit in the head it would have been a clear try.   I really don't think any other ref would have reffed this any differently.
rugbyunion,3bbg34,Ironbroom,-9,Sat Jun 27 20:32:55 2015 UTC,Not really. Potgieter was clearly trying to make a tackle but couldn't adjust to the speed of the fall. Nothing malicious so he shouldn't have been carded.
rugbyunion,3bbg34,I_am_LordHarrington,30,Sat Jun 27 17:36:27 2015 UTC,That's not how these things work. It doesn't matter if he meant to commit a high tackle; what matters is if he committed a high tackle.
rugbyunion,3bbg34,Seravia,7,Sat Jun 27 18:31:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I think penalties can be aggravated by intent/maliciousness, but it's not required for punishment."

rugbyunion,3bbg34,ycnz,17,Sat Jun 27 22:24:09 2015 UTC,I would argue that the waratahs as a whole had a strong and demonstrated history of not hindering any tries last night.  ;)

rugbyunion,3bbg34,Aquapig,6,Sun Jun 28 07:35:55 2015 UTC,"Really didn't like this call at the time, but by the letter of the law, well reffed by Joubert. I think I was just frustrated since I was supporting the Tahs, and some of his decisions were compounding their stupid mistakes; if you're going to ping Phipps for getting up after being held, you have to ping Buckman too. Especially since you shouldn't even be getting up with the ball if you've not released it on the floor first. Ben Smith is great at doing that, but I don't know why he bothers because I only actually see it penalised like 1 in 10 times."
rugbyunion,3bbg34,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,6,Sun Jun 28 02:00:18 2015 UTC,"You don't have to ping both Phipps and Buckman if you think they are different.  They were similar, obviously, but similar isn't exactly the same and a small difference is all it takes.  You only have to release the ball on the floor if you've been tackled, if you haven't you can absolutely carry on without placing it."
rugbyunion,3bbg34,Aquapig,2,Sat Jun 27 21:14:49 2015 UTC,"Not being allowed to play the ball when off your feet is a fundamental rule of rugby, or am I mistaken? You do actually see people pinged for it occasionally."
rugbyunion,3bbg34,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,2,Sun Jun 28 06:14:56 2015 UTC,"Not when in open play, which this still is.  If you have the ball and just fall over would you release the ball?"
rugbyunion,3bbg34,Aquapig,3,Sun Jun 28 11:46:45 2015 UTC,"Looking at the laws, you're absolutely right. I've always thought you absolutely weren't allowed to be off your feet with the ball, but world rugby says ""A player with the ball must immediately do one of three things:   Get up with the ball, Pass the ball, Release the ball."" Got the idea from my Dad, who's always shouting for not releasing when this happens..."
rugbyunion,3bbg34,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,2,Sun Jun 28 11:48:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much the only thing you can't do is lie there with the ball and stop anyone getting access to it.  So going back to Buckman, if Joubert decided he was never held AND brought to ground simultaneously then he is fine to carry on. Bearing in mind that ""Brought to ground"" involves a knee down.  Same with Phipps, but in that case obviously Joubert was happy that he was tackled."

rugbyunion,3bbg34,UndeniableWit,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:22:45 2015 UTC,If he's tackled but not held he doesn't have to release the ball right? It's only if you're tackled and held that you release the ball and then once you're to your feet you can play it as long as no ruck has formed.
rugbyunion,3bbg34,Aquapig,0,Sat Jun 27 23:07:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not strictly a Tahs fan. In fact, the Highlanders are one of my favourite teams (along with the Tahs and a few others), I just didn't want an all NZ final because of all the whinging kiwi fans have been doing on here about the conference system.   Joubert didn't have a great game, but the decision that most comes to mind is the inconsistent one that led to a Highlanders try."

rugbyunion,3bbg34,rugbyfiend,3,Sat Jun 27 22:56:23 2015 UTC,"For anyone who is saying ""Resulted in try not being scored"" - this doesn't even really matter. If an illegal action is performed, you remove that player entirely from the situation and then judge if the try would have been scored."

rugbyunion,3bbg34,professorzaius,-38,Sun Jun 28 01:28:27 2015 UTC,Bad call. An enormous overreaction which would have completely freaked the nation of New Zealand out had it happened to one of their sides.
rugbyunion,3bbg34,HymenHoarder,6,Sun Jun 28 01:36:22 2015 UTC,Unlike the Richie McCaw decision last year then? Seriously the only people who are disputing this are butthurt Tahs fans.  This was a penalty try everyday.
rugbyunion,3bbg34,belriose,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:34:09 2015 UTC,"I, as a neutral, would dispute the penalty try but not the yellow card. Maybe I'm interpreting the situation poorly. Does the illegality of Potgeiter's tackle rule him out altogether as a defender? I.e. Does the possibility that Potgeiter could have legally stopped Osborne from scoring become void if his tackle is illegal?"
rugbyunion,3bbg34,HymenHoarder,5,Sat Jun 27 18:42:25 2015 UTC,"Does the possibility that Potgeiter could have legally stopped Osborne from scoring become void if his tackle is illegal?   Yes. It would be crazy to assume that a player in Potgeiter's position should have stopped the try, because there was a player in his position (Potgeiter himself) and he chose to make an illegal tackle! So by his actions he ruled himself out as a defender in terms of deciding the likelihood of a try.  I agree that it's kind of harsh in that you can imagine many similar situations where Potgeiter tackled or wrapped slightly differently that could have both been legal and stopped the try. I think the problem with thinking like that is that rugby is a difficult enough game to referee, and it would create more problems than it would solve. Players push up against the edge of the laws as it is, and encouraging that behaviour on the tryline is not a productive direction for the game. When the game is in that situation, i.e. attacking team in possession on or over the tryline, there is almost no penalty (except for the penalty try) that doesn't benefit the defenders, and so the defenders would be incentivised to keep offending.  I don't know if my rambling helped you, but it helped me crystallise my thoughts on the topic, so there's that."
rugbyunion,3bbg34,Darkwind85,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:31:53 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah I find it hard to keep it concise when discussing stuff like this too. I agree that arguing over interpretations of laws can be pointless sometimes. It's just unfortunate that the game's jurisprudence can be such a clusterfuck (which isn't helped by the lack of satisfactory clarifications from World Rugby) and I can see why people always cry ""inconsistency!"". There always seems to be scenarios where the current interpretation of a law seems ridiculous.  I'll attempt to do so for this situation just to see if I can crystallise my own thoughts. Say Potgeiter happens to be defending on the Highlander's 22m line and Osborne breaks through the Tah's defence. Potgeiter is the last man back for whatever reason and he hits Osborne with a shoulder charge or some sort of illegal tackle. Is the outcome the same? Penalty try? Does Potgeiter, for all intents and purposes, no longer exist in this scenario as well?"
rugbyunion,3bbg34,belriose,2,Sat Jun 27 21:46:22 2015 UTC,"Yes. A swinging arm is not a tackle. It is an attempt to throw the attacking player off their game by aiming for their head.  If he had been aiming for the players legs then it would be a legitimate attempt at a tackle. It wasn't. It was aimed at the ball carriers head, with no attempt to tackle him properly."
rugbyunion,3bbg34,professorzaius,2,Sat Jun 27 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"I'll attempt to do so for this situation just to see if I can crystallise my own thoughts. Say Potgeiter happens to be defending on the Highlander's 22m line and Osborne breaks through the Tah's defence. Potgeiter is the last man back for whatever reason and he hits Osborne with a shoulder charge or some sort of illegal tackle. Is the outcome the same? Penalty try? Does Potgeiter, for all intents and purposes, no longer exist in this scenario as well?   Yeah, it's the same idea, but it's harder to prove to the ref's satisfaction that the try would probably have been scored the further from the line that the illegal play is committed."
rugbyunion,3bbg34,Holdthesaltplease,2,Sun Jun 28 00:19:16 2015 UTC,"Does the illegality of Potgeiter's tackle rule him out altogether as a defender?   This is not how rugby laws are officiated.  You seem to be hinting at the ref making a call on the tackle only and not the subsequent consequence of it.  Rugby laws are officiated in context with each other.  The reasoning applied to Pot's tackle was no different to defending team collapsing a maul or scrum at their line.  Only in Osborne's case, he was mm's away whereas a scrum collapse can happen a few metres out."
rugbyunion,3bbg34,cubeyescube,6,Sun Jun 28 02:10:15 2015 UTC,Why would it have freaked us out? We were whooping your ass.
rugbyunion,3bbg34,MashedHair,-9,Sun Jun 28 15:41:08 2015 UTC,"The Highlanders were playing well, the Waratahs not so much. But there was no denying this call had a huge effect on the game.  Not nearly as bad in real time. Potgeiter goes for a tackle, Osbourne falls into it (not a yellow card most days of the week), falls in front of the line. He wouldn't have scored a try, but Joubert gave the benefit of the doubt to the Highlanders, as he did all evening. The amount of offsides he did not call was shocking. And what about that ridiculous ""held"" penalty on Phipps, and then exactly the same thing happens 10 minutes later to Buckman?  Like I said, the Highlanders played much better than the Waratahs. But Joubert had a real shocker."
rugbyunion,3bbg34,Holdthesaltplease,8,Sat Jun 27 23:08:51 2015 UTC,I think Phil Kearns is a redditor
rugbyunion,3bbg34,jbarbz,8,Sat Jun 27 19:54:46 2015 UTC,"The better team won, and that dumbass move was deserving of a yellow. I understand you're frustrated, but lets not lose our damn minds here."
rugbyunion,3bbg34,Holdthesaltplease,3,Sat Jun 27 20:02:55 2015 UTC,The highlanders absolutely dismantled the waratahs with their game plan and deserve to go into the grand final. (Edit: and were the better team lest someone think I'm having an underhanded dig at them.)   But I think it's a bit rich to call it a dumbass move by potgeiter. I'm sure most people would have desperately thrown their hand at the ball to stop the try.  In that moment is he just supposed to watch the try happen?   Yes the result of his actions was much worse than doing nothing but it's nigh impossible to foresee that in the heat of the moment.
rugbyunion,3bbg34,jbarbz,-5,Sat Jun 27 21:53:28 2015 UTC,"Nice logical fallacy, bro. He could have, you know, attempted to legally tackle the ball carrier. Swinging at his face wasn't the only option available to him."
rugbyunion,3bbg34,Holdthesaltplease,5,Sat Jun 27 20:04:21 2015 UTC,"There are a lot things he and other Tahs could have done better last night, but I don't think what he chose to do given the circumstances was dumb. Costly and unfortunate, yes, but not dumb.   But looking back at it in slow mo, in my bed, already knowing the consequences, I guess I can see how it could be thought of as dumb.  Edit: and logical fallacies? Come on bro. This is a rugby union sub. It's entire existence probably violates the no true Scotsman fallacy. Plus I was of the opinion that pointing out logical fallacies is a logical fallacy itself. Especially since you haven't articulated how I violated one. Though I'm assuming it's the ""what's he supposed to do"" line."

His complete inability to deal with bombs landing on top of him, and nobody else in the team with a kicking game meant they were under territorial pressure all night.  And how good were the Clan at taking advantage of their opportunities and turning the pressure into points.  Great tactical display from Chris Boyd Jamie Joseph, and any of Australia's world cup opponents should be taking note of exactly how to do it"

rugbyunion,3ba2d2,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,6,Sat Jun 27 10:29:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a fine judgement call.  Was he tackled, i.e did his knees hit the ground while the opposition player was holding him?  I think Joubert either decided that the tackler fell off before Buckman's knees hit the ground, or that he managed to keep his knees off the ground by putting that hand down.  Phipps was definitely knees down with a Highlander still on him, even if only for half a second."
rugbyunion,3ba2d2,saviouroftheweak,2,Sat Jun 27 10:38:26 2015 UTC,I agree but I can see why the Tahs might get annoyed I just wish refs were very clearly consistent but the call was probably fine
rugbyunion,3ba2d2,Koreapsu,10,Sat Jun 27 10:40:39 2015 UTC,I hope the Tahs fans remember that game full of cheapshots and dirty shit they got away with vs the Crusaders a few weeks ago when they go to whinge about supposed ref bias.   What goes around comes around.  You were the 4th best team this year and got this close to a final due to the  charity of the  conference system.   Consider yourselves lucky.

The yellow card was harsh, but it was a clumsy attempt at a tackle and probably would have been a yellow anywhere else on the pitch.  *EDIT: Forgot a word"
rugbyunion,3ba2d2,weakcoder,4,Sat Jun 27 09:56:53 2015 UTC,"I think it was a desparate attempt at a tackle, but I think it being almost a professional foul in attempting to stop a try is what made it a yellow. Probably only a penalty in general play."

rugbyunion,3baa9z,Frankenjim,-3,Sun Jun 28 03:38:30 2015 UTC,"1st part : ""u bench alot?""  2nd part: ""squat moar brah"""
rugbyunion,3bdxvz,Grandmaster_flashes,13,Sun Jun 28 08:41:22 2015 UTC,"yes, but i dont think it mattered.  i believe there was also a forward pass in the lead up to the try if we're going to continue whining about it and talking about ""ifs"". what's done is done"
rugbyunion,3bdxvz,fernta,-3,Sun Jun 28 08:49:41 2015 UTC,"If it didn't matter does that mean contact with the head is irrelevant in the event of a try?   If consistency is applied, and intent is ignored, this is worthy of a card AND points. It's a fair question.   And to clarify, I don't think NSW were the better team on the night."
rugbyunion,3bdxvz,dr_chim_richaldz,3,Sun Jun 28 09:43:02 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not saying it's okay, I'm saying that it wouldn't have changed who won the match, albeit maybe the scoreline. I just think people are using this as a way to cope with the lose and getting over the yellow card.   I should have phrased what I meant in my post before a bit better too - I meant that I don't think it mattered and even if it did, despite this potentially deserving a card wouldn't have changed the result even if the pass wasn't forward."
rugbyunion,3bdxvz,fernta,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:48:39 2015 UTC,A game can go either way after one decision. Momentum is a funny thing. But ultimately the Highlanders played a smarter game and the Waratahs were a shadow of their usual selves. Hopefully this gives Australia more time to focus on the Wallabies tests and bond as a team.
rugbyunion,3bdxvz,dr_chim_richaldz,6,Sun Jun 28 09:56:52 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but I just think it's wrong to say ""ifs and buts"" when up until that point the Waratahs got quite a few decisions go their way and they single this out."
rugbyunion,3bdxvz,fernta,0,Sun Jun 28 09:59:57 2015 UTC,"The ones that bothered me were that one and the held tackle call. It's only consistency with refs that bothers me. But nothing can be done now, it's part of the story and I'm looking forward to the Wallabies season. Hurricanes have more than deserved the title this year in any case."
rugbyunion,3bdxvz,dr_chim_richaldz,2,Sun Jun 28 10:10:21 2015 UTC,"The tackle call was borderline, but I don't think there were hands on Aaron Smith (it was Aaron Smith, wasn't it?) when he got up. Not entirely sure, though.  I understand feeling hard done by by the decision regardless of which way it should have gone, but the issue is just the incessant whining about it post-match. Not you or anybody in particular, but it really didn't warrant the level of complaining it got."
rugbyunion,3bdxvz,fernta,0,Sun Jun 28 10:14:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah there has been a lot of whining. But that will die down. It would be hard for any supporter to accept that the Waratahs just didn't play that well. I would have been fine with the not held ruling if Phipps hadn't been pulled up for the same thing so strictly. Consistency is important to spectators. If a ref sucks at officiating a breakdown, for example, it's easier to watch when he sucks at ruling on both teams."
rugbyunion,3bdxvz,dr_chim_richaldz,8,Sun Jun 28 13:49:48 2015 UTC,That's incidental contact and you know it is. It's not a swinging arm. Get over it bud.
rugbyunion,3bdxvz,subjectverbagreement,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:35:03 2015 UTC,"Disagree there, intent doesn't matter as much as certain things like contesting the high ball can cause so many yellow cards even if not jumping, etc, isn't meant to deliberately hurt the other person."
rugbyunion,3bdxvz,fernta,3,Sun Jun 28 09:50:24 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, I just think this is more of a convenient still image that implies more forceful contact than there was. Naholo and Horne just kinda fell that way. I've watched the replay of that try a ton of times and if it was called a high tackle I wouldn't have a problem with it but that sort of contact to the head/face happens all the time and is ignored. There is a difference between this example and the Potgieter tackle. If Potgieter doesn't make that tackle and get a yellow, this image is not worth discussing and OP knows that."
rugbyunion,3bdxvz,subjectverbagreement,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:14:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agreed. I understand the calls were 50/50, but just the level of ""craig joubert sucks"" now is unwarranted."

rugbyunion,3bahqt,SquidgyGoat,6,Sat Jun 27 10:02:35 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing this means that Tolkin doesn't see Clever as a regular starter in the back row, and he wants the captain to be someone who is starting."
rugbyunion,3bahqt,TheNinjaWarrior,3,Sat Jun 27 10:18:10 2015 UTC,Exactly. Clever is getting on in his years but from the past tests from last year he's been great off the bench.
rugbyunion,3bahqt,BZH_JJM,2,Sat Jun 27 11:48:59 2015 UTC,"Considering that LaValla was tipped to be Clever's successor as captain, this adds weight to the rumor that he's leaving rugby to join the Marines after the World Cup.

rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Shadowing_Lemma,11,Sat Jun 27 07:57:04 2015 UTC,"The Saveas, NMS, and Broadhurst are getting all the attention with their carrying at the moment, but Conrad Smith is the man. Never a bad decision, and really makes that backline tick."

rugbyunion,3b9ojk,nick16961,4,Sat Jun 27 09:14:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it's just hard to believe really, watching a team year in year out play so frustratingly, despite being so good. They really turned it up a notch this year. I think it's the coaching."
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Shadowing_Lemma,3,Sat Jun 27 09:19:38 2015 UTC,"Has to be. They've identified the right way to play, making the best use of the players' skills. It's been a completely different team."

rugbyunion,3b9ojk,NZ_Salmon,6,Sat Jun 27 03:55:39 2015 UTC,God I love the Kiwi commentators
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,saviouroftheweak,3,Sat Jun 27 08:02:35 2015 UTC,Perenara has 11 tries this season?! That's insane for a halfback. Also these Hurricanes can score from anywhere - you can't afford to give them even an inch.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Shadowing_Lemma,2,Sat Jun 27 08:09:07 2015 UTC,I don't know if the AB selectors will be able to ignore his form. Milner-Skudder has been absolutely electric. May have a real chance to make the world cup squad.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,weakcoder,2,Sat Jun 27 08:09:57 2015 UTC,He's doing so well Smith and Barrett are continuously giving him the ball early so he can weave the magic. He's certainly  not just a finisher
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,NZ_Salmon,3,Sat Jun 27 08:20:35 2015 UTC,How the hell did the ref manage to miss a knock-on which was right under his nose?
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Speedbump_NZ,6,Sat Jun 27 08:11:13 2015 UTC,Shields. Love his work.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,plato44,3,Sat Jun 27 08:15:40 2015 UTC,He's been an animal at the breakdown.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Speedbump_NZ,4,Sat Jun 27 08:22:53 2015 UTC,Pretty damning statistic: NZ teams are 17-0 when hosting a semi-final.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Maddness53,2,Sat Jun 27 08:48:10 2015 UTC,"Which is why you have the ""conference"" system."
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,plato44,2,Sat Jun 27 08:50:26 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a shame really, especially as that statistic is naturally skewed when NZ teams have won Super Rugby 12 times.  EDIT: Also, I believe that the conference system is a joke, when the second and third strongest teams have to knock each other out in a preliminary semi-final."
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Jiffyrabbit,3,Sat Jun 27 09:05:48 2015 UTC,Mogg.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,plato44,3,Sat Jun 27 08:55:02 2015 UTC,He played for the Wallabies...once.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,jbarbz,4,Sat Jun 27 08:55:52 2015 UTC,Jessie mogg doing his best to stay out of the wallabies  (Thank god)
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,plato44,5,Sat Jun 27 08:56:20 2015 UTC,He wouldn't make the Scotland side.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Shadowing_Lemma,5,Sat Jun 27 08:57:59 2015 UTC,What a fucking rubbish decision. That's Pocock you cunt!
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,marmitechips,5,Sat Jun 27 09:05:08 2015 UTC,Neutral refs should be a prerequisite.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,harblstuff,3,Sat Jun 27 09:06:43 2015 UTC,The Savea boys are really up for this.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Shadowing_Lemma,3,Sat Jun 27 07:46:30 2015 UTC,DA BUS!!!!
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Paddybdd,3,Sat Jun 27 07:56:25 2015 UTC,"Just curious: Were that try awarded (edit: or were it awardable), would the TMO have still gone back to that incident?"
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,jbarbz,3,Sat Jun 27 08:04:18 2015 UTC,"Considering that he drew the ref's attention to it, I'd imagine so. ""The ball is grounded on the line, but I'd like you to look at..."""
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Shadowing_Lemma,3,Sat Jun 27 08:05:47 2015 UTC,He would have been away if not for that knock-on
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Holdthesaltplease,3,Sat Jun 27 08:13:29 2015 UTC,Looking forward to the new maul laws. The ripper never bound until he got to the back.  Though I wouldn't be complaining if the brumbies just scored. #salty
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,weakcoder,3,Sat Jun 27 08:40:22 2015 UTC,"It's happened a few times in this game. The man with the ball just hovers behind what are effectively blockers and the rest of the forwards stream past to set the bulk of the maul. The man with the ball then binds on at the back. Completely illegal, but if the ref doesn't ping it..."

rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Jiffyrabbit,3,Sat Jun 27 09:10:06 2015 UTC,How are you meant to stop that Hurricanes attack
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,saviouroftheweak,3,Sat Jun 27 09:10:23 2015 UTC,You have to outscore them at the other end
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,saviouroftheweak,3,Sat Jun 27 09:12:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that's game.  I guess that travelling halfway across the globe twice in two weeks took its toll on the Brumbies - they didn't seem like the same team this week.  Mogg definitely seemed like he wanted next week off though."
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Holdthesaltplease,3,Sat Jun 27 09:11:48 2015 UTC,Brumbies backline are in the pub right now
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,offwithdafairies,3,Sat Jun 27 09:15:26 2015 UTC,Haha Stephen Moore confirming anyone playing the Tahs has his support
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,JoshH21,4,Sat Jun 27 09:23:26 2015 UTC,Can't stand Justin Marshall. His voice just fucks me right off.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Paddybdd,2,Sat Jun 27 08:44:57 2015 UTC,I'd rather him than listening to the Aussie commentators.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,marmitechips,3,Sat Jun 27 09:03:14 2015 UTC,GO THE CANES!!  Don't let the Aussies win
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,jeffrey2ks,4,Sat Jun 27 07:43:55 2015 UTC,I reckon that was a bit rough on Pocock there.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,marmitechips,2,Sat Jun 27 09:04:32 2015 UTC,"Flaired up for the Canes for tonight, and hopefully next week too.  We've got an exciting and nerve-wracking couple of games of Super Rugby tonight!"

rugbyunion,3b9ojk,BlackYosh,2,Sat Jun 27 04:28:16 2015 UTC,Bloody hell the Canes play some exciting footy.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,harblstuff,2,Sat Jun 27 07:39:40 2015 UTC,That's 4 tries dropped now!
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,BlackYosh,2,Sat Jun 27 07:50:56 2015 UTC,Difference between NH & SH:  NH: 4 dropped balls SH: 4 dropped tries  At least the rugby's been very entertaining so far.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,pizzalord_,2,Sat Jun 27 07:52:34 2015 UTC,I seriously hope these early mistakes won't cost the Hurricanes the game.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,WobsJack,2,Sat Jun 27 07:51:17 2015 UTC,"Not often you see a sold out [edit: large] stadium in SH rugby, it's brilliant - the crowd are loud as fuck!"

rugbyunion,3b9ojk,WobsJack,2,Sat Jun 27 07:57:29 2015 UTC,thank the fucking lord
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Shadowing_Lemma,2,Sat Jun 27 07:56:42 2015 UTC,Great try.  But the length of some of these advantages are absolutely ridiculous. I think they really need to standardise it somehow.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Shiny59,2,Sat Jun 27 07:57:27 2015 UTC,He called a 2nd advantage half way through that for another off side
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,FurryCrew,2,Sat Jun 27 07:58:30 2015 UTC,Really? Fair enough. Didn't hear it.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,reggie_007,2,Sat Jun 27 07:59:24 2015 UTC,"Great hands from Nonu to give Savea the extra space and time to get through White, and in."
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,marmitechips,2,Sat Jun 27 07:57:52 2015 UTC,well atleast he gave it a shot but tackling Savea that close to the line at that speed just isnt gonna happen
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,lagbort,2,Sat Jun 27 07:59:01 2015 UTC,Don't kick to this back 3 without chaser ffs.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,ChristianMB1,2,Sat Jun 27 08:00:30 2015 UTC,Weak penalty.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,lagbort,2,Sat Jun 27 08:02:45 2015 UTC,TJ!!

rugbyunion,3b9ojk,fernta,2,Sat Jun 27 08:08:58 2015 UTC,Wow what a try this Brumbies defense is getting torn apart.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Paddybdd,2,Sat Jun 27 08:09:38 2015 UTC,"F*cking Sky Go, drops out mid movement..."
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,pizzalord_,2,Sat Jun 27 08:19:17 2015 UTC,It'll run smooth as when they are showing a close up of some random kid in the crowd but as soon as there is a line break..

rugbyunion,3b9ojk,TheCassius88,2,Sat Jun 27 09:10:22 2015 UTC,Fellow Canes fans - One season without Hammett and they're (almost) in the finals. How the fuck did that dude keep his job so long? Boyd and Plumtree have done an amazing job turning shit around.   But I cant help but feel that Nonu's final SR season has something to do with this. I'm guessing he wants that final SH trophy in the cabinet before heading off to the wine country? Cant remember seeing him play like this at SR level.
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,ycnz,2,Sat Jun 27 09:17:03 2015 UTC,Good on the Brumbies for having a go after the whistle
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,Paddybdd,2,Sat Jun 27 09:18:43 2015 UTC,"What a game. Brumbies showed why they were the best defensive team, being able to hold out and not concede a billion tries in the opening stages (albeit with help from the Canes handling errors).  Canes just too good in the end, should make an exciting final either way."
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,nick16961,6,Sat Jun 27 09:26:09 2015 UTC,That booing has no place in Union

rugbyunion,3b9ojk,saviouroftheweak,2,Sat Jun 27 08:55:19 2015 UTC,At least Quade has positive impact sometimes. Mogg seems intent on having a week off next week.

rugbyunion,3b9ojk,DoctorClarke,7,Sat Jun 27 07:13:21 2015 UTC,It's Savea from 5 yards
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,pizzalord_,3,Sat Jun 27 07:57:39 2015 UTC,If anything the question is why was White left by himself to defend the end of the line against Savea?
rugbyunion,3b9ojk,bearlegion,5,Sat Jun 27 07:58:35 2015 UTC,Pretty tough to stop Savea from that distance - he's run over much better tacklers before.

rugbyunion,3b7myv,fettsack,5,Fri Jun 26 17:11:50 2015 UTC,"Considering the 12% bodyfat, 1.5xbody weight is pretty reasonable. The majority of their weight should be muscle."

rugbyunion,3b7myv,vatothe0,4,Fri Jun 26 23:11:40 2015 UTC,That seems a bit heavy of a bw for an international level prop. Probably closer to 120kg.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,vatothe0,14,Fri Jun 26 18:48:39 2015 UTC,Sheridan can bench 225. I can quite believe that many props are hitting the 180 mark. There's a Scrum V clip with Adam Jones where he talks about the fact that a lot of the young guys are powerlifters now that can lift you off the ball if you don't have correct technique.

rugbyunion,3b7myv,amplebooty,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:42:24 2015 UTC,He means the weight of the prop not what they are lifting. A 200kg prop would scare the hell out of the opposition though.

rugbyunion,3b7myv,amplebooty,4,Mon Jun 29 11:07:38 2015 UTC,"Can't see it's too common to be honest. Taking someone like Tendai for South Africa, he's about 115kg and presses about 155kg. He's hardly an under strength prop, (though admittedly, not the biggest on the world)."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,elljaysa,14,Fri Jun 26 19:20:25 2015 UTC,"Bench looks about right, squat seems a bit low"
rugbyunion,3b7myv,KPATB,15,Fri Jun 26 18:10:49 2015 UTC,"Considering they don't squat full depth generally it is a bit low, that's not a criticism, quarter squats are sport specific for them. Bench may be a bit high in my opinion, can't see that many 120kg props benching 180kg! That's massive."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,PatLook,6,Fri Jun 26 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah know what you mean, not really necessary for them to go full depth with the squat.   I'd say the average prop weighs in the 110-115 region. 120 is big and anything over 130 is monstrous. But I reckon a 120 prop would bench 180"
rugbyunion,3b7myv,KPATB,3,Fri Jun 26 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's hard to tell just by looking I guess, such as Dan Cole is around 120kg but doesn't look like a beast but you never know!"
rugbyunion,3b7myv,PatLook,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:30:10 2015 UTC,Why do they not need to full squat/why is a quarter squat ok or better for rugby?
rugbyunion,3b7myv,ElusiveCamel,3,Sat Jun 27 08:35:22 2015 UTC,"Full squats do have their place, but there's rarely, if ever, a moment in a game when you're in a full squat position. Where as  quarter squat has loads of crossover, slight bend before you tackle or ruck over then explode upwards is a quarter squat movement, so just more sport specific for rugby."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,PatLook,2,Sat Jun 27 08:39:02 2015 UTC,"What you say about the quarter squat movements/positions makes sense, thanks. I would argue, however, that the usefulness of training full squats doesn't just apply to when you're in a full squat position. If anything it gives you more benefits and makes you more well rounded as an athlete than quarter squats."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,ElusiveCamel,2,Sat Jun 27 09:11:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I totally agree they do have their place in plenty of moments and will be used, I wasn't meaning they won't do them. I think they do most of their strength specific work on quarter squats so was thinking that's what the 1.8x BW would be, could be wrong though."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,PatLook,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:48:28 2015 UTC,"Nah, I reckon we're talking thighs parallel to the ground at least. At 1.8x bw squat should be do-able by top level props. Hell, I'm a 100kg flanker with dodgy knees and a back problem and I squat 1.7x bw."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,Shadowing_Lemma,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:23:18 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, in a lot of the videos I've seen they seem to focus on quarter squats for strength. Not to say many of they couldn't full depth squat 1.8x BW just thought judging by what I'd seen I thought they might be judging on quarter squats, or should I say not fully parallel squats, and I said that seemed a little low."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,PatLook,2,Sat Jun 27 16:22:31 2015 UTC,"Aye, I know where you're coming from. I use deep, parallel, half, and quarter squats variously in my training. And halves and quarters are definitely directly relevant for the front row. But in terms of relative weight, 1.8x bw is a bit light for quarter squats, IMO."

rugbyunion,3b7myv,EverythingIsByDesign,7,Fri Jun 26 20:48:41 2015 UTC,Normal for a 120kg guy? Think of how much they have to bench/ squat.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,some_sort_of_monkey,2,Fri Jun 26 23:16:48 2015 UTC,Anything up to 1.5bw bench and 2bw squat are considered the norm for elite athletes. If your 120kg and less than 15% body fat then your carrying a shit load of muscle.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,EverythingIsByDesign,4,Sat Jun 27 07:15:08 2015 UTC,When I tried out for a varsity soccer team their requirement was 8 laps of the track in 12 min. just as a cull point to reduce numbers. As a keeper I only ever made 3km in 12 min. I'd say the 3km in 12 min is doable but by no means fast. Especially for a professional athlete and not just kids coming out of high school after a lazy summer.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,thatcfkid,4,Sat Jun 27 00:07:52 2015 UTC,"I agree man, I'm surprised about the comments in the thread about it, I'm not that fit and although I usually run for distance I could probably do something around that if I tried do 3km rather than my usual run which is a bit over 11km.  But it's the weight which makes it absurd, they're 115kg at the very minimum, and are overall very strong besides that. They're so allrounded, even if they're big guys."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,fernta,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:27:10 2015 UTC,"That's a 4:05 km pace.  Or a 6:35 mile pace for about 2miles, for those of us in rugby-deprived regions."

He was a bit worried about hitting the squat requirement. ::Edit:: It may have been the bench requirement. It was a long time ago.   That about lines up with this graphic assuming a 250lb player.   He's on the RWC training squad."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,vatothe0,21,Fri Jun 26 18:44:28 2015 UTC,A player really shouldn't be required to lift a certain amount to make a team.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,Johnson96,11,Fri Jun 26 19:17:25 2015 UTC,"I can understand why they ask for it though, it's just another way of dissecting the rugby playing populace in manageable groups where you can properly assess them. Crude? Certainly, but perhaps a necessary evil."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,elljaysa,9,Fri Jun 26 19:24:44 2015 UTC,"Also, you can learn a lot about a player/person by telling them the requirements and seeing how they react.   Would you rather take a guy that squats 425 but says he'll never make it to 450, or a guy that was at 300 but worked their way up to 400?"

rugbyunion,3b7myv,BigDog98,2,Sun Jun 28 17:32:44 2015 UTC,I am a firm believer in a 2-3-4 base requirement.  This crap with the numeric are insane.  Forwards are required to hit 2/3/4 and backs 1/2/3.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,Rollingprobablecause,4,Fri Jun 26 22:25:04 2015 UTC,Not sure what you're talking about there
rugbyunion,3b7myv,vatothe0,2,Fri Jun 26 22:37:57 2015 UTC,Think it's no of plates per side of the bar for the various lifts.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,yimrsg,0,Fri Jun 26 22:55:58 2015 UTC,"That sounds pretty reasonable, especially if it's just ORM.   225, 315, 405 for a prop, 135, 225, 315 for a back."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,vatothe0,4,Fri Jun 26 23:09:55 2015 UTC,That really isnt reasonable if we are talking about the pros. All those forward numbers can be hit within 6 months of training assuming you are around the weight of a standard forward. The back weights can be hit by the average male within a few months of training.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,Darkmayday,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:33:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the sprint and distance time requirements are probably insane to compensate for it."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,O_oblivious,0,Sat Jun 27 03:05:20 2015 UTC,No one is saying this is all they should do - was merely pointing out a base requirement to get them in the door - it's a good way to weed out people.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,Rollingprobablecause,3,Sat Jun 27 11:05:13 2015 UTC,Playing uni rugby in Canada I think 2/3/4 is a good measure for REP WORK not 1rm. So 2/3/4 for sets of 3/5 for 5 reps.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,thatvulcanfucker,3,Sat Jun 27 02:53:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, 2/3/4 is a fitness goal that any reasonably athletic person can hit in 6-12 months (tops) weight training depending on body type, commitment, and practice load. For an international player? I would expect the standards are higher than 2/3/4."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,RugbyLock,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:40:55 2015 UTC,315 on a squat for a prop as a ORM? Bear minimum I would see as decent would be 5 reps if they're on the lighter end. Also those back numbers would be setting the bar really low.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,Polamora,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:37:11 2015 UTC,Possibly a ratio of bench press/squat/deadlift? Though I'm not sure either

rugbyunion,3b7myv,vatothe0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:53:22 2015 UTC,correct.  It's a baseline for use - I wasn't saying that this was all that was required - merely the minimum.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,Rollingprobablecause,2,Sat Jun 27 11:04:10 2015 UTC,I can do that though and I'd want world class props to lift more than me

rugbyunion,3b7myv,pufftaste,0,Fri Jun 26 21:23:40 2015 UTC,ehh...on a good day - this is more comparable to an OLB or a MLB in the NFL.  OLine would not survive a normal international rugby practice.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,Rollingprobablecause,5,Fri Jun 26 22:26:37 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the rugby player's endurance is unquestionably better but in a sprint the comparable position in NFL wins out mostly."

rugbyunion,3b7myv,vatothe0,10,Fri Jun 26 23:20:56 2015 UTC,That 3km time is incredible. I know fit runners that can't maintain a 4:15 per kay pace for that long.
rugbyunion,3b7myv,SomeBloke,2,Fri Jun 26 20:19:27 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest mate they're not very fit and probably not runners. That time is good considering the weight of these guys, otherwise anyone who actually runs as their sport should be able to smash that time apart."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,Honey-Badger,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:48:46 2015 UTC,"That's my point, that's a good time for an athlete who isn't training or built towards running. But even though every second person on here seems to be an above average runner who runs 4:15 a kay on their Long Slow Distance days, that's still a good speed for a runner even though it is over a short distance. And I maintain that fitness doesn't necessarily mean speed. I know a lot of guys that can quite happily finish a 90km Comrades Marathon but will average 5:00 a kay on a 5km time trial."
rugbyunion,3b7myv,SomeBloke,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:02:55 2015 UTC,25 min for a 5km run is an awful time. My dad is 70 and holds that pace for a 10km run and he is like shit at running even for his age.

rugbyunion,3b7myv,say-something-nice,2,Sat Jun 27 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"Fit doesn't always mean fast and if you consider that most average Joe runners will average 5:00 a Kay  then 4:15 is definitely quick, especially given the weight. If you can run a sub 40 ten Kay without being fit you're an exceptional athlete and should probably consider taking your running further."

rugbyunion,3b7myv,rugger62,2,Sat Jun 27 11:00:00 2015 UTC,I don't think that is what is being suggested here at all; these are just guidelines for what someone playing prop (at international level) should be aiming for.

I know in my case, it's our national sport but because we don't really compete in much else that's all I have to get behind. Cricket I can try but it's just not there.  Edit: rowing, running, cycling and shot put are odd things we can get behind but the nation will only notice it when the Olympics are on.   Sadly when we beat everyone in rugby we hear ""Oh well nobody cares about the sport except for you, Wales and maybe South Africa depending on the year"". But when we lose it's smug smug smug ""Oh how the mighty have fallen""  from people who would claim they don't care.

rugbyunion,3b8rvt,elljaysa,5,Sat Jun 27 08:12:29 2015 UTC,"Well, careful there... I didn't say SA TV Revenue. Just Television revenue.  The $$$ comes from Supersports who are South African, but the revenue mostly comes from Supersport's distribution model, which is far larger than the South African viewer base.  If Super Rugby could be engineered where Supersport could retain their rights to it (they can't because of agreement with Fox) then you can bet they wouldn't give a shit if a single South African team was in the comp."
rugbyunion,3b8rvt,DoctorDbx,7,Sat Jun 27 08:20:36 2015 UTC,"The money comes disproportionately from SA though, to compound it, if you remove the SA games, you're left with a competition played at 7am for Europe, again, not premium sport for a huge rugby-loving NH market.   Rightly or wrongly, until significant development takes place in the FE or the game grows significantly in Aus, the tractor oil adverts and agro-product logo placements aren't going to bring in the bank SANZAR  unions are looking for."
rugbyunion,3b8rvt,elljaysa,5,Sat Jun 27 08:26:13 2015 UTC,"No, it is not hurting the game. Yes, it may be hurting the Super Rugby tournament.  Ultimately more South African rugby players will experience a high level of rugby play if our talent is spread between Europe and the Southern Hemisphere.  This can only be good for South African rugby players.  Super Rugby may become a development tournament for European cherry picking, but who are we to force a player to make a decision between their family's welfare and national pride? The permanent body and mental damage potential is too great."

rugbyunion,3b8rvt,bobwinters,2,Sat Jun 27 22:38:57 2015 UTC,I can very much see them being another England   They pretty much are though. They just generally do the running rugby a bit better (changes around from time to time) and have fresher/more destructive forward players making their forward orientated game more effective in internationals.

rugbyunion,3b8rvt,dr_chim_richaldz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:03:12 2015 UTC,In my opinion the reason to only select national team players from your domestic comp is to strengthen your domestic cup and continue to build grass roots support of the game. This is the long game to a stronger national side and future successes.  This is far more important in Australia where the ever growing AFL is looming menacingly over the game than I imagine it is in SA where rugby is s religion.

rugbyunion,3baqdm,batzman,10,Sat Jun 27 12:08:05 2015 UTC,"Brumbies and it's not even close.    The Waratahs are unlikeable.  Latu got himself suspended for 4 weeks, and in his first game back, he throws a blatant punch at Elliot Dixon at like 68:30 on the game clock.  Skelton throws his weight around all game, every game.  Cheika goes and has a chat to the ref because he's shit scared that his championship team will lose to the bottom of the table Blues.  The Tahs have had the refs in their pocket at every home game this season, and the first time the ref really starts penalising them (tonight), they all suffer complete meltdowns and start playing like rubbish.  And then there was the whole Beale/Patston saga.  I don't hold anything against the Waratahs supporters though.  Not even any of the salty comments or anything.  If you grew up a Waratahs supporter then that's your team and you stand by them.  But I just can't objectively see how any neutral fan can like this Waratahs team."
rugbyunion,3baqdm,marmitechips,3,Sat Jun 27 12:50:00 2015 UTC,"Fair enough on the Latu thing, but The Blues incident was Cheika asking about rule interpretation on clearing a scrum (which sparked a subsequent thread on the rule itself). This was something that happened as the last play of the half, furthermore he did it in front of 2 other officials. People will create their own narrative because of Cheika's history with the coach box glass.   The Patston incident is something nobody knows the full story to. One that involved more players than just Beale but it was put to bed before it got out of hand and Beale took the entire wrap. It's easy to throw Kurtley under the bus because of his volatile history but if you think that story was as black and white as the paper made it out to be, you're wrong.   Oh and I support every Australian team over any international. Would happily have got behind the Brumbies if they made it."
rugbyunion,3baqdm,dr_chim_richaldz,2,Sat Jun 27 13:36:58 2015 UTC,Cheika probably should have received a ban for that and there was a definite change of penalties something like an additional 8 from memory.
rugbyunion,3baqdm,batzman,2,Sat Jun 27 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"Cheika would have received a ban if what he did was anything more than a question about clearance. All 3 match officials were there, and Cheika, knowing it could get him into strife, wouldn't have risked such a move unless it was harmless in nature. That whole issue was such a non-story. The subsequent increase in penalties in that game were justified. The Blues were out on their feet by full-time and they made silly infringements. It was purely exhaustion and pressure.   I'm aware the Tahs are well-disliked, but people need to think about these things with a level head. We all try to make villains and heroes out of the coaches/players/officials, but they're just people like you or I doing a job and playing a game. Putting black marks against names for thing like speaking to a ref at half-time is just unnecessary controversy in the game, and would only be pursued by those intent on trying to ruin the career's of others.   Count me interested when it's bribery, cheating or foul-play."

rugbyunion,3baqdm,batzman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:35:54 2015 UTC,I think technically what he did might be against the rules but it didn't occur in such a way that the ref felt victimised enough to proceed in having a coach fired.

Fantastic tries as well - people often compare him to Lomu but I'd argue that Savea is a more complete player for a distance. Lomu may have impacted the game more through his World Cup exploits but Savea is a sheer machine.
rugbyunion,3b6dh9,iinventedthenight,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:24:53 2015 UTC,I would definetely argue that he is better than Lomu. Hard to compare though because Lomu was so much bigger than everyone else during his era
rugbyunion,3b6dh9,creep38,5,Fri Jun 26 14:28:24 2015 UTC,Cory Jane seems instrumental in many of these tries - where was he in 2014?
rugbyunion,3b6dh9,gabed-em,5,Fri Jun 26 19:23:22 2015 UTC,Nonu has gifted him a few as well
rugbyunion,3b6dh9,jamiroq,3,Fri Jun 26 21:41:32 2015 UTC,"The typical all blacks back three for the last few years has been Ben Smith, Israel Dagg and Savea so Cory Jane has only come in for injuries"

rugbyunion,3b3lz9,some_sort_of_monkey,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:19:32 2015 UTC,"Not anymore I think, when they're both fit Burleigh has been picked ahead of Strauss, but because Burleigh's been moved to 10 and Solomons refuses to pick Scott at 12, Strauss has been getting games."
rugbyunion,3b3lz9,LothianNumpty,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:27:21 2015 UTC,"To be fair to Solly, Matt Scott's barely been available this season and when he was, we were struggling to find a 13 because Burleigh was carrying an injury at the start of the season. Strauss might not do too much in attack, but he's probably the most solid defensive 12 we have."
rugbyunion,3b3lz9,supermackie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:31:40 2015 UTC,"Strauss might not do too much in attack, but he's probably the most solid defensive 12 we have.   I'm going to be honest, the worst defensive mistakes I remember from this season (like the one against Gloucester in the final) were with Strauss at 12, we definitely didn't lose anything in defence with Burleigh there."
rugbyunion,3b3lz9,LothianNumpty,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:03:08 2015 UTC,"True, I can't argue too much with that one! He lacks the pace of the others. I personally prefer Burleigh as well, but I can see why Solomons would pick Strauss in those positions. My first choice centers would be Scott at 12, Burleigh at 13 with Tonksy playing at 10."
rugbyunion,3b3lz9,supermackie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:30:05 2015 UTC,"13 is the real issue. I'd have Tonks/Scott/Beard with Burleigh on the bench covering 10/12. I'd have liked Fife to get games at 13 because I think he'd be good there, but that doesn't seem to be happening, so my hopes rest on Dean coming good this season."
rugbyunion,3b3lz9,LothianNumpty,0,Fri Jun 26 11:34:49 2015 UTC,"He played quite a bit at 10, probably not the answer long term but has a nice kicking game"
rugbyunion,3b3lz9,EverythingIsByDesign,6,Thu Jun 25 23:54:47 2015 UTC,"This is a good example of what not to do at full-back, always tackle somebody! Even if the guy has off-loaded, take him out of the phase. Jordan Williams leaves Phil Burleigh and because he is still on his feet (and still part of play) he ends up scoring the try."

I booked flights to Wellington for next weekend a month or so ago as an educated guess.  If the Canes do pull through, looks like I'll need to be quick to get tickets to the final.  Is it ticketdirect.co.nz for Hurricanes tickets?"
rugbyunion,3b4yea,Pinstripe819,7,Fri Jun 26 00:30:12 2015 UTC,No he's that bad. Bad enough that they put him on the wing and he's still useless in defence.  If you go about comparing him to other inside centres in defence it just doesn't work. They are practically playing different positions even though they wear the same number on their back.   He needs to address his tackling just like Quade did.
rugbyunion,3b4yea,It_Is_Known,5,Fri Jun 26 01:04:45 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. If you had to run at any active wallaby, springbok or all black you'd pick Beale any day of the week."

rugbyunion,3b4yea,cynic_male,2,Fri Jun 26 08:29:41 2015 UTC,That is the debatable point.
rugbyunion,3b4yea,reddititis,2,Fri Jun 26 10:20:06 2015 UTC,"I remember once that either Grant Fox or Andrew Mertens said in an interview that it was not their job to commit to a tackle unless they were the last line of defense.  Their job was to slow down the runner and let the forwards bring the man down.  Their they job was to stay on their feet, follow the run of play, be ready for the turnover ball and when it was presented get the ball downfield by either kicking or passing to the best person who was in space.  I've got a feeling that it may have been Merts because Lomu scored a hell of a lot of tries from Merts passes and Daryl Gibson (Tah's assistant coach) played outside Merts at the Crusaders"

He's a ferocious tackler and very good at positioning in the line or behind it. Go watch a few highlanders games and see how many fielding kicks ended up going straight down his throat. The fact that he slots into sweeper over Bin shows how much the highlanders' management thinks of his kicking."

If there ever comes a day in which NZ aren't a power house in the competition, it will equally favour them. But for now, it's trying to keep players in their home countries, fans in the stadiums, and spectators watching at home. It as much affects the international Rugby teams and games. If fans become disinterested in their local team, it doesn't bode well for the start of the International season. And while NZ love winning, it's much less fun to watch if it's not competitive from both sides."

rugbyunion,3b2t6x,amplebooty,4,Thu Jun 25 14:44:22 2015 UTC,"Good player, surprised he hasn't been capped yet. I'd pick him ahead of Haskell"
rugbyunion,3b2t6x,KPATB,3,Thu Jun 25 15:03:39 2015 UTC,Haskell has like 50 caps though and has been in form for the premiership so he's a bit hard to drop. Ewers/Itoje should definitely get a look in at 6 in the near future.
rugbyunion,3b2t6x,toughmint,3,Thu Jun 25 15:07:18 2015 UTC,If possible I would prefer Itoje to remain lock because then if Itoje and Launch were playing we would have 5 back row players in our pack...which is always helpful.
rugbyunion,3b2t6x,muelindustries,6,Thu Jun 25 15:22:20 2015 UTC,"Thing is Courtney Lawes and Launchbury work really well and should do for a while. Itoje works well as a 6, he's a big strong, atheltic player as well as intelligent. He'd also make a great lineout option and help maintain ruck speed. Plus he's pretty quick and could work well in the loose."
rugbyunion,3b2t6x,toughmint,3,Thu Jun 25 15:42:26 2015 UTC,this problem makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside!
rugbyunion,3b2t6x,toughmint,0,Thu Jun 25 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"No do not get me wrong, I  know he would make an excellent 6 and I'm not throwing Lawes out of the pack either. But just imagine a back row in the years to come of 4 - Launchbury, 5 - Itoje, 6 - Ewers, 7 - Clifford, 8 - Vunipola. That's my end goal here."
rugbyunion,3b2t6x,KPATB,2,Thu Jun 25 17:00:55 2015 UTC,Lawes is only 26 remember and has 30+ caps on them. Itoje at 6 with Ewers/Morgan at 8 and Clifford at 7 is my preferred line up. Vunipola isn't the long term option for me. Could also see Sam Burgess getting a look in at 6 as well with his obvious attributes.
rugbyunion,3b2t6x,pipboon,5,Thu Jun 25 17:46:09 2015 UTC,"Whaaaat. How is Vunipola (being only 22) not a long term option? He was the only consistently good player we had this 6N. He's been outstanding for Saracens this year. He will be world class given time and more experience. Ewers is more a 6 for me. Also I'm not butting Lawes out, he's got another WC in him but that's a pretty formidable back 5."
rugbyunion,3b2t6x,wrecker59,0,Thu Jun 25 19:09:49 2015 UTC,"He's to slow in the back row to be effective against the best teams, his carries become turnover targets. I think with the quality of young back row forwards coming through, vunipola will struggle. Also I dont see a guy who's about 130kg going through a long career without much injury."
rugbyunion,3b2fqd,Shadowing_Lemma,8,Thu Jun 25 12:45:29 2015 UTC,"So after the world cup the following players risk not being picked:  Halfpenny Phillips Roberts North Jon Davies Paul James Hibbard Priestland Brad Davies  And if they move, potentially Cuthbert and Faletau?  I'm gonna call bullshit on this. There's a case for better alternatives to Phillips, James, Hibbard and Priestland coming through but like fuck do I see Gatland only choosing two of Roberts, North, Jon Davies, Halfpenny, Brad Davies, Cuthbert and Faletau. Gatland is talking out of his arse. What happens if more players move? Alun-Wyn Jones' central contract is up at the end of next season so he could move, too. I don't see him not being picked because he's in England.  Edit: I'm an idiot. Forgot players already contracted to clubs outside Wales when the law came in are exempt."
rugbyunion,3b2fqd,JustAWordOnAWall,7,Thu Jun 25 13:34:45 2015 UTC,The law didn't come into effect until 6 players had signed national dual contracts. Any player who was contracted outside Wales before then is exempt. Have a read of this.

rugbyunion,3b2fqd,Enyapxam,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:04:41 2015 UTC,Theres also a clause that makes players playing abroad exempt if there wasn't a competative offer on the table from the welsh pro teams.  Think Roberts is one who would have to be a wild card as there was a very competative offer from the blues but he chose harlequins instead. Can't see Gatland not picking him mind!

rugbyunion,3b2fqd,reddititis,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:08:31 2015 UTC,Its a tough one for Wales and its players.

rugbyunion,3b2fqd,JustAWordOnAWall,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:43:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I completely forgot players already contracted to teams outside Wales when the rule came in was exempt. Potentially means Priestland, Jamie and probably Faletau/Cuthbert are gonna be amongst these wildcards."
rugbyunion,3b2fqd,MiracleBalls10,3,Thu Jun 25 14:08:22 2015 UTC,"My gut feeling is that it will eventually prove unworkable.  In terms of money, it's a short career with no guarantees. Players will understandably take the best deal on offer. Even with WRU subsidy through dual contracts, the regions can't afford to compete with the likes of Toulon and Clermont. They can't even compete with the likes of mid table Aviva clubs like Harlequins or Wasps. The Scarlets already lose millions of pounds year after year, for example. To remain competitive, the Wales national squad needs at least 3 international standard players in every position. The WRU doesn't have the money to put 45+ players on dual contracts and the regions aren't strong enough businesses to sustain those sorts of numbers either. Besides, it would simply result in wage inflation and players will leave anyway.  In terms of playing standards, good players will want to play in the best competitions. Two regions (Blues and Dragons) have again failed to qualify for top level European rugby and will be offering potential squad members (yes, I'm talking about Mr Faletau) a game against Istanbul 3rds in the Mickey Mouse Cup in front of a bloke and a dog. In addition, the Pro 12 is the weakest of the three big European domestic competitions both in terms of finance and playing standard. The best players will leave to test themselves in better competitions with a better standard of rugby.  However, because so many current players are excluded, the pain will be deferred for a few years until the next generation of players want to leave. By then Gatland will probably be long gone. At the moment he can make short term promises from a position of relative safety. Given the political landscape, he has little choice but to do this anyway.  But there is a way to make this plan succeed: the regions must use the time to find a way to raise playing standards and drastically increase the amount of money that they generate. They must turn themselves into Toulon, Northampton, Bath and Leinster. They must be successful both on and off the field in order to support the model that they've campaigned to put in place. All four of them must. If they don't, either Gatland's Law goes away or the Welsh international side is dragged down by their failure. Personally, I'm betting that Gatland's Law goes away."

Personally, I'm betting that Gatland's Law goes away   I don't really see it being in place at the minute, there are so many loopholes and exemptions that the law is unworkable as Gatland would realistically never have to use his wildcards."
rugbyunion,3b2fqd,MiracleBalls10,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:04:42 2015 UTC,"I agree. The policy isn't really in place yet and seems designed not to have much impact for a number of years. Besides, the policy cannot be used until Wales have the player depth that allows them to set examples of the players that leave. Until then it's an empty threat. We cannot blame players for taking the best opportunity offered - this situation isn't of their making and they have little power to change the policy. If the worst happens to the national team, the blame will belong to those who designed and implemented an unworkable policy, not the players. Damaging the national team is PR suicide for any coach or region.  There are only three international teams that I can think of that implement similar policies with any sustained success: New Zealand who have the player depth to absorb the loss of top quality players and still remain the best team in the world; England who have the financial muscle to hold onto most of their players and also have competition for squad places; and Ireland who have joined-up thinking through a union run game, real regions attracting big crowds, tax breaks etc. It's clear that for Wales to succeed, they'll need much more money and many more top quality players.  Lewis seems to have had little influence since the coup. I get the impression that he's either on gardening leave or completely isolated and powerless. The regions already hold the whip hand and they'll succeed or fail on their own efforts. There are no more excuses. There is no one left for them to blame. The target for them is clear: they need to become successful both on and off the field before Welsh rugby capitulates to the increasing pressure from France and England."

rugbyunion,3azz5s,sm00thArsenal,9,Thu Jun 25 00:48:43 2015 UTC,"Its not really about conserving energy. Trying to sweep over and cover a man in so much space like that is extremely difficult, if the defender charges in to make the tackle 40 metres out the attacker could step him so easily its not funny, especially an agile player like Kolbe. The defender is doing everything pretty much right in keeping his feet moving, keeping his centre of gravity balanced and taking away space. Territory is pretty irrelevent in sevens so the idea is to concede ground down the length of the field while taking space from the width of the field. This should shepherd the player toward the touchline until he has no room and can't change direction, thats when you can initiate contact. It also serves to slow the attacker down which gives the defending team time to regroup.  The defenders positioning was always a little off though, he should be on the players hip but it looks like he weary of getting burnt off for pace so he tried to cheat ahead."
rugbyunion,3azz5s,cape7,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:20:30 2015 UTC,"10 should have made the tackle, ball carrier was up against the touch line.   great run, really, REALLY poor defence."

rugbyunion,3b2os8,Shadowing_Lemma,0,Fri Jun 26 10:12:46 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned this morning the app is an extention of the PC platform. But as with all social media, for it to become interesting you need to find your friends and start communicating. The users (Directorians) create the content and energy.   RWD has features based around what a Rugby player, club or team basically needs to communcate and share. We have sponsored a national under 18 team and met with the players to ask them what they want from a social media for Rugby. Their response was that both Twitter and Facebook were no longer interesting for them. Some features were developed with their feedback. However, it's the idea of Rugby's own global social network and resource that will draw people over extensive gimmicky features that aren't used or make the platform more complex.  Further, RWD has been created in the spirit of the great Rugby trip at grassroots level or simply a Rugby person that finds themselves in an unfamiliar city/town and needs to know where to watch rugby. Example: The trip committee throws a dart at the world for the next trip and it embeds itself in a town called Leiden in The Netherlands. That’ll do. So now to RWD to see which clubs there are for matches, which hotels are there and also which pubs. This is achieved by simply going to the Directory and using the map or by typing Leiden into the search engine. In one search everything you need is right there. You also know that the Hotels and Pubs in RWD actually sponsor and support Rugby."

When we started RWD we visited the RFU at Twickenham twice and later spoke with their Project Manager from IBM. They were initially wanting to use RWD as a white lable but since IBM became involved this has been put on hold."

rugbyunion,3b0gaw,bamadeo,2,Thu Jun 25 01:10:24 2015 UTC,"He's the kind of athletic specimen that can make us compete vs the likes of NZ, SA or AUS. Sure he's raw as hell, but his sheer his upside is incredible.  Terrible loss for us."
rugbyunion,3b0gaw,Crimson53,2,Thu Jun 25 03:13:13 2015 UTC,The world will miss seeing him play as well. Terrible luck for him.
rugbyunion,3b0gaw,Herreg,2,Fri Jun 26 09:13:24 2015 UTC,That's a huge blow for Argentina & seriously sad for such a promising young player like Montero
rugbyunion,3b0gaw,harblstuff,2,Wed Jun 24 23:55:13 2015 UTC,"He is one of the few strong attacking players in the Argentine squad. Imhoff, Tuculet and Sanchez are great but not enough.  Huge blow indeed."

rugbyunion,3b2bgz,AchDasIsInMienAugen,0,Fri Jun 26 08:15:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry I can't give you a recommendation, but I think your number 1 priority should be to fix your unfunctional feet instead of using a pair of boots that potentially can further facilitate your problem. In the long run it probably is alot easier to find a pair of boots if your feet are healthy.   I'd say your best bet would be to speak with your doc, maybe he knows some expert that can help you."
rugbyunion,3b2bgz,CraiziRyice,2,Thu Jun 25 19:42:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for responding. Unfortunately you can't fix flat feet something your born with. I have insoles for my day to day stuff but they don't fit into these boots.

rugbyunion,3b0xms,97Craters,23,Thu Jun 25 02:11:44 2015 UTC,I think winning a world cup on English soil while the whole planet has been laughing at our results for several years would be the frenchiest of performances.
rugbyunion,3b0xms,ConspicuousPineapple,4,Thu Jun 25 08:50:50 2015 UTC,Not sure I'd even be mad if you played good running rugby. On paper France has a team that should be getting to the Semi's at least.
rugbyunion,3b0xms,toughmint,2,Thu Jun 25 09:21:28 2015 UTC,I wouldn't class that as an upset. C'est la vie.

Obviously England will struggle to contain the likes of Gastón Mieres and Manuel Blengio, but if England can get some early points on the board and play tight, 10-man rugby to close out the game, they might just sneak through by the skin of their teeth."

rugbyunion,3b0xms,iinventedthenight,2,Thu Jun 25 10:28:41 2015 UTC,I don't think it happens in the QF if it does happen at all.  Ireland in the SF could be interesting what a time and place to get your first win against the AB's.  England and South Africa also present challenging obstacles if faced in elimination games.  Us too I guess.
rugbyunion,3b0xms,patkk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:53:37 2015 UTC,I think if we beat France in the pools then France will play New Zealand in Cardiff. Assuming no other upsets... in both pools.

rugbyunion,3b0xms,Grandmaster_flashes,29,Thu Jun 25 05:16:05 2015 UTC,they would never mention the 2003 WC again.   You realise literally the exact opposite would happen. Basking in former glories is inversely proportional to the quality of your current team.
rugbyunion,3b0xms,flyingflibertyjibbet,2,Thu Jun 25 05:28:43 2015 UTC,I don't know about that - I tend to hear my countrymen lament/tall poppy our team than say how good we were back in the late 90s.

rugbyunion,3b0xms,Nine-Foot-Banana,9,Thu Jun 25 03:39:44 2015 UTC,Wales is currently ranked higher than Australia - if you believe them the upset would be the other way.
rugbyunion,3b0xms,strewthcobber,2,Thu Jun 25 05:21:47 2015 UTC,"Not really, the rankings aren't really a good indicator. Australia is the better team."

Regular high level matches and a reorganization at grassroots."

rugbyunion,3b0xms,fettsack,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:20:36 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is that the US is playing Samoa and Japan in the Pacific Nations Cup this summer, plus a third PNC test, Australia, and Canada, with a game against Quins all before the WC.  I wouldn't rule out the US to pull an upset, given that this is probably the longest the team has ever been assembled and will have their best preparation yet."
rugbyunion,3b0xms,Jesus_is_my_flyhalf,2,Thu Jun 25 18:56:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put money on it, but i could see Tonga getting up over Argentina. Just looking over their pacific nations squad, their starting lineup is sneakily quite good. And of course, they did get up over France last time, but that was probably as much about them as it was about France being French."

rugbyunion,3b0xms,harblstuff,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:21:27 2015 UTC,Would have thought Ireland v France is pretty much 50/50 currently.  I suppose form goes out the window for France especially in a world cup.

rugbyunion,3aysv4,squeak37,9,Wed Jun 24 17:09:11 2015 UTC,He just wasn't up to it really. He totally fell apart towards the end of the season when the heat was really on. And he was only OK against Italy. And if Jackson was fit he would have probably played better in that game
rugbyunion,3aysv4,arsebiscuits1,3,Wed Jun 24 17:26:42 2015 UTC,"Kicking aside, I don't think Keatley's cause was helped playing alongside Williams for the last couple of games. Williams appeared under severe pressure also made some bad decisions, making things unpredictable and more rushed for Keatley, meanwhile Paddy looked good playing alongside Pienarr."

rugbyunion,3aysv4,0ffice_Zombie,3,Wed Jun 24 18:13:09 2015 UTC,Feel a little sorry for him but I think his consistency really let him down if he played like he did in his better games this season all the time he'd be in the sqaud.
rugbyunion,3aysv4,ShaneQful,2,Wed Jun 24 18:35:33 2015 UTC,Hanrahan barely even got any game time at 10 this year and I'd imagine at this point he would be favoured over Keatley.

rugbyunion,3aysv4,penny_whistle,3,Wed Jun 24 17:43:53 2015 UTC,I'm trying to make an effort to follow the other teams this year.   How are these selections shaping up? Anyone to watch out for?
rugbyunion,3aysv4,Foveaux,7,Wed Jun 24 22:28:26 2015 UTC,"For Ireland, Henshaw. Possibly Gilroy if he has a great next month or so."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,chief_boom,3,Wed Jun 24 23:16:53 2015 UTC,"Bit late with experimenting but would have liked to see Tommy Bowe playing centre with Henshaw. Payne just not clicking at centre atm, for both Ireland and Ulster. Way more effective at Fullback, and I would put Payne ahead of Rob Kearney atm.  Bowe is defensively solid, obviously got the pace and has amazing hands."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,balaclavabandit,2,Thu Jun 25 10:05:42 2015 UTC,"Imagine the lines Henshaw/Bowe would be cutting at centre. Especially with Murray/Sexton inside, could work well against bigger teams.   How would Bowe work out at 13 defensively? Payne would be an interesting option at fullback, kearney seems to be off pace/form recently at international level."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,penguin_bro,2,Thu Jun 25 14:45:15 2015 UTC,"He's slotted in at 13 a few times for Ulster before, can be very physical  and aggressive. Payne is a little more conservative but also a bit more reliable."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,balaclavabandit,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:00:44 2015 UTC,Could be interesting if he slotted in at 13 with Trimble on the wing. We'd have a physical backline with:  Murray  Sexton  Zebo  Henshaw  Bowe  Trimble  Payne
rugbyunion,3aysv4,PmMeAss,2,Thu Jun 25 20:06:05 2015 UTC,I love how they show the original clubs/ previous clubs they played for. Now I'm wondering if by Blackrock college and Old Wesley mean the schools or the club's.
rugbyunion,3aysv4,collidge,6,Wed Jun 24 16:43:30 2015 UTC,The clubs.  All the provincially contracted players are theoretically members of AIL clubs. They just never play for them.
rugbyunion,3aysv4,FiachB7,3,Wed Jun 24 17:53:46 2015 UTC,Why does Sean O'Brien have to say his club is UCD/Clontarf? Is Tullow not an eligible club?
rugbyunion,3aysv4,arsebiscuits1,2,Wed Jun 24 20:55:26 2015 UTC,It is about eligible professional players. Division 1A allows a max of 2 players line up in a team and they both cannot be forwards. 1B only allows 1 player line up for them.  I am not sure what the rule is with regards to lower leagues but I imagine professional players cannot  line out for them
rugbyunion,3aysv4,collidge,2,Wed Jun 24 21:23:49 2015 UTC,"Not 100% sure tbh, I know Seanie played with UCD for a couple of years while he was in the academy - there might be a question of being a member of a senior club (that is competing in the national league) which I dont think Tullow are. If I remember correctly Felix Jones had to transfer from Seapoint when he signed with Leinster even though he had been a lifelong member of the club at that point for this reason.  For the most part it's to do with recruitment and prestige for the club. BOD for example, he played u20s and for the Firsts for UCD, transferred to Blackrock for a season or two before coming back to UCD. He never played for Rock, basically had a photoshoot with them and probably picked up a few quid. He re-joined UCD and afaik is an honourary member."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,arsebiscuits1,3,Thu Jun 25 09:37:28 2015 UTC,For Fitzy it is the club
rugbyunion,3aysv4,PmMeAss,3,Wed Jun 24 16:44:55 2015 UTC,"The clubs. Blackrock College RFC is separate to the schools team, etc."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,harblstuff,2,Wed Jun 24 17:58:26 2015 UTC,"I know, but I'm not sure if he got recruited to Leinster from the senior schools team or from a club. Both of which being legitimate ways of getting signed in fairness."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,Johnson96,2,Wed Jun 24 23:04:19 2015 UTC,"Most players are recruited through the schools but they stop being a Blackrock College player once they leave school. If they choose to, they can remain a Blackrock College RFC player."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,mimo2,2,Wed Jun 24 23:14:16 2015 UTC,Racing Metro 92? I didn't realise he decided to stay...

rugbyunion,3aysv4,JayJay_Okocha_is_GOD,6,Wed Jun 24 17:43:53 2015 UTC,It is final but he's still a Racing player until his contract with the IRFU starts.
rugbyunion,3aysv4,killer-on-the-loose,2,Wed Jun 24 17:59:18 2015 UTC,"Best, Cronin, and Strauss are all names I know well. Anyone care to tell me how Herring's looking on? And on that note, anyone want to name a Hooker to be on the lookout for come World Cup time?"
rugbyunion,3aysv4,Holisticism,3,Wed Jun 24 22:38:39 2015 UTC,"Herring's a good player but he's fourth choice by a long way, really. He's probably a better thrower than any of the above but doesn't have anything like the loose game."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,arsebiscuits1,2,Wed Jun 24 23:15:51 2015 UTC,Think I'd take Herring as 3rd choice. If Strauss was in 11/12 form he'd probably be first choice but he just hasn't been the same since his surgery.
rugbyunion,3aysv4,squeak37,2,Thu Jun 25 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"He's struggled to put together five or six games since as he keeps getting injured. He was arguably Ireland's best hooker back then, but he's going to take a while to get back to that level, if he ever does."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,squeak37,2,Thu Jun 25 00:04:37 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Furlong get some decent game time in the warm ups, to prove himself at international. Very good scummager and has some decent 15 yard pace."

rugbyunion,3aysv4,arsebiscuits1,0,Wed Jun 24 23:22:18 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who thinks some of the Leinster boys are lucky Joe use to be their coach?
rugbyunion,3aysv4,silentgolem,11,Wed Jun 24 17:08:51 2015 UTC,I think the only lucky person to be in there over anyone from another province is Noel Reid over McCloskey.  Also are you naive enough to think he picks players just coz they play for Leinster? Grow up
rugbyunion,3aysv4,arsebiscuits1,15,Wed Jun 24 17:21:16 2015 UTC,"I think it certainly helps their cause that he knows them, has seen them training for Leinster previously and coming through the ranks."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,penguin_bro,3,Wed Jun 24 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"He know them and that's why he picked them. It's the world cup, he would be insane not to pick players he knows, and more importantly, players who know him. Keep in mind under Schmidt most of these lads won a pro 12 and/or European cups.   Under Matt O' Connor Leinster have been playing crap, but the simple fact is that when they played for Ireland they played better. One other thing is that a lot of these players wont get anywhere near the world cup. What Schmidt needs now is the training camp to have the team ethos that he had with Leinster. What better way than to bring in people already used to his methods? All of a sudden the guys from Munster/Ulster/Connaught are surrounded by people following Schmidt, and join in the Scmidt style quicker than if they outnumbered the Leinster lads by too much"
rugbyunion,3aysv4,phony54545,2,Wed Jun 24 23:12:35 2015 UTC,"Never thought of it that way, I suppose certainly those boys will create a great atmosphere working under Joe again and propel the boys who do get picked on."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,arsebiscuits1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:28:20 2015 UTC,"I really hope so. So far Joe has been doing well, creating a phenomenal team atmosphere, helped hugely by O' Connell. Speaking of O' Connell, our team atmosphere hinges on him atm. Every time something good happens he's there patting people on the back, something so few other captains do. Heaslip has been woeful for us as captain (including not leading the team for a lap around the pitch last home game of the season, a pretty basic thing teams do...), Best is good at it but bad with referees, Sexton...well we'll see how he does"
rugbyunion,3aysv4,Johnson96,5,Thu Jun 25 20:36:37 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna say Joe has made it his business to be very aware all members of the squads of all the provinces.   Do you have any concrete player-for-player swaps beyond McCloskey for Reid? This gripe re-emerges every time a squad is announced due to Leinster having a higher representation than other provinces, but the fact is that Leinster still have by far the greatest squad depth, particularly in the forwards, even if they aren't performing at the level they once were."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,Bean_Munch,4,Wed Jun 24 22:46:55 2015 UTC,Boss for literally anyone? Seriously though I think Schmidt is too good a coach to have a bias
rugbyunion,3aysv4,harblstuff,3,Wed Jun 24 22:58:25 2015 UTC,"I will admit Boss is not the best player, but what other Irish 9 would you have over him? Luke McGrath? Potential but inexperienced. Duncan Williams? Munster lads don't even rate him. Paul Marshall? Very average player, Boss offers slightly more. James Hart? Has fallen out of favour this season and it seems only the very best Exiles (ie Sexton) can nudge their way into the team  The only argument would be Cooney who had a fantastic second half of the season, but he is very inexperienced too"
rugbyunion,3aysv4,Clairineach,3,Wed Jun 24 23:11:19 2015 UTC,"It was fairly tongue in cheek, we are a tad strapped for quality nines at the moment, especially when compared to the back row or the wing."
rugbyunion,3aysv4,Clairineach,2,Thu Jun 25 01:28:22 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah didn't mean to sound like I was challenging you, just highlighting the lack of talent in the 9 position given the depth we have at others"

rugbyunion,3axxh5,FatherOf2,12,Wed Jun 24 11:43:12 2015 UTC,I agree that putting the 6N behind a pay wall would be very damaging to the game in Great Britain. As long as it means the BBC or ITV or whoever still pays plenty for the rights to the unions I don't have a problem with it.
rugbyunion,3axxh5,J0nShannow,4,Wed Jun 24 12:44:45 2015 UTC,"We have the same discussion in Ireland, the government wants to move to protect its status but the IRFU is completely against the government's move.   That said, the government can only protect Ireland matches."
rugbyunion,3axxh5,harblstuff,4,Wed Jun 24 13:29:49 2015 UTC,"Your unions business model is that the international game funds everything else (very simply put, I know there money coming from else where, international rugby is the Golden Goose however). The government putting it on a protected list, limits their ability to get the most money they can out of something as popular as the six nations."
rugbyunion,3axxh5,Enyapxam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:32:13 2015 UTC,Aren't most or even all tier 1 nations modelled like this?
rugbyunion,3axxh5,J0nShannow,2,Wed Jun 24 16:04:07 2015 UTC,"English rugby isn't like this.  Each team is a private enterprise, with Saracens being separate from wasps etc.   Each team makes their own money and funds themselves.  The rfu run the England intl side.  In Ireland, the irfu run and fund Ulster, leinster, connacht and Munster.  So the money from the ""golden goose"" that is international rugby will find the 4 tier one teams in the pro12.  At least that's my understanding."
rugbyunion,3axxh5,private_pants,4,Wed Jun 24 18:54:17 2015 UTC,I thought he meant that international rugby was the primary source of income for the IRFU while other nations got their funding from other sources.

Sky are overly dramatic and you have to listen to Stuart Barnes's verbal diarrhea. Also any game commentated on by Mark Robson is automatically ruined as he reels of his pre written puns and lines.  BBC coverage is devoid of any in depth analysis and seems to be so catered for the lowest common denominator. Scrum V has even gone down hill as an analysis show.

rugbyunion,3b0d1c,metompkin,11,Wed Jun 24 23:18:28 2015 UTC,"It's how many every the national coaches feel are appropriate. Some may want a larger player base for training drills, some may go for smaller squads because they're flying their players to international camps and want to save money and resources, some may feel they only have 40 decent players and not bother calling anyone else in, or the opposite and have a massive squad to reflect their depth.  The eventual tournament squads are capped at 31, but the training sides aren't in any way moderated by World Rugby, so you couldn't really cap them."
rugbyunion,3b0d1c,SquidgyGoat,6,Wed Jun 24 23:21:41 2015 UTC,It is interesting seeing the relative sizes:   Fiji: 53 (Also for Pacific nations cup) Namibia: 50 USA: 50 England: 50 Wales: 47 Scotland: 46 Ireland: 45 New Zealand 44 (41+3) (Also for Samoa test and Rugby Championship) Italy: 40 France: 36   The French squad seems really small and I am surprised by how big some of the smaller nations are (do they maybe have a harder time keeping track of their players and need to bring them all in to have a look?). Also surprised by the timings of some of them; it seems like Scotland and the rest of the Six Nations teams announced quite a while ago but Ireland just did theirs yesterday.  Not really sure where I was going with that.
rugbyunion,3b0d1c,some_sort_of_monkey,2,Wed Jun 24 23:38:21 2015 UTC,I wouldn't know exactly how to compare it to other European nations but the French team has very little time training together each year. The summer before the WC is a big exception so they want to use it as the World Cup squad. The 5 extra are here to cover injuries and it's likely that the coaches already have a the 31 names in mind.  In 2011 it was even a 32 man group until the last minute just waiting for the last minute updates on some injuries.
rugbyunion,3b0d1c,fettsack,3,Thu Jun 25 00:26:20 2015 UTC,"Aye, the French seem to view pre-WC training as a prolonged team-building phase, looking at establishing patterns, roles, and continuity without having to worry about switching players in-and-out. On the one hand, it means that if there are injury problems, the replacement will be completely out of the loop. On the other, the team should be united and very well drilled. Also, other countries like to look at fringe players in the national squad context to see how they react and plan for the future (and maybe find a WC bolter). France apparently don't give a toss about that. :)"
rugbyunion,3b0d1c,Shadowing_Lemma,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:38:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's it more or less. To be fair with the French system, if all 36 are fit at the start of training then those 5 extra should be enough to cover injuries.  At this stage they have one choice and they have to make the correct decision: either, like you said, plan for the future with a large group were everyone's readyfor the international stage. Or, like they've chosen: focus only on the coming challenge. The coaching staff will be different after the WC, so the calls, tactics etc. will be different anyway.  What we haven't quite considered in the mental approach for the players and I wouldn't claim that one's better than the other, just very different. In a large group you encourage players to put their arm up to be in the final squad. In a smaller group you give them the confidence that they will be part of the final squad and they can concentrate on the collective rather than the individual."
rugbyunion,3b0d1c,fettsack,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:12:31 2015 UTC,"The USA in particular is trying to sort out some newer players to see if they have what it takes to get named to the 31 man squad.

Many coaches believe that these training camps are great opportunities for promising younger players, who aren't ready for international rugby, to get a taste of the national team set up and training.    A few countries are more settled and simply want to focus their training efforts on the squad they know they're taking to the world cup, while some coaches genuinely don't know their best 31 yet and want to use the warm up games to make their final decisions."

Fairly unsurprising to see SHC at the top of the pile in fact anyone else probably would have been a shock.   Ben Toolis has really kicked on this year and I don't understand why he isn't in the Scotland squad.  Nearly everything I have seen/ heard about Visser this season has been fairly indifferent so surprising to see him at number three on the list; hopefully his move to Quins will be good for him.  WP Nel being so high up can only be good for Scotland as, especially now with Murray retiring, depth at tight head is always welcome.  Grant is a work horse who I think everyone wants to see pull on the dark blue one day but I looks like it isn't going to happen. Still good to see him putting in a shift for Edinburgh though. Surprised he is above Watson.  I know next to nothing about propping but everyone seems to be saying Dickinson is in the form of his life so I guess this makes sense.  Ross Ford seems to have improved his throwing (still not great but not awful) and is still fairly solid.  When I saw Bresler at the start of the season he didn't seem to be up to much but I guess has improved a bit since then?  Fife is good if unspectacular on the wing, would like to see more of Hoyland and Farndale next year (although Farndale isn't listed in the squad on the website). Oh and maybe Robbins.  Coman seemed to improve the team when ever he played but spent a lot of time injured so I guess that is why he isn't higher (still get him confused with Du Preez).  As for those not on the list a lot of the bigger names (Gilchrist, Scott, Denton etc) have spent most of the year either injured or on international duty. McInally was playing well at the end of the season but, again, was injured for most of it. A lot of the others either didn't get much game time or, in the case of people like Strauss, got lots but were fairly mediocre and did little with it.  Fair assessment?"

I wouldnt say kicked on, more came out of nowhere. Agree regarding his ommision from the WC squad   Nearly everything I have seen/ heard about Visser this season has been fairly indifferent so surprising to see him at number three on the list; hopefully his move to Quins will be good for him.   Dont understand his inclusion, hes been poor this season, partially due to our gameplan, but he also didnt look interested   WP Nel being so high up can only be good for Scotland as, especially now with Murray retiring, depth at tight head is always welcome.

Still good to see him putting in a shift for Edinburgh though. Surprised he is above Watson.   Agreed. Watson was out for a large chunk of the season though, and was our lynchpin during that time.   I know next to nothing about propping but everyone seems to be saying Dickinson is in the form of his life so I guess this makes sense.   After the last two seasons, Id have Dicko over any other loosehead around. Literally no weaknesses in his game anymore   Ross Ford seems to have improved his throwing (still not great but not awful) and is still fairly solid.   Fords throwings been immaculate, but then it always has been for embra, even when he was notorious for missed throws with Scotland. Gilchrist has run a watertight lineout for ages, and Toolis has continued it this season. For all his talk as a great lineout operator, I think Kellock and Ford just didnt seem to work together.   When I saw Bresler at the start of the season he didn't seem to be up to much but I guess has improved a bit since then?   Hes the enforcer lock weve been missing since Big Jim left years ago. Was carrying an injury off the back of a sooper rugby season, got better as time went by.   Fife is good if unspectacular on the wing, would like to see more of Hoyland and Farndale next year (although Farndale isn't listed in the squad on the website). Oh and maybe Robbins.   Fife has suffered from Solomans dirge of a gameplan like Visser. He gets very little opportunity ball in hand. He has however developed his kick chase game to great effect. Hes got the talent imo, his confidence is just a bit shot just now. Hoyland will get his opportunity, but hopefully once we begin to add a bit more running to our game because otherwise hes wasted. Its a shame about Farndale, who at one time looked to be the great white hope of scottish wingers, but Sollomans clearly doesnt rate him. No doubt hell end up at Glasgow down the line and be great for them.   Coman seemed to improve the team when ever he played but spent a lot of time injured so I guess that is why he isn't higher (still get him confused with Du Preez).   Coman silenced a lot of his critics this season. Hes not as flash as Du Preez, but his leadership was really evident when wasnt injured, and hes a safe, well rounded player, comfortable doing any backrow work asked of him.   As for those not on the list a lot of the bigger names (Gilchrist, Scott, Denton etc) have spent most of the year either injured or on international duty.

Will:    if they get out of their group, all bets are off  halfpenny stays fit and on the pitch they tend to finish competitions stronger than they start them (6N anyway) so the longer they stay in the better their chances become"
rugbyunion,3ax421,SquidgyGoat,19,Wed Jun 24 11:16:13 2015 UTC,Will: Halfpenny learns how to tackle without using his face as an implement.
rugbyunion,3ax421,night_dude,9,Wed Jun 24 11:45:56 2015 UTC,"Will:   The squad has almost three months together ahead of the two big games against England and Australia. The longer the squad is with Gatland, the better they get. Look at the last game/s of any recent campaign (Beating South Africa, beating Ireland and then Italy by 60, 30-3, the 2011 World Cup campaign). Once they've had a chance to gel, they should be in a position to play at their best. Have beaten England before, and I think beating South Africa actually removed any fear of playing Australia.  Gatland is smart, and has mentioned he's been holding things back gameplan-wise for the World Cup. Note how much wider we played in 2011 than the three years leading into it.  In Biggar and Webb, we have a half-back partnership as good as any in the world. Both are really proving themselves individually, and having played together for eight years now, know each other's game inside out. Hugely talented, hugely experienced, hugely settled XV. Halfpenny, Warburton, Roberts, North, Faletau, Alun Wyn, Jenkins, etc. All are both fantastic, and fantastic together. We also have  some very good young players such as Tyler Morgan, Hallam Amos, Eli Walker, Rhys Patchell and Matthew Morgan. Any one of them could easily be this year's Rhys Priestland and hit the form of their life under zero expectation.   Won't:   It is a very tough pool, and one mistake in any game (Even Uruguay if it gets tight) could cost us the pool. We've already lost Jonathan Davies. We could well have also already lost Samson Lee and Liam Williams. If those two fail to recover and we lose one more injury to a player likely to make the 31, and we're pretty much screwed. Going to have a job containing the England set-piece and the Australia breakdown. We've never won a World Cup before. This is a huge mental block, although could be used as motivation."

rugbyunion,3ax421,night_dude,5,Sat Jun 27 15:35:02 2015 UTC,"Not a threat, but the pool is so tight it could come down to points difference. In the last game of the Six Nations, Gareth Davies dropped an intercept as he was in under the posts. Italy then scored. That 14-point turnaround would have seen Wales win the Six Nations. One mistake even in less competitive games can change everything."
rugbyunion,3ax421,wn_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:23:55 2015 UTC,Very true. Thanks for explaining.
rugbyunion,3ax421,harblstuff,6,Sun Jun 28 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"Will   4 months of strength and conditioning training should see them perform better than they have done since 2011/2012. Gatland's success hinges on having the edge physically. Defensively good enough to remain within 1 score of any team in the world. Massively experience and settled squad with a strong spine of a team (AWJ, Warburton, Biggar, Roberts, Halfpenny);   Wont   Lineout will struggle and scrum may creak if Samson Lee doesn't get fit Reliant on overpowering teams. If they match us in the contact areas we lose. Unable to replace Lee, AWJ, Warburton, Faletau, Roberts or Scott Williams if they get injured"
rugbyunion,3ax421,fettsack,9,Wed Jun 24 11:18:44 2015 UTC,"Just like Ireland, in any case where I see things going Wales' (or Ireland's) way, the lack of experience of this competition at its highest level against SH competition will ultimately be their undoing. That is to say, if they manage to get out of the pool of death.   Edit: And unlike some, I can see Wales doing it - while Wales' record against Australia is not great, they can beat them and they can beat England in Twickers, it's Wales' to upset, it's Australia's and England's to lose. I'll be rooting for Wales and Fiji, not because I have anything against England or Australia, but I want to see a good, competitive group."

Halfpenny's goal kicking   Won't:   Lack of experience, I don't see them getting out of group A Lack of depth and even of bench Stuck with a unique gameplan: don't really adapt their game to the opposition (sometimes it's a strength)"

rugbyunion,3ax421,Dom24,2,Wed Jun 24 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to figure out what I meant, it's not quite coming back. Maybe lack of experience of big games. They've done great in high intensity games in the Six Nations but their only experience in the WC is a game won against Ireland that wasn't as good as now in the quarter final and fucking up a semi they should've won."
rugbyunion,3ax421,night_dude,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:14:58 2015 UTC,Warburton is not fit to nibble on the bread crumbs under Pocock's table. And Toby Falatau is no world beater. He's no Vermeulen/Reid/Vunipola.   Will: George North is on par with SH outside backs like Folau.

Wales can beat people on their day, but circumstances are really against them and they'd have to overcome the odds several times.   That said, Gatland has done a fantastic job at Wales and they might upset someone."
rugbyunion,3ax421,21Tauler,6,Wed Jun 24 07:00:37 2015 UTC,Will: Top their group combined with a few home games and they have a winnable route to the final.  Wont: Group of Death. Garland's inability to beat the SH teams.

Leigh Halfpenny If Liam Williams doesn't brainfart them out of a game Incredible defensive ability when they want to.   Reasons they won't   Liam Williams brainfarts them out of a game. Group of death Warrenball doesn't cut it when the other team can defend even more efficiently than you do."
rugbyunion,3ax421,reddititis,5,Wed Jun 24 14:54:00 2015 UTC,1282 - Never got over it.
rugbyunion,3ax421,ronnierosenthal,4,Wed Jun 24 18:09:32 2015 UTC,"Won't:   They have a very tough pool with 3 teams that have beaten them in the past. Australia and England will be very tough tests for them and Fiji in the past have scalped a surprise victory not too long ago. Gatland ball, whilst effective, is very predictible. They will struggle against well prepared sides who know how to deal with it. That said the recent Wales-Ireland 6N game disproves this theory. Meeting New Zealand in the knockouts should spell automatic defeat for them. The last time Wales beat New Zealand was in 1953 during the 1953/4 NZ tour. Their win record against NZ is 3-27 with NZ winning the last 26 games against Wales. Since 2010 the total scores between NZ and Wales has been 175 - 70. No ones record is very good against the All Blacks but Wales' record (along with Ireland) is one of the worst amongst other World Cup contenders.   Will:   For the most part, this World Cup is on their home ground. With games being played in the Millenium stadium, including one against the Hosts England (cheeky bastards), and with support on the doorstep for them, it will be as if they are playing home every game.  They played very well in the last World Cup reaching the semi-finals where, despite losing Warburton very early into the game against France, nearly managed to get into the final against New Zealand. Their team looks very impressive on paper: Strong forward pack, with a world class back 3, some of the best backs in the world. They will, and should, give any team they play a run for their money."

And Rhys Priestland is a liability, and Mike Phillips is a wanker (To put it mildly), but neither are thankfully in the starting XV anymore- Rhys Webb has as much spark as any scrum half in world rugby (He himself scored 19 tries last season).   Not quite sure why I've decided to tear into you. Sorry, I think. Maybe I'm just getting a few months ahead of myself."

rugbyunion,3ax7q8,professorzaius,0,Thu Jun 25 09:13:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree, someone deliberately trying to drive someone into the ground is inherently worse than someone losing control of a tackle and dropping them."
rugbyunion,3ax7q8,rugbyfiend,0,Thu Jun 25 09:35:02 2015 UTC,Not if the outcome is the same. The rules clearly states: A player must not tackle (or try to tackle) an opponent above the line of the shoulders even if the tackle starts below the line of the shoulders. A tackle around the opponent’s neck or head is dangerous play.

rugbyunion,3awk9l,sdre,8,Wed Jun 24 05:48:57 2015 UTC,"Well he's great defensively, not only does he have textbook tackling technique but his positioning is flawless. Hes very similar to Conrad Smith in that respect. Although hes not a great runner of the ball, he is a clever passer, he runs hard and straight and can throw a step out there every now and then, hes got a decent turn of pace in the midfield too. Again, a similar style to Conrad Smith although not near as polished. He also has a very handy boot on him and can kick goals if needs be.   The thing i like about him most is that he's calm and collected and makes the right decision more often than not. Hes not a guy that stands out, but if you pay attention, hes always in the right place and doing the right things"
rugbyunion,3awk9l,xxihostile,2,Wed Jun 24 06:12:43 2015 UTC,Totally agree. The landers rate him immensely as well.

That was just stupid meat head animilistic behavior. In other words it wasn't entirely necessary. When I'm playing and going to tackle someone far smaller than myself in a similar situation - I'm in complete control of what happens to whomever-has-ball-in-hand. It would've been easy to do a lighter tackle into touch. Promoting that behavior will turn him into a liability. Don't be surprised if causes penalties left right and centre later in his career. I see it so often. Clear precursor to a ape like douche bag on the field that'll cost his team down the road.  Feels like I'm being harsh but I have to stand by this stance.  Edit - great all the casual rugby fans flocking onto the sub because of increased news surrounding union who clearly don't play themselves.  I tell you, almost every team has that one guy who acts like every tackle has to be a death blow, it's this lack of discipline that leads to unnecessary penalties and even injuries. But hey that's cool right? Because nothing beats seeing the biggest guy tackle the smallest guy, demonstrating all that power. So cool. Actually no. If yall who are replying as if to save your life actually played rugby you'd know that attitude is just fuckin annoying. Especially  if you lose as a result from a meat head being overly aggressive and accumulating penalties.  And to reply to whoever, no I've never been tackled like that. But if I was I'd be a good sport about it, albeit thinking it was overkill.  If you guys want excessive force and the overly macho bs go over to league. Hell even they're trying to curb the idiotic behavior too.   Source - been on heap of teams since I was a kid where the most aggressive guy being the most reckless makes a good video once in a while but mostly costs the team."

If he doesn't play Wallabies + the Brumbies don't make the GF then in effect he's only missing 1 game.

De Jongh's legs went out from under him and Speight was pushing hard on the top, so naturally the momentum propelled them downward. No deliberate attempt for a tip tackle at all - I don't care if you say intention has no relevance - it should.  Have had a gut-full of this bullshit. (And I feel the same for your players, you, reading this comment). SANZAR will probably give him 15 games and he will be out of contention for the world cup.  Let's be honest - is everybody super-psyched about a card heavy world cup? I know I'm not.    I can assure you it will ruin many-a-game. Just wait. There will be unfairness, controversy and then on the back of a contentious decision your team will be out of the world cup."

rugbyunion,3at991,Mutant321,2,Tue Jun 23 23:15:18 2015 UTC,"Making hits like that is going to get him on the plane. He's definitely a more dynamic runner than Crotty but his defence was considered occasionally ropey. He is the incumbent #23 at the moment, able to cover centre and wing so it's up to the others to knock him off. SBW has been very off this season and Crotty is just a solid workhorse."

rugbyunion,3au6fl,ObiWanCobi,3,Wed Jun 24 19:59:52 2015 UTC,To be honest I think feketoa is overrated.

I have to disagree about POM being one of our best forwards of the last two years, Henry outshined him last year and he was quiet this year imho. Its a good predicament to have however."

Horne is a great finisher, great defender and while not express, has good pace for international wing play. Stirzaker will be the wallaby #9 within a few years. He's come on leaps & bounds, unlucky not to make the cut for the RWC2015 IMO. His form in this years superXV has been outstanding."

The position that holds the most doubt in the Wallabies. I wish someone would just get on with it and put him there. He has a decent kick, a good crash ball and extremely reliable defense."
rugbyunion,3au6fl,dr_chim_richaldz,4,Tue Jun 23 21:46:22 2015 UTC,He was moved from the centres because he wasn't particularly good there. He is much better on the wing.

In a scheme where that is the key responsibility, he is actually outstanding. In fact, that is where he plays most of the time in defence for the Waratahs.  He doesn't have some of the attacking nous of say, Giteau or Kuridrani. That doesn't mean he's ""not very good there"".  Players fit a system. For instance, in most systems, Beale is a bag of turds, tied in the middle. But Cheika's system turns him into a viable option."

He plays like an enforcer and annoys the shit out of any opposition as well as a great attacker and defender and a good kicking game

rugbyunion,3au6fl,Grealish,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:31:45 2015 UTC,He's a fairly unique winger. He is really dogged and has a great skill set and turn of pace although I would admit he may be a bit behind the other speedsters.  I am in no way saying he should be in the squad; I think a fully fit Bowe/Trimble is by far our best wing combination but I think he would be good nearly on the bench or for some of the 'easier' WC games
rugbyunion,3au6fl,Youscurvydawg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:28:00 2015 UTC,I will never understand how people think Zebo is a one trick pony. Best kick/pass/offload out of the Irish wingers.

rugbyunion,3au6fl,Youscurvydawg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:56:56 2015 UTC,"I said zero about running lines or defense. Doubt his defense is still suspect. Go look at his tackling vs Toulon last year. He can defend people just want to find faults in his game because he is a flashy player. Irish people like their sport stars to be the humble gentleman grafter type of person, not a cocky confident type of person who tries risky things and has a personality that you would not normally associate with Irish people. Just look at how divided the opinion on McGregor is in this country. Some love him, some hate him. I don't think its far fetched to say something similar is happening with Zebo."

rugbyunion,3au6fl,Johnson96,4,Wed Jun 24 14:08:12 2015 UTC,"Overrated: Rhys Webb. He's a good rugby player but his superb try scoring record masks his technical deficiencies and inconsistencies somewhat. He's significantly better now that he was 12 months ago, and may still improve, but his decision making deserts him at times and so does his passing. Then again I supposed Mikeys passing was a bit ropey on occasion but I let him off.  Underrated: Jamie Roberts. Has a reputation for being a one dimensional bosh merchant but there's so much more to his game than that. Immense physicality coupled with excellent reading of the game and intelligence has created a behemoth of a centre. He absolutely dominates the midfield and has trounced some really good partnerships in recent years. We'll miss him when he's gone"
rugbyunion,3au6fl,wn_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:26:37 2015 UTC,"Webby makes about as many mistakes as Phillips did, even in his prime, and his decision making is substantially better. I think he's the best scrum-half we've had in some time.  Totally agree on Roberts, too. Same goes for Jon Davies."
rugbyunion,3au6fl,SquidgyGoat,5,Tue Jun 23 19:59:47 2015 UTC,"Overrated - Tim Visser; hopefully a move south will get his dick out his arse. Underrated - Rob Harley, some engine and he's looking fitter and bigger from his  time off. Scary indeed. Wildcard - W P. I make my cheddar in a rugby pub in the capital, and it astounds me how few Scots are aware of this little saffy gem. Played a phenomenal amount of rugby last season and still kept the momentum going."
rugbyunion,3au6fl,Fartbelchfart,3,Wed Jun 24 15:01:50 2015 UTC,As a winger I feel the need to stand up for Visser a bit. Playing for Edinburgh over the last few seasons hasn't done him any favours especially due to Alan Solomons game plan which doesn't use him effectively. He is still defensively weak but not as bad as he was and when used right I think he is a net positive to the team. Also he was injured for a bit this season and last. I agree going to Quins is probably best for him to regain some form.  I don't think Rob Harley is underrated I think he would be most peoples starting 6.  Not sure about Nel. Haven't been able to see much of any of the Pro 12 this year. I have heard rumblings about him either being not good in the loose or the scrum (can't remember which normally not that interested in prop talk) but we do need more tight heads.
rugbyunion,3au6fl,some_sort_of_monkey,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:12:38 2015 UTC,"With regards to his scrummaging, at the tail end of the 2013-2014 season; playing Dragons at Rodney Parade. Edinburgh had a lock sinbinned and held out for several reset scrums on their own try line, at the death of a one score match. With regards to his work in the loose, he's scored more tries than Visser the last two seasons."
rugbyunion,3au6fl,craftycrifty,2,Tue Jun 23 22:04:24 2015 UTC,"I think the ""more tries than Visser"" thing is partial due to Visser being injured and away on international duty and partially due to Solomons system. But still sounds good."

rugbyunion,3au6fl,fettsack,7,Thu Jun 25 16:44:26 2015 UTC,"Under-rated: Chris Ashton. Yes his defense is suspect but he is very good at what he does, running very intelligent lines and scoring lots of tries. I actually think he could thrive with Ford at 10 and get back to the international form of 2011 when he was scoring tries for fun.  Over-rated:Alex Corbiserio. This may be controversial seeing as he was absolutely destructive in 2013 and brilliant. But from what I've seen since he has been injured he's a shadow of his former self. Trust me, there is very few things i'd rather have than a fully fit and in 2013 form Alex Corbiserio for England."
rugbyunion,3au6fl,captain_cabinets2,3,Thu Jun 25 17:24:53 2015 UTC,there is very few things i'd rather have than a fully fit Alex Corbiserio for England   I think this is the main issue. I don't think I've seen him properly fit since 2013. I think not playing regularly is one of the worst things that can happen to a prop because a lot of their technique starts to wane.  In the games I saw him play for Saints this season he looked extremely out of sorts in the scrum.
rugbyunion,3au6fl,OliverJonas,3,Tue Jun 23 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"Overrated: Jamie Roberts. Sure he's the defensive coordinator and offensive battering ram, but there's little variation to his game. We've seen in Nonu how a big, physical centre can still develop into a superb all-round player, but Dr. Bob doesn't look like doing that any time soon. Maybe this move to England will be good for his game.  Underrated: Dan Biggar. Organises the back-line superbly; a level-headed leader on the pitch; a fearless defender; an excellent attacking runner (re: Ospreys much more than Wales); a reliable kicker; an excellent tactical kicker; superb in the air. For my money, one of the best 10s in the world right now."

Coaches know what they're getting with Roberts and don't expect him to do anything else. Which is fine, but I just think he has the ability to be more than he currently is."
rugbyunion,3au6fl,Shadowing_Lemma,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:11:46 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with you with Jamie Roberts.  Wales game plan doesn't work without him and he was absolutely immense in the 6 nations, he is the next name on the team sheet after AWJ."
rugbyunion,3au6fl,Enyapxam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:21:39 2015 UTC,"I never said he wasn't an excellent player. Far from it. But I think he has the ability to be a more rounded player than he is, or displays, currently."
rugbyunion,3au6fl,Shadowing_Lemma,3,Wed Jun 24 07:11:00 2015 UTC,Don't mistake personal ability with playing rigidly to the system. Roberts has got a decent skill set but that's not his job on the way wales play. Same goes for halfpenny.
rugbyunion,3au6fl,Enyapxam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:25:39 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. Indeed, there have been flashes in games past where Roberts has actually demonstrated some ability with the boot, or deft hands. But while he has the ability, he doesn't use it often enough. It's not just a Wales issue, by the way - he plays the same way for clubs. You're right in that it's playing to a system, but Jamie has the rugby intelligence to know when the system isn't working. What he doesn't have is the alternate (i.e. 'rounded') game to do something different in such instances. I'm not talking about Jamie suddenly becoming a giant Shane, but, to hark back to Nonu, there are things a big centre can work on to keep the opposition on their toes and reduce predictability."
rugbyunion,3au6fl,Shadowing_Lemma,3,Wed Jun 24 09:07:51 2015 UTC,"I had to give this one a fair bit of thought. Also I didn't get to watch half as much Rugby this season as I wanted too. I want to say Underated - Danny Cipriani; I don't think his defence is as bad as people make out and kinda think people don't rate him cos he happens to be a big eejit off the pitch. Then I thought of young Josh Beaumont, but I don't think he's underated as much as he's not well known and more of a ""massive yet to reach his potential talent"" right now. Both Sale players, I'm sorry, and I've given up defending 36. So, my underated player is Tom Wood. He's not had his best season but he's as hard nosed as they come and I can't recall him really making a mistake in a game I've seen. One of those spine of the team players that people are a bit down on lately.   Overated - hate to say it, as I do like him, but Manu! When he was dropped people seemed to think our world cup was over before it began. JJ might not be a like for like replacement but he's the better 13 right now. Manu doesn't have brilliant pace and can be a bit crash bang (althought that often seems to work for him). Anyways I'm much more worried about the 12 shirt than the 13.... still."

rugbyunion,3au6fl,darthreallynasty,2,Wed Jun 24 03:44:26 2015 UTC,"Overrated: George North. He's got pace, power, agility and in theory hands, but there it all stops. What looks on paper like the complete package is actually lacking game awareness and any comprehension of defending. His tackling is poor (Aside from the odd huge hit), and his defensive positioning is amateur level. He showed signs of improvement in the Six Nations, but still lets far too many tries be scored down his wing, and rarely runs supporting lines. If he doesn't have the ball, he isn't bothered.  Underrated: Dan Biggar. He's starting to get the recognition he deserves, but Biggar is as good as any 10 in the world. His defence and kicking are obviously fantastic, but his passing is pretty sublime, and his attacking and running game have been of a high standard for a few years now, and are currently equal to that or more celebrated players such as Foley or even Sexton. He's also a hugely reliable team man, and someone who loves to pla every game with total commitment."

rugbyunion,3au6fl,professorzaius,4,Wed Jun 24 21:06:54 2015 UTC,"Overrated: Nehe-Milner-Skudder. Okay, okay, most people in the NH probably haven't heard of the kid, and he is fucking incredibly talented, but the way he's been rated at the moment by some of the public is just too much. He's played 1 year of Super Rugby and some people are already saying he should be in the ABs starting line-up. He's got a great offload and is extremely talented, but it's his first fucking year in the competition. Playing that sort of volatile style can work, but with inexperience mistakes will start to come in. You cannot make them in a WC playoffs match. I think he'll grow into a great player, but it's too early now for him to have this pressure on him.  Underrated: Maybe Nemani Nadolo or James Lowe. I genuinely thought if Nemani Nadolo was the form player of the comp in 2014, came in late and was top try scorer in the whole comp. This was 2014 Crusaders we're talking about. He's played well this year, and whilst he makes all the highlights he's still received 0 attention compared to the likes of Savea and Naholo. James Lowe I'd say is underrated, just because he's got a very well rounded style, and he always seems to break the gain line and make  little mistakes. He's not afraid to kick if he sees space, and he's done this to recover the ball and score. I just think he's a very talented player and compared to the attention Naholo has gotten, I really think he was not too different in skill compared to him."
rugbyunion,3au6fl,fernta,4,Thu Jun 25 09:19:03 2015 UTC,"Nadolo gets tons of press, he's just not an All Black so it's just Super Rugby press. Agree on James Lowe. And I think NMS could be the next Ben Smith, we need another year to see though."

Underrated: James Broadhurst. OK, so getting a spot in the AB training squad shows he clearly isn't underrated by the AB selectors but I have a feeling he isn't well known beyond these shores, and being a tight forward isn't talked about much in NZ. Hardest working lock in NZ this year and that's up against Retallick and Whitelock."
rugbyunion,3au6fl,assorti,3,Wed Jun 24 03:38:00 2015 UTC,"Kieran Read hasn't been bad for the Crusaders the last two years, but ever since he got concussed about 4 games into the Crusaders season last year and then again he just hasn't had that same spark he had back in 2013. I reckon he showed hints of his old skill back in that final Brumbies gane, and I'm hoping it'll come back in the later internationals.  Not saying this as a rabid Crusaders fanboy, I wouldn't use overrated but he just hasn't been the same."
rugbyunion,3au6fl,fernta,2,Tue Jun 23 17:44:02 2015 UTC,Read was amazing in the game vs Brumbies and I too wish it is just the beginning of him gettin back to 2013 form.

In fact numerous times it's been commented that he seemed to be shirking the hard work he used to excel at. Given the concussion issues, I can understand it taking some time to get the confidence and fitness back.  James Broadhurst has had a stellar season, rightly recognised with All Black squad selection. Genuinely the sort of steel the Hurricanes have needed in the forward pack."

Below might be helpful in the meantime, if you can't find a local club:  Good cardio & stamina - run, get smashed, get up and run, smash someone, trundle over to lineout, repeat.   Strength - particularly legs, but a strong core is always good, and shoulders take a lot of impact, so no harm in improving strength all over. Note, I don't necessarily mean bulk, obvs if you want to go ahead, but you shouldn't have to, there's a place for big and smaller players.  We do quite a bit of work to improve footwork I guess (not sure what to call it...changing direction quickly whilst running).  You could chuck a ball around with friends in the meantime, or go all Leigh Halfpenny kicking in free time (what at might be an issue!).  Watch lots of rugby - understanding the rules is (I think) not compulsory to start as you learn anyway, but useful as you already understand tactics.  I've been told by a couple coaches that things where you learn to use your body weight like wrestling are good. We've done some MMA training as a club, but I haven't done anything else (due to injuries from last season boo hiss).  As a ladies team we've had a couple players come over from hockey or football (soccer) teams (no girls rugby in schools), they learn rugby from scratch, but already have a lot of match stamina which is good, do maybe you can play another team sport for fitness and teamwork?"

Let's be juvenile and say you want some action, they're good positions. Outside of actual training your coach will provide I eat a very healthy high protein diet and I run everyday. I live by the shore line so I run along the beach then over rocky terrain which really helps with balance and side step, foot placement etc. Just get that fitness up and push your body to the extreme when it comes to movement. It's a machine, a self healing machine. It sends you discomfort signals, cool huh? Ignore them. Now go outside and go for a run. Run everyday. Everyday get a rugby ball and pass it around, even if no one is their to catch it. Run at the ball and pick it up quickly and pass on. Repeat. Kick the ball up and run after it and catch it. Make it awkward. Learn everything about the ball and what you can mentally do, given enough time your body will follow. Do as much of this till you actually join a team and you'll be well prepared for introductory training all decent clubs will give.  Most importantly.. have fun!"

I heard somewhere its a 5 km run at sprint speed spread over that time. If you're new, a coach isn't going to expect you to have skills, he'll be looking at your potential to develop skills and keep up with the game. Both of which require fitness.  There are a number of rugby focused workouts on the internet. I saw the All Blacks training program (different for different positions) a few years ago, you'll be able to find something similar.   I wouldn't bother trying to develop any skills, because I don't really see how you can realistically by yourself. Perhaps getting a ball and learning how to throw a lateral spiral pass (""rugby pass""). A nightmare if you can't find anybody to pass to (if only so they can throw it back), but if you don't, find a wall, mark a circle with a 50cm diameter and throw at that from both sides (don't allow a dominate side to develop). The most basic skill, which if you can't do, you can't play rugby."

rugbyunion,3atinz,some_sort_of_monkey,9,Tue Jun 23 16:49:17 2015 UTC,"As rugby union expands into the 21st century, its main ally will be the sponsors, and the sponsors will need to engage with a more active, vibrant and youthful (read: financially independent) audience. In order to successfully capitalise on this, it must aim at the current 9-14 age bracket, better known as ""tweens.""  By promoting the sport as ""rugger"", it ensures that it can be promoted & marketed to this attention-deficit audience, attracting them to the game and guaranteeing its survival. By helping promote ""rugger"" and even ""rugger sevens"" to a higher standing in the population's attention, these sponsors will continue funding high-level competitions, certain that there will be an audience to consume their product."

rugbyunion,3atinz,muelindustries,15,Tue Jun 23 13:29:09 2015 UTC,"The scrum was designed as a means of resetting the game. However, with time, it evolved into a legitimate weapon that teams would build their games around. It has become one of the most spectacular, celebrated parts of the game, and a personal favourite of forwards all over the world. Perhaps by classical means, the scrum is not functioning, but it now exists purely for one team or the other to win a penalty, hence upping the level of competition that lead to it becoming such a hit with fans and players alike in the post-war era. This, in turn, allows for a better game, as we are adding more and more elements that are purely competitive, rather than simply necessary."

If that is Australia we have a very good recent record against. If it is England or Wales these are both teams we have only narrowly lost to recently so we should be able to beat them especially as we will up our game to get revenge.  In the Semifinals it will probably be one of France, Ireland or Argentina. The arguments for Argentina are the same as for Australia above and for France the same as England and Wales. As for Ireland we had nothing left to play for against them in this years Six Nations and were carrying some injuries. The Irish will be lulled into a false sense of security and we will win.  For the final it is either one of the teams all ready mentioned or South Africa who we will have sussed out in the group stages and again given a false sense of security to or New Zealand, the perennial chokers who we ran close in the Autumn.  Add to this the confidence gained by the members of the squad from Glasgow who now know what it feels like to win something and the hunger the other players in the squad will have to feel the same way after having first hand experience of what it is like to know someone who has won a trophy and you can clearly see why not only can Scotland win the World Cup but they clearly should be favourites to do so."

And yet, despite this, whenever given an opportunity to play at the top level, has proved he is at least as good as any of the players listed. This is backed up by his resume. Whenever on form, he was the first name on the teamsheet for whomever he played for, and won two Grand Slams.

Additionally, with many calling for helmets to be removed form the NFL (http://www.reddit.com/r/superrugby/comments/3afnlj/interesting_that_american_football_might_get_rid/) Rugby union has the opportunity to embrace an American Icon, and further it's expansion in to a massive growth market."

Nothing about a release fee. Nothing about Quade wanting to see out his days in the Reds. Nothing about Quade wanting to play 7s. Nothing about talks being held with the Waratahs. Just ""we have an offer from Toulon"".  Meanwhile we get Jim Carmichael saying ""despite having spent a lot of money on Quade in seasons past, this apparently didn't matter when negotiating for seasons future, and the demands from his manager were unreasonable"". What are these unreasonable demands? For one of Rugby's highest paid players, even before the minted deal from Toulon, it couldn't solely be money and to me seems more like a 'toxicity' thing.  Thanks for the solid years at the Reds Quade, you've acquitted yourself well of the faith and funds we put into you. Jim Carmichael is a dickhead.  And FWIW, I used to think Quade was overrated and a bit of a wanker, but he has matured out of sight both on and off the field over the past 5 years. Kids want to be him, and woman want to be with him. He is a valuable player and a hugely marketable asset.  Meanwhile, the QRU has shown it is nothing more than an Old Boys club more interested in protecting their asses with bullshit committees and 'panel reviews' and reluctant to kick one of their failing old boys to the curb. They've completely lost touch with the fan base, and they're about to get a further kick in the financial pants when membership renewal comes around.  QRU are already financially hurting big time, because whilst they sold a boatload of season tickets (under false pretenses I might add, they said they were going to play Rugby this year), members not turning up means food and bev sales projections (money already spent) were much more than what was really taken.  Make no mistake. This year has been a financial disaster for the Reds, and next year will be much much worse. The remedy seems simple enough... replace the coach, keep the big names, trim the fat (non performing players... and yes this means JJ Tuilagi, Chris F. et al who have made zero impact) and focus on Rugby."
rugbyunion,3aupf8,anticsrugby,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"Slowclap  I think JJ might still be on contract and he's just been out injured. Let's see how he does again in the NRC - he was finally putting his body on the line in defense during the preseason/early season and honestly if JOC goes he's probably going to be one of, if not, our best option at fullback.  He's still only just turned 22 a few days ago and has an insane amount of upside on attack as long as he can manage to continue improving his defense like he appeared to be earlier this year - that was by far the biggest issue with his play up to that point."

The Reds have the most solid supporter base and poor leadership from up top has really fucked you guys.

rugbyunion,3apktf,HanaHonu,10,Mon Jun 22 15:48:42 2015 UTC,"Depends on the age level.   My 4-5 year olds are really only working on run forward, pass backwards. So if their flag is pulled, they stop, turn, and pass.  The older groups work things like scrums into the mix.   I guess the biggest difference is that when you pull a flag, you have to allow the person whose flag you pulled to turn and pass the ball before you can hand them your flag back. And you have to hand the flag back before you can enter play again."

We are told by sources from the club that a center is the absolute priority but we are now given the hint that maybe we won't sign anyone in the backs this year. And despite I believe the guys coming from the SH will do us a lot of good, and substitute Parling and Salvi pretty well, we still lack a X-Factor in a lot of areas. This is the first time that I have felt a real decline in the club. Before, after patchy seasons I will think it was just a bump in the road.

Tana did a fantastic job with Counties, his record at Toulon is obviously solid, and it'll be exciting to see what he can do at the Blues.  Obviously there was excitement when JK was first picked as coach, but I don't believe this is another former-player-hype-train-JK-type situation. Although previously an international coach, JK's coaching pedigree was nowhere near as solid as Tana's, and he had leapfrogged some fairly critical steps on the traditional coaching ladder—steps which Tana has ticked off.  Also, their leadership contributions in their playing days can't even be compared. Tana is an out-and-out leader. I'm unsure if JK is or ever was. His first year or two might be difficult, he will have to deal with quality player shortages in some key positions, however we only need to look at Jamie Joseph's revival of the Highlanders to see that it's doable.   One thing people always seem to forget when assessing the strength of the Blues squad is the depth of our player catchment area. We're only ever one season away from a new graduating class of ridiculously talented provincial level 18-year-olds. We've just got to pick the right ones instead of navelgazing while they go off to the other franchises."

It was the same situation at Biarritz a few years ago when Lesgourgue was playing out of his skin (and he's brilliant now for Bordeaux) yet that wasn't enough to compensate for Yachvili being injured.

Really wish he would be brought back into the commentary team. I think it says a great deal about the ARU post Wallabies that they didn't fight tooth and nail to get him aboard at Fox. He was our iconic commentator ala Hugh Bladen, Rabs Warren or Grant Nisbett and having an iconic commentator is so very important for a televised sport.   Honestly believe that one of the reasons Rugby in this country has lost popularity is because Bray was not commentating. If we give players ARU top-ups on the back of their marketability then we should have done the same for Bray.   It's not that the Fox commentators are that bad (though they can be very bad), but they are not nearly as good as Bray by a long shot.   On that note, Sean Maloney is a colour or a sideline commentator, not a play-by-play commentator, which Fox are grooming him for at the moment. He is ill-suited for that role but Fox still persist. It mirrors the persistent issue that has plagued the ARU in recent years - old boys club first, professional organisation second.

Although it isn't mathematically impossible for Russia to oust Spain, the only chance they have of doing that is coming third giving them a total of 44 points.

Individual tackles he's great and can often dominate contact but he has been found out positionally a few times this season.

Quade is worth easily his salary in revenue for the QRU, which if they didn't know they soon will because the Reds Facebook page is screaming fan exodus on the back of the news.  There is a lot of shit going down at The Reds. They're very tightlipped on Graham's future and a lot of players (now 17) have left in the past 3 years with little experienced and talented players coming in to fill the void.  It wouldn't be unlike Quade to say ""If Graham stays I am going"". Nowhere has money been cited as the reason, only that the terms couldn't be agreed upon and were 'unreasonable'.  Honestly we're fucked without him. Under Graham we're probably still fucked with him, but at least the players won't be playing in empty stadiums.

rugbyunion,3araoy,_antipodean_,2,Tue Jun 23 07:02:37 2015 UTC,Manager is a tough negotiator + QC has all of the aces - if Qld don't sign him he's off for more money with a better team and a decent coach in the south of France.  The rumours of his demands are aplenty but it seems that $$$ weren't the be all and end all either. Graham gone as coach and wanting a contract but next year off to play sevens seem the most credible
rugbyunion,3araoy,strewthcobber,2,Tue Jun 23 01:48:41 2015 UTC,I thought Quade was very well remunerated by the ARU?
rugbyunion,3araoy,_antipodean_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:59:51 2015 UTC,He's (probably) one of the highest paid players in the country. But the Reds part of that payment is relatively small. The ARU topup + third party deals are where most of his money will be coming from. Which is why it's probably not about $$$ with the current negotiations with the Reds  And he still won't be getting paid as much as he will in France.
rugbyunion,3araoy,dr_chim_richaldz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:58:30 2015 UTC,"So as I understand it, the ARU are happy to keep him, but the sticking point is the Reds component of the contract?  It's all a bit of a soap opera given it appeared he had willingly signed with Toulon quite some time ago. Not sure I'd be paying him substantially more than €550K tbh.  Or put it this way; would you be paying him as much as Matt Giteau?"

rugbyunion,3ar9ty,JohnWesson,11,Mon Jun 22 21:34:44 2015 UTC,"Spaces, not faces."
rugbyunion,3ar9ty,anticsrugby,5,Mon Jun 22 23:29:10 2015 UTC,If you are a wing talk to your fullback a lot especially if he is experienced and listen to where he wants you.  Generally if you are openside wing in defence you drop back and the fullback will push over to cover in behind the blindside winger and if you are blindside you push up; the three of you need to work as one unit.  You probably already know these but let your centre take his man and stay on yours and work in to out. Use the touch line as an extra defender.  In attack keep the line wide and back yourself. It may be a bit selfish but when you get the ball on the wing and have space you go and it is other peoples responsibility to keep up and support you.
rugbyunion,3ar9ty,some_sort_of_monkey,4,Mon Jun 22 22:49:36 2015 UTC,"Can't really give much advice for centres, because I suck as a 13 and never really  played 12, but I can give winger advice.  As a winger, the hardest thing to get the hang of is the defence. You will be defending in a very different way to how you'd be used to at 7, and it all comes down to your positioning. 99% of the time, teams run a ""pendulum"" defence (your team might call it something different but it'll be the same thing). The idea is that when the ball is on the other side of the field, you drop back from the line and the 15 shifts over to where the ball is. Then, when the ball heads back your way, you push up into the line, 15 comes your way, and the other winger drops back. That means you always have 1 winger back, one coming up to meet them when they go wide, and 15 sweeping behind. Generally if they get an overlap outside you, you'd leave the outside man for the 15 to get, but your team may run that differently.   The important thing about this to get is the timing for when to come up and when to hang back. It's not something that's easy to get the hang of without personal experience, but you can get a bit of a feel for it by watching professional teams run it. Most of them run some variation on this sort of defence, so you'll be able to see it in any match really. Watch out for when tries are scored round the outside to see if the winger came up too soon and left a gap for a chip through, or if they left it too late and gave the attack too much space. If you can, try and get your team to run a few drills where you set up your defence, and then get people to run at you for wrap up tackles, just so you can get a feel for when you need to hit the line. Talk a lot to your 15 and 13, both before and during the match, so you can know what they want, and they know where you will be.  The other defensive thing you might not be used to is covering kicks. In terms of positioning, I always prefer to err on the side of caution and drop a bit further early on in the match. It's always better to be further back and running onto the ball than have it go over you, so until you can gauge the kicker's range, hang back more. Again, be talking to 15 a lot so you know where they want you.  As for the actual skills for this, when your placekickers go out to practice, go with them to be the ball boy and return the kicks to them. You can practice catching and quickly returning the ball, to get yourself more comfortable with kicking. Then, get your 9 or 10 to put some high kicks up for you to catch, either under pressure or not, and practice jumping for the ball while catching it high and bringing it in. There's a bunch of skills video's around to show you good technique, but look at people like Brown, Pennell, and Halfpenny for excellent technique under the high ball.  In attack, the simple idea is spaces not faces, and cut in before getting hit so you don't get taken out. Your attacking structures are much more likely to vary depending on your team, so talk lots to 10, 13, and 15 to work out what you're needed for.   When it's open play, if you're not involved in anything, try to follow the attack so you can latch onto an offload and steal all the glory. Chris Ashton is the king of this, so look at some highlights videos of his. You'll see how he runs great lines following the play (or sometimes going ahead of it, if he knows where the ball will be) and then picks up on a quick pass or kick through to score.   Counterattacking is a lot simpler than a lot of people make it out to be, so long as you work hard off the ball. Good counterattacks are made by the wingers working hard to get back and support 15 (or the other winger) even when the ball is on the other side of the field. Again, communication amongst the back 3 is hugely important for this stuff, so if you're there, tell them, and if you can't be, get shouting about where the space for attack is.   Well that ended up being much larger than I thought it would. If you're still reading, welcome to the world of the outside backs, and good luck!"

For some reason the Aussies (one scrummie, one coach) on my team cannot get this into their heads - I have been reamed out twice this season for ""my winger"" getting round the outside even though I've moved in to take the fullback who's made a last pass just before I hit him both times. We were playing a ""Fullback takes last man"" defence as well, but they insisted that I should have left the fullback and stayed on my wing, saying ""then its not my fault, even if they score"". Consider me perplexed."
rugbyunion,3ar9ty,AnchezSanchez,2,Wed Jun 24 14:58:18 2015 UTC,"That's a really dumb way to defend, and especially the coach should know that. If you don't have the winger take the inside man, then they make a break with options either side, whereas if they break down the outside, they only have one option to go infield, they're running out of space, and you can drift onto them easy. A coach in particular should be able to understand that..."
rugbyunion,3ar9ty,krakkerz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:48:26 2015 UTC,"In fairness, the coach was saying that the OC should have drifted out to take the full back - but if that doesn't happen, and I don't hear a call saying ""FB is mine"", then I have to hit him!  I'm wondering if its a League thing.  Anyway, I'm not changing the way I've played for 15 years, so I just talk with the rest of the back three about how we're going to defend before every match, and explain that set up to them."
rugbyunion,3ar9ty,muelindustries,6,Wed Jun 24 15:58:46 2015 UTC,"You must have done something horrible to deserve that sorry of demotion. :)  At 12, remember that your job is to straighten the attack and hopefully bend the line. In defense, own the whole team's system and keep the line straight and moving forward.  At 13, work on your reads in defense. You may end up with three or four bodies in motion and a big call to make. Work with your wing and fullback at training to make sure you know your responsibilities. In attack, demand the ball when you or your wing has a gap. Run hard and look for the offload.  I like my wings to stay out of the line in defense to be available for counterattack and enter the line when the ball goes wide. In attack, when you're on the short side, look for work as you would as a flanker. On the open, run good support lines and look for the offload from your 13."
rugbyunion,3ar9ty,saviouroftheweak,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:35:36 2015 UTC,I like my wings to stay out of the line in defense    ????  As a winger this has me confused.
rugbyunion,3ar9ty,Enyapxam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:53:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry. I suspect more context is required. Think of it as three fullbacks. Someone else used the term pendulum defence. Same thing.  Our wingers stay deepish out of the defensive line to cover the kick until the ball comes wide. Then, they enter the defensive line at the end to cover the unmarked man.  In our 22, though, the winger on the open side plays in the defensive line.  Every coach has a different strategy for how wings defend, though."

rugbyunion,3apv9i,runbabyrunforme,19,Mon Jun 22 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"It is sad that the team you want to play for has 'try-outs'. This seems to be the norm in US schools and colleges (and the clubs too?). Everyone who wants to play rugby should be able to.  I would like to say to you: buy a ball, get used to it. Find a friend and practice your catching and passing. Practice running with the ball in both hands. Practice catching the ball when running, both catching passes and catching high kicks. Learn to pass both sides when running. Learn basic tackling technique. Learn the rules of the game. Watch rugby and develop an understanding of positional play.  But I think what will probably serve you best is just to get into the gym and get strong and fit. That makes me sad too."

It's so much better to have multiple teams in a club and everyone gets some playing time in the lower grades. There are plenty of great sports and great communities, but in my experience rugby's the best to welcome complete beginners. It's too bad to lose that.  Now helping OP further I'd recommend finding people who are part of the team and asking them directly for advice, if some of them are playing touch in the off-season etc."

If you ever look at the amount of distance run by players in different sports, rugby is typically very low because a lot of the time players are falling down and standing back up instead of running.  I'd say you should do a lot of burpees as they will help you get used to getting back up.  You should set yourself other fitness milestones such as:   75 consecutive push ups 3 minute plank/ bridgehold 5K run in less than 30 minutes  15 pull ups   Or whatever milestones you would like. Or join a gym.  Also read the laws of the games particularly sections 10-16. I found knowing the rules helped me out.  You could try learn some tricks like the Fijian Shrug .

It's a lot of HIIT (look it up) so do sprint/jog/sprint/repeat and lots of leg work.  Also, learn to pass the ball. This is critical long-term, and no amount of Youtube-watching (great) or fitness regimes (critical) will matter if, when you need to get the ball wide out, you fumble about and can't put the ball where it needs to be quickly.

In the subs laws/rules, it says please keep results out of titles. Can we please make a final decision on this, make it well known and enforce it if necessary. People are going to get real mad if results get spoiled because the rules weren't clear or enforced. How about a few more sticked discussion threads during the build-up and during the RWC?

I'm unsure if I'll have to miss matches with work and, if I do, then I'll be watching recordings and staying away from anywhere I might see results but, still, it's a courtesy to keep winners out of titles."
rugbyunion,3aotwx,Kilen13,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:33:28 2015 UTC,Yea I try to stay away from a lot of sites to avoid spoilers but it sucks that I can't even browse my Reddit front page if spoilers are in the titles.  Much easier to just keep them out and it harms absolutely no one to do so.

I'd have all my players stand on their own try line, at equal distance from each other (so each standing on their own like the Welsh did) from one sideline to the other. It'll take out some of the effect of the haka because of the distance and it signifies that this line won't be crossed."

And that would be on the judiciary board if this were to occur. There's a 99.99% chance this appeal will get outright rejected - the footage is pretty black and white.  The Brumbies are simply trying to act in their own best interest right now, which isn't unreasonable considering they are currently wrapped up in knockout rugby. The appeal process exists in order to be used, and it's not like they've appealed every decision in the past - that just isn't true and to say so is nothing other than baseless hyperbole."
rugbyunion,3ao2zn,anticsrugby,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:37:11 2015 UTC,By appealing the decision he is gambling on his Wallaby jersey.   By pleading guilty he may miss 3 - 4 weeks which is the two SR finals games and a couple of NRC games. By challenging he opens himself up to the full 8 weeks which could rule him out of most of the Rugby Championship. Especially considering World Rugby's stance of cracking down on dangerous tackles.

rugbyunion,3ao2zn,TryTime_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:41:14 2015 UTC,"Looking at this from the Brumbies perspective, they may as well. He's going to get a minimum of 4 weeks by pleading guilty and miss the semi and final if they make it.  Brumbies don't care if it's 2 or 10 weeks. Anything more than one week is just as bad. So an increased penalty is no threat.    Lifting a Player from the ground and either dropping or driving that Player’s head and/or upper body into the ground whilst the Player’s feet are off the ground   Perhaps he can argue some technicality (no lifting? not a tackle? who knows....) and get off/get one week. Don't like their chances though"
rugbyunion,3ao2zn,strewthcobber,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:33:55 2015 UTC,I understand the perspective the Brumbies have on this; you want the bloke in your team and the process is clear so why not avail yourself of the opportunity?

rugbyunion,3alegs,batzman,2,Sun Jun 21 19:07:52 2015 UTC,He's playing well in Europe right now for Montpellier and was developing well in his final season with the Reds
rugbyunion,3alegs,douthinkthisisagame,0,Sun Jun 21 19:22:33 2015 UTC,"To be fair Quade Cooper made every other potential flyhalf for the Reds look average, especially his 2011 form.  Lucas I think is a journeyman of the same calibre as Foley. Works hard, puts the effort in, hard to fault but leaves you feeling like he'll never be remembered as a great flyhalf.  Realised he was never going to be better than Quade and wasn't very well looked after by the Reds anyway, and seems to be excelling outside the QRU environment."
rugbyunion,3alegs,DoctorDbx,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:55:16 2015 UTC,"Letting both Lucas and Harris leave at the same time was the bigger mistake to me.  I can sort of understand the reasoning of them deciding that Cooper, McIntyre and Paia'aua are enough cover but the minute both Cooper and McIntyre went down with long term injuries the Reds should have found a genuine replacement flyhalf instead of trying crazy shit like using Frisby, Harmichael or O'Beiber."
rugbyunion,3alegs,GreatJusticeForSGU,12,Mon Jun 22 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"This is not surprising. I don't even think it was the money, but more like he ran out in the last game and realised that most of the guys he played with and enjoyed playing with are now gone.  Horwill, Genia, Shipperley, Higgers, Morahan, Lucas, Lance, Ioane, Davies, Samo just to name a few. Replaced by guys from a different generation, some not quite ready yet, others will never be ready but Graham will never drop them.  Whether the Reds go ahead and sack Richard Graham now (word is they're keeping him) won't matter, because memberships next year will be slashed from this year."
rugbyunion,3alegs,DoctorDbx,3,Sun Jun 21 12:40:34 2015 UTC,"Yea I think this is more it. It's time he spreads his wings and try different rugby.

rugbyunion,3alvem,CommanderSpastic,4,Sun Jun 21 14:28:51 2015 UTC,"AAC and Horne need to be in the squad due to their ability to play inside and outside backs. Also they're some of the most reliable attackers and defenders Australia has to offer.   I think Phipps is better than Genia at the moment. And if White is instructed not to box kick, he's been a more effective player, too.  JOC has done nothing this year to earn even a bench spot.  And I think 12 is still up for grabs because of Toomua's inability to stay healthy. That sort of trait is disruptive to a consistent team.   I agree with your forward pack, though."
rugbyunion,3alvem,dr_chim_richaldz,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:41:23 2015 UTC,Horne could easily be there instead of JOC and I may even do that. As I said in another comment Izzy's boot is probably good enough. As a Tahs supporter I don't really like Phipps. He can be slow from the base of the ruck and his pass hasn't always been accurate this year. Genia has also been behind a pack going backwards this year as well which we can't forget.
rugbyunion,3alvem,dr_chim_richaldz,2,Sun Jun 21 23:17:53 2015 UTC,"You're right about Phipps' passing accuracy. Has been well off this year. His defense is fantastic, though. White has a beautiful and accurate pass but I can't stand his tendency to give the ball away with the boot. I hope Genia can find form again, but he can be far too much of a nomad when recycling the ball, and gets picked off by the loose forwards who guard the ruck. He needs a quicker pass off the base of the ruck, too.  Oh and also have a look at how much Folau's kicking game has improved. His distance for touch has improved immeasurably."
rugbyunion,3alvem,Reds_Klizun,2,Sun Jun 21 23:27:55 2015 UTC,"You didn't actually put anyone as your 23, but I agree with most of your squad. One of the things I'm a bit worried about is the lack of lineout options, and dealing with defensive lineouts. I don't know much about Jones, but the rest of them aren't the biggest of presences at lineout time, so that could be a potential weakness of the team. Scrum seems to be sturdy enough, and should be able to hold up against most teams.  Are you not considering Giteau in any of this? Because he is a quality player and could add some experience to the backline. I'd also want AAC in the squad somewhere, because he has so much versatility, and you're leaving cver short for the backs, taking 2 specialists who can't fill any other spots. I guess JOC can cover fullback if needs be, and we can shuffle people around, but I'd prefer the bench player to be the one to do the shuffling, because the main team would've most likely been practising in their respective positions and not have much experience elsewhere (within the national squad). Not too sure about Genia as well, he's looked a bit off, but I don't know much about the other halfbacks in Australia so can't really comment on that."
rugbyunion,3alvem,bigxblack,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:16:53 2015 UTC,"I almost picked Kerevi but with Speight at 23...   he said it in the 22 spot while talking about Cooper, not clear if you're just checking out the names though"

rugbyunion,3alvem,Reds_Klizun,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:08:43 2015 UTC,Though who do you pick to cover at lineouts. Simmons has been mediocre at best this year and has been tried over and over again. We don't have many options at all at 2nd row. Forgot about Giteau and will swap him with Cooper. Can cover more positions. I dont think we need AAC. Now I've picked Giteau he can 12 and fullback while Speight can cover 13 and the wings and 12 maybe. I think we've got enough cover. Genia has been behind a pack going backwards all year while and that never makes a 9 look good. I think he's good enough at 9.   Also will fix the 23 typo.
rugbyunion,3alvem,Reds_Klizun,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:05:15 2015 UTC,"Mmm, I guess that's the issue with running a lock who doesn't jump, and also a flanker who isn't a jumper. Maybe we can chuck in AAC to just jump for the team, he does enough of it at restarts! You're right, we don't have any locks that have all the qualities, we just have lots with a couple of qualities. Do you not think Giteau shouldn't start, at least at the beginning to test him out?"
rugbyunion,3alvem,KingMunners,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:12:50 2015 UTC,The lineout is going to be a nightmare for Chekia.... Im pretty sure Fardy calls the lineout for the Brumbies and Higgers occasionally jumps so it's probably not that bad. I wouldn't be happy with Giteau starting. Firstly he hasn't played with these guys for a long time and he'd be better coming of the bench. Secondly if he's at 12 where it seems people want him to go we have 2 quite small players in Foley and him defending the inside channels.
rugbyunion,3alvem,blindside06,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:25:31 2015 UTC,"He is no slouch in defence though. He will hold steady, and inside channels tend to be assisted by a member of the backrow off a lineout. In open play, I would think they'd drop one of Foley or Giteau back as a second fullback, and then it's only one potential hole which is easily plugged by assisting players. I'm not saying he should start the big games, but I think he's worth giving a run-out against Argentina, which allows them to see which 12 works better in the team before New Zealand."

rugbyunion,3akkm7,Canerbry,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:23:15 2015 UTC,Agreed but since the selectors have said he's the replacement its probably safe to assume he'll be the forth string half at the world cup over Weber.

rugbyunion,3akkm7,R8_D8_8_ATE_M8,7,Sun Jun 21 14:32:41 2015 UTC,TKB is great on defence. He's big for a halfback and gets a fair amount of tackle turnovers.  The All Blacks always pick defence over attack.

rugbyunion,3akkm7,jeffrey2ks,16,Sun Jun 21 04:22:29 2015 UTC,"It was never going to happen, and I'm very pleased with how the selections went; but a part of me was just wishing they would say...  Richard Buckman, Hawkes Bay."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,Foveaux,4,Sun Jun 21 03:42:10 2015 UTC,I think he'll get there eventually. Great player.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,cape7,14,Sun Jun 21 03:47:11 2015 UTC,"I can't wait to see Lima Sopoaga, Nehe Milner-Skudder & Waisake Naholo playing in the ABs."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,garciahigh,7,Sun Jun 21 03:06:16 2015 UTC,"Here's hoping the first choice backline is all Hurricanes and Highlanders. Smith over Dagg at fullback, and Naholo over Jane at wing. So Smith, Barrett, Savea, Nonu, Smith, Naholo, Smith! Though I doubt come world cup stage that Naholo could push out Jane."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,no_bread,6,Sun Jun 21 03:43:05 2015 UTC,On current form I think Carter will push out Barrett.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,AndydaAlpaca,2,Sun Jun 21 10:02:31 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. That guy. About time they played the best fly half in the world at fly half. God damn

rugbyunion,3akkm7,no_bread,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:14:10 2015 UTC,Dagg would go to wing over Jane and i wouldn't be sure between Smith and SBW
rugbyunion,3akkm7,Coffee12345,2,Sun Jun 21 14:46:15 2015 UTC,You been watching the same SBW I have this year? Yeah there's no way he'll be starting against a 1st tier nation over Conrad.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,gonltruck,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:07:08 2015 UTC,Yeah he's been well defended against this season. Putting in big hits but Buckman has been playing better at 12 than SBW.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,Foveaux,2,Sun Jun 21 20:32:59 2015 UTC,I'd rather have someone playing rugby well than just going for the glory hit.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,ycnz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:16:03 2015 UTC,Completely agree.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,Foveaux,0,Mon Jun 22 00:24:08 2015 UTC,"He has been injured, plus Conrad Smith is getting too old and slow, you could see this in the Europe tour last year. Conrad Smith has played a better season, i do admit."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,Coffee12345,2,Mon Jun 22 02:06:02 2015 UTC,"Conrad Smith has been ruled out as too slow his whole career, yet somehow he always manages"
rugbyunion,3akkm7,collkiwi,35,Mon Jun 22 03:57:14 2015 UTC,I think Ardie Savea should have a place in this squad.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,hardasnailsme,10,Sun Jun 21 03:12:20 2015 UTC,I 100% agree. I can't think of a good reason Ardie lost out to the likes of Matt Todd. I don't know the stats but it  just seems that Ardie has a much higher work rate. He gets so many turnovers and has stopped more than a few tries with his ridiculous speed. I definitely think he deserved a go in the black jersey this year.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,gigaslug,8,Sun Jun 21 04:21:47 2015 UTC,Also managed to stop himself from scoring...
rugbyunion,3akkm7,batzman,3,Sun Jun 21 06:48:20 2015 UTC,Next year. There are too many 7s ahead of him for the world cup.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,bakwan,2,Sun Jun 21 11:35:31 2015 UTC,"Agree, he should be in there.  The only reason I can think of that he is not is his discipline.   I remember he missed a few games this year for unknown reasons and pretty sure Hansen alluded to some age-related issues during his AB time."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,KiwiMaoriJapan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:47:01 2015 UTC,"Todd is a quality player,  more reliable and solid I think than the dynamic, young savea."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,twoshoesjacky225,8,Mon Jun 22 15:25:56 2015 UTC,"Hansen said that they did take somebody else out because of last night and swapped somebody in.  Anybody think it was probably Brad Webber? They implied they were interested in him in another article, and TKB seems a bit of a weird choice - said he didn't know his form.  Now they've just said Ellis would hypothetically be his replacement, so I don't know."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,6,Sun Jun 21 03:07:02 2015 UTC,"I think it may have been Ardie Savea.  They've been grooming him for a while now - was it last year or 2013 where they took him to Europe just to show him what it was like? - but there's a fair amount of depth already in that position in the squad.  edit: did he say it was because of last night?  I can't remember the exact wording, but I thought he just meant that they were still discussing it last night."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,marmitechips,2,Sun Jun 21 03:10:43 2015 UTC,"I just saw that in the other thread, you're probably right. Reckon it was Naholo who got the nod in because of it.  Funny how they asked him about Ardie and Halfback in particular.  edit: just saw your edit. Not sure bro, I may have read too much into it."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,2,Sun Jun 21 03:12:37 2015 UTC,"I was thinking last night at the game, that I hope the match didn't lessen his chances, because he was playing against Aaron Smith in probably the best match-form of his life.  Maybe it was though, Weber is eligible for the Maori team so by the sounds of it they'll monitor through that as well. If we have a Canes and Highlanders final I can see Weber being brought up, because TKB is only just joining club rugby now, and Ellis is the only other proper replacement."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,Foveaux,2,Sun Jun 21 03:16:05 2015 UTC,"Ellis hasn't impressed me this year, honestly. Gotten worse since Japan. Seems to happen to some players, seems not to happen to others."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,2,Sun Jun 21 03:18:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I used to be a huge fan of his, but it seems he's lost something. Some kind of spark. A good rugby head on his shoulders but he seems off the pace a bit this season.  So if TKB is still getting back into gametime, and Smith and Perebanana are duking it out, Weber to be brought in? Pulu is out as well I recall."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,Foveaux,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:21:13 2015 UTC,"He's slow to the rucks, it seems. The one memory that encapsulates what I thought of him this season was him vs you guys (I think it was) in Christchurch, with like a 3 on 7 on the openside, and he chose to pass the ball to a 1 on 3 on the blindside because he didn't look.  And yeah, I think Hansen said something about Ellis as a back up, so I think it'd be him next if the Highlanders and Hurricanes get to the final."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,4,Sun Jun 21 03:22:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe James Lowe vs Naholo? James Lowe has had a great year and so has Naholo, however James Lowe didnt have too good a game last night."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,batzman,2,Sun Jun 21 04:19:35 2015 UTC,"There was an article on stuff recently about 6 players the ABs were looking at to potentially come in and join the ABs -- don't think it was just a journalist, I think it was an insider. Naholo was on that list, but Lowe wasn't.  Could have been, though."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,0,Sun Jun 21 04:31:44 2015 UTC,6 players the ABs were looking at to potentially come in and join the ABs   Surely James Lowe as there or there abouts had to be in contention?
rugbyunion,3akkm7,batzman,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:49:15 2015 UTC,"Welp, fuck me, I mixed it up. Was only marc hinton's guessing, but yeah, I would have had him up there. I really love how he plays, Lowe.  http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/all-blacks/68606809/all-blacks-bolters--ranking-the-top-five-contenders-for-rugby-world-cup-spot"
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,0,Sun Jun 21 08:11:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely Brad Weber. He was awful last week against the Canes and he was very average yesterday missing 4 tackles. Up until now he has been in great form and they were seriously considering picking him but if he can't handle big games then they wouldn't pick him. Could have been Damian McKenzie though with Piutau being selected instead, but that wouldn't make sense as he was one of the standouts for the Chiefs."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,Patrolling_Enforcer,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:15:46 2015 UTC,"Don't think it was McKenzie - he's still young and lots of cover with the outside backs. But yeah, Brad Webber was just outclassed at the same position. Hard to make a read on one game, but he wasn't great."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,7,Sun Jun 21 14:20:53 2015 UTC,"Potential 15 for the Samoa match, assuming both the Landers and Canes are in the final.  Woody  Kevvy  Franks  Retallick   Whitelock  Kaino  McCaw  Read  Ellis  Carter  Crotty  Williams  Piutau  Dagg  Jane(make an exception as he needs the game time)  12 players from the 2011 WC squad, not a bad b-team"
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,3,Sun Jun 21 03:31:13 2015 UTC,"Scary when you consider the Hurricanes backline is basically the ABs, and with that you almost couldn't tell minus ellis, maybe. Just looks like they've had a few injuries in them at most."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,3,Sun Jun 21 03:33:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so much experience.   With the exception of Retallick the forward pack I named is the one that started the 2011 WC final. It could be a hell of test match, a lot of those players will be out to prove they still have it."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,dmteadazer,6,Sun Jun 21 03:38:13 2015 UTC,Kevvy is the weakest link there. That says something.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,pakhammer,5,Sun Jun 21 03:40:04 2015 UTC,wtf i dont see my name on there
rugbyunion,3akkm7,Clubfuckingfooted,15,Sun Jun 21 09:42:16 2015 UTC,The best team in the world. Rest of the world beware.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,4,Sun Jun 21 03:08:55 2015 UTC,"TKB looks to be the only questionable choice, never really rated the guy. Then again there really is no clear 3rd choice back up, Andy Ellis was being kept on the bench a lot of the time by Drummond who isn't exactly the greatest.  Can't complain, overall looks good to me."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,cape7,2,Sun Jun 21 03:23:25 2015 UTC,"He's got that Weepu sort of style, which I'm not a giant fan of, but I did think he was improving in the last few games to a respectable AB point, even if I wasn't entirely convinced.  When Sumo asked what they thought of TKB's form now because they haven't seen him, he explicitly said that - they don't know about his form. Not sure, but they've put time into him and think he's got the talent to get to where he was."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,12,Sun Jun 21 03:25:58 2015 UTC,"TKB is more like Cowan than Weepu. I really like him as a 3rd option because hes safe. His pass isn't great but when TKB is out there the fringes are rock solid on defense, he has no problem sitting big loose forwards on their arse. He has a decent kicking game, he runs hard off shoulders and he knows where the ball should be going ruck to ruck.   I wouldn't want him starting in the 9 jersey, but backing up TJ and Smith, i think hes the best option."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,Cpt-No-Dick,4,Sun Jun 21 03:35:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, true, I forgot about Cowan. I agree with."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,5,Sun Jun 21 03:37:18 2015 UTC,Pleasantly surprised that Charles Piutau has made it in. Thought he'd sunk his ship well and truly with the Ulster signing.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,R2CEE2,5,Sun Jun 21 03:32:21 2015 UTC,"Still only the 41, could still be left out of the main thing, only 3/4 of this get to stay in, and with the new outside backs being very very very good and competitive, anything could happen!"
rugbyunion,3akkm7,sdre,3,Sun Jun 21 03:34:09 2015 UTC,"I think a Ma'a, SBW and Julian line would be unstoppable"
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,2,Sun Jun 21 08:47:22 2015 UTC,Could someone add some notable missing players?  Off my head:  Ardie Savea Elliot Dixson Funnell   ?
rugbyunion,3akkm7,swainj,4,Sun Jun 21 08:29:24 2015 UTC,"no real surprises, besides maybe ardie, solely because the size of it is so big.  I'd say Lowe besides that, maybe Brad Webber."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,3,Sun Jun 21 09:00:04 2015 UTC,Steve Hansen was at the game last night and said because of it one name was removed and another added I was thinking it may have been Lowe and Naholo was added or maybe it was Brad Weber?
rugbyunion,3akkm7,minutesir,3,Sun Jun 21 09:09:11 2015 UTC,"yeah, we were talking about it in another section of the thread!  could be ardie, weber or lowe like you said."

rugbyunion,3akkm7,cape7,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"Yea i was thinking it was James Lowe, seeing as Brad Weber played really good considering he was up against the best in the world."

rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,3,Sun Jun 21 09:07:33 2015 UTC,This announcement doesn't mean he won't. But he won't be going to the world cup anyway. Too many other better outside backs ahead of him.
rugbyunion,3akkm7,dubdubdubdot,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:10:50 2015 UTC,"i doubt he's even in contention, don't know anything about his contract but he probably still has the itm cup season."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,-1,Sun Jun 21 10:11:04 2015 UTC,Anyone else think Fekitoa is a questionable pick?
rugbyunion,3akkm7,swainj,5,Sun Jun 21 03:47:00 2015 UTC,"Not really. He hasn't been as good this year, but he showed he had the talent last year and really cemented himself in the squad then."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,fernta,4,Sun Jun 21 04:08:31 2015 UTC,Most of last year was due to him being unknown  and now every defence if focusing on him as the best ball runner in the back like but his defence this year has been amazing gets a lot of pilfers reads defences well like his hit on Horrell last night or stripping Folou in Dunedin
rugbyunion,3akkm7,Foveaux,4,Sun Jun 21 09:13:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He's ""figured out"" in a sense, but he's done well - just hasn't been the offensive threat he was last year. Great on D though."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,minutesir,6,Sun Jun 21 09:21:38 2015 UTC,"I can see your thinking behind it, he's been much quieter this year and his shortcomings have been more apparent. But he's clearly a physical freak and they know what they want him to be in time.  Plus, Ben Smith was much quieter in 2014 compared to 2013 when the All Blacks highlights reel was essentially just him doing this thing. Could be that teams are making sure Fekitoa doesn't have as much space as he wants; I'm sure he will do well."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,NZGrade,2,Sun Jun 21 09:24:49 2015 UTC,"Fekitoa is the incumbent 23 so he was always going to be named in the wider squad. He can cover 11-12-13-14 and, though his form has dipped a little, he's still one of the top four midfielders in NZ."
rugbyunion,3akkm7,JoshH21,4,Sun Jun 21 14:53:31 2015 UTC,"Certainly not for a 41 man squad but I do think he's still very much a work in progress and has a lot of flaws to his game. I'd sooner Crotty came on in an important game right now, even though he isn't as talented or physical. That said, having Fekitoa as a sub for C. Smith is a good contrast, whereas Smith and Crotty are very similar."

rugbyunion,3alm6o,canetrain,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:34:09 2015 UTC,Let's not kid ourselves.  Sonny Bill is a 99% lock to put his hand up for the 7s team.

rugbyunion,3alm6o,Mike-W,3,Mon Jun 22 07:52:33 2015 UTC,"This was always to be expected. SBW has been rumoured, for what seems like forever, for sevens. And Messamup was a great sevens player a few years back (wasn't he even captain?), no doubt he can shed that little bit of weight and be one of the best again."
rugbyunion,3alm6o,xValarax,6,Mon Jun 22 08:20:37 2015 UTC,Messam was made captain as a teenager and led them when they were a dominant force. Teitjens has said he's one of the greatest sevens players he has ever come across
rugbyunion,3alm6o,blindside06,3,Sun Jun 21 19:32:12 2015 UTC,Captained the side as a 19 year old I believe.

Also if players decide to join the sevens Olympic team, does it mean that they can't participate in Super Rugby for that season? And where do they go to play instead?"
rugbyunion,3alm6o,yourgrandmasteaparty,2,Sun Jun 21 21:30:39 2015 UTC,"NZRU has said if you want to go to Rio, you have to be part of the 7s setup the whole year. The circuit is long so that will keep them busy in place of Super Rugby."
rugbyunion,3alm6o,batzman,0,Mon Jun 22 01:03:34 2015 UTC,"Bugger. Not a fan of sevens, don't think it should be in the Olympics and don't like how people will jump codes to have a go at a medal"
rugbyunion,3alm6o,Foveaux,9,Mon Jun 22 02:07:51 2015 UTC,Why don't you think it should be in the Olympics? It's a perfect tournament sport. World cups and test series often last longer than the entire Olympics encompasses. XVs couldn't translate to an Olympic format while still promoting player welfare.
rugbyunion,3al8hr,I_Gets_The_Reference,18,Sun Jun 21 08:12:14 2015 UTC,Is anyone doubting that it was a red card
rugbyunion,3al8hr,ozwozzle,13,Sun Jun 21 09:23:57 2015 UTC,Speights red card. But couldnt agree more
rugbyunion,3al8hr,LouisB1991,10,Sun Jun 21 08:35:04 2015 UTC,"That's Speight not Tomane. And yeah, straight red all day"

rugbyunion,3al8hr,It_Is_Known,5,Sun Jun 21 11:41:06 2015 UTC,Yeah that's a straight red no doubt. I wouldn't give it a long ban but he shouldn't be back for the semi and/or final.
rugbyunion,3al8hr,fettsack,3,Sun Jun 21 09:10:46 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone was doubting the decision for a red card. It's more the suspension time he should face.

rugbyunion,3al8hr,say-something-nice,3,Sun Jun 21 17:22:12 2015 UTC,So going on SANZAR's record its a straight 4 or more weeks?
rugbyunion,3al8hr,SouthAfricanD,0,Sun Jun 21 08:50:59 2015 UTC,"probably a little more than 4 weeks. If he's very lucky he'll get 6 weeks entry level for a mid level (no actual lifting on Henry's part, he grabbed JdJ by the upper body and a lot of the work was unfortunately done by Juan's momentum, but at the same time JdJ landed in a diabolically bad position) + 2 weeks for deterrence. - 2 weeks for an early guilty plea - 2 weeks for contrition and a clean judiciary record. Just because of the nature of how JdJ landed, however, he might get a higher entry level.  Also don't trust my maths. Both Talu Latu And Rob Horne of the Tah's got exactly the same treatment and that ended... interestingly: TL got 6+2-2-2 = 4 and RH got 6+2-2-2= 3. SANZAR at its absolute finest there. I'd love for Henry to get the Liam Messam or Ma'a Nonu treatment of 0=0 though..."
rugbyunion,3al8hr,TerribleTrowel,3,Sun Jun 21 12:18:44 2015 UTC,The real question is if they'll count the NRC matches towards the ban or only SXV and test matches.
rugbyunion,3al8hr,minutesir,2,Sun Jun 21 14:54:16 2015 UTC,I don't understand what having the ball or not has to do with this? I watched the game with a few mates and no one thought De Jongh had the ball. It's a ruck cleanout gone very wrong. Even if De Jongh had the ball it would still be red.
rugbyunion,3al8hr,gonltruck,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"Actually - you're right. I was looking at it as a tackle/random throw, but I think you're right, he's trying to clean out (terribly).  Thanks gonitruck."

rugbyunion,3ajubw,SmashedHimBro,4,Mon Jun 22 04:37:50 2015 UTC,I think NZ really benefited from that Oceania tournament. The Northern Nations always look more organised with their 6 nations experience and i think that tournament bridged the gap a bit.

rugbyunion,3aibm0,DT2014,0,Mon Jun 22 00:35:03 2015 UTC,"That, in a way, makes it all the more better. It deincentivises teams to not contest it, meaning that when teams do for special occasions, it's more memorable."

I think de Jongh just happened to be shifting his weight in such a way at the exact wrong moment that Speight's otherwise would-be-fine tackle resulted in a spear.  I agree that it should have been a red card simply because spears are so dangerous that the punishment shouldn't be left up to subjectivity, but I'll feel damn sorry for him if he has to miss their finals over it.

rugbyunion,3akj9t,dr_chim_richaldz,2,Sun Jun 21 02:46:05 2015 UTC,Cane was defs read out
rugbyunion,3akj9t,Foveaux,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:47:04 2015 UTC,Yep
rugbyunion,3akj9t,dr_chim_richaldz,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:47:30 2015 UTC,Thought he must have been. Just couldn't recall after so many names.
rugbyunion,3alub7,TryTime_,2,Sun Jun 21 14:15:47 2015 UTC,Damian de Allende takes the top spot after gaining 120 meters with a massive 12 defenders beaten. Hes been a bright spot in a difficult year for the South African sides. Tomane decided the match however with three tries and nearly a fourth. Should be an awesome match next week when the Brumbies travel to Wellington.
rugbyunion,3aj3y8,BettieSwollocks,2,Sat Jun 20 18:13:21 2015 UTC,read like a book
rugbyunion,3aj3y8,hurtbuisness,3,Sun Jun 21 01:28:08 2015 UTC,Great play but Fekitoa is still making too many errors & he tends to hog the ball.
rugbyunion,3aj3y8,garciahigh,9,Sat Jun 20 22:35:02 2015 UTC,That sounds like the comments people used to make about a young Nonu.   Hopefully he turns out to be half the player Ma'a is.
rugbyunion,3aj3y8,Koreapsu,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:14:38 2015 UTC,"Agree! He does well in broken play but I've not seen him run a dummy line once to create space for the outside defenders, and has poor distribution skills. Nonu has more variety to his game.  Think there was a moment in the game yesterday which summed up how frustrating he was! He cabbed 10m across the field and offloaded the ball to Naholo when he realised he was still going to get tackled. Naholo had overran by the time the pass was made, and the ball bobbled out for a lineout. Looked like an error a high school player makes."
rugbyunion,3aj3y8,CaptBaha,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:12:20 2015 UTC,"He runs dummy lines very well and has a great pass off either hand. But he does hog the ball too much trying to make something from nothing, now that teams know how dangerous he is, he's being shut down much more effectively."
rugbyunion,3aj3y8,Foveaux,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:49:08 2015 UTC,Hope so for his sake. Would be good if he recognises that and puts those skills to use sometime then...

rugbyunion,3ajnbl,dr_chim_richaldz,6,Sun Jun 21 02:21:37 2015 UTC,Funny how he didn't really discover his talent until he moved to the Crusaders - I think playing in a structured team and getting better fitness levels has done wonders for him.
rugbyunion,3ajnbl,sneaky_tricksy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:00:22 2015 UTC,Wish he was still at the Waratahs now. Imagine him and Nayavoro as your two wingers

rugbyunion,3aifsz,ChristianMB1,2,Sat Jun 20 15:52:28 2015 UTC,"What a difference an even scrum (one penalty apiece, the brumbies had an advantage for the third Tomane try) and no Stuart Berry makes. Also no Duane Vermulean.   On the bright side for the Stormers going into half time, the Brumbies have been playing with manic line speed that is slowing down, the Stormers' scrum looks like it might be going on top and Damien de Allende looks like he could score a try any time he touches a ball. A lot of game to chase, but given a good rev-up and they're in with a decent chance, in my opinion."

rugbyunion,3aifsz,10acious,2,Sat Jun 20 15:38:51 2015 UTC,Even with those the Stormers wouldn't have been in playoff position if they weren't in an awful conference.  Granted I think the SA teams are being fucked over by teams from Europe having more money than them and getting all their players.

rugbyunion,3aifsz,yakir106,2,Sun Jun 21 07:47:16 2015 UTC,Hence why they didn't deserve it and it was handed to them.  It still doesn't change the fact that the Stormers were the 7th best team this year and the Brumbies were the 5th best.

Brumbies tighthead is droving up and in from the beginning, clear penalty against. His body position is clearly illegal, touchjudge should have seen it."

rugbyunion,3ahhl3,twoshoesjacky225,5,Sat Jun 20 08:04:55 2015 UTC,"Perhaps not a popular opinion, but I don't think Messam has great game sense. He often over extends himself near the touch line and has it backfire on him."
rugbyunion,3ahhl3,Holdthesaltplease,6,Sat Jun 20 08:43:11 2015 UTC,That's spot on.   Makes bad decisions too often.
rugbyunion,3ahhl3,Koreapsu,2,Sat Jun 20 08:49:34 2015 UTC,"Although it would be brutal move to cull him from a WC squad again I have serious doubts that he will make it for the WC squad. Most penalised in the comp, rude with referees and as you point out, his decision making has gone down the sink. He's getting on a bit with age too so it wouldn't be that bad an idea to blood a youngster in the squad."

I reckon introducing someone like Taufua or Shields would be better for the ABs. Or even Ardie Savea and experiment with two 7s. It will be interesting who is named in the squad tomorrow."

rugbyunion,3ahhl3,skeeter1980,3,Sat Jun 20 09:26:37 2015 UTC,"What format would you suggest then? For the size of the competition it works well. And this is the first time I can remember when a conference winner didn't have as many points as a wildcard team. It places an added importance on local games too, I love it. The same format has been used in the NFL for years and it creates huge rivalries which creates more buzz and attention around games."
rugbyunion,3ahhl3,gezaarr,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:34:38 2015 UTC,"You're right, every other year of this format the top team from each country has been in the top 3 in points. This year is unusual because the NZ conference is so strong. Having some weaker teams in some conferences does help some middling teams but that imbalance is probably better than the toll and cost of constant travel we'd have otherwise."
rugbyunion,3ahhl3,HMFCalltheway,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:36:41 2015 UTC,I think it's also possibly to do with the other conferences being a bit weaker than usual. I think player drain is starting to take its toll on Aus/Sa while new zealand will always have quality amongst the teams. I get the feeling the trend may continue.
rugbyunion,3ahhl3,TheEvilDrPie,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:49:58 2015 UTC,"I think the talent distribution should sort itself out at some point, I'll admit I don't have any knowledge on how the contracts work.

Super Rugby is always on Sky Sports 1, as well as all NZ tests. Other SH test matches will be on the Rugby Channel, another channel you gotta pay for here, as well as the European club competitions. Pretty sure ESPN plays the Six Nation when it's on like a week later. All of the alternative U20 games out of the ones they picked during the game were on the rugby channel.

rugbyunion,3ahn5l,LouisB1991,11,Sat Jun 20 07:00:53 2015 UTC,I heard that one way of going around is to have the player's wife work at the club for a very high salary (so she's actually paid for her work plus what they want to give the player).
rugbyunion,3ahn5l,fettsack,3,Sat Jun 20 08:37:52 2015 UTC,Can the clubs really be penalised for that though?
rugbyunion,3ahn5l,fettsack,3,Sat Jun 20 08:46:18 2015 UTC,I don't know. It sounds like a pretty legal way of getting someone money and that's easy to check by the Premiership.

rugbyunion,3ahn5l,J0nShannow,7,Sat Jun 20 19:10:30 2015 UTC,"Its probably not as simple as bonuses. 'Marquee players' aside you would probably need to get creative, perhaps with extravagant expenses claims. E.g. all of your players need to drive from Dundee to Land's End twice a week in their own cars and you need to reimburse them for all the premium unleaded they use. Another way could be by hiring their partners as 'consultants' for however much over the salary cap. There are lots of dodgy ways of doing it but if a thorough investigation comes along its difficult not to get caught."
rugbyunion,3ahn5l,saviouroftheweak,6,Sat Jun 20 08:08:22 2015 UTC,We should launch an investigation
rugbyunion,3ahn5l,icantthinkofaname3,2,Sat Jun 20 07:32:50 2015 UTC,"The wage cap has gone up this year, and another marquee player has been added. So there is more room to play with in the cap.

rugbyunion,3ahn5l,some_sort_of_monkey,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:34:41 2015 UTC,Not Ford? Surely your marquee player would be your starting 10 not the sub?
rugbyunion,3ahn5l,icantthinkofaname3,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:01:03 2015 UTC,"We signed Ford when he was a sub at Leicester, and not playing regularly for the national team so wouldn't have commanded a big wage. Don't think he's signed a new contract since so don't think he'll be on a big money.   Priestland will be no.2 (sure he probably knows that) and is a current player for the national team; so we're paying for a quality player to agree to be on the bench."
rugbyunion,3ahn5l,some_sort_of_monkey,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:22:02 2015 UTC,Fair point but don't you also already have a marquee player? Who do you think is getting a wage cut? Also you have Niko coming in as well as 1 or 2 others don't you?
rugbyunion,3ahn5l,icantthinkofaname3,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:08:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah we've got a few others coming in, but Paul James + Stringer are off, and looks like Carl Fearns is as well. Think all of them would have been high earners.  Don't know if anyone would be getting a wage cut. Salary cap also got increased by about 500k or something, as well as having the additional marquee player"
rugbyunion,3ahn5l,some_sort_of_monkey,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:39:34 2015 UTC,Sorry I think I got my self a bit confused there not quite sure what I was talking about.
rugbyunion,3ahn5l,EoinMcLove,-3,Sun Jun 21 13:20:06 2015 UTC,"They would do it more stealthy than that, but yes, a number of teams in England completely abuse their wage cap. The ""perks"" can make up the money, i.e. giving them a house / apartment to live in, a nice car, and additional payments for things like their commercial rights and activities outside of the rugby contract, you can come up with literally anything - consultant fees for working with academy players (purely to put ""consultant fees"" in the accounts to mask the overpayment)  But yeah, the Nigel Wrays and Bruce Craigs of this world will do anything and everything to cheat and dismantle their way to the top."

rugbyunion,3afrkc,some_sort_of_monkey,2,Fri Jun 19 22:24:33 2015 UTC,He's fully moved to centre (played at 13 in the Pro12 final) but can still cover the back row if injuries rack up which is quite handy

Now, it's undeniable that the women's game isn't anywhere near as big a draw as the men's, and as such there's less money in the women's game. However, we're talking about the national XV playing a test series at home, for a total PTP cost of around $28,000. I can't believe that Rugby Canada, which apparently had a budget of $14 million in 2014 can't find this money and/or extra revenue streams to cover their elite women."

I'd like to see a counterpoint."
rugbyunion,3aik1j,BertDaKat,3,Sat Jun 20 19:25:51 2015 UTC,"As far as I can see in their financial records (pg 16, Players row), the Senior Men's national team members don't pay anything. The underage players have to pay though."
rugbyunion,3aik1j,yourgrandmasteaparty,2,Sun Jun 21 00:01:32 2015 UTC,"Interesting. While it'd be gentlemanly for the men's senior team to take a stand and say ""hey we'd like to shoulder some of their burden"", I don't see it as sexist for the heads of Rugby Canada to have the team that puts the most fleshsacks in the stands get preferential treatment."

If the imaginary car factory was segregated with the women building car A and the men building car B. If car A doesn't bring in any money the decision to fire the people who made it makes total sense. While it seems crazy these women would have to pay to represent Canada it does make sense that the men's team would get higher funding due to the higher funds they generate.

From what i have seen of him(for qualification, i haven't seen every fame he's ever played), he has flashes of brilliance, mostly coupled with average games.. I think i've seen maybe 2 complete games of his playing in the green and gold where he was just fabulous.  He is, on his day, one of the best 10's in world rugby. Sadly, his days are rare. Reminds me a lot of a couple of french 10's that have been the same.."

Naholo has probably been the form winger of the season other than nehe Milne skudder. I do agree Coles is better than Elliot though.

rugbyunion,3ae8s9,rugbyfiend,3,Sat Jun 20 03:19:42 2015 UTC,"Please, the current Poms are a terrible side, and the Australian side is a very good one. The main negative against them being called 'great' is that they would be beaten by the late 90s/early 00s AUS side, the ultimate benchmark champions.   In the last 18 months or so they have demolished England 5-0, beaten the previous best (SA) 2-1, won the Cricket World Cup convincingly (other than the aberrant NZ pool game), and just demolished WI too for good measure.   If the weather holds up I wouldn't at all be surprised by a 5-0 whitewash again, if it's shit or England has some luck maybe 4-0, or at worst 3-1.   If you truly believe ""it wouldn't be much of a shock if the Poms kicked your asses"", you are either delusional or haven't watched any cricket since mid-2013. It would be the biggest shock the cricket world has seen in a decade, i.e. since the 2005 Ashes series."
rugbyunion,3ae8s9,seekandknow,2,Sat Jun 20 07:16:03 2015 UTC,"Mate, I agree that Australia has a much better team than England and based on current form I expect them to win 3-1.    But, I stand by my original comment that I would not be shocked if England sneaks an unlikely victory.  England, is playing at home and has enough world class players to pull off an upset. For example check out the ICC list of the top 10 ranked bowlers  and batsmen. There are 4 Aussies in the list and 3 English players. Also, last year Australia got beaten 2-0 by Pakistan who are ranked lower than England.   So while an upset might be surprising I think it would be hyperbolic to call it shocking. To put it in perspective. I'm pretty sure the Wallabies will be at longer odds to win the Bledisloe cup this year than the English will be to win the Ashes. Despite that, if the Wallabies do pull off an upset I'd be surprised but I wouldn't be shocked."

It wasn't the scoreline, or the ineptness of the French that had me convinced. It was the cowardice. Watch the French backs as Lomu runs to the line they are avoiding him out of fear.   Their comeback IMO is undoubtedly the greatest in history. Other teams may have overcome greater deficits, other teams may have dragged down better teams but no team has shrugged off their fear and discovered their bravery like the French did that day.

rugbyunion,3adx8h,amplebooty,3,Sat Jun 20 09:54:15 2015 UTC,If we were to get knocked out in the groups then we'd still be picking a younger squad. Your hard-on for wanting England to lose has obviously affected your logic.
rugbyunion,3adx8h,amplebooty,3,Sat Jun 20 09:56:31 2015 UTC,"Well if we get to the semis or further the plaers would have little to no time of rest due to champions cup. Then you have a whole season of europe and six nations, domestic league. I'd imagine some players would get rested to the younger talents. I'm thinking mainly in the backrow/lock. Who knows how many players will be injured by the time we come to june."

rugbyunion,3abby8,sdfdsize,5,Thu Jun 18 18:40:16 2015 UTC,Slick. I remember back in '08 he briefly was in AB squad (I think) and didn't get much done. A few years later and he is the best fullback in the world.
rugbyunion,3abby8,threalseymourskinner,5,Fri Jun 19 02:27:17 2015 UTC,"That was the year I got to play against him in club rugby, I'm unsure if he was an AB that year. But I know his first touch in Black he dropped the ball haha."

rugbyunion,3abby8,sdre,5,Fri Jun 19 03:39:30 2015 UTC,"He's just very powerful, I was lining him up as he was attacking with the ball. I went low, should have been a text book tackle and he blew through me like he was made of steel. I've always been a strong defender but I wasn't prepared for that.   I was only on the field for a bit, I was out of my depth at 17-18 years old playing premier grade club stuff but I did my best. He was lethal, unfortunately his club does not have talent spread out amongst them so he could only do so much, but you knew then he was special."
rugbyunion,3abby8,Foveaux,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:46:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the in depth write up. I can only imagine what's it like to play with or against someone like that. Your experience has definitely enriched (albeit a broken tackle)   At least u could say u attempted a tackle on Ben Smith!
rugbyunion,3abby8,sdre,4,Fri Jun 19 03:54:40 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, I'm sure as a grandad I'll be telling kicks I took him down stripped the ball from him and carried his entire forward pack over the line but it was a failed tackle and I saw stars. We had Adam Thomson in our team, and two NZ sevens reps so the pace of the game was extraordinary."
rugbyunion,3abby8,Foveaux,5,Fri Jun 19 04:03:55 2015 UTC,The man's a bloody wraith the way he slips through those defenders!

rugbyunion,3ac8q1,gabed-em,3,Fri Jun 19 02:14:36 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it but it was overdue. Kirwin just doesn't dish out the discipline needed to make players turn results. There's clearly talent but no unification among players. Handling errors are almost embarrasing. I hope Umaga takes over. I think he'd demand the respect from the players a coach needs to get results.   I'd ""watch this space."""
rugbyunion,3ac8q1,Lyrr,3,Fri Jun 19 00:11:04 2015 UTC,This does nothing to fix that franchise. Lam and now Kirwan... The Blues need to purge the management and shake up everything about the team before things start to improve.

rugbyunion,3ac8q1,harblstuff,9,Fri Jun 19 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"People like Kirwan. He's a good bloke. But people also like their team to win. It seems that the whole Blues franchise is in disarray, possibly because of failings at an organisational level - perhaps a bit too much rope afforded to board members. We've just had a major tussle over Kirwan's job between private investors and the rest of the organisation. It's been at an impasse for a few months now. Clearly something is wrong at the top and it's trickling down to the players.  I don't want to say Kirwan has fallen on his sword, he clearly made mistakes (see Benji Marshall) but chances are the blame is not all his."
rugbyunion,3ac8q1,harblstuff,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"The very weird thing is the exact same personality criticism has been levelled at former Leinster coach Matt O'Connor. That is to say, the players loved him, yet it was said over and over, he was a nice guy and never came down hard on the players like Cheika (whose temper was famous) and Schmidt (whose Monday video analysis sessions were surgical in nature and took no prisoners) - instead Matt let the players have more freedom and didn't lay down the law as much.   Edit: The difference is Kirwan was liked (especially as a former player), but Matt was poor with the media and came across as blaming everyone/thing else: referees, players, the IRFU, the player welfare system, the fans. He made enemies within the Union, with the media and with the fans. Part of me feels sympathy for him, part of me doesn't. For all we know our problems also lie deeper and it wasn't his fault, I suppose we'll find out over the next two years."
rugbyunion,3ac8q1,threalseymourskinner,2,Fri Jun 19 17:01:07 2015 UTC,Strange to see someone more hated than Matt.
rugbyunion,3ac8q1,deadlysyntax,4,Fri Jun 19 10:13:21 2015 UTC,The Blues are a poisoned bloody chalice alright. Good luck to the next joker.
rugbyunion,3ac8q1,Qu1ncy,2,Fri Jun 19 02:23:57 2015 UTC,"Had to be done but I feel sorry for the bugger. Like Pat Lam said when he left - I hope the next gets all the resources he needs. In saying that, nothing really indicates that Kirwan didn't have enough resources, unless someone can correct me there. It's got to come down to coaching and buy-in from the players.  Sounds like the private investors have too much say, they are supposedly the ones who wanted to keep him on."
rugbyunion,3ac8q1,ptashark,3,Fri Jun 19 00:14:09 2015 UTC,"For Pat Lam, he took a team to the semi finals then the next season fails to makes the playoffs and got fired for that, seirously it's more the players suck than it is the coaches fault."

In this instance there can be absolutely no such defence, there is no possibility of that being anything other than fully pre-meditated. However, I do agree that there is not much in it.  I wouldn't want a ban for life personally, though I would want to see a very lengthy one indeed and a condition on his being allowed to play again being that he shows genuine contrition."

Now that's not really true because they weren't fined for the arrow shape and walk towards the ABs but only for crossing the line. They knew they would be fined and chose to do it anyway as the ABs also knew that, it was a mental challenge."

rugbyunion,3aau0h,peekay427,7,Thu Jun 18 22:19:32 2015 UTC,"That's not quite how hakas work.  NZ does Ka Mate for most games. Then for special games or games of high importance we pull out Kapa o Pango.  Kapa o Pango was first introduced in 2005 because Ka Mate is a national haka really, used by anyone and everyone. Kapa o Pango was a specially made haka for the All Blacks."
rugbyunion,3aau0h,AndydaAlpaca,8,Fri Jun 19 09:59:52 2015 UTC,"I doubt they're going to introduce a new Haka. The Kapa O Pango is only a few years old as it is. I'd prefer them to just change between the Ka Mate and Kapa O Pango as they feel is appropriate, honestly, much like they did in 2011."
rugbyunion,3aau0h,temalyen,2,Thu Jun 18 23:17:17 2015 UTC,"I grew up with Ka Mate whenever I was able to catch an All Blacks game, so here's hoping that's what they pick for Argentina."

rugbyunion,3acyu2,AJayZa,2,Fri Jun 19 09:40:07 2015 UTC,Rebels are once again the only privately owned team in australia.   The previous private owners gave the team to the VRU a couple of years ago.  All of the other teams are owned by the state unions
rugbyunion,3acyu2,strewthcobber,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:38:37 2015 UTC,So why do this again? Is it the ARU's current financial position causing it? Why didnt the VRU hold onto it?
rugbyunion,3acyu2,MethylRed,2,Fri Jun 19 11:16:01 2015 UTC,"The Rebels lose a lot of money each year. The ARU believes it is better to insulate itself from potential (and likely) financial losses by allowing private ownership. The VRU is also much smaller than the other unions so they are not in a position to support a loss making franchise.   Private ownership of the Rebels is a good thing. The new owners will believe there is a potential to eventually turn the franchise into a profit maker, but if they don't and the company goes bankrupt or can not support the team, then the ownership would revert back to the ARU.  For what it is worth, I know one of the original owners and board members - one of the original investors when the team was set up. He dropped more than 2 million dollars of his own money into the team and left with nothing. I hope these new owners can make the team sustainable, but it will be tough."

I didn't realize how much 41 players is when you put all the names together , thought a couple less players would have to miss out. looks like it covers everything.  Don't think they're looking into Lowe too much from what I've heard, but that's pretty similar if not exactly what I'd go for."
rugbyunion,3accey,fernta,3,Fri Jun 19 03:45:57 2015 UTC,"Vito's had a great season and can play at 6 or 8, which means he's cover for Read who is a constant concussion concern.  I think it's vital that he goes, actually.  Obviously McCaw has pedigree to spare at 7, but 4 of your Loose Fwds have played 6 all year which isn't brilliant.  Might be early for Ioane, A. Savea might slip in ahead of him.  I expect Luatua to get his surgery.  Finally, Tawera Kerr-Barlow has been selected in the past and he's just started to play again;  wouldn't be too surprising unless the form he's shown is awful.  This is more of a ""what I think might happen"" than a ""what I want to happen"" though;  they're all well behind Smith & Perenara at this point.  100% agreed on every other call."

Also i don't think Ioane will make it, too raw and flashy at this stage.   One real bolter i wouldn't mind seeing is Reg Goodes over Moody. Moody is a coach favourite but he has never really impressed and Goodes has been dynamic for the Hurricanes. His ability to cover hooker also helps given that is one of the problem positions."

Sticking to the older/usual group might be a safe bet. (e.g carter/barrett at 10, Nonu/Smith/SBW/Dagg/Savea backline)   I mean, plugging in Sopoaga (don't get me wrong, he's brilliant this season) might prove costly/trial and error/testing if he goes right in, into the WC first 15.  Likewise for the new faces, Lowe, Naholo, Skudder... I think they have been consistent and brilliant; outshining the usual XV ABs but would management be going for consistency/newblood or someone who knows the in and out of their strategy?"
rugbyunion,3accey,sdre,-1,Fri Jun 19 04:40:12 2015 UTC,Tevita Li better be there. As well as Sopoaga and skudder and akira. Otherwise shouldn't be many surprises. SBW will probably be there just as cover for Nonu and I'm betting DC will start with super sub Barrett. I wonder if fekitoa will get much game time after the pool matches. Hmmmm.... also; 1 x Savea or 2 x Savea?
rugbyunion,3accey,BoatCat,10,Fri Jun 19 02:18:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put Tevita Li in at the moment. You'd have to have Lowe, Naholo and Milner-Skudder ahead of him at outside back. He's definitely talented, but it's a position the ABs are stacked in.  Sopoago I don't see coming in on a WC year ahead of experienced first fives like DC, Slade or Barrett. Akira may well be, but I'm not sure! I don't see Hansen picking much new blood on a WC year.

rugbyunion,3adcmd,PetevonPete,2,Sat Jun 20 05:27:00 2015 UTC,Team GB put out a criteria that you have to play in I think the World Series to be available for selection which basically rules out any Northern Irish players unless Ireland qualify for the Olympics.

I'm not familiar with what incident he's referring to.   Teams moving away from roll is more of a strategy thing. When I clear someone from a ruck, my body keeps the next person from entering. A roll does not do that. If I can move someone out by chopping his arms instead of rolling him, we gain a numbers advantage rather than just resetting the equation with a roll."

It is a different enough game that you can't just drop straight in (which is why I want any ABs who want to play in Rio playing most, if not all, of the 7s series).  Then again, if those players you mention were willing to go to a few tournaments to see how they go, then they could be worth a look. I do think Nonu would be out of the reckoning though. He's playing better than ever despite losing some of his pace and explosive power and I just can't see him quite keeping up.

But while there were a couple of big guys out wide back then, none had the sheer power, pace, and ability to devastate the opposition like Lomu. He was a force of nature, a nightmare to try to stop whether he was going around his opposite number, or charging through a crowded midfield. He was such a magnet for opposing defenders that he was increasingly used to draw in numbers, creating space elsewhere following a quick recycle. And this was all while coping with an illness which often kept him bed-ridden between games and which would ultimately curtail his career. The man was a phenom, plain and simple."
rugbyunion,3a9d27,ConspicuousPineapple,6,Thu Jun 18 08:57:14 2015 UTC,Sad to think he probably never got to reach his full potential because of his illness.
rugbyunion,3a9d27,Shadowing_Lemma,4,Thu Jun 18 10:36:59 2015 UTC,"For sure. No probably about it, either. Apparently his illness really started to hit after the 1995 World Cup when he was only 19/20."

rugbyunion,3a9d27,I_will_remember_this,3,Thu Jun 18 08:34:50 2015 UTC,Exactly. It was also not really the norm to put a giant on the wing. Most teams would've played him at lock or 8.

rugbyunion,3a9d27,Nine-Foot-Banana,3,Thu Jun 18 09:45:24 2015 UTC,That's true. I was lucky enough to see the British Lions (they were called that back then) against North Auckland in Whangarei in 1993 and Counties secondary schools played the curtain raiser. Lomu played 8 and scored 5 tries

He's still the most effective player I've ever seen play rugby. It's a great shame his career went the way it did."
rugbyunion,3a9d27,threalseymourskinner,6,Thu Jun 18 08:38:04 2015 UTC,Lomu was 19 at the time.

Who would the player really be listening to in that scenario? The gaffer, or the guy who you know will be the gaffer sooner rather than later...   Still a little surprised Tana is going for it, but I can imagine he was able to demand a lot of freedom given the desperation of the Blues."

Dependent on how the 'Canes go in the semis and final, I'd have him in the ABs run on 15 at either 14 or 15 with Ben Smith in the other slot. You can't ignore that sort of form."
rugbyunion,3abeu5,UndeniableWit,3,Fri Jun 19 01:05:09 2015 UTC,"His best position is fullback, and we already have Ben Smith, Israel Dagg, and Piutau. But the fact that he covers wing well might make him an option, especially since Jane is having injury troubles."
rugbyunion,3abeu5,Mutant321,4,Thu Jun 18 20:30:27 2015 UTC,"He would be a horrible bench player for the opposition. Just when you're starting to tire, he comes on and starts dancing around.     What's his kicking out of hand like? And defensively, is he strong?"
rugbyunion,3abeu5,Mutant321,7,Thu Jun 18 20:52:01 2015 UTC,"Pretty solid in both respects, but probably needs work. One thing NZ rugby has been really good at in recent years is moulding talent into well-rounded players (Savea is probably the best example), so hopefully he gets better with time."
rugbyunion,3abeu5,lapsuscalumni,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:34:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed, although Piutau might not be seeing the team depending on how the higher ups feel about him leaving NZRU for Ulster.

rugbyunion,3abeu5,pizzalord_,2,Fri Jun 19 05:13:55 2015 UTC,"As you said, he'd be a hell of a 23, same as Barrett but at fb or wing, he would absolutely kill tired defenders.

rugbyunion,3abeu5,sackrace,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:55:04 2015 UTC,Surely they'd at least have him in the wider training group? Maybe blood him in some of the earlier matches?  He's been fantastic all year.

Especially taking into Account Smith and Dagg's form. Definitely the WTG, sure, but he shouldn't be given game time. Maybe Rugby Championship or early RWC rounds, and definitely 2016 onwards, but right now is not the time to be last line of defense in the most important ABs year since 2011.

Ultimately, however, we really need to make it out of the group to try and gain any sort of respect on the world stage. The Six Nations was just fucking embarrassing and I'm sure the team would be keen on putting that to rights."
rugbyunion,3ab058,kingofglasgow,3,Thu Jun 18 20:29:35 2015 UTC,That is exactly what I meant: Win the first two games with our best 15 (or near enough) rest them against SA and then have them fresh for Samoa.  I can't believe we will be as bad as in the Six Nations surely...

From 9 outwards they have a very strong team. Halfbacks are good. Backs are very good. But their pack isn't up to scratch (with a few notable exceptions) and they really struggled against Italy, England and Ireland in February.   Unfortunately I don't think USA have the forwards to turn the screw on them, as you're in a similar position (backs are stronger than your forwards, with one or two exceptions).  For my money Scotland are favourites to progress to the next round. From a US perspective I think you could definitely beat Samoa and Japan. I actually think Pool B is the tightest to call as there are a ton of match ups which could go either way."

It's a bit scary to see the team lead by the Wallabies backs coach doing so little with ball in hand compared to Jake White. At least at their best under White the Brumbies would use their spoiling tactics at the ruck, good forward pack, and strong kicking to get within 30m of the opposition line with the ball before unleashing the backs to usually pretty devastating effect.  They've obviously had their share of injuries but the attack just looks almost lost at times now and there is an absurd amount of kicking at times."

rugbyunion,3abtp6,Happyjacks1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:09:35 2015 UTC,"if you look at Overtimeathletes it gives many drills and programs to help improve your speed, acceleration, vertical, power etc."
rugbyunion,3abtp6,Shadowing_Lemma,2,Fri Jun 19 02:37:23 2015 UTC,"There are a number of things you can do to work on acceleration and top-end speed. What did the sprint training entail? For your position, I'd worry less about top-end speed and more about the speed with which you are able to engage your muscles for short-bursts at high-intensity. Here are a few weight-based suggestions which can help build that explosive strength:   Double-pause squats: Take it into the hole, hold for two seconds; come out of the hole, hold for 2 seconds; back to upright. For each post-pause movement, try to explode upwards, while maintaining control.  Half-squat jumps: Down until your thighs are approximately parallel with the floor; explode upwards; as you land, go straight into the next squat.  1/4 squat jumps: On the balls of your feet; down until thighs are ~ 45 degrees; explode upwards; as you land, go straight into the next movement.  Single leg press Squat jumps with dumbells Bent-knee hip raises using a smith machine   EDIT - All the squats should be done with weights. I'd imagine this is obvious, but thought I'd point it out, just in case  Every extension needs to be explosive. The more you can get into the habit of rapid extension, the more readily it'll come when you need it outside the gym. Don't forget to mix up your muscle recruitment, too: high weight, low reps for fast-twitch fibres, low weight, high reps for slow-twitch fibres (I'm generalising a bit, of course).  In terms of tackling, look to your movement and technique. As /u/rugby_fc says, be on your toes and move forward into the tackle. If you don't give yourself momentum, you'll not knock them back without recruiting a lot of muscle power. Your leg strength is obviously good, so if you get moving and get your technique right, you shouldn't have a problem. If you're having to wrestle them to the ground, then you might not be going to ground yourself, you may be too high in the tackle, you might not be wrapping your arms properly... Just remember the old adage - if you take their legs, they can't run. You should also realise that not everyone makes big, smashing hits, and that's fine. As long as you make the tackle, you're golden.    To improve foot speed, sure, get a ladder and look up some drills. But you can also go really basic by using whatever objects to mark out a grid/line of stations/whatever as a coach would with cones. In each section, give yourself something specific to do: sprint 3m, short-step backtrack 1m; close-proximity slalom; high knees; etc. When you're in training, try to stay on the balls of your feet and, unless you're doing a static drill (line-out, etc.) always keep your feet moving."
rugbyunion,3abtp6,rugby_fc,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:54:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm by no means an expert but here's my advice:   Firstly just wanna say some good weight to be shifting on your compounds! Sprint speed- are you slow for a prop or just compared to others? Technique is a major factor but you've done training so that won't be the issue. Then it's all about explosiveness, keep squatting, box jumps, hill/beach sprints, really focus on driving your legs forward when running and push off the ground (sprinting is probably my main asset haha). In terms of falling over, core exercises to increase your balance and I suspect you're leaning forward quite  far to get rid of low tacklers. Focus instead on a hand off or bend your knees to get low and drive upwards not down. Tackling- important that you dominate. Stay on your toes ensure you're moving towards them and ensure the shoulder is part of the hit, then wrap the arms and drive with your legs and lift the attacker to stop his drive.   Hope this can be helpful (if I'm wrong someone please  correct me)!"
rugbyunion,3abtp6,beesolomona,2,Thu Jun 18 22:11:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks; I'm quite proud of my gym performance :) . TBH I'm not that slow compared to a big prop, but I'm not big enough to be as slow as I am. That is, I'm one of the slowest on the team as we don't have any big players. At 85kg I'm the heaviest... I used to play No. 8 because my acceleration was decent (I could knock over a flanker with ease) but my top speed was dismal. I haven't been doing box jumps so I'll take that advice on board immediately! Accurate! I do tend to lean forward and downwards to knock them into the ground. Usually they try to tackle me really low so I've found it effective to knock them off but it's impossible to stay up (And I definitely don't have the agility to avoid them). Maybe the key is with the fend to keep them at arms length. I do sit on my heels a lot in defence. It's a result of having players run around me and having to dive to make the tackle. I think the key here is the leg drive. Any recommendations to increase speed of the leg drive (I know speed ladders are supposed to be good.)   Thanks a lot! Really helpful!"

rugbyunion,3abtp6,grizzlez,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:39:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I think it's to do with form. I don't try to lift weight I'm not comfortable with and when I get to about 150 I stop using my legs and it starts to become all lower back. Completely the opposite of how it's supposed to be. I haven't had time to go and correct my form (it would take about 2 weeks of lifting really low weight to correct. Not to mention the effort of stretching every day).  tl;dr my deadlift is low because my form's not great.
rugbyunion,3abtp6,grizzlez,0,Tue Jun 23 17:10:12 2015 UTC,"Not much you can do about pace apart from technique mate, some are just born gifted! With the tackling, even with them trying to go round you look to stay off your heels, diving is fine as you can't smash someone everytime,  sometimes it better just to let them gain an extra yard to ensure you get hold of them and get them down. Leg drive is all about mentality,  as soon as you have hold of them make sure you start pumping them like you're trying to sprint forwards and the strength from lifting should do the rest of the work, especially when you lift their feet slightly off the floor :)"

rugbyunion,3abtp6,NeoVeci,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"As a front row, definitely. But there's this kid on my team (weighs about 65kg) and I've seen him smash (AND I MEAN SMASH) the biggest players on the pitch. No idea how he does it.

rugbyunion,3aaotk,BlackHairedAlbino,2,Thu Jun 18 15:51:55 2015 UTC,"These seem to be a fairly unusual contract - the players are training with Glasgow, but are unlikely to play much for them (similar to an academy player), and a portion of their salary is being paid for by their domestic club.

rugbyunion,3aaotk,some_sort_of_monkey,2,Thu Jun 18 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I'm guessing it's the SRU seeing it as a way of providing relatively cheap injury cover/a way of developing players, whilst the clubs get a player with professional level fitness without paying all their wages."
rugbyunion,3aaotk,FrenchyFungus,2,Thu Jun 18 22:06:42 2015 UTC,That was my guess but I thought you might be able to confirm. I suppose it makes sense.

Secondly, the video goes on about the possibility of having split licensing like we did last world cup. However, multiple games released last year (Rugby 15, and two rugby manager games) had all of the NH teams licensed with no SH teams licensed.   This makes me think the NH licenses are non-exclusive while the SH licenses are exclusively owned by RC3's publishers, meaning RC3 should be fully-licensed, but the other game(s) wont have SH teams licensed."

It's likely that a new Rugby game is in the works, but I doubt it's RC3. Most likely some rep from NZRU has heard of a video game deal, but wouldn't know the full details and probably made a couple assumptions.

SJ is a parasite, and we're probably better off letting his contract expire rather than firing him and having to pay him off.  With Cotter slowly assembling his own coaching staff, and driving some of the SJ people out, I'd rather he stays and finishes off the job.  I doubt SJ is going to be able to order Cotter around, especially now with Hines standing in the background."

Two teams that couldn't beat a team coached by MOC and one that needed extra time and the rugby equivalent of an own-goal to do so. The only question surely is how many try bonus points we garner.

On the other hand, no normal 11 year old would dream of attacking an adult, let alone one with direct authority over them, so the kid obviously has some serious anger issues. He should be helped with those, and not simply punished for them, because just punishing him would only make things worse in the long run. Maybe the best solution would be to give a short term absolute ban, with a longer term ""don't bring your son back to our club until he's willing to sort his anger out"", to try and find a middle option."

I mean, they might be crappy parents (we don't know), but they're still parents. Got to at least try and go through them as much as you can.  I think the most important thing for this is that the decision be made by the parents, club, and school, rather than by some faceless board somewhere that don't know the kid at all. When you're looking at children, the priority should always be to do what's best for them, so really that decision should be made by people in a position to know what that is."

Do you think a kid that is capable of doing this is going to change anytime soon? No. So do you let him play knowing that he is that fucked up and likely to hurt someone? Or do you save some other kids the risk of being anywhere near the little psycho?  Its not the job of rugby to get this kid the help he needs. That's up to the police/social services/parents.  Maybe turning him away from union for good will keep many other kids safe and involved in union that otherwise would not be."

Climate of article  Krasnoyarsk:       Krasnoyarsk experiences a continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with long and very cold winters and short but warm summers. Its climate in July and during the winter is very similar to that of Winnipeg, Canada, which is a good deal further south geographically. The summer is in comparison shorter, and winter is longer compared to the Canadian inland, but peaks are similar. Compared to climates on a similar latitude, Krasnoyarsk has much warmer summers than Aberdeen, Scotland, for example, but much colder and longer winters. The summer is also on average warmer than expected at similar inland latitudes of Scandinavia, due to its much farther inland location.

rugbyunion,3a6bra,Dozzy_X,16,Wed Jun 17 15:57:52 2015 UTC,I'd be pissed off if I was the Cambridge 12.  And the Oxford 12.
rugbyunion,3a6bra,TheCambrian91,3,Wed Jun 17 19:47:43 2015 UTC,agreed. The Varsity match and The Boat Race have always seemed rather pointless to me when they include random 1 year graduate students. It would be much more of a legitimate rivalry if it was undergraduates only.
rugbyunion,3a6bra,Sug4rFree,8,Wed Jun 17 20:08:43 2015 UTC,"But undergraduates aren't the only part of a university. Why should the type of degree you're doing change your eligibility for a sports team?   Bear in mind that in uni rugby there's constantly players coming in and going out, at a much greater rate than in a normal club setting. Every year, there's a possibility that a new fresher could come in and steal a place, and that's just part of it. You don't necessarily have a team that's set for years in the same way you do outside of that setting.  Also, as an aside, both 12s at the last varsity match were postgrads, with the Cambridge 12 being an MPhil student who (I assume) won't be around next year."
rugbyunion,3a6bra,Sug4rFree,3,Wed Jun 17 22:34:34 2015 UTC,"Because I question whether the revenue that the match generates entices the university to accept students purely on the basis of their rugby careers. I think that with students doing 1 year programs, this is more likely to happen. It's the same reason that Ivy league schools in the US agreed decades ago that they wouldn't hand out scholarships for sports.  There's an argument to be made for allowing them, like you said, but with undergraduates it would feel more genuine.  Let's say I've played 4 years for my undergraduate team and I have a real affiliation with that program. Now I go to Oxford for a 1 year art history degree and I'm suddenly eligible to play in the varsity match? It just takes away from the tradition for me.  Edit: grammar"
rugbyunion,3a6bra,Sug4rFree,5,Wed Jun 17 22:47:34 2015 UTC,"But to take that approach basically says to sportspeople ""Hey, don't bother seeking higher education, you won't be allowed to play anyway"". I mean, do you think a fresher undergrad should be allowed in the team? They've not put anything into the squad, they're just rocking up and trying to get in, so they're exactly the same as a postgrad doing a 1 year masters.   If you're concerned about students being picked purely for sports, I get that, but that should be dealt with in some other way than banning anyone but undergrads from competing. After all, there's nothign in that rule that prevents undergrads from being selected based purely on whether they were in professional team's youth programs, or even older undergrads who have already had a professional career. While there might be a concern there, the answer is surely not to arbitrarily limit participation, but instead should be to police the problematic practices themselves?"
rugbyunion,3a6bra,Sug4rFree,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"huh? It just means that you have to meet the University's academic standards first. Then if you can make the team, you can. Ivy League schools still have extremely good sports programs. The students just didn't get in because of their sporting ability."
rugbyunion,3a6bra,Sug4rFree,2,Wed Jun 17 23:02:49 2015 UTC,But you're suggesting that anyone but undergrads should be banned from competing for the university. Someone who got in for a masters or PhD has met the academic standards just as much as someone there for a BA.
rugbyunion,3a6bra,kitd,0,Wed Jun 17 23:05:24 2015 UTC,not sure about that. It's a HELL of a lot easier to get into Harvard's masters in teaching program than it is to get into their undergraduate program.
rugbyunion,3a6bra,b00n,4,Wed Jun 17 23:08:21 2015 UTC,"Well frankly that's not the point. What the academic standard is isn't as relevant as whether it was met. If a sportsperson has to reach the same academic standard to get in as anyone else applying for the same course, isn't that all that matters?   Also, masters courses aren't the only postgraduate degrees either. I'm currently playing in a team with a PhD student who's been at the college for something around a decade over various courses. Are you suggesting he shouldn't be allowed to compete because it's somehow easier to get into a PhD course at Cambridge than a BA? Also, what about those postgrads who are just ordinary sportspeople, not professionals, who work hard to break into a team in a short amount of time and really commit to their uni or college? Why should they not be allowed to compete?"
rugbyunion,3a6bra,RugbyAndBeer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:20:02 2015 UTC,"I see your point but to me, there should be a cut off somewhere. Like i mentioned earlier, I think undergraduates have stronger ties to their institution than graduates. It might be a personal thing but that's how I feel."
rugbyunion,3a6bra,b00n,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:26:40 2015 UTC,"This is also true of Oxbridge though. I don't know about rugby, but I do know about rowing. Top oarsmen are actually advised not to mention their rowing on the application because the interviewers will assume they'll just spend all day on the river (even if they are right!). And I know of one world-class NZ oarsman who would have walked into the rowing squad but failed to get in because, though bright, he wasn't ""Oxbridge"" bright.  Even those who do get in are regularly reminded of their academic commitments. Tutors will give them some leeway in the build up to the Varsity match or Boat Race, but after that, they're expected to make up for lost time. And many are expected not to compete in their final years."
rugbyunion,3a6bra,GeorgeOD,2,Thu Jun 18 11:37:36 2015 UTC,"The Cambridge 12 last year is now doing a PhD but he is actually a 10 and was at the Racing academy for a year or two before stopping. The 10 last year is actually a 9 who grew up with willie le roux & morne steyn (still great friends) but he can play 10 whilst the capt. could only really play 9 (but was pretty good). What I think will happen is this they'll go back to their usual positions with 9, 10, 12 being the saffer, the speciality fly half and roberts. Would be a killer back line."

They were supposed to (and did) tour every 2yrs. However, IRB later changed their schedule to only give them a tour every four years. This change meant they couldn't achieve their second goal ($$$), so Samoa pulled out. Without Samoa, the team couldn't continue."

rugbyunion,3a50bf,metompkin,2,Wed Jun 17 16:55:31 2015 UTC,"The defender knew where the ball was going, its just a higher percentage play to wait for the other bloke to catch it and knock him over than to compete for the ball.

rugbyunion,3a4jka,4Tenacious_Dee4,4,Wed Jun 17 19:07:41 2015 UTC,"38.. Just helped lead the bulls as their VC to their worst season in living memory.    Damn, they were top of the RSA log before they left overseas. And then Matfield didn't really play.   I'm not saying he's the best, but he's in the top 5 locks in RSA, not counting the other injuries."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,batzman,7,Wed Jun 17 10:33:40 2015 UTC,"Top 5? Wow really? All he has is his line out. He's hardly seen around the field, far to slow and old now"
rugbyunion,3a4jka,4Tenacious_Dee4,5,Wed Jun 17 11:04:28 2015 UTC,"With Lood De Jager and Pieter-Steph Du Toit injured, the locks are spread pretty thin for us, especially line-out specialists."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Dom24,-7,Wed Jun 17 11:24:14 2015 UTC,"And how influential is a lineout anyway? Lineout steals happen so rarely now they are almost a thing of the past, and cannot be the attribute of a great player, more that of the lucky opportunist.   So to look at the skills that remain it basically means catching a lineout ball. Big woop that is. It just means that you're competent at what you are being paid professionally to be able to do.   Fuck the traditional no.5, I say! Why must that lock call the lineouts anyway? I would trust Etzebeth with calling the lineouts and stick a versatile fetcher like Jaco Kriel in at no.5."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,penguin_bro,6,Wed Jun 17 12:37:31 2015 UTC,I don't think you're giving enough credit to the depth of line outs.
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Dom24,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:23:35 2015 UTC,Na man. He jumps at 2 he jumps at 4. Everyone has to know the calls anyway he's just the guy who makes the call.

rugbyunion,3a4jka,ptashark,0,Thu Jun 18 07:34:42 2015 UTC,That whole  comment is idiotic.
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Dom24,-1,Sun Jun 28 04:39:11 2015 UTC,"but he's in the top 5 locks in RSA    Yes, so you've established that he plays no.5 lock in this country? I can't tell if your comment is sarcastic."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,4Tenacious_Dee4,2,Wed Jun 17 12:27:12 2015 UTC,"A world cup squad has 4 locks, so Matfield is definitely in contention."

rugbyunion,3a4jka,afunky,4,Thu Jun 18 14:55:03 2015 UTC,The boks always look stunned when underdogs really show up and play out of their skins:   To be fair every favourite looks that way when it happens - see the looks on the All Blacks faces during the loss to France at the 199 RWC
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Meshkent,4,Thu Jun 18 01:10:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know so much about your point wrt ""off form"" players. Fourie is with little doubt the best experienced number 9 SA has available. Sure, a guy like Faf has lots of potential, but you don't put an uncapped guy like that in to a World Cup.   With Matfield, he's definately the best 5 we have, given the injuries to the younger guys. I agree he's not as good as he used to be, but set piece is vital in Europe, and we need Matfield.   JP I haven't seen much of this year - but luckily we have quite a few other options."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Typhon13,2,Thu Jun 18 07:31:59 2015 UTC,No need to cap Faf yet surely with Reinach and Hougaard around? Not that I think they should get preference over du Preez is he is fit enough.
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Meshkent,3,Fri Jun 19 04:12:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He should be given a chance after the world cup, as a long term solution to 9. (Fourie will surely retire after this WC?).   Hougaard isn't a backside's scrumhalf. He's a good impact player with x-factor at wing, but I wouldn't even have him in the squad. Reinach doesn't have the necessary tactical nous or the kicking game for test rugby, least of all in European conditions.   Pienaar is our second best 9 after Fourie."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,4Tenacious_Dee4,4,Fri Jun 19 07:27:13 2015 UTC,"Pienaar is our second best 9 after Fourie.    In Europe I tend to agree. I'm not liking it, but it's true."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Meshkent,3,Fri Jun 19 09:47:45 2015 UTC,"Lambie? He's probably third in the pecking order right now, after Pollard and Morne Steyn."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Dom24,2,Fri Jun 19 07:29:02 2015 UTC,"If you were paying attention last year you will have noticed that Heyneke Meyer was getting settled with a 2 flyhalf game. Pollard until the 50th and Lambie to finish off. It proved to be a very clinical combo. (Remember Lambie's 50+ meter penalty to beat the AB's?) But Pollard is inconsistent and inexperienced in the wet conditions and when Pollard has a bad day he REALLY has a bad day.  I believe in this truncated champions cup Heyneke will start Steyn and give him a chance to show he's still a big game winner. It's really a conservative guess if you think about it. Meyer is Steyn's biggest fan and it's the least he can do. That being said, Steyn is predictable and this is 2015. If other teams are shrewd with giving away penalties in their own half he's a toothless prospect.   It's good that we have such talent in flyhalf but I beleive Lambie is the only one with the composure to win the world cup. He THRIVES in big games and he is a leader, an IMMENSELY respectable character, and the sort of player the team would rally behind."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Meshkent,2,Fri Jun 19 08:24:03 2015 UTC,"Remember the two fantastic tries Pollard scored in that same game? Pollard scored 19 points that day, Lambie scored 3. Sure, it was a crucial 3, but Lambie would never have had the chance to kick the winning penalty had Pollard not scored two good tries. (One of which was a sublime individual try).   I'm mostly agreed with you, though. Lambie certainly has BMT, he's just not in great form at the moment. Honestly, I'd pick Steyn over him on current form. (And I was in full froth a few years ago when Lambie was so hot and Steyn was out of form, yet HM was still picking Steyn).   We need three fly-halves, and Lambie is one of them, sure. I really just don't know how you can list Lambie - on current form - as one of the reasons the Boks will win the WC. He's not even going to start, and there's no way he's as good - again, on current form - as the AB 10s likely to play."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Dom24,2,Fri Jun 19 09:12:23 2015 UTC,"You're just as fickle as the SA media. Lambie is the Dan Carter of South African rugby. Pollard doesn't play well all the time and the bulls have fucking sucked balls this year.   Don't bash Lambie's form. He hasn't played in the last three months. World cup rugby is different. Pollard is great on his day but so is Lambie. Lambie offers consistency and calmness. Thats what you need for 3 big games in a row, providing we get past the pool stage."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Meshkent,2,Fri Jun 19 09:19:14 2015 UTC,"To parrot HM for a second, I'm loyal to form, not a player.   The Sharks have been atrocious this year - much worse than the Bulls - and there is just no way Lambie is in good form. I'm not saying Pollard is perfect, nor am I say Lambie is terrible, I'm saying Pollard is in better form than Lambie. (And Steyn is arguably in better form than both - but that's a difficult comparison to make).   Comparing Lambie to DC is absolutely crazy, in no way are they players of equal stature. At no point in his career has Lambie been the best FH in the world, let alone the standard-setter for nearly a decade."

rugbyunion,3a4jka,fettsack,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:09:57 2015 UTC,"Lambie will definitely get a start, they need to see how he recovered from the neck injury. I wouldn't be surprised if all three guys gets at least one test to start to show us in what shape they are."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Dom24,13,Mon Jun 22 08:42:22 2015 UTC,Why they will:   -Massive and powerfull pack.  -Smart and efficient backs.  -Handré Pollard if at his best  Why they won't:  -If they don't have De Villiers they'll miss out on control and leadership.  -The Sharks had a poor season and it doesn't put their players in a good position.

Beast of a forward pack, bound to out muscle teams.   Won't   Ridiculous quota system.  Have the odd player who will give away a grubby penalty. Without De Villiers they don't seem to have much leadership."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,I4gotmyothername,4,Fri Jun 19 17:39:10 2015 UTC,Who are the quota players?
rugbyunion,3a4jka,4Tenacious_Dee4,10,Wed Jun 17 11:46:59 2015 UTC,"here's a feb '15 article on it  heres the squad against Wales in November. 1   Tendai Mtwarira 2   Bismarck du Plessis 3   Coenie Oosthuizen 4   Eben Etzebeth 5   Victor Matfield 6   Marcell Coetzee 7   Teboho Mohoje 8   Duane Vermeulen 9   Cobus Reinach 10  Pat Lambie 11  Lwazi Mvovo 12  Jean de Villiers 13  Jan Serfontein 14  Cornal Hendricks 15  Willie le Roux  Replacements Pos Player  Team 16  Adriaan Strauss  17  Trevor Nyakane 18  Julian Redelinghuys  19  Lood de Jager 20  Nizaam Carr  21  Francois Hougaard 22  Handre Pollard 23  Damian de Allende  In that list there are exactly 7 non-white players (De Allende is coloured right?), but remember that Alberts was injured and Louw isn't there so Mohoje wouldn't usually be in the team list.  So with 0 injuries it will affect us. But then also think what happens if De Allende gets injured, we would be forced to bring in JP over JJ or even newcomers like Harold Vorster.  Also think about new up and coming players like Jaco Kriel, Jesse Kriel, Burger Odendaal, Harold Vorster,Renaldo Bothma. For them to earn a Springbok cap now becomes exceedingly difficult since there are already white incumbents such as Coetzee, Alberts, Louw, JDV who will be nigh on impossible to budge but then the bench-replacements have to be black.  We're getting pretty close to naturally meeting this quota but sometimes it will hurt our team. There's plenty of black talent in the country, but forcing the system week in week out will be damaging"
rugbyunion,3a4jka,4Tenacious_Dee4,3,Wed Jun 17 05:47:26 2015 UTC,"Bothma is Namibian, but I see your point. I think Jacques Du Plessis would be a monster and inject the youth we need in the forwards."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,4Tenacious_Dee4,3,Wed Jun 17 07:57:39 2015 UTC,didn't know that :(  I liked Jacques a lot last year but he didn't seem to be stamping his mark on games this year like he should be. I could be wrong though - I didn't watch too many Bulls games this year. Anyway with him heading up to Montpelier next year I doubt he'll be able to make a Springbok squad. Don't think any uncapped overseas players have made it into the boks before?
rugbyunion,3a4jka,4Tenacious_Dee4,3,Wed Jun 17 13:53:25 2015 UTC,"None really. But we said the same before the cricket world cup, and that turned out well."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,VlermuisVermeulen,-2,Wed Jun 17 15:56:40 2015 UTC,"Philander was not a quota player. He was one of our best bowlers, just out of form."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,cross-eye-bear,16,Wed Jun 17 19:14:29 2015 UTC,"He wasn't going to be selected for the game, and then politics forced him into playing. If that's not quota, then what is?"
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Typhon13,6,Wed Jun 17 10:34:21 2015 UTC,"I use to sit watching rugby at Stellenbosch res. When a black guy dropped the ball he was called a quota player. If a white guy did the same or worst, it was said it was part of the game. Are you one of those guys who actually believe Philanda lost us the world cup? Despite us losing twice before."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,wn_,12,Wed Jun 17 10:37:06 2015 UTC,"Abbot would've played (who was on form), but then politics happened. I'm hoping this stays out of rugby.  Stop avoiding the issue by attacking a straw man."

Terrific modern record against NH teams playing in the NH. They've also won a RWC in the NH in 2007. Players. World class talent and game winners in Bismarck, Vermeulen, Pollard, Lambie, etc. Will genuinely threaten AB's.   Won't:   Quarter Final. Tough QF against Eng / Wales / Aus. Centres. JdV is injured and hasn't had much time on the green. Steyn not favoured by Meyer. Potential pick de Allende has highest missed tackle count in this Super season (closely followed by JdJ).  Older players. Meyer's preference to pick experience over form could ultimately hurt against high tempo teams (Matfield, J. Smith, Pienaar)."

rugbyunion,3a4jka,Dom24,8,Wed Jun 17 19:09:43 2015 UTC,"Why they will:   Have the forwards to dominate anyone Pedigree and pride Willie Le Roux and Handre Pollard x-factor in the backs   Why they won't:   If England, Ireland or NZ front up, the Springbok backline probably won't compensate and win a game on their own.

rugbyunion,3a4jka,daieou,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:47:26 2015 UTC,England haven't beaten SA since 2006.  Why would they suddenly have a chance now?
rugbyunion,3a4jka,daieou,0,Fri Jun 19 23:16:48 2015 UTC,"Willie Le Roux looked dismal this season, prior to his injury. He also seems to gets visibly upset with his teammates when things don't go right for him. I'm not sure if I would bother persisting with Willie when Jesse Kriel has been playing such a game. I think Willie did well because he was new to the scene, but people know his jump-step thing now and he was rather ineffectual the last 2-3 games for SA.  Jesse Kriel could have that same impact on the scene, juding by his talents. I think he could be the dark horse of the Springboks RWC campaign. Secret/not-so-secret weapon."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,sdfdsize,4,Wed Jun 17 10:45:42 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with you about Jesse Kriel, as well as Willie's attitude. There is a lot of talk about Milner Skudder, and rightfully so, but Jesse is just as exciting in my books. Hope he gets a place in the World Cup squad!  But I still feel Willie will work wonders behind a winning pack and halfback pairing. His experience and game management, while not on Percy Montgomery's level, is still very good and crucial in a world cup. Even if he is well marked, it'll give space to other players."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,4Tenacious_Dee4,2,Mon Jun 22 18:49:32 2015 UTC,"Ya sure. He is also a great support player. As in, he runs after the guy in his team who has the ball! Which the boks aren't so sharp with always. He can sense when something is on. I just hope if he is to play in the big games this RWC, that the mindset of the coaches hasn't changed and he is still given carte blanche with attack."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,Dom24,2,Fri Jun 19 08:35:03 2015 UTC,he runs after the guy in his team who has the ball   That really is a skill! Some players are just always there to take that pass. Not me though.  The EOY tour made me worry about Willie a bit though. I hope that system shock was good for him.
rugbyunion,3a4jka,4Tenacious_Dee4,2,Fri Jun 19 08:51:30 2015 UTC,"It seems funny but with the lofty forwards we have huffing and puffing their way around the park in 1st gear, it's a worthy observation.   But I do agree with you about how he needed to be shown his attack needs to be more unpredictable."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,dijano,2,Fri Jun 19 08:55:45 2015 UTC,I do too! I think Jesse is a future Bok star. He made more of an impression on me than Pollard did when they played in the respective JWC's
rugbyunion,3a4jka,dijano,3,Fri Jun 19 08:58:49 2015 UTC,why they will:  -Forward pack that can dominate   -Very effective at playing world cup winning rugby. ie forward domination turning into 3 points  -Pollard and Vermeulen at their best tear teams apart.  Why they wont:  -Sticking to old big names rather than playing on form players  -lack of leadership(JdV)  -Possibility of chocking against a big name team.

rugbyunion,3a4jka,Dom24,0,Sun Jun 21 09:49:08 2015 UTC,"Ya, 2007/2006 was actually a woeful time for flyhalf for SA. Luckily Butch played the best rugby of his life that RWC and was the undoubtebly best FH of the comp.   SA flyhalves are great. to think we still have Goosen in the wings and Elton Jantjies whom I've never been a big fan of, but who seems to have come into his own this season and matured to be a great commander of an attacking game.   Pollard blows hot and cold though. I don't know if I could put my money on him to show up."

rugbyunion,3a4jka,jbmass,5,Wed Jun 17 10:40:15 2015 UTC,He was a man amongst boys at last years u20WC. Won junior world player of the year easily. Very promising player
rugbyunion,3a4jka,10acious,2,Fri Jun 19 08:51:12 2015 UTC,You know who also made a huge impact at u20 world cup? Peirre Spies. And we all know what a huge failure he was and is in my opinion. Just because he was amazing at the juniour WC doesnt mean that he can replicate that at the top level.
rugbyunion,3a4jka,jbmass,2,Fri Jun 19 08:53:56 2015 UTC,"Well a few things,   1) While Pierre Spies 'had a huge impact', Pollard was awarded the actual title of best Junior player in the world.  2) Spies was a standout at junior level because he was bigger and faster than everyone, which didn't translate well to senior rugby. Pollard, as well as being big and fast, is a clever footballer and legit playmaking first five.   3) Pollard his already replicated his form at the top level, his debut came in the form of South Africas 50 point drubbing of Scotland. Then he started 5 of 6 games in the Rugby Championship, including running the cutter against the All Blacks, scoring two tries and kicking a further nine points to hand NZ their first defeat in 22 matches."
rugbyunion,3a4jka,jbmass,2,Wed Jun 17 11:55:46 2015 UTC,Very good points. I dont think he isn't a good player. The only question mark over his head is whether he can consistently replicate good form. One game he is spitting fire and the next week I would rather have the Greek (who I can't stand BTW) at flyhalf
rugbyunion,3a4jka,ptashark,0,Wed Jun 17 11:58:15 2015 UTC,Please think about what you're saying cape7. You make me want to be sick in my mouth.

rugbyunion,3a4jka,Floee,4,Sat Jun 20 13:30:49 2015 UTC,Fourie du Preez bossed the 2007 RWC. Could've had a one-legged blind man and fly-half and still would've looked good.

We should place our expectations as low as they can go and focus on the Pro12.   Edit: I was really hoping we'd be able to blame this year coming on Matt too, but alas..."

I think Bath and Toulon are more likely to put a rake of points on Treviso than on Wasps than Leinster would be, which would put us at a disadvantage.  It's a fine draw. We played those teams last year, none managed to beat us in normal time and it could have gone either way in the semi to Toulon.   No fear."

rugbyunion,3a5b4s,harblstuff,3,Wed Jun 17 13:01:07 2015 UTC,I think Toulon should automatically be tier 1 since they're defending champions.  I know the tiers are based on league position but it's strange that the champions could potentially be seeded lower than top

rugbyunion,3a5deg,BleachPlotHole,8,Wed Jun 17 10:36:04 2015 UTC,"Two years ago, I would not have hesitated to say Greg Inglis. But he will be 29 years old before the start of next season, so he would only have a couple years in the game. Same deal with Slater, Cronk, Thurston etc.  Now, I'm going to go for a left-field pick and say Sione Mata’utia. Outside backs normally go best at transitioning from League to Union, and this guy looks like the real deal. Him or Valentine Holmes.  Obviously New Zealanders and Poms were not considered."
rugbyunion,3a5deg,Bangkok_Dave,4,Wed Jun 17 10:49:35 2015 UTC,"I quite like David Klemmer, I could see him as a great lock."
rugbyunion,3a5deg,R8_D8_8_ATE_M8,2,Wed Jun 17 11:09:40 2015 UTC,Id want Thurston just to watch him kick goals.
rugbyunion,3a5deg,yehthesquirt,7,Wed Jun 17 22:49:27 2015 UTC,"First pick has to be Inglis, even though he's getting pretty old he is still one of the most dominant mungo's and I think would transition very well into a multitude of positions in the real game.   Special mention to Eels backrower Tepai Moeroa, Aus schoolboy centre for two years believe and absolutely dominant at schoolboy level for Newington College. Union missed out on a great player when he went to the dark side."
rugbyunion,3a5deg,sandollars,7,Wed Jun 17 11:33:26 2015 UTC,Jarryd Hayne could fit into the no. 13 jersey for Fiji.

rugbyunion,3a5deg,LouisB1991,13,Thu Jun 18 00:18:11 2015 UTC,Sam Burgess. I just think he could make a massive statement in a union shirt. Probably start him at 12 an then move him to blind side flanker
rugbyunion,3a5deg,RipShtick,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:35:17 2015 UTC,...As in to the Super Rugby comp? Because he's been playing for Bath Rugby in England.

rugbyunion,3a5deg,Jaeger999,8,Wed Jun 17 15:13:38 2015 UTC,Shaun Johnson. I would put him at First Five.
rugbyunion,3a5deg,rhydianl,5,Wed Jun 17 10:39:06 2015 UTC,"Would be the same deal as Benji IMO, can run, can't tackle, can't grasp union tactics."
rugbyunion,3a5deg,da_gan,7,Wed Jun 17 12:00:49 2015 UTC,"He can tackle just as good as any union 1st five. I'd say the only problem would be him coming to grasps with union tactics. He's a playmaker in a sport with different rules, patterns and variations etc so he'd be a bit lost there. I'd imagine him out wide somewhere. I wouldn't want him to come to union anyway as I'm a huge fan of him playing the league code. Definitely my favourite player to watch."
rugbyunion,3a5deg,admartian,2,Wed Jun 17 13:24:20 2015 UTC,You could probably get away sticking him on the wings.  Dude is a burner.

rugbyunion,3a5deg,Jaeger999,3,Wed Jun 17 12:19:49 2015 UTC,"I think Benji would have been fine if he was a couple years younger when he came over and started in club rugby on the wing for a season. Straight into 10 at Super Rugby level is a very tough proposition. That said, i think Sean Johnson is better suited to union than him"

rugbyunion,3a5deg,admartian,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:42:13 2015 UTC,I believe his talents would be wasted at Fullback and he would be too small for the centres imo
rugbyunion,3a5deg,cynic_male,3,Wed Jun 17 10:57:29 2015 UTC,I'd give him a run around on the wing first to get him used to union again then move him in

rugbyunion,3a5deg,amplebooty,3,Thu Jun 18 00:21:28 2015 UTC,Sam Tomkins. I don't know many league players but heard he's a good attacking back and plays in the nrl.
rugbyunion,3a5deg,fernta,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:33:18 2015 UTC,"no way, don't know anything about league but im pretty sure when he went from super league to nrl he got exposed hard. was meant to be a huge signing from it but just did not perform at all.  wasn't a ""flop"" or bad, but mediocre and average, so for your big signing not a stand out at all."
rugbyunion,3a5deg,seamerkin,2,Thu Jun 18 10:16:05 2015 UTC,I thought he was injured most of the season?

rugbyunion,3a5deg,emperorrimbaud,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:44:14 2015 UTC,"Think he played in a union game for the barbarians didn't he?  Has been bang average in the nrl for the money he is on so could see a move to union as a possibility, I think he has the potential to be a decent union winger"
rugbyunion,3a5deg,rugby_fc,2,Thu Jun 18 22:52:04 2015 UTC,"Josh Dugan at outside centre, Cam Smith or Jake Friend at halfback"
rugbyunion,3a5deg,BullNiro,2,Thu Jun 18 00:39:06 2015 UTC,Aaron Woods could be a decent loose forward. Loved the power in his run to the try line last night.

rugbyunion,3a26h2,ciderczar,6,Tue Jun 16 21:28:06 2015 UTC,Yeah EA pulled their funding for rugby games around that time and HB made the decision to keep making them on a shoestring budget. The games they came out with left a hell of a lot to be desired but im still thankful they gave it a go and gave us something

With another player it's great! Never had more fun with game when we lost the lions tour 3-0. If you got it it all I can help out with any of the settings if you wanted at all."
rugbyunion,3a26h2,young-febreeze,2,Tue Jun 16 20:37:37 2015 UTC,Do you mind sharing those settings? If they really make the game that much better I might get a copy to fill the void getting rid of Rugby 08 left

rugbyunion,3a26h2,Nurgler,6,Wed Jun 17 01:39:19 2015 UTC,Rugby 2015 was pretty horrible. Running was faster than passing and the defending team wins every ruck.
rugbyunion,3a26h2,jayone127,56,Tue Jun 16 19:09:23 2015 UTC,I've gone and done my research and if I had to choose a starting XV for the world cup;  1 Donkey Kong 2 Wario 3 Bowser 4 Dr. Eggman 5 Vector the Crocodile  6 Knuckles 7 Yoshi 8 Mario  9 Toad 10 Sonic 11 Princess Peach 12 Luigi 13 Shadow the Hedgehog  14 Amy the Hedgehog  15  Tails
rugbyunion,3a26h2,afunky,47,Tue Jun 16 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sold on Sonic at 10.  To me Mario is a natural fit there. Especially as Sonic has a non existent kicking game, and Mario practices his kicking game with the shells of his defeated enemies.  I'd slot Sonic in at right wing, and Metal Sonic in at left wing.   I think you are missing a power runner in the midfield so i'd shift Dr Eggman to 12, and push Luigi into No.8, and bring Waluigi into Lock.  His height and skill will be an asset.  My XV   Donkey Kong Wario Bowser Waluigi Vector the Crocodile Knuckles Yoshi Luigi Toad Mario Metal Sonic Dr. Eggman Shadow the Hedgehog Sonic   15 Tails"
rugbyunion,3a26h2,barrettyboots,18,Tue Jun 16 21:23:55 2015 UTC,"I was hoping loads of peeps would get on board with this. Thoroughly enjoyable reading on the commute home. I agree with a lot of what you've said but I'd lay it out like this. I see what you're saying about a power runner in the midfield... I've shipped my only option for that out to 11 as well. Could put Shadow out there and bring in Metal Sonic.   My XV   Donkey Kong - a bruiser, strong lineout lifter Wario - gets in the face of the opposition; must be weary not parallel the behaviours of Dylan Hartley Bowser - slow but near-impossible to take down, beast-like strength Waluigi - main man in the lineout Dr Eggman - a jumper with power around the field Nabbit - expert on cleaning up loose ball and stealing in rucks Knuckles - Speed and tenacity, especially off the side of the scrum. Should be a nightmare for fly-halves  Vector The Crocodile - raw strength coming from the back; power runner Diddy Kong - a tricky customer, always looking to snipe Mario - the main man running the show Metal Sonic - strength and speed on the left wing Luigi - Mario's right hand man. Not a bruiser but plenty of experience Shadow the Hedgehog - shadowing his inside man; explosive pace and a wicked step Sonic - the Habana of his world   15 Yoshi - don't let the size fool you, he's a bit of a 1/2p, just with a lesser boot"
rugbyunion,3a26h2,soneill1,5,Tue Jun 16 23:09:49 2015 UTC,"I like your pick of Nabbit at 6, good flanker needs to be a ball hoover. Here's my starting XV, my subs will be the LA Raiders from Tecmo Bowl:   Donkey Kong  Toad - Soft head, comfortable with the powerful engage from his props.  Bowser - need the size to match DK, they could be the best front row in rugby if they can get past their cultural differences.  Waluigi  Luigi - I'll take a page from the Welsh playbook and put two freakishly tall siblings together at lock Nabbit  Diddy Kong Samus - the scrum will need robot like precision to be effective against the world's best, the laser jumping helps too.  Mario - Great boots and hands to match from his decades of shell punting, a scrummy who can jump through a tunnel and box kick is dangerous Yoshi - good hands from egg-tossing in Smash Bros., can kick for touch from anywhere.  Tails - Ability to fly can help on the blind side Metal Sonic - I want and steel, robot hedgehog to take a lot of touches to get the phase count up, wear down the defence and draw in numbers to open space out wide.  Knuckles  Sonic - There will be a lot of miss passes to Sonic.  Starfox - I think having a fox chase down kicks would be the best option."
rugbyunion,3a26h2,bunnyletueur,4,Wed Jun 17 03:25:53 2015 UTC,"If we're opening it up like that, Link would be an outstanding 13. Turn of pace, strong, got a huge bag of tricks in his arsenal. Like an elfin Brian O'Driscoll."
rugbyunion,3a26h2,dr_chim_richaldz,2,Wed Jun 17 08:08:20 2015 UTC,"I recommend King Dedede as our first utility tight-five. Slow, but strong enough to crush on the red ball, and also wins all our lineouts with his massive jump.  Plus from the lineout catch he either doesn't input and clear out the opposing forwards for a mile with the shockwave, or inputs and floats towards the try line for a nice, easy 7 points."
rugbyunion,3a26h2,RugbyAndBeer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:20:45 2015 UTC,"Similar logic, Kirby on the wing. Get him the ball, and he's away, he's flying. Literally. He uses his endless floating ability to fly overhead to the try line."

rugbyunion,3a26h2,Supertrinko,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:56:21 2015 UTC,I'd probably put Bowser Jr. in centre and move Eggman to 8.
rugbyunion,3a26h2,jayone127,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:13:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah this sounds good.  I understand the impulse to put sonic as a winger, but i honestly feel he's being wasted there. He has some playmaking skills and my personal preference is to put him at 12 where he'd draw in several defenders. Bowser Jr at 13 and Shadow on the wing. Luigi on the bench as utility back. That guy can't start. He scares too easily."
rugbyunion,3a26h2,afunky,11,Wed Jun 17 01:04:50 2015 UTC,Surely Sonic's got to be a winger? And Toad is surely not enough of a bastard to be a good nine. Front row is pretty killer though.

There's only one team that's ever done it, it's Toulon. They've done it by having at least two international class players in every position. This year they had freaking Fernandez Lobbe on the bench for the biggest. That's how insane their back row was."

He has also played for the French national team, earning his first cap on 16 June 2001 against South Africa. He scored the championship winning try of the 2007 Six Nations against Scotland.

rugbyunion,3a6jg4,CamKeys45,12,Wed Jun 17 16:52:34 2015 UTC,"A lot of people will talk about how the money in France is destroying the other top leagues in the world.   However, I think there is a wider issue here about how professionalism and money really are actually hugely helping the game. Thanks in part to the potential of professionalism, rugby has expanded dramatically throughout the world. Consider Ireland. Before professionalism, rugby in Ireland was the sport of the fancy suburbs of Dublin, Belfast, and Limerick. Now, with rugby being the only fully professional sport on the island, the player and fan base has expanded dramatically and now people who would otherwise never have cared about rugby are getting into it.  The same thing is happening all over the world. The old status-quo of rugby just being the sport of the upper middle class is slowly going away, making a more democratic sport, which is good for the game."
rugbyunion,3a6jg4,BZH_JJM,3,Wed Jun 17 17:57:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. To simplify, more money = better players = more spectators = rugby growing more internationally. Similar to soccer, kids see it not just as a game but as a very profitable career. This is especially the case for lower socioeconomic areas. Which will grow rugby in non traditional rugby countries .  I get the whole SH drain of talent pisses a lot of people off but on the flip side, cipriani played for the rebels and was a crowd favourite and the same goes for potgieter (although SA) I even get excited to see the Japanese bloke who is Aaron smiths replacement have a run.   Rugby is different to soccer where playing for your country is the ultimate goal and for most players this should be the case, if it isn't than great I wouldn't want them representing my nation. I really like the way Australia has changed the eligibility rule and as a result we will get to see a lot more younger talent that will be exposed to professional rugby earlier due to the players jumping overseas once they have contributed enough to our country.  Many may not agree with Toulon, but I most likely would of never watched the top 14 if it wasn't for them having a world XV of players from across the globe, it's exciting stuff!"
rugbyunion,3a6jg4,Grandmaster_flashes,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:48:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks definitely a different side to what I was going to say, hadn't thought of it like that."
rugbyunion,3a6jg4,dr_chim_richaldz,6,Wed Jun 17 18:05:31 2015 UTC,"The perception of having money is harmful to blue collar fans, who have not been strongly associated with the game, particularly over the last three decades. Having a sport that feels inclusive of everyone is extremely important.  Northern hemisphere spectators will often tell you that the purchase of professional players from opposite corners of the globe is detrimental to the growth of local sides. It can prevent up-and-coming talent from showcasing their strengths, in order to make a bid for their national side.  There are also multiple examples of players who abandoned the possibility of playing for their country, in order to grab a bigger paycheck from a club. Teams like Toulon are virtually playing year round, whereas any national rugby team may only play 10 tests in a season. Observing the numbers that are revealed  for a contract in the South of France, it can be far more lucrative to accept such a position, over the prestige of playing for your country.  An ordinary spectator will usually prioritise his patriotism, viewing National success as the highest honour (eg. a RWC win.) A club owner will be more concerned with their success, in order to fill stadiums on a weekly basis. It is, after all, a business.   So if you're a spectator who enjoys rugby of a high standard on a regular basis, with little care for what jersey they pull on, then player purchasing, as Toulon does, is great. But if you're a devout fan of your National side, you may see the negatives through unsuccessful tests, poor player development, and even ineligibility.  (There's also the issue of how you spend the money. Look at ARU for what not to do.)"
rugbyunion,3a6jg4,batzman,3,Wed Jun 17 19:09:11 2015 UTC,"On a global scale no, but in New Zealand yes. We can't compete with overseas contracts therefore we have to gamble which players to invest in and other to let go. It's a constant struggle here to retain our top players and our young up and comers"

rugbyunion,3a6jg4,threalseymourskinner,3,Fri Jun 19 11:07:19 2015 UTC,"In the ITM Cup, you could say so.  Back when it was just the NPC, you saw crowds of 20,000+ turning out for most first-division and some second-division matches. That's when the All Blacks were playing in the provinces. After professionalism, the system was restructured like this: 1. Internationals 2. Super 12 3. NPC. The Super 12 was created so top players could be paid, rather than play for a team in a region they grew up in/have a special connection to. The All Black tests were then scheduled on NPC matchdays, and the provinces had to bring up a 'reserve squad', sort of, every single week. Quality dropped, attendance dwindled and general interest hit a low.   Today, hardly anyone in the ITM Cup plays for their team anymore. When Auckland played Southland in 2014, all of Southland's backline had attended school or joined a club in Auckland. With the publicisation of high-school rugby, people don't want to learn their apprenticeship through clubs in the rural areas. They will turn 17, play well, and expect a Super Rugby contract all in the same year. Think of Taniela Tupou; played one awesome 40 minutes, signed with the Reds not long afterwords.  Even our top players have trouble staying in the country. The All Black's immense depth means that some brilliant players are left in the shadows, so they chase the cheque elsewhere. Colin Slade, as a recent example, just signed up with Pau for NZD$800,000 a year. It's madness. Eventually the All Blacks won't be a representative of the strongest rugby nation in the world. It will just be 15 lucky blokes who cannot get injured because all the reserves are in Europe.  But New Zealand seems to do well despite this fact. Top rated team for 5+ years now, a World Cup, an unbeaten season. Our winning percentage has increased since 1995. So is money ruining rugby? In New Zealand, kind of, but in absolutely nowhere else.  TL;DR: Not too much."
rugbyunion,3a6jg4,J0nShannow,2,Thu Jun 18 02:03:42 2015 UTC,Money has always been present in rugby. What matters is how it is spent. I think high player salaries have a detrimental effect on the game. Money itself can be a good thing for rugby (investing in amateur development etc).
rugbyunion,3a6jg4,bakaattack,3,Thu Jun 18 06:20:19 2015 UTC,"No, certainly not. Money has certainly skewed the NH leagues  towards France at club level while seeming to have a detrimental effect on the National side but the advent of professionalism means we as spectators get to watch more rugby from stronger, faster, better athletes (in not a big fan of the 'bigger players is ruining everything circle jerk). As long as clubs don't try to spend their way to greatness without solid financials and bankrupt themselves, which adhering to stable salary caps will certainly help with, I don't have a problem with money."

There was one week where he played really well, and McCaw had a very average game. The fact that McCaw had strapping on pretty much every limb made the age vs. youth debate appear even more literal.  As for Pocock/Hooper, I'm more scared of Hooper playing as a Wales fan. The Welsh defence is great, but I don't think we'd cope in a Waratahs style big ball carrier/offloading game, which you'd think would be the type of game plan in which you play Hooper."

rugbyunion,3a4hi7,deadlysyntax,3,Thu Jun 18 04:08:35 2015 UTC,"I don't follow your logic (if you could call it that and not just hopeful thinking). The Warratahs won last year without anyone in the team having played the final before. The Chiefs did so two years prior. Which demonstrates that not having played finals before doesn't really count for much. Why would home advantage semi apply to the Warratahs but not the more dominant Hurricanes? I'd be surprised if the Highlanders who also haven't played finals footy before beat the rested Hurricanes at home in the semi, but who knows? Maybe they will. I think it's a little too early to start calling the Warratahs the most likely to win."

Also, had a downright shocker against Oyonnax this year.  In the end, he got sidelined by Jeremy Sinzelle, a Toulon academy ""reject"" (a highly relative term, as you can guess from Toulon's hugh profile recruitement policy.), who has had a blank year in 2013/2014 because of injury.  I think we're all disappointed it didn't work out as well as both parties hoped it would: we were really excited when his signing was announced. Hope he'll bounce back in Japan."
rugbyunion,3a2ob1,Sidus_Preclarum,5,Wed Jun 17 00:33:05 2015 UTC,Was already crocked when he left Australia with a continually reoccurring knee and shoulder injuries and I guess he never really recovered.

Zach Pangelinan represented Guam in soccer before switching to rugby and playing for the USA. Since the people of Guam can represent both countries, the situation is more akin to that of the Cook Islands than Tonga."
rugbyunion,39zhdo,grubbr,2,Tue Jun 16 16:11:37 2015 UTC,"Wasn't aware of that, but my comment was to suggest that if countries can hold onto their players, they can continue to climb, which is much better for rugby as a whole. I don't think France for example should be starting an academy in the Pacific Islands. Long term, what are the implications for Guam with people being able to represent both countries?"

rugbyunion,39zhdo,jbmass,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:07:55 2015 UTC,"Players who are of Pacific Island decent that are playing for other nations, Taulupe Faletau for Wales, Manu Tuilagi, the Vunipola brothers for England for example. The gents who are playing for New Zealand, or Noa Nakaitaci, Uini Atonio, Romain Taofifenua for France.  If these guys were playing for Fiji, Samoa or Tonga they might be properly challenging at the top table, instead there is a talent drain away from these countries, which I don't think is correct."
rugbyunion,39zhdo,therugbymagazine,2,Tue Jun 16 21:32:18 2015 UTC,"Romain Taofifenua   He's French, he has always been French since his birth. Unlike Atonio or Nakaitaci."

rugbyunion,39zhdo,grubbr,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:45:04 2015 UTC,"Actually his wiki page doesn't say anything, but he was born in metropolitan (i.e European) France, in Mont de Marsan. His father was born in New Caledonia but had Wallisian origins, according to his wiki page, so it's quite unclear. I don't know if he has New Caledonian citizenship.  And anyway New Caledonia is French (for the moment... :p ), so I don't know why he should not have played for France, even though New Caledonia has a national team (which is something that I find quite weird IMO, but hey)."
rugbyunion,39zhdo,therugbymagazine,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:55:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, does your logic hold true in the case of Nigeria where many have chosen the English rose over their African ancestry?  E.g. Chris Oti, Andrew Harriman, Victor Ubogu, Ade Adebeyo, Steve Ojomoh, Ugo Monye and Topsy Ojo?"
rugbyunion,39zhdo,grubbr,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:55:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but this goes beyond the sentiment of my original comment. If a player qualifies through birth, residency or ancestry for any nation, they are at liberty to choose who they want to play for, it is not for us to decide, it is only a shame that across those nations that are developing the game of rugby, they have/are/may possibly see players that can help move them forward plying their trade elsewhere."
rugbyunion,39zhdo,therugbymagazine,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:34:18 2015 UTC,"I understand your POV but your sentiment is fundamentally flawed.   What is the difference between a 2nd/3rd/4th generation Pacific Islander born and raised in Australia or France choosing to play for their countries over an ancestral home vs a 2nd/3rd/4th generation Scot, Welshman or Englishman choosing to play for Hong Kong or New Zealand over their British homeland?"
rugbyunion,39zhdo,grubbr,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:57:38 2015 UTC,"None, they can choose who they want to play for, which was not the point of my original comment. The questions you have asked are highly pertinent but do go beyond the sentiment of my original comment, which was not about whether it is right (it is their choice as to which country they most identify with), but how much the game in these countries could continue to develop had they chosen differently."
rugbyunion,39zhdo,grubbr,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:40:57 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest these countries would be exactly where they are now because their development systems and organisation are of an infinitely poorer standard regardless of having every potential player available.  It's the same reason Fijian/Tongan/Samoan U20 sides are now competing in the second tier of this age-group's competition while still relying on 2nd/3rd/4th generation players of descent, born in Australia or NZ and developed through their schools/academies/systems to remain competitive.  In 99% of cases the difference is the environment, not the players (Rupeni Caucaunibuca being an example of the 1% exception)."

rugbyunion,3a11yp,poolnallinnit,2,Tue Jun 16 18:17:07 2015 UTC,Yup but heaven forbid it be approached by a competing team in any way deemed undesirable.
rugbyunion,3a11yp,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,3,Tue Jun 16 21:57:52 2015 UTC,"That's a different thing though.  It's not that the Haka is too precious to be approached, it's to stop fights breaking out. Literally the only restriction on the other teams behaviour is the distance.  And the All Blacks are obliged to stay back as much as the other team is, neither team is supposed to cross their 10m line."
rugbyunion,3a11yp,poolnallinnit,5,Tue Jun 16 22:03:57 2015 UTC,"ABs are upset if teams don't simply stand and take it in, getting offended if teams simply go away and do their own thing. Team should be able to do whatever they want such as practice kicking while it's going on or going into their own huddle.  Teams should also be able to advance to the halfway line if they so wish.  Ironic given its a war dance just how precious it's all become."
rugbyunion,3a11yp,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,4,Tue Jun 16 22:09:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure I have seen any current All Black ever complain about anything another team did during a Haka. Maybe you could back that up.  Re: them doing what they want, they can if they want. Of course, the polite thing to do in situations like that is to stand respectfully. No one warms up during another country's anthem do they? Most teams are simply reasonable and happy to witness it.   Let's never forget that they all have the right to perform too, and some like the Samoans do. The ones who choose not to have made that choice for themselves. If New Zealand turned up and said ""We don't want to sing our anthem, so we don't think you guys should either"" I don't think anyone would be impressed.  If you are okay with a limit, at halfway, what is the difference between that limit and 10m? Seems pretty minor.  Again, these are IRB rules designed to avoid any incidents, not things inherent to the culture or demanded by the All Blacks.   That said though, Maori culture is quite procedural, a welcome onto a marae can take ages by the time you get the waiata and challenges and speeches and gift-giving and hongi etc. There are definite rules for all of that, but only in the same way that there are for any formal ceremony like the changing of the guard or whatever.  And of course I know that you know not all Haka are war dances, and Ka Mate in particular is a war dance in so far as it is about a guy hiding in a sweet potato pit and escaping his enemies. Stirring stuff."

After your anthem you want me to watch a war dance and you say that the polite thing to do would be ""stand respectfully"" and that most people would be ""happy to witness it"" I think that shows you're not thinking logically."

One team does so, the other declines The one that declines can't complain about unfairness because the same opportunity was given to both."

Theres then the further expectation that they should again remain listless for additional dance about.   Re:HW/10m Because halfway signifies your half. Beyond that, it encroaches into opposition territory.  Re: Maori culture. A rugby pitch isn't the place for additional ceremony. You already sing your anthem in Maori and English, that should be suffice recognition of your respective cultures."
rugbyunion,3a11yp,poolnallinnit,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:47:58 2015 UTC,"The thing to remember is that the performance of the Haka pre-dates the playing of the anthem. In fact the anthem being played at a game was first done as a response to the Haka. So it's not further expectation, it's all part of the same expectation.   I don't think you get to decide what goes on on a pitch. Just because anthems eventually caught on and became the de facto national performance in most spheres doesn't mean that our tradition can't be observed."

rugbyunion,3a37j8,speculumfight,3,Wed Jun 17 00:40:25 2015 UTC,"People get upset that the US plays him as a lock when he is a beast at 8. But you can also clearly see the problem in the players listed, just so many loose forwards in the US. 12 invited and at least 7-8 of those I would consider ""international"" calibre in a US context (not comparing to tier 1 squads). And that list doesnt even include younger developing players like Hanco Germishuys, Christian Wiessing, or Christian Ostberg (or Jacobus Germishuys, Hanco's younger brother)  Part of the role of the High Performance program and various rep sides should be managing this. More players need to be ""molded' / ""encouraged"" away from loose forward.  This may also be part of the current weakness of the broader college system. Taking the NFL as an example. Almost every NFL player was a QB or RB in high school because they were 10 times the athlete of anyone else on the field and the coach wanted them involved as much as possible. When they go to play college football they all get moved into specialized roles. Partially based on how their build /speed matches up at the next level and also just because teams need great athletes at every position.  My guess is that within college rugby programs (outside the top teams) these guys are such  good athletes, coaches want them involved in as much as possible, so 6,7,8 is ideal. But really more of them need to start specializing. The bigger guys could probably aim to bulk up into 4 or 5 and actually a few could probably become good 12/13s. If we are talking about getting up into the highest levels, the centers need the sure tackling / rucking skills just as much."

If you use Wade in the right way defence isn't too much of a problem, he is world class in attack. Not many other players in England are world class in any areas."
rugbyunion,3a1hib,R8_D8_8_ATE_M8,0,Wed Jun 17 12:48:43 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be used as a player that has high energy,  eg Keneith fareid for USA basketball who sad used in easy games so the score line could be blown out but when tougher teams are played the more experienced player will be playing."
rugbyunion,3a1hib,dom65659,2,Tue Jun 16 23:49:07 2015 UTC,"Depends who else is on the field. England will need some really strong finishers, which Wade is, but I definitely agree that he is not the best defender.  You know what, though, neither is Ashton, and he's capped enough."

Seriously though unfortunately he's just too small and doesn't yet make up for it with ability to read the game. Its not all about size in Rugby but look at our group games, it'll just be high kick 1 on 1's vs Folau, North, Goneva, Nalaga etc.  Hopefully he can develop his game like Robinson or Williams becuase then he'd be a hell of a player. The best attacking player in the country."

Get a bus that goes within 5 minutes of the stadium but takes over an hour from the centre of town  I can't understand why anyone who has to travel from outside of Manchester would ever want to see a game at the AJ Bell.

rugbyunion,39xnah,Beschuss,4,Tue Jun 16 02:56:19 2015 UTC,Crossing by the hooker in my opinion but hard to see real time. Most 1st phase tries have crossing in them these days
rugbyunion,39xnah,JakeSpleen,4,Mon Jun 15 18:25:32 2015 UTC,But it appears he never makes contact with a defender and doesnt obstruct anyone from attempting a tackle so IMO I don't think this is crossing.  Seems he just ran an inside line that kind of froze the opposition hooker.
rugbyunion,39xnah,iCandid,2,Mon Jun 15 20:59:15 2015 UTC,"Agree, but he did cross in front of the carrier, had no reason to do so, he wasn't running a support line. Clearly a planned block.  I don't doubt that it was technically legal, but I'm not a fan of these types of plays.  Edit, he definitely slowed the covering tackler and it probably made all the difference.  Edit 2. You're right he didn't take anyone out, but he along with 17 stop the blues player attempting a tackle. 17 is fine as he was already there, but as I say even though this is a legal move I still dislike the tactic"
rugbyunion,39xnah,JakeSpleen,2,Mon Jun 15 21:31:53 2015 UTC,i gather you mean that the hooker ran inwards to pull the only man not in the mall inwards to let the ball carrier have more space in the corner. i am just trying to expand my terminology and need things painfully explained.
rugbyunion,39xnah,systemupdate,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:53:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It was a 'block' but he didn't make contact, regardless he obstructed the covering tackler and slowed him down. If you look at how marginal the try was, the 'block' made all the difference.  Based on the rules as they stand though it probably wasn't illegal."
rugbyunion,39xnah,JakeSpleen,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:30:16 2015 UTC,so if the tackler had ran out quicker and hit the man crossing. he would have been at fault because the man didnt have the ball. or is the point of the crossing rule that you cant feign a switch that close to a man?
rugbyunion,39xnah,systemupdate,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:55:02 2015 UTC,"If the tackler had been obstructed by the hooker then it would've been a penalty for crossing.  The crossing rule is to prevent american football style blocking, although with the modern interpretation of the rules it's a very grey area, you can more or less obstruct the tackler now, as long as you don't initiate contact."

rugbyunion,3a12ju,Captoon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:19:38 2015 UTC,"I think the article shows how poorly the players are treated. Coaches in the England set up are still treating the players like kids. Interestingly in all three cases if they had been All Blacks the decision regarding their punishments would have been dealt with by a disciplinary panel made up of 5 of the current leaders from the team. a few years back when Zac Guildford first got into trouble his disciplinary panel was made up of Richie Macaw, Brad Thorn, Mils Muliaina, Keven Mealamu and Dan Carter. He had to answer to them.  The ABs still dealt with the issue but rather than it coming from the coaches or the grey suits Guildford had to answer directly to his team mates.  Now obviously Guildford has become a serial offender but that is more a reflection of him rather than the process.  Whilst I agree with the reprimands on all three players, I don't think Lancaster handle the situation the right way. It was a very headmaster approach and we need to start treating our players like adults if we want them to behave like adults"

The Euro rugby is over for the season so for a while you are stuck with Southern Hemisphere rugby.  Super Rugby finals start this weekend. Watch the Highlanders vs Chiefs.  SH internationals start in early July featuring NZ/Australia/South Africa/Argentina and a cameo from Samoa.   And then the big one... The Rugby World Cup starts in September...  Just come here for match threads which invariably have some streams listed.

rugbyunion,39xwky,Marshsonu,4,Tue Jun 16 11:22:05 2015 UTC,"SEE, ESPN??? IT FUCKING WORKS!!!!!  But actually though, glad to have you. Can't think of the best games off the top of my head but I'm pretty sure full replays of the games from the 2011 World Cup are available (in pretty good quality too) somewhere, possibly hiding somewhere on this year's RWC website. Have a look at some of those, though I will specifically recommend AGAINST watching the final. It was a good game, but not terribly exciting for a newcomer. In fairness, that's also the only one I remember well enough to anti-recommend, it's not like it was the only non-perfect game of the tournament (this is true of any sport lol)  Also, this year's Six Nations has videos available on the BBC's website, use your own favourite way of pretending you're in the UK to watch those (just search Six Nations). The last weekend was a shitshow of tries.  There might be a video of last year's Super Rugby Final between the Crusaders (Christchurch, NZ) and the Waratahs (New South Wales) somewhere. Pretty good game, if I remember correctly.   Basic structure: You've got the Northern Hemisphere, with the Six Nations as the international tournament (Ireland, Wales, Scotland, France, Italy, and England, in descending order of how much I like them); domestically there's the Top 14 in France, the (Aviva) Premiership in England, and the (Guinness) Pro12 in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Italy.   Southern Hemisphere has The Rugby Championship as their international tournament (shortened format this year b/c of the RWC), with New Zealand, Argentina, Australia, and South Africa (again, descending order of how much I like them :P). Each nation has their own domestic leagues but they're lower levels than Super Rugby, which next year will have 5 teams each AUS/NZ, 6 from South Africa, and a team each from Argentina and Japan.   Other nations worth noting: Canada, USA, Japan, Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Romania, Georgia are the consistently good ones. Depending where you are in the US (notably, are you in NorCal or close to the Toronto or Vancouver borders), you may be able to catch a match of this year's Pacific Nations Cup (JPN/CAN/USA/SAM/TGA/FIJ) in San Jose, Sacramento, Vancouver, or Toronto, if you're interested in seeing an international match live. Tickets should be reasonably cheap, but just remember these are the second tier nations (as I cry from saying that about les rouges).   Oh, that comment was longer than it should have been. Ah well. Let me know if you have questions about anything, I love talking to a newcomer about the game! (Also, if you're in the Seattle area, shoutout!!)"

Even before that is the Rugby Championship from July to August (featuring New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Argentina) and various World Cup warm-up fixtures which will run through all of August and early September.

Cleanouts around the neck must be penalised  Challenging players in the air - Law 10.4(i)  Play on – Fair challenge with both players in a realistic position to catch the ball.

rugbyunion,39wro2,PetevonPete,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:22:40 2015 UTC,Half the feeds I see are literal 45 degree angles towards the feeding team. The refs just straight up don't care about this rule.
rugbyunion,39wro2,EverythingIsByDesign,9,Tue Jun 16 12:48:15 2015 UTC,Well I for one am not a fan of distinguishing between what constitutes a Red/Yellow for an aerial challenge based on how the player lands. IMO an action on the field should not be judged by the consequence rather the act itself.
rugbyunion,39wro2,HymenHoarder,3,Mon Jun 15 19:57:23 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Should a player who does a standard neck roll clean out be given a different ban length to another who uses the same motion but breaks the players neck? Of course not. You could argue for increasing the ban length for offences that are potentially that dangerous but that's a separate argument.
rugbyunion,39wro2,mattgrande,8,Mon Jun 15 20:36:18 2015 UTC,I'm really excited about the scrum feed clarification. Hopefully it's actually enforced.
rugbyunion,39wro2,Colemanation777,3,Mon Jun 15 14:50:53 2015 UTC,The IRB need to bang this drum every month. Refs start off well but then seem to forget after a few games. I'd wager no scrum halfs are penalised come the knock outs for feeding.
rugbyunion,39wro2,Popehunter,3,Mon Jun 15 15:54:27 2015 UTC,This clarification scares me the most because I don't think I've ever fed straight into the scrum :)
rugbyunion,39wro2,blarneymanager,2,Mon Jun 15 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"This is not an original idea of mine (I can't remember whose it was). Why not have the referee use that white foam spray we've seen introduced to the round ball sport to make the mark for the hookers and then watch the scrum half roll it on that line?  Both the ref and the 9 know the score then and we'll have a proper contest for possession. Otherwise, let's have a free kick and get on with some running rugby!"
rugbyunion,39wro2,frakturfreak,3,Mon Jun 15 18:16:10 2015 UTC,"Apparently, even actual refs had this idea  In this forum thread there are also some explanations what is still consired as straight. Only a part of the ball has to touch the middle line. The middle of the ball doesn’t have to go on the middle of the scrum.  So if the scrumhalf manages to put the tip of the ball on the middle line it’s still consired as fair ball."
rugbyunion,39wro2,PmMeAss,2,Mon Jun 15 19:03:54 2015 UTC,"This is a great idea, pitches could get messy though but I like it. Makes feeding scrums idiot proof"
rugbyunion,39wro2,bigred9,2,Mon Jun 15 18:33:04 2015 UTC,I was once told by an old Kiwi referee that he remembered when the referees actually put the ball into the scrums. Maybe it's time to return to that?
rugbyunion,39wro2,collidge,2,Mon Jun 15 20:23:28 2015 UTC,This is a brilliant idea.
rugbyunion,39wro2,frakturfreak,4,Mon Jun 15 20:33:10 2015 UTC,"This is a brilliant terrible idea.   ftfy  I don’t think the referee should be taking any direct action with the ball in the game.  The laws are already there they just need to be enforced better.  There is no need for the refs to feed the scrum and if they did, soon there will be lines like “The English ref cleary fed into the Italian pack, that’s why Ireland lost the game and got robbed of the six nations title by England.”  I don’t see anything good coming from this."
rugbyunion,39wro2,bigred9,2,Mon Jun 15 20:50:46 2015 UTC,"As an ex high level referee, I can assure you that referees are assessed in minute details in every game. One mis-feed and they get dropped from that level."
rugbyunion,39wro2,frakturfreak,2,Mon Jun 15 21:45:43 2015 UTC,I don’t think this was ever tried in rugby union but seem to remember to have read about it being tried in rugby league. But I can’t find evidence for that. EDIT A news paper article from 1979.  Also I don’t think the ref should feed the scrum because there will be talks of favourism pretty soon.
rugbyunion,39wro2,0ffice_Zombie,8,Mon Jun 15 20:35:32 2015 UTC,I welcome the clarification on challenging players in the air but I can't help but feel that focusing on how the player lands will ensure we will see a lot more players who win the challenge landing on their sides/shoulders on purpose in order to force penalties and/or cards.   I believe the scrum feed laws were clarified at the end of last season but we saw absolutely no changes. People were still feeding the scrum incorrectly. Hopefully they actually enforce the officials to ref the feed if it continues.
rugbyunion,39wro2,wn_,5,Mon Jun 15 13:16:46 2015 UTC,"Re: challenges in the air, the 'play on' criterion is key:   Fair challenge with both players in a realistic position to catch the ball. Even if the player(s) land(s) dangerously, play on.  As we all know, there have been a lot of contentious calls surrounding aerial challenges these past several months, and, if referees take note of these clear guidelines (which they really should), there should be far fewer such decisions in the future."
rugbyunion,39wro2,Enyapxam,7,Mon Jun 15 13:28:29 2015 UTC,Maul - Sanction all players who join in front of the ball carrier   Hallelujah.  Funny this is clarified a week after Nigel Owens said joining in front of the ball carrier wasn't reffed as it didn't make a difference.  Mauls have been too stacked in favour of the attacking team for too long. Whether the refs actually listen or not remains to be seen.

rugbyunion,39ul5r,big_agile,34,Sun Jun 14 22:28:52 2015 UTC,"When they announced the Olympic 7's, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to kickstart the game in the US.  Then, when the qualification process was announced, and that there would only be 12 teams, it seemed like we would be left at home, wasting the opportunity to showcase rugby.  Canada was far and away the best North American 7's side.  The turnaround over the last 12 months from this team is incredible, Mike Friday has done an amazing job.  Now, heading in to the Olympics, not only will the US be there, but have an outside chance at getting a medal."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,uconnrugby,10,Sun Jun 14 22:36:50 2015 UTC,Canada also helped us by taking an inexplicable nose dive over the past year.
rugbyunion,39ul5r,PetevonPete,8,Sun Jun 14 22:52:24 2015 UTC,"Canada finishing 9th this year on the 7s circuit was still their second highest finish in the last decade.  They dropped off for sure, but I think this has more to do with the US's improvement under Friday."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,uconnrugby,3,Sun Jun 14 22:59:55 2015 UTC,"Plus Canada had a bunch of injuries to deal with early in the competition.  It took them a while to get going but they finished strong and had a good series overall. They have a good chance of winning the repechage,  but it's tough to have a whole nother year to worry about qualifying."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,ISWThunder,5,Sun Jun 14 23:54:04 2015 UTC,"I think the winner of the repechage will be either Australia or Samoa, whichever doesn't win the Oceania tournament."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,PetevonPete,3,Mon Jun 15 00:09:06 2015 UTC,"Samoa is more of a basket case than Canada. They were pretty awful this year on the WS. Australia is almost certain to win their region.  I would say canada have the best odds of winning with Samoa 2nd, then maybe Portugal"
rugbyunion,39ul5r,Mariusuiram,3,Mon Jun 15 02:57:36 2015 UTC,"Samoa were awful, but they have won the world series in the past and even in this horrible season they still placed 2nd in one tournament and 4th in another. Points wise they finished right there with Canada.  Added to that, Samoa has a hell of a lot of big guns they could roll back in for a one off qualification tournament. Depending on the squad my moneys on Samoa for the repechage."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,cape7,3,Mon Jun 15 04:38:46 2015 UTC,"Good point. Thats always been the wildcard. How much the teams step up the player pool for the olympics. Do they go after more professionals?  However, don't forget Nanai-Williams didnt seem like anything special during the WS and he was promoted as being a huge addition.  Same with Canada, bringing in Ardron, Hassler and Paris for the qualifier.  To be fair the Repachage will be in awhile and the teams preparing, know its coming. The biggest issue for these 15s professionals is just adjusting back to the game both in terms of fitness and play style.   My guess is that the teams that get these pros into at least 4-6 WS tournies and training camps will be the ones that see the benefit."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,Mariusuiram,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:42:42 2015 UTC,I haven't seen the game yet (time zones) but it sounds like Canada's professional players had little impact. Just Phil Mack.  Canada's improvement this year was when Sean duke and hirayama came back and I bet they are even better with Mack.
rugbyunion,39ul5r,Mariusuiram,4,Mon Jun 15 03:00:58 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it was inexplicable. Geraint John went off to Australia, and Canada were stuck in coach limbo for the first half of the season, which really did a number on them."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,BZH_JJM,29,Mon Jun 15 01:20:20 2015 UTC,Outside chance my ass! The reigning Olympic champions will defend their title!
rugbyunion,39ul5r,peekay427,15,Sun Jun 14 22:42:58 2015 UTC,"As much as I love the optimism, they did only finish top 3 in 1 of 9 tournaments last year, and a lot of the bigger nations may be pulling in some 15's players.  It will take a monumental effort to finish above Fiji, South Africa or NZ.  It can happen, but will be tough."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,uconnrugby,16,Sun Jun 14 22:51:23 2015 UTC,Sevens is incredibly unpredictable. Individual bounces can change the course of tournaments. I definitely wouldn't write yourselves off in the slightest.
rugbyunion,39ul5r,ycnz,3,Sun Jun 14 23:56:51 2015 UTC,"The seeding coming out the pools will also have a big impact. Although the US took a real path for the London 7s, there are still situations where certain teams may be better suited against others.  An upset earlier in the knock outs that physically drains the winner, can mean a much easier path to the podium for whoever makes it through across the bracket.  Obviously that still requires finishing near the top, but within the top 4/8 a lot of luck can factor into how you progress.  It would be cool if the Olympic 7s was a weekend tournie to kick off the games and weekend tournie around the close. Similar to WS, with total points.  Edit: realize that would go against a lot of what the Olympics usually does and may be excessive...just a cool idea."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,Mariusuiram,2,Mon Jun 15 05:46:46 2015 UTC,"Oh, definitely. But the US have beaten the All Blacks at the sevens. Whereas a 15 a side game is barely worth playing. :)"
rugbyunion,39ul5r,ycnz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:34:09 2015 UTC,"Ya I think I was agreeing with you in a roundabout way. Knock Out 7s is really not really a definitive way to determine ""the best"".  Partially because of the speed of the game and also probably because of who plays. If 7s was the national sport of every nation and 15s was the sideshow, I would guess the US/Canada etc would never ever beat NZ.  As it stands, the best 3-4 or even 5 tiers of NZ rugby probably have better professional alternatives. Whereas for the US, really only the absolute top players have a better offer. Madison Hughes mentioned in an interview that almost every player at the OTC has turned down European contracts to stay.  If the the USOC ups the stipend and considering the US interest in Olympic sports, I could see the US 7s consistently being tier 1 even if US 15s stays very low tier 2, just because of that difference in how top players get allocated."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,Mariusuiram,3,Mon Jun 15 08:50:31 2015 UTC,Agreed.   Watching this team for a while was a source of frustration.  Lately it's been a joy to watch them. Hope they keep this momentum rolling into the Olympics.
rugbyunion,39ul5r,mimo2,3,Sun Jun 14 22:41:32 2015 UTC,Kind of on a side note but who would you have as your starting finisher: Baker or Isles? Isles has come a long way but the little I've seen of the way Baker plays makes it seem like he has more rugby IQ than Isles. Anyone's thoughts?
rugbyunion,39ul5r,ISWThunder,7,Sun Jun 14 23:16:10 2015 UTC,"Baker has been getting the starts with Isles coming off the bench. Baker seems like the more well rounded player, although Isles has really improved.  Plus, having Isles come on fresh against tired legs in the second half is just nasty."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,crouchtouchpause,2,Sun Jun 14 23:41:06 2015 UTC,Baker produced a lovely back of the hand offload in the London final - real awareness from someone who's not been playing that long.
rugbyunion,39ul5r,BZH_JJM,3,Mon Jun 15 00:42:14 2015 UTC,"Baker's been playing rugby since 2006, but only just now really committed to it on a full time basis. Before he was switching between rugby and arena football."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,crouchtouchpause,3,Mon Jun 15 05:37:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I didn't know that - can only find him starting playing at Daytona Beach after leaving Arena football.  Do you know where he first started playing rugby?"
rugbyunion,39ul5r,MrTugAndKiss,3,Mon Jun 15 10:00:11 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to where he started, but we played him when he was playing for 1823 (Columbus RC) last year."

rugbyunion,39ul5r,Pantsmans,2,Mon Jun 15 21:06:45 2015 UTC,"I replayed it a few times after the match was over and all I saw Wyles do was pick up the ball out if the ruck and then roll the ball behind him after Canada earned the penalty, and then he rolled it back towards the penalty mark. So I guess the touch judge deemed that cynical or keeping the ball out of play..."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,Mariusuiram,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to have cited it as ""cynical play"". I guess its reasonable for the ref to hold everyone to a higher standard towards the end of a game. In the same way that they may push the team that's leading to take a lineout / take a kick"
rugbyunion,39ul5r,fr0gnutz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:26:50 2015 UTC,"Baker seems to have a better understanding of the game as a defensive player than Isles. He knows where to be and he can hit well, especially considering his size compared to Isles. BUT Isles was a poaching maniac at NACRA and helped out a lot in the Canada final with some big hits in our 22. Held out pretty well with a man down and it was awesome to see that. I'd probably start with Baker and kill off the gassed opposing team with a speedy and pumped up Carlin"
rugbyunion,39ul5r,Mariusuiram,2,Mon Jun 15 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"Isles is probably more inconsistent in defense. I believe it was in Glasgow or London where he came in after not starting much the first day and was making great ""body sacrificing"" tackles. Other tournies, he tries to run along side the guy and drag him down. Obviously he is fast enough to do this, but a good fend or a poorly timed grab means he is doomed.  Considering Baker has a bit more size (and therefore consistency in tackling) and has started playing a part in the restarts, he seems to be defacto starter.  Asking both to only play about 7 min each is really an incredible position to be in. Isles is definitely the faster player and has more ""quickness"" which makes him even sillier coming in fresh in the 2nd half of games.  Baker definitely has better overall game upside just because he isnt so small, but dont forget that Baker is about 29 while Isles is only 25. So Baker needs to be a complete rugby player as his speed will probably tail off a bit within the next 2-3 years (or at least flatten). Isles has a lot more time."

rugbyunion,39ul5r,leotuf,3,Mon Jun 15 00:07:17 2015 UTC,I think Canada has a really good shot in that field. I'd say the favorites have to be Samoa or Canada.
rugbyunion,39ul5r,SomeoneSomethingJr,3,Mon Jun 15 02:46:26 2015 UTC,"Things can definitely change over a year, but I have Canada as the favorites for now. Samoa can beat anyone when they are playing at their best, but you never know if that Samoa is going to show up or not. Spain and Portugal can keep things interesting, maybe Russia as well after a year on the SWS circuit."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,Mariusuiram,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:58:58 2015 UTC,"Problem with a year on the SWS is there is a huge gap between the teams on the circuit and the rest of the world. Just look at Japan.  Russia looked solid in HK but I guess the risk is whether the calibre of players is high enough. Unfortunately if the fitness/skills arent high enough, no amount of adjustment will make a difference.  I guess the real question is whether there are more players that can get pulled into the 7s program now that its on the circuit. I have to imagine, the crew that qualified is probably not good enough to make much progress on the WS."

rugbyunion,39ul5r,mattgrande,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:01:22 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, it will be the same as the Women's World Series: Three groups of four teams, with the top two from each group, plus the two best third-placed teams, going onto a quarter final."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,Mariusuiram,2,Mon Jun 15 01:57:28 2015 UTC,"plus the two best third-placed teams, going onto a quarter final.   I always feel like this is a bit bizarre. Very often that 3rd place ranking will be point differential which means having an easy 4th can mean the 3rd is guaranteed. For example whichever pools have Brazil/Japan are highly likely to be the extra 3rds. The other pool will be stacked. Although I guess the hope is that if it is really even, you could wind up with 3 teams at 2-1...  How will they build the pools? I feel like the WS does it well. Would worry if its random. Even if they spread the top 4, there is still a double up. Just worry you could have a pool like: Fiji, SA, USA, Australia and another pool that is NZ, France, Japan, Brazil  In the end, I guess it doesnt really matter since only 1st through 3rd really matters in the Olympics."
rugbyunion,39ul5r,mattgrande,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:07:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm curious how seeding will go as well. I'd imagine the four from the World Series will be Top Seed, but after that, who knows?"
rugbyunion,39ul5r,Mariusuiram,2,Tue Jun 16 12:40:05 2015 UTC,"But with only three pools of 4, one pool still gets 2 of top 4.  Maybe they use WS standings and a countdown? Or alternating Countdown? Actually maybe its next year's WS standings to create some incentive. If we assume Canada wins repechage you get:  A: 1. Fiji 6. USA 8. Argentina 16. Brazil  B: 2. SA 5. Aus 9. Canada (or Samoa) 15. Japan  C. 3. NZ 4. GB 11. France 13. Kenya  Those seem sort of fair although pool C seems tough still. Canada or Samoa would be the highest ranked team not to qualify for the olympics...  EDIT: For completeness here is a straight countdown:  A: 1. Fiji 4. GB 8. Argentina 13. Kenya  B: 2. SA 5. Aus 9. Canada (or Samoa) 15. Japan  C. 3. NZ 6. USA 11. France 16. Brazil  I dont know. That seems like pool A becomes the toughest which seems backwards in terms of the #1 seed benefiting from their seed.  I guess its worth remembering that 8 make it through"

That's about a grand at present value, assuming an average 4% interest rate over the next 35 years.  So, basically they are looking for £6500 (x4) of present value money for the right to buy tickets for 35 years.   Doesn't seem like a great buy to me - they are looking to make a £10k profit (overall) on a 50 year debenture with only 35 years remaining. i.e. they want to get 15 years of ticket rights, and to make a profit on the debenture bond.

He is excellent in getting up in defence, and without Hooper maybe he would be useful. Toomua is not too bad on attack either.  If you want a more attacking player at 12, what about Toomua at fullback and Folau at number 12? Thinking well outside the box."

We have locks that specialise in 1 or 2 areas, but no real outstanding locks that can do everything at international level (line out, scrum, clear rucks, mongrel the opposition).  Horwill had it, doesn't have it now. Simmons has the set piece but falls down around the ground, Skelton isn't a lineout target at all (maybe quick throws at 2 but that's it & that'd cause variation problems)  & his scrumming still needs improvement.   Workrate locks - Carter seems to have fallen away, & Jones & Timani don't seem quite there yet in the set piece.

It just completely shits me that not having 2-3 decent locks means we consistently have to make trade-offs in the loosies.  IMHO,  we have been playing moneyball for years with the loosies & locks to get a competitive forward pack.  Fardy is a great example of not really being a loose ball carrying 6, but an undersized tight playing lock playing 6 internationally. He does a great job, but he's not a true 6. You then have to compensate for him playing tight by playing roaming, linking loosies like Hooper, Higgers & McMahon."

rugbyunion,39uud1,im_philbo,3,Mon Jun 15 03:49:21 2015 UTC,"I see AAC as a reserve - covers 13, wing and full back very well.  I cant dee Hooper being omitted from the match day squad entirely. Especially for Dave Dennis.  And agree with the point about Giteau."
rugbyunion,39uud1,ridgy_didge,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:27:39 2015 UTC,"Giteau's more flexible positionwise than Cooper. Ashley-Cooper's consistency has deservedly kept him in the Wallabies for the past several years, bench or injury cover. This year has been no different. If Cooper takes the place of someone,  it will be a forward. And actually, Hooper should be there instead of Coleman."

I know it doesn't leave much room for the backs on the bench. Probably not that well thought through but it will be a forward dominated world cup, I feel.   Ideally I would test the halves combinations and treat each pair as a single player. Phipps/Foley are more reliable, Genia/Cooper a bit of a gamble which could pay off. Would see how both did in camp and then decide - ideally I would choose Cooper/Genia. If we can get Genia to start focusing on faster ball and get both players in a more confident mindset - we are gold.  It's a real tough choice for Cheika. However, the pack is looking good. Enough experience there to cover for the young players Skelton and Coleman, who can be motivated to be the main physical force of the side. Will be a very strong scrum also - which will be crucial."

Or maybe just ignoring the fact that he is literally the best in the world under the high ball. And as far as running counter attackers go, he has some of the best stats for slipping first tacklers. Fullback doesn't seem out of place, but I'm guessing you think he should be wing?"
rugbyunion,39uud1,Bangkok_Dave,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:50:00 2015 UTC,When did he win the 'literally best in the world under the high ball' award? I'd say Rob Kearney is every bit as good. Literally of course.
rugbyunion,39uud1,KingMunners,2,Mon Jun 15 23:11:32 2015 UTC,He can jump over both Kearneys and get the ball. His work under the high ball is outstanding. I'd argue Ben Smith's the world's best fullback but in that area it's Folau.
rugbyunion,39uud1,Bangkok_Dave,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"Literally the best, because I would say that he tops everyone in the code for the challenge. I can't think of one other person that would worry me going up for that contest against him."
rugbyunion,39uud1,KingMunners,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"Ben Smith is the best in the world under the high ball (as well as every other aspect of FB play).

Though I think Smith is a better well-rounded fullback in terms of positioning and defence, I still wouldn't trade a guy who has played 3 years of rugby and is already considered one of the best in the world. If he stays in the code, he can only continue to get better while learning more about it."

Brown, Halfpenny, Kearney, Dagg, Le Roux and Ben Smith are all very very good under the high ball. And none of them have knocked on from a simple pick-up under almost no pressure in the last 8 months - unlike Folau.  It's true that one day he may well become an excellent fullback. Right now though he is a much better winger."

rugbyunion,39uud1,Grandmaster_flashes,0,Mon Jun 15 03:29:59 2015 UTC,i did say 10 onwards so 11-15. Leiliafano would definitely be ahead of Toomua for the 12 as he's   -Playing regularly -Provides a goal kicking option  White is definitely tongue in cheek due to Phipps being an absolute C-bomb.

rugbyunion,39uonx,batzman,6,Mon Jun 15 20:58:55 2015 UTC,Definitely need a life ban or long term ban such as 10 years. Can't let players think they attack the ref and get away lightly. Having high quality referees is very important to the whole rugby ecosystem.

The life ban doesn't have to be permanent, if he cleans up his act he should be allowed some sort of dispensation. I feel giving him an arbitrary 2 year ban & expecting him to mature during that time is a bit naive.

I'm still unsure why NBC is the target of the upset when the actual organisers are the ones who are guilty of offensive levels of mismanagement. They are the ones who denied the female players with a single changing room and put a monster gap between the mens and women's final, pretty much guaranteeing everyone would go home before it started. On the NBC front I'm not a fan of these negative campaigns, berating people into accepting your view is unlikely to win me over and I assume there are plenty of other people who have that reaction. The negative petition demanding an apology should be a positive petition showing how many people are calling out for the female teams to get their games televised too."

So if it isn't my club/ team and isn't of a requisite standard, I simply won't make the effort to watch.  For me to spare valuable time away from men's sports means the women's efforts need to be exceptional. I'm certainly not the Lone Ranger here.  NBC knows this. They've a history of commercial sports broadcasting. They know their audience and what they can charge for advertisement. Without this financial support, there's no justification for demanding that women should have pay equality in sport.  Now to the tournament in question: Only an imbecile would not realise the order in which you schedule games. The last game of the day is the final - the one with the highest skill level. The penultimate. So the women's final should have been played before the men's."
rugbyunion,39tric,_antipodean_,3,Sun Jun 14 22:56:02 2015 UTC,"So if it isn't my club/ team and isn't of a requisite standard,    How does this not apply to this entire tournament though?"
rugbyunion,39tric,mtwestmacott,3,Sun Jun 14 21:11:28 2015 UTC,The penultimate.    Penultimate means second-to-last.

""And best of all, in both types of rugby the men’s and women’s games are played with the exact same rules – same ball, same pitch, same pace, same hits.""  Here's the problem; women's Rugby DOESN'T have the same pace, hits or athleticism and the world's best women's team would lose to an average school First XV."
rugbyunion,39tric,squatdog_nz,5,Mon Jun 15 07:00:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're trying to say that they run at the same speed, just that the game looks roughly the same (maybe take it down a notch as far as each level of representation).

rugbyunion,39tric,squatdog_nz,-3,Sun Jun 14 23:43:02 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I'm talking about the HBHS 1st XVs of the early 2000s that would be undefeated and make up a large proportion of the NZ U19s and Secondary Schools sides.  They would without a doubt beat Tonga and Fiji and hang close to the Samoan side of the days. They would barely have any size deficit or speed deficit, and have some great skill.  The disparity between top secondary school rugby and international teams outside the Top 15 is not very large, if not non-existent."
rugbyunion,39tric,kiwirish,7,Mon Jun 15 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"There is an immense disparity between schoolkids with a maximum age of 18 and professional, adult athletes.  LMAO@a First XV beating Tonga, Fiji or Samoa...you have absolutely NO IDEA what you are talking about."

rugbyunion,39tric,andymo,0,Mon Jun 15 00:40:39 2015 UTC,"Kings, MAG, AG, hamilton boys, Rotorua boys, CHCH, and DG would probably beat our womens team.  There are some fucken amazing players in our womens side (like McAlister) but there just aent effective forward packs at the moment."

rugbyunion,39tric,TheTallestGnome,4,Mon Jun 15 02:52:24 2015 UTC,"""Collegiate Ruggers""   ""Ruggers"" was mentioned 3 times in this poorly written article. Women have all the right to be upset over poor tournament management and improper facilities, but don't get mad when people don't love something as much as you do. Claiming ""same pace, same hits."" is just a lie and is misrepresenting the game.   I don't really have a solution to the problem, it just seems like this kind of article is definitely not the right way to go."

I accept that we're not a top-tier team and I'm grateful for the accommodations we DID receive.  Honestly, we played outside on the best fields I've ever stepped foot on, had complete access to medical staff, excellent refereeing, etc. CRC's has come ahead leaps and bounds since it began and teams played on Neuman University practice fields."

rugbyunion,39skuu,dr_chim_richaldz,2,Sun Jun 14 16:53:10 2015 UTC,It was ever thus in World Cup years. No coach wants to have some uncapped flash in the pan get his side knocked out of the tourney while some long-in-the-tooth stalwart is interviewed from back home.  EDIT: I suppose Khunt is not quite in this mould.
rugbyunion,39skuu,minutesir,2,Sun Jun 14 20:05:33 2015 UTC,"While this is true, Horwill is there because he is the most reliable Tight Head Lock in the country - at least in terms of scrummaging, which is where we need the most help.

rugbyunion,39skuu,dmanhimself,4,Sun Jun 14 19:51:04 2015 UTC,"He's had an outstanding last 4-6 weeks. In general play, he's probably been the pick of the hookers in Australia during that time."
rugbyunion,39skuu,krakkerz,3,Sun Jun 14 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"He's a far better hooker than Fainga'a, probably the best in Aus behind Moore IMO."
rugbyunion,39skuu,projone,2,Sun Jun 14 21:43:00 2015 UTC,"That said, I still think Faingaa is a fantastic hooker. For a position that lacked so much last year, it has some great depth this year."
rugbyunion,39skuu,dr_chim_richaldz,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:12:32 2015 UTC,Latu imo is the form hooker from the competition. despite his brain explosions. Which saddens me 'cause Tuffers is a old fav of mine.

I think he's a bit too hot headed to consider this year, and TPN's scrum work is much stronger. Either way, the no.2 jersey has some exciting and healthy competition."
rugbyunion,39skuu,dr_chim_richaldz,2,Sun Jun 14 23:57:43 2015 UTC,And stats wise Hugh Roach would be a great number 2 for the 2 at any other club.  Awesome Tah depth.

Simmons and Horwill have been off the boil and Horwill has had all the discipline of the three year old. Cooper is playing well but short on match time, but I think you have to pick him. Genia is more hot and cold than a Katey Perry song.  Kerevi is a good pick. JOC doesn't know if he is coming or going. And other than getting off the gear Hunt hasn't done a lot."
rugbyunion,39skuu,Jimbo762au,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:20:45 2015 UTC,Faingaa's getting a call up because he was by far our most consistent hooker at Test level last year. Simmons is a specialist lock and can call a lineout when no other bolters in the fowards can.
rugbyunion,39skuu,shulzi,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:18:25 2015 UTC,"I honestly done remember Faingaa playing that much last year didn't every hooker in the country get injured, I could be wrong. Jones calls a line out."

rugbyunion,39skuu,shulzi,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:49:27 2015 UTC,"There are at least 4 super rugby level line out callers. You don't have a be a ""pure"" lock to be a good lock."
rugbyunion,39skuu,Jimbo762au,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:55:36 2015 UTC,You kinda do at Test level. i.e. the size of a pure lock creates certain advantages that other positions aren't able to deal with. Considering someone like Jones or Fardy or Dennis as a starting lock at Test level is thus an exercise in futility.
rugbyunion,39skuu,shulzi,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:01:37 2015 UTC,Jones is only 3cm shorter and 3kg lighter than Simmons. They are practically the same profile. Also he has done mother but lock for the Rebels for the last 2 years.

rugbyunion,39skuu,GreatJusticeForSGU,17,Sun Jun 14 10:39:33 2015 UTC,"Lopeti Timani, he has been a wrecking ball and working hard all over the park.   Also I think Nic Stirzaker would be worth a run in the squad, he has been playing well all year.   Also to a much lesser extent Jack Debreczeni could be worth a trot as he can play all over the back line and can kick about 200m.  Mitch Inman & Dom Shipperley have also been topping the stats regularly. Hell Inman has to be the best defensive 12 in Australia.  I'm not saying they should all be in the match day 23 or even the rugby championship squad but I think they should get a run in the training squad."
rugbyunion,39skuu,Jimbo762au,4,Sun Jun 14 11:19:50 2015 UTC,"I'm really surprised Timani isn't in there considering who is. That's bugs me a little. I'd certainly have him inside the 45, 31 and even 23 man squads. Not sure how they justify his exclusion."
rugbyunion,39skuu,dr_chim_richaldz,3,Sun Jun 14 16:49:05 2015 UTC,Timani allllll the way.   But you gotta think about the structure of them pack at the wobblies level... is he a 4/5 or a 6 or 8?  It seems that he doesn't get lifted... so ya. interesting.
rugbyunion,39skuu,astroboy589,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:23:24 2015 UTC,He's too small for a test level lock and we've got backrow depth for days. Also GAGR's article today about blindsides point out he still commits a lot of errors.
rugbyunion,39skuu,shulzi,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:19:32 2015 UTC,In addition to u/shuizi's post - he took literally 3 lineouts all year. That's just not remotely good enough for a test lock.

rugbyunion,39skuu,monsolympus,3,Sun Jun 14 10:46:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, would agree that Inman has probably been dudded again.  Seems like they are thinking of Kerevi to be the backup to Kurindrani.  Though I reckon both O'Beiber and Hunt are there provide an option if Folau gets injured."

rugbyunion,39skuu,GreatJusticeForSGU,2,Sun Jun 14 10:49:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're probably right. Debreczeni needs to mature and after watching how slowly Stirzaker was shoveling the ball out this weekend he can't really compare with those three."
rugbyunion,39skuu,elderster,8,Sun Jun 14 10:57:48 2015 UTC,They're both going to get there though and it's going to be a good pair to build the national team around.  I'm looking forward to them both having a good NRC season again.

rugbyunion,39skuu,sackrace,2,Sun Jun 14 23:38:33 2015 UTC,Even as a Reds fan I can't live in denial. This squad is just mostly to make up the numbers until the Super Rugby season is over and the majority of the final squad are available.
rugbyunion,39skuu,DoctorDbx,2,Mon Jun 15 03:51:51 2015 UTC,"From a Reds supporter point of view:  -Holmes -Hansen -Gill -Slipper -Kerevi  These guys deserve the call up, Gill and Holmes have been outstanding and consistent throughout the season. Slipper is the incumbent and Kerevi has shown that he is at least a wallaby in waiting.  -Genia -Cooper  These 2 haven't really had much of a chance to prove their worth. Genia has been hot and cold and Cooper hasn't had much game time to impress. However these 2 are first class players and also have the experience (Particularly RWC experience). Cooper also has a strong case of being a solid 10 that can - at minimum - steer a team on the world stage. So I say let them play through the Rugby Championship and re-assess from there.  -Hunt  A puzzling one, maybe Cheika thinks there is potential there that he can unlock?  -O'Connor  Again, puzzling. Yes, there is talent there, but has hardly been putting that talent on display.  -Horwill -Simmons  Again, this is a tough call, with both not really being on their game all season i find it hard to reconcile their call up. Simmons could be admitted because of his lineout calling, but thats about it."

Do you mean have them as starting 9 and 10? I think the incumbents have shown more than enough this year to be starters, Foley has been on the top of the stats sheet for flyhalfs in Super Rugby in almost every facet of the game, and he was last year as well.   Would you have Genia over White on the bench? I'm not a huge fan of White but he has definitely played better than Genia this year."

No, I do believe that the Phipps/Foley pairing is a much better option as starters, but Genia/Cooper are still worth a shot, even if they come on with 20-10mins left.  and having the potential of Genia, Cooper & Beale play as close out subs could be quite exciting."

If you're going to go about carding and citing players based on the outcome of jumping for the ball (i.e. a player can compete legitimately, but still be carded if the opponent hurts themself), rather than the intent and actual way they jumped for it, then you may as well not have it in the game.  Edit: Come on guyz, use your words, not your downvotes. I think everyone would agree that there have been some absolutely ridiculous yellow cards because of competition in the air. Judging each case on its own merit is far too subjective, and realistically the only way you can have it objectively is if you put all the responsibility on either the defending or attacking player, which leads to bullshit yellow cards."

From what I've witnessed over the last decade, the All Blacks have the power, pace, vision and skill to take a game to a level other nations can't match.  When South Africa played the way they are capable of to determine the Rugby Championship in 2013, it contributed to the best game I've ever seen and yet the All Blacks still won in a nine try fest of power attacking rugby."

Could be really interesting impact 8-10 years from now.  Mike Friday said it best: he doesn't expect tons of Americans to focus on rugby, but if they can play as kids they can learn the fundamentals. Then even if a guy is crossing over from football after not making the NFL, he has the basics in place and it's a much more reasonable development process."
rugbyunion,39rn3i,Mariusuiram,2,Sun Jun 14 05:57:02 2015 UTC,"I'd be hesitant at thinking tag rugby has all the fundamentals of the full impact game.  Especially if you don't do scrummaging properly. It'll produce backs who are good at hitting a good line for offloads but that is about it really. There's a lot in body positioning in the tackle, protecting the ball and getting over the game line.  There's also a lot in the breakdown i.e. rucks and mauls. Tag rugby just won't teach these basics."
rugbyunion,39rn3i,Daleyo,5,Sun Jun 14 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"Well of course not, you can't teach 100% of the fundamentals without just playing full contact but it will teach handling, alignment and so on and that's no bad thing"

South Africa play bully  along with tag at the younger age groups too - full contact at walking pace.   Edit - having looked up the ages of middle school, it'd be 13 - 15 year old. Definitely should be doing contact by then."
rugbyunion,39rn3i,Daleyo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"Middle school is really 12 to 14 and this whole initiative I believe starts around 9-10.  While it's fine to be saying that they should be in contact already, the US is becoming more and more aware of head injury and other issues (primarily related to American football) so you see less and less youth sports with contact.  These kids are going into high school (4 years before university) and many move into contact rugby as one of their many sports. There are also still younger contact clubs and certain schools. But if you make it a hard requirement to be contact in elementary and middle school, you will lose a huge portion of the schools and parents.  Key is trying to expose as much of the population as possible. And go from there"
rugbyunion,39rn3i,Mariusuiram,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:51:57 2015 UTC,"I understand your point that it's better to get the numbers going, but I maintain it'll be a disadvantage in the long run for a kid who wants to take the game seriously to have spent the years 12-14 playing tag rather than full contact.  Though obviously there is some risk of head injury as rugby is a contact sport, any long term risk is actually lessened by learning how to go into contact properly from a younger age where you are too light to really damage each other (unless you're too much of an idiot to learn &/ your name is Leigh Halfpenny).  We do tackling from the age of 8 in mini rugby in England and it has been like that for at least the 23 years since I was in the under 9s. While the professional sport has some issue with head injuries (due to the increased physicality since the professional era began), the amateur game and younger age groups are fine and have no real problems that I have seen, even having grown up in the era that dump tackling was just a good hit."
rugbyunion,39rn3i,Daleyo,2,Mon Jun 15 09:11:16 2015 UTC,"http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/page/popwarner/pop-warner-youth-football-participation-drops-nfl-concussion-crisis-seen-causal-factor  You have to understand the sensitivity to injury and if most uninformed Americans see rugby as ""football without pads"" it takes a bit more to explain to them how its safer and if learned properly can be introduced to kids.  To be fair, proper youth rugby and inclusion of rugby as a HS varsity program is also growing in the US. http://usarugby.org/youth  The ""gimmick"" with Rookie Rugby or whatever they are calling it is that instead of trying to convince people to dedicate resources to a new sport, they are funding the training and introduction as a PE (Physical Education) alternative basically. Its specifically targeted at circumventing all the additional concerns and challenges and generating general awareness of the sport. Its like someone is funding ""a better tag"" or a ""better dodgeball"" game for kids. They are bringing a new game to play in school, providing free resources on how to do it + training for coaches / teachers; which is basically bribing them. http://usarugby.org/rookie-rugby#language=english   Youth leagues still exist and in theory, kids will filter from Rookie Rugby in gym class to real rugby if they are interested and convince their parents. Again, not defending the US fear of contact, but I think its a brilliant program for a country that has like less than 1% awareness of what rugby even is. In a few years and with limited funding, they have 10x or even 50x more kids playing ""Rookie Rugby"" than ever played youth rugby in the US and its not cannibalizing real rugby at all."

rugbyunion,39qwqx,p-wing,11,Sun Jun 14 03:03:22 2015 UTC,"This isn't an indictment towards you specifically, I just wanted a place to offer up some word vomit here because it's relevant:  The NFL had this same basic divisional system for 32 years (three divisions, 13-16 teams per conference), and the playoffs and schedule were very similar to this for the last dozen or so. I thought it was the best format I've ever seen - not ""perfect"", but excellent. Teams with better records got shafted all the time (and still do), but we accept it because the focus is so clearly on divisional games.  This last year, as well as a few seasons ago, we had 7-win teams make the playoffs. A lot of people thought it was unfair - not necessarily for their team, but as a system - but there were a lot more people (especially in r/NFL) who defended it on the basis of scheduling. NFL club schedules have 6 games (formerly 8) in the division, and their out-of-division schedule is 80% identical to their divisional rivals - in effect, 14/16 games are the same, just like Super Rugby.  At the end of the day, it comes down to a few things for the Crusaders:   You didn't take care of business at home, and finished next-to-last in your conference. The schedule is designed to make home-country games more important. The playoffs are not there for your benefit - they exist to account for scheduling inequities and make a boatload of money.   And like I said, the NFL's been doing this same system (or some variation of it) for 25-45 years depending on what you're talking about...and more NFL fans defend it than criticize it.  The only thing I wish for Super XV is that they could get those last two games in there against out-of-conference teams."
rugbyunion,39qwqx,sackrace,5,Sat Jun 13 22:53:57 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that it would be nice if everyone in the finals series had actually played the same teams in their interconference games, stuff like that definitely afects the run to the finals.   I guess I'm just saying that it is a bit unfair, but it's probably a necessary evil to have the game strong in all 3 countries. I do sort of wish they'd kept the number of teams manageable to that they didn't have to use a conference system. Australia just doesn't need 5 teams, much as I root for the Force to come good and love the Rebels run this year."

I'm starting to get tired of the ""full league"" table, and wishing at least the AFL would divide into three divisions like Super Rugby has, to keep from having nearly as many ""dead rubber"" games. I really LOVED the old ""three divisions of 5"" system in the NFL in the 1990's, ESPECIALLY after it was gone. It had a sort of magic about it that's been lost in nearly any other format, and I can't really explain well.  I recommend not ditching it just because it makes you feel bad for a 7th-place club every few years - they knew the stakes going into the season and didn't get it done, and it's not worth changing this beautiful format just to let the Kiwis over-saturate the playoffs with a team that ranked one off the bottom domestically."
rugbyunion,39qwqx,sackrace,6,Sat Jun 13 23:03:35 2015 UTC,"I think part of it is the Crusaders are in great form right now and people are forgetting they had a terrible start to the season which is why they've missed out, so you're probably on the nose there, they did have their chances to lock up a spot."
rugbyunion,39qwqx,p-wing,2,Sat Jun 13 23:05:43 2015 UTC,"Ah...yeah, the easiest argument against that is ""the league is 4 months long, not 4 weeks.""  I wonder if there are more Crusaders fans that are truly salty about it, or just other fans that are being salty as a surrogate."
rugbyunion,39qwqx,BradelBound,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:12:22 2015 UTC,"Crusaders fan here. For my part, I'm a little amused we missed out, but not mad at all. My opinion is, we should have been fighting for a much higher spot than 6/7. If we're going to have a bad season, who really cares whether we get 6th or we get 7th?  It was a bad season. There will be others. We're the Crusaders, after all."
rugbyunion,39qwqx,kiwirish,5,Tue Jun 16 03:55:25 2015 UTC,"Those dead rubbers should still be played though, because they can still be exciting games and give younger talent a chance to play and prove themselves without management's fear of playoff losses.  The Super 12 was the best format we ever had. Single round robin, one bye, semifinals and final. The Super 14 was okay too, it just sucked to have an extra SA game every other year. Super 15 could still be a SRR with quarters, semis and finals. Singular bye, so the tournament finishes in 18 weeks, no playoff byes. No complaints about strength of schedule, only the best team wins."
rugbyunion,39qwqx,p-wing,2,Sat Jun 13 23:12:48 2015 UTC,"dead rubbers should still be played   Of course, it's just in the organizers best interest to limit the number of those games that naturally fall into the schedule - as many teams as possible should be fighting for something meaningful, without having a relegation system or some impression of a diluted playoffs.  I don't necessarily agree with you about ""which format was best,"" only that the current format is something I wish we still had in the NFL. Single-round-robin doesn't get enough credit, though, and this would be a great competition with SRR and no other changes...but keep the 6-team playoff, it's excellent and I personally incorporate it whenever I can.  Late-season fighting for byes AND home games is better than just fighting for home games and lower seeded opposition. A lot of people (mostly, yanno, soccer people) don't understand that."
rugbyunion,39qwqx,BullNiro,2,Sat Jun 13 23:17:39 2015 UTC,"You can't do that with AFL, it would shit too many people. Remember until 1980 it was just 11 teams from Melbourne plus Geelong.

I've never been there, so you're probably right, but I'd still like to know what I'm misunderstanding.  I've been following the AFL for about a dozen years, and reading people bitch about ""the draw"" nearly the entire time. Three divisions are kind of the obvious solution, so long as common rivals are kept together and the Pies feel like they've gotten enough concessions out of the deal."
rugbyunion,39qwqx,BullNiro,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:35:21 2015 UTC,"No one really gives a shit about the VFL and there is still the feeling that the AFL is at it's heart a Victorian competition. The obvious solution to the draw is giving Tasmania and Canberra teams and making the comp single round robin with home and away alternating each year.  Rivalry in the AFL runs deep and wide, there's no way you could do it without severely disadvantaging smaller clubs and the interstate clubs."

rugbyunion,39qwqx,p-wing,3,Sat Jun 13 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"I think this is part of the story. Important but not the full picture.  Did the top teams fill their boots against weak opposition (cheap points), or did they knock off top teams (hard won)?  Now apply that thinking to homeland and overseas. I think that's where you see if teams get cheap overseas points.  I think taking into account both these factors you can then judge the worthiness of the top qualifiers.   Perhaps playing each team twice h&A would eliminate that (plus more rugby!)."
rugbyunion,39qwqx,DrRopata,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:36:37 2015 UTC,Yeah you might get lucky with the two teams you never face. I miss the old days of having fewer teams and a full round robin.

rugbyunion,39qwqx,Aquapig,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:47:26 2015 UTC,"It would add about 4-5 weeks onto the supercomp as it stands now.  As it stands, Super rugby is far more important here than the NRC. It brings in far more cash. The NRC is really a finishing school. It doesn't run for very long (12 weeks if I remember correctly).  It starts after the super rugby season starts. And it is so poorly organised that a fixture list hasn't been released yet.  We hardly saw any wallabies in the NRC due to the spring tours, & with the RWC, I doubt we'll see any appearing there in 2015."

rugbyunion,39s54w,Thelomen_Toblakai,2,Sun Jun 14 11:17:29 2015 UTC,"I think it might just be something to go on their record so it's not as spotless as it would otherwise be. So if you get a player getting a lot of warnings, you're probably going to be more likely to look harshly on them than if they had none, so they might get harder sanctions.  I think this is the perfect sort of hit to get a warning, because it was a bit high (shoulder to jaw), but frankly there wasn't much wrong with it other than that. It was more unfortunate than anything else, so a warning and nothing more seems appropriate. ""Keep them a bit lower in future, or there might be issues, okay?"""
rugbyunion,39s54w,MrTuxedoMan,2,Mon Jun 15 16:31:01 2015 UTC,I don't understand this citing commissioner warning stuff. I mean it was borderline whether or not it was even a penalty given Smith ducked into the tackle and it wasn't a shoulder charge. Assuming the ref just played on I think he made the right call.   All this warning does is undermine the referee's in the game. They are basically saying SBW didn't do anything to warrant a citing but they think the ref made a bad call.   Wouldn't it be more prudent to send the letter to the ref outlining why they feel the incident more serious than he thought it was rather than making a big stink about the player almost but not quite doing something that they'd have to deal with ?
rugbyunion,39s54w,KingMunners,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:36:57 2015 UTC,Not really sure it deserved a warning but Conrad definitely took it well. It was impressive to see him walk normally without any hesitation of what just happened.

That's the top 4 seeds, they will have home advantage in the quarters regardless of points.  What's interesting is the wild card places. Three extra Australasian teams will qualify, but only one extra South African team gets in.  So, to round up:  NZL and AUS groups: 1 seeded team, 0-3 wildcard spaces (probably 1 or 2).

The Stormers played weaker opposition more times, while the Chiefs/Highlanders/Hurricanes played each other twice. The Crusaders were also played twice, although they are not on the same level anymore.   I would say that the conference system wouldn't be as bad if every side just played each other once instead of playing teams from their country twice and missing out on playing two teams; but then the Stormers would probably have even less points compared to the Crusaders.  Crusaders don't deserve to win and likely would not have, but the whole structure is still toxic. I hope the Highlanders or Hurricanes get it."

rugbyunion,39ql3g,ThaFuck,-7,Sun Jun 14 02:39:43 2015 UTC,Talk about defensive   My team didn't make the cut either despite it also being the 4th best team in our country. Do you see me having a cry about the system?
rugbyunion,39ql3g,fernta,5,Sun Jun 14 02:59:16 2015 UTC,despite it also being the 4th best team in our country.    Are you comparing the Reds with the Crusaders? If you really think that the NZ conference is equal to the Australian one you are nuts.
rugbyunion,39ql3g,ChampagneBowl,9,Sun Jun 14 06:11:22 2015 UTC,Nope. But I see you having a cry about the reality that NZ teams would have dominated on basic merit.   In actual fact you seem to be bitching more about that in multiple posts ITT than anyone is actually complaining about the system itself.
rugbyunion,39ql3g,fernta,-13,Sun Jun 14 03:33:40 2015 UTC,"But I see you having a cry about the reality that NZ teams would have dominated on basic merit.    Mate you're on fucking drugs or high on your own shit. Either way, stop replying to me thanks."
rugbyunion,39ql3g,DoctorDbx,4,Sun Jun 14 03:39:39 2015 UTC,Fantastic point. You've really thought this one through.
rugbyunion,39ql3g,deadlysyntax,3,Sun Jun 14 06:43:38 2015 UTC,"The whole point is to illustrate the fact that a particular conference's teams are most likely better than the other conferences, but because of the system aren't getting into the playoffs. That's exactly what is being discussed.  You can't compare the 4th highest ranked team in the Aussie conference to the same in the NZ conference and say they're equal exactly because of this system. It doesn't take a genius to observe this, nor does it mean that I'm whining considering it's a simple observation the OP pointed out..."
rugbyunion,39p5y4,jbarbz,17,Sat Jun 13 11:58:55 2015 UTC,Very amusing!  Last year I backed the Reds to make the finals this year. How wrong I was! They should have done better.   I think heads need to roll in the QRU - coaches and administrators alike. Remember how many people signed up for Reds membership this season? A huge amount.  What happened to the Reds this year has been a disgrace and can't be repeated next season.
rugbyunion,39p5y4,cubeyescube,9,Sat Jun 13 12:42:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. This review has been hyped so much, i will be very disappointed if a lot of people aren't replaced. You cannot have a team that looks like that on paper and performs utterly shit on the field. Graham can blame injuries all he wants, that wasn't the biggest problem"
rugbyunion,39p5y4,ssmooth_criminal,5,Sat Jun 13 12:59:47 2015 UTC,They smashed the crusaders too which kind of have people hope too.

A pre season game is basically opposed training nothing more nothing less."
