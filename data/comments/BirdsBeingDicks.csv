They block the parking lot exits, shit everywhere, and charge at you if you want to go through a door that they're close to.  And if you want to see something interesting, my local area had this story on the news a few days ago.  Not sure why they felt this was newsworthy, but they stirred up a big controversy, because people were outraged that the geese weren't controlled humanely. I was infuriated to see so many Facebook comments defending those bastard birds.  If it were up to me, people should be allowed to shoot as many geese as they want at any time. It should be applauded, not shamed. Man, fuck those birds."

BirdsBeingDicks,3dqu2a,LaTortugaConQueso,4,Sat Jul 18 15:55:04 2015 UTC,Why on earth would seagulls be protected? That's like protecting mosquitoes and rats.
BirdsBeingDicks,3dqu2a,wiccabilly,9,Sat Jul 18 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, the total number of seagulls (herring gulls) is actually quite low but their population density in some cities is so much higher than in other places that it seems like they're everywhere. Besides that, if they weren't protected, everyone would understandably start killing the little bastards, so they wouldn't last long."
BirdsBeingDicks,3dqu2a,wbyte,4,Sun Jul 19 10:21:09 2015 UTC,"Major problem is that we destroyed their normal, optimal breeding habitat. The flat roofs of cities are ok for them to nest on. Even though we now reestablished their normal habitat, these gulls all grew up in the city. If we kill all that live in the city we might wipe out the species.   Also they can have very specific feeding sites. In our country we have one gull that breeds in the colony in the dunes but is seen every day on a city bridge 50 km. away.   We might not like them, but they are a useful and interesting species.   Oh and just to be super pedantic, seagulls do not exist. There are gulls that live near and off the sea, but no seagulls."

BirdsBeingDicks,3bo6bk,Tuccker,39,Tue Jun 30 22:04:25 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they are thinking ""Holy shit, Steve's beating the crap out of Bill.*  Birds are very social, like junior high schoolers.  Everybody knows they're on the ""cool"" box, and Steve's not invited.  They aren't sure why, nothing against Steve, it's just that there's only room for five of us and Steve isn't one of the five.  So when Steve stands there looking all left out, there was probably one or two of them that thought ""Steve's alright.  Look Steve, let's hang out some time.  It's just -- I'm on the cool box right now, know-wha-mean?""  Steve knew exactly what he meant.  And Steve didn't give a fuck.  Steve had enough.  Steve isn't a little kid anymore, and Steve fuckin went for it.  I saw a juvinile sea lion do the same thing on a floating dock.  Swam around and around the dock, talking to people, trying to get an invite.  Finally said ""Fuck it!"", hopped up, turned that bitch over and dumped about half the grownups into the drink.  Everybody turned and bitched him out good.  And he didn't care, because inviting yourself to adulthood is something every vertebrate needs to do."
BirdsBeingDicks,3bo6bk,MeepleTugger,28,Wed Jul 1 05:09:22 2015 UTC,"What function is looking serving for them.   They need to see why their friends had fallen, or more importantly, why they were suddenly not there. The instinct is that because they suddenly disappeared, a predator may be nearby, so they're running over to check. Source: idk I'm just stoned"
BirdsBeingDicks,3bo6bk,WatchOutRadioactiveM,7,Wed Jul 1 02:21:39 2015 UTC,laughs When my bird does it... It's to ensure the dog ate whatever just fell... I certainly hope that wasn't the case.
BirdsBeingDicks,3bo6bk,Paperdawl,9,Wed Jul 1 03:50:47 2015 UTC,"I think you're right.  They run over to look because they're interested, and they want to know what happened.  Maybe to see if one of their associates got hurt.  But they knew it wasn't a predator; it was definitely Steve.  They've got eyeballs (better than ours). Birds watch a fight for the same reasons we do: to make sure noone gets hurt, and to see who's cool under pressure."

Evolution forges the beings so that they interact with their environment in a way that benefits their survival, so a bird, just like a cat, would strive to know the whereabouts of a relevant being that was there until a moment ago.  The fact that there's possibly brawl might play a role, too."

And if you were talking but not at the bird it gets jealous and screeched as loud as it could. Also did that when you were trying to watch tv, were ignoring her when she wanted attention, or because you were asleep while she was up. The bird learned how to open it's cage door and would use that as an opportunity to go screeching through the house trying to land on people's head.  And she likes to bite, especially my mom because the bird thinks it's funny when she freaks. Oh and she loved destroying toys she didn't like and knocking items off her cage, and flying across the room to knock over my grandmother's glass chess pieces. Birds are terrible people."

However under certain circumstances; say a cat that sees the bird as a prey (which is fair since it's a cat, and that's a bird), or a bird that isn't willing to defend itself enough to scare off the cat, which most birds I've known aren't afraid to; then it may be necessary to get the cats declawed or put on some kind of gel cap."

BirdsBeingDicks,3afmx7,nvaus,8,Sat Jun 20 08:45:49 2015 UTC,"Declawing is amputation; it is not merely the removal of the claws. To declaw a cat, the veterinarian cuts off the last knuckles of a cat's paw – cutting through bone, tendons, skin and nerves. In a person, it is equivalent to amputating each finger or toe at the last joint. Declaw surgery can be an extremely painful procedure with associated health risks and complications such as infection."
BirdsBeingDicks,3afmx7,Disobedientcat,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:56:56 2015 UTC,"To me the line between that and other common surgeries is not nearly wide enough to step into the territory of actual animal abuse. Maybe it's distasteful, but not abuse. The cat can still live a perfectly happy life after a few weeks of discomfort. If anything it seems like a step in the right direction to combat house cats from being so devastating to natural wildlife populations."
BirdsBeingDicks,3afmx7,nvaus,8,Sat Jun 20 11:11:14 2015 UTC,Reddit has decided its animal abuse. I have more of the mindset that leave them with their claws unless they prove aggressive. People tend to declaw them willy nilly and that's very unfair. Go ahead and remove their teeth while they are at it.
BirdsBeingDicks,3afmx7,T-MoneyAllDey,4,Sat Jun 20 15:00:22 2015 UTC,"Reddit and the veterinary community in general, as well as most animal shelters have decided it is animal abuse."
BirdsBeingDicks,3afmx7,stop_being_meta,6,Fri Jun 26 04:33:25 2015 UTC,"It also leads to a lot of behavioral problems. It takes away the cat's primary means of defense, which can make it more fearful and prone to biting, which is worse than scratches. They may also react much more aggressively when they feel threatened because of that, as well as being more vulnerable to predators, which means a declawed cat can't safely be allowed outside. The pain after a declaw operation is also pretty intense, and makes using the litterbox especially painful, so some cats associate the litterbox with pain afterwards and stop using it. Removing that joint of their toe also forces the cat to walk differently and can affect its balance or cause other problems. Declawing has some very serious longterm consequences and doesn't have any benefit for the cat--it's entirely about the human's convenience. There are many more humane ways of keeping the cat from scratching furniture or people without the negative side effects of declawing, but of course they require effort on the part of the cat's owner."

They reduce or eliminate the risk of certain cancers, make it less likely that the animal will run away and become injured or get in a fight in search of a mate, eliminate the discomfort associated with going into heat, and prevent the birth of unwanted animals who would otherwise end up homeless, in a shelter, or possibly euthanized. Declawing, on the other hand, only benefits the owner, at the expense of lasting harm to the animal."

BirdsBeingDicks,3a20cb,ProgramTheWorld,30,Wed Jul 8 06:09:45 2015 UTC,"I learned about the criminal element among penguins at the zoo a few years ago. Here's the story I posted about it before:  I was at the zoo, watching the penguins, and a zookeeper stopped next to me. She started telling me all about their social life.  This particular type of penguin (I don't remember what kind) builds its nest in little caves in the side of big rocks. She explained that the male penguins decorate the caves to attract females. The more ornate the cave, the more likely to attract a female to mate with.  She told me that one of the penguins had a really nice cave and he had a girlfriend. But, another penguin came and stole all his cool shit and the female bailed, moving into the shifty penguin's cave. Not cool, female penguin.   Anyway, the jilted penguin started tearing up the ""carpet"" (some sort of ground cover under the rocks) in the corner of the habitat. The carpet was red on the underside. According to the zookeeper, penguin bitches love red carpet.  She said the penguin had been tugging at the material, spending hours a day trying to tear off a piece. I watched with her for like a half an hour. All the other penguins had various sized rocks in their caves, but this guy was determined to get that particular piece of carpet.  She showed me the girlfriend-thieving penguin's place and it was all tricked out in little pieces of twine and maybe some cloth in with the rocks. Real stylish. He'd stolen all of it.  I honestly could have watched for hours, but they were closing. It was like a little penguin Melrose Place. When I retire, I plan to find a zoo like this, pull up a chair and watch Penguin Place all day."

BirdsBeingDicks,37ptia,Snart_the_Cat,8,Sat May 30 06:39:20 2015 UTC,There's probably a nest nearby.   In the early spring you can take a look for their nest(s?) and knock 'em down before they lay eggs in it- that will encourage them to find a new place to nest (and without killing anything!)  If they have already successfully nested there (I'd guess they have from the dive-bombing) it may take a couple of times of knocking down their nests for them to move on to a new location.

Because I think you got something mixed up here, I'm no bird expert, but I know for a fact several species of Magpies are victims of Cuckoo birds, a species known and named for its brood parasitism, so much so that other species of birds that partake in brood parasitism have been affixed with the nickname cuckoo, such as the cuckoo duck.  It's a pretty bad idea to make a blanket statement about Magpies anyway, as their species is pretty broad when it comes to naming, hell there are entirely different species that have the same name, like the Eurasian Magpie which are Corvids, and the Australian Magpie belong to the Artamedae family, despite both being referred to as 'Magpies'."

If you are somewhere you can safely fire a gun without crossing any borders, you can shoot to scare it away or shoot to kill at your discretion (assuming you're American). There are also bird-specific live traps called larson traps. If it has a nest in the area, pull it down (if you don't want to kill their horrid little spawn, wait until they fledge) and keep pulling nests down if they return next year."

Maybe I have been lucky but there is really nothing to fear from geese.  Also, if you feel the need to attack a goose for whatever reason (don't), most are protected by migratory bird laws so if you or your dog hurt or kill a goose you could be hit with fines up to $10,000.

BirdsBeingDicks,32bvkk,davidd00,31,Sun Apr 12 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"Biologist here!  The goose looks like a Greater White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons). The ducks looks like your typical rapey Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). After looking at the video again the goose might be a Chinese Goose or a hybrid. Thanks to /u/Goose_Enthusiast for the help. I know the behavior better than individual species. :)  Chinese Geese mate for life, though this guy or gal is alone (males and females have the same plumage, they differ in size but I can't tell by this video what sex this goose is). It's either young and hasn't formed a pair bond yet, or it lost a mate.   Geese and ducks tend to hang out together and are pretty social. Near me it's usually Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and Mallards or Wood ducks (Aix sponsa), but other species being friendly wouldn't be surprising.   Here the distress calls of the female Mallard are enough to kick our Sheriff goose into high gear. I've seen Canada geese go after Fish crows (Corvus ossifragus) that were harassing Mallard chicks before, so it was neat seeing something similar in this video. What was surprising to me about this video was the veracity voracity of the goose! It was really committed well after the female duck was away, to show these males they are not welcome."

BirdsBeingDicks,32bvkk,Myrkull,16,Sun Apr 12 22:53:33 2015 UTC,Someone noticing a goose attacking a duck.
BirdsBeingDicks,32bvkk,I_RARELY_RAPE_PEOPLE,9,Sun Apr 12 16:28:11 2015 UTC,"OK.  Not a biologist, but a long time poultry keeper.  This is what happens when you mix larger and smaller waterfowl together.  If that goose was truly trying to mess up that duck then it would have grabbed the bird by the leg, pulled the leg until it popped out of joint, and shook it (kind of like a dog with a toy) breaking its leg, and then held it underwater.  A victim with broken limbs is not so likely to struggle with broken extremities as they are when intact. What you are seeing here is just normal waterfowl interaction.  The goose is likely the dominant animal in the yard/space and expects others to bow to its supremacy.  It got sick of the shenanigans and decided to step in to put an end to them.  It mounted the ""rapist"", held it down, and kept it away from its victim until the ""rapist"" settled down and swam away.  (Remember, ducks have an amazing capacity for hanging out under water; otherwise, they would starve.)  Another male stepped in and tried to mount the goose, but the goose was not having any of this shit and shrugged off male #2. This is just a prime example of dominance and submission in the barnyard/pond.  There was no risk of imminent death.  And the goose wasn't trying to stop a rape.  The goose was just sick of the noise and bruhaha, and decided to put an end to it.  Think of the goose as a firm, but friendly, bouncer at your local bar."

Males don't give a fuck for chicks and I've seen them kill the babies in a gang attack and just harass the female to exhaustion.  In the end it's still 1 female gives birth to babies of a male.

Certain techniques can have more or less importance depending on the species of bird or even their age, because a bird migrating for the first time has no landmarks to reference from for their migration so can rely almost entirely on magnetic fields or star navigation (or both). Magnetic fields play a pretty hefty role in a lot of bird species though, and for the most part more so than landmarks and star navigation."

BirdsBeingDicks,302it5,richmana,18,Tue Mar 24 01:20:08 2015 UTC,"I went to grad school in rural France, and lived in a medieval farm in the middle of BFE.    A mama duck decided to build her nest right next to the door of the house where we had all of our big parties, where people would step outside to smoke during dinner, etc.  I built her a house, and spent several weeks telling people to shut the fuck up and not disturb the duck nesting inside.  I came home one day to discover that two ducklings had hatched, and that the mama duck was struggling to get them down the patio stairs to the pond across our courtyard, so I put a plank in place, and ran inside to fetch my camera, going OHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD and squealing like a little girl, because fuck you, ducklings (I'm a 40-something dude.)    Unfortunately I think I may have freaked them out a bit because they were milling aimlessly around on this ramp.  As I tried to figure out what to do, a crow swooped down and grabbed one of the ducks.  The red mist came down, and I ran inside to get my (highly illegal, still can't believe I had the damn thing) .45 to fuck that crow's day up.  I had a moment of clarity and grabbed a broom instead, chasing the fucking crow fuck down about half a kilometer of country road.  All I found was a duckling, minus a head.    Fuck you, crow.   Soon after, our landlord came home and helped me herd mom duck and surviving baby duck into an old chicken coop, where they'd be safe from the crows.  That night, a fox snuck in and ate the duckling, although mom duck managed to hop onto a high-up ledge in the cage.    Fuck you, fox.  Our landlord had a bunch of Polish builders in, and he was PISSED.  So he grabbed one of these poor clueless dudes, rammed a shotgun into his hands, and yelled at him that he was now on fox duty, and if he saw a fox, crow, or anything else that even smelled of predator, he was to turn it into hamburger.    The poor Polish guy had probably never held a gun in his life, and now all of his construction worker buddies would laugh at him as he spent at least the next two weeks sitting on a lawn chair, with this massive shotgun, hoping no foxes would show up.  Fuck you, nature."

BirdsBeingDicks,2xv1mg,skelooth,2,Thu Mar 5 01:27:48 2015 UTC,"take the seeds away for a day or two, or just don't refill the seed dish. Most grocery stores (go to trader joe's if you have them near you) sell a veggie mix with peas, corn, green beans and stuff. If you can add pilaf rice all the better. Microwave it, put it on a plate. She'll eat it if there's no new seed there (typically a bird has favorite seeds, so don't entirely starve her of seed, but she'll run out of her favorites). Get her habituated to it, and limit the easy availability of seed so that she's eating her veggies.  Monitor her, of course, to make sure she isn't refusing to eat entirely. But unless she's incredibly stubborn she'll eat the veggies. Make sure there's protein--so again, don't cut the seed entirely unless there's beans and other protein. Just try to to limit the seed. There's a lot of info and advice about this problem online from more qualified people than I.  As to the egg laying, my gray lovie didn't start until year 5, though she was obsessively hormonal with the mating behaviors for a long time before then."

BirdsBeingDicks,2x394c,cuddIefish,2,Fri Mar 27 04:33:55 2015 UTC,"As a wildlife biologist, it's my job to observe, monitor, and study wildlife for a variety of reasons. Here are a few examples of the kind of jobs I have done:   Density Mapping prairie dog colonies. Using a GPS, I would walk on a transect (a measures line in a direction) and count all of the prairie dog burrows I encountered on my path. We could then determine which areas of the desert had the highest prairie dog abundances.  For two years I worked with the Black-footed Ferret, they are Americas most endangered mammal. We would drive around throughout the night, shining spotlights into the dark looking for their distinctive green eyeshine (like how dog eyes reflect in the dark). If we saw one, we would deploy a specially made trap to capture them. If caught, we sedate them, vaccinate them for a variety of diseases, and record where we caught them. All of the captured animals are named and microchipped for future identification. I radio tracked skunks for a Rabies study. We would trap the skunks overnight and sedate them to give them vaccines and put radio collars on them. We used certain radio collars that recorded how often they encountered other collared skunks. We used this information to determine how likely skunks are to transmit rabies to other skunks. I also miraculously never got sprayed. I'm writing this to you from a motel room outside of Wyoming on my way to work a seasonal job studying Sage Grouse. Like the skunks I worked with, we will be trapping these birds at night and radio collaring them to track them.  Being a wildlife biologist is an incredibly fun and fulfilling job, but it can be a very physically and mentally draining job. You will spend long periods of time in the remotest places, it can get lonely, reading and exercise helps, try not to pick up smoking. If you love the wilderness (camping, hiking, bugs birds and flowers, isolation) it can make you the happiest government employee in the world."

Using a 500mm lens and a 1.4x extender, Palmer photographed this dramatic midair scene of an eagle and a starling before his week-long encounter with the birds ended and the raptors left the area."

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

Delightful parrots, but like all 'Toos, can be more than a little volatile and dangerous as they reach puberty (Yay temper tantrums with a can opener for a face).  ALL cockatoos (and cockatiels too) make sounds similar to this. Cockatiels stop pretty much as soon as they can eat on their own. Cockatoos can and will make that noise for upwards of 12-18 months, regardless of the capability of eating independently.   This sound isn't just for food, though. Cockatoo babies remain with their parents for a few years and often even assist with the next clutch of babies and their feeding. That sound is actually one of some kind of need, be it food, protection, companionship, I'm stuck and don't want to jump off this tree branch, etc etc. When they are under about 2 years old and something traumatic happens, they might even regress for a few days to begging to be parent-fed and comforted.   TLDR: Cockatoo babies make horrific noises FOREVAR. Also, parrots are complicated.  EDIT: Can't spell. :("

It is a widespread and common species throughout Europe, the Middle East, Central and Northern Asia, and parts of North Africa in any sort of woodland. It is generally resident, and most great tits do not migrate except in extremely harsh winters. Until 2005 this species was lumped with numerous other subspecies. DNA studies have shown these other subspecies to be distinctive from the great tit and these have now been separated as two separate species, the cinereous tit of southern Asia, and the Japanese tit of East Asia. The great tit remains the most widespread species in the genus Parus.

I've seen the same sort of ""fight club"" activity in the spring time.  It's hard to capture on regular cameras because these guys are so quick.  The males will fight for dominance and when they do, I've watched the whole group get excited, make noise and gather around like it's entertainment, (or maybe they're concerned?) Either way, it's a lot of fun to watch."
BirdsBeingDicks,2nwl65,Batchet,-13,Mon Dec 1 13:55:05 2014 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""house sparrow is a sparrow.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a scientist who studies sparrows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls house sparrows sparrows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""sparrow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Passeridae, which includes things from snowfinches to bush petronias to eurasian tree sparrows.  So your reasoning for calling a house sparrow a sparrow is because random people ""see the same sort of ""fight club"" activity?"" Let's get lions and bats in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A house sparrow is a house sparrow and a member of the sparrow family. But that's not what you said. You said a house sparrow is a sparrow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the sparrow family sparrows, which means you'd call snowfinches, eurasian tree sparrows, and other birds sparrows, too.  Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

That many words as well as phrases is a significant number and would occupy a very large part of that birds vocabulary. probably near 70% of it actually. And yet somehow over his years upon years of existence he only picked up things relating to your dog? Highly suspect.  Plus she said the dog was barking at her wanting to go for a walk. The dog has a bark collar on. Gotta keep your lies consistent.

The bird is easily recognisable by its blue and yellow plumage, but various authorities dispute their scientific classification.  Eurasian blue tits, usually resident and non-migratory birds, are widespread and a common resident breeder throughout temperate and subarctic Europe and western Asia in deciduous or mixed woodlands with a high proportion of oak. They usually nest in tree holes, although they easily adapt to nest boxes where necessary. Their main rival for nests and in the search for food is the larger great tit.  The Eurasian blue tit prefers insects and spiders for its diet. Outside the breeding season, they also eat seeds and other vegetable-based foods. The birds are famed for their skill, as they can cling to the outermost branches and hang upside down when looking for food.

Around 12.5–14.0 cm (5.0–5.5 in) in length, the male and female are similar in colouration, with an orange breast and face lined with grey, brown upperparts and a whitish belly.

The family name, and that of the largest genus, Lanius, is derived from the Latin word for ""butcher"", and some shrikes are also known as ""butcher birds"" because of their feeding habits.

We had a pigeon fly into our store at work one day, and flap around against the windows trying to get out. Using gloves, I was able to carefully pick it up in such a way as to tuck its wings against its sides as well. Even so, I was worried about the possibility that I had damaged a wing or a bone in that bird as I carried it outside.  As I walked outside, and gently tossed it up and away, in front of a crowd of customers, my only thought was ""Man, if that bird flops and then lands on cement from ten feet up, I'm going to look like such a dick."""

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

Just a very unlucky (or lucky) coincidence.  http://i.4cdn.org/sp/1408196901139.webm  http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2dpt8n/has_a_bird_just_crapped_in_ashley_youngs_mouth/cjrvfd0  But bird is still being a dick for shitting on his back and making it look like it shit in his mouth  edit: it's his own spit in the mouth and not bird poop. Or is it really?
BirdsBeingDicks,2dpveo,neo7,8,Sat Aug 16 15:34:52 2014 UTC,You can see it in his mouth though...
BirdsBeingDicks,2dpveo,davidd00,14,Sat Aug 16 15:50:57 2014 UTC,That's spit from his own mouth. It lands behind him somewhere.
BirdsBeingDicks,2dpveo,THEsolid85,5,Sat Aug 16 15:54:40 2014 UTC,Explain how? You can see the tragectory of the thing that lands on his lip come at an angle away from him.
BirdsBeingDicks,2dpveo,angrytortilla,5,Sun Aug 17 06:28:16 2014 UTC,"He spits out the spit the same time as the bird poop falls behind him. You can tell, cuz he doesn't freak out immediately."

BirdsBeingDicks,2cvf39,tdogg8,3,Thu Aug 7 15:38:38 2014 UTC,what is a crop?
BirdsBeingDicks,2cvf39,finalremix,4,Fri Aug 8 05:20:03 2014 UTC,"A bird's crop is a bit in the bird's throat that's similar to a hamster's cheek pouches. They hold food and some grit (usually tiny rocks and such) in their crop, which is near their collar bone, to mush things up before finishing swallowing.  It's also one of the first things to check if you've got a sick bird on your hands. I work with pigeons, and a problem called ""crop stasis"" is a serious issue with sick birds. They can 'swallow' food into their crop, but it just sits there... so you end up with a bird with what looks like a huge water balloon on their neck."

You also have mink, stoat, martin, badgers, and otters. Many many many predators! If you include your marine mammals like seals and dolphins there are even more! No ecosystem is healthy without predators to eat just about everything. Predation pressure keeps ecosystems in balance :)"

BirdsBeingDicks,2at3bl,thersoiv,4,Wed Jul 16 03:27:55 2014 UTC,"O NO U DIN!  Corn is an ingredient or factor in almost every American processed food on the market due to its artificially deflated price. The price is decreased because the US government offers subsidies to corn growers. Manufacturers use corn as an ingredient because it's so cheap to purchase.  Some scientists would argue that corn is a factor in America's obesity epidemic.  If you go to Europe, it's extremely difficult to find an an obese person. Finding a morbidly obese person in Europe is almost impossible.  I believe farmers are partially at fault due to their complacency, but the US government is more at fault for offering the subsidies. I can't fault farmers for taking advantage of an economic opportunity. Still, I would hope that individuals would feel a moral responsibility to farm other crops."

I could Google just as many to support mine.  Secondly, cats don't belong inside either. Cats belong outside as much as dogs, and birds, and any other animal. You let them out in the day, and shut them in at night so they don't hunt. Do a bit of research on both sides before making stupid comments like that."

It was his second day in our house (on the first day he made the dog bleed and established dominance) and he was still small enough where when he sat up straight he could be held in one palm. This big robin, bigger than him, saw him leave the house and started swooping at him. On about the sixth time he jumped up several feet in the air and got him by the neck. That bird was bigger than him but he got him and took him around back where he was never seen nor heard from again. Made me so proud. He was a boss like that his whole life, too. Fought other cats, had a girlfriend down the street (who, sadly, came around after he was gone to look for him) that had kittens in our shed (one that looked just like him), all that jazz."

It was found from southern New York and Wisconsin to Kentucky, Tennessee and the Gulf of Mexico, from the Atlantic seaboard to as far west as eastern Colorado. It lived in old-growth forests along rivers and in swamps.  It was called puzzi la née (""head of yellow"") or pot pot chee by the Seminole and kelinky in Chickasaw.  Though formerly prevalent within its range, the bird had become rare by the middle of the 19th century. The last confirmed sighting in the wild was of the ludovicianus subspecies in 1910. The last known specimen perished in the captivity of the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918  and the species was declared extinct in 1939.

BirdsBeingDicks,269zaq,minnabruna,11,Fri May 23 06:31:45 2014 UTC,"It's likely an ostrich that is not fully grown - it seems kind of small (for an ostrich). The young ones and the females don't have he characteristic black-with-white-accents colors - they are shades of grey and brown. Also, the bird is throwing its wings up in an ostrich warning move and those wings appear to have the fluffier ostrich feathers on them (emus are a bit wirier).  On top of that, emus are more aggressive than ostriches - that bird didn't try to kick anyone in the head like an emu would be more likely to do. An ostrich might kick too but they are less likely to and when they do they usually kick in the stomach first and only follow up with a kick to the head if they feel really threatened. In this case the bird didn't kick at all.  Also helpfully, I watched the source video linked elsewhere in this thread and someone calls the bird an ostrich.   Source: I recently visited an ostrich farm that had a few emu too, which now of course means that I'm basically a fully-qualified expert on everything about all ratites."

The attempts to curb the population of emus, a large flightless bird indigenous to Australia, employed soldiers armed with machine guns—leading the media to adopt the name ""Emu War"" when referring to the incident.

I don't want to argue with someone who is a professional, but I just came back from two days at a farm where they ran the farm on the opposite principle. The emus were on lockdown (in the pasture and given more distance) than the more numerous ostriches (especially the adult males), who were watched and treated with respect, but not feared. Some staff said they had been kicked but they said that the ostrich kicks first at your stomach level, and then again at your head if they want to (but hadn't there). In contrast they said that the emus are more aggressive from the beginning."
BirdsBeingDicks,269zaq,Amphithere_19,1 point,Sat May 24 04:22:05 2014 UTC,"I guess I can only speak from my experience.  I have worked with Rheas, Ostriches, Emus, and one Cassowary.  The cassowary was of course the meanest and you never went in with her unless there were 3 people.  The rheas were decent, they like to peck at shiny things of stringy things, but they typically don't try to hurt people.  The emus we could go in with.  At the zoo I'm at there is only one, and he is a giant puppy-bird, but I've been to emu farms where people had no problems going in with the emus.  Every ostrich I have ever worked with, which is only like 3, has been an asshole.  You go in with a broom/rake or a big javelin thing.  If ostrich tries to get in your face you raise the rake up over your head to look big.  During mating season, if the ostrich tries to charge you, which they do all the fucking time, you have to brace this javelin thing against your hip and shunt them off to the side.  I will say that Ostriches and rheas are the most trainable of the ratites.  I've seen tractable ostriches, I think people ride them in some places so they can't be all bad.

BirdsBeingDicks,25q9nn,redwendigo,34,Sat May 17 12:20:07 2014 UTC,"We do feed the wildlife, so it is ultimately our fault that they hang around. But, the behaviour is actually caused by them seeing their reflection in the glass. Or rather, the male seeing his reflection- the female doesn't care. It's the height of breeding season, and this has been going on for a couple of weeks, but we don't expect it to continue indefinitely (at least, I hope not).  Food is usually placed on bird tables and in feeders, not directly near the house. In this instance, the food you see in the pic is either some cake or pie crust that was thrown out during one of the male bird's visits; he'd already been there, pecking the window, for about 20 minutes before that. Personally, I wouldn't have done that... what if he thinks he's being rewarded?  ""Hell yeah, I kicked that other guy's ass and he opened up and threw pie crust at me! Alpha as fuck."""

BirdsBeingDicks,25q9nn,crysisnotaverted,11,Fri May 16 23:24:44 2014 UTC,"Hahaha the picture idea might be funnier though. My neighbor has a fake owl up in the bushes in front of his front picture window, which has some kind of special tinting, because a cardinal would constantly body slam his reflection. No more agro cardinal, however we do now have a real owl that screetches at it occasionally in the summer (which doesn't bother me, as I love nature)."

Every once in a while the hawk would casually lift its claw and tear at the carcass.   I get it. The guy's got to eat. But, man, how cold is it to just sit there in the little birds' tree and eat their friend right in front of them while they are freaking out around him?

All amphibians, birds, reptiles, and monotremes possess this orifice, from which they excrete both urine and feces, unlike most placental mammals, which possess two or three separate orifices for evacuation.  The cloacal region is also often associated with a secretory organ, the cloacal gland, which has been implicated in the scent-marking behavior of some reptiles, amphibians, and monotremes.

BirdsBeingDicks,23qzpt,autowikibot,2,Thu Apr 24 04:24:39 2014 UTC,"Section 3. Birds of article  Penis:       Most male birds (e.g., roosters and turkeys) have a cloaca (also present on the female), but not a penis. Among bird species with a penis are paleognathes (tinamous and ratites),  Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans),  and a very few other species (including flamingoes [citation needed] and chickens ). A bird penis is different in structure from mammal penises, being an erectile expansion of the cloacal wall and being erected by lymph, not blood.  It is usually partially feathered and in some species features spines and brush-like filaments, and in flaccid state curls up inside the cloaca. The Argentine Blue-bill has the largest penis in relation to body size of all vertebrates; while usually about half the body size (20 cm), a specimen with a penis 42.5 cm long is documented.  While most male birds have no external genitalia, male waterfowl (Anatidae) have a phallus. Most birds mate with the males balancing on top of the females and touching cloacas in a “cloacal kiss”; this makes forceful insemination very difficult. The phallus that male waterfowl have evolved everts out of their bodies (in a clockwise coil) and aids in inseminating females without their cooperation.  The male waterfowl evolution of a phallus to forcefully copulate with females has led to counteradaptations in females in the form of vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils. These structures make it harder for males to achieve intromission. The clockwise coils are significant because the male phallus everts out of their body in a counter-clockwise spiral; therefore, a clockwise vaginal structure would impede forceful copulation. Studies have shown that the longer a male’s phallus is, the more elaborate the vaginal structures were.

BirdsBeingDicks,23qzpt,hstarbird11,4,Mon May 5 04:42:07 2014 UTC,"I don't know what kind of bird you have, but that is anatomically impossible. The cloaca is on the ventral, or under/stomach, side of all birds. They have a uropygial gland, also known as the preen gland, on the top of their tails, but that's not used for mating. Male birds actually have to touch their cloacas to a females for the copulation to occur, and sometimes male birds cloacas turn inside out inside the females to efficiently deposit sperm.

This bird is mainly a permanent resident, but northern birds may move south during harsh weather. This species has rarely been observed in Europe. This species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturæ in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos. The Northern Mockingbird is renowned for its mimicking ability, as reflected by the meaning of its scientific name, 'many-tongued mimic.' The Northern Mockingbird has gray to brown upper feathers and a paler belly. Its wings have white patches which are visible in flight. Males and females look alike, though only males sing.

However, the fact the bunny was being held by them indicates something was wrong with it anyway.  Those suckers are fast, and if they could easily catch it, it was injured, sick, stressed/terrified, or overly socialized.  If it was hard to catch, they probably stressed it the hell out anyway; rabbits, especially the babies, can actually die of fright and stress."

BirdsBeingDicks,1zizwd,msktty89,-5,Fri Mar 7 10:33:00 2014 UTC,"I do believe I specified, unless treated quickly.  If you put pressure on it for five minutes, sure.  If a bird gets lightly scratched and you treat the wound, sure.  Either way, any wound that is penetrating the skin is going to open up risk of infections, blood loss, etc. depending on how deep it is.  My point was more, yes the cat could kill the bird, but it's also possible the bird could do serious damage to the cat."
BirdsBeingDicks,1zizwd,msktty89,9,Fri Mar 7 12:38:35 2014 UTC,"which could lead to bleeding out   A cat isn't going to bleed out from an interaction with a parrot. I had a friend growing up that had his lower lip most of the way bitten off by his macaw. He got it stitched back on, yeah, but his life wasn't at risk from the wound.  Even the biggest parrots aren't mean-tempered enough to take on a cat and reliably kill it. Seriously injure? Absolutely, but your comment indicates a parrot biting a cat's ear is going to cause the cat to bleed to death. That's not the case.  In my experience, in fights between cats and household parrots, usually the cat figures out messing with the parrot is a bad idea, and the parrot figures out that the cat is an easy victim.  Even so, I'd be more worried about the bird than the cat, as birds don't get over emotional trauma nearly as fast as a cat. If there's anything that's reasonable to be worried about, it's not either the cat or the bird dying, it's the bird becoming hostile and traumatized due to interactions with the cat."

And because of a cat's grooming habits, this bacteria is often found in their fur and claws as well. Even the parrot biting the cat can cause the bird to get sick and die. It's never a good idea to allow parrots and felines to interact. Even supervised. Also why you should never let your bird eat out of your mouth. All mammals carry gram negative bacteria, and birds just aren't equipped to deal with it."

Second article was pointless, I don't disagree we all have dirty mouths.  Third article:   Your veterinarian will be able to assess the damage and get your bird on an antibiotic to fight infection.   Fourth article:   However, in order to cause that situation, the cat must first bite or scratch the parrot, and that can be trained against in most cats.   What I've actually gathered is that a scratch or bite can harm a bird, but often it's either that the scratch or bite itself is too deep/fatal, or they get an infection that can lead to death if not noticed and treated.  This goes for anyone getting bit by anything, really.  If you have a bird in good health that casually gets along with a dog or cat, it's not going to die from touching them.  Would love some better sources.  Saying something is capable of happening is useless."

BirdsBeingDicks,1whi72,FeatherMaster,8,Wed Jan 29 22:25:08 2014 UTC,"Probably, but it varies state by sate.  Wild animals are usually best wild, but if you really want to have one, I'd become a rehabber (just so you can learn what it really entails to care for one, if nothing else), get any licenses, and wait for a crow that can have a strong quality of life but can't be released into the wild, and see if you can make him a ""permanent patient.""  Just remember they're wicked smart, so it'll be like having a 4 year old all the time.  I'm normally really against wild animals being pets, but if it's a quality, happy life as a pet or being put down because they're unreleasable, hell, pet it is."
BirdsBeingDicks,1whi72,LittleBugWoman,2,Wed Jan 29 23:47:33 2014 UTC,"In the US, corvids are protected in the same way as all other songbirds are. So, you can't really just have one as a pet (bummer). I believe there is an African species (and possibly others) that are legal to own, but wild American crows and ravens are a no-no. But you can totally befriend wild ones ;)   There was a really awesome AMA a day or so by unidan and some colleagues and one of them does a lot of research on crows. I'm on a phone, so linking to the thread is a giant pain, but if you search the sub I'm sure it'll show up fairly easily."
BirdsBeingDicks,1whi72,FeatherMaster,1 point,Wed Jan 29 23:52:56 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure. I've known people to have pets normally considered wildlife without a license, but I think they just found them and rescued them or something. Otherwise I bet you'd have to have a license."

Education bird = getting a rehabber license and holding onto a nonreleasable crow that still has a high quality of life  Breeder bird = buying a crow from a breeder   I volunteer at a wild bird rehabilitation center. Human imprinted crows can be extremely aggressive and mean. My advice is to get a crow that is not imprinted on humans.   Getting a crow that is not inprinted on humans = holding onto a WILD crow as an education bird or purchasing from a breeder that does not allow his corvids to imprint on humans.

BirdsBeingDicks,1whi72,ilawlfase,3,Thu Jan 30 03:34:23 2014 UTC,"That's how I started. I did some Googling and Google Maps'ing. Then I drove to the nearest bird rehab center and told them I was there to volunteer.   It's not very glamorous work. You're working with sick or injured birds after all. Some will die; some will be euthanized due to low quality of life. Takes a bit of getting used to.   I remember getting a Chuck-Will's-Widow in and thinking that was just about the neatest thing in the world. One day I walked in and he was missing. He died they said. Poor fellow didn't have anything wrong with him physically. I guess he had just given up on life; he was in because he refused to eat. He'd gained weight while there from being force fed, but some birds just give up and their bodies simply shut down.   There are upsides however. For one, it's rewarding to help other living beings. You also get to work closely with birds and get to show off all kinds of photos and experiences to friends, family, date, strangers, etc.   My favorite part though is befriending the permenant resident education birds though. You can become really attached to them, like you would with a human. At the rehab. center I volunteer at every week, there's a Barn Owl named Alex and a Pelican named Maggie that I very much enjoy being around. If I don't see them for an extended period of time, I miss them."

BirdsBeingDicks,1whi72,Fishtails,1 point,Fri Jan 31 03:13:27 2014 UTC,"Most birds think they're the same species as who they were raised by. An imprinted crow was one raised by humans and didn't spend enough time as a baby around other crows.   Being imprinted on another species causes them to act differently and really mess them up psychologically. Let me tell you of Wrenski, the imprinted Wren (small song bird). Wrenski would always sing the most beautiful song, but it was aimed towards humans. Other song birds in her cage, she would KILL. She killed a few other birds before it was figured out that Wrenski was a murderer and had to be kept in a seperate. So she was given her own little cage from which she could serenade humans. She simply wanted nothing to do with other birds."

BirdsBeingDicks,1vwmuv,jeegte12,5,Thu Jan 23 16:08:38 2014 UTC,I just subscribe to it and generally never read the title or subreddit before opening .gifs and pictures.    Ignoring re-posts; you can still 50% of the time see things coming from a mile away either because it's something you already saw 5 years ago or because you recognize the subjects as the type of person that wouldn't have made it into a .gif unless they receive karmic retribution for their foolishness.  The other 50% however makes it worth it.

You can see the striping from the corners of the eyes to the nose which are for blocking out the sun as they search for prey. Also the spots, most jaguars have brownish almost leopard like spots on the upper parts of their body, and solid black ones underneath. The animal in the pic on the mans shirt has solid black spots on it's face, that combined with its thinner facial structure, and it's sun blocking stripes indicate that it is indeed a cheetah."

So I got her off of my hand and she spent the rest of the time chasing my around the counter hoping I'd get close enough to do it again. So I put a towel on my arm so she couldn't bite and she ran right up it to try and get to my face. They're just assholes but I want one. Lol"

BirdsBeingDicks,1un4ru,BeerPowered,18,Wed Jan 8 02:30:45 2014 UTC,"We don't know what happened after this picture was taken. But as a cat owner I can tell you this: Nothing is worse than a pissed cat that's grabbed at its waist. Owls have very strong beaks and talons, but this cat is in a position (literally) that allows it to inflict serious damageto the bird (like slitting open its belly with its claws, that plumage doesn't offer much protection against that) while in flight, while the only thing the owl could do was tighten its grip (which likely pierced skin).  If I had to make a bet, the odds were probably 80:20 in favor of the cat."
BirdsBeingDicks,1un4ru,datenwolf,18,Tue Jan 7 23:15:13 2014 UTC,"Having lost two cats to a barn owl, I'd take that bet."
BirdsBeingDicks,1un4ru,Boba-Jef,3,Wed Jan 8 03:00:27 2014 UTC,I thought a grown cat would be too big for an owl.
BirdsBeingDicks,1un4ru,theforkofjustice,2,Wed Jan 8 07:03:40 2014 UTC,"The Barn Owl measures about 25–50 cm (9.8–20 in) in overall length, with a wingspan of some 75–110 cm (30–43 in).   With some species having nearly 4' wingspans, I can see this happening."
BirdsBeingDicks,1un4ru,Liquid_Senjutsu,4,Wed Jan 8 08:04:13 2014 UTC,"Ever seen a set of owl talons? I'll take that bet. Although what probably would happen is the cat would flip around and start swatting, and the owl would drop it, after which the cat would take off, bleeding."
BirdsBeingDicks,1un4ru,datenwolf,1 point,Wed Jan 8 06:42:57 2014 UTC,"Ever seen a set of owl talons?   Yes, I have. Fuckers are sharp and powerful. But to do serious damage the grip has to be applied at the right spot. And this owl didn't manage to do that.  In addition to that talons are not ""knives"" (like a cat's claws), they inflict puncture wounds."
BirdsBeingDicks,1un4ru,BeerPowered,4,Wed Jan 8 10:09:25 2014 UTC,"I doubt it. Feathers are like armor, and little cat claws would have troubles beating them. The owl would drop the cat and then maybe pick it up again, or tear it apart."

BirdsBeingDicks,1un4ru,marishtar,3,Wed Jan 8 01:50:48 2014 UTC,So... 4:1.
BirdsBeingDicks,1un4ru,honda27,1 point,Wed Jan 8 10:04:36 2014 UTC,I'm thinkin' the owl already let go at the time of the picture. You can see the left talon for sure is empty and well above the cat. I can't see the right one but it looks like it's probably up around that area as well. I think the flash from the camera spooked the owl (or floodlight can't really tell).
BirdsBeingDicks,1un4ru,crackrox69,1 point,Tue Jan 7 23:40:07 2014 UTC,No doubt the owl is an ambitious mother fucker

BirdsBeingDicks,1un4ru,Splatterh0use,1 point,Wed Jan 8 10:10:23 2014 UTC,The owl might have dropped the cat from an altitude high enough to injure the cat. Then the bird proceeded to eat it.

BirdsBeingDicks,1un4ru,kabukistar,2,Wed Jan 8 00:46:12 2014 UTC,I don't think you have to hate cats to support keeping feral cat populations in check with catch-and-fix programs.  That's not what's surprising.  It's how many people who want to see cats get hurt or killed.

No ""community"" this size, or a tenth of this size, retains a coherent set of opinions or identity.  It's full of a great number of people with a huge diversity of opinions.  When people see certain emergent trends of opinion in a given time and place, they assume that it's the ""hivemind"" making its opinion felt.  At the same time, in other places, other people will attribute opposite opinions to the same hivemind.  And then, when the same person sees it acting in contradictory ways, it just proves that the hivemind is a hypocrite, which is easier than tearing down the idea of the hivemind in the first place, and building a more nuanced mental picture."

BirdsBeingDicks,1tmjup,SovietSteve,9,Wed Dec 25 08:56:41 2013 UTC,"Macaw person here. I promise there's much more to it, although the poop part is a total annoyance for me. Not gonna lie. I despise the poop part. They're very intelligent, though, and when they're treated as part of the family and are accorded a place in family socialization, they can be quite fun and great companions. Also, as this subreddit's name implies, they can be dicks when they're good and ready. There's a fair amount of dickishness in the bird world.   With the larger birds, it's nearly a life-long commitment because of their relatively long life span. Vet emergencies for any bird may not be cheap regardless of size. One instance of egg-binding (something akin to a breech birth in humans), for example, can easily run into a couple of grand literally overnight, and the bird still may not survive. Their routine care isn't all that cheap either, and the owner has to take into account hazards in the home which pose no threat to the human, but that can adversely affect the bird's health.   When the bird is a rescue, you're inheriting problems of unknown type. Mine came to me terrified of brooms, and because he had been relegated to the previous owner's bedroom and not part of their family life, he came with screeching and socialization issues. His cage had been too small for him to even spread his wings, and he was with me for two years before I saw him spread them all the way out. He has a cage here too, but it's the correct size for a macaw, the door is always open, and going inside is his option. He has his own room, and a couple of other play stands from which to choose, but he's often with me in other parts of the house.    In short, they're a serious commitment, but for me it has been worth it. My macaw is my family, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Twenty years ago, I wouldn't have thought this possible. I had no idea about birds, but he has changed my life completely and for the better.   Sorry for the long reply. I could write a book just about my own bird. lol"

I'll see if I can find a link I posted a while ago that explains it.   Here is the article worth a read.   Relevant portion:  Mr. T. Toms, of Richmond Station, Lake Tekapo, says, “I have not examined many sheep that have been killed by keas, but in the ones that I have examined I have always found the same result—the fat has been torn away and the kidneys left. Of course, the kidneys have been found mauled, but they were not sufficiently torn to give the impression that the kea had been eating them.  In three other accounts—namely, in those of Messrs. Donald Finlayson, H. E. Cameron, and C. W. Symonds—the fat was also eaten and the kidneys left exposed and untouched. Now, if the kidney itself was a special delicacy, as Dr. Wallace's book states, the keas, I think, would have eaten the kidneys as soon as they were exposed.  Mr. McKay, of Geraldine, had a kea which would not touch sheep's kidneys. He says, “I repeatedly tried him [the kea] with kidney - fat and the kidneys themselves, but he would scarcely deign to put his beak into them.”"

I'll put myself in the line of fire--or teeth--for just about any animal, except two: rabies vectors (so they're not put at risk), and birds with hooked beaks.  I've been chomped by equines, had a young buffalo try to eat my hand, and nearly lost the tip of a finger to a bit of the local wildlife I was tending to, and none of it hurt as much as when those hooked-beak birds got me.

They are still working on invoicing and collecting funds from the numerous outlets that used the video. So far newsflare has been very good to work with, I think they where caught a little off guard by how fast this thing took off.

BirdsBeingDicks,1o36yg,Gladius01,1 point,Thu Oct 10 04:33:28 2013 UTC,"Their hollow bones are surprisingly resilient to force. Instead of breaking on impact like a humans bones would, they can bend quite a good amount instead. Their hollow bones make birds tougher, not weaker!"
BirdsBeingDicks,1o36yg,Sekh765,1 point,Tue Oct 22 05:44:01 2013 UTC,"Does this factor help them fly against the push of strong winds? I always thought human bones were stronger and harder than birds', guess not."
BirdsBeingDicks,1o36yg,Gladius01,3,Tue Oct 22 13:04:59 2013 UTC,"Well, human bones are designed for a different type of work than birds. We're able to lift heavy objects and manipulate our environment better because our bones are so stiff, but still relatively strong. Birds bones are lighter to allow them to fly, but also very bendable, so direct impacts on them don't cause shattering as easily as on a human, relative to their size.  This is pretty important for hawks, which go diving into things really fast, that way they don't shatter their bones when they miss and hit the ground."

They'll dive bomb each other until the biggest one gets exclusive feeding rights. Then when he's full he'll go to a tree branch and rest and the lesser ones will sneak in a little feeding time only for mr. alpha asshole bird to swoop in and knock them out then go back to resting.  Then they get so full of themselves that they start swooping at the people sitting near the feeder.

BirdsBeingDicks,1lzyhc,Ketrel,2,Mon Sep 9 12:25:33 2013 UTC,"Correct. Such predators are not particularly opportunistic, and will stick to what they know. Humans wouldn't put up with being hunted for very long, so a taste for them never developed."

The fact that the birds in the picture are a different order than chickens, just as humans are a different order than cows, isn't a fact that provides much information about genetic similarity. Within any given class, there's a lot of difference in how related each order is. Off the top of my head, I'm pretty sure that the birds in the picture are a lot more closely related to chickens than we are to cows.  Also, humans are class Mammalia. Our order is Primates."

BirdsBeingDicks,1lecyh,bodycanvass9111,15,Fri Aug 30 15:12:51 2013 UTC,"It does.  Startling things make animals (even big scary ones) reactive rather than proactive.  If you can instantly make yourself bigger and louder than normal to force the animal into a choice between fight or flight, they'll usually choose flight (if they're sufficiently startled and not defending their offspring or nest).  Many animals can be scared off with loud yelling and charging as well as unzipping and spreading your jacket (makes you look bigger).  It's been proven to work against all sorts of animals (bears, lions, hyenas, etc)."

BirdsBeingDicks,1jhkgt,Ornithologist_MD,7,Thu Aug 1 21:45:23 2013 UTC,"My bird is very persistent. I also think it's hilarious, so I let him do it. Plus they don't actually understand that jumping in my food is bad and makes a huge mess, which is what he will do when he wants to try my food.  Positive reinforcement is how you train birds, so the only thing I can do to combat those scenarios is offer him food that is not on my plate and not react if he makes a mess. Birds can get agitated if you keep telling them no, like children. Sometimes distraction is the only option. However I don't actually care when he does this as mealtime is a great way to socialize with the bird and I fully expect this behavior.  Yeah birds can be dicks, but sometimes it's hilarious... like when my wife is trying to eat ice cream and he steals her spoon and flies away with it. I will never try to train him to not do that, because it makes me laugh every time."

I was in a hurry for a morning shift, and after uncovering him, talking to him, feeding (morning routine), he decided to fall to the ground and walk into my room. Unfortunately, he decided to walk behind the door, so I didn't see him in there and walk out from behind it into my path. I actually STEPPED on him, and if it wasn't for the fact that I have a tendency to step on the balls of my feet instead of the heel, he'd probably be dead instead of frightened and hurt.  He lost a bunch of feathers in one spot that day. I was pretty worried that I broke a wing or something for a small while. One of his wings is positioned a little different these days, and I don't know if it was always like that or new since that day. He isn't hurt though, and could use the wing the day after...That happened a couple months ago I think.   Maaaan. That would have been utterly horrible if I squashed him. I thought I stepped on a squeaky toy when it happened, and then  I realized that there were no squeaky toys in my room, ever."

They're so cute, walking around. I read that they like to scavenge for seeds or food on the ground, probably why they do it so often. Its just silly though, birds walking around on the ground.

Birdcage Missile: Can be fired behind an air craft being chased or as a ground to air interceptor.  On explosion scatters a cloud of debri capable of damaging an air craft's engine. The scattered debri would most likely be some kind of material that can maintain suspension momentarily but be dense enough to clog intakes.

BirdsBeingDicks,1hmx2l,FinnBot2000,52,Thu Jul 4 15:04:38 2013 UTC,"Bird rehabber here!  I work primarily with songbirds, but have owned and worked with parrots.  You're bird is probably bored.  Parrots require lots of stimulation, and copious amounts of attention.  Conures, in particular, are noisy birds, and will, like other parrots, scream even while playing.  Screaming isn't necessarily a sign of trouble, but it is a behavior you want to change.  First and foremost - check its surroundings.  Is the cage big enough?  Is it mentally stimulating enough?  Are there enough toys in the cage?  Can he get out occasionally for some moderate exercise?  These things are paramount to a happy parrot.  If that's satisfactory, stop and gain the bird's trust.  There's this bizarre blinking thing you can do with your eyes to convince them you're a friend, rather than foe.  This part takes time.   Enter the room quietly, slowly, and deliberately (and do so every time you enter the room from here on out) Sit down in front of the cage Get down to eye-level with the bird Look the bird dead in the eye Slowly close your eyes, keep them shut for 3 seconds, and slowly open them   Seems silly, but birds rely heavily on body cues.  Repeat that last part a few times, and it'll get it.  If it squawks while you're doing that, don't startle or abort, it'll only make it worse.  It may have been neglected or threatened by its prior owner, so this will remind him that you are not a threat.  Note: Make sure you do this first prior to any training you give the bird! This will help ensure your success.  Now, after it calms down, get above eye level with the guy.  Slowly and deliberately reach for its beak.  If it bites at you, firmly discourage it with a deep voice: ""No.""  Do not shout (this will make him continue to scream!), but don't be afraid to be stern.  After a few thousand attempts, and with any luck, you should be able to get close enough to grab its beak. If so, maintain a firm grip on the beak, and gently move his head backwards.  Repeat this beak grabbing business for a few days.  When you've gotten to the point where you can grab his beak without him snapping at you, you're ready for him to mount your arm.  From above eye level, and in a smooth and deliberate motion, thrust your arm just above his feet, and gently push him backwards.  He should step up.  If not, withdraw, and repeat.  If he bites, give him the stern ""No."", and try again.  It shouldn't take too long before he gets it.  After he mounts, do not let it get to eye level with you for awhile.  This means no shoulder sitting.  It has to understand that you are in control.  If you're successful here, you should have no problem playing with him, but that's another post altogether.  TL;DR:  Gain trust, establish dominance, arm mount, playtime.  Holy shit this post is long.  If you skipped right to here, I don't blame you, but I reckon there's some good advice up there.  EDIT:  Fuck, I almost forgot - treats.  Get lots of treats.  You need to reward it when the correct behavior comes out!  Using a ""baby voice"" of sorts (soothing, higher pitched than your discouragement), let it know: ""Good boy/girl/hermaphrodite/eunuch!"" and give it something it enjoys.  Finding the right treat can be a hassle, but generally fresh fruit and the like is good to have on hand.  It's going to take lots of time, and plenty of effort.  It will challenge your sanity.  But, it's necessary.  They are attention seeking, and need the interaction, but you should be able to get your interactions down to 15 minutes per day afterwards.  Best of luck!"

BirdsBeingDicks,1hmx2l,likebuttermilk,4,Thu Jul 4 20:27:47 2013 UTC,"I was going to make some suggestions, but you've covered everything nicely. The only thing I would ask in addition is...   Is this bird removed from the cage to be close to people and stretch its legs? From what I've gathered, it never leaves its cage? This would and does lead to many parrot breeds becoming mean, loud and psychotic. They need time out of the cage to socialize and play.  I own a black-headed caique and have plenty of experience with small - medium parrots."
BirdsBeingDicks,1hmx2l,fluffygryphon,3,Thu Jul 4 21:46:51 2013 UTC,"I touched on that briefly, but it's absolutely vital that they get out of the cage.  As you mentioned, they will learn bad behaviors and will go absolutely nuts, usually in a violent fashion.  Even if its wings are clipped, it still needs time out of the cage for exercise.  They don't enjoy being cooped up (pun intended)."

BirdsBeingDicks,1hmx2l,Aubrin,5,Thu Jul 4 18:58:03 2013 UTC,"I have a 4 month old green cheek conure, IIRC a blue crown is the same but just a color variation. Either way, it's probably mostly the same help.  They need stimulation so they don't act out. Does the bird have access to natural sunlight? Toys (both foraging and chewing) are also important, and need rotated out (or just rearranged) for novelty.  Being let out for play AND flock time help them bond with you. Play is when you have them run around, flock time is when you just cuddle. Keys are easy for play time, I've found. As for flock time, I wrap my hand around her and turn her upside down to hold her like a baby (so she's laying on top of her wings, against my palm, with my thumb over her chest) cradling her head with my other hand and stroking her as I sit down or walk slowly, cooing at her or talking softly. It took awhile for her to get used to, but now she lays serenely with her eyes closed making soft noises.  As for the yelling specifically, she may be begging to be let out/for attention. To help, maybe when you enter the room you should be holding a treat she can see, and if she shrieks, say 'No, bad bird,"" leave and take it with you. When she lets you enter the room and actually feed her without shrieking, give it to her. Should get her to learn that she gets attention by being well behaved. (However, the attention thing is going to be real. You should always address her when you enter the room and say hi at the very least, so she doesn't feel the need to beg for attention)"
BirdsBeingDicks,1hmx2l,TheOtherSarah,2,Fri Jul 5 00:08:52 2013 UTC,"I also have a conure that has some serious behavior problems. You just need to spend time with him until he trusts and likes you. Mostly just sitting with him and talking to him will achieve this in time. Just grab a book and read it by his cage and try to feed him more regularly. You will probably get bit a few times, suck it up.  Also, do you know what kind of conure it is? I know sun conures are known to be obnoxiously loud."
BirdsBeingDicks,1hmx2l,Swiftysmoon,1 point,Thu Jul 4 17:26:29 2013 UTC,"He's a blue crown conure. How would you suggest playing with him? I can give him treats just fine, but I'm not suppose to reward his bad behavior (screaming, which he will do if I'm in the room alone.) And I know it sounds like I'm being complicated, but I can't just sit in the room and chill while he's doing that >.< I have tried, but he will not settle down."
BirdsBeingDicks,1hmx2l,Swiftysmoon,3,Thu Jul 4 18:13:56 2013 UTC,"Yeah bites are going to happen, but all he's being taught is that biting will get him what he wants . I'd suggest armoring up and soldiering on. Leather gloves, teach him how to step up, reward not-biting and quiet time, and start from there. ""Good Bird"" and ""Bad Bird"" do have some effect if said properly and at the right times.  Training a bird isn't all that different from training a dog. They respond better to rewards than to punishments."

BirdsBeingDicks,1hmx2l,TheKyros,2,Fri Jul 5 03:13:27 2013 UTC,"This site has a ton of information. In all likelihood the bahavioral issue is being caused by the way you naturally react with the parrot. They aren't like a dog or cat, they are intelligent and self-serving, and they take a LOT of work. Your mother likely understands this, but if you are hoping for piece and quiet while she's gone (at least to the extent that a parrot allows) then you're going to have to start putting some effort into the bird. Otherwise you'll just be making things worse for yourself. Do some research, learn how to interact with the parrot and you'll find a way to coexist. If you don't put the time in, it'll be your own fault that the bird drives you nuts. Take it from a fellow conure owner, and former bird rehabber that worked quite a bit with intelligent species such as crows and ravens.  edit: Just as an aside, this bird should be out of the cage as much as possible, and needs around four hours of direct bonding time with it's flock members (you and your mom). He also needs a well balanced diet (a pellet base such as zupreem, roudybush, or harrisons are the best nutritionally), and fresh fruits and veggies every day. You'll want to make sure they are safe for your bird to eat. Also, a lot of the trust issues can be resolved with regular interaction. Clicker and touch training are an excellent way to get started without making physical contact with the bird, and there is a lot of good info out there to get you started."

BirdsBeingDicks,1hafps,fragglet,2,Sun Jun 30 13:34:45 2013 UTC,"Okay, but I think you're missing the more important point here, which is that we need to be more specific about what we're properly debating. Do you think that the fact that it's a picture of a duck makes a difference in this case? For example, if instead of a duck it was a flamingo, then I'd agree with you wholeheartedly. With their bright pink appearance, flamingos have an inherent comical element, which ironically makes them a far more obvious target and tired trope.  While I'd agree that ducks also have a somewhat comical element to them (as evidenced by the multitude of ""funny duck"" pictures that can be found on the Internet, and the fact that the word ""duck"" rhymes with a popular English curse word), I find that it's the banal commonness of those members of the Anatidae family of animals that makes them the kind of target that can be reused again and again for comic effect.  For an example from popular culture we need look no further than the historical rivalry between the Walt Disney Company and Warner Bros., characterized and anthropomorphized in the characters of Donald Duck and Daffy Duck. I want to make clear that I am not trying to equivocate the two characters, which are products of different eras within the history of cartoons and cinema (Donald being a ""funny animal"" character, while Daffy is a ""screwball"" character), the point to recognize is that both companies recognized the comic appeal of ducks in a commercial sense, which is why both went to the trouble of creating their own duck characters to exploit this appeal.  While Daffy and Donald have certainly declined in popularity since the golden age of animation when they first appeared, Donald's legacy as a comic character has continued in the various spin-off characters that Disney has created. The earliest examples were Donald's nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and more recently there are the popular TV series: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Quack Pack and Mighty Ducks. For decades, Disney has continued to provide a constant stream of cartoon ducks to satisfy our seemingly insatiable collective demand.  What this demonstrates is the ongoing and persistent commercial and comic appeal, over decades, of cartoon ducks. To return to my earlier comments, I believe it is the banal commonness of the Anatidae family that facilitates this. The idea that a simple animal that we see every day could be transformed into a sailor, adventurer, superhero or millionaire is one that holds a classic and ultimately timeless appeal.   The same applies in this subreddit: there is a timeless, ineffable quality to the idea that we can anthropomorphize a simple duck as being a ""dick"" that would gladly murder one of its own children without skipping a heartbeat. It's the kind of comedy that can be enjoyed by all and which, just like a classic Disney film, can be enjoyed over and over for years without losing its inherent comic appeal. In summary, I find your comments to be misplaced and naive, and you should study the history of cinema and popular culture before dismissing this picture as a simple repost without any inherent merit."

They would gang up in a group of 10 or more birds and chase away foxes, cats, dogs, and anything colored red. Don't ask me why, but they fucking hated red cars. It got to the point where if someone was visiting and they had a red car, we would tell them to park at the end of the driveway and walk.   These guys are definitely dicks."

Instead, both male and female birds have a cloaca – one opening (also called the vent) that serves as the bodily exit for their digestive, urinary and reproductive systems. This means that the same opening that excretes feces and urine is where eggs are laid. During the breeding season, the cloaca swells and protrudes slightly outside the body, while during the rest of the year it is much less prominent   http://birding.about.com/od/Reproduction/a/How-Birds-Mate.htm"

BirdsBeingDicks,1dvffg,Cikedo,19,Tue May 7 18:57:20 2013 UTC,"I grew up with a VERY overprotective mother who made sure I was terrified of everything in life.  Very early in life while at a park she told me about how geese can basically use a ""super wing attack"" and more or less break bones.  I was 12 years old when sure enough, walking home around a lake (just imagine a subdivision with a sidewalk leading around the lake) I must have walked past a nest because a goose started chasing me.  All that popped in my head was ""if this goose hits me from behind with it's wing attack, it'll break my leg, then proceed to kill me because I can't run away"". I was a pretty big kid for my age, I just full on tackled the goose. I mounted it's back so it couldn't move, then held it's head/neck/beak so it couldn't bite me.  I then proceeded to bawl my eyes out for what seemed like 30 minutes because I didn't want to kill it, but if I got up I ""knew"" it was going to kill me.One of my neighbors mom's saw me after a while, mounting a goose just sobbing hysterically. All I remember is her asking me if I was okay and me sobbing something back like ""IF I GEDDUP IT WILL KILL ME BUT I DON WANNA KILL ITHELPMEPLEASE! (Enormous sob/Still bawling)""."

BirdsBeingDicks,1dvffg,spcjns,10,Tue May 7 20:43:48 2013 UTC,You are lucky you only escaped with that. Geese have been known to remove fingers and testicles. And their wings can break arms under proper conditions.  Hopefully this helps you. Just imagine the fleeing goose is what they all deserve.
BirdsBeingDicks,1dvffg,GeminiK,7,Tue May 7 20:35:52 2013 UTC,Geese...such massive assholes that they are assholes to other geese.

BirdsBeingDicks,1dvffg,GeminiK,4,Tue May 7 21:50:33 2013 UTC,"Their wings are remarkably strong, when used to attack as they often do, the impact can break the forearm. They could probably break hands and feet too, but... you don't block strikes with your hands or feet, you do so with your arms."
BirdsBeingDicks,1dvffg,wildsportsbets,1 point,Tue May 7 23:07:54 2013 UTC,Ya... I'm gonna call bullshit on that one. There's no fucking way a goose wing can break someone's arm.

This is to avoid frequent reposts of this nature.   3) Reposting is pretty okay if it hasn't been posted to the subreddit you want to post it to in the last 1-3 months depending on the size.

BirdsBeingDicks,1d7ts7,whoadave,14,Sun Apr 28 03:12:28 2013 UTC,Whoa Dave! I don't believe I can fault that logic.
BirdsBeingDicks,1d7ts7,Brian_McGee,4,Sun Apr 28 09:11:19 2013 UTC,No birds are birds and reptiles are reptiles. It doesn't matter if your origin was the same because by your logic everything on land is a fish. The definitions breaking down of the animal kingdom down to species is very specific for a reason. They are separate for a reason. You can't ergo them together.
BirdsBeingDicks,1d7ts7,healcannon,7,Sun Apr 28 03:37:52 2013 UTC,It was meant to be tongue-in-cheek.
BirdsBeingDicks,1d7ts7,whoadave,3,Sun Apr 28 03:40:08 2013 UTC,"because by your logic everything on land is a fish   Not quite. This guy wants to reverse-engineer a dinosaur from a chicken. I don't think anyone would ever dream of reverse-engineering a fish from a human, so it's not nearly as much of a stretch as you suggest.   Also, I wasn't at all serious when I said birds were reptiles, but after your response I got curious and found this on Wikipedia:   Although they have scutes on their feet and lay eggs, birds have historically been excluded from the reptiles, in part because they are warm-blooded. ... However, as some reptiles are more closely related to birds than they are to other reptiles — crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards — cladistic writers who prefer a more unified (monophyletic) grouping usually also include the birds, which include over 10,000 species. (See Sauropsida.)"

Once my bird flew out the front door as my cat was walking in he saw it and jumped up and caught it in mid air.

When ever we let the rabbits out the dog would ingore them until we decided to try and catch them. Then my dog would go up to one and put a paw on it so it froze in the ""I'm dead don't eat me"" kinda fashion and we just picked them up and put them in their hutch.  Never trained the dog to do that. Awesome dog, still miss him."

That is probably the most important rule when facing down a goose (or any number of them, they like to fight in packs.) Also another important strategy is to spread your lats out, this will intimidate them. If the challenge is accepted the goose will spread its wings out as a sign to commence battle. The best way to start off the fight is to run straight at it and flap your arms while still spreading your lats (hard to do, but easily accomplished with a few weeks training.) The goose will either be scared off at this point, or ready to take you on. If the latter is true, prepare for a long fight because once a goose decided to attack, he's in it to win it."

That is probably the most important rule when facing down a goose (or any number of them, they like to fight in packs.)  Also another important strategy is to spread your lats out, this will intimidate them. If the challenge is accepted the goose will spread its wings out as a sign to commence battle.   The best way to start off the fight is to run straight at it and flap your arms while still spreading your lats (hard to do, but easily accomplished with a few weeks training.) The goose will either be scared off at this point, or ready to take you on. If the latter is true, prepare for a long fight because once a goose decided to attack, he's in it to win it."

Canada geese are fair game.    I love killing them.  I also love cutting their breasts open, and pulling out the delicious meat.  Then marinating it in red wine overnight, then cooking it on the grill.    Mmm....  Edit:  You have to kill them while they are in the air during hunting season.  That's the rule.  You cannot just walk up and grab one by the neck and throw it in the back of the truck.  Fairness and all, I guess."

BirdsBeingDicks,1bkl8o,craylash,6,Thu Apr 4 20:01:40 2013 UTC,I can't help but think the Eagle tramples it's eggs while curbstomping that Hawk
BirdsBeingDicks,1bkl8o,smartzie,6,Wed Apr 3 08:19:23 2013 UTC,Healthy eggs are pretty sturdy. One of the reasons the pesticide DDT was banned a few decades ago was because it was making birds' eggshells weak and they really were crushing them beneath their weight.   BIRD FACTS! :)
BirdsBeingDicks,1bkl8o,Deus_Imperator,6,Wed Apr 3 13:26:14 2013 UTC,"Actually they thought that for a while but its been pretty thoroughly discredited.  http://dwb.unl.edu/Teacher/NSF/C06/C06Links/www.altgreen.com.au/Chemicals/ddt.html   Additionally, the evidence regarding the effect of DDT on eggshell thinning among wild birds is contradictory at best. The environmentalist literature claims that the birds threatened directly by the insecticide were laying eggs with thin shells. These shells, say the environmentalists, would eventually become so fragile that the eggs would break, causing a decline in bird populations, particularly among raptors (birds of prey).  In 1968 two researchers, Drs. Joseph J. Hickey and Daniel W. Anderson, reported that high concentrations of DDT were found in the eggs of wild raptor populations. The two concluded that increased eggshell fragility in peregrine falcons, bald eagles, and ospreys was due to DDT exposure.9 Dr. Joel Bitman and associates at the U.S. Department of Agriculture likewise determined that Japanese quail fed DDT produced eggs with thinner shells and lower calcium content.10  In actuality, however, declines in bird populations either had occurred before DDT was present or had occured years after DDT’s use. A comparison of the annual Audubon Christmas Bird Counts between 1941 (pre-DDT) and 1960 (after DDT’s use had waned) reveals that at least 26 different kinds of birds became more numerous during those decades, the period of greatest DDT usage. The Audubon counts document an overall increase in birds seen per observer from 1941 to 1960, and statistical analyses of the Audubon data confirm the perceived increases. For example, only 197 bald eagles were documented in 194111; the number had increased to 891 in 1960.12  At Hawk Mountain, Pennsylvania, teams of ornithologists made daily counts of migrating raptors for over 40 years. The counts—published annually by the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary Association—reveal great increases in most kinds of hawks during the DDT years. The osprey counts increased as follows: in 1946, 191; in 1956, 288; in 1967, 457; and in 1972, 630.13 In 1942 Dr. Joseph Hickey—who in 1968 would blame DDT for bird population decline—reported that 70 per-cent of the eastern osprey population had been killed by pole traps around fish hatcheries.14 That same year, before DDT came into use, Hickey noted a decline in the population of peregrine falcons.15"

(Plus, I did a search, and it's been posted.)  True story: years ago, I was watching our cat play in the garden, chasing birds and stuff. She eventually got a sparrow or some tiny bird like that, and started beating it and throwing it around. I was inside, and the two minutes it would have taken me to get there would have been too long, so I figured there was nothing I could do, and kept watching. All of a sudden, she dropped the bird and disappeared.  Two seconds later, a crow came down, picked up the sparrow and flew away. And this cat was no pushover either -- one time, I found her enjoying a rat about 3/4 her size."
