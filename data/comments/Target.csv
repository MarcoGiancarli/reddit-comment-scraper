Target,3e583s,Smokeeye123,4,Wed Jul 22 01:29:29 2015 UTC,"I feel you have 100%. My store is considered a ""low volume"" store and gets a lot of local and out of the country tourists. We have daily goals of 15 or so now to help us with the YTD and it just isn't feasible. We aren't allowed to let the international tourists get Red cards (according to our STL) and most of the other people coming through the store already have one or have their mind set on not having one. We're lucky if we get 1 card by noon.  Not to mention that the TL on the front end are pushing everyone (including flow and backroom) to make sure EVERY guest  encountered gets the low-down on the redcard. They're pushing cashiers to get a no 3 times before we give up on pushing it.  I'm all for driving loyalty and sales as much as the next guy, but I feel like we're more of an annoyance than a friendly and helpful guide at that point. I don't think pushing the redcard so hard is achieving the ""vibe"" that the Target brand strives for. Heck, one of our dedicated TL's was booted because they weren't meeting redcard quotas (from a purely speculative position anyway).  I even had a talk with my STL about how the whole atmosphere of the store and team has changed due to the extreme push for getting Redcards out the door. He basically said he can't do anything about it and we just have to deal.  TL;DR: Redcards are hard for low traffic stores and I might care  about my lowly retail job a bit too much."

Target,3e583s,khaelian,2,Wed Jul 22 04:51:42 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that is ten a day and not per week. I myself get one to five red cards each shift.  My store manager loves me.
Target,3e583s,Mookya,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:09:22 2015 UTC,10 per day or week??...our weekly goal was bumped from 76 per week to like 95... it's some bullshit
Target,3e583s,blazenx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:08:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's all about how to drive your team and the fine line between hounding the cashiers and encouraging them. Recognition goes a long way. I'm at a low volume but pretty busy store where our weekly goal is 67 (being upped to 87 in August). We set daily goal at 12-15 and then 20 on Sat/Sun. Most weeks we finish about 10 over goal after online/mail ins, last week we had 96/67 apps. We're about +200 YTD. I think one of the blessings for my store is the fact that there is only one other Target in the area, then no Targets for about 100 miles in any direction.  On another note... it depends on your store of course, but I always think it's a bit funny when people say ""everyone already has one."" At my store, our redcard sales are just at 16% and that's up from 12-13% at the end of 2014."

Target,3e583s,spearmintnickers,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:07:45 2015 UTC,"My GSTL is pretty laid back about it, but she does make sure we know it's important. That's the right approach in my opinion - I will admit I don't usually ask on guests that are either in a hurry, or have less than ~$20 worth of items, but I do understand that the pressure is put on her by our ETL, who has pressure on him from our STL, etc. etc. etc.  My ETL is very persistent, it's almost impossible to have a conversation with him without him mentioning the cards at some point, but he also makes sure we have the tips needed to push it right. Biggest thing IMO is making sure it doesn't sound like a big deal if they say no, so they don't feel annoyed/pressured. Even knowing that, and using a year of variations with the speech, I still struggle to get even 1 card per shift, let alone 2 or 3 to help meet our goal (which we don't often meet anyways as far as I know)...it's ridiculous."
Target,3e583s,FrozenPhoenix95,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:09:17 2015 UTC,At my store we're required one red card per 100 transactions. Thats what my gstl said but I hadnt heard of that until I had a bad week once and was coached. Now I always check the weekly reports as motivation / goals.

"" If I asked a teacher or former boss about your strengths what would they be? ""  Then you'll be asked situation behavior questions. ""Tell me about a time you were interrupted while working on a task."" ""Tell me about a time you didn't get along with someone from your team."" ""Tell me about a time you changed a negative situation around using your attitude."" ""Tell me about a time you had to ask a supervisor or someone more experienced for help.""  These are for the first interview. It's okay to ask for a minute or two to think. It's also perfectly okay to ask to repeat the question. Make sure you answer all the questions and that you give enough detail."

Target,3e1doi,vPikajew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:50:59 2015 UTC,As a former Log leader; it takes nothing short of an act of god to get someone for performance after their 90 days. Maybe that's a bit dramatic but Target's coaching policy is so lenient that someone literally has to continuously screw up terribly regularly. What's worse is that a lot of people know how to play the game and play it so they can screw up enough just to not get fired.   When I was with the company (I left about three months ago after almost ten years) I was always frustrated that problem performers seem so protected.
Target,3e1doi,Joeyguacamole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:44:17 2015 UTC,"It sounds like accountability was an opportunity at your store, because this is definitely not the case company-wide.

Target,3e145i,radio_dead,3,Tue Jul 21 03:47:57 2015 UTC,"An open backroom like that would be a nightmare. That might be something the ETL-LOG needs to address. The stores I have worked at, it is driven in that the backroom team members do any pulls, and only when you absolutely cannot get anyone AND you have been trained to do so accurately, can you pull on your own.   Especially from an AP perspective, that would be something I would drive to change, if I worked at a store that did that."

It's simply where you pull up all the empty locations for an aisle and correct any that  actually have items in it. It could definitely help you narrow down problem areas.  Truthfully, there's a dozen or so things that a backroom can be bad at (ours is super bad at distinguishing between 'flavors' or things that could have different DPCIs) and until you know exactly where you're going wrong, it's going to be a monumental task to fix any particular aspect."

Target,3dr6xq,Diirez,3,Sat Jul 18 17:51:32 2015 UTC,"Typical morning in electronics for me is the following:  -Grab keys from GS.  -Grab electronics/entertainment reshop while at GS  -Grab the Ipads from the back and put them on the floor. (At our store we lock up the Ipads every night in the E/E. Probably not the same for every store.)  -Turn on any TVS that don't automatically turn on.  -Work on reshop  -Work on zone  -Get told by LOD to do toys zone/reshop  -Push CAFs from E/E  -Flex any outs in videogames  -Research outs if you have time  -Do more toys zone / reshop.  As for backroom stuff, are you talking about pulling items for guests? You can either go to channel two and ask backroom to pull it for you or do it yourself. I do it myself because it's faster and it lets backroom focus on their own work. If you need to pull an item just press the items name on the mydevice. It will show you were it's located in the backroom. Go there scan the barcode where the item is located and punch in the amount of that item you are taking. Other than that I don't do any other backroom jobs as an electronics team member."

Target,3dr6xq,BilllisCool,2,Sun Jul 19 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"I've just started working at target what is ""flex"" and ""research""?"
Target,3dr6xq,slimes123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:08:24 2015 UTC,"Flexing is when you move product to an empty location. For example, when new video games come out every week we generally sell out on the first day, leaving the location for that video game empty until we get more. Instead of leaving the location empty you want to take another video game that you have multiple of on the salesfloor or from the E/E and put it in the empty video games spot. When you do this you also need to create a generic price label for the item you are flexing. If you are lucky you can snag a hip printer and print the labels fairly easy. If your store is like mine and there is never enough equipment you'll have to print labels from the computer in the fixture room. Since you're new I would ask your team lead to walk you through making and printing labels. Once you learn the process it becomes second nature.  Research is when you scan an empty product location to let the system know your store is out of that product and you need more as soon as possible. When you do this you want to be in research mode on your mydevice. Generally research is the responsibility of the instocks team, but they don't always have the time / personnel to scan the whole store. Again, I would ask your TL or the instocks TL to give you a quick rundown."

Target,3dqyxi,crownedstev,2,Sat Jul 18 16:40:44 2015 UTC,You're going to have to do the same two things every day. Zone and reshop. Zone: pushing all the products up to the edge of the shelf and making the aisles look nice. Reshop: going behind guest services to get your cart of items that need to be put back on shelf. Typically how I like to start my day is get my PDA and walkie and then grab whatever for a cart of reshop and then start my zone in whatever area I'm in. Then I just push around my reship cart and put anything I find that doesn't belong in that cart. The best advice I can give you is to make sure you reach as far back and grab as much as you can and push it forward. Especially at night so when an LOD comes over and checks your zone and guests have taken items off the shelf the LOD doesn't look at huge gaping holes and think you didn't zone.  And try to be as fast as you can. Don't rush but going to slow will get you booted to CAF pushing.
Target,3dqyxi,Diirez,2,Sat Jul 18 17:47:29 2015 UTC,Would you rather zone and do reshop than just push? Just asking cause I know everyone at my store hates reshop lol

We have a fair quantity policy, meaning no one - not even a regular guest with no intention of reselling, can buy an outrageous amount of a popular item.  But honestly - this is the same exact relationship Target has with its vendors. Target returns products to Nestle, Keebler, Peppridge Farms, ect, that don't perform well. We buy the product - it doesn't sell - the vendor takes it back. I don't see the difference between that scenario and your scenario. I don't understand the hate.

Target,3dfx81,Yield88,2,Thu Jul 16 03:00:54 2015 UTC,"The one I went to had hand scanners as well, but wouldn't recognize cartwheel. I had to have the team member void the transaction and go to a regular register. I think this was one of the first stores to have them, so maybe their system was different, or maybe there was an issue with that register. But, it's good to know it's working at some of the stores and is not something that was just overlooked."
Target,3dfx81,OhNoBees,3,Thu Jul 16 11:58:33 2015 UTC,My store is getting them as I type. I'm pretty skeptical about them since my store is on the border of a pretty ghetto area and we have a pretty bad theft issue. The STL said though that AP has been prepping for weeks for this including some new hires so one of them can be present in front of them at all times.  Other than that as long as they work fine it will be great for the store. We're in between a downtown area and a suburb so pretty much its either business people grabbing a few things on break or soccer moms buying a weeks worth of groceries. We don't even have express lanes so this should be a big help to keep the lines down.
Target,3dfx81,bchris24,2,Thu Jul 16 01:39:34 2015 UTC,"We're a very high theft store and as far as I know, they don't have an impact on theft. We have two sets of doors and the SCOs are on the opposite side of the store than electronics. There's plenty of other paths out of the store so if someone wants to push out, it's still going to happen.  From a sales floor standpoint, it could possibly reduce the amount of fast service calls IF your front end is effective at fast weaving. Some days, I have to respond like once or twice but sometimes I'm up there a lot more."
Target,3dfx81,Yield88,3,Thu Jul 16 03:07:02 2015 UTC,"The store I work at is getting them as well. And yes, they are going to stick some poor cashier over there to bother people about redcards."
Target,3dfx81,Skiff_Manchester,3,Thu Jul 16 02:40:26 2015 UTC,Our store will be getting them in august after our ridiculous home and small appliance remodel.  The store looks like crap right now with Bts and construction everywhere.
Target,3dfx81,chelley_ftw,3,Thu Jul 16 14:34:49 2015 UTC,As long as testing continues well Yes. current plan is all stores by EOY 2016
Target,3dfx81,AforAnarchist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"Funny, cause one of the reasons I hate shopping at Target is because there's no self-checkout or express lane. I hate standing in line waiting to buy a pack of gum or some floss.   From an AP standpoint, it terrifies me though. I would want someone watching those self-checkouts constantly, but knowing Target, they'd probably see that as an expendable role. One store in our district got self checkout and I've already read so many cases of people ""forgetting"" to scan a bunch of their items. Cashiers stop plenty of theft just by checking on BOB and LISA, watching out for ticket-switching, and so on."

Target,3dgqwp,kindnes,11,Thu Jul 16 03:34:34 2015 UTC,"Take time to talk to your Starbucks DM about what you are experiencing.  They can hold the store accountable for maintaining contractual obligations, like multiple staff and never closing down the area while its supposed to be open."
Target,3dgqwp,StlStitch,7,Thu Jul 16 03:47:31 2015 UTC,"Seriously this. Target is bound by a contract with Starbucks to have a certain amount of weekly hours dedicated to Starbucks. The lowest volume Target stores are also required to have at least 7 certified baristas on payroll at all times. The contract also specifically states anyone working behind the counter needs to be barista certified, sounds like the GSTLs are not. You Starbucks TL is probably not telling all this to the Starbucks DM in order to prevent Target from getting in trouble. PM me if you need more specifics."
Target,3dgqwp,AforAnarchist,3,Thu Jul 16 15:47:36 2015 UTC,"its always an issue of management. yeah mytime may not allot as much hours, but when we had really great management we rarely got back up calls.   a different etl and a few tl's later.. now the people who had been there for ages felt like you and left. so now we have a lot of c people. back up calls all day now."
Target,3dgqwp,monkeyman80,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:35:11 2015 UTC,I work at target (back room fml) and my SO is a shift lead at a Starbucks. She has told me that all of her employees that transferred from target Starbucks hated it. So my advice to you would be to transfer to a Starbucks store.
Target,3del3j,ItzMurderMurder,5,Wed Jul 15 17:42:09 2015 UTC,"The reason you're not getting any further than LOD's telling you they'll look into it is because truthfully you probably don't deserve it. Unfortunately, a big part of moving away from cashier is showing you're good at your job (which is primarily getting red cards). I've had a few co-workers that tried to move away from cashier get denied by the ETL-GE because they don't get red cards.  Also, you need to show initiative. If there are any shifts to pick up for the position you're interested in switching to, talk to your ETL-HR and see if you can pick it up for training. Don't call out, don't ask for shifts of your own to be picked up that are avoidable and not due to health issues, etc. It's all about showing you want to actually get the job you're training for because you want it, not just to get away from your current one. Make a name for yourself."
Target,3del3j,0xnoidea,3,Wed Jul 15 18:18:59 2015 UTC,"To go along with this, try and stay busy during your down time as a cashier. If it's slow, offer to knock out some carts of reshop. Zone up the checklanes and dollar spot. They probably won't just move you to the salesfloor unless they think you're fit for it. Always ask your GSTL or LOD if they need help with anything. Once they see that initiative, they'll be more likely to let you help out with salesfloor."
Target,3del3j,NECbelts,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:33:19 2015 UTC,"as a former cashier, get to know leadership. my stl thanked me a few times but she had no idea who i was when i wanted to move up.   my etl and tl's thought i did great and wanted me at guest service almost immediatly.  promotion took a lot longer because the others didn't know me."
Target,3del3j,monkeyman80,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:41:45 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point, and eye opening as well, but from what I'm told is they sometimes keep people as cashiers and don't ever promote or switch em out if they're very good with redcards, anyone know if this is true at all?"

Target,3ddztk,ferlessleedr,5,Wed Jul 15 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, as I posted this,  several orders began to drop. We hit our 50 fairly quickly.  We are in Indiana and most orders went out to places like CA, NY,and even LA. We had very few local orders filled. Was not expecting that.   Thanks for the replies!"
Target,3ddztk,slenderwin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:31:15 2015 UTC,"Yup - I commented below about this, but since they're still testing SFS they're really stress-testing it and having stores ship to far away locations predominantly."
Target,3ddztk,shelfmonkey,3,Wed Jul 15 21:53:24 2015 UTC,It can take a while for the orders to start dropping and if there are a lot of stores launching today there are always kinks to work out. There are definitely peak hours but typically they don't drop all at once. My store does 175 a day and we are dead in Ship from Store because Amazon and Wal Mart both have huge online promotions going on.
Target,3ddztk,Daddo5,2,Wed Jul 15 18:16:35 2015 UTC,Have someone you know order something
Target,3ddztk,slenderwin,2,Wed Jul 15 16:09:47 2015 UTC,Unfortunately that wouldn't work because the orders aren't necessarily local.
Target,3dgejl,Serejai,3,Thu Jul 16 01:47:32 2015 UTC,You are really going to have to call the corporate hotline if you are truly desperate and don't mind waiting a couple weeks.  Shipping between stores that distance requires several overrides.    Brickseek is not 100% accurate simply because it's relying on our internal systems which can be a crapshoot during the best of times...
Target,3dgejl,talan123,-3,Thu Jul 16 02:56:13 2015 UTC,"Do you have a phone number for this? The only one I see on the corporate Target website is 1.800.440.0680, which is the Store Experience number on Target.com and they just told me they can't help because they are part of Target.com and the item doesn't show up in their system anymore."

Target,3dgejl,vPikajew,2,Thu Jul 16 03:31:44 2015 UTC,"As weird as it sounds, yes target and target.com are 2 separate entities under the same corporation. You would need to call the corporate guest service hotline for the best chance at reaching someone to help you out"

Target,3d6s7a,anonymoose44,11,Mon Jul 13 23:36:54 2015 UTC,Sounds like theft to me. A group of people caught like that takes time get enough evidence to decide who all needs to be fired. And if GSA's are involved then I'm sure somebody from the district level would be brought in to deal with the situation along with the GE ETL and to see if any GSTL's were involved.
Target,3d6s7a,Skiff_Manchester,6,Tue Jul 14 00:23:06 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with this. Probably an internal. The ""corporate"" guy was probably an investigator. People steal. They get caught. And that is how Target handles things."
Target,3d6s7a,iJeffwuh,4,Tue Jul 14 08:20:42 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, and even if the Cart Attendant wasn't necessarily 'in' on the same rule-breaking behavior as the GSA's, they may have witnessed fire-able offenses (that they couldn't ignore) while investigating the GSA's and thus they fired all of them at once."
Target,3d6s7a,slenderwin,5,Tue Jul 14 00:34:02 2015 UTC,"All 3 of these people were guest service trained and had several guest service shifts a week. I think cart attendant was probably in on it. The weird part for me was that I cashier and guest service frequently and hadn't seen it happen making me think they were completing eachothers' transactions to get the reduced ""guest price challenge"" price"
Target,3d6s7a,LeChiotx,6,Tue Jul 14 02:57:51 2015 UTC,could also be they caught the Cart Attendant by accident. happened at my store. . they knew the people in starbucks we're stealing but also caught another employee they had no idea was doing something fireable ((no stealing but I think doing something with food o.o))
Target,3d6s7a,SortaFlyForAWhiteGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:06:34 2015 UTC,Can we take a moment to address whether or not we are obligated (both morally and by Target rules) to report employee theft if we see it? I have yet to see theft but would like to be able to cover my own butt if I am ever in a situation like the cart attendant may have been.
Target,3d6s7a,talan123,7,Tue Jul 14 02:06:31 2015 UTC,"Cover your ass. I know its awkward and I wouldn't want to create conflict personally, but they are strict if you don't report. When all this went down I told an ETL that a cashier had once reduced the price on an item I was buying without telling me. (Presumably in some misguided effort to be nice to me) When I realized she'd done this I returned and rebought the item at the correct price. The ETL told me it was good I'd reported it, because otherwise we could have both been fired. As is, she got a coaching and I had to fill out paperwork."
Target,3d6s7a,DeviantThe_corn,5,Tue Jul 14 03:04:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, by Target rules you are required to report any violations of the code of conduct by either reporting to either your superior or the corporate hotline."
Target,3d6s7a,bchris24,4,Tue Jul 14 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"I was told about one time where 3 team leads changed the price for a certain tv by 25% off or so, used only gift cards and cash to pay for it (rang each other up), and used their discount as well. They were only caught because they used their discounts and when AP watched the cameras, they saw them crowded around a computer when the price was adjusted and the register the leads were using."
Target,3d6fla,bopisalert,8,Mon Jul 13 22:01:04 2015 UTC,Sales floor is great. Its a good starting point to move to other positions as well. If you do well enough after like 2 months they will probably move you to Plano/Pfresh/Electronics which I believe all pay more.

Target,3d6fla,dubblechzburger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:30:34 2015 UTC,It probably depends on the store. Our PFresh people don't get harassed at all. And it's not even score-related because grocery is always average.
Target,3d6fla,SillySal,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:37:39 2015 UTC,"At my store, there is a culture of ""owning"" your department and flexing (don't know if that's an industry term, but here it means moving shit around to make the empty shelf look full) to fill everything in pfresh. It is easy at my store because you are not as responsible for other things like backup calls or running errands for the front lanes if you're working with cold items on the floor, BUT where it gets dodgy in my eyes is that depending on what time your store opens, you may have to come in at 4 or 6 am to unload the truck on a regular basis. That always shot a shutter through my loins."
Target,3d6fla,anonymoose44,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:22:17 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this. Selling redcards is disheartening and exhausting, if you do actually talk to all your guests about the credit/debit card, they often resent you. I think OP lucked out that front end wasn't hiring. I'm cross trained in hardlines, flow, and backroom. My favorite is flow, but the hours are not for night owls. Hardlines is a close second. If you are actually zoning/spot checking it can be hard sometimes to get the calfs done (this is just merch refill throughout the day). Pfresh is also frickin' awesome if you can swing that.

Target,3cxss1,oath2order,3,Sat Jul 11 20:19:27 2015 UTC,"At my store, policy is: you cannot have TL -Tm relationships if you work in the same area.  GSTL can't date cashier but can date salesfloors.  Softlines TL can't date salesfloors but can date guest services.   That kind of thing."

Target,3cxpcq,roysgame,3,Mon Jul 13 01:04:33 2015 UTC,"Cross training is a good way to get more hours, but only if your store actually has hours available. If your hours are dropping its possible the store has less payroll available, and no amount of extra training can help with that.  Keep an eye on the swap shift board. If there's a shift you'd be willing to take but aren't trained for, you can always ask about learning it.  In the end, its tough to get above 30 hours consistently. Usually reserved for leaders and specialist positions"
Target,3cxpcq,dmillerw,2,Sat Jul 11 20:24:13 2015 UTC,Clock in earlier and leave later.   Don't really do that but yeah see if you can cross train and pick up shifts. If they see you're picking up more shifts they may notice you wanting to work more and schedule more.

Target,3cuxas,Targetthrowaway17,2,Fri Jul 10 23:52:59 2015 UTC,"I think the most advantageous move would be to request an hour in the different work center. Offer to carry a walkie and respond to back ups. That should get you in the door for the area. The more people, like the execs, that see you over there, the better your integration. Buddy up to the team members that work there and offer to cover their area for their breaks.  If you outright ask to be transferred, your Etl will likely say no and use the reasoning that if you're not getting red cards, you're not performing in your current role. Therefore, until you meet the cashier standards, you won't meet other area standards. On the flip side, if you're too good at your current job, they won't want to move you.  I'd suck it up a bit longer and slowly inch your way to another area."
Target,3cuxas,heartminkie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:33:21 2015 UTC,"Alright, I figured as much. Better sooner than later, I'll talk to my ETL tomorrow about getting training or at least an hour or two over in electronics one of the upcoming days. Thank you!"

I belonged in electronics, however to get really good recognition and probability for training, as a cashier your red card score needs to be high. If you can get a lot of red cards at the front lanes, you'll easily get them in electronics, also get to know the etl in electronics and let them know that u are interested in being crosstrained. I mentioned that,  and they started having me cover breaks, learn how to do 4x4s,etc."
Target,3cuxas,NhvK,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:06:11 2015 UTC,"Also forgot to mention, they're going to expect you to get attachments in electronics a lot more than red cards. If you sell a TV,  you had better sell an HD I cable and a warranty with it. It's fun back there if you're good with tech, but believe me it can be a lot more stressful than the front lines.  You're a hot zone for theft and fraud. And when it's busy back there,  you are alone aside from target mobile.  Your cashering speed needs to be high, and you need to get good customer surveys as well.  2 cents added haha,  if you have any other questions about it pm me,  I transferred from electronics to guest services,  to gsa,  to tps,  etc.  I got tips!"
Target,3cuxas,spearmintnickers,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:09:43 2015 UTC,"2-3 months into working solely as a cashier I spoke up about my interests in other areas of the store, and luckily a position opened up to where I could transfer to that area as my main job title. Just tell your GSTL or ETL about your interest in being trained and it'll go from there.   (PS. I think every store has GSTL's and GSA's who are very lax on the front lanes and others that are very strict. :) )"

Target,3ctkez,WolfsMelancholy,5,Fri Jul 10 17:42:09 2015 UTC,"I work day side backroom.  You'll be pulling research, POGs, and the hourly CAFs (CAFs start at 11 am).  You'll also be backstocking, completing flex fulfillments, and helping TMs get items for guests from the back.  Additionally, if you're opening, you'll be doing the date audit.  You need to be quick and accurate to succeed in the backroom.  You also need to be able to lift heavy items.  Depending on the day, the backroom can be hell, or it can be pretty chill.  Busier days on the floor will mean bigger CAFs, which will test your speed to avoid them rolling over.  A slow day, you'll complete the CAFs in a 1/2 hour and be mindlessly backstocking for a half hour."

Say yes, and you get even get an extra 30 days to return it if you pay using a red card. Or if someone says they didn't find what they were looking for, tell them it might be online and you can even get free shipping if you use a red card. Try to make them feel like they want it."

Target,3cryyi,rc39,3,Fri Jul 10 08:06:19 2015 UTC,"A count of 1 is really as good as a 0. It more often our counts are off than 100% accurate, especially in electronics where theft and holds are very common and stock is constantly rotating.   The only reason that item came to be 70% off is because it's gone missing, or never existed. Most discounted electronics goes very quickly as ebay/amazon resellers pick it up as soon as they see it.   Items in the stock room are located in the system, and if they're not due to an error it's close to impossible to find it right then and there. If it's hidden, then its hidden from everybody, might as well be gone.   Items that are discontinued are put on endcaps or flexed into empty locations, back stocked temporarily and eventually sent back to the distribution centers."
Target,3cryyi,smurf2applestall,4,Fri Jul 10 21:03:33 2015 UTC,"Generally all clearance items are on back endcaps (not facing the main aisle)  Electronics usually has at least one clearance endcap, so I'd check there"
Target,3cryyi,dmillerw,2,Fri Jul 10 12:57:03 2015 UTC,"Like the other guy said, generally clearance endcaps in the back and if not electronics then maybe toys or others around it.   But just 1 is a sketchy number. Often times when doing price change (clearance) if they can't find an item that's due for a clearance, they'll activate the price just to make sure it's the right price if anyone does find it. So that 1 could have been missing 2 months ago when it was on first clearance for like 219.98."

Target,3cryyi,blazenx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"It's most likely a stock error.  There is a chance it got put on the wrong clearance endcap but that problem is usually resolved after a bit with zoning and the like.    As far as locations go, generally for most products once they go discontinued and clearance a revision comes in for that aisle and unties the product to its old home location.  From there it's supposed to be kept on a clearance endcap in that department or the next closest one if the current department has all endcaps being utilized."

There are some things I still know very little about like the expensive top of the line cameras. Just be honest and never make things up or lie. Read the box, ask someone, or google info for them. Learning what counts as attachments and what doesnt takes awhile as well as learning the general area and the layout of the entertainment section which can seem like a maze.  It can be hard and extremely draining at times and other times it can be laidback and awesome. There are days where I'm bored to death and spend time just superzoning books and days when there are 4 guests waiting at the counter and you have to manage all of them. Like steamwhistler said being able to juggle a bunch of different things at once is key.Some of the things I have to manage all at once are setting POG's, finishing revisions, doing pulls, helping guests, taking calls, and working on reshop and zoning. Some guests are awesome, and some guests will spend 90 minutes talking to you asking you to explaine everything in the entire department.  No. Since I do revisions I know most of all the dvds/games/cds/books we have but even if you dont you can just punch it into the PDA and it will tell you exactly where the item is for a guest. You'll become a pro about smartwatches, tvs, and tablets in no time and develop a good sales pitch for attachments.  That's another thing. Every electronic team members are expected to get one attechment per item which isnt as hard as it sounds. Need a tv? well you probably need an hdmi cable or surge protector too. Camera? If youd like to take pictures heres an SD card and let me throw in a case too. Also expect to be hounded for red cards too.   That being said Electronics is an enjoyable experience. From the outside it looks easy but it's actually a lot of work. Much much better than hardlines! No more zoning A and B at night and no responding for backup!"
Target,3cpq24,Smokeeye123,6,Fri Jul 10 00:18:23 2015 UTC,"I don't work for Target anymore, but I was an Electronics TM for 2 years.    First of all, you probably flat-out won't be able to get onto the Electronics team if there are no openings. The thing is, a lot of people want to work in Electronics, because they think it's easy and fun. (And some days, it can definitely be both of those things.) My suggestion would be to let them know you're interested in learning the role and eventually switching over. Offer to cover breaks whenever you can, and let the Electronics TMs know you'd be happy to cover shifts for them. Basically, you have to find your own ways to get your foot in the door. Just be enthusiastic and patient. Once you've demonstrated you're decent in the department, they'll probably schedule you in for some shifts during October - December. After that, with some seasonal people staying on to fill your Hardlines role etc., maybe you can get a permanent spot as an Electronics TM. I said above that sometimes Electronics is easy. The second part of that is: sometimes it definitely isn't. My store was always understaffed in Oct-Nov, and it could get pretty stressful being the one guy in that part of the store who knows what he's talking about. A guest wants to know which laptop is best. Someone's on the phone. That little girl wants a video game unlocked. Electronics, do we have any copies of We're the Millers on blu-ray? (Really?) How's that cart of reshop coming along? Probably the biggest challenge of Electronics is managing a lot of competing priorities effectively--and the TMs who are best at that are the ones they'll give the best hours to, and the ones who will get promoted. Knowledge: The short answer is no, you don't need extensive knowledge. My knowledge was pretty extensive, and I was notorious for it, and people respected it. But at the end of the day, like I said, the most important part of being an Electronics TM is getting the tasks done that LOD is asking for, while making sure that things in your department don't get too out of hand. However, definitely try to learn as much as you can about the electronics that you sell, and how they compare to competing products that you don't sell. Your guests will love you for being a good source of information, and for me, helping people make smart, informed choices was by far the most rewarding thing about the job.   Huh, didn't think I'd end up writing this much. Hope it helps. Good luck."
Target,3cpq24,steamwhistler,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:50:19 2015 UTC,"A lot has been answered really well here but just a quick recap no its not too difficult, especially if you know the TL of that area already. I switched from food ave and the only part of the process that wasn't painless was for food ave trying to find a replacement. You won't have to deal with that in hardlines I'd imagine.   It's really not that difficult. There's always things to do but it's really not bad. No back up cashiering is a big plus. You'll get to know what you should be focusing on and it'll vary from store to store. I've read on here that electronics people have to basically do toys and sporting good pulls. At my store we don't. They don't want us to so we can keep our high vibe scores up because we're constantly in front of the boat or walking our aisles.  As far as knowledge not really. Basic understanding helps. I came in as a gamer so I had video games locked down fine. TVs I kind of new but everything else you learn on the fly. I knew of megapixels and zoom when I first switched so cameras were rough at the start but now I can sell one very confidently to just about anyone except for people super knowledgeable asking about the DSLRs. Don't be afraid to read the boxes, or if your TL allows it, check Google on your phone. Can always use a tablet too. If you don't know most guests wont mind you looking it up to be sure rather than BSing and end up being wrong about it.  All in all I loved it and only switched out because a different TL wanted me for a spot that was Monday through Friday 8-430 consistently. It took weekends off to pry me away."

Target,3crher,turtleoftruth,2,Fri Jul 10 20:27:26 2015 UTC,"Some high volume stores have a brand attendant who cleans the bathrooms, spills, empties trash, etc. At my store the cart attendant does restroom checks.

Target,3cptzo,based193,2,Thu Jul 9 20:26:40 2015 UTC,Highly unlikely. Talk to your ETL or HR soon though. They may be able to give you a few days. Also highly dependent on your workcenter.

Target,3citj3,gettindemdownvotes,2,Wed Jul 8 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"I believe it varies from store to store, possibly district to district. At my first store, they weren't very much into  development of their team members and it annoyed me, probably a lot like it annoys you.

Target,3cgosf,gettindemdownvotes,7,Tue Jul 7 20:04:15 2015 UTC,One of our ETLs recently decided that we're not allowed to deny them anymore. All I can do is pray that they won't get in my line when I see them walking down the aisle...........
Target,3cgosf,khakionbottom,12,Tue Jul 7 19:56:59 2015 UTC,Give it some time. We were all about saying yes until our AP ETL started giving a fuck and we are allowed to deny now.
Target,3cgosf,RomulanBacon,8,Tue Jul 7 20:24:20 2015 UTC,I'm an analyst in the finance pyramid at Corporate... I'm pretty sure if you honor invalid coupons it ends up tying out as shortage on the books. Stores with high shortage will get their slap on the wrist from corporate and the ETLs will change their tune.
Target,3cgosf,t3norvox,5,Tue Jul 7 22:21:13 2015 UTC,Tell your complaint division I'm sorry about yesterday night. Guests were overheating. PS. Turn down air conditioning for all stores everywhere plz its 110 outside thank you.
Target,3cgosf,RomulanBacon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:16:19 2015 UTC,Invalid coupons do not counts towards an individual store's shortage.
Target,3cgosf,AforAnarchist,3,Wed Jul 8 14:00:48 2015 UTC,"This may be a dumb question, but when can you deny people? I've gotten pretty good at handling difficult guests and I can handle almost any other cashiering situation, but I'm so damn confused about coupons. Like today I had a woman buy some kind of shampoo for which she then gave me 2 coupons for each that took $5 off each shampoo bottle, essentially making the items free. She paid about 80 cents total. Is this allowed?"
Target,3cgosf,luminosity99,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"I know at our store it's two target and two manufacturer coupons per individual item, as long as they do not cover all or more than the total cost of the item."
Target,3cgosf,PigsWithSwords,5,Wed Jul 8 03:16:11 2015 UTC,"This... is actually contradicting Target's official coupon policy of one Target and One manufacturer coupon per item, with a max of four per transaction. As well as values being reduced if the item is less expensive.  How does the system even allow this at your store? It completely blocks any additional coupons from being scanned in once those limits are met."
Target,3cgosf,Isak922,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:02:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I'm confused. Maybe they really were priced over $5? But it seemed like they took the whole price off. It was odd. It went through the system fine though."
Target,3cgosf,luminosity99,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:02:08 2015 UTC,"I've only had it happen to me once with a coupon scammer. It was our old AP guy's policy over a year ago. I thought it was ridiculous myself, so I'm sure it has changed by now. Perhaps it was a misinterpretation of the ""official"" policy. shrug What do you mean by values being reduced? If the coupons had covered more than the item's price, one or two would not be accepted so that they did not cover the cost (or more than the cost) of the item. The coupon values are not adjusted.  I have never seen the system deny a valid coupon for being over a 4 coupon limit. I'm pretty sure that does not happen on our registers (unless this has been changed recently). I'm actually surprised that there is a 4 coupon limit, considering the fact the people make huge purchases, and cartwheel's existence."
Target,3cgosf,PigsWithSwords,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:14:35 2015 UTC,one each per item
Target,3cgosf,AforAnarchist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:01:26 2015 UTC,We've recently started telling them we have to limit multiple purchase of items to 4 so that all our guests have a chance to experience our products.
Target,3cgosf,NhvK,3,Wed Jul 8 05:47:11 2015 UTC,Not a couponer....but I had one guest try and purchase 52 packs of coke because we had a 4 for $10 sale. (Obvious reseller). I denied the sale and told him we could do 12 max. He wasnt too happy and was yelling at me and such. I explained to him we reserve the right to limit quantity purchases to keep things competitive for other guests. He wouldnt shut up and it got to the point where AP kicked him out. Twas a great day
Target,3cgosf,vPikajew,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:39:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the official policy too. Limit of 4 identical coupons per household per day."

Target,3cj4hm,ResidentAsylum,2,Wed Jul 8 10:30:39 2015 UTC,Our electronics registers have the option to do so as well. I think technically it is supposed to be guest services but depending on  your GSTL they may let electronics do it. It's usually quicker for me to pull out my phone and check it myself so they let us use our judgement. If it's a guy doing a big price match I'll send em over but if a guy is buying something that's normally 75 and it's on target.com for 65 they don't care if we do it.
Target,3cj4hm,dubblechzburger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:24:32 2015 UTC,Interesting...I will have to check and see if mine now have that option.

Target,3cij0n,Viper_Killer,4,Wed Jul 8 04:27:39 2015 UTC,"Theres a Polish lady with a very thick accent at my store. She askes every guest, unless they're obviously too young, to sign up, she mentions both debit and credit option. She pulls in at least 20 a week, and shes gotten like 50 or 60 in one week.  So I have come to the conclusion that you have to be a little cute blonde polish lady with a thick accent to get maximum redcards."
Target,3cij0n,myusernameistoolo,3,Wed Jul 8 20:19:19 2015 UTC,"I usually ask ""Are you saving 5% with a Redcard today?"" It's easy to slip in after the usual greeting and (imo) doesn't sound too pushy."
Target,3cij0n,khakionbottom,3,Wed Jul 8 05:08:53 2015 UTC,"My method is this:  ""Do you have a Target card?""  If they say yes, leave it alone. If they say no:  ""Are you interested? You save 5%""  If they say no, leave it alone. If they say yes, yay.  This method nets me 6/7 cards a week if I'm working 30+ hours. It got me 9 cards during 4th of July week. Sometimes due to attitude or misc. circumstances, I'll have a shitty week and get 3/4 instead. Regardless, I don't intend on changing my method because I don't care for going into year-long spiels as I'd lose my mind, and this works for me.  Also, sometimes when you mention the 5%, people will remember they signed up for one last year or something out of the blue, pull it out, swipe it, and it's expired. I jump on this opportunity like a cheetah to get them into signing up for a new one. Works almost every time.  If you ask me, your attitude, confidence, and overall mannerisms is what matters more than any spiel you can make up. If you seem uninterested, depressed, etc, it's off-putting, and when you ask a question like signing up for a credit card with bullshit interest, you want people to think it's the best thing since sliced bread."
Target,3cij0n,0xnoidea,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks I think this will help. Two more question  1.You said you are getting about 6 cards a week, how many does the store want you to be getting?  2. Is their an easy way to tell if the card is expired?"
Target,3cij0n,Cyan_Ottercat,3,Wed Jul 8 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"I'd always base my pitch off what they were purchasing at the time. Large purchase? 5% all the way. Missed purchase?

You interview with your DTL and a BP or two much like you would for any other promotion, except the scope of the questions is very high.

Once all the counts are incorrectly adjusted, it will mess with pricing's numbers/task list when it all goes salvage.  Honestly, it's one of the least important areas in the store in this respect, but unless your store has declared One Spot PTM, you should still put things where they go."

You have to change into dayside compliant clothing if you're on the floor past store open, but at least with us, you aren't restricted to red and khaki overnight. I think almost all stores allow shorts I overnights, because someone at headquarters had the bright idea to cut the AC at night (I feel like we were taught it was more expensive to re-cool than leave it on a slightly warmer temp in grade school?).  Music is also more dependent. Some stores play music through the PA system. Sometimes you can listen to music with headphones during flow, but not during unload or in the back room."
Target,3ccdw7,zieen,4,Mon Jul 6 21:11:31 2015 UTC,My store plays music through the pa system but it's usually Mexican music or country which I despise so I bring my phone at a low volume but it all depends on the store

Target,3ccdw7,howardtheduck126,3,Mon Jul 6 23:35:47 2015 UTC,"Overnight at my store requires a red shirt but khakis are up to you, shorts are allowed so long as they aren't jeans. As for music they don't play any so as long as the store is closed and the guests are gone you can either listen to music in headphones or even play it loud over your phone speakers. I've never seen anyone get told not to unless it was so loud it was impeding others or yourself from hearing your walkie. So really you might just have to ask one of your coworkers or a team lead if you get hired since it depends on stores."
Target,3ccdw7,bchris24,2,Mon Jul 6 23:51:38 2015 UTC,just put it on low or one earbud so you can hear your TL.  You don't want them having to repeat themselves twice because you can't hear over your music.
Target,3ccdw7,DatTarget,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"At my store, music is allowed through personal devices - most people have a phone in their back pocket playing music or they'll put it in a cup and blast it for the whole Softlines section.

Target,3ccd6k,bagu1994,8,Mon Jul 6 20:28:52 2015 UTC,No but it is extremely monotonous and there is a lot of pressure to open red cards. Using the actual machine is quite easy and really easy to learn. The whole first day is spent learning the machine. Good luck with the job!

You'll make a lot of new friends and might end up enjoying it. Why not just give it 90 days, and see if it still is causing too much anxiety, then you can decide to quit or not.

Target,3c6n2q,melodieux_,5,Sun Jul 5 09:47:50 2015 UTC,HR has no control over your vacation time. they cannot approve nor deny it. you have to put it I'm the computer and partner with your etl. also I have no idea why your HR said it was early to ask for it off.... you now have 6 months to ask for time off and the earlier you ask the better the chances of getting it approved. by asking within a months time is kinda short notice so I can see why your ETL said no but then again if you are just a regular TM I really don't understand why unless they know a bunch of tms already have it off and can't afford to give you time off now too. if you are a GSA or a TL then it is kinda of unspoken blackout date that they aren't suppose to take off for. my advice try to get your shifts covered or explain to your etl that you will have to quit if they doesn't get approved. I mean you could go to your STL and explain the entire situation but they might have they same response. .. good luck either way
Target,3c6n2q,LeChiotx,5,Sun Jul 5 15:59:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly the answer. HR doesn't have the authority to decide if/when you get your vacation, and May was definitely not ""too early"". When I worked at Target I always submitted my requests 5+ months in advance.  OP, you need to go speak to your ETLs. Explain the situation and that you already booked tickets (this is how I've gotten to take every vacation during ""blackout periods"" at every retail place I've ever worked) because of what HR told you and there shouldn't be much of an issue."
Target,3c6n2q,PM_ME_HOLE_PICS,3,Sun Jul 5 18:43:19 2015 UTC,"Have you talked to your ETL about it (or who ever makes your schedule)? In all honesty, a salesfloor ETL may be less worried about a cashier needing time off than an ETL-GE"

Or maybe you found out a better way to handle truck days.   Ps. Did your etls not coach you on the answers they wanted you to say? When I went in for the bux tl interviews, I had a ton of stories I was really proud of and they just red sharpied them all gave me ""better"" answers for me to say with the DM interview that were more generic to answers I could find online.   I ended up turning the job down, but its really not as bad as people make it out to be. But the frustration is real, as Im sure you already know. I hope you have a good team that backs you up. Good luck!"
Target,3c5i8l,redditrandomity,4,Sun Jul 5 00:13:33 2015 UTC,"For the most part yes, but you shouldn't change your availability in your first 90 days. HR hates that (source: I work in HR) and they can let you go for any reason and dress it up as unsatisfactory performance under 90 days. Also, if you're looking for flexibility, plano is the wrong workcenter for that. Best to go with sales floor, cashier, maybe even backroom.   That being said, if you apply with crappy availability, you probably won't even get an interview."
Target,3c5i8l,suckersponge,2,Sun Jul 5 01:56:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be changing it within the first 90 days. I would apply with my school availability.   Even without over night shifts, I can do around 20 hours a week. Probably closer to 25, but without overnights scheduling me would be a little restrictive. I'd be completely open Friday-Sunday, and just have weirdness going on Monday-Thursday (basically have to come in around or after 3:30p/5:30p depending on the day) not being able to work Wednesday at all until October.   Obviously, I don't know what they expect from their part timers in terms of hours per week, so would that be crappy availability to Target? Sorry to overload you, I just don't want to apply if they're not even going to consider me."
Target,3c5i8l,suckersponge,3,Sun Jul 5 02:18:44 2015 UTC,"If you apply with your school availability, you probably won't even get a call. There are many people out there applying with open availability and to someone looking at applications, that's a lot more desirable. If you're not going to change your availability until after 90 days, apply with open availability, that's literally the first thing we look at in your application.   As for the amount of hours you're looking to work, it won't be an issue. Personally, I like when people only want to work part time because I can't guarantee full time hours."
Target,3c5i8l,Nevek117,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:36:48 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I wouldn't have a choice. School starts August 10, so to apply with open availability I would have to change it within the first 90 days. Thanks for the feedback."
Target,3c5i8l,Besnasty,2,Sun Jul 5 02:45:38 2015 UTC,"They worked well with me. I had weekends open and after 3pm for weekdays plus two days off (Tuesdays and thursdays). That was during fall 2014 and I got like 20 hours, and towards November something like 34 every week. I recommend talking to HR about it like month advance, fill out form and just say it's for school. Even offer to bring official schedule (like a printout from your school) so you seem serious about it. Just make sure to get an update few days after if it's approved or not, nothing worse than trying to get shifts covered all first week."
Target,3c5i8l,Smokeeye123,2,Sun Jul 5 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"My store has always been super good with my crazy availability. I have another job that is kind of sporadic during the week, and they have always been super understanding, even back last fall when I changed my availability to just sat and sun. I work in the food area, so it is a little bit more laid back than the rest of the store, so they may not be as understanding, but it always worth to apply. Just write down as much open time you have and then explain further if you get an interview."

Target,3c1yil,employee1281,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:09:17 2015 UTC,Thats very true. Sadly this is how my last job ended as well ( It was my first retail job) maybe I am just not cut out for retail.
Target,3c1yil,zieen,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"Most people aren't. I love retail, but Target as a company has been steadily going downhill for a long time. The need for constantly improving profits means hours will be cut, positions will be merged/eliminated, and long time, well paid employees will often be pushed out (generally because they're jaded and realize how bad things are getting).  Otherwise, it's great. But back to my point, retail isn't for everyone, especially if you're lacking in confidence or are antisocial. I don't mean to say you fall under one of those, but if two jobs haven't panned out, I'd look elsewhere. You could try back room or flow though."
Target,3c1yil,comicidiot,7,Mon Jul 6 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"I had an exceptionally great experience. Of course, your milage may vary. The first 90 days in any job is really weird. You don't know how to fit in, what you're doing, how to do what you're doing, etc. More or less you don't have the routine for both the work rhythm and the social aspect of the workplace down.  But after I got situated I was having a great time. I got along with my ETLs, TLs and TMs. I worked hard and learned more departments. I moved from Zone to Instocks during my time, I had a bigger impact under Instocks than anywhere else. I could work as I wanted, I had multiple ETLs and TLs to bounce ideas off of and ask for assistance. Before long I became the Go-to boy for getting shit done because I knew how to do it and do it right.  Now, that may seem like a fantastic experience - I enjoyed every minute of it - but it started to get to me. I was doing TL tasks for TM pay. I had my own job still to do as well. I was constantly told that I'd make a great TL, so I applied. ""Oh, we just hired someone else for that position."" ""Oh, we don't think you're ready yet."" ""The position is not going to be filled anymore"" (This was back when Instocks TL was merged with Backroom TL) and so many other excuses. I eventually made it to a TL interview only to be offered a GSA position. I said fuck that, but accepted, and started looking for other jobs. A week later I found a job someplace else, with better pay and hours. I put my 2 weeks in and only thought if it was a mistake it a few times.  I had to keep reminding myself that I need to do this for me and they obviously didn't have my growth in mind.  Of course, there were a few ETLs and TLs I didn't get along with, but that was their issue and they didn't stay around for long; they either got fired, transferred or quit. Not because of me, mind you, but because they just didn't work well with those in the store. There were other negative experiences but overall, my experience was genuinely and exceptionally positive.   And my time at Target actually helped get me the job I have today, one interviewer noted how hard it is to get and keep a job at Target on-top of the length of time I had worked there. So that was pretty awesome too"
Target,3c1yil,zieen,2,Sat Jul 4 02:49:31 2015 UTC,"This seems to be a super common experience for hard workers with good attitudes. You need to spend more time socializing and less time working to really advance at Target.  I get constant positive feedback, but even a mostly good store can't compete with bad corporate policies."
Target,3c1yil,comicidiot,2,Mon Jul 6 21:27:35 2015 UTC,"Long response warning  It really is; I didn't spend enough time schmoozing. I bet if I was less of a one-man-team, and I asked a fellow TM to print my labels while I gossiped with an ETL in front of the endcap I was setting, or while PTMing seasonal, I would be working for Target as a TL right now.  I was told they don't ""bring on"" TLs in the fourth quarter because there's no time to train a new TL. And guess what, they hired a new TL for Electronics in November. But I figured, I'll wait until February. Maybe this is something that was in the works for while; the new hire worked as a vendor in our store. But no. After the fiscal year ended, I was not at the top of my mountain.  What gets me. Is that I was trained in all areas of the store: Electronics, Zone, P Fresh, Backroom, Receiving, Operator, Guest Services and, I probably could have figured out Front Lanes with my cashier experience, intuition and some questions to a GSA or GSTL. I could have easily taken the Electronics TL spot and learned the paperwork stuff by overseeing my peers and asking questions.  The other thing is, the current (at-the-time) Electronics TL was still working. She ended up moving to a new department so the new hire was to cover Electronics when she moved in February; the TLs tend to get switched up around the start of the fiscal year at my store.  In the end, part of me is glad I left. Like you said, the bad corporate policies were just omnipresent. The bad quotas and metrics. It was all numbers. No one cared about what team members could physically do, they just cared if the their numbers met the goals set on paper. ETLs/TLs would find shortcuts, steal from other departments coughInstockscough so their numbers were good while the departments who lost team members suffered. I was literally asked why Instocks is so bad. ""Uh, well, we're taken for this, that and, our tasks are seen as second-rate compared to reshops."" And every instocks team member, all 4 of us, said this to every one who asked. But God came around when there was a visit, or inventory. All the sudden Instocks was the most important process in the entire store. ""Oh, you need more people? HERE! Just get it done."""
Target,3c1yil,zieen,2,Mon Jul 6 22:10:16 2015 UTC,"I'm fortunate enough to have a ETL-Operations that fights for Instocks.  Best practice is contradictory when it comes to Instocks.  On one had, recent communication says Instocks is not to help any part of the store with their tasks until Instocks's task list is completed, but on the other hand, there's still old communication that says Instocks can't start scanning until all backstock has been completed and reshop has been worked.  Most the good TLs feel the same way you do.  I mean the ones that care about what's best for the store, not the ones who are a perfect image of what corporate wants a TL to be."
Target,3c1yil,comicidiot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:46:58 2015 UTC,"I too had a great ETL-Op. Was working with me towards TL and had Instocks best interest at heart because he knew it was that department that made a great store. He did a lot of pushing with the other ETLs to get us the liberties we had, such as completing the task list and stuff. That was all in the 6 months I was working with him. We still had to backstock and do reshops but at least one of us could break away and do RIGs, Research and PTMs. The others joined as they finished."

But I also feel it would be unfair to them If I reached my 90 days and just said ""okay Im done!"" M co workers are awesome, the store is great, but having recently found out about having anxiety and needing to deal with that, I think its best if I were to not work there anymore. Its sad really, but who wants to be filled with anxiety every time they go to work?"
Target,3c1yil,comicidiot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:48:23 2015 UTC,"A bit of tough love here, you're going to need find away to get over it. You're going to feel uncomfortable where ever you work if your reaction is to succumb to your anxiety. Find something to motivate yourself.  Get a full-time job somewhere and as soon as you get medical benefits start seeing a psychiatrist if you aren't already. If you don't want to wait apply for Obamacare. Every day you go to work, tell yourself this is to better you. To find out what's wrong. To find out how to overcome this anxiety.  Maybe you can teach yourself some computer skills: Programming, Graphic Design, Editing (proofreading news articles, etc). So your only contact is with e-mail or an instant message, though phone calls and in-person meetings may happen.  Don't be so quick to give up :)"

It's been designed by those that really don't understand what it's like working in the stores. The fact that it can only be set up to give you default links for 2 work centers annoys me.

You have to remember that Target adjusts pricing on certain items if local competitive pricing is higher/lower.

Target,3bkkiq,oath2order,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:14:31 2015 UTC,Make sure your pricing team has an accurate score.  This item was likely an up in price through missed price change workload.  The signs generate based on being lower than the price that should be accurate on the shelf.

The trick to being a GSTL is to produce REDcards and promote the initiative with everything you have.  This drives sales in many ways.  Don't lose focus on the guest experience, call out your peers and even supervisors when you need fast checkout.  Last but not least keep the front end brand top notch, full cartwell, no trash full outside or inside, no unused flats or tubs in sight, and reshop clean."

Target,3bg6l6,Rilo12,4,Mon Jun 29 20:08:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, I should have been more clear - I don't work at a store, I work at the CSC on the team that supports Ship From Store.  I've been supporting Ship From Store since its first rollout when it was just six stores in Minneapolis.  So as for what TMs actually do with their time?  Depends on the store.  I know some stores are busy enough that they have people who just come in and pick, then pack, and that's an entire shift.  Some stores have multiple people that do that.  Right now if your store just got started or will get started soon then your order cap is really low, like 50 or something.  That goes up procedurally, basically spend 3 weeks getting all of your orders picked and packed on time and accurately and the system ups your cap.  Be terrible a lot and the system drops it.  This is designed so that your store can easily find a level you can handle.  What I meant was, any questions about the systems or individual procedures used in Ship From Store?"

It only burns about the first dozen or so times you use them, but the vision loss in the eye you choose is fairly minimal.  On a more serious note, Manhattan: you should have access to it if you're on the FF team at your store.  Top left, click on Menu. Click on the Dashboard tab.  Click on View Dashboard.  You will see two boxes on the right half of the screen, these are orders which have been picked and scanned into hold locations (carts).  On each of these boxes there's a scroll bar going from left to right, go all the way right and click on the Excel logo.  This opens all of them in an excel spreadsheet.  The ones at the top of the spreadsheet that say ""Printed"" on the right side?  Those ones still need to be packed.  In the middle of the sheet you'll see what hold location they're in.  Got an item left in a cart but no collate for it?  Open up this list and find your offender.  LPNs are on the far left.  Got a number next to ""Pack Container""?  Check this list.  You might need to reprint these collates and check if they've been packed.  People do manage to pack stuff without actually scanning it through, especially now that we're autostaging (don't worry about it).  If you split a collate, the original is no longer to be used.  Throw it away immediately.  If any collates fail to print from splitting the collate, check manhattan for the LPNs.  Then reprint manually.  Manhattan is ridiculously useful.

Target,3bg6l6,maxc7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:59:33 2015 UTC,I've been doing this since last October. When your able to find everything for your orders it's the easiest job in the store. It's also a nice break from working Backroom. You just walk around the store picking items the APP tells you. When you have a lot of orders and can't find nothing it's hell because you have to have everything picked by a certain time then packed before UPS comes. No ETLs or TLs bother you though so it's pretty sweet

It's SUPER rare if anyone finishes reshop (I'm the shoe specialist so I finish all of mine when I close) and there are always unfinished zones. I think the main reason we have so few is because we just extended our hours and almost everyone decided to change their availability to they can't stay after 10pm.

Target,3beqhe,monkeyman80,5,Sun Jun 28 22:24:36 2015 UTC,Think of the GSA position as a proving ground. It might seem like everyone is treating you like shit but don't take it personally it's just part of the job. Be a team player but don't forget to step up as a leader. Make confident decisions. Hold your team accountable for the bad things they do but reward them for the good things they do.

Target,3bfvuo,onceamennonite,21,Sun Jun 28 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"We're hounded to tasks guests if they want a red card. You can actually get in trouble for not getting guests to get redcards. It just shows commitment to the store. 5% is not bad but its something. What I dd  was get the debit card version of it, I recommend you do the same if you can. And I've mever heard of prices being inflates by 5%....."
Target,3bfvuo,Fr0stSoldier,18,Sun Jun 28 21:51:11 2015 UTC,"It doesn't mean that. If you compare prices, you will find that some items are cheaper at Walmart, and some are cheaper at Target. The REDcard doesn't mean all of Target's prices are inflated 5%, it says Target is willing to sacrifice a 5% profit margin on each and every item to grow store loyalty because making 2 cents on something a hundred times is more than making 7 cents on something fifty times. The REDcard fosters loyalty and thus increases store profits overall due to increased loyalty and frequency.   I see how you could misunderstand it that way, though, but the truth is the margin is actually negative on some items - they're called loss-leaders, etc., even without the 5% REDcard discount. The margin varies on every item. Some margins are 0, -5% with the REDcard, some are 40%, 35% with the REDcard, etc. The idea of the REDcard is all about loyalty, though, so that when you do buy those high margin items, you do it at Target (and to be honest, they're high margin most everywhere anyways.)"
Target,3bfvuo,slenderwin,-13,Sun Jun 28 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"It doesn't mean that.   No, I fully understand that margins vary from item to item.  I'm talking about an artificially inflated price relative not to acquisition cost, but rather to the price they expect you to pay.  ""Yes, this item is marked Y, but [real/loyal/preferred] customers only pay X.""  And, per /u/Fr0stSoldier's comment, they want everyone to be a preferred customer.  So I don't think my characterization is that far off.   The idea of the REDcard is all about loyalty   Funny thing about that - Target had my loyalty, until REDcard. This stuff just makes me feel manipulated.  But I recognize I'm an outlier, psychology/marketing-wise.  If I don't go back, they won't miss me."
Target,3bfvuo,YoshiMagick,23,Sun Jun 28 23:19:43 2015 UTC,The 5% that you save is related to the credit card transactional fees associated with credits cards.  It costs the store something like 3% of a purchase to accept credit cards and its a way for them to save money and for you to save money as well as offering a loyalty program.
Target,3bfvuo,Shadow51585,14,Sun Jun 28 23:40:37 2015 UTC,"To tack onto this for OP, Target Corp has it's own bank (most people probably assume this, but just a helpful FYI). Red Cards are issued through that bank, thus getting guests to use a Red Card saves them those processing fees previously mentioned for other major credit cards.   Overall it is both a money saving option for Target and a loyalty program rolled into one.   Red Card is at it's core; Target wants to reward you for assisting them in saving money on retail purchases."
Target,3bfvuo,carminetruckyours,4,Mon Jun 29 00:54:43 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the redcards go through TD bank.
Target,3bfvuo,Shadow51585,3,Mon Jun 29 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"Ah, so yes, they are. As seen on the back of my own redcard.... and here I was told Target Bank issued them by an ETL who is normally right about said things.   In that case I'd bet they have a deal with TD about fees, but that's just speculation."
Target,3bfvuo,carminetruckyours,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:39:35 2015 UTC,I feel as if they do. I think Target gets money in their pocket from TD when redcards are opened up. It would makes sense why target as a corporation pushes it so hard. I'm not really sure though.
Target,3bfvuo,anyquestions,2,Mon Jun 29 04:34:02 2015 UTC,It's also because REDcard holders are statistically proven to have a higher average transaction amount than non REDcard holders. This could be mistaking correlation for causation - people who like Target and spend lots of money there are naturally more likely to be REDcard holders - but the correlation is definitely there. The exact statistics for basket sizes for REDcard vs non REDcard holders for your store should be on your Vibe board in TSC.
Target,3bfvuo,carminetruckyours,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:48:15 2015 UTC,"That sounds right, I just feel theres got to be some big deal between TD and Target because the redcards are made out to be too big of a deal."

Target,3bfvuo,khakionbottom,6,Mon Jun 29 02:12:39 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty happy with the REDcard, and both slenderwin and Fr0stSoldier are right. I like that it gets me free shipping from the site, and I can stack discounts with it (REDcard + cartwheel + instore sales + other coupons, etc). It all adds up."
Target,3bfvuo,Tostecles,5,Sun Jun 28 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"The reason Target pushes their card so hard is because they have to pay a fee of I think 3% every time someone uses a debit card, unless it's the Target card, there's no transaction fee the store has to pay for that. It's a double-whammy of encouraging ""guest loyalty"" by having them know they'll save a bit of money with the card, and it saves the store money because they don't have to pay the transaction fee associated with other banks' cards.   PS. I fucking hate Redcards. You are not alone. Everyone expresses distaste for it, both employee and guest. The discount is nice, but the hounding is awful and I'm sorry."
Target,3bfvuo,Tostecles,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:54:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this.  It does really come down to the hounding.  Knowing that I am now going to get the red card sales pitch every time through the checkout line doesn't exactly feed my desire to shop there.  (Being downvoted to oblivion in my comments in this thread doesn't help much either, even though I did learn some actual facts by asking the question.)"
Target,3bfvuo,semen_drinker,8,Mon Jun 29 09:23:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the cashier dreads asking you as much as you dread being asked. I've had several people greet me when I used to be a checker with something like, ""hi, I don't want a card, thanks"". Just be polite and pre-emptive about it and hopefully they won't hound you multiple times, but it is actually the rule to ask 3 times per transaction (fucking crazy, I know), so don't be surprised if that happens. Just so you know, the cashiers' jobs literally depend on those cards. They WILL be fired if they don't get enough- I've seen it happen. Maybe take the survey at the bottom of your receipt and give the cashier a good review to help them out."
Target,3bfvuo,semen_drinker,6,Mon Jun 29 09:34:15 2015 UTC,"So I use to work at target but only for about three months so I feel I can see both sides of this. As someone who works there, they just want you to consider it at least. So many people say no so fast (assuming it's only a credit card option) that they don't actually even consider it but if you hear them out, you might actually be interested, and if not that's fine too. As a customer, let me tell you, I never had one until someone properly told me the benefits AND more importantly assured me the risks I wouldn't be taking.   I learned about the debit card option and these are exactly what sold me on it : no credit check or credit score used or looked at AT ALL. No bill.  No seperate account to transfer money to or from. It's literally like having another card attached to the bank account you already used but this particular card only works at target. Also, free shipping from the website and 90 days for returns (bonus, you don't have to keep track of receipts, they look it up on your target card. Bought shoes 89 days ago and you now aren't happy with them?all you need is your card and you can return them) That's it. That simple. No fuss, nothing scary. The ONLY things I can see as reasons not to get the debit are two things... Either you're using a credit card and it offers better savings. OR if you are the type of person who forgets when they are waiting for money to come out of their account. When you use the target debit card, it takes about 3 days for the money to come out of your account. I know for some people this is an issue or a hassle.   As far as the stupid tax, I can see what you mean but at the same time, if you are use to shopping target, I'm sure you won't go to Walmart more than a couple times before deciding you're more than willing to pay that 5% ""tax"" just to not be at Walmart. You could also consider it paying a stupid tax every time you buy an item that you didn't find a coupon for. Most every grocery item has coupons at some point and combine it with a sale and you could save way more than 5% but most of us don't bother. So we are already paying a stupid tax in a way.   The person who said its about loyalty is right. I almost exclusively shop at target now and it's honestly not for the 5%. It's the super easy returns up to 90 days with the red card and no receipt needed. It's the savings I get from combining red card and cartwheel(very easy app to use and save) and red perks (not available everywhere yet though). And I shop there for the sheer fact that I don't want to be at Walmart. And for everyone who always moans that Walmart is cheaper, target can be the same price if you put a little effort into it."
Target,3bfvuo,FUCKREDDIQUETTE,-1,Sun Jun 28 23:36:18 2015 UTC,"I appreciate you being the only one in this thread to try to appreciate the psychology at work here.  And you're right about Wal Mart.  I did in fact go there today and was immediately struck by the country muzak and the reek of desperate lives.  Yikes.  But, the price on the item was what I actually paid, and nobody tried to convince me to sign up for anything; and for a person with my makeup, the straightforwardness of the transaction almost balances out the horrible ethos of the place.  The fact that much of the redcard's 5% figure comes from undercutting the credit card company does make some sense.  I'm sure Visa doesn't love seeing it happen, and I'm a little surprised they don't have a rule about cash discounts (or the equivalent) for the vendors they work with, but I suppose their only real rule is against a surcharge for use.  Knowing that it's the main engine for the discount makes it easier for me to live with.  Though when I say that, I just mean living with the aforementioned ""stupid tax"" since the main beneficiary of it is not Target.  The hard part for me isn't so much the money, but the fact that I have to have the same damnable conversation with a cashier every time I buy something.  (And suspecting, now, that I might be harming the cashier's job or something by the repeated refusals.)"
Target,3bfvuo,monkeyman80,5,Mon Jun 29 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about the cashier too much. If you are just really not wanting the card for whatever reason just say ""I have one, thanks"". They will stop 9/10 times."

Former employee, I applied for the credit card first and was denied due to thin file (short credit history).

However the fact that they called 11 months after the initial 6 month time period may mean either an error on their part or they're bending over backwards for you giving you another chance.

Target,3b9zl3,yellowchef,14,Sat Jun 27 05:40:37 2015 UTC,"This biggest complaint I've heard is that people use the self checkout because they want to be left alone, so of course Target is going to stick somebody over there to pester people about redcards."
Target,3b9zl3,Skiff_Manchester,5,Sat Jun 27 05:12:34 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem with the self checkouts is that guests have a hard time using them, even though they are pretty user friendly and straightforward. Overseeing them is pretty easy, all you have to do is help guests with any issues they encounter and card people for cough medicine/fireworks/other things you card people for besides alcohol. Yep, no alcohol sales at the self checkout, not sure why..   Watch out for guests who are standing there staring at the screen; often times guests swipe their card without hitting ""finish and pay"" and the transaction will not complete until you do. Also people tend to walk away right after swiping their card even though they did not get a receipt and technically haven't paid yet.   One problem I've run in to is the Target meat and produce coupons that are stuck to the product (the red and white ones that are usually 2-3 dollars off) The self checkout machine wants the guest to insert any coupons scanned in to the machine, but the meat coupons are nearly impossible to peel off cleanly and they're sticky. Our solution is to have the overseer carry around slips of paper with the words ""meat coupon"" written on them to put in the machine when a guest scans one of those coupons. It works but it would be better if the system could recognize that this type of coupon does not need to be redeemed."

At my store they also like to freeze up a lot so we're constantly having to reboot them which takes forever. Also cartwheel and other mobile coupons don't work.

Target,3b9zl3,doxxmyself,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:46:17 2015 UTC,"So you'll learn to hate these machines based on how much maintenance they need to keep running. after speaking to our friendly ncr repair man, its actually the software on these things that makes them annoying. some walmarts use the same hardware, their software, and its a breeze and he never gets called. anyway:  right now, scanning cartwheel doesnt work. you must enter in the numbers.   mobile coupons dont scan either. have to enter in as manual coupon  amex, visa, mc gift cards dont work either, have to move them to regular register.   no alcohol sales allowed, nobody reads the sign.  if you have a $100 order, and you use one of those $25 visa or amex gift card debit cards, it will usually crash the system. but it will (sometimes) take the $ from the card anyway.  the finish and pay thing is the best. guests are always like ""hey i hit it aleady"" and i just walk over, press the button and walk away.  your going to get very good at pressing the touchscreen fast if you watch this enough. im insane at it, and its a cool little trick to impress the guest with if they are a bit angry if it took long for someone to get help.  filling change is a hassle, especially when its busy, because a receipt wont print until the machine gives out the change.   we usually have a cashier watch the machine during q4 and weekends if i can afford to have one over there. makes life much easier.  besides that, the machines are cool i guess."

I ran into this problem as a salesman at Staples. Promoting me to manager or tech would have been a loss for the company, so they told me to fuck myself and kept me as a low-level salesman and hired from the outside."
Target,3b81d0,PM_ME_HOLE_PICS,2,Sat Jun 27 02:58:55 2015 UTC,"Our store is the opposite sometimes. This girl wanted to leave the checklanes so bad because she just couldn't stand being in the same spot and not moving around and doing sales floor stuff. She wanted to switch to softlines and would've been a solid enough worker over there but she couldn't get out because she wasn't getting Red Cards at a high enough rate. I get that as a cashier that is one of your key things to excel at, but why the hell wouldn't you want to move someone to an area they could actually perform in? Being good at getting red cards shouldn't be a requisite for leaving the checklanes as that is the key component of being a ""good"" cashier."

Target,3b7f5e,targetthrow,3,Fri Jun 26 16:01:36 2015 UTC,"For my ULV store that does not have the E&E or even partial E&E remodels:  5:30 to 6:45/7:00 - Get four carts and take them to electronics. Throw truck, bump boxes down the line or actually be on the line during the whole unload process. After the unload is compete make sure all security repacks are locked inside the zone 9 cage and roll it out to electronics.  6:45/7:00 to 7:30-ish - Push paper wall at the front of the store with another guy. I do the tissues and he does paper towels and toilet paper. We also push all back end caps in HBA and the three sections of Clorox on the back wall. Clean up the mess and take paper backstock to the appropriate locations.  7:30-ish to 7:40 - Both the paper guy and I break out security repacks. One cart for all tablet, camera, phone accessories; one cart for video games; and a third cart for everything else (ink, sound systems, headphones, tv accessories, etc.)  7:40 to 8:30 - Push carts starting with all of the tablet, camera, and phone stuff. Then we move everything over to the other side of electronics along the back wall and continue with everything else. I usually finish the small bit of video games we have by myself while the other guy begins pushing the flatbed of MMB repacks.  8:30 to 9 - Push MMB as quickly as we can because I have to go to the sales floor by 9 and he usually goes to the backroom at 9:30.  9:00 - Go over security list and check off everything I remember seeing $100 and over. Of course it would be bet to do this during the breakout or push, but if I have any doubts I just pull it up on the MyDevice and give a very thorough review.  The sales floor team lead is very adamant that I stop having anything to do with the truck at 9 AM when I am on the sales floor, whether it is completed or not so I pray we can finish the workload by then. Lately we have been getting slammed with security repacks and books so that has not been helping. When they are not there I say screw it and keep helping anyway because I need that product out on the floor.  The upside is our merchandise protection. It was abysmal when I took over the electronics push and we were losing a lot of product as a result, but it has improved significantly in the last six months. I also have a good relationship with AP so we keep each other up to date on what's going on."

If it doesn't show an endcap POG, then there shouldn't be any signs there. If it shows 5 items on the endcap that should have signs and there is only 1 up, then you can easily see which ones are missing them.  With the MyDevice you can scan the label of assortment items and it will list everything in the assortment, which you can then click on to see details of.  This helps me when they come in and don't have a set date on the box.  If you have issues with the MyDevice dying after just a few hours, turn down the screen brightness at least half way by swiping up from the bottom of the screen and lowering the brightness bar and it will last quite a bit longer.

Electronics gets paid more than just a regular team member (although that may be different now that they raised the minimum), but both positions do about the same thing, and will likely involve closing. Plano and backroom would probably have you there early morning. Not sure what their pay rate is compared to the floor.  Cashier is cashier. Closing is likely, and I believe pay is bottom rung, but no less than sales floor."

Also make sure you're asking every guest ""Can I help you find something?""!   When in reality you're suppose to ask guests ""Can I help you find something"" and take the time to service them. It's probably from finding that one guest and helping them from picking the item to ringing them up and scoring a red card and a survey. But the ETLs don't want you to spend an hour or more on one guest and they'd rather their high conversion cashier get the red card.  ETLs don't like me spending 10 minutes with a guest. Sure, I can point them in the direction of an item and be on my merry way. Is that guest going to find it on their own? Will they get side tracked and ultimately forget to look for the item? If I take them to the item, I have a confirmed sale because I took them there and found it for them. I've also usually gotten another location request from those people I take my time with.  That's what I think Vibe Ambassador should be. They should be given the time to spend with guests over other floor duties. If I were to be a VA I'd do reshops and CAFs sure, but don't give me a time limit and a quota to fulfill."

She describes it as being very global, whether it's helping out at guest service, watching the front lanes, or covering for electronics. She also mentioned that she helps out guests that need extra care. Like say you're a team member that needs to get your pull done quickly but the guest you're with has a laundry list of stuff they need help with (or they're just a sweet old lady that walks slower than a snail), you would pass on that guest to the Vibe Ambassador.   Pretty much just be a presence in the store. Be someone guests can say ""I had a question about something, where is that one girl I JUST saw"", and then be there. Of course talk up the RedCard and Guest Surveys. Most importantly, have full communication with the Remodel Leader so that you can inform team members and guests of any changes.

Target,3aitrw,dubblechzburger,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:24:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, unless Mobile has a killer trade in deal going on (double or triple value) I'd sell it on eBay.  I do that for all of mine and it's much better than whatever game stop or any trade in place will give you. I'd wager double the price. Here are some examples for you.  EA UFC over a year after it came out: $22. I doubt gamestop would've given more than $10 after half a year for that game let alone a year.  Titanfall for the 360 a year after it came out: 18.  2014 Fifa World Cup edition. $38  And if the game is fairly new it can be even higher. I got 30-40 each for 3 PS4 games that I sold within a few months of buying and sometimes you'll get lucky and it'll hit 50 if it's really relatively new.  Just my suggestion from personal experience. I always buy my games on sale (unless it's a game I've been dying for) and sell them on eBay after. I think I've sold probably 50+ games on eBay the last several years this way.  Edit: If you want an idea of what your games are going for on eBay just go there, search it and then on the left side if you scroll you'll eventually come across sold listings. You can click that and it will show you, starting from most recent, what that item has sold for. Plus it will say whether or not it was a buy it now price or an auction."

From a backroom TM I can tell you that OFCE and STAT pulls of around 45 min each is ridiculous considering we have an hour to pull, and the hourly batches end up being around 2 hours.   Do the math and you see why we hate it, as there is one TM on at most points in the afternoon. It's assumed that you will get help, but calling the LOD or asking market for assistance every hour gets old fast."

Target,3aidby,Shadow51585,2,Thu Jun 25 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"We will usually have overlap until about 2pm. But that second person is almost always backstocking the remainder from the morning.   It's not even really a manpower problem, it's a space problem. We have a VERY tiny backroom and are a high volume store, so we simply run out of space a lot, even using overflow locations.   We have aisles 1 - 13 on one half of the room and aisles 30 - 45 on the other half. Aisles 1 - 7 go up to J with 8 - 13 only going to F, and 30+ Go to P, so... a bit longer. In the middle are the freezers and coolers with the electronics stockroom wedged in there as well next to our central fire tunnel (we're pfresh as well)  Locations 100 - 135 are scattered on the front walls and over the receiving line. So yeah..... it's depressingly small :P  EDIT: Here we go. The central fire tunnel is behind me about 20 feet with the other half being a little less then double this length. http://i.imgur.com/9Cs21tL.jpg"

Had a woman a few weeks ago come to me (I'm 20 but I look very young, could pass off as 16 easily) since all the fraud people come to me, they think I'm young and new at the job.   She had her son with her, and the second I saw she had an overflowing cart of duplicate items, a lot of which were Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes (the most common fraud items I come across), I knew what she was going for. She went out of her way to ask me if it was ok to take her bags into another cart because she ""doesn't want anyone touching my stuff"" which of course was to prevent me from checking her items to match with coupons. Ended up getting away with most of it, but still paid us a pretty large sum in the end, so my LOD told me to not feel bad about it."

Target,3ah8cq,retromike,3,Sat Jun 20 12:11:49 2015 UTC,The minimum value to cash out a gift card is $9.99. Some worse coupon fraud tactics I've seen are when people buy like $200 worth of items and use $250 worth of incorrect coupons. Fo example using a $3 coupon for a $5 shampoo on the $1 travel sized one. To avoid the balance dropping below zero is where the gift cards come in. It may seem like theyre still paying x amount but its just from gift cards they'll cash out later. Almost like we're paying them at the end + they get more profit if theyre resellers.
Target,3ah8cq,monkeyman80,3,Sat Jun 20 19:24:34 2015 UTC,Many don't resell. What they do is return the items. Since we were reimbursed the coupon value we pay out the full amount. So they use a 30 dollar Philips razor coupon on a 100 dollar razor they get back 100 not 70. During the breach when we were all things guest and couldn't refuse returns we had people bringing in basically a full cart worth of hba items to return

Target,3ad0vu,LeChiotx,5,Fri Jun 19 04:17:36 2015 UTC,They will start sending them out once all the stores are rolled out with the new register software. Target team members will get theirs first. Target branded red card credit cards will be sent first. Followed by the debit. The co branded cards will be last as they are switching to MasterCard instead of visa. Those will probably be rolled out beginning of next year. Stores currently with the new software can accept third party credit cards with the chip but not debit yet. That will be turned on after all stores are rolled out.
Target,3ad0vu,cbosch12,2,Fri Jun 19 03:17:02 2015 UTC,Can someone explain the big deal with the chip cards?
Target,3ad0vu,Fr0stSoldier,2,Fri Jun 19 11:24:03 2015 UTC,They're supposed to be safer to use considering the breach a while ago
Target,3ad0vu,shoptillyoudrop,2,Fri Jun 19 13:15:13 2015 UTC,The US Gov't is requiring all credit card companies to switch to chip & pin technology (currently standard in Europe) by October of this year to help curb credit card fraud.
Target,3ad0vu,cbosch12,3,Fri Jun 19 15:22:02 2015 UTC,Well the government is forcing them to adopt chip technology. It's up to the issuer to determine if it's chip and pin or chip and signature. The way they are forcing it is if there is a breach and the guest had a chip card but the retailer doesn't accept chip cards the the retailer is liable for the fraud. In Europe when they switched from mag stripe to chip technology the fraud dropped from 90% to less than 1%. The fraud then moved to online sales where the chip is not used for the transaction.
Target,3ad0vu,hawaiian717,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:43:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, the only government mandate regarding chip cards is that government issued cards migrate to Chip and PIN. Consumer credit cards isn't a mandate either, but is being promoted by a liability shift planned for October 2015 by Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. Fraud liability shifts from the issuer to whomever has the least secure technology. So banks are converting to chip cards so that they can shift liability on to merchants, thus merchants like Target are upgrading to accept chip cards so that fraud liability goes right back to the issuer (where it is today).  But as noted, there is no requirement that the cards be Chip and PIN. The vast majority of cards being issued in the US (unlike Europe and Canada) are Chip and Signature, though there are a handful of Chip and PIN cards out there besides the government issued cards. More common is for cards to support PIN as well, but to still prefer signature. MasterCard mandates some form of PIN support but Visa doesn't, so many Visa and Amex cards are Chip and Signature only while MasterCards will support PIN of some sort, but will only use it at places that can't take a signature (unattended rail ticket kiosks and gas stations in Europe typically)."
Target,3ad0vu,cbosch12,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:07:00 2015 UTC,Also to be noted is there are some issuers (AMEX is the one I know of) that won't even require a signature if the purchase is below a certain dollar amount. Again that is set by the issuer not the retailer.
Target,3ad0vu,hawaiian717,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:07:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's possible for a chip card to have No CVM as first on the list, but I've never heard of that. More likely is a continuation of the current program where transactions below a certain dollar amount don't require a signature, regardless of whether the transaction is chip or magstripe. The merchant has to participate though, places like Target don't ask for a signature for smaller purchases, but other places (typically small independent merchants) still do.  But there doesn't seem to be a PIN waiver. I don't have a Chip and PIN card personally, and I haven't found a Target near me that has turned on EMV yet, but at Walmart the only time I can recall actually having to sign for a chip transaction was a $70+ purchase, but I've heard from others that with a Chip and PIN card, they're prompted to enter the PIN even for small purchases."
Target,3ad0vu,tmiw,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:27:28 2015 UTC,All of the major card brands have such a thing but in my experience the merchant has to opt-in. A lot of smaller businesses still ask for signature even with amounts low enough to not need to.

There are a few that are pretty nice and are friends with a lot of people at the store, but then there is a group of them who all hang out together constantly around the store. They all take their breaks together, and wait for each other to be done with their shift before they leave, and all come in together.  Softlines is somewhat the same way. A large majority of them only socialize with the softlines people, but it doesn't help that literally every single softlines employee is a female of hispanic decent. So it isn't surprising that they all only talk to each other.  Hardlines, which is what I am, isn't like that at all. Pretty much all of them socialize with everyone around the store, and there aren't really any groups or cliques in Hardlines."

The closest we have is the team leaders are kind of their own clique who go on events outside of work semi frequently but if you're a decent worker they're cool with you. Hell I've played board games with a group at one tls place.   Everyone's cool with everyone as long as you're not a dick or think you're better for being in a certain spot. We hang out with each other in electronics but we'll also hang out with some of the girls from softlines or HR. Hang out with people from in stocks or backroom. Hang out with the mobile guy. If I ever have to cashier the permanent week day day side cashiers are cool. Just thought of pharmacy and they are probably the closest thing to a clique. If you don't talk to them they aren't going to talk to you and only really talk with a select group.
Target,3a932r,irishdanmurphy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:22:40 2015 UTC,"My store is very much like this. We're the largest store in the district, but we're very much average volume. We're a class D store but we have a larger volume than what you'd expect.   Anyway, the cashiers at my store are very similar. Most of them did just graduate or are about to, though. So it kind of makes sense for it to be that way. Electronics members, myself included, are some of the most friendly, but strange people at the store. Very quirky. Market team is very straightforward and hard working. Backroom is kinda lazy but they do their job well. Management act like college kids. Softlines are sweethearts and go out of their way for everyone. And cashiers are just plain unfriendly. No social skills."
Target,3a932r,lockwasher,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:06:30 2015 UTC,In our store the person who covers the changing room covers the operator duties and the cashiers are generally pretty helpful.  Sounds like you might need a little coaching on what team is really all about.
Target,3a932r,FrozenPhoenix95,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:27:39 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm lucky my store is how it is - there is not a single cashier I've met in my year of being there who wasn't cool in their own unique way, despite being more or less reserved/social than others. Our GSTL is awesome and knows how to talk to us like people and friends when needed, and as a boss when needed. There's one GSA who has her little ""clique"" of cashier friends when she's in, but I just try to ignore that since those cashiers are fine when she's not around. Our front end in general is extremely friendly and it makes me actually want to go in and work there as if it was just a hobby I do 4-5 times a week."
Target,3a932r,cspalko,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:57:22 2015 UTC,"I work brand cosmetics.  In my store  - cosmetics is right next to the cash lanes.  When they call for a backup at the lanes - I'm usually first to respond.  I only work 14 hours a week - but I feel at least 4 of them are as a backup cashier. I have not noticed any clique-like activity amongst the cashiers - unless they have adopted me as their own and I don't notice.   FWIW I started in softlines in November 2014.  Then I worked hardlines, spent a few months in market and ended up as brand cosmetics. I like my store and I feel we all get along really well.  When I come in on Saturdays -  I always help put away the things from the truck that are for cosmetics and beauty."
Target,3a932r,Fr0stSoldier,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:26:47 2015 UTC,Operator? Never heard of that position. What do you do?
Target,3a932r,toothless_vagrant,5,Thu Jun 18 10:35:13 2015 UTC,"I guess other stores probably say fitting room attendant. The operator answers the phones and mans the fitting room. At my store, at least, we are wayyyy short handed in soft lines and have at least 6 carts of softlines reshop and 5 z's at all times, so way more duties are put on our 4 operators than should be. We basically run softlines but are also given all the shit work the rest of softlines is too lazy to do."

Target,3a8p6r,karmasink,4,Thu Jun 18 05:25:10 2015 UTC,"Not quite the same but someone either stole one of our walkies or got on the same frequency. Started with just yelling and swearing every once in a while to finally yelling there's a bomb in the store over the walkie system. Had to go out to the edge of the parking lot for 30min to an hour and people had to leave their carts. Came back into sooo much stray.  Coincidentally, while comp shopping, I was in Walmart and all of a sudden over the intercom they were saying they needed everyone to leave the store and leave their things where they were. Noticed there were a few officers at the door and several police trucks outside. Ended up being a bomb threat also. This was like 2 weeks before ours so it was probably the same guy but yeah, when the Target one happened I just thought, geez this shit again?"
Target,3a8p6r,dubblechzburger,3,Thu Jun 18 23:35:10 2015 UTC,"Once had someone steal a walkie (I found it crushed in the parking lot later) and play ""My Neck, My Back"" for the entire song. We just had team members go to channel 3 and resume regular business.   I think I'm the only one in our store that actively knows where the master control buttons are for the speakers through the store are (electrical equipment room in the breezeway on blue side!) I've had my STL ask me to adjust them bc he didn't know where they were. If the intercom thing happened at our store, I'd be hauling ass across the parking lot to turn it off."
Target,3a8p6r,spearmintnickers,4,Fri Jun 19 05:57:29 2015 UTC,"Another store, don't remember which one, sent us a ticket in the CSC because someone claimed to be from corporate and said they had an important announcement so they needed to be transferred to the intercom. They then proceeded to announce a fire in the chemicals department."
Target,3a80gd,Chigger42,4,Wed Jun 17 23:13:11 2015 UTC,"Hardlines is one half of the sales floor. Basically you will be a sales floor team member for the side of the store that does not contain clothing, shoes, etc. Hardlines includes cosmetics, pharmacy, cleaning supplies, pet food, office supplies, appliances, home goods, food, electronics, toys, seasonal, and much more.  You will be trained on cash register, since you will need to go up for backup when the lines at the front end of the store get busy.  You will also put stock from the backroom onto the sales floor. This is called ""pushing"" ""pulls."" Pulls are carts of merchandise pulled by backroom team members from the backroom to replenish items that have been purchased from the sales floor.  You will also be responsible for ""zoning,"" which is essentially straightening up the products on shelves and making sure all items are in their correct place. I'm not sure how it is at other stores, but generally each sales floor team member is responsible for a specific area to zone. This is generally for closing shifts only.  There is also ""reshop,"" which is merchandise that guests have decided not to buy at the last minute, or items that you find out of place in your area. When you have time, you will put these items back in their proper place, so that guests and team members can locate them.  During morning shifts, you may also have sales planners to do, which involves resetting displays on endcaps at the end of aisles.  And of course, being a sales floor team member you will be responsible for helping guests find items, describe their purpose, and answer phone calls. There's a good bit more to it, but you'll learn that as you go. Hope this helps!"
Target,3a80gd,PigsWithSwords,2,Wed Jun 17 23:48:16 2015 UTC,One thing to note that in some stores reshop is called abandons
Target,3a80gd,Fr0stSoldier,4,Thu Jun 18 00:36:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I think I've seen some people on here call it ""go-backs."" Every store is just a bit different."
Target,3a80gd,PigsWithSwords,2,Thu Jun 18 00:44:56 2015 UTC,"They are also called ""strays""."
Target,3a80gd,Alldaylongbaby76,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:59:47 2015 UTC,"We have had transfers from other stores say abandons before when reshop is the term we usually use. There was a good dose of ""wtf is that ETL talking about"" from the HL team for a day or two."
Target,3a80gd,AMBocanegra,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:43:10 2015 UTC,"This was very informative, thank you!  I know I'll be cross trained as a cashier, but are cashiers a dedicated position and sales floor/hardlines is another position?  That was something I didn't quite understand.  Will my main duties consist of zoning and reshop/pulls/etc.  Or primarily cashiering, or a 50/50 of both?  They made it sound as if they're two solely independent positions, but I'm not sure?"
Target,3a80gd,PigsWithSwords,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:05:03 2015 UTC,"They are independent positions. There are dedicated cashiers, but when the store is busy and lines get longer than 3 guests, the GSTL/GSA (head of front end) will call over the walkie for temporary backup from the sales floor. That's where you come in. Occasionally you may have a cashier shift on your schedule, since technically you will know everything about that position, but that is generally just if the store is short on cashiers that week."

Target,3a5mf1,Avoid_Calm,2,Wed Jun 17 12:59:41 2015 UTC,"I had to wait a little while before my orientation, too, probably because of the post-holiday rush and getting a solid orientation together. The Team Leader who interviewed me later told me that she asked the ETL-HR (second interviewer, hired me) when I was going to join the team. He simply told her they had to wait. I don't know what was up, but if they said you've got an orientation coming, it's probably coming. I had to wait a few weeks myself."

Target,39xgqf,acer068,15,Mon Jun 15 16:24:47 2015 UTC,"That... Does not sound right at all. Target cannot FORCE you to stay past your scheduled shift time. They can certainly ask. Bribe you with food/drinks/etc. But they cannot force you.  They can, however, hold you accountable for your workload not being finished (Even if it's an unrealistic amount). That would not lead to an immediate termination though.  I would consult with your ETL-HR or STL and file a complaint. If they refuse to do anything and the ""termination"" holds firm... then I would suggest calling the Hotline."
Target,39xgqf,Isak922,11,Mon Jun 15 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I believe the majority of us are going to visit our HR to file a formal complaint.   The whole situation threw me off entirely, and put a very bad taste in my mouth."

Last remodel for my store was in 2007. When we added the pharmacy. We are a general merchandise store that still runs an analog security system. In our area alone there are two super wal marts and a full size Fred meyers. Not to mention 3 safeways. We could use a building expansion so bad. We might as well be a target express store with our measly 50,000 square foot building.   Shoot,  these new stores that get remodeled can at least give us their old stuff... We feel like that weird kid whose parents give them nothing but hand me down clothes,  taped up glasses, and a hammer for his 18th birthday.   Pay attention to us too our almighty Target master."

Target,39ubv1,RomulanBacon,2,Sun Jun 14 23:08:16 2015 UTC,"Most importantly: if you repeatedly run into an item with a very low (1) on-hand and you have looked everywhere, be sure your etl corrects the on-hand count. Problem solved. I take a cell phone photo of the Item Search or Flexi Fill screen and email it to my TL and Exec's target mail address."
Target,39ubv1,Jkay064,6,Wed Jun 17 18:29:43 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you run into those guests who insist that despite scanning the item and showing them that A. there's 0 on hand or B. there's the ever so fun 1 on hand that has no locations in the back room.   If you work in 1 area, you may run into that same item quite a bit and know that you've looked before and it's not in the store.  Either of those would be an extremely likely scenario that I've run into multiple times. So no need to assume the OP is dumb or doesn't know how to do their job. Hell, I just had someone looking for an Apple TV on Saturday and we showed 15 of them but no locations in the back and the home was empty. I was talking to one guy about that later  and low and behold, they went back on MIRs. So if a guest had insisted I went to the back and looked for them when I worked Sunday I would just kill time back there doing the same knowing damn well that we do not have them."
Target,39w3tf,IMgettingsickof2380,8,Mon Jun 15 07:26:05 2015 UTC,"Heck, during a mid shift, I've used an AP walkie when all the other ones were taken, and I'm a Softlines TM. This only happened once, though. If you're concerned about your ETLs and STLs using the surveillance systems, you can do something about it.  On a side note, interesting choice of username. I am assuming 2380 is your store...if that's the case, I would veer on the side of caution before decrying your ETL as a ""spineless, ball-less asshole"" on a public forum."
Target,39w3tf,TheNewThirteen,5,Mon Jun 15 23:28:41 2015 UTC,"STL's, and even ETL's I would assume, are allowed use of the AP walkies from what I've seen.  Unless you are an AP TM, AP TL, ETL-AP, or AP-BP, you cannot use the surveillance systems to watch TM's for anything that isn't related to AP concerns. At least, you can't watch them to see if they're loafing, taking extended breaks, etc."
Target,39w3tf,Isak922,3,Mon Jun 15 16:51:50 2015 UTC,All STL's (and a lot of ETLs) use 'AP walkies'. It's fairly common for AP to call my STL to 6 for some reason or another.  My ETL-Log has said a couple of times that he reviews truck footage at least once a week. I really wouldn't consider this as 'checking to see if TMs are loafing' but it could fall under making sure the throwers are working safely and not breaking things.
Target,39w3tf,Yield88,2,Mon Jun 15 22:05:35 2015 UTC,AP directives state that only AP team members can conduct surveillance.
Target,39w3tf,AforAnarchist,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:43:37 2015 UTC,"From my experience, I would say that this isn't normal. We rarely allow anyone into the AP office for any reason, unless they are the STL/ETL and want to review someone or they're giving us a heads up about someone. They'd be asked to leave the office immediately if they were to use our surveillance system without us present and without our permission.   As for the walkies, we're generally cool about it, but we have an over abundance of regular walkies that they use. Usually if they want to talk to us, they call us on the walkie and ask us to change to 3 or 4."
Target,39ubrx,XxAkenoxX,11,Sun Jun 14 21:08:04 2015 UTC,"I would suggest backroom. Yes it's hard work, but it's more pleasant work than cart attendant. Cart attendant has to collect the carts outside regardless of weather conditions, takes care of trash, and cleans the bathrooms."
Target,39ubrx,Ladybird310,10,Sun Jun 14 21:24:09 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine has worked in both areas. Was hired as a cart attendant and hated it due to having to push carts, do carry-outs, clean the restrooms, collect reshop/hangers, cashier, and whatever else the front end decided they needed. It's not fun and it's difficult. But if your front end team is good, you can sometimes get free food/drinks for working hard.   Backroom is significantly better, but you have to learn fast and be exceptional with timing. It's very fast-paced and very dependant on ability."
Target,39ubrx,irishdanmurphy,6,Sun Jun 14 21:17:14 2015 UTC,"Go backroom!!! It's significantly better. You don't have to deal with guests most of the time and if you have good leaders, it can be super chill in the back!!  Edit: you get paid more too off the bat."
Target,39ubrx,chaoscontrol91,4,Sun Jun 14 22:35:59 2015 UTC,Seeing as it may be your first job say that you are interested in whatever area they need the most help and say if you had to choose one that you're leaning towards backroom. it's a lot less hectic and a lot cooler than running around outside considering it's summer now
Target,39ubrx,CrUz_clan,3,Sun Jun 14 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"Backroom will be by far the better choice. Even though it is a heat box (at least in my store the br is always hotter than outside), you are able to get in a rhythm and get a lot of work done. Just make sure you move fast and learn the tricks of your backroom from more experienced team members"
Target,39ubrx,SanltarYNAPkin,5,Sun Jun 14 23:24:06 2015 UTC,"Been a cart attendant for 3 years now and just about to turn in my 2 weeks soon. My advice would be to do backroom if you don't want to work outside and clean up the bathrooms/front lanes. Being a cart attendant can be really easy, though it does depend on your team since with my store, as long as you do everything at the end of your night, they usually don't care what we do. However, the days where it's 100 degrees outside suck."
Target,39ubrx,Homerdw321,3,Mon Jun 15 04:46:47 2015 UTC,Four years in perishables here. You will work hard at either one - but definitely backroom.
Target,39ubrx,lockwasher,2,Sun Jun 14 23:32:22 2015 UTC,"cart attendant for a little over 3 months now. I liked the freedom the position gave me, and I don't mind the stormy weather and rain when I work.   Now my storm reworked the position and it got s little tougher, but I still feel more independent than most in store tens members. I love my GSTL and GSA's Amon the front end tho and all the cashiers, so that makes my job a lot easier.   Ultimately tho I'd go back room. Less stressful and you can still have that feeling of freedom because there's less guest and manager interaction. :)"
Target,39ubrx,spearmintnickers,2,Mon Jun 15 06:04:10 2015 UTC,I've worked both in a high volume store. I enjoyed cart attendant more because there's more to do and you have less oversight over you. Backroom does get paid .50 cents more but I found the job extremely boring
Target,39ubrx,vPikajew,2,Tue Jun 16 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"I've done both and both can be difficult work. Both also have their advantages. I vastly prefer backroom mostly because it decreases your interaction with guests and management. Also, the backroom maintains a more comfortable temperature than the parking lot year round."

Target,39ryif,spearmintnickers,3,Sun Jun 14 05:34:00 2015 UTC,"Usually about a year, although I have seen as little as six months. Depends on their limit, spending habits, and probably a few other variables."

Target,39rd7v,roysgame,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:54:22 2015 UTC,Target generally doesn't do recycling.

Target,39nwz9,DavidF122,4,Sat Jun 13 13:35:52 2015 UTC,"They did it at my store as well. Our STL was great and our numbers were always very high. One of the best stores in our district and definitely top 3 in the highest grossing. Then they fired him and brought in someone from outside the company. We have no idea why because he was doing great. But he had been with us for a while, so we were guessing it had to do with his pay."
Target,39nwz9,whiskey-monk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:19:38 2015 UTC,My TL is on the verge of getting fired as well.  He's the flow TL and he easily does 30% of the truck (including back stocking). I don't know anyone who doesn't like him except the DTL and and STL.  I'm fairly confident our store would go from being the top in our distract to last if he was fired
Target,39nwz9,SanltarYNAPkin,-3,Sat Jun 13 16:59:54 2015 UTC,Why was he fired?
Target,39nwz9,dubblechzburger,2,Sat Jun 13 04:02:15 2015 UTC,"""It's no secret he was fired because he was the most senior Team Lead, and therefore was the highest paid TL in the store"""
Target,39n76n,colebs105,2,Fri Jun 12 23:03:42 2015 UTC,"Our entire store is okay with TM discount on top of price match.  The ETLs either just don't know enough to know it's incorrect or just don't care and the TLs just don't care.  10% off is a joke of a discount as it is; we might as well be able to stack with with the competitions more reasonable prices.  Target has gone so far downhill in terms of team members benefits in order to save money, the little bit we're saving on price matching is hardly unethical.  EDIT: I should add, I'm only referring to the TM discount stacking with price match.  I agree with disallowing cartwheel and Target coupons on top of price match.  Cartwheel deals are usually just marking items down from their regular price to that of the competitions."
Target,39n76n,zieen,2,Sat Jun 13 00:02:27 2015 UTC,In one morning Huddle I asked if I could do that (I was still somewhat new) and all my TLs looked at each other and basically said you couldn't.  What's funny though is my team trainer said (in that same huddle) that you could and that he's been doing it for a long time haha.
Target,39n76n,BarrelAgedBudLight,2,Sat Jun 13 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"how it works is..  apply discounts first via, cartwheel or team member then if price is still higher then you can price match, which literally means you cant.  you can price match +manufacture coupon.  but you cannot match price+cartwheel or pricematch with target coupon and manufacture coupon,"
Target,39n76n,sorelameoh,2,Fri Jun 12 23:23:19 2015 UTC,"I remember when Price Match first started they mentioned you could not. Have had lots of people ask, so I looked in the handbook. Sorry. It's a picture of the screen, but this is straight from the handbook.   http://imgur.com/1irghxR"

As far as not doing it I think it varies. If you run into a hardass on the rule they won't do it but almost everybody at my store would do it. Hell I wouldn't stop anyone. The way I see it (I'm sure Target differs) is when we price match, we're still getting the same price a guest would at price matching. It's not like it's an employee exclusive thing. So why the hell not use the employee discount, it's supposed to be a benefit to working there that the every day guest doesn't get."

If your store was breaking carts this frequently, I can guarantee you other things were breaking.  Most the carts I see broken, if not a result of high winds, is due to cart attendant neglect or inattention.  Things like ramming carts together while the child seat isn't folded down correctly tend to wreck things.  Not that I'm completely blaming cart attendants here.

Target,39jnsa,iJeffwuh,2,Fri Jun 12 07:24:15 2015 UTC,"As someone who was on the bench for TL and decided on TPS, I suggest TPS. BUT I would only suggest TPS if you are going to a good store with a good ETL-AP and preferably a team. Advancement in AP is getting harder. They removed the Senior TPS position and are all over the place with APS positions. They have always made a lot of changes to the TPS position recently.   With a good etl, you should have support with advancement. There are always APS positions to move up to, especially if your store has one.   Also. TPS is a great gateway to TL positions. If 6 months down the road, you decide you want to make more money and get out of AP, AP is a good department to help show your leadership skills.  Let me know if you have any more questions."

Target,39h77y,PSIwind,3,Thu Jun 11 18:15:27 2015 UTC,"you will get a second. as a TL we never say you will get a second unless we plan on giving one. when we know you won't get a second we will say something along the lines of ""ok thank you you will hear from us by email in a few days"" and leave it at that."
Target,39h77y,LeChiotx,2,Thu Jun 11 19:49:54 2015 UTC,"Just wait. If they say there's going to be an interview, there will be. The store is probably busy, and they just need to find time to sit down and schedule the interview with you."
Target,39h77y,TheNewThirteen,2,Thu Jun 11 18:19:58 2015 UTC,"I was never given a phone interview. They just called to schedule an in-store interview, it's actually tomorrow. Quite nervous."
Target,39h77y,Socony,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:51:06 2015 UTC,"No phone interveiw? You must have some good background or they really need people, don't be nervous :)"
Target,39h77y,CrUz_clan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:19:14 2015 UTC,Actually I just came back from it. It went pretty well imo but they said they'll call for a second interview on either Monday or Tuesday so I don't really know.  Also I don't have much have a background so they must really need people
Target,39ctq0,xxbearillaxx,3,Wed Jun 10 22:16:05 2015 UTC,"I would have stories prepared to answer the following questions:   Tell me about a time you genuinely connected with someone (or tell me about a time you provided amazing guest service by connecting with someone, if you have a retail-related answer) Tell me about a time you changed a negative situation around with your positive attitude   Also, have a introduction ready that briefly goes into your work history and some personal details, like what you do in your free time. It should ideally be about a minute long.  TPS has recently transitioned into a more guest service oriented role, so all your answers should reflect that you would go above and beyond to provide amazing guest service. Especially because, as a veteran, they'll likely already know you have the chops for the AP part. But for the AP part of the role, mention how guest service both drives loyalty and therefore sales and can ensure profitability by reducing stealing (by maintaining a visible presence in the store while helping guests.)"
Target,39ctq0,anyquestions,2,Wed Jun 10 23:17:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, I really appreciate it."
Target,39ctq0,dromnomnom17,2,Wed Jun 10 23:25:09 2015 UTC,"Don't take it. I just started as TPS  a while ago and hate it. You will be lucky to even get a blue security shirt. I'm going on working two month as a TPS and still am wearing red and khaki. 95% of my job is guest service, pro actively assisting with guests questions and helping them find things. Some stores I'm not even allowed in the AP office. Its doing counts, guest service and standing at the doors. If you're looking for a guest service/greeter position take it. If you're looking for an AP job, look at Walmart. I regret not going with them."
Target,39ctq0,dromnomnom17,3,Thu Jun 11 02:11:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like the tps' roles vary quite a bit depending on the store. At mine, the tps helps me run the cameras while I'm on the floor, assist in apps, and doing merchandise protection. We do ask them to talk to guests and to spend some time at the door, but I wouldn't say it's even the majority of what they do."
Target,39ctq0,fetalbeetles,0,Thu Jun 11 02:40:06 2015 UTC,Just wait till your APML or APBP update you guys. You probably have an old school ETL-AP.
Target,39ctq0,fetalbeetles,3,Thu Jun 11 02:42:08 2015 UTC,"We've gone through the tps reinvention. Most of the things that it changed were things the tps was normally doing anyway. Just a little bit of added paperwork. Our apbp is the one telling them to focus on the ap side.   Maybe its a little different since we have a ton of activity, but I haven't noticed a huge change."
Target,39ctq0,CandyLips89,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:47:40 2015 UTC,"When our store went through the change we lost 3 TPS over 7 months. By lost I mean they left because it wasn't an AP job anymore. Ever since Tina took over as AP Executive VP and Gregg Steinhafel was replaced as CEO, it seems Target is very unsure of what to do with it's AP teams. So in the mean time it is all guest service. And with a ex-Sam's Club CEO taking over I would not be surprised if standing at the door becomes common practice. What does your TPS do in your store?"
Target,39ctq0,CandyLips89,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:23:20 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, how long have you been in AP? Swings like this happen frequently across all retailers with their stance on security. It's just another low point before the swing back up.  Tina Tyler was never the VP of Assets Protection. Cindy Hudson had the job from 2011 until just the last 60 days or so when she got promoted and Amy Petzgold (I can't remember how to spell her name) got promoted.  Since 2011, Target's shrink has been reducing or steady year-to-year. Once that happens, they cut back on AP. Over the next few years, shrink will go back up as a result and they will dumb more money into AP.  Target AP is still once of the strongest in the industry. The resources that they devote are incredible. Yeah, they aren't promoting Sr. TPS right now, but a lot of what you've been mention are no more than store/district wide. Come over to region 400. The AP director Oscar is the shit and is all about external and internal results at all levels"
Target,39ctq0,CandyLips89,0,Sat Jun 13 07:02:59 2015 UTC,"http://pressroom.target.com/leadership/tina-m-tyler  ""Tina was promoted to lead the stores organization in January 2011, and in 2013 assumed responsibility for Target’s assets protection team."""
Target,39ctq0,anyquestions,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:11:44 2015 UTC,"She assumed control of it as EVP of Stores. She's the 2nd in command at Target. Before 2013 AP reported to its own SVP. That's like saying STLs report to Brian Cornell.  While technically true, it is several steps removed"
Target,39ctq0,vtsaltydogg,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:25:48 2015 UTC,How much do you get paid? If you do not mind me asking?  I will look in to Walmart as well.
Target,39a6h4,awkwardkatie,4,Wed Jun 10 10:40:01 2015 UTC,"Current-C. It's in a sort of beta stage right now, and I personally don't feel like testing it."
Target,39a6h4,TheNewThirteen,4,Wed Jun 10 13:38:50 2015 UTC,It's called Current-C. Something like you can scan items w/ cartwheel discounts and TM discounts and then have the cashier scan a barcode on your mobile device and it rings everything up.
Target,39a6h4,rh51too,2,Wed Jun 10 17:37:15 2015 UTC,"You will need a Work email to access it right now. Signed up, but haven't played with it yet"
Target,39a6h4,Isak922,2,Wed Jun 10 16:32:50 2015 UTC,"I dont remember what the app is called, but a lot of my coworkers have already started using it. Everyone says its more frustrating than worth.   Also, has everyone told you guys that everyone is eligible for gold card status at Starbucks now?"
Target,39a6h4,Besnasty,2,Wed Jun 10 16:39:12 2015 UTC,Do I just go up there and ask for one?
Target,39a6h4,LemonApples,2,Wed Jun 10 17:26:40 2015 UTC,I have only seen it on the app.
Target,39a6h4,Besnasty,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:55:36 2015 UTC,Log in to work bench. It's under headlines. You enter a star code and then log into your sb account.
Target,39a6h4,monkeyman80,2,Thu Jun 11 14:10:46 2015 UTC,Do you have any details about this? I haven't heard anything.
Target,39a6h4,anyquestions,4,Wed Jun 10 18:32:35 2015 UTC,"I don't have them right off, but ill ask tomorrow. I just know that my TL said that target has rolled out a thing where we all automatically got upgraded to gold cards if we want them. I'll report back tomorrow if no one else posts with the deets"
Target,39a6h4,Besnasty,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:57:08 2015 UTC,"Man, I hope not. I worked hard for my gold card"

Target,399fpq,IamMysterion,4,Wed Jun 10 05:21:30 2015 UTC,"My store has a goal of 69 REDcards per week. We've been pushing for in the 80's, and for Back-To-College, our actual goal will be jumping into the 80's."
Target,399fpq,Isak922,2,Wed Jun 10 12:59:33 2015 UTC,"Our goal is 32 a week, and roughly 30% of sales are paid with RedCards. We're already pretty high in the district, but it's still kind of a focus for us."
Target,399fpq,TheNewThirteen,2,Wed Jun 10 13:37:39 2015 UTC,My store has goals of 140-150 a week. Lately we havent been meeting it but we usually do
Target,399fpq,vPikajew,4,Wed Jun 10 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"If that was our goal, everyone at our store would be fired. But that's awesome you guys are doing well!"
Target,399fpq,vPikajew,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:46:25 2015 UTC,Actually our ETL has been on us lately about not meeting our goal! We used to go upwards of 160 a week but we've barely been getting 100
Target,399fpq,Jsin14,2,Wed Jun 10 16:01:55 2015 UTC,"No, because the answer is obvious: more."
Target,399fpq,RomulanBacon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:40:06 2015 UTC,"Remember not everyone is approved with the credit card, so that number is a little high."
Target,399fpq,slenderwin,2,Wed Jun 10 07:41:55 2015 UTC,"I think the contract we have with whatever company that makes them is probably for applications, not necessarily cards themselves. Some stores in our district are getting an astronomical amount of them, but only 8% of their total sales are with RedCards, but yet they get praised. Over 20% of our sales are with RedCards and we have to sit in on conference calls every Friday because we're barely green WTD."
Target,399fpq,RomulanBacon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:23:55 2015 UTC,I feel you... 40% of our sales are with REDcards...but that metric does factor in to your goals.
Target,399fpq,Fr0stSoldier,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:58:34 2015 UTC,This!! We are at 19ish every week and our newer stores are at 8% penetration. Its malarky!
Target,399fpq,blazenx,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:00:46 2015 UTC,Have to remember that the goal is often a lot higher than 8. At my store its often in the 20s
Target,399fpq,doxxmyself,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:23:40 2015 UTC,Our district  goal is 77 per week... But our stl says every week  we get 100.... free pizza.... we've had pizza 2 times since feb...and last week we had 99...so close
Target,399fpq,SoulCrystal,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:37:50 2015 UTC,"When we switched from conversion to a regular number, our goal is now 78 a week, and apparentely that number should never change throughout the year. Our RC sales are around 13%, with about 10k transactions a week"
Target,397ugp,ljaxa,2,Tue Jun 9 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely like to read that, yes!"
Target,397ugp,anyquestions,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:52:08 2015 UTC,"There are STLs that don't care anymore or have become disenfranchised with Target.  They have to be 'performanced out' just like everyone else.  The problem is, I doubt most of them even know what Reddit is."
Target,397ugp,zieen,2,Wed Jun 10 05:57:52 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a former STL would be willing to share? I never see the STL in our store except when the DM comes. Maybe the nitty gritty won't come out in a ""day in the life of"" account, but even a concept of how STL's spend their time would be of help. Though maybe an anonymous rant about the pressures and challenges of being an STL could be a good outlet for someone..."
Target,397ugp,UtopiaInProgress,2,Sat Jun 13 17:32:00 2015 UTC,I work sales floor and see our STL occasionally walking around and checking in/chatting with the LODs/ETLs/TPS. She's pretty new so she's trying to make a good impression on everybody. We all like her pretty well; she's straightforward and will tell you when you're messing something up but she can also be pretty laid back. I feel like a lot of what she does has to do with being a limb of the district (ours has 8 stores) and making sure that our store is in the green.   Being an STL though probably includes sitting in your office and looking at numbers for the most part. Idk. I'll report back when I'm an STL next year.
Target,3977on,target0311250,3,Tue Jun 9 19:24:50 2015 UTC,"Does this mean I'm fired or is there an error?   Could actually be both. People can get accidentally set to terminated status in the system. We see it in the CSC every once in awhile when somebody calls in and ask for a password change and their status says terminated. Our policy is that we never tell them that their status is the terminated, we just don't change the password and instruct them to contact HR.  If the ETL-HR doesn't know what's going on with your account then you will want to contact the team member service center hotline. The ETL-HR should have the number."
Target,3977on,ferlessleedr,3,Tue Jun 9 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"What happened to my numbers? ""We hit the wrong button and accidentally fired you...sorry"" lol nice"
Target,3977on,zieen,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:23:20 2015 UTC,"MyTime isn't exactly the most user-friendly system, nor is it without its fair share of bugs.  I wouldn't be surprised if they accidentally clicked on the wrong person while terming someone (or some other error) and your profile was termed instead."
Target,3977on,suckersponge,2,Sat Jun 13 17:29:56 2015 UTC,"Yup, this. It's something that happens occasionally. At least occasionally enough that there's a form to fill out for termination errors. Your ETL HR should be able to recognize when this happens, if they can't, then they don't know how to do their job, lol."
Target,3977on,Yield88,3,Tue Jun 9 20:29:08 2015 UTC,Do you have a reason to be fired?  They can't fire you without giving you a reason so definitely seek this out.. I've been in TMSC and heard HR say 'whoops just fired [Sr TL Replenishment]' so it must be fairly easy to do. Go to work on your scheduled time and talk to the LOD. They can't stop you from working if they haven't actually been fired so don't stop asking people until they resolve it or give you your term papers.
Target,3977on,cbosch12,6,Tue Jun 9 23:15:28 2015 UTC,One of the best calls I have taken at the CSC was an ETL-HR calling and saying she termed herself. She was good humored about the whole situation but accidental terms do happen.
Target,3966kz,luminosity99,6,Tue Jun 9 15:21:03 2015 UTC,"I would check your email. When you get job offered, HR has to put an orientation date to even start the background check process. You'll get an automated email with an orientation date once you clear. I would definitely call the store too, just to be safe."
Target,3966kz,suckersponge,3,Tue Jun 9 17:53:34 2015 UTC,"You'll have to go through orientation before your first 'official' day. They usually want to have at least 4-5 people in orientation at once, so they might be waiting for a few more to be hired before getting an orientation group together. It's ok to call the store and ask what the status on your hire is, just don't inundate them with calls. Welcome to the team!"
Target,3966kz,TheLadyGeek,2,Tue Jun 9 16:35:43 2015 UTC,"Orientation is considered their first day, but everything else here is pretty spot on."
Target,3966kz,suckersponge,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:54:28 2015 UTC,No harm in calling and asking. It shows that your looking forward to working. Also thats HR's job.
Target,3966kz,zieen,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:21:44 2015 UTC,"It's not completely uncommon for your background check to get lost in the system.  Whatever magical place they send it up to for approval may have just missed it or whoever is in charge of their orientations may be on vacation.  As others have said, I'd give them a call and ask for an update on when you'll go through orientation."
Target,3966kz,target_slave,-5,Sat Jun 13 17:35:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they like to fuck you over for that first week before they hire you.  You probably still have a job though.  It takes a while to go through because they're retarded."
Target,393h15,scudle,19,Tue Jun 9 00:02:54 2015 UTC,I guess a former employee trying to shoplift.

Target,393h15,conniem1973,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:33:40 2015 UTC,"I just talked to another store yesterday, they reported a bunch of missing myDevices.  Apparently there was somebody going around to the stores in their area stealing the damn things out of carts that were unattended.  If you can open them up, then you've got an iPod Touch that a) won't set off the sensors at the door and b) is easily wiped at any mac or PC and sold to a pawn shop or on ebay, craigslist, whatever."
Target,393h15,Croweslen,7,Sat Jun 13 20:17:14 2015 UTC,That's some crazy shit. I hope you find out he works at another location and catch him. Send his pic out to all the stores in your area.
Target,393h15,Croweslen,7,Tue Jun 9 00:15:11 2015 UTC,"Sooooo he decided it was little pay, went back and did it for free?  Man of the people!"
Target,393h15,Croweslen,3,Tue Jun 9 16:04:00 2015 UTC,Yep that happens. We had a subject last quarter who impersonated as a team member. He got apprehended tho.  Would u mind if i asked what district this was in? Welcome to the ap world btw!
Target,393h15,niggerfaget666,2,Tue Jun 9 16:27:43 2015 UTC,We were actually wondering if it would be a felony for impersonating a team member and came in with the predetermined idea to steal
Target,393h15,50ShadezofWILL,2,Tue Jun 9 02:50:57 2015 UTC,Doubt it. Only law i know of is that you cant impersonate a police officer or federal officer. Or anything that they have to have a license

Target,394qwn,cody2isdown,10,Tue Jun 9 06:33:20 2015 UTC,"Your post is kind of confusing, unless there's some back story I'm missing. Did you requisition something that was expensive?"
Target,394qwn,dmillerw,2,Tue Jun 9 07:16:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, that definitely would have been goood information to add.. i pretty much always had a case of redbull for the entire food team in my department. Which equaled to 300$ a month apparently."
Target,394qwn,retromike,11,Tue Jun 9 07:33:48 2015 UTC,So what were you recognizing if you always had the red bulls on hand for them?
Target,394qwn,dmillerw,2,Tue Jun 9 08:44:11 2015 UTC,I kind of had this same thought. . I was trying to calm down in the hr office and grabbed a water out of the mini fridge in there... how is that any different?  I realize water is cheaper... but how is that any different?
Target,394qwn,robman1123,6,Tue Jun 9 09:46:01 2015 UTC,"Did you have explicit permission from your STL? That's the biggest thing. Recognition is usually for one or two TMs, maybe a couple times a month. Not a constant thing.  Otherwise, they could've viewed it as stealing."
Target,394qwn,robman1123,3,Tue Jun 9 15:28:32 2015 UTC,Yea.. that's kind of what im thinking happened.
Target,3924i7,BreNikkole17,7,Mon Jun 8 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"No worries, the POS tells you how much change to give back. Don't let the constant hounding of the redcard get to you. Just don't take the job too seriously!"

Target,3926af,SortaFlyForAWhiteGuy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:07:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Target is a pretty easy job. Dont stress it! For your problem with change, the computer tell you how much you have to give back, so it shouldnt be too hard. For the most part people use debit/credit cards so you wont even have to worry about it. You're given a couple of weeks without getting hassled into getting red cards/stay green in checking people out (you get scored based on how fast you check people out (red,yellow,green)),so use this time to get more comfortable with the register.   I'm a bit confused as the whole thing behind salesfloor/cashiers because almost all salesfloor positions require you to be able to help the checklanes if it gets too busy, so I think they might have you doing softlines(where the clothes are) or hardlines (where the rest of the stuff is at and just ask you for backup when they need it. I could be totally wrong though! Feel free to shoot me any questions."

Target,39145t,zieen,3,Wed Jun 10 23:49:34 2015 UTC,"Same thing at My store, no fix yet. I think they recently updated the app and it's hopefully just a bug"
Target,39145t,FroRage,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:37:30 2015 UTC,"Happened in my store.  The issue was that no one performed the updates to the MyDevices.  Eventually, the old version just stopped working.  Reinstalling MyWork through S.A.M. should resolve any issues.  If it doesn't, call CSC and have them troubleshoot it with you.  I'm yet to run into an issue with the MyDevices that could be resolved by a CSC specialist."
Target,39145t,zieen,2,Mon Jun 8 15:40:05 2015 UTC,"They have been nothing but trouble since my store got them last year. Everyone, even the LOD's and the STL constantly complain about them. The recent update to the app makes them more helpful, but thats when the bugs don't make them unusable. They either log people out every 5 minutes, even if you are in the middle of using them, or simply refuse to scan which sucks when you're trying to pull from the back with them. I really hope they are working on fixing them."
Target,39145t,bchris24,2,Sat Jun 13 17:39:15 2015 UTC,Mind sharing what app and how you are pulling with them?  It would be very helpful! Everyone at my store said you can't and we still use the old PDA's for pulling.
Target,39145t,tourettesFUCK,3,Mon Jun 8 16:43:48 2015 UTC,"I guess it's possible not every store has the ability to do it yet, but using the My Work app you can both store and pull from the backroom.   To store, you scan the item you want to put away. Then you scan the backroom location you would like to add it to, then it will prompt you to enter how many you are storing, and done. When looking at the backroom locations for that item with My Work, it should now instantly show the location you just added. Unlike the PDAs which took a while to update the new locations.  To pull from the back, you scan the item you want to get. Then go to the backroom info of that item and to the left of the locations, it should say ""Take."" After hitting take, it should prompt you to scan the location you are pulling from and how many you are pulling. When that is done, just like storing, it should be instantly updated to show fewer items in the back, or if you pulled all of them it will say ""no items in back."" Thats how you know it all worked right.  At my store, the backroom team still uses PDAs since you cannot access any batches with my knowledge on the my device, only ones you have created. However my store has already instructed the sales floor to start pulling on their own since it is so much more simple using the my device. But when the damn thing doesn't want to scan, it becomes a pain."
Target,39145t,bchris24,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:19:35 2015 UTC,Are you talking pulling batches or just pulling in general? Because it can definitely pull single items.
Target,39145t,dubblechzburger,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:56:07 2015 UTC,"SUBT.  PULL / batches / autofills won't be added until later this year, or more likely sometime in 2016."
Target,39145t,zieen,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:49:54 2015 UTC,I don't have that problem. The problem I do have is that the scanner will only work once. And then I have to close the app and reopen in to scan the next item. It makes reshop hell.
Target,39145t,TateFormTarget,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:40:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if the update has been deployed everywhere, but our MyDevices now make a ding/tone when you go into MyWork to tell you the scanner is enabled.  It's all software issues, so far as I can tell, so it will eventually get better.  Most the time it stops scanning, you can just turn off the screen and turn it back on, wait a few seconds for the tone, and then scan.  If it never makes the tone, you can try force closing the app, but I usually just restart it (power + home button)."
Target,38yln9,Davetek463,3,Sun Jun 7 23:10:53 2015 UTC,"I was hired for Target when the store was not open as well. They were making calls and hosting orientations and training from the next closest Target, and then a few weeks before opening they had a temporary number of their own."

Target,38y398,ljaxa,10,Sun Jun 7 20:46:28 2015 UTC,"The chances of you jumping straight to STL without extensive retail management experience are so low that they're effectively nonexistent. They place you into an ETL role based on their needs, but if you have any say in your position, try to get ETL Logistics or ETL Store Operations as they're stepping stones to STL more than any other. As StrOps is usually a position existing ETLs are promoted into, ETL LOG would be your best bet."
Target,38y398,anyquestions,3,Sun Jun 7 21:31:31 2015 UTC,"Gonna second this, in many stores ETL Logistics are basically the STL's right hand man."

Target,38y398,blazenx,2,Tue Jun 9 02:49:21 2015 UTC,They will definitely not look at an intern for an STL position right out of college. The quickest story that I have heard from ETL to STL is two years. Being in logistics also helps speed the process because you see the store on a global scale and learn the most.

In your answers, try to be global, don't just focus them around your own area. As a Senior TL, you will be running the whole store at times.

The lanes have been backed up a lot lately and with hour cutting, there's not many salesfloor people to back up.  I shake my head and head to clerical to wipe my head off and take a bit of a break (hot outside and I sweat like a pig).  It's then that I learned that it was backed up because the registers were down because the lights blinked.  I didn't see it because I was outside and didn't hear the walkie chatter.  They came back up, but it didn't take nearly that long.  Probably about five minutes or so after I came back inside.  I can't imagine 45 minutes.  We would have had people walking out."

Target,38m99n,UtopiaInProgress,3,Fri Jun 5 07:33:11 2015 UTC,"Sr TPS here. It really all depends on your store. Some stores are very strict about TPSs not being in the office much at all while others are more lenient. Depending on your store, you might not get the chance to learn your cameras, which will hurt when you are trying to catch a case or assist your APS/ETL-AP in their cases. Whenever you get the chance, practice on following people on camera. It's not gonna be the biggest part of your job, but it's a good thing to know so you don't lose visual of a subject during a case.  Build relationships with the other TMs. They will be the ones to look out for suspicious activity and make call-outs for you. You are only one person in a big store. You need them to help you out.  Expect to see a lot of shoplifters walk out the door with concealed merchandise. There's nothing you can do about it if you don't have all your steps. Don't expect to have all your steps very often. The TPS position is not focused on AP anymore. It's focused on Guest Experience. Basically, you are the face of AP without doing much AP-related things. (This also depends on your store)"
Target,38m99n,CandyLips89,3,Fri Jun 5 15:33:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the info! I've talked to a few people and they all said my new store is a little rough cause its in a more ""urban"" area.

Target,389t1z,luminosity99,5,Tue Jun 2 20:41:13 2015 UTC,"When I first started, another person who was in the same orientation as me had a similar situation. He was going to be going back to school at the end of summer, but wanted to continue working for a Target near his campus. To my knowledge, he was able to get a transfer simply by talking to HR about it and letting them know the situation. But it all depends on the other store actually needing a transfer, too. If possible, maybe look into Targets near the city you're going to be moving to and see what positions they're hiring for; if they have a lot of openings, it probably won't be a huge deal to get a transfer.   That being said, I probably wouldn't bring up the transfer situation in your interview. To them, it would be easier to just hire somebody else rather than train you and then transfer you. Just work hard for the ~2 months that you're there, and then when the time comes to ask for a transfer request you'll have some good will built up and management will know you're someone worth keeping in the company, even if it's not at their specific store. They'll be a lot more likely to put forth the effort into getting you transferred if they see you as a good employee.   Most importantly, don't feel too bad about potentially only working there for a short term. I can think of 5 or 6 people off the top of my head who literally worked one or two shifts on our team and then never showed up again. Retail has a pretty high turnover, so the fact that you're even concerned about only working at a store for a few months bodes well for you and your work ethic. Just show up on time and do a good job while you're there and hopefully the rest of it works itself out. And even if it doesn't, there'll be plenty of other similar paying jobs where you're moving to."

I'm an APS at a high theft store. The two TPS's don't have time to just stand at the door all the time. We always have stuff going on, and cases to write up.   Some stores are different and want the TPS on the floor 80% of the time. It just all depends."

It was pretty fucking lame and I had to be there 80% of the time. But now, with the Routine Cards, I barely spend any time at the door. I spend most of my time around the store, completing my routines. Neither way makes it feel like a real AP job. It started off being that I was basically a greeter and now I'm a greeter with a list of shit to do that include sales floor TM routines like zoning. It's hard to see the TPS position as anything but a misfit in a uniform. We are not AP, we are not sales floor TMs, we are not greeters. We don't fit into any single role."

Target,381cp9,bullycharacter,2,Tue Jun 2 02:37:40 2015 UTC,From what I know some Targets may ONLY offer jobs for 90 days at certain points.  It depends on how many people apply and how many people they need.  So...leave after 90 days and probably nothing bad will happen.

There's a website I always recommend people check out, google ihatestarbucks and it will pop up. Its a forum for employees to talk. It made me the badass barista that I am.  I hope your training goes well, I know at our store our new hires tend to just get thrown into things and are pretty much left to learn as you go. You will love it, just remember to not get over whelmed and flustered."

Target,37uz90,suckersponge,2,Sat May 30 17:28:16 2015 UTC,Approximately 2 weeks. It depends on your availability and how quickly you learn. I've certified people in one week and others in two.
Target,37uz90,_tournesols,2,Sat May 30 22:25:31 2015 UTC,"At Target we don't believe in training.  Expect maybe 15 minutes of training, or a few hours if we think you're too stupid to understand."

Target,37ncvt,piefe,4,Thu May 28 22:18:11 2015 UTC,open availability (8a-10p) will go a long way
Target,37ncvt,mtphisher,3,Thu May 28 23:26:19 2015 UTC,"Taking some time off should not be an issue. It should be one of the first things you mention when first getting hired. Sometimes they will ask if you have any long vacations planned in the interview. It just depends. Unless they ask, don't mention until being hired. Then talk to HR. Target is pretty flexible. They hire during this time of the year for that reason.   As for availability. If you're applying for cashier, sales floor, dayside back room, etc. The 8-10pm availability will be great. There are other teams (flow, early morning back room, etc) that work during non store hours. If you apply for those, make sure you have those hours open. I put ""anytime"" as my availability.   As for references. You don't need too many. Just find some good family friends, former co workers, or volunteer coordinators. Target doesn't typically call references."
Target,37ncvt,iJeffwuh,1 point,Fri May 29 09:13:30 2015 UTC,"So I shouldn't mention the vacation in the interview unless they ask? Do they care about taking off some time within the 90 day period once someone is hired?  Beyond that, what's Target's policy on holidays? I'm assuming they don't let people take off, but if someone cannot work on Thanksgiving day, would that be ok if you give fair warning."
Target,37ncvt,iJeffwuh,1 point,Sat May 30 20:14:52 2015 UTC,"It can all depend on the leadership in the store, but typically they don't mind as long as you give proper notice, which will be explained in orientation.   Target cares about attendance. Showing up to shifts. If you call out too much or don't show up to work when scheduled and not calling. Those are the things Target cares about.   Also r holidays. There are some ""black out"" weeks where you can't request days off. It's mostly the week surrounding thanksgiving and Christmas if I recall correctly."
Target,37ncvt,helpyoufindsomething,1 point,Sat May 30 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"My Target was good about giving me the days I need off when I got hired, it was no issue. They'll probably ask you about it during your interview.  I'm new to Target myself, but at my Target, open availability is a big deal, and they consider open availability midnight to 11:59pm. This is because sometimes they schedule people to come in at 5, 6, or 7, and sometimes they need people to stay late, and at Christmas time most Targets are open late. I put 6am-10pm as my availability on my application, but changed it to open availability during my interview so 12am-11:59pm."
Target,37mmdc,Hoofbite94,27,Thu May 28 19:06:51 2015 UTC,"It's been 3 hours since you posted this, how many red cards have ya got in that time?"

Target,37mmdc,sorelameoh,6,Thu May 28 19:48:22 2015 UTC,"The good news is you aren't the most underpaid position in the store. That's the cart attendants. Unfortunately, GSA is probably right behind that.  It can be a tough job, but it can be fun. If your ETL-GE isn't a psycho about Red Cards or you have cashiers that are great about selling them, it's not a bad position. I liked it, but there was an unspoken understanding that I would keep the equipment working if they didn't bother me about harassing the cashiers about Red Card. I was also fortunate to have take the position shortly after the breach.  Understand now that Red Cards are probably going to be a large part of your job. If you're okay with that, I don't see any problems with the job (aside from subpar pay)."

Target,37lrux,Rilo12,1 point,Thu May 28 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"No harm in trying! When items get repackaged, everything should still be there and in working condition. Repackage just means that the package was open and the merchandise had to be put back in. Go to guest service and explain the situation, I bet they will let you!"
Target,37lrux,dubblechzburger,0,Thu May 28 18:39:57 2015 UTC,"Second this, I'd definitely explain it out and try. Depending on who you get they might let you do it if you're nice and upfront about it. Because like rilo said, for repackaged items everything is supposed to be there, especially electronics items. Our service desk team calls us over on higher value electronics items like cameras and were supposed to check it and make sure everything is in there."
Target,37lpcu,manicuredyard,10,Thu May 28 15:15:17 2015 UTC,"Backroom. They get paid a bit more ( 1 dollar higher than base pay), and you dont have to deal with guests. I would also think that you get more hours as backroom than cashier."
Target,37lpcu,Fr0stSoldier,5,Thu May 28 16:31:29 2015 UTC,"Everyone (except logistics) is trained to be a cashier (if your sales floor, you're trained on registers before training on the floor).  You're not worth much to spot.  Also yes, you'll get hounded for red cards by your GSTL.  It's extremely repetitive.  However it's also easier than the backroom.  I work day side backroom and yes, it can be stressful, especially on weekends or the days a truck comes in.  It can also be easy though.  Your most important task will be completing the CAFs on time, and this is where the stress comes in.  If you're left alone and know you can't complete the CAFs within the hour, you need to ask for help or the backroom will go to hell depending how many of them rollover.  That said, you'll be able to work independently, without someone hovering over you.  Also the pay is higher (backroom makes 50 cents above base/cashier/sales floor).  As far as hours go, I think you'll get more in the backroom because you're not as easily replaceable.  Backroom is one of the hardest work centers to learn.  You can be cashier trained in an hour, backroom training takes a few shifts.  Regardless of what you do, cross train, cross train, cross train!  I was originally sales floor, got cross trained in backroom, moved to backroom regularly, and now I'm training in Instocks (another area of logistics).  You'll get more hours, and be a bigger asset to the store.   Also here's what you'll be doing dayside Backroom:   Dayside Backroom involves: 1.) Pulling the CAFs at the top of the hour 2.) Backstocking merchandise that TM's send back and flow leaves behind 3.) Completing Flex Fulfillments (things guests ordered online for in store pickup) 4.) Pulling batches for instocks and other empties 5.) Pulling sales plans and pogs (At some stores the BR TMs don't pull these) 6.) Pulling items for team members to help guests 7.) Run the baler, make bales, setting the line for the morning/flow team 8.) Pulling price change (clearance items) batches    A lot of what the backroom does is timed, the CAFs and Flex Fulfillments in particular. Flex Fulfillments are easy to complete by the time limit but the CAFs can give you trouble sometimes. You only get one hour to pull a set of batches before the next hour drops. If you don't complete them in time, shit can hit the fan pretty quickly.  You'll work alone for most of your shift & can generally listen to music."
Target,37lpcu,adamb10,2,Thu May 28 15:33:02 2015 UTC,"Just to add in, depending on the store, you might not have to do flexible fulfillments. Our backroom has zero to do with them unless it's in the backroom hold and guest service needs them brought up. Team Leads do it at my store, even if it's just in the backroom."
Target,37lpcu,dubblechzburger,4,Thu May 28 19:12:41 2015 UTC,I have worked at target as a cashier for almost a year now.  At my store the world revolves around red cards.  The stress of having to sell red cards is  ridiculous. O and dealing with the jerks you get Every now and then... Excuse me did you get my FIVE cent bag discount?! A lot of people are nice and a lot of people are not.  Being a cashier at target is pretty much a fake it to make it job. What the other person who cashiers was saying about only asking about red cards when your gsa is around.. Ya that's great and all until your lods start doing what mine are.. They are now sending secret shoppers through people's lanes to make sure you ask every single guest!  They don't care if the guest is buying a candy bar with pocket change... You better ask them about the red card.  Believe me any area is better to work in.  I moved to the service desk just to get away from the red card madness! Unfortunately we have to ask there too now.  When a person is trying to return some shitty item that didn't work for them I have to try and sell them a red card.  Makes me feel like an asshole.  DO NOT BE AN ASSHOLE!!
Target,37lpcu,heathermarie45,2,Fri May 29 15:49:45 2015 UTC,"i've been working as a cashier for about a week now and honestly it is the easiest job i've ever had. if it is busy the time really flies by. the register does pretty much everything for you, a monkey could seriously operate it. it's repetitive work but (for me) not stressful at all and guest interaction can be pleasant/add some variety. as far as redcards go, if my gstl/lod is nearby I always make sure to ask the guest. the thing at my store is so many of our customers already have them. if the gstl is not nearby i usually don't bother. i've gotten two cards in my first week, it's really not that difficult, kind of a luck of the draw thing. so far at my store i haven't seen any of the gstl's hounding people too hard to get cards. they will usually just mention it to us once when we hop on our registers. again, i've only been doing it for a week so who knows what may be coming down the road, but so far it's easy as hell."
Target,37lpcu,bullycharacter,1 point,Fri May 29 03:27:31 2015 UTC,"Been in the Backroom for almost 9 months now, personally, it's the easiest job I've had and I've worked at a radio station! Basically you just pull items in a timed manner and backstock whatever comes back. Sure, sometimes you'll end up working alone but it's not a big deal if you've got you grouping down. I can't say much for sales floor because backroom is where I plan to stay lol. Anytime I'm on the sales floor I imagine how many idiots the cashiers have to put up with and that alone makes the backroom all the more appealing, no customers whatsoever!"
Target,37lpcu,th3_r3al_d3al,1 point,Sat May 30 06:08:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this is too late, but Backroom.   I've been backroom for over a year now and what adam said is pretty much the way it is.   It is a little stressful, but it's not bad once you get down a path that you plan to take each hour for pulls.   The real problem in backroom is when it gets backed up. If the team cannot keep up with backstock, it begins to pile up and there really isn't much you can do about it during the day hours since you are doing nothing but pulls.   Then you're moving carts all over and shit can get annoying very fast.   Nonetheless, there is no real guest interaction (except for the one random person who sticks their head into the backroom to call out for assistance once and a while...) and your day goes by super fast."
Target,37ji6k,vito741,2,Thu May 28 02:06:04 2015 UTC,"I went back after a month or so due to a new job not panning out and my process was pretty much handled by my old team lead who really wanted me back when I mentioned it. I didn't have to do a drug test (our store rarely does them anymore anyways) had to do the interviews. The interviews were pretty much a formality but you still have to give decent answers since they document. As far as pay, you need to get reinstated rather than rehired or something. Basically my ETL HR and STL sent the request into either the District HR or Corporate HR dept and we had to wait on that before finalizing the job offer because if it got declined I would've gone back to base pay."
Target,37ji6k,dubblechzburger,2,Thu May 28 19:02:37 2015 UTC,"Don't take my word on this, but I think there is a time period where pretty much everything stays the same if you come back. I think it's 30 days.   If you left on good terms (didn't just walk out or call out.) and you know the leaders like you, it should not be an issue.    I think if you come back within that 3 months, you will get your old pay, team member number, etc. I might be wrong though."
Target,37jt3d,shmittay,2,Thu May 28 03:33:07 2015 UTC,"Electronics TM of four years and current E+E trainer at my store:  During busier times of the year, we've had cashiers with higher conversion rates assist in Electronics, some of which have been minors. It helps develop them as better TM's, and takes pressure off the electronics team.  Your mileage with this may vary store to store though."
Target,37jt3d,Isak922,1 point,Thu May 28 17:08:06 2015 UTC,"Like the other guy mentioned, it'll be easier to once it's busy and they could really use the help. We recently had a similar scenario where someone at the checklanes wanted to cross-train and hopefully switch but she was only 17 and the problem with that is she can't close. And we don't even get enough hours to have mids right now so there'd be no one there for the last hour. And while it's not a big deal during the summer but when school rolls around, most minors can't start until 4 due to school and the opener is usually gone by then due to them getting there before store open.  It could work if they really want you over there but that's why they are probably a little hesitant."
Target,37jt3d,dubblechzburger,1 point,Thu May 28 19:07:05 2015 UTC,"Just ask for cross training. Most HR will be happy to oblige to cross train you, but since electronics is technically hardlines it might be a bit before they slot you in for any type of training there, especially since it's totally out of the front end workcenter."
Target,37jt3d,AMBocanegra,1 point,Fri May 29 04:03:03 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't be an issue. The only issue is electronics team members usually close and some states have work curfew for minors, but should be okay. I have seen plenty of minors work in electronics."

But usually one of the SL team leaders or the shoes brand TM will have another set of jewelry keys with them for when they need to respond to the call button. But other than that it's used for storage and to lock up some of the newer, better sign holders."
Target,37etry,Adlair,3,Wed May 27 21:37:38 2015 UTC,Jewelry used to be a specialized position at N09 pay.  That kind of specialty got ripped out years ago and from there the department has gone through considerable reduction in size and hours available.  There used to be a jewelry brand team member in the softlines roster but I don't even know if that position even exists anymore or if its just been rolled over into the generic softlines brand.

Target,37a8ae,ignitusmaximus,1 point,Wed May 27 02:33:15 2015 UTC,"I think that definitely depends on the store you work for, and what part of the country you're in. My store definitely offers pay higher than you'll usually find for a first job.  Not something you'd want forever, but definitely better than a lot of your other options."
Target,37a8ae,icavedin,1 point,Wed May 27 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"lol.. I second that. Our store starts at 9 now, used to start at 8. As an additional note, I always tell people target is the best job to have while in college because of availability, hours and LOA flexibility. I couldn't have chose a better first job at the same age."
Target,37a8ae,siiberiia,5,Thu May 28 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"Sounds exactly like me when I applied last summer, except I had minor experience opening/stocking a local store a few months prior, and delivered newspapers.  Being a good place to work is a definite yes - in the end Target is still just another giant retail chain, but their ideals are very heavily focused on the guest and their experiences in the store, rather than making sure they have the lowest prices ever. Low prices don't mean much if the guests don't enjoy their time at the store. They also emphasize teamwork over everything else - a store is one large team working together, not just employees running around places.  Enjoying the job as thoroughly as I do, I think will depend more on the management in your store. My store in particular has only 1 person in the entire staff who I don't get along with, and even that's on her end and not mine.   Cashiering is about as simple as you can get in the store, and a great place to start. Target overall is a great place to start working in until you get to a point in life where you can move on with a full career of some sort later on."
Target,37a8ae,FrozenPhoenix95,2,Tue May 26 05:03:24 2015 UTC,Very well said. Thank you for your input. I'm more inclined to work there now!
Target,37a8ae,Shadow51585,2,Tue May 26 06:42:04 2015 UTC,"I have one year at Target as a Backroom Team Member.   Target for me is a good place to work. I enjoy working there. That being said, Target is and always was intended to be a short term solution. They are a good company to work for in a reasonable environment.   In backroom, we are largely independent, but your store is indeed a team and every single thing depends on team members fulfilling their role. Target is extremely focused on this, and it really does work. Don't go in treating it as ""some lame job to do for a while"" and you will definitely get a lot from Target.  A word to the wise from working there and for having family in Target for nearly 20 years. Future jobs take Target experience seriously and if you can show you had a good attitude there and developed leadership skills with them, they will look upon that favorably in a multitude of professions."
Target,37a8ae,Riot_Officer,1 point,Tue May 26 07:09:05 2015 UTC,I'd  say target is definitely a great place to start working at 19.

I started off as a cashier and worked my way into getting trained in almost every department until I decided to stay in Electronics for awhile. I recently got promoted to GSA and I enjoy it.

Target,379htk,zieen,5,Tue May 26 12:15:08 2015 UTC,"Veteran team members were hired in a 'different economic climate', or something like that rubbish.  Target has no interest in retaining long term team members. Our store is projecting something like 75% turnover and it's not exactly a high priority trying to right that.  I'm aware there isn't much that can be done at store level and there's next to nothing that can be done on a higher level.  Target is going downhill fast.  I expect unions to start popping up or another retailer to start gaining on #2 as Target stores start to get worse and worse as they're understaffed and unfocused on the importance of logistics and team morale."

Target,379isf,Ladybird310,9,Mon May 25 23:43:59 2015 UTC,"Instead of saying ""all stores are not the same"" throughout this post, I'm just going to give advice as if it were for my store. If you're not in a year-round beach store like I am, Ready-to-Wear might not be the monster it is at my store because you don't get swimsuit traffic, etc.  My softlines breakout (in order of difficulty, hardest first) is 1) Ready-to-wear 2) Boys, girls and infants 3) Shoes and intimates 4) Men's and activewear. Whoever will be doing the hardest dept comes in earliest (RTW at 4:30) and the easiest comes in latest (Men's and active at 6-6:30). Obviously put your strongest people in the harder areas unless you are trying to performance someone out; put a bottom performer in RTW and the resulting nightly zone will be a PDD handed to you. When they come in they go to the fitting room for their assignment, along with grabbing their strays. Between shoes/intimates and men's activewear, whoever is done first will go over to accessories.  The task of openers will vary based on the dept's needs. Maybe they need to audit mannequins (make the outfits on mannequins more obviously available, change mannequins out if you're heading into a weekend and you don't have enough of the mannequin clothes to sustain sales, etc.) Maybe the closing team left basics for last and it's a disaster (to ensure this happen, at 10PM every night, my team hits basics for their respective depts.) Maybe it's zoning/working out jewelry. Maybe it's running strays from the night before -- which is usually the case. My mids exclusively run strays unless something else big comes up that needs to be addressed. In comparison to hardlines, softlines gets MASSIVELY more strays, so my dayside team is essentially there to guest service, do the occasional pickup if an area gets shopped hard, and to ensure that my closing team isn't overwhelmed with strays so that they can get a decent zone in.  Closers are there to zone, and run strays. Coming clean on strays and with a good zone is ideal, but your success on that will vary with the strength of your team. When my closers come in, they do a zone of the outside of their area (to maintain brand and have the area be inviting to guests --> driving sales.) Then they move through their area from one end to the other. Some closers will kind of bounce from bad area to bad area: strongly discourage this! That strategy makes it really hard to see at a glance where they're at in their zone, which is important so you can (1) see their pace and (2) determine if they're falling behind, so that someone from one of the easier areas could help out when done.  Fitting room is there to process rewrap and salvage, sort strays and check guests in and out of the fitting room. Rewrap and salvage should be done as it comes in; rewrap should then go immediately back with the right dept's strays, and salvage should be condensed and then FR should regularly call a cart attendant over to pick it up. Strays should be sorted into the dept's 3-tier for folded and z-rack for hanging. A huge part of sorting strays is for them to sort it by brand according to how the dept flows! If RTW moves from Mossimo Red to Mossimo Black, the strays on the rack should be sorted that way. Having the RTW TM sort the rack after FR has already ""sorted"" it is double work, and a huge waste. FR should also walk the fitting room every hour to check for empty packages.  Also remember that softlines much more than hardlines is a juggling game. If, at 8PM, you feel like you're doing better on zone than you are in strays, shift your focus. If you have any other questions, let me know."
Target,379isf,anyquestions,3,Tue May 26 11:34:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I think part of my store's problem is staffing. The V.P. HR says that we don't need closers because MyTime says we don't need anyone past 10p (when our store closes at 11p or 12a depending on the day.) So often we will only have 1 or 2. And when that also means no cashier closers, those team members often spend half their shifts on the registers...  When I first started, my first STL wasn't too concerned with payroll. He let us schedule according to what we felt we needed. Then I could have a few openers who did details, some mids that worked reshop and zoned less shopped areas, and closers for full zoning of every area. We used to have around 5-6 closers. The other night, I was the only closer in Softlines, and I had to cover GSTL breaks, Fitting Room breaks, and respond for backup. It doesn't allow for much time to zone.  I average 9 full shift team members total for an entire day now. Usually if I have more people than that it is because several of those shifts are only 4 hrs long. Our temporary STL (this is the 3rd one I've been through in 3 years) is then telling HR to cut hundreds of hours each week even after payroll is green... I just wish I could get District to see that getting Softlines back together with so few hours is not possible. Instead, the blame is falling on me and my supervisor."
Target,379isf,anyquestions,2,Tue May 26 13:45:20 2015 UTC,"Rofl. No closers? One closer? That's completely and utterly unworkable. I could go into detail, but it sounds like you already know much of what I'm going to say. Your leadership is the problem :/"

Maybe see if they can cross train you in places like hardlines or plano and you can be scheduled for that too. I'm an electronics employee but get scheduled for 40+ each week because I can work 3 other departments. It's only getting busier as the summer roles on so expect the hours to go up.  As for electronics it's the best place to work even on a bad day. No backup cashiering calls and pulls are much less than other departments."
Target,378yk2,Smokeeye123,1 point,Mon May 25 22:28:24 2015 UTC,This whole post exactly. If you are good (and cross training in other areas will certainly help) you will get 30-40 hours. And electronics is a great spot depending on the store. It might be different since mine's not directly across from toys (seems a lot of people's electronics dept. on here are) so you really don't have much to do outside of electronics. My store wants us guest servicing in front of the boat at all times so they only bring us pulls/stray if it's really slow or they are really fucked. And I've only seen us back up cashier like once in the last year or so.  It's probably one of the more laid back spots in the store as long as you are decent at getting attachments/service plans
Target,378yk2,dubblechzburger,5,Tue May 26 03:20:17 2015 UTC,"This depends HEAVILY on your senior team lead and executive team lead, and how many people they think are necessary to run their area. Less people is more hours, but also could mean less coverage on the floor. Different people will hire different amounts of TMs.   We have 3 full time electronics team members at my store, and one team lead that works on and off back there during his shifts. They all get pretty full schedules and get catered to their availability."
Target,378yk2,AMBocanegra,3,Mon May 25 22:26:27 2015 UTC,It depends on how many electronics team members there are and how well you do on the job.

About 3 months later, I received a rebate check from Target, and when I checked my UnitedHealthcare account page, it showed a discount was applied to services from Target clinic. So there is a discount if you use your HSA, but I don't know what it's supposed to be (mine was about 50%), and they don't know how to do it so you might get a rebate check later. Take your UnitedHealthcare card if you have it, maybe it'll help them bill it correctly?"
Target,370lou,mardish,3,Sun May 24 02:38:06 2015 UTC,"You got a discount because Target Clinic is in-network for UHC and has a contract that limits what they can charge, not because you used an HSA. This amount can vary, but I've frequently seen it in the 40-50% range. Target offers the Choice Plus plan, which doesn't have copays but does have a deductible and an out of pocket limit. Typically, you'll visit your doctor and they'll bill your insurance, who then pays part or all of your claim (or none, in certain situations). You'll then get a bill for the patient responsibility. Sometimes doctors don't do this correctly or insist that you pay upfront, and in those situations you'll usually get some kind of refund. To me, it sounds like you paid the non-contracted rate, then they submitted your bill and UHC paid for some/all of the claim, and then the provider (Target Clinic) refunded you whatever amount they received from UHC. The amount UHC will pay varies based on your deductible and out of pocket limits, and how much you've met. It also can vary if the provider isn't in-network, but Target Clinic and also their pharmacies are always in-network for TMs (and probably most people with the Choice Plus plan).  source: UHC employee."

Target,370lou,ferlessleedr,3,Sun May 24 06:43:50 2015 UTC,"She gave 0 medical information. She asked how were the costs and how was the service. And if you are referring to the info she might give if she chose to go there, that would be ridiculously illegal for the clinic to share any of her info especially with anyone who is in charge of firing. I'm sure target is happy to have her use their services and take care of her health. Take off your tinfoil hat."

There also tends to be more hours available to flow team members, since if the truck isn't finished on time or there's backstock leftover they tend to have people from flow stay for extra time to get it finished."

You will have a highly irregular sleep schedule. Dayside will usually revile you for leaving them so much backstock even though you tried so hard to get all of the truck put away. You will also hate dayside for leaving you so much backstock. Chances are you will be a very bitter individual.  The shift differential pay is very little these days, so I'd turn down a flow job if you have any better options whatsoever.. That said, they did just get a base pay change like all of Target so the pay isn't awful.. You'll just be sleeping whenever your friends might like to hang out."
Target,36ud3t,TornadoChaser9,7,Fri May 22 04:50:39 2015 UTC,"Well, there is a reason the survey  is supposed  to be annoymous.  So that you can give an opinion without the fear of retribution.  However,  depending  on your workcenter and demographics it is possible they could guess .    As far as post survey goes,  I  have never seen any real change let alone a discussion  of issues.  For my store, all we get post survey is the results of the top three  opportunities.  Which  for 8 years running have been,  recognition, communication and accountability.  Third one every so often gets exchanged for money.   My point is, that if your store is anything like mine, don't expect much and you can't be let down.  If you have issues,  take them up with your ETL-HR( behind closed doors) they should be able to at least listen to your concerns.  They may not be able to help but sometimes  being heard is enough.    I  wish you the best,  and I  hope this helps."

Target,36ud3t,theycallherdeath,2,Fri May 22 11:42:36 2015 UTC,"My ETL-HR actually created a guide towards the most accurate results for the Best Team Survey. He was really excited about it, too (he's excited about everything, but whatever) - the guide helped clear up some questions, reworded them, gave examples, and emphasized that if you don't know something or a question doesn't relate to you, answer ""I Don't Know"" instead of ""Neither Agree Nor Disagree""...like questions about the direction the District Team Leader is going in - when you're a simple Team Member like me, the stuff my DTL does really isn't a huge deal to me, I just make the store look good and drive sales.  ANYWAY, I've heard the Best Team Survey has made actual changes in other stores (getting rid of bad STLs/ETLs is a big one I hear about)...but honestly, if you're store is on a scale from ""meh"" to ""pretty good, actually,"" you're not going to see much change."

That decision is so far above your pay grade it's not worth the stress fighting about it. You know it, the scammer knows it, it is what it is.   I've only seen one person denied returns. And that was over an extended period.  As long as we don't know they literally picked the item off the shelf and want to return it or we have other ap notes we have to take their return. What we can do is limit. We're not denying our guests but limiting our losses.   What kind of returns do you want to deny?  As to when to vibe each store is different. If your etl wants you to stick to one (best practice is 4) have her talk to other Etl's. Other Etl's might not care so much and say yes in situations like this. I'd be pissed for following my etl's policy and getting shit on by another etl. As long as it's a normal person I'll always say our policy is x, but I'll take care of you today. That usually gets a oh that's too bad but thank you."
Target,36q8fy,monkeyman80,1 point,Thu May 21 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"People dont realize it, but the service desk is where LOTS of fraud goes on, from returns where the person used a check, bought a BUNCH of cologne and are returning it 11 days later to get cash back. Or they used a bunch of manufacture coupons then try to return it to get the money back. At my store we are given the power to deny returns even if AP is not present, as long as it is within reason. If its plain and simple my STL, ETL GE, and GSTL do not care as long as we inform them after the fact. For instance you SHOULD not return a high dollar item that was bought a different store 30 minutes ago. Im 90% sure the system denies the return anyway, or you need the override code to proceed. If you dont empower guests services you might as well open all the registers and walk away, at least thats my opoinion"

Target,36q8fy,wonderman911,1 point,Fri May 22 03:10:24 2015 UTC,"Im currently the head trainer at my service desk, and we have had such a clusterfk of shit lately our ETL AP decided to issue new standards. 4 Gift Card cash out MAX per household, Items returned same day purchased by a giftcard in an attempt to break down a larger gift card from coupon/suspected fraudulent returns are to be voided and returned on the original giftcard, not a new one in attempt to cash them out. In the event an item appears unsellable inform the guest of this and that the stores policy says new and unusued items are returnable, this includes packaging (this is normally for stolen items, it's pretty obvious in the neighborhood I work at). If a guest provides an ID that does not look like them and they challenge you on this, ask them their birthdate on their ID, if they do not know it inform them they will not be able to do the return and if they further challenge tell them that your security officer or LoD will be able to come assist with the return. Also, CHECK THEIR EXPIRATION DATES. You do not have to issue a refund if a person is using an expired identification card, it is a ploy to cap that id number, and then get a new one and cap it out.  Also after saying all this, if you're a service desk tm, PLEASE REMEMBER TO CHECK INSIDE THE BOX OF ALL MAKEUP/ESIM, RETURN TO SALES FLOOR COSMETICS AND CHEMICALS. I have seen so many people return CVS/Walgreens/Walmart items with the security stickers A: Still on the box B: Pulled off and put inside the box (or placed there by smart AP officers at other stores).  That being said, the giftcard fraud and coupon fraud is probably what 40-70% of my day is. I've lost three good TM's switching off the service desk because of how backed up defectives get when 8-12 people come in together and all return $250 in stolen cosmetics that will all need to be destroyed and they get their max back on a giftcard and then attempt to break it down buying socks and baby clothes. Talk to your ETL-AP GSA's, if they're proactive about it and good at verbage they can figure out a way around the giftcard fraud. Ultimately it will still be a loss in product, but hopefully not cash from your cash drawyer, and if it is, it will be a lot longer of a process at $40 a day. Condering I have seen people come in with 70-80 cards, and say they will call corporate if I don't cash them out right away. Finally my ETL AP stood up to one of them, and the new policy came to fruition after he got over the regular customer service at corporate and talked to somebody real."

Target,36q8fy,why_try,1 point,Tue May 26 21:06:10 2015 UTC,"I looked into this same exact issue as a gstl, as my store was getting hit HARD by it. I brought up my state's  (MA) law about ""cashing out"" giftcards for cash. The wording of the law says the gift card needs to be ""spent in such that the value of the card is 5 dollars or below."" Meaning a fresh 5 dollar giftcard can not be cashed out, as no money has been ""spent in such"". This has deterred literally everyone who was doing this, atleast from coming to my store anyways."

Target,36nzbw,SweetGehenna,3,Wed May 20 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"You could do one of two things:  Look at the top of your pay stub.  Go to myTime self service and look at the page that you use to request vacation time.  You can use the hours any time you want as long as you don't work over your average hours for the week. If you average 25 hours a week and only worked 21, you're allowed to use 4 hours of personal or vacation."
Target,36nzbw,Yield88,2,Wed May 20 20:45:20 2015 UTC,It's in the MyTime Self Service part of eHR. I think if you look at either your schedule or if you go to request time off it will show your vacation/personal hours at the top of the page.
Target,36n4t2,bullycharacter,19,Wed May 20 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"I've been a cashier since late February, here's what I can tell you.   You're going to get hounded for red cards by your GSA's/GSTL's, there's nothing you can do it about it. It doesn't matter if you're good at getting them, they're still going to constantly ""remind"" you, and everyone else, to ask for them. If you get a few red cards in one day, you're the front-end hero. You'll hear your name called out on the walkie a bunch of times, and it feels good. If you're having a bad day, maybe even a bad few days, they'll probably talk to you and ask you if you're mentioning all of the benefits, the whole nine yards. You're going to get upset and take it personally the first time probably, it happens. The most important thing to remember about red cards is actually not to ask for them, but instead that shit rolls downhill. It may seem like your GSA/GSTL is hounding you and you only, but trust me, the GSA is getting shit on by the GSTL, and the GSTL is getting shit on by the ETL in charge of front-end. Accept this as fast as you can so you don't immediately hate your job. You'll learn really fast that the words red card will be burned into your mind. You hear it day in, day out. Regardless of the position you applied for in the store, be prepared to go all over the store if backup is needed. If you make a mistake as far as giving too much/too little change goes, or just a mistake in general, be sure you tell whoever is in charge of the front-end at that time. There's so much stuff that can get you terminated during your first 90 days it's not even funny. I'm not saying this to scare you, but admitting mistakes and showing you want to learn from them is a good thing. Everybody fucks up, so don't be scared, because you're going to fuck up. Just fuck up the right way, you feel me? Branching off of #3, if a GSTL isn't around to call for help, and your co-workers can't help for whatever reason, flick your top light on (it means you need help), and somebody will come... eventually. You just have to deal with people making faces until help arrives. Call-ins during your first 90 days are risky, so be careful. I'd seriously only recommend calling in if you're really sick or have a family emergency. If it becomes a frequent thing, it's going to look really terrible and you'll probably get terminated. In the training book I think I remember it saying not to ever double-bag items, but do it anyway. ""Vibing"" with the guests (making them feel like their presence matters) is significant priority, and telling a person you can't double bag their shit will only piss them off and you're going to get in trouble for not vibing with the guests. Branching off of #6, the guest is almost always right. Example - ""RIDICULOUS!! THAT RUNG UP $9.99?!?!?! IT SAID ON THE SHELF IT WAS ON SALE FOR $8.99?!! THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME I COME HERE"". Just change the price and move on. I'm pretty sure you can go upwards of $5 on guest price challenges, but after that, you'll have to ask your GSTL. In my store at least, after every credit card transaction that's at or above $50, you need the guest's last 4 digits on the card before the transaction completes and the receipt is printed. If this is the case at your store, get used to asking for the digits every time you see a person is paying with credit. Get used to checking the circular for items that will provide gift cards if a certain quantity is purchased, or if a certain $$ threshold needs to be met. People are obsessed with gift cards. If no one is at your line (early morning/opening shift, just a dead day, no guests waiting at other lines to call over, etc), make sure you zone your lane (walk through it and fix items that in the wrong place, pull them to the front if they're pushed back, etc. Just tidy your check lane up. If you don't do this, you'll get yelled at. If there's nothing in your check lane to zone, stand at the FRONT of your check lane (facing the direction the guests would come from), so you look presentable and ready to check out a guest when they're ready. If you don't do this, you'll get yelled at. When it comes to multiple items, use the quantity key or scan it for the # of times there is the item. For example, let's say a really skinny and short woman buys five heavy cases of water. It'd be pretty lame of you to have her lift up ALL five cases of water (unless that's your thing man, go for it), so you'd tell her to just show you the bar code on one of them, and either hit your gun's trigger five times, or scan it once, and then use the quantity key to change it to five. Being a cashier is actually so mind numbingly simple that I practically beg for red cards so I can do anything but be on the register. Hopefully you're the opposite of me, and if not, I'm just going to feel sorry for you starting now.  Unless you've been a cashier anywhere else before, you're probably going to be pretty slow. Don't worry, it doesn't matter during your first two weeks or so. If you're still slow after that, kick it in gear because you're probably going to get hounded for being slow. If you're getting hounded for being slow before your two weeks, just ask for help/how to improve, and just try your best. I generally ignored the G/R system (speed system) my first few weeks. I think I had like a 40/50% score for awhile, lol... and now I barely ever drop below the 90s. Everything gets faster and easier as time goes on. Remember that your 15 minute breaks are PAID, which means if you go over 15 minutes, you're going to get in trouble. During my first few weeks, I unknowingly took a 20 minute break (didn't have my phone/was outside), and I got into trouble practically as soon as I walked in because my ETL saw me leave and timed me, I guess. Just be careful, set an alarm on your phone or something. Get used to people being security/financial experts after you ask them if they're interested in signing up for the red card. I legitimately had a guest's point of reference for the dangers of a debit card sourced from CSI: Cyber. She told me to destroy my debit card as soon as possible.   Overall, working at Target is okay. If this isn't a career for you, and you're just doing it to pay bills for now, just keep that in mind. You'll get through the day."

If you're just cashiering, correct. TSC needs to save walkies and myDevices for people out on the sales floor. If your GSTL or whoever wants you to backup somewhere on the sales floor, you'll take a walkie.   how do we call the GSTL if we need help? are they usually nearby?   The GSTL's job is to pretty much be the eyes and ears of the front-end, so they should always be at the front-end. Sometimes they wander off and do who knows what, or you're all the way over at register #18 and you can't verbally call for help, so that's why you have the top light. Top light on = you need help.  Other than that, they're usually nearby and you can just verbally call for them."

Target,36n4t2,FrozenPhoenix95,4,Mon May 25 04:47:04 2015 UTC,"You should be asking every person for red cards. Have a set speech in your head of what you're going to say, and just say it. Definitely ask people who are using checks to pay if they know about the debit card. A trick my coworkers and I use is saying, 'Would you be interested in our target redcard that saves you 5% every time you shop?"" and when they say no you can say, ""If I told you it was a debit, NOT a credit card, would that change your mind at all?"" It gets them to rethink the option. :)  If they want multiple items on one gift reciept and another group of items on another, just put them all on one, finish the transaction, scan the receipt and print off more. It's easier than putting each single item into separate receipts.  You can put two 2 liter bottles of soda in one plastic bag. Same with the cartons of milk or half gallons of milk. Two per bag.  That's about all I can think of! I'll tell you more if I think of them while I'm at work, haha."

Target,36n4t2,spearmintnickers,2,Wed May 20 19:43:29 2015 UTC,"My approach to red cards is a bit different than I hear most people ask the guests. I usually ask, towards the end of ringing up items (gives you time to be friendly and work them up a bit before asking) ""have you ever considered signing up for the target redcard? it saves you 5% every time you use it"". If they shut me down on the spot, I usually just stop there. If they sound a bit hesitant, I'll go on to look at the final total and do some mental math to see what 5% would be for them. $400 order? ""Are you sure? You'd be saving $20 on the spot, and saving more every time you use it.""   I've had countless times where people change their mind once I put an actual number onto the savings they'll be getting. It gets them to listen and realize it's really not a bad idea, unless they're overly paranoid, or have a card with better cash back or rewards from usage (it's hard to beat those, so I usually don't bother at that point).   Don't worry too much about red cards, if your GSTL/GSA have any bit of a friendly side to them, they'll be happy as long as they know you're actively trying. It's their job (and their bosses job, and their bosses' bosses job, etc.) to push the redcards, so don't take it too personally."

New carpeting for the registers was just laid, and it looks to be moving quite well. We're also getting a full HVAC remodel this summer.  Our electronic stockroom is so small... it's impassable atm because of the remodel related backstock and purging to fill the new shelves. Makes hourly pulls pretty bad in there. And due to the remodel (and people NOT breaking ties properly), we have huge MM1 and MM2 pulls popping (500+ eaches per hour). It got so bad that we were told to let both roll every hour.

I'm talking about your cashiers and guest service tms because they are who you work with the most and they are the people who can make or break you. also understand that a GSA cannot coach or administer write ups, something one of my GSA  hates mainly because of redcard and vibe issues. ... my greatest advice is take it but do not let it be your end stage. make it very vocal you want this to be a stepping stone and a training tool to be developed into a TL. Either way the best of luck with whatever you decide! if you have any questions feel free to pm me."
Target,36k300,LeChiotx,2,Wed May 20 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"Ex GSA here- I was a GSA for two years at my location. It was fun, pays more, and management experience. If you get the position. Here are some advice:    Your cashiers are human beings and not a tool to be exploited your benefit. Just like you they are there to get a paycheck. I know was my job to push & push for red cards. Some cashiers are good and some cashiers are bad. If one of them is not good. If you have sales experience  go talk to them and advice them. Give them pointers. Also try to have good red card cashier next to an bad one, so the bad red card cashier can over hear some good ideas.  You are the defacto front lane manager of the store. If the GSTL or the Frontlane ETL are not there. You are in charge in dealing with customer escalations and issues. It's basically your job to prevent escalations to the LOD. If you are unsure how much empowerment you have. Ask the GSTL. My GSTL gave me tons of empowerment to make the customer happy. Also use that empowerment to reward your cashiers or CA. I was allowed to requistion some stuff under $5 dollars to my cashiers if they beat their Red Card goals. If your place has a Starbucks. If it's a cold and wet day. Requisition some hot chocolate or coffee for the CA.  If you are a closing GSA. You should be partnering with the Closing LOD. To see if they need help with straightening the sections of the store. If you have an extra cashier that is bored. Ask the LOD if HBA or toys need help.  See Spot Save: The BANE of every front lane. Have at least one cashier to be the main SSS person. To organize and flex SSS.  Also this is very important. Be a leader and not the person in charge. If lanes are backing up and you know there is no back up. Jump on a lane. If there is no cart attendant. YOUR the cart attendant. Some TLs are willing to watch the lanes for you so you can grab carts or even get them for you."

Target,36csi4,DannyDawg,1 point,Tue May 19 03:13:38 2015 UTC,"In order to process it as an AP internal you have to get APBP approval. I just don't see any APBP approving a merch internal that stole one $3 item one time. Typically there needs to be some kind of pattern established or depending on what state you live in, the dollar value needs to be over the minimum threshold for prosecuting someone (where I live it's $20).  If anything they would refer it to HR and they would go on some kind of corrective action and it would be closed as an HR policy internal."

I've been with the company for 5 years and at 3 stores; it is not a big deal (assuming you've learned your lesson), and it's unlikely anybody noticed. If they did notice, they will just continue to watch you. As long as you do not continue to steal, you will not get into trouble. I have accidentally pocketed misplaced items without thinking about it and then brought them home. Items that I would not even be interested in buying, like nail polish (as a male). I just brought it back the next day and threw it in a random re-shop cart. I've done that several times. I've done a lot of stupid stuff: forgot to requisition supplies, pay for food. What AP is mostly concerned with is your ""intentions"". Do you intend to make the company money or take from the company? If you intend to only add value to your store from now on, I do not think you should make a big deal of this by fessing up to AP. If you take care of this yourself, it is no big deal.

Target,364z2q,littlebirb,5,Sat May 16 04:46:09 2015 UTC,"You might talk to HR about it (or ETL-LOG/Flow TL), but it's not that bad. Most likely you'd be pulling pallets from the backroom to where-ever they needed to go, and then later pushing product to the shelves.  OR, actually, since you're trained in Softlines, you might be helping out the Softlines team with sorting/pushing (only done it once, but it was fun)"
Target,364z2q,dmillerw,2,Sat May 16 05:23:10 2015 UTC,"Unload is a pretty broad term, and that shift has a tendency to not be particular with which work center they schedule people in; they're going to shuffle people around to suit their needs, it's basically just a formality they go through to make sure they use their hours properly. So that's not a big deal, unless I'm misunderstanding and you were hired for softlines during the day. Then that's a huge issue and you need to talk to someone immediately cuz they done screwed up."
Target,364z2q,FenrirSM,1 point,Sat May 16 11:24:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was hired for softlines during the day and evenings although I agreed to cashier every once in awhile. I'll definitely talk to them about it when I go in next. The hours for that week are wonderful but its just a much earlier shift than I agreed to so it'll be much harder to make it to those shifts (they know my current vehicle situation.)"
Target,364z2q,maka5672,1 point,Sun May 17 00:27:07 2015 UTC,It's more then likely to push the softlines truck. No worries it's just like abandons( or reshop?) I think that's what most stores call it
Target,35wfu1,wonderman911,3,Thu May 14 02:04:10 2015 UTC,It only makes a difference if you worked there for less than a year or went more than a year before you got a review. (example: hired 2 months before reviews came and they didn't deem it necessary to give you a review for that year)  With that in mind lets say you worked there for 8 months and received a review that warranted a 50 cent raise. To determine your actual raise you would take .50 X(8/12) since you worked there for less than a year. Your raise would be 33 cents.  If you worked for more than a year before you received a review then it would be something like .50 X (14/12) 58 cents since you went longer than a year before you got a raise.
Target,35wfu1,sajey,2,Thu May 14 03:37:18 2015 UTC,"Wait hold on, I've worked at target since October 2013. But I moved stores for 6 months. So my raise is only for my time at one store?"
Target,35wfu1,MrKentucky,1 point,Thu May 14 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"Yours says prorate months: 12, so it's prorated for 12. I guess there has to be a value in that column."
Target,35wfu1,Besnasty,1 point,Fri May 15 00:08:59 2015 UTC,"That you haven't worked there for a full year, so your raise is prorated  Edit: At least thats what I assume that it means. I could be wrong"
Target,35vjai,panther09,6,Wed May 13 21:31:10 2015 UTC,Basically it's inventory. You go around the store scanning items to update counts and make sure that the floor is as full as it can be.
Target,35vjai,effervescence,5,Wed May 13 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm an instocks team member so I think I can give you a pretty indepth look at instocks. as /u/effervescence said, our job is to go around the store updating the counts of items. The way it works is we will go to an isle, and look for locations that have one on it or zero (this is called critical low or out, respectively). We would scan it, put one or zero, then move on. This is called Research. What we are hoping will happen is that the DC will see that we are out of that item and bring us some more ASAP. Obviously you can see where there might be a problem here, for example one of the items might be in reshop or unlocated in the backroom, or it could be in another isle due to bad zone. This is why I constantly ask the team leaders to tell me when they zone everything to POG so that I have the minimum chance of making an error. Thats basically the gist of it. There are more things that we do, but shooting in research is our main thing. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!"
Target,35vjai,Fr0stSoldier,2,Wed May 13 22:46:59 2015 UTC,"It's not that bad really. The only problem that I run into is that my pda stops scanning. Other than that, it's pretty chill. Basically, like they said you scan the items it tells you to and you put in the pda how many are there. Sometimes you have to scan whole sections of an isle for any items that are empty on the shelf. If you have some in the back, you make a request to pull it on the pda. After you are done, you push the items that come out of the back.   Here's a tip: I usually have to do batteries on the check lanes and it takes forever. It really helps if you learn how many batteries fit on one peg hook. That way, if you see it's full, you know right away and don't have to count them.   It's really cool I guess. Plus, when I get scheduled to do it, I usually leave at 1 or 2."

As for mydevice issues we feel your pain. A lot of the connectivity issues arise due to the simple fact you have 20 + my devices trying to connect to one access point which causes them to crap out  Secondly when they do crap out it corrupts the tcwireless profile which when it does poop out it prevents from my work and other my device apps from functioning and that's why you call us and we do the profile push and have you do the whole ""connect to target guest wifi 10x times)  As for my support gripes I feel your pain but at the CSC we have to follow different escalation paths and procedures so unless your issue is technical a lot of the time you will be referred too my support  It's not that we don't care it's that we literally have no info or knowledge or steps given to us to assess said issues and hence you get shuffled around like a red headed stepchild.  My advice is to call us directly since you will get your issue looked at much faster (please for the love of God don't wait a month to call us and say half of your my devices are stolen and or missing because I put you on hold rub my temples and ask how is it your ETL-AP have a job)  Lastly there will be an iOS update and also a patch to address wifi connectivity issues (we're working with Apple on it) so hopefully within the next few weeks.  We love you all were one family I feel your pain we do listen to you even if you think we don't.. We really do try.

And yes, they were sold together. I asked them to fix the reporting. They wanted the dates, times, and receipt IDs for the transactions in question which is something they have access to if they had actually wanted to research it."
Target,35qyah,anyquestions,1 point,Fri May 22 20:49:16 2015 UTC,"If they had access to find that information they would have just gone for it.  Not every team has access to InsidePOS to get this stuff, and not every team is familiar with all the systems either.  Kicking a ticket back to you guys at a store is a fantastic way to NOT get the ticket closed, and their metrics are based around how many tickets they closed.  So if they ask you for information maybe you should be helpful if you actually want the issue resolved.  tl:dr; help us help you."
Target,35ouja,rodsterStewart,3,Tue May 12 08:18:35 2015 UTC,"Ok I see. I plan on going into the my availability section in eHR today when I get to work, to see what exactly they have me under (because I do remember signing a paper that had me available most days).   The odd part is that next Saturday, they are putting me in hard lines even though I'm soft lines. I don't mind, really, but maybe something clunky is up with my availability that I'm unaware of. I""ll have to check it tonight.  I mean so far, they've put me in a few sections. Doing CAVs (I know soft lines don't do this, but something happened at our store, and they needed people), I""m doing cashiering today, and next Saturday I'll be in hard lines. As far as soft lines go, I'm mainly in the girls and boys department, and also infants, sometimes covering the fitting room, and doing call backs.   Anyways, as far as cross training goes, is that something I have to ask for? I""m not really sure what that is, but I do know it means they train you to be in different departments? or different job functions?"
Target,35ouja,indigoibex,2,Tue May 12 14:45:53 2015 UTC,"Sometimes softlines does have CAFs, at least at my store since they're partially responsible for infant hardlines.   Cross-training can be asked about, or if they find you to be a hard worker they'll train you in other areas which can help you get more hours. Cross-training is just training you to work in other departments (electronics, market, cafe, etc)."
Target,35ouja,ttott100,2,Tue May 12 15:15:10 2015 UTC,It is also very likely that you are getting low hours because you were hired on for softlines - it isn't typically a very hour heavy job when it comes to splitting the hours up between team members.  Once you get trained in cashiering and other areas of the store you can pick up extra shifts from the swap shift book.
Target,35ouja,icavedin,1 point,Tue May 12 16:21:31 2015 UTC,"After checking my availability on eHR, I saw that it said 12AM - 12AM for all days, so I went to talk to the HR lady to see if this was a problem.   I brought up the fact that my hours were kinda low, and she said it wasn't my availability, but more of a store wide thing. Where due to the time of the year, there isn't a lot of money coming in, so there just isn't work available. So it isn't only me who is being scheduled for low hours, but a lot of others as well. She went on to say that things would probably pick up sometime later, when more people would be coming in.  Anyways, maybe talking to HR was a good thing because I got a call today asking me to work on Thursday.   So suppose I'll just wait and hope for the best. I'll also need to ask about that swap shift book, since I've never seen it.   Thanks again for your help."
Target,35ouja,icavedin,5,Tue May 12 17:55:00 2015 UTC,"So everyone is giving you crazy different answers, but in my experience, with retail, especially in a store like target, hours are going to change with the seasons. Hours are dictated by payroll, which they are allotted based on sales for that time of year.  In the holiday season you will be tired of seeing red and white and in the spring time you'll be scraping by. You didn't mention your work center, but that will also have an effect on it. If you're salesfloor that means you can pick up both cashier shifts, and your work centers shifts, giving you more hours, and if you can close salesfloor, even better, as for scraping up hours.  Being on-time, offering to stay late, and making sure your HR knows that you don't mind being called in also helps.   (edit: formatting)"
Target,35ouja,anyquestions,1 point,Wed May 13 18:40:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the lady at HR told me exactly this.   So I'll sit tight and keep doing what I'm doing. I just got called in for Thursday, so looks like I'm doing something right.  Oh, I'm in a super center, and I only close. I was told I'd be hired to close. Not sure if this means they will only schedule me to close, but so far, that seems to be the case.  Also what do you mean by work centers? Is that like hard lines or something?"
Target,35ouja,Sunnystateofmind,2,Tue May 12 18:19:49 2015 UTC,"Getting called in and actually going in let's them know you're flexible which is always nice!  And yeah, work centers are like hardlines/softlines/electronics/market and then guest service and the likes"

Target,35ouja,SortaFlyForAWhiteGuy,1 point,Tue May 12 11:32:29 2015 UTC,It's an actual physical book that should be hanging around the time clock and/or HR. People write shifts they need to give up in there and you can write your name down to take the shift.
Target,35o5zv,scudle,4,Tue May 12 02:35:09 2015 UTC,"I went from electronics to AP. I started as a TPS and I am now an APS.   I assume you are applying for a TPS position? The interview is not too different from your first interview. Might even ask the same questions. Go in there with a positive, ""vibe-tastic"" attitude and they will love you. Target is getting really big on having TPS be about the vibe and stopping shortage in top shortage areas by being guest service orientated. Your expectations will be different depending on the store.   AP is a fun gig. You will like it. Sometimes can be boring depending on the location, but it's a great bridge to leadership in Target.   Here are some questions they might ask:   1) when was a time you dealt with an angry guest? What did you do?   2) when did you complete a task and realize you made a mistake. What did you do to fix it?   3) guest wants a pair of shoes. Your store is sold out. What do you do?   4) tell me about a time that you vibed with a guest?   5) tell me about a project that you lead? How did it go? What would you do differently?   There could be many other questions, but these I have seen the most.   I suggest prepping an answer for of these. Here is a good format to follow for just about any question.   When did deal with an angry guest?   Situation (explain what happened. Should be short)   I was working one evening and a guest approached me stating that we sold him the wrong charger for his phone. He was very upset and said that the tm must have done it on purpose to make a buck.   Actions: (should be the longest part of your answer)  1) I allowed the guest to finish what he was saying.  2) I apologized for the situation.  3) I told him i couldn't fix that it happened, but would like to help him get the right cable. 4) I asked to see his phone. I found the matching cable.  5) I opened removed the cable from the package and showed him this one was the right cable.  6) I walked him up to guest service to get the exchange going.  7) I also asked the GSTL if we could remove 10% from his purchase.   Conclusion (sum up what happened and the actions you took)   I realized from the start that the guest was upset. He was not too aggressive it just seemed like he needed to let it out. I really wanted to fix the problem for him, and he liked that I opened it up to show him that it worked with his phone. I wanted to turn this negative experience into a positive one. I partnered with the GSTL to make sure it was okay to take 10% off to apoligiZe for in the inconvenience. In the end, he was smiling and was happy with my service.   Hopefully these tips help. PM me if you have any other questions."

Target,35odgc,wtfitsrick,2,Tue May 12 04:42:53 2015 UTC,"I've never experienced this in my store, but it really doesn't sound brand or even moral. Most stores even go out of their way to tell you to not mention anything on social media about your job or store."
Target,35kl5v,ibrownied,7,Mon May 11 06:44:50 2015 UTC,"Personally, I was good friends with all of my TL's and was offered the position on a few occasions as well.  I talked to them about what they thought based on pay increase and they all pretty much said that it's not worth it.  It wasn't about the money, it was about the crazy insane hours and stress that come along with the position.  Also this was from two different stores, with completely different atmospheres, over a period of about 5 years - one being one of the model stores in the country, and one being one of the largest.  The pay increase wasn't worth the extra 20+ hours they had to work every week just to get their job done, and most weeks there was a lot of overtime they had to do but they'd still get yelled at by the STL/ETLs about the overtime.  My TLs regularly would regularly work 12 hours shifts. If they didn't then their jobs wouldn't be done, they'd get yelled at for not completely their work, but they'd also get yelled at for going into overtime.  MY TLs all got along with the STL and ETLs but corporate would still force them to talk to my TLs about their overtime anyways and warn them.  It really isn't about the money, if the money is worth it for all of that stress and the added hours then that's great - but that's honestly the real consideration."
Target,35kl5v,ttott100,5,Mon May 11 19:06:28 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking, most of our TLs don't hit OT(as far as I know) and we get everything done. That's what I'm debating, if it was something like $3-4 raise, then it would definitely be worth it to me. It would definitely keep me at Target for a little bit + it would just look really good on my resume, I know it would definitely add stress and cut into my social life, but thinking towards the future it seems like a good opportunity."
Target,35kl5v,ttott100,5,Mon May 11 19:13:45 2015 UTC,"I believe the national ""average"" for TL pay is around $15 an hour and you get full-time benefits. If it's something you are interested in then I would suggest sitting down with some of your TLs and asking them about the pros and cons specifically at your store.  Also keep in mind that TLs are heavily discouraged from taking time off since them being absent really screws everything up - one of the perks of being a TM is that if you're sick you don't really need to feel guilty for calling in, or if you want to go on a trip for the weekend you can without any pressure, etc.  Edit: You also need a degree to be TL, which they tend not to mention to you when they bring up the option. This may or may not effect your decision lol."

Target,35kl5v,Besnasty,1 point,Tue May 12 17:34:12 2015 UTC,"It might depend on the region but I doubt the company would allow that differences bw stores.

Frankly that is sooooo not enough. I'm up for another pay grade promotion but have to interview with the DTL and explain why I think I deserve one, which in fact is bull.   I do however highly suggest you take any and all advancement and development opportunities they offer.  1- may not be a lot but yes more money.  2- this right here the main reason: gives you something to add to your resume . management experience so when you do leave Target you can apply and start off in higher positions"
Target,35kl5v,munkymedic,2,Mon May 11 16:20:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I appreciate your feedback."
Target,35kl5v,Ladybird310,12,Mon May 11 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"Ran the backroom by myself most days, doing the 12-5 CAFs alone, 8.5 hours a day, 5 days a week including the weekend. Got a .12 raise. Don't work hard at Target, they won't care."
Target,35kl5v,Darikona,2,Mon May 11 18:35:21 2015 UTC,"I was a TM for 2 year and was promoted internally. I only made $12.11 as a TL starting out. At my store at least, you get paid less if you're hired internally, which is bullshit. It really wasn't worth it for all the stress that comes with the position. I've been a TL for 1 1/2 years now, and between merit raises, raises with reviews, and the $1 increase this year, I still only make $14.04."
Target,35kl5v,Croweslen,1 point,Mon May 11 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"Team lead start at PG 11 unless you really, really set the bar in the interviews.  So for a bunch of stores, that's about 1.50 to 2 dollar above base wage.  You can technically 'promote' up in the paygrade from there to pg 15 I believe, even 17 if you are in specific stores where TLs become key carriers (but not SrTl, that's another position all together).  Just remember, the higher in position you climb up, the more in the spotlight you'll be in.  And all it takes is a stick up your STLs/ETLs ass about metrics and scores and suddenly you being in that light is not so pleasant."
Target,35kl5v,monkeyman80,1 point,Mon May 11 23:20:40 2015 UTC,Im currently a senior tps in my store. I make more than most team leads at $15/hour. Im getting prepped for tl at the moment and i honestly have no clue what pay grade im at or what team lead goes up to but i figuring its at least a $3 raise at least. The best thing I would suggest is to talk to your etl-hr and see if they can fill u in. During the interview i would ask as well.
Target,35kl5v,cody2isdown,1 point,Tue May 12 00:32:16 2015 UTC,"tl gets set schedule and every other weekend off plus the few federal holiday where we're open benefits.  what was your review? o/ex/e?   it depends on store, but a tl is expected to be a master of everything. hey you're working and and gstl needs a lunch? cover it. that's a stress. you need to cover other areas in addition to your work load."
Target,35kl5v,cody2isdown,1 point,Tue May 12 01:39:03 2015 UTC,"I'm trained in every part of the store and my availability is open except Saturday nights, i got ex in my review."
Target,35kl5v,MK6SSSHIT,1 point,Tue May 12 06:24:02 2015 UTC,"As a team member I always got ex in reviews. Everyone wanted me in their departments.  When word got out I was wanting to promote every ETL with TL positions open was up my ass...   Now, as a TL I get no recognition. Receive IE's in reviews and literally cannot do a damn thing right. (Though my team would beg to differ.) My team loves me and we consistently beat sales, get green guest service scores and green steritech visits.   Honestly, if it weren't for my team members I'd be long gone by now. The ETL's just hold you at ransom, so to speak, once you promote."
Target,35lv2h,Ghostwoif123,2,Mon May 11 15:56:45 2015 UTC,"Not all Target stores require drug tests, if you needed to have it done you would've had to do it within 24 hours of being hired."

Target,35esbw,Bab5crusade,1 point,Sun May 10 15:27:02 2015 UTC,If you have personal time. Use them now. Also add personal time to previous weeks as well if you are under avg hours. You can go back 6 weeks I believe.

I dont really know anything about cooking or food in general and they put me there rather then electronics where I know pretty much everything besides the cameras.  I dont really understand why electronics gets a bump in pay when market doesnt.

Target,35cwwd,crazyassfool,2,Wed May 20 01:03:58 2015 UTC,The minimum wage where I live is about 9.15 In target atm. I live in Connecticut. After the minimumwage increase I got transferred to market which is a dollar more. Then I got my annual review of 23 cents.

Target,35cwwd,jordanimal,1 point,Mon May 11 03:10:45 2015 UTC,"Well that's a shame that you don't like market. It's my favorite department personally. At my store i would consider it the best department to work at. Great co workers, fast pace, and the shift goes by quickly on truck days."
Target,35cwwd,Iv2905,-4,Mon May 11 04:51:57 2015 UTC,"Well, hopefully you'll be replaced with someone a little more enthusiastic about their job.  I mean, I just started at target and was placed in consumables. I've enjoyed it this far, even if I am working my ass off. I'm just glad to have a job at all. I guess as with everything, time has a way of making everything leave a bad taste in one's mouth..."
Target,35cwwd,antileet,4,Sun May 10 02:05:40 2015 UTC,"The key words are ""I just started at target and its great""   Everyone felt that way when they started too. It isn't just a 'bad taste'. Target literally stops being so enchanting when you start seeing the motives behind the actions people make. I loved it when I started too."
Target,35cwwd,BestXhelatNA,1 point,Wed May 20 12:36:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The honeymoon phase of that job was over for me when I started to rationalize that I liked it because they were giving me a paycheck.   Target, before I left, left a bad taste in my mouth. No one wanted to do anything, especially the TLs that only wanted to dick around and lay blame on the lesser employees when things weren't done."

Target,3539mg,tarsinsight,5,Wed May 6 19:11:13 2015 UTC,PA is paygrade 09 while flow is paygrade 07.  This means you should make an extra 50 cents an hour.

Target,3539mg,hicsuntdracones-,4,Wed May 6 20:33:40 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it stands for Perishables Assistant. They work in PFresh making sure that the food isn't outdated or bad quality, and they help place orders for what's going to be sent on the refrigerated truck.   Also, I just now realized I don't know what the 'P' in PFresh stands for... Produce? Perishable? Pseudo?"

Target,3539mg,targetAccount,0,Wed May 6 22:53:45 2015 UTC,"I think your work center can be in consumables/Pfresh without you being a Perishables Assistant. You would just be focusing on CAFs and zoning within the food area, rather than general hardlines.   Of course, if you are doing PA work like QMOSing expired food, working with vendors, and making the refrigerated truck order, then you should talk to your ETL about getting your work center changed so you can get that PA pay bump. And if you're not already doing those things, maybe ask about being trained as a PA since you're already familiar with that work area."

Once you are TL they have some bargaining power,but for regular tm or lower pay grade specialty tms you will see nothing.  You might have more luck saying that the review was unfair and inaccurate, and due  to that you were given an improper raise.  Source: had to sit down with hr after being displeased with raise."

Target,34y0ta,walkofdoom,-3,Thu May 7 03:01:52 2015 UTC,Remember as a TM. No matter how good you are or tenure. You are nothing to them. Just like any hierarchical class structure. As an TM. You are just a tool to be used by the higher levels of management. Tools are not suppose to have any power to demand anything.  The only way Target would listen to you if you become an TL or organize your workplace into a union. Which both of them are hard. Target has been downsizing TL positions. Target has successfully using propaganda and fear to prevent organizing by the workers.

As for the fake enthusiasm, I don't understand.  I mean almost no one at store level actually benefits from getting red cards, unless you count not being hounded as a benefit. You know what they should do and what would get tons of people excited about selling red cards. Give the person that sold the red card a small percentage of the profit generated from that card holder. Like half a percent. Not a whole lot for target to give up, but enough that could add up and would encourage people to actually give a shit about selling the cards. Not to mention all of the other benefits of treating your staff well."

Target,34sfoq,agharta42,11,Mon May 4 04:07:13 2015 UTC,"Not to be a jerk, but we're honestly getting one side of the story here.  I worked for Target for 5 years and not once was someone fired for ""performance"" and had multiple write-ups that didn't deserve to get fired.  Write-ups and firings weren't really taken lightly at any of the three stores I worked at.  Saying that, sometimes even people who quit without giving notice can be rehired despite being put on the ""no hire"" list for the company.  Same goes for being fired, but is less likely since they usually fired the person for a good reason.  You just need to apply and then call and explain your situation.  If they are willing to take you for your word and give you a chance then they will, if they aren't then they won't.  Being honest is obviously your best bet though."
Target,34sfoq,ttott100,-4,Mon May 4 04:51:01 2015 UTC,"What I said is exactly what happened. Those were the reasons I was written up, and performance was the final writeup that got me fired. I never actually saw that writeup since it was so early when they gave me the papers and stuff, and I was sort of surprised and didn't ask to see it. I might have been lied to, I really don't know. What I said was all i know. To the person that asked why I'd like to work there again, the answer is because I'm having trouble finding a job and wondered if it'd be possible to give it another shot. I think everyone here knows that if you had a team lead that doesn't like you, and felt like it, they could conceivably write you up for pretty much anything, just to pressure you to leave. My team lead sat me down at one point and said to me, in essence, ""I don't like you, I don't think this is a good job for you, and I want you to quit. If you don't quit, some things are going to happen that I don't want to happen to you. It's up to you."" And I opted not to quit because I needed the job."
Target,34sfoq,marv3fan,4,Mon May 4 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"In this case it will probably be easier finding a job somewhere else. From the way you're presenting the situation, and how nonchalant you seem about the write ups, it may be time to look at yourself instead of at Target."

You need to log on to eHR, click on mytime self service, and it'll be pretty obvious where to go from there. Once submitted, it automatically gets routed to your leaders inbox but it doesn't hurt to tell them you have a request in there because, in my experience, they don't check it regularly.    If you forgot your password or are having trouble logging on, see your HR."
Target,34o7k5,not_a_banana,1 point,Sun May 3 00:05:06 2015 UTC,"This is a very good question to ask your HR person, or another ETL. It's literally their job to help you with things like this."

I always put it in the computer and then leave a written note for my TL on her desk to make her aware of my requests because the system is not always perfect and often the requests wont get communicated.  The only hesitation is that you are asking for July 4th off. I dont know if your store has a policy asking for holidays off, but you are giving them plenty of time to work around it."
Target,34o7k5,wonderman911,1 point,Sun May 3 14:57:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, July 4th is my main worry. Normally they put a sign next to the time-clock letting us know we can't request an upcoming holiday off; however, they haven't put a sign up yet for July 4th, so hopefully since I'm putting in the time off 2 months early they'll work with it."

Target,34o7k5,marv3fan,1 point,Mon May 4 17:58:35 2015 UTC,It will probably depend on your leaders but it sounds like you have a good attendance record and if you're a decent worker I don't see it being an issue. Especially if you talk to either the ETL of your area and/or the ETL-HR. Giving advanced notice will be a plus.

Target,34cq3t,VforNam,9,Thu Apr 30 02:29:13 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that simply being trained in these areas doesn't qualify you for a raise.  It's actually very common for TMs to be cross-trained for many different areas of the store. The majority of your shifts have to be specifically in those areas and then you need to officially swap to them before you will get a pay increase.  However, you might not even be able to switch because each area of the store has to fit into a certain pay budget so... ask about openings and possible cross-training you can do if you are interested in switching positions.  But in general, most areas in the store get paid higher than salesfloor/cashier/car attendant."
Target,34cq3t,ttott100,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:52:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, so even if I was trained in every department, I am only eligible for a pay increase if the majority of my shifts are in an area that qualifies for an increase?"
Target,34cq3t,ttott100,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:57:53 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge there is a required weekly amount of hours on average that you have to work in any given department before you qualify for it yeah.  HR can fill you in on the whole process of it, it's slightly complicated but they're usually pretty supportive about TMs wanting to cross train in general.  If you want to bypass the entire thing, you can also simply apply for a higher-paying position within the store just like when you applied for your job in the first place.  Talk to your TL or HR about wanting to apply and see if anything is open."
Target,34cq3t,ttott100,2,Thu Apr 30 03:02:07 2015 UTC,"Okay. I'm an electronics team member who has recently been trained in guest service, p-fresh, and bike building (since my review earlier this month). Was wondering at what point was I eligible... Now I know. Thank you!"
Target,34cq3t,conniem1973,3,Thu Apr 30 03:07:10 2015 UTC,"Yea, the best way to go about it would be to apply for one of those positions that gets a higher pay grade - Just mention that you're interested and if there are any openings they usually prioritize current employees over newcomers."

Target,34cq3t,nerhe,3,Thu Apr 30 03:11:18 2015 UTC,"Salesfloor, cashier, and cart attendant are the lowest paygrades. Any other position will get you at least a 25 cent raise.

Also, cross training doesn't get you a raise, however, if over half your shifts are in a any of those higher pay grades, you should be promoted but that's up to HR."

Target,34bl6f,k929,3,Thu Apr 30 17:47:58 2015 UTC,"Hair is a non issue to be honest. I've seen some people go in with shaggy hair and pull through. Just clean up yourself so everything is combed and sharp.   I honestly have never conducted interviews but from what I can remember, relax. They're going to ask you common questions in interviews.  ex: name a time you worked as a team to overcome a problem.  Why do you think you'd be good for this position(Know he position you're interviewing for. you can search this sub and find plenty of posts about cashiering, hardliners, electronics, etc.) Be ready to ask questions. I asked my interviewer what their position was. How long they'd been there.  Just try to connect with them because they're going to be the ones to green light you through to the next interview. When I've asked team leads and executive team leads(who interview newbies) what they look for, it's usually a first impression. Shake their hand before and after the interview, even if they're not a male! Firm grip.   Lookup ""Amy Cuddy Ted Talk"" on YouTube. It's a pretty amazing video. Watch it now, watch it before your interview."
Target,34bl6f,TheMaddy,2,Wed Apr 29 21:50:41 2015 UTC,"Awesome! That's good to hear. I'm expecting the common questions. Gonna go through all of them (I have a list I found somewhere) and make sure I have a good strong answer. I'm interviewing for cashier and sales floor. On the phone, she seemed a lot more emphatic on the sales floor position, which sounds to me like that's where they'd want to try and steer me if I get hired.  I'm seen the Amy Cuddy TED Talk. I definitely will watch it again before I go in. What was the whole process like for you? Are there multiple interviews? Is there anything I could do to speed up the process besides just calling the store?"
Target,34bl6f,AMBocanegra,3,Wed Apr 29 21:58:00 2015 UTC,"Target likes you to have the team mentality so show the interviewer that you work well with a team and that you can also excel on your own when required.  I think it's a 2 step interview. You go in, most likely as a group, and get interviewed 1 by 1. Once you finish, you'll probably get interviewed by someone higher up. This is a good sign. Don't stare down at your phone when you're waiting between interviews. You can talk to other interviewees. There isn't much you can do to speed up the process. They usually do a batch of interviews on a specific day. This is so that they are prepared and the people who are doing the interviews have time to do them. If you can't make it to the session, try calling HR and setting up a new interview, they're pretty reasonable."
Target,34bl6f,k929,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:08:34 2015 UTC,Awesome. That sounds pretty good. Are both interviews done on the same day or different days?
Target,34bl6f,Smokeeye123,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:11:53 2015 UTC,I think they're same day. For mine I had two separate days because the second interviewer was busy since they actually recruited me to a different position than what I came for originally.
Target,34bl6f,sneakily123,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:52:01 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty easy. Should be fun!
Target,34bl6f,Sickwater,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:11:08 2015 UTC,I totally hope so. I'd love to get the nerves out all at once. It sounds like its common for two interviews to happen in one day.
Target,34bl6f,Sickwater,2,Thu Apr 30 02:28:35 2015 UTC,Although I agree with most of these commenters some Targets aren't very lenient when it comes to hair.  If you're in a more conservative/suburban area it might be a problem but seeing as it's not like bright pink with like designs shaved into the side of your head you should be fine.   I would suggest before the interview to walk around the store and see how other team members are dressed and how their hair is.   Good luck on the interview :)

Target,348n95,RomulanBacon,5,Wed Apr 29 04:09:50 2015 UTC,"Nope not at all. The 4% increase is the standard increase for EX at target for all positions. The reason everyone else got a higher percentage is because of the increase in minimum wage so their percentage is skewed, not because they are good workers, but because a lot of them were getting paid incredibly low. I had 2 EX and both were 4% and I got an O this year and it was about 6% so its just the company standard."

To my knowledge the my device cannot be used in the same way and is not a substitute in the backroom. To do your job back there you need a pda. At my store I believe we have 10 pda's left and ONLY backroom can use them.
Target,344jnb,LeftySurprise,1 point,Tue Apr 28 09:19:44 2015 UTC,Same here. Inventory was last night we have 10 pdas charging in the back now.

Target,344jnb,Rhinoj97,3,Tue Apr 28 11:46:32 2015 UTC,"At my store backroom takes priority. If someone else needs to use one, the STL and ETL log have made it clear that noone takes one from BR unless they can afford to loan it for a little bit. Otherwise they wait until BR is done.  AD should be scanned in on a non truck day to avoid conflict. Why would pharmacy need 4 pdas??"

Target,344jnb,monkeyman80,1 point,Tue May 5 09:44:41 2015 UTC,"The 9999 accumulator reset still works with the myDevice with pretty much the exact same steps.  'scan item' > take > scan location > Take 9999 > How many are left?  Note: This does not work if the item isn't already in the location you scanned, so there's no SUBT stowing into a location that you could do with a PDA."
Target,344jnb,dAnthraxxx,1 point,Wed May 6 23:08:46 2015 UTC,When the mydevices aren't freezing they are faster at sto and subt (even the old one) than the PDAs. Having said that they can't pull or locu. Once they can I feel like they can replace PDAs for 90% of backroom activity and backroom will just have to keep a couple PDAs around for stuff like SWAD and reverse logistics.
Target,344jnb,karmasink,0,Mon May 18 03:01:50 2015 UTC,"I actually really love SUBT on the MyDevices.  So much better than the PDAs.  You can also STO as well (scan the item, scan the BR location).  As far as more BR capabilities, Target has said they want the PDAs to be the way the BR does stuff and they have no plans of adding more BR functionality (CAFs, LOCU, etc) to the MyDevices."

Target,3419wj,Avoid_Calm,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:19:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for showing tangible contest ideas. Love the pie/game board ideas. I usually just do prizes for 3 cards a shift (my store is all 4 hr shifts for cashiers) for the same types of prizes you describe but I like the ideas you bring up. Shoutouts to awesome GSAs as well. We are a mid volume store but we get the most REDcards in our district so 130 is our goal every week.
Target,3419wj,Avoid_Calm,4,Thu Apr 30 04:19:19 2015 UTC,"I'll preface this by saying I don't work front-end, I work in the backroom.  But, this is a pretty basic leadership problem that most entry-level leaders face. How do you push and motivate your subordinates?  Obviously there are a lot of differing opinions on how that question should be answered, so I'll just give you mine.   It's pretty simple to just be real with your cashiers. They don't want the fake smile bullshit, they can smell it from a mile away. Come down to their level and do your best to relate with them. This might be harder since you're new to Target, but just treat them like you would an acquaintance.  Hassling rarely works to motivate people. It will alienate the top performers and the low performers generally won't improve, or will only improve enough to keep you off their back for a bit. Instead, identify your high performers and personally go up to them and let them know they're doing a good job. Someone gets 3 redcards in a shift? Recognize that shit. Everybody loves positive feedback and they'll work much harder if they know you notice and appreciate it.  Your main focus however, should be on your low performers. Constantly riding them isn't going to help them either. Usually if someone is performing below the average, there is an underlying issue that needs to be solved. If you have a cashier rarely asking about redcards, do more than just tell them to ask. They know they're supposed to. Take them aside for a few minutes during a slow period. Ask them what's up. Maybe they don't know how to ask properly, maybe they're nervous, do what you can to identify the problem and rectify it.   Showing you care is the primary point I'm trying to get through here. If your cashiers see that you care about their performance, not just the redcards themselves, they'll be much more willing to put themselves out there and get redcards for you.  Be personable, relateable, and approachable. Those are the keys to a successful leader. If you have any more questions or want me to expand on any points, feel free to ask."
Target,3419wj,pgh9fan,2,Tue Apr 28 04:44:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this valuable response. An individual approach is a great idea. My top performers appreciated that we had a reasonable goal today and knew they could do their part to reach it.   As for the low performers, as long as they have a good ethic, they are able to be coached (formally) or just talked to (informally) about their habits.  Low performers with a bad ethic (""I just never get one"", etc.) are hard to bring up to level but easy to tell them steps. The ones I have now are 2-3 years into their Spot career so they really need to know it's part of their core role. Nothing new to them.  I will PM you in the future if I need more help. Backroom is part of the Target backbone and I value your advice."
Target,3419wj,10yearbazooka,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:24:45 2015 UTC,"Reasonable and attainable goals is another thing I forgot to mention. So good on you for already having that in place.  Low performers with good ethic are generally the easiest to fix, just one good conversation with them to try to identify the area they're having trouble with will set them up for success and they'll soon fall into the ranks of a top performer. Even better, they take up very little of your time to turn around, but pay off dividends when it works.  The people with poor ethic are where you're going to spend the vast majority of your time trying to build up. Try not to approach it as you trying to make them better at getting red cards, more of trying to help them be a better employee overall.   Coaching and putting people on CA is sometimes the wake up call they need to get going. It doesn't work for everyone though and some it will cause to just resent you. Get to know your cashiers, especially the ones with poor ethic, on a personal level, as I mentioned in my previous comment.  Some you'll have to take a stronger hand with and go the CA route. It sucks, but it's your job to do it if they simply aren't performing. Don't ever be afraid to coach someone and go down this route.  On the flip side though, some of your cashiers will see you actually taking time to just talk to them, see how it's going, and notice you actually care. Then they'll be more willing to work hard for you. It's a hard judgement call on which route to go with each individual person. Your low performers are going to be projects for you to turn around, while also encouraging and maintaining your top performers. It's a hard balance to strike, but once you create an atmosphere where hard work is appreciated and rewarded, your low performers will notice and step it up. This also helps for when you get new cashiers. If they walk into an environment where no one cares if you get red cards and no one really gives a shit about each other, they'll become a product of that environment.   So really do your best to build up a front-end that people will be happy working in and where if they succeed, they'll be noticed and appreciated. It will pay dividends in the future.  (This is getting long) One more thing! Not everyone has the personality to succeed as a cashier. Some people love it, others hate it. If another position opens in the store and you have a cashier you know hates doing it, work to get them cross-trained there. This is more of a ETL/STL oriented suggestion, but utilize your subordinates in ways that play to their strengths. Trying to showhorn people into positions they don't have the personality for is just setting them up for failure."
Target,3419wj,HugoBravez,6,Thu Apr 30 14:57:26 2015 UTC,"Cashier here.  It's part of my job to get REDCards. I don't see the big deal. It's repetitive and I use that. If I have a line, I make sure each guest hears me ask three times. Once each for the two people ahead of them and once directly to them.   REDCards aren't hard to get. I had three in four hours yesterday and it was relatively slow. Today in four hours I had zero. There are ups and downs. Tell each cashier that if they consistently ask they'll get them. It feeds off itself. Get two one day and you'll realize how you can do that every day.  Have cashiers take the time to explain the debit card to someone who's using their bank debit card. I tell guests the hardest part about the debit card is actually remembering to carry a check with them once. If each cashier is doing this, your cards will go up as repeat guests come back in with their checks.  Finally, I know that candy as a prize is annoying to some cashiers. They may be trying to be healthier and it sabotages them. Or, they could be diabetic like me and one other cashier at my store. Doesn't really give us much incentive to have a prize that's useless to us."
Target,3419wj,haremenot,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:23:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up on the candy thing. I read this a few days ago and one of my cashiers wanted a banana and some peanut butter (not diabetic but health conscious) after getting 2 and I gladly requisitioned it for him.
Target,3419wj,iamthejuz,2,Thu Apr 30 04:17:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a new cashier at Target (just started my 3rd week) and the biggest thing is not to pressure the cashiers too much. It can be really stressful. There's a GSTL at my store that is so obsessed with REDcards. She's constantly talking about REDcards, pressuring cashiers about asking every guest, and asking cashiers why they haven't gotten a REDcard yet. All the pressure makes me so nervous and really throws me off. I actually had a guest ask me if I was okay because my hands were shaking due to the stress. Basically, don't pressure the cashiers too much. We know REDcards are important, and most of us are trying. There's not much we can do beyond asking every guest and making sure they know what the REDcard is all about.   On the other hand, the rest of my GSTLs are good about encouraging cashiers to get REDcards. All they do is gently remind the cashiers at the beginning of their shift to ask about REDcards, and then at break time we get an update on how many REDcards we have gotten so far. When a cashier gets a REDcard, the GSTLs congratulate the cashier and tell them they did a good job. We also usually have some sort of prize, like a free deli item, starbucks drink, gift card, etc. The prizes are nice but the recognition and gratitude really go a long way."

An etl comes in at  6:30 to cover your lunch you take it. But you can't leave the store until everything is ok and you can't take another lunch.   If you want to be an etl go for it.

Target,33okv6,KatterpodOnRye,3,Fri Apr 24 07:25:27 2015 UTC,"Sr. TPS here. When it gets down to it, every position can equally impact ap by giving callouts of people they think r suspicious. Pn the operational side, positions like GSTLs, and sales floor TM in cosmetics/electronics work close with AP but on the sense of just communicating to AP if an item has 20 on hands but nothing on the floor or in the back. Then your ap team takes that information and does research. You can also master what tour store does merchandise protection on and whatever is in your department to make sure that it is protected.   Ninja edit: you will be able to work closely with ap, but u wont be able to know what goes on behind scenes, camera layouts, rules ect."
Target,33okv6,Croweslen,2,Fri Apr 24 15:30:56 2015 UTC,"As a Tps... I spend lots of time with electronics, guest service, backroom, and of course team leaders. If you can learn from departments like that it could help should an ap position open up to you someday"
Target,33okv6,DannyDawg,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:40:27 2015 UTC,"As a TPS, I'd say the people we recognize most for their actions related to our job would be cashiers and guest service.  The ones that take it upon themselves to handle shady situations (correctly) and/or notify us are the ones we notice, obviously."
Target,33nbsr,Leoge,5,Thu Apr 23 22:36:52 2015 UTC,"If you get it, congrats! You'll be going from one of the worst positions in the store to one of the best.  Your training will cover everything you need to know for HR. The specific duties vary slightly from store to store, but it's a lot of computer work and answering phones."
Target,33nbsr,anyquestions,4,Thu Apr 23 23:06:04 2015 UTC,"That is good to know, thank you! I think I would really like the position if I get it, as I have a lot of experience with phones and computers lol."
Target,33nbsr,Nabznbabz,3,Thu Apr 23 23:32:43 2015 UTC,"HR is a very underpaid entry level admin position but it is definitely one of the best positions in the store IMO. They support the etl-hr with payroll processing (punch corrections, request time off forms etc), tracking training, FFF events, talent acquisition.   If you are selected for an interview I would talk about how you are professional and understand the importance of confidentiality and discretion. Talk about how team culture is important to you and you would thrive in a roll where you are supporting others. Driving the culture of compliance with employment standards regulations is another key role. Team members are like your internal guests so you need to be able to relate well to others and problem solve. The job requires strong attention to detail and multitasking, prioritization and time management are key to success. I was an HRTM for two years."
Target,33nbsr,itsamutiny,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:22:25 2015 UTC,I will definitely look into making those important points if I get an interview. Thank you!
Target,33nbsr,LeftySurprise,2,Fri Apr 24 05:41:59 2015 UTC,"If they haven't actually said anything to you, don't assume you got the position. I applied for GSA once and thought I was the only one who applied, but someone else ended up getting the position."
Target,33nbsr,LeftySurprise,4,Thu Apr 23 23:04:00 2015 UTC,"Right! My understanding is that they try to internally hire, then externally if they do not like their candidates. I guess I am just looking for advice on what to work toward until the interview, or again, if I do get it, how to do my best in that position. No one has informed me yet, as I haven't had the interview yet either."
Target,33nbsr,Avril_Latrine,5,Thu Apr 23 23:31:58 2015 UTC,I think the fact that the STL encouraged you to apply is.... well encouraging lol. Good luck.
Target,33lvn5,SweetGehenna,9,Thu Apr 23 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"You started working in October then? That's how it goes through the holidays; hours galore. Now it's less busy and they're dividing up hours until it picks back up in the summer; usually that coincides when the schools let out for summer break.   If you need more hours, try asking your leadership team about getting cross-trained in other areas, You might get 20 hours here and 15 hours in another department."
Target,33lvn5,justini87,3,Thu Apr 23 16:22:00 2015 UTC,"That's retail for you, especially Target. Stores are allocated payroll based on sales and estimated guest activity (among other things). This time of the year simply isn't as busy as it was during the holidays, so hours are dropped.  As others have said, see about cross-training, and pick up shifts from the swap board. I'm usually scheduled for 23 - 26 hours but I can get up to 33 - 35 by the end of the week."
Target,33lvn5,dmillerw,2,Thu Apr 23 17:15:57 2015 UTC,It's that time of year. Between Feb and about july (give or take) is the slowest time of year. Payroll cutbacks can get steep. April is the worst.
Target,33lvn5,LeftySurprise,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:18:46 2015 UTC,Yeah this is happening to me too! My store we just hired a lot of people and everyone is getting their hours cut. I might find a new job.
Target,33lvn5,averagelogan,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you said something now and not during February.  The hours in February were hell(At least here in So Cal).   Just got to hold out til the holidays, normally it starts picking up then. I only work Friday-Sunday & I get just as many hours as some people who are available 6 days a week."
Target,33lvn5,Heavykiller,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:14:26 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else said, hours between February and July are sparse. You can cross train to try to get more hours, but that really only helps if it's an area in which they don't have enough people. I was crossed trained in almost every area and still couldn't get more than 20 hours when I was a team member.  Your other choice is to look into any open positions that have a set schedule/more hours. My Softlines Brand TMs get at least 30 hours a week, even during the slow periods. Fitting Room, Electronics, Pfresh, GSA and Backroom also seem to get a lot of hours in my store. And if you're really ambitious, go for a full time position, such as GSTL or TL."
Target,33lvn5,Ladybird310,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:47:09 2015 UTC,I'm feeling similar right now...10 hours for the coming week. I don't know who I pissed off!

Target,33hudu,dubblechzburger,2,Wed Apr 22 18:30:23 2015 UTC,"Well, you might upset your PMT/SFT but there's a little gold key somewhere that's for the amiibo display. We have a bag of all the miscellaneous keys and it's in there for us. Our Skylander one crashes a ton and one of our electronics guys always turns off the amiibo display so he gets that brought up to him a ton and he'll get dinged if he ever gets a visit so I wouldn't turn it off but... if you use the key to unlock it, you can swing it out and then there's volume buttons for the little TV. My PMT didn't care if I turned it down a ton as long as you can just hear it while in that aisle and the video loop is playing.  One noise issue down, a million to go."
Target,33hudu,gordogg24p,2,Wed Apr 22 18:35:03 2015 UTC,"My phone has an IR blaster, so I might be able to figure out what frequency that needs to be on to turn it down remotely."

Target,33hudu,LeftySurprise,2,Wed Apr 22 20:03:43 2015 UTC,Lol until your PMT realizes what is happening and then turns the volume up on all the displays and hides the keys.
Target,33hudu,dubblechzburger,2,Wed Apr 22 21:57:11 2015 UTC,"Lol well like I said, my PMT didn't care if I turned the volume down. We were there trying to turn it back on together since someone turned it off and he said to just turn the volume down then to turn it off. He needs it stay on but knows it's annoying as shit so he let's us turn it down to the point where you can hear it in the aisle but not 5 aisles over."
Target,33hudu,LeftySurprise,2,Wed Apr 22 22:11:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. My PMT has every display set at a non ear piercing decibel level.

Target,33g9e9,MrKentucky,3,Wed Apr 22 16:22:28 2015 UTC,Make sure you go around and talk to the food area! It seems to be the common problem that we as a whole are neglected by the etls. My coworkers in the bakery/deli/produce have a lot of hard feelings BC several etls and even our stl that started within the past 6months haven't so much come over and tried to build any type of relationship. In fact the only time some of them even walked over to our area in the past month is to throw on our hats and pretend to do our jobs for a picture to post on twitter.
Target,33g9e9,Besnasty,2,Wed Apr 22 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"Our etls seem to make a genuine effort to ask how we are and how everything is going in our work center, I really like that about them."
Target,33g9e9,theycallherdeath,2,Wed Apr 22 15:43:08 2015 UTC,Just be open to asking and answering questions. I think that goes for making an impression as a whole though. I just feel like my Etl-HR is very closed to answering questions and seems annoyed when a team member (that isn't an ETL) does approach them. I think just being open and friendly and getting to know your team members really helps and makes for a better transition into your roll on the team.
Target,33g9e9,JustDoodling,2,Wed Apr 22 18:54:13 2015 UTC,I would suggest taking a moment to personally introduce yourself to team members. Ask them to give you an interesting fact about themselves. It's amazing the things you can learn about a team member that you might not find out by just working next to them.
Target,33g9e9,Ladybird310,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:42:33 2015 UTC,Just remember that TM's are people too.  A lot of ETL's fail to remember that.

Target,33fnbe,thatstightbutthole1,4,Wed Apr 22 03:16:37 2015 UTC,"hey there, I am a district manager for Target Mobile (Marketsource) for a few ""super targets"" (basically high volume locations with the expanded Electronics and Entertainment sections).  Although I have not worked directly for Target, I have worked my way from team member to flex to team lead to district manager within a year's time, being 100% focused and having a 4year degree definitely helped.  I have worked with many different ETL HR's and have seen everything from absolutely amazing ETL's to an ETL HR that everyone in the store despises (our districts re-aligned and I was moved to a completely new part of the state).  Whatever college you're about to graduate from.... GO TO THE RECRUITING EVENTS... it is much much easier to get the hiring process started at a recruiting event since multiple leaders will be able to get a feel for whether you fit the Target mold (Fun Fast and friendly). I have tagged along with them to recruit for Target Mobile operations positions before and you definitely have a much higher chance of getting noticed there vs sending in a copy of your resume. Making a memorable and positive first impression is probably the most important thing.  With all that said, this will only lead to an executive intern position and not ETL HR. Unless no one is willing to move to your area it's my impression that it is very difficult to come out of college and get ETLHR with no management experience, Exec Interns usually start ETL GE/LOG/HL since HR is a more complicated position and most ETL HR's I've encountered with the exception of one have had advanced degrees or certifications.  The ETL HR's I've known who have moved onto group HR or HRBP have been people who are 100% dedicated to the job, they live breathe and sleep target.   Common problems team members have with HR: scheduling during requested and approved time off, dramatically cutting off hours without communicating a reason (not always appropriate but when a TM goes from 30hrs/wk to 4, even I hear about it.    Don't know but the two districts I've had for mobile have been primarily high volume and is anecdotally where leadership goes before getting promoted ( ETL's transfer to before getting STL etc...)  Basically: 1)attend campus events 2) make good impression 3) be open to moving to a different district location to get ANY ETL position, just very rare to see someone jump from 4 year degree to ETLHR with little experience. And if you do get a Exec intern interview... prepare prepare prepare prepare... I can't believe how many people I see and hear about that show up for interviews unprepared.... good luck! Pretty long and not sure if helpful but I'm actually really good friends with our DTL, HRBP, and APBP's so I do hear a lot about hiring ... feel free to PM any reasonable questions"
Target,33fnbe,tgtthrowaway15,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:48:13 2015 UTC,"Hi there,  I recently received an ETL-Human Resources offer.   How it normally works is that they hire you for the generic position (ETL) after your interview process and then assign you your specific role (like HR, Assets Protection, etc.) after six weeks of training. However, if you show a lot of interest in a certain position, they will be more likely consider you later on in the process.   In my case, the timing worked out and they ended up approaching me for the HR position before starting training. They knew I was interested because I talked about it a LOT during the interview process.  Overall, be friendly make your goals apparent while still seeming flexible."

Target,33bfo0,l0singmymarbles,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:56:57 2015 UTC,What kind of severance did they give you guys?
Target,33bfo0,Sickwater,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:06:44 2015 UTC,"It was based on your average hours between late October and mid January. So while the store was still open you were expected to work x hours a week, even if your availability said you couldn't. (It was a mess) After your location shut down, you would receive pay every other week for those average hours, like you were still working there. Our last paycheck will come in late May. Pretty sweet deal once the store closed, but while we were open it was almost impossible to have a life outside of Target."
Target,33bfo0,l0singmymarbles,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:12:27 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad deal.    almost impossible to have a life outside of Target.   Sounds like my life from October through January. Six days a week, 12 hours shifts. Mandatory OT. Sweet money, though."
Target,33bfo0,Sickwater,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:18:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was very similar to that only worse. They stopped giving out the schedule 2 weeks in advance so we wouldn't know our shifts until like 3 days before hand (for Sundays, 9 for Saturdays) and they went outside your availability and you couldn't book any time off (to go to job interviews and such) or call in sick without having a doctors note. It got very shitty once liquidation started. Glad it's over tbh"
Target,33bfo0,l0singmymarbles,2,Thu Apr 30 17:23:54 2015 UTC,"I play with mine while I walk too.  The only time I've ever cut myself, it was my fault not the blade."

Target,33bfo0,Yield88,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:42:44 2015 UTC,"Right? I wear gloves not because I'm afraid of getting cut on my blade, but b/c I hate cardboard papercuts. Anyway, I've seen people cut right through their gloves because they were tired or distracted. The thing is, with the blades we use, you don't need to hold it open.   I like the RZ3 b/c once the blade bites into the cardboard, you can take your thumb off the button, and the blade will spring back as soon as you finish the cut.   During peak, we got a code green nearly once per shift b/c of a blade incident. Granted, many if not most of those were the temps, but still."
Target,33bfo0,Sickwater,2,Thu Apr 30 12:34:59 2015 UTC,"I cut myself all the time but that's only because I slide too fast and use my thumb to push it back in, so I cut my thumb"
Target,33bfo0,MrHeartless,2,Tue Apr 21 12:57:40 2015 UTC,"One time it was in my pocket, later on I realized it made a hole! Luckily it was in time before it hit the skin. Those shits are cheap and terrible. And they don't let you bring in your own blade for ""safety.""  My friend works at Walmart and I was always jealous of his standard issue blade. Seriously, them things are nice!  When I worked in Electronics and backroom, I managed to wear a Slinky as a bracelet and put the magnetic key there for easy access, and holds the blade without moving it either.  Had a fellow TM use magnets to keep them shut and on hand on the side of there shirt for easy access and away from his pocket"
Target,33bfo0,DoomedJanissary,0,Tue Apr 21 13:23:45 2015 UTC,I bought one of those easycutters off amazon (they're like 12 bucks) and I couldn't get used to it. I feel like I have more control over my cuts with the jifficutter.
Target,33bfo0,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,-1,Tue Apr 21 15:38:06 2015 UTC,I brought in one of these http://www.safetyknivesandcutters.com/images/Product/medium/670.jpg in a leather holster and I was told we absolutely could not use them. Just the fact that we can't bring in our own safer ones is bullshit.
Target,33bfo0,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,4,Tue Apr 21 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's ridiculous. My store doesn't care what kind of knife you use but if you hurt yourself, you better believe your ass is grass."
Target,33bfo0,Sickwater,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:23:48 2015 UTC,I work at a distribution center and they issue us these.  They come with this holster.  Maybe you can bring this up with your TL.   At my work they take safety seriously. It sucks you have to use that crappy blade.
Target,33bfo0,Houshmandzadeh,2,Thu Apr 30 12:35:33 2015 UTC,Those aren't even allowed in the FC I work at.
Target,33bfo0,Pdub721,2,Tue Apr 21 16:40:03 2015 UTC,I started at target and im now at walmart and I hated using those damn things. I brought in my moms easy cutter from her job and was told I couldn't use it but I told them it was my personal choice to use a safer box cutter and the STL didn't argue with me. I am surprised that target doesn't use this. I don't use the holster I just use my belt loop and back pocket but they are 10x faster to use than these things and I can drop it and pick it up cuz its on the leash.
Target,33bfo0,Foizle,2,Tue Apr 21 21:11:26 2015 UTC,I don't put it in my pocket ever. I like to put my box cutter on my name tag. The magnets that hold our name tags have 3 magnets with 2 at the bottom and the middle one is slightly above the others. I use that top one to hold the boxcutter and the bottom 2 magnets to hold my name tag in place. I've never misplaced it or cut myself.
Target,33bfo0,CRZephyr,2,Wed Apr 22 01:37:53 2015 UTC,"With these ""upgrades,"" I never cut myself and I never lose time digging in my pocket. Enjoy! http://i.imgur.com/XyKYN7v.jpg"

Target,33bdvo,khaelian,3,Tue Apr 21 03:41:22 2015 UTC,"Got a 33 cent raise and an EX. I'm content I guess...  Minimum wage in Mass is going up a dollar though each year until 2017 so it's kind of funny. I got a 25 cent raise up to the new standard of $9 this January first, then next year its $10 then the year after it's $11.  So theoretically if I still work there in like 2 or three years I will making the EXACT SAME AMOUNT as someone they just hired and has been there for 3 days"
Target,33bdvo,Smokeeye123,5,Tue Apr 21 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"I was making $8.50 as an electronics team member. Wage hike and merit raise means I'm now making $10.30. AND an HR position just opened up that I applied for (I have a BA in psychology).  Feels good, man."

Target,33bdvo,nohitter21,3,Tue Apr 21 03:45:38 2015 UTC,"STL can't do anything about it. Raises go by percentage depending on your performance.   My second raise at target was negated by minimum wage hike. Also not targets doing. They won't compensate for that, and I don't blame them. They're already shelling out more money. This is why minimum wage hikes are bullshit. They take money away from those that earned it and give it to those who have not.  I'm pretty happy with my raise this year. $.65"

Target,33bdvo,nohitter21,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:13:46 2015 UTC,Usually you have to have been working for at least a year to get anything substantial. If raise time comes around before that its usually .01 per month. I started seasonal and my first raise was .07
Target,33bdvo,vPikajew,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:03:03 2015 UTC,I did recently get a promotion & moved to another store. But why would they give somebody a review worth .06 cents and promote to TL?
Target,33bdvo,pcc666,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:30:14 2015 UTC,"Your raise gets prorated if you weren't there for a full year since the last review period. You'll get at least a $0.25 raise if you aren't a garbage employee and show up to work next time around, more if you're good or your TL likes you."

It's flippin' awesome!  Congrats on your raise. :)
Target,33bt44,arcaptainic,5,Tue Apr 21 06:18:07 2015 UTC,"Receipt, packaging, and all contents... You'll be able to return for a full refund in the form of original payment.  Try to package it up nicely, if at all possible, and the Guest service team member won't hate you."
Target,33bt44,Isak922,1 point,Tue Apr 21 06:55:35 2015 UTC,"I have the same soundbar. It sounds that way because of the way 5.1 channel audio mixes down to stereo. You'll have comparable problems when playing any 5.1 channel audio with a stereo (2 channel) soundbar. Try playing with the audio modes (surround mode vs. non-surround) and with the bass and treble levels. Non-surround mode with a lower bass and higher treble fixes the problem for me.  But to answer your question more directly, yes, since it's within 30 days you can return it no worries. If guest service asks you if there's anything wrong with it, tell them no but that you weren't satisfied with the sound quality."
Target,33bt44,anyquestions,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:32:56 2015 UTC,"Like most people said, you won't have a problem if you have the packaging and all the contents, and can put it back together to make it look decent.   If you want to try a different soundbar, see if they have the Samsung specific TV display on their wall. We have one where it's a 48 and 55 inch Samsung in a specific Samsung branded spot and it has a $400 Soundbar (technically called Soundstand) attached to the 55 inch. Try that one out (there's a button to play a demo right now) and that one sounds nice. It's on cartwheel this week to for 50% off though so it might be tougher to find otherwise I have the $250 LG Soundbar at home and have no complaints with that one whatsoever."

Target,33bt44,iamthejuz,3,Tue Apr 21 06:29:41 2015 UTC,"False. The back of the receipt says no such thing.

I'm just not happy with the product. The receipt does say right under the item ""return by 5/12/15"". I was unsure if that just meant unopened or what. My understanding since it is opened, I would only be able to receive store credit. Right?"
Target,33bt44,applebeebird,2,Tue Apr 21 06:35:39 2015 UTC,Like what Isak was saying you should be able to get the cash back as long as everything is in the box. You're not past the 30 days and you have your receipt so you should be good.

Target,3384mg,Bab5crusade,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:40:12 2015 UTC,So do you rate each TL and ETL on how you think they are doing. Or what; sorry for the questions I'm just a curious little bee.
Target,3384mg,gordogg24p,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:20:59 2015 UTC,Pretty much. I believe it mostly focuses on you reviewing the ETL/TL that heads whatever department you work in. You can also give specific comments about problems and suggest improvements you'd like to see in the store.
Target,3384mg,gordogg24p,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:33:39 2015 UTC,So if you have TL or ETLs that bully other team members (not me) but I see it we can say something on that survey?
Target,3384mg,cody2isdown,2,Mon Apr 20 15:54:19 2015 UTC,"Yes. Also probably worth calling that integrity hotline for stuff like that, assuming you have a decent AP."

Target,3375rv,Gundee1114,2,Mon Apr 20 04:37:00 2015 UTC,"They were $25 for PS4 for sure. For some reason, I think the One was actually less to get a card, but I don't remember for sure. We've never taken pre-orders for special edition consoles/bundles."
Target,3375rv,gordogg24p,2,Mon Apr 20 06:17:09 2015 UTC,"Nah, ain't possible. Even if the store has a preorder card for the console, which they haven't since the consoles first launched, you can only pay as much as the card was, 25 or 50 bucks."

Target,3375rv,ElectronicsTM,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:18:53 2015 UTC,"Target only does in-store preorder cards for new consoles, so no. Regardless, the Cartwheel deal is only good on a console purchase, not a preorders card."

Target,3375rv,monkeyman80,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:31:27 2015 UTC,the cartwheel has to be active when you want to use it. you can't apply it till you have purchased it or the wrong price is active.

Target,334cpi,SanltarYNAPkin,10,Mon Apr 20 18:33:23 2015 UTC,I watched woman leave her child in a stroller at the front of the store so she could book it to the back. The kid was MAX a little over a year. All for a $40 dress or beach towel
Target,334cpi,mmmads09,10,Sun Apr 19 14:35:38 2015 UTC,Do the people mobbing these stores actually think they are getting $300 articles of designer clothing for $38 at Target? The only similarity between a $38 shirt bought at Target and the $300 version bought at Nordstrom is who is eventually cashing the check.

It was dead up front so GSA said I could go do reshop (which I love, I'm trying to get cross trained to Hardlines asap) and one thing turned to another and I ended up learning how to pull CAF's from the backroom. Then proceeded to stay late until 9PM to close up front. Ended up being on register for maybe 1.5 hours out of the 9.25 hours I was there that day.  That's really about as exciting as it gets at my store."
Target,333rqo,FrozenPhoenix95,2,Sun Apr 19 07:39:57 2015 UTC,"as a cashier i really looked forward to days i could be anything but (outside cart attendant). cashiering and cart attendant teeter on what's worse.   some might have had interviews for other work centers, but that's really unusual.   covering electronics requires no formal training. its like cashier training, and learning how the locks work."

I have worked at shitty places where the management were lazy and rude, and over-controlling, etc. But I have never really had management problems at Target, this may not be true everywhere but the team at my store is what keeps me there."
Target,32xkbb,Paprika_Six,16,Fri Apr 17 21:08:41 2015 UTC,Mainly openings and location.  There is no really big difference between each other. Each company are slave masters.

Target,32y28x,sajey,4,Fri Apr 17 18:58:48 2015 UTC,No. Sometimes it doesn't get auto approved right away and takes a few days to come in the mail. If not they will send you a letter letting you know why you were denied.
Target,32y28x,funnymem,2,Fri Apr 17 20:02:57 2015 UTC,"It takes around a week to two weeks to recieve anything about a Red Card. Give it a little time.

Target,32w8u2,eitaknoslen,6,Fri Apr 17 05:56:34 2015 UTC,"You don't have to wait any amount of time to change your availability. Go onto EHR and change it that way. If it asks why, explain your situation as short as possible (i.e. I need to be able to catch my bus as it's my only transportation). I suggest setting your availability to be until an hour before your store closes.  As soon as you submit it, go to your TL and let them know that you submitted and why it needs to be set that way. Don't be afraid to periodically remind them, just like anyone else, they forget things too. If it gets auto-denied, resubmit and instead go to your ETL and tell them the situation. Hope this helps"

Some of the main/front-end cashiers get more REDCards in a day than me and my fellow Electronics TMs can get in a couple months...

Target,32nmdt,siiberiia,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:29:55 2015 UTC,"Get used to it. They've been testing out a new model at some stores, and it will likely go company wide in the next 2 years.   There will be less specific roles on salesfloor. The goal is to have everyone on the salesfloor a one stop shop employee. You will assist guests, push cafs, work abandons and in some stores I've heard they are doing away with flow for the most part. Truck flow will be pushed throughout the day by the same TM'S. Not sure how widespread that will go, but I was told by my Regional manager that target is pushing hard to get this accomplished. I'm sure it won't work at every store."

Were supposed to stay around the boat while doing pulls and stray so that way we're always visible so we can keep our Vibe scores high. (We've been about 90-95 last few months)  Occasionally they'll bring us a toys/office pull or stray cart to work out, or if the hardlines person on that side of the floor is far from it or on break we'll help with a call but mainly it's just electronics."
Target,32nmdt,dubblechzburger,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:13:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can see that. We have a guy who's kind of like that at mine too. The rest of us don't necessarily do that but whenever they bring us anything we make the boat our priority. Just incase that ends up being the thing that our TLs and ETLs crack down on for a while. We used to be in the red constantly with the occasional stretch of yellows and a rare green for vibe scores. So the ETL and the TL started keeping track on how often we were near the boat and then they implemented a new procedure about standing near the boat 5 minutes whenever you just helped someone. Even changed the TL&LOD check in sheet for AAR in order to track it.  So now that we're consistently near the top 5 in our group of 100 or so stores for Vibe, I still do that even though the TLs and ETLs don't harp on us about it anymore."
Target,32nmdt,dubblechzburger,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:14:38 2015 UTC,"I guess I've kind of had a lucky bit of streak with my electronics shifts.

When they work, they are totally okay and are convenient. But when it doesn't, it's terrible. It takes myself (GSA) and a desk TM to fix the little errors that happen every 2 minutes. People are incredibly incompetent with them and don't know where to put the money or where to swipe the card when there's a grocery store with an extremely similar setup that people shop at, too. Recently there was an update that made them worse. They used to be able to scan the Cartwheel code, they don't learn the weights for items, and they freeze up so many times.

Doesn't slow me down too much, but sometimes the bill is too wrinkled and won't pass the first time so you have to wrestle with it a bit. Definitely more accurate and preferable to using the pens."
Target,32mehw,lemonbee,2,Wed Apr 15 02:43:29 2015 UTC,I've never seen this. Do people get mad if you have to turn their money away for being fake?
Target,32mehw,Besnasty,3,Wed Apr 15 02:46:52 2015 UTC,"I've had some people get mad, yeah. They usually say stuff like, ""I don't understand why you won't take it. I got this from the bank!"" Or people sometimes get angry at you just for checking, like you're accusing them of something. Might be because I live in a tourist town and we get a lot of weird people."
Target,32mehw,lemonbee,2,Wed Apr 15 03:18:27 2015 UTC,"Self-checkouts are okay. Up here in Canada we had one dedicated person at them to help any Guests and clear any errors. If it the ends up being the same as it was in Canada it'll get kinda annoying since if someone decides not to get an item and wants to remove it you would have to log in, remove the item, then prompt it to go back into the Guest view. Wish they had a button where the Guest could remove it themselves. I'm sure it'll be different for you though, hopefully."
Target,32mehw,Zlyphor,2,Wed Apr 15 05:04:38 2015 UTC,"We already had the bill checkers at my store, but self checkouts would be awesome."
Target,32mehw,shyguy528,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:49:10 2015 UTC,That's awesome! Which store is this?
Target,32mehw,S0uless,0,Wed Apr 15 13:44:02 2015 UTC,"Self checkout is what we need.  I go to another wal mart with my friend so i can avoid people...which makes me sound awful but its great just checking yourself out  Also self checkout would cut down on costs for target.  Less cashiers is something im sure theyre excited about, from a business standpoint. Im surprised they havent done it already."
Target,32ksah,funplex,12,Tue Apr 14 16:15:11 2015 UTC,The issue is that the TLs know you work too hard. They are going to exploit that.
Target,32ksah,Bab5crusade,6,Tue Apr 14 17:03:49 2015 UTC,Take your breaks. If there is no one to cover it let the gstl know and then go on your break.
Target,32ksah,sajey,3,Tue Apr 14 17:03:12 2015 UTC,Thank You :]
Target,32ksah,Fr0stSoldier,2,Tue Apr 14 17:37:55 2015 UTC,"This is why I left Starbucks! It was always something. Not enough people, call ins, no one to cover breaks/lunches, and many others. It was frustrating and I would be annoyed all the time. Thankfully my TL was awesome. She would let us do the order because she couldn't be there on order days all the time. The main problem I had was with the ETL's who don't care."
Target,32ksah,maxc7,2,Tue Apr 14 23:12:11 2015 UTC,"that's exactly why i left tarbucks and switched to a corporate starbucks. it was a mess when i worked there, even though i really did love that job when the managers weren't making all the baristas miserable. my job did get a lot better though when i stopped caring. i wouldn't help out the managers at all, just my fellow baristas that i liked. and if nobody could cover my 15s, tough cookies, i switched off the lights and took them anyway. don't let target win~"
Target,32ksah,baristarunner,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:47:26 2015 UTC,I would have switched to a corporate store a long time ago if the one in my town didn't suck. :\ One of the Tarbucks seasonal hires at my store a couple years ago ended up going there after he was let go and I CANNOT stand him. He's a shift now so I won't be going to that store until he's gone.   I also would have quit a long time ago if it weren't for my dental insurance and my 401k. I just don't want to be bothered with switching all that crap over. :\
Target,32ksah,HemingfordGrey,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:04:22 2015 UTC,Transfer to my store if you're in SoCal it's a good one.
Target,32ksah,monkeyman80,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:12:05 2015 UTC,"i've been told outside tl level when you're doing what you're doing, stop busting your ass so the store look good. they know you work hard and can promote you.   being starbucks and having a sr tl ahead of you, you'll really need to look at other stores for tl positions."
Target,32ksah,JeringtonBear,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:43:52 2015 UTC,"I know EXACTLY how you feel. I'm a former food ave/Starbucks team member, and i remember us never having any sort of coverage one way or another. No mid, no coverage, just go on lunch, and deal with the repercussions of leaving your stand alone for a half an hour. Not only that, the TOs were fucking USELESS. My TL's would fuck off to God knows where as soon as I clocked in, not really helping, just being around and fucking around until it was time to take me lunch, a half hour before I hit compliance. After a full calendar year, I quit, I put in my two weeks and no showed the last four shifts, and said ""to hell with this shit.""   Don't even get me started on other team members not being trained. So many after school rushes, hitting the backup buttons violently, only for my useless TL's to saunter over and causally ask ""Is everything okay over here?"" Asking in front of a line of people 10 deep. ""no, I'm fine, I just wanted to have a jolly conversation about how well organized the back room is!"""
Target,32i11l,ISpeakSax,7,Mon Apr 13 23:25:26 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is the way it's done everywhere, but at my (old) store you were paid based on where you logged the most hours. For example, if I logged 20 hours at Starbucks and 12 on Cash in a 2 week period, I would be paid as Starbucks but if I only logged 10 at Starbucks and 12 on Cash in those 2 weeks I would be paid as a cashier. Like I said though, I'm not sure if that is done at every location."
Target,32i11l,l0singmymarbles,3,Tue Apr 14 00:30:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I wasn't sure because they never explained that."
Target,32i11l,l0singmymarbles,4,Tue Apr 14 00:54:39 2015 UTC,Yeah they never explained it to me either. HR actually had to back pay me at one point because it didn't automatically do it in the system. Received 2 pay stubs one week and that's how I found out about it.
Target,32i11l,l0singmymarbles,2,Tue Apr 14 01:01:41 2015 UTC,"It's more difficult because there seems to be a lot of information. Luckily at my store if we have questions at all we can ask anyone, which definitely comes in handy at the start. I was thinking of doing cashier shifts, but I'm not much of a people person in the sense that I'm not much of a talker. The more hours the better, though, so I can tolerate it since a lot of the customers are friendly."
Target,32i11l,Rhinoj97,2,Tue Apr 14 02:19:02 2015 UTC,"You don't really have to be a talker to do cash. As long as you're friendly, polite, and willing to the REDCard pitch you should be fine. Remember that the GSAs and GSTLs want you to succeed and will (hopefully) happily answer any questions you may have."
Target,32i11l,robman1123,2,Wed Apr 15 00:04:18 2015 UTC,"I just prefer doing things with less interaction with the public, not that I avoid it. I don't mind cashiering, I'd just rather do more ""behind the scenes"" type work, which is why I chose flow team. I've only dealt with about 4 customers and completely forgot about REDCard's haha. I didn't even catch how to do them, I was ringing someone up at the time that the others were being shown how and missed out."
Target,32i11l,robman1123,3,Wed Apr 15 00:17:34 2015 UTC,If you pick up a cashier shift or any other shift you will be paid your wage (flow team).   And I had to set up direct deposit on the computer at the store because the one at home didn't work same problem you are having. Hope that helps a little.
Target,32i11l,robman1123,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:40:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I appreciate the help!"
Target,32i11l,robman1123,3,Tue Apr 14 00:51:16 2015 UTC,"Hey congrats and good luck with flow! As the other user said you will get your wage, it doesn't change if you pick up someone else's shift. As far as setting up Direct deposit it is best to do it in store. I find there are a lot of issues with target websites/portals when I try and log on at home. Setting up my benefits took me multiple tries at home across multiple days.   So once again good luck!"
Target,32h175,siiberiia,15,Mon Apr 13 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"maybe 5 minutes, given buy the team lead or etl in charge of your area, frontline, hardlines, softlines, backroom/logistics. they read off a bunch of corporate bullshit that's broken down into areas and then assign value to each area. I forget the exact terminology they use to label your performance but its along the lines of, not good, good, better than good. they tell you about your meager ~2% raise, you sign and walk out depressed that this is what your life has come to."

Target,32h175,JeringtonBear,4,Sat Apr 18 03:57:56 2015 UTC,"Last year I had mine with one of my ETLs. I didn't feel as though they were genuine reviews, and no one on my team (backroom) felt as though their review properly reflected their work.  They don't last very long, consider how many reviews must be done."
Target,32h175,SortaFlyForAWhiteGuy,5,Mon Apr 13 19:07:38 2015 UTC,"Mine have always been by my TL. They're very generic and you get graded on a scale of sucking,fantastic, super awesome (paraphrasing obviously). They will give some comments that tend to sound cut and paste. And then you get to look over their comments, see your raise, and then sign."
Target,32h175,Besnasty,2,Mon Apr 13 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"depends on position. tl does any team member. etl does tl, stl does etl. dtl does stl."
Target,32h175,monkeyman80,2,Tue Apr 14 03:41:19 2015 UTC,"Been done by TL. The TL reports a normally a genuine reflection of your performance, obviously that can range on how well you interact/know your GSTL. Are you another face in the lanes, or do you excell in your work? etc. Stuff you can probably figure out just by going off how work feels. They'll tell you if you need to improve, and where you're doing well. Don't stress!"
Target,32h175,NhvK,2,Thu Apr 16 09:27:31 2015 UTC,"Mine lasted all of 5 minutes, one of my flow TLs went through a list of about 5 or 6 categories and It was either ""Exceeding expectations"" or ""Not meeting expectations"" for each category. We shook hands at the end and that was it, didn't sign anything or go through any paperwork."
Target,32cldq,2MarsAndBeyond,6,Sun Apr 12 17:29:55 2015 UTC,I think it will just be $9.50 + this years review. The walmart bump overwrites all your old raises.
Target,32cldq,cyan1113,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:39:49 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm assuming will happen, but I'm curious all the other possibilities will be."

Target,32cldq,IamNOTGaryBusey,4,Sun Apr 12 17:52:53 2015 UTC,Yep that's what it is. Got mine last week got exactly that.
Target,32cldq,monkeyman80,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:59:02 2015 UTC,this so much. you don't get your past raises if min wage wipes them out. if you are at a diff pay grade that counts.

Anyways, I must work at one of the best Targets. We have ETLs that help out, STLs that are nice, and our only real problems come from corporate. Our current STL is super awesome. I'm sure there are some internal problems and people that don't like certain other people or managers, but they seem to be all good nice people to me.   Actually, There is one lady that came from a different store that seems to be taking a different approach to the whole red card thing at the front end. I've seen the way she talked to this one guy about getting red cards and he looked super annoyed."
Target,32b0cn,FirePowerCR,1 point,Sun Apr 12 12:56:45 2015 UTC,"Having worked at a few different retail jobs, I know it's not uncommon for supervisors to be condescending. Theres a few of em at my store. The worst is this one ETL who will ask me what I'm working on, what I'm doing, or where I'm going etc, every single time he walks past me. Every single time. And in an accusatory tone, as if he does not trust me. During my first month or so there, he talked to me as if I was a kindergartner like you said. At first I thought it was just me, but apparently he talks like this to everyone below him. We just got a new ETL recently too who is changing all sorts of things in multiple departments, even though his work area is the back room. There's been a lot of people who have voiced their dislike for him and have stories of him telling them they aren't doing their work fast enough or good enough, maybe of these stories very similar. He made one girl cry after stressing her out too much with workload nagging, but req'd a plush toy out for her when he realized he'd given her an anxiety attack. Shitty sometimes :("
Target,32b0cn,CheesecakeDiscoParty,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:02:22 2015 UTC,Mt STL is the nicest guy ever always happy smiling and never really gets angry. He even took a pie in the face yesterday after we got twenty red cards.
Target,32at69,jkbaum,7,Sun Apr 12 03:34:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, being a GSA is all about being supportive to everyone so they can do their jobs fantastically.  Cashiers need the knowledge and support to make sure they're moving at the best speed, and guest service needs you in case of questions.   Usually you're answering questions and keeping the front end functional.  The best thing to do is to make sure you do your job 100% and get trained elsewhere.  Most GSA-GSTL jumps are usually to different areas (at least at my store.)     Become easy to work with.  If someone can come to you with a task and they know it will be the quality of work they would expect from themselves, you'll start getting more work.  More work=More money (usually)"

Target,32at69,monkeyman80,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:46:24 2015 UTC,"Get to know the other TL's, get to know your GE. I'm currently interviewing for a GSA position and am well regarded with every TL in my store, as well as most LODs. Remember to keep your cool in hot situations (5 years in cs, so I'm sure thats a no brainer) and if possible get guests to mention you in their surveys on their receipts. It goes a long way to see a GSA's name pop up when a situation goes smoothly and a guest comes out happy. Above all else, learn the departments so you know the ins and out of each in the event you jump to one. gl!"

Target,326roq,DelTrigger,1 point,Sat Apr 11 12:42:22 2015 UTC,Yes it has changed effective Feb1. Only AP and RX are tested now.

Target,326roq,ThePopeHasApenis,-6,Wed Apr 22 21:28:05 2015 UTC,"Yes. Policy is to test for all hires. Some promotions will also have it, but it could be hit or miss depending on what location you are at. I believe Senior TL/ETL/AP all have tests just because of the position type as well."
Target,326roq,AMBocanegra,5,Sat Apr 11 05:06:18 2015 UTC,This is not correct. The only pre-employment drug testing that currently happens is for those with conditional job offers in AP and healthcare

Target,322cq1,transtarget,9,Fri Apr 10 00:40:28 2015 UTC,"I can't say I've seen any particular policies in this regard; in the handbook, or anywhere on Workbench. If you feel it's effecting your work environment in a negative sense, bring the issue up with your ETL-HR or STL. If they fail to resolve it in a manner you find acceptable, then I would call the Hotline.  The nature of the call would immediately make it so that your store team is aware who made the call; however it should also force their hand into giving you a more agreeable situation.  Other than that... Use a ""Private"" restroom? Pharmacy, Family, etc? Those are available for use by any gender and single occupant."
Target,322cq1,Isak922,5,Fri Apr 10 00:49:44 2015 UTC,"I already use the private restrooms in the backroom. They are gendered technically, but they are single stall and people will just use the other when their gender's room is occupied anyway. This is just really annoying and against my impulse when using the restrooms. I have been living as female for over a year and have had no problems using public female restrooms. So I usually just think to use the womens' room, but obviously I'm not allowed. It also seemed a bit discriminatory that I can't use public restrooms because I'll make people uncomfortable, even not being visibly male."
Target,322cq1,SoulCrystal,5,Fri Apr 10 01:00:18 2015 UTC,"If it were me... I'd still use the restroom you're most comfortable with using. We have stalls for a reason. I don't think target can actually keep you from using particular restrooms. What area of the store do you work at? I assume the front because you talk about the front restrooms. Unless a guest actually says something to a higher up, don't worry about it."
Target,322cq1,IsupportLGBT_nohomo,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:10:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about guests at all. Like I said I look very much female, so I wouldn't have any problem being outed by my appearance. I'm more worried about LOD/ETLs seeing me walk in and/or out of the women's restroom and getting in trouble for it. Especially since they like to hover around the front a lot. I'll avoid telling you my area of work, just because I've already said in another post which state I live in and so I want to avoid people possibly narrowing down my identity, seeing as trans people are pretty rare, it probably would be too hard to do."

I thought you had the transition behind you and came out anyway.   There's no way corporate wants your HR ETL telling you to not use the front restrooms. I think you just have an ETL that doesn't know what they're talking about and they're improvising based on their gut feelings."

To my knowledge, you use whatever restroom you now identify yourself as. If you were a male who now identifies as female, use the women's restroom, vice versa.

I for one would question someone switching bathrooms, not to their face but to myself. You never know what someones intentions are. Call me rude but I wouldn't like someone faking being a transgender to use it for sexual harrasment and I'm sure the trans community hates when this happens as it sheds more unnecessary and bullshit light on them.

If they have a problem with it, they can explain to corporate why they are trying to segregate you out of the bathroom you are identified to use. That person is clearly not up to handling human resources correctly. Target has always been a very LGBT-ally corporation, and I believe a transcript of this convo would NOT be taken lightly. Honestly, I'd be livid if I were you, I admire your patience."

I'd say that's the only thing they value equal to or higher than guest amazement and profitable sales.  Was this a TL or ETL? I'm not saying it can't happen, but if Corporate caught wind of it they would at least get a final warning. Do you live in a podunk area?   Like the other person said, call the hotline."

I wouldn't really call them ""extremely inclusive"" seeing as they haven't bothered to edit their system at all to keep my legal name from showing up on the schedule everyone looks at."
Target,322cq1,isthisathrowaway2,2,Fri Apr 10 01:21:14 2015 UTC,"Well I meant the company as a whole, I'm sure there are many at individual stores that are not very inclusive.

Target,31olxy,CRZephyr,2,Wed Apr 8 02:44:27 2015 UTC,"You should try to convince your ETL to switch over your process to ""all-push,"" where every box is pushed onto the floor and checked before it is sent to backstock. This will reduce bottlenecking your speed off the trailer and will guarantee that the products are filled to their highest capacity on the floor. It will take the accumulator a few weeks to adjust, and scheduled autofills will be a bit large for a time, but after that your entire process will go much faster, and you won't have to worry about that app ever again. I have conclusive evidence from two stores in my area that all-push is the better option, and what ETL would say ""no"" to efficiency? :)"
Target,31oh0t,Bjamin24,4,Mon Apr 6 22:18:03 2015 UTC,"Lol hired in from outside can be overwhelming. Or so I've seen/heard.   So. You will learn all of this rather quick at work but:  Flow unloads, sorts and pushes the truck.   Instocks checks the floor for outs and helps correct incorrect on hand counts. Creates rainchecks. Some others. One of my least favorite roles. Did it for 2 years.  4x4 is checking one section of an aisle top to bottom for zone, correct pricepoints, printing tags and sale tags if needed. Cleaning and dusting.   HBA is Health and Beauty Aid.  Huddles usually are for the weeks and prior days metrics. Whether sales, redcards conversion and electronic attachments goals were met. Safety topics. Goals for the day, special sales, projects, etc.  Depends on your idea of comfortable. It will take you at least a month to get into the routines and remember them off the cuff. My advice, take notes. Write yourself an open and close list of tasks depending on your schedule."
Target,31oh0t,LeftySurprise,2,Mon Apr 6 23:02:48 2015 UTC,"Instocks doesn't do rain check pads anymore, I believe.  Our store stopped that mid last year."
Target,31oh0t,Crimson_Steel,3,Wed Apr 8 23:40:00 2015 UTC,"I got signed off as a senior team lead from a regular team member a few months ago.

Make due to visit the target break room forum to get a a good amount of resources."
Target,31oh0t,bucsfann20,3,Mon Apr 6 23:03:26 2015 UTC,"I can't answer all of these, but I'll do my best.   Flow is the morning crew responsible for the truck unload and stocked the boxes on the shelf. Most stores have their flow team come in before the store is open to work, although I've seen some people on here talking about how their flow team works in the middle of the day.   Instocks job is twofold: they scan empty and low spots in the store to both try and fill them (if we happen to have that item in the backroom and it just didn't get pulled or stocked, for whatever reason) or to let the accumulator know that the store is running out of an item.   I don't know much about price change, but I know that they handle marking down items that have gone to clearance and all that kind of stuff.   A ""rig"" is related to instocks. The accumulator (from my understanding; I'm actually not sure how rigs are generated) will have a list of items that it specifically wants scanned and counted by the instocks team, to confirm how many the store has. Each of these scanning tasks is a rig.   4x4 is the term for zoning and isle. The way it was explained to me is that you're supposed to be looking in a 4x4 area and make sure all the items there are pulled forward and faced correctly, then move on to the next 4x4 area, etc...  HBA is the term for the health and beauty aisles. These are all your shampoos, conditioners, toothpastes, etc.   As for what I look for in a huddle... Difficult to answer, I guess. A lot of the TLs go on about if we met sales yesterday, but that doesn't particularly affect me so I don't really care. You're also required to talk about safety topics every now and then, but those are all pretty repetitive and boil down to ""don't do stupid shit"". However, huddles are a good time to address good things that you see the team doing and give them a slight pat on the back for it. It seems kind of corny to do the whole recognition thing, but it often does feel good to know that your boss noticed some random thing you did to help someone else out or contribute in a way that isn't explicitly expected of you."
Target,31oh0t,targetAccount,2,Mon Apr 6 23:08:26 2015 UTC,"All of your direct questions are already answered, so I'll just leave you with this: If you're coming in from outside with no knowledge of how Target works, you're going to have a lot of stuff you'll need to learn really fast. And even then, you're going to be learning new things every day fro many years. The system and mechanism that make this store go are simply expansive. The best thing you can do for yourself is keep your eyes and ears open, don't assume you know better than your specialists, and let people who know what they're doing get on with it instead of trying to be a hero and being in their way. Figure out who has it together and give them the tools they need to get it done."
Target,31oh0t,FenrirSM,2,Tue Apr 7 10:59:47 2015 UTC,"Welcome to target!  As an instocks team member, I can provide a bit more insight to whats going on. Rigs usually drop every day for instocks, and those are locations that the gun tells the instocks tm to go to and count how many there are. So you will sometimes hear an LOD say 'Instocks, how many Rigs do you have on the gun'. For my store, it usually doesnt take longer than an hour to do.   HBA is health and beauty, basically where all the deodorants and shampoo is at.  At my store, 4x4 is when TMs/TLs partner up in one section of a store (usually around 8 - 10 isles) and straighten all the items out, and make sure that everything is in their right place. At target, we call this 'zoning'.  I cant tell you what the other roles do, since I was hired for instocks and remained in it (if you have any other questions regarding instocks feel free to ask). Apart from the Rigs, we are in charge of scanning the whole store (another word for scanning is shooting (ex: ""fr0st, shoot toys and electronics"")).  In huddles, my TLs usually talk about how the store did yesterday/a few days prior, and give recognitions (shoutouts) to whoever they feel deserves it (ex: I would like to give recognition to 'insert tm here' for getting 10 redcards in a 5 hour shift!).  As for how long it takes to get comfortable in an LOD role, I'm not sure but let me know when you do ;)"
Target,31oh0t,Fr0stSoldier,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"4x4 is more than just superzoning - you're checking signing, multiple locations, missing labels.  Also, greets from a fellow instocks. Be prepared, I'm seeing a lot of ""trials"" going on with instocks lately - I think things are going to change with the workcenter again soon."
Target,31oh0t,Crimson_Steel,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:38:50 2015 UTC,"trials? speak more of this, at my store its the standard rigs,research,ptms,drastic count report."

Our store is stopping full scans entirely, rigs only and we're taking over 4x4's from sales floor, with team leads taking over outs scans of their departments. I expect major replenishment issues to begin within a month of inventory (which is in a few weeks for us)."
Target,31oh0t,Crimson_Steel,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:48:10 2015 UTC,"In addition to the scans and rigs, instocks (at least in my store) handles MPG header labels, PTMs, and also the drastic count report. On mobile, but I can give you a more thorough explanation of those if desired."
Target,31oh0t,Crimson_Steel,0,Wed Apr 8 23:42:27 2015 UTC,"You should get comfortable pretty fast, most people get used to it in a week or two from my experience.  Some good terms to know on top of HBA: MMB is Movies Music and Books (depends on if the store is organized this way), 4x4 is a grid term for a deep zone where you make sure everything from labels, sales, to flexing (moving product to fill empty spaces) and recording everything that you find to be less than satisfactory. DTLs love to see 4x4 sheets being done properly.  Some more, PTM is Price Transition Merchandise, Decode/Deco'd is a general term for discontinued items, and one that might be exclusive to stores around me (not sure), ""the boat"" usually refers to the desk/display that are usually in electronics or sometimes Target Mobile or jewelry.   ESC/TSC is Employee/Team Service Center, the collective back area where you clock in, where the offices are, etc. Some of the area terms had me going ""wtf are they talking about"" for months."
Target,31na7o,Nikki1234,11,Mon Apr 6 17:08:23 2015 UTC,"Lowly cashier here.  Whether or not you think Target needs to back away from REDcards or not is irrelevant. As long as you work for Target you get paid to do what they decided. If they want REDcards, you work to get REDcards.   I would think that as a GSA, you should want to set an example for us lowly cashiers. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you set an upbeat, enthusiastic example, the cards will come in. Don't and they won't.  Personally, I don't need the announcements and you are correct in that I don't carry a walkie. I do know, however, that there are two cashiers in our store that actually care. Since December 1st, there hasn't been a week where one of the two of us hasn't led in REDcards. I am routinely beating out full-time cashiers and I work max 25 hours per week.  It's not hard. It's attitude. Change your attitude--especially when talking to the cashiers--and I think you'll be surprised how many more cards come in.  <<I know it sounds like I really drank the Kool-Aid, but it's what Target pays me for. I don't make the corporate decisions.>>"
Target,31na7o,pgh9fan,6,Mon Apr 6 17:25:53 2015 UTC,"I hate that you referred to yourself as a lowly cashier but I get what you're saying. It just feels like the team is patting themselves on the back for YOU all getting red cards but you all never hear it. But you're right about changing my attitude. It's just some days it's hard to do, lol"
Target,31na7o,pgh9fan,7,Mon Apr 6 17:31:22 2015 UTC,"I am a lowly cashier and I have no problem with that. Most of the team members in my store hate cashiering. When I applied I made it clear that it's all I wanted to do. No softlines, no hardlines, no Pfresh.   I did that because I 1) physically cannot zone as I had a couple of mini-strokes last fall and I get very woozy with all the up/down moving and 2) I like the cashiering.   I enjoy talking to the guests. I don't just ring them up, I visit with them. I have been at the Bullseye for six months now and I have several guests who will routinely look for me to ring them out.  That's how I get the REDcards.  As for patting themselves on the back for the cards I get, I would say that we all get them. If I get a REDcard, the whole team does. I can't do it without Pfresh pushing, hardlines zoning, HR doing the schedules etc.    As a GSA, you have a special position for us cashiers. Our GSAs, GSTL, GSETL, and even our STL often give me high fives and thank me for the REDcards I get. It's nice. Use your GSA status to thank the cashiers when they get a REDcard. Smile and say, ""Way to go!"" Our leaders get on the walkie and call us out when we get a REDcard. That way the STL knows. Our STL has gone out of her way to thank me. She only knew about it from the GSAs. That's where you come in."
Target,31na7o,Besnasty,6,Mon Apr 6 18:17:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe don't try to fake your enthusiasm about red cards, but focus more on how proud you truly are of each person. Its a hard task to get these numbers that truly none of us care about, so why pretend we actually care about those when you can focus on the people you do actually care about."
Target,31na7o,mrs_meeow,3,Mon Apr 6 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"As a GSA I don't necessarily find it annoying, but I forget to do it all the time. My LOD just really wants to stay on top of how many we have so that's basically the only reason to call out every hour. My issue is that I know the sales floor isn't asking guests about REDcards like they should or we would probably be getting more. Also, I feel like the electronics department isn't stepping up and getting enough. In the end it all falls back on the front end, but it really should be a team effort in selling them."
Target,31na7o,RomulanBacon,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:04:49 2015 UTC,Great suggestions!! And I really like the cartwheel move that you mentioned
Target,31na7o,monkeyman80,3,Mon Apr 6 21:53:42 2015 UTC,"As a GSA, I'll admit I stress a bit about conversions. In the end its just recognizing who got them, and hoping that your encouragement will help your team and reflect well on yourself.  We all have bad nights, but when we have good ones make sure the cashiers realize they accomplished something and that you are proud!"
Target,31na7o,not_a_banana,2,Tue Apr 7 04:51:46 2015 UTC,"as a cashier i hated the announcements. it always made me look like i was signing them up to make me look good. i tried to sell them it helps them, and i'd never push the cc and only debit."
Target,31na7o,CheesecakeDiscoParty,4,Mon Apr 6 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"The announcements are pointless. we're supposed to be trying to get redcards all the time right? so why the hourly announcements saying ""hey, don't forget to ask guest if they want a red card!"" does target think we are that dense?   So yeah, hourly announcements in my opinion are pretty much completely void of useful information. When I'm carrying a walkie and one of those announcements start I turn it down so I don't have to hear the same bullshit over and over again. and don't get me started on huddles."
Target,31na7o,LeftySurprise,3,Wed Apr 8 02:16:10 2015 UTC,"I think the immense focus on getting people to sign up for red cards is way too much. I too turn down my walkie when someone announces a team member got a red card because the barrage of over-enthusiastic ETLs who say good job is annoying, cringe worthy, and i can't help but imagine guests may find it odd if they hear that too. Every time someone nags over the walkie to everyone about getting more red cards, it doesn't make me try harder... if anything it makes me care less. That's not to say I don't ask guests if they would like one... I still get my share of em. But when I get nagged about getting more red cards, it doesn't change my method at all. The motiviations really only there when I know there's candy or something as a reward. What I also found amusing was recently I mentioned to a GSA how a red card I had gotten was under the target mobile team members number, because we use their numbers so they get the commission. The GSA was like ""don't you want it to count towards your total red card count though???"" And i asked at what amount of total red cards does something happen? Is there some sort of big reward when you reach a million or something? They then said ""oh I guess your right"". It's becoming like a brainwashing thing or something!"
Target,31mv2v,Latsu,16,Mon Apr 6 15:13:51 2015 UTC,Short answer: No.
Target,31mv2v,Digitalsalt,9,Mon Apr 6 18:46:20 2015 UTC,"Does it get easier? Yes, but it doesn't get any better. You will get faster at doing everything and you might be fast enough to be an over achiever or a huge slacker depending on what you want to do but it remains the same. Also zones are the only exception to the rule, those will never get done any faster after your first 2 weeks and LOD will still bitch at you for it not being done."
Target,31mv2v,acey901234,5,Mon Apr 6 15:31:40 2015 UTC,"I worked summers and winter breaks as a softlines team member for a couple of years in undergrad. You have to give up the perfectionist thing, and give it up fast. I was like that when I first started. Everything had to be perfect, and it just took waaaay to long. I would barely get anything done.   You have to learn that nothing is ever going to be perfect, especially when you are understaffed and underscheduled like me and my coworkers were. When you have 3 people left closing a whole softlines section after 5 PM every night you learn to cut corners where you can and focus on speed. My last summer there was better. We got a new STL and they changed up the way we did things/shifted our hours around so it was easier to get everything done, but the store was still NEVER perfect. And you just have to accept that.   If you're having a hard time now, in April, you should see what it is like around Black Friday and Christmas. It took weeks for my store to recover back to a normal level following the Christmas returns.  But after a few months, I did get way faster. Every summer coming back I learned the new layout and product faster. I ended up being one of the fastest reshoppers on my team by my second aummer. That part does get easier, once you learn the store and where things go, what the fastest reshop route is. It takes a month or two to get used to everything."
Target,31mv2v,RobotReptar,3,Mon Apr 6 16:06:10 2015 UTC,Our DTL came to our store at 230 AM on Black Friday to check our recovery...she expected that between the initial rush and a couple hours later we should have the store back in order. After walking around the store with our LOD we had a list of things to do before the next rush.

I've worked there since last April and I can safely say back to school, Halloween and Christmas were the worst lol. If it's hard for you now you should get out while you can.  signing does get easier after you do it once or twice. you have to get in the groove. I do signing for toys, electronics, sporting goods and seasonal every once in a while. What I do is stack a few aisles together if they're light, and I also set as many stacks on top of the files as I can for the aisles ahead. It's kinda weird but it shows me how much I have left to go and encourages me to move faster lol"
Target,31mv2v,siiberiia,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:24:12 2015 UTC,Halloween and Christmas... we don't talk about that around here!
Target,31mv2v,gettindemdownvotes,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:44:17 2015 UTC,Thems devil words.
Target,31mv2v,NhvK,1 point,Thu Apr 16 09:09:35 2015 UTC,Ptm and flex are the two words I hate hearing with a passion
Target,31mv2v,ZacharyW1993,2,Sat May 2 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"Well first, it won't always be perfect. Especially if you're a busy store. There will always be a guest to come behind you and fuck up an aisle that you had perfect ( I zone toys nightly so I know from expierence) So don't kick your self if it's not perfect. Zoning/reshop/pulls all get easier once you find a routine and get familiar with the product. You're still kinda new so just give it time. Reshop/pulls will eventually become second nature& that will give you more time to zone. Just keep doing your best and eventually you'll start to get the hang of it."
Target,31mv2v,iamDJDan,2,Mon Apr 6 16:47:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, so i'm my store's only signing team member, and I will tell you that doing it for 1 day is no indication of anything. Signing is a lot, but it's really easy tbh. However it's a learning curve. There's a lot to stay on top of and a lot to learn. So if you're continuing on signing I will tell you to give it time. Things get easier as you learn them just like in anything else. One month is not that long and you'll get better. :)"
Target,31mv2v,JustDoodling,2,Mon Apr 6 21:52:01 2015 UTC,"I have worked in retail for over a decade and I recently left Target after over eight years there. Retail can get monotonous very quickly, just for the sake of variety. I would seek an available chance to cross train in other areas. I did this and ended up working in hardlines, electronics, I presentation, signing, flow, and backroom during my time there."
Target,31mv2v,RE687,2,Mon Apr 6 22:45:19 2015 UTC,"It does. I worked my way into electronics from hardlines then into grocery then into the meat and dairy department, easiest paycheck I've ever made. Stock milk, look for old food, do some more stocking, sit in the cooler for a few hours browsing reddit then zone my area in an hour, go home. I'm not saying do this but I worked hard for 2 years at that store to be able to slack to the extent I did."
Target,31mv2v,The_WubWub,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:13:20 2015 UTC,Just turn your mind off and get through it.
Target,31mv2v,gettindemdownvotes,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:44:56 2015 UTC,"If no one is communicating how bad you're doing, you aren't doing bad. Supervisors lack praise. It costs part of their souls. Criticisms, however, are free. So if you get none, there is nothing to be critical about."
Target,31mv2v,FenrirSM,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:10:40 2015 UTC,sounds like you'll get better at what you do with experience. there will always be a lot to do that you don't have support to finish. some can manage the chaos. some can't.
Target,31mv2v,monkeyman80,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:13:23 2015 UTC,It'll great way easier as time goes on.  Will it get better?  The short answer: no. The long answer: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
Target,31kk1b,bananawallet,12,Sun Apr 5 23:48:05 2015 UTC,Talk to your TL and ETL. We used to have them a lot. Then for a while we would only let them buy things if they also got an attachment.   We don't allow them anymore though I'm not 100% sure on the reasoning.
Target,31kk1b,littlecircle,2,Mon Apr 6 00:12:20 2015 UTC,Also talk to AP.
Target,31kk1b,Kehndy12,2,Mon Apr 6 05:32:11 2015 UTC,I am AP which is why I forgot to mention that haha. This is definitely an AP+Electronics partnership.
Target,31kk1b,littlecircle,8,Mon Apr 6 06:37:06 2015 UTC,"Other than limiting quantities, there really isn't anything you can do while also following best practice.  Of course, if certain items go missing when you see them walking down the aisle, that's just bad luck for them."
Target,31kk1b,pohatu771,8,Mon Apr 6 01:05:43 2015 UTC,"It depends on the reseller for me honestly. You get 2 different types, one who don't give a shit and are just trying to make money, and ones who know what they are doing as far as trying to work the store by being upfront about getting attachments.  I ran into this this past week. Guy wanted to get as many PS4s as we'd allow. Instantly knew he was a reseller but just incase that didn't set of the alarm in my head, he said I'll get one of the cheapest attachments per system since I know it will help you guys out. At that point I know it's a pretty experienced reseller.  Now you shouldn't just make a decision on your own, I talked to my LOD that night and being new and not very engaged in electronics she went with a generic one per guest. Myself? I would've gone a limit of 7. We had 15 on hand (never tell them) and that would get us some AAR love while keeping plenty of quantity for guests. I talked to my TL about it as he's rather new and wanted to know his opinion and he had a similar one to mine. Being brand, you don't want to give them your whole quantity otherwise you're preventing sales to guests who aren't resellers. But he was fine about me selling 6 or 7 since that would have been less than half, as long as they were getting things to help our AAR. A you scratch your back we scratch yours type of situation.  So all in all, I'd get your TL in charge of electronics and the ETL who's in charge of Hardlines (and therefor electronics) opinions on it.  But whenever in doubt just call the LOD of the night. Explain the situation and that they will be getting attachments with it and let them decide. Most resellers are cool about it. The guys I helped I talked with for a while and they showed me a video on their phone from pre-christmas that showed their inventory and it was pretty remarkable. They know it's the manager decision, not yours and if they limit it to just 1 or 2 they won't be mad, they'll just move on to the next store."
Target,31kk1b,dubblechzburger,6,Mon Apr 6 01:15:24 2015 UTC,"""Not mad"" is the total opposite of every reseller I (knowingly) deal with. Most come in ready to argue. There is one couple who wipe out our clearance games every week, and the man won't talk to me, but sends his wife to try to flirt her way into better deals."
Target,31kk1b,pohatu771,3,Mon Apr 6 02:30:55 2015 UTC,"Man I guess I should consider myself lucky because ice dealt with probably 3 resellers personally and they've all been good situations. One guy literally said take a game or 2 per system, it's such a deal I'll still make money off of it"
Target,31kk1b,dubblechzburger,2,Mon Apr 6 02:50:47 2015 UTC,"Well look at it this way, you're allowed to (or your respective TL is) deny to resell to them, or limit how many they buy. If they're an ass you can push it up the chain and be done with it. I usually fill in the Senior Team Leads when stuff like this happens and they act appropriately. Giving into resellers that aren't nice doesn't get anyone anywhere; the product would be sold eventually anyways."
Target,31kk1b,AMBocanegra,6,Fri Apr 10 03:41:31 2015 UTC,"Depends on the store. Find out how your leaders feel. At my store if we suspect they are resellers, we make them purchase 3 attachments with each phone."
Target,31kk1b,LeftySurprise,4,Mon Apr 6 01:40:52 2015 UTC,I could never get say with that. My leaders bend over backward for any guest with a big purchase... And then come after me when AAR is low.
Target,31kk1b,pohatu771,2,Mon Apr 6 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"Well you have shitty leaders, HQ is doing away with AAR as a metric they really grade. It'll still be there, but it's not what they really grade your store on."
Target,31kk1b,rh51too,2,Tue Apr 7 08:03:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly how my store is. I got ""talked to"" about aar recently, after being told they were doing away with aar. My score was low because I work almost every sunday and monday morning, which is when the resellers come in to buy us out of our stock on sunday, and again when we get a truck on monday. My team lead lets them buy our quantity and its never made sense to me."
Target,31kk1b,pr4xis,4,Thu Apr 9 21:21:17 2015 UTC,I don't have anything in the way of advice technically but I was really nice to this group of three resellers and they wound up buying 56 attachments in the form of gift cards. My electronics team has been in the green for like a month haha.
Target,31kk1b,DonyaFox,3,Mon Apr 6 03:34:37 2015 UTC,"We have one particular reseller who comes in every few weeks... He'll buy 50 phones card per phone. Usually ends up doing 2-3 transaction of minimum $10,000 when he comes in.  When I was still in Electronics, he was my favorite. Knew exactly what he was doing, had all the information prepared ahead of time. Only thing that sucked was ringing up $20,000+ worth of phone cards, and tendering out his transactions (Always paid with gift cards)."
Target,31kk1b,Isak922,2,Mon Apr 6 03:59:58 2015 UTC,"Limit their quantities, force them to buy attachments on their core items, and prohibit them from using any kind of coupon or discount. If your entire team sticks to this policy, they'll stop coming to your store in no time."
Target,31kk1b,anyquestions,2,Mon Apr 6 10:28:00 2015 UTC,"My store actually used to have this reseller who every time he'd come in he'd nearly wipe us out of apple products, but then he'd also buy a shit ton of iTunes and App Store cards so our AAR would skyrocket. But my favorite reseller interaction was back right after the security breach happened and we were offering 10% off your entire purchaser this weekend (except on a couple electronics items) and this guy comes in, and he asks for every xbox360, every ps3, and almost ever 3ds we had. Asked the lod, and she said it was fine because we'd be making sales. And then the guy has the 5% off coupon from filling out prescriptions with a red card or whatever, and his red card. So, after his tax exemption, discounts and everything  what would have been around $35k was just about $27k which I thought was awesome"
Target,31kk1b,Taco_Baron,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:50:43 2015 UTC,Thank you everyone for your advice! I don't know it just doesn't seem like it should be legal to me
Target,31kk1b,Bab5crusade,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:13:12 2015 UTC,"My store is near Canada.  The Canadian resellers are just not a pain for electronics, but also our grocery department.  As an GSA. I had to argue with resellers on how much 12 packs of soda they can buy all the time."
Target,31kk1b,monkeyman80,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:38:04 2015 UTC,"dtl gave us our guidlines. you get reseller, no giftcards. or you get one for personal use."

Target,31fz69,Grifkilla51,6,Sat Apr 4 18:49:14 2015 UTC,"I dont know what brickseek is but i take it there is likely a display model for this item.  Most TV's, for example, have an 'on hand' that is one higher then the saleable quantity until the model goes discontinued or clearance when the display can be sold.  Basic definitions:  Saleable quantity is the amount available for sale  On Hand Qty is the total within the store  Their are also large discrepancies with bikes as they are only saleable after being built in store but on hand as soon as the box with the parts arrives.  best bet is to call the store and inquire, if you have the DPCI it makes tracking down the specific item much easier."
Target,31fz69,DrMoomoo,2,Sat Apr 4 19:23:58 2015 UTC,Bikes and TVs are a good point.
Target,31fz69,pohatu771,3,Sat Apr 4 19:25:45 2015 UTC,"That's the term we use. I've never seen ""saleable"" used."
Target,31fz69,pohatu771,2,Sat Apr 4 19:12:15 2015 UTC,"Here's what it says, you think i'll be able to walk in and buy it? I heard on hand means that it's reserved by a employee on a another site or something like that. http://imgur.com/bFtmobQ"
Target,31fz69,pohatu771,4,Sat Apr 4 19:20:32 2015 UTC,"The only reason I could see an item listed as not saleable is if it was ordered for store pickup and has not been picked up yet.  I don't know how Brickseek gets their information, but it's not going to be perfect. Our in-store information isn't perfect, and especially this time of year, just weeks before inventory.  If a guest asks for an item, and another store says they have one, I don't say it's in stock because it's not that reliable.  Why don't you just say what item and store it is and someone can find out."
Target,31fz69,AforAnarchist,2,Sat Apr 4 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"Just fyi, its always almost inventory for some stores. Its spread thoughout the year."

Target,31bwu4,Ozymandias824,13,Fri Apr 3 17:29:40 2015 UTC,"Depending on the volume of your store, your job is either going to be miserable or decent.   If you have a cart pusher the best tip i can give you is start with small lines (maybe 10-15 carts) and work your way up. Just make sure you do what you're comfortable with.  There will come a day where you have to clean up shit or puke off the floor. You can try to avoid it all you want but it will happen lol.   Also get used to being under apreciated..."
Target,31bwu4,vPikajew,3,Fri Apr 3 18:02:56 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who gets ~40 carts on the mover and then pretend it is a snake to keep it from bending/under control?  (Yes, I know the limit is 25 but as long as you don't get stalled somewhere the mover has no problem pushing that many)"
Target,31bwu4,n0rsk,4,Wed Apr 15 02:43:04 2015 UTC,Yea snaking it is the best technique to doing a lot of carts. My record is 51 and that thing curved wider than kim kardashian's ass. After ~32 is when it starts getting more difficult to control

Target,31bwu4,niggerfaget666,6,Sun Apr 19 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"It's 100% dependent on the store. My store is pretty great and a really relaxed environment, but I can see how it could easily be miserable. At my store you're allowed to push 25 on the machine and 7 by hand max, make sure you don't go over that (at least while you're new). I'd suggest starting with less, like 15 or so until you're totally comfortable with the machine, which honestly isn't hard to use at all. You'll be running around A LOT, doing basically everything that people need (carry out, hangers, reshop, go get this, go get that, etc) so wear comfortable shoes. Presumably you'll start your first few days with a trainer; listen to what they have to say."
Target,31bwu4,nohitter21,3,Fri Apr 3 18:36:34 2015 UTC,"I got hired as a cashier 3 months ago and got bored of standing in the lanes for 40 hours a week, so I got trained on cart attendant officially today. (thought I've been pushing carts for 2+ weeks since another attendant was asked to leave)  I love being outside and walking around. I don't mind cleaning up a couple grocery spills and the bathrooms are generally clean. Cart machine is easy to use (I just learned today and was pushing 20 at a time easily.)  I walk an average of 13-17 miles per day doing it during an 8 hour shift.  On the busier days I know I'll be stressing a little more but on the mild to chill days, it's a wonderful job."
Target,31bwu4,spearmintnickers,2,Tue Apr 7 04:29:01 2015 UTC,"I started out as a cart attendant and then moved to service desk. It's going to suck some days, but now that I'm a GSA (the person watching the front) I miss being a cart attendant sometimes. It's a great way to get a reputation as the go-to guy, which can be great or pretty bad. The best advice I can give is work hard and get on your GSA's good side"

Pretty much the same for everyone else unless you're scheduled til 1130. During holiday time if it's bad they'll ask if you want to stay until 11:30 to help but it's not required."

Target,30y102,dubblechzburger,2,Wed Apr 1 18:53:41 2015 UTC,I noticed you said you don't have an overnight time so I wonder if that's it. Overnight zones certain areas of the store so it's not necessary to get the whole store done.
Target,30y102,cody2isdown,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:14:07 2015 UTC,I suppose that's very possible. We have to have the zone 100% or at least try. But there is many nights were abandons and the zone are terrible. I feel like if this is case we should have more than just 1-2 closers for every department
Target,30y102,LeChiotx,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:19:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah overnight zones toys/sporting goods, housewares/furniture, grocery and H&B.

Target,30y102,LieutenantKaiya,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:21:35 2015 UTC,That must be fucking nice. We zone our ENTIRE supertarget. . Which is always top 5 in the nation. It is a goddamn nightmare.
Target,30y102,LieutenantKaiya,4,Thu Apr 9 07:25:39 2015 UTC,I'm a  GSTL and the store leaves when I finish closing and registers and have the bundles in the safe. Typically 15 minutes after close. The LODs kinda go by how fast we get it done not the floor (excluding 4th quarter) . However the other GSTL doesn't start his close until after the store is closed so when he is scheduled they don't leave until 45 minutes ... X.x
Target,30y102,LieutenantKaiya,2,Tue Mar 31 18:25:56 2015 UTC,"My store closes at 12, but if we have a closing shift the schedule always is until 12:15. If we had a busy night and the zones still aren't 100% by 12:15, we'll stay later until a TL says we're okay to go. Latest I ever had to stay was 12:45am."

Target,30y102,gordogg24p,2,Tue Mar 31 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"I assuming that it's lack of people. My store has also been doing like 20,000+ over sales at least. I only have 3 people every night in softlines and that's including operator. And only one day side"
Target,30y102,Paprika_Six,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"One day side softlines team member?! I couldn't imagine surviving the day, then again my store is really high volume so there wouldn't be a softlines if only one person was working it. It would just be...ground zero."
Target,30y102,Paprika_Six,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:07:10 2015 UTC,It is ground zero.. we're extremely behind on work load and it constantly looks trashed. We're not a super store but were just as high volume of super stores.

Target,30y102,LeftySurprise,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:29:47 2015 UTC,All cashiers leave after the last guest. They never push any reshop.. ever. And usually zoning and we barely finish. Softlines reshop doesn't even get touched after like 6 unless it's a really good night

We can't drink beer while doing it"". I then told him I would bring some and he brushed me off.   Next day, which was April 1st. He's at the door letting in the morning crew and here I come with a cooler that says ""Beer box"" filled with that glass bottle root beer and ice. In my hand, I have a brown bag wrapped around one that I had been drinking. I'm the last to walk in and he sees me and his jaw drops. I open the top of the cooler and asks if he wants his now or latter. He stutters and I said just let me know when he does and I walk in.

Target,30qfd0,hollowdonut,3,Sun Mar 29 20:38:40 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the wonders of limited payroll.  It depends on the store, but March and April are usually bad when it comes to hours. Each work center is allowed a certain number of hours, and it's divided up however management sees as best.  It's likely nothing against you. It's possible there's more work needed to be done elsewhere, or some new TMs.  Edit: some stores also simply don't find replacements for shifts. I know mine didn't for a while during the slower months.  Talk with your TL/ETL-LOG  Edit 2: also, swap board, cross training, and getting yourself known by the ETLs. When the schedule goes out, I average about 22 hours, but I can usually end the week with 30+. I was hired as a cashier, but now I do weekly ad setup and the occasional odd job shift (salesfloor, pulls, etc)"

Thanks for the heads up about the March/April hours, though. I know that February at my store was a terrible month for hours because I was told so by my TL. He also told me that when March came back around I would start getting more hours, which I did, but I didn't expect to see my numbers start dwindling back down mid-March.  That sucks. I guess retail is retail. It's unpredictable for the most part(?).  edit: Yeah and sometimes the sales floor TL would ask of me to stay longer to help push when their are huge CAFs and little to no one on the sales floor. Of course I take them up on their offer. I'll just have to find a way to make myself more known and available to not just the backroom. Thanks.

Target,30mbyl,SoulCrystal,6,Sat Mar 28 18:14:17 2015 UTC,Ours are going into effect April 19th. They are tied to our reviews so they are informing everyone when they are giving reviews. I'm a GSA and I didn't anything extra besides what came from my review but that could be because of the fact that I already make more then a typical starting GSA. I assume they have to raise the GSA wage since it's an N07 so it should still be the 50 cents more than a cashier's wage.
Target,30mbyl,mrs_meeow,2,Sat Mar 28 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"exactly. The starting rate for each paygrade increased. If you are already over the new minimum you will not see a raise, anyone else would get a raise to hit the new minimum amount."
Target,30mbyl,AforAnarchist,3,Sat Mar 28 19:51:07 2015 UTC,"I also have a question. Will GSAs/Electronics receive a pay raise to be proportional. I know the answer is no with mandatory state minimum wage increases, but since this is sort of voluntary I thought it might be different."
Target,30mbyl,RomulanBacon,2,Sat Mar 28 18:35:56 2015 UTC,"No, just people who make under $9 an hour I believe. But I could be wrong."

A few team members who have been with Target for more than five years at my store are now making the same (or less, depending on performance reviews) than people who started in the last year."

Target,30mbyl,siiberiia,6,Sat Mar 28 22:45:34 2015 UTC,"Should be 9.50. That's because of the fact that different areas of the store are different pay grades. Cashiers are N03 (I think) which is the lowest one. One step up would be people like price change , photo(when we had someone staffing it) and Starbucks which are N05. They make $.25 more than an N03. Next is an N07 which is GSA and I'm assuming electronics since you say you make $.50 more. Therefore, starting pay rates should be $9, 9.25, and 9.50. Unless you are already earning above the new starting pay for an electronics team member they should up your pay to that."

Since the time clock has a wrong punch, you won't get paid until you do a punch correction (sometimes HRs are nice and fix it for you, but don't depend on them to).

Target,30b040,Fr0stSoldier,3,Wed Mar 25 23:10:16 2015 UTC,"Softlines Brand TM here. The major tasks for a Softlines TM are reshop and zoning within the department. It's good to know where everything is and what things look like, because oftentimes you will get a call from a guest who has a vague description of a specific item they're looking for and they won't have a DPCI or UPC. You might also become more acquainted with the fitting room and operating, in case your operator needs a break.  Zoning: folding, putting things in the right place, in the right order by size, and finger spacing the hangers...which is a real nice touch and it'll be sure to impress your TLs. You'll be doing most of this while closing.  People in my department are also called for backup to the front checklanes often, so be ready and willing to help out whenever necessary."

I'm a TL and the question that stumps the most people is basically ""tell me an improvement you can work on""... Never say ""I have none"" do something simple like ""sometimes I come off mean but I'm a very blunt person. Though I am working on fixing that"" ... State something simple but also start on how you acknowledge and are fixing it.   Also there are some TLs and ETLs (managers) that ask their own questions not on the sheet. As GSTL (front end manager) I talk about the red card and our weekly quotas and daily tasks... Also of a person has a second job I always do the ""them or us"" question  Either way nothing to hard.

Can't even keep microscopic bacteria out of their systems.  /s  Looks like you can take care of your body just fine and got the help you needed.
Target,2zyhvx,KatterpodOnRye,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:56:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it varies by store, but I worked at mine for almost 5 years and in my last month or so, the GSA asked me to sign up for a THEEE HOUR CASHIER SHIFT because someone got scheduled during class (caps to prove my anger) two weeks in advance.  I completely forgot about it.  The GSTL told me she didn't call me because they had several cashiers already. (Small store.  She said they had 5 cashiers when typically we have two.) So she said it wasn't a big deal.  However, my Team Lead approached me and told me that she no longer does warnings and that it counts against me, and is now on my record, without taking into consideration that I worked there nearly 5 years and called in TWO TIMES.  One because a family member passed away, and one because of a huge blizzard and my car didn't start.  (Live 30 minutes away during good weather.)  I was so pissed.  I KNOW it was my mistake that I made, but that's how I feel.  Such a huge consequence for something so little.    I didn't mean to rant, but I'd say that you should bring it up with your TL and see what their store policy is.  Maybe they won't do anything at all aside from a warning."
Target,2zyhvx,that-bot,2,Mon Mar 23 01:13:25 2015 UTC,"Ha, no worries it's understandable.   That's strange though they just didn't call you just because there was plenty of cashiers already, so it wasn't a ""big deal"". It may have not been a big deal for the store, but it definitely was for you.   We're held accountable for our own schedule, so of course we know it's our mistake, but it still hurts. Especially, when it puts our job at risk. That's a shame though too considering you were covering a shift for a team member that couldn't make it & your team was larger than usual that day."

Target,2zy418,Latsu,3,Sun Mar 22 22:11:04 2015 UTC,"When leadership writes the schedules, that information is nowhere to be found. You'll be scheduled based on your availability and their need for you. Unless the ETL who writes your schedules is willing to personally keep your request in mind (very unlikely), that'll be the case.  From their point of view, if you're not absolutely flexible, they'd rather someone in your place who is. Try to approach your Sales Floor ETL and see what they say. If that doesn't fly, you can submit an availability change and request a couple days off a week, but keep in mind that leadership can and will deny availability changes based on their scheduling needs.  If I were in your ETL's shoes (lowly TL here) and you approached me saying what you did in the post, I'd schedule you parallel to a team trainer so you could fully learn the ropes. Hardlines can be tough, but even more so when you're still learning everything."
Target,2zy418,anyquestions,2,Sun Mar 22 22:30:06 2015 UTC,That's really dumb. I guess I'm probably better off trying to find a different part time job then. Going to keep applying to places if that's the case.

She is literally the worst gsa I had. Swore all the time. Called in. Left the front lanes to talk in softlines.  What's worst is that cashiers and lods came to me when she wasn't their. So I had all the responsibility but no pay.
Target,2zw2du,ChocolatePopes,13,Tue Mar 24 08:04:50 2015 UTC,"In our store, you need to apply for any open position. Simply saying you're interested is nothing."
Target,2zw2du,pohatu771,2,Sun Mar 22 13:23:27 2015 UTC,sometimes the positions aren't offered internal. we had a gsa hired when i was qualified that was out of target and horrible. they fired her asap. i had to wait out transfers and other stuff.   i have a tm i want to be gsa. she doesn't get the relationships with etl's that i feel will help her.   outside hires have a lot better chance of management than internal hires.

Do you feel that any of the ETL'S or HR don't like you?  I can give you a pointer for the future. Ask your ETL GE why you were not at least given an internal interview, and what you can do in their eyes to change that for next time. Ask what they feel your opportunities are. They usually respond well to that. It shows that you want to work on your development."

When it comes to redcards i can easily get 2 a shift at guest services, maybe more on the weekends if there is a midshift. Honestly though i think its because they couldnt lose anyone at guest services. The new girl they hired is not very smart, she put the paper you scan when someone wants to pay on their red card through the check scanner instead of the actual check"

I've seen ppl quit after going to GSA and gstl because the stress and workload was more than they felt it was worth. And once you go up, there's no going back down unless it's a good reason like school. If you can't cut it, they'll coach and CCA you until you quit or get fired.  Just go have a chat with your GE like I suggested and see what they say. Generally they will be very honest with you. Tell them you are very interested in expanding your development. Rarely will they come to you and offer.   Best of luck. It sounds like you've got the right attitude to make it."
Target,2zw2du,LeftySurprise,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:19:17 2015 UTC,Did you apply for the position under the internal job offers? You normally have to apply and interview for promotions. The difference isn't huge between a cashier and a GSA but it's still considered a supervisory position.

I've seen piss poor ETL'S and I've seen awesome ETL'S. The piss poor ones get overloaded and end up taking an LOA until they find another job. The good ones hang in the comfort zone. Usually an E or EX review. Then there's the awesome ones. In my 7 years I've seen two. One went from SRTL to STL. And one went from SRTL all the way to Group Leader.   The only one bullshit ting here is you. There's a reason you were an ETL and are no longer with the company. Your attitude probably has alot to do with it."

So we have the 3 cups in the holder displaying them in front of the register. Now we either cut out the bottom completely or put holes in the bottom. I myself fancied the smiley face or sad face back then or spelling out NO.  At this point they were all just cut out and this little somali kid about 6 to 8 somewhere in that age grabs one. My coworker and I were both around 21/22 so we were messing around having a good time so we just watched his sad look when it didn't work then pop flowed into the cup and right out the bottom. So we put another one out thinking that was it and cut it out again. 5 minutes later he tries again so we watch again to see the same result.  So this time just incase he tries it again we puncture 5 small holes. One in the middle then the rest 4 corners style. Either he was too dumb or didn't notice because yet again 10 minutes later he's back to try again. To his delight, the cup seems to be working, only to find out when he picked the cup up, it started leaking everywhere. Partly on the counter (it was funny enough we didn't care we had to clean it up) but also starts getting on him as well.  Worked there for 2 or 3 years and all of the closers were guys between 18-22 and our Food Ave was super chill back then so I'm sure there's plenty more stories I could think of.

I spoke to the girl at Food Ave later to fill in the gaps from what i saw but it was glorious.  A man who identified himself as a health inspector just walked back into the food prep area without any concern and demanded to be given a tour.  The girl who had no idea how to react to this asked him to stop while she called the GSTL over, 'inspector' was furious at this but obliged.  The GSTL comes over, ask's for ID to prove who he is and he gets all sort of indignant at this and reluctantly hands over a card, from what i heard the GSTL wasn't that persuaded by this card.  So he asked again for this man to hold on while he calls the STL to officiate what actually going on.  The STL shows up and greats the man kindly(this is when i showed up), but he is fucking livid, shouting about how he is an officer of the state and how disrespected he was been. My STL is incredibly calm given the circumstances constantly apologizing, yet very firm in needing to know the details of what is going on and identifying who this man is.   The 'inspector' is yelling almost incoherently at this point about how he has been asked for ID three times now(the first girl asked for it too, i missed that in my re-reading of this).  I am not the only person watching this unfold anymore.  STL asked him to stay calm and this can be worked out but if he cannot do that he will be asked to leave.  If you are not familiar whit the structure of Targets AP program you may not understand how integrated it is with local police programs, this 'inspector' was not so well informed.  About this time i decided that it was now or never, so i went outside to have my cigarette break.  A Police cruiser passed by the smoking benches with a familiar face in the back before i returned.  I never asked and am probably not privy to the information if i ever did,  but me and the Food ave girl don't think that guy actually had a real inspectors licence."

At UPS I may have to abide by some corporate rules that no one likes but at least I'm not knowingly selling someone a potentially dangerous product.   As a college student with time on my hands I've got the pick of the litter in terms of choosing an entry level position I do for a few hours a week. Target was just the first to call me back and it would inconvenience me to leave."
Target,2zmsie,LeftySurprise,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:30:29 2015 UTC,"Lol they are 100% right. Your attitude will not help you and you can expect lots of coaching and CCA if you don't change it. You work for target, get with their program or find another job."
Target,2zmsie,LeftySurprise,2,Fri Mar 20 23:17:57 2015 UTC,Some people tend to think they're entitled to a job despite the employers requirements. They never last long. Don't want to push redcards or give amazing guest service? Kick rocks and move on to another job. Perhaps walmart? Lol
Target,2zmsie,finnylauren,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:28:49 2015 UTC,Obviously you don't like Target so why don't you just quit? Don't waste your time (or Target's time) if you are just going to bitch about their policies. Like you said- you can find a different job. Target can also find an employee who will actually do what is asked of them without complaining.
Target,2zmsie,Jmoretta,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:41:35 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to them, they have been working retail too long to be nice. All Target cares about is money, red cards equal more money. If they have to nag all their cashiers to bug every guest they will do it.   @finnyLauren I'm sure you love your job right, I mean making coffee for people seems rough. If you've worked retail for more than a day I'd have to say you complained about something. Don't be a hypocrite. http://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/2x515p/whos_your_stores_most_obnoxious_regular_and_whats/cox5tsw?context=3"
Target,2zmsie,LeftySurprise,0,Tue Mar 24 19:33:18 2015 UTC,"lol yeah I'm not listening at all. It's sad seeing all the target managers telling me to quit, I'm a bad employee, I'm wasting time, etc. just because I didn't like the idea of pushing the redcard. You know your life isn't going anywhere when you spend your free time bitching out disgruntled employees on an internet forum.   Because everyone loves their jobs all the time, never complains ever ever ever, and it's all sunshine and roses all the time /s"
Target,2zmsie,Heavykiller,2,Sun Mar 22 02:40:05 2015 UTC,"It's not your place to question pushing redcards. Target is able to stay in business and compete with the big blue giant because of the programs they push. Guest loyalty and superb guest service.   Retail does not seem to be where you want to be. You can either do as your leaders ask, or you can get another job. There's a 1000 people waiting to fill your position in this economy."
Target,2zmsie,LeftySurprise,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:17:32 2015 UTC,"I used to think the same way at first, but now I just add it apart of my dialogue. Just tell them, ""Hey, how's it going/ find everything okay?"" as usual & throw the whole ""Do you happen to have a redcard with us?"" and if not tell them they can save 5%. End.   I like to get that part over with as quick as possible because sometimes I used to feel like I'd be 'betraying' them if I was having an actual conversation with the guest and just threw that at them. This way, you still make sure to ask for Red Cards & can continue with the conversation afterwards without making it seem like that whole conversation you had with them was just to soften them up to make them sign up for one.   Your answer has been pretty much answered here, but no worries. As long as your leader knows your asking, job isn't at risk at all. They know you getting a red card isn't guaranteed 100%, but as long as they know you're asking it's okay.   It's retail though, man. You're not going to like it, but money is what most of us are there for. Maybe it's because your fresh still, but when you've been there for a bit the whole process is easy and even though the whole red card thing may seem like shit(I still think it's crap), it's as simple as getting a ""No/yes"" response and continuing on with your bagging and conversation.   Maybe after some time see if you can get cross-trained to the floor or something. Generally, if you're hired on the floor, there's less pressure on you for getting red cards when you're up at the front."

I know the pain but it's nice having good gsa/gstl that understands y'all are working very hard. Keep the good work up and hopefully you become that GSA!

Target,2zdxxk,Noob_tuba23,3,Wed Mar 18 06:48:38 2015 UTC,"I for one absolutely appreciate everything you do as a Cart Attendant. I was one back in the day and it is literaly your job to do all the crap nobody else wants to. Try to get some more salesfloor shifts and show your stuff out there. Get noticed, or try to find someone willing to take you under their wing. When you're working hard nonstop noone notices you, trust me. Sit with the right people in the breakroom, make the right connections, you can get any job you want. It's all about having the right people vouch for you when the time comes. Always remember that at Target."

Target,2zdxxk,lockwasher,2,Wed Mar 18 06:51:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, that last sentence confused me a bit... do you make $13/hr? I worked for Target for 5 years, left as a GSA and still didn't make more than $10/hr.   But seriously, I feel you. I started as carts/cashier and worked my way all over the front end and everywhere else in the store (except AP and pharmacy) and I can certainly tell you carts are the most under appreciated job in the store. Although, I was really lucky that I had an STL who felt like it was everybody's job to keep the store clean. If he was there and someone called for me to come get a spill he would call them out over walkie and tell them to clean it up themselves. That was always fun."
Target,2zdxxk,DRM_ghost,2,Wed Mar 18 14:20:06 2015 UTC,Im at 9.50/hr since my states minimum wage is 9. It mist be nice having an STL who understood that!

Target,2zf1fv,50ShadezofWILL,2,Wed Mar 18 01:00:31 2015 UTC,"TPS doesn't do apprehensions unless they are there to assist APS or ETL AP You have a routine checklist to complete everyday, you just fill the extra time watching cameras/doors or the floor. A normal day consists of you finishing your routines and then walking the floor. It's all supplied through target."
Target,2zf1fv,sajey,2,Wed Mar 18 02:21:04 2015 UTC,"If you're a regular TPS then no. Most of the time should be spent on the salesfloor, you can be at the front if your store is high volume/high theft, but otherwise you'll be where the high cost/ high risk merchandise is. What you can expect depends heavily on what type of store you work at. I've heard of places where TPS barely get to do any AP work and are really weird hybrid salesfloor team members, then there are TPS that work in high theft stores in which case aside from your core routines (key audits, equipment control, PIT, daily cards, etc) you will be detering theft, recovering merchandise via PMR techniques, or you'll get some occasional apprehensions with your AP leader. The uniform (which apparently is changing next month) is supplied to you. Although if you're lucky you'll get to use your own shoes and pants, its way more comfortable   ***Overall AP can definitely be pretty interesting, but its going to vary from store to store. Just make sure to really ask lots of questions during your training and once you're on the floor in uniform, dont be afraid to experiment with different ideas. You'll learn with time"
Target,2zf1fv,DannyDawg,2,Wed Mar 18 03:41:49 2015 UTC,"A TPS does not conduct apprehensions. Senior TPS and above does (although they are discontinuing the senior TPS position) You will be able to assist, go hands on, handcuff, etc as long as your etl-ap, senior, or APS is there to make the call.   Uniforms are provided. Target is about to switch to a blue polo and khaki pants for TPS's. The full uniforms might be available for a bit longer.   Target is revamping the TPS position a lot lately, trying to make it more routine based. It would all depend on the store and the leader what you do."

Target,2zc1m0,rumplexx,2,Tue Mar 17 20:07:12 2015 UTC,That rule is a Target-wide safety rule. Although we still have the clunky metal carts and not those fancy lightweight plastic ones. Maybe it's easier to push more of those since they are lighter.

Target,2z6mb2,omnamename,2,Mon Mar 16 01:13:35 2015 UTC,Especially the very inaccurate union videos. A lot of bull shit.
Target,2z6mb2,Bab5crusade,2,Mon Mar 16 06:45:23 2015 UTC,"(Edit: I incorrectly read this as you asking what you would be doing as a back room worker. For orientation, yeah you're just gonna watch some videos on safety and why unions are the devil and all that.)  If you're an early morning back room team member:  You'll probably start your day by doing pulls. The gist of it is you take a scanner and shoot it at the spot it tells you to, then scan each item there until it beeps at you to tell you you've found the right item. When pulls are done, you'll backstock items that came in from that day's truck unload. Backstocking is pretty much the opposite of doing pulls: you scan an item, then scan a location, then tell the computer how many of that item you are storing there.  If you are a dayside back room team member:  Every hour, you will receive new lists of items that you have to pull (they're called CAFs, or Created Auto Fills). Basically, you just go where the gun tells you to go and pull what it tells you to pull. They're going to stress to you that these are important, because if you don't finish all your CAFs within the hour that they dropped, it counts as a negative mark on your store. You have to be able to juggle finishing your hourly CAFs with handling the requests that random salesfloor people will periodically throw at you (""do we have this item in the backroom?"" or ""can you put item x on hold for guest y?""). It can get a little challenging at peak hours, but they won't throw you in on your own without making sure you know what you're doing. The biggest thing here: if you think you won't be able to finish the CAFs for the hour, due to having to fulfill too many store requests or some other circumstance, LET SOMEONE KNOW. The people in charge tend to care about those efficiency numbers, and if you let them know you're in danger of dropping that score they'll send someone back to help you faster than you can imagine.   If you are an overnight back room team member:  I've never personally worked this shift, but from what I've heard at my store it consists of a lot of backstocking. Things can get pretty hectic during the day, and the overnight team member's job is to finish cleaning up whatever was left behind. At my store, you're allowed to listen to music while you're in the back room, so once you get the hang of things you can bring an iPod or something to get into rhythm to while you backstock the day away.  But overall, don't worry too much. It's an entry level retail job that doesn't require any experience, and it's in everyone's best interests to make sure you know what you're doing before they turn you loose on the stockroom. Just pay attention to what you're doing with regards to backstocking items that look alike and you'll be fine.   Also, days off normally need to be requested 2 weeks in advance, so it's likely that the schedule for the week of the 27th has already been made. Make sure you communicate to the people in charge ASAP that you cannot work that day, and hopefully they'll be reasonable since you obviously couldn't have given notice any sooner."
Target,2z6mb2,targetAccount,2,Mon Mar 16 01:28:48 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for all of the information. I did already planning on letting them know tomorrow. So of course that's the only issue I had in starting hopefully they will be understanding like you said.
Target,2z6mb2,adamb10,2,Mon Mar 16 01:55:09 2015 UTC,"You'll also be given a tour of the store, learn how to use the time clock, lockers, and be given your schedule for the first 2 weeks.  You'll be paid for attending orientation too."

Target,2z6mb2,targetAccount,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:04:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks I do appreciate you saying that but my orientation was cancelled today I guess or scheduled wrong cuz I got an email to go but I got there this morning a half-hour early even and they were Like ""oh don't you remember? We told you to disregard any email we sent you about orientation and we will call you sometime very soon "" when on my second interview they told me to watch my emails and expect a call. So it was irritating to say the least."
Target,2z6mb2,conniem1973,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:22:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's pretty annoying. I don't know too much about HR, but I know that for my orientation there were people from all different workcenters and not just flow or backroom. So maybe they didn't have enough other positions filled to warrant doing an orientation?  Doesn't really excuse them not being clear about your orientation, though. I'm trying to remember how I got the date finalized for mine... I don't remember having to deal with an email or anything like that. I'm pretty sure I was told what day my orientation was right after my interview/conditional hiring, and then they said they would call if something changed. No call came, so I just showed up and it worked out. Hopefully yours gets straightened out soon.  I do remember that my orientation was in the afternoon, and then I was scheduled for a 2am shift the next day which surprised me. I guess I thought I would have a day or 2 to change my sleeping schedule."
Target,2z6xuf,dsouder,9,Mon Mar 16 02:46:47 2015 UTC,"I've seen Team Members break 100/month before the breach. They were... Very pressuring and overwhelming in their pitches. Also did 40 hours a week every week. So, realistically, they were looking at 5+ a shift.  Get familiar with the benefits, find an offer that is unique and suits you. ""Are you saving 5% with your REDcard today?"" won't work THAT much.  For me, I make it personal. ""Hey! You know about our REDcard, right? Has anyone told you about it?"". That generally works very well in my experience.  Also, checks. See a checkbook? ""Hey! Did you know I can save you 5% today and every day you shop at Target or Target.com? I just need to see one of those blank checks to sign you up for a Target Debit Card! It synchs up with your bank account, so there's no credit involved or anything like that!"""

Target,2z6xuf,mrs_meeow,3,Mon Mar 16 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"Our two best REDcard sellers got over 150 for the whole year last year. Nobody came close to ever getting 100 in a month and they each work 35-40 hours a week.   We are a smaller store with a high volume of cash-paying guests though so that makes a difference in our expectations for REDcards.   The 30 extra days for returns helps with electronics, but since the recent change in return policy it's otherwise not really a bonus anymore. The same with free shipping online since they lowered it to $25."
Target,2z6xuf,Isak922,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:55:37 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: The 30 days DOESN'T technically apply to Electronics. It states that it doesn't apply to items with an already limited return period (Electronics, Target Mobile). Of course, that's an absolutely silly hidden clause, and I'll vibe that through the roof because I find it absurd."

We are down to the 5% and Take Charge of Education.
Target,2z6xuf,Isak922,1 point,Mon Mar 16 07:24:04 2015 UTC,"Very true. Mind you, the one year return policy is only on OWNED brands... They'll still get extended returns on name brand products. But the others... It was easy enough to spend $50 on Target.com for free shipping... $25 is even easier. In store pick-up has even made that almost redundant. Some markets are even testing shipping from store to home (Thankfully not mine...)  Time for a reinvention of the REDcard program?"
Target,2z6xuf,mrs_meeow,1 point,Mon Mar 16 08:15:26 2015 UTC,"Right, but when you think about owned brands versus non-owned brands it's not like you are going to use that as a speaking point. At least I wouldn't. And the ship from store to home would be a nightmare.   Agree with the revamp of the REDcard program. Maybe up the percentage or add different perks."
Target,2z6xuf,Isak922,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:32:38 2015 UTC,"I've always tossed around mixing the old and new REDcards. 5% off every time you use it, but then every 1000 points, or $1000 spent, you get a 10% shopping coupon for a day. That stacks with Pharmacy Rewards and the regular 5%.  That would be a GLORIOUS selling point."

Target,2z4wl1,Awesome_Geek,5,Sun Mar 15 16:43:09 2015 UTC,"I ain't trying to start a fight, but as a flow team worker I gotta ask...  Do the people in charge at the distribution center (do you still call them team leads there?) make you double stack pallets in the truck to save time, or do people do it on their own? With the way the unload works at my store, we almost never can fit those double stacked paper pallets / water pallets through the truck door without having to knock one down (in the case of toilet paper) or waste time getting the electric jack to unstack them. Then the TLs get all passive aggressive about the unload taking longer because the line was at more or less of a standstill while tried to clear out double stacked pallets.  Not meaning to hijack your thread (since I too am interested in how many DC workers are here) or sound accusatory toward you, but I just want to know who makes the call to keep those pallets stacked. The inner workings of the DC are a mystery to a simple truck unloader like myself, and I wish to know more :)"
Target,2z4wl1,targetAccount,3,Mon Mar 16 00:54:05 2015 UTC,"I do not work in outbound anymore, but I did for awhile.  It might be a new guy that loaded or your trailer or the person may have forgot it is a single stack door.  Some people will double stack the half size paper towels on water or other towels.  We call our TLs group leaders, or GLs.  GLs do not allow tms to double stack in a single stack store, but they may allow tms to stage pipo side by side if it is busy.  Sometimes you get 20 pipo down a lane to a trailer and that is the only way it will get to a store.  I have seen 60 pipo, all for 1 store, it happens.  If you are a double stack store, I do not feel bad for you.  Outbound is one of the most physically demanding jobs.  You have to stack 4500 boxes over a 10 hour shift, along with putting in pipo (sometimes with a manual pallet jack even with water pipo), dog food, noncon, and sort noncon on top of it.  You do all this across 6-7 store trailers, and you can not let your lanes back up, so you do not set your own pace.  At our DC, Outbound is barely above freezing in Winter and blazing hot in summer.  Maybe, maybe 1 out of 500 women make it in outbound.  30-50% of new male hires can't make it past the first week.  When I was there, I would nod off driving home (live 15 minutes away) and would often fall asleep watching tv in my chair 10 minutes after walking through my front door.  They could pay Outbound $2/ hour more than the rest of the dc, and I would still not go back there or complain they get paid more."
Target,2z4wl1,Jsin14,3,Mon Mar 16 03:13:02 2015 UTC,"Also, during the busy season, we may flex people who don't normally do outbound into that department (Which is my case; I don't normally do outbound). Also, most of the time, anyone who gets flexed into outbound hates their night and usually does not care as much about best practice."
Target,2z4wl1,targetAccount,2,Mon Mar 16 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! I figured it was probably a space issue or just a pressure to go quickly. I'm not sure if we're a double stack store or not, although I wasn't really asking you to feel bad for me haha. The smaller double stacked pallets are fine to get out, and even the toilet paper ones aren't that hard to just push over once everyone is clear and the line isn't in the way. It's just the double stacked water ones that kill me."
Target,2z4wl1,Jsin14,2,Mon Mar 16 17:02:42 2015 UTC,"If you have a powered pallet jack, you are a double stack store.  We try to put as much pipo in the  nose or end or a trailer.  Water should never be stacked on top of anything, if it is, fill out a feedback form.  GLs do send on these forms to TMs. You are doing us a favor if you do, because if they do bad things like that, they are probably doing other things that make it tougher for fellow TMs at the DC.  We also try to keep paper towels with paper towels and like with like, because we heard that they do not have to be downstacked right away because they go to the same part of the store.  Is this true?"
Target,2z4wl1,targetAccount,2,Mon Mar 16 17:16:28 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that's good to know about powered jack. They still have us use the manual jack for the unload process for some reason...  Yeah generally when we open the truck we have at least one pipo in the front to take out right away, and there's only very rarely two pipos side by side that aren't in the very back or very front of the truck. I didn't know that about the water, thanks for the heads up! Next time we get a double stacked water pallet I'll ask my TL about that form, I didn't know we had those.   For the paper towels, yeah that's true. Paper towels and toilet paper and all that goes to the same section, so if it's double stacked then we typically don't bother downstacking it right away. Although if it won't fit through the truck door, or it hits the bikes on the path out (why my store decided hanging bikes from the ceiling directly in the unload path was a good idea, I'll never know) we typically just push the top one off right there even though they could go to the same spot."
Target,2z4wl1,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:30:41 2015 UTC,"My previous store had the moto-rack right in front of the dock doors.. Soooo stupid. For the first year after our remodel, we had the dinosaur of a crown and it couldn't go under the rack with its forks all the way down."
Target,2z4wl1,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:00:23 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting insight.. At my previous store, we had the equipment to unstack pallets but the doors leading out the sales floor where only 7ft high and the way our receiving bay was set up, we had to downstack as it was coming off the truck."
Target,2z4wl1,targetAccount,2,Tue Mar 17 23:06:17 2015 UTC,"Well in outbound, each door is assigned to a store. Hence every trailer that pulls up to that door to be loaded will always go to the same store. At our DC at least, every door has a mark/sign to indicate weather that store can take single stack or double stack. So, in a perfect world, we know what your store can handle.  That said, it is polite to get the pallets in and not leave them to fall on the next shift. So you may have a double stack(even if you are designated a single stack) if you we are trying to be polite to our TM's here. Sorry :( But just so you know, a trailer is loaded by one person at a time until it is full (usually 2 or 3 shifts, depending on store volume). And that Team member is on average (at my DC) loading 8 trailers/stores for 12 hours straight. While trying to attain rate.  As a note though, I know we are making changes for low volume stores (i.e. stores that don't get as much freight) where we are not building walls from floor to ceiling, and some trailers will not be fully loaded from front to back. It's in Pilot right now, but you may see it soon...  And yes, they are Team Leaders here.   Feel free to ask whatever you would like to about the DC. I'm not trained in every area, but my crew is very friendly and I'd be happy to ask around for an answer for you."
Target,2z4wl1,targetAccount,1 point,Mon Mar 16 11:40:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! Yeah I figured a lot of the stacking was just to make sure you can finish on time, or because truck space is low.   I think that also answered the other question that I had about how boxes designated for different stores can end up in our truck. If the people loading a truck are loading multiple trailers like that at a time, a few are probably bound to slip through.  Let's see, what else could I ask... How do mispicks happen? I would assume it's a computer that sticks those labels on boxes, so does it lose track of a box or something and cause it to label it incorrectly? And then to followup, how does the computer get back on track afterwards, since I would think missing one box in a line might cause it to mess up more down the line.  I use to do electronics after the unload, and like 80% of the time the people who packed the book repacks kept them really well organized. Like all the children's books were in the same box, coloring books in a different box, etc. And multiples of books were kept together so I wasn't going right back to the same section when I found another copy of the book in a second repack. I'm not sure if that's done consciously or as a result of the way you do the repack process (I guess that's question 3: what IS the repack process?), but it makes it much quicker to work through when the repack is already a majority of the same section. If it's something that your crew does consciously, be sure to tell them that it's noticed and appreciated by at least 1 person!  Edit: One last thing, in regard to boxes going to the wrong stores. Are we supposed to do anything about that? I know how to use the mispick application to report those, but whenever we get a box designated for the wrong store our TL always just tells us to stock it. I would assume this leads to incorrect inventory counts for both our store and the store missing a box, since to my knowledge there isn't ever a report or anything done."
Target,2z4wl1,targetAccount,2,Mon Mar 16 16:56:54 2015 UTC,"How do mispicks happen?   No, people do that does that. Typically, we get a stack of labels and are told to go forth and find these items in the ware house. Sometimes the product is not in the right place, but again, do to the great rate race, we don't always double check the DCPI. So the computer just assumes that the product is the correct product, and then sends it off to you. That's answer 1 & 2.   what IS the repack process?   Ah, my main function at the DC. Again, it goes back to that stack of labels. Our inventory is divided into several zones (16, actually), and the picking (Term using for grabbing stuff from its storage location) is done by zone. So electronics/security will only be pulled together and packed together. Makeup. Baby Clothes. Shoes. All packed together.  Once it has been picked, it is taken to a packer. It is then broken down by what store needs what and packed into the overpack box. Once the box is full, it's closed up and labeled with your store label, and sent off into the maze of conveyors.   in regard to boxes going to the wrong stores. Are we supposed to do anything about that?   I don't know what you all are supposed to due unfortunately. I do know that we do catch alot of it here, and we simply go and repick it. And we get lists almost every day of what your store needs, so more than likely when you enter it into the mispick application, it simply gets the product you were supposed to receive back into the queue to be pulled again."
Target,2z4wl1,whatdoesthiswiredo,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I always assumed it was a computer on a conveyor belt applying labels or something, didn't know it had to be done manually.  It seems weird that there's nothing for us to do to report wrong store boxes. We can't mispick them since it's the correct item and quantity, just the wrong store, so I guess they just hope the accumulator recognizes we randomly got more of an item that we weren't expecting haha."
Target,2z4wl1,targetAccount,2,Mon Mar 16 19:22:25 2015 UTC,"My questions to you:  Do you all launder the clothes to get wrinkles out? I Know that we just toss them in there, but in the store, everything looks neat and wrinkle free. What magic do you all use?"
Target,2z4wl1,whatdoesthiswiredo,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:16:36 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I wish I knew more about the softlines procedures. All of my work experience is with the unload, stocking hardlines, and some backroom and instocks. I do know that all of the hanging softlines that comes in off the truck is unpacked and put on a mobile rack right away, so that might help to straighten it out. But I've never seen them launder anything or use steam or whatever. The hanging softlines tend to just be put on a rack and then sits there for a bit while they focus on stuff that goes to tables.  As far as it looking neat, I stock the towels that come in repack #3 occasionally and they always come to us quite neat. Most of them are pre-folded for us and sealed, so there isn't much work for us to do in terms of making it look presentable or anything: just open up the bag and put 'em on the shelf!"
Target,2z4wl1,targetAccount,3,Mon Mar 16 19:28:44 2015 UTC,"Ive been in Outbound for over a year now and everything /u/Jsin14 has said is pretty accurate! going back to the double stack pipo, papertowels and toilet paper, we are encouraged to double stack it by our GLs if it is a high volume store(just because they may get 20 pieces of pipo during a shift) Ive always been told were not allowed to double stack waters, for one that would be over 4 tons at that point in the trailer and thats unsafe for travel and can cause damage to the trailer, and last its not safe if the load shifts."

Target,2z4wl1,whatdoesthiswiredo,2,Mon Mar 16 20:15:25 2015 UTC,"Ill give you a crash course run down of outbound since you're interested in how it works at the DC! My DC is 1.67 million sqft(you could probably fit 10 stores inside of it) and the basic job for outbound is working in lanes, imagine being in a trailer for 12 hours, non stop building walls for anywhere between 5-12(during the slow season) stores. The DC is a production based job, every position, repack,inbound,warehousing has a production number you have to hit by the end of your shift. When strictly loading trucks, its 445 cartons an hour or 5340 for a 12 hour shift. That is the most crueling part of outbound along with depal, but thats a whole different ball game. The other position is non con, prod for that is 55 an hour. The non con frieght varies from dog food, which most of the time has 60 on a single pallet and you can sort that in 10 minutes(if youre lucky enough to get dog food) or you can get giant christmas trees or more recently those giant wicker couches, now just imagine sorting 55 of those in a hour just to keep up with prod.  For every good dog food pallet there is another 50 shitty pallets like pillows or some other big item. Anyways, concerning how the Outbound wing gets freight and sent down the lanes to the stores is by a tilt tray sorting table. (basically identical to this, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEZM2_HKJbE) At my DC our sorter table is over a mile long and has 999 trays, the box slides on to the tray, passes under a scanner and when it gets to the designated door for that store it tilits and the box slides down a conveyor into the trailer. During a 12 hour shift right now we run anywhere from 40,000 to 50,000 since its the slow season, during fall season that bumps up to 90,000 a night.  I could write more but I have to get ready for work! just ask if you have any questions!  tl;dr Never apply for outbound, unless you like to get ass raped by boxes"

Target,2yzo1p,hawaiizach,3,Sun Mar 15 02:12:01 2015 UTC,"TPS reporting in:  I deal with non-AP shenanigans all the time.  I partially attribute this to having worked for my store for two years before taking the promotion.    Depending on your store, you may be asked to sub in for your cart attendant when they inevitably don't show up, help with CAF pulls, and other various non-AP tasks.  My counterpart at another local store has even been instructed to jump on a register by his STL at the time, which is something TPSs are not coded to do.  Simply put, if you end up being a TPS, expect any leader in the store not to know what your roles are and to coerce you to go outside them on a regular basis.  This is definitely a case of ""Your milage may vary."""
Target,2yzo1p,Nomnisang,2,Mon Mar 16 21:31:57 2015 UTC,This is definitely a case of a poor ETL AP and an even poorer STL (and maybe even DTL if this is the norm in your district). In most places this does not and should not happen. Actually had a conversation about an ETL AP yesterday who apparently might be termed for doing this with his TPS
Target,2yzo1p,hawaiizach,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:02:44 2015 UTC,"I've had three ETL-APs at my store thusfar.  The first [which this would happen under occasionally] was promoted.  The second [which it was the most intense under] left the company a few months ago.  The newest one was an ETL for another department and is still wrapping his head around the position.  I'm still trying to figure how best to help him.  Before he was AP he would ask me to work flexible fulfillment orders...  Fortunately he's been helping me get our cart attendants to stock spill stations, so I hope we're on the right track.  The STL at the other store was promoted to guest a couple months ago."
Target,2yzo1p,Nomnisang,7,Fri Mar 20 03:45:30 2015 UTC,"Do it! AP is single handedly the greatest position in the store. It's nearly impossible to be fired as well. The one down side to the job is if you leave for college, they will fill your position and you'll be demoted to sales floor/hardlines. Otherwise, the development is fantastic and the leaders will really get behind you and support you throughout you time there. You dont have to know anything going in, they'll teach you everything you need to know in training, just make sure you stress that you're willing to absorb knowledge in AP and use it to the best of your ability. I got hired at 18 with no prior experience and now I'm just waiting for an APS (Undercover position starts at $16 an hour) position to open up in a few months since I'm signed off."

This is a main problem that has come to my attention since I want to work towards a degree but keep my employment in AP. For me I am just going to wait until another position opens up near the college I want to go to. But it may or may not be the same for you it all depends on where you go to school and the payroll that target has for the store by your school."

Target,2yy1h5,howardtheduck126,3,Sun Mar 15 16:02:28 2015 UTC,At my store the flow team is critically understaffed to the point where there aren't enough people to fill every position on the truck line.  In addition to that they barely give the remaining flow team members any hours. You would think that when someone leaves that their hours can then be redistributed to the rest of the team. But that's just not the case. We've had four people leave (myself NOT included) in 2015 alone and if anything people have been getting fewer hours. And they haven't replaced even one of the people that left.  But all of that doesn't stop various people in leadership positions to bitch and moan about how the trucks aren't getting done.

Target,2yxpyx,Ashkir,3,Sat Mar 14 01:18:14 2015 UTC,"I've been here for 8 months and only got a raise because minimum wage was raised   Raises usually come with the yearly reviews.

In stocks hadn't scanned a damn thing in forever, and my leader didn't understand that researching had a negative impact if they truck hand been fully pushed. When she told me to ""just use your brain"" it resulted in a couple of hundred dollars in one day.   At stores where the process is messed up, like it was at mine, it failed. I got to the point to where I was pushing cosmetics left from the truck, all while I wasn't able to watch the front. GSA would call up a push out and here I was, trying to figure out the difference in concealer and masscara.   I understand Target's approach. Constantly researching allows us to identify shortage but in a 7 hour shift there is not a lot of time. Throw in documenting and actually conducting PMRs as well as all the tasks that need to be done and you're left with very little time to be impactfull.   I think Target looks at the best store and adds this. They don't look at stores that have messed up processes and sees how this affects them."

Target,2yjbbu,Rilo12,-4,Tue Mar 10 16:02:12 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you can buy anything in the store with the gift cards. I'm not sure why you'd want smaller giftcards. To trade?  Edit: apparently you can't do any of that. You can do one of those gift card exchange websites.
Target,2yjbbu,FirePowerCR,4,Tue Mar 10 08:48:39 2015 UTC,That's incorrect. You cannot buy giftcards for other companies with a target giftcard. Policy changed about three years ago
Target,2yjbbu,AforAnarchist,1 point,Tue Mar 10 10:42:17 2015 UTC,Oh I was under the impression you could buy pretty much anything.
Target,2yjbbu,FirePowerCR,3,Tue Mar 10 15:16:07 2015 UTC,you could buy pretty much anything.    Correct you can buy pretty much anything. Not everything.
Target,2yjbbu,IronOreAgate,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:04:26 2015 UTC,"No, reasoning behind exchanging for smaller increments is because of some state laws that you can get through. Like in Washington, where I live, If a card has 5$ or less you can cash it out at a retail location. A.k.a $50 Gift card --->10 $5 gift cards ----> all into 50$ BOOM BABY"
Target,2yi9s3,Haunter20X,6,Tue Mar 10 00:57:54 2015 UTC,Sometimes they are there right when I am helping flow out with finishing a truck.  Just hand them the box and they will check it out and put them up for you. #dontreallydothis
Target,2yi9s3,onizaru,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:10:36 2015 UTC,The worst ones assume they can come in and look through a box after flow is done for the day. Like you can just come in at 6 p.m. and I'll pull two whole boxes of hot wheels for them to sort. Then they act like I'm the rude one for following store policy.
Target,2yi9s3,lemonbee,2,Tue Mar 10 05:38:18 2015 UTC,"Every team lead and hardlines ETL I've had has been against pulling stuff that comes assorted like that. It takes too much time to pull an entire box for a guest, especially if there's no room for the toys the guest doesn't want."

Target,2yi9s3,ChocolatePopes,1 point,Tue Mar 10 22:26:20 2015 UTC,"We have the opposite problem.  Hot Wheels guys are pretty much all dirty, smelly guys who break down the door at open, and then ask if there are more in the back or when we are getting more.

Every day I would tell him no. He would then go on a rant about the ports and how it isn't fair that he doesn't get to shop for the things he wants and start crying because his collection isn't growing and then yell at me for ""not caring"". Eventually we got some in. He came in, opened them all, and then found the one he wanted and left the trash. He's now banned.   Fuck my little pony blind bag guy."

Target,2yinwo,Besnasty,3,Wed Mar 11 15:54:10 2015 UTC,"Im at the lakeline store. I work I the food area, so I can't comment on too much of the stores happenings since everyone pretty much leaves alone, but I can try to answer any questions you have. Our store has had a lot of problems recently. DJ (STL) left to go to south park, so we got Abby. I really like her, but apparently she just didn't give an crap, and the rumor is that she just let the store go down and was allowed to quit before they fired her. We have russel now. I haven't heard any major complaints. Most of our etl group are fairly new(within the last year) most have gotten fired or quit mysteriously. We failed our best team survey last year, so alot of that was backlash from that (including several bumps in pay for everyone) As for hours etc. As im sure every store right now, we had a major cut back on hours.I was talking to an etl the other day who said that we are working with less than half the amount of hours we are used to getting. I don't remember the amount, but it was something like we used to get 100 and now we get 40. Moral is down a lot and the etls are showing a lot of stress and taking it out on the floor. Hopefully that will change soon.  We just switched districts, so you might know the new DM since she has all of Austin I think. I can't remember her name for the life of me since I've only met her once.  I believe we are busier than Cedar Park, and I know they have a lot of issues with their management too, but I honestly don't know any specifics.  Im sorry I don't know more details to give you! I really so enjoy my store, but like I said, im over in the food areas, and we stay to our selves mostly, so I miss alot of the every day details of the rest of the store."

Target,2yhgts,481072211,3,Mon Mar 9 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"Target can't say anything positive or negative about your past employment there.  If you quit without notice, you will go on a no hire list and the store will not hire you again and neither will most others.  If you don't think you'll ever have to go back, you can quit without notice.  Its the more ""stand up"" thing to do to work your 2 weeks out, but I'm sure they're used to people not doing so.  Having said that, please do call them and tell them you quit and don't just stop showing up."
Target,2yhgts,zieen,2,Tue Mar 10 05:46:35 2015 UTC,Those two weeks aren't just there so you can come back. They're there so you don't fuck up your co-worker's schedules and make everyone's life more difficult.   At least give some notice to them. Don't just stop showing up.
Target,2yhgts,irishdanmurphy,2,Tue Mar 10 19:49:36 2015 UTC,Go to either your etl or HR and inform them you need to put in your two weeks. Thames have a form.   You tell them when you need to leave by and work until then usually. At least will finish your schedule.   HR is usually in M-F 7-330ish.

Target,2yeql2,IronOreAgate,2,Mon Mar 9 14:41:56 2015 UTC,Yeah mine got changed to 9 in August. Completely over wrote 3 years of raises. I was pissed.
Target,2yeql2,The_WubWub,2,Mon Mar 9 14:54:40 2015 UTC,"When I got a raise it was added to my ""base pay"" and all raises that I earned were on top of that.    So say my base pay when I started was 7.25 and I earned a total of .75 cents in raises over my time there to make $8/hr,  if they decided to raise the pay to 7.75 it would make my pay $8.50  with the .75 raises that I earned.   That's how my store handled it anyway."
Target,2yeql2,IronOreAgate,2,Mon Mar 9 08:02:17 2015 UTC,Then your store actually seems to give a shit. More likely the state your in have some law against over writing raises. Target pinches pennies way to hard for me to get to keep my raises unless a higher power told them they have too.
Target,2yeql2,Rhinoj97,1 point,Mon Mar 9 09:27:53 2015 UTC,They told us in a about a month or 2 everyone who is not at $9/hr will be raised to that but if you are not at $9 you will just get a regular raise
Target,2yeql2,Bab5crusade,2,Mon Mar 9 21:57:15 2015 UTC,I would have to agree I now make 8.75 after 6 months of working and hard work it would suck if new people make the same right out of the gate.
Target,2yeql2,Rhinoj97,2,Mon Mar 9 15:12:05 2015 UTC,Still not enough. $15 dollars is the way to go. You still can't live on $9.
Target,2yeql2,Bab5crusade,2,Mon Mar 9 15:29:20 2015 UTC,But at 15 dollars an hour most of the people would get let go to save on payroll
Target,2yeql2,aimiami,6,Mon Mar 9 15:18:55 2015 UTC,You do know Target makes enough to pay you 15 dollars an hour and still make a profit?   The reason for pay roll cutting because low end employees are the company's way to make easy profits.  Target doesn't see you as an hunan being but an tool.

Sometimes that dollar makes a huge difference."
Target,2yeql2,Bab5crusade,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:18:24 2015 UTC,Then why don't you demand for more or is that just more bitching to your lord?   I was an GSA for three years at that damn company. I work as much as the Guest Service STL and more. I've almost got my self fired due to internal politics. Got my crew leading red cards and what is my raise? 3 cents.     For majority of Target workers. An dollar is not going to be enough to live on. What Target is doing is making you happy by giving scraps. We don't want the crumb of the pie. We want the whole damn thing.   A lot of us are done seeing our bosses get huge bonuses and raises while us serfs are doing all the work.
Target,2yeql2,the_legend_2828,-2,Tue Mar 10 04:44:38 2015 UTC,"Then go start your own business. I hate Target don't get me wrong, but they're paying $1.75 over minimum wage so it's hard to bitch when you have no work experience and coming in at an entry level position. If you want more money then go bitch to your STL instead of trying to change my opinion of Target which is very similar to yours. Also you're using ""An"" when you should be using ""A"" so it's hard to read this and take it seriously."
Target,2yeql2,nohitter21,1 point,Tue Mar 10 05:55:49 2015 UTC,Looks like someone was feed with capitalist dogma and loved it.  STLs don't give a damn about you and worker's opinion. They only care in the world is to make the store happy with profits. If an worker asks for a higher wage. We are normally asked to accept the scraps we get or leave.
Target,2yeql2,SadChickenNugget,-3,Tue Mar 10 13:59:40 2015 UTC,"And also this isn't a fucking monarchy. You can't just storm into to Target and start making demands for more money when you're an expendable employee because they can fire you and hire someone to do the same job for less money and be OK with it. And is Target really that hard Mr. GSA? Were you slaving over those customer returns for hours on end in the air conditioned building? It must have been so hard to do the cash cart every night, and god forbid you have to clean the bathrooms!"

I'm definitely planning on calling tomorrow morning when Target opens but was hoping to get some input before then. I spent some time on google, yahoo, and target reddit searching for drug test procedure and all I could find were people worried about not passing or saying they were never tested (not a problem for me as I've never used anything). I was hoping that since the interviewer didn't say anything about when I have to take the drug test or anything about the procedure to me verbally that maybe the 24 hour thing on the form is flexible. Anyway I don't want to risk it so I'm calling tomorrow but just wanted some piece of mind before I sleep tonight."

Target,2y6tad,hogBelly,11,Fri Mar 6 23:35:54 2015 UTC,"It is a pretty rough atmosphere. I think most people at HQ (myself included) would agree that there are inefficiencies, and given current decision making structures, things can't get done that quickly.   The ""constant"" get to know yous and coffees are being exaggerated, but these things are intrinsic to current Target culture. I do meet with previous managers and a handful of career mentors on about a quarterly basis (for a 30 minute coffee/catch-up). We are taught to do this, in large part to understand what is happening throughout the rest of the company and to help plan future career moves within HQ. I think most people at HQ would agree that this is not what is driving inefficiency, it is the amount of meetings generally needed to get anything ""approved"".   Most people I've talked to are excited about the (rumored) changes to our operating structure. That excitement just isn't outweighing the fear of being laid off next week. If rumors are to be believed, Monday - Wednesday will be our ""Red (and khaki) Wedding"". Wishing luck to all other HQ TMs sweating it out. Enjoy the warm weather this weekend in MPLS. :-)   Edit: Thought it was worth adding that much of the fear/anxiety is coming from the perception that layoffs are structured around eliminating full job codes/teams, and not personal performance. This exercise in cleaning house will eliminate some unnecessary teams and streamline operations, but it will also force the company to lose some great talent. There is a sense of even if you are highly regarded or a hard worker, you can be eliminated for being on an underperforming team. Wrong place, wrong time kind of thing."

Within a two week span they would come every other day and each walk away with just under a grand cashed out.  The store manager considered it fine since we were reimbursed either way.  But not until they noticed the massive overstock that was building up. They ended up banning the family, once we started limiting them, they flipped their shit and cussed out the managers, forcing AP to come in and take them outside the store, the manager at the time literally yelled at them to get an honest job.  Management has changed but that families mugshot remains in the AP office and any new managers are made aware of them by the regular AP and the Team leads that have been around.  Every now and then one of them comes in to try to return some items but are immediately spotted and reminded that they are banned."
Target,2xya05,iskroot,13,Thu Mar 5 06:39:41 2015 UTC,With a wide smile and talk about the perks of the redcard. Fuck our gstl.
Target,2xya05,ChocolatePopes,6,Thu Mar 5 01:48:29 2015 UTC,"Our coupon fraud is mostly people trying to get away with using coupons for incorrect products, surprisingly we don't get a lot of fraudulent returns (of this kind, plenty of just straight up stolen goods and tags attached to old or non-Target merchandise.) I did have a lady the other day try to return two razors she had used a $7 buy one get one free coupon on right after she had purchased them. I had been standing near the register during that transaction so I knew exactly what she was trying to do and I got a lot of joy out of changing her refund from $14 to $7."
Target,2xya05,seattlantis,4,Thu Mar 5 06:30:50 2015 UTC,This issue with changing refund amounts is that Target is going to send in the coupon and be reimbursed from the manufacturer. There is no reason to change the amount. I would have just declined the refund all together.  If we send in the coupon without refunding the guest the full amount then Target is the one commiting coupon fraud.
Target,2xya05,AforAnarchist,3,Thu Mar 5 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"My store did the same thing. If they fought about it, I just called AP and he was more than happy to kick them out."
Target,2xya05,itsamutiny,3,Thu Mar 5 00:54:42 2015 UTC,Ap here. We have the gstl ring up the purchase to within the coupon rules and they try hard to piss them off. They eventually got pissed snd my etl banned them from the store
Target,2xya05,Croweslen,2,Thu Mar 5 06:57:46 2015 UTC,"as long as its legit, go for it. its what corp wants us to do.   returns, we give what they pay for the item so we manually change it. that deters enough people. the usuals always adjust to what we do and bring just enough to meet our limits. what sucks is when the random people want to do it at our store and get pissed at limits and call corporate. doesn't help them but we have to change our mins."
Target,2xxrij,niggerfaget666,9,Wed Mar 4 19:20:40 2015 UTC,"While I get why they changed the uniform, I think it's dumb. Who is going to take you seriously during an apprehension, or even a receipt check? Sometimes the uniform is all it takes to calm down an unruly guest, now I'm just another TM. So what if it makes us ""less intimidating"" to guests. The point of being in the uniform we had was to be an obvious symbol to shoplifters that there was an AP presence.   Now we have to speedweave and zone as well. I wonder how we will do at inventory this year."

But at my store we are highly respected, both in district and group. We had a record number of apps for the last year. When this new thing fully rolls out my ETLAP won't make us do a lot of what's on the new task cards (like zoning accessories). We have job to do and that's BS."
Target,2xxrij,littlecircle,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:54:16 2015 UTC,"Currently, my AP department is somewhat respected. That is, the store respects me and my performance in the AP department. I do everything I can to keep the team aware of theft trends and show photos of subjects. I also show a presence around the store and make sure any TMs who don't know how to spiderwrap merchandise know that they can always ask me for help in teaching them. I also bring up important safety & security topics at the huddles and let the team know that if there is any personal issue they are having, including being harassed or stalked, they can always come to me about it. Several TMs have mentioned that they do feel safer when I am in the store because they know that I will make sure to handle the situation. And being that I am female and the fact that my store is in a bad area (where we get people coming in hopped up on drugs and carrying weapons all the time), it means a lot to me that they still feel safer when I am there as opposed to some others on my team who don't seem to care about the job and are only there for the paycheck and nothing else."

I honestly think it makes AP look like a bit of a joke. I doubt any boosters are really gonna take me seriously when I try to get a PMR or an apprehension on them.  As far as utilizing AP for zoning and pushing merchandise, I think that is a terrible idea for my store, in particular. I can see it not being a huge issue in locations that are not high-theft locations, but it is still an issue, being that AP was hired to perform AP tasks and cannot focus on AP tasks when they are expected to do so many other things."

Target,2xwznn,littlecircle,3,Wed Mar 4 17:26:48 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much why. It's the reason we don't allow many people to change departments at my store.   But how long have you been a cashier, OP? You can't switch if you're under your 90 days."
Target,2xwznn,conniem1973,2,Wed Mar 4 18:18:04 2015 UTC,Yes you can switch under 90 days. I'm HR and we hire people and then switch them to a different position under 90 days quite often.
Target,2xwznn,ChocolatePopes,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:06:46 2015 UTC,"To be fair, being a cashier vs sales attendant is two totally different roles. Getting red cards is 80% luck, especially if you a low volume store.  Each person has different strength and weaknesses and a good manager should be able to utilize a worker. You can still be a fast worker but suck with pitching. Also OP wouldn't be able to move even if his redcard score is high. Our store wouldn't dare put our best cashiers on floor, despite him being really fast on zone."
Target,2xwznn,conniem1973,2,Thu Mar 5 01:58:27 2015 UTC,"Being able to get red cards has little to do with how well you will do in another department.

On a slightly more related note, maybe start small,  like writing vibe cards to each other.

Target,2xpq2c,murder_nectar,6,Mon Mar 2 21:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you HAVE to fill out a W-4. It's non optional. And that's not something target decided, it's a legal thing. Which means Target didn't screw you, you screwed you."
Target,2xpq2c,FenrirSM,2,Mon Mar 2 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"Regarding sick, that may be up to local/state law. I'm an hourly TM in California and I accrue Sick leave. I, however, do not accrue personal holiday leave."
Target,2xpq2c,comicidiot,2,Tue Mar 3 11:04:57 2015 UTC,"How did you never notice that taxes weren't taken on your check stub?   I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on this one. When I started I went the direct deposit route. first pay i received a physical paycheck, ever since then the money just gets deposited into my account, haven't seen a paystub in years."
Target,2xpq2c,not_a_banana,3,Mon Mar 2 23:37:07 2015 UTC,"True but when I worked there they still had a paper stub available to you even if it was a direct deposit,  not sure if that's still the case though."
Target,2xpq2c,The_WubWub,1 point,Tue Mar 3 02:47:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely the case....all that info is available on eHR. I do direct deposit too, and you can even look a couple of days ahead at the pay stub and it'll tell you what is going to be deposited on Friday.  Also, they should send you a paper stub until you opt out and go paperless. (at least this is my case)"
Target,2xpq2c,SirFartsinHand,7,Tue Mar 3 03:36:29 2015 UTC,"As far as taxes, when I started there was a form given to us in orientation about taxes, and you indicated what applied to you, telling you how many points to put down. Most people had 1 or 2, and that determined your tax withholding."
Target,2xpq2c,pohatu771,7,Tue Mar 3 04:39:34 2015 UTC,"Uh, did you ever look at your pay stubs?  You have to share some of the responsibility for the oversight even though it probably is Target's mistake but you are kind of a dickhead for not noticing the problem for a whole year."
Target,2xpq2c,lockwasher,-1,Mon Mar 2 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"I only had one pay stub then I switched to direct deposit. Everywhere else I've ever worked automatically withheld federal, so I didn't even think to check"
Target,2xpq2c,lockwasher,6,Tue Mar 3 01:11:20 2015 UTC,You will have many problems in your future if you continue to rely on the other person to do exactly what they are supposed to do.  Take some responsibility for your own destiny.
Target,2xpq2c,danstem,3,Tue Mar 3 05:10:27 2015 UTC,Yeah you should have filled out a w9 when you started. Then on every pay stub it tells you how much federal is being withheld. As far as vacation it starts after 1 year.
Target,2xpq2c,pgh9fan,6,Tue Mar 3 13:41:55 2015 UTC,A w9 shows legal employability. You're thinking of a W4.
Target,2xpq2c,siiberiia,2,Mon Mar 2 22:59:16 2015 UTC,"I've been working at mine for a year and I still got 600 out of 900 withheld. Also, to accrue vaca hours you have to make something like minimum 35 hours a week for 2 weeks consecutively then you start accruing. Ask hr for details."
Target,2xpq2c,gkconnor91,0,Tue Mar 3 01:32:37 2015 UTC,Did you have to do something special when you started like sign up for withholdings or something?
Target,2xlryo,bellexox,6,Sun Mar 1 22:24:34 2015 UTC,"WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CANT RETURN THIS ITEM I JUST BOUGHT YESTERDAY?   There's signs everywhere saying there's no returns allowed.   I DIDN'T SEE THEM, NO WONDER TARGET IS FAILING.  Lol wut, are you blind?"
Target,2xlryo,ThisIsMyPlane,3,Mon Mar 2 19:09:32 2015 UTC,This! So much this!   We had a lady try to return something (bought before liquidation so that's fine) but it was way over the 90 days. She kept saying what good is it to me now? Sorry lady should've returned it earlier.   Then she proceeds to tell us that's why we are failing... Uh.. Ya. That's it completely.   Face meet palm.
Target,2xlryo,ThisIsMyPlane,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:29:19 2015 UTC,are you me? thats happened too many times before.
Target,2xlryo,ThisIsMyPlane,2,Mon Mar 2 19:30:40 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly.   Even people who buy things and we tell them FINAL SALE NO RETURNS OR EXCHANGES and yet the go right to guest services because they bought the wrong colour/style/size whatever it is   No. No exceptions.   But the most frustrating thing is that our rules literally change everyday. So one day it's big ticket items can only be returned if defective. Then it's no. One day we couldn't sell items that didn't scan, but now we can.   Like holy shit trying to keep up with that is mind boggling. It hurts me just thinking about it :("
Target,2xlryo,mundler,2,Mon Mar 2 19:39:37 2015 UTC,"i had a woman come in saying she has a $4.00 gift card, and was scared that the store would close before she could use it. She wanted to return a set of baby clothes she bought in fucking November.   I told her to go buy something off of the floor, because   its been more than 90 days after she returns something, i cant sell it back to her it has to go back on the shelf I definitely wouldn't let her return something for $10 and buy it back for $4. The price changed a lot since liquidation started.   After a fucking long time of arguing, i got tired of her and called the LOD. I told her the problem, and the LOD agreed with me.   The lady wouldnt shut the fuck up though. kept on saying that she should have an exception made for her, because she came here in the cold and some other bullshit.   I finally suggested, because i was tired of her voice, that we return it and let her buy it back, but increase the price of the item to be exactly what she returned it for.  The woman said she couldn't go home and live with herself knowing she paid $10 for something that is currently $4. i dont know what her problem is, people are honestly retarded."
Target,2xlryo,mundler,1 point,Mon Mar 2 20:42:14 2015 UTC,"Oh. My. God.   I'm sorry you dealt with that. Thankfully we haven't had to deal with that yet that I know of. Who knows, I wouldn't be surprised if someone does.   Especially since the prices are now dropping for us I can see people come back wanting a difference. Nope. GTFO."
Target,2xlryo,MindAsWell,2,Mon Mar 2 22:19:18 2015 UTC,"We're getting stock in from other stores so NOTHING SCANS IN. I have fun finding something close to the real item and tell the guest, Yeah this is probably around $$$ but all I can find is $$ so with discount that comes to $. OH MAN THEIR FACES. See? Target ain't that bad of a place! I can make people happy."
Target,2xlryo,itsamutiny,2,Mon Mar 2 20:44:43 2015 UTC,I've had to done that too. Usually it's like a stupid toy or something.   Sometimes I just don't care but with some stuff it's really hard to price so that's when I ask just to get a better judgment and sometimes I'll knock off a couple bucks for them having to wait and such.
Target,2xlryo,DrHuh,1 point,Mon Mar 2 22:20:42 2015 UTC,I tell them once more that there is nothing I can do for them and start to walk away. I'm not putting up with your bullshit.  FINE THEN I GUESS I'LL JUST GO TAKE WHAT I WANT OFF THE SHELF.  Uhh... that's stealing!
Target,2xlryo,mundler,4,Mon Mar 2 20:41:27 2015 UTC,Theres a reason that I already left. I couldn't stand staying these  last few months.
Target,2xlryo,mundler,8,Sun Mar 1 23:02:13 2015 UTC,"It has been hell. A chaotic, miserable, hell. Things are all over the place and not tagged properly. We've had people take the liquidation tags off one item that's cheaper, and place it on a more expensive item and try to argue with us about it. WTF."
Target,2xlryo,mundler,4,Mon Mar 2 00:47:37 2015 UTC,People do that in American Targets all they time. It sucks.
Target,2xlryo,mundler,4,Mon Mar 2 03:50:38 2015 UTC,It's just not right. I don't get it. We teach our kids to behave and not to whine to get their own way. And then what do adults go ahead a do? Bitch and complain until they get their way! I'm baffled..
Target,2xlryo,rh51too,5,Mon Mar 2 04:43:49 2015 UTC,"Sadly for me, there is no severance. Even then, if I were to quit I wouldn't get it anyway. They made it seem like we were all getting taken care of with an additional 16 weeks of pay. That pay was from when they announced their closure to the end date, of May 16th. I won't get fired, they need me. I'm one of 4 GSA's so they can't afford to lose me really which kind of sucks.  So basically, there is no saving grace. Other than the fact I've applied at a couple other jobs that I have a higher chance of getting and it's not in retail ;)"
Target,2xlryo,Isak922,3,Sun Mar 1 23:30:16 2015 UTC,"Severance it's not severance we get a paycheque until May 16th with our average hours worked for some random 8 week interval Octoberish last year work or not that is what we are paid. If we leave before they don't need us we get nothing else, we could work right up until that date or even two weeks after and get nothing outside of a paycheque. It ain't right but I too still view Target and my time there in a very positive light. Wish we had one more year that's all I wanted."
Target,2xlryo,SmokingApple,3,Mon Mar 2 00:40:22 2015 UTC,"With the money that they are giving the CEO they could've given it to us instead. Especially those who rely on this job to pay their bills and feed their family. It's appalling with what they have given him, and what we are receiving.  We are going out in style though. Every night we have some sort of game to play. One time we rode around on those power scooters having a race, we played hide and go seek, and a silly string fight. Last night we wore these god awful baby blue housecoats that look like the belong in a hospital for the last 15 minutes before the store closed because we ""Work in a loony bin"". Haha, last night was so much fun."
Target,2xl4k6,dmillerw,3,Sun Mar 1 19:16:28 2015 UTC,Are you sure it's not Target Mobile? Run by Marketsource?
Target,2xl4k6,diilemmaz,3,Sun Mar 1 21:17:34 2015 UTC,"This is an HQ job, and not a store job, I assume.  If you applied to Target, it is definitely not Target Mobile. People who apply there are applying to Marketsource, they don't find out it's Target Mobile until the interview."
Target,2xl4k6,pohatu771,0,Mon Mar 2 22:00:17 2015 UTC,I had to answer a bunch of programming questions to get an interview. I don't think Target Mobile is that strictly run.
Target,2xl4k6,MindAsWell,2,Sun Mar 1 21:30:31 2015 UTC,My money would probably be on making and working with mobile apps. If you had programing questions that seems like a logical fit.
Target,2xio6m,FUCKREDDIQUETTE,7,Sun Mar 1 01:29:18 2015 UTC,from what i know its forever at any store.  you might get some people to override it if they know you and understand circumstances. but usually you're done at the company
Target,2xio6m,monkeyman80,9,Sun Mar 1 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"Someone at our store left and was marked non-rehirable, went to another store where they overrode it and eventually transferred back to the original story. Crazy, but it can be done if you know the right people."
Target,2xio6m,ecstatic_waffle,3,Sun Mar 1 03:34:09 2015 UTC,"yeah, its personal relationships that can get it overrode. we are in a college city, so we get a lot who have open availability before school, but after they're going to cut them down. they said they were ok. after?   oh you're in your 90, can't adjust your availability."
Target,2xio6m,monkeyman80,3,Mon Mar 2 01:49:11 2015 UTC,"I believe it lasts forever, however it by no means prevents you from being rehired. It is given to whoever is looking at your application and it will say non rehirable, and give the reason why. It's usually a red flag when reviewing an application, however it is up to whoever does your interview to determine whether or not you are hired. Getting an interview while non rehirable may be hard though."
Target,2xio6m,Snowy556,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:01:49 2015 UTC,"It is forever, and through the whole company.  If you apply at any Target, when we look at your application, it will say if you have ever worked at Target.  When we pull that up to see why you left, it will show if you are non-rehireable.  If that's the case, we can't do anything about it, even if we know you and wanted to hire you."
Target,2xd8no,unidentifies,19,Fri Feb 27 16:58:04 2015 UTC,I think this is a creative idea. I could still see guests getting angry and not understand why they wouldn't be able to join the shortest line however.
Target,2xd8no,SenorBojangles,4,Fri Feb 27 17:32:57 2015 UTC,"You're right. They would get angry, but it would definitely cause many of them to sign up for red cards, in my opinion. I very well may be wrong though."
Target,2xd8no,monkeyman80,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:04:45 2015 UTC,"its def creative. but we don't have self checkout, and when we try to say 10 items or less (or quick checkout) people just hear open person.  we have had issues when other registers are down, and we need the front lane registers. you have so many pissed off people that they saw an employee on a lane and can't check out. hey there are signs. there are lights. people still will go to lane with people."
Target,2xd8no,pohatu771,5,Sun Mar 1 02:17:22 2015 UTC,"That would increase time in the regular line. Target would rather keep times short for everyone.  Plus, it is not uncommon for our store (highest volume in the district, probably average for the country) to only have one cashier for much of the day."
Target,2xd8no,wonderman911,7,Fri Feb 27 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"umm no thats not common, maybe one in the first and last hour of the store opening and closing, but defintly there are more than 2 cashiers between 9am and 10 pm"
Target,2xd8no,dubblechzburger,3,Fri Feb 27 22:00:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly that baffles me. Must be a real slow district because we as a A or A+ volume store have 1 or 2 for the first and last hour or 2 and then anywhere from 3-8 at a time through out the day.  We'd be royally fucked if it weren't uncommon for us to only have 1 cashier for much of a day.  And we're barely top 5 in our district, maybe like 6th so it's not like we're crazy busy."
Target,2xd8no,zomboni_steve,3,Fri Feb 27 23:19:23 2015 UTC,"Ultra low volume store here. Average truck size is 1400. We tend to only have 1-2 cashiers all day long. Gstl is usually on a lane backing up. We don't get a guest service team member till 11am, no electronics or sales floor team members till 9am. Sometimes only 1 closet on each side of the store. Oh. And we only have 3 team leads."
Target,2xd8no,dubblechzburger,2,Sat Feb 28 02:29:21 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. Already mapped out our cashiers but there's always a guest service team member at store open. Always an electronics person there an hour before open to get electronics ready. Enough cashier where GSTL doesn't have to back up, and usually if it's a back up they call for a back up cashier rather than hop on. And I think it's 7 sales floor TLs here."
Target,2xd8no,wonderman911,1 point,Sat Feb 28 02:44:53 2015 UTC,"Ive worked at two stores, my main store is an AA volume store so its pretty busy all day. The other store is also an AA volume store, but it is so busy that they are thinking of classifying it as a AAA volume store. Btw neither of those are super targets and are constantly in the top 3 in the district."
Target,2xd8no,khaelian,1 point,Sat Feb 28 05:39:38 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying. I should have elaborated. I think Target should have an extra person on a check lane to take care of the red card members. So they'd need at least one extra person than usual.  I obviously can't speak for all stores, but my store is pretty popular, so we are busy most of the time. The only time we EVER have one person on cashier is right at open, and occasionally right at close. Usually we have several members at the check lanes, and we still get called up for guest first a lot. This is just my experience, of course."
Target,2xd8no,lockwasher,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:02:41 2015 UTC,You mist be nowhere bear Minneapolis. I've never seen less than 3.
Target,2xd8no,ChocolatePopes,3,Sat Feb 28 06:01:44 2015 UTC,"Great idea from a service standpoint - but - that would mean Target would actually have to pay someone to be at a register that might not be busy all of the time.  And what would you do if a non-redcard holder wanted to go through that check out line?  Are you going to create a situation where you have to tell a customer no and possibly piss them off?  But go ahead, bring it up at the next team cluster pump."
Target,2xd8no,lockwasher,3,Fri Feb 27 23:47:35 2015 UTC,"""Oh I'm sorry. This register ONLY takes redcards."" Telling people the stupid machine is at fault is pretty much my goto"

Seriously whoever is in charge of blessing us with payroll is a fucking cock smuggler. The level of apathy at target has reached critical mass. Got my benefits package this week and promptly tossed it out in the hr's trash because i get paid less than it takes to eat how can i afford healthcare!   It seems each person at target's job is to claim they can do the impossible and then throw that resposibility down the line. Just pretend everything is ok and it will all work out right? We work for shareholders guys, don't expect this to improve ever. They will squeeze target stock until it's no longer profitable then sell the stock while target closes down."
Target,2x7kle,cyan1113,1 point,Thu Feb 26 11:03:52 2015 UTC,"You very much escalated there.

I am still with the company and doing better. No college degree, be happy with my pay, I get full time, and love what i do.   Target is a place where you can be successful and survive. It's retail. Don't expect to make a lot of money. If you have a problem with it, find something the suites you better.   Most companies are about making the shareholders money and they want to continue to make money, so they will change as needed."

Central Florida being the worst area. I know in other places it's better but not here and i'm not alone in this.   My entire store is struggling to make ends meet. $8hr even at 40 hours isn't enough. In the year i've been here every single other retail store has raised their minimum to $10 and up. I did have a roomate that worked with me at target full time still not enough. Oh did i mention we had foodstamps too. Sure you can say it's a job for teens ect. but the expectations are designed for an experienced reliable adult.

Target,2x7kle,cyan1113,2,Thu Feb 26 11:57:53 2015 UTC,"its a flaw of mytime. there are workcenters that don't really need people during the time of the store hours. you have 1 guest buying something during the 8am-9 am hour? lets not schedule one. someone else can cover it. yeah, we need a cashier, guest service etc.   the person who makes the schedule should be auditing those workcenters and covering it. there should be a backup and finally the stl should audit.   this doesn't happen in my store so looks like its common."

I actually don't mind it too much honestly. Come in a couple hours early, listen to podcasts or whatever and write down the last 4 dpcis of things were out of and fill what we got in the battery tub. After a week or 2 I know exactly what we have in the tub instock so it's just a couple minutes at each side cap.   Maybe it's the lack of guests so it just seems more relaxing."

Target,2x0be4,l0singmymarbles,2,Thu Feb 26 04:51:47 2015 UTC,We started doing that at my store when we began liquidating (Target Canada) and it actually has made a huge difference. We keep a guest cart at every price scanner and people are using them. It's great because most of the stuff comes from a few aisles down and we can just pick it up on our way by and put it back. I've noticed there is a lot less reshop now and less abandons all over the store.

Target,2wtgae,monkeyman80,1 point,Mon Feb 23 03:35:27 2015 UTC,i trained at a store that had a blackout in a lot of the city while they had power. all zones closed at red. kids made a mess of it.   we had a set where there were a couple kids who were just knocking over shit with a defeated father walking behind them.
Target,2wtgae,Guadaloope,4,Tue Feb 24 02:07:40 2015 UTC,"I do the same thing at my store that you do. It can be difficult, especially on weekends, and sometimes you'll have to make sacrifices. Some of the things that I do to help might translate for you. Ultimately, everyone has their own zoning ""style"" but you'll find what works best for you eventually.   First, zone with two hands. It seems obvious but you'll be amazed how many people just sort of lumber along facing the end of the aisle zoning one-handed. If you find abandoned items all over the place, either pick them up on your way out of the aisle or clear them first, then zone two-handed.   Secondly, don't waste time walking abandons to their place as you go. If it's on the endcap, or maybe one aisle up, finish the aisle and then put it up. If not, just put it in your cart and move on. If you try to be conscious of what's in your cart, you can try to reshop as you go. If not, it's much easier to focus on reshop after you've cleaned up your zone.   Third, start early and stay vigilant. Keep moving. Be mindful of kids wrecking your work. I'll try to constantly be advancing, but it's faster to fix little areas that get trashed as you notice them than it is to come back and wave through the zone a second time.   What else...? If I'm working a pull or abandons earlier in the day, before I've started really zoning, I'll pick up the zone as best I can without breaking my gait. Grab a few things each aisle, face a few things as you walk by. Zoning toys can seem insurmountable but if you chip away at it early it'll lighten the load a bit (at least mentally). The thing that will eventually make it easier is just practice and familiarity. You'll get better with time and eventually it won't seem like such a huge task. Good luck! Try not to lose your temper.   EDIT: protip: it's better if your whole zone looks ""okay"" than if most of it looks great but a few aisles look like Hiroshima. Management tends to pick up on the negative more than the positive. If you manage your time well you'll at least be able to make everything somewhat presentable which makes it shoppable for the guest. I'm really anal about my zone so this aspect is hard for me but the real goal of zoning is just keeping up appearances, not necessarily price/location accuracy. With that in mind, any time you find an item that has room for multiple facings on the planogram, make multiple facings. A lot of new people will line items up in singular rows when they should be spreading them out. Just don't flex over other items until you get a little more familiar with planograms. This will make your aisles more impactful as well as helping out the instocks team."
Target,2wtgae,FrozenRaider,2,Mon Feb 23 02:52:17 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the reply. Really insightful! I had been just putting up out of place items as I went, and I kinda see how wasteful that is in terms of time. Appreciate all the feedback. Zoning really is my weakness so I appreciate your help!   Edit: also, it's good to know someone else knows the struggle of having to do both on a Saturday lol"
Target,2wtgae,Guadaloope,3,Mon Feb 23 03:31:20 2015 UTC,What I do that helps me is to have two separate carts for foreign/abandons. One cart specifically for toys/sporting goods and one for everywhere else in the store. Since I'm going to put up toys reshop anyway I can just leave it back by toys so I can take the out of area stuff up front and get whatever toys and electronics reshop there is. It helps cut down time on sorting.
Target,2wtgae,Guadaloope,1 point,Mon Feb 23 11:58:35 2015 UTC,"Good point. I do this too on weekends or if I know there's gonna be a lot of abandons. If I don't bring a second cart, I'll keep my foreign abandons in the basket at the top of the cart or underneath. It saves a lot of time if you don't have to go to guest service and sort."
Target,2wtgae,itsamutiny,2,Mon Feb 23 15:34:35 2015 UTC,You're welcome! Hope that clears a few things up for ya. I've been at this for a long time so feel free to ask if you have any other questions.
Target,2wtgae,Seveventeen,3,Mon Feb 23 03:34:40 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you're just not going to get it all done, so I developed a system to make things look as okay as possible in limited time.  ALWAYS hit the front endcaps. Always. They're the first thing anyone will notice, and decent endcaps can hide bad aisles.  Second, get everything off the base decks and off the floor. It's really easy to spot these things, so fixing them will immediately improve the overall zone. You can also remove any obvious reshop during this step.  Third, hit any aisles that look REALLY bad. This is sort of subjective and is based on how much time you have, but generally there will be aisles you can safely skip.  At this point, your zone should be relatively okay. It won't be perfect, but you'll have gotten all the really bad areas. If time permits, you can go back and start at the first aisle and touch up what's left.  If toys and electronics are across a main aisle from each other, don't do all of electronics and then all of toys. I would always start in F1 and F2, then cross the aisle and do E1 and E2, then E3 and E4, and finally F3 and F4. It seems to be less walking and I always felt like I got more done doing it that way."
Target,2wtgae,siiberiia,2,Mon Feb 23 04:10:53 2015 UTC,"Determine how long you can spend per aisle. Remember that you need to handle your reshop and do touch ups too. Say you have four hours and 30 aisles. That's 240 minutes, but cut 30 minutes for reshop. (240 - 30)  / 30 = 7 minutes each. Time yourself. Adhere to the necessary pace, no exceptions.  Pull all product forward in areas that it's visible such as a waist high shelf with pegs above it, but only one or two on the lower ones. Toss out of place product into a cart and handle it last.  Organize that cart by aisle. Time spent walking from e40 to e5 is time wasted."
Target,2wtgae,KatterpodOnRye,1 point,Mon Feb 23 08:35:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I separate girl toys and boy toys (doesn't take too long to visually distinguish pinks and purples from blues and greens), electronics side, and sporting goods, and work out all at once."
Target,2wtgae,irishdanmurphy,2,Tue Feb 24 13:43:57 2015 UTC,"Use a cart to take with you while zoning.  Leave it on the outside of each aisle and movie it if it's in the way of guests.  I usually would use a three tier cart so that I can organize reshop, garbage, repacks, and clothing.  Then always remember to ""cover the diamonds"" on the shelves.  Meaning: pull the product ahead as far as you can, and any subsequent merch.  It takes practice to get your timing down, but you should always start with ""worst first"".  So the crappiest areas to zone, like babies or board games for us, do first, and then touch it up later in the night after you've completed the easier zones and the areas least shopped.  Keep it up and it will get easier!"
Target,2wtgae,Spear253,2,Mon Feb 23 13:44:33 2015 UTC,"I usually take two empty carts from the lanes back to toys with me. If I'm zoning E1, I have my cart for reshop that goes to other areas at the endcap of E1 and the cart for reshop for toys on the endcap of E3. I also grab a handbasket and out it on the bottom of the cart for toys and put any book/games/CDs/movies into those and worry about putting those back last. They take forever and don't take up much space, so I let the morning guy worry about it.   Basically I zone as best as I possibly can (my zoning makes target look like meijer) and using this strategy, I'm done zoning with about an hour to two hours to spare. Then I worry about reshop afterwards.   Basically just bring both carts with you as you zone and put any out of place items into the corresponding cart for areas. Once I hit sporting goods, I take the cart for other areas to guest service for sorting, then grab another cart to last me the rest of the zone. I do the back wall last (as its the one that gets messed up most, anyway so I worry about it less) and then just zone electronics where it needs it most (skylanders, beats, ipad, batteries).   Using this routine, I usually finish my zone by 9 or 10 if I start at 7, and then usually finish reshop, but sometimes need to leave some for the opener.   If you have any questions, let me know. Electronics gotta stick together."
Target,2wtgae,Smokeeye123,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:44:49 2015 UTC,"I like to recommend how I zone to anyone new at my store, it seems to be faster and help the front end.

Target,2wtgae,cody2isdown,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:00:05 2015 UTC,Get like 2 or three carts and sort all the reshop you find. One could be kids toys and then the second could be fitness and sporting stuff for instance. This will save you the time from walking back and forth repeatedly.  Also do not superzone. If you come across a bin on the backwall for instance with like 400 things in the wrong spot dont spend 3 hours fixing it.
Target,2wsrca,mglwmnc,14,Sun Feb 22 21:22:52 2015 UTC,"As a team lead, you get 40 hours, which gives you the option to enroll in benefits (any team member with an average of 30 hours is eligible).  You also get alternate weekends off.  Depending on the position, it might be okay. I've heard a lot of ETLs complain that because they work so much, and they are on a salary, that they actually get paid less per hour than the senior team leads. If you're scheduled 40 hours, you work 40 hours. As an ETL, you're scheduled 40 hours, but most end up working 50, or 60... or 80."
Target,2wsrca,pohatu771,7,Sun Feb 22 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for an immediate source of income, I'd look in to it. However, as a TL you, obviously, will not make as much as an ETL, but you'll get to avoid the 60 hour work weeks. If you're looking to take the job in hope that you'll be promoted to ETL, I would run away as fast as possible. You see, Target changes constantly. Recently, in my area atleast, stores are losing ETL positions left and right. There is no room for any new ETL's due to the fact that they're all back filled by current ETL's. I had a friend that was a Sr. TL (a TL that does LOD -leader on duty- shifts) and he was in the exact situation you're in. He interviewed for ETL,  they said ""weeeelllll, we can give you Sr. TL, but I promise we'll promote you soon!"" Two years later, still a Sr. TL. Granted, he makes enough to put food on the table, but not near as much as an ETL. Just be sure you make the best choice for you. Good luck!"
Target,2wsrca,SovietEwok,3,Sun Feb 22 22:49:35 2015 UTC,"there's a tradeoff. salaried? you will be asked to work insane hours when we don't have salesfloor/ 4th quarter. if you compute the hourly rate you might make less than min wage during parts of the year.  a tl starts lower. depending on the state/store the tl's don't work overtime. you pick your schedule, have a set day off and every other weekend off. if you'd rather close, you can. open? sure!"
Target,2wsrca,monkeyman80,3,Mon Feb 23 02:23:24 2015 UTC,"At least in my store, all TLs are full time.

Seriously though, if it's like this in your district that's awesome, I think most people would agree this is far from normal for Target company wide and I wouldn't count on it as a viable career path."

Target,2wsrca,481072211,2,Mon Feb 23 19:17:16 2015 UTC,"I say go for it. There's room for growth in this company as long as you have your 4 year degree. I've seen lots of people come through my store and promote up to district and higher positions. If you get into the store and prove that you are worth a damn, you will move up.   I can only vouch for my store on this though. We are considered a ""training"" store. Something about the culture of our store sends folks off to bigger and better things. We've had a new Stl (store manager) once a year for the last 7 years. They've all been promoted."
Target,2wsrca,zomboni_steve,2,Mon Feb 23 04:47:42 2015 UTC,"I worked at target for 3 years, and heard and saw it all. Became good friends with ETLs and know that the information is reliable.   Target rarely promotes from with in. If you are trying to become a ETL it is a lot harder to do if you take the position as team lead. It is possible as I have seen it happen, but they will begin to over look you and look for outside people before promoting from within."
Target,2wsrca,Da_hambergler,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"If you're applying to a district that is doing well in sales, you have a shot in promoting to Sr. TL and then maybe ETL.  Downside: Politics  For a minimum of 18 months (This is not iron clad but I rarely see people move up that fast) you have to stay on your ETL's and STL's good side, because the moment you get marked as a poor performer that clock will reset and it'll get harder and harder to climb each time.  You will also be held accountable to your department's/Process' metrics, and shit tends to roll downhill.   Still, if you really want to do it this way it does look good to climb up.  Just remember that the transition to Sr. TL can also be hellish because you'll be a team lead with only 40 hours to work with on top of LOD shifts*.  *The LOD shifts are not supposed to be held against you as far as work accountability since you are running the whole store at that time, but that happens as much as pigs fly.  It's all gravy until a DTL visit has your STL getting bitched out and suddenly they're looking at you like you need a good old fashion crucifying."

Target,2wtfdc,onebread,3,Mon Feb 23 06:42:45 2015 UTC,It depends on which Target you're looking at in Orlando.  Most of the ones in Orlando have more Disney merchandise.  But a few of them do have a few items from Universal Studios.  Most of the stuff they do have is themed after Harry Potter though.

They will remove and condense a lot of the racks in softlines to make room for the mannequins. For our store it was a two day process to assemble all the fixtures.  Dressing the mannequins is a two person job. Trust me.  There's a book with the outfits in it, and it also has backup outfits for if you run out of something. The items on the mannequin definitely sell faster in my store than the other stuff."

Target,2wrnc3,wonderman911,11,Sun Feb 22 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"A employee at 9/hr that is scheduled for like 6 hours will make about 40 something after taxes give or take some dollars depending on scheduled time, pay rate and tax rates. So any given day, one of those employees will think to themselves, ""hm. It will only cost me 40 something dollars to not have to deal with XYZ today. That's totally worth it. Plus I save money on transportation. I'll just call off this once.""  Then multiply that feeling across many employees and there you have it. A bunch of call offs at once. And on top of that people actually have legitimate reasons to call off.   Now the people that no call no show, they'll be gone after doing that a few times. The people that call in will probably be ok. Maybe they'll get scheduled less if they do it too much. But what are you going to do? Fire that person and hire a new person you have to train that will do the same thing? Or just deal with it and spread the extra work across whoever actually does show up."

We can all do math.  An extra hour is like 6 bucks for some people and after 6-7 hours, it's not worth it to some people.  Sure it adds up over awhile, but what about those days they send people home early because they don't have the hours?"

Target,2wq1ko,IronOreAgate,2,Sun Feb 22 16:18:23 2015 UTC,"At one store, listening to music was a ""safety hazard"" whether you played out on speakers or just have one ear bud to listen to. They have us examples like you can't hear the fire alarm or walkie talkie communication.   Another store says it's okay before or after store hours. As long as no guests are around (in the backroom or sales floor, so long as you're listening to the walkie).  If you're going by the book, than no; but it's all store preference."
Target,2wq1ko,DoomedJanissary,3,Sun Feb 22 23:24:36 2015 UTC,Are you referring to the backroom TM or salesfloor TM because even my BR ETL plays music on his phone where we all can here it
Target,2wq1ko,DoomedJanissary,2,Mon Feb 23 01:56:45 2015 UTC,"I've worked at five different Targets. One was the district, so no music at all what so ever, another very laid back and didn't care if you played it or not, another would only Kat you play of out was before or after the store opens. These were during the BR/InStocks.   I said SF earlier because sometimes staying late or coming in early certain Targets do let you play music, others don't. It's all the leader's preference/if there's a visit."
Target,2wq1ko,DrMoomoo,2,Mon Feb 23 02:02:07 2015 UTC,"My backroom has a radio on both the light duty and receiving end along with a bluetooth speaker next to the light duty radio. We also have a separate stockroom for H&B and COSM but no one cares if you set your phone down to play through its speaker while working up there.  On a less directly related note but still specifically backroom, i haven't worn a name badge in 5 years because i once caught a box on it while descending a ladder and almost fell off and just refuse to do so for safeness reasons and generally wear a black hoodie during the winter months, even when im out on the floor for FA picks.  People are always confused by the guy with an RF gun, a funny looking cart but not in red and khaki, its gives a modicum of stealth while out in the unfamiliar land of the ""Salesfloor""."
Target,2wq1ko,anyquestions,4,Sun Feb 22 06:52:37 2015 UTC,Your store and district must be a lot less strict than mine. Team members wearing name badges is one of my group's non-negotiables (you'd be encouraged to wear a sticker name badge if you were worried about safety) and any outer wear also has to be red. But my STL is pretty big on personal brand.
Target,2wq1ko,IronOreAgate,2,Sun Feb 22 07:05:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I stopped wearing my name tag as well. Mine mostly just kept falling off every time I lifting anything.
Target,2wmvxa,CarlosTheChick,5,Sat Feb 21 06:49:52 2015 UTC,"With the difficultly of accumulator updates without SUBT existing anymore in the RF apps, basically anytime a POG resets you need to burn everything that you just backstocked the next time it batches.  And dont just say you pulled what it wanted in this case, blow it the fuck up, pull 999, yes thats all, then put it back.  This can also be an issue with improper grouping/backstocking.  With the binder example, i only have one open stock shelf in my ofce aisle(shelf 2) and it marked as such but people love filling it with case stock and putting open on shelf 6 anyway, so it will always pull case pack quantity from shelf 6, i maybe pull half and put the rest back immediately.  If you do underpull it will likely be fixed by the next truck push and if you really messed up, thats what Instocks is for.  This is already way to long but if you have time, check to make sure its tied correctly to the floor, i find unbroken ties all the damn time.  Also palleted quantified pet food, no gun, you do not need 30 bags of Meow Mix, ill give you four, 26 are going right back into location."
Target,2wmvxa,DrMoomoo,2,Sat Feb 21 07:47:59 2015 UTC,"I'm curious: if we say 'no, that isn't all' and enter the quantity we intended to STO, does that work as well? Or must we actually say no then toggle to STO and enter the quantity?"
Target,2wmvxa,DelTrigger,3,Sat Feb 21 22:02:26 2015 UTC,if you cay no while in a PULL batch it doesn't ask for quantity it just leaves it non quantified and flags it for the next audit.
Target,2wmvxa,DrMoomoo,2,Sun Feb 22 02:55:24 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, meant when you're backstocking, not in a pull batch.  I was told that if you just sit in SUBT, scan the item and location, pull 999, say 'no', and then enter the quantity you would have STOed, it would function the same way.  To me, it seemed like that would cause a bunch of problems but I didn't see any irregular amount of baffles or a larger audit. Is this a proper way to do it?"
Target,2wmvxa,DelTrigger,3,Sun Feb 22 03:06:29 2015 UTC,"that used to be the way to do it was i was told that it did cause baffles a few years back, maybe with the new system that can be safely done now without making the next audit huge, i am not certain."
Target,2wmvxa,DrMoomoo,2,Sun Feb 22 03:18:42 2015 UTC,"Well, my ETL said it shouldn't cause baffles, so I guess I'll stick with it unless I hear otherwise. Thanks for the info."
Target,2wmvxa,DelTrigger,2,Sun Feb 22 03:34:57 2015 UTC,"Just a fair warning to anyone reading this, using 999 is punishable by termination at my store. They are very laid back on everything but that. Ask for TL or ETL before using it."
Target,2wmvxa,Avoid_Calm,2,Wed Feb 25 01:19:55 2015 UTC,"Does your store not have instocks limited to outs and crit lows? Often with underpulling, it doesn't get caught and rectified in research for quite some time."
Target,2wmvxa,Crimson_Steel,3,Tue Mar 3 23:23:59 2015 UTC,We call it faking but we do do it occasionally.  They don't like us to brcause we're supposed to be filling the floor but if it's a case of 20 binders we would most likely do the same.
Target,2wmvxa,the_legend_2828,2,Sat Feb 21 07:21:32 2015 UTC,"I see. It's weird. It does that everyday for us. Like it would have us pull 4 of those POD things from a location in the CHEM aisle. Fair enough. Same aisle, 4 more. I would probably now burn 2 or 3 and just take one. Same aisle, case stock, same item, 8. Burn. Same item, case stock, 8, burn. I don't get it. It seems like i'm burning in pretty much every batch to avoid this. And if it asks to pull what has just been backstocked within the past 2 hours, I typically just burn all of it."
Target,2wmvxa,FenrirSM,3,Sat Feb 21 07:27:50 2015 UTC,"Terminology is weird. We call it walking.  Regardless, if the people who are in charge say it's okay... It's okay. And that's that."
Target,2wmvxa,Rilo12,2,Sat Feb 21 15:20:43 2015 UTC,What is burning?
Target,2wmvxa,itsamutiny,2,Sun Feb 22 00:26:03 2015 UTC,It's when you pull and immediately backstock an item.
Target,2wmvxa,Rilo12,2,Sun Feb 22 01:33:52 2015 UTC,"I've done that before but it will just appear in the next caf. I have yet to try subt999 but will the next time I notice it happen. I think the biggest waste of time are new pog fills, I'm told to pull everything and that is just how it is. Anyway to tell in advance how much to accurately pull?"
Target,2wmvxa,itsamutiny,2,Sun Feb 22 01:55:02 2015 UTC,"That happens because it doesn't know the floor is full. Let's say 5 of an item sell when the POG is supposed to fit 10, so now it drops into a batch and wants you to pull 5. But let's say a guest happened to return one and it's been put back on the floor. Now there's 6 on the floor, but the accumulator usually doesn't realize that and has you pull 5 anyways, resulting in one getting sent to backstock. But unless you actually go to the floor and check, you can't know, which once resulted in the same set of king size yellow jersey sheets being pulled every day for at least a week at my store. It's a pain in the ass. Subt999 is supposed to trick the accumulator into thinking the floor is completely full, which should stop it from constantly repulling the same items. Reshop, poor zones, and incorrect shelf capacities also impact this process.  Unfortunately, not really. I would always just pull whatever the gun said and then backstock as needed, and if it took up too much time, well, they ought to fix things. Clearly they aren't worried about it so I tried to not worry about it either."
Target,2wmvxa,radio_dead,2,Sun Feb 22 03:39:59 2015 UTC,Anything over 8 items I only take half...pull 8 then backstock 4

God i hate target, the more your learn of whats expected the dumber etls seem.  Now the way we do it is i'm the one that scans the isles in exf and pull only enough to fill. Then i push it all my self while covering sales floor and backup cashiering every 3 mins. If it's truck day i do that too at the same time.

That little green button below the bottom left of the pda screen, it does the same thing as shift 7.  and burning is a good idea. the computer knows what's going on most of the time, but there is no reason to trust it 100% of the time. If something seems excessive, burn some of it. worse case scenario is the shelf is only half full. but it's a waste of time to pull 50 of something to just to have 45 of it to come back."

Target,2wlp5b,Robingshade,5,Sat Feb 21 06:00:15 2015 UTC,"Pay depends on position and location. The thing that's setting wally apart on this is that $9 will be the bare minimum for whatever their lowest paid position is (pretty sure its cashiers at target) in all regions. If you make over 9 as a cashier in a state with 7.25 minimum, then I'd be amazed. But if you're backroom or something else that's not a sf tm, cashier or ca, I wouldn't be surprised you make over 9.

Target,2wlp5b,sheerio,3,Wed Feb 25 02:59:52 2015 UTC,Pay raises are based on a percentage. I forget what that number is but there is a max you can get each year no matter what you do. (I think my last raise was 26 cents?) getting your state to raise the minimum wage is probably the fastest way to get from $7.75 to $9/hr
Target,2wlp5b,not_a_banana,2,Sat Feb 21 11:21:16 2015 UTC,I THINK the way it works is that it depends on how well your store does and your review scores. 1-5% raise.  O-5  EX-4  E-3  IE-2  U-1
Target,2wlp5b,FUCKREDDIQUETTE,2,Sun Feb 22 22:06:42 2015 UTC,"Really The only difference between us and Walmart it appearance. Target doesn't have concrete floors (we have fancy tiles!) and better shelves.  As a result people think target is the nicer place and attracts a ""higher class"" customer, then they automatically assume target employees are treated better. Maybe it's because I'm part time but... It honestly seems like Walmart would be the better place to work based on pay"
Target,2wlp5b,aimiami,3,Sat Feb 21 22:43:40 2015 UTC,he is talking about walmart right?

Target,2wlp5b,Fr0stSoldier,1 point,Sat Feb 21 02:56:09 2015 UTC,"You get to 'negotiate' wages when you promote or get hired.  I quote negotiate because the Team Lead paygrade has been broken up into multiple rates so you can try and fight for the highest one though that will probably be hard.    At best you'll get an O on your merit review which, depending on the region, can be 3 to 5%.   Also, I'm fairly sure Target just gave a giant middle finger to the news agency's question about matching Wal-mart."

Target,2wkk5m,Besnasty,3,Fri Feb 20 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"Sales floor hours have been minimal, at least in our store. Back room and cashiers are better off for hours and in many stores they're harder up for coverage.  Cashier typically pays the same as sales floor and back to makes more. If you're consistently scheduled BR for half or more of your hours, you should speak with hr about a work center change and pay raise."

We also only have a mid on Friday and Saturday that week, and we stay pretty steady. It's very frustrating."
Target,2wkk5m,funplex,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:01:31 2015 UTC,"That happens if you're cross trained depending on hours. Heads up, if  you are working more than 50% of your hours in the backroom you're entitled to a pay increase since backroom is a higher paygrade."
Target,2wkk5m,MJska,1 point,Sat Feb 21 22:10:53 2015 UTC,They were trying to give you hours. At my store I am also sales floor and the past month or so I'll maybe get one 4 hour sales floor shift a week and the rest was cashier and electronics. They just don't have any sales floor hours so they were trying to help you out.
Target,2whdd7,MonkeyBrick,14,Thu Feb 19 22:41:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on the store, really. A well trained and motivated Cart Attendant is like the best damn swiss army knife on the planet. As a GSA (Front End Supervisor, the guy who asks you to do stuff); I've had some really awful, but some REALLY awesome CA's in my time.  Be willing to help. Yes, you're a ""Cart Attendant"". Your main job is to get carts into the building. But you'll also clean and inspect the restrooms, take out garbage, perform carry outs, grab supplies and shift them around, ring out guests, and a thousand other things.  Be fast, do the job well, and your bosses will LOVE you. I have an immense respect for my Cart Attendants. Without them, I couldn't run the front end nearly as well as I do."
Target,2whdd7,Isak922,3,Thu Feb 19 23:40:30 2015 UTC,"This is beyond true, the CA's are a godsend. Also is youre really good you can get one of the lods or gsa's to requisition you some drinks also"

And I'll gladly hook them up with a drink, some snacks, and not be on their asses as much. Because they get their tasks done consistently. Hell, one of them had EVERYTHING done by 9:30. Told him to take an extra 15 and relax, and grabbed him some Monster. Then taught him how to reshop for his last hour. It was glorious!"

Target,2whdd7,Da_hambergler,2,Mon Feb 23 17:27:07 2015 UTC,My store (And Leadership) treats GSA's as actual Leadership roles. While I can't document and coach myself... My GSTL's and ETL-GE will have my back on any verbal coaching I give my team members.
Target,2whdd7,Isak922,6,Mon Feb 23 18:44:47 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to disrespect any CA's here but......you're going to be the store's bitch. I have the utmost respect for the CA's at my store compared to any other position. Not only do you have the most labor intensive job in the store by pushing carts all day but you have to answer calls for spills, carry outs as well clean up the bathrooms. I would recommend talking to HR after 3months to switch positions once you get the job. Or else you'll be working the hardest for the lowest pay grade in the store."
Target,2whdd7,sajey,2,Fri Feb 20 04:49:57 2015 UTC,"this says it best.   there are going to be days where in a span of an hour you're asked to clean up 3 spills. while doing carry outs (bringing items the guest brought to their car. you'll learn to love people buying a 50' item and bringing a smart car and expecting you to make it fit). and hey can you bring some stuff from the back/storage areas? food areas need their trash emptied. oh and yes, you're still going to need carts to be stocked, hand baskets available. and bathrooms need to be cleaned, when it'll take up to 20 minutes for you to get access to the womens bathroom.  that's outside of actually doing the job as described. depending on the weather in the area, snow/ice is probably awful to work in. rain is horrible, expect to be drenched. if its hot out, well you'll lose a few lbs a shift.   depending on the store they can ask the cart attendants to do a lot of front end stuff. i can't remember what a friend said his store had him do. but its an insane workload.   worst part its usually just expected by the etl/stl's. we have some drama with our guys, but i always have their backs."
Target,2whdd7,monkeyman80,1 point,Sun Feb 22 01:58:10 2015 UTC,Depends on the store. Some have brand attendants that clean spills/bathrooms and the CA's only get carts/do carryouts really. Usually only bigger Targets have brand attendants from what I've seen.

Our cameras where perpendicular to the ways the cars parked. If they were close enough, I wouldn't be able to get a tag until they pulled out. And when they did, I had to preform a masterful skill of pan, zooming in, and focusing to get it. For extra insurance, I'd call my CA and have him go and and get it. Of course, the trick is not to look obvious. I had one go who was amazing at it. He could catch a tag, make and model from two or three rows over."

I have to set sales planners in market, check COOL labels, cull, pull milk, make sure you're steritech ready, ect. For me, I had to deal with vendors too, but I don't think that's a requirement for everyone.  There are going to be times when you have to make crucial decisions. For example, if you're an opener, after the morning routine, you usually have about an hour and a half to make sure your produce tables and milk are filled. But let's say your meat section is completely empty. Would you still continue to do the produce tables and milk first or fill up that large hole in your section?  Again, this was a small volume store that I deal with. It's different when you have another person to help you with it though. I usually split up responsibilities and get things done fast and efficient."

Target,2w9rtp,justini87,2,Wed Feb 18 13:28:03 2015 UTC,really that's the appeal. you have hours. hardlines right now is around 8 hours. we try to give them cashier hours.
Target,2w9rtp,monkeyman80,2,Thu Feb 19 02:14:40 2015 UTC,4 people have quit in market since ive worked there and ive been there for less then 6 months.  Its about to be 5 cause i cant stand it.  I work every fucking friday and saturday night for 8 hours.  I asked to change it cause i want a social life being in college and they were in shock... its like they dont understand its 3 times the work.  They either need to raise the pay or hire more people a night (at least at my target idk about others)
Target,2w9rtp,aimiami,6,Sat Feb 21 08:49:51 2015 UTC,"I've worked in market since our store opened, which is about two years.  As far as pay, I'm not sure how they'd work it at yours, but I know that our store we started at a 50 cent increase in market. (Base pay was 9/hr. We got 9.50/hr)  However, you WILL be overworked and stressed. To me, and I've worked in every other dept the past two years as a flexible TM, market is definitely one of the more challenging dept. The fact that you have three market TM at your store is great (High volume store?) Because at mine, there's only one other person besides me.  Will you get more hours? Most likely, especially since they'll make you work HL on top of market. Is it worth the pay? That depends on how well you do under stress.  If the market TL is a dick (I have one also, so it must be a requirement lol) then be ready to have all the blame put on you when something isn't done correctly or speedily.  Also, health inspections are a pain but for the most part they'll let a few things slide if you take care of it asap.  If you get a chance to talk to vendors, be nice and try to make friends with them, it saves you headaches in the long run.  So ultimately, if you can handle high stress and fast paced work, it can be worth the pay increase and fun. It's up to you to weigh the pros and cons.  Oh, and definitely invest in a good, warm, red jacket. I have one and I have worn it every shift for two years. It get COLD. Even if it's 90* F outside, it's cold in market lol  Hopefully I helped answer a few questions, if not, I'll try my best to answer any others."

Target,2w9rtp,indigoibex,1 point,Wed Feb 18 14:04:49 2015 UTC,"It's a lot of work, but I enjoy it. In my store at least, you're left alone a lot more than in hardlines or softlines because most people don't really understand the processes in market which is nice (as long as you're able to motivate yourself to get a lot of stuff down in a little amount of time). Our market team is small and we have each others backs if we notice someone forgot to finish something and will do it ourselves. No pay increase at my store unless you become a PA."

Target,2w9lrr,Haunter20X,11,Wed Feb 18 02:19:37 2015 UTC,"Is it really an issue?   It's not going to help you in anyway to report it. Just like team members, ETL's want to make themselves look good.   Also. Think about the trickle down effect. If the STL gets onto the ETL's about those not being finished yet, who are the ETL's going to get on about that? The TL's and or Team members. Don't see the point there.   As long as they are getting done and worked, oh well."
Target,2w9lrr,iJeffwuh,2,Wed Feb 18 03:30:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  What do you gain by reporting it? Absolutely nothing, except potentially making your work harder. There's no benefit to ratting on your ETLs about this."
Target,2w9lrr,PasswordIsntClop,3,Wed Feb 18 04:52:47 2015 UTC,"There are lots of people that care and work hard to get their and others jobs done. The issue is many ETLs only care about themselves looking good and not the store actually running well.  Unfortunately, I've found the healthiest option is to also stop caring. I've had team members kick and scream and work their ass off to get things done the right way, but all they ever get is lip service.  If you still have any fight left in you, why not try and get things fixed?  If you're already working your hardest, its not going to make your job any more physically demanding. It will start wearing you down mentally though."
Target,2w9lrr,zieen,2,Wed Feb 18 14:32:47 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what's happening to me. I love working here a lot and you are absolutely right in terms of my ETLs and it hitting me mentally. I don't like half-assing things and I take pride in doing what I do. The hardest part is trying not to care, I'm just not that kind of person. I feel I'm better than that and value myself and my work ethic."

Target,2w9lrr,NECbelts,2,Thu Feb 26 07:17:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry I don't quite follow what you're asking. Your ETLs are hiding electronics backstock from the trucks in places where your STL won't see them when they walk the stockrooms? If so, then I don't follow the last part as well. If your ETLs are hiding backstock from your STL, then that really isn't your STL's fault, because he/she isn't aware of it happening. And no, that is not apart of best practice either. It's probably just your ETLs not wanted to get chewed out by your STL for not having a clean truck unload (everything pushed and backstocked)."

Target,2w9lrr,IronOreAgate,0,Thu Feb 19 02:12:43 2015 UTC,If I was directly asked how much back stock there is. I wouldn't lie. I would say how many carts. Even say the etl asked you to moved them if questioned further.  But its not your job to tattle on your etl. So unless it is effecting your instocks or sales noticeably. I would let it be. But that's my opinion.
Target,2w9n42,Fr0stSoldier,4,Wed Feb 18 02:31:10 2015 UTC,"If its your first year, then it probably won't be much, unfortunately. I was a 4th quarter seasonal hire about 3 and a half years ago, and at my first performance review I got a $0.06 pay raise. However, I have seen team members receive more than that, and it really depends on how your team leaders ""graded"" you for that year. I believe the scale range is poor-inconsistently effective-effective-outstanding (Don't quote me, there might be one more in the mix). Typically for your first year, you'll be in the inconsistently effective range. Although it sounds bad, it's really not. It is basically because you're a newer team member, and means you are performing as expected for a new team member. Your pay percentage per year should increase substantially each year if you just keep doing what you're expected to."
Target,2w9n42,NECbelts,3,Wed Feb 18 03:30:50 2015 UTC,"I must add that each team has a total limit to amount of raises they can give out. So for example if you're entire sales floor team deserved an O grade, only 1 or 2 of you will get an O grade and the rest will either get E or IE. The higher your grade is the higher your pay raise is. Don't expect much for a raise this year, or any years."
Target,2w9n42,sajey,1 point,Wed Feb 18 04:04:05 2015 UTC,"You're leaving out Ex (excellent). Generally a store can get one or two Os and then everyone else that might deserve one gets and Ex.  For leaders, your score is based off of the store score. Whatever your store scored for the year, you have that, plus an additional 15 points you can earn.  I don't think that applies to TM though."
Target,2w9n42,zieen,1 point,Wed Feb 18 14:37:00 2015 UTC,"Any idea how much the raise is for Effective and Outstanding ? I was hired seasonal, but was told I was the only one getting an above average review. I figured it would be like 10 cents."
Target,2w9n42,CarlosTheChick,1 point,Wed Feb 18 05:18:43 2015 UTC,"I went from IE to E to O. It went from about .75% to 4.5% to 6.0% if I recall correctly.

Target,2w9n42,rh51too,1 point,Wed Feb 18 07:15:01 2015 UTC,"First off, raises are prorated. Since you got hired around summer, you've probably been working for about 9 months. If you were eligible for a 12 cent raise, you'd only get 9.  That said, my first year was about a nickel, next year or two was probably 11 cents. Last year I managed to get 24 cents - despite the whole December ""hack"" - and I think I got an IE rating, maybe E."

My argument (and my business degree backs this up) is that it's better to keep a team member they've already trained and move them into an available sales floor (or anything) position and hire someone new for plano than to force the unhappy person to stay on plano, and end up hiring two new team members when the unhappy person inevitably leaves."
Target,2w85xr,Skywise87,5,Tue Feb 17 19:44:41 2015 UTC,Logistics Team Leader here.  You need to talk to your LOG ETL and have a conversation about support. I understand how stressful backroom day can be but it all starts with partnership.  LOD needs to help you at all times. Especially when you are doing 12 hour shifts. Your success is also dependent of your Team Leader and the Truck/Flow process.

She knows its bad but its really hard to find people for backroom and hiring off the street doesnt work as well as moving people who are already familiar with the store.  There's no pay incentives so the competent people can find work at other places.  It's just sort of an unfortunate impossible situation.  I don't think some of the other LODs really knew how bad it was until I came in the other day at 11 am and saw that none of the research had been done (5 research batches and 14 exf batches) in addition to the audit.  I had a complete meltdown and started freaking out and had to pull one of them into the AP office and just vent for a couple minutes about how everything is terrible.  We have peopel who are backroom trained in Ship From Store who were totally capable of helping and they had almost no workload to do for the day but instead of helping they just take what workload they have and make it last forever by staying on their phone.  It's complete bullshit and it pisses me off.  As to the TL thing, like I said my team lead up and disappeared during the busiest hour of the day (12 pulls) and left for 2 weeks with no explanation or warning).  How he still has a job is mindboggling."
Target,2w85xr,munkymedic,2,Tue Feb 17 20:26:39 2015 UTC,My Instocks Team Member usually pulls their own batches if backroom does not have time.  I do the Audits since it is more efficient to have a TL or ETL doing it. TMs have no business doing these. Since they are audits.  Then the schedule for backroom day is always: 1 TM from 9 AM to 3 PM. <- Takes care of SDA and as many EXF/Research/POG pulls as possible before 11 CAFs. Also takes break before 11. 1 TM from 1230 PM to 8 PM <- Takes care of 12s with other TM and continues with ONLY with CAF batches throughout the day. Has backup until 3 and has to plan lunches and breaks around the other TM.   Always communicate with everyone.
Target,2w85xr,monkeyman80,2,Tue Feb 17 20:34:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think instocks has ever pulled their own batches at my store.  There is an audit every day of the week.  Unless the BRTL is opening every day of the week, the audit is going to have to be done by a TM at some point.  I've never seen anyone that wasn't backroom even fathom doing the morning audit.  I'm not really sure I follow the logic of not having TMs do the audits unless you suspect theft or something else that AP could probably just investigate anyway.  Our schedule is    Opener:  7:30 AM - 4:00 PM Mid:  11:00 AM - 6: 00 PM Closer:  4:00PM - 11:30PM   Opener is responsible for return to stocks from MyFA, then 7:30 pulls, then Suspect Date Audit, then the regular Audit followed by research til 11am or so when the CAFs start.  Mid is mostly just a shift to help with 11-5 cafs and cover breaks/lunches.  Closer is there for last 2 hours of pulling, then is responsible for price change/ptm/street date, receiving grocery deliveries, setting the line/putting down pallets for Flow/truck and then cleaning up carbdoard and backstock.  I communicate with all the other departments and TMs and TLs as much as possible.  I think people in general tend to trust me since I take initiative but it taxes me because everyone comes to me with their problems and thinks backroom is full of screw ups (which is half true)."

Now we've got an entire truck team. It takes about an hour to unload our tiny trucks, them they work the freight until 8-9pm."

Now?  It's all dicked up because we all know too many employees do nothing but decrease profitable sales. (?)  The trucks don't arrive on schedule the way they used to because they have to make more stops.  Overnight is basically just a cleaning crew and little if no restocking or unloading takes place.  Hardly any team members arrive before 7 am because it costs too much to pay people to come in early. Stocking and restocking is a mess and resets are a disaster but nobody can figure out why because ""all the other stores can do it.""  Team members used to care.  Now?

Target,2vt79t,throwawaydashboard,16,Fri Feb 13 21:57:37 2015 UTC,"Normally ""hot items"" are NOT put on hold, especially something like this that had limited quantities. Rule is that it has to be on the floor for 15 minutes before team members can buy, guests are ALWAYS first"
Target,2vt79t,Andosphere,12,Fri Feb 13 22:31:48 2015 UTC,This.  Its in your employee handbook.
Target,2vt79t,s13drfthvn,8,Fri Feb 13 23:17:30 2015 UTC,Definitely not allowed and the LOD that gave permission should be talked to as well.  It seems pretty obvious that you shouldn't be able to use your position to put yourselves in front of guests.
Target,2vt79t,DelTrigger,4,Sat Feb 14 00:47:00 2015 UTC,"i look the other way on most questionable things. hey something is repack/online etc, its a great chance. and then wait for it to be put on salesfloor.  the most i've pushed it is that there's an online set that can't be put in on a shelf because it's individual items. i let my guest service team this isn't going to be a removal/final, but don't do this shit again.   maybe you had a chill lod who didn't care/know. we had our electronics tl warning that there's going to be a rush. no one believed him. we had one new person working electronics.."
Target,2vt79t,monkeyman80,9,Sat Feb 14 03:27:16 2015 UTC,Yes it is policy. You cannot use your employment as an advantage. You attempted to put something on hold before it was available for guests.  The LOD gave you a break. They could have terminated you just for placing it on hold before it was available for guests.   I suggest reading the team member handbook as well instead of asking folks over the internet. It has all the team member purchase policies defined.
Target,2vt79t,AforAnarchist,2,Sat Feb 14 01:08:07 2015 UTC,"yea that's a big no no, HD "" high demand"" items or items not yet released (street dated)  can not be held. This is so guest can have a chance to get it. The person in electronics should have known that, and told you that it couldn't be done. I know this being an electronics tm my self. Also a dumb 3ds with a different paint job is not worth your job."
Target,2vt79t,Sciencekitten,2,Sun Feb 15 01:15:57 2015 UTC,"Corporate wants to ensure that guests have the ability to purchase it. As far as I know, best practice doesn't say anything about holding limited edition items, but many stores (all that I know of) don't hold them. It does say that you have to wait until the products hit the floor, and give guests a reasonable amount of time to buy them. So you'd have to purchase it on your break (or otherwise off the clock) without any special treatment; one can't be put 'on the side' or 'misplaced and then found' for you.  Your story's lacking details, but if one LOD told you something against best practice or store policy, they have no obligation to hold that promise if another LOD corrected you on it. If it were a guest it might be excused for the sake of vibe, but not for a TM.  EDIT: Confused about the downvotes. Can someone explain?"
Target,2vt79t,anyquestions,0,Fri Feb 13 22:32:29 2015 UTC,"While there isn't a policy in place, there is no way anyone - guest or team member - would ever get to put an item on hold before it was even available for sale.  We don't even hold new items like that until demand has settled."
Target,2vt79t,pohatu771,7,Fri Feb 13 22:38:10 2015 UTC,Yes there is a policy in place. The team member purchase guidelines are outlined in the handbook. Should have been a term according to CCA policy.
Target,2vt79t,AforAnarchist,-1,Sat Feb 14 01:09:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it's an official policy, but I can kind of see their reasoning. If employees were allowed to hold limited quantity items like that for themselves, the store could run into a situation where they're already sold out of an item before the general public has had a chance to buy it. They probably don't think it's worth the potential disgruntled guests or a reputation of never having the ""big new thing"" in stock.   In a similar vein, an employee at my store got fired for abusing his job to get a TV on Black Friday. He showed up at the store in uniform even though he wasn't scheduled for the first shift and was let in since everyone just assumed he was working. Then, once the store opened, he was already inside and was able to get to the electronics well ahead of everyone else. Definitely more of an abuse of power in that situation, but I can see how corporate wouldn't want to encourage that kind of behavior."

Target,2vp9kr,dubblechzburger,1 point,Fri Feb 13 02:16:14 2015 UTC,Man it's crazy how I don't know the song at all and then the exact moment it hits the part where it cuts in on the MMB TVs and I instantly know it perfectly for about 30 seconds.
Target,2vo9ct,Tomsnook,11,Thu Feb 12 18:02:39 2015 UTC,Yep. They just give someone else keys for 2 hours and tell people to listen out. It's stupid but most of what the company does is backwards.
Target,2vo9ct,IamNOTGaryBusey,3,Thu Feb 12 18:40:56 2015 UTC,"Weird, we come in at 7am at our store. We do a check of the end caps and 4x4 cd/dvd/book locations and flex outs. Then flex video games, use the screen wipes on the tablets, phones, wii u pad etc. and check peg hooks.  Thankfully our store has a different layout from most so it's not near seasonal and toys is further down from electronics rather than across so we don't have to deal with that. And greeting cards is across from us which is vendor so we don't have to deal with anything across from us."
Target,2vo9ct,dubblechzburger,2,Sat Feb 14 00:40:50 2015 UTC,Yep. No one really comes in at 8am for electronics anyways so they think it's better to have them during the peak hours rather than doing nothing at 8am.
Target,2vo9ct,Zlyphor,3,Thu Feb 12 19:15:50 2015 UTC,"No one really comes in at 8am for electronics   This isn't remotely true. Electronics is my section during truck unload, and on days when they come in at 9 or 10, I can't get any work done due to being bombarded with customers.   And I'm in a small town; I can't imagine what that's like in busier locations."
Target,2vo9ct,alchemist5,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:54:59 2015 UTC,This store is typically busy in electronics toys and seasonal and electronics covers it all. So now there will be noone for 2 hours. Let alone the endcaps and projects electronics takes care of in the morning before we get busy.
Target,2vo9ct,anyquestions,1 point,Thu Feb 12 20:11:43 2015 UTC,"Granted I'm at an A volume store, but that would never happen at mine. My electronics openers go through instocks for their area and flex over video game cases and toy endcaps, as well as generally helping out with coverage in the back of the store."
Target,2vo9ct,anyquestions,1 point,Thu Feb 12 19:21:34 2015 UTC,Thats exactly what my store does too. Electronics pretty much owns toys and seasonal too here.
Target,2vo9ct,pohatu771,1 point,Thu Feb 12 20:09:43 2015 UTC,"Well, at my store electronics helps with calls for toys and seasonal until Hardlines coverage improves closer to peak hour. Then they're left on their own til they help us with the closing zone. If they have down time throughout the day they jump in and touch up the first few aisles of toys. But with a store of my volume, if they owned toys and seasonal nothing would get done over there. Especially not if you want your guest service scores to be green."

Target,2vfpmt,SoulCrystal,1 point,Wed Feb 11 03:48:12 2015 UTC,Did your store have that Touchdowm phase every time someone got a red card?
Target,2vfpmt,justini87,3,Tue Feb 10 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean so probably not; just different etl's who happen to be there when they're announced going ""WOOOO"" or ""WAY TO GO <blank>"" or the ever popular ""<blank> UNTIL WE MEET OUR GOAL"".   I get it that they're probably judged by their own higher ups on redcards and the like, but whenever my guests hear them updating redcard counts and going bananas, it loses my ability to have honest conversations after helping them- it comes off less as helpful advice and more like corporate greed."
Target,2vfpmt,PasswordIsntClop,3,Wed Feb 11 02:46:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly, holy shit. This behavior always baffled me. I'm glad someone else noticed it. It's so awkward having someone hear the LOD badgering all of us to ""go get redcards"" and then have me turn right around and immediately try to push one on somebody. It comes off as incredibly dishonest."
Target,2vfpmt,indigoibex,2,Wed Feb 11 19:43:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we had something like this (who can get the most red cards in a day) around the time I started. It's just supposed to try and put a little fun into the job."

Target,2ve1ao,adamb10,3,Tue Feb 10 05:38:38 2015 UTC,"If someone called out, I wouldn't worry about not pulling on time too much - if that ever happens again just make sure to get in contact with the LOD so they can bring someone who is cross-trained in backroom to help you out.  If you're new, you'll get faster over time just from doing so many repetitions of batch pulling. Some more specific things that helped me speed up a lot were taking my cart with me to whatever location I pulled from so you aren't spending time walking back and forth to the end of the aisle or whatever.  Also, put down your PDA when adding stuff to your vehicle. I still have a habit of holding onto it and trying to pull things out of the waco one-handed and it's much slower.  Take a look at the CAF pull monitor too. You can access it on any of the store computers (ask your team lead how, it's confusing to get to and you have to click through a bunch of pages). It'll show you who pulled each batch, how many items were pulled, how long it took the TM to pull the batch, and the expected time it should take to pull.  As long as you aren't overshooting the expected time frame by too much, you're doing fine. If you're still new and going over the limit, don't worry too much, you'll naturally get faster with more experience. After about a month, you should be pulling under the expected time. At my store, TMs should ideally pull at around half the expected time listed on the monitor.  If you have anymore questions about backroom, let me know and good luck!"
Target,2ve1ao,CrouchingCrab,3,Tue Feb 10 09:49:13 2015 UTC,"If someone called out, I wouldn't worry about not pulling on time too much   My store has a policy that you always have to tell the LOD if you think you won't finish pulling on time without extra help. Then, the LOD will send somebody back to help pull so that you do finish pulling on time.  OP, you should check your store's policy on this."
Target,2ve1ao,Kehndy12,1 point,Tue Feb 10 14:02:46 2015 UTC,I know about the CAF monitor.  Is there a way to check your pull times for a previous day?
Target,2ve1ao,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,1 point,Wed Feb 11 15:38:11 2015 UTC,You can't check times but there are batch completion scores you can look at. They're in the replenishment of your stores myPerformance page. It takes about 3 days for a day to show up there.
Target,2ve1ao,retromike,2,Wed Feb 11 22:19:12 2015 UTC,Im still new to this and only work cashier but can someone tell me what cafs are?
Target,2ve1ao,rh51too,6,Tue Feb 10 06:28:07 2015 UTC,"CAF's are batches of merchandise to be restocked on the sales floor during the day based on sales.  CAFs come every hour from 12-7, except 6pm.  BR TM's put the batches on vehicles for sales floor TMs to push to the floor.  Also typically called pulls."
Target,2ve1ao,the_legend_2828,3,Tue Feb 10 06:30:32 2015 UTC,"It differs from store to store, for example my store we only have CAFs 1-6 and our backroom TMs push the CAFs."
Target,2ve1ao,SirFartsinHand,3,Tue Feb 10 18:45:55 2015 UTC,Ours drop from 12-5 with price change at six.
Target,2ve1ao,Kehndy12,3,Tue Feb 10 23:10:36 2015 UTC,"CAF stands for Created Auto Fill...just so you know!  Based on sales throughout the day, they drop in order to replenish the sales floor of items that are selling.  Most don't know that that's what it stands for, whip it at your boss & they may be impressed!"
Target,2ve1ao,FenrirSM,2,Tue Feb 10 22:18:14 2015 UTC,"In addition to what has been said:   Prepare for the next hour's CAFs by placing empty carts/tubs with pull clips on them around the backroom where you expect to need them. (This will prevent you from wasting time: grabbing an empty tub, pushing it to where you need it, and grabbing a pull clip.) If you're pulling a CAF in one area of the backroom and the rest of the items in the CAF are at the other end of the backroom, stop pulling the current batch and start pulling a different batch. After you have a few CAFs to pull at the other end of the backroom, pull those at the same time. In other words, don't run back and forth in the backroom if you don't have to. This tip gets fuzzy because you don't want to start pulling too many different CAFs without finishing them, because I believe the report will show that you spent a long time pulling all of these different CAFs you started to pull but stopped pulling. However, at my store, pulling all of the hour's CAFs within the hour is more important than pulling each individual CAF quickly."
Target,2ve1ao,zieen,2,Tue Feb 10 14:21:01 2015 UTC,Make sure the piece of equipment you're using isn't laggy or has trouble scanning. Having a PDA that doesn't pick up barcodes well or is just being plain slow can easily double the time it takes to do your pulls.
Target,2ve1ao,FirePowerCR,1 point,Tue Feb 10 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"Adding on to this: use MC9200 PDAs not 9090s and DEFINITELY not LPDAs (for reference, an LPDA is something like a 625 MHz processor and a 9200 is a dual-core 1 GHz). Always use a holster. The folks in the store not using PDA holsters because they look goofy are working way slower and less efficiently because of it. If you're using a 9200, hit control + red button to turn off cross scan. This will make it so the barcode doesn't have to be right in the middle of the cross hairs to scan. It saves a little time each pull, but mostly on the items where you can't clearly see the DC label."

Target,2ve1ao,Crimson_Steel,1 point,Wed Feb 11 01:50:49 2015 UTC,"Start at one end of the backroom and try to take as few steps as possible. The more you pull the CAF's, the more you know what fill groups usually drop at what hour.. Use this info to plan a route. I don't know if it's different in other stores, but the 11 and 7's only drop group A (Grocery, FDC, Chem, Pets, Paper, I/Furn and Diaper). Just follow the flow of the backroom.  Gotta run over there (points) to grab an empty repack? Grab 3 so you don't have to go out of your way again.  Move around in your equipment, not on your feet.. Lets say during the 11's, I pulled the pets from the light duty but there's some in the bulk steel. Instead of taking the time to walk down there, I'll exit the batch and grab it when I'm taking the pull to the line.  Often the leadership team will leave you high and dry if you have a call out. Make sure you're persistent about getting help so you can make your deadlines. It's literally the second week of the new-Target year so it's way too early to be rolling stuff.   Make sure you know who is capable of helping you pull.. Every ETL/SrTL should know how to pull batches. See if there are any SFTM's that know how to do it, if not, it may be time to push your ETL-Log to cross train some of them."

Target,2vcuk1,Taco_Baron,12,Mon Feb 9 23:34:09 2015 UTC,Really don't see anything wrong with this tbh. I don't think it's against any rules and why should it matter? If they aren't stealing or bothering guests/TMs then I don't see a problem. Granted you could make an argument about missing sales but I doubt it's a significant number.
Target,2vcuk1,the_legend_2828,8,Mon Feb 9 23:44:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would just let the guest go. I would look at it like ""at least she is buying coffee.""  She could just go to a Starbucks I guess.   Maybe you could ask management to requisition some magazines for that Starbucks. Then a team member doesn't have to put them back."
Target,2vcuk1,kapt_so_krunchy,7,Tue Feb 10 00:00:24 2015 UTC,"No AP issue, no loss to Target. As long as they put them back without damage I dont see the issue"
Target,2vcuk1,AforAnarchist,3,Tue Feb 10 01:01:57 2015 UTC,"What you basically gotta consider is this: That guest was never going to buy the magazine in the first place. You still have the magazine to sell to someone else, so your net loss there is 0. However, the opposite end is the coffee: You DID sell the coffee, so the store made a few bucks. If you chase the customer off, you not only lose THAT sale, but potentially a lot of future sales; anyone doing this is going to be doing it as a habit, that's not something a person does as a one time thing, typically speaking. So the question is, which is better for the store, selling a ton of coffee or selling nothing at all?"
Target,2vcuk1,FenrirSM,2,Tue Feb 10 18:37:55 2015 UTC,"No harm,  no foul.  At its base,  it's  a Vibe thing.  If the guest is happy,  we are happpy."
Target,2vcuk1,walkofdoom,1 point,Tue Feb 10 07:39:06 2015 UTC,"Not a biggy, I mean most of the regular tabloids and magazines now cost twice as much as the coffee they just bought. I don't blame them."

Target,2vcuk1,monkeyman80,-1,Thu Feb 12 02:48:01 2015 UTC,"Technically it is a form of stealing. The point of paying for the magazine is to be able to view the content inside. Its like if I were to open up a board game and play it in the store. Even if I don't damage the game in any way, it is still counted as theft. However if your TLs don't have problem with it there's nothing you can do about it."
Target,2vcuk1,l0singmymarbles,6,Tue Feb 10 04:29:03 2015 UTC,Target won't see it as theft though. They're not taking it past the point of sale and that's their big sticking point for theft.

Target,2vbbp4,dmillerw,9,Mon Feb 9 16:49:53 2015 UTC,Temperature sensitive items should be qmosed and not put on the floor again because who knows how long the guest had it sitting in their cart/basket.
Target,2vbbp4,adamb10,8,Mon Feb 9 16:56:42 2015 UTC,It gets tossed. The guest could have had it in there cart for over an hour for all we know. No sense in risking someones health over it.
Target,2vbbp4,AforAnarchist,7,Mon Feb 9 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"Everyone in my store follows best practice and QMOSes it out, but our market team runs a pretty tight ship. If a team member puts it back on the floor, that's definitely a coachable offense."

I took the box and QMOSed all of them, because I had no idea how long she walked around the store with them.  If I'm backing up at the register, and someone says ""I don't want this"" to a temp sensitive item, I'll say, 'Are you sure? We have to throw it out if you don't want it.' Sometimes they'll feel guilty and get it."

In states with similar systems in place, I imagine almost everyone pays their out of state sales tax. Collecting less from more people is just as good as collecting a lot from a few.  There is still an option to itemize it, but I certainly don't have time to sort all of my out-of-state and online purchases."
Target,2v97ka,pohatu771,1 point,Fri Feb 13 22:45:11 2015 UTC,You are charged tax if the company that is shipping the item also has locations in that state. That could mean they have a fulfillment center or a store in that state. There have been lawsuits between companies like Amazon and Target/Brick and Mortar stores because Amazon does not have to pay tax in many states while Target and others with a physical presence do.

The store is allowed to deny any availability changes, although after 4 years I'd think they'd be a bit more lenient with you. I would ask why you're availability change request is being denied. It could be that they don't want somebody working 20 or fewer hours who can't work weekends. It could be something else. HR is the best place to go in these types of situations. Your best option might be to go on an LOA, that way you can always come back to work at a later date and retain your team member status. The store might need somebody with your availability at a busier time of the year seeing as February & March tend to be slower."
Target,2v88o4,PasswordIsntClop,1 point,Sun Feb 8 21:54:54 2015 UTC,"Nothing you can really do, sadly. You're altering your availability after you were hired so it's up to Target if they want to accept it or not. Nothing says they have to.  That said, even if they did approve it the fun part is getting them to actually follow it. I'm a student who worked at Target part time and had two evening classes. Got the availability approved for no closing shifts those two nights and every week I would get scheduled at least one of those nights. The incompetence eventually just became funny."
Target,2v88o4,Elliot82,-2,Wed Feb 11 19:47:20 2015 UTC,It is very much legal for them to expect you to be at work during your shift. It is also just as legal for them to determine when those shifts should be.
Target,2v6w9w,Haunter20X,16,Sun Feb 8 13:57:02 2015 UTC,"Do a quick calculation of how much they're going to save by using it, especially big ticket items.   ""Hey this TV is 600 dollars, if you sign up for a red card you'll save $30 dollars, it takes like 3 minutes, we can do it they grab your TV out of the back.""  That can even set you up for an attachment.   ""Hey Mr. Customer, since you're already saving $30 did you want to put that towards product X""  Boom. Redcards AND attachments."
Target,2v6w9w,kapt_so_krunchy,9,Sun Feb 8 15:06:14 2015 UTC,This right here. 4 years as a top performing Electronics Team Member and now GSA... This has gotten me a great deal of REDCards. Especially now that I can offer the 5% off even if they don't get approved
Target,2v6w9w,Isak922,1 point,Sun Feb 8 16:43:24 2015 UTC,We can offer 5% even if not approved ? How does that work ?
Target,2v6w9w,Nevek117,2,Sun Feb 15 21:57:58 2015 UTC,"This is purely a by-store basis and a decision by your leadership.  As a GSA, I have zero problems putting in a generic Store Coupon worth the value that 5% of the transaction would be for a guest who applies, but gets denied. In fact, I encourage my cashiers to offer this. Anything under $5 (5% of a $100 transaction), any cashier can even do themselves. Anything over that requires a Supervisor Override. But it's a great way to drive REDcard apps, as well as provide amazing service."
Target,2v6w9w,Isak922,0,Mon Feb 16 00:05:52 2015 UTC,"My store would hit you with an internal for that, no lie :\"
Target,2v6w9w,RomulanBacon,3,Sat Feb 21 10:34:09 2015 UTC,"Electronics Team Member. 5 years. In my experience most guest aren't thinking long term. In fact, typically when they're spending hundreds of dollars in electronics it's at the end of their planing process. So I offer them 5% off the transaction if they sign up for a redcard regardless of approval. All the other tactics are great and certainly help but i find most guest hate to turn down savings. People are more inclined to sign up if they have a guaranteed reward. Feel free to check with your ETL but you better believe that most will agree losing $30 or $40 in sales is worth the redcard."

Target,2v6w9w,RomulanBacon,3,Sat Feb 21 10:32:30 2015 UTC,"I'm a black shirt and I get more than electronics most of the time. My main thing is stressing they will always get the 5%. ""you will save it every single time you shop. Groceries? 5% off. Clothes? 5% off. Anything in the store, every single time""  I usually push the debit option first, then offer them the credit card. Also, I usually talk about it if I can before I get to the register, if  helping them with something."
Target,2v6w9w,diilemmaz,2,Sun Feb 8 21:11:39 2015 UTC,I work in a high risk store... not a big deal for the electronics  team to get red cards... that aar tho... whole district has been red for quite some time...

Target,2v6w9w,God-Killer,1 point,Mon Feb 9 21:25:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it depends on the store/district, who your STL or GSTL is, and how much REDCards are important to them, but I highly doubt you could get fired for not getting REDCards. My store generally gets at least a few REDCards a day mostly from the frontlanes depending on how busy it is, so we Electronics TMs generally focus more on getting attachments than REDCards since the cashiers get most of the REDCards anyway (we still get some, but it's nothing compared to the front, and we haven't gotten talked to about the lack of them from us compared to the front)."

Usually the receipt part helps me out for when I have to cover the electronics department."
Target,2v6w9w,S0uless,2,Sun Feb 8 14:25:46 2015 UTC,That's any debit or credit though. Not a redcard benefit.

Target,2v6w9w,Croweslen,1 point,Sun Feb 8 21:34:59 2015 UTC,You can't use insidePOS slips for returns. They don't have VCD numbers on them and therefore aren't valid receipts.
Target,2v6w9w,anyquestions,1 point,Mon Feb 9 06:05:37 2015 UTC,Must be something on a store by store basis. In the case where theres something wrong with a register or anything where the original recipet isnt available we sometimes gibe the guest that printout as the reciept. Guest service always calls ap to verify but it has happened before.
Target,2v6w9w,Croweslen,2,Fri Feb 13 07:08:02 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that the extra 30 days to return does not apply to items with shortened return periods - everything in Electronics and Entertainment.  I removed the stickers advertising it immediately after the GSTL put them on our counter, and made sure to tell her why."
Target,2v6w9w,pohatu771,1 point,Sun Feb 8 18:53:23 2015 UTC,You get 45 days on those items with red card.
Target,2v6w9w,iJeffwuh,3,Sun Feb 8 20:40:00 2015 UTC,Not true.   REDcard extended returns do not apply to the following:  Target Mobile Purchases  Purchases with a fixed return date  Non-returnable items   Electronics and Entertainment have fixed return dates listed under the item on the receipt.
Target,2v57po,JonathanBowen,22,Sun Feb 8 00:35:11 2015 UTC,The team members probably think you are someone from corporate.
Target,2v57po,lockwasher,5,Sun Feb 8 02:03:44 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'd think if I saw that dude. Basically, all you have to do to look like corporate is go in with a nice button up red shirt, khakis and nice shoes. And ETL or STL might ask who you are, but no one else will. You could seriously walk in there and just grab the first person you see stocking shelves and have them do something completely different."
Target,2v57po,FirePowerCR,5,Sun Feb 8 17:08:38 2015 UTC,Huh... That makes sense. I complained to a manager about the major glitches the store was having in calculating the price per unit and he was really nice to me. Displaying price per unit is a Massachusetts and Rhode Island thing.
Target,2v57po,lockwasher,13,Sun Feb 8 04:15:45 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah.  Next time you're in just ask any team member for the LOD (Lead on Duty).  When they show up, ask them for the store's numbers and be prepared for a torrent of data on sales, profits, etc.  If they ask who you are just reply with, ""Can you tell me how long it takes to get back to the airport?"" and they will be absolutely convinced you came in on one of the corporate planes.  And then, as a further diversion say, ""We have been watching electronics through the cameras and we are liking what we see there."""

Target,2v4l90,wsimon1,3,Mon Feb 9 21:27:09 2015 UTC,"The way I heard it was:   Regular TMs get tested, seasonal hires don't. This is done to ""streamline the hiring process"" (read: save the company money). When I did it, I was given 24 hrs from the time of hire to go to a lab/doctor's office to take the test. Here's your cup, there's the bathroom, pee in your cup, thank you, goodbye. Depends. In my state you have the right to take a second test if you failed the first because of false positives."

They can also ask you to take one at any time during your employment. They usually have you go to a third party location (like a doctors office they have partnered with). I believe that target gives you 24 hours from the time that the offer is given to take the test. Believe that they do a lab test. Hopefully you haven't done trees while searching for a job, and you don't test positive. If you do, you're probably SOL.   Good Luck!"
Target,2v4l90,DoomedJanissary,1 point,Sat Feb 7 21:45:14 2015 UTC,Do they test seasonals who were kept on? I have no reason to not test but I haven't been talked to about it so I was curious.

The thing that irks me are the dumb questions, and guests being rude. I found that guests were more aggressive than usual, and it makes it quite hard to maintain the ""vibe"" when such aggression is apparent.  Friday was busy, but a little less so than yesterday. Mainly due to the large media attention on our liquidators' crappy prices."

The only real source of frustration is with the all sales final thing, because we've had a few people get really angry when they try to return something and they say the cashier didn't tell them that. If they make enough fuss we call LOD down and they just say there are signs all over the store and the checkout area is especially plastered with them, which usually doesn't calm the guests down very much. We're telling all the cashiers to make sure to tell everyone, but I think it's hard for them to keep at it all day when 90% of guests just say ""no shit, there's signs everywhere."" It's frustrating all around."

Target,2unzuq,targetAccount,4,Tue Feb 3 19:11:19 2015 UTC,"I don't work at a Canada store, but from what I've read here and online the stores were woefully understocked and trucks didn't come that often. Now that they're closing down, they're suddenly able to send out so many trucks that stores can't even finish unloading them all before the next one?  Sounds like quite the clusterfuck. I feel for anyone here who has to bust their ass harder than ever with the final payout being unemployment. Although, like the article says, if everyone is being fired anyway then there really isn't a reason to stick around for all this extra work. I can't imagine how bad it's going to be toward the end."
Target,2unzuq,BillyMarcus,4,Tue Feb 3 21:44:50 2015 UTC,There's been nasty morale for a long time. Employees getting only 4-8 hours a week aren't the most loyal folk.
Target,2unzuq,dasfeiz,3,Tue Feb 3 22:13:03 2015 UTC,Canada here - this is gonna get interesting. Starting Thursday guests are now customers it's really weird to say.
Target,2unzuq,ChocolatePopes,2,Wed Feb 4 06:15:44 2015 UTC,Can you explain why they are the c-word now?
Target,2unzuq,dasfeiz,5,Wed Feb 4 08:09:28 2015 UTC,"Liquidation. I dont work for Target anymore I work for whatever liquidators we have chosen. I've seen some signing come in that says ""customer service desk"" etc. Also just their behaviour, we have agreed it feels like Wal-Mart shoppers have invaded our store and we dont like it."
Target,2unzuq,ChocolatePopes,1 point,Wed Feb 4 08:18:55 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh. I never knew that's how liquidation worked! Sounds weird even saying 'customer'. btw, I hope everything goes well, fellow Targetbro. It totally sucks, man. Good luck with everything and hope Target was just a stepping stone for all of you guys!"
Target,2unzuq,dasfeiz,2,Wed Feb 4 08:22:36 2015 UTC,"This was my first job, got here a week into the store being open. Most of the team has been there either since then or before during store set up so this is a real emotional process for us. We realize the short-comings on the corporate side but as a store we feel as we did everything we could do. We have an amazing team and everyone will be broken up but it is just a short chapter in everyone's lives. I was able to become a Team Lead which was a wicked opportunity for me and I'll always be grateful to Target but at the same time I'll never understand how they managed to screw up as bad as they did. All in all, I have nothing but good things to say about my time here and I'm going to ride it out until they shut'er down for good."
Target,2unzuq,Zlyphor,2,Wed Feb 4 08:30:13 2015 UTC,I can definitely feel it at my store as well. Most of us just want it to get over with and just close down the store. I personally don't even feel like working but I've been picking up more hours to raise my average hours for the severance pay once we do close.
Target,2unzuq,Charak-V,3,Thu Feb 5 03:24:58 2015 UTC,"don't forget its not technically severance, its just guaranteed pay until May 16th."
Target,2unzuq,ponypartyposse,1 point,Thu Feb 5 07:30:44 2015 UTC,"Put in my resignation yesterday. Super sad to leave an amazing team, but seriously fuck Target.   Also it's a misconception that TMs now work for liquidators. They are still employed by Target Canada. Further, signs that say ""customer service desk"" are premade and not meant to change how we view guests. A lot of people are being melodramatic because we drank some serious Koolaid when we got employed."
Target,2unzuq,The_Evil_Within,4,Wed Feb 4 09:40:37 2015 UTC,"Further, signs that say ""customer service desk"" are premade and not meant to change how we view guests.   Stupid internal propaganda for employees.  People entering a Target store to buy merchandise are customers.  Guests stay at a hotel (in which case they're both guests and customers), or are attending a party."
Target,2unzuq,DrHuh,1 point,Fri Feb 6 03:48:01 2015 UTC,Theres some bitterness at head office in our store but morale is decent for now however if we are still open come April and we wont get any of that employee trust.... we still have fun and our guests seem very impressed with our service!
Target,2uore9,mglwmnc,9,Tue Feb 3 22:30:10 2015 UTC,"So the types of available positions will depend on your stores size (is it a city or Target Express, even a Super Target?), Volume of sales, Risk category, and available specialties.  General merchandise:  Store Team Lead (STL) - The store manager  Human Resources (HR) - Oversees all hiring/termination.  May also be combined with other positions if the store volume is low  Hardlines (HL) - Handles areas on the tiled areas (Electronics, Market, Seasonal, etc)  Softlines (SL) - Handles all carpeted areas (Clothing, accessories, etc)  Salesfloor (SF) - Handles Softlines and Hardlines depending on if your volume is super low or if you're a smaller store like maybe a City Target  Guest Experience (GE) - Oversees the front checklanes and Starbucks/Target Cafe.  In low volume stores this position is usually merged with another section or process.  Logistics (LOG) - Oversees the flow process and backroom, instocks (Process control will vary between stores).  Flow (FLOW) - Generally reserved for overnight stores where two ETLs are needed.  At this point one generally handles flow and instocks and the other flow and Backroom.  Your experience will vary between stores and regions.  Senior ETL - For super high volume stores.  This position is pretty much for someone who is an STL on the bench and will assist the STL in managing other ETLs and the like.  If you have one of these, you are not in a low volume store I guarantee.  For High Risk stores:  Asset Protection (AP) - Oversees an AP team  Operations (Ops) - Responsible for the process teams like Price Change, Instocks, Planogram, and maybe back room.  Generally seen in high volume or high shortage stores.    For Super Targets -   Food - Handles the grocery section.  Depending on the volume of sales, there may be more than one.  Oversees the FDC deliveries and bakery, Deli, meat, dairy, and dry groceries.    For Specialty sections -   Pharmacy (RX) - Oversees the pharmacy as the main pharmacist and generally does not float between stores."
Target,2uore9,Darikona,1 point,Wed Feb 4 04:49:52 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for this info. Exactly what I was looking for.
Target,2uore9,rh51too,3,Wed Feb 4 18:31:36 2015 UTC,"Depends on the volume of the store you are getting hired at. I work at an ULV (ultra low volume) and our ETLs usually oversee multiple departments. For example the salesfloor ETL also oversee GE or guest experience. Our HR ETL is also in charge of AP. And then logistics, so unloading freight, maintaining the backroom/plano/pricing."
Target,2uore9,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,2,Wed Feb 4 00:01:03 2015 UTC,"What an ETL covers really matters from store to store.. The basic areas are:    Guest Experience Assets Protection Logistics Production Perishables Human Resources Sales Floor (can be broken down to hardlines and softlines in huge stores)   Like /u/rh51too said, ETLs normally cover multiple areas and the more business a store does, the more ETLs there are to share the workload. I work at a high volume super so we have a dedicated ETL-AP, GE and HR. The food ETL covers all of grocery and production and the ETL-SF covers everything else. The ETL-Log covers trucks, backroom, pricing, pog, instocks and facilities.  I've heard of smaller stores sharing ETL-HRs and I've also heard of ETL-Log also covering guest experience.   I hope this helps"
Target,2uore9,blazenx,2,Wed Feb 4 01:52:42 2015 UTC,Never heard of Production etl.... do u mean etl-OPS?? as in operations... that covers pog team and pricing team
Target,2uore9,msowl61,3,Wed Feb 4 02:08:10 2015 UTC,"It's a food thing, deli, meat, bakery, just not dry grocery. So it would only be at busy Super's."

Target,2ukzd3,targetAccount,7,Tue Feb 3 00:58:38 2015 UTC,"We had 2300 today, they got done in about 5 hours with 4 guys."
Target,2ukzd3,cyan1113,3,Tue Feb 3 02:09:26 2015 UTC,"4 people to unload a 2300 piece truck? Wow, next time I think that my store doesn't care about the flow team, I'm going to remember this comment... Thanks for the response!"
Target,2ukzd3,cyan1113,2,Tue Feb 3 10:25:02 2015 UTC,"Hehe to be fair im in a viper pilot store. So flow also does sales floor, backroom, cashier and instocks all at once as those posititions are all gone now. Sound impossible?, it is, but don't tell my tl's that they just bought new cars everythings going fine for them"
Target,2ukzd3,TwoTonMantis,2,Tue Feb 3 11:40:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure what a viper pilot store is, is that a new system they're trying out or something? Having everyone do everything sounds terribly inefficient"
Target,2ukzd3,BarrelAgedBudLight,3,Tue Feb 3 21:36:44 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, it's the new thing they're trying which merges all those positions into one flowing thing. I'm not entirely sure, but it sounds stupid, so it'll probably get implemented."
Target,2ukzd3,Avoid_Calm,2,Sat Feb 7 08:44:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure, but it sounds stupid, so it'll probably get implemented   That gave me a good laugh, then I realized how right you were and I got a little sad."
Target,2ukzd3,BarrelAgedBudLight,6,Sun Feb 8 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"Ok first off, my Target doesn't do overnight. We unload at 7:30 AM.  Two throwing the truck. Seven on the line. One backstock guy and one or two pallet pullers.  We almost never make goal time. Sometimes we're close but more often than not we miss it."
Target,2ukzd3,Avoid_Calm,2,Tue Feb 3 07:29:16 2015 UTC,I can't even imagine a 7:30am unload. 4:00am is pushing it.
Target,2ukzd3,BarrelAgedBudLight,2,Tue Feb 3 08:00:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we got another store up not too far and they're overnight but they're also a higher volume store. I think they start at 3 AM and try and finish by 8 AM. We're lucky if we finish in 5 hours."
Target,2ukzd3,Avoid_Calm,2,Tue Feb 3 08:19:30 2015 UTC,"We're a pretty high volume store, but have a backroom for a store that does half our volume. I'd kill for overnight so we can clear some backstock."
Target,2ukzd3,BarrelAgedBudLight,2,Tue Feb 3 08:20:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear you. Man, when we get like 2200 piece trucks I feel bad for backroom. Backstock tubs for days.."
Target,2ukzd3,Avoid_Calm,2,Tue Feb 3 08:23:21 2015 UTC,Yup ;_; we just changed to 5 truck weeks too so the backroom is just in a horrid state. Not to mention the coolers.
Target,2ukzd3,BarrelAgedBudLight,3,Tue Feb 3 08:30:16 2015 UTC,"Not only the Flow backstock but the Auto Fills AND the CAF Push backstock. Man.... Backroom deserves all the vibes cards in the world.  Edit: Plus on top of that, Close Backroom does CAF Pulls, backstocking and the cooler pulls that Market (c'mon Market) couldn't do."
Target,2ukzd3,BarrelAgedBudLight,1 point,Tue Feb 3 08:35:28 2015 UTC,"And POG backstock haha. We're also responsible for the baler in the morning. I don't usually work mornings, I generally close, but mornings are a bitch.  We've been getting the CAFs done a bit early though lately so we get some intermittent backstock done during the day, but no where near enough.  We also just had a really experienced backroom TM transfer and the most experienced one doesn't want to work backroom anymore. I'm only a few months in and I'm quickly being thrust into the role of the most experienced dude."
Target,2ukzd3,subrock,1 point,Tue Feb 3 08:52:42 2015 UTC,"7:30 unload is nuts. Like /u/Avoid_Calm said, my store has trouble finishing the trucks on time when we start at 4am. Does your store still open at 8? How long does it take to be done stocking items from the truck? For us, the speed we can work at goes down once the store is open, since you have to interact with guests and can't just bring pallets right to the floor, can't imagine having to start the stocking process when the store is already open."
Target,2ukzd3,Hoowus,2,Tue Feb 3 10:32:55 2015 UTC,"We still open at 8.  If the truck is around 1500-1800 pieces there's a good chance we can get done by 12:30 PM. 2200 piece trucks can run from 2-3 PM.  And yes, our pallets are brought right onto the floor."
Target,2ukzd3,CarlosTheChick,1 point,Tue Feb 3 22:40:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, it's really interesting to hear the little differences in each store. At my store, the TLs get super anal about making sure we don't have pallets on the floor or boxes bowled once the store is opened. I had always assumed stuff like that was company wide, so it's cool to hear how different your unload process is."
Target,2ukzd3,SanltarYNAPkin,2,Tue Feb 3 22:47:19 2015 UTC,"Yup, Targets can get very weird sometimes haha"
Target,2ukzd3,MrHeartless,3,Tue Feb 3 22:51:05 2015 UTC,"We get a truck of that size done in about an hour and fifteen to an hour and a half.  That's with 6 or 7 on the line, 2 in the trailer, and 1 or 2 running pallets to the floor."

Target,2ukzd3,MrHeartless,3,Tue Feb 3 02:41:02 2015 UTC,"2200-2400, 50 mins  1800-2100, 40/45 mins.  That's with 9 people on the line, 3/4 in the truck, and 3/4 taking the pallets out"
Target,2ukzd3,CarlosTheChick,1 point,Tue Feb 3 02:42:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, very nice. I think my TL would probably die of excitement if we got a 2400 done in 50 minutes haha, those ones typically put us around 1:05 to 1:10."
Target,2ukzd3,Robingshade,2,Tue Feb 3 10:38:03 2015 UTC,"6 on the line, one scanner, 2 in the truck and 2 pulling pallets. We've been doing our 2500 piece trucks in a little over an hour"
Target,2ukzd3,charles_barkley_bot,2,Tue Feb 3 03:11:48 2015 UTC,"Our trucks are usually 2200 and over. Always takes about 2 hours with 2 in the truck, 1 pusher, 1 scanner, 9 on the line and 2 people taking the pallet out.  Not sure how it takes so long when we keep steady but I guess you're all just faster."
Target,2ukzd3,brokenwinds,1 point,Tue Feb 3 04:49:40 2015 UTC,What do you guys mean by scanner ? We don't have a scanner.
Target,2ukzd3,FenrirSM,3,Tue Feb 3 05:20:29 2015 UTC,Someone uses the pda to scan each label and it tells you if its already backstock or not. Saves alot of push time
Target,2ukzd3,FenrirSM,2,Tue Feb 3 05:30:46 2015 UTC,"Ah. That's not at all what my store does. They just bring the flats out to the floor, stock, put the backstock back on the flat, and bring it back to the backroom."
Target,2ukzd3,MrHeartless,1 point,Tue Feb 3 05:42:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm not sure. We swap the people inside our truck halfway through so they don't get too tired, maybe that could help?  Honestly though, if your TL is fine with the unload speed then I wouldn't be concerned about it. Thanks for the response!"
Target,2ukzd3,FenrirSM,2,Tue Feb 3 10:40:31 2015 UTC,"We come in at six and by everyone clocks in we typically start unload by 6:10am and are finished between 7:20-7:40 for anything over 2,000 peices. However, we are a big selling store and we only have about 5-8 flow members a day. Lately we're lucky if we get done with toys by 11. Its a shame too, since we haven't been meeting sales goals due to terrible weather, theyre not hiring any more flow TMs. I'm not complaining though; just means i get to pick up more hours which means more $$"

Target,2ughm4,emilyrose93,2,Sun Feb 1 23:52:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know personally (I work for Target Australia, not Target USA so it's different) but the impression I've gotten is that basically Nintendo is only letting each retailer have a tiny amount of each figure, so maybe Nintendo is the one not producing another batch of it?   It might also be worth mentioning that Target might have the exclusive in the USA, but not in Australia so Nintendo might have already earmarked any remaining stock for other retailers overseas too."
Target,2ughm4,lilypetal,2,Sun Feb 1 23:41:02 2015 UTC,Target Australia is actually not affiliated in any way with Target in the US! I just recently learned that.

(have a geniune conversation with the kid if its their birthday before moving on to helping them) what's something you acted in a part of a team to accomplish a goal. someone asks if there's something out of stock. there's a price discrepancy.   unfortunately stl has most of the power, it doesn't matter etl recommendations. etl had my back twice but stl didn't know me."

Target,2tw7bm,Naldon,9,Tue Jan 27 22:43:37 2015 UTC,"This should go without saying but, my experience is probably different than other people. So mileage may vary.  I've been working in Pfresh for the last 4 and 1/2 months and love some things about it and hate the other.  For me personally, I love working with my team members. We get along really well and hang out after work often. We sometimes get yelled at by TL's and ETL's because we laugh too much. I'm also like 1 out of the 10 people in the world who enjoys working in the cold environments. A lot of people complain about working in the freezer aisle, but I actually enjoy it.  Now here are the reasons why I absolutely hate working in Pfresh. Our TL's and ETL's don't understand that the amount of work we have to do in a projected amount of time is pretty much unrealistic. For starters our Pfresh team consists of only 3 sometimes give or take 1, including our PA. We regularly get size 700-1000 trucks, and for 3 people to work all that out in 5 hours is really hard, especially when some of us get pulled off to help with flow, backroom, or cardboard. This one ETL for instance has been really drilling us on how he thinks the job should be done, such as unloading the Pfresh truck WHILE flow is still unloading their truck and assigning each team member to work on those 8ft+ tall pallets individually then yelling at us for not getting it done in within 30 min. One time he pulled the entire Pfresh team to help out with flow for about an hour and a half and later yelled at us because we were behind on the truck. There are many more problems but since this is now starting to look like a rant, many of my problems could be solved by having the ETL understand cutting a size 8 team down to 3 and expecting similar results is impossible. We have repeatedly tried to request more team members but were simply told we just had to work harder.   One other huge problem is that this same ETL hired a new PA with zero experience in target instead of promoting my other pfresh team members who have been working in that department for 2+ years. This new PA that was hired is probably one of the worst team members I ever had the displeasure to work with. For starters she would clock in at 5 and would refuse to do any work until 6. Her reasoning is that her duties don't require her to do anything until 6 so she just wanders around. She also doesn't do paperwork for the truck. She also refuses to help out with the truck because her job description doesn't require her to do any manual labor, which is bull. She even openly states that she'll leave her work unfinished for someone else to do it and she justifies her lack of work ethic with the fact she is hungover from drinking the night before. We have tried multiple times to have out TL's address this issue, but because she was hired by the ETL it's really hard to get rid of her. This is probably the main reason the rest of my team wants to kill themselves because we are now in a constant position that if we do not finish the truck, we're hopeless and incompetent. But on the rare occasion we do finish early, it all accredited to our PA. Now that I ended my other rant, what you can take from this is, is that from my experience, as long as you help out the team you should be okay. I'm not entirely sure since I do not know the environment of your store/team."
Target,2tw7bm,Tomemote,2,Tue Jan 27 23:59:58 2015 UTC,"First of all, thanks for the response. I guess ill try my hardest to not be like that. lol  at my store flow team is the group looked down on as they are slow and always soak hours because they can just get all the OT because trust needs to be done, so they HAVE to give them OT"
Target,2tw7bm,monkeyman80,2,Wed Jan 28 01:49:05 2015 UTC,have you called the integrity hotline over this? having friends isn't going to help when corp investigates an hour on the clock doing nothing consistently.
Target,2tw7bm,crazyllama256,8,Wed Jan 28 03:19:08 2015 UTC,"For me, it was getting to know the back room team members that pulled in the coolers. They call me and see if i need certain items so the pulls aren't unbearably huge"
Target,2tw7bm,kpy33,4,Tue Jan 27 23:31:12 2015 UTC,No surprise that all your market team members want out. I've been over in Market the past few months and recently told them I want the fuck out and back onto just normal hardlines. Why should I bust my balls over in Market when I get paid the same amount to zombie out and push CAF's all day on just normal hardlines sales floor? Where's the incentive to stay over there? God damn I could rant about Market all day.
Target,2tw7bm,aimiami,3,Wed Jan 28 01:09:24 2015 UTC,"Ya honestly before Christmas i had told them i didn't want to do market at all for the same reasons. then my view changed and now i want to do it every day, lol  same pay more work, responsibility, stress. The thing that i hated most is hardlines always gets help, at least at my store. Cashiers go out and do reshop when not busy, LODs do the 6 o'clock hardlines pulls and market gets nothing"
Target,2tw7bm,StinginPlatypus,2,Wed Jan 28 01:49:11 2015 UTC,"your helping the team! come on it's totally worth the same pay and twice the work to do pulls and zone.   I hate it... At my store at about 6 they say ""wow glad everyone got through the pulls quick today"" meanwhile i dont get done until 7 at the earliest because (at least where i work) no one even does them. Never thought id be happy to see school start again so my hours can get cut."
Target,2tw7bm,indigoibex,0,Fri Jan 30 08:50:22 2015 UTC,Market actually gets a raise over Hardlines at my store. Or maybe I'm just being underpaid. :O
Target,2tw7bm,somethingbeautiful89,2,Mon Feb 2 06:08:03 2015 UTC,"I have been in market for about the same amount of time, and I'm being interviewed for PA. We still have a CTL (I hear a lot of stores don't), and one thing that has helped us is to get organized. We were able to get a small metro rack (comes up about 3ft or something), and we have basket for various things (one with flippy labels, gray dots, etc, one for paper trash, one for small abandons, etc), and keeping binders for vendor POGS, copies of our routines, etc. We also have a communication log that we use to say what we got done, what the next person should keep an eye on, etc. Increasing our communication when we have little to no overlap is great.  Another thing is to have a market meeting to brainstorm ideas, recognize people's strengths, etc. Our market team acts like a close knit team should, we communicate amongst each other to solve problems without going outside of market if we can, point out things someone is doing an awesome job on, and catch each others mistakes discretely. If everyone feels like a real team I think you can get a lot more effort as everyone wants to help the rest."
Target,2tw7bm,ballthestorm,3,Wed Jan 28 20:43:49 2015 UTC,"I agree about your points/benefits that communication will do for the team!  We use a marker board in the ambient room for all communication and a maker board calendar to plan ahead for the month for salesplanners, freshness checks, extra tasks like deep cleaning, or things that may be out of ordinary  (PA and TL has set days so if they switch or have day off they write on calendar)."
Target,2tw7bm,ImmmOldGregg,2,Wed Feb 4 00:46:12 2015 UTC,"I've been a PA for about a year now. First thing you will learn is that nobody gives a shit about pfresh unless there's a visit from corporate or if steritechs coming. I love it because nobody wants to do it, so you're basically untouchable. Nobody messes with you because they're scared you'll leave. I get asked monthly if i still like it over there. None of the ETL's no what you do half the time, so if its slow i give my guys longer breaks and try and pick up the slack myself. Just keep it fresh and full on the sales floor, and zone a few times a day and everyone will praise you. Get to know the backroom guys and help with the load when you can. I TPC stuff like crazy and my ETL loves how i drive sales. It's more work then hardlines, but you get hours and have a little seniority. Just be friendly and let your team know you don't mind doing the grunt work."

Target,2tqqdi,iamDJDan,3,Mon Jan 26 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"I would wager to say your pog team is really behind and they need some extra help to catch up. You will likely be pushing product after one of the pog TMs sets a planogram. You might also be shown how to set the pogs yourself (if this isn't the case, definitely try to learn how to do it.. Knowing how to set pogs opens a lot of doors for advancement)."

Target,2tqqdi,DoomedJanissary,2,Mon Jan 26 18:29:28 2015 UTC,I used to work hardlines at my old store and worked presentation when I transferred stores so I can help you with this question.   Presentation pulls other team members from other departments when they have extra hours or if they need help pushing product to a new set.   All you're going to be doing is pushing while the presentation team sets like crazy. If the Plano team at your store usually does go-backs then they are gonna use you to do that while you set.
Target,2tqqdi,481072211,1 point,Tue Jan 27 01:40:10 2015 UTC,"Presentation could be anything, really. When cafe, cashier, and cart attendants were scheduled presentation during the holidays, it meant just helping out in toys/seasonal with reshop and guest service. When you help rearrange a section like market, that could also be presentation. It could even be something like setting pogs.  Just ask HR."

Target,2t8cdm,fetalbeetles,3,Thu Jan 22 03:02:44 2015 UTC,"Front page, top hotlinks running across the top of the page such as sales floor, logistics, ap, hr, etc, hover over the one on the far right. There will be a button for AE. You can also just search for it in the search bar"
Target,2t8cdm,bbradley86,1 point,Thu Jan 22 03:22:50 2015 UTC,Yup scroll over store reports and ae is one of the main options
Target,2t8cdm,fetalbeetles,3,Thu Jan 22 11:41:56 2015 UTC,"The store's AE score is a measure of its financial success. it takes in to account sales, payroll, shortage, Safety, 'guest experience index', and expenses. Generally, this score is set in stone and cannot fluctuate more than 10 points for ""personal contributions"" to the financial success of the store.  AE is only for TLs and above . For TMs, annual reviews are based on performance, reliability, vibe, etc and are not related to AE, but AE score is involved in the calculation for their hourly raise"
Target,2t8cdm,fetalbeetles,2,Thu Jan 22 02:42:24 2015 UTC,"I'm an ETL-Rx, so my score is based on some different metrics than the rest of the score"
Target,2t8gpb,S0uless,1 point,Thu Jan 22 00:44:01 2015 UTC,"Things I'm absolutely well aware of! I appreciate it as well. I just know those are some things they will look at in regards to reliability and the such. I have some slight management experience (From prior jobs and from acting ""TL"" for the night.)  Don't get me wrong, A big thank you to you for pointing this out, as it will make me continue on towards that path to kicking butt and taking names. Currently we don't have a STL (He was transferred to another store not to long ago, during the holiday season.) So I know if I continue to stay on the good side of my ETL (He's written personal recommendations for me before, he likes my hard work) I should be okay in at least that part."
Target,2t8gpb,monkeyman80,1 point,Thu Jan 22 01:46:52 2015 UTC,this exactly. each proving takes a long time. there are a lot of random things they throw out as carrots but it means crap. the unofficial leaders like gsa/pfresh assistant/ electronics expert etc are the best to move up.
Target,2t8gpb,fetalbeetles,1 point,Thu Jan 22 02:19:00 2015 UTC,"You should ask your ETL about being a TL. You will get a good idea of how they feel about you being a TL based on their reaction. Just because they think you're an awesome TL doesn't mean they see you as TL potential. Plus, by asking now, if they support you being a TL, they will actively start developmental activities and interview prep to make sure you pass"
Target,2t8gpb,anyquestions,1 point,Thu Jan 22 08:11:22 2015 UTC,"Here's what you need to know (and master) to be a Hardlines team lead: TWT, the Sales Floor Accuracy report, Merchandise Update, accountability (coachings) and instocks. How familiar are you with any of these?  Past that it's all about having the support of your Hardlines-ETL and STL."
Target,2t8gpb,raldios,1 point,Thu Jan 22 02:46:30 2015 UTC,So I applied for Market TL after ours left to be an ETL at another store. I didn't get the job but it showed my ETLs that I was interested and really started the ball rolling with development. I'm in a much better position now and will likely (fingers crossed) takeover pog and price change after my TL graduates.  Another commenter said they will likely challenge you to take on some kind of focus. This absolutely happened with me and I now plan all of the sales planners and set a majority of them each week.
Target,2t8gpb,dasfeiz,1 point,Thu Jan 22 04:11:07 2015 UTC,"I was a Hardlines TM who went up to TL. Top comment says they wont look at you without previous retail management experience, false. Target was my first job ever and within 16 months I was promoted 2 times. It's all about the store, and not so much about you. See what the store needs and be the guy to point it out and have a plan for it. Its all about thought process. Partner with your ETLs and show them your thought processes when it comes to ad, pogs, action plans etc. Just be confident in your role and abilities and as long as it is known youre interested chances are youll get a shot"
Target,2t6z4z,CandyLips89,3,Wed Jan 21 18:08:30 2015 UTC,I have heard that the blue polo and khakis are coming soon. Have not actually seen them yet though.
Target,2t6z4z,AforAnarchist,3,Wed Jan 21 19:24:47 2015 UTC,As a tps I really enjoy wearing the black uniform. But as I drove to different districts to shop I noticed they have different uniforms. In a different district I saw a tps wearing a Navy blue Polo shirt with an embroidered badge and black pants. While I was in Florida I saw a tps wearing the same shirt but with khaki pants. It seems like the navy shirt is going to take over but it will be either dark pants or khakis.
Target,2t6z4z,Below_Average_Artist,3,Thu Jan 22 07:42:25 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it depends on state laws, to prevent people from thinking they're police officers.  Depends on the state/county."
Target,2t6z4z,Gregorofthehillpeopl,1 point,Thu Jan 22 09:35:23 2015 UTC,In our district a local PD complained that the TPS's looked to similar to cops. Targets reaction? cut the ETL and TPS's and make it an APL store.
Target,2t6z4z,LemonApples,2,Sun Jan 25 03:26:38 2015 UTC,"I have a love/hate relationship with the black uniform. It looks pretty slick.... but its not the most comfortable thing when you're in it 8 hours a day. But my ETL literally ordered me some more shirts and pants this week, so I don't think we're getting new versions..."
Target,2t6z4z,DannyDawg,2,Sun Jan 25 03:34:34 2015 UTC,"I hate the shoes. They tore up my ankles. Bastards. But yeah, the uniform doors not breathe at all so summer sucks."
Target,2t6z4z,55eb3,1 point,Sun Jan 25 15:13:41 2015 UTC,I agree. I'd also add that the glossy shoes can be pretty uncomfortable too. A smartly dressed TPS at the storefront is one of the most iconic parts of the Target shopping experience.
Target,2t6z4z,hawaiizach,1 point,Sun Jan 25 04:12:29 2015 UTC,"Last I heard this was only being broken to ETL-APs this month, so he probably doesn't know yet and is gonna be bummed when he finds out he just spent that budget $ on current uniforms. Thats what I was told by the APBP and APML, anyway."
Target,2t6z4z,DannyDawg,1 point,Fri Jan 30 21:15:35 2015 UTC,Yeah for about 1 month now
Target,2t6z4z,DannyDawg,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:30:50 2015 UTC,"Ive warmed up to it. My store is super low risk though... So the old uniform seemed a little bit too much.  I definitely have noticed more guests treating me like a regular target team member though, which has its good and bad.  Are you a TPS or tl?"
Target,2t6z4z,DannyDawg,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:38:52 2015 UTC,Have you guys switched uniform?
Target,2t6z4z,DannyDawg,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:05:35 2015 UTC,just curious how many ap team members do you guys have?
Target,2t6z4z,LemonApples,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:28:05 2015 UTC,I use the blue polo that the TSS's use at the distribution center as a TPS. DTL said that the new TPS ones will be similar but will say Target Protection Specialist instead of Security Specialist obviously. Still says security on the back.
Target,2t6z4z,OwwHaveMercy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:34:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm ok with Polo and khaki. I hate the fake cop uniform, someone even sees my fucking elbow and i can forget about getting an app"
Target,2t6z4z,hawaiizach,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:44:16 2015 UTC,"My APBP and APML informed us that the blue and khaki is coming early this year, and the ""cop"" style uniforms will be no more. While I prefer the look of the blue/khaki much more, I also like the presence that current TPS uniforms provide in terms of shoplifting deterrents."
Target,2t55fj,retromike,7,Wed Jan 21 05:41:06 2015 UTC,"I was flow team and had a performance evaluation just after the holidays that I needed to pick my speed up. Fair enough, but they were only scheduling me 4 hours for one day of the week. Not really a whole lot of time to keep improving. In fact after just two weeks or so of that I got my 90 day review and they said I still hadn't improved and they were terminating me. And you want to know another kicker they added on with it? Attendance issues. Gasp, I called in sick for 2 days because I had bronchitis and with my asthma I was barely able to walk a couple feet without being completely out of breath. Even the doctor told me not to go to work and wrote up a note. But Target policy is we don't take doctor's note, all attendance absences are the same across the board. Called in because you just didn't feel like working? Called in because you were deathly ill? No difference! All the same! This is why I hate calling in sick for work.They don't care if you are ready to pass out, you better get your ass in."
Target,2t55fj,bluehawk232,7,Thu Jan 22 03:15:38 2015 UTC,It's pretty much the same as getting fired except instead of getting fired you get your 90 day review.
Target,2t55fj,karmasink,6,Wed Jan 21 10:39:36 2015 UTC,I got a high five from my foodetl
Target,2t55fj,Besnasty,4,Thu Jan 22 00:26:01 2015 UTC,Was told over the walkie to meet my TL in the TSC.  She read the letter that I was being kept on.  Took 5 minutes.
Target,2t55fj,adamb10,4,Wed Jan 21 15:45:09 2015 UTC,"My first year, a srTL handed out letters to all the seasonal cashiers while they were on a register."
Target,2t55fj,itsamutiny,3,Wed Jan 21 20:50:19 2015 UTC,I was asked what my workcenter preference would be then told two weeks later I had additional training on workbench to do.
Target,2t55fj,the_legend_2828,3,Thu Jan 22 03:54:22 2015 UTC,"As a seasonal cashier, I was pulled aside near the end of my shift and told that they wanted to keep me on as a team member. I declined, and just finished my last shift a couple days ago. I'll miss some co-workers and leaders, but cashiering just plain sucks."
Target,2t55fj,hivanmivan,2,Thu Jan 22 19:09:45 2015 UTC,"i was seasonal. they never let me know i was going to be kept on, or any official thing. my tl/etl's identified me early on, even stl saw me as flexible.   really, were you coached? that's an easy way you're not being kept, but even those we want to churn we can't"
Target,2t55fj,monkeyman80,2,Thu Jan 22 08:06:06 2015 UTC,"I noticed i was in the following week's schedule. The day that was the ""last day"" for seasonal member they extended my hours to get cashier trained and they told me that i was kept & that they only kept 6 people"
Target,2t55fj,Rvargas562,2,Fri Jan 23 00:57:31 2015 UTC,"Never was notified in a direct manner. My first day was 2 days before Christmas, and I'm still the second most scheduled Electronics team member. From previous retail experience, it all just kind of tells you. You get hours. All the other seasonals are gone or getting 10 hours a week. I know I'm fine."

Target,2t7g9i,zomboni_steve,10,Wed Jan 21 20:12:34 2015 UTC,So... You basically want someone to design something for free and let you take all the credit? Good luck with that. Kinda rude to even ask in my opinion.
Target,2t7g9i,semen_drinker,-1,Wed Jan 21 22:41:27 2015 UTC,Didn't think of it like that semen_drinker. I just thought it would be cool to get the subreddit in on a competition. Not like I'm going to be making any money. I'd even send the winner the shirt I get for all I care. It is what it is suppose.
Target,2t0g5v,SanltarYNAPkin,3,Tue Jan 20 03:26:34 2015 UTC,Damn. I price matched a wii remote and nunchuck from Sears.com and used my discount. That was an amazing deal. I'd be all over that advanced warfare if it stacked. Essentially every retailer has some version of a discounted advanced warfare.
Target,2t0g5v,FirePowerCR,2,Tue Jan 20 03:52:14 2015 UTC,it depends on if service desk knows what best practice is. you scan a discount it works.

Target,2t0g5v,FirePowerCR,4,Tue Jan 20 20:28:43 2015 UTC,"Best practice for price matching says no additional discounts. You either get Target's price minus coupons (and TM discounts), or a matched price."

Target,2t0g5v,exus,1 point,Wed Jan 21 01:27:14 2015 UTC,Damn. Would I still be able to get my 10% employee discount?
Target,2t0g5v,itsamutiny,7,Tue Jan 20 03:36:52 2015 UTC,You can use your discount on top of Cartwheel savings but aren't supposed to be able to use it in conjunction with price matching.
Target,2t0g5v,monkeyman80,2,Tue Jan 20 03:43:30 2015 UTC,if its from a non target place you don't get your 10%.
Target,2t0g5v,exus,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:51:10 2015 UTC,"Afaik yes as a guest would still be able to get that price so we should be able discount on top at least. But not 100% sure, it'd be crappy if not. Though I'm not sure the register actually stops the cartwheel now that I think about it. You could just not mention it and then at payment mention you have a cartwheel and probably get away with it."
Target,2t0g5v,desertcoyote77,1 point,Wed Jan 21 01:27:54 2015 UTC,"All discounts are taken first... coupons and cartwheel.  If the price is still higher than generic competitor website price, then the price match happens.  You can't get the Amazon price then the cartwheel..."
Target,2t0g5v,monkeyman80,0,Tue Jan 20 03:47:57 2015 UTC,"one thing that hasn't been mentioned. things like our preorder deal. people want to pricematch amazon for a game, get the 25 dollar or whatever discount for buying a game and then return the 5 dollar pre order.   i get what you're doing. i dont' care that a friend did. you get the price match or promotion, not both."

Target,2sil7y,dasfeiz,3,Thu Jan 15 15:41:54 2015 UTC,Stores will be closing in February and all employees are entitled to 16 weeks of severance pay from the date they close or are let go. Employees will start to be let go very soon but some will need to remain in the store to keep it going during their liquidation process.
Target,2sil7y,dasfeiz,2,Thu Jan 15 16:10:04 2015 UTC,Whats the source on that
Target,2sil7y,dasfeiz,4,Thu Jan 15 16:35:02 2015 UTC,I'm an AP-ETL and that's what I was just told.
Target,2sil7y,fuzzzzie,3,Thu Jan 15 16:58:48 2015 UTC,"Im a Consumables TL at my store, going to work in a few hours, what is the word going around the stores?"
Target,2sil7y,teazelbranchlet,3,Thu Jan 15 17:01:02 2015 UTC,"We're being told liquidation will begin in early February (I'm at a Hamilton, Ontario store) and employees will start to be let go as early as after this weekend."
Target,2sil7y,MindAsWell,2,Thu Jan 15 17:05:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!
Target,2sil7y,teazelbranchlet,2,Thu Jan 15 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"If the courts approve it and if there is enough money to pay creditors. Just got the news about my job today too. Fortunately, I lined something else up today as well. My point though is that all the debts will have to be paid first and the money will likely go to pay STL's and ETL's out first. There probably wont be a lot of money left at the end of that for regular employees."
Target,2sil7y,spindok712,2,Thu Jan 15 23:53:29 2015 UTC,I worked for Zellers right until they closed. I was 6 weeks away from 5 years. I didn't get severance because they were only paying out at 5 years.  When I saw that Target was paying out 16 weeks it made me happy. Target is doing it right.  HBCs awful treatment of staff left an awful taste in my mouth and I won't shop at any HBC store. I will continue to shop at Target US though.
Target,2sil7y,Solace_ffl,0,Fri Jan 16 16:29:13 2015 UTC,We either get to work for 16 weeks or if they don't need us they still are going to be paying us. Very generous of them.
Target,2sil7y,MoosherFlubbin,-1,Fri Jan 16 16:34:43 2015 UTC,When are they starting to liquidate?
Target,2sil7y,Zlyphor,3,Fri Jan 16 18:11:21 2015 UTC,Guess I gotta find a new job ...
Target,2sil7y,justini87,2,Thu Jan 15 18:44:02 2015 UTC,"Welp that sucks, I wish everyone the best in finding new work. I'm glad I have already been searching for a new place of employment proactively."
Target,2sil7y,BillyMarcus,2,Fri Jan 16 01:34:30 2015 UTC,I was told that our Ontario DTL left Canada two weeks before we got the news. He's got a nice cozy DTL position at Target in Florida now. Did he know this was going to happen and didn't want to say anything?  Also I was on Target's facebook and they replied to a question a few hours ago saying the liquidation sales will start in 2-3 weeks.
Target,2sil7y,Foreverlonelyyyyy,3,Sun Jan 18 00:57:21 2015 UTC,"From what I read, all DTL positions and above were filled by those from Target US. Not sure if it's true and if it is if they have positions to go back to in the US. Wouldn't be surprised if they knew about this way before any Target employees found out."
Target,2sil7y,_dt0x,3,Mon Jan 19 02:33:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry from a US Consumables TM to all the Canadians getting this rough news- it's one thing if they don't have any projection of turning it around, but god forbid rich people have to wait 6 years to see a profit from a new international market"
Target,2sil7y,Zlyphor,3,Thu Jan 15 18:32:43 2015 UTC,Yeah this seems pretty short sighted to me.
Target,2sirky,brother_p,1 point,Thu Jan 15 15:21:49 2015 UTC,Anybody knows how we are supposed to talk about this?
Target,2sirky,onizaru,3,Thu Jan 15 18:12:26 2015 UTC,I would refer all questions to your STL or ETLs if possible. There's specific answers we can give to media and guests.
Target,2sfc3m,Ninja00715,3,Wed Jan 14 18:34:05 2015 UTC,Was the schedule up for that week before you put it in?
Target,2sfc3m,Hero4sale85,1 point,Wed Jan 14 20:55:20 2015 UTC,I believe it was the same day I put my 2 weeks in
Target,2sfc3m,Hero4sale85,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:25:20 2015 UTC,"If the schedule was posted and they changed it without your permission, you have a case. My state doesn't allow schedule changes unless you are asked about it. So, if they changed your schedule after it was posted because of your two weeks that did change the day you plan on leaving, I'd bring it up. Or, if you still have the schedule, take a picture of it and show up and work those shifts anyways. If it doesn't let you clock in, call the LOD and show them the picture. They will likely clock you in."
Target,2sfc3m,The_WubWub,3,Thu Jan 15 17:10:36 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly they have to give you 24 hours notice before a shift making any changes to your schedule and let you know about it for it to be done correctly. If not someone please correct me.
Target,2sfc3m,fetalbeetles,3,Wed Jan 14 21:58:10 2015 UTC,"Putting in your 2 weeks is like telling the company ""I quit, but I can hang around for 2 weeks so I don't leave you shorthanded."" Once you offer your 2 week noticed, any company you work for can accept your resignation with immediate effect"
Target,2sfc3m,k929,1 point,Thu Jan 15 14:10:13 2015 UTC,It just sucks when someone puts in a two weeks and half asses their work :/  I know of 2 coworkers who did that. They literally would show up late and call out for most of their shifts. Then when they were working they would spend most of the time on their phone and do whatever they wanted.
Target,2sfc3m,FirePowerCR,2,Fri Jan 16 17:50:50 2015 UTC,Interesting. They do send people home early and sometimes tell people to not come in. I don't know if it's legally wrong to cut your last shifts.
Target,2sfc3m,FirePowerCR,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:33:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not so sure either, I just know it was my GSTL who hates me."
Target,2sfc3m,LeChiotx,2,Wed Jan 14 22:36:00 2015 UTC,It definitely wasn't cool though. So maybe morally wrong as you didn't just quit you gave proper notice.
Target,2sfc3m,FenrirSM,2,Wed Jan 14 22:38:29 2015 UTC,As a GSTL I can honestly say we have no control over hours or cutting. We can ask for people to come in but can not cancel shits. Now I don't hate any of my TMs but I can say I know other TLs that do so that part I can believe... Which is actually sad on their half.  Odds are if anyone cut your hours it has to be at least at the ETL lvl but to my knowledge since it has to do with your 2 week it is more likely HR and/or STL
Target,2sf47m,funplex,4,Wed Jan 14 17:33:49 2015 UTC,"Yes your STL can tell you to go home just like any job. Basically there isn't enough work for everyone so they send people home, its completely legal because they can argue they won't pau you to do nothing nor have you doing something outside your job. If they don't let you know however and say just take you completely off the schedule without letting you know I don't think that's illegal or anything but definitely not brand ."
Target,2sf47m,LeChiotx,0,Wed Jan 14 18:09:52 2015 UTC,"Our old STL would always ask us if we wanted to leave early, and if we said we didn't want to, he wouldn't push it. Our new STL, however...the ETL's have edited the schedule without asking or notifying people that their hours are different than the posted schedule, so people are showing up thirty minutes early/late because of these unnotified edits.   I've been with Target for almost four years and this is the first time this has happened. I understand needing to cut hours, but she could have approached it differently and with respect."
Target,2sf47m,razgriz23,2,Wed Jan 14 19:06:12 2015 UTC,"I've been asked to leave early when the truck is done. I remember when our store was a 4/5 am process, we got one truck done before 8 AM and had to punch out. But if she's cutting their hours on the schedule without telling them and they get in trouble, I say a call to corporate should be made. Never leave early unless they tell you to is what I stick by."
Target,2sf47m,Typical_White_Girl,1 point,Wed Jan 14 18:06:41 2015 UTC,"No one is being notified of the changes so people are showing up for their scheduled shifts and aren't able to clock in, or the time clock is saying they're late because someone adjusted the time without saying anything. My co-workers schedule said three different things yesterday. The schedule on the wall in TSC said one thing, the grid said another, and EHR said a third different time. Wtf."
Target,2sf47m,FenrirSM,1 point,Wed Jan 14 19:13:03 2015 UTC,"We have a new TL writing the schedule and he recently did this to me, I told him I didn't want any issues to come out of this. When the three schedules say three different things its not my fault if im early for one, on time for for another and late for the latest."
Target,2sf47m,itsamutiny,2,Fri Jan 16 07:41:55 2015 UTC,"They are easily within their rights to tell you to leave early. However, she does have to give 48 hour notice to schedule changes for you to be held accountable for them. So she can take you off, you show up, she says go home, she's okay. But if she adds you, you don't show up, and she didn't notify you? That's where she messed up.  I see people throwing in their individual store experiences. For the record, I've been working at Target for 6 years and I've seen this happen more times than I can remember. I've also seen it at every other corporation I've worked at. It's just a thing, it happens. Don't take it personally, find a better paying job and move on if it becomes a habit."
Target,2sf47m,FenrirSM,2,Thu Jan 15 13:34:49 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I worked at Target for 5 years and never once saw this happen. It really depends on the individual store I guess."
Target,2sf47m,FenrirSM,1 point,Sat Jan 17 01:15:05 2015 UTC,Thank you for your response. I guess I was spoiled by my old STL.
Target,2sf47m,itsamutiny,1 point,Thu Jan 15 14:08:31 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. If it's any help, I'd suggest looking at it from the opposite angle; would YOU want to pay someone to do nothing? When you look at it like that, it makes a lot more sense."
Target,2sbgxd,Shell-of-Light,1 point,Tue Jan 13 20:25:09 2015 UTC,"As soon as an in store pickup drops into the system, before its even been picked, your stores inventory with reflect the order. That's why, sometimes when you are picking an item, it will say zero on hands. The item you are picking had one on hand and was subtracted as soon as the order was placed. This prevents multiple orders of the same item when you only have one left.  Something like a 3DS XL should be on hand most the time. The most common issues are a mispick on the part of the DC and theft.  Seeing as they're clearance, I would also add on to your comment that they may be sitting in the pricing area or on a clearance flat waiting to be run to the floor."
Target,2sbgxd,zieen,9,Tue Jan 13 22:21:23 2015 UTC,"Inventory counts are off alot,  so yes it is common. Our toys inventory was not to be trusted during the holidays"
Target,2sbgxd,adamb10,5,Fri Jan 16 17:08:51 2015 UTC,"we might have one in the store. imagine the amount of items in the store, and the size of an average store. now imagine how many times that people want to buy an item then stuff it in some random area. we haven't found them yet. maybe the numbers haven't updated what's sold.   electronics will know they have none they know of. guest service will say what the system says we should have.   there are random times that the stock is it fell behind a shelf. counts are never the we actually have on hand we are just screwing your from finding the item."
Target,2sbgxd,monkeyman80,3,Tue Jan 13 21:59:53 2015 UTC,"Another possibility is that maybe the store DOES have 4, but they are shown in the system as being on the floor and not located in the backroom anywhere. In reality, they could be somewhere in the backroom, not located in the system appropriately, and no one has any idea they're actually there, and won't have a clue until someone randomly stumbles across them. Asking someone to look for that is like asking for someone to search for a needle in a haystack. It just isn't going to happen, the amount of space the backrooms contain is massive, and it's all filled with stuff. And that's if it even ACTUALLY exists. If the guy said he doesn't have it... You're simply not getting it from him, whether he does or doesn't (he probably doesn't, to be fair). Time to move on!"
Target,2sbgxd,FenrirSM,3,Wed Jan 14 02:35:45 2015 UTC,"Counts are off almost way too often. Can't tell you how many times people call and say ""Well your website says you have 1 (or 2) in Stock"" I understand, sir. However our counts aren't always accurate and can be off by a number or two. The system also updates at 8am every morning, so it's possible guests have come in to buy the item since then. I can guarantee that we do not have the item in Stock right now, though. I can check another store, if you'd like ""your website sucks. Bye.""  It's also possible that it is in Stock but it hasn't been pushed yet, so it could be in a cart in the back somewhere. Usually best to be safe and just say you don't have it though.   Also, if a team member in electronics says they're out of something but the website says otherwise, trust them. If it's a hot item, or if they answer really quickly, that typically means people have been asking all day if said item is in Stock, and they know for a fact they don't have it because they've been forced to check in the back 5 times."
Target,2sbgxd,irishdanmurphy,2,Wed Jan 14 12:13:52 2015 UTC,"It's quite common. Off the top of my head we show 4 smash Bros 3ds game but are none. 6 of a Polaroid instant film that were out of. 2 GTA V/last of us ps4 bundles that were out of. 10 of a certain specialty battery were out of. 3 different TVs show us with having 2 on hand (1 being display) which we don't.   As you can see, it happens quite a bit and we get asked about it quite a bit. That's why the electronics guy was quite sure and quick to the answer. We've been asked the same thing for a week or 2. I'll check the first time I get asked but if someone's the 2nd person looking at the quantity hasn't changed, I already know we don't have it."
Target,2sbgxd,dubblechzburger,3,Wed Jan 14 17:34:26 2015 UTC,"It's DPCI. After an item goes clearance, you cannot change on hands easily. I'm willing to bet the TM who told you no ""almost too quickly"" has been asked this question mutiple times and is the best person to know what their physical stock is like."
Target,2sbgxd,aoutrance,1 point,Thu Jan 15 02:42:32 2015 UTC,"A higher value item like that, AP or Instocks should be submitting count adjustment forms. Just depends how on the ball those teams are."
Target,2sbgxd,zieen,1 point,Tue Jan 13 22:30:57 2015 UTC,"These 3ds  came out before smash brothers came out on 3ds... which has been a few months... even with counts I highly doubt that  any store has these avail, being that they were limited edition  when they  came out.... stop harassing the electronics  team about these things when ur trying to be a cheap gamer.... we have feeling to... (electron tm here)."
Target,2sbgxd,blazenx,1 point,Fri Jan 16 17:10:33 2015 UTC,"Go in and physically check the clearance areas of electronics. Once an item goes it is hard for the store to change counts unless they sell. Also willing to bet there is ""no longer a place"" for them on the floor so they get put with other clearance. Unless the person you talked to is on price change, 9 times out of 10 they don't know where it would be!!"
Target,2sbgxd,Andosphere,1 point,Wed Jan 14 01:44:04 2015 UTC,"Inventory inaccuracy is common in Canada Target as well. I work in elex too, and I see alot of 4 on hand, zero on shelf and no backroom location found. People generally working in elex know whats on sale, and try to keep a count of how much they have before they start telling people they are sold out. Also keep in mind, on-hold items may be down at guest services and we don't usually track those. I actually have a huge item list to submit to research request tomorrow, to turn all empty item counts down to zero."
Target,2sa0zm,Rhinoj97,8,Tue Jan 13 13:24:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you work more than 50% in a different work center, you are supposed to get the pay adjustment. Talk to HR. If they can't do it, talk to STL. If that fails, call the number. If they have the job posting with electronics, take it with you. I'd be very active about money I should be paid. I got hired on as flow, transfered to backroom and worked there till seasonal. When seasonal hit, I went back to flow. They had me training people that were brought in higher pay than me. I talked to the HR who wouldn't do anything. Gave her a week. Then I went to the STL and told her that I could not train team members who were being paid more than me. She agreed, and got on HR's ass. Two weeks later, I had my pay increase plus back pay.  My suggestion to you is that if you are not paid as an electronics team member, tell them not to schedule you as one. Same for backroom. One of two things will happen. Either they'll put you back on sales floor, or pay you the higher rate. If there is another store near by, look and see if they have an electronics posting. Tell them that if you can't get paid what your supposed to, then you'll transfer to a store that will. If you're a good working, they'll try to keep you. If not, the store is probably shit anyways."
Target,2sa0zm,Hero4sale85,4,Tue Jan 13 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"If there is another store near by, look and see if they have an electronics posting.

Target,2sa0zm,slutbutt_sloptart,4,Tue Jan 13 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"They're not required to pay you any more. They should, but they don't have a time frame in which they must, or else.   Also, giving you a raise probably isn't in the cards if they're trying you in a third work center."
Target,2sa0zm,scotty269,3,Tue Jan 13 14:02:31 2015 UTC,My ETL-HR told me they evaluate these things quarterly and change workcenters as needed.
Target,2sa0zm,itsamutiny,1 point,Tue Jan 13 14:05:43 2015 UTC,"yeah you can work other work centers without being paid what they are. unless work center is changed, you're not getting paid more."
Target,2sa0zm,monkeyman80,1 point,Wed Jan 14 02:31:57 2015 UTC,"But if you work more than 50% of your shifts in that work center, you have to be keyed as that work center."

As soon as my seasonal period was up I was cross-trained in hardlines, market, electronics, target cafe, and Starbucks. Almost all my shifts are in Starbucks now and they finally changed my workcenter so I get $0.50 more per hour. I asked them countless times and it took them over a year from when I had my last Cart Attendant shift to finally make the change.  Just keep bugging them about it until they make the change."
Target,2sa0zm,steuby,1 point,Tue Jan 13 14:24:45 2015 UTC,I got moved to consumables after being in electronics and hardlines for about 3 or 4 months and haven't gotten a raise aside from Minimum wage being bumped up in my state.   They haven't talked to me about a raise or anything even though I'm doing way more then just a regular hardlines employee would. I would try and talk to someone about it like the others suggested. Probably start with hr and if they don't help maybe another store is hiring for electronics or backroom

Target,2s4wr4,goldenllama1,6,Mon Jan 12 05:13:06 2015 UTC,"Former team member of six years here. It really all depends on the store you work at and your HR department. Technically, during your first 90 days you can be fired for almost any reason and Target is safe because they can just write it off as you not being ""Target brand."" Having said that, if you're feeling particularly awful, call out ASAP. I'm talking like 8am. It's very important that you make sure you speak to an LOD. Leaving a message with the operator saying you don't feel well and that you won't be in today is still classified as a no call no show because you didn't talk with an LOD (trust me on this one, it bit me in the ass twice during my tenure with Target). As someone else suggested, try and get a doctor's note. It'll help a lot. Also, the LODs will almost always try and make you feel bad when you're calling out by saying things like ""you know this will go against your performance"" or things like that. Don't let it get to you. You just need to make it clear to them that you're actually sick, you're really sorry, and that you'll get a doctor's note if need be. Hell, I used to be a GSTL, and I had a cashier come in one morning and take their temperature in front of me just to prove that they had a fever (they did too, it was 101°).   Ultimately, don't fret it too much dude. Just try and get some rest. I'm sure that your LODs realize that it's flu season and there's some awful shit going around. Hope you feel better."
Target,2s4wr4,Noob_tuba23,2,Mon Jan 12 06:00:20 2015 UTC,No you shouldn't get fired as long as you gave 12 hours in advance and you don't this often. A doctors note would help alot aso
Target,2s4wr4,irondragon1980,3,Mon Jan 12 05:32:32 2015 UTC,My shift starts at 2 pm do you have any idea what the earliest is I would be able to talk to someone?
Target,2s4wr4,initialgold,8,Mon Jan 12 05:42:12 2015 UTC,"call at 8am or around 8:15, that's when target opens. just ask to talk the LOD and tell them you're really sorry but you're throwing up and can't come in today."
Target,2s4wr4,FenrirSM,2,Mon Jan 12 06:20:23 2015 UTC,"You got hired early January? Normally I'd say this would mean you're going to be dismissed out of hand since this is when they normally lay off all of the seasonal people, but if you're store is literally THAT desperate that they are hiring people early January, you may get away with it... If you have a doctor's note."
Target,2s4wr4,monkeyman80,1 point,Mon Jan 12 10:31:16 2015 UTC,"we understand. you don't get the perfect attendance star. sick, ok. call out sick when its convenient? we notice.   a good way to get on the good side? as many times as you can, when they call you to cover a shift, you say yes."
Target,2s4wr4,unsuspectingrobocop,1 point,Wed Jan 14 02:49:34 2015 UTC,I think the rule is if it is a no call no show in the first 90 days it is automatic termination (may be wrong) the best thing for you to do is to call and ask to speak to lod and inform them that you are too sick to work.
Target,2s4wr4,WorthyAlpaca,-7,Mon Jan 12 05:33:22 2015 UTC,"Go into work, try to 'work' but if you don't feel well. Inform your LOD."
Target,2s4wr4,iJeffwuh,3,Mon Jan 12 05:35:57 2015 UTC,"If he/she is throwing up before hand, don't do this. You really don't need to expose yourself to others and get more people sick. If you are sick. Call in ASAP and tell them you are sick. Apologize for any inconvenience. If you work the next day, tell them you will do your best to come in tomorrow. If you think it might take more than a day, get a doctors note.   Feel better."
Target,2s4wr4,monkeyman80,1 point,Mon Jan 12 08:14:56 2015 UTC,"plus we can cover a shift with notice. you try to work, and leave 10 min in, yeah, we can't get someone to come in."

Target,2s2xe2,Fr0stSoldier,7,Sun Jan 11 19:11:10 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you were able to work in softlines then. From what I see, cashiers don't really get many hours, and it looks absolutely boring to just be standing there checking people out for hours."

Target,2s31yi,MindAsWell,2,Tue Jan 13 04:35:13 2015 UTC,"At my store we were all paid time and a half. I'm pretty sure it's law in Ontario for boxing day. Trust your ETL, they are going to be more informed than a regular team member."
Target,2ryg77,Help_me_Men,6,Sat Jan 10 11:46:16 2015 UTC,"Target does pre-employment drug screenings, reasonable cause (e.g.- you are at work and are high on something), and post-accident. They decided to eliminate pre-employment for those who were hired for seasonal positions (cashier, sales floor, and flow team). You only have to worry about the latter two.  That being said, if you get in an accident or come to work acting erratically, you will be drug tested and, if you refuse or test positive, terminated."
Target,2ryg77,emdesche,2,Sat Jan 10 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"So hypothetically does that mean I'm safe to use outside work? I'm just scared because I don't know if they will or won't. I don't want to use and then all of a sudden for them to decide now is the time. This is medical by the way so will my prescription hold have any value if I do get tested? I've asked other employees and they say they were tested after they became a regular worker from seasonal, but that was also previous seasons prior to the announcement I posted in my original message."
Target,2ryg77,IronOreAgate,3,Sat Jan 10 18:25:34 2015 UTC,If it is prescription and you declare it then they shouldn't fire you over it. You might need your doctors notice however. Your best bet would be to not use any illegal substances at all. Then there is no reason to fire you.
Target,2ryg77,monkeyman80,1 point,Sat Jan 10 20:48:52 2015 UTC,"med weed still counts as drug use. they won't test you if there's not a reason. if you get injured then yeah, they'll test you before paying it."

Target,2ryg77,fetalbeetles,1 point,Sun Jan 11 03:18:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely not true. The difficulty is proving alcohol intoxication due to having 24 hours to complete the screening.

Target,2rxht2,VforNam,9,Sat Jan 10 03:33:30 2015 UTC,"Healthy? No idea.  Relatively cheap, and tastes pretty good? Market Pantry tacquitos. $3.29 (at my store), and you get two lunches out of them, if you eat like me. Microwave for 1:15, then toaster oven for five minutes or so, if your store has both of those.  I suppose the salads at Target Café are relatively healthy, but at $4.59 (my store), I think they're overpriced.  We sometimes have a problem with food being eaten out of the refrigerator. I've joked a few times that we should all buy desk safes to use as lunch boxes. If you have a lunch bag with two zippers, though, a cheap luggage lock might be worth it. Yes, a determined person could still take your food, but it will deter most people."
Target,2rxht2,pohatu771,5,Sat Jan 10 04:01:31 2015 UTC,"I have seen people eat other Hot Pockets and stuff, okay; be a dick, whatever. But when I saw someone take another's lunch box, open up their tupperware, and eat their homemade food - WTF?  The TM who's lunch they were eating actually came into the breakroom and he's like, ""Hey, nice food you got there! Looks familiar, oh, that's actually my leftovers from yesterday"" - awkward!"
Target,2rxht2,DoomedJanissary,1 point,Sat Jan 10 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"Taquitos don't sound like my stomach would like me towards the end of my shift. However, they might be something I'll grab for the house!  Salads definitely overpriced and not able to make a single serving salad at my store. The two zipper lock is something I'll look into. Thanks for your reply!"
Target,2rxht2,pohatu771,1 point,Sat Jan 10 18:08:21 2015 UTC,"Another option is the Market Pantry boneless chicken. They'll be the same price as the tacquitos, and in the same case, and give you two servings.  I like honey barbecue, I think the Buffalo style has a strange taste."
Target,2rxht2,itsamutiny,1 point,Sat Jan 10 18:36:29 2015 UTC,You could also buy the big bags of chicken nuggets and buy sauce separately. It would probably be a lot cheaper.
Target,2rxht2,pohatu771,1 point,Sat Jan 10 22:29:01 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  I prefer not to leave anything in the freezer at work, though, for reasons mentioned earlier."

Target,2rvic3,theblackjackblack,5,Fri Jan 9 17:29:50 2015 UTC,"One thing I love about our new STL is he's very very personable. Our last one was nice, but really kept to himself and to the other ETLs. To everyone else it was really basic ""hey how are ya, how's AAR doing, you going to get a redcard today??"" type of interactions.  Our new one is awesome. Genuinely talks to people, not just about work but just shooting the breeze and with everyone. He's obviously with ETLs and TLs more but that naturally happens. One night specifically for me was I had no one that knew electronics for my last 15. The guy who I was using for my other 2 left. So he came over and covered my break. Never had an ETL, let alone an STL do that before. Afterwards we spent almost 20 minutes talking about sports, TVs, various electronics. We're both big NFL and college basketball/football plans so he was telling me about his sports cave layout down in his basement and plans for it. And he's like that with so many team members. It makes it a lot easier to work under him because the environment he brought (our whole ETLs do honestly so we're pretty lucky) makes it not that bad to work here.  So I'd guess my advice is try not to be the STL who just fraternizes with the other ETLs/TLs and thinks of the TMs as the grunts of the operation. Being genuinely friendly/nice to the TMs really brings a good vibe!"
Target,2rvic3,dubblechzburger,1 point,Fri Jan 9 22:37:00 2015 UTC,Great advice! I'm the type of manager who really enjoys spending time with everyone. I don't look at myself as someone who is above any job in a store. And talking to my team and guests is something I really like to do. I try to get to know everyone I work with on a personal level. It helps me know where they want to go and how to help them get there.   Thanks again for the response! Very helpful!
Target,2rvic3,dubblechzburger,1 point,Sat Jan 10 15:25:24 2015 UTC,No problem! Good luck with the interview!
Target,2rvic3,bbradley86,4,Sat Jan 10 21:52:42 2015 UTC,Hey current stl here if you have worked for target for 6 years 2 as stl. I personally  love the company if you have any really specific questions pm me
Target,2rvic3,HemingfordGrey,1 point,Fri Jan 9 22:09:19 2015 UTC,Thank you! I will send you a PM shortly.
Target,2rvic3,HemingfordGrey,3,Sat Jan 10 15:22:47 2015 UTC,Are you sure it's for an STL position not an ETL position?
Target,2rvic3,HemingfordGrey,3,Fri Jan 9 18:20:49 2015 UTC,"Yes I am. I know that its a pretty uncommon occurrence for an outside hire to be considered for an STL position, however this is the direction that the recruiter has suggested."
Target,2rvic3,HarisC3,8,Fri Jan 9 18:38:35 2015 UTC,"Awesome, that's pretty rare from what i've seen but good for you. I've been working at Target for about 3.5 years, and although i'm just a team member i'll try to give you some advice since you're new to the company altogether. I'm pretty close with my STL, and he runs our store very well, so i'll go from what i've seen him do for the most part.   Get to know everyone in your store and what their positions are early on, how long they've been working there, etc. Just be friendly at first and find out a little bit about all the team members.  Especially get on good terms with your ETL's and TL's. They are kind of the bread and butter of the store and most likely know much more about their job than you will for the time being. Understand why they do things certain ways, and then ask yourself if it can be done better and possibly propose changes to them.  When my STL came to my store he fired an ETL right away, and was overtaking a fired STL, and our store was in bad shape. It's now doing amazing. My point is you are probably going to have ETL's, team leaders, and team members who are terrible at their job and just overall probably shouldn't be working there. It'll take some times to find out who these people are but just a warning that everyone's going to try and impress you for a few weeks and have a smile on there face but that doesn't mean everyone is great at their job. I don't mean to sound cynical but sometimes getting rid of the bad people and getting good people in their positions can do a lot for the store. Obviously don't go into the store hoping to fire people, but it could happen. Especially since you have a fresh view of everything you may see things other people don't. Keep an eye out but be careful what you say as well. Be friendly, but be stern. You don't have to be a hard ass but you don't want to be a push over by any means. You want your ETL's to be able to laugh and discuss things with you that aren't work related and like you as a person, but you also want them to worry about how the store looks on a Monday morning when you're coming in after your weekend off. You are ultimately their boss and however nice they may be to you, you can't let them get away with things and sacrifice the store's scores, or sales, or instocks. Because when your DTL and GTL come in for a visit you want to be confident with your team and your store, rather than scrambling to get things together. Offer advice to team members when you want them to do a better job. There are a lot of tasks that have to get done in a store that are terrible and no one wants to do them. But if you can find a way to make these easier, or less bad for lack of a better word, then it will look you are trying to help someone improve rather than telling someone what to do. You're going to learn a ton in your training, hopefully you get to shadow a good STL, and they will be able to give you way more advice than I probably can. Just remember to ask as many questions as you possibly can and probably take notes or something because you will be held accountable by your DTL for any process or decision going on in your store so you want to know how everything works. Guests shopping in Targets are the reason you and I both have jobs. You have regulars in your store, and you want them to continue to be regulars. Always try and make the guests as happy as you can, and stress this to your team as well. This is kind of obvious advice, but it's important and i'm sure you'll hear about it way more. Guests are Targets priority.   You are the top dog in your store if you get this position. Literally there is no one higher than you in the building and ultimately what you say goes. You have a lot of power, but you don't want to be seen as someone who abuses it. When people have problems then will often come to you, and at first you probably will not know the answer. Like team members coming to you asking why their hours got cut, or guests asking why target.com said you had something and you're out of stock at your store. Just a lot of little stuff that you're going to have to learn to deal with. I don't know your background of other jobs you've had or if you've managed before but it can get frustrating, as i'm sure you can imagine.  Although everything up there may sound bad, personally if you are at a good store in a good area, and you have/create a solid team, this job can be amazing. The pay is pretty good I assume, and you don't really have to do a lot of physical work from what I can tell. Maybe zone with the team every once in a while but in reality you don't have time to do that stuff anyway because you'll be busy with other things. There are a lot of perks to working at Target, let a lone being the STL. My STL and ETL's get lunch all the time (on Target's dime) and generally just enjoy each others company. It's a pretty laid back company, at least my store is, and doesn't seem like you'll get bored of your job like sitting in a cubicle all day. It's a nice mix because you have the store side, and the office side, so it helps to create a balance.  I can't really help you with interview stuff because that's way above my pay grade and I have no idea what they ask, but I assume you can google it or something. You have to look at each months payroll and determine the hours and stuff, and look at your stores sales and try and improve survey scores and all that stuff if it's going bad. So they may ask you questions on how to improve on things, or work projects you've had in the past, or stuff like that i'm not really sure. But it seems like you did well on the assessment which is good.  I realize that this is a lot to take in for someone who doesn't have the job and hasn't worked at Target before but I tried to make it general enough so that you could get a feel for everything. I personally really like working at Target, mostly because I love my position, people I work with, and my store. That all REALLY plays a role in everything. Tough it out it may be hard for a while especially if the old STL left the store in bad condition, but it can be fixed I promise you just have to know how to solve problems and don't be afraid to take a different approach than the norm, and try something new, even if your ETL's say it hasn't been done like that before. You'll get the hang of it quickly i'm sure. Let me know if you have any questions at all, I know a lot about Target, and the store side of things pretty well i'd say. Also i'm on Reddit way to much so i'll probably respond quickly.  Sorry if there's grammar issues or my syntax is weird, I was kind of just trying to get everything out of my brain."

We have 2-3 people that work on breaking out the repacks into areas and the personal care/pharmacy stuff into aisles.  They start as soon as they get there with the truck team and are normally done breaking out just a little bit after the unload is done.  As for distributing, there is sometimes one person that does it while they are breaking out and after the truck is done, everybody grabs one or two and takes them with them to drop them off.  That only leaves the repack people one set of buggies to drop off.  As for pushing them, there are normally at least 2 people pushing them and then when I get done with electronics I help them out too since I have a PDA already."

Target,2rolcg,radio_dead,2,Thu Jan 8 02:12:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I got promoted at my other job and took hours at target plus I'm at school. I love the people I work with but I go in, do what work I can in the time I'm there and don't worry about it at all. I used to stress about it all the time when I was full time."
Target,2rolcg,FirePowerCR,5,Thu Jan 8 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"Almost never....we are understaffed too. And yet were told ""we need to be 100% clean today."" I think it's just something they are told from higher ups to tell us. They know it's impossible. I'm pretty damn fast/accurate but I'm not going to bust my ass just for some huddle recognition. If I think it's possible...i love clearing tubs/flats quickly. But during the holidays it's like...""Backroom team nice job 100% clean"" and then the next day it's a disaster...I stopped caring so much."
Target,2rolcg,radio_dead,6,Wed Jan 7 23:45:59 2015 UTC,Coming clean?  lol
Target,2rolcg,MrKentucky,3,Thu Jan 8 01:32:36 2015 UTC,"Basically never, my flow team is understaffed so we seem to be scrapping the bottom most of the morning and then when its time to leave the last vehicles arrive in the back and we have to leave it to the one guy who's going to spend the next 5 hours just pulling(some recent rescheduling means that i am now that one guy, it sucks on both sides).  On top of that as a now dayside TM, not only can i not get to those last few flow vehicles because im just constantly pulling throughout the day, after pulls and PC is completed i generally spend the rest of my time getting the line set again for the next days truck, losing 10 minutes of the unload team's time seemed like a good trade off for having the night guy spend an hour moving pallets everywhere and dropping the plastic pallets so nothing can possibly get done after the morning team leaves.  Its even worse when the flow understaffing means that a truck isnt even completely worked, i once barricaded all of menswear with pallets that still needed to be worked and half of womens wear with the carts of freight just to make room in the back to prep for the next truck to get unloaded."
Target,2rolcg,DrMoomoo,3,Thu Jan 8 01:15:36 2015 UTC,My store doesn't really come clean unless there are no call ins. When everyone shows (rarely happens) we generally will come clean mainly because once flow finishes freight we jump back and help back stock
Target,2rolcg,SanltarYNAPkin,3,Thu Jan 8 03:06:56 2015 UTC,"As an electronics team member, I'm curious. Do yall's stores make you guys responsible for the electronics stock room? Like all our backroom people do is pull CAFs and autofills and just leave them back there."
Target,2rolcg,rh51too,2,Thu Jan 8 05:48:32 2015 UTC,"The one flow member who pushes the truck will do the morning autofill and then the electronics team member/members will push the rest of them throughout the day. If one gets left over, the flow member will push them the next day if they're there. At times though the flow member will pull the autofills and bring them out and push the batteries for the electronics team."
Target,2rolcg,razgriz23,2,Fri Jan 9 03:34:21 2015 UTC,"The flow team at my store does the pulls and backstocking. They never come clean and leave it for the dayside. We then have to deal with pulls, backstock, push, and flexible fulfillments which means we rarely come clean at night."
Target,2rolcg,maxc7,2,Thu Jan 8 01:42:29 2015 UTC,"NEVER. As the only dayside taking over for a 4 man morning crew, typically we had about 5-10 vehicles in backstock plus usually at least 2 in both the dairy cooler and freezer."
Target,2rolcg,munkymedic,2,Thu Jan 8 04:54:15 2015 UTC,"I work overnight in my store and we rarely come clean anymore ever since myTime and the security breach. We used to have 12 backroom team members in this 2 floor Target for doubles (~2500 each truck). Since then, we lost 7 team members and gained 2. I am thinking of leaving, and so are 5 other team members.   It's just so much bullshit going around with the ETL's it's fustrating. Coming clean, zoning, no trash on the floor,time frames, and then they get mad when you dont want to stay later.   Edit: We're also using mobile shelving in the backroom in this Target, I'm not sure which other store also has this. These shelves suck compared to the old ones, because only one person can be in there. Before, we used to come clean FOUR HOURS before the end of our shift. We'd go home at like 3am"

Target,2rl9hi,Coreyyvette,3,Wed Jan 7 03:29:35 2015 UTC,"1- I'm a GSTL.... sadly this is true but trust me when I say it has nothing to do us but rather the ETLGE and the STL. My store too has been cracking down on this to the point I'm being forced to write up pretty much everyone who isn't 3.5% (( which in its own is bullsh*t since the COMPANY goal is 2.5%)) . its awful. Our entire district is blood red which should tell the company something... No ""oh cashier aren't asking"" but instead ""oh maybe since everyone is having issues with hacking people aren't signing up like they use to""... But of course that can't be the case.  2- as for 3 write ups get you fired.... Not true. Do you know how hard it is to get fired from Target... Like short of physical violence and 3 NCNS in a row... It takes forever/alot to to be fired. For one, you have to be coached multiples times for the same offense in X amount of time before an actual write up... Once you do hit that write up lvl you still have to be coached again a certain amount of times before you get your final... And even then you get more chances while on your final to correct the issue... Mind you there is a time limit for all finals,write ups, and coachings... If you get wrote up and some time has passed then they can no longer use it against you, it falls off so to speak. What the time limit for each I can't remember. Honestly its a scare tacit. Yes get RedCards... It's your job and part of your core roles...m yes its hard at times and you can get in trouble for not getting them.... The odds of you solely being fired for this reason... HIGHLY UNLIKELY."
Target,2rl9hi,LeChiotx,4,Wed Jan 7 05:36:40 2015 UTC,"There are a few things I have been thinking about RedCards since working at Target.    The first is wondering if Target Corporate takes into account saturation level of Red Cards within an area.  You cant tell me that 2.5% is an accurate representation across the board for every store location.  I would expect some areas to be like 1.0% expectation and some to be like, maybe, 3.5%.  How long has Target had the Red Card?  We need to consider the fact that a new TM, today, has the hardest challenge of any Target TM yet, simply because everyone before him has been able to snag all of the ""easy"" Red Card sales already.  Selling Red Cards gets more difficult with every card sold.  The second thing is the popular ""Yeah I have a Red card, but I don't want to use it today."".  This screws the cashier.  It seems like every time the guest says this, the prompt comes up on the screen.  What I really need is an additional option for this case, although I can see how it could be abused.  The third thing is more of a question than anything.  I have noticed that on particular days the store will offer prizes to TMs for, say, the first three cards obtained.  Sometimes they are substantial prizes as well!  I wonder why instead as a salesman for Red Cards, why I can't offer some additional incentives, possibly for people who are on the fence about getting one. For example, ""I can additionally give you an extra 10% off this purchase today if you sign up for the Target Red Card that has 27.98% APR.""  (Ninja Edit): The fourth thing I just thought of is how frustrated I get at the fact that Red Cards are such an individualistic goal.  We're all on the same team, right?  Why not encourage an environment of overall store goals rather than individual goals for Red Cards.  I have several times mentioned to a guest with a cart full of items and reminded them about the 5% off Red Card while pointing to a cashier and saying ""They can get you set up if you're interested"".  And I don't know if I have ever resulted in any that way, but its the teamwork principle.  Just some thoughts."
Target,2rl9hi,TM0064278933,2,Wed Jan 7 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"I will comment on third and ninja edit since I agree with what is being said on first and second  Third-- now I know in my store when it comes to electronics and attachments they are allowed to haggle and make deals to a point ""hey get this control and service plan with your TV and I can give you an addition X amount off"". To me I never understood why we couldn't do that with redcards. Like adding another 5% when you spend more then $250 in store... That alone will increase sales in my opinion....  Ninja Edit-- see I'm iffy on this. Yes its a team effort so when we make it as a whole we shouldn't nitpick. However it is highly unfair for 3 cashiers to carry the weight of the store. When you sign up to be a team member officially you are saying you agree to uphold your end of the bargains and maintain a percentage. I know with every interview I do I always ask they thoughts on up selling and how comfortable they would be pushing the redcard, not taking the first no for the answer you know. We all need to work as a team yes but you also can't always rely in your ole faithfuls to be the only ones who do this. Its unfair and frankly promotes laziness. Mind you I'm speaking more so for cashiers then sales floor tms"
Target,2rl9hi,LeChiotx,1 point,Wed Jan 7 18:16:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess agree with you on the team effort part.  That was why it was not one of my main points.  I think you would need some really devoted employees regardless of the company to really have it be a true team effort.  Given the environment, it's probably better to have the individual mandates in the end, or else people will take advantage of that."

Target,2rl9hi,l0singmymarbles,1 point,Wed Jan 7 18:41:54 2015 UTC,"there is a saturation point, but at least from what i've been told we want 25% of sales on redcards. we hover around 17%. yeah, if your red card sales are 50% i'm sure they're a little more lenient on conversion. no stores in my district are near 25% so 2.5 is still reliable.   as to why we can offer incentives to team members and not guests, its the way its accounted for. we have an expense account for team member recognition. its easy to req a prize instead of offering a discount on what they're buying.   if we expense whatever the guests get, then its fine."
Target,2rl9hi,monkeyman80,3,Thu Jan 8 01:21:03 2015 UTC,"I think the true problem with redcard conversion isn't really about the hacking, but more about the 5%.  It's just not enough for people to really care.  ""10% surething, 5%?  Maybe next time.""   Edit.  10% not 0%"
Target,2rl9hi,GOforTPS,1 point,Wed Jan 7 05:52:36 2015 UTC,"Another reason right there. I mean its only nice when you pair it up with Cartwheel ... And for us tms our Discounts...

At least like a point system... Idk"
Target,2rl9hi,LeChiotx,1 point,Wed Jan 7 05:57:49 2015 UTC,"15% off upon sign up, 5% after that would drive conversion.  I Think Kohls offers 20% if approved, but then nothing after that."

When I am trying to sling a Red Card on a high dollar purchase, I always try to roughly figure out the amount they would save, such as ""You would be saving an additional $35 if you signed up today."", but if it is a low dollar purchase I always say 5% instead of ""You will be saving 7.3 cents today."""

Target,2rl9hi,blazenx,2,Thu Jan 8 03:19:36 2015 UTC,The weird thing about red cards and really and company's credit card or anything that they hound you to sell is that is a minimum wage job and they expect you to generate more revenue for the company with pretty much no personal gain. You might get a promotion if you're really good at it but you're probably really good at other things that got you the promotion.
Target,2rl9hi,FirePowerCR,3,Wed Jan 7 18:53:26 2015 UTC,"Former cashier/GSA/cart attendant for 2 years here. Your Guest Services ETL watches who gets red cards very closely. And if one of the cashiers is consistently in the red, they will have a talk with the GSTL. The GSTL will be told to keep an eye on you in particular and do the best to motivate you to get conversions.   But, here's the kicker. If they hear you asking your guests consistently, there is nothing they can do. They cannot write you up, they cannot take corrective action, they can't do anything reprehensive about your conversion rate. Sure they can do suggest new ways for you to make conversions, but they cannot punish.   If you don't ask your guests, then the ETL will have no problem giving you corrective action.   EDIT: This only applies to those employed after 90 days. If you have been there for less than 90 days, they can give you the boot for any reason."
Target,2rl9hi,theuglybadger,1 point,Wed Jan 7 04:45:11 2015 UTC,"I was in the yellow today when I was given this talk. I'm almost always in the yellow, because i get about 1 or 2 redcards a week.

Target,2rl9hi,monkeyman80,1 point,Wed Jan 7 05:46:34 2015 UTC,"you can get coached if you ask everyone. asking isn't enough. we give advice. as long as you're not going to piss them off for asking, keep talking. the ones who are routinely around 4% are the ones who don't take no for an answer.   now if you're repeatedly coached, are you going to be removed? meh. like others have said its hard to fire someone past their 90."
Target,2rl9hi,HLTL,1 point,Thu Jan 8 01:31:19 2015 UTC,"In short: yes, you are allowed to be written up for it.  Since you work in the front end of the store, conversion is apart of your core roles. My store would argue that it's apart of everyone's core roles. Other posters are correct in that you can't make guests sign up for REDcards and if they hear you asking, they'll usually give you a pass. You have to make sure though, if you're asking, that you're either trying different methods of delivery or at least sounding sincere when you bring it up.   It may seem like something small to fire someone over, but it is one area of performance for team members. I even have to have conversations and coach team members for not meeting expectations for accessories in Electronics. Same principle."

Target,2rd6n0,ThrowawayTM2015,6,Mon Jan 5 03:45:15 2015 UTC,"I'm Food Ave now. I started at target as Plano (presentation team). It's a lot of work to be honest. If you like doing things that make you feel accomplished, then this is the place for you to go. It's hard at times. Like someone else said, you're going to have easy planograms to set, then there will be hard ones. Training is a bit confusing but once you understand, it'll all click. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Better to ask a silly question and get a correct answer than to set a whole aisle backwards. (Trust me it's happened). You're going to feel overwhelmed at times but if you ask for some assistance then you'll probably get it. As someone said, you'll be working alone a lot but usually you guys work in the same area. If you feel overwhelmed by a planogram, it's understandable. Maybe the underestimated it. It could be a two person job. Sometimes the planogram calls for sections 1 and 3 to switch with sections 4 and 6. It's all very confusing but someone at corporate made the decision to switch them so it's probably what they want. Anyway, if you notice you're in a tough Plano and you don't think you can do it all by yourself, ask someone for assistance. You'll realize that Presentation team is really a team. It's not like cashiering at all where you're more individual up front getting red cards. Your expectations are higher but you'll get more reward from Plano than anywhere else in the store imo. If you have any other questions you can dm me and I can help you. I haven't done Plano in 3 years but I was Plano for 13 months so I remember it all.   Fun story: one of my first shifts they had me do the Lego aisle.... Well.. No one told me I couldn't leave stuff on the floor and I guess it's common sense but when the store opened I had an aisle full of repacks on tubs and flats. I was about to hit my fifth and had to go but I was sweating with stress. My ETL came over and told me to go on my lunch. When I came back I saw him finishing the set and covering my ass. He helped me set the Plano and then stock it. One of the best ETL's I've ever had. He didn't coach me or anything. Just told me that if I ever needed help to ask my TL or my team and if they couldn't help me to call him and he'd gladly help. Was a cool guy. Thanks Jeff."
Target,2rd6n0,k929,1 point,Mon Jan 5 07:27:19 2015 UTC,"good leadership is always happy to help new. we understand what you got thrown into. we rarely get training hours, so you're in over your head.   there are times like this. we like someone and feel they can handle more.   the only issue is when we have shown you lots of times. after 2 times you should be able to at least be able to do it with some assistance. not ""i don't know how to do it"""
Target,2rd6n0,monkeyman80,4,Thu Jan 8 01:37:04 2015 UTC,"Presentation team literally builds everything in the store. Setting all the new planograms. There are easy ones to set. And there are hard ones. But basically you empty everything on the existing Plano,  then use your paper planogram that tells you how to put new one together. From putting up new backer paper, using a schematic to put pegs and shelves where they go, putting up labels, displays and signing. Then stocking the new product. It's a lot of work. But good if you like to work independently. As you may be By yourself all day working on the aisle you were assigned."
Target,2rd6n0,conniem1973,2,Mon Jan 5 04:27:22 2015 UTC,"No.  Presentation is setting the aisles, creating the places where things go. From entire aisle sets to single-item revisions. This also may include softlines and sales plans, but that varies by store and the team.  You'll zone in the sense that you will be putting product on the shelf, but you will be starting with an empty shelf first."
Target,2rd6n0,pohatu771,1 point,Mon Jan 5 04:27:10 2015 UTC,"It's not going to be remotely anything like what you've experienced there as a cashier. There is going to be a huge learning curve at first, and I won't lie, it's going to be way harder than what you've been doing. That being said, it's also way more satisfying, rewarding, and gives you much more freedom to work how you want to work.  Don't worry, no one expects you to know how to do things at first, but be prepared to use functions in the PDAs that work based on abstract concepts (for instance, you'll be responsible for 'tying' the planograms to their home locations, which is how the system defines where things go and how many of them get pulled to the floor). You'll also be using the computers pretty frequently (mostly for label printing). Just remember to ask questions, and remember that your team is ACTUALLY a team and that you all are going to be looking out for each other. That's probably one of the most rewarding parts about doing it honestly; you know who has your back in that position."

Target,2qwk1i,karmasink,1 point,Fri Jan 2 04:17:02 2015 UTC,Getting kept on after seasonal is a straight up crapshoot. Because it's so much harder to fire people after their ninety leaders essentially have to predict potentially years of future performance on a couple months. Even little things can set off a red flag and the cost of letting a good TM walk is lower than the cost of keeping a bad one.
Target,2qv9d7,CarlosTheChick,2,Wed Dec 31 00:16:21 2014 UTC,"Take it slow and practice, practice, practice.  It's really not something you can pick up overnight.  Just move slow and watch your load (pallet) and the crown's feet."
Target,2qv9d7,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,2,Wed Dec 31 00:52:55 2014 UTC,"Try practicing movement with the regular pallet jacks first. Sometimes those things can go places you werent expecting. Plus the Crown is kinda weird, since you're not supposed to PUSH pallet jacks, but you're gonna have to push the Crown around.  The Wave is still the more fun piece of equipment to use lol."
Target,2qv9d7,Buttstache,3,Wed Dec 31 01:28:02 2014 UTC,"Agreed. The Wave is a lot more fun. Except when you're trying to shift huge boxes around at the top shelves in steel... Oh gawd, the wobble. Plus my hair bumps against beams and lights... (Yay mohawks!)  There are definitely times when the Crown is a lot more efficient though. Take your time, watch your spacing. If you see the product start to wobble a lot; take it slower and try to not drop anything."
Target,2qv9d7,Isak922,2,Wed Dec 31 04:59:16 2014 UTC,"Remember to always pull the pallet whenever you can, it will just follow you then, when parking it's like driving a car in reverse. Its actually a lot like steering a flat, you steer from the back when pushing it.  This applies to both the powered an non powered jacks.  I always get the near front corner where i want it to be to go forward into place first, then rotate everything around that point and then finally forward when lined up, maybe moving a bit forward to deal with space restrictions.  Its almost easier to learn on the Crown pallet stacker because you can use the arms to help guide you."
Target,2qv9d7,DrMoomoo,1 point,Wed Dec 31 06:11:59 2014 UTC,"Its almost easier to learn on the Crown pallet stacker because you can use the arms to help guide you.

Just make sure to check that nothing is snagging."
Target,2qv9d7,3osh,2,Sat Jan 17 17:54:24 2015 UTC,"Yes go slow...I always feel like people are judging me when I'm using it....but screw them because I'd rather be safe. A great trick I picked up is find exactly how high the forks need to be to reach the pallets on the top and mark it on the machine so you'll never have to guess how high or low you need to go. I'm pretty good with the crown...but it's definitely intimidating. My advice is don't try to shy away from it...I avoided it for a long time but I just kept forcing myself to do it. You're going to suck and be slow with it...remember Target wants you to be safe so you don't have to go whipping it around all crazy like you see some people do. Practice with the pallets on the bottom...pull them out, put them back in...work on tough angles....if you miss...pull out and try it again"

Target,2qurzm,SlightlyConfusedGuy,6,Tue Dec 30 21:46:26 2014 UTC,"From my understanding, it's very difficult to get promoted to ETL inside the company (They usually won't look at you until you're a senior team lead). I would recommend talking to your STL about your intentions. You could also check out the corporate side of the hiring website, where the list all the exempt jobs (I just did a quick search for executive and there were a bunch of listings). From what I can tell, a lot of candidates for Target business college come from university job fairs.  I wish you luck and I hope this helps."
Target,2qurzm,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,3,Tue Dec 30 21:56:10 2014 UTC,"Your STL or ETLs in your store can be your biggest advocates. As a sales floor TM who made the jump directly to ETL after graduating college, my advice is to form a mentor/mentee relationship with any ETL you are comfortable with. They have a lot of communication with the DTL (who you will interview with if you apply) and can help by both preparing you and talking you up to those who have more influence on who is hired for that position. Most (good) ETLs will take time for your development - mine helped by conducting mock interviews, giving honest feedback regarding my strengths and opportunities, and discussing the position further so that when I did go into interviews, I was confident in my knowledge of the position.   If Target recruits at your school and graduates are welcome to participate in career fairs, speaking to recruiters is also a good idea. Many come from different stores within a district, and since the initial two interviews are with ETLs/STLs, networking beyond your store is beneficial. This also could help the difficulty making the ""jump"" up to ETL without climbing the organizational ladder, since you would be recruited from your school rather than the store.   Best of luck to you - feel free to contact me if you have questions."
Target,2qurzm,emdesche,2,Wed Dec 31 01:38:25 2014 UTC,"eligible based on degree means nothing. gsa material is a step down from tl benefits. if you interned during college you'd get an etl position but its hard to earn it.   if you're just an electronics team member with a degree, gsa is a great leaping position to tl. you're a leader, and they can see how you do. the degree will help you vs other candidates but its not as slam dunk as intern etl's."
Target,2qurzm,monkeyman80,1 point,Wed Dec 31 02:09:06 2014 UTC,"Don't take a GSA or GSTL position without talking to your STL first. Tell your STL you want to be an ETL and ask what is recommeneded for you to do to get there. If your STL recommends a TL position, it means he/she wants to see more development from you and you'd be eligible to interview for ETL in about 18 months. Your STL could also just start setting you up for ETL interviews, depending on his/her opinion of your readiness. But, forst you have to tell your STL you're interested"
Target,2qurzm,fetalbeetles,1 point,Wed Dec 31 15:50:22 2014 UTC,If you have worked as a non management roll you will have an excessively difficult time getting into one. Corporate has a de facto separation between the two for a variety of (nefarious in my opinion) reasons.
Target,2qvx1k,ssjAWSUM,9,Wed Dec 31 03:58:40 2014 UTC,"Sorry, but you're too new. While it could happen, you shouldn't get your hopes up. You need more experience in the store before taking a TL experience. In another 6 months it will still be pretty quick to become a TL, but more realistic."

Target,2qvx1k,AHintOfTruth,1 point,Wed Dec 31 04:40:14 2014 UTC,"its easier to apply to positions at different stores than moving up. you're identified as a strong cashier,   they'll put you at service desk, maybe cover the gstl/gsa breaks.   depending on the store, it just requires payroll for you to get trained officially. those are rare, so just take any shadow oppurtunities."

I helped the gstls with their morning procedure such as shooting exfs and pushing batches. While it did help me with moving up, that stuff is basic sales floor tean member stuff. My advice to you is always try to learn something. Take ownership of something. Help out cashiers with stuff. Spread yourself to other departments and get crosstrained.

Even if it shows one on hand, I don't check. One is as good as zero for most items.  I only walk into the back if it shows a location for the item.  As far as the item on hold - if I have one, and it is on hold, I tell the second person that I don't have any. No sense in making them mad that it is locked in a drawer and I won't sell it to them.  If I've been at work for an hour or more, I know exactly what I have, especially if it's popular, and I don't need to look stuff up. 3DS XL is $50 off right now, only one guest needs to ask for one for me to know how many we have."
Target,2qttvl,pohatu771,14,Tue Dec 30 21:02:32 2014 UTC,"This guy gets it OP, most of these other responses contain a lot of speculation.   A competent team is aware of these high demand items and exactly how many are in the store.  The PDA can say the store has an item, but if it is not on the sales floor and the PDA doesn't show a backroom location then it might as well not be there at all.  sometimes items like that are kept in the back unlocated on purpose when we are saving stock for an upcoming ad. On black friday we had several ps4's and xbox ones ""hidden"" in the back just for the sunday ad."

You're right - if a store shows one, I will rarely tell the customer because it's not usually worth it. We can see the sales for the past eight weeks too, so if a store is showing one in stock but no sales in the past eight weeks...yeah. Our numbers include items on hold and also layaway items too. In regards to a 50% off Nintendo 3DS, I definitely wouldn't bother sending them to a store with only one unless it was the only one in the area showing any at all.  Also, the only reason there would be ""one in the back"" usually, in my experience, is if there's an entire box that hasn't been unpacked. There won't just be one 3DS sitting out there."
Target,2qttvl,emilyrose93,1 point,Sun Jan 4 11:23:27 2015 UTC,"As someone who works for real Target, in a store, there are plenty of times there is one in the back and none on the floor. A lot of sales during one hour can deplete the shelf before CAF pulls replenish the shelf, or the unreliability of CAF in general that sometimes doesn't pull the items that have sold."
Target,2qttvl,pohatu771,14,Sun Jan 4 15:49:18 2015 UTC,"Having been an electronics member for two years, I'm gonna be pretty blunt with saying that if an item like a 3DS was in the back, the system would show it. Items are ""checked in"" to a location and the system would show that if it were in the back that the item was there or not. As for why they didn't go back and visually check, I know that at my store our entire electronics backroom is actually a separate locked up section that you have to get into, and is quite the hassle. I mean, if they knew they didn't have any more, it's just a waste of timr to go check. And in regards to the item on hold, there's just no reason to get someone's hopes up with the ""Well, we have it, but it's on hold for someone else""."
Target,2qttvl,Taco_Baron,3,Tue Dec 30 17:54:45 2014 UTC,"I feel like it opens up a dialogue with the customer you don't really want, too. Like, ""But I'm here NOW, sell it to me instead!"""
Target,2qttvl,emilyrose93,10,Sun Jan 4 11:27:43 2015 UTC,"There is no policy on checking the backroom, but most will not check. Our PDA's tell us how much of something is on the sales floor and how much is in the backroom; moreover, while the sales floor number may be off occasionally due to it taking some time to update when something is sold, the backroom number should always be accurate because the people in the backroom have to update the system when something is taken from the back or if something is brought back. In addition, when you were told about the first Target having one instock, the person that told you may have read the PDA wrong. Occasionally there will be a glitch where the PDA will read an item as having -1 instock and the person may have thought it said 1 instead. In regard to an item being on hold, that item will still be in the system. The only that is done to an item on hold is that it is just set aside up at guest services or back in electronics, and an item can typically only be on hold for one day. Hope this helps."
Target,2qttvl,futureguy51,2,Tue Dec 30 17:37:32 2014 UTC,"Just wanting to clarify the -1 issue: that happens when an item's count is at 0 (by research, double scan, etc) and then you sell another one of that item. When you sell an item it subtracts the number sold from your on-hand count. When your on-hand count is 0 and you sell 1, your count reports -1. When you get more in, the system counts the -1 as a 0 and adds the appropriate number, but until then your count will read as -1."
Target,2qttvl,anyquestions,1 point,Wed Dec 31 03:15:05 2014 UTC,"Thanks. Actually, the very first employee at the first Target showed me that the second Target had -1 stock. Does that glitch happen often? Is it particularly significant?"
Target,2qttvl,rh51too,3,Tue Dec 30 20:47:30 2014 UTC,Certain items do not come on the freight truck from the distribution center. They usually get dropped off by UPS or some other form. Those items have to be checked in before they can be sold. If they do not get checked in and get sold it will subtract a count which is what you saw with the -1 count.
Target,2qttvl,Antije,1 point,Tue Dec 30 23:47:16 2014 UTC,"No and yes. It's not significant to you, just to is. It could mean a return was done wrong and then the item was resold, a misscan at checkout or in the case of my store having -99 of a cd one time, a random stock glitch."
Target,2qttvl,iJeffwuh,6,Tue Dec 30 23:18:25 2014 UTC,"As most people have said. The counts of the PDAs are pretty accurate. Especially with high dollar merchandise.   As for the one DS being on hold and then not telling you, that is normal. If they are on hold, the last thing you want to do is tell a guest that there is one. Some people decide to throw a fit and want to put their name on a list where we can call them when that one doesn't sell or if we get more in. It just creates problems.   When I was in electronics. I would just saw we were all sold out but I would tell the guest to call the next day if they have not found one."
Target,2qttvl,semen_drinker,5,Tue Dec 30 20:59:51 2014 UTC,"I worked at target briefly, though just a cashier but I can tell you the stock they pull up on those PDAs is very accurate from what I've seen. Especially something like electronics. It's not like a 3ds is gonna be picked up and left in the wrong area of the store. They get a set number and they stay in a set location until purchased. Heck even if it somehow was in the wrong location, they would still show that there was one available. It's too big/pricey of an item to just be overlooked you know? As for them not telling you they had one on hold.. I imagine there was no need for you to know that. Wouldn't it be worse to know they had one but someone already put it on hold. It's not like you can buy that one anyways so I don't know why you would have preferred to know that?"

While I may be incrementally more upset by learning that an item exists but that I cannot have it, I would be exponentially more upset if I did not know about the hold, the customer never picked up the item, and I missed my opportunity to be next on the hold list.

This is after I look in the area around where the item should be. As far as I can tell, all of my coworkers also radio the back room when something isn't there. However, if my iPod says it's out of stock in the back room as well, it's up in the air. If it's something I know should be in stock, or that I think should be, I'll still radio the back room, but if I have sufficient reason to believe the iPod, then I'll direct the guest to the nearest store that has it in stock. I've found the iPods to be rather inaccurate at times, especially later in the day. They're correct probably about 8 times out of 10."
Target,2qttvl,bearface93,1 point,Tue Dec 30 19:33:17 2014 UTC,More is sometimes less.   If I'm understanding you right then asking the backroom if we have product is redundant as everyone sees the same thing. Asking backroom sidetracks them from what they're doing (I know it's part of the job) is bothersome especially when the sales floor knows there is no product.
Target,2qttvl,SanltarYNAPkin,1 point,Tue Dec 30 20:56:09 2014 UTC,"I may have worded that wrong. If the iPod says something is in the back room, I radio them. It's sometimes wrong though and says something is back there that isn't."

Target,2qttvl,initialgold,2,Wed Dec 31 02:12:57 2014 UTC,"On checking the back room, I've never actually done that myself.

The employees up front and on the floor (at least all that I know) have no idea how to actually check for things in the back themselves. I think she probably looked at the item, realized what it was, and decided radioing the back room probably wouldn't have been the quickest way to solve the problem and decided to instead radio electronics who know the product they sell quite well."

Target,2qqupq,LemonApples,3,Tue Dec 30 01:32:08 2014 UTC,"We keep requisitions to a minimum. For one, getting REDcards is a part of the job description for cashiers. Once in a while, a game to bring up numbers can be fun and useful, but when you start rewarding people just for doing their job, they stop doing it when the prizes stop coming. Also, it ends up costing the store a lot. So there's that.  But that's not to say we never do. For Christmas we had a tree with little envelopes in it for things like a candy bar, a 12 pack of soda, a $5 DVD, etc. And if you got a REDcard app, you could draw an envelope. We occasionally run a contest where a certain number of apps in a certain period will enter you into a drawing for a larger gift card, like $25 or $30.  In a non-redcard-related scenario though we do also regularly have LODs who will requisition everyone a soda and a snack if we make sales and RC goals for the night. That's always popular and it's nice recognition."

They'll do REDcard requisitions every once in awhile, but that will only depend on how we're doing for the week.  Your first point is exactly why I don't accept rewards like that. It's great to reward people for doing certain things, but if it's part of the job, you shouldn't have to be rewarded unless it's exceptional."

They pretty much put me there after one of our other main Electronics guys left for our local Wal-Mart (I think his father-in-law or girlfriend's dad works there and got him a pretty comfy position) and I eventually became mainly Electronics, but I'm sure they left me there due to me having knowledge in computers in my job application, and being pretty good in Electronics when I covered breaks and lunches back there in my hardlines days.  In terms of knowing what to do, just know that (assuming it's like the store I work at) attachments with big ticket items (HDMI cables with TVs, games/controllers with game consoles, etc) are super important since they supposedly make up a good chunk of sales in Electronics.

Target,2qgqvz,initialgold,3,Fri Dec 26 22:57:10 2014 UTC,Yeah I had a lot of those. Like I had never heard of the Anki car app thing until about a week ago. Older parents or grandparents came up and asked me about a car you control with your smartphone and I had never heard of it lol. Google-ing key words that old people have given me saved me a ton of time with those type of people. Eventually we found Anki and we determined that was it even though they still weren't sure lol
Target,2qgqvz,dubblechzburger,1 point,Fri Dec 26 23:00:22 2014 UTC,That will probably never stop around the holidays. But it should stop after the next week or so until next year.

I ran into this myself where my boss asked me where someone was and found out they left early. Ended up being a bit pissed off. Not a big deal though since you aren't going into compliance or calling out which are worse.  For future, if they have a print out of the daily grid with all the work centers with associated times[not the sheet with breaks and lunches], I'd look at that one. I've ran into an issue in the past where my boss never told me to stay for a  bit longer and when I looked at that sheet before I clocked out, I saw that my end time changed."

Target,2qfd9l,mundler,3,Tue Jan 6 04:51:16 2015 UTC,"GSTL here . Honestly the worst part about the job is communication. At my store we have two GSTLs and its difficult to be on the same page with him since we work opposite schedules add on to lack of communication everywhere else in the store.. Also pushing RedCards.... Its downright horrid. After the breach with us and literally everyone else its tough .. What a headache :(  Best part is actually the one on one with guests and forming some bond with them as well as your team. Best advice I can say is leave a paper trail of all you do, be active in emails and notes as much as possible and be quickly paced with your followup on everything. Also recongize your team. Happy team easy job. Learn how to lead but not like a tyrant, your cashiers can make or break you. Personally me I have Target.com app on my phone and use it like crazy when I can't find dpci or things like that- an amazing tool to use, better then a MyDevice or a PDA.   Feel free to message me if you have any questions about the position. -^"
Target,2qfd9l,LeChiotx,1 point,Sat Dec 27 01:36:46 2014 UTC,"Sounds like some solid advice for sure, thank you so much.

Target,2qfd9l,LeChiotx,1 point,Sat Dec 27 06:19:30 2014 UTC,"Luckily I had a chance as the electronics TL before being a GSTL so I had a bit of a one up. Where as sales flor leader of any sort is harder task wise.... Up front is harder guest and impression wise. When you get the job find at least 3 people(cashiers) who have solid hours and you get along with and mold them into your helpers. I have a lot of cashiers who I've personally taught sales planners, how to use a PDA, how to manage the lanes without me, etc... That way I can step away for a moment or delegate a task to when I get swarmed with something. Its going to be overwhelming at first but it gets a lot better."
Target,2qfd9l,monkeyman80,1 point,Sat Dec 27 07:53:15 2014 UTC,"its an issue but being aware we can keep the team in loop.   you're rarely going to talk to the other tl outside the occasional overlap. gsa's are the best to relay info, email if all else fails. and we do text each other."
Target,2qfd9l,monkeyman80,2,Mon Dec 29 02:38:15 2014 UTC,"it expectations. actual gstl isn't so bad, but depending on store its a very different experience.   got a shitty ge etl? do their work.   got a strict etl/stl you're going to be bitched at a lot for things out of your control.   love friendly guests. love many of our teams."

Target,2q8ltl,Fr0stSoldier,7,Wed Dec 24 02:32:41 2014 UTC,"Its for product that is discontinued that we will not carry anymore. It wants it out of the back room and flexed into an mpg isle so ot has a chance to sell before it goes clearance. If you were to leave the ptm in the batch long enough the product will just get pulled in price change.  As far as stand alone ptm app, say xmas is all mpg and you still have xmas in the backroom located. If not ptm batch was dropped into the task list for xmas then you can go into stand alone ptm and scan the mpg labels and it will then prompt you to drop a batch if there is any product located in the backroom."
Target,2q8ltl,Dobeg,5,Wed Dec 24 03:13:02 2014 UTC,"I know it stands for pre-transition merchandise. Not really sure what the stand alone app does. When pushing PTM you usually want to have a portable printer with you to print labels for merchandise that is either discontinued, overstock or back stock.   It's a no back stock sort of thing, where the department is going to be reset soon. I could be wrong but this is how it was explained to me."
Target,2q8ltl,rh51too,4,Wed Dec 24 02:54:46 2014 UTC,"I don't use the app since I'm backroom. Basically PTM items are not to be backstocked. You make room for it on the shelf so it sells.  Sometimes we also just have them sitting on the line as ""push as needed."" When the sales floor TMs come to push their CAFs, they'll take items off that tub that will fit on the floor and go from there. Generally the rule is the tub has to be empty by closing with the items on the shelf.   During Q4 it's used for seasonal stuff and toys. It's stuff that is going to sell and needs to sell. We don't want to backstock it and pull it again the next hour."

Target,2q300m,Andosphere,4,Mon Dec 22 17:20:46 2014 UTC,this is correct
Target,2q300m,AforAnarchist,3,Mon Dec 22 17:24:18 2014 UTC,Don't they just get progressively higher discounts from there until they sell out?
Target,2q300m,Germerican88,6,Mon Dec 22 20:47:44 2014 UTC,"Yup, they'll jump to 70 and 90% probably by next week, then they'll go salvage.. or we'll just toss it and take the loss by that point. Gotta get ready for all that lovely plastics."
Target,2q300m,Andosphere,6,Mon Dec 22 21:30:39 2014 UTC,Finally the correct answer. But to add to it: candy will not go 90%. It caps at 70% and goes salvage after that. Decorations will go 90% however. The full process all the way to salvage should take 7-10 days after Christmas. The exact dates will vary by store. Happy Candy Eating!!

Target,2pzjnz,dubblechzburger,10,Sun Dec 21 21:50:55 2014 UTC,Same. Back when I worked at Target you literally were not allowed on the sales floor as any role without cashier training first.
Target,2pzjnz,PasswordIsntClop,6,Sun Dec 21 23:34:41 2014 UTC,We were directed not to for seasonal this year.
Target,2pzjnz,AforAnarchist,3,Sun Dec 21 22:04:30 2014 UTC,Gotcha. We definitely dialed down training for seasonal but I guess we didn't completely get rid of it. Before everyone would have a cashier shift their first day so train it but now it's just an hour or so to get the basics down.
Target,2pzjnz,dubblechzburger,1 point,Sun Dec 21 22:32:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that would be a smart thing to do. Your store probably added the hours in for it. I know it wasn't listed on the seasonal learning plans I saw."
Target,2pzjnz,AforAnarchist,3,Sun Dec 21 23:27:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah, at my store, they usually request that new employees wear red and khaki to orientation, then when that is over, they go get on a lane and train for a couple hours.  Doesn't always happen like that, but it's pretty common."
Target,2pzjnz,rumplexx,2,Mon Dec 22 03:06:28 2014 UTC,same here.  the last few hours of orientation day is cashier training.

Target,2pz0ha,Zombie_Bean,6,Sun Dec 21 13:51:34 2014 UTC,Sounds like your manager (SLETL or HLETL?) Is just a dick. Just do what you think is a good job. If you want to change something maybe ask a different manager for zoning tips. If you show them your zone and they say it's fine then tell them your manager is giving you shit for a bad zone.

AP cameras are crazy as well as we have outside people always doing camera work especially back in electronics. AP creates cases on guests every day. They let them rack up their offenses and charges them, they send out summons and everything and trust me they do follow through. Our ETL-AP is constantly going to court to testify. Also people thinking that they will be smart and hit up other stores... NEWS FLASH: WE COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. we are always calling/being called from other stores giving us a heads up when a thief just left their store, what they looked like, what they took, who they are with....... People are stupid...   I've seen so many team members leave in handcuffs for what? Little to nothing compared to a paycheck, a job, a clean background... Not worth it people.  And as sad as it is the #1 thing tms steal at work is.... $5 promotional gift cards.... seriously??? That I don't get... So many people fired for it.... NOT WORTH IT!!!"
Target,2pvdle,LeChiotx,3,Sat Dec 20 09:55:23 2014 UTC,"If you were to say steal one thing, you could probably get away with it. Especially as a customer. But once you start going back, you're going to probably get caught. Which is why it's nearly impossible for a team member to get away with it. You do it once and now you're on camera and they know who you are.   One time this team member before I worked there was stealing and trading in to gamestop. I worked and gamestop at the time and I know when something is stolen. I informed a friend that worked there about this and they said they were on it over there. Then after some position changes and I don't know what else I guess this team member stopped stealing and is actually still employed there. Pretty lucky if you ask me.   I heard of one team member getting busted for stealing right out of the register. 1000s of dollars. What's wrong with people? I also was charged with the task of asking a team member to stop stealing.  That was an awkward conversation.   But my favorite AP story involves a long time. This dude was APs white whale. Again I knew he was stealing because he traded in to gamestop. I would see him at target sometimes and I would see him at gamestop. One day I mentioned it to AP and they were like yeah we know that guy he's actually be arrested at another store.  Anyways fast forward some time I pointed him out as I was leaving once. I heard later that he had a bunch of stuff in his pockets and got scared and dumped it all over the store and left. This guy is an idiot and comes back another time and that's it. They finally busted him. And a bit of his group. And I guess they had pot in their car. These guys could have gotten away with it if they knew when to stop.   I don't know how other stores protect their stuff but there are so many easy games to steal and people bring stolen stuff to gamestop all the time. I feel like if you just watch the value games you're going to catch thieves every week."
Target,2pvdle,FirePowerCR,2,Sat Dec 20 14:30:47 2014 UTC,Idk what store you're talking about but at my store all high dollar merchandise has some kind of merchandise protection on it
Target,2pvdle,Croweslen,2,Sat Dec 20 14:42:02 2014 UTC,Merchandise protection is easily defeated with determination and a small magnet.
Target,2pvdle,LemonApples,2,Sat Dec 20 14:53:30 2014 UTC,Im well aware of that. Have seen it done before. U must be pretty damn determined to break into a showcase tho
Target,2pvdle,Croweslen,1 point,Sat Dec 20 17:37:39 2014 UTC,"Haha, forgot I had you tagged as ""ap buddy"" ( was on mobile earlier). Do you remember there was a group going around the midwest that was actually taking the side of the case off with tools and all. All told they'd be in the store for about 45 minutes, a few different people taking turns working on the case and then standing look out. Pathetic part is they made out in one night with more than I make in a month -__-   But  as to what you said, I never really thought of showcases as merch protection but when I think about it, they're really the best kind lol."

When they were in the stores they were careful, I think there were a lot of times where they'd be half way in and then just abandon it cuz they got spooked. As far as why no one ever called for dest. of property I'm not sure, might not have been able to see/comprehend what they were seeing lol"

Target,2pvdle,dubblechzburger,1 point,Sun Dec 21 06:28:13 2014 UTC,"Yeah a lot of it is. And maybe your store has enough security stuff to cover every single game and box set. But places like target and Walmart often have games without them. Not new games, but like the 20 dollar games. Also I'm sure some thieves have magnet keys of their own. I haven't quite been able to figure out where they are getting the new games they steal from. They never have the cases though. So my guess they are cutting them out of the case somewhere. Maybe it's easier to stuff discs in their pockets."

Another one was stealing things from Food Ave that worked there, a girl in charge of cosmetics stole make up.  GSA that closes would crumble up large bills from the register and sneak them in her pockets/shirt.  Worst one was I had someone in my store that was fired for changing the price of an iPod from $199.99 to $19.99.

Target,2pk53j,seattlantis,4,Thu Dec 18 00:45:02 2014 UTC,"I'd just keep calling out. There are days in electronics where I know I'm literally the only one in the store at that moment who knows it but I call for backup anyways since it looks better to the guests. It make you/I look better at least rather than not calling at all.  As far as heavy stuff goes, if no one is courteous enough/or able to help you out I wouldn't risk hurting yourself to do it. Can always roll bikes to the back and if anyone asks say you asked for assistance.  Hopefully it was just a busy day so no one could respond and it doesn't become norm! I know this past weekend we had every person except the areas of the floor that don't respond to backups on the lanes so they were no salesfloor people for like 20-30 minutes."

Target,2pj9pc,MiliTerry,7,Wed Dec 17 02:20:09 2014 UTC,"Former Target Team Member, Former Target Mobile TL and I currently work for a major carrier.   Target Mobile is kinda all over the place. The major problem they are facing is some Targets are using the mobile guys as free labor.  It's great to help out with Target where you can, but I've seen some scenarios where there is no electronics team member and the Target Mobile rep is ringing people out for video games.  It's a conflict of interest.   Secondly none of the major carriers take Target Mobile seriously for this reason. On average Best Buy and Walmart average over 300 activations a month. The top selling Targets will do less than half of that in a good month.  When the account executives from ATT Verizon and Sprint go in and need to discuss what's going on and every 2 minutes the Target Mobile runs off to price check a TV they lose more and more credibility.    Why is that important? Target Mobile isn't allowed to offer some of the option that you can get at Best Buy or a Corporate Store because they don't think that ALL of the people there are capable of handling phone financing and leases.  The reason Radio Shack employees weren't  allowed on the registers is because it eliminated any potential pressure from Target to have them do Target work.  We had some of our best sales people roved from Target because they didn't want to run around looking for DVDs.  When we launched, we were told we could be terminated for doing things that were not related to Mobile now it seems you will be terminated for the opposite.   The POA is absolutely garbage. It severely limits what you can do and 90 percent of the time it doesn't work.   Target views it's mobile sales as a stock portfolio. New lines are high risk / high reward. Upgrades low risk low reward. Target doesn't want more than 15%of their monthly portfolio to be new lines. That is why so many people applying for new lines are turned down.   Target is trying to dumb down this process so anyone with minimal training can clerk out a phone, unfortunately that isn't the direction the mobile market is moving."
Target,2pj9pc,kapt_so_krunchy,1 point,Wed Dec 17 14:47:09 2014 UTC,"Thank you for taking your time to respond to this inquiry. I must say, the Mobile market is only getting more complicated as it moves forward. I have 8+ years in the market, and I am glad that I worked for one of the best for that time. they taught me a lot, and it allows me to speak to Guests on all levels. Some are more advanced than I can handle, but I am always willing to learn something new.   As for the Electronics key and the magnet, I am only one of 2 stores that actually have that permission. I would hate having to tell me hundreds of times a day that I couldn't assist them because all I do is phones. What a waste of a day that would be. We sell a decent amount of phones monthly, and in addition to the phones, I sell TV's and portable music players because I can actually speak to the product first hand. I would feel useless with just the training, but since I own the devices (bose, samsung, and play stations), its an easy transition. Now, they ask about GoPros and Fitbits, and all I can say is ""lemme get a TM for you with more knowledge"". I have no need for them, so I care not to learn about them. I do care about the store, and I do care about the overall sales. I am a numbers guy. I know we're a low volume store, but I always have a this feeling that with my expertise, I can drive those numbers into ""A"" store status haha. I consider this place to be my home away from home, and so  I am willing to do anything to keep it clean and organized. I get enough sales to justify my presence, and anything in addition only helps my growth via word of mouth.  I have figured out quickly how to identify fraudsters. They irk the hell out of me. I treat them all the same, but I really hate liars and thieves.That is the only part of the job I can say I don't enjoy."
Target,2pj9pc,YoungChoppa,5,Wed Dec 17 22:04:31 2014 UTC,The target mobile peeps at my store are awesome they're seen as team members even tho technically they're not. The funny thing is after they were dropped by RadioShack and picked up by the new company they lost their discounts but it seems like they do more actual Target work now.
Target,2pj9pc,HLTL,3,Wed Dec 17 02:53:20 2014 UTC,"Thanks for that share. Yeah, my store allows us to have that Electronics key, so I can help with EVERYTHING!! And I do. I know we're a huge asset"
Target,2pj9pc,pohatu771,1 point,Wed Dec 17 03:07:33 2014 UTC,"Mine are the same way.   It's great having Target Mobile around. They're willing to help us when and if they're available to, but I definitely strive to not overuse them since they're not employed with Target. They have their set of keys and a lot of times -- especially with the holiday season -- they'll have a set of our own keys with them.   It's only a tad frustrating when they're not around when a guest wants to purchase a pre-paid cell phone since a majority of our guests are buying temporary phones, because we have to make up for that accessory loss.  They're definitely useful though since their transactions don't count toward the accessory sales. They can sell as many cores as they want without accessories and it doesn't count against us for AAR."
Target,2pj9pc,definiteangel,3,Tue Dec 23 07:12:29 2014 UTC,"As a Rochester team member, we probably know each other, or at least worked together once.  In my time with Target, we have had 20 Target Mobile reps. A lot of them were fired for whatever reason, but a lot of them were just jerks all the time, between how they interacted with team members, lying to guests, or just general laziness. One intentionally knocked a stack of movies out of my hands once as I walked by.  I appreciate the reps who are helpful, friendly, and and knowledgeable, but too many of those 20 have done more harm than good."

I treat every guest like they're family. Sometimes I even push them to better prices at stores that we can't price match (because honesty is what counts). I have worked at the Victor, Webster,  Irondequoit and Penfield stores.  Only one that I haven't is in Henrietta. Maybe one day."

Target,2pj9pc,GOforTPS,2,Wed Dec 17 07:19:45 2014 UTC,"I wanted to ask you, and as you said before, it IS your two cents. Well, here is mine. I find that Target has THE best deals around. And, since were not there to push a sale, it makes the guest feel more welcome. You indicated that plans were all jacked up, and I am sorry. However, there is a 14 day NO HASSLE, NO RESTOCK FEE return policy. In that 14 days, the guest has the ability to review all the changes that were made, and if something wasn't done correctly, fix it before its too late. I agree, mistakes are made. I have made them a few times, but I HAVE never repeated them.  We give the Guest, including your wife, a printout after the whole transaction is completed. In addition to the printout, the computer screen is available for you to view during the whole process. I always ask my guest to watch me during the whole process(most don't) so that they can bring up any questions that may arise. I also point to the fact that I am keeping the plan the same, by touching the screen where it says ""keep existing plan"".  That way they know that on Target Mobiles end, our intent is always good. But Why did't they address this concern within the 14 days??I really am sorry about your bad experiences, and I seeing that our deals are some of the best in the market, I hope you can find a rep you can feel confident with and come back to us."

Target,2pjrg1,dubblechzburger,1 point,Thu Dec 18 20:41:59 2014 UTC,"Shit happens. There are some guests who are just determined to be asshats. We have one guy who comes in rather frequently (once a week or so) and he's just a huge dick. He called me on the Monday before Black Friday and wanted to hold a couple blu-rays. It was well before the sale so I told him fine but only for 24 hours which he argued and argued since he wanted to get them Wednesday morning. I met him in the middle and told him I'd keep them down there but they'd be fair game if anyone wanted them after the 24 hours. He then starts asking me saying he heard they're going to be on sale Wednesday or Friday (I knew Friday but I hadn't seen the early bird ad so I had no idea) so I told him I didn't have any knowledge of the sales but if they were on sale they'd be that price.  So Wednesday morning comes and I'm with a couple lady's getting them iPads since they were an early deal and my electronics partner gets stuck with him. He is furious that they're not ringing up on sale and was claiming I confirmed they were supposed to be on sale. I told him that's not what I said and he tells me to shut up since I already provided poor service Monday by refusing to hold items for him, another false statement. When my co-worker goes to the tablets to look up the sale he walks right through the group of ladies I was helping. Not literally pushing but he definitely bumped them out of the way. Not on there, he's freaking out, GSTL comes over since LOD was on a call and he just starts spewing the same crap if not worse, claiming how I wouldn't help at all and was focusing on the iPad ladies and when the GSTL said screw it and matched it just to get him out he was complaining about how he should get something extra since we were ""rude"" to him and how he doesn't understand why he's always treated so poorly at Target. I had to refrain so hard from saying well maybe if you weren't a dick you'd get treated better.  Apparently he's like this at Walgreens too! Our greeting card vendor said she's been doing cards in Walgreens and he was there and whenever he shows up, all the employees avoid him and go to the back since he's apparently worse there. So there are some guests that are just going to be asses no matter what you do. As long as you're not the one causing it you're fine."

Target,2pg8s5,CoachCosta,2,Tue Dec 16 08:07:24 2014 UTC,"I would talk to an LOD. If it's a family emergency/issue then they might be more lenient about it. Better to have someone take your shift than to call out and leave everyone short handed. I'm not sure if your ETL's (or any for that matter) would see eye to eye with me, but it's worth a shot.   I think if you don't pull this constantly then you'll be fine."

Target,2pg8s5,FenrirSM,1 point,Wed Dec 17 20:49:57 2014 UTC,"If it's the only time you called out, you wouldn't be fired immediately, and it may not completely kill your chances of staying on. But you also gotta realize that unless you're an otherwise perfect employee, and the competition from other seasonal employees isn't fierce, the amount it hurts your cause to stay on past January is likely more than you can afford."

Target,2p9pvo,colebs105,6,Sun Dec 14 16:34:37 2014 UTC,"Market is, personally, my favorite area of the store.   If you're pushing from the rooms, just make sure you push in the same order the backroom pulls in so you can keep up with them.   If you're pushing frozen items, I find it best to have one cart (or top of a three teir) for bread, sweets, and Hawaiian rolls etc. Make sure you date them properly, the yellow price tags on the locations have a shelf life day number. Usually MP and AF brand bread lasts for 5 days. Just fate everything properly. Super easy. Use your other cart (or second shelf in the three teir) for frozen stuff like pies, cool whip, meat, frozen meals etc.   Dairy is super easy, but always push milk from the coolers so the latest date stays in the back.   Ambient room is always really quick, no sweat.   Meat room is usually fast, just make sure all the dates are good. If somethings gonna expire today, tomorrow or obviously yesterday, QMOS it. Also, if it's going bad in two days, Mark them down in price with discount stickers.   Produce is straightforward. Just don't put any fruit or veggies out that you, yourself wouldn't buy. If you find a tomato that's a little squishy, get rid of it. Target prides itself on its health inspection grades... At least mine does. Always keep an eye on the strawberries for mold. They die fast...   Finally, make sure you back stock things as compressed as possible. It sucks when there's all these carts and tubs in the rooms taking up space.   If you ever find yourself without work in market, just take some time to look through the quality of the items and get rid of anything damaged.   Also, be sure to date certain meats and weigh the ribs.   Overall, market is super duper easy and it's really fun. Keeps you really busy and the day goes by quickly. Enjoy!"
Target,2p9pvo,irishdanmurphy,2,Mon Dec 15 10:46:42 2014 UTC,Is it a mid shift I'm assuming? You need to keep up with the pulls coming out of the coolers and freezers most likely and work on culling and tidying the pfresh area to keep it presentable. Normally there will be a bit of overlap in people working in consumables so you should just be able to ask the person there before you what you should focus on. Another good idea would be to have a small chat with the consumables TL to see what s/he expects of you during your shift!
Target,2p9pvo,Antije,2,Sun Dec 14 17:05:16 2014 UTC,"Market is pretty much the same as the rest of the sales floor with a few added rules. Make sure to check dates/FIFO, get product to its appropriate temp zone within 30 mins, and watch for cross-contamination. Chicken below everything then pork/ground beef, steak/beef and then ready-to-eat above all raw meat.  As far as what you will be doing depends on the shift you're scheduled. I would talk to either the CTL or just one of the TMs that work market to figure out what to expect."
Target,2p9pvo,rykerman33,1 point,Sun Dec 14 17:21:25 2014 UTC,"What time is your shift? That definitely changes what you'll be doing a bit. :) If it's at 6am, it will probably be training to learn the routines for cleaning, F&F by 9 or 4 (or 8 in some stores I know), ordering, etc. If it's midday you will probably be doing a lot of the dry CAF pulls (they should be on the front of the line, you shouldn't have to pull them).   If it's closing you should have had training by then if you're on your own, but that has its own routines. Fresh and full by 4, some cleaning usually, finishing dry pulls, zoning dry market + water wall, and culling out bakery and meat with a best by date of the next day. Market is always busy, so it's a fast shift for sure!"

Target,2p9olg,ra600,2,Sun Dec 14 16:37:23 2014 UTC,"I recommend following the pathing that your backroom is set up in. Start from one end, look at the fill group at the end of the isle, scroll to that fill group (if it dropped in the autofills) in the PDA and pull it. The back rooms (I've been in a couple different ones myself) are generally set up in a similar order to the store layout. If you want to be extra fast and reduce walking time. Just stage your pulls somewhere near you instead of staging them on the line on receiving side.   Also, to answer your question about bath towels, there is a fill group called BATH that they will appear under. Pillows and comforters will be in BED, frames might be in DOM, I can't remember off the top of my head right now. I recommend just asking questions if you need help instead of assuming anything. Backroom integrity is really paramount."

Target,2p93ei,diilemmaz,1 point,Wed Dec 17 19:41:40 2014 UTC,"They don't have to take the break only under certain  circumstances. As it says in the article you posted, "" There are also some instances where only one person is on duty or is the only person performing a specific job duty. In those situations it may be acceptable for the employee to eat on the job without being relieved (in which case the employee needs to be paid for that time)."" which in the retail world, a situation that will almost never arise. NY labor laws state a employee MUST have an uninterrupted lunch break with a certain amount of hours worked.  http://labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/faq.shtm#8  Only under certain circumstances is an employee 'permitted' to take a working lunch break, with a hand written agreement to the employer subject to the approval of NY labor  Edit: The New York State Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, held that, in a situation where there was a collective bargaining agreement that provided for a waiver of statutory meal periods in exchange for additional breaks and meal periods scheduled at other times, employees may waive their rights under the Labor Law. Such waivers must include the following:  The operational needs of the industry make strict compliance with the meal period provisions impractical  The waiver was obtained openly and knowingly, absent of duress or coercion, through good faith negotiations etc etc cont:  from NY labor laws documentation on meals and breaks."

Target,2p93ei,NIGGER_DEATH_TURBO,1 point,Sun Dec 14 23:47:59 2014 UTC,Florida doesn't require breaks be given to any employees.

Target,2p6vmf,FirePowerCR,4,Sat Dec 13 20:52:01 2014 UTC,I don't think so. I mean it's not like you skipped shifts on purpose. I changed my availability once and I got scheduled days I couldn't come in. I didn't come in those days but they knew why I wasn't coming in. It's not your fault someone else messed up.

Target,2p6vmf,k929,3,Sat Dec 13 22:08:58 2014 UTC,"I'm the same case. I was on LOA starting in August. I wasn't supposed to return until mid December. I decided to come back and workThanksgiving week and they were cool with it, knowing fully well that I would only work those 7 days. Since I was on LOA I was unavailable to schedule, so they put me in under someone who I work with who wasn't working that week. When I went to clock in, I had to have the LOD approve it. But after that my ETL-HR talked to me and said that I was reactivated in the system, allowing me to be scheduled and back from LOA. I believe this is the same case for you and since you were made available to schedule, someone probably just made the mistake of adding you to the schedule. Odd though that they didn't call you after you missed shifts to see what was up. My store will call me if I'm not there within the allotted 2 hours of no call no show. Best of luck to you!"

If you know you're going to be away on those, try to get someone to fill in those shifts. If you do that, there should be no issues. So long as you don't just disappear and you communicate with your ETLs, they should be accommodating on the subject, and it won't negatively effect you.  That being said, there are two things I want to point out; first, those dates are really auspiciously unfortunate. I'm sure many ETLs will look at it and say ""THOSE specific days?"" It's gonna leave a bitter taste. Make sure you get documentation of the memorial service, just to cover your bases.  The other thing is that seasonal doesn't last until March. It lasts until the store doesn't need you, which is usually early January."

Look up questions you can't answer, either using a myDevice iPod, the electronics iPad, or your own phone. Feel empowered to help a guest research what they're buying. That's what the Vibe, and guest relations in general, is all about. The iPods also have IGN and Fandango apps pre-installed to offer games or movie recommendations.  Step 4: Practice, practice, practice. Sure, there are those team members in electronics who got the job because they're hobbyists, and passionate about the items they're selling. But given enough time working in the area, you'll catch on to some general patterns. Take a moment during downtime to check out the products on the shelf, or in the abandons basket if you're putting things away. Look around at new revisions as they go up, and see what's changed.  Step 5: 1-877-MY TGT TECH. That's the number for Target tech support. It's free, and they don't care about if you've already bought something from Target. They're able to help answer those questions you may not know, and more once a guest gets home with something new.   Source: Team trainer for electronics. Hope this helps!"
Target,2ooos1,effervescence,2,Mon Dec 8 22:24:47 2014 UTC,"This guy brings good points. Only thing I was very knowledgeable in was video games. Knew a decent amount about TVs because of that and had general knowledge on routers, music speakers, etc. But I didn't know jack shit about cameras. But I learned. I worked with a guy who knew a lot so I listened to what he said when it was slow and gained a lot of knowledge. I looked up some info on them and learned a decent amount. If someone comes in with more advanced questions, that's where my line is drawn, but I can now accurately sell someone a camera based on what they're going to use it for/need whereas before, I never would've imagined."
Target,2ooos1,dubblechzburger,1 point,Tue Dec 9 04:42:56 2014 UTC,"I've been electronics for a little over a year and a half now and still don't know shit about cameras.

Target,2ooos1,gordogg24p,1 point,Wed Dec 10 06:39:25 2014 UTC,"Yeah that's still a bit nerve wracking for me. I honestly just looked them over, memorized that basic stuff like the megapixels, screen size, show em if it has a swivel screen or not. Some have wifi so I'll memorize that. A lot of times what I'll do is come outside where they are and ""show them"" it. That way you can see it as you're pointing it out and it doesn't necessarily look like your picking it up to read it.   At that point you can get an idea if they are advanced users or not really. If they start asking more advanced questions I know they know more then me generally and I tell them photography has never been a passion (or interest for that matter) apologize and offer to look it up. I'll say I remember seeing it once but don't want to try to remember the wrong thing and tell them that if it's wrong. Most people appreciate that. You'll get occasional snobby people that will be all ""hmph you apparently aren't knowledgeable I'm going to best buy"" but I'm not too disappointed when they leave. Those people are generally jerks lol"
Target,2ooos1,dubblechzburger,1 point,Wed Dec 10 18:03:51 2014 UTC,"After 4 years of being the electronics brand TM, nothing really worries anymore. I'll read the box or the sign. Or break out my cell phone and do research for them. I do this a lot during the holidays. Mostly for checking target.com. we're a low volume store so I'm in charge if running entertainment as well. Nothing like trying to do the entire E and E workload during the holiday season.  Edit: to offer some advice though; don't be afraid to go the extra mile for the guest. At the very least, they'll appreciate the effort."

Target,2ooos1,dubblechzburger,1 point,Tue Dec 9 03:35:32 2014 UTC,"I'm so sorry. My AP guys are totally cool so I always try to think of them when doing electronics stuff. Would this make life easier for AP? Like today, noticed a TV wasn't located. Said 2 on hand but no backroom or sales floor locations on hand. Could've assumed they'd notice it but figured might as well give them the heads up just incase."
Target,2ooos1,LemonApples,1 point,Tue Dec 9 04:45:36 2014 UTC,"It would probably help more than just AP if you let someone know. Only reason AP would be looking for it is if they happen to be counting that particular model or noticed it just chilling out of place. Also, the second unit might be a display?   But in the end, it really just makes it easier for you and the flow team. As AP, when it comes to merchandise protection the only thing we're responsible for is documenting incidents involving spiderwraps and following up, it's on the flow team/back room team to get it done or whoever is pushing it. That being said, if there's a large portion of it undone, I'll usually compromise with whoever is left from the morning or working electronics and we'll knock it out together. I see it as building a rapport with them, there's a reason it didn't get done in the first place (usually lack of time), so the random guy they hardly ever see just barking orders at them is kinda shitty so I usually pitch in and help out"
Target,2ooos1,FenrirSM,1 point,Tue Dec 9 11:42:47 2014 UTC,"I just wish the people in my store wouldn't wind the spider wraps up so tight you can't undo them, or create rats' nests with them because they're too lazy to put them up properly."
Target,2ooos1,LemonApples,1 point,Tue Dec 9 18:17:43 2014 UTC,"I understand about the rats nest... But I've found unless their tightened as much as possible, someone will finagle it off given enough time. I'm one of those people you hate.

Target,2ooos1,FenrirSM,1 point,Tue Dec 9 21:27:08 2014 UTC,"I mean tightening it when it isn't actually applied to anything, to the point you can't open it so that you can actually USE it on product. By all means, put it on the product properly!"
Target,2ooos1,LemonApples,1 point,Wed Dec 10 02:35:18 2014 UTC,"Ohhh, well in that case I completely agree. I especially hate when I get a random old style one that locks differently and someone tightened it all the way and I can't find another one to unlock it -__-"
Target,2ooos1,lemonbee,3,Wed Dec 10 02:44:08 2014 UTC,"Recognize the most common questions you'll get asked, and memorize the answers. The most common question I get is, ""What's the difference between the iPad and this Samsung thing?"" After hearing it so often, I sat down, did the research, and actually used the display tablets we had in store. It went a long way toward helping me sell each of the products.   Know what's on ad. It really helps sales when you know what discounts and gift cards are being offered with your products and gives you an opportunity to sell attachments as well. Get the guest excited about saving money and it will make them want to spend on other things.  Don't be intimidated when you don't know the answer to a question. Like others have said, the guest will appreciate you taking time to look it up (especially older folks who may not be familiar with using the internet). It's much better than lying to them. I've seen incidents where a TM lied to a guest about something just to make a sale and the guest came back infuriated and wanting to return everything.   One of the biggest problems I've noticed with newer people or cashiers selling electronics is a lack of knowledge about how the service plans work. Read them, familiarize yourself with them, make sure the guest knows they have to call the number to use the plan. This will help out your guest service TMs who really don't want to explain for the thousandth time that returning the item to the store is not the same as using the plan.   As far as games go, it helps to check out the rating on the game and make sure the guest knows why it's rated that way, especially if the game is for a young kid or teen. I often have parents come back wanting to return a game because they didn't know it had violence/sex/swearing/etc, but they've already opened it and we can't do anything from there.   Keep an eye on suspicious characters and communicate with AP. I can't stress this enough. When you unlock a case for a guest and take an item out, the guest might try to take it from your hand to read about it. Some guests will get angry if you tell them no, and this is a big red flag. You should also look out for people who use multiple credit cards or checks to pay for big ticket items. If they say they have to go get another card from the car but they'll be back, take the opportunity to call AP over and have them watch the transaction. If the guest gets angry, it's a good indicator that they're doing something shady. You'll start to notice behavior that might make you suspicious, and calling this behavior out to AP is an excellent way to prevent theft.  Finally, don't be intimidated! There's a lot to learn, but you're already taking the initiative by asking how to be better."
Target,2ooos1,IronOreAgate,2,Tue Dec 9 01:21:45 2014 UTC,"The best way I have for pushing attachments was to ask the guest if they needed anything else, but always list off things they might need.  Example, instead of:   Do you need anything else?   I go:   Did you need any HDMI cables, power strips, or surge protectors?    I started doing this and my scores saw amazing improvement. I always find that using this method isn't pushy, but covers everything the LODs want you to say."
Target,2ooos1,flyboyzf4u,2,Tue Dec 9 00:02:33 2014 UTC,"Read the box literally read the box to them and they will think you are a wiz with the item,  don't be afraid to say hold on let me google that,  talk to electronics guys about stuff you don't know a lot about be good,  research at home,  get good with tvs,  they take alot of time and are pretty easy to learn about and let the electronics guy handle the hard stuff and if nothing else just someone to work the POS is a great help"

Some may see it as ""punishment""; but the way I look at it is time for a GSA/GSTL to dedicate on projects in that area. Yes, our main responsibility is leading the front end; but a GSTL working a mid at Guest Service can help with branding up supply closets, ordering needed supplies, covering breaks for everyone, etc. Same with being scheduled as a cashier."

Educational LOAs are for your education - breaks from school no longer are a time of education, so yes you are expected to work when you aren't in school.  If you won't be in town due to an educational reason then they may work with you on that, but if it is for family/social reasons you would probably be let go.  The other reason I was given was that there is only a certain amount of time that you can go without working while on LOA before you are let go - this might be why you are required to work on breaks as well.  I could be wrong, but I believe that is what I was told at the time."

I remember when I was going to go to electronics they told me I was going to get extra and it never happened after like 4 shifts. I didn't stay in electronics though so maybe that's why it never adjusted. But I questioned it a few times and didn't get a real answer. You should find a hotline to call, because no one in the store is going to make this happen quickly if they haven't already.  You should look at your pay stub to get your exact rate."

Target,2od7tr,monkeyman80,7,Sun Dec 7 05:44:01 2014 UTC,"My personal best is 23 in one day.    I never say the word ""credit"" until the end or unless I am asked.  I dont hide it.  But I dont push trigger words like ""apply"", ""credit"", and ""approval""."
Target,2od7tr,StlStitch,0,Fri Dec 5 22:23:40 2014 UTC,"Isn't that unethical? Shouldn't people know what they're signing up for? It isn't JUST a loyalty card, it is a credit card. Credit cards can have serious effects on someone's ability to get a mortgage or loan down the road. No duh it is easier to get people to sign up for a credit card when they don't know it's a credit card."
Target,2od7tr,nerhe,8,Sat Dec 6 04:18:51 2014 UTC,"Its not about hiding the credit card aspect, for there is also a debit card. I usually talk up the savings first and recommend the debit card, but if they don't have a check I will offer the credit card. It is much more effective than putting the credit card up front."
Target,2od7tr,Macasaurus,1 point,Sat Dec 6 05:40:39 2014 UTC,yeah most people assume credit card and shut you down. move on and they're like its like the debit card i'm already using but you save 5%?
Target,2od7tr,monkeyman80,1 point,Sun Dec 7 05:40:30 2014 UTC,It is not unethical if I openly answer the guest question about it being a credit card.  And I do use those key words but. Not til the end.  I avoid them in the beginning because...  as a trigger word it shuts people down to your pitch.  We have a job to make sales.  Thats in our job description.  And outlined in your training (depending on how good your trainer is) is that getting guests to sign up for a red card is part of your job expectations.  More sales = more payroll = more hours for you to work (If you want them).  Less sales = less payroll = less hours.  Which means more people bitching about not having enough time on the schedule to work and make money.
Target,2od7tr,StlStitch,-3,Sat Dec 6 10:50:23 2014 UTC,"So just because it benefits you, that means it's okay to hide certain aspects of the card? You shouldn't hide that it is a credit card until the end either. People need to know what they're signing up for before they sign up for it.  It is NOT in the job description to sell Redcards, just to be clear. Please point to where selling redcards is in the responsibilities of team members. Yes, supervisors push us to sell it, but according to the responsibilities of team members, it is not required."
Target,2od7tr,nerhe,1 point,Sun Dec 7 00:21:57 2014 UTC,"It is a part of the job description.  Selling assets of the company.    Im not a huge fan of spot.  I think a lot of the corporate decisions are shit.  But at the end of the day, they are paying me to do a job.  A job that they include in our responsibilities; getting guests to apply for red cards.  You may not like what they require of you as a team member.  And you dont have to work there if you dont like what they require.  But its part of your job to upsell everything; including redcards.  Some people are better salesmen then others.  I dont fault anyone who isnt good at selling them.  But if you refuse to put in effort, then how does that represent your work ethic in general?  I dont like pushing/selling them.  But better scores/metrics means I get better reviews.  Which leads to better raises.  And makes me more valuable to the company than the person who only is there to collect a check.  I do what I have to, in order to protect my job and make money to pay my bills.  No job means living on the street.  And I cant afford that."
Target,2od7tr,StlStitch,0,Sun Dec 7 01:09:20 2014 UTC,"Where is that part of the job description? Please show me where in the ACTUAL job description you were given at hire date where it said that redcard conversion was part of your job description.  I honestly liked having people sign up for the redcard, but didn't force it upon them or hide what they were applying for. I didn't have any trouble selling it either, but then again, I was just really good at pitching the debit card, and then if people didn't have a blank check with them I told them they could get the same savings with the credit card. no lying or hiding aspects of the card."
Target,2od7tr,nerhe,2,Mon Dec 8 01:56:44 2014 UTC,I absolutely dread cash shifts because of the fact I have to ask people for RED cards...I just hate doing it. 75% of the people plain say No without consideration. The other 24% say they will another time. Then the odd 1% applies and I get the red card every so often. I don't know how you guys do it so easily....good luck this quarter!

I usually have 10 per week in 25 hours.  My trick is repetition, I make sure each guest hears my offer as many times as possible while in my line. Also, I try to connect with my guests. If they buy bacon-wrapped fillets, I give them a cooking tip. I joke a lot to make them smile.  My conversion rate is normally double the 3.5% they're looking for."
Target,2ocgkd,targetinquirer,3,Fri Dec 5 07:33:26 2014 UTC,"With my store, we will be telling the seasonal people yea or nay the first week of January. It may be different at other stores depending on volume and payroll.  There are two letters that will be handed out in person, one on one - ""thanks for your help, we do not have a position for you at this time, you are welcome to reapply next season, etc."" or ""thanks for your help, we would like to offer you a permanent position in ______, please let us know your decision by (date)"".  Essentially all the ETLs and TLs get together to kind of decide who to keep and how many we can keep is based on business needs. We talk about work ethic, how well you learn new things, attendance, attitude and conversion/attachment rates if applicable."
Target,2ocgkd,aoutrance,2,Fri Dec 5 08:39:39 2014 UTC,"You'll probably figure it out before you get your letter if they aren't keeping you; you won't be on the newest schedule. If you want to stick around, make sure you're always moving, always working, always on time and in attendance, and have a good attitude. Also, be competent. That can't be understated."
Target,2ocgkd,FenrirSM,3,Fri Dec 5 11:47:12 2014 UTC,"It will be a one-on-one conversation. It's unfortunate, but going into the fourth quarter they know exactly how many seasonal full time offers they can make in January well ahead of time. How it was done when I was an ETL was during one of the ETL meetings. We'd go through each name and talk about them for a bit knowing what openings we have and their strengths. We'd often pull in the TLs that may have worked closer with them to see what they thought. Obviously any coachings or attendance issues would not help in that situation."
Target,2ocgkd,jyank,2,Fri Dec 5 19:02:03 2014 UTC,"1) Most likely, if they let you go, they'll talk to you individually. At least at my store, they try to make stuff like that as non-embarrassing as possible.  2) Generally, it's based on the effort they observe you putting in. Management at my store likes me because I am always doing something when I am at work, and I always try my best to make it about the guests, give them a positive experience, and get them to come back.   Also, if you want to know management's opinion on your speed and effectiveness, ask your team lead. You will learn their opinion and surprise them by going ""above and beyond"" what they expect of you.

Target,2obbkt,monkeyman80,3,Fri Dec 5 14:35:31 2014 UTC,Thanks! I appreciate it.  My biggest concern is that I will immediately be hated by some of the workers because I'm immediately a GSA that isn't trained with anything.  Is there anything I can do to not be hated by the team members?
Target,2obbkt,Bab5crusade,1 point,Fri Dec 5 01:04:35 2014 UTC,Cool! Thanks!
Target,2obbkt,monkeyman80,4,Fri Dec 5 01:07:59 2014 UTC,"Be friendly. Recognize hard work. If you see a cashier struggling with any particular transaction, smile and see if they need any assistance. If guests are being blatantly rude for no reason; know how to vibe it up and calm them down.  GSA is a tough shtick. You're a Team Lead without the pay and less paperwork. You'll probably get walked over and a few angry people... but it's awesome leadership development. Be a role model for the cashiers and back them up when they need it.  Our last outside hire lasted all of three shifts before she stopped showing up, and that was before Q4 even started.  If you need any advice, feel free to ask here or PM myself... I've been a GSA for about 8 months and a constant Top Performer for the sales floor and Electronics for four years before that. I fancy I know a bit about the job =P"
Target,2obbkt,initialgold,3,Fri Dec 5 01:20:56 2014 UTC,"this was my biggest concern. I was also hired directly for GSA, and when I walked in to wait for orientation one of the current GSAs expressed excitement to see me (because we were short on them forever) and also remarked about how interesting it was to see them do an external hire for GSA. I hadn't realized it was a position that's usually promoted from within, so then I worried about animosity from people who wanted the promotion and didn't get it.  at first there was, a little bit, and people tended to look down on me as a newbie for a while. the advice below is really the best; make sure you're listening to your team and showing that you're eager to work with them and get to know them. they know you'll have a lot to learn; try to learn from them, they are really your best resource since they're out there doing it every day. it'll also keep them from feeling like you think you're 'better' than them somehow. once I'd been at my store about a month and my team realized I'm friendly, quick to learn, on their side, and willing to listen and treat them like equals, they started respecting me a lot more.  also, this time of year there are still a lot of seasonal cashiers around. they are all still very new also, so they won't have any preconceived notions. that's something that helped me also, working with newbies who knew even less than me helped me develop my training and leadership skills, so I was more confident addressing the veterans as more of a leader. which is important, because otherwise some of the less friendly vets tried to walk all over me at first.  bit more rambly than I meant to get with that but tl;dr, I can relate, just be confident and trust/learn from your team and you'll do fine."

Target,2o8o7h,cyan1113,2,Thu Dec 4 15:14:20 2014 UTC,"Viper is the pilot system they are testing at a few stores. Hailed as a way to improve guest service it will end up backfiring due to cut payroll. It merges flow,backroom, sales floor, trash,backup cashier and whatever outs/ research was before. They have ventured far into the realm of impossible with their expectations but all my Tl's hide any problems with it to make themselves look good so i guess it may roll out to all."
Target,2o8o7h,cyan1113,2,Fri Dec 5 21:50:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's kinda like that at our store. People usually do their own thing, but if one area needs help, people get called over. It's just permanent allocation, everyone on flow knows how to back-stock and most can cashier and do hardlines. i know i can, but then again, I started as a cashier.

Also, as backroom TM's, we can safely reset the accumulator on that stuff if it truly is backstock. And for a third point, if we see a large amount of challenge that actually fits out, we can tell our ETL so they can work with tat flow TM."
Target,2o8o7h,DoomedJanissary,2,Fri Dec 5 17:20:44 2014 UTC,Our backroom challenges things that come to the backroom within a day or two of us sending it out as a pull. We need to stop. We keep coming back with more than we took out. All in the wrong spot. Our flow team is crap.

When you think about it, retailers are just a middle man. They don't create anything. They just exist to get one person's products to another. And there are so many levels to the system to make this middle man operation work successfully. It doesn't work without all of the levels working together. But it seems of late, the only moves the highest level makes are to figure out how to make the lowest level do more for less. If you keep kicking out the support beams of your building, eventually it's going to collapse.  I don't know I guess we'll see what happens."
Target,2o541w,FirePowerCR,4,Wed Dec 3 19:02:02 2014 UTC,"That's the thing though, they are able to keep on kicking out the support beams from their building because more will come and take their place. Retail jobs are generally seen as ""entry-level"" jobs and thus cater to two big groups of people: primarily the groups that can't afford to NOT work no matter how shitty the job may be or those who can't find work anywhere else due to some other factor such as lack of experience. As long as the support beams keep coming back, management will keep on knocking them down."
Target,2o541w,Noob_tuba23,2,Wed Dec 3 20:55:33 2014 UTC,"I take back some of what I said. The low level people actually are more that just a middle man as a lot of them are expected to sell attachment and are key in boosting sales. But what I meant by kicking out support beams I didn't mean the high turnover rate. I meant having 1 person do the job of what was once done by two or three people. And the worse the conditions get the worse the replacement will be if you lose someone. I'm not saying people should become rich off these jobs, but they shouldn't have to live in poverty either."

Target,2o48sk,cyan1113,1 point,Wed Dec 3 11:35:47 2014 UTC,"What do I need to know about offering Target warranties to people? This was not mentioned in what they called my training, but according to one very upset guest I'm supposed to be responsible for warranties...   You are not responsible for servicing the warranties. Firstly, if the guest is talking about the Manufacturer's warranty then obviously that's up to the guest to speak to the Manufacturer. Secondly, if they are talking about the extended warranty that Target offers then they have to speak to Asurion who services the warranties for Target.   https://hub.asurion.com/hub/target/en-us  There's also a phone number listed in each Service Plan booklet with the Claims Phone Number.  Now onto the Warranties themselves. Think about it like this. There are two categories of Warranties. Ones that basically act as an Extended Warranty and Ones that act like an Extended Warranty with Accidental Damage Coverage. The general Yellow is for 2 Years, the Blue is 3 Years and is only the Extended Warranty. Black is Cameras, Purple is Tablets/iPads/Laptops/eReaders, Green is Video Game Consoles which all include the Extended Warranty plus Accidental Damage Coverage. They scale based on the sale price of the item being covered in different increments for each category. The guest can either register the warranty or keep the receipt and the service plan booklet for future claims.   Basically if the register prompts to ask about the Service Plan make sure to mention it to the guest. Outside of Electronic Team Members and maybe the occasional small appliance, as a cashier you shouldn't be ringing up most of the items anyways as the Electronic Team Member should be taking care of these transactions to drive Accessory Attach Rates(basically selling smaller items for these big ticket items)."

Target,2o1z33,saaria,22,Tue Dec 2 16:03:03 2014 UTC,"I'll say it like the Target TM I am.  Get the debit card.  Just like writing a check or using your bank debit card.  No fees, no interest.  Still get the 5% off, still get free shipping from Target.com, still get extended return policy...  I use mine almost every day.  Why wouldn't you want to save 5%?  (The only annoying thing is that it takes a few days before it actually pulls it from your account, so if you aren't good with managing your money, you can think you have more than you really do.)"
Target,2o1z33,rumplexx,8,Tue Dec 2 16:18:30 2014 UTC,"I have the credit card. Whenever I make a purchase on it, I immediately go up to guest services and pay it off. This way there's no interest, it withdraws from my bank account immediately, and I'm helping my credit score. It's a win-win."
Target,2o1z33,anyquestions,4,Tue Dec 2 18:20:15 2014 UTC,"Technically, you would be helping your credit score more by allowing the statement balance to be non-zero and then paying before the due date. You can even set it up for autopay. This means no interest and it still reports utilization to the credit bureaus, otherwise they just see that you never use your credit as it always reads 0 balance to them. It does help with age of credit accounts though, regardless!"
Target,2o1z33,slenderwin,1 point,Tue Dec 2 19:31:50 2014 UTC,"I know. But I already have multiple credit cards. Therefore, I was hesitant to add yet another one but seems like it may be worth the savings."
Target,2o1z33,thats_way_harsh_tai,6,Tue Dec 2 20:55:26 2014 UTC,"The debit card is totally worth it! In addition to the 5%, you also get a lot of coupons at the checkout, and they tend to be catered to the types of purchases you make.  Pair the 5% with coupon stacking (using two coupons: a target coupon and a manufactures coupon, on the same item) and you can save quite a bit!  Make sure you take your checkbook with you the day you apply, as they will most likely need a blank check."
Target,2o1z33,RomulanBacon,7,Tue Dec 2 16:55:11 2014 UTC,This thread is making the GSA in me jump for joy.
Target,2o1z33,ChocolatePopes,3,Tue Dec 2 19:16:58 2014 UTC,"Oh I see, you have the option of either...nice!"
Target,2o1z33,DoomedJanissary,3,Tue Dec 2 17:10:07 2014 UTC,"To be compeltly honest? Credit card is garbarge. If you want to save 5% off, get the debit one. Really, if you use coupons and cartwheel, then you are truly saving money. Otherwise, the Redcard is just a tool to get you to shop in the store more.  Also you should try different stores for grocery items. I get 15 percent off,but even I get my groceries fro Aldi's or other grocery stores."
Target,2o1z33,initialgold,2,Wed Dec 3 07:07:01 2014 UTC,Thanks all! So it's a debit not a credit card?
Target,2o1z33,Isak922,-2,Tue Dec 2 17:07:48 2014 UTC,"Red Card is a credit card  Check card is a debit card  I would recommend the check card, especially if you don't want another credit card. If you frequently shop here, it's the best option to take advantage. To get one, just getting in a blank check to start the process with any cashier or service person :)"
Target,2o1z33,DoomedJanissary,18,Tue Dec 2 21:06:04 2014 UTC,They're both called Red Cards.

Target,2nw0rb,TM0064278933,2,Mon Dec 1 00:04:46 2014 UTC,sales floor TMs are an all-purpose position whereas plano is a specialty position
Target,2nw0rb,rykerman33,2,Mon Dec 1 01:51:44 2014 UTC,"Pay-wise, it is an increase, so that's your most important thing.  Personally, I feel like there are more opportunities to show your leadership skills if you are interested in advancing, because you will likely have one day per week when the team lead is not there. You'll probably never be in the store with no sales floor team lead around.  There is a split between independent work and team work.  I love Plano. Part of it is less guest interaction and more task work, but The early morning shifts make me feel like I have a lot more time out of work. Most of the year your schedule is pretty steady, also. Not right now, unfortunately."
Target,2nw0rb,pohatu771,2,Mon Dec 1 02:06:30 2014 UTC,"I would replace ""step up"" with ""more valuable"".  The more you know the more you understand.  More responsibility, yes.  But its really just like you should know better.  Cross training is your friend if you want hours.  You might come to a point that you understand how the computer system works/how the store actually operates.  During 4th quarter when I was backroom trainer, I would wander onto workbench/mysupport during lunch when I was asked something.  I learned everything from how the pdas were programmed to how the computer (accumulator) worked to best practices.  The amount of shortcuts I now use is absurd."
Target,2nw0rb,brokenwinds,2,Mon Dec 1 14:00:42 2014 UTC,"It's not a 'step up' in a promotion sense, but it definitely makes you more valuable. There is more responsibility, but also a lot of freedom to do things at your own discretion once you get the hang of it. If you're looking to step up, it's a good move."
Target,2nw0rb,FenrirSM,2,Mon Dec 1 16:00:43 2014 UTC,I went from softlines to Plano and then back. The work is really interesting imho but having to set the alarm for 3am everyday was brutal. I don't know what your social life is like but I'm pretty young and when all of my friends and my boyfriend had opposite schedules from me it really made life difficult.
Target,2nv77a,marv3fan,3,Sun Nov 30 19:31:08 2014 UTC,"If you press the down arrow, or ""d"", then enter; you can see other aisle locations throughout the store.  If aisles are being tied/reset/flexed, they may not show the correct locations"
Target,2nv77a,Isak922,4,Sun Nov 30 20:05:55 2014 UTC,"On the NOP item screen, press down (or press d then enter) to see other locations. If the location reads XX(0) then it's on an endcap; an odd number aisle would mean it's on a front endcap, an even would be a back endcap. And incorrect ties are common after Black Friday when you have lots of blown endcaps and need to get something up quickly but can't yet break the endcap's tie. If it happens any other time of the year it's because a team lead isn't managing their area well."
Target,2nv77a,anyquestions,2,Sun Nov 30 20:09:16 2014 UTC,"Not necessarily. The team could be actively working on something, at which point that situation would be unavoidable. There are a few other points in the year where ties can get funny for legitimate reasons, such as back to school.  As far as NOP goes, another one you should be aware of are sidecaps, which display as a 99 in parentheses."
Target,2nv77a,FenrirSM,1 point,Mon Dec 1 02:30:52 2014 UTC,Thank you for the sidecap info.. I didn't wanna ask too many questions but was wondering that as well
Target,2nv77a,rh51too,2,Mon Dec 1 03:09:56 2014 UTC,"Focals also sometimes get tied to 91, 92 and 93."
Target,2nv77a,FenrirSM,2,Mon Dec 1 09:50:44 2014 UTC,This is the perfect place to ask questions! None of us can give you funny looks later.
Target,2nv77a,anyquestions,1 point,Mon Dec 1 15:48:04 2014 UTC,"I definitely agree, I should have been more specific. I meant to say if ties are wrong for an extended period then it's a sign of mismanagement. With store tie, you really shouldn't have incorrect ties for more than a day or two."
Target,2nv77a,FenrirSM,1 point,Mon Dec 1 03:26:58 2014 UTC,"Yeah, definitely shouldn't last more than a day or two."

Target,2nuh9m,nladyman,4,Sun Nov 30 14:53:36 2014 UTC,"Honestly, if I were at guest service and you said the game code had been redeemed, I would deny the return. You get your money back and a free game when you decide to buy another XBox bundle later on. There is no way to reduce the refund amount, and a no-receipt return would only allow an exchange within video games for the same price as what you paid, minus the gift card  I spent twenty minutes on the phone with Microsoft the other day confirming that the codes hadn't been used after someone returned the same console.  Halo can't be returned.  Your only option, other than rip off Target/Microsoft/Ubisoft, is to sell the console and game privately."
Target,2nuh9m,pohatu771,2,Mon Dec 1 01:05:18 2014 UTC,"That's perfectly understandable, I think I'll go with the private sale. Thank you!"
Target,2nuh9m,Isak922,3,Mon Dec 1 01:37:47 2014 UTC,"The console can be returned without any issues.  As mentioned, you now own that game. Federal Copyright Laws do NOT allow any opened media (Games, Software, CD's, Movies) to be returned once they've been opened; only exchanged for the same exact title.  Bring it to your local Gamestop."
Target,2nuh9m,ChocolatePopes,5,Sun Nov 30 16:58:09 2014 UTC,"The item is not a physical disc. This bundle has a redeemable code, which can not be returned if redeemed. In my store, we deny returns for any item that has been opened and has a redeemable code.  OP is SOOL unfortunately."
Target,2nuh9m,initial-e,1 point,Mon Dec 1 09:55:03 2014 UTC,"When I worked GS, I just radio'd GSTL and asked if it was okay to return bundled codes. We didn't really consider it copies of games and would accept the return. YMMV"
Target,2nuh9m,monkeyman80,0,Wed Dec 3 04:26:11 2014 UTC,"its not copyright, but contract with the manufacturers. same reason we can't sell things before street days"
Target,2nuh9m,anachronissmo,-1,Wed Dec 3 02:36:33 2014 UTC,Take the game to store and tell them the disc doesn't function properly and exchange for an unopened copy of the same game. You now have an unopened copy of the game you can exchange for store credit.
Target,2nuh9m,Isak922,2,Fri Dec 12 00:37:09 2014 UTC,That is return fraud in it's finest form.
Target,2nuh9m,IronOreAgate,-1,Fri Dec 12 01:19:55 2014 UTC,"I believe you cant return them. However it doesn't hurt to bring it in and try. They should still be able to sell it repackaged as long as everything works, even with the game redeemed. Worst case, they might offer to let you return it for store credit.  Targets return policy is sort of lose to be honest."
Target,2nuh9m,Splazoid,-10,Sun Nov 30 19:59:12 2014 UTC,"Yes, bring it all back. Don't tape it up, they will want to inspect it. If they give you a hard time, you can create a charge-back with your credit card - you can tell the manager that to help plead your case too."
Target,2nuh9m,insanemilkshake,7,Sun Nov 30 15:13:33 2014 UTC,"Can't return opened games. Period. You can only exchange for a different copy of the same item, and we open it for you in store to make sure you don't try and bring it back sealed. The Xbox would be a different story if say it were... defective... out of the box."
Target,2nuh9m,DoomedJanissary,3,Sun Nov 30 16:39:58 2014 UTC,"Like said before, it's a federal law - exchange for the same title only. The only other thing you can do is exchange it for a different console, but has to be the same title ( eg. Exchange Halo for X1 for 360 version; Horrible Bosses DVD for a Bluray version).  It's not just corporate policy, it's a law."
Target,2nuh9m,Splazoid,0,Sun Nov 30 19:22:34 2014 UTC,"Cite the law; I've never heard of such a thing. To my knowledge, one could easily create a charge-back and win, provided they have made an in-person attempt to return the merchandise. For Visa, this would be code 53."
Target,2nuh9m,DoomedJanissary,1 point,Mon Dec 1 05:55:39 2014 UTC,"Music, video games, movies... they all are under this law. This prevents people from copying media, then returning it.   Also, when you do an exchange, you have to open the plastic/seals before giving it to the guest to ensure they can't return it for full price. It's the same rule for every store over worked."
Target,2nuh9m,Splazoid,0,Mon Dec 1 16:15:08 2014 UTC,"Still no law citation.. It may certainly be a policy, but it isn't a law - like not returning alcohol is typically a state law."

Target,2nuh9m,lovexsongs,3,Sun Nov 30 15:29:37 2014 UTC,You have to exchange it for the same title -- can be for a different gaming platform though.   Not sure how the redeemed code would work for an exchange.
Target,2ns5vu,TargetQuestions,5,Sat Nov 29 20:05:05 2014 UTC,"Everytime I see one of these questions, I always say the same. Do not ignore the food areas!!! Starbucks, deli,bakery,food ave, produce, and meat are extremely neglected in my store, and just from the posts I've read on this sub, it seems to be a common issue is most stores. I don't expect any etl to be able to decorate a cake or run a line of lattes, but if a food member has a question, I do expect them to help with a solution. Coming by once a shift just to say hello does not earn respect with the food area."

Target,2ns5vu,fetalbeetles,4,Tue Dec 2 16:33:22 2014 UTC,"You have a lot questions in this! Maybe bullet point them next time. Ive been an ETL for 3 years now, if that makes a difference  Pick the position that you are most interested in. It doesnt matter how many STLs come from that position, if you dont like it, you won't succeed.  Do what you are passionate about.  At a minimum, it takes an ETL 3 years (2 18-month assignments) to become an STL. The 5 year range is more likely if you are a solid candidate. Ive seen some wait as long as 10 years and many are never considered. Dont get ahead of yourself with being gungho about being an STL, you have a ton to learn before it is even in the realm of possibility.  Big stores and little stores have their own pros and cons. Big stores have more options for ETLs than smaller stores, but you have to learn a lot more in a small store.   For an internship and your first ETL position, you want a green running store. For your 2nd position, you want a red running department to turn it around and prove your leadership  capabilities.  Feel free to PM me with anything else"
Target,2ns5vu,SanltarYNAPkin,5,Sun Nov 30 03:19:19 2014 UTC,"For starters, an ETL (Executive Team Leader) is a better position then a TL (Team Leader).   As for what kind of store you want to train at, try to get an internship at a store where their process (for whichever department you'll be an ETL in) is the best.  For example, my store has a very good Logistics process (best in our district) so we always have an intern for ETL-Logistics.   Depending on the size of the store there can be 0-5 ETLs in a department (this coming from my ETL)."
Target,2ns5vu,SanltarYNAPkin,1 point,Sat Nov 29 20:38:35 2014 UTC,"So, for example, there could be 0-5 Guest Experience ETLs? Or Grocery/Logistics/etc.?"
Target,2ns5vu,comicidiot,1 point,Tue Dec 2 16:32:56 2014 UTC,Yes. Only in the larger stores though (super targets). My ETL-logistics guy tells us stories about meetings he goes too where there's 2 etls for flow and 2 more for backroom.
Target,2ns5vu,aoutrance,4,Tue Dec 2 16:38:23 2014 UTC,"I'll preface this with the fact that I am not an ETL, so these are my observations.   Positions that let you know how a store is run would translate to awesome experience towards STL. Such as Logistics and Operations. A Team Lead position to help you get started early on this path would be Dayside Backroom. ETL postions range from as you've listed, Guest Experience, Hardlines, Grocery, and also Logistics, HR, Overnight Logistics, Security, Operations, and perhaps a few others. I can't answer how long it'll take but two of my former ETLs got promoted to STL and each maybe had 5 to 7 years behind them. If I remember correctly they both used to be a TL. Like anything at work, communicate about your ambition, especially to your DTL.    Lastly, don't hesitate to take a TL position; There are TLs at my store who work to become Senior Team Leads and we've hired interns into these SrTL positions. They run LOD shifts, have keys to the building and do other ETL duties. I've seen three SrTL's get promoted to ETL with a fourth promotion around the corner. This position is great if you won't be finished with your school after the internship but want to work at Target until you graduate and get your ETL status.  If you have more direct questions, I'll be happy to answer those as best I can. As usual, you are a Team Member. Just because you are an Executive doesn't mean you are better than those who aren't. You can still take call buttons, pick up trash from the floor and help guests.   I don't expect my ETLs to push a reshop or a CAF because - as someone whose witnessed this first hand - ETLs need to be more focused on making their team work efficiently. I also don't expect my ETLs to sit in an office and gossip or walk around on their phone. From your sales floor team to your back room team. Constantly walk around and survey the floor. if you have two team members zoning in Domestics and another in Infants but Toys is a mess, move people from zoning already zoned/less shopped departments to take care of toys.  There's a lot of on the fly planning. Backroom has an hourly workload, 11 o'clock could be enormous but 12 o'clock could be small and there's no way to know in advance. So, if the backroom team communicate that they won't be able to finish you have to find team members that can help them. Sometimes it's an additional four people PLUS yourself (or other ETLs if you're LOD).  Lastly, I don't know how visits work but please try and find out about visits as soon as possible. We had one day to zone and make our cosmetic department immaculate for a visit the next day. If you can learn of that kind of stuff a week in advance that'd be great. Or better yet, help set a routine so you don't have to worry about these things and have other teams drop everything that they need to do that day."

""Awesome! can you go get me that one?"" ""K"".   So I had to go all the way to the front, get a shopping cart, go to the backroom, pull that giant tv and hope it doesnt crush me, and take it all the way back. I felt like a stereotypical asian woman driving a car, I felt like an accident was bound to happen sometime. There were kids running everywhere, people stopping in the middle of an aisle to chit-chat, things thrown in the floor, you get the point. I finally get to them and give them their TVs. Now I'm like ""Finally!, now where does this printer go--""   ""Excuse me, can you check to see if you have this tv?   Rinse and repeat this process 5 times. My favorite moment from today:   ""Do you know if this tv stand will work with this TV?"" ""Errm, no I dont, sorry."" I look at the box ""Wait I thi----"" ""THATS WHAT YOU ALL SAY, YOU DONT KNOW. YOU DO THAT SO THAT SOMEONE GETS THE WRONG ONE THEN I WASTE MY MONEY"" ""Sir, you have a 32inch tv, it says it holds up to 32inch tvs."" ""Oh... Thanks""   Thankfully, everyone was super nice and patient. I felt bad for the people that wanted a specific tv but we didnt have it by the time they arrived.   TD;DR: I love black friday! cant wait till next year so I can hide in the grocery section."

We have a 3 day window to honor that as a self-price match, but you are asking for a ""black Friday"" (I know, they mean the 4-day ad) price match, which for various reasons we do not do. The same goes for any retailer, the rules change with black Friday."
Target,2nkxx4,CaptainNeedleMouse,7,Thu Nov 27 16:27:47 2014 UTC,"First off, that ad has been posted on the target website for weeks. It is your own fault for making a big purchase and not bothering to check.  Secondly, I'm glad I didn't have to deal with you at my store, because you are being the bane of a guest services cashier's life. If a cashier tells you that it is store policy and there is not anything they can do for you, then that is that. You do not need to harp on them, and ask them to do something that might get them fired (which the return/repurchase idea could do.) I tell people all the time if you bought something and you want the Black Friday price for it then come buy it on Black Friday, and return the other item after you've repurchased it. That way everything is fair and you aren't giving yourself an unfair advantage over other guests, which is the reason the policy exists."
Target,2nkxx4,IronOreAgate,-4,Thu Nov 27 16:39:07 2014 UTC,"I didn't harp, or get rude or slyly suggest anything. I went in yesterday to see what would be the best plan of action to try and get the 20 dollars of savings and was told that I would have to make more work for everyone involved.  Buy item again and return item. so that Some kid would have to walk it back to the back of the store and put it back on a shelf..  So jump through 2 or 3 hoops rather than one. yet the outcome would be the exact same.... It doesn't make sense.  I would have an ""unfair advantage"" over other guests any other time of year, if I did the exact same thing, yet the policy is honored then...just not today or tomorrow.   I will not go black friday bullshit doorbuster shopping because I actually refuse to shop at retailers on thanksgiving day... why??? because I actually feel bad for YOU.

Target,2nkxx4,IronOreAgate,3,Thu Nov 27 16:54:23 2014 UTC,"I don't mind working thanksgiving there are plenty of other jobs that require working on thanksgiving retail workers is just another one. I understand that you are just trying to save us work, but as someone else pointed out if they let you do buy then return, then they need to let others do that, and there are bigger sales on black Friday that the policy can be abused with.   We have TVs that are more then 50% off. There is no other point during the year that you can get that kind of sale. So if guest service let's people return & repurchase a bike, then what's to stop people from doing that on a TV?"
Target,2nkxx4,Isak922,5,Thu Nov 27 19:23:48 2014 UTC,"It is considered a Black Friday sale, even though it starts on Thursday. Do we have the ability? Sure. But our policy says we can't so that people don't buy out our entire inventory days or weeks ahead of time, then come in demanding a price adjustment.  Does it suck? Absolutely. I try to help out as much as I can... but if I make an exception for Guest #1, then the next fifty will want it too."
Target,2nkxx4,Isak922,-8,Thu Nov 27 15:08:33 2014 UTC,"But they would have to have knowledge of the sale prior.  If that's the case why didn't anyone say hey man,  that bike will be on sale for 20 bucks cheaper in two days..   All rules have exceptions. I work with the public I know they can be bitches sometimes but I've also learned that the ones who bitch the most usually get their way.  I tried being polite and using reasoning but apparent that gets you nowhere.    What isn't taken into consideration is that if you piss people off they don't shop there out of spite..  Now I know I'm just one small guy in the grand scheme of things.  But rules that make no sense other than to cause headaches piss me off.  Black Friday actually pulls companies out of the red,  he CA the name so whey the polices don't carry over on these ever important days boggles me"
Target,2nkxx4,comicidiot,7,Thu Nov 27 15:41:12 2014 UTC,"Confidential Information. It can be a major offense for giving out sale information prior to the actual sale. Especially on Black Friday sales.  I have no problem helping people out if they're being respectful, which you very well may have been. But if people come in demanding the world and getting pissed off, I refuse to deal with it and will absolutely put my foot down.  The Team Member was correct on not honoring the sale yesterday. There was no current sale TO honor. We can't give you a sale price that doesn't exist at that time. Buy one tonight and return it with the old receipt, or return the previous one a different day."
Target,2nkxx4,IronOreAgate,5,Thu Nov 27 15:53:51 2014 UTC,"It's true we don't match our Black Friday prices; remember Black Friday technically starts Thursday now. Whether or not I would have returned the bike and sold it is another story but I would like to point out that I don't think this happened at a Target. We open at 6p, no where in North America is it 6pm, 10a at the latest. Unless there are 24 hour Targets that I am unaware of."
Target,2nkxx4,comicidiot,-3,Thu Nov 27 15:09:13 2014 UTC,"This happened last evening.  I wasn't rude with the guy. But when I suggested buying it back he said I would have to come in today at 6pm,  rush to the store and purchase it for the sale price then go to my car and grab the other one and return it for the price I paid which is retarded and a time waster.  I mean I literally could but it at sale price then walk the bike to CS,  with my older receipt and return it...  Rather than just cutting the bullshit and giving me the difference.... With just my receipt.  Or maybe I could return it and walk with them to the back when they toss it back on the shelf and the pick it back up to buy it at a cheaper price.....  See how ignorant this is becoming?"
Target,2nkxx4,CaptainNeedleMouse,1 point,Thu Nov 27 15:31:35 2014 UTC,"If the bike was on sale for black Friday and the sign was up early then I'm sorry you got confused. But the sale probably hadn't started yet and therefore the cashier would not be able to fix the price anyways until Thursday/Friday. the store  probably wanted to get a jump on set up, so they would be able to spent more time at home on thanksgiving."
Target,2nkxx4,comicidiot,1 point,Thu Nov 27 16:43:44 2014 UTC,"Ah, when you said ""It was Thursday"" I got confused. Since returning and selling the bike wouldn't have gotten you the difference, he would have had to manually apply the discount. It wouldn't have taken more than a minute. I would have asked for your receipt and applied a wrong price error and given the 20 bucks back without ever doing a full return and resell. I think 20 dollars is stupid for a BF sale and wouldn't have hesitated, since other items had their BF prices on Wednesday anyways.   I'm sorry that happened :("
Target,2nkxx4,CaptainNeedleMouse,5,Thu Nov 27 15:40:53 2014 UTC,"At my store I would have said no, I wouldn't risk my job over 20$. Wouldn't you think AP (store or corporate level) would be watching for this? They tell us these black Friday rules so many times after all...  We were told outright not to price match any black Friday things or we'd be fired basically."
Target,2nkxx4,DoomedJanissary,2,Thu Nov 27 16:30:52 2014 UTC,"I haven't been told that. I understand things like TVs and such is common sense not to price match, I even said no to 40% off clothes on Wednesday because it was a Black Friday sale. But for 20 dollars just explain to the guest that  you understand their frustration and you'll match it for them. If you get questioned by your TL, ETL, or AP pitch it as the vibe. The vibe might sound like a scapegoat but the vibe is about connecting with the guest and making something right. If I was told by management not to price match any Black Friday sales, I wouldn't have sided with the guest. I would have called over the GSTL or an ETL to back me up. But my ETLs are pro-vibe, so at least if they sided with the guest it'd be their rear and not mine. This is all hypothetical though, I would have checked the bike in the PDA to make sure it was going on sale and if it wasn't I would apologize to the guest and tell them it is another model bike on sale and that they can return the bike today and come back and buy the other bike on Friday/Thursday.   If I was this guest, I personally wouldn't have gone back for a $20 price adjustment."

Target,2nfcak,ScabbitAllPro,9,Tue Nov 25 23:56:18 2014 UTC,"I have a team lead like that. She works dayside, but once called the store at 3am to see if the overnight crew needed help. Why? Not because she was used to closing and would be up until around then anyway. Not because she started work at 5am, so why not come in a few hours earlier. She called Target, at 3 in the morning, to find out if they needed help, because she was bored. SHE. WAS. BORED."

She quickly got promoted and is now a district HR in the busier areas now up north. I've see her every now and then in my old store visiting, and she's still as happy and (legitimately) preppy as always, it's hard to not be in a good mood with her around.  I miss having a nice HR like that sounds :("
Target,2nfcak,DoomedJanissary,2,Wed Nov 26 02:54:48 2014 UTC,Very nice to hear this. That's what ETLs are supposed to do... Make the team happy while finding a way to get the work done. Be sure you let them know personally. Personal recognition always feels great.

Its mostly just walking the line, greeting the guests, and answering lots of questions.   You'll want a walkie and store map. Know where the big door buster items will be staged and a rough on hand count if possible. You can always tell guest that your not sure how many you got of an item... you dont have to remember everything.   If things in line start to get out of control, immediately notify your captain. You, or the captain can tell the guests that the doors will not open until the crowd is under control. 7 black Friday's (now thursday) for me so far and we've only had to call the police once for people cutting in line..."

Nothing worae then needing help and a dead battery.  Oh and walk the whole store before it opens to learn where the big deals are at.. You will be asked that every 30 seconds for at least 4 hours

You could certainly try and fight your store on it if it's the case.  However you go, if you have any interest in a TL position, I would avoid anything but red and khaki."
Target,2nbqfw,zieen,3,Tue Nov 25 02:08:13 2014 UTC,"In my store, it's about half black pants and half khaki. I wear black jeans every day, but I think it depends on what your leadership is like. You can wear any solid color pants, according to the handbook."

Target,2n90xi,Cyan_Ottercat,3,Mon Nov 24 09:40:15 2014 UTC,Policy says so but it is usually not enforced.   And the policy basically says that you can only use the discount or price match (including Target.com). Whichever is greater.

Target,2n4doy,RomulanBacon,3,Sun Nov 23 17:24:25 2014 UTC,Ours was pretty well planned. The night before the guy in photo helped put together the goodie bags so those got taken care of. Everything seemed to go smoothly as far as the event. They just had a couple girls in softlines work it. I showed up at 11 and it ran from 930-1230 so I missed a chunk but there was plenty of music and little girls singing.  After to help get rid of the stuff the electronics TL brought us over crowns and antler hats to wear and give out goodie bags to kids when we had a rare free moment.
Target,2n4doy,RomulanBacon,2,Sun Nov 23 17:23:31 2014 UTC,"Me and one other person. Zero communication on what exactly we were supposed to be doing. We only had an hour beforehand to pack bags. Ran out of stickers halfway through, and ran out of fruit snacks twice. Only got done with around 1/3 of the things before the ""event"" started, so my co-worker went out to hand out bags while I stayed to try and get the rest packed.  I was packing bags and running them out the whole 3 hours. Afterwards, my co-worker told me that several leader-type people came up to her at various points wanting to know why I wasn't out there with her. Turns out, we were originally supposed to have three hours beforehand to pack bags. Which, if we had actually been scheduled for, would have given us more than enough time to get all the bags done. So now I apparently look like some sort of slacker in the eyes of our ETLs because I wasn't given enough time to do my job properly.  Fun times."
Target,2n3knc,mythrowawaybullseye,10,Sat Nov 22 18:48:56 2014 UTC,"You can expect a pay raise next year some time. I think that's how it works. The amount is based on your performance but don't expect the highest amount. I mean I guess it depends on your leaders, but I'm pretty sure they'll never give the maximum amount. Either way it's not going to be more than like 50 cents and you're always going to feel underpaid."
Target,2n3knc,FirePowerCR,5,Sat Nov 22 19:07:10 2014 UTC,"Not sure if your store is different than mine, but we usually get our yearly raises  around March. Yearly raises average $0.10-$0.75, if you're lucky you get a dollar or more, but that is pretty rare.   Just because you are stellar and great at what you do though, remember other factors go into your yearly raise like, for example, your store's safety score. You may have never had an accident ever, but if any of your other TMs or guests get into a lot; that makes your raise go down.  You can try talking to your TLs/HR after your probation, ask how they feel about you now and express how much effort you put to turn yourself around. If you think there might not be much of a raise, try working for a different department, ask if you can be trained to work somewhere else. I personally liked backroom, others like deli, there's also electronics, just think about it or ask what might be open."
Target,2n3knc,DoomedJanissary,3,Sat Nov 22 20:57:28 2014 UTC,"To my knowledge, outside of rare events, you mainly get the possibility of a raise in April/May after your performance review."
Target,2n3knc,indigoibex,3,Sat Nov 22 20:58:00 2014 UTC,"at our store all cashiers are set at a standard %. doesn't matter they singled you out, trained you for guest service, cover gstl breaks, recognize you.. they'll find reasons. i was marked down for not writing enough vibe cards.   you get an annual raise. its in the beginning of the year, it doesn't look like there's a set date, it takes effect when everyone has had their reviews.   the only good part about being a cashier its the easiest way to to tl. you get service desk training, then you're ready for gsa. gsa is basically an unpaid gstl, you are working with etl's / stl/sr tl and they know you now. now you are much better prepared for tl positions."
Target,2n3knc,monkeyman80,2,Sun Nov 23 02:37:32 2014 UTC,"Seasonal workers (if kept) will get an annual raise once they are reviewed (February - March for my store.) Seasonal hires can't be judged off a large review as they are only hired around October or November,  so based off that time the most I was told was between 5 to 10 cents. Don't expect much honestly as a recent hire."
Target,2n3knc,S0uless,1 point,Sun Nov 23 04:13:18 2014 UTC,"Former TL here. You will not get a raise at the end of your 90, however your TL will sit down with you to discuss your performance and strategies for possible improvement. Raises are determined by your TL, ETL, and ETL HR in March, announced in April, and typically take effect the first paycheck in May. It is highly unusual to get a raise other than that. If you need a little more money I would consider going to planogram or flow. You will get $0.50 base raise plus shift differential if your store has a 4am or earlier process. Hope this helps!"
Target,2n3knc,slutbutt_sloptart,1 point,Fri Nov 28 17:34:56 2014 UTC,"If you haven't been at target for more than a year when reviews come out they will give you a penny raise for every month you have been there. They call it ""pro rated"" which is a load of crap."

Target,2n2jfn,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,6,Sat Nov 22 10:44:12 2014 UTC,"No. Ot is still paid over 40, just not counted for the stl ot budget for some reason. You will get time and a half on your check for anything over 40."
Target,2n2jfn,AforAnarchist,2,Sat Nov 22 11:29:18 2014 UTC,"/u/AfirAnachist is correct. Federal law requires OT be paid for any hours worked over 40 no matter what the reason or week.  Companies that pay the holiday can have a person work 40 hours and get paid for the holiday giving them 48 hours of regular pay. But, the actual work time isn't over 40 so no OT."
Target,2n2jfn,pgh9fan,1 point,Sat Nov 22 12:06:19 2014 UTC,Thank you both for the clarification. I guess that's a misconception 5 years in the making :v
Target,2n2jfn,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,1 point,Sat Nov 22 21:55:28 2014 UTC,"I'm guessing what they're talking about is this: when you get paid time and a half on a holiday, that time and a half is what counts that week. If you work any additional overtime it counts the time and a half from that Holiday. So say you work Monday Through Friday, including 8 hours on Thanksgiving, then you work Saturday you don't get paid time and a half on Saturday because you earned it on Thursday."

Target,2n29l7,monkeyman80,2,Sat Nov 22 14:58:12 2014 UTC,"ask right away, but there's no guarantee. electronics has a pay bump and extra training. its not like you're training in other areas of the store so you can pick up shifts. <5 minutes doesn't count as late unless its related to raises.   the one incident of 45 can be enough to be terminated depending on store.   it'll usually work this way: someone wants to go train. how are they in your team? they are good/bad. then i want/dont want them on my team. you might be good at what you do, but you can do certain things you're toxic to transferring."

I'd have to think so eventually but maybe someone on here is part of a pilot program for it at their store.

Are the training videos on Workbench anywhere?  I'm not a huge fan of the myDevices in general; they're convenient and sleek, but besides lacking backroom functionality they log off due to inactivity way to quickly and mine seem to stop scanning intermittently.

As for MyDevices, they're adding SUBT sometime next year, but I haven't heard any mention of PULL functionality (or most logistics tasks from RF Apps). It was explained to me as the MyDevices are much more fragile and backroom would likely break them, so they will continue to use PDAs and LPDAs."

Target,2mzpt3,DoomedJanissary,6,Fri Nov 21 16:01:51 2014 UTC,Actually I believe you do get an extra dollar an hour for working black friday
Target,2mzpt3,IronOreAgate,2,Fri Nov 21 16:16:44 2014 UTC,"I know you get an extra dollar working before 6 AM, but not the actual Black Friday unless they changed it since last year, I haven't worked there since March."
Target,2mzpt3,DoomedJanissary,4,Fri Nov 21 16:55:25 2014 UTC,"Last year was the same. You get the standard over night +1$ if your there at night, a free dollar per hour for being there on black Friday, and time and a half for thanksgiving.   Target is also doing an extra 50 cents on the last two weekends before Christmas."

Target,2mzpt3,DoomedJanissary,4,Fri Nov 21 17:37:20 2014 UTC,Soo if I'm working 5:00PM-4:00AM... Does OT count the dollar extra? Also I've never worked OT.. Is it time and a half or double?
Target,2mzpt3,k929,1 point,Fri Nov 21 18:02:14 2014 UTC,"If you're working 5 PM starting Thanksgiving, you'd get time and a half between then and midnight. Still a nice seven hours!  After that (Black Friday), working before 6 AM, you get an extra $1/hour, I don't remember when was the time that the extra $1/hr starts though, if anyone else knows? And from what I understand from some TMs here, they got an extra dollar of holiday pay too for BF.   11 hour shift sounds brutal though man, and on the worst day! Good luck!"

So if one was to work from Thursday night into Friday morning... one would only get holiday pay for the hours on Thursday night?  If so that's kind of scummy."
Target,2mzpt3,Germerican88,2,Fri Nov 21 19:27:41 2014 UTC,"From Thursday night till 12am you get time and a half, but because Friday isn't a national holiday, they give you an extra dollar until 6am."

Target,2mxhan,monkeyman80,1 point,Fri Nov 21 02:36:07 2014 UTC,"I don't think they see me as a weak team member,  necessarily.  Our logistics team as a whole had a massive turn over this year,  leaving me as one of the most knowledgeable and quickest people they have.  They have me scheduled for both double trucks that week,  and we generally get slammed at the  beginning of the week truck load wise.  I'm thinking my etl wants me to help process those over dealing with tg and bf. That's my thought though."
Target,2mxhan,monkeyman80,2,Fri Nov 21 18:19:04 2014 UTC,maybe you're not worth the cost and not needed. maybe they don't like you and are friends with another that got the shift. there's no reason a gsa should be scheduled as opening gstl while a gstl is working elsewhere during the same shift other than ap loves me since i assist them a lot.

So when it was throwing wrong locations I didn't think it was configured to the wrong store. Been with the company 5 years and I still learn some thing new every week.
Target,2mwya0,xen0cide,3,Thu Nov 20 21:25:56 2014 UTC,Different target stores will be sent different amounts depending on projections and how much inventory is at the distribution centers. Good luck getting that number from your local store because that is highly protected information due to security risks.
Target,2mwya0,slutbutt_sloptart,3,Thu Nov 20 23:03:29 2014 UTC,"Aha, well I used to work in Electronics and knew how many pieces they had going into the backroom the day beforehand, and our ETL told us how many approximately that we were going to have on hand to sell. Just wondering."

Target,2mwya0,comicidiot,2,Thu Nov 20 23:22:59 2014 UTC,I feel this is a (heavily weighted) two-sided coin.. The earlier we open the more hours at time and a half I will get meaning I (and others) make more $$ to provide for ourselves and families

Also if you have cardboard you can just throw it on the ground infront of the bailer. If you are zoning and find something that doesnt go there just hide it. Nobody wants to be doing a ton of reshop at the end of the night.  The rest is common sense.
Target,2mty7m,meatjacket,3,Thu Nov 20 17:45:14 2014 UTC,"This is all good advice, but nobody has told you yet. Don't drink the koolaid. Don't volunteer too much to really go out of your way for your store, because people will come to rely on that. They'll start to expect that they can ask you to stay late any time, or come in early any time, or change your schedule any time because you're ""always so flexible."" It's a corporation, and you can't let your store use you to keep on its legs if it's mismanaged (as many stores are).   Edit: Along those same lines, understand that you, as a person, can only do so much work during your shift. If there's more work than you can physically do, it's not your fault. Stand up for yourself and let them know if you need help. (This is often the case at the guest service desk, where I spend most of my time)"

Target,2mn0jw,initialgold,6,Tue Nov 18 05:51:04 2014 UTC,"Remember to tell the guest how much change you are giving back. remember to count back change if they give you a $100 this is for the benefit of the camera if the person comes back to say they didnt get change. Remember to scan the big bills with the checker machine. Keep your register clean, always look busy or ask for more tasks. Remember to stretch, standing for so long is bad on your feet and back. Always apologize for any wait time. Don't forget to smile!  Edit: if you see anyone coming up with a larger purchase ask if they have any coupons to use today if they do ask them to see the coupons first to scan with the item it is for, this prevents coupon fraud. Remember to check each coupon as it comes through because some may need to be adjusted. Usually if it doesnt automatically come up on the register, check the coupon for expiration and  that it is being used for the item listed.  If anyone ever says ""I did it here last time"" for anything call over a gstl, you are still new and may be targeted by scammers. Pm me for any other questions."

One of the hardest lessons I've learned is to not be hurt when I make a mistake. It just means you're human.   The best skill you will gain working is confidence.. You seem intelligent and as you get more and more practice you will trust yourself and your job performance more and that's when you become really valuable.   The cool thing about working at target, and retail in general, is that if it doesn't work out cashiering there are opportunities elsewhere in your store..

But if this is a big step up for him, holding off on a new car (which lots of people get when they get a better job) would be prudent, especially at first.  People like to gossip about how much ETLs make. Some of the experienced team members may be upset that they got turned down (or didn't meet education requirements) in favor of a completely new face who's never stepped in the store before. Other team members will have liked the old ETL more. And it's always the petty and irrational people that cause the most problems.

Target,2mm82q,IronOreAgate,1 point,Thu Nov 20 02:16:53 2014 UTC,"be chill! encourage things like red cards, etc, but don't be obnoxious or overbearing about it. Say hello and get to know the team members. don't be afraid to chat with them about non-work stuff."
Target,2mm82q,fetalbeetles,1 point,Tue Nov 18 05:53:14 2014 UTC,"Learn the process. Maybe pattern with your team lead, or even team members, and ask them their daily routine. Even ask them what they like, dislike, or would want changed about it.   Take that info and use it to work your self into the routine. Do not try to change it right away. Helping out with the work load I know is a huge moral boost and I think would give you an idea of what your TMs are dealing with.  If my ETL did that? I would regard her as the greatest ETL I have ever had. But instead she just tries to make ""improvements"" which usually make it worse.  I work logistics backroom day."
Target,2mm82q,fetalbeetles,8,Tue Nov 18 23:36:22 2014 UTC,"As an ETL for 3 years, I'd say the biggest thing is no different than any other professional position you may take; dont think your shit don't stink, no matter your position, there are people in the store that know your position much better than you do.  What position were you offered? In general, be prepared for anything. Don't expect any vacations (etls that feel entitled are going to fail) and don't expect to dictate anything.  You will close the days no other etl wants to. The pay may seem nice, but you will be shit on enough to make it seem $15k less than it is.  Feel free to PM me with any specific questions"
Target,2mm82q,DoomedJanissary,1 point,Tue Nov 18 03:47:31 2014 UTC,"Thank you for messaging me, I just PMed you! :D I haven't been given a specific role yet, but I'm really hoping for HR."
Target,2mm82q,dubblechzburger,2,Tue Nov 18 04:46:28 2014 UTC,"HR is an extremely tough first assignment. In many markets, they won't hire new ETLs into HR. It is more of a second assignment"
Target,2mm82q,DoomedJanissary,4,Tue Nov 18 15:26:37 2014 UTC,"Please, listen to your team members.  If they try to give you advice, tell you you did something wrong, or hints to do something better, listen to them. The worst kind of ETL is a new person who's never worked for the company and tries to do the job their way completely wrong and chastise those who have worked years at it. We get it, you're a higher tier than us and get paid more to do some other duties and such, but please be open to listen. Don't shut us out and mess up how things are done.   And yeah, like the other person said, don't do the fake smile and faux encouragement. So annoying!  Just relax and be yourself!"
Target,2mm82q,DoomedJanissary,2,Tue Nov 18 04:41:39 2014 UTC,"This is great advice, thank you! :) If you don't mind me asking, what are some of the best ways to earn the respect of the team?"
Target,2mm82q,Besnasty,3,Tue Nov 18 04:45:14 2014 UTC,"Not the person you replied to but the ETLs I always respected the most were the ones who didn't give a ""better than the team"" vibe. Obviously, we know you guys are better/higher up than us, but an ETL that's not against hopping on when it's that busy, grabbing a call in the area they ETL, grab a call button when the sales floor people are on the floor are the best kind of ETLs.  My store team lead has given me breaks in electronics when I've had no one to give me one and I view him much higher in my eyes. And when my ETLs ask me if I can help cover areas or w/e I'm really willing to do so because I've heard and seen our ETLs back up cashier and scramble for call buttons when we're busy. Hell even a couple female ETLs bundle up in the cold Minnesota winters and go fetch some carts when our cart attendants were behind. And if they weren't that ""good"" II would maybe have the attitude like why should I help ""beachtowngirl"" she never does anything but sits in the office or disciplines people.  Long story short, I've seen all my ETLs in my store help with random/""small tasks"" so when they ask me to help with them, I know it's not just them filing the small stuff onto me. It's either they can't do it or I'm in the best position to or whatever. It's not that they are above doing stuff like that since they are ETLs."
Target,2mm82q,funplex,1 point,Tue Nov 18 04:55:53 2014 UTC,"Like I said, listen to them. Ask them if they need help and to teach you how to do what they do. You get a better understanding of how everything works.  What kind of ETL are you going to be if I can ask? :)"
Target,2mm82q,Besnasty,3,Tue Nov 18 04:48:36 2014 UTC,"Okay, I'll definitely try really hard to do that! :)  They told me that I won't know until the end of training. I really want to be HR! :)"
Target,2mm82q,Typical_White_Girl,1 point,Tue Nov 18 04:51:39 2014 UTC,"Aww! The suspense! Lol!  Well I guess if you do that, you'll be doing more front end stuff then. You get to have fun with cashiers, guest service, and cart attendants! Those are not everyone's most favorite job, so it's nice to give rewards and do fun contests to encourage TMs to ask guests to get Red Cards, extended service warranties, and upsell reusable bags :)"
Target,2mm82q,SenorBojangles,2,Tue Nov 18 05:22:56 2014 UTC,"Don't neglect the food area! In my store our etls interact at minimum with us in bux,deli,produce,bakery,meat. I get that we run completely different then the rest of the store and we are pretty self sufficient, but I expect my leaders to be able to help if I have an issue. In my store there is a total of one etl that knows anything about our area, and she's not even etl of food. We don't expect you to know everything, but please for the love of all things tarjey, make your presence known there and at least try to learn basic stuff. Coming by once a shift to say hey does not earn you respect with the food members."
Target,2mm82q,SenorBojangles,3,Tue Nov 18 05:09:50 2014 UTC,"This. As a Starbucks team member, we are the most neglected part of the store. We only have FOUR TM'S and our TL is an LOD so she rarely works at Sbux...when we've been telling the ETL's for months that we need to be training people. Here it is, a week and a half before black Friday, and we still have no one.   Morale at my store is the lowest it's been since the store opened eight years ago. Listen to your team members with sincerity. Happy team members work harder."
Target,2mm82q,RomulanBacon,2,Tue Nov 18 14:27:15 2014 UTC,"Hey! Maybe you're store will fail the best team survey like mine! We've had a clusterfuck of a year, but it has ended with lots of raises for everyone. Moral still sucks, but at least we are getting paid decently to hate it."
Target,2mm82q,rh51too,2,Tue Nov 18 15:17:25 2014 UTC,Dont forget about us in food ave! We'd like to see some etls that come over and help out or ask questions instead of just demanding food at a certain time. We want someone who cares
Target,2mm82q,Andis1,3,Tue Nov 18 06:03:21 2014 UTC,"Just wanted to leave some notes. I did the Store Internship program over the summer and was offered a full time position when I graduate. All in all, I loved it. Target's culture is pretty awesome and they would say its the best in the retail industry. They give you a ton of resources to be successful, and there are many other executives that you can reach out to if you encounter an issue that you are not sure how to handle.  I find the work pretty rewarding as I love leading teams and seeing your work turn into results. The hours aren't great but I really enjoy all the team members at my store, so that makes it bearable.  I also like that it can be challenging at times. You will have to make decisions quickly and accurately based on your knowledge of the store. And of course you will have to deal with some awful guests, but there are plenty of awesome interactions as well.   If you have any specific questions, I'd be more than happy to share insight."
Target,2mm82q,FenrirSM,1 point,Tue Nov 18 03:04:44 2014 UTC,"I also like that it can be challenging at times. You will have to make decisions quickly and accurately based on your knowledge of the store.   Hi, thank you for your response! What are some examples of challenges that you had to face?"
Target,2mm82q,LeChiotx,1 point,Tue Nov 18 04:44:35 2014 UTC,"Well I think the biggest challenge was that I am 21 years old, didn't know very much about the processes of each work center very well, and I was expected to lead teams of team members who have been there for 20+ years. It was kind of intimidating at first, but establishing relationships and not being afraid to ask questions and their opinions was key to establishing a leadership role.  Other things will come up when you have LOD (Leader on Duty) shifts that you may have no idea how to handle. (This is an EXTREME example, but at my store prior to me being there a person started a fire on a jean table) Again, here is where having good relationships with your team comes into play, as they will be able to help you out. You should never have to make a decision solely alone."
Target,2mm82q,Impy101001,2,Tue Nov 18 18:34:34 2014 UTC,No matter your position you will have to split your priorities between work on the floor during LOD shifts and office duties.  Many etls have trouble switching back and forth.
Target,2mmyfn,HowToBeaGoodLeader,5,Tue Nov 18 05:11:59 2014 UTC,"Sounds like something you need to discuss with the hotline if your STL or HR isn't willing to help. But talk to them first, the last resort is the hot line. Explain you don't feel comfortable how they handle things, and hopefully they'll change their tune. Other wise, looks like the hot line is your best bet, but definitely talk to HR first."
Target,2mmyfn,DoomedJanissary,2,Tue Nov 18 05:27:21 2014 UTC,"I have to disagree with this. HR is there to protect target, they really are not your friends. If there was a threat made by an ETL going to HR or the STL is not going to help because they are all friends."
Target,2mmyfn,rykerman33,1 point,Tue Nov 18 21:03:18 2014 UTC,"I've had friends that have, and when you call the hotline they usually ask if you've spoken to all your superiors for help before just going to the hotline.   I've had some HR that have helped without needing the hotline, others that left you no choice.   I just hope OP's situation gets better and it's a better work environment for whatever s/he does."
Target,2mmyfn,DoomedJanissary,4,Wed Nov 19 18:24:35 2014 UTC,"Call the hotline. From what you are saying this is exactly what it is for. Get everyone to document all incidents. Start doing notes on your phone with something like ""11/18/14 around 5am ETL Bob said 'something threatening' to TM Billy. Sallly, Tom and myself were all present"".   ETLs and the STL are generally all friends, go out to dinner together, have BBQs at each others houses. Going to one of the with a problem about an other won't help because they will side with their peer and nothing will happen"
Target,2mmyfn,rykerman33,1 point,Tue Nov 18 21:18:53 2014 UTC,"i've called the hotline. immediate issues were addressed with no retribution. not to my liking, but at least someones actually looking at it. you won't get your tl/etl removed, but its going to get looked into."
Target,2mmyfn,monkeyman80,1 point,Wed Nov 19 01:59:48 2014 UTC,"Last time I've heard, some of the people tried the hotline, but their issues were directed to the STL, which in turn was shrugged off as a non-issue despite the number of quittings and complaints amongst our own team. This could just be fear of actually trying things out, but the general mentality is that the hotline/complaints to HQ hasn't really done much."
Target,2mjcr3,Franchize88,9,Mon Nov 17 06:12:26 2014 UTC,"Pretty much.  Target doesn't price match when it says on competitor ads:   quantities limited door buster while supplies last rainchecks not allowed free gift card with $XX.00 purchase $XX.00 off with combined product purchase buy one get one deals   Also, we don't match store brand to store brand along with produce and meats because quality varies. So if Great Value (Walmart) cheese is on sale 2/$5, you can't price match that with Market Pantry (Target) cheese.   We don't accept competitors coupons, but you can stack deals together for a sweet price: TGT coupon + manufacture coupon + Cartwheel app + text message coupon deals have been great for me (remember, one coupon type per item; can't buy three boxes of cereal and expect it to be used three times with only one coupon).  Just remember to be prepared when you get to the register and read the fine print (sometimes deals are only good for a certain model or not valid on clearance, stuff like that)  I have gotten price match from Amazon, but there's a few factors to remember like it needs to be fulfilled by Amazon itself, not a private seller. So we can't price match a Tab 3 tablet from Samsung as the seller, must be Amazon. The service desk person will let you know if it's valid or not.   Good luck on your holiday shopping! :)"
Target,2mjcr3,DoomedJanissary,5,Mon Nov 17 06:44:27 2014 UTC,"It's like that every Black Friday weekend. You may be able to pricematch before Thanksgiving, maybe. But def not Black Friday ads"

Target,2mjcr3,Agurtzane,2,Mon Nov 17 22:29:45 2014 UTC,"Also, i believe there is no holding of items anymore for the holiday season"
Target,2mjcr3,meatjacket,5,Mon Nov 17 08:35:59 2014 UTC,"I think that depends on what you're putting on hold. If its something mega awesome that everyone wants... probably not... If its just some pants or some boots, probably yes."
Target,2mjcr3,SoulCrystal,2,Mon Nov 17 14:34:40 2014 UTC,"there will be a LOT more holds. target policy says nothing limited on sale, clearance, whatever. i tell person bringing it to guest service we can't hold it. we already told them we could...   flexible fulfillment is the new hold."
Target,2mjcr3,monkeyman80,1 point,Wed Nov 19 01:55:45 2014 UTC,"same last weekend too. we had some bad gsa's that allowed it to ""vibe"" but yeah we just make it easy for the guests that we don't do it that 3 days. after we get away from timed/limited deals we can point them to the rare deals that arent matched."
Target,2mim0b,crash_focus,6,Mon Nov 17 01:25:49 2014 UTC,"It's pretty awful. People will ask you these next three days for the front page ad TV that was sold out the first five minutes the store opened, ask to get a reason check on things you can't, phone calls for people asking you to hold their entire Christmas list that fits four shopping cart of stuff for two days... It's fun...  Last year the fun part was when people wanted specific rare Skylanders or Furbies of a specific color. Those big doll houses that come in either pink or purple. Those E-Z Bake ovens in black or pink. Almost all of these are the same DPCI and bundled together in 20 different locations in the back room.   My personal favorite: Christmas lights. Everyone wants the green wired lights, we only have white wired ones left after November. No, we are not going to receive anymore shipments, these are seasonal. Good luck finding them with the counts being way off in every store since it's hard to keep count.   Merry Christmas!"
Target,2mim0b,DoomedJanissary,4,Mon Nov 17 04:12:41 2014 UTC,depends on the store/volume. you'll get insane volume. we're a low volume store. for an hour we had a steady stream of people just walking in. imagine an hour of people just walking into the store.   it'll be crazy during the early hours. when people figure out the cheap tv's and stuff are gone they'll dial down. it'll be dead until the next timed sale.   breaks are fine. there's going to be insane coverage. you'll never see so many team members.
Target,2mim0b,monkeyman80,3,Mon Nov 17 03:31:31 2014 UTC,"This is my third Black Friday. They are crazy busy. Usually nothing crazy happens. I am in AP and communicate with all the other stores nearby, and nothing too crazy happens. Breaks will be fine. Each store is staffed well."
Target,2mim0b,iJeffwuh,2,Mon Nov 17 03:51:07 2014 UTC,"This will be my 2nd black Friday working. The first year I worked as a cashier for the 1AM to 8AM shift. I know a few stores are closing after 2AM to reopen at 8AM, meanwhile mine will be open overnight.  This past year I since have moved on from cashier to Market/Electronics/Hardlines TM, in which case I'll be working Electronics for 5:30PM to 1:30AM for Thanksgiving to Friday, and then come back at 4:30 to close for 11PM.  Something to keep in mind is guests will be in a rush, just keep a smile on your face and do your best to be patient with them. Be ready for just having a few moments of telling people certain items will be out of stock or a certain price was only available for doorbusters.  Keep in mind, breaks are mandatory. You are required to take your 30 min before the 5 hour mark, and you get a 15 after 2 hours. So if you work an 8 hour shift, you'll get 2 15-min breaks and a 30.  One thing I can say what is nice about it is if you're working on Thanksgiving, that's pay and a half, and every hour before 6AM from 12AM is 1+ dollar more to your hourly pay."
Target,2mim0b,S0uless,3,Mon Nov 17 15:17:20 2014 UTC,"Mandatory breaks can vary depending on what state you're in. I'm in MN, and it is as follows:   At 4 hours, you get a 15-minute paid break.  At 6 hours, you get a 30-minute unpaid break.  At 7 hours, you get another 15-minute paid break.  At 11 hours, you get another 15.  To not hit compliance, you need to punch out for your 30 within six hours of punching in/back in."
Target,2mim0b,mister_hotshine,2,Mon Nov 17 22:24:54 2014 UTC,Good point!  :)
Target,2mim0b,S0uless,2,Mon Nov 17 23:45:43 2014 UTC,"My store gives schedule cards with your breaks and lunches marked on it, and you're expected to go exactly when it says. They shift people around to cover for people missing because of breaks.  If you're scheduled sales floor, you will be pushing. It's not usually CAF, but entire vehicles of the same item. Most of the sales happening (at least early in the day) are from ad items that aren't located anywhere but pallets."
Target,2mim0b,pohatu771,1 point,Mon Nov 17 21:39:12 2014 UTC,How is the stock for game consoles ( xbox one) on black friday would you say? 10 - 20 consoles?
Target,2mim0b,roysgame,1 point,Tue Nov 18 01:39:31 2014 UTC,I managed to snag a 27 hour Consumables shift.  Should be pretty sweet because we don't do jack for market on black friday.
Target,2minwr,wonderman911,9,Mon Nov 17 01:44:41 2014 UTC,"While I have a lot of respect for guest service TMs, I have to say no. They don't do any more work than cashiers do. Sure, they're usually the ones getting yelled at daily by guests (besides the GSAs and GSTLs) but their core roles really aren't much different from cashier."
Target,2minwr,littlecircle,5,Mon Nov 17 01:55:44 2014 UTC,almost basically the reverse role of a cashier.
Target,2minwr,meatjacket,6,Mon Nov 17 08:34:35 2014 UTC,"yes and no.   pro's for no: guest service have a ton of people who are categorized as ""trained"" but suck at it. being trained for that isn't worth a raise. we have cart attendants mostly because they're friends that we trained over there. they had time to kill so we showed them how. we have people who have been around forever and they kinda get kicked out of many work centers. they are really difficult and don't do what's needed. they can be really rude to guests. there's going to be impossible guests. you can't stoop to that level. it doesn't matter they ""hurt your feelings""  also the i don't care to figure it out. let me make up numbers/do things that are easy that lose money. you don't have your redcard? we'll give you a random # off. why didn't you figure out 5%? idk. or the its on clearance for 70% off. hey i saw this was 70% off. ok, then let me change the clearance price to 70% off that.   pro's: a good guest service saves the store tons of money. if they push gift cards, that's up to 10k in sales saved from the return desk. they help out the salesfloor. i got my shit done early enough i was always sorting carts/dealing with defects that freed them up to do more reshop. i'd super sort a block so LOD's can say while that didn't get done, at least a block was super sorted so the morning can knock it out. when we push surveys, i got some good ones because i had a lot of great moments making things right that are profitable and good for our guests.   i saved the gstl's time because i knew my shit and can quickly get through a line efficiently and cleanly. they rarely had to come over when i'm there. if i didn't know, i had to figure it out on my own and did. i'm now teaching people things i had no one showed me.   its like an electronics team member. you don't upsell get attachments/srp you don't stay there. guest service though.. you're just kicked back to cashier and still spend a lot of time at the desk."
Target,2minwr,monkeyman80,6,Mon Nov 17 03:27:37 2014 UTC,"I think so. There's a lot more you need to remember and, at my store at least, you frequently have to fix mistakes that cashiers make. In addition to everything cashiers know, you also have to understand and fix the registry kiosks, the registry scanners, the myGo app, how to do defectives, how to do returns/exchanges/etc."
Target,2minwr,itsamutiny,4,Mon Nov 17 02:49:24 2014 UTC,"Not to mention have a good general knowledge of where every item in the store belongs in which department. Sure you can look it up, but that kills time. Then the sales floor loses their shit finding a dollar spot toy in their electronics basket."
Target,2minwr,ChocolatePopes,2,Mon Nov 17 07:22:15 2014 UTC,"While over time you might have an understanding of what sort basket an item goes into, this is because many of the new guest service TMs simply use the sort function on the register to know what basket it goes into. Most guest service TMs I know don't have much of an idea where things in the store other than generally in toys or HBA."
Target,2minwr,littlecircle,4,Mon Nov 17 08:43:18 2014 UTC,"imo cashiers should be knowledgeable enough to be able to fix their own mistakes and save everyone the trouble   ex: a guest comes up to a cashier after they paid w receipt in hand saying ""this item was listed as $9.99 but it rang up for $14.99"". It's a simple fix of scanning the receipt and K6/fix mistake that they could quickly do right there, so there's no need to send the guest to guest services for such a small fix.   by that logic, should someone who knows cashier lanes and guest services get paid even more?"
Target,2minwr,meatjacket,2,Mon Nov 17 08:32:18 2014 UTC,"imo cashiers should be knowledgeable enough to be able to fix their own mistakes and save everyone the trouble ex: a guest comes up to a cashier after they paid w receipt in hand saying ""this item was listed as $9.99 but it rang up for $14.99"".

Yes, I completely agree. That is not, however, what actually happens."
Target,2minwr,itsamutiny,3,Tue Nov 18 17:46:59 2014 UTC,"No, based on what the core roles are as a guest service TM. To be blunt the position doesn't take anymore skill to do than cashiering. You just have to know/remember a several more things than a cashier.  I can understand where this question is coming from. Guest services can be stressful and demanding but if you think the position should pay more, then either you as an individual are working above and beyond or something at a store level is happening that is causing the job to be more difficult"
Target,2minwr,rykerman33,2,Mon Nov 17 07:59:01 2014 UTC,"This is simply not true. Cashiers never have to know anything about how to properly defect items, or how to correctly sort merchandise because this department wants theirs separate because they think they're special, or because all of the seasonal stuff still says it's in cart 3 but it's really been moved to an endcap by toys, or how to use the MyGo app, or how to fix label printers, or how to calm down a guest who's been on the phone with this department and that department and nobody seems to know wtf is going on with their transaction, or how to get photo orders ready (if the desk is next to the lab like it is in my store), or how to sort ESIM, or how to audit the CRC and ERecycle boxes (or probably even know what those are). I could go on. There is no comparison to be made between the two positions, if you're doing them correctly."
Target,2minwr,babythulu,2,Thu Nov 20 09:44:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I think so. I'd say a 25¢-50¢ increase.  Cashier is what I consider the very base job almost anyone can do. Next to that is cart attendant which is more labor entailed, then GS. GS requires the right judgment to make your calls and what can/cannot be returned, following correct procedure, and taking care of the nearby machines (Kodak Picture Maker, Registry, PDAs for registry and TMs). You're responsible for sorting things correctly for reshop and for returns, such could get tricky, and communicate with BR on online orders and such. You have to remember a lot of little things, to make sure the job is done right and maximize the profit, and minimize return (I.e. ""instead of returning this item, would you like to do an even exchange now or have the value on a gift card so you can use your credit immediately instead of waiting three days to get back on your card?"")"
Target,2minwr,DoomedJanissary,1 point,Mon Nov 17 04:41:38 2014 UTC,"Yes. Electronics gets paid more (.50 at my store) than GS, cashier, sales floor, cart attendant. I feel that guest service does about as much as electronics"
Target,2minwr,siiberiia,1 point,Mon Nov 17 03:05:11 2014 UTC,Electronics gets that raise I think because they are expected to memorize a lot of product knowledge. That takes a lot of specialization and so a raise is warranted. Where GS all you need to know are policy's which are pretty simple to remember IMO.
Target,2minwr,IronOreAgate,1 point,Mon Nov 17 21:57:58 2014 UTC,"I want to say yes, but I think it depends on the store as far as how the guest service team members are utilized? Having worked as a cashier -> someone who filled in on the service desk as needed -> to a guest service team member at my new store, I can definitely say that that the expectations and responsibilities are increased. At my new store, the GSTL presence is pretty minimal (like, I know you guys have a lot of shit to do but seriously, where do you go all day?) so I become the next authority figure over the front end.   I mean, I guess you could look at it this way. The average cashier doesn't have to deal with a growing pile of defects, reshop to sort, a line full of customers with problems ranging from 20 seconds to deal with to 10 minutes, a phone ringing, and someone's light blinking because they need a DPCI or for you to tell them to adjust the price down a dollar. It can be stressful. But I also think this is where store differences come into play because the one I'm at right now is certainly less organized."
Target,2minwr,seattlantis,1 point,Mon Nov 17 05:53:36 2014 UTC,"I think they should make slightly more... Maybe .15 or .25 an hour? Between having to process defectives and handle registry kiosks plus guest complaints and yelling, the position is more demanding imo."
Target,2mitjh,AlmostLonely,4,Mon Nov 17 02:40:51 2014 UTC,It's a shift differential so every team member who works between 12am-8am gets it. I don't think Supers pay more in general though.
Target,2mitjh,awkwardkatie,2,Mon Nov 17 03:08:10 2014 UTC,"I would double check on the shift differential. It's changed a lot over the years (window getting smaller), and some stores don't even have it anymore."
Target,2mitjh,Impy101001,3,Mon Nov 17 23:56:07 2014 UTC,Yeah it has to do with what competitors in the area are paying.  The fact that it is a supertarget is irrelevant. That dollar is the shift differential as the other commenters have noted.
Target,2mitjh,slutbutt_sloptart,3,Mon Nov 17 06:58:27 2014 UTC,The wage shift is from 10pm-8am at my store.
Target,2mitjh,SanltarYNAPkin,2,Mon Nov 17 16:02:16 2014 UTC,Ditto.
Target,2mitjh,FenrirSM,2,Mon Nov 17 17:06:14 2014 UTC,"When I transferred from my old store, it was a pfresh, and the start pay for flow was 8.00. My new store was a super target in another state, and theirs was 8.75. More recently they went up to 9.00. It was different in my experience, but it really all just depends on the individual stores I think."
Target,2mitjh,AuroraCloud,2,Mon Nov 17 03:41:54 2014 UTC,"If you work before 6 AM, you get an extra $1/hour. As for the general pay, not sure about that. It's all regional."
Target,2mi2u6,iamahorror,3,Sun Nov 16 22:20:05 2014 UTC,nah dude i only got one interview and i got the job (had it over a year now)  did they give you that drug test thing
Target,2mi2u6,meatjacket,1 point,Sun Nov 16 23:24:08 2014 UTC,No drug test. I had the one interview and that was it.
Target,2mi2u6,definiteangel,2,Mon Nov 17 03:13:57 2014 UTC,"If they just sent you on your way, then that means that you didn't make it. Sorry :("
Target,2mi2u6,FenrirSM,2,Mon Nov 17 01:57:59 2014 UTC,"Okay, no big deal. I have a few other things that might pan out, just didn't want to think about it. Thanks though!"
Target,2mi2u6,DoomedJanissary,2,Mon Nov 17 03:16:54 2014 UTC,"Some people get one, some people get two. Some people get it then, some people get called later for it. It doesn't mean anything, good or bad."
Target,2mi2u6,DoomedJanissary,2,Mon Nov 17 02:39:13 2014 UTC,"If you did the drug test and watched they orientation video, I'd say you're good. They wouldn't bother making you do the orientation, bring your SS card, ID, and all that jazz if you didn't get it."
Target,2mi2u6,LeChiotx,3,Mon Nov 17 02:54:16 2014 UTC,No drug test. I'm not sure the video was for oriorientation it was like a promo video for the job.
Target,2mi2u6,LeChiotx,1 point,Mon Nov 17 03:17:58 2014 UTC,Aww. Shucks. Sounds a bit like they didn't want you I guess. You can call and ask to confirm though :(
Target,2mi2u6,monkeyman80,2,Mon Nov 17 04:14:37 2014 UTC,I'm sorry to say but yeah... If you didn't get called back for a second or rescheduled for one at another date means you didn't get it. Though I am very curious why they bothered to show you the video and put you on the comp if you didn't go through......  Did they say anything to you or just send you on your way?
Target,2mhov6,thatredpikmin,2,Sun Nov 16 20:09:30 2014 UTC,You can likely do an even exchange but you will not get any money back.
Target,2mhov6,itsamutiny,1 point,Sun Nov 16 20:26:29 2014 UTC,"thank you, i am not looking for money back, by even exchange i am taking the value from the one on the receipt?"
Target,2mhov6,itsamutiny,1 point,Sun Nov 16 20:41:16 2014 UTC,"Yes...ish. It will be an even exchange, but you will not get the full retail price back."
Target,2mhov6,StlStitch,1 point,Sun Nov 16 22:08:04 2014 UTC,"You can do the even exchange if it is unopened.  That has no effect on you for the price versus the new price.  However, as a better explanation to pricing and promotions.  The B2G1 actually takes the value of the 3rd game and splits the cost over both the other games, so the return value is most likely less than what you paid for the original game.  This was something spot changed to maybe a year and a half ago (if I recall correctly) for all ""Buy X and get 1"" or buy X and get a $XX gift card"" promotions.   This was to close a loophole of folks returning stuff at full value and keeping the discounted or free merch.  Very similar to the problem we are having with fraudulent couponers at some of our stores.  And yes, select stores are required to follow the coupon policy to the letter no vibe allowed on it because of the amount of abuse in those districts and/or stores."
Target,2mhov6,StlStitch,1 point,Sun Nov 16 22:50:57 2014 UTC,"thanks for the detailed explaination, i am looking at the receipt and it does say 39.99 for each of the games for refund value. I am not looking for refund so that shouldn't matter to me.  as for exchange for another game, here is my situation: I have 3 games from the deal (sunset, forza, destiny) I want to get fifa but it is onsale during blackfriday for 35. There is a chance it would sell out and I miss the deal, so my plan is keep destiny sealed until after black friday, if i am able to get fifa great, if not i will exchange destiny for fifa.   the problem is im afraid destiny would receive a permanent price drop (maybe to $50) then i wont be able to exchange it for a $60 dollar game"
Target,2mibtz,blazenx,2,Sun Nov 16 23:46:46 2014 UTC,"Not sure why this is, both Targets I have worked at have encouraged exchanging games for ones that come out the following week. It's a ""hey, it's not their fault Target didn't do this sale one week later"" mentality."
Target,2mibtz,Macasaurus,-1,Mon Nov 17 00:30:40 2014 UTC,It's not within store policy to even exchange a $40 item for a $60 item. The sale was last week and not this week for a reason
Target,2mibtz,blex64,-4,Mon Nov 17 23:06:25 2014 UTC,We have folks who try to abuse the system....not on my watch...
Target,2mibtz,AforAnarchist,6,Mon Nov 17 00:35:40 2014 UTC,"They are following the refund policy, who are you to deny that"
Target,2mibtz,monkeyman80,3,Mon Nov 17 02:05:03 2014 UTC,exactly. if its new and unopened. they are entitled to an even exchange for a similar price item. even if they buy a 49.99 dollar game with the promo we can give them a 59.99 within target best practice.   you're denying them a legit return. abuse is having our guests get/save money from our polices.
Target,2mibtz,definiteangel,2,Mon Nov 17 03:45:38 2014 UTC,Why? You'll end up just being told to vibe it with guests anyways.
Target,2mibtz,DoomedJanissary,-1,Mon Nov 17 01:57:12 2014 UTC,"How can they do an even exchange on a sale when that item wasn't in the system at the time of sale?!  That's ""not following the vibe,"" it's literally following the return policy. Good for you! People need to learn!"
Target,2mibtz,monkeyman80,1 point,Mon Nov 17 02:40:46 2014 UTC,do you even guest service?
Target,2mibtz,DoomedJanissary,1 point,Mon Nov 17 03:41:26 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I did. I don't want guest to take advantage of the service desk though, there's limits.  Target does these sales before big releases on purpose, other wise they would have done it in the next week.   Edit: Just to be clear, I don't care if they return it and get their $40 back (that was originally priced $60 as the receipt states), it's if they try to exchange another $60 valued game for another $60 valued game that wasn't in the system at the time of sale."
Target,2mibtz,monkeyman80,1 point,Mon Nov 17 04:17:57 2014 UTC,"scan receipt. press even exchange. scan return. press total. scan new.   yes in the grand scheme they time it so they don't have the game that people will pay full price in massive amounts during a promotion. that's not guest service's discretion. you do what's available to the guest.  you don't create your own rules because its against the spirit of the rule. and even so, right now we don't have strict rules about anything. its always in generalizations.   if you think this is a big deal, look at coupons as of a few years ago that are currently a deal. manufacturers release coupons on sunday. occasionally we partner to make store coupons to make a really good deal. we think that's the end. coupons don't have a 1 week duration, people hold on to them for the best possible combination of sales/coupons/promotions. they can easily get paid for buying items. then they can return the items and get to keep the overage and the coupon value. go through all the stores in a day, with about 5 of the large bags worth of health and beauty items, that's a decent #."

Target,2m82jv,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,1 point,Fri Nov 14 11:19:42 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  Usually you can get a gift receipt when buying in person so that the recipient doesn't know the price until they decide to return it.

Target,2m6rl9,Macasaurus,5,Thu Nov 13 15:58:15 2014 UTC,"The ""loophole"" with the B2G1 is that stores will typically let you exchange one game for another. Say you bought Destiny, Cod, and Halo. You could come back to the store within the return period and exchange Halo for GTA, but there wouldn't be any refund processed at any time, aka there wouldn't be an opportunity for you to use your voucher.   You could straightup RETURN Halo and receive the $40 and some change on a gift card, then go buy GTA with your voucher, essentially leaving you with a little over $10 on a gift card."

Target,2m4ngh,munkymedic,2,Thu Nov 13 01:13:29 2014 UTC,THIS! I am a Consumables TL and I cant believe how many huge cooler/freezer pulls that never go to the floor I get. Anytime you backstock it gets pulled the next morning!
Target,2m4ngh,dasfeiz,5,Thu Nov 13 01:49:03 2014 UTC,The FDC truck needs to he backstocked basically immediately after Flow gets done with it otherwise it'll pull
Target,2m4ngh,munkymedic,2,Thu Nov 13 02:09:47 2014 UTC,Flow pushes your food truck? wha??
Target,2m4ngh,rykerman33,2,Thu Nov 13 02:48:04 2014 UTC,Our store is outrageously understaffed
Target,2m4ngh,munkymedic,2,Thu Nov 13 03:14:38 2014 UTC,Flow is supposed to handle FDC trucks. It just almost never happened at my store
Target,2m4ngh,rykerman33,3,Thu Nov 13 03:30:38 2014 UTC,I was going to say I thought it was flows job in the first place (I am a flow TM)..
Target,2m4ngh,SanltarYNAPkin,2,Thu Nov 13 03:52:22 2014 UTC,Ohhh well they usually don't finish our trucks and then back stock sits and then it pulls when backstocked
Target,2m4ngh,munkymedic,2,Thu Nov 13 03:45:44 2014 UTC,"They should be pushing all trucks, thats why they are for."
Target,2m4ngh,AforAnarchist,3,Thu Nov 13 22:35:56 2014 UTC,"I had this problem in my coolers too. Have you talked to your etl-log or BR TL about this? Ask them about item accumulator.  The fix for this is to have whoever is backstocking for you SUBT 99 and then enter the amount left as the amount that was just backstocked.   example I want to backstock a case of juice(6 eaches). STO 6, SUBT 99, prompt for how many are left in LOC, enter 6"
Target,2m4ngh,rykerman33,1 point,Thu Nov 13 03:08:11 2014 UTC,Doesnt't that charge you an error?
Target,2m4ngh,karmasink,2,Thu Nov 13 08:26:20 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure if you mean an individual TMs metrics or the stores but I would talk to your BR-TL or ETL-LOG before doing this. I was mentioning this to the CTL because while its technically bad it is a problem that otherwise could only be fixed by spending more payroll. The accumulator being off can be caused by several things. Push/BS not being done in a timely manner, bad instocks scans, inaccurate salesfloor capacities . subt99 is just a reset giving you time to figure out where the problem is coming from."
Target,2m4ngh,rykerman33,3,Thu Nov 13 09:21:16 2014 UTC,"yup, all day every day."
Target,2m4ngh,bloodsh0t5,3,Thu Nov 13 02:22:00 2014 UTC,"To fix this, you can't sto. You need to subt. Subt 9999 makes sure we don't see stuff fall right back out in batches. Really does wonders for pfresh pulls"
Target,2m4ngh,BaroqueSampson,1 point,Thu Nov 13 04:28:43 2014 UTC,"So wait, that's for when you backstock it right? So what if you encounter it in a caf pull, should you just immediately sub 9999 it or backstock it then and there?"
Target,2m4ngh,BaroqueSampson,2,Thu Nov 13 18:26:06 2014 UTC,"We pull it and subt it back in. But our store is understaffed, too small, and we do $120k a day. We don't have the time or the manpower to deal with the system's bullshit."
Target,2m4ngh,wetstein22,3,Thu Nov 13 19:29:33 2014 UTC,Every fucking day... especially after I backstock food trucks...
Target,2m4ngh,Andis1,2,Thu Nov 13 08:33:27 2014 UTC,"This is not a ""glitch"" in the CAFs but rather (typically) an issue with item capacities on your salesfloor. The system tracks how many items you have on hand, versus how many are in the backroom, and compares it to the capacity of how many can fit on the shelf. If the system thinks that more can fit on the salesfloor, it will tell you to pull them."
Target,2m4ngh,BaroqueSampson,1 point,Sun Nov 16 05:22:07 2014 UTC,Disney Infinity 2.0 sets with barely enough room for one facing. Floor capacity in the system: 7. Honeycrisp apples that sell so fast we can barely keep them on the floor. Floor capacity in the system: 3. FFFFFFFFFF
Target,2m4ngh,Andis1,1 point,Sun Nov 16 15:36:09 2014 UTC,You can my support these things and they'll get fixed. :)
Target,2m4ngh,bucsfann20,1 point,Sun Nov 16 18:10:33 2014 UTC,Not a glitch. Literally every day.
Target,2m4ngh,zieen,1 point,Thu Nov 13 01:24:58 2014 UTC,Are the accumulators just messed up? Does it still pull everything if you SUBT9999 everything?
Target,2m4ngh,wetstein22,1 point,Thu Nov 13 02:03:35 2014 UTC,What's subt9999? Is it in rfapps?
Target,2m4ngh,zieen,2,Thu Nov 13 08:34:43 2014 UTC,"It isn't in there anymore. It's crazy you haven't been shown that.  Open SUBT in MyHome. Scan the item to back stock, scan the location you want to back stock it in. When it asks how many you pullled, say 9999. Then it will ask if you pulled all from location. Say no. Then say how many are still in the location. This will reset the sales floor accumulator for the item. For more information, look it up on workbench."
Target,2m4ngh,rykerman33,1 point,Thu Nov 13 15:25:43 2014 UTC,it has to do with the items accumulator. talk to your BR TL about it
Target,2m4ngh,joelberg,1 point,Thu Nov 13 03:09:18 2014 UTC,This has been happening for years.
Target,2m4ngh,fetalbeetles,1 point,Thu Nov 13 06:59:06 2014 UTC,"Target is testing 2 different systems to replace the sales accumulator that causes this problem. For now, we are stuck with it. As others have mentioned, there are cheats to the system, but do not do them without leadership approval because they can fuck up your instocks. Just deal with it for the time being is how my store gets by"
Target,2m40ny,MyMiddleNameSucks,1 point,Wed Nov 12 21:13:48 2014 UTC,"Just want to second this. Attendance is the single most important thing you can do. Don't be late, don't miss work. If you do, you may not have completely shot yourself in the foot... But you PROBABLY did. Hard truth.  Asking about staying on past season won't hurt you, but it probably won't help, either. If you want to stick around and are worth keeping, they'll know.  Beyond that, the only things I'd suggest that you do that hasn't already been said... Look for new opportunities to expand on what you already know. If everything is getting wrapped up and people are being sent home but you see Softlines is still pushing, ask to learn Softlines so you can help out. Express interest in learning how to backstock when the end of the day comes around. LEarn everything you can, because the more you know, the more value you have. They may tell you no, and that's okay. Just keep asking. Trust me, they'll appreciate it, even if they're not committed to having you learn something right that minute.  Also, pick up shifts. If you don't have 5 days, get 5 days. Find people who don't want to work, ask your team leads, whatever. Just make sure you are there. The more they see you, the more they think about you, and if you're doing a good job, they think good things. Also, money. That makes you money. Can't be under stated."
Target,2m40ny,FenrirSM,1 point,Wed Nov 12 22:15:58 2014 UTC,"http://www.maybury.com/liftruck/Crown/Photos/wave_open.jpg  This baby. The left part of that picture is where you stand. The black thing hanging off is where you put boxes or whatever you're pulling. It goes up pretty high and lets you reach the bulk stock on pallets. You pull however many of the product you need, place it on the black thing, then lower yourself.   Easiest way to get bulk stock down since you obviously don't want to just pull the entire pallet down to get 3 items."
Target,2m48xf,asdftyuikl,5,Wed Nov 12 22:16:48 2014 UTC,I'm surprised no one is mentioning that a rather large number of video games arrive on the overnight trucks as well. Could be there in the morning when they open.
Target,2m48xf,FenrirSM,2,Thu Nov 13 02:28:51 2014 UTC,Thanks for the answer. I had looked into online before and one of the games had appeared to be out of stock online and I believe Unity also claimed to only be in store currently. I'll make sure to call over the next few days though. Again thanks for the reply. Have a good day.
Target,2m48xf,zieen,0,Wed Nov 12 22:32:56 2014 UTC,"Most video games come via mail carriers and not from the Target distribution center, so there will frequently be midday arrivals of games, depending on when they are received/keyed into the system."
Target,2m48xf,bucsfann20,1 point,Wed Nov 12 23:01:31 2014 UTC,"Your store can use a pda and check the zdate to see if any are on their way. Seeing as it's past the release date, the shipment could come any day really. Call in the morning every day."
Target,2m48xf,fetalbeetles,1 point,Wed Nov 12 23:44:33 2014 UTC,I'll be sure to give them a call tomorrow morning. Thanks for the reply.
Target,2m48xf,zieen,0,Wed Nov 12 22:32:30 2014 UTC,Target is turning off z-dates. They are no longer reliable. The store can still look up ETA on the Inventory Tracking System
Target,2m3ysd,bearface93,4,Wed Nov 12 20:59:57 2014 UTC,"Sales floor is pretty much just stocking, zoning, and stray. They may ask you if you prefer softlines (clothes) or hardlines (everything else besides food and electronics).  Respond to lanes as much as you can. They love that. Also try to push red cards as much as possible. They REALLY love that"
Target,2m3ysd,TheThunderGnome,3,Wed Nov 12 22:05:08 2014 UTC,"Sometimes that feels like everything... just going to the line, getting a tub/flat of push, and pushing it. Except for softlines. Screw softlines. If I were to spend 1 hr pushing a single tub of softlines, I guarantee you 35 minutes were spent trying to find the tables."
Target,2m3ysd,Fr0stSoldier,2,Thu Nov 13 00:48:45 2014 UTC,I feel that. I'm usually in softlines and I can find most things within like a minute. But then the TLs set their VAs and then I'm just lost
Target,2m3ysd,TheThunderGnome,3,Thu Nov 13 02:20:42 2014 UTC,"Well in my case, I just did what your HR woman said. Just show that you really are understanding it and work ""fast, fun, and friendly."""

Target,2m183z,monkeyman80,1 point,Wed Nov 12 23:48:20 2014 UTC,depends on work center and need. quicker you pick up things the more likely you'll get the call out shifts.

Target,2m0bkl,lemonbee,6,Thu Nov 13 07:41:27 2014 UTC,"Honestly, that shirt would be perfectly fine at my store. We had this seasonal cashier wear red white and blue plaid shirt every single time I saw her."
Target,2m0bkl,Croweslen,4,Wed Nov 12 00:30:04 2014 UTC,"Man, we have ETLs in stripes at my store and one who's worn orange for three years. My STL sometimes shows up in skirts and knee high boots in fall. Think it just depends on how anal your store is about being brand. I don't blame you for picking plaid over the wrinkled shirt since they probably would have talked to you about it either way."
Target,2m0bkl,monkeyman80,2,Wed Nov 12 00:05:57 2014 UTC,Idk why. That would jave been fine in my store. Our old etl-hr used to wear plaid all the time
Target,2m0bkl,Besnasty,3,Wed Nov 12 00:35:03 2014 UTC,"it really depends on how strict your management is. we had someone buy a shirt in front of an etl saying its a work shirt. nothing said about not acceptable. same plaid idea. we have some in the bullseye shop that match it. if he wears that he needs to wear a red vest.   we have someone who dresses well, and wears might wear a black coat over a red shirt. some would prefer he wears a red vest over that.   they give you shit, say you're happy to wear red and khaki if they'll provide quality clean clothes. they can't force you to wear something they don't provide in most states. i always wore a white shirt that can be clean and a red vest over it so i have clean clothes every day. most friends would wear their one red shirt for a week. eww."
Target,2m0bkl,DoomedJanissary,3,Wed Nov 12 03:10:36 2014 UTC,"That's sucks. My store is so lenient on clothes. There's tons of various plaids/stripes/polka dots shirts that grace our store. I even wear a shirt that is supposed to be red, but looks pretty pink under our lights. Pretty much as long as its pretty much red and khakis my etls don't care....and even then I've worn seersucker pants and they didn't say anything then except cute pants."

Target,2m0bkl,Skywise87,2,Tue Nov 11 22:22:56 2014 UTC,"When I got hired even though the rulebook was pretty lax, the HR person impressed upon us that she really wanted us wearing Khakis and solid red shirts.  The reasoning for this is it just makes it abundantly clear that you are a target employee.  Like yeah you had a nametag and your shirt is still sorta red, but I think they juts want 0 ambiguity which is understandable.  If you were off before the store opened then they really shouldn't have made a fuss but it sounds like either your TL is a crazy person or you are maybe fudging some of the details."
Target,2m0bkl,initialgold,1 point,Sun Nov 16 02:59:54 2014 UTC,"This was before the store opened, and I fudged no details. I don't even necessarily disagree with the plaid rule, it's just that if the shirt absolutely 100% needs to be solid red, I want that stated clearly in our handbook."

Target,2lzrdn,AHintOfTruth,6,Wed Nov 12 00:09:15 2014 UTC,"Backroom people at my store sometimes wore solid red/black beanie hats, but that's 'cause they spend time in the coolers and freezers too. Some girls wear hair wraps and fabric bands, but that's I think the limit.   Especially if you cashier or work on the front, they take tort appearance pretty seriously.

All it means is CAF-pusher. Anything the backroom team makes and puts on the line to be pushed is what you will be doing for the day."
Target,2lxjkm,kpy33,2,Tue Nov 11 04:29:13 2014 UTC,"Oh I see. Thanks for the great help. Sorry for being ignorant, but what exactly do you mean ""puts on the line"" ? I learned how to use the little IPod scan thing today on all of the loose product.. Is it that ?"
Target,2lxjkm,kpy33,1 point,Tue Nov 11 04:34:23 2014 UTC,"Sure no problem. I'm not sure how new you are but I work sales floor (hardlines) and I regularly push the line. I'll explain what it is. All it is is the spot in your backroom where your backroom team members stick CAF''s (created auto fills) for people like me to push onto the floor. So on any given ""logistics zone"" day, I clock in and grab a PDA and walkie, I walk to the backroom, check out how much crap is on ""the line"" (area where CAF's are located) and push it until my shift is over. I hope that helps you understand, please let me know if any of those terms didn't make sense."
Target,2lxjkm,karmasink,1 point,Tue Nov 11 06:44:16 2014 UTC,"I really appreciate all of the help you've given me. I'm still a little confused though. I've only been working for 3 days, and all I've done so for is work the line(conveyor belt when the truck comes in), after that, I follow the people who pull the pallets and I start bowling out the boxes. After that, I open the boxes and stock the shelves until my shift is over. And I also know how to use the iPod thing, where you scan a loose item to find out where it goes rather than reading the schematic. That's why I'm confused. I have no clue what a CAF is, I don't know which 'line' you're referring too, since the line I know of means the conveyor belt, and I don't know what you mean by push, since to me, push means stocking the shelves."
Target,2lxjkm,dubblechzburger,1 point,Tue Nov 11 15:30:57 2014 UTC,"There are two ways the floor gets filled: directly from the truck, and from the backroom in pull batches. Pull batches are basically just a list of items that your pda sends you to and has you pull out from the backroom. CAF is a type of batch that is automatically generated (as opposed to manually generated by someone on the sales floor) and drops at regular intervals (usually every hour but it varies a little bit by store). These items are put on two tiers, tubs and flats and left in a designated area of the store (which day side refers to as the line) to be pushed out. Pushing is targets term for stocking the floor. If you've been stocking the floor for overnight you have some idea how it works but there will be differences: because the store will be open you can't have random items on the floor so don't bowl anything out. Also, you will probably have items from several departments in your cart and so you will have to move around a lot to put them all out. If you have a good backroom team then they will put departments that are close together on the floor in the same basket but there's no guarantee that will happen. You will also be using your pda a lot more at least at first because a lot of what you will be pushing will not be in cases and so it won't have dc labels on it to tell you where it goes on the floor. Hope this was helpful, good luck."
Target,2lxjkm,brokenwinds,1 point,Tue Nov 11 18:09:54 2014 UTC,"This was very helpful, thank you. Yesterday I was sort of assigned to a shopping cart filled with toys and sporting goods, which are right next to each other in my store. After I completed that cart, I moved on the C and D items, which were again in a cart. I'll assume it's basically the same thing as that. Thanks again for all the help, you saved me from worrying until next week."
Target,2lxjkm,milkhelmets,1 point,Tue Nov 11 18:27:01 2014 UTC,Just another thing that might help ya is my store doesn't call them CAFs they call them pulls. Your store might do that as well which could be why you had never heard of CAF.
Target,2lw5hi,Sicatron,9,Mon Nov 10 20:32:08 2014 UTC,I don't think the people who wrote that code will ever admit to it.  You've used a PDA and would you own up to that slapped together mishmash of gibberish?

I've mentally noted dozens of easy fixes that would increase efficiency and thus money in Targets pocket. I emailed my ETL so hopefully he can get me specific info on where I can get a hold of the software so I can start emulating.
Target,2lx1hp,wonderman911,4,Tue Nov 11 01:03:00 2014 UTC,"It completely depends on the product. Common, year-round goods, let's go with Market Pantry milk for example, likely won't change DPCIs or be discontinued, therefore there's really no reason for it to go out of the system.   Other goods, especially seasonal ones, do go out of the system once they've been clearanced/discontinued. And sometimes the same product will be carried but have a different DPCI. A recent example of this would be the Nest, as it is an electronics item and was typically carried there, but now it is located in the home improvement section and has a different DPCI."
Target,2lx1hp,littlecircle,1 point,Tue Nov 11 04:24:24 2014 UTC,we have a product that is from store open. it hasn't been clearance =d out for the latest version. it gets locked up every night and brought out every day.   as to clearance please understand it also includes sizes. everything but this is on clearance. maybe that size is the one everyone wants. we don't have a problem selling it full price. we're not giving you clearance on that  its clearance on on store not this store that's in stock. got a lot clearance. that doesn't mean its nationwide.
Target,2lx1hp,monkeyman80,1 point,Wed Nov 12 03:27:11 2014 UTC,"February is a bit of a stretch, I don't think you could return that even if you had a receipt. The usual return time is 90 days, if you bought it with a Red Card you get an extra 30 to think about it. After that, we can't take it; the system has it's limits on seasonal things and can't find a pink Valentine's Day bear plush this time around. If you scan it in item search and it says ""ITEM NOT FOUND"" and you scan with a PDA and it shows it's out of the system (selling price is at $0.00), no way you could take it. Same goes for stuff that went on clearance and we don't carry anymore; can't take it if we don't sell it.  If it's something more common like store brand diapers, still can't get the full refund with a receipt from February (expired). You'd have to do a no receipt return which you would get the lowest selling price on a gift card (so you bought these diapers for $24.99, but at some point they were on sale for $17.99, so that's all you'll get)."
Target,2lvitr,zomboni_steve,15,Mon Nov 10 17:25:03 2014 UTC,Makes me glad I live in Massachusetts where they impose massive fines on stores that decide to open on thanksgiving...Thus no stores actually open.
Target,2lvitr,Smokeeye123,4,Mon Nov 10 23:40:33 2014 UTC,That's beautiful.
Target,2lvitr,DoomedJanissary,9,Tue Nov 11 06:01:15 2014 UTC,I feel sorry for all the people I knew who are still working at Target.. It's just going to get rid of Thanksgiving all together eventually. Best of luck to everyone.
Target,2lvitr,xen0cide,6,Mon Nov 10 19:24:12 2014 UTC,"seriously, having thanksgiving on a thursday is just getting bothersome for these giant corporations. they should just do away with it altogether and have a national capitalism day! where everybody (peasants) goes out and buys overpriced(but discounted!) garbage. that way the fat cats way up the chain will have more money to line their pockets with."
Target,2lvitr,not_a_banana,4,Mon Nov 10 19:53:46 2014 UTC,Everyday is capitalism day!   Hell I left Target to get a job with holidays.  Last Monday we got an email stating we will be open every holiday including CHRISTMAS.
Target,2lvitr,Bab5crusade,5,Tue Nov 11 02:05:06 2014 UTC,I mean yeah it sucks for the family holiday aspect... But I'm not upset at all. Longer holiday pay plus over night and overtime? That paycheck is going to be lovely plus family feels sorry for me so no doing dishes or clean up during the day.
Target,2lvitr,LeChiotx,1 point,Tue Nov 11 06:03:50 2014 UTC,I'm doing the Wednesday overnight prep too. So I'll be working from 12-530am and probably 5-12 on Thanksgiving. Plus my family does Thanksgiving at noon so I won't miss that. 12ish hours of time and a half will be nice when that pay check comes in.
Target,2lvitr,dubblechzburger,2,Wed Nov 12 16:02:52 2014 UTC,"Same here on the Wednesday. Paycheck will be amazing so bring on the holiday hours!  This is the harsh reality of working retail.  If you dont want to work weekends and holidays, dont work retail.  I get more upset because I miss family time all the time by working weekends.  Maybe someone should campaign that all of retail close on Saturday and Sunday so that people who work retail can spend time with family.  That makes more sense then complaining about one day a year that your family cannot be together all day long."
Target,2lvitr,LeChiotx,4,Wed Nov 12 17:06:50 2014 UTC,No. Please no? I haven't heard anything yet at my store.

Target,2lvitr,dubblechzburger,2,Mon Nov 10 20:28:05 2014 UTC,Yeah we just do Thanksgiving with my dads side of the fam as my Mom's is out of state and we go to our aunt's house but they do Thanksgiving with the other side of their family too so we're usually eating by 1130/noon and are home by 3 or 4. So not the end of the world for me.  Plus I miraculously got the rest of the weekend approved for time off so I got that to look forward too.
Target,2lvitr,PlatyProfits,1 point,Wed Nov 12 16:00:38 2014 UTC,I volunteered to work opening for 8 because I like to hope that I end up with friday or saturday.  Good for you mate. Enjoy that weekend

Target,2lvdx9,doxxmyself,2,Mon Nov 10 16:53:38 2014 UTC,"Paydays are on Friday, so it's unlikely that it would be two weeks from the Thursday I worked.  If the pay period runs two weeks - was Thursday the 6th part of a pay period that runs from Sunday November 2nd to Saturday November 15th? Or is it part of a pay period that runs from Sunday October 26th through Saturday November 8th?"

Target,2ltzy6,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,1 point,Tue Nov 11 02:49:43 2014 UTC,CE? but do you know if they will have it for sale in store on the day of release? i wanna use it in the buy 2 games get 1 free promotion
Target,2ltzy6,LeChiotx,1 point,Tue Nov 11 02:57:32 2014 UTC,"CE is short for collector's edition. Some stores get one, some don't. Every store should get at least a few of the standard. The DPCI is 207-28-1133 for the standard edition and 207-28-1226 for the CE. You could probably call your store (Wednesday night) with the DPCI of the one you want be ask them how many they have in stock. They might tell you, they might not.  Hope this helps"
Target,2ltzy6,LeChiotx,1 point,Tue Nov 11 03:33:38 2014 UTC,I know at my store midweek releases (ie- not on tune in Tuesday) depends on if FedEx delivers on time. When Smash Brothers came out we didn't get any copies until 4pm.

Target,2ltzy6,dubblechzburger,2,Tue Nov 11 06:56:23 2014 UTC,"Suppose to be carrying it - YES  actually carrying - no idea as everyone has said, since we can't predict the future of the common ""unfortunate events of Target"""

You have to be off, on break, or lunch - pretty much you have to wait in line just like everyone else. If you hide things until you can get it, you can face some big trouble. Better to try to get a family or friend to buy it for you if you're working.  Be warned though, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR DISCOUNT CARD - you can get terminated for that! Unless it's you or your spouse (married), no one else can use that discount, not even technically your mom (I had my old Target that didn't care, and another Target my sister worked at that she got warned to not do again).  Target is super strict around the holidays - I've seen AP talk to fellow TMs that their debit card and discount card names didn't match and got coached for abusing discounts."

Then a few weeks ago they hired a PA,  which is above a TM and on a higher pay grade... they're doing a good job but when comparing workloads we found out that we have the exact same workload.

If you really like something, it's best to not wait until clearance time, the best stuff gets taken first and we only get limited quantity to begin with being a seasonal item.  If you're lucky, someone probably has 'em on CL a bit pricier, but that's all I can think of."

Target,2ldw8q,wetstein22,1 point,Wed Nov 5 18:34:06 2014 UTC,Looks like you missed the timeframe on these.. You could get about the same effect with these lights and these light stakes. You can probably find different color bulbs if you didn't want  orange.
Target,2ldaqu,SirFartsinHand,3,Wed Nov 5 14:35:57 2014 UTC,"I sit down and go through the list before I even start looking for things. Identify vendor product that should not have been scanned. Find high volume items (batteries etc) that are easily missed and can safely be assumed are close enough to the original count (I won't track down batteries until we scanned less than 50). Look for high count discrepancies (missing 70 bottles of Advil for example)  and make sure they aren't sitting in a shipper off location. Also search for input errors, such as we should have 7 on hand, but we scanned 77. Most likely just human/PDA error and safe to research back to 7 (or whatever is currently on hand).  After that, I find all of the high dollar items that absolutely must be looked into and highlight them. Try and track them down on the sales floor first. Odds are the count error is either a result of bad zone or a mispick.  A good way to check for mispicks is to check the counts on similar items. If I should have 3 bluray players, but I have zero, and should have 3 DVD players of the same brand, but have 6, there's a good chance there was an error on the DCs part somewhere. After that check to make sure anything that isn't found isn't off location in the backroom.   If I'm still missing high dollar items, partner with AP to make sure it wasn't theft and pass it off to them if they want to look into it further.  Once I've done my initial look over and checked the high value items, I'll look for common mistakes and areas with bad zone. It's frequently a matter of finding all the items on the wrong peghooks or pushed into the next items location. If I'm running low on time and the deadline is coming up, I'll key the item in item search to see if the count has changed. If we should have 7, but scanned 0 and we now have 4, odds are in favor of bad zone. I'll research the item to the current count and we'll look into next time it pops up on drastics.  Sorry about the formatting and any errors. I've typed this on my phone."
Target,2ldaqu,zieen,1 point,Thu Nov 6 19:50:21 2014 UTC,"Hey thanks a shit-ton for this reply, it sounds like a great way to do the count. Much appreciated!"
Target,2ldaqu,aetraega,2,Thu Nov 6 20:11:25 2014 UTC,"If you manage to get the drastic count completed and then keep up with it every week, it usually isn't too bad. As far as process for actually completing it, there isn't really a very efficient way of doing it. Usually what I do is just look on the floor at all tied locations, ask the TL in the area if they have any flexed endcaps with the product, check the reshop to make sure it's not there, and then look in the backroom. There's no efficient way that I've found, besides being mindful of everything on the list in case you find it while looking for other stuff."
Target,2ldaqu,aetraega,1 point,Wed Nov 5 21:07:49 2014 UTC,"Ok thanks...this is basically what I've been doing. It's just difficult because our backroom is quite behind and there are piles of backstock to look through. I've been checking tied locations, and then aimlessly wandering the backroom hoping to find maybe a few things on my list. It just feels like I'm wasting my time and just wandering around too much."
Target,2ldaqu,Croweslen,1 point,Thu Nov 6 01:30:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah, doing the drastic count is one of the worst, most tedious processes in my opinion. You should ask your leader about it though, because at my store they ask you to just zero it out after you've done your due diligence looking around for it. That way, you can just zero it out and move on instead of getting stuck looking for one item all day."
Target,2ldaqu,franick1987,1 point,Thu Nov 6 01:43:47 2014 UTC,Im confused to your question. Do you mean ways of actually doing the count?

Target,2lcedr,Lactosemucus,5,Wed Nov 5 06:12:10 2014 UTC,"Do your GSTL/GSAs not call price checks? I've NEVER heard of cashiers being told to call the operator for anything except overhead pages.  For items not having barcodes, and this is gonna sound crazy, try looking it up on the Target app on your phone. I used to do that before the Ipods were a thing, and I could usually find a DPCI on target.com in under a minute.  As for price checks. Try scanning it on price inquiry. If the ""return without receipt"" price is the same as what the guest says, it's probably a missed sign. And if the challenge is within reason (~10%) Just go ahead and change it."
Target,2lcedr,Cyan_Ottercat,1 point,Wed Nov 5 06:40:44 2014 UTC,"Never thought of using my phone. That might help actually.  And yes, we constantly call the operator. If the GSTLs are busy or cannot be found, this is our ""go to"" practice.  If the prices stay within the 5 dollar limit I usually just change it. But if it's any higher I have to ask.  Thanks for the advise!"
Target,2lcedr,Cyan_Ottercat,2,Wed Nov 5 06:57:48 2014 UTC,"GSTLs that vanish bother me. One of ours will go hide in TMC for hours at a time. One of the main points of their position is to ensure the lanes operate smoothly.  And the phone thing works amazingly well. As long as you don't need to input a size/color/pattern difference, you can have a DPCI in 30 seconds."
Target,2lcedr,monkeyman80,3,Wed Nov 5 07:55:17 2014 UTC,"They have a ton of responsibilities over front END, not just lanes. To some people they might be hiding.

Inventory and order supplies. Hey you need to call csc and get your shit working. If they're sitting on their ass that's one thing. Not being visible doesn't mean that they aren't busting ass"
Target,2lcedr,zieen,2,Fri Nov 7 11:00:55 2014 UTC,"For size and color, just select those options and add the item to your cart. You can then select the product in your cart and it will give you the dpci."

Target,2lcedr,rh51too,4,Thu Nov 6 13:32:29 2014 UTC,"I work in a super low volume store and usually work electronics and hardlines myself, the easiest way would go something like this:  You: Hardlines come in.  Me: This is hardlines go ahead.  You: I need a price check on 'item' with a brief explanation.   I can usually get a dpci within a minute. Might differ from store to store. Usually have the cashier switch to channel 3 (2 is the backroom designated channel.)  Also if its within 5-10 dollars we usually just have the cashier use change amount and use the 'guest price challenge' option. Because we can identify the reason the guest thought it was this price when we do the price audit report or PCV as you might of heard it. With stores being graded on guest survey, keeping the guest happy and not waiting is more important than a few dollars in sales."

But for a price check, I typically address the department the item is most likely from. So for Fruit Loops, for example, I'll say ""Hey market, can you go to 2?"" (always go to channel 2, 3, or 4 for things like this) then, once you're on the channel you directed them to ask something along the lines of ""do you know how much Fruit Loops are?"" or ""What is the price for Fruit Loops?""

Target,2lcedr,itsamutiny,2,Wed Nov 5 06:46:40 2014 UTC,"it depends on what's available to your store equipment wise and what your gstl's are tasked with.  no barcodes? the gstl should be able to find it. we used to do what you were told but with my device and the improved target app we can find it quicker than people finding it.   wrong price? take their word for it within your stores guidelines. we make the guest happy and see if the signs are actually wrong. 99% of the time, its ""it said i got a gift card"" no its if you buy this and that, or got enough.   wic? you should have a folder on your lane that has every acceptable dpci. you can see right away what's acceptable and what's not. sara lee whole wheat 16 oz bread isn't ringing up? oh its the 14 oz tht is. now they are responsible for getting the correct items, its up to your front end if you want to get a team member to get the right items. i'd LIKE to have them leave and get the right items.   also tips for a cashier: never hand type any payment into the register. it needs to scan/swipe. we only allow scanning cartwheel/shopkick/target mobile app. groupon offers a target gc? they redeem it through the target mobile."

Generally being sent home after two interviews means one of two things:   Your interview did not go well and you won't be hired, or Your interview went very well and they need to speak with their STL/DTL about hiring you on as a TL instead."

Target,2lab5s,Andis1,2,Wed Nov 5 12:52:03 2014 UTC,"Honestly, that depends on the HR. Give the store you applied to a call and ask to speak to the HR, and explain what you want. Most of the time, they keeep the good seasonal hires on permanently"

These people go from store to store to get away with it, I had a store that actually got a few stopped.  Subtly call GSTL/AP over doing the transaction, or tell them the time, place, register the transaction is done. Anything helps.   It's theft, say something!"
Target,2l8sa1,DoomedJanissary,2,Tue Nov 4 15:15:47 2014 UTC,"I""ve been told that if they have the method of payment, there is nothing we can do AP wise. Because technically they paid for it, and since target gets paid for the coupon value, Target isn't losing anything. Its just those people that are gaining money. Cause trust me... I would love to call over our AP and have him deal with the couponers."
Target,2l8sa1,SoulCrystal,6,Tue Nov 4 15:42:50 2014 UTC,This is an AP matter because it's the if. why? Because it's a form of double dipping. The coupon was taken for the transaction we are getting REIMBURSED FOR THAT ONE. when they return it to comes out of Targets pocket. Our AP has many cases open on people like this and has already gone after one on thief charges. Perhaps different states view things different but in MD it's thief.  The best thing to do is keep track of people and their habits. Attempt to stop them at the register before the returns (even though if they are anything like the ones in my area they buy at one store and return at another). When you do have one be stern and let them know that policies are changing and that you dont know in the future if they will be able to do this type of return anymore. Partner with your GE and AP on their point of views on this. I understanding VIBING but no these types of couponers are thieves and they know exactly what they are doing.
Target,2l8sa1,LeChiotx,3,Tue Nov 4 16:58:46 2014 UTC,"when they return it, we still get reimbursed. that's why we refund them the full purchase price. nothing is coming out of targets pocket more than any return. they get to make the difference usually on a gift card."
Target,2l8sa1,monkeyman80,2,Wed Nov 5 02:27:06 2014 UTC,"I'll talk to my AP and see if there is anything he/we can do. It is very frustrating from a service desk stand point because when they use the gift card, they get at least $100-$200 back in cash, and then another $200 back on the giftcard."
Target,2l8sa1,SoulCrystal,3,Tue Nov 4 18:18:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah I know. I'm a GSTL I hate it. Though worse part is that they think they are out smarting us and it's like ""no we know you're full of shit and stealing but at the moment I can just smile and let you""  And people wonder why coupon policies are getting stricter and stricter"
Target,2l8sa1,LeChiotx,2,Tue Nov 4 20:33:21 2014 UTC,"I can pretty much tell you that unless the coupons are fake that it's not worth APs time. Target takes almost zero losses on coupons. When people do coupon return fraud, the manufacturer coupons get reimbursed to us still, so the issuing company is the one taking the loss. Furthermore, those company's have not changed their own practices at all, and therefore are clearly still profitable. Realistically, the biggest advantage to getting a couponer out of the store is that you prevent them from continuing to waste your time."
Target,2l8sa1,Andis1,3,Tue Nov 4 20:38:34 2014 UTC,"Wow. Really? Maybe where I used to live in Miami, that happens three times a day so they always encouraged us to stop it and tell the cashiers to take their time and make sure coupons match with crazy couponers. It sucks how people take advantage of the system :/"
Target,2l8sa1,DoomedJanissary,3,Tue Nov 4 16:05:50 2014 UTC,The best thing to do is strictly follow the coupon policy. Their goal is to get us to take coupons that should be denied so they make money. If you follow the policy to the letter they should end up getting little to nothing.
Target,2l8sa1,blex64,3,Tue Nov 4 16:42:26 2014 UTC,"We can stop them at check out by making sure the rules of the coupons are followed (limit of 4 identical coupons per transaction), but when they do returns the machine won't let us override how much they're getting back. Because i would love to lower the price so they get back what they paid."
Target,2l8sa1,SoulCrystal,2,Tue Nov 4 18:17:12 2014 UTC,"it'll help ap review, but we can't refuse it."
Target,2l8sa1,monkeyman80,2,Wed Nov 5 02:27:31 2014 UTC,"our store keeps changing the rules, and the people returning just go with what the store does.   each has their own pattern. card look up, gift receipts, or they'll give you the receipt then snatch it out of your hand after you scan it.  technically we get reimbursed for the purchase so we are making money off them returning a coupon item. i get that part. i also get you're here every week with crap you never intended to keep and have no use for the coupon if you don't get the value of it back when you return it.   i'd also say i love the way some people cash out their hundreds of gift cards. buy 2 expensive tablets, pay half cash, half gift card. system will always prompt cash back for both returns."
Target,2l8sa1,monkeyman80,1 point,Wed Nov 5 02:25:02 2014 UTC,"AP here.  Target's recent Vibe policy changed a lot of things. Most stores took it as 100% acceptance. That's not the case. Some one has an expired coupon? Take it. A coupon for an item that we are out of, but the volume matches? Take it. This is one or two instances per transaction. Not fifty expired coupons. Talk to your GSA and TL. Get everyone on the same page. Target does get their money back, but the returns have a huge effect on the store. We lose products that guest come in to shop for every day. One super couponer wiped us out on deodorant. Guess how many guest came in for that sale? We also have to spend time restocking it.  This is what I tell my team. Take one and two, as long as the volumes match. If a super couponer comes in, they do not get the same deal. One or two is all you can accept. Also, if you void out the merchandise, you must void out the coupon."
Target,2l8sa1,Hero4sale85,1 point,Wed Nov 5 08:35:00 2014 UTC,"honestly at our store, we do not return A block items (usually what they end up bringing in/couponing) unless they have a receipt. no card lookup, no using their ID. We need a receipt.   (really you somehow lost the receipt for 8 tubs of tide and want to return them all? how realistic is this supposed to be?)  also to prevent this, try to have the cashier be knowledgeable about couponers and how to deal with them. Often times the coupon is not for the item they have but they know it works anyways (buying the $1 trial size item and having a coupon for $3 off the full size bottle) Ask your LOD or gstl"
Target,2l8sa1,meatjacket,1 point,Wed Nov 5 13:52:03 2014 UTC,"After reading the other comments, I should state that two weeks ago the gstl denied a guest the use of several coupons with a legit reason.  They bombarded the 800 # and surveys and scores went from high green to red in a week.  It prompted a visit from our Dtl.  Now we take any coupon unless it's altered and return anything with gift cards,gift receipts, anything.  These folks know exactly what they're doing and they have no shame at all."
Target,2l8sa1,desertcoyote77,1 point,Thu Nov 6 15:35:23 2014 UTC,It is common. I tell people about these couponers and they get excited about the prospect of getting free stuff until they realize it is 10% stacking coupons and 90% being an asshole.
Target,2l8sa1,franick1987,1 point,Thu Nov 20 04:08:49 2014 UTC,"One quick tip to prevent hassle is to count the coupons as you are scanning them, and say ""X amount of coupons, is that right?"" and confirm with guests. I have had guests say I missed a scan and took the coupon away from them. They usually request to get a FULL refund back on said item."

You'll also have side-jobs pop up to distract you from your main task such as backing up on the checklanes or helping a guest find something. Make sure to squeeze it in to your little reports when they ask! For example, if a leader asks how far you are when you're zoning toys and you've recently gone up to back up on the checklanes, say ""I'm just getting back from the checklanes so I'm only on aisle x."" With all of the new people in the store, it's hard for everyone to keep up with who's doing what, so try your best to represent yourself well!"
Target,2l8huo,ForzaEc,1 point,Tue Nov 4 06:55:54 2014 UTC,"Offer to cross train as much as possible as well as when they call and ask you to come in, do it. That is if you want to stay pass 4th quarter. The more you have to offer and the better team player you are the more they will want to keep you and you'll get your hours. Biggest thing though never make excuses. You will be busy, pulled from one side of the store to the other, just breath and work through it and if you don't complete a take explain how you plan on getting it down AT THAT MOMENT vs why its not done if that makes sense. Good luck!!!!"

Target,2l8abo,yeeeeet,6,Tue Nov 4 04:06:08 2014 UTC,That's not a Target decision. I'm guessing your store is not meeting payroll and is having to force high expectations. Do your best to finish your reshop. They can't really coach or CA you for not finishing.

And of course next to softlines, you are their #1 person to call for back up.  In my store(s), the person that was coming back from lunch/break in their area is responsible for collecting their stuff. Since technically your a CA, you don't generally have a PDA to quickly return stuff to their right place(s), it's harder for you and would take much longer.  Are you in school?

Reshop is created when a guest picks something up and decides they don't want it. Due to the laws of nature, the chances of the guest putting it back in the home are about 0.000785% and it's salesfloor's responsibility to pick it up and rework it to the shelf. Half the time, it just gets tossed into the backroom."

But mispicks is a metric they track. Xmas time is busy, sometimes forced overtime.  They have never made us work xmas or xmas eve.  We have AP, only time you see them is when you walk into or out of the warehouse, which is only once a day, you are not allowed out during your shift.  They also will do random checks on locations of items.  I make double what you do as a warehouse worker, but the average outbound worker lifts 4500 boxes a day, warehouse and inbound lift 2000.  We get a full extra day of pay for xmas, new years, july fourth, thanksgiving, labor day, and memorial day.  And if we work on those days we get time and a half.  We get overtime opportunities in the winter and voluntary leave of absence (non-paid time off) in the spring if we want it.  We get about 16 paid days off in a year, which when you work 4 10 hour days in a week is a months time off."
Target,2l3ler,Jsin14,2,Mon Nov 3 15:36:39 2014 UTC,We BEG for overtime in a store and never get it. We constaly have our hours cut. Unless you are an ETL (manager) you do not get paid holidays. You guys have it made.

Our volumes rise every single week, 2 weeks ago is was 800,000 cartons a week and by black friday it'll be upwards of 975,000. Cool perk, dont have to deal with the public!"
Target,2l3ler,Jsin14,3,Mon Nov 3 18:37:22 2014 UTC,Haha! Nothing but complaints in here! I hope you expected it... we get some pretty shitty loading in our trailers sometimes.   So. Some questions.  Do they do drug testing before hiring people in the dc?!?  How many trailers do you load at once?   What kind of equipment do you guys use to load it? Pallet jacks or fork lifts on the pallets?   Do you get team lifts on some of the super heavy stuff?   And how do you guys stack stuff to the roof? There's no way every loader is 7 foot tall.  Also. Stop putting breakable and heavy shit near the roof. Have some love for your distant team members!
Target,2l3ler,PM_ME_YOUR_JUNKMAIL,2,Mon Nov 3 04:23:28 2014 UTC,"Yes, you do a drug test.  You also get a drug test if you damage something over $1000. This is usually when someone has a serious accident on a machine.  Depends on the person.  I use a fork lift whenever i can.  Sometimes you are too busy tho and you do not have time to back the extendoveyer out so you use a pallet jack.  Non-conveyable is super heavy stuff and we build pallets for it.  Heaviest stuff is gazebos, grills, shelves.  Heaviest conveyable stuff is smaller shelves, tide, and water.  I am 6'3"" and my arm reaches above 7', but trailers are taller than that.  We have plastic stepstools with 3 steps we are supposed to use.  Some do, some do not.  Some build good walls, some do not.  Putting heavy stuff at the top is a good way to have a wall fall on you. Rookie mistake.  But you  may have 14 different people loading your trailer in a week (2 shifts a day, 7 days a week), so some are better than others."
Target,2l3ler,Jsin14,1 point,Mon Nov 3 15:23:38 2014 UTC,"I was always told if the damage amounts to over 200$ you would have to take a drug test? I may be wrong. But to expand on what he said, depending on the job youre doing that day you use different equipment. Lanes(Loading the trailers) mostly only RC(Forklift) or pallet jack. Sorting non con youll use either a RC, PE(Double Pallet Rider) or a tugger. If you are in lanes, it varies on how much volume you have for that night but on average I would say 9 stores at one time upwards to 12 on a slow night. There is no ""team lift"", Anything and everything that says noncon or teamlift is sorted by hand by one person, again when it comes to best practice we have to stack to the ceiling, its a thing called ""cube rate"" and if we fail to do so and a GL sees we can get a CA. Another PSA, EVERY single HUGE FUCKING christmas tree you get from the DC is sorted by handed exclusively for your store"
Target,2l3ler,Sciencekitten,2,Mon Nov 3 18:48:05 2014 UTC,"You guys must have a lot slower/smaller stores.  We average 5-7 stores a person.  Xmas time even less, seen as low as 1 and a half for one TM.  Most of our trailers fill up after a day, if too slow they are sent half full after 3 shifts.  I once had a trailer close full 3 times during one 12 hour shift (but it was almost full at the start of shift)"
Target,2l3ler,FarDetective,1 point,Mon Nov 3 21:08:01 2014 UTC,"not necessarily, On our shift everyone that has a full lane set runs between 125-140%, on the B keys they wont run their guys over like 105% hahaha also how many guys are on your shift? Last fall season, I had 3 doors and was running 150%, worse night ive ever had. For the last 3 months Ive only had lanes once, Im always sorting, Depal or Mezz. We have 15 new people still under their 90 days so they take lanes. Woooo for senoirity. We have a couple of A++ doors and probably 15 A's and one AAA,the rest are mostly C's and B's"
Target,2l3ler,amanmanda,1 point,Mon Nov 3 21:50:05 2014 UTC,"Ours are a little busier, not too much tho.  Yeah, each GL is different, tho one guy got a ""needs"" on his review, even tho he was running 101% because he was the lowest.  Do you guys have ""permatemps"" yet?  We have about 100 temp workers through a temp agency that are employed for 6 months (if they last the whole 6 months they can be hired...if not they are assigned somewhere else by the temp agency) that throw in ART, throw cart line and breakpack line, and now even pack and are in doors."

Target,2kui5s,onebread,1 point,Fri Oct 31 03:20:45 2014 UTC,"Back in my service desk days, they would only let you do it if it was the same sale week. Since games range between $9.99-$59.99, the computer knows to automatically deduct prices and would specify how much on the receipt you would get back if you returned it separately.  An example of what the receipt looks like  You see that refund value underneath the item, between the return date? That's how much you'd get back on a non-sale week. We can't price match a game that wasn't part of the sale (it couldn't be since it wasn't released yet). You're losing money shelling out $60 for a game and only getting $40 back. Target figures people would try these loopholes, so specify in the receipt. They tend to always have these sweet sales just before a good release too.  Your best bet is to just preorder it and pay full price and get a free $5 gift card; or wait a couple weeks for another sale or promotion to get free swag to come out."

Target,2kui5s,DoomedJanissary,2,Sat Nov 1 15:35:31 2014 UTC,I wasn't the one but it might be someone who's store allows it. Or is disgruntled. I had a guest ask that last year and went to guest services and GSTL and they said the system would do it. I was working when the guy came in for the exchange and brought the game up to guest services with him and they never called me back over to verify that he was told it would so I assume it all went fine.
Target,2kui5s,dubblechzburger,2,Tue Nov 4 03:08:58 2014 UTC,"like most people i want to use the ""free game"" and trade it in for gta v on the 18th. So i can go in on the 18th with the game, show the receipt, and get a $40 refund?"
Target,2kui5s,DoomedJanissary,1 point,Mon Nov 10 02:37:17 2014 UTC,"Yep. Whatever the receipt states for each game, it's what you would get as a refund. It's all based on the game value.   So if you buy three $60 games ($180-$60=$120), you would get $40 back returned individually ($120÷3=$40) as shown on the receipt.  GTA V for PS4/X1 is going to be $60 so you'd still have to pay the extra $20 if you return the unwanted game for $40, so it doesn't really make a difference :/"
Target,2kui5s,DoomedJanissary,2,Mon Nov 10 04:57:37 2014 UTC,Does target interrogate you why you want a refund like walmart?

I start with wmns then acces to girls then boys/mens and lastly cosm since they are all in the same room. I would move that stuff to the floor. I then go to shoes and take them to the floor. I pull bb01/02 last since my TL told to always do that those last due to the system timing or something like that.  I take break at 12:30am and start again at 1:00ish. I still pulling at that time for bb02/01. It always seem to take the longest for some reasons. Aftward soon as I done pulling, I start backstocking. I normally start at 2:00ish. We take a meal break at 3:40 and get done at 4:15. I go back to backstocking until they tell me I can go home.   I also been told that my backstocking is fine ( I don't know how since there so much stuff left!) but that my pulling could use work.   Thanks! And sorry for the long reply!"

My least favourite thing is conducting call-outs when tms call in sick.   Our store also does not have a store operator so we have to balance the above activities while operating the phone switchboard. My team consists of one other HRTM and myself, our ETLHR oversees us. I know depending on your org structure and store size your HR team is likely larger and has more support which probably makes it less stressful.   I would encourage anyone who is eventually hoping to escape Target or retail in general in the future to apply for the position.

I left two hours into a eight hour shift on my fifth day working there. They saw me sick and made sure I was going home and was arranging a ride for me because they thought I shouldn't be driving.

As far as getting trouble; It may get mentioned to you in passing by your GSTL's/ETL's, but unless you make it a common habit of calling out or leaving early in general; it shouldn't be too bad.

Whenever I had a team member leave early I usually thanked them for giving it shot and wished them a get well soon.  Conversely I consistently administered corrective action for call offs and lates.

Target,2jv3py,Gundee1114,3,Tue Oct 21 05:41:56 2014 UTC,TL here - -   I'm shocked he actually called it a PDD to you but a PDD is literally the correct brand term for coaching. So you just got coached which if this is your first one means little to nothing for AAR. A slap on the wrist at most and adds are his ETL is telling him vs him doing it on his own. This time of year sucks for AAR but trust me once November hits your AAR should sky rocket to high green. So don't worry about it
Target,2jv3py,LeChiotx,2,Tue Oct 21 19:41:10 2014 UTC,Performance Development Discussion. He's not really supposed to tell you its a PDD. Its not corrective action. You can get PDD'd for like anything. I wouldn't worry too much over it.
Target,2jv3py,ponypartyposse,2,Tue Oct 21 10:48:02 2014 UTC,Team lead here. I wouldn't worry about it. PDD's don't really mean much. Unless of course they add up which then leads to a corrective. But if your AAR has improved then your fine. Your TL has to put you on paper because the ETL's want to make sure that he's doing his job.

And if you throw the truck, they aren't so mysterious. Once had a guy drop a box of shampoo on the back of my head while I was crouched down on the truck. Gets sort of dangerous up there.  If they ask you to do presentation, run. If you think flow or backroom is bad, presentation will slice you up way worse. I had no idea until I started doing it."

Don't bother telling it to place 75% into it. It is probably just confusing the system.  It works better if you set the accounts getting less first. I think. Ask you HR if it still doesn't work.

Target,2jjwjg,Deviant_King,1 point,Sun Oct 26 01:37:54 2014 UTC,"Here's what to expect as a seasonal softlines team member. An onslaught of terrible guests. Okay realistically though seasonal is a tough time to work at target. It's just really busy. But softlines means you'll be dealing with all the clothing which I think you already know. You'll do a lot of three things most likely. Zoning, go backs, and cahshiering/ maybe covering operator. Zoning is where you go through each clothing department and pick up the clothes off the floor, put random clothes back where they go, basically just make the department look nice. Go backs are stray items found around the store or stuff that guests have returned, which means you have to put them back in the right spot. And cashiering is self explanatory. Operator means you'll answer the store phone and answer people's questions. You probably won't be operator, but sometimes softlines team members at our store will cover operator breaks. Ya in general you just make the clothing department look good, help guests, and put away go backs. Also it could either be an okay job, or you'll hate your life depending on your store, managers, and other employees there. Good luck let me know if you have any questions. Also, are you a girl? Because I've never seen a boy in softlines."
Target,2jjwjg,HemingfordGrey,1 point,Sat Oct 18 01:01:35 2014 UTC,"you probably won't see any actual cashiering shifts, but you will be expected to respond to calls for backup when you're able, and going into the holidays there's a pretty obvious need for backup fairly regularly, so you can probably expect to spend a fair amount of time on the checklanes. everyone on sales floor gets cashier trained for this reason."
Target,2jjwjg,radiochu,1 point,Sat Oct 18 03:06:03 2014 UTC,"EVERYONE is trained to cash, just in case we get a huge rush and we need every person in the building to cash. As someone else said, you'll also be expected to back up cash."

Target,2jhwlh,itsup,7,Fri Oct 17 07:00:10 2014 UTC,"Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, baseball cards, etc. are all from a vendor, so Target doesn't discount those. If we find a broken package, we just put it in a bin to aside until the vendor comes and return it to him  If you see the furniture you want is scratched or bag/box is ripped or open (something that makes it it's not ""sellable""), then it doesn't hurt to ask. If they don't say no, generally the discount is 10% off."

Rarely have I seen trading cards get clearanced out. If you go to the service desk with a damaged box found on the floor we might apply a 10% off damaged discount, but that would be the max without a managers approval.  Best bet go to the Gsa or Gstl ( person in the front helping the cashiers ) and they may get you a better discount but at best you'll only get 10% off."

Target,2jhwlh,itsamutiny,1 point,Fri Oct 17 07:34:04 2014 UTC,The standard repackage discount is 30% off so we usually just give the guest that unless the product looks fine.
Target,2jhwlh,fetalbeetles,1 point,Fri Oct 17 13:55:23 2014 UTC,"At my store, it's EXTREMELY rare that anyone will give you more than 10% off. I've even seen srTLs say they can't authorize more than 10% off."
Target,2jhwlh,Agurtzane,2,Sat Oct 18 03:25:10 2014 UTC,"For trading cards, generally not. They are not owned by Target so we are not encouraged to discount. They are a scanned based product which means it is owned by the supplying company until it is scanned through the register. At that point, Target pays the company for that one unit sold. It is better for Target to just tell the vendor to get us a new one so we can get all of our profit"
Target,2jhwlh,IronOreAgate,2,Fri Oct 17 14:20:05 2014 UTC,"As previously stated, trading cards are a vendor item. A lot of times our vendors work on commission based on product sold. I'm not sure if trading cards is one of the ones that work that way, but out vendors come in throughout the week and work extra hard on their areas. We have a super great trading card guy and discounting his product hurts him. Also, I will generally only give out a damage discount if it is the last one in the store. To me, a damage discount is an apology for not having a working one available, not hey, you found one slightly damaged one amongst the dozen good ones on the shelf, here's your reward. I will also only give out the discount if it's damaged packaging is really, really bad. If the product itself is good, the packaging shouldn't matter. Trading cards are also an item that cannot be returned once opened, so I will usually refrain from selling them damaged or opened, in case the guest wants to return it later, especially at a different store, so they aren't met with unexpected problems latter. Also, no matter how nice you are, if you are trying to buy several boxes at a discount, you will most likely be suspect of a return for profit or reselling scheme, or they will just think you are being douchey. Especially if there is still good ones on the shelf."
Target,2jhwlh,The_WubWub,1 point,Sat Oct 18 01:50:31 2014 UTC,"If you find a damaged packaging/product you can always try and bring it to guest services and ask if they can give a damage discount. I know we will do it at the electronics desk all the time. Just be nice and reasonable about it. Don't demand like a 50% discount, usually its 10-30% discount. Worst case scenario is they shoot you down but I doubt they will tbh.  However, I do not believe it is eligible for a return if you do this."

If you showed up looking to buy pretty much any other phone off contact, they might be willing to help you out, but the iPhone 6 is hot right now and they can pretty much guarantee that people will want to snatch them up any way they can.   To the OP, depending on your current carrier and plan, you might look into the NEXT and EDGE program. Target Mobile does sell phones that way. I know at least with AT&T, it's the same cost of the phone, just split into monthly payments, and you can then simply go to AT&T and pay it off in one lump sum."

The people who are doing it are also not quitting. The best way to get in to doing TPS is probably to get to be a floor sales job and give good info to the current TPS officers working. That way when one of them transfers or leaves you look good for the spot.   Also as far as pay is concerned they pay above min wage. I just got hired with 0 work experience and got hired a dollar over minimum wage doing carts. As did everyone else in my orientation. I would assume it was the same everywhere else but maybe not.

This is why you can check out target items at a Starbucks in target but not Walmart items at a McDonald's in Walmart."

Any time I'm coming back from my LOA, I've called about three weeks in advance to let them know I was coming home and when (obviously at least two weeks to make it on the schedule, but another week just as an extra head's up, any earlier and they're bound to forget). No one's ever called me like the other commenter said, so DEFINITELY make sure to stay on top of it!"
Target,2izu01,pumpkinpatch1234,1 point,Sun Oct 12 03:30:11 2014 UTC,Yup. That's why Target offers that. That's when they need you the most. They know you will be leaving after summer and offer 3 months of LOA so you can be back by the Holidays.

Target,2iwmng,DarkDubzs,9,Sat Oct 11 00:22:39 2014 UTC,"Cashier: Pretty self explanatory. You are a cashier, you have to bag people's stuff, at a pretty fast rate. I get anxiety when I have to cashier, but that's just me. It's stressfull bagging people's things while they hover over you I feel! Also you are forced to sell people red cards and will get talked to by your supervisors if you don't ask every single guest if they want to sign up for one. If you're friendly and love talking to people this job is simple and a lot of people I know enjoy it.  Cart attendant/brand attendant: These are essentially the same thing, at least at my store. Like you said, you are basically the janitor. You have to bring in all the carts from outside in whatever weather it is. Rain? Yes. Blazing hot heat? Yes. Snow? I imagine so. Also you have to do something very gross in my opinion. Which is clean the bathrooms. If you think that's something you'd be interested in then go for it. You also will be taking out trash and just general cleaning stuff and helping out with carry-outs. Pretty much everyone I've met who is a cart attendant doesn't like it. But some do.  Flow team member: This one has the highest turn over rate at our store. For two reasons. It's extremely fast paced, and it's fucking early in the morning (at least at our store). I mean like 4am early. Some stores are overnight, and some stores start at 6am. If you don't mind not sleeping and you want to work these hours then this may be good for you. But I doubt it. You unload the truck, and stock the whole store basically. It's tough, but relatively simple Id say. My friend did this job and just said it was too much for how early in the morning it is. But some people at my store swear by it and won't do anything else. Because you get off so early, you'll never close, etc.  Sales floor team member: This is the one I would suggest as a new employee. It's relatively simple, and it's what a lot of people start out as. It's what I started out as. You'll either be working on the entire sales floor and just helping guests, working go backs into the correct location ( random stuff found around the store/ things people returned), zoning A LOT (basically going aisle to aisle and straightening it up/ fixing it to make it look nice. It's relatively simple and many people I meet seem to enjoy it for the most part. The sales floor team is relatively large so you'll meet a lot of people. And if you're a girl, they may put you in softlines, which is the clothing department of the store. The cons are you will probably have shitty hours, like closing, sometimes opening after, hours like 11am-730pm which just takes up your whole damn day. It's easy work but can be draining.   Target protection specialist: You are basically the store security. You dress up in a security looking uniform and catch people stealing, look at cameras, confront people, check receipts, walk around, count item on hands and make sure they are correct. Just typical loss prevention/ asset protection stuff. It does pay a lot more like people said and it looks very easy. You basically don't have to ever really work hard from what I've seen haha. I don't mean to say they are lazy, I love my TPS team but they look bored a lot of the time. Probably the least shitty out of all these jobs not going to lie. Plus you get to look at the cameras and do all that stuff which is cool.   That's pretty much all I have to say. Seasonal just means you'll work until like January and then they will let you go, unless you perform well and they like you then they'll ask you to stay. If you are looking for a permanent job, then seasonal is not that. Please PM me or ask me any questions if you have any. I'm very well versed in all things Target. I actually really enjoy working there, but its like split down the middle on people liking it and hating it id say. Plus I work in human resources which is a little less shitty. Good luck! Hope I helped!"
Target,2iwmng,HemingfordGrey,2,Sat Oct 11 02:06:53 2014 UTC,TPS do a LOT of work behind the scenes. FYI.
Target,2iwmng,Andis1,1 point,Sat Oct 11 07:48:27 2014 UTC,Ya I have no doubt about that. And especially depending on your store. Mine is a super low security store so our TPS don't have many people stealing and too many investigations
Target,2iwmng,HemingfordGrey,4,Sat Oct 11 14:42:11 2014 UTC,"I'm currently working as sales floor/ hard lines. It's easy work, it's just tedious. Not hard to memorize your section after zoning and reshopping the same damn things every day"
Target,2iwmng,bananawallet,2,Sat Oct 11 07:25:23 2014 UTC,What do you do on the first day or week if a guest asks where a certain product is? Do you already know where everything is by then or ask someone or what?
Target,2iwmng,bananawallet,4,Sat Oct 11 08:02:27 2014 UTC,"I've worked there a month and I still don't know where everything is, mostly just the general areas. You notice where the chunks of certain products are supposed to go. A lot of the aisles are clearly labeled with general things like ""facial cleansers"" and ""duplo"" and ""Mexican foods"". If you don't know where something is, you can always look it up on the PDA, or ask the team over the walkie if anyone knows where that product is, and generally someone will know if we sell it and where it is. I certainly don't know everything, but feel free to PM me and we can talk about the glamour of target sales floor some more"
Target,2iwmng,Ocelot529,5,Sat Oct 11 08:12:28 2014 UTC,Target Protection Specialist pays more.

Target,2iwmng,Croweslen,1 point,Sat Oct 11 03:35:24 2014 UTC,Tps definitely pays more but it is not a seasonal position as far as i know. U should start ofd as a sales floor team memeber or cashier. You can move around from there.   Source:was a seasonal cashier and now im a senior tps
Target,2iwmng,LemonApples,1 point,Sat Oct 11 07:03:41 2014 UTC,"If you can get in as TPS I'd suggest that, easy job and very rewarding if you're good. They usually do require some experience but I know my partner and the guys at some surrounding stores had no experience and were hired on as TPS. If you can't get that id say salesfloor. Best opportunity to gain the most knowledge then if Target is a good fit and they like you you can move on to another work center."
Target,2iwmng,itsamutiny,1 point,Sat Oct 11 16:37:42 2014 UTC,fyi flow the highest paid of those positions. well TPS is probably higher but it's unlikely you'd get hired for TPS without previous experience.  seasonal TMs do not get paid more nor do they get shorter hours. they are typically treated the same as regular TMs but are (usually) let go in january.
Target,2iwmng,Jesscause,1 point,Sun Oct 12 02:37:21 2014 UTC,"I'm sales floor and it sucks if they put you in the same area/block every time to zone. I mean the perks of it is you know where everything is at in that area of the store when a guest has a question, but for me it gets boring at times and I just got hired on two weeks ago."
Target,2iwmng,HeroesNeverQuit,1 point,Sun Oct 12 08:10:48 2014 UTC,Everyones trained to be a cashier so realize that if your permanent job is cashier your easily replace by literally anyone in the store.  I just got hired as carts after talking to someone who works carts. At our store the only real thing you have to do in the bathroom is stock toilet paper 99% of the time is what I was told by the other cart workers. That and be outside. I prefer the cold so it was no biggie but come spring ill probably ask to swap to something inside as I do not do well in the heat.  Sales floor is decent if you dont mind dealing with customers. The likeliness of getting hired as TPS is slim. At my store the two TPS guys both actually have some justice bachelors framed up on the wall. Its a great job. The chance of getting injured is higher though as your the only person thats going out the to grab people who did shoplift. Flow team is rough on the body. Its higher pay though then the other general jobs.

Bring doctor notes and proof with dates, if you really want to get back.  If you were a good worker before, and they know that, hopefully they'll emphasize with you and understand. Good luck!"

Target,2ij3ki,Andis1,3,Tue Oct 14 18:36:46 2014 UTC,"haha, i mean most of it comes from buying snacks on my breaks or lunches and a few big purchases like my TV, PS4 and other things. Plus I work in electronics and have an addiction of buying video games lol."

Target,2ii5i5,Pepsiguy2,1 point,Tue Oct 7 03:56:10 2014 UTC,I'm going in for an interview on it on Friday. Got any tips?
Target,2ii5i5,Pepsiguy2,1 point,Wed Oct 8 02:36:04 2014 UTC,"I spent a lot of time on glassdoor looking up the interview questions people were asked, and figuring out what I would answer to them. I totally recommend that because when they said things I already knew what to say for it!   Also looking through this sub was pretty helpful! I'm not sure what you're interviewing for but I was interviewed by 2 people with 3 situational questions each. Then an HR person talked to me and offered me the job. Looking on this sub helped me see what kind of answers they were looking for (always put guest satisfaction first, etc), and that came up in my interview so just look around here!  The most important thing for me at least was to be calm and be like myself. I have really bad social anxiety leading up to any time I'm talking to someone I don't know, so I had to work really hard to not freak out beforehand. As soon as I got there I slipped into my retail persona which is really upbeat and likes to make jokes, so I'd say even if you don't feel confident, fake it!"
Target,2ii5i5,rh51too,1 point,Wed Oct 8 02:44:20 2014 UTC,"thanks, im going for Sales FLoor Member as well, athough they sent me another email to setup an interview as a cashier (though the site says to book only one appointment).  I also have anxiety and social awkwardness but I think I'll be able to pull thorugh. Did you wear anything special or professional to the interview?"
Target,2ii5i5,cspalko,2,Wed Oct 8 05:40:50 2014 UTC,"I'm a girl just fyi but I wore black slacks, a black blazer, a nice shirt and a scarf. The guy who I waited for an interview with was wearing slacks, dress shoes, and a nice button down shirt."
Target,2ii5i5,rh51too,2,Wed Oct 8 14:45:55 2014 UTC,"As a former cashier and now an electronics team member, do whatever you can to avoid being hired on as a cashier."
Target,2ihqn2,8mystical_mysteries8,12,Mon Oct 6 21:59:32 2014 UTC,"Have you called the integrity hotline yet? Target takes this stuff very seriously. Set a bit of time beforehand before you call so you can explain everything thoroughly and in a calm and level headed manner - no name calling, as many relevant details as you can remember, etc.  You can also try talking to your STL or, if you can get their numbers, your DTL or DTL-HR. But seriously, call the hotline. Better if you can have multiple people call about the same issue. Each district has a team of investigators for issues like this. If it's a valid concern, it will get addressed."
Target,2ihqn2,anyquestions,3,Mon Oct 6 22:41:11 2014 UTC,"This is the best answer. If you don't feel your complaint is being correctly handled, Intrgrity Hotline just adds District level and above visibility of the complaints.   However, while your complaints are valid, the ETL isn't violating any rules, so don't expect him to get fired or anything remotely near that. Without the STL or DTL agreeing that his actions are making the store a bad place to work, and willing to do something about it, nothing will happen.   Bad ETLs happen. They eventually work themselves out of a job, but it takes a while. The ETL more than likely will not change that drastically, you just need to decide if you can wait for the next LOG. If not, get a new job or ask for a transfer"
Target,2ihqn2,fetalbeetles,1 point,Tue Oct 7 00:54:46 2014 UTC,"i have full trust in etl hr, and more importantly etl hr in another store (she mentored me in a different position)   if you trust your etl hr, tell them. they'll bring it up to the stl, then its up to them. any etl is a peer and they can't talk to them. if you don't trust them, talk to integrity hotline. i've had more things done after called that are more likely because i called instead of just leaving things to our etl to do. its been communicated to her that its needs to be handled, and it gets done."
Target,2ihqn2,monkeyman80,2,Thu Oct 9 06:41:11 2014 UTC,"Try talking to STL first. IF that doesnt work, call the hotline. Make sure you tell the person when you call that you attempted to resolve the issue with the HR and STL but nothing was done about it.  Also, if he is writing up your entire team, and not just a specific issue, it should have been handled as a ""culture issue"", and nobody should be getting written up."

Target,2ihqn2,roysgame,1 point,Mon Oct 13 06:41:21 2014 UTC,"My thoughts exactly!! Since I reported him, my hours have been reduced and every ETL had treated me like crap. I got another job and I already put in my notice! Stick a fork in me - I'm done!"
Target,2ih6la,throwinawayin1234,7,Mon Oct 6 19:26:19 2014 UTC,"Target definitely does pay according to the region. One of my etls are transferring to Hawaii, and she is getting a cost of living raise because it's more expensive to live there. 46k sounds about right for starting from what I've heard. Although, the non negotiable part does seem a little weird. But knowing how stingy target is that could be true. Etl ap seems to be one of the better positions from what I've seen. Good luck!"
Target,2ih6la,HemingfordGrey,3,Mon Oct 6 20:22:42 2014 UTC,"Target has gone full non negotiable for all positions. Now. Im sure if you get up into some of the higher district/group/region positions it may be different. But, from what I've heard from my district boss, it seems company wide."
Target,2ih6la,zomboni_steve,2,Mon Oct 6 20:54:05 2014 UTC,Thank you both for your replies - I feel much better about the offer now. Really looking forward to getting my foot in the door in regards to AP/LP management.
Target,2ih6la,meowrawrnda,2,Mon Oct 6 20:55:31 2014 UTC,"Not Company wide. At least not when it comes to the pharmacy. I was splitting my times between two different pharmacies (both target) and one offered me about a $1.25 more than I was making to be with them full time instead of split my time. Pay is definitely negotiable! Maybe not on the salary level, but on the hourly level it is."
Target,2ih6la,fetalbeetles,5,Thu Oct 16 03:01:33 2014 UTC,"Campus hires are non-negotiable. Experienced hires are negotiable. If you do well, you'll get a paygrade promo in a year or year and a half which is a 10% raise which will come right about the same time as your performance raise.   Welcome from a fellow ETL-AP!

Target,2ih6la,REDDIT__CEO,3,Wed Oct 8 00:03:18 2014 UTC,"There's more that goes into play than a yes or no answer. All groups can be different regarding the negotiation part. I didn't negotiate my salary because I was satisfied for where I was living (ca). I was offered a ETL-ap position for $52,000 and after one year I'm already at $62,000 and AP is the funnest position in Target stores. Straight out of college it's a good opportunity because if you are liked and can run a green work center there is plenty room for advancement."
Target,2ih6la,xpinchx,2,Thu Oct 9 15:38:41 2014 UTC,My roommate started at 52k and he was the AP ETL. We live in ca.
Target,2ih6la,joylin,2,Wed Oct 8 15:50:06 2014 UTC,"It depends on region (cost of living), experience, store volume, challenge of assignment, high risk stores, etc. Some groups will have non-negotiable salaries, especially for a fresh college grad or intern. But work hard and stick with it. Once you prove yourself it's easy to get paygrade promotions and/or more challenging assignments that will pay better."
Target,2ih8n9,amacias408,2,Mon Oct 6 19:41:55 2014 UTC,"If you can stay awake, I'd do it. You don't have to talke to customers, everything is usually more lenient, and you get an extra $1 per hour."

Target,2ih8n9,waffelCake,1 point,Mon Oct 6 20:38:33 2014 UTC,"depends on your store. some of the etl's have to be present certain days overnight for various reasons. maybe they have an etl logistics that starts at 1. flow might be keyed and open.    and on signing days, we now have etl's tl's at 4 am on sundays"
Target,2ih8n9,monkeyman80,1 point,Thu Oct 9 06:35:12 2014 UTC,Why do you feel entitled to be a TL? Just curious...
Target,2igq3g,jselmz,2,Mon Oct 6 17:16:15 2014 UTC,"I say go for it. Target is generally very flexible with scheduling, so you'll be able to work around your classes. I have been with the company for about a five years and I have no real complaints."
Target,2igq3g,itsamutiny,2,Mon Oct 6 20:45:51 2014 UTC,"Target is pretty flexible, just have to let them know what days and times you are available. They are higher than minimum wage, and allow you to take educational leave if you need it.   You have experience so you should be fine! If you don't want to get stuck at a register and don't want to interact with guests all the time, I'd apply for backroom. You mainly backstock merchandise and push it on the floor.   Salesfloor will require you to learn register to help with back up when necessary, but not all the time. You make the shelves pretty and help customers with questions and directions.   If you are a Super Target, then you most likely have a deli, bakery, and Starbucks area. There's also Food Ave/Target Café, but I think the other areas are more fun to work if you don't mind food.   Stay away from cart attendant, you'll fee outside in the boiling hot/freezing cold weather, and your basically the custodian collecting trash and cleaning messes. Plus the first one to call when they need another cashier. Don't do it.   Pay from least to most (in my area of Florida it's around $8-$10 at start):  Cashier>cart attendant>guest service>salesfloor/softlines>café>electronics>instocks>deli/starbucks/bakery>backroom/flow  Hope that helps :P"
Target,2ifb1s,Hero4sale85,3,Mon Oct 6 05:57:39 2014 UTC,Another tip to stay on. Proove that you are a valuable team member that greatly impacted the store. Find an area in your department you're goos at and perfect it and make sure you get noticed for it by telling your team lead.  Staying tight with youe team lead is a great way to show you care about your work.
Target,2ifb1s,Croweslen,2,Mon Oct 6 18:15:32 2014 UTC,If i was a gstl i would want to keep you on definitely. Make sure that the gslts and the elt-ge knows who you are and what you do for the company
Target,2ifb1s,Croweslen,2,Sun Nov 16 07:20:18 2014 UTC,"few points.  we hire almost everyone. i deal with the low end. you just can't sound like an idiot and show up and talk stupid. its a min wage esq job, we don't expect you to be awesome."
Target,2ifb1s,monkeyman80,2,Sun Nov 16 15:30:15 2014 UTC,"That's true, but if you want to get out of seasonal, you need to have some leaders in your corner. Looking professional will put you a bit a head of other tms."
Target,2ifb1s,monkeyman80,2,Wed Oct 8 02:19:22 2014 UTC,"leaders don't care about what you dressed up as. if you can do the job or not matters. i went in a full suit. my interviewer (etl ge) mentioned twice that i suited up  listen to some of the things people hire, and they really need to do is treat it like a job. you don't get to call out in your 90 days. i get there's shit that comes up, i did a few times but you do, its we hired you to do this and you didn't do it. now?  attendance isn't an issue. even if i have an issue where i didn't show up for a shift it'll be edited and covered. never against my record.   treat this job with respect? we'll be helpful"
Target,2ifb1s,Pepsiguy2,1 point,Wed Oct 8 02:32:30 2014 UTC,"so basically youre saying ""as long as you show up and do your work, we might consider keeping you""?"
Target,2ifb1s,monkeyman80,1 point,Thu Oct 9 06:48:17 2014 UTC,"At least at my store it really is that simple. We have non seasonal begging for hours and we try to help out. If they cared enough to put their shifts up people will jump on them. The amount of call outs and even worse no call no shows is insane.   If you are reliable that's a big leg up.   Then there's do you do what's asked to be done of you? If the lod's have to give you a certain time expectation and follow up that means they can't say ""you're in c block"" and we likely won't keep you. If you're a cashier and the gstl has to remind you not to sit around chatting while there are things to do that doesn't look good. Each position has its core roles. If a supervisor has to make sure you complete them it's not good."
Target,2ief7m,Besnasty,4,Sun Oct 5 23:59:46 2014 UTC,"Yeah, We're definitely not as interesting as your store but I would say that our turnover is extremely high. We've been losing long term employees and team leads left and right. Anyone that's been at my store for any amount of time doesn't even want to be promoted because of all the turmoil.  I've also seen an APETL arrested for theft. You would think if anyone would know you can't get away with it, it would be them. On the plus side, our current ETL has assembled a great team and they have already surpassed last fiscal year's total recovery and there's still 5 months to go.  All I can say is that this is probably going to be a very rough 4Q for A LOT of stores. I'm just going to keep my head down and pull those CAF's ಠ_ಠ"
Target,2ief7m,Yield88,2,Mon Oct 6 02:13:10 2014 UTC,"My store has lost at least 40 people since March.  Yours isn't the only store!  Although, I can't say our turnover is as interesting as yours, haha."
Target,2ief7m,Iderrisai,2,Mon Oct 6 00:17:36 2014 UTC,"Nah, not even close to the only one. We lost a huge chunk of our TMs before I left in August. The entire store was basically running on a skeleton crew. Target is hemorrhaging employees because the policies as an employee are trash.  When I left in August after 14 months, I was the most senior employee in Hardlines. Been there longer than all of my TLs and other TMs. In one year we cycled through literally the entire team.   she deserved to have her miscarriage because she smoked and the employee threatened to sue   Oh, I have two stories about this, too! I guess stress gets to people.  At my store, we had an ETL tell a HL TM that she would have beaten her up for being so slow if she weren't pregnant. Fired the next day.  A few months later, we had our AP-ETL tell a hispanic HL TM who was falling behind after close that she ""thought his people weren't lazy."" Gave her a week to leave the store. It was glorious."
Target,2ief7m,PasswordIsntClop,2,Mon Oct 6 15:15:04 2014 UTC,"When I had my orientation almost 2 years ago, our HRetl made the comment ""oh if you ever work the morning shift you'll see a bunch of Mexicans cleaning our floors, don't worry they won't talk to you""  She stayed for about a year, and now we have a new HRetl that has got to be the worst HR person I've ever met with any company.    Way to go Target. Picking winners all around."
Target,2ief7m,soadaa,2,Mon Oct 6 15:23:39 2014 UTC,"A lot of turnover at my store as well, recently a decent amount of etl putting in their 2 weeks.  No clue what's the biggest reason but I'm guess it's all quitting, followed by being fired for stealing, and lastly being fired for any other reason."
Target,2ief7m,Fr0stSoldier,2,Tue Oct 7 00:35:08 2014 UTC,"My question is why is it happening now? I know my hr-etl made me do the best team survey. Is it really that important? I dont think anyone would quit since the store opened about 2 months ago, and every non-team lead member is new."
Target,2ief7m,fetalbeetles,2,Tue Oct 7 00:55:59 2014 UTC,"There are only 3 ways a STL can be fired: sleeping with a TM, leaving a door unlocked, and being a Best Team Survey focus store (simplified, but extremely accurate).   Being a focus store will eventually lead to the existing executive team getting whipped into shape from the group level, or being turned over (most will leave Target). It happens, stores recover"
Target,2ief7m,wesrocks360,1 point,Tue Oct 7 01:07:01 2014 UTC,We're falling apart. Everhone is leaving or getting screwed over. And if they hAvnt left yet they are looking for a new job including me. We get no hours and when we do they overwork us.
Target,2ibfl6,Sunnystateofmind,2,Sat Oct 4 23:54:10 2014 UTC,"So, as sales floor you'll be in charge of interacting with guests and stocking/restocking the shelves, and rearranging them as necessary. When the front end is busy, you'll be expected to come up and cashier.   As for what they'd ask in the interview, they'd ask you common behavioral questions. Those are the questions like, describing a time when you were in a team, or describe a problem you had and how you got over it. I'd Google a list of behavioral questions and just be prepared for them to ask you a couple of those. They'll also ask you why you'd want to work for Target, and speaking to the virtues of Target (fast, fun, friendly, good customer service, etc) is a good answer to that question. They'll then ask you situational questions based on theoretical situations with you and a guest, or you and another team member. Use the STAR format (Situation, task, action, result) to answer those questions. I'd also Google some examples of STAR. After that you'll do the same thing in the second interview immediately following the first interview.   Hope this helps!"
Target,2ibfl6,huskyn,1 point,Sun Oct 5 02:38:00 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much for your detailed response!   I have another question, do they hire on the spot post interview or is there a waiting period? The woman who called me said they were scheduling interviews the 6th - 10th (Mine is on the 6th) and I'm curious if you or anyone else knows if they're more likely to offer me a job right away or make me wait?

Target,2ibfl6,Andis1,1 point,Sun Oct 5 04:32:02 2014 UTC,"This typically depends on if HR is in the building to sign off on the job offer. Just because you don't get a job offer right away doesn't mean they won't be in touch. Although, considering the 6th is a Monday, the HR is pretty much guaranteed to be in the building, so it shouldn't be an issue for OP."
Target,2ibfl6,Seveventeen,1 point,Sun Oct 5 05:10:51 2014 UTC,"Thank you!! I guess I'll find out tomorrow and hope they offer me a job immediately, because otherwise I'll go crazy waiting!"
Target,2ibfl6,Seveventeen,1 point,Sun Oct 5 15:49:10 2014 UTC,"In my experience, there are three interviews. The first is with a Team Leader who is an hourly supervisor. If you do well, they forward you to an Executive Team Leader who is a salaried member of management. After that, it's pretty much just a chat with the Store Team Leader.  Your mileage may vary. This was our procedure in a low volume store in South Carolina, but there may be some crcial differences in your region and district."
Target,2ibfl6,Kehndy12,1 point,Sun Oct 5 03:07:13 2014 UTC,So these multiple interviews happen in one day? Were you offered a job at the end of all these or did you have to wait for them to contact you a couple days later?
Target,2ibfl6,Kehndy12,1 point,Sun Oct 5 03:17:11 2014 UTC,They were not all on the same day. The TL called me and we did the first over the phone. I was later called schedule an in person interview with the ETL. The STL was on a separate day too.   Same thing happened when I interviewed to be a team leader. It was very drawn out.

Target,2i7kmh,amacias408,2,Fri Oct 3 18:25:24 2014 UTC,"There are a few different levels of management at Target. STL's oversee the store, ETL's are the ""managers"" and Team Leads (or TL's) are ""supervisors"" and are not on salary. You would most likely be taking the position of a Team Lead which, depending on your state, usually starts at time-and-a-half whatever your minimum wage is.   The challenge of the job will depend largely on the volume of the store and how many other TL's there are to split the workload. The fewer there are, the more responsibility falls on each of them. Generally speaking it's going to be worth the money because you are respected and treated fairly at Target. Good luck!"
Target,2i7kmh,Macasaurus,1 point,Fri Oct 3 20:01:39 2014 UTC,If that pay grade is time and a half I need a raise. Though our high minimum wage may make it a difference.
Target,2i7kmh,exus,1 point,Sat Oct 4 08:24:56 2014 UTC,"Depends where you are a team lead at.   A Guest Service Team Lead is expected to lead the cashiers and drive red card sales. They watch the lanes and call for back up when needed. They are expected to coach team members. Sometimes help with hiring.   A sales floor team lead manages their area of the sales floor. Either soft lines, or hardlines. They are responsible for keeping their department ""brand"" and looking nice. Also coaching team members and pushing store focuses.   Backroom/flow, etc: I am a little less familiar with these areas but you basically drive results and manage time. You are responsible for making sure task get done as fast as possible.   As for all other retailers. A team lead is middle management. You get a lot of pressure placed on you and expectations can be high. Fourth quarter is about to start, which is crazy. To me the pay is not worth it. I think that mostly because I'm in loss prevention and get paid more for less busy work and doing something I love."

Target,2i0act,rustypanda32,5,Wed Oct 1 17:20:09 2014 UTC,"It's the same pay. If you don't mind the hours of flow, I would say stay flow for sure. I've heard back room is one of the hardest positions, and all the guys at my store that work back there seem like they want to kill themselves every time they are there. If you generally like flow, and don't mind those early morning/ overnight hours, I would stay flow. Keep doing what you're doing though because usually they move people to back room if they think they are a good worker or can handle it. At least at my store that's how it works."
Target,2i0act,HemingfordGrey,3,Wed Oct 1 18:55:50 2014 UTC,Backroom gave me more hours and a different team lead... Which was an honest team lead... Which gave me a raise..

Target,2i0act,Zingerac,2,Wed Oct 1 17:31:09 2014 UTC,"He didn't specify, but i'm pretty sure it's backroom day."
Target,2i0act,not_a_banana,2,Wed Oct 1 17:46:12 2014 UTC,"I work at a small target and get tossed around to different teams kind of often, so I've worked both, often on the same day.   Backroom you have two main task. back stocking everything, and pulling the autofills. backstocking is just scanning an item, putting it on appropriate shelf, and scanning the location and entering how many you put there. pulling autofills is basically the same process in reverse, the pda will tell you were to go, you scan each item in that spot until it tells you that you've got the right one, then it tells you how many to take. if this sounds repetitive and boring to you that's because it is. But I often find flow repetitive and boring too.  pretty sure the only difference in pay would be if you were going from an overnight to a day position and vis-versa.  If you should take it or not is up to you. just take into account how much you like/dislike flow and any change in hours switching to backroom might entail."
Target,2i0act,Yield88,2,Wed Oct 1 22:06:02 2014 UTC,"I would really consider doing it. Backroom is like the gateway to a lot of other support positions. I started as flow and got asked to help out in the back and that turned into reverse logistics (which lead to receiving) and scanning instocks, which lead to setting pogs, and brought me to price changes and comp-shop. I don't know what kind of volume your store is but typically, Flow team spends some time on the registers come black friday.  And yeah, backroom day IS a lot of hard work but I really enjoy it. At least to me, it's really satisfying to have a defined goal every hour and try to beat it as fast as possible."
Target,2i0act,ArekkusuRin,2,Thu Oct 2 01:07:14 2014 UTC,Don't do it man. Backroom is one of the worst positions at Target depending on your stores work load. At my target a light work day consists of a 2600 truck followed by 2500 auto fills. This is for the overnight process. Backroom day gets to see our mess if we don't back stock everything.
Target,2i0act,Yield88,6,Wed Oct 1 18:10:55 2014 UTC,I'm sure by 'see our mess' you really mean 'climb over and around it' :P
Target,2i0act,itsamutiny,5,Thu Oct 2 01:08:45 2014 UTC,I actually prefer backroom over flow.
Target,2i0act,not_a_banana,2,Thu Oct 2 03:34:32 2014 UTC,2600 is light? our truck today was about 1600 lol. Pretty sure I've never seen anything above 2200 in my two years.
Target,2i0act,ArekkusuRin,3,Wed Oct 1 22:08:22 2014 UTC,I wish I worked at that target :(. Everyone here works as fast as they can but etls bitch at us for still being too slow. Like they expect 7 team members to back stock a 5000 piece work load day in 6 hours.
Target,2i0act,FirePowerCR,2,Wed Oct 1 22:13:55 2014 UTC,"No you don't. It's the same thing. 1700-2200 average here. Actually we averaged 2400 for a little while. We're at 6am starts now but we were at 730 for a bit. Well, it's the same pile up here. When the trucks are smaller the team is smaller. When I first started we used to have a team big enough to come clean everyday. I'm talking nothing on vehicles except pulls and Sweeping around the back room. Since the security breach (when they really started cutting back on hours here) the only time we have come clean is when people came in at like 3-4am to backstock. A few times it was necessary to do that just to get by the next day. I swear we have had a clean Backroom twice since that breach."
Target,2i0act,zieen,2,Thu Oct 2 13:22:11 2014 UTC,Had a near 5000 piece double earlier this week.

Target,2i0act,Buttstache,1 point,Wed Oct 1 22:09:37 2014 UTC,"All these people saying don't do it, and me over here thinking it was the best position I ever worked at Target lol. I was overnight, and we on average had ~2000pc trucks every night, and batches ~1500-2000ish. Sometimes we didn't come clean, but we usually did. Our store had two back rooms (from an expansion), so that made it even harder. Really though, I'd rather be in the back scanning and pulling than out on the floor tearing open boxes and shit. Plus we could have one earbud in, so music made the work much better.   It's harder work, but I always found it more rewarding. And it does help you get into the more esoteric positions in your store that are related to logistics."
Target,2i0act,rykerman33,1 point,Thu Oct 2 02:08:44 2014 UTC,"I would ask to work a couple of shifts in the back, talk to backroom TMs in your store and make sure you get along with the TL.  BR is very process based. It will get very repetitive but you don't have to deal with guests."

Find the item on target.com and get the DPCI there, it's much easier than playing ""guess the proper search term"" on the PDA."
Target,2hnxpb,Macasaurus,3,Sun Sep 28 03:27:54 2014 UTC,"This is one of the biggest tips out there. If the item is sold in stores, there's always a DPCI in the Details section.

Where as, if you type a barcode (49+DDD+CC+IIII) it takes you directly to the item, saving you a bit of time.  If you're  in one of the work centers that uses RF Apps, you've probably noticed that there is nearly no function that accepts DPCI's. Using the 49 code alleviates this as well.  Edit: Second Tip  All own-brand things have a DPCI somewhere on the product. It's usually right by the barcode but it's also on a small tag sewn inside clothing, under the tongue of shoes or on the front-top-right corner of some products (mostly threshold)"

I did your type of schedule in high school and got a decent $250+ per paycheck, and it worked out great. But now that I'm in college I took the educational leave to help maintain my GPA, I would definitely recommend it if you feel your schoolwork is falling behind."
Target,2hmcxp,theuglybadger,2,Sat Sep 27 16:01:28 2014 UTC,"Don't tell them you're only thinking about leaving. Don't tell them anything unless you actually decide to leave.  I would go on a leave of absence. Assuming you're going to college, you can work through the summer at Target and probably get close to full time hours, plus you can work through Christmas break and on days like Black Friday. My store even has people that are working while in college but ONLY work during breaks."
