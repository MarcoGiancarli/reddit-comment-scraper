AnimeSketch,3e1zft,johnreese2345,3,Tue Jul 21 09:52:31 2015 UTC,"Overall angle of the arm is wrong. The forearm is not that stretched to the viewer when drinking that BubbleTea(?) a 2/4 angle of the arm instead of a 3/4 angle would make more sense. Thumb doesn't bend that way when holding that cup + thumb should be almost twice as big as fingers. Folds at the left go more to the left when the sweatshirt is open. Also where is the rest of the sweatshirt on the right below the arm?  The black shirt itself needs more folds, use a lighter black for this one. Also it needs more details like stitches and a more detailled collar.  Otherwise good work!"

AnimeSketch,3e2u15,Miyuki-tan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:34 2015 UTC,Where are her ears?  The proportions are very realistic but anime is known for those big round feminine heads and those hard shaped edgy manly heads and your´s inbetween those two. There aren't enough details to really judge your style. Draw some clothes on her and apply shadows and not just the face anyone can do that.  And the hair of girls tends to go becond the neck and below the shoulder and I don't see any hair behind her or maybe it´s a updo it´s hard to judge.  Keep drawing she is really cute!

AnimeSketch,3dye7t,NemuiFukurou,6,Mon Jul 20 15:27:40 2015 UTC,Mouth is really far to the left. The way the tip of the left boot tops at the same point as the edge of the couch is a mistake in the composition/overall design of the piece. These points are referred to as 'tangents' and call for the viewer's attention to their respective area.

There's a visible change in the eye shape and the way she wears the shirt, but I wouldn't call it improvement as much as trying a different style. One thing you did get a lot better was the size of the shoulders, which in the left were a bit too broad, and on the right look much more balanced! Still, you might want to look into other forms of practice if you'd like to improve at a faster pace."

AnimeSketch,3dx6r0,BoxerPanties,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:35:44 2015 UTC,I'm using paint tool sai and the thing I most want to improve on is coloring since i have never colored when i drew traditionally.
AnimeSketch,3dx6r0,Miyuki-tan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"You'll definitely want to read up a bit on color theory, as a basis. I know it's a chore, but it does help a lot if you check out tutorials on direct and reflected light and whatnot, though that might be a bit advanced to start off with. Sai has great tools for blending and whatnot, and cell shading is even easier to achieve thanks to layers that help fix any mistake you might come across, just don't be afraid to play around with the tools -- remember it's a digital canvas, anything can be fixed as easy as ctrl+z.  Here's a little video on how to figure out what colors might work best with each other.  On the drawing you posted, one thing I notice right away you might want to get away from: you seem to be using black and white for shadows and highlights respectively. Some people do this as a stylistic choice, but in general, it's best to avoid these two colors for shading and highlightling, as they can give a muddy and artificial feel to your colors. The video above might give you a good idea on how to experiment with shadows in ways that aren't just ""shading with a low-opacity black"" nor ""pick a more saturated, blacker version of the color I'm using."""

AnimeSketch,3duu5v,RazorNion,2,Sun Jul 19 18:18:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's just your art style or if it's not finished yet but something that stood out to me was how Yamato was painted with detail (especially on the hair and torso) but the ship parts/turrets aren't painted with as much detail, making them look flat. This is really obvious when you look at the parts that go around her waist and then look at her waist. That makes it looks like she's carrying cardboard cutouts around her. Either make ALL of it (Yamato and the ship parts) flat or make all of it detailed and realistic."

AnimeSketch,3du8bs,BoxerPanties,2,Sun Jul 19 15:11:09 2015 UTC,Great start!! Whenever i draw i notice my mouths and chins look a bit off. I notice that a bit with yours as well. Look at your own face in a mirror when setting up the structure for the face and you should get a more even look from forehead to eyes to nose to mouth to chin.
AnimeSketch,3du8bs,BoxerPanties,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:34:29 2015 UTC,I've been trying to do the circle and line bisects to get the proportions right. I'm a little off still! I feel like that's one of the best ways for me right now to make sure I'm close in my proportions that my face looks like a face.
AnimeSketch,3du8bs,PandavengerX,2,Sun Jul 19 19:08:25 2015 UTC,Yea always start with those. I always like to watch youtube like crazy to get different ideas on how to set up the face to begin with
AnimeSketch,3du8bs,PandavengerX,2,Sun Jul 19 19:50:49 2015 UTC,"I know no one likes reading this when we want to draw anime or cartoons, but you'd really benefit from some real-life studies, both for the face and the body. Anime is all about stylization, but to know how to break the rules in a visually appealing way, you must first learn the rules.  Another thing I'd suggest (please don't hate me for it) is to leave aside any ""how to draw anime"" books you might be leaning on. These books rarely go over structure in a meaningful way, at least that I've seen, and any ""step by step"" they have encourages to copy, not reference or learn the structure of what you're drawing.  For instance, when I look over your headshots, it took me a while to realize it was the same character through all of them: the factions of the face are different in each drawing, not because of the angle, but because you don't yet have a grasp on how to place the elements of the face on a basic level depending on changing angles. As a result, applying stylization to them makes it look like the factions are getting larger or smaller, or moving spots on the face. (BTW, this is COMPLETELY normal, I'd like to see anyone who wanted to draw anime and didn't end up with wonky faces the first try -- yours are pretty good for being firsts!)  I understand if drawing-from-life or focusing on anatomy studies might not be something you're interested in. It's something that greatly helps ANY artist, no matter the final style they're going for, but if your hobby is specifically for a certain style, I don't blame anyone for wanting to focus on it. Still, I'd suggest away from the how-to-anime books just based on personal experience (which can be wrong, and whatever book you're using could very well be better than the 5 or 6 books I've seen, myself).  What you can do instead of this is go over many different anime styles: try to ""copy"" them, but not by laying down every line exactly as you see it in the finished drawing, but by drawing the skeleton of it: you know, the circle with the cross in the middle, draw loose circles where the eyes should go, a triangle for the shape and placement of the nose, draw in the mouth and ears. All very, very loose, as it's a study for you to deconstruct the style you want to work towards. Do it for as many angles as you can: learning a new style is not about copying, but understanding the bases behind it so you can alter it to a variation of your own."

I've been drawing digitally for a year and 5 months, started considering drawing as a career around that time too.  I wanted to do a yellow pattern (shown in pic 2), but I really have no idea what I'm doing, got lazy, and just gave up.  If anyone would offer me tips on digital drawing, I'd be incredibly grateful.  Also, blending and painting, I never painted before, so can someone explain that to me? I kinda want to learn that ""rough painting"" style, and as much styles as I can, but coloring stuff is still new to me. Been practicing my line art only."

AnimeSketch,3dt88l,Lionstrong,2,Sun Jul 19 15:10:13 2015 UTC,"I dont really have a frame for the body. I might do it wrong but what i usually do is looking at other arts, noticing where and how the curves are, the patterns, and adding the proportions i feels are right for the character. At some point it just become natural. But that's just me, a lot of people need a skeleton to build around and create some nice stuff, some don't."

AnimeSketch,3dquet,LimbohBimboh,3,Sat Jul 18 15:58:48 2015 UTC,"i think the composition and pose are both interesting  the main thing i would comment on is that the features of the face get ""lost""; in other words, they are ""unreadable"" (low readability)  i think a lot of that could be remedied by emphasizing the line or shadow of the nose more, and also more ""explicitly implying"" (yes i know contradictory) the form of the mouth with some shadow. I know that you are going for an implied mouth, but i think it's a bit over implied at the moment  note that i am NOT saying to make a tumblr or western-style humongous nose. Just a suggestion to make the nose + mouth more readable on the face, as the features of the face seem to blend together"
AnimeSketch,3dquet,mauzelP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:26:30 2015 UTC,I'll try to make the mouth and nose stand out more. Thanks.

AnimeSketch,3dpz41,harpans,3,Sat Jul 18 08:52:26 2015 UTC,"She is adorable! I can see that you put up a lot of effort here from how you shaded her, keep that up. The line is also very clear and solid (which is a good thing). I think that her hand is too small compared to the face. The eyes are a little off but it is ok! One last thing is that you should let the hair flows, it might be like that because you are not sure about what her hair should look like. Don't be afraid of doing line art!   Hope to see more from you! :D"
AnimeSketch,3dpz41,NemuiFukurou,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:08:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for a very in depth critique! I'll definitely keep up the practice, proportion is one thing I need a lot of work on."
AnimeSketch,3dpz41,Cyber_Apocalypse,2,Sat Jul 18 21:46:29 2015 UTC,"Looks good! NemuiFukurou has already given a great critique, but i'd like to add some things.  Good Points:   The eyes are perfect in relation to her heads rotation. You made the left eye more compressed and the right eye bigger to emphasise perspective. Eye's are very nicely drawn, they may be like a millimetre/centimetre off, but that's good since it's something that can be improved easily. Her bow around her neck flows very nicely with gravity. Shading is nice, and the bold lines look very nice. The vast majority of the hair has fantastic curves to it, a tip for this (which you don't really need) is don't stick too strictly to the guidelines. Let your pen curve naturally whilst sticking close to the guidelines, this will make your lines alot smoother.   Tips to improve:   Left side hair -> This ones tricky to explain since i usually think of it this way. When i look at her pictures i split her hair into 2 sections. In this case the front and the back. The front is usually curved downwards and is spiked. Whereas the back flows outwards. Also, see reference image below, you can see once her hair reaches the eye it stops suddenly. Six strands of hair touch both eyes overall. So don't be afraid to make them a little longer! Overall hair needs to flow with gravity, from what i gather about Kanade. All her hair flows downwards so ensure all strands aim down once you've drawn them. (http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Angel-Beats-02-4_376.jpg) The right of her hair that flows inwards towards her face needs to be a little bit bigger to cover the blank space on the left of her face. (http://wall4all.me/thumbs/anime-manga/angel-beats-tachibana-kanade-school-876676-480x320.jpg)   Otherwise this is fantastic and i can't wait to see another finished product. Keep it up!  Edit #1: Your artwork on deviantart is awesome! I love the Tokyo Ghoul digital art, i usually stick to traditional, but i've always wondered. Is it easier or harder using a graphics tablet?"
AnimeSketch,3dpz41,Cyber_Apocalypse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:19:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the lengthy and well thought out critique, it's highly appreciated! :)  I'm fairly new to using Tablets and the like, actually. The Tokyo Ghoul piece was more of a test to see what it was like, but I'm glad you like it! As to whether using a Tablet is easier or harder... it's different. I have a Wacom Intuos (The kind where you draw on the tablet and look at your monitor), and it definitely takes some time to get used to. For me, I found it hard not being able to subconsciously re-position my hand on the page to get lines at different angles like when using traditional methods. I think after that learning curve though, drawing digitally has some really cool benefits: re-positioning lines, working in layers, and making snazzy coloured pieces. It has an ever expanding amount of things you could play around with. Working towards making effective digital art is something that I really want to work towards, some stuff people are doing digitally is so amazing!"
AnimeSketch,3dpz41,Miyuki-tan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:15:57 2015 UTC,"I might make a switch to digital for a little while. I've heard the Wacom tablets are very good for beginners. But again, well done with the Tokyo ghoul piece and keep it up!"

AnimeSketch,3dp36c,CakeIsaVegetable,6,Sat Jul 18 02:26:59 2015 UTC,"Here's a redline , I hope you don't mind. I'm hardly an expert or anything, but I did spot a few odd things in the anatomy here and there.  For example, the position of the neck and the head: with anime and cartoons, it's often hard to place the neck correctly when you're not drawing a front-view: many styles will make it seem like the neck is central to the head, when in reality it's centered but from side to side, but not front to back. When a head is tilted like the girl in your drawing, the neck  should make a straighter curve towards the back, following the spine -- mine sucks, because it's lacking the small curve of vertebrae in the base of the neck, but it's closer to where it should be, at least.  The torso itself is a bit stiff: the upper half is good, but the lower half makes an odd angle and looks a bit unnatural, and it looks like only the top half is curving, while the lower half is standing straight.  Another little problem I spot is the joints of the lower half. It looks like there's sharp, non-overlapping angles between the hip and the thigh, then the thigh and the calf. It's a bit hard to explain, I tried showing the overlap in the redline, at least in the hip area. Also, like someone already pointed out, the leg hanging down looks a bit shorter than the one bent up.  Arms and hands, her left upper arm looks a bit too long (I added a bit of muscle weight to the arms I redlined, but I understand anime can have stylized arms be simpler, like what you've got, so the redline is mostly for length/size. The elbow joint has the same problem I mentioned on the lower-half joints, and the hands look a bit like jazz hands, in how the fingers are splayed. Nothing wrong with it, of course, but it makes the drawing look like she's posing for a photo, instead of feeling fully natural. This specially in the right hand holding the wrench: it's a metal object that can be kind of heavy, so when she only partially holds it with a thumb (which isn't properly wrapping around it), it looks a but uncomfortable, like she could drop it anytime. If you were going for her sorta waving ""hi"" to the viewer, just lifting her hand while holding the wrench can give that impression (you can also just go for a ""V"" sign, and it would still give a better glance at a firm grip).  Last note would be on the breast -- sorry for being repetitive, but this one also kind of looks like it's tacked onto the main frame instead of properly attaching and overlapping with her body. While the way it hangs down is not wrong, it makes it's origin point be a bit too high up on the body.  Hope this helps somewhat!"
AnimeSketch,3dp36c,BoxerPanties,2,Sat Jul 18 16:38:39 2015 UTC,"Well for those very few of you who remember I would make a thread called ""Critique me Weekly!"" where I upload all the drawings I made in a week and ask for the /r/animesketch community to critique me but I got very little feedback and developed artist block. So I slowly stopped doing it.  Within that 2 month period of me not creating any threads I've just been super busy. I just bought my 1st motorcycle which I have pictures of drawing it and I also just recently landed my 1st job so hopefully I can save up to build my own computer and buy a wacom tablet to try and further my drawing skill.   And as for this drawing I asked /u/BakaDaioh if I could redraw one of his pieces he recently posted which you can find here in an attempt to get around my artist block and it worked in some effect. I had plans to finish drawing the mech she was sitting on and a highrise tool bench next to her then I realized how just how long that would take and decided to put this in the draft folder for now.  And finally I doubt I will ever bring back the Critique me Weekly threads but I will try to make a new thread maybe once every 1-2 months with all the stuff I've made in it if anyone cares. I already have about 5 new pieces done but you can always view my previous works in my google drive folder here"
AnimeSketch,3dp36c,monkeydeeznutz,2,Sat Jul 18 02:45:58 2015 UTC,"I think that it's pretty good. A few things I noticed. The leg hanging down looks a bit longer than the other. Her back also seems like it's bent a bit harshly. I think the clothing folds could be placed a bit better like at the knee on the left leg. There would probably be creases going into the knee as well as a few going from her thighs to her knee. I think her breast could have a little more shape at the bottom of it. Overall, I think it's good and very clean and the hands look nice!"
AnimeSketch,3dp36c,BakaDaioh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:59:18 2015 UTC,"Legs when hanging off a ledge tend to look slightly elongated like that because everything is relaxed and gravity is pulling on it, her pants are actually pulled tightly across her right knee so there should be no wrinkles, that was my own fault.  Other than that her belly and her back is what I mostly struggled with and will definitely do again. Thanks for looking!"

I like how you put in alot of expression in it! my drawings always end up sleepy -_- also, she does seem like a sort of mech driver :)! as for critique : if you had the idea of a mech and other things, don't worry about finishing it or even making it look clean (maybe bad advice?) just get it drawn scibbling, general shapes or blocks of what you want and let your brain fill in the blanks and it'll help to develop a sense of finding pictures/drawings in shape,form and lines."

I like it but it looks like you didn't finish the face.  Also I like the pointy chin from the sketches more hen he more realistic rounded chin of the final since you went 'full anime' with the render technique on the hair
AnimeSketch,3dn9m8,Jonathan_Rambo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:17:59 2015 UTC,What is pillow shading?
AnimeSketch,3dn9m8,monkeydeeznutz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:56:01 2015 UTC,"its like, objects rendered in an image independent of a consistent light source, common in anime and games where style/aesthetics takes the front seat and realism rides in the backseat or usually trunk."
AnimeSketch,3dn9m8,Jonathan_Rambo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:22:56 2015 UTC,"to a degree ill give you that, in the traditional sense of rendering to imply establishing form by using a consistent lighting source, yes, the hair has a stylized type of rendering more than traditional, but either way the amount of development of the rendering - in whatever style - is more present in the hair than anywhere else in the image, and to that point the hair looks better in that its more stylized than the face which is plain.  If its a character work up sketch, especially if its in an anime/manga style the hair fits the aesthetic infinitely better than the face does which is why it pulls the eye so much more than the face and makes it look less interesting by comparison.  To finish it I'd like to see the same stylized rendering in the face eyes and plane breaks of the cheek and cast shadow under the chin to make it look like an RPG game character rather than a stylized realistic figure, which doesnt usually work well with the anime/manga style"

AnimeSketch,3dnu01,Miyuki-tan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:03:22 2015 UTC,I love your shading and the expression is full of life which I sometimes struggle with. The reflection of the eyes are well placed.  BUT the shoulders have to be symmetrical and that kimono is not very detailed tho. A pattern wouldn't hurt.  The left shoulder has to go down more and is a bit too long. Try drawing your characters naked first and THEN apply the clothes so they appear anatomically correct.  Keep it up!
AnimeSketch,3dnu01,Crient,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:22:35 2015 UTC,"Tried and succeeded. There's only two things that make it look different from the original that I can see.  She looks like she has grown up! This is most likely caused by the size of the head in comparison to the shoulders.  Her hair actually has lines through it to make it look more like hair, rather than just an outline.  I really like it, and your shading is absolutely gorgeous!"

AnimeSketch,3djos0,Miyuki-tan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:19:58 2015 UTC,That cool but if I could suggest.  Try spacing the eyes out from the nose for a more natural face. Also try making a different smile. If you want a more genuine smile make his mouth bigger with more emotion. If your going for a cocky grin then try changing his eyes. They conflict which emotion you are trying to portray I like the beard
AnimeSketch,3dieo9,Crient,2,Thu Jul 16 14:59:48 2015 UTC,"I really like your composition, the focus and the background of your picture is well done. :) Your linework is smooth and the girls are really cute, too!  My advice is that you should practice anatomy a bit, even if anime doesn't seem like it needs it. Places like the fingers, neck, ear and shoulders could just use a bit of touching up to look more natural. The girls' eyes are really quite striking, though in my opinion they could use a little refining as well (the pupil could be smaller, and the shine shouldn't look so structured). All in all, you did a good job, though. :) Keep on improving!"

AnimeSketch,3dfa5a,The0therGuy,2,Wed Jul 15 20:33:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's a pretty cool pose. I noticed the right arm has the upper arm pretty short. His forearm goes all the way up to his sleeve so you might want to edit that. Also something I noticed about the pose. If you hold a bat yourself, you notice that it kind of goes backwards in space. I tried posing with this pose where the bat is straight across the back and it felt like I had to pull my arm pretty far back to get in that position rather than a relaxed arm with the bat resting on my shoulder. I think it's a pretty cool pose though, keep it up!"
AnimeSketch,3dfa5a,monkeydeeznutz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:54:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I'll try to elongate that arm a little bit and make the exact direction the bat is facing a little more obvious. When I tried it in the mirror, it kinda just sat at the back of my neck, so I just winged a little bit (seeing as there's 'not much' neck here). I'll focus on making things a bit clearer, though."

AnimeSketch,3d9xnz,SgtMichaels,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:22:52 2015 UTC,Thanks!   I tried definite wrinkles/folds but I can't seem to get them properly without making it look weird in my eyes...clothing is hard T_T  They are characters from Fire Emblem Awakening and they are married in my game so I kind of tweaked their outfits around to reflect the influence they have on each other. The male is one of the two protagonists of the game who serves as a tactician of the army and the female is of a race closely related to a dragon god and can turn into a dragon.(I'm not sure what flair I'm supposed to use in this case...)
AnimeSketch,3d9xnz,SgtMichaels,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:05:34 2015 UTC,"I think your color choice is interesting, not bad necessarily. However I think the largest issue is the lighting and contrast. It's hard to discern what belongs to who in the picture. If you determine a single light source (or another minor one), follow the logical path of lighting to help put shadows where they should be."
AnimeSketch,3d9xnz,SgtMichaels,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:20:52 2015 UTC,Do you think having another light source is a good idea? I don't really want to take the focus away from the characters anymore than what I have right now with that fancy orb...

AnimeSketch,3cupsv,CakeIsaVegetable,3,Sat Jul 11 16:42:34 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks!  For the skin, I tried something weird. I zoomed out and used a round brush with full shape dynamics and 70% Flow (much higher than I would if I wanted to render). Just kinda tried to chisel out areas with quick strokes until a particular area read like a muscle, and didn't try to do more than that. Certainly it all could be blended up and then textured like skin and all that, but I was going for something that would look rendered when small. Kinda like Magic art, when you see those at a larger size than on the card, they're often really loose, and that's something I always wanted to try going for.   Specifically Peter Mohrbacher's work inspired me for that recently, since his forms are almost photo-realistic when zoomed out. HJL and RA from Pixiv are also big influences on being more painty and less polished."

AnimeSketch,3crxor,Kexzen,3,Fri Jul 10 07:48:21 2015 UTC,I would suggest working in a higher resolution perhaps. The edges of your lines seem a bit pixelated to me. So instead of having your slimmest lines be ~3px wide maybe they can be at least 6 or 10px wide.
AnimeSketch,3crxor,Hourglasspony,2,Fri Jul 10 14:12:16 2015 UTC,"I've had that concern as well, but I didn't think too much on it. Is there a suggested size? I initially started on a 1000x1500 image, but the figure itself turned out to be 432x1224.  Thanks for the feedback! I really appreciate it."
AnimeSketch,3crxor,Hourglasspony,3,Fri Jul 10 14:22:20 2015 UTC,"Work higher than you intend to export. A lot of the time you'll start with a fine resolution and along the way lose track of what you wanted. There is no perfect or recommended size, but I would target your resolution just a bit higher. Most Japanese artists go for crazy high res exports now a days for anime style, so I would follow that trend. (minimum  2Kx2K)  Also don't be afraid of playing with a different brush for inking, sometimes picking a softer brush can also help these sort of pixelated looking lines look better."
AnimeSketch,3crxor,Hourglasspony,2,Sat Jul 11 00:48:10 2015 UTC,"Just one last thing - is there any inconsistencies or errors regarding the figure I drew? Like... did I draw her well? I want to see if there's anything else I can improve on.  Off the top of my head, I think I should work on shading/inking or making it look cleaner by removing frays from lines."
AnimeSketch,3crxor,Miyuki-tan,2,Sat Jul 11 00:59:14 2015 UTC,"More critique:  Hands are the hardest part of anatomy, you did a good job, be proud of those hands.  Shading: Keep is consistent, I think you have 3 or maybe 4 different kinds of shading going on here. 1. shading with thicker outlines on one side, 2. grey cell shading (i.e. under the hair) 3. sketchy line shading. 4. really dark grey shading (black under the hair and chin). Keep it to one style of shading or at most style 1 and 4 together. You do a good job of keeping your light source in mind, so that is a great start.  Hair: The one staple thing that separates most anime characters from one another. With the angle her head is held I should be able to see the part on the top of the head, it is not there though. Use human models of a mirror to see if you know what I mean.  Design: Good character concept, nice outfit. Keep it up.  Legs/feet: Looking at her legs and feet for her to balance/stand like this her weight would have to be distributed to the outside of the foot. Not very comfortable looking, and maybe a bit un-natural because of this.   So yeah, focus on those things for now and I think you'll have improvement in no time. You're already on the right track in having someone else critique what you're doing. If you ever need a second set of eyes PM me, I'm not very good at checking this sub."

AnimeSketch,3coyeg,maxxeh1993,3,Thu Jul 9 16:36:28 2015 UTC,"It's good to see that you're adding on shading now! As with your previous drawing, the eyes are the strong point of this picture. There's multiple degrees of shading, and the eyelashes are quite nice (a small thing, but they're nice all the same).  Critique-wise, the neck is a bit thin; it might not be able to support her head adequately. While anime characters do tend to have thinner necks than what's realistic, it's a little extreme here. Making the neck wider will be a good improvement! I also noticed that the neck lines are more curved in this picture, compared to your first one. Nice work; it looks more realistic!  As for the hair, are the dark parts shading, or are the tips a different color from the rest of the hair? If the former, you could probably add more shading to larger areas; don't be shy with it. For example, if the light source was from the top left, you could probably shade more complete parts on on the bottom right. It's a bit tough to explain, but shading is also something that comes with practice. Gather references and keep at it! Overall, nice work, and good luck progressing!"
AnimeSketch,3coyeg,2infinitiesontheside,2,Thu Jul 9 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"This one and your first one are so cute and well done, especially considering it's your first couple. Would you ever consider doing a full body drawing of her? :D   Onto the critique though! I'm not going to over everything since a lot was already covered in another comment, but here's my two cents.  The top part of the head is a little flat. This creates a slight unbalance because the eyes don't seem like they're in the middle of the head. This is largely because anime hair volume is very exaggerated. I think if you gave more hair volume at the top of the head and rounded it off more towards the sides, it would look more natural. It will also help balance the hair volume on the sides of her head as well.   This issue goes along with the previous issue: her forehead is a bit too small. I am having a hard time trying to figure out where her hairline starts due to the top part of the head being a little flat. Consequently, this makes it hard to imagine where the eyebrows would be placed, which adds to the unbalance in the head. I find that lightly sketching the hairline before adding hair helps a lot with this issue. That way you can make any adjustments to the face before committing on the hair.   This isn't an issue that you have, but since I'm talking about facial placement, I might as well include these small tips:   The bottom of the nose is generally placed at the midpoint between the eyes and the chin. The lips are generally placed at the midpoint between the bottom of the nose and the chin.  I found out that you can either consider the top part of the eyelid to be the middle of the head as well as the center of the actual eye and still have the face look proportionate.    Anyway, other than that, this picture is very readable and is a great start! I hope you continue to post more :D"

AnimeSketch,3clro1,Miyuki-tan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:10:29 2015 UTC,youre style is similar to mine! not in typical manga fashion but definitely influnced (or seems to be). it looks good too!
AnimeSketch,3cmzt2,maxxeh1993,5,Thu Jul 9 04:11:20 2015 UTC,"First, congratulations on getting back into drawing! You've gotten started, and I hope you'll keep drawing even more.  The eyes are really what stand out here. Possibly because of size, but also because they're the only part that's shaded. The viewer easily drawn to them, and they hold attention really well. Nice work!  However, when my eyes start wandering from there, I notice that the ears are a bit on the small side. Normally, people's ears attach at about eye level, with the earlobes at nose level. The positioning can change a bit depending on the person or the angle of the head, and of course the ear size can also vary between people. But making them a bit bigger here would be nice! For reference, I would suggest Googling headshots, or even looking at yourself in the mirror, or people around you.  I also love how you drew the hair. Not too stiff, and there's layers to it. It even looks soft and pettable. :D Keep it up! Hair can be really beautiful and is a lot of fun to draw.  Overall, you've done a great job to start off, and I look forward to seeing how you progress and how your style will develop. Good luck!"

AnimeSketch,3cmzt2,Miyuki-tan,3,Thu Jul 9 17:49:11 2015 UTC,"A bit of a disclaimer, I'm probably very blunt (I often can't tell), but I hope my advice can help you. None of it is meant to put you down, if it sounds that way. I hope this can encourage you!  Your friend is absolutely correct; drawing is a skill, and any skill can be learned. There are arguments about ""talent"" all the time, and whether you put merit behind that or not, the ultimate defining factor for how well you do something is how much you practice that thing. My personal example would be that my brother was considered the ""natural talented artist"" of my generation, but I'm the one who ended up pursuing art as a career. He hasn't worked at his drawing skills at all, and still draws the same as he did when he was nine. ERGO. I'm gonna give you advice as someone who has always been terrible at drawing, but worked really really hard at it because I love drawing so much. Weird thing. HERE WE GO.  So, first of all, understand that drawing has fundamental ""rules."" If you want to improve at drawing, throw away any preconceived notions like ""art is about expression not rules"" and ""this is my style."" Those are examples, but very common excuses that artists come up with. Foundations. The ""anime style"" is still rooted in real anatomy, for example. Different parts of the body will have a general sort of proportion compared to other parts. For example, in your drawing, the eyes are huge. But that's what you're going for-- the problem is that the other features are way too small, and it makes it look off. The ears should be quite a bit larger, for example. Another thing to keep note of is what you're stylizing versus what you're imitating. The tiny ""dot nose"" is common in anime styles, but think about what you're representing with it. Is it the tip of the nose? A shadow? This is important for when you render the rest of your drawing. I'm weird, I draw the noses on my characters. I just like them, they add depth. But when you're omitting it, you should understand why.   The main thing I'll suggest for improving is just drawing a lot. You haven't drawn in TWELVE YEARS. That's insane. I feel miserable when I go a single day without drawing. So the first thing you should work on is getting more drawing into your schedule. Try to draw every day. It doesn't matter what you draw, just get into the habit and have fun with it. Draw from your imagination, draw from photos, draw from life, even copy existing drawings that inspire you (just don't post them as your own). Once you're drawing every day, the whole activity of drawing will feel more natural, and the quality of what you produce will improve from that alone.  Once you're drawing every day, you should dedicate some time to specifically studying. For example, study real human anatomy. I'd start with the face, mostly because faces are the most fun to draw(for me). Doing realistic studies would help you understand and appreciate the real forms in the face, and help you translate to a more believable anime style. Perhaps you'll work out other stuff for your style of drawing. Even just studying features like noses and ears in isolation will greatly inform your drawing ability. When you move on to figure drawing, start with gesture drawing (in case you don't know, these are quicker, looser drawings meant to convey form and motion rather than detail and polish). Learn anatomy. Andrew Loomis books are very good and a popular go-to for learning anatomy.   Worry about stuff like coloring later on, but don't be afraid to dip into it if you feel you're ready. Especially if you're just going to have fun with it. But for improving on drawing, I'd work on those above things specifically. That should all be enough to get you started. Mostly, draw more and have fun with it.  Uhm, in conclusion, here's a draw-over thing I did with some notes, maybe that can help you as well. I'm assuming the kind of style you're going for."

AnimeSketch,3clm32,JetFalco,3,Wed Jul 8 21:28:22 2015 UTC,"Heyo, I really think you have potential so I just want to say a few things.  Some things I noticed:  The ribcage kind of goes down a little more before curving a bit for the waist. See here (slightly nsfw): https://i.imgur.com/2V7rrOB.jpg . Ignore the boobs here, the perspective and the pushing is skewing where her boobs actually are. The chest in your picture is actually positioned quite well.  You'll also notice that the shoulder muscles are slightly off, it's easier to define the shoulder muscles into groups like deltoids, the round part of the shoulder that connects to the torso, biceps, and triceps, which are on the other side of the biceps.  You can google for a few pictures of poses and notice how the muscles are defined depending on what position the arms are in, especially in women, who have higher body fat percentage and in which case the muscles might not show unless tensed.  The neck is also slightly long and thin, and you could give her more trapezius muscles, which are the sort of triangular shaped muscles that support the neck. See: http://www.uhh.hawaii.edu/~ronald/Talk-for-poster-Web_files/image019.jpg (ignore the arrow, I think it's just pointing to a specific muscle, I meant the area altogether if you google ""trapezius"").  Now the face is a little odd in places, partially due to the stylistic nature of anime and the fact that faces are hard and just need a lot of practice to get right. However, I'd suggest moving the nose upward a little bit. As a rule of thumb, the nose is halfway between the middle of the eyes and the chin, and the mouth is halfway between that or so. The nose and eyes are generally a little closer in anime too to give a cuter appearance.  Now as for the nice things I noticed:  I did notice that you had a bicep line on the right arm, which would be tensed when holding up the gun, which is pretty good.  I really liked the overall shading and the amount of detail you put into the belts and the guns. The equipment and the clothing are pretty good, and like I said before the breasts are positioned anatomically correctly and I like that you actually drew hints of the ribcage consider how low her body fast percentage seems to be. The collarbone is also in the right place too, which is nice.  Overall, sorry about the really long critique, but I noticed that on the sidebar that critiques and suggestions were allowed in this subreddit and this place kind of looked like the place to post stuff and get advice on. I normally wouldn't really do something like this but I really like the amount of work into the picture and how well the shading and other aspects were done, and I think that you just need a bit of touching up in certain areas to get really, really nice pictures.  Hope this was helpful."

AnimeSketch,3cjjlm,pastelfont,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:34:55 2015 UTC,"The color palette looks great so far! I like that you have a bit of cool coloring on the bottom to balance out the warmer colors in the majority of the picture. Plus, the reds add a sense of adventure to it, either like the sun is shining down on someone who found treasure, or there's a fire wreaking havoc in the background. Either one, haha.  For the anatomy, there's something a bit off about the right arm--maybe the hand is too large? Or the forearm could use a bit of foreshortening; somehow it seems a bit long. However, the facial expression is quite nice and mischievous. Can't wait to see the finished version!"

AnimeSketch,3cgvug,_NotImportant,5,Tue Jul 7 20:32:17 2015 UTC,there's some serious use and abuse of elipses. Makes the dramatic monologue feel really try-hard
AnimeSketch,3cgvug,FleshgodApocalypse,2,Tue Jul 7 22:04:48 2015 UTC,I don't really understand what you mean... Can you elaborate?
AnimeSketch,3cgvug,DaymanMaster0fKarate,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:12:21 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you're making a joke or not, but using ellipses (...) a lot breaks up the flow of writing.  Check out this page www.ninahess.com/stop-now-can-prevent-ellipsis-abuse/  When you want to use an ellipsis, consider if you should be using a comma, dash, or no ellipsis at all instead."

You could still improve a bit with the proportion, I think. (imagine where her body is under the dress... her legs are slightly misaligned with her shoulders/torso. If you want her knees to be bent, maybe they could be drawn more obviously?) And keep practicing hands in different angles (the hand in front looks a little bit square).

AnimeSketch,3cc9hm,XepherTim,2,Tue Jul 7 00:15:03 2015 UTC,I think it's the lines around the fingers.
AnimeSketch,3cc9hm,mr_enthusiasm,2,Tue Jul 7 01:06:47 2015 UTC,"Good point, that's probably it. I'll try to remove the outlines."
AnimeSketch,3cc9hm,calponpon,2,Tue Jul 7 08:20:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. My thought was that the amount of shadowing on the fingers was quite a bit less than the rest of the image making them look flat compared with other parts of the image such as the hat (which I think is my favorite part of the image, I really like the hat)"
AnimeSketch,3cc9hm,Miyuki-tan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:43:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions, you two. I'll add some more shading to the hands and maybe get rid of the outlines that way."

AnimeSketch,3c88te,mmm_steak,3,Sun Jul 5 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"Amusing idea! I like the character design and the design of the jet pack.   The perspective of the girl does appear to be different from the perspective of the craft she's attached to. It looks to be straight on whereas the jetpack is at an angle. Definitely practice perspective some more.  Also, her pose looks like she's standing up rather than dangling from the craft. You might try experimenting with ways to communicate the same amusing idea/attitude while making it look more natural.   In general: don't be afraid to do several small rough thumbnail sketches before you spend a lot of time on the finished product. It really helps nail down perspective issues, pose, composition, etc before you start locking down details."

I think the nose, hair and face shape are pretty accurate, but I just can't get the eyes and mouth. It's for a friend's movie so it has to be instantly recognizable. Any tips are appreciated!"

AnimeSketch,3bep7z,LimbohBimboh,3,Sun Jun 28 15:18:15 2015 UTC,"I am really loving the colors and shading in this piece.  The only thing that is confusing my brain is her right arm. It looks like her shoulder is coming out of her arm pits.  Also a suggestion, I think the lollipop would be easier to see if it was sticking outwards so the silhouette suggests that there is a lollipop in there.  Everything else is great.  The colors, the shading, the line art, the eyes, etc.  I'm actually really loving how her irises have a thick outline.  Keep at it! :)"

AnimeSketch,3bfwgq,Heartless50,3,Sun Jun 28 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"The anatomy for both characters seems pretty shaky. In a scene with any sort of complex posing it's doubly important to understand the basics of the anatomical form. Even if these characters aren't technically 'human' its very important to learn human anatomy so that you can alter it more accurately with things are aren't human (like your titan). I'll link a really wonderful youtube channel that covers the basics of anatomy below. Its a great tool and I think it'd really help you out.  https://www.youtube.com/user/ProkoTV  As for the rest of the piece it seems a little cluttered, making it difficult to understand exactly whats happening.   All and all though there's plenty of potential here and you should definitely keep working at it. Hope this helps! :D"
AnimeSketch,3bfwgq,keavah,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:04:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for advice, but could you show where you think the anatomy is off setting with the two characters? And yes the shaky bit of this because this was really rough sketch lol. So I figure someone would state that XD"
AnimeSketch,3bfwgq,keavah,3,Mon Jun 29 19:30:32 2015 UTC,The limbs seem to just be two connected 'bulges' if that makes since. Its important to remember the bone and muscle structure for each limb and that it will compress or stretch depending on the positioning of the limb. I've attached a basic example below.  http://www.the-blueprints.com/blueprints-depot-restricted/humans/anatomy/arm-26655.jpg I'd also look into the hands and feet as well. At the moment they seem overly simplified and a bit off in perspective. I'll attach some examples of hand and feet posing below. They're also pretty cartoony and simplistic so it should be an easier transition for you rather than pure realism . Hands:  https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/37/26/eb/3726eb160df9882acb858a4bedd47254.jpg Feet:  http://imgs.steps.dragoart.com/how-to-sketch-feet-step-3_1_000000041827_5.jpg  Finally I can't stress enough the importance of looking up reference BEFORE starting work on a piece you may not have much experience in. Reference is extremely useful and will help your anatomy by leaps and abounds if utilized correctly.

Such as this art feeling a bit too muted, and that there are not enough elements in it that make it pop nor command attention.  Here is my deviantArt for a feel of the rest of my style and see what you agree with in my other work.  Thank you for your time."
AnimeSketch,3bdsby,xTyd,2,Sun Jun 28 07:14:06 2015 UTC,"Proportions aside, I'd say you could work/add some more ""thought"" and definition to this piece of work.  This is in line with your comment on over minimalizing.  For example, his forearm looks 2 dimensional, there's no shading or muscular definition and bit off on foreshortening.  They also look static to me - their pose could be adjusted to create a more compelling composition.  You have a piece you called ideology in your deviantart profile which I thought is a bit more... complete(?).    Just my ignorant 2 cents."

The hair shading and the points at where it crosses over on top of the head is a tad bit confusing to me. It looks a little off to where the crown usually would sit.  Both eyes are very beautiful, but don't really seem to be a pair working together. (Disclaimer I'm terrible with eyes) I want to say it's the angle, but it might just be because the right eye (her left) is darker.  (P.S. Love the hair accessory, and the rest of the piece is immaculate)"

SAI has an option called ""Stabilizer"" in most of its tools and I suggest playing around with those settings until you get a feel for which level is more comfortable to you. Then as time goes by and it starts to feel ""stiff"", you can lower the setting a bit more and continue lowering it until you get to your sweet spot. For me, I use a stabilizer of 6 and have been using it for a long time.   I see you have the option to change the stroke size based on pressure turned on; personally I've stopped using it because I didn't like giving up control of the line any longer and it used to frustrate me to no end when my lines wouldn't match up in thickness over a long distance (say, when drawing legs or arms, things of the sort). Of course, your lines lose quite a bit of character if you do that, but that's the style I like better for myself - but try it and see if you like it.  Last but not least, don't be afraid of working with the pen/pencil tools and just erasing your lines with the eraser tool to give them the look you want - this is actually my preferred style these days, just use a thick, soft brush and erase away the lines I don't want. It's fun to do and less stressful in a lot of ways for me. Since you have a chicken-scratchy line style, I feel like this would work really well for you."

AnimeSketch,3avk3t,kenarious,5,Tue Jun 23 21:10:40 2015 UTC,"Great analysis! And anyone wondering why the schools always look exactly the same, I've substitute-taught in about 80 schools of Tokyo now, and honestly... apart from the ones built in the last ten years, they really all do look like that.  Edit for interest: Lowest performers, behaviour issue kids consistently sit on the left (teacher's point of view). Quiet kids usually on the right edge. The middle has the most communicative, usually best at English, ones. Totally unremarkable kids in the backseat window chair, normally! Actually, come to think of it, I see a lot of kids who won't put away their sketchbook and are just drawing manga all lesson along the right edge. First year junior high schoolers are well behaved, co-operative and diligent. Second years start sleeping, getting in fights, shouting, refusing to work, third years have a bit of that but are generally more chill and have figured out how far they can push rules without overstepping the teachers' boundaries."

AnimeSketch,3aw3mf,hash_m,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:45:04 2015 UTC,CamStudio for capturing your screen. You can set the frame rate at which to record at and also the frame rate which it plays back once you stop recording so you can speed up the video right away. VirtualDub for any further editing. You can change the frame rate again using this to speed up or slow down your video. That's the combo I used to make some sped up videos.

AnimeSketch,3aq1ou,shonjo,2,Mon Jun 22 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"I am loving these pose studies!  They all look really great and I'm really digging the dynamic poses!  I am most definitely not an experienced artist, but I'd like to post my 2c. :) That said, here are some observations about each individual piece:   The first thing I notice with this one is that it looks a bit off balance. If you rotated it slightly counter clockwise, she would look like a little more solid.  Also, the calves and feet look a little strange to me but I think it's because the drawing is still rough. I'm really digging on the silhouette of her back. This pose is awesome! I get that the drawing is still rough, but the right arm and hand look a little short to me. Once again, the back silhouette really draws my eyes.  The one things that look kinda strange to me are the right upper arm and right foot. Overall this pose looks great! The only thing that jumps out to me immediately is the left thigh. The upper calf/lower thigh area is the only thing that my eyes jump to when looking for something to critique. Maybe her right calf is a bit too long? I am a bit confused as to what she's doing with her right arm/hand. It looks a little painful. Other than that, this pose looks good. I am really digging her left arm, it looks so natural. Solid pose study.  There is nowhere that my eyes immediately jump to when looking for something to critique. This is a fun pose, I'm enjoying the hands and arm placement.  The only thing I can really critique on is her left knee area.  It's looking a little thinner than her right knee area. Another fun pose! There's nothing major that my eyes immediately go to.  That said, what's that under her chest area?"

AnimeSketch,3a8xh6,ss977,3,Thu Jun 18 04:04:50 2015 UTC,"Heyy, your art is looking better and better! Your lines and level of detail are really good. Regarding those magic sphere things, I'm of the conviction that letting the filter effects do most of the work is best. For example, I did this in literally 4 clicks on the canvas. Change the color and you can get this. That was just one click of an airbrush and three clicks of brush/pencil. For glowy things, Luminosity for SAI or Add (glow) on CSP work wonders, but you can play around with other filters for different effects.  Regarding your shading, IMO, it could definitely be improved on. The feeling I get from it is, uh, unconfident? It's all very soft and doesn't help to make the clothing pop out. In this case though, your choice of colors and the shear amount of gold outlining everything helps to counteract that. If you took away the gold, it might look pretty bland.   That's just my two cents. I'm not confident enough in drawing hands or shading to really go deeper, but I can try to discuss about it more if you are of the same opinion."
AnimeSketch,3a8xh6,Aeirsus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:09:19 2015 UTC,Thanks! And yeah I agree. I think my shading lacks definite touches. I think I should try to cell-shade on top of what I have right now and see how that works out. Do you think this is a good idea?
AnimeSketch,3a8xh6,carlypanda,2,Thu Jun 18 06:52:04 2015 UTC,"I think it would be smart to use a combination. Right now all your shadows are very soft, and it's flattening your characters. Try using a combination of hard and soft shadows to give them a more realistic sense of volume. Don't be afraid to push your values a little more either. You've got some really dramatic lighting set up, and this piece has the potential to be really stunning."

I can't put my finger on exactly what it is, but there is a lack of softness in the linework. It feels overly rigid.  Overall, this piece is great. The colors are great, and the sword is incredibly cool looking!"

AnimeSketch,3a74p6,Aeirsus,3,Wed Jun 17 19:25:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, the model and perspective look great! The only thing I can see is some inconsistency with the brick sizes and placement. If you're going for that 1-2-1 brick stack pattern, it helps to draw vertical guidelines as brick demarcations for every other level."
AnimeSketch,3a74p6,Aeirsus,2,Wed Jun 17 22:00:37 2015 UTC,"Hey Aeirsus, thank you for your critique! The bricks' misalignment was a dumb oversight by me as I did make a couple of vertical lines along the wall, yet completely forgot to use them for any purpose.  I feel overwhelmingness may have had a role of this; no one likes nor looks forward to drawing bricks, after all. I'll pay attention to this from now on."

Tweaked the eyebrows a little but the width is going to stay realistic. Main problem is definitely the eyes, probably because I did a rough sketch and didn't measure the proportions and feel the form. Can't redo it anymore though since I deleted the construction lines."

My tablet driver isnt working and i cant hold down my pen to draw lines and im too lazy to redownload the driver to solve my issue. So i edited the picture a bit. Decreasing the chin and slender the neck. Im not sure if its an improvement after staring at faces for a long time, i tend to cant tell the difference after a while"

AnimeSketch,3a67wt,pastelfont,2,Wed Jun 17 16:44:52 2015 UTC,"Reason why she has helmet hair is because you are not following the standard face proportion. The standard rule for eye height is some where between the top of the head (without hair) and the chin. So thing now is that all proportions beneath the eyes are all okay, but above eyes are a bit off. Since you all ready drew this on lined paper it really easy to tell how much you are off. On the face beneath the eyes you have about 4 blank lines, while above 6.5. Which will cause your brain to conclude that 2.5 of those lines are all hair causing the hair helmet effect."

A lot of times in anime it seems they are a drawn little bit cross-eyed when they have large eyes. I made a crappy mspaint picture showing the difference, the top is whats in the Shinobu picture and the bottom is how I see most people do their eyes: http://imgur.com/TtkXeyN  In general I usually measure it by, if the character is looking forward, to be sure that the outside part of the sclera is larger than the inside part of the sclera that is closer to the nose. Eyes in real life also seem to do this: http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2125210/images/o-EYES-facebook.jpg"

If you want something minor about what you've done, maybe you could exaggerate some of the sizes - for instance you could squash the back eye. Although thats just if you want to play around with the proportions."

AnimeSketch,3a1kus,Miyuki-tan,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:48:17 2015 UTC,"Hey, great start! Your coloring style is very nice, I think your drawing could use a little improvement though. The biggest thing I'm seeing is how long her torso is. I did a quick edit using the liquefy tool, so you can see what I mean. Its not amazing, but you can see I consolidated her figure a little, broadened her shoulders, and changed her legs a bit to reflect the pose.  It really helps you notice mistakes like this when you mirror your image, or just look at the silhouette. Sometimes you need to disassociate a little to figure out what's not working."

AnimeSketch,3a2py7,Aeirsus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:38:24 2015 UTC,"If you're having problems with the body, I'd suggest 2-3 things. First is to practice being able to see lines of action. This helps induce a sense of harmony and flow to your character's pose, making it look more natural and dynamic. Second is to do some [30-second to 1-minute pose practices](www.posemaniacs.com/thirtysecond). This will help with getting you to see how bodies contort and force you to focus on the overall pose rather than the muscle details. Third is to work on the anatomy itself.  Here is my take on it."

AnimeSketch,39xyk8,DaymanMaster0fKarate,3,Mon Jun 15 20:28:53 2015 UTC,"something about the proportion in the legs feels really off. I don't think either or them is just right, one feels a bit too long and the foreshortening on the other doesn't feel.. right.    I'd also bring the canvas down to give yourself more space on the bottom to draw. There's too much going on down there and not enough space for the eye to take it in and give it a chance to rest.  A bit more neutral/negative space will accentuate the element of the magic circle more."

You should be about to squeeze an eye between the two which doesn't occur in the guy on the left. That's about all I could see though! Good job!

AnimeSketch,39imu1,Darkraiftw,2,Thu Jun 11 23:48:27 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty sound structure wise. Only two things I really would like to point out.  The hair is a little bit on the boring side. For only being a head portrait it really stands out and I feel like a little bit of extra effort would go a long way to making it look better. brief examples  The lineart is quite stiff. It definitely looks like you used a straight line tool to go over your original sketch. If you'd like to keep using a line tool use a curvy one (even paint has one, I like the one in Krita). If you're really not up to it and your PC can handle the extra stress, draw your pictures extra, extra, extra large, that way when you zoom out to a viewing size it looks less stiff and more curvy."
AnimeSketch,39imu1,Savage_A,2,Fri Jun 12 08:59:27 2015 UTC,"You're correct, I went over it with the line tool. I'm not sure if GIMP even has a curve tool, but I'll keep that in mind.  In regards to the detail, I would've added more if I wasn't intending to practice shading on it. I'm not too good at it yet, so I figured I should practice on something a little simpler first."
AnimeSketch,39imu1,Savage_A,2,Fri Jun 12 11:33:32 2015 UTC,I think this is the curved line tool that GIMP users have available. (not all that fluent with GIMP sorry)  https://youtu.be/EA8mZsPbcyI?t=1m14s

AnimeSketch,39d7q0,Shinite,5,Thu Jun 11 04:28:00 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. :) I didn't want to make this post look like an ad for the game or anything, so I didn't put much for details. It will be a 2d platformer with hand drawn art (just like this drawing here and the background) that involves exploring a level to collect all the gems to move on to the next level. You play as one of three Magical girls, all linked together as a single entity, meaning you can swap between them seamlessly. Each girl has different abilities and you will need to use all three to get through certain areas and defeat different types of enemies. I'm aiming for over 100 levels to complete and there will be a full story (told with visual novel style cutscenes). The gameplay is fast and will require quick thinking to overcome the levels. Initially it will be a PC game, but I plan to develop an Android and iOS version as well.   Right now, I have the game play code, music and sound effects done with placeholder graphics (aka it doesn't look pretty). I'm working on the art now!   Thanks for asking, hope that answers your question. :)"

AnimeSketch,39627z,LimbohBimboh,3,Tue Jun 9 14:50:38 2015 UTC,I like your painting style very much! Maybe a bit of line weight variation. Thicker lines around her outline.

AnimeSketch,39627z,BoundAndBoiled,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:52:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion. Some line weight variation would probably make the drawing look more interesting.

AnimeSketch,38sqsf,hash_m,7,Sat Jun 6 14:22:54 2015 UTC,White listed domains that posts should originate from
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,Jeroz,8,Sat Jun 6 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"confession: I never look at the submissions if I see the links go to dA.   Most often of not people don't link the direct picture so I would have to go load up all the random crap on the site before the actual picture is loaded. I browse reddit on my phone a lot, so I have tendency to hate unnecessary junk wasting my bandwidth.  Same goes to tumblr, but people tend to be better at it with that domain."
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,calponpon,8,Sat Jun 6 14:34:43 2015 UTC,"At the moment, links to dA/Imgur/Tumblr/pixiv are allowed (although I can't recall anyone posting to pixiv so far).   Changing the rules to ONLY allow imgur and direct img links would be for the best, IMO. Usually, people who browse this sub are reluctant to click on links that don't head to imgur/direct img (usually because they take longer to load/annoying popups on pixiv/aren't supported by RES/browsing on mobile devices), so enforcing this as a new rule would guarantee everyone's posts get more attention.  Of course people would be able to link to whatever hosting site they want in the comments of their post."
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,MissyPie,5,Sat Jun 6 14:34:51 2015 UTC,"+1 :3 If the image doesn't show up in RES I usually won't bother to go and look at it, because I'm lazy, but still... only allowing Imgur/direct IMG links is a good idea."
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,ApocalypticOrchestra,5,Sat Jun 6 14:39:49 2015 UTC,"Uhm I actually like to link to the DA page of the picture because it would allow me to edit it later on, I'm kind of worried every time I submit something and I really can't stand it if I made a very stupid mistake that I spot later but can't change anymore, I wouldn't mind if my picture doesn't get as much exposure because of that, but for me it's a great confidence boost to know that I can still change stuff later on."
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,ApocalypticOrchestra,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:17:17 2015 UTC,"Wait, would we be allowed to just link to an imgur album with only the one picture in it? That would mean one could still edit it afterwards and have the link working. Would that still count as direct URL?"
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,calponpon,2,Sat Jun 6 22:46:58 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. It should be fine if you can preview the image from reddit.
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,ApocalypticOrchestra,2,Sun Jun 7 03:26:34 2015 UTC,Is that a criteria? because DA posts get thumbnails too don't they? Or am I thinking of the wrong kind of DA post?
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,calponpon,2,Sun Jun 7 20:54:56 2015 UTC,I think I phrased that completely wrong. Linking to an imgur album should be fine since no one really has an issue with loading it. The problem with linking to a dA page as opposed to the image by itself is that it's more tedious to load (especially for mobile users afaik). I guess that's why we're having this community discussion to figure out what most people are interested in.

AnimeSketch,38sqsf,calponpon,4,Sun Jun 7 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"Already brought this up in mod-mail so I will copy/paste here:   We could always consider only allowing people who actively participate in the community to promote their Patreons/Commissions etc.  That's how to works in /r/anime, you may promote your own content as long as you also make unrelated posts and comments. It's 1 'self-promotion' post for every 10 other posts/comments. But we could make it lower.   My idea is, as long as you are an active community member, you may promote your commissions or any other money-making-art-thing within the comments of your submission. 'Active' would be making comments, giving C/S, posting art that doesn't link to your money-making-art-thing, getting involved with events, etc.  This way we won't get artists who 'abuse' the sub and only post to make money (not that we currently have any like this IMO), and maybe we might even be able to increase activity ^ ^  If we needed to give it a number like /r/anime, 1:3 could work, aka for every 3 unrelated comments/submissions you may advertise your stuff once. However, I don't think a number is necessary, as we don't have 250k subscribers like /r/anime :p  I'd like to hear what other people think about this idea~"
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,calponpon,7,Sat Jun 6 14:49:45 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's not very nice to just dump one's art here and then not give back to the community.   Not sure if the system would work though, since they can just comment ""noice"" or something on every post."
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,_Nevertide,3,Sat Jun 6 14:57:31 2015 UTC,"Hopefully (if we ever end up implementing a system like this) it shouldn't be an issue if we allow C/S on every post, regardless of the title, so people have more to discuss.."
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,MissyPie,2,Sat Jun 6 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"+1, and yeah, a strict ratio is probably not needed for a sub this size."
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,_Nevertide,2,Sat Jun 6 14:52:32 2015 UTC,+1  I think a 1:3 ratio is perfectly reasonable given the size of the sub. I believe that /r/animesketch is not the place to use for solely promoting your own revenue stream.
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,MissyPie,2,Sat Jun 6 14:52:48 2015 UTC,"Can we reserve the rights to whine when someone posts an image with obscene levels of self-promotion, and pandering. My post was more about standards, and catering for promotion within the community in general, which isn't something you can really fix with rules.  Also, that idea gives a nice reward for those who are active in the sub. Which is  good. As you said it should stop abuses that could occur if we outright allow all posts with self-promotion."
AnimeSketch,38sqsf,iamnotfurniture,4,Sat Jun 6 15:33:24 2015 UTC,"I don't really think 'whining' belongs in the form of image submissions. As a discussion post, sure, but as an image post it goes against the main theme of the sub imo."

However, the submissions will be undoubtedly dominated by swimsuits/bikinis/boobs/abs/etc, which some people will have issues with.  I think having a common theme between all the submissions will be cool. My question is, what are your thoughts on having summer as this event's theme?

Same with the hair ties; your lighting there looks like the light source is coming from behind,but the rest of her face has no shading.  Do you know the basic guidelines for drawing faces? I just did a tutorial that might be helpful. https://www.patreon.com/posts/2618820  The eyes definitely should be lowered, brows added etc. The eyes are slightly different shaped but you're generally doing really really well. One quick way to check for symmetry is to get a mirror and look at your picture through it. Another way I sometimes use when I don't have a mirror handy is that I look at the backside of the picture while facing a bright light. But most of all, drawing the basic shapes and using guides, especially when you're starting out is especially helpful.  Do study actual human anatomy. When you understand real world proportions, it'd be that much easier to stylize. X)  Hope that helped."

I did a tutorial recently that might help http://imgur.com/mwWOWMr  When you draw, be it with reference or not, it is good to breakdown the picture into basic shapes : head is oval, fingers are cylinders etc. This facilitates the understanding of the picture in 3D and will help you understand anatomy a lot more instead of simply copying what you see. It also helps you keep symmetry when it is necessary.  Hope that helps X)"

I might still use guidelines after i have one or two things in but i cant start with them.i do tend to use them more when not drawing from reference though.  Im quite good at visualising things in 3d, including hands, but getting them on paper is hard :P"

AnimeSketch,38f101,MrJHound,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:18:21 2015 UTC,"Hey dear! First of all, great job on the clean lines. X)  Do you use reference for your character poses? It's actually pretty awkward to sit with both knees pointing inwards in this position. You have some minor anatomical errors there as well. The head is slightly too big for her body. Her forearms are a teensy bit too long.   Proportionately, your forearm should end slightly above the belly button. When the leg is folded up like that there should be more muscles at the calves and the thighs. Her left shoulder should be raised since she is supporting her body on the rails. Right one too since her arm is lifted up.  I suggest doing some life drawings and gesture sketches to beef up on your anatomy skills. That and to use photo reference as well. It's common for artists to take pictures of themselves in poses they want to draw if ready reference is not available. It also negates the problem with the unnatural poses because you'd experience it firsthand.  Hope that helps X)"

AnimeSketch,38aqoz,etsuuko,6,Wed Jun 3 00:14:36 2015 UTC,"I'd say don't worry about that for now, just learn the fundamentals. Good character design comes with time and experience.  Also everyone has a different opinion on things like this.  I'd say those designs look bland to me because they are super generic and have no flair, as well as bad color design on top of characters themselves who are pretty boring to look at.  The costumes seem to both do too much and too little at the same time. They should be simplified. If you look at one piece, the costumes there are cool and memorable, but also not super complicated.  Now look at something like Guilty Gear, where the costumes are cool and more complicated, but have a nice unified color scheme.  I don't know where I'm going with this, sorry..."
AnimeSketch,38aqoz,DaymanMaster0fKarate,2,Wed Jun 3 13:00:07 2015 UTC,"I agree; the colour schemes for those characters look erratic and boring. Either make a character's outfit simple, or have a complex outfit that is uniform throughout, IMO."
AnimeSketch,38aqoz,calponpon,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:52:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, I see, so the color choices and outfits is what mostly makes them boring.   And what do you mean by flair? Like, something unique in their hair/outfit that makes them different from characters in other shows?  And another thing that I was wondering about, do character stereotypes play into this as well? Like, if you look at each character and judging by their designs, you can guess what kind of personality they'll have?"
AnimeSketch,38aqoz,DaymanMaster0fKarate,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:12:22 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I don't really know how to explain flair. I've only been drawing seriously about 3 months and don't actually watch a huge amount of anime.  Character stereotypes can be good or bad. It can be boring or repetitive, or sometimes it can be used effectively, or even in surprising ways. I love when a character seems stereotypical but they end up contradicting it. That's probably why people love tsundere characters."

AnimeSketch,38aqoz,Naluc,3,Wed Jun 3 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"Seriously, it depends. You never REALLY know what's going to attract people to a character and everybody has different opinions. Since you're just starting out, try to focus on gaining skill and practicing the basics of drawing characters before you worry about how well they are designed."
AnimeSketch,38aqoz,InvErtUO,2,Thu Jun 4 03:15:22 2015 UTC,"For the purposes of designing, the things you should know the most are   Posing for a strong silhouette. Know what kind of postures your character will take. It's not just about how the character looks visually, but also about the body language and the way they stand/move.  You can design the most visually impressive thing with the best lighting a fantastic color with the coolest outfit you've ever seen, but if they're standing in a straight up and down pose they're going to lose their flair entirely.  It's best if no two characters of yours stand in the same way, so that if you have groups reduced to black silhouettes, you can generally tell who is who.  Though this is better for storytelling, it's still good to know how to pose compositionally as well.  having a strong silhouette leads for a very visually pleasing character.  When designing a character, What they're wearing or carrying should tie in with their character somehow.  You don't have to lay out the entire character's backstory in their clothes, but if they're meant to follow some kind of archetype, you should research successful characters of that archetype and see what they have in common. Cliches are not necessarily a bad thing, as they can be used as a nod to the audience that knows what to expect when they see a certain thing, or as a jumping-off point for a different interpretation of the trope.   Make sure the character has something iconic to them. Whether it be a certain way they dress, their weapon, or an accessory they wear. Something that defines their individuality from the crowd and makes them easy to pick out. However, you DON'T have to overdo it. it doesn't have to be some horribly color-clashing piece that sticks out like a sore thumb on their design. It's best if it fits their personality somehow, with some forethought into color theory.   Take breaks from drawing a character for a while and come back to them , try them in different angles, different poses, or try changing something fundamentally about them to see if they're any better. Get other people's opinions as well. You don't HAVE to get it right on the first try, and nobody ever really has. I can assure you that most characters have had several scrapped iterations before reaching what they are now. It's also important to note that not everyone is going to like your character design. Go with what you feel is best. You are the artist."

I've been wanting to sell my stuff at an anime convention but am unsure how it would be received given the fact that many people say it doesn't fit the genre. So, I guess it does matter to me what my art gets labeled as because I would like to know what kind of audience I can cater to in order to make money."
AnimeSketch,386bya,DaymanMaster0fKarate,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:57:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, that may be an exception then if you're targeting a particular audience. Sorry to say it but people on some places of reddit (although not /r/AnimeSketch, to my inital surprise) as well as some anime fans in general are kinda close-minded about what they like.  I think your style is fine because I personally also like things like more realistic noses, but if you want to sell to anime fans at a con easily, you should pander as much as you can to what they want. Also if you do on the spot commissions expect people to be overly particular and critical, from what my friend who used to do them tells me.   I think fanboys/girls in general tend to be this way, because I see the same thing with some western comic/scifi/fantasy fans.  I think if you start posting your pictures to tumblur and start reblogging and following people you like you can gain a following and also gauge your fanbase better. Keep in mind I've only been drawing seriously like 3 months but this is what I've gathered so far from my perspective."
AnimeSketch,386bya,calponpon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"That's very helpful. It's taken me a very long time to develop my style and I would like to continue to work on it, but I hear what you're saying about the importance of appealing to the audience.  I have been having a lot of difficulty gaining any sort of fan base on tumblr and have thought about reblogging posts to gain views/popularity. However, I'm just don't know how to balance the act of reblogging other people's posts while still maintaining it as my ""art blog."""

AnimeSketch,383ygl,Miyuki-tan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:06:23 2015 UTC,What method did you do to study the muscle groups of the body?
AnimeSketch,383ygl,DaymanMaster0fKarate,2,Mon Jun 1 18:16:07 2015 UTC,I've never done an art study or whatever it's called. I just look for reference sometimes to see where the muscles are positioned. And I can kinda picture them in 3d space. So I don't have to look for a specific pose or anything. In this case I didn't use any reference aside from the character reference.

Also the middle part of her hair at the top of her head, instead of lumping in the middle, would be split into two lumps along the center of her head, since it is being pulled in either direction towards the pigtails. You should split the bangs from the mass of hair that is going into the pigtails."

AnimeSketch,37vgzi,Naluc,1 point,Sat May 30 19:05:58 2015 UTC,"so I tried another chibi or something completely arbitrary, but I got stuck on how to move forward. The heads.. alright, I guess. but I have absolutely no idea what I want to do for the body.  And try for the life of me, I just can't seem to make smooth curves. I'm not sure if my hand's just inept or what.   Would gladly take any advice or suggestion on how to improve further in either drawing better lines, coloring, or what to do for body/clothes/pose."
AnimeSketch,37vgzi,calponpon,1 point,Sat May 30 19:08:02 2015 UTC,"Hey, I wouldn't worry too much; your hands are fine :p Being able to draw smooth lines is just a matter of repetition until it becomes part of your muscle memory. Try to use quick, confident brushstrokes as opposed to slow, cautious lines.   Drawing bodies is complicated, and it will take a while to get used to drawing them. The general process would be to roughly sketch out your entire body/pose first instead of drawing  your character bit by bit (having a complete sketch helps to ensure your proportions are correct right off the bat).   Study anatomy/proportions, but take it slowly. Learn one thing at a time (e.g. facial proportions, then upper body + arms, and then legs/feet). Doing gestures/drawing poses directly from references will build up your repertoire of poses and is good general practice for drawing full-bodies.   Draw regularly; the only way to improve is to put all of this into practice! I hope that helps ( '_')b"
AnimeSketch,37vgzi,calponpon,1 point,Sun May 31 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"I've definitely been working to draw more lately. It was really difficult to get myself to do it while I was still in college because it felt like I was giving myself more work, but now that I've graduated I've finally been able to just sit back and enjoy it.   I've just been a bit worried because there were times where I drew some impressively wavy lines, and I don't know why, but I just can't seem to draw the kinds of curves I want to make.  something between the paper to tablet transition has been getting in my way and it's quite frustrating.   I've got a decent understanding of how to draw heads in decent proportions, sometimes it's just a failure of execution, but drawing bodies in any kind of perspective has been a struggle, especially when I try to figure it out in my head as opposed to references. I've been trying to avoid using references as much as possible since it tends to proc one of my lazy habits (and google images has been refusing to load thanks to this terrible internet I have.)  Thanks for the advice though, I'll take your words into consideration on my next attempt."

It may seem silly, but it's quite helpful to draw the body nude, then with underwear, and then put the clothes on over that.   if you familiarize yourself with how clothes drape over the body, you can produce some very real results."

AnimeSketch,37mv1c,Naluc,1 point,Thu May 28 21:39:16 2015 UTC,"A common proportional check for a character's overall height that you'll see in a lot of books on drawing is the "" 8 heads tall"" method.  If you divide up from a little above the top of the forehead to the bottom of the chin, it should line up something similar to this:  1st Head: The head, obviously.  2nd Head: The neck and chest, ends either close or on the nipple.  3rd Head: Lower rib cage and the top of the abdomen  4th Head: lower abdomen and the top of the hips.  The belly button starts somewhere around the top of it. The crotch is very close to the end of it, bleeds a little ways into the 5th head.  5th head: This is where the hands are if they're resting at the character's sides, and the upper thigh.  6th Head: lower part of the upper thigh and the bottom part has the knees, or ends at the knees.  7th head: the shin.  8th head: ankles & feet.   Obviously this is a bit harder to use when you're trying to make dynamic poses, but for a standard  Standing/resting pose, this is usually a  pretty good guide. obviously, not all characters are this height, and younger characters will be less heads tall.  Yours fall around the range of about 8 and a half to 9 heads, from my rough measurements, thus giving them the feeling of being a bit long. If what I've mentioned here isn't really clicking, try looking up the concept somewhere online, I'm sure there's probably somewhere that describes this."

AnimeSketch,37mv1c,calponpon,1 point,Fri May 29 14:36:29 2015 UTC,"Welcome back to the world of drawing! :D I'd say you're well on your way. Don't rush yourself to get back to the pen and ink, just sketch if that's what makes you happy. One of the biggest things a lot of us tend to forget is to draw for yourself because YOU want to and YOU like it, then share it if you choose. Don't stress out about making it great for everyone else. If you keep drawing and doing what you love, you'll get better at it. And, regardless of the pacing, you won't get so frustrated ""not seeing improvement.""  Anyway, I'd say you're off to a nice start! If you'd like more guidance to practice with without something to influence your designs, maybe check out things like Posemaniacs! :) They're just 3D models in poses you can rotate and have some muscle overlays, but it can really help when you're learning. Also, gesture drawing is one thing I wish I had learned to do. Now I'm too stuck in my ways so it's hard to learn, but that seems to reaallly help the flow.  I look forward to seeing more in the future! _^ Have fun!"

And from one course on art, lol.  Again, personally, I practice from real people to learn anatomical proportions and structures. I just practice the head, face, and hair mostly from anime/manga because they're quite distorted from real life and I don't think I'd gain too much from learning actual head anatomy (unless I wanted to draw semi-realistic anime).

AnimeSketch,37hf2b,iamnotfurniture,2,Wed May 27 20:10:53 2015 UTC,"I began from copying. I would draw lots and lots of pictures of my favourite characters. And I learnt how to paint that way too.   Then after some time(years), I developed my own style. And it was after which that I learnt that drawing from life is actually the best way to start learning so I drew a lot of portraits, gesture drawings, still life etc. Key is to actually just start and head in the direction you want. Tutorials are everywheeereeee."
AnimeSketch,37hf2b,DaymanMaster0fKarate,2,Wed May 27 20:34:12 2015 UTC,"I am currently learning how to draw realistically as well as in other styles. I'm finding more and more that the best way is to learn how to draw it realistically first, and then in a cartoony style.  As for learning anime in particular, I just study a lot of anime pictures and try to find out what they do to exaggerate their characters while still making them look appealing. Eyes are especially hard for me: how big, where to place them, how to do the eyelids/brows, how to make them appear 3d and not just pasted onto the head (that shit's surprisingly hard, and I think it's tied in with the eyelids a lot...)  I think learning to draw realistically first is a viable method, I went from drawing like this to like this in about two months, which isn't amazing but is at least steady progress. Please let me know if you would like resources on drawing realistically, Proko's youtube channel is especially good.  It takes time and patience and improvement is often slow, but I think it's worth it!"

Absolutely, really glad to see someone saying this. Cartoony styles are exaggerations of normal proportions. If you don't learn standard proportions and anatomy you won't know what to exaggerate to achieve a certain look, you're just copy / pasting chunks without understanding why you're putting things in those places. This leads to the endless sea of strangely detailed yet anatomically borked drawings you can find on DA."

Doing a light rough sketch to help you position things is also a great way to start and.you are.not.sure where you going.to want things.  You still did.a real good job for your first try.

Bad news is that it took me 11 hours (in total) to finish this work, but I'll improve and I'll get faster. Critique is very welcome."

Only other thing I would say is that an offsetting or balancing element within the ocean area might be good on one of the third's vertices.

AnimeSketch,37a6pb,koopabowser21,4,Tue May 26 03:00:03 2015 UTC,I just kinda do what I think looks cool I guess. Gesture drawing should make you better at poses: http://artists.pixelovely.com/practice-tools/figure-drawing/
AnimeSketch,37a6pb,DaymanMaster0fKarate,3,Tue May 26 05:02:49 2015 UTC,"Usually I focus on the pose first. If I want the character to be sitting or standing. Which direction should they be facing, what angle am I drawing them from and what are they reacting too. Drawing the character reacting to something with their posture rather than their expression is one of my favourite ways to come up with something to draw"
AnimeSketch,37a6pb,cats-on-mars,4,Wed May 27 02:53:34 2015 UTC,"I think about what scenes it would be logical for a character to appear in. If you create a character and get to know their personalities, attributes, relationships, and other traits, it becomes that much easier to think about how to draw them. I made an easygoing spear-fighter guy. Automatically you know you can draw him with a spear or lazing around. Get to know your characters and the world they live in and the scenes will start to create themselves in your head."
AnimeSketch,37a6pb,MrJHound,2,Tue May 26 04:26:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm everyone probably has their own methods but one thing that I find really helpful is jotting down ideas that come to mind, not even when you're necessarily brainstorming but just like things pulled from an interesting conversation or a show you're watching, people-watching etc.  It's just a nice habit to form so you'll have a convenient list of cool ideas whenever you feel stuck."
AnimeSketch,37a6pb,orio94,1 point,Tue May 26 09:47:52 2015 UTC,"If I'm completely stuck, I'll find something specific I need to improve on (a particular type of pose/clothing/colouring etc.) and just practice drawing something to do with that."

AnimeSketch,377v44,DaymanMaster0fKarate,2,Mon May 25 16:28:12 2015 UTC,"Inking is different from pencil sketching in that layering many short lines over each other or connecting a line midway through doesn't give the same leeway as it would with a pencil sketch.  With inking you have to keep the line smooth and not break it midway through, this keeps it consistent and less sketchy looking. It looks like you did a pretty good job of this near the top of the head.  Also this is slightly off topic but with inking you're working with a more precise tip, take advantage of it! Don't be scared to connect lines instead of leaving them open, and for the eyes since it is a more densely inked area I'd use a bigger brush tip (like a sharpie) to shade them instead of the small nib on the inking pen. It will also make your nib/ink last longer if you do it this way and it will look much smoother."

I've seen impressive digital paintings from tablets before but not this style, this looks very clean and not what I would've thought would be easy to produce on an iPad even with a stylus.

Anyway, in terms of improving, the first few things I can see are;   his right eye seems a little too high beard is a little too patchy (maybe draw the outline around where it beings on the face?) The nose's shading isn't really in style if that makes sense - the thick black ""the dark-bit-is-here"" is common in a more anime-y style, but here it looks kinda out of place. Maybe if you added that kind of shading on the rest of the face it would look more coherent.   I'll do a little sketch over yours (in red) tomorrow to show you what I mean!  One final thing - just wanted to add that the hat in this is gorgeous. Those creases, man. Hot damn."

I'll always remember him... //sheds a single tear  Anyway, you should check out his website SoggyCardboard because why am I even saying this, everyone should know about the famous webcomic SoggyCardboard!   Also, shameless plug for my own art blog if you liked this week's comic's art! Of course, don't expect anything remotely similar to the comic's art style because my style is so inconsistent my blog might as well be run by 20 different people.   Is this comment long and ramble-y enough yet? Will /u/cuddlep00p be proud of me? Stay tuned for next week's episode!"

AnimeSketch,36tqox,Aeirsus,5,Fri May 22 01:24:29 2015 UTC,"Tried shading for fun but I was too lazy lol. I changed the lineart slightly so that I could shade easier   Color choice wise, I think your shadows are too saturated, especially for the hair behind her neck. In real life, neglecting the effects of reflected light, shadows can never get more saturated than the midtone (base color in this case I guess). Color pick your hair colors again and you'll see that the shadow color moves down to black (drop in value), but also moves right (increase in saturation). Just by this, your coloring is going to look a unnatural.  As for brushstrokes, there's no way to improve except to shade more so that you can display the forms accurately. Of course, using references will help you greatly especially for clothing folds.  However, how you brush depends on what forms you see. That is to say, if you can interpret the shapes you're seeing, then the better you can shade it and vice-versa. By looking at her nose bridge/nose, I can tell you know that there's a shape there, but you don't know the exact form, so the shading is really vague and soft. Same goes for the mouth. From the way you've drawn it, you probably know there's form to it, but I think you'll have some trouble trying to shade the lips.  Anatomy wise, the angle of her mouth doesn't match the face, so I changed that. Worked on the eyes a little because her left eye was too close to the center. I changed the curve on her left eye to match the contour of the face as well. Also, I didn't notice until I shaded the hair, but the top part of her skull was too missing. Our face has can be split up into perfect thirds and I applied the proportion to her face and fixed it by bumping up the hair and raising the hairline."
AnimeSketch,36tqox,CruzSchiffer,3,Fri May 22 10:12:43 2015 UTC,"By the gods, thanks Cruz! I've always known that my coloring feels very strong/conflicting/saturated, but I never really did know how to tone it down. I initially learned shading as just rotating the color wheel a bit and then moving to the lower-right (add shade plus saturation). I guess that makes the overall illustration more dramatic albeit less natural, but sometimes I just want that softer shadow ;-;  And yes, my shading brushstrokes are pretty haphazardly applied. Extrapolating from shapes to forms is probably the one thing I'll need to focus on to figure out shadow placement.   As for the anatomy bit, I can agree with most of your critiques. I never paid attention to curve-of-eye to curve-of-face, so that's news to me. Not really sure about the mouth angle; I guess I just can't see it right now. Also for the skull, I make it a point to outline the skull and draw the hair with a decent enough volume. Maybe it's just that the skull I drew is too small. I just make it look ""okay"" and go with it. Here's my sketch for ref.  Anyway, thanks again for the critique."
AnimeSketch,36tqox,CruzSchiffer,1 point,Fri May 22 17:00:16 2015 UTC,"I did a comparison and it seems like the shape of the hair tricked me!  I think I know what color scheme you're going for. Anime illustrations tend to have vibrant colors and when you color pick the drawing, the ""shadows"" seem to be more saturated.   This is my current understanding of lighting and color.    Highlights - Area directly lit by light source, hence bright and washed out Mid-tones - Well lit areas, but not in direct light, so brightness is relatively similar but saturation is not washed out. Shadows - Less light reaches here. True color just gets darker,   You can see how the respective colors will usually move on a color wheel. This is just my conjecture, but most of the time, anime artists will use the highlight color as the base color (not to be confused with mid-tones), and the ""shadows"" they shade are actually mid-tones! That's why the saturation increases, because the colors are going from highlight -> midtone. You'll see a lot of anime artists use that distinct bright honey yellow for the skin as base color for this reason. But because mid-tones are still relatively light, the decrease in value mustn't be too dramatic or it'll look unnatural because the value determines whether the color is a mid-tone or shadow.  Take a look at this drawing and you'll see my my point"

AnimeSketch,36pq42,nrcallender,2,Thu May 21 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"You're on the right track! That's pretty much how I started anyway. I just kept on drawing and sketching, until I finally got my tablet and said ""screw paper. I could use CTRL+Z here and there's a thing called the magic eraser.""  Everyone else in the comments already stole my answer :( (looking up tutorials, anatomies, observe pretty much everything, lots and lots of drawing), but my biggest enemy is lack of self confidence, and I think a lot of people suffer from this too.   That's why my suggestion is, if you ever feel down, you should make an art summary so you can look back on your art, let's say, the month before and say ""wow, I've improved and I'm awesome."" Keep the drawing spirit alive."

It's just a matter of drawing from reference enough times until you can memorise it.   However, the thing you need to do in order to memorise it effectively is to find patterns in what you're drawing (e.g. the general shape of petals, the number of layers of petals in a typical rose, the number of petals that can typically circle a rose, the size of the petals in relation to the middle bit of the flower). There are probably a number of tutorials that will break this down for you. Studying things is boring, but it's the most effective way to learn. I hope that helps ( '_')b"

AnimeSketch,36b4f0,Taro_Naza,3,Sun May 17 22:59:59 2015 UTC,"Well, each technique has its own benefits and drawbacks.  With 2D, the traditional way is to draw all the frames with transitions and to make the characters believable in that way. It's a strong method that many people are used to that has a very specific charm, Obviously, however, the process is time-consuming and frames cannot often be reused.   With 3D, you need to rig models of characters so that they can move properly in the ways you tell them to, as well as light, set up cameras, and then composite the animations over their chosen background. Theoretically this is time-saving as you should only need to create the model once (maybe a few more times if there's variations or major physical development) and then send it through the animations required for the episode, as opposed to always having the redraw the character every frame. The problem with 3D is that the animation can take a lot more time as you have to make sure you aren't breaking the model's limitations, and getting a 3D model to animate in a way that's lifelike is, IMO, harder than it is in 2D. Add in dynamic lighting and other common factors and you'll end up with a larger render time than a pure 2D animation as well, since the computer needs to make more calculations to produce the animation.   That said, depending on the complexity of the production, it's likely that 3D is faster as far as getting the animation done, since you can skip a lot of the initial preparation needed.   Just figured I'd throw in my two cents."
AnimeSketch,36b4f0,Naluc,1 point,Mon May 18 02:06:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I thought so, at least the show I'm watching now ""Knights of sidonia"" the animation looks clumsy so I'll go ahead and assume that the animations was easier then 2D characters, I think it was a bad choice"
AnimeSketch,36b4f0,Nuciferyne,1 point,Mon May 18 09:33:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with what Naluc said, but one other thing to take into account is sometimes it's good to be able to mix, if you can get the 3D to blend with the 2D best. One example is if you had an entire group doing a dance routine, it would be much easier to have rigged models do the motions than to draw each character doing the same motions. It's also easier in panning shots where the camera rotates around the character. I still prefer to use 2D but that's just a couple of ideas where I could see 3D as having a benefit and possibly being easier.  It also depends on how familiar you are with 3D programs. As I am a newb, it would take way too much time and effort, I'd long since have drawn it out. lol"

For the shading the boobs should be shaded a little more so the shadow is convex, almost like a ball, but not quite.  You have a pretty distinct light source, although her stomach could use a bit more shading, and her waist/hip that shows on the other side of the arm should have a shadow from her arm. For her face, her nose could use a bit of shadow as well. This is really good though! This is just what I see, I'm still learning too. Sorry if I came off a little harsh as well. I suggest looking at some references or tutorials, deviant art has a lot of them, and they've really helped me."

AnimeSketch,35z61u,LimbohBimboh,7,Thu May 14 19:06:50 2015 UTC,"Golem and background looking good, but I think the perspective on the summoner is off.   Reference image for finding perspective:   I first scale the summoner to the golem as if she's standing right next to his foot. Since she's flying, I'll elevate her a little bit above the ground she was standing on. Her size doesn't change because the perspective is invariant for vertical movement (this drawing is not a 3 point perspective). Now I choose a vanishing point on the horizon (eye level) to match the depth of your original drawing, where she's really close up to us. Perspective will always be correct as long as the vanishing point lies on the eye level. If the VP shifts left or right, the summoner won't be as close to us. You can visualize how this works by imagining many summoners in a circle surrounding the golem. Using the vanishing point and elevated summoner, I scale the height accordingly to how it would like at the same depth. This is how she would have looked like   But of course, the position is bad composition wise, so you'll want something like this. I blurred her a little since she's no longer that near to us anymore."

You can start by looking up anime semi-realism, which seems to be what you're actually trying to do.   The eyes are too far apart, if you look at someone's face, the gap between the eyes is usually the same width as that person's eye. The eyes are also a bit small. The nose lacks detail - you should consider shading the nose bridge a bit. Her nose and mouth are a bit low on her face.   Note that semi-realism is NOT my field at all, but I tried edit your drawing a bit to show what I meant: http://i.imgur.com/VdduO4g.jpg  So yeah, just work a little on the face and you're golden! :)"

As for the coloring, there's nothing ""wrong with it"", but you might consider trying to color in a more consistent style: I can see that you put a lot of effort on shading her face. but the soft shading on her skin contrasts the other parts a bit too much since the face is the only part that isn't cel-shaded.

The only real critique I would offer is, be mindful of the anatomy you're symbolizing; the nose appears off center (it should emerge from the center line of the face, which due to perspective means the tip should appear further to the right) and the perspective also looks like it may be off on the mouth.   Overall though, great job!"

AnimeSketch,35s4px,Enigmaboob,1 point,Wed May 13 15:12:40 2015 UTC,Did you sketch or layout the picture with pencil beforehand or did you go straight to pen?
AnimeSketch,35s4px,pyromartian,2,Thu May 14 00:41:34 2015 UTC,Straight pen with no pencil. This is the fourth time I've drawn on a mat and on the first one I tried to use pencil and it turned out ugly when it was drawn over with pen.  In the later ones I just used pen striaght and tried not to do anything extravagant that could result in a lot of errors.

AnimeSketch,35t4ou,soleil666,3,Wed May 13 07:57:49 2015 UTC,"Is this done in illustrator? It's really clean.  Anyways, some basic criticism from someone who's not particularly good at drawing:   It's kind of messy below the shoulders, hard to tell what's what. Part of that may be just because it's not colored since fancy outfits can be hard to convey effectively if the image is purely black and white. Eyes are not placed at the same height. Eyebrows are too thick in my opinion but definitely not something that needs to be fixed if you like it that way. Nose looks a little weird. It seems a bit more natural for the nose to go in the other direction based on your mouth shape. Hair/forehead area is too small, it should be about half an eye's height taller than that, maybe even more depending on the style. Her head seems too flat right now. Mouth is too slanted, would probably look nicer if you cut off that vertical part on the right. If the thing sticking up from the bottom slightly right of center is supposed to be an arm in a long sleeve, the arm/hand is way too skinny and small. (if you look at it relatively, it's smaller than her eyes).   Here's a super quick touchup just to give you an idea of what I'm talking about:  http://i.imgur.com/YC02jEr.png  Overall though really not bad at all for a first sketch, especially if you weren't tracing  over an image (which this doesn't appear to be). Just work a bit on positioning facial features and proportions of body parts and you should be fine :) I personally would have done the eyes a bit smaller too but in an anime style eyes are honestly all up to personal preference."
AnimeSketch,35t4ou,-Saki,1 point,Thu May 14 04:34:06 2015 UTC,"thanks for your advice, I did it on Sai paint tool (using a mouse) without tracing over an image.  i tried to do another one, but i'm not sure if its bette.

AnimeSketch,35t4ou,-Saki,2,Fri May 15 04:04:47 2015 UTC,"This one's a lot better I think. I'm not so good at drawing or critiquing faces at an angle so I can't give much advice here. I think the face shape is a little off, maybe a bot too much cheek on the right. The mouth seems slightly off as well, I think it should be a bit more right and slighly lower. Overall pretty solid work though!"

AnimeSketch,35qzdx,Manganimus,4,Tue May 12 20:03:33 2015 UTC,"You are gonna have many years of painful struggle. I recommend you to go back to pencil drawing until you are good with the basics.  You will be only wasting valuable time when you try to draw in digital before achieving a good control over your pencil drawings. I know this is not the answer you wanted to hear, but that's what I tell every newcomer.   Even Cintiq won't help you if you ignore the basics."
AnimeSketch,35qzdx,lanzegames,2,Tue May 12 21:13:37 2015 UTC,"Listen to this OP. I have heard the same thing from many other experienced artists. Gain a good enough understanding with basics and non-digital tools and then apply it to digital. I was going to dabble more often in digital myself, but I've since learned that getting a decent grasp of a normal pencil and paper drawing helps you improve much more than trying to doodle away on a tablet. It's also two very different mediums.: sometimes mistakes on paper help you think in different ways than if you mess up on digital."
AnimeSketch,35qzdx,Enigmaboob,2,Tue May 12 21:32:33 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of people have said, practice; no one has become amazing with a tablet in 6 months. Something that will help you develop a muscle memory for using a tablet (besides drawing every single day) would be to start off every session with some loose sketching (whether it be gesture drawings or quick sketches). Good luck!  Edit: I don't know how many people would agree/disagree with this, but I don't think it's necessary to become skillful with traditional before digital IF you plan to only draw digitally in the future. You can still learn all of the fundamentals (anatomy/proportions/perspective/colours/lighting) whether it's digital or traditional; the theory applies 99% the same to both. The only thing you'd miss out on by neglecting traditional would be learning to physically mix colours, having to be conservative with making mistakes (no ctrl+z IRL), and the texture/feel of drawing on paper (none of which are necessary for digital). Chances are I'm wrong about a lot of this (feel free to correct me), but that's my opinion on the matter."
AnimeSketch,35qzdx,calponpon,2,Wed May 13 02:06:19 2015 UTC,"Your second paragraph is very true. You can learn fundamentals on both just as easy. Most find it easier to learn them traditionally because it's 1 to 1. The thing is no matter how good you are on paper you will suck with a tablet due to the unfamiliarity. It all comes down to practice with your medium. When it comes down to sketching, gesture, and just line work in general I find these easier to learn traditionally. Making the right mark first try will almost always go to traditional. I think this is why people recommend learning fundamentals traditionally. This allows more time and effort to be spent drawing accurately. I had very little traditional art experience before I started digital and I think my progress is alright. Even though I did a crazy amount of traditional anatomy studies once I got past the beginner stages."
AnimeSketch,35qzdx,sixilli,2,Wed May 13 07:34:40 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day it all comes down to familiarity, I feel. It might be different for this generation, but back in my day we took all our notes with pencil and paper, and we did a heck of a lot of handwriting. This essentially means that when drawing on pen and paper it was almost second nature, and you could focus on what you wanted to put down on the paper, rather than worrying about how you would put it down on paper. Practicing the basic concepts of drawing is much simpler when you can focus on them 100% and don't become frustrated with your tools. I think this is the biggest issue with making the transition from physical media to digital - it's familiarizing yourself with the tablet to the point that you're no longer having to think about which brush to use, where your cursor is on the screen with relation to your hand. That you've trained how to draw looking away from your hand and developed hand-eye coordination to the point that it becomes as second nature to you as writing with pen and paper. This takes years of practice. Until you get to that point, practicing the basics on a medium you're unfamiliar in is just too frustrating.  It's why I've gone back to pencil and paper to practice perspective recently."
AnimeSketch,35qzdx,AllisZero,1 point,Wed May 13 15:03:02 2015 UTC,"Mhm, I still take all my notes by hand, but (aside from copying pictures as a beginner on paper) I started learning to draw with a small tablet right off the bat; so yeah, I guess it really does come down to what is more comfortable."
AnimeSketch,35qzdx,calponpon,1 point,Wed May 13 17:16:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm, if i remember a couple years ago I had the same problem. If there's one thing I've learned though, it is that drawing looking down at your paper and drawing looking at a screen have two different approaches. Unless if you have a cintiq, tablet drawing requires alot of practice to get used to."
AnimeSketch,35qzdx,advarcher,1 point,Tue May 12 20:36:15 2015 UTC,"It's a little odd, but I've taken to switching to a pen nib that has the spring in it, and taping a square of drawing paper over the pressure pad on my tablet. Sometimes, I'll prop the pad up at a slight angle, as if it were on a art table slope. It helps capture a bit of the feel of idle doodling on paper for me, and the paper doesn't ruin the pressure sensitivity at all, really.  Getting over the disconnect; drawing down while looking at your monitor to see the lines, how on paper i work with the whole image at once, on tablet little sections at a time...that was the hardest part for me. I still have issues with that."
AnimeSketch,35qzdx,ArtificiallyIsolated,1 point,Tue May 12 22:33:12 2015 UTC,"you can do what I did when mine was working, tape a piece of paper over it!  practice makes perfect!  I strongly suggest taking lanzegames advice and just make sure to draw everyday~"
AnimeSketch,35qlo7,SouperBased,2,Tue May 12 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"I recommend you to draw with a 4B pencil on a paper of decent quality. (no copy papers) You have to train the basics first, drawing on PC is harder than doing it on paper.  And you will struggle to put realistic shadows on your character when it is not drawn (semi-) realistic. So the best tip I can give you is waiting with coloring or shading, and going to the basics. Because you can't run if you can't walk.  If you are not offended by my comment (I hope you are not), and have more questions regarding anything, I'm here.  A sample of my work"
AnimeSketch,35qlo7,lanzegames,1 point,Tue May 12 19:52:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not offended, just got a little reality check, I guess. I've been drawing and doodling traditionally on paper for quite a while on medium tooth paper, some pens, and a mechanical pencil; but I guess I wasn't able to translate good old-fashioned, tactile control of a physical medium on to a computer.  Do you have any recommended resources before I hit Google up? I'll start on anatomy and perspective searches first, unless there is somewhere else you recommend based on what you see. (You didn't really clarify on where the ""basics"" began.)  Thanks!"

I have been drawing digitally for 10 years, and the graphic tablet is still nowhere as welcoming as a sheet of paper.   Drawing on the tablet requires a lot of force, accurate placment of the tablet, right adjustment of the height of your chair. I have a slightly bent middle finger because I have practiced too much on the graphic tablet."
AnimeSketch,35qlo7,lanzegames,2,Tue May 12 23:14:55 2015 UTC,"Basics are the most important things. It includes the thorough understanding of perspectives, distances, golden proportion and human anatomy.  Where 'basics begin'... It's really hard to say."

Also try and check out as many drawing tutorials and how-to's you can find, and while you're at it, hoard as many pictures as you can from your favorite artists, shows and styles as inspiration material :)"

The left hand has some tricks to convince me it's a hand, but it's just not quite right.  The right hand however.. the foreshortening is definitely off and could use some work.  Had I drawn this I would be pretty happy, but looking at it more objectively allows me to see the flaws.

AnimeSketch,3577h7,mamushi72sai,2,Fri May 8 00:57:52 2015 UTC,"I usually base my opinion of anime/manga art on 2 things.   Does it look convincingly like it was made by a Japanese artist or is it mistakable for having been drawn by a Japanese artist. shading, colors, anatomy ETC   I think you passed on 1. but 2 might need a little more work. Try to make the transitions between colors better. It's a little too obvious in the hair. the arm on our left looks a little too small where it connects to the elbow and the legs look like tubes.  those last 2 things could be fine if they were intentional. look at anime like lucky star for example.   Overall I would give it a 7/10.  Better than most but not perfect. Keep it up."

AnimeSketch,3577h7,Miyuki-tan,2,Sun May 10 02:41:23 2015 UTC,"Heya! My 2 cents is that there could be more use of lighting to add more depth. Like, I can see it nicely in her torso area, but it kinda just stops at her right arm and isn't quite used much in the skirt and legs, giving it that papery/flat feel. Or like another example, the shadows from the skirts on her legs could be rounder instead of straight lines.  Way to go though she's cute~"

AnimeSketch,356qrc,LimbohBimboh,0,Thu May 7 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"If you want to be able to fill in a sketch with flat colour like in those examples, you will need a program that uses layers.  With such a program, you would have 2 layers. The layer on top would be your lineart/sketch. The layer beneath would be your colour. However, to do this, you would first need to erase the white of the paper so that the colour can show underneath the sketch/lineart. There are many ways to do this and can be easily googled. It will probably be easier to remove the white if you use a scanner or have a very clear picture.  Another way you could try (I'm not sure if it will work) which doesn't require you to erase anything beforehand would be to place the sketch/lineart layer underneath your colour layer. Set the colour layer to layer mode: multiply and colour it that way."

I would say a simple way to start is by googling different pictures of anime eyes and drawing them from reference and then without references once you get the general idea. After that i suggest learning emotions by trying to draw different types of faces as well as different emotions. Once you got that down you should start drawing full body with references or create your own works. Over time if you practice, your skill in drawing will start to refine itself."

AnimeSketch,34xwxb,MysticBlackmoon,1 point,Tue May 5 14:01:21 2015 UTC,"I have a critiques regarding a few of your elbows and shoulders.  For a few of them, the elbows and shoulders look 'extended' and 'far out'. It's making your shoulders look 'glued on' separately from the chest/torso rather than being one continuous musculature. The elbows look rounded and also look extended. When the arm is straight, you draw them fine but when they are folded, the rounded joints are making the arms look extra long.  An example of this is your drawing 22. The shoulder looks loose here. In 19, Nico's arms look really long."

AnimeSketch,34xirs,Deathstr1ke,2,Tue May 5 11:36:10 2015 UTC,"Looking good, think maybe you should try adding some color to the shadows, it looks too black. Also, with that style you should be careful with adding too much detail in some spots."
AnimeSketch,34xpni,emptyemptyempty0,1 point,Tue May 5 12:54:01 2015 UTC,"Although the two eyes are mirrored, they won't look the same because the plane of the face is not completely flat but a bit rounded. This means the eye further away may be hidden by the bridge nose and brow. Furthermore, the eye lids should look different -- the closer eye will resemble something like frontal view but the one that's further away will be more angled away from us. The iris and pupil will also be different sizes to accommodate seeing the the left and right eyes at different angles respectively."
AnimeSketch,34xpni,Elleran,2,Tue May 5 21:52:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, yeah, it really is the far eye that I have a lot of trouble with. I don't know what it's called, but it mainly the shape of the far eye that I have trouble with, especially with the varying thickness of the border. The other thing is the placement of the eye. Damn, I'm been trying this for several weeks now and I don't seem to be getting any better :/"
AnimeSketch,34xpni,calponpon,1 point,Tue May 5 22:38:19 2015 UTC,An easy way to do this would be to study how other artists draw their eyes and copy it
AnimeSketch,34xpni,Roughknite,1 point,Wed May 6 03:02:19 2015 UTC,This won't show you where they fit on the skull though. You need to learn where they fit on the skull using guidelines or help of some kind. Knowing how this works lets you draw eyes no matter what position the head is in.
AnimeSketch,34xpni,calponpon,2,Thu May 7 15:49:16 2015 UTC,"You're right, I should've been more clear. By study I didn't simply mean copying other artists line-for-line. What I meant was it would help to grab a bunch of anime-styled artworks OP likes and look for patterns in how they place the features, preferably at different angles (this may include drawing guidelines over the existing images to better visualize it).   Yes, knowing how the facial features are placed in realism is certainly fundamental, but looking at how successful anime/manga artists stylise this would also help in learning how to shift to the anime style."

AnimeSketch,34vkz3,Tomly,2,Mon May 4 22:38:52 2015 UTC,I want to do this but I'm not quite sure how to scan my drawings...  Can you put a sketchbook in a scanner without the lid being closed all the way? How bad does it look?
AnimeSketch,34vkz3,R3D24,5,Tue May 5 01:12:17 2015 UTC,You absolutely can so long as no light can get between the page and the scanner. The quality of the scan is pretty dependent on the quality of the equipment though.
AnimeSketch,34vkz3,ScowlingOwl,2,Tue May 5 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"Hello! As the other user already mentioned, that is possible. Many of the other traditional artists just use a phone to take a picture and upload it online, so that's an option too :)"
AnimeSketch,34u8t0,LimbohBimboh,2,Mon May 4 16:39:07 2015 UTC,Only thing I noticed was her right hand. It looks like that's her thumb? In which case she has two left hands.
AnimeSketch,34u8t0,DJstagen,1 point,Mon May 4 18:10:54 2015 UTC,It's supposed to be her pinky. Does it really look like a thumb?
AnimeSketch,34u8t0,DJstagen,2,Mon May 4 18:57:02 2015 UTC,Sorta?  I thought that because the design on that glove was different from the one on her other hand. It's probably just my eyes messing with me.   I do love the shading style you used. Looks great.

AnimeSketch,34p98m,Max3391,1 point,Mon May 4 02:18:26 2015 UTC,"No worries! I had this problem for a while, too. Just practice making legs a few inches longer than you think it should be, and in time, the proportions will come naturally. Also, if I may, the pose may be slightly off from what you intended. It seems that the top half of the body is for a standing pose, but the legs are in motion. For the future, try to consider what leg poses are most natural when in a stationary position. Best of luck!"

Disclaimer: I'm part colorblind, so I might not be the best help. But I still understand staturation and whatnot.   Your blue is crazy blue. I'd tone it down, desaturate it and make it more grey and lighter.   Don't be afraid to make the color of the shadows a little stronger too. It just seems like your model is a little too low contrast to be appealing.   And I'd say feel free to put fancy shapes and shit in the background. It's a good piece of work!"

AnimeSketch,349l61,Thehoodedteddy13,2,Wed Apr 29 11:48:07 2015 UTC,"Shading is always a representation of light and where it hits an object. Since the character is glowing, you need to figure out which areas of the form will be hit by light, and which areas will not - that's where you would put your shadows. Granted, when something is glowing all around, you're not going to get many areas that aren't hit by light in one way or another, in which case you would mostly be doing hightlights and illustrating where the light hits directly and showing that more prominently."

AnimeSketch,349l61,pyromartian,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:51:57 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, there was an episode in the anime that had one of the characters powering up and they changed the shading to reflect that.   The shadows were minimized but they were made darker and moved to areas that are almost always shaded.  But at the end of the day you have to take artistic license and add shading to model Goku's 3D shape.  Also if there are other light sources add those highlights first and that should help you place shadows.  The episode I'm talking about is in the Buu saga I think, if that helps."

AnimeSketch,346idj,xzakit,3,Tue Apr 28 18:14:33 2015 UTC,"Like /u/pinedem said, proportions would do wonders -- but in particular I would point out hands and feet. You did get torso and appendage lengths pretty well.   I dunno what it is, but even in pretty popular manga I see hand/feet proportions all over the map. So because there's some liberty, the best bet is to proportion first realistically and then exaggerate from there to fit taste. For instance: hands in real life can cover your face, but to make them seem delicate, you shrink them a bit; alternatively, to make them seem tough and imposing, you enlarge them."

AnimeSketch,33v1ax,Kuroonehalf,6,Sun Apr 26 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"I think the example that Fayrenth gave is a good one. Something between the original drawing and the shoulder/neck modification he made might be ideal. Make sure to draw the shoulders by themselves and get them to look good, and then overlay the shoulder plates on top (if you're not doing so already), instead of drawing them straight away which can make them look like they're lacking volume.   Granted, since we can't see her arms it's hard to tell what the neck and shoulders should really look like.  It's nitpicking really but I believe that's what you came here for. :P"

AnimeSketch,33neek,knighthead,12,Thu Apr 23 22:59:21 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/gallery/loNyzkb  Directly linked the image for the post (for the mobile users), but there's a little story attached to the imgur link itself. I'll paste it below:  This is just something that I've been thinking about lately.  On the left is a drawing I did while in high school. It was experimental for me at the time, and I was really proud of the result. I look back at drawings like this one and think, ""How could I have ever thought that was good?"" And I sometimes even cringe about it.  Well as Jake the Dog once said, ""Dude, sucking at something is the first step to being sorta good at something.""  A lot of the people I've met during college were already pretty good when they were in high school-- it's no wonder they had their parents' backing when going to college. I don't know why anyone believed in me, but I worked really hard to become someone who is sorta good at drawing. It's one of the main things I've had a passion for, ever since I was young.  I'm surprised I wasn't put down for my art in high school. In fact, most people I knew really supported me. I'm ashamed to say that I would not have high hopes for the artist on the left. I wouldn't want to say anything, but I can't even see the potential there, maybe a hobbyist at most. Today, I'm the artist on the right. I worry to call myself ""good,"" as I never want to be blinded by that undeserved ego I had in high school.   I feel I've grown a lot, as someone who was never really that good at drawing to begin with. I just really liked it, and I wanted to do it more and more. I met people in high school who were REALLY good at drawing, and I wanted to be as good as them-- better, if possible. Drawing is the one thing I've truly been competitive about in my life. If nothing else, I always want to become a better artist, to always improve. Much like the left drawing, I'm pretty proud of my results on the right. Of course there are things I could do better, but I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to ""my voice,"" and creating artwork that I can truly call ""good.""  I guess all I'm trying to say, is if you see someone who really loves drawing and keeps going at it... don't discourage them. I probably would have given up long ago if I was just told how bad I was. A lot of kids are able to draw like the artist on the left. If they are encouraged, like I was, there's no telling what they are capable of doing.   I wonder how long it will be until I look back on the right drawing and cringe at how bad it is?"
AnimeSketch,33neek,Azalonozul,6,Thu Apr 23 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"I went to an art school, but I'd attribute this by saying ""both,"" I guess? Well I believe nothing really comes ""naturally."" Moreso than being able to take classes (not all of them were so helpful, I believe there were a solid eight or so that I really benefited from however). Having a strict five years of focusing on art and art-related subjects, however, really helps. I spent the five years drawing all the time. I drew in my classes, even my lecture classes, instead of taking notes. I drew when I hung out with my friends. I drew when I went to a Friday Night Magic event. I drew before sleeping, I drew after waking up. Even when I didn't want to draw, I had to draw, because the class assignments were there to keep me drawing. ""I don't want to draw this comic,"" I'd whine. ""Well you have to or you'll fail."" And then I'd be drawing classwork so much that I'd pine for the time I'd get to draw what I wanted. So I'd get faster at drawing classwork so I could draw my own stuff. I had to get faster and faster as I started taking on commissions.   I feel like going to art school is getting that opportunity for four+ years of concentrated time alongside competing students. I feel like I took the saturation for granted, because now that I'm away from school, people I meet in-person compliment my work, rather than tell me why it's bad. I don't know how to take it sometimes, and I look at them like they're crazy. ""How can you not see how skewed the anatomy is, or how the contrast gets completely muddled at a focal point?!""  Turns out that people who don't go to art school aren't encouraged to focus on finding what's wrong in a drawing.  So this turned out longer than it should have, I'm sorry. Basically, I think if you can build a similar environment, which should be really easy with how social networking developed... similar improvement is possible without going to art school. Lots of the amazing artists around today did just that-- networked with other strong artists online and kept themselves running towards improvement alongside their peers. It's all about the time you put in. I had classmates who had very little improvement between years, while others were like me and seemed to learn how to draw over that period. Everyone starts somewhere, and I guarantee you it's almost always at the bottom. There just needs to be that push for improvement every time. Almost every resource and experience I had can be obtained without art school, but I was privileged in being guaranteed most of those interactions simply by being surrounded by other artists. I'm so thankful for that, because I don't know how much I could have focused if I was trying to learn while holding a part-time job or something. I'm trying to do that now and I think I'm seeing improvement, but my focus is so scattered."
AnimeSketch,33neek,StoryOfMyRightHand,2,Fri Apr 24 00:36:24 2015 UTC,Dude...thumbs up for the fast and detailed response!   One thing that has always skewed me away from every touching an art major is the job market. You seem to be either a contract worker or do commission work to even make money off of the talent you have. There is no job guarantee/stability.
AnimeSketch,33neek,SgtMichaels,6,Fri Apr 24 01:01:08 2015 UTC,"You're right, there is no job guarantee. I finished college (or rather it's on hold; I did not go for a degree, however I completed the entirety of my major, and took extra courses in it to make the most of my time in school) and I'm working part-time at an entry-level manual labor job. I hate it and it's very humbling, but I need to do what I can to get by and save to focus on my dreams. My roommate actually has his degree, and we work the same manual labor job. Degrees really mean nothing in the art world. There's job security in some areas, though. If your portfolio is strong enough, landing a gig in the animation or concept art/3d art industries is pretty secure, to an extent. I've heard of company downsizing, but that's where a lot of in-house jobs are for illustrators and the like. For me, I only want to do freelance-- I want to develop a style that can both be used for Magic the Gathering-type work, but also keep the wonder of the anime styles I grew up loving. I'm working on my own comic as well, that I want to self-publish. I don't know if these projects can support me entirely, but if they help a little that's all I need right now. I really just want to create, and I want to get my story out there to as many people who are willing to read it, and at the highest quality I can deliver. And then I want to do the same for the next story, all which I could eventually focus 100% on without having to go in for ten hours a day of non-art labor.   Lots of pro artists will be full-time concept artists working in-house, and be freelance illustrators on the side. It's still such a competitive field, it's all about being the best, fastest, and easiest to work with. The degree doesn't mean anything if you can't live up to and succeed your competition. Right now, I'm just trying to be consistent with my work, and do what I can when I can."
AnimeSketch,33neek,CruzSchiffer,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:15:08 2015 UTC,"You say that you cringe when you look at the drawing on the left, Well, let me tell you. The drawing on the right makes me say,"" Holy shit, are you even human"". Everyone has to start somewhere. And even though you started on the left drawing, where you are now is really great. Congrats on your improvement, dude."
AnimeSketch,33neek,Jataka,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:28:21 2015 UTC,"And that's the point! Thank you, by the way~! But yeah, the drawing on the right is much better than the one on the left, and the one on the left is something I think many MANY people are capable of... and don't go further because they think it's not good enough. But a couple years of dedication and someone who draws like the left can also reach the right drawing-- likely even further!"
AnimeSketch,33neek,CakeIsaVegetable,4,Fri Apr 24 13:44:13 2015 UTC,Very nice improvement. I never got around to coloring or learning how to put screentones on manga pages. I just draw in black and white.  What programs do you use?
AnimeSketch,33neek,mamushi72sai,8,Fri Apr 24 19:00:55 2015 UTC,"I use Photoshop, and in high school I started with Gimp. I don't think color is all that hard to learn, just keep lighting in mind-- I'm colorblind and I can do this much. The stronger your grasp on traditional mediums and your foundations, the better your result will be."

AnimeSketch,33neek,Heartless50,2,Fri Apr 24 11:34:52 2015 UTC,"I drew the one on the left while I was in high school, and the one on the right about five days ago. I wasn't very good in high school, or even at the start of college. Took me until my second year to start to become competent, and my ego deflated as a result."
AnimeSketch,33neek,xTyd,3,Fri Apr 24 11:54:51 2015 UTC,"Really? I feel like the hands and face, while stylized, don't give a specific age, and definitely not ""elementary school."" She looks no younger than any other anime character. @_@ The subject of my drawing, though, is a character who assumes this form, though she is actually an ancient Lovecraftian creature who controls the aspect of magic in my story's universe.  But, who cares about me and my characters. I want people to just care about their own progress, because I'm proof that you don't need ""talent"" to become kinda good at something like drawing. I want more people to realize that and not give up on art because they think they're not good enough."

He drew comics starring a mentally-enthusiastic blonde, a depressed guy of questionable ethnicity, a nymphomaniac scantily-clad alternative girl, and a pretty-much-normal well endowed brown haired girl who somehow gets the most screen-time.  Anyway, he made these comics on a weekly basis. Planning each one out with love.  But one of those weeks he decided he was too fucking tired to be funny in the comments, so he made up a story and put in a .gif of Carmen jumping at the end.  Here's a .gif  Also here's the website that helps me live  I'm gonna headbutt a fucking stapler and try to fall asleep in that order.  I love you all."

I'd also put a slight bend in her arms. I know its not really visible in the refpic, but its there in reality. So  put a sharper angle on that.  add shading to the skirt and shadows every where"

AnimeSketch,3397uh,ToxicRainn,2,Mon Apr 20 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"Nothing to really criticize about the clothing. It looks good with the style that you were going for. The only thing I can really notice (which I wouldn't have noticed if I wasn't intentionally looking for errors), is that his belt/sash thing flows to the right while the rest of the clothes go straight down. Of course, that could be intentional as well, but its the only thing I noticed that was worth mentioning :] Good job!"

Maybe could be fixed by adjusting rolled up sleeve's angle and by showing more elbow. Left hand (implying it's his hand) is supposed to be the other way around. I bet you looked at your own hand when you were drawing it. Next time a mirror might help (at least that's what I'm doing :D) Other than that it looks fine.

AnimeSketch,332tnn,MysticBlackmoon,3,Sat Apr 18 23:59:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, the pose is nice and dynamic, especially with the foreshortening on the blade and his leg. I can only think of a couple things to nitpick at; I'm not 100% sure if the perspective on the gun matches the angle of his arm/wrist (it looks like it's angled directly downwards), and I might be looking at it wrong, but it looks like his forearm (holding the blade) is extremely long. I know in some spots you were going for a dirt/gritty look on the clothes, but I'd just make sure you don't overdo the cross hatching/blotting so that it doesn't end up looking messy. Other than that, it looks great! I'm a big fan of the Souls series but I haven't had the chance to play Bloodbourne yet ;_;"
AnimeSketch,332tnn,calponpon,2,Sun Apr 19 02:32:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I keep running into this damnable problem where I try to do foreshortening, and something in the back of my head keeps saying ""the perspective isn't deep enough! DOUBLE IT!"" And then everything gets all weird and fucked-up looking. I can never quite seem to get the hang of it.  And let me tell you, you don't even know from the messes you can get in Bloodborne. That outfit was gray when I entered that area. It's a delicate balance in art, though, trying to keep the clarity without losing the effect, so I'll keep that in mind for the future. Thanks for the notes!"
AnimeSketch,332tnn,Elleran,3,Sun Apr 19 03:51:32 2015 UTC,"To add to calponpon's C/S, his left foot is not in the correct perspective.It shouldn't be exactly perpendicular from our view, it should be slightly turned toward us if you want it to be more natural."

The eyes could be lower on the head a bit, but that's a personal preference bit. To address the question in your title, it's all about the shading. Much of your picture lacks a lot of contrast at this point, and even drawing in a few small shadows (or just the extreme shadows) will help make certain parts pop out. Give him a shadow where his head joins to the neck, where his high collar goes behind his back, a bit where the ears connect to the head, a bit on the face where his hair hangs down. You don't have to go HAM with it, but it'll make your figure pop."

This sketch is referencing on my old group sketch that I've done... 8 years ago Oh man I'm so old, but the quality is far lower and much more sketchy due to the consideration that I drew this in the office at far quicker pace compared to the old sketch.

AnimeSketch,330dk5,candide1337,1 point,Sat Apr 18 07:25:57 2015 UTC,"Nice composition! There's definitely more movement in your new sketch.  This is just my personal taste but I'd try varying their sizes more... randomly? Right now it's starts at medium torso at the bottom, then large busts in the middle, and smaller heads at the top, which makes it seem too orderly. When I look at movie posters, there seem to be one or two big heads arranged some way and then a bunch of smaller people scattered around."

AnimeSketch,32xud5,LimbohBimboh,5,Fri Apr 17 16:43:06 2015 UTC,"Critique:  I feel like with this work there is a lot of empty space around the character in unequal ways. It's fine and dandy to use empty space, but if you do you're going to make sure to follow the rule of two thirds.  The shadow on the ground does not strictly reflect the shading on the body creating a strange illusion for the eye. When shading art always keep your light source in mind, many artists actually draw their light source in the art and delete it later to help them keep it in mind and plan shadows and light spots in the art.  Don't be afraid to play with bright or high contrast colors, they can give a lot of life to even a basic pose like this, a great example of a place to place bright high contrast colors would be the eyes, these here seem somewhat foggy.  I like the use of blur to force perspective on the tail, but I feel that there should be more blur towards the tip and less towards the base.  If you had any specific points you would like me to touch on I would be happy to do so, but I think these are the things that you should focus on for now. You have a good basic grasp of anatomy and with further practice it will only improve."

You'd be trying to squeeze hopeful originality from a worn and annoying cliche. In any case, this is something for you to design, not us! Since you say they take root in cultural norms though, I guess I would advise looking into hikkikomorism, chuunibyou, social anxiety syndrome, sex addiction, fangirl culture, tomboyism... all sorts of things you can work with.  Good luck making the comic; I don't envy having to introduce ten characters - even Ken Akamatsu (Negima, Love Hina), would need a few dozen pages for that."

The things that need more attention is the base anatomy and the angle of the character himself.  He's tilted more than I believe you wanted him to be. And I can tell from the shading that the knees will be too high. He's sitting straight, so his knees will go outward. Here's what I mean:http://imgur.com/ajYoxdd  Other than that, it's coming along nicely. Hands are difficult for many people, so don't hesitate to look at references.

AnimeSketch,32uiph,Kuudayray,2,Thu Apr 16 20:40:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see a potentially awesome picture in the works.   First and foremost: references. Utilize stock poses.   The arms don't look bad, just stiff. And the arms are at a different degree than the legs and torso, so it looks like her body is slightly twisted at an awkward angle. It may just be the pose. I would give some more variation in the arms (lift the right arm up, make one a bit higher than the other), but that's to you discretion.   (The parallelism seems more to be an incongruity than a purposeful stylistic choice, but if it's the latter, ignore my last sentence. )  If you'd like, I can sketch a layer over it to show you what I mean.

That's to make her seem a little more dainty and cute. If thats not what you're going for, then ignore me."
AnimeSketch,32rsq2,SgtMichaels,2,Thu Apr 16 07:26:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, her arm could be longer for sure. Making the neck longer would mean I'd have to slightly increase her head size among her other proportions, too. Her current shoulders' position makes her look just a tiny bit tension. Sloping them would definitely make her look more relaxed, but a slight tension was what I was going for.  I was trying to go for a cute look, so perhaps I should try experimenting with what you're saying. Perhaps it would look cuter that way.  Thanks!"

By comparison, I've had hand cramp, but never tendonitis, from the tablet PC, which is much more accurate to draw with. Plus the screen angle mimics an architect's desk, so it lends ergonomics to the arms in that respect... in any case, it's no more tiring than what the renaissance artists would have had to put up with!"

AnimeSketch,32ixmu,Shennpai,5,Tue Apr 14 03:56:31 2015 UTC,"Eyes are generally about halfway up the face and are usually 1 eye-width apart from each other. The rest of the facial proportions should be easy enough to find (Loomis is a solid resource). Same with breasts. Study different references if you feel lost.  Regarding the inking, experiment with varying the width of your lines. I hope this helps."
AnimeSketch,32ixmu,calponpon,2,Tue Apr 14 04:24:32 2015 UTC,You should study anatomy and proportion refrences of real people.
AnimeSketch,32ixmu,DaymanMaster0fKarate,2,Tue Apr 14 13:00:28 2015 UTC,"Studying real anatomy really help, so I highly suggest you find anything online to help with that. Here are a few quick things to remember though.  Head: The head is arguably one of the most important parts of the body to learn how to draw well. Why? You can use the head to proportion the rest of the body. If you know how to draw the head, then it will be a lot easier to draw the body. Of course, you should definitely study the complete anatomy of a human body :P   The eyes should be placed halfway up the head. They should also be roughly 1 eye width apart from each other.  The base / bottom of the nose is halfway between the eyes and chin.  The mouth is halfway between the base of the nose and the chin. The ears should be as long as as the distance between the eyes and the base of the nose Don't draw the hair just yet. I notice a lot of new people tend to draw the hair immediately, but it's important to draw where the hairline should begin, especially if you're trying to learn anatomy. I don't really have a specific measuring point for how long the forehead should be, but it should be fairly easy to find a natural size.  Another thing to note is that there are two important bone structures that you may want to look out for. They form the base shape of your head.    The mouth line is also where the jaw line starts. This is where you curve the head in more to get that shape that anime characters have The eyebrow line is where the head slightly expands, which can affect how much hair volume you want to give your character.    I'm by no means an expert, but I have many friends who are amazing artists whom gave me these suggestions. I hope this helps :D"

I really like what you did with her hair and torso.  It looks as if she is jumping back and whipped her hair around in the process.
AnimeSketch,32c9ba,Stockguy38,3,Sun Apr 12 20:20:39 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll fix that.

AnimeSketch,32a3kr,BKRANDY11,7,Sat Apr 11 23:31:34 2015 UTC,"You'd want to start off with SAI first. Once you think you're gonna commit, you can go for Clip Studio Paint."
AnimeSketch,32a3kr,CruzSchiffer,3,Sat Apr 11 23:43:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. SAI doesn't have as many features, but if you're just starting out it's a great program to use. Clip Studio Paint is like a mix between SAI and Photoshop, which means if you want to upgrade you can do so without paying a whole wallet for Photoshop (not to mention that Photoshop is generally laggier)."
AnimeSketch,32a3kr,xKirbee,3,Sun Apr 12 00:36:51 2015 UTC,"Photoshop isn't ""laggier"" it's strictly due to the system running it. Photoshop is a somewhat resource intensive program when compared to Sai.   For the OP it doesn't matter what program you use, but using the right software can ease some headaches. If you want to do a line heavy style you'll want to use a program with a line stabilizer like Sai, Sketchbook Pro or Clip Studio Paint/Manga Studio.   It's also worth noting that Photoshop is the industry standard when it comes to most production art. If you're a hobbyist learn what you want, if you want to go pro learn what you want + photoshop."

I usually just draw on SAI, then edit on Photoshop. Photoshop has a lot more tools though, and you're better off using PS if you wanna do scenery/bg stuff like that. For a beginner I'd definitely stick with SAI, easy to get used to, plus I actually prefer doing linework and coloring on there, feels better somehow."

AnimeSketch,328ar6,Jeroz,2,Sat Apr 11 13:59:38 2015 UTC,"So far so good, I really like this piece.  Try adding more depth and differences in your line weight. It helps make you art really pop when things in foreground really stands out.   I'm one to talk since I'm still working on it but try experimenting with colors and how you color it. Textures, gradients and whatnot.  Try to use reference pics for your poses. You don't have to use all of one ref pic but pick and chose here and there and see what works for you in the end. I see what you were going with it but it still seems a little stiff, you know? Try bending and moving an arm or leg or slightly change the angle for more ideas for the pose. Also, step back and look at your work once in a while to get a better look at it. You might think of something else to add/change.  And in all, pretty good!"

AnimeSketch,323uxx,Slateboard,2,Sat Apr 11 19:38:50 2015 UTC,Did you do this with a ballpoint pen? What would you say is different from a ballpoint from a felt tip pen?
AnimeSketch,323uxx,Shugbug1986,2,Fri Apr 10 13:57:01 2015 UTC,Yeah use a regular bic pen on this piece. As for the differences between the two? Well pen requires so much various pressure to create light to dark and smears easily. It's a good tool to practice control and finesse. Felt tips are more solid in application. If you draw slow and controlled the felt tip usually gives you an equal out put with not much smear. And if the felt tip is alcohol based ink then the outcome will be cleaner as opposed to ink pens. I enjoy both but like to change to experience a different style in both.

Usually as a rule of thumb you meassure a width of 1 1/2 heads for females, +/- a bit depending on body build, so I think they matched it just fine. The only thing I would argue is that the head might be a bit too round, but that might just be a personal preference thing.  I really like how the hair are shaded. One thing I recently noticed is that the eyes can look much more realistic/3d if you add some highlights in the white of the eyes too, but again that's just preference.

A way of seeing your current value level is to add a B/W adjustment layer (on photoshop), and to improve it, you could easily adjust the ""levels"" - like this  edit: removed the saturation a bit to make it more like the original  Hope I helped!"

I think that, while you have a load of skill in painting and drawing, you draw in a 2d way, if that makes sense, so some areas of this piece don't work fully. By visualising in a 3d sense before you start wih some quick sketches, you can improve your work tenfold.  Here's a sketch which I hope shows what I mean - firstly, the body didn't seem to be facing the dircection you wanted it to face, so I changed her pose slighly. As I said, the boobs were sagging, despite the fact they were being held up (maybe you were aiming them to look like the cloth didn't support them, idk) so I've redrawn them closer, and tighter.  Also, the clothes were a little off, with the cloth that goes between the arm and the body, or some of the creasing not making 100% sense. Here's another quick sketch showing how I would have done the clothing :p  As ever, don't take this as any form of rudeness, or coming with any malice, I'm just trying to help you improve :D"

AnimeSketch,31uhj7,TheBandNoelle,5,Wed Apr 8 06:30:03 2015 UTC,"This is looking really good, the line work and shading are beautiful! But, as in almost any art, there are a few steps you can take to improve it!  First things first, her right arm. It seems to be coming from two different perspectives - her shoulder coming straight out, into the front of her fore-arm. This obviously looks odd - so, if we think about this in a 3D sense, it becomes much easier to understand and therefore draw.   Next, your proportions were a little off - the placement of the shoulder, the length of her arms in general, and her body - were all a little ""skewiff"", not too badly just enough for me to notice. To improve this, just study some more anatomy or do some life drawing - I recommend websites such as Quckposes, or Posemaniacs Also, you forgot the ears! Or at least I didn't see them.  Finally, the creases on the shirt seem a little weird, practice drawing more shirsts and other such stuff to try and get a better grip on  Here is a quick sketch over your work to demonstrate my point  Anyway, your stuff is great, the shadowing, line-work and detail are all lovely, it shows you're already a great artist - but as I said, art can always be improved!

AnimeSketch,31q8cf,minzey,2,Tue Apr 7 08:39:27 2015 UTC,Great start. You got your Country Pasta going so that's great.  Obviously it got some issues with the pose. Her arms seems to be bent a bit to much back at the shoulders. It probably hurt a lot if you'd have your sholders bent like that in real life.   I'd recomend doing some Mark Krilley tutorials. I think your drawings would improve a lot of you did some guidelines before drawing to help you with the pose. :)  Here's one on chibi drawing since you complained about not being able to do the head  Hope that helps. :)
AnimeSketch,31q8cf,putemonsteret,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:55:54 2015 UTC,"Contrapposto:       Contrapposto is an Italian term that means counterpose. It is used in the visual arts to describe a human figure standing with most of its weight on one foot so that its shoulders and arms twist off-axis from the hips and legs. This gives the figure a more dynamic, or alternatively relaxed appearance. It can also be used to refer to multiple figures which are in counter-pose (or opposite pose) to one another. It can further encompass the tension as a figure changes from resting on a given leg to walking or running upon it (so-called ponderation). The leg that carries the weight of the body is known as the engaged leg, the relaxed leg is known as the free leg.  Contrapposto is less emphasized than the more sinuous S Curve.    Image i - Kritios Boy. c. 480 BC, was the first known statue to use contrapposto.

I started out with a bit more generic cartoony character and therefore made the motions a bit more exagerated.

AnimeSketch,31ob22,paireza,2,Mon Apr 6 21:33:04 2015 UTC,"Some things that will definitely make or break the work   Really Tight line work, thin and smooth. Might be worth while to convert a sketch to vectors to get the crisp edges. Before you even think about color, get your values straight. This style, like many anime, employs flat areas of value for intense highlights, and some of the deeper shadows, however they are all consistent additionally cast shadows (like her arm onto her shirt in the ref pic) tend to be smoother/gradual instead speaking of color, lots of layers, and overlay blending is going to be your friend. From what I can gather, the subtle color changes in her hair, and clothing are the product of either shadow/highlight overlaid with color, or some subtle color on color overlays. This where those values you got rock solid before come in clothing and hair can be shaded with darker shades of the same color, or a slightly off hue the combination of which, and in what layer order is going to be where you experiment a lot   tl;dr Start with a greyscale, get things clean and tight. Overlay, masking, and a good color set are going to be a must. Vector might be the way to go for the final lines.  Don't get discouraged thought this type of works takes time, both in practicing, and actually making the final piece. I'd take me a good few days to crank something out like that. Most of that time I would be fighting the urge to toss in the towel.  best of luck"
