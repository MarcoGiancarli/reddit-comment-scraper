Also, this requester is well-established and has a respectable turkopticon rating. Not saying you should, but simply stating a case of what I've observed."

This one seemed familiar, but I think it will allow me to accept. I don't want to possibly redo a Turk if it is frowned upon though. It just seems like I would mess up their results. I'm new to this, so I could be wrong. :)"

We got into talking about Mturk and I mentioned how I was impressed I'm only 10 days in and earned $50 so far. Turns out she's been doing it for about a year and was astounded at what I made. So I told her about this sub reddit but she never even heard of reddit!   So I shot her a link to the sub."

HITsWorthTurkingFor,3dvgxc,toastrman,4,Sun Jul 19 21:30:11 2015 UTC,This one makes me a bit nervous because of the threat of rejection if it doesn't meet the specific time frame for completion that they want
HITsWorthTurkingFor,3dvgxc,Strigas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:50:05 2015 UTC,that and the TO...guess we'll see
HITsWorthTurkingFor,3dvgxc,Sabblesbox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:00:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seriously, they only give a vague range of how long it ""should"" take, so if you are a fast reader you have to alt tab between pages and such to drag out the timer, but of course if you take too long they will reject it anyway? Huh? lol   In my experience survey's with these types of messages showing up before them have a tendency to actually mean ""I will only accept the surveys that I feel will help strengthen the conclusion I want my study to have, and I will simply reject and ignore/hard block everyone else if I feel like it""   It always makes me nervous filling them out because 2/3 times I decided to chance the shiesty messages I have gotten a rejection and only got 1 of them changed by calling the college's review board. Ridiculous that it even happens.    Hopefully this one is just a nervous and cautious requester and not a shady one. Good luck heh"
HITsWorthTurkingFor,3dvgxc,Strigas,2,Sun Jul 19 22:03:44 2015 UTC,"Are you aware that they have to pay upfront for everything, so rejecting doesn't actually save them money? It's still stuck in the mturk system."
HITsWorthTurkingFor,3dvgxc,Aksar0,2,Sun Jul 19 22:10:11 2015 UTC,But they do get more work done for the same money
HITsWorthTurkingFor,3dvgxc,Strigas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:30:52 2015 UTC,Yea I am a bit nervous about it as well. I accepted the hit but didn't actually start the survey until about 40 min later. However the survey itself took about 7 to 10 minutes for me. Seems to be more centered around finding out if people think there is discrimination against women.

HITsWorthTurkingFor,3dvgxc,tavileylah,5,Sun Jul 19 21:39:50 2015 UTC,"Ethical issues aside, this is an unhelpful thing to do because many of these surveys, including this one, have multiple versions.

The requester isn't sending out emails when new HITs are posted for qualified turkers.  Therefor, I and some other turkers are trying to keep HWTF up to speed when relevant HITs are posted by this requester because he's paying around $8/hr.  If you can't take any of the HITs, Make note of the name of the requester for the future.  If you see his name in HITscraper, try to get on board with his trials because they pay through the roof.  Hope that clears things up"
