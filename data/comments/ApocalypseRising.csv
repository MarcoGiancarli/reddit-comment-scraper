ApocalypseRising,3e0jup,Krektonik,2,Tue Jul 21 16:04:28 2015 UTC,my point  cars are destroyed randomly  so it might take [time limits above] for the cars to respawn  gg you just proved me right boi
ApocalypseRising,3e0jup,sergiusalceanu,2,Tue Jul 21 17:31:22 2015 UTC,"if i go on a server and box all the cars under the map they won't be destroyed randomly that's for sure  saying cars spawn randomly is like saying corpses spawn randomly, it depends entirely on what the people on the server do"

ApocalypseRising,3e0jup,sergiusalceanu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:54 2015 UTC,exactly it really depends on what the players will do and not what the game is told to do  going back to the first post   they respawn every 30-45 minutes in my experience  you might get lucky and it'll respawn in 15-20  but you're more likely to get unlucky and it'll take an hour or two ;-;   so youre right about players determining vehicle respawn time but there really isn't any info on the average time it takes for a car to respawn and the times are pretty much made up

ApocalypseRising,3dzemb,Gakot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:49 2015 UTC,Not running into players constantly is a good thing. It adds more tension to each fight that Reimagined can't deliver because you run into people every 5 minutes. In Reborn you can expect to not run into people and when you do it is much more stressful.

ApocalypseRising,3dz0vj,Krektonik,6,Mon Jul 20 18:06:41 2015 UTC,"You really sound like me. I've already given Gus enough fuckery about this stuff myself. I'm an elitist architectural/city planning/design piece of shit fuckwad and I obsess over this garbage. It bothers me too. I'd agree with everything you've said, but this is a game, with platform and developer limitations. There are good reasons in place as to why none of this can happen to the extent that you desire. I'll lay them out.  Before I give you the gist of it I'd like to say this:  Gus's areas of expertise don't really include architecture or city planning. I don't mean to insult him. The way Apoc looks now is the style that it's held for years. It's part of Apoc's signature, and Gus is very content with it. The majority people that play Apoc are content with it. The most I can say about that part is: deal with it. There are more important reasons at hand.  Game design.  Your thinking is dictated by nothing but practicality of design and realism. Gus's preference leans heavily towards game design. A line needs to be drawn somewhere. I do believe that Apocalypse Rising needs a more optimized balance between the two, and that it could definitely use some of your suggestions, but not to the scale that you imply. Most of the stuff you're suggesting is far too grand for Apoc's design. I can assure you that Gus knows his shit when it comes to game design, and the importance of that particular aspect of game development whizzed right over your head. Quite a few of the things you're suggesting are in direct contradiction with various fundamentals in Apoc's design. Some of the essential factors to consider include lag, playability and effort.  Practical stairs? Apoc had that in its early days. I mean, no shit ramps look retarded. But part count, poly count―that's lag. Maybe not in a small FPS map, but something the size of Reborn? All those little details and intricate shenanigans, they add up. Even with the chunk system and CSG, they have a huge impact on the game. It's not us, it's ROBLOX. It was made obvious a looooong time ago that a big sacrifice had to be made somewhere. Detail must be limited. This goes for the rest of your shit. Apoc buildings are almost 100% enterable. Almost every room spawns loot. This is a rule. Now imagine every room having loot at near-supertall level. And now, hold on just a fucking minute. ""Big city"", my ass. Man, by real life standards Kin is fucking insignificant. The most it would have is mid-rises, and that's still pushing it. You want realistic scale? Properly-scaled ROBLOX skyscrapers have at minimum 250x250 stud base dimensions. A proper mountain would take up more than a quarter of Reborn. A single proper lane is at least 16 studs wide, (twice the amount of the average chassis width, eight studs). Multiply that times six, plus four for lane dividers and three for the primary. And now, given the complexity of the road layouts, imagine implementing proper road signs and dividers to every existing road part in the map. LAG. I think it's cool, but good luck retaining your playerbase with that shit. Nobody wants to increase map size even further, and what you're suggesting would make for a seriously cluttered and laggy map.  The only way to properly handle this would be to make a completely new map from scratch, again, and that would require a ton of effort. It wouldn't be worth it so quickly after the advent of Reborn, and it would only serve to amplify the problems brought on by it. Maybe in another two years, alright?  It's also important that the map is fun to play, and replayable. Will your suggestions increase or decrease the occurrence of combat? How will it affect the value of loot? Chance of encountering other players? Will it make exploration more fun by adding scale or more frustrating by boosting impatience? You'd need to increase server size, and that brings me right back to my previous point―lag, latency, blah, blah... ROBLOX.  Anyway, we realize that not everybody has a trash PC, but it's still essential that the game appeals to everyone. More lag, less players―less players, less money.  That's not to say that they won't make improvements, or that all of your suggestions are useless. Some of the stuff you want is mutual. They just haven't had the time. There are other priorities at hand. Gus has fixed or is going to fix most of his more significant mistakes. The MO is built under a cliff (not for long) and the fort used to be in a valley. Some of the stuff you've suggested can be done, and it will come in time. Reborn is still a new map, and with college finals and their ROBLOX internships there hasn't really been much time to improve.  All you need to do is be patient."

ApocalypseRising,3dtoen,CoolestUsernameEvar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"Well firstly the barrell is wood, making it so that it'd overheat if fired too much.

ApocalypseRising,3dgji7,ApocalypseStoryTelle,3,Thu Jul 16 02:28:35 2015 UTC,"It seems like a good story, but I feel that your other one made more sense.   Here are my issues:   for one, Japan during ww2 actually did horrid experiments, seeing how many ways they could kill a human being, how they could manipulate minds, how they could mutate humans. The actual experiments that Japan did are nightmarish. Unfortunately the person over the whole project never even got punished for what he did.  I also have an issue with the setting of the story, a forest northeast of dirk? What? And dirk is in Ukraine? This really doesn't make sense to me, I mean if you are going to use elements from Apocalypse Rising, you should at least get them accurate.  Also, Ebola, seriously? Why did you have to put that in this? Ebola has nothing AT ALL to do with Patient Zero, or the lore. It seems you were jumping all over the place, Japanese experiments, Ebola, mysterious virus that we have no information about? When I read the intro before the story I thought this would actually make sense. Did you even read the journals in amend? Where are the other subjects? The military wasn't involved with Trinity, neither was the U.S.    ""2015""    No, no, no. Apocalypse Rising does not take place in modern times. Gus pretty much made it clear that is takes place before 2000, more like around the 80's.    FINALLY, the ending... What The Literal Fuck. You pretty much threw that intro at the top making us hyped for this, was this supposed to be a series? I mean honestly. You ended the series on the first story! This whole story just sounds like you shit out your brain and pounded it on a piece of paper and typed what It looked like. There is no organization, it does not make sense.   Sorry if I seem harsh, but your last story was amazing and this one is just disappointing."
ApocalypseRising,3dgji7,TheNoobSlayer5674,2,Thu Jul 16 03:09:08 2015 UTC,"Edit3: sorry if I seem a little harsh with my swearing and stuff but I just don't wanna beat around the bush, okay? let's just talk straight.  EDIT: I have added and changed some parts of the story to make more sense. Your right, some of it does not make sense because holy fuck I didn't remember...APOC IS IN THE 80! I have tried to make it make more sense. here is my original comment:  I thought I was doing a good thing by remaking the series. If people vote to continue the other one, fuck it, then I will continue the other one. Any voters?  here is my response, currently, before the votes roll in and I don't know if I should continue the other one:   I'll respond in the order you wrote:   I know japan did horrible stuff. I said that. What was your point there? Apocalypse Rising NEVER says where it takes place. For me, I think it takes place in Ukraine. The story makes perfect sense, and Ebola DOES tire with Patient zero, and the story. That's a HUGE part of the story,  I brought it in to advance the story, it makes sense. The story perfectly ties Japan and Ebola etc together, please explain why it doesn't, for you? Oh shit, that says 2015? THAT'S AN EROR! SO IS AFRICA! I must have included the wrong part of the story. EDIT The story now makes sense, especially the ebola part. That is how trinity escapes.   The ebola outbreaks are supposed to be not Africa but 2000-2001: Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak in Uganda!   I didn't just end the series. The series has a continuation if you could wait and see. Like do you even play the game that /R/apocalypserising is about? of course everything fell but that doesn't mean everyone is dead. that's kind of, you know...the concept of a survival game....."
ApocalypseRising,3dgji7,TheNoobSlayer5674,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:29:45 2015 UTC,"Mate, your story did not really make sense, just going to straight up and tell you. You could've cleared out a lot of places where it left me hanging by adding more details.   By my first point, I was just saying that since you were writing about the horrific things Russia and Germany did, you should have added what Japan actually did and then said, ""but even worse"" or something afterwards.  I respect you for trying to write an original story and not completely copying other people.   This is my most important point:  This is more like a prologue type thing. You shouldn't had made it a ""part 1"" if it isn't your main storyline, it is beginning.  Still don't agree with you on the Ebola and Japan thing."

The cars will hit a small roadblock and shoot across the map, when you get in a car it will hop onto a roof, if you climb a ladder you will flop.   Then you'd have to fix everything that it breaks. And that may require either roblox releasing another update that also ruins the game even more. It would be a nice thing to have it you could select the version of roblox you want your game to be on so you don't have to fix it every time it updates."

But, would it be possible to make apoc use a stable version of roblox, or somehow not update? I don't know how to explain but basically I am saying that you could decide not to update the game to the most current Roblox version, so you could either opt out and keep apoc the way it was without having to mess with updates?"

I tried to calculate with some simple math but messed it up, someone who didn't sleep all the math classes, help?  With DevEx, you can make 10,000 US dollars/month, just by creating a game with tools and LUI, which roblox gives us. It is alot, and than money isn't all that those games produce, meaning ROBLOX is taking big, atleast 50% of all the income, that would go to creator monthly. Look at the players, so meny have bought something from Roblox, whenever it is Robux or just BC and stuff like that, income is big, but they show their love to us with shitty update which will break the best games, yay new toolbar.

I find urbis fun because I can do what i want and honestly once they fix the game and it's in beta or public it's going to be much more fun. I can't wait to trick out a sports car and live in a $300 apartment and have tons of every type of food and all the clothes and I can just feel so complete its going to be so fun

There is getting a few bad skins (50 x 4) and trading it for I don't know one good skin (200)  , then there's getting many bad skins hoping to get a good one. You have to buy more to get what you want instead of buying a few crap ones to get one you choose. Also, skins have a consistent value, the only times they would increase or decrease in value is if someone likes or dislike a skin."

ApocalypseRising,3cz71f,22GoixYT,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:44:50 2015 UTC,mobile wall cover
ApocalypseRising,3cz71f,Krektonik,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:53:30 2015 UTC,"That was cheap, but shouldent have been a reason to get a ban."
ApocalypseRising,3cz71f,SupYouMadBro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:34:40 2015 UTC,"Wall cover was not meant to be a game feature by the devs,  so it is considered a bannable offense if you exploit it  /u/onlyatnite"
ApocalypseRising,3cz71f,SupYouMadBro,2,Sun Jul 12 05:28:07 2015 UTC,"are you retarded? it's a game element, you can't get in trouble for using a game element."
ApocalypseRising,3cz71f,TheNoobSlayer5674,3,Sun Jul 12 02:59:03 2015 UTC,yeah but its kinda the same as exploiting a feature for a different purpose or advantage.  like walls and how u can have mobile cover.  this allowed me to solo raid a base by purposely using a P0 attack to my advantage.
ApocalypseRising,3cz71f,Equalizion,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:01:03 2015 UTC,SO you purposely risked being killed by P0 to kill someone? you can't get in trouble.
ApocalypseRising,3cz71f,TheNoobSlayer5674,3,Sun Jul 12 03:09:01 2015 UTC,"P0 can't kill you.  no matter what health you are at, it will set you to one health. (somewhere around that number)"
ApocalypseRising,3cz71f,Moses747,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:11:01 2015 UTC,it can kill you if you don't have full health.
ApocalypseRising,3cz71f,Equalizion,3,Sun Jul 12 04:19:23 2015 UTC,"No, i have seen videos and tried it myself, with 1 health, i ran towards P0 and nothing really happend, wake up at hospital with 1 health or so. Only thing that basically would kill you is a bug with damage of P0 or player waiting for you. PS, Don't scream at chat you are getting attacked by him, everybody will just go camping there."
ApocalypseRising,3cz71f,TheNoobSlayer5674,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:27:17 2015 UTC,"I don't need a ""PS DON:T GIV UR LOCATIAN LOL"". I've probably been playing this game longer than you. And I have experience as well from dying because of low health when being teleported."
ApocalypseRising,3cz71f,Equalizion,3,Sun Jul 12 04:36:10 2015 UTC,"Patient Zero sets your health value to <5 or somewhere around that. Perhaps before in previous versions it'd kill you, but it won't anymore."

I have played since v3's first patches, first time i actually played was all the way at v1 with my friend, but i wasnt impressed back then, v3 gave me reason to play it more, so don't know have you actually played longer than me. I have experienced P0 or subject 3 about 60 times when playing apoc, together, maybe more or less, and i havent died at 5.0.0 once to P0. Dont know if you are talking about experience or one of the bugs at scripts that could kill you, but if that's the case, fuck you."

ApocalypseRising,3czskk,Gakot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:07:57 2015 UTC,"Depends on his internet and when he has time to upload. Either way, it could have been recently unpatched. The problem was, apparently, that an exploit that was supposed to cost money was cracked and leaked and a bunch of scrubs started using it. It ended up being patched faster because of that.   I would have hoped that it was permanently patched, but I guess that's not how things work out. I hope this time whoever is selling this exploit has figured out a way to prevent it from being cracked so that this does not happen again.   Being teleported really sucks, but at least it is not happening in bulk."

ApocalypseRising,3cxkoi,apocthrowaway,2,Sat Jul 11 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"It's less of a simulator than it used to be. In the initial draft of Urbis, you actually had a work schedule, hunger and thirst bars, and you would even have to fuel up your vehicle.  It's much more fun now, and less harsh."

ApocalypseRising,3cucsm,pman8362,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:08:32 2015 UTC,"Just because when the players pick those perks they get good advantages, so good that it makes them better than other players, there is no balance to keep it equal. For example: The murderer does 10% more damage to players, whereas the stealthy is only prone. If a noob picks stealth and you have murderer does that seem fair?"

ApocalypseRising,3cq5k2,rhinguin,0,Thu Jul 9 22:24:09 2015 UTC,"Less people hack on Reborn, but I think it's because they don't know they can.  I do not have any proof of me doing this, but go play Reborn.  There have been plenty of encounters with other exploiters.  Reborn is no more safe than Reimagined is, and i'm just curious as to why they said it would stop injections.  There was all of this talk about Amend being the new safe haven for hackers once Reimagined got FE, but FE isn't even going to stop the hacks? What the fuck is the point in saying that?"

ApocalypseRising,3cq5k2,bagelz43,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:02:33 2015 UTC,All of those should be impossible on Reborn. Are you sure the people actually die?
ApocalypseRising,3cq5k2,Krektonik,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:58:22 2015 UTC,that means you probably directly hacked the server instead of going through your client
ApocalypseRising,3cq5k2,Narroby,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:05:18 2015 UTC,u r such a c00l h4x0r
ApocalypseRising,3cq5k2,Krektonik,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:38:44 2015 UTC,"Here's a simple loophole.  The clientside sends and receives data with the serverside.  Bandit A teleport hacks Survivor B to Union Square.  B's clientside isn't affected, A sees B in Union Square, and kills him.  A's clientside tells the serverside that B is taking damage, and the serverside sends it to B's clientside, so on B's clientside, he is taking damage.  B is now dead. A cannot loot B's body in Union Square, he would have to find the actual body to get the loot to show on serverside.  /u/ALXUserquestion"
ApocalypseRising,3cq5k2,TheRisenDrone,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:36:09 2015 UTC,"but that's a whole another category, because you can send information about damage and interaction with characters, but you can't do stuff like deleting baseplate"
ApocalypseRising,3cq5k2,zombie-rat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:39:44 2015 UTC,"yeah I'm just saying that hacking and exploiting is still possible in Reborn,  including tp hacking (in a way) and invis exploiting"
ApocalypseRising,3cq5k2,Krektonik,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:43:16 2015 UTC,there are a few problems with this but the idea is right
ApocalypseRising,3cq5k2,Legoblockhead,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:59:20 2015 UTC,"It depends. Apoc might have the gun raycasts serverside, in which case there needs to be a direct line between A and B. If A is teleport hacking, it'd only happen on his client, so the serverside raycast wouldnt see B.  I think this should be how /u/zolarketh coded it, otherwise its left open for hacks."
ApocalypseRising,3cq5k2,ShadowTitans,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:44:34 2015 UTC,"No, it's not like that. It's how people randomly die and are like ""scr!pt kill!11  In reality they got tped  I don't have video footage of someone tping, but someone tped to me twice and I actual saw his actual body?

You can't sit here and say Apoc is as good as it ever was, because you would be lying to yourself.  The amount of bullshit that takes place in both reimagined and reborn is outstanding.

ApocalypseRising,3cm63r,TheNoobSlayer5674,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:30:00 2015 UTC,AMD FX processor.  That's your problem.
ApocalypseRising,3cm63r,Gakot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:59:49 2015 UTC,That moment when it runs arma 3 at 60-90 fps but according to you the processor is shit
ApocalypseRising,3cm63r,TheNoobSlayer5674,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:12:24 2015 UTC,It is.   AMD FX processors are old and even dual core i3s outmatch them in a lot of games lol  Not to mention the Pentium G3258 which is a 3.2ghz dual core (no hyperthreading) processor  EDIT: Maybe 60-90fps on low settings...or maybe you lied about that just like you lied about your ROBLOX fps. The computer you linked does not even have a decent graphics card
ApocalypseRising,3cm63r,Gakot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:45:28 2015 UTC,"This is not true. The AMD FX-8350 is one of the best processors out there, 4.0ghz and 8 cores for only around $160. Compared to the i5 4690k it is a beast for that price. This is a very good cpu made by AMD. Others.... Are not so well."
ApocalypseRising,3cm63r,TheNoobSlayer5674,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"LOL.    The AMD FX-8350 is one of the best processors out there   No, it's NOT EVEN CLOSE LMAO. It might be one of the best AMD processors, but that's only because AMD has never been close to Intel in terms of performance. They are purely budget processors.   You seem like one of the people who thinks that number of cores and clock speed mean everything to a processor. Take an i5-4690k, for example. With a lower clock speed and four less cores, it beats the FX-8350 in every benchmark test other than the Passmark NON single core test. It even runs cooler, too.   The processor I currently have, the i7-4790k, is actually aging and there are many more better processors out there. It still completely smokes the highest end processor AMD has (FX-9590), even though the AMD processor has eight true cores and a 4.7ghz clock speed, compared to my i7's 4ghz clock speed. This time, my processor beats everything that AMD processor puts up against it."
ApocalypseRising,3cm63r,Insidiousness_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:10:07 2015 UTC,"I don't believe you have a $1000 cpu.   This explains why you would buy an amd fx-8350. The difference is not noticeable, amd is better for a budget pc, this is true, but for gaming it doesn't have much of a difference unless you are running sli or crossfire gpu configurations."
ApocalypseRising,3cm63r,Gakot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:28:17 2015 UTC,"I never said I have a $1,000 cpu?   Also, are you stupid? The i7-4790k is only about $300   Also, you're kidding, right? LOL! A better processor makes a WAY bigger difference. Anyways, practically any i7 would completely destroy the AMD processor. There is not a chance that the AMD would win unless you need to spend less money.   My PC costed about $1,400 with an i7-4790k and a GTX 980 Ti, and I actually had a reused i5-4690k before I went and bought the i7. When I switched out the i5 with the i7, it made a MASSIVE difference. Anything that says it does not make a difference is complete bullshit. This guy in the video doesn't seem to know what he is talking about. I have been working with computers for years, as well, and I'm not as clueless as he is. Try LinusTechTips for somebody who knows what the hell they are talking about.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVBqwlnmlM  PROS: Intel CPUs run cooler. Intel CPUs use less power. Intel CPUs are more powerful. Intel CPUs are newer.   CONS: Intel CPUs are more expensive  PROS outweigh CONS if you aren't stuck behind a budget.   The i7 has better single-core performance, renders way better, has better gaming performance, etc, than any AMD processor currently available.   Try this for benchmarks:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDVcpAhegWs"
ApocalypseRising,3cm63r,Gakot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:15:00 2015 UTC,"I read it wrong, sorry, I thought you had the i7-5960x.   Anyways, the AMD processors aren't complete shit. For a budget build they are a nice thing to have. The AMD FX-8350 is good because it is a good cpu for a budget and won't bottleneck the higher-end cards like the gtx 980 and the 970.  I would've went with the 970 though if I were you because of the price and SLI will destroy anything you throw at it. It is obviously the best bang 4 buck card besides AMD's R9-390x."

But either way, it just jumps up anyways. In reborn, it happens due to a latency with the driver. They will just be driving and then like up a slope, the vehicle physics doesn't detect the gap between the wheels and the ground so it continues going in that direction. And then when someone jumps out of the car, the car just flies into the air in slow motion. I tried being as explicit with my report as possible, hopefully this helped, maybe it could be something with anchoring the car when someone jumps out and the speed of the car is currently at 0.

ApocalypseRising,3cfpby,TheNoobSlayer5674,2,Thu Jul 9 17:28:04 2015 UTC,"What is this glitch and how does it affect us?  The 'space car' glitch is very common in my experience, and it is a very game breaking glitch. (in my opinion) I do not know if it is caused by latency, but I do know this: In reborn, (for my friends and I) there is almost a 50% chance of getting this glitch when exiting a car, and especially when you're in big groups. I don't use cars except for bait now, because of car latency where I'm driving a car and everyone else sees a teleporting piece of shit, the weird turning (I turn left/right and the car sometimes turns about 25 degrees or doesn't turn at all, and this glitch.   How do you get the glitch?  (Rare/Common) In reimagined: While entering a car, the car may jump up to the height of a robloxian.  (Extremely Rare) In reimagined and reborn: If you spawn, and you spawn inside a car, (or somehow get stuck in a car) while trying to escape, you will very rarely be flung off the map and the car will launch up to about twice the height of reimagined's fort ruins, hill and all.  (Extremely Common) While getting out of a car in reborn, it will damage you and launch up from the height of a robloxian to the height of reborn's RT.  (Rare/Common) While 2 or more people are getting out of a car and the previous glitch happens to 2 or more people at the same time, the car will usually kill everyone nearby and fucking launch to god knows how high, it looks like space, and the car looks like a white speck in the sky without binoculars. My friend and I were lucky enough not to die when the car launched: Mute the sound.  What causes it? opinion, not information, kiddies  I am unsure about this, but I think when you get out in reborn and reimagined, it sometimes gets the car's wheels stuck a stud or two in the ground in the ground, and it slowly rises up in Reborn. But sometimes in Reborn, (due to the nice non-flat surfaces) it goes deep and flings up because roblox physics. In reimagined, it doesn't come up, and when you get back in, it comes back up and sometimes flings up a tiny bit. When stuck inside a car, it's simple, the car isn't supposed to be clipped inside you and you're trying to get out and it flings both of you, because roblox physics. If this paragraph is true, my solution would be to find out what causes the car's wheels to go underground and stop it, and to make cars harder to get stuck into, and make it so you spawn in ontop of cars instead of inside them.  I reposted this in the comment section, since I was getting alot of hate.  tl;dr the cars are practically unusable because of this glitch and you need to fix them"

I try and predict where they would be next most of the time and it usually works for me."
ApocalypseRising,3ch9yk,EeyoreNation,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:08:51 2015 UTC,Don't give me bullshit. The video is fuzzy and generally bad quality on the highest possible quality. Render it in 1920x1080. Your computer might get decent frames but it still looks like shit in video format.   The intro really is not better than nothing. It's ugly.
ApocalypseRising,3ch9yk,Gakot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:32:32 2015 UTC,"The video is not fuzzy at all, do what I said, get your quality settings off auto and put it on 720p."

ApocalypseRising,3cc6zq,Creatism,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:50:54 2015 UTC,"Barbed wire would never work for three reasons:   You could just move barbed wire to kill people from long distances. This is extraordinarily unfair. If you couldn't move barbed wire after deploying it (to prevent the first thing) it'd be very hard to use because if you messed up that was it. If there was a way to prevent it from doing damage while moving it, you could still troll people by blocking them into doors, placing it right in front of them, or generally trapping people on the fly. The difference between barbed wire and doing this with any other material is that barbed wire would do damage, giving them an actual gameplay disadvantage (as opposed to just being a troll)."
ApocalypseRising,3cc6zq,Skullsmasher1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:28:55 2015 UTC,"Solution to 1 was 2, solution to 2 is being able to pick up barbed wire after a delay sorta like c4 and land mines, and 3 is just as bad as walls and other industrial building materials. Simply move them or pick them up. Harmless, really. :P"
ApocalypseRising,3cc6zq,TheNoobSlayer5674,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:29:01 2015 UTC,"To solve problems 2, and 3: I have always wanted building materials to have a health to them. So, if I am using my walls as mobile cover, someone can just light them up and the wall will break, because let's face it, walls aren't immortal. A brick of C4 placed at the front of the building someone is basing in would not only destroy the building now, but the building materials in its range. Importantly, I would not want some green health bar floating over my stone walls. I suggest that the items gradually show cracks in them ( kind of like in minecraft).  How this solves the problems is that, if you misplace your barb wire, you can now just swing your hatchet into it, or spray into it with your G18 and poof it breaks. This doesn't mean you get your original barbed wire back, it just means that the barbed wire will no longer be in that spot, he could maybe add an animation like with buildings blowing up where their scraps stay for aminute but eventually go away.

ApocalypseRising,3c9zsr,rhinguin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:10:56 2015 UTC,"path finding would be OK, but it would kinda make them OP as starters couldnt run away from them, as they would find their path... also i dont like zeds following me all the time. mutated zombies, like at the last of us, would be nice but fk no, they dont have time cuz they were busy fishing at alaska and doing power-meelee-actions."
ApocalypseRising,3c9zsr,Equalizion,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:29:44 2015 UTC,"Starters could still get away from them, maybe if the zombies had pathfinding their speed could be nerfed I guess, but damage increased by a small amount. The mutated zombies are cough rare. For the mutated zombies there could be ones with increased speed but less damage done if they hit you, stronger ones that could either be muscular or obese or even have vests and helmets are slower but soak up damage and take a lot of health, zombies that actively hunt you once they see you, they are a bit slower but make no noise when aggroed, riot zombies are like the stronger zombies that have a vest resembling the one on the player and a helmet along with face mask, these are the strongest health wise besides P0 but they are very slow and still deal a lot of damage, infected are not zombies but survivors that have died, they appear after a corpse despawns, they look like the player but do not have his vest or backpack, only his clothes and accessories, the infected are stronger and faster but drop an item from the previous corpse, the rarity of the drop depends on the rarity of the item in the dead player's inventory.   Adding the infected would be a nice addition and would also be unnerving when looting a corpse because at any moment it could turn and kill you while looting, zombies will wander towards a dead corpse and appear to be eating it. A player looting the corpse would have to be wary of zombies and the corpse turning."
ApocalypseRising,3c9zsr,TheNoobSlayer5674,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:20:04 2015 UTC,isn't it the point for updates along with updating zeds somehow from being back from 1.0?

ApocalypseRising,3c9zsr,ZyphoRBLX,-1,Mon Jul 6 14:35:43 2015 UTC,Usually equipping your gun takes 1-2 seconds. I don't see how it's a major disadvantage though.

ApocalypseRising,3c9zsr,Zealiance,2,Mon Jul 6 15:53:23 2015 UTC,Well with all the lag and latency and peoples computers it may be more than a bug.

So I did, we got a military car, great loots one of us had a survival pack the other military. So we drive into Yale, I get out kill some zombies and suddenly the guy leaves the group shoots me in the head 30 times with a FAL (exaggerating) and grabs my loot. When I esplanade I say ""why'd you do that"" he says ""because you killed me back in amend.""   I'm not kidding, that was his reason.  Anyway, later I stole back my car ran him over and took back my gear."

We ended up teaming with him and we had a whole bunch of fun we had a convoy and with my motorcycle a urial and a humvee. When we went to trinity I jumped of my bike and it hit him he then left the group and tried to kill us but we ran in to the main building and I placed a so mine and when he walked in he stepped on it and I sprayed him down got his gal with like 20 drums (exaggerating) and we my cousin kept his hk21 after I keept begging for it. The end of my best streak ever was by a haze who nuked the server :'( I'm so bad that my highest badge is bandit still after that.

I mean you haven't used the bank in any other town or city but KIN but include some buildings you haven't used in other towns or cities. This will make people like the town/city better than the dealership we already have.

ApocalypseRising,3c683j,Gakot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:30:28 2015 UTC,It WAS patched. For like a day and then elite hackers on v3rm found a way to exploit roblox's high tier security again
ApocalypseRising,3c683j,Kadykchan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:41:41 2015 UTC,"Still patched. People are not novesting anymore, they are doing what I said - spawning and then using that to glitch."

ApocalypseRising,3c683j,zolarketh,3,Sun Jul 5 11:02:17 2015 UTC,Wasn't deadzone part of the reason ADS and attachments was added back in the v4 days?
ApocalypseRising,3c683j,ZyphoRBLX,8,Sun Jul 5 11:44:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's no secret that ADS was added in 4.1 as a direct response to DeadZone. We're going through a rough patch right now, though, due to general badness of reborn"
ApocalypseRising,3c683j,Cyclops7747,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:49:54 2015 UTC,"Well after Reborn is out of the hospital, what's gonna be your response to ""Mad Rising""?"
ApocalypseRising,3c683j,PimentROBLOX_ALT,4,Sun Jul 5 07:54:06 2015 UTC,"Probably nothing because it won't be a serious competitor to Apoc. If it ever makes it to market, it will almost definitely be a R2D-style game"
ApocalypseRising,3c683j,PimentROBLOX_ALT,3,Sun Jul 5 08:01:31 2015 UTC,That's not to say we won't keep going with updates

ApocalypseRising,3c683j,TheFriffin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:48:36 2015 UTC,Exactly; DZ got destroyed by Apoc and we've killed DM as far as I know.
ApocalypseRising,3c683j,CelestialWraith,3,Sun Jul 5 13:14:14 2015 UTC,Deadzone was remade as Unturned and DZR.  DZR is the STALKER of DZ. Everyone has OP weapons.
ApocalypseRising,3c683j,Velkrim,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:54:23 2015 UTC,"Actually Deadmist became free recently, it can become a major competitor, if there will be no patches more people will go play dm for it's hacker-free environment rather than Apoc."
ApocalypseRising,3c683j,MASTERLUKE755,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:56:12 2015 UTC,"That game is the exact opposite of ours. No starter weapons, harder gameplay, it's what people wanted with Reborn, except it's not executed well and doesn't draw attention to the casual fanbase. We practically killed it already."
ApocalypseRising,3c683j,Reliced,2,Sun Jul 5 09:59:29 2015 UTC,"That's why people get bored of Apoc.

ApocalypseRising,3c62dz,patrickmoneyy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:29:10 2015 UTC,Yep. having ADS and Regular Sensitivity as the same will be a little frustrating

Seeing as I do have a mouse that can change DPI I have no need for such a feature. Furthermore, I would hate for this to be implemented and then cause problems with me just pressing a button on my mouse, which saves me the time of going into settings in game and changing it there.

ApocalypseRising,3c546o,iJustGotRekt,2,Sun Jul 5 20:49:38 2015 UTC,He really doesn't have those skills to the extent you think he does. He mostly gets other people to develop the games and then kicks them to the curb.
ApocalypseRising,3c546o,Shadowstar1000,2,Sun Jul 5 16:33:25 2015 UTC,"Not to spark a debate here, but you are clearly uneducated when it comes to the game development process. Much more goes into a game than just the programming behind it. There is a full design team dedicated to the modeling and creation of characters, storyline writers, marketing teams, advertisements and their coordinators, those responsible for the media surrounding the game, and much, much more. No single person possesses all of these skill sets and in order to be successful you need someone to do the job, and do it well. He cannot run the entire operation on his own! Also, not to mention the fact the job market is shit right now and no one is hiring. Those who do get the jobs tend to be those with a college degree, and at the very least a high school diploma. Otherwise, employers have no way to verify your skills and assets. That is why it's important to focus on your education so you can at least have something to fall back on if ROBLOX fell through. I mean they cap your profits, you could thrive here for a while, but there is no way to guarantee people will keep playing your game. It's an unstable platform that could shift at any moment and completely screw you over at any moment. tl;dr - Coding is only a small portion of game development, education is important for jobs, and roblox is an unreliable platform for long term game hosting and/or development."

That was not my point, so while I knew all of that, I didn't say any of it-for my point was not that. I had a different opinion completely unrelated to what you just said, and now i'm done here."
ApocalypseRising,3c546o,TheGunCreator,2,Mon Jul 6 06:21:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, not once did I mention or even refer to my knowledge of the topic so your point of how I ""think [I] know everything"" is invalid. Notice how I started the comment with,""not trying to spark a debate,"" but I guess you didn't take the time to comprehend that as your immaturity immediately put your mind into a scramble because for once, someone actually disagreed with your biased opinions. Fun fact, people will disagree with you on reddit, and you should learn that you can be wrong. If you had known everything I had stated, why is it that you reacted so aggressively? Also, you typed in all caps in the last post about how coding is everything and how loleris has education, along those lines... So that was the point, and I was fixing the flaws in your post, not trying to argue but simply make a correction. If you're too immature to handle being wrong and someone confronting you on your error, then I would leave the reddit community. If you had known all of this information, and this was all on that same very point I mentioned, why didn't you put it in the original post? Your comment is confusing and leads on a weird, unconventional path to no real conclusion. First stating that you know everything, then that you have unrelated opinions, then flat out leaving the conversation hanging on ""I'm done here""... The post is unorganized, makes no sense, and does not solve anything. Though it was fun debunking your lies, I think I've wasted enough time here tonight. Next time do some research before you try and be an expert on game creation, as you're not very good at lying. Then again, you're not very good at covering your lies either. Nevertheless, this was fun."

ApocalypseRising,3bxgxm,rhinguin,2,Fri Jul 3 01:33:28 2015 UTC,"And you're implying that it normally takes 30 shots from an M3 (all of which hit btw, the clouds of red mist indicated that) to kill someone. With the M3 doing about 14 damage per shot, it should only take about 7 body shots MAX to kill someone, and even less headshots."
ApocalypseRising,3bxgxm,TheRisenDrone,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:38:35 2015 UTC,"Well you are for sure that they all hit, red mist just means that you hit a shot. Again there is server lag as you said so that red mist could lag for a while and still appear on your screen. Also, by definition of a randomized spray pattern on apoc it is almost impossible for every shot to hit unless you use aimbot. So im just pointing that out dude."
ApocalypseRising,3bxgxm,pman8362,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:39:45 2015 UTC,"I'm well aware that more than 7 hit. The guy would freeze for like 3 seconds or so at a time, then teleport to a different location before I could get some more shots on him.   In short, I'm definitely sure I landed over 7 shots on him. Maybe less than 30 landed on his body/head, but I guarantee many more than 7 hit."

ApocalypseRising,3bxgxm,pman8362,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:05:53 2015 UTC,"That doesn't matter... Each shot does at least 14 damage. So regardless of the Rate of Fire, you should definitely have killed the person with at least 7 shots hit."

Gus/Keth have a way they want the game to be, and they're trying to run their lives and make the game FOR US. They choose how they want people to play their game because it is THEIR GAME."

ApocalypseRising,3bv94h,zombie-rat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:58:27 2015 UTC,"IMO, the Amend city wasn't the best thing about the Amend map. It was the asymmetrical layout of the landmarks and loot, which forced you to make a decision over whether to enter high player frequency zones."
ApocalypseRising,3bv94h,Lb97RBLX,2,Thu Jul 2 13:59:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Everything about Amend Map is better. Well, almost"
ApocalypseRising,3bv94h,PimentROBLOX_ALT,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:28:48 2015 UTC,amend was trash. flat terrain. pointless towns. hardly any military spawns. no thanks

ApocalypseRising,3bv94h,Lb97RBLX,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:58:19 2015 UTC,Not really...
ApocalypseRising,3bv94h,Lb97RBLX,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:19:54 2015 UTC,those are facts. you can't argue them.
ApocalypseRising,3bv94h,zombie-rat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:35:13 2015 UTC,"There are hills, so it's not flat, there are also pointless towns in all of the kin maps, and the rediculous amount of miliatary loot you can find in the kin maps makes it unrealistic and dumb. Just shot down your facts like a freshie getting shot by a FAL."
ApocalypseRising,3bv94h,PimentROBLOX_ALT,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:27:13 2015 UTC,you could honestly remove everything in amend besides forest and Military Airfield and Amend would literally still play the same. Round hills don't change the fact that the map is still predominately flat and barren. It isn't ridiculous to find military grade gear in multiple spots in Kin since exploration should be encouraged rather than camping 1 area the entire time.
ApocalypseRising,3bv94h,Dechromed,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:41:51 2015 UTC,"No, it wouldn't play the same. Round hills do change that fact as they are still hills. You're also forgetting that amend has something no other map does: a body of water. And you can literally find military loot in BUMP FLATTS"
ApocalypseRising,3bv94h,HeroesUnite,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:03:58 2015 UTC,wow water is so cool. amend is officially the best map now. and those round hills look great too.
ApocalypseRising,3bv94h,Dechromed,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:28:25 2015 UTC,"Look, back then it was a lot harder to make those hills, and the water really makes amends for any other complaints about the map."

Feel free to rummage through the code and submit a pull request if there's a bug I missed or just a better way of doing something.  This is an ongoing project so some features are still in the works but for the most part everything's working perfectly. If you run into any bugs though please don't hesitate to message the mods. Also, if you have any questions feel free to ask me; I love talking about this stuff."
ApocalypseRising,3bt2u1,Golden_Narwhal,4,Wed Jul 1 23:16:08 2015 UTC,"I hate to look the gift horse in the mouth, but could you add in the time to kill? Sometimes a gun with higher dps can have a slower ttk than a gun with lower dps"
ApocalypseRising,3bt2u1,Slabel,3,Thu Jul 2 19:05:56 2015 UTC,"This was actually considered when I first started working on the bot but I found that the output would have to be incredibly verbose for it to be of any value. You have to consider whether the shot hits, is it a headshot or bodyshot, and then how fast you're shooting; lots of variability. I'm looking at instead adding the minimum and maximum number of shots to kill which would be more practical and perhaps more useful assuming it doesn't break formatting. I haven't brought this idea to the mods though yet."
ApocalypseRising,3bt2u1,Golden_Narwhal,3,Thu Jul 2 23:52:14 2015 UTC,"Well you can calculate it by using time between shots (60/ROF) multiplied by the number of shots needed to kill (100/damage, rounded UP to the nearest whole number)"

Basically, i want third person like it is in dayz, where it is helpful for looking around but useless in combat. I dislike how apoc is currently just a third person shooter, and im hoping that at some point, if the AG first person style works really nicely, they might move it over to apoc. I just feel that third person needs to get major nerfs for the game to run nicer. For one thing, if its first person only, it will make bunny hopping a bit harder to use effectively, since it will throw you off target bit."

ApocalypseRising,3br9ij,Bertinellirblx,8,Wed Jul 1 14:41:54 2015 UTC,ugh  the clips were terrible and your aim is bad.  the editing was flat out cringy.  1/10
ApocalypseRising,3br9ij,ReformedUSA,6,Wed Jul 1 14:46:59 2015 UTC,"Intro:   The intro is too long. The shots are very slow There's no fog to be seen in the clips. The intro has no real purpose as you're just showing off some landmarks. No channel name or anything Get a recorder that doesn't have an ugly watermark   Conclusion; it's just plain boring  Montage:   The filter (if it's a filter you're using) in the first clip is weird and unfitting. Find one that doesn't make objects glow and make the screen darker than what it already is. Make night time clips more ""viewer friendly"" by lighting them up. Variate your clips between your ADS kills and hipfire kills. I don't want to see you demonstrating that you can use 3rd person. Include in-game sounds whenever you get the killshot on the target. It makes the footage much more natural. Footage of you dying isn't pleasant to watch. The effect on 2:19 is good, and such editing should be used more.  All of the kills should look like a challenge. Watching your entire team attacking one dude, or killing AFK players isn't very exciting. The ending wasn't satisfying. It didn't feel completing.     Overall, I'm going to give the montage 5.5/10."

ApocalypseRising,3bn2li,wonderful72pike,3,Wed Jul 1 17:14:31 2015 UTC,"There are two problems with this:  First, your numbers are a bit off, it does an average of 16 damage. That's according to the official wiki.  Second, the PP-19 does such low damage because it uses the same type of ammunition as the Makarov (9x18mm) and the damage is coded into the ammo, not the gun. If two guns use the same caliber, they will do the same damage.  TL;DR Your math may be right, but the way you got the figures and the way the game works don't support it."
ApocalypseRising,3bn2li,wonderful72pike,2,Tue Jun 30 17:28:47 2015 UTC,"I'm using the subreddit wiki, which was assembled by the moderators. The ""official"" wiki is crap. Also, do you have a source for the fact that the damage value comes from the ammunition? If you do, I'm all ears, but having dabbled in Lua and other languages, I know that it would come from the gun."
ApocalypseRising,3bn2li,wonderful72pike,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:20:47 2015 UTC,"That's the exact same wiki I used, the official one linked to on the sidebar. It's been said multiple times - guns that use the same ammo do the same damage. I can't find a source for that right now, but you can see it on the official wiki: the damage values are listed on the pages for the ammunition, not the gun.   And being a scripter myself, the damage may actually come from the gun, but it could definitely be dependent on the ammo used.  I'll try and find a direct source for the damage and edit it in here."
ApocalypseRising,3bn2li,CoolestUsernameEvar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:38:14 2015 UTC,"The one on the sidebar is inaccurate. The one on the subreddit wiki is much more accurate.  There would be no foreseeable reason for the damage value to come from the ammunition, since guns only fire one type of ammunition."
ApocalypseRising,3bn2li,Maelstromic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:48:09 2015 UTC,"I'll ask the question now, I know it to be true, I remember one of them saying it.  Also, which one is the subreddit wiki. Is it the Reawakening one?"

ApocalypseRising,3bn2li,ss917,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:10:01 2015 UTC,"Heavy slow moving bullets like in pistols have lots of energy up close but quickly lose killing power as they slow down and carbine cartridges like 5.56 have a small slug but go extremely fast so their energy doesn't disipate as quickly. AR doesn't have damage fall off so this characteristic isn't really noted.   Also the numbers you calculated are true but it's still difficult to calculate how much killing power a round has but typically faster lighter rounds (5.56) have more killing power than slow heavy rounds (9mm[Yes I realise 9mm isn't slow or heavy, it's just that it's slowER and heaviER]) even if they technically had the same muzzle energy  To give you an idea of this: imagine getting hit by a 100 pound wagon going 10 miles per hour (slow and heavy)  or getting hit by a 10 pound wagon going 100 miles per hour (light and fast) Same energy but obviously the light and fast wagon would hurt a lot more."
