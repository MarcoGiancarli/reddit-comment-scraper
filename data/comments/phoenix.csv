phoenix,3e3l46,relax-its-reddit,15,Tue Jul 21 19:37:19 2015 UTC,"50 grand minimum, full pension after 20 years"
phoenix,3e3l46,OutsmartBullet,8,Tue Jul 21 19:38:53 2015 UTC,"that's a tough one... $32k sounds rather low. but isn't it salaried. and gets watered down with additional hours. i know there have been discussions on reddit.  not to mention teachers having student loan debt, and say kids. then its just made impossible.  rent here in the valley seems rather crazy. houses are what $1500+. there's a few that cost less sprinkled around the valley but normally in terrible areas and with run down houses. same thing with apartment rentals.  going to need to look to see about this teacher vacancy. see who/where it affects."
phoenix,3e3l46,dementedsoldier,2,Tue Jul 21 18:43:33 2015 UTC,"I think maybe the public school teacher should become a government job so it could receive the same or better health and retirement benefits as politicians. The salary should start at 40k per year and go up from there depending on furthered education like masters degrees, etc. They should also be compensated for outstanding service by a committee of peers and parents of students. In other words, reward good work and pay them a little higher than entry level pay as beginner teachers, with room to make more doing a good job. My mom was an elementary school teacher for over 30 years, and while we got by on mostly her salary, she put herself through college before teaching and then got her masters when I was a kid, while she was teaching. I think she topped out at like 50 or 60 k per year, but we were a family of 4 and my dad never really had a steady job until I was in high school. There are good ones out there like her that do the job I'm sure, but since it's a job no one really wants anymore, it opens the door for less reputable folks. Or not, I don't know shit."

phoenix,3e3l46,devildeggs,3,Tue Jul 21 23:35:27 2015 UTC,"Start by giving back the money we took away from school districts last year.  Spend a huge chunk of the $266 million surplus to increase funding and teacher pay.  $32k for what teachers do is far too low to expect to be able to attract talent.  By the time you factor in lesson planning and all the work that goes into it outside of school hours, $32k can end up being as low as $15/hr.  The school that my wife teaches at had 18 teachers leave at the end of last year alone; that's just crazy and obviously something needs to be done to improve retention and recruiting.  Seems like this discussion has been going on for years and yet nothing significant has changed.  It's really too bad."

phoenix,3e3l46,s_s,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:00 2015 UTC,"It's not worth it to be a teacher.  I kind of wanted too, until I looked into it.  After finishing my BS, I considered it one of my options, because I wanted to be a cool science teacher like the ones I always had.  Then I was just deterred by the required additional school and certification crap.  If I was going to spend money to get my masters, I'm not going to waste it on a teacher's salary.  It pays less than less stressful jobs that require less work and less education.  If teachers were treated better and received better compensation, I'd have actually gone for it."
phoenix,3e3l46,gumjag,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:25:32 2015 UTC,"I think the trick would be to attract more people into teaching.  Maybe something like a free (as in, paid for by the state) masters degree if you agree to work X amount of years as a teacher."

phoenix,3e3l46,NellaRosmarino,6,Tue Jul 21 20:29:55 2015 UTC,The shortage isn't from a lack of people who want to be teachers. The shortage is from other states offering more competitive salaries. It's no surprise that nearly every single person I know from the ASU teachers college has taken a job out of state because they pay higher. Many are headed to Colorado and California.

phoenix,3e3l46,VaguelyNativeMurican,0,Tue Jul 21 23:46:52 2015 UTC,I know unions make it notoriously hard to fire bad teachers.  I mostly think public education is a failure.

phoenix,3e3l46,duganaok,2,Tue Jul 21 23:23:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's NOT hard to fire bad teachers.  But there is definitely a specific list of steps to follow and documentation that must be done - just as when we want to get rid of a student who is causing trouble, they get their due process.  Our union is very strong (as far as AZ unions go) and yet there are bad teachers who are booted every single year.  It all comes down to - did the admin follow the rules?  You can't just say ""I don't like you, but I can't fire you so you get to stay"" - if you follow the proper procedure, the teacher can definitely lose their job."
phoenix,3e3l46,Windadct,2,Wed Jul 22 00:32:03 2015 UTC,"Most good teachers will say they understand that issue - and the union mindset does not always help, however many ""bad teacher"" stories are parents raising unsubstantiated or single situation claims - so there really is no fair way to remove truly bad teachers.  Also - in what other profession is the lower 10% or 5% removed... ( ok I am in sales - in there it is common)  .... there is no budget for teacher professional development, there is no recourse for conflict in the workplace - it is really constricted and the only protection is the union. Because of the labor rules - the job has zero transportabilty - a teacher after 3-5 years in a good paying district can not move.. they are locked in to that district. My point being you have to take the good with the bad - and work to have an effective average.  That really is how companies operate - but in public ed the whole system gets criticized... trust me if the salaries of every level of management for commercial businesses we published - the same way the conversation would be very different."
phoenix,3e2bvw,TooBuyFor,5,Tue Jul 21 12:27:53 2015 UTC,I use renters warehouse for my property in MN. They charge $80 flat and first month's rent if they find your tenant.   Only real benefit you provide is rent collection. They start collections process if rent is more than 5 days late (I think).   They also offer two walk throughs per year to verify the property is being kept in good order. Is all this worth $1000/year to you?

Their website is fedwellfarm.com. Very nice woman running the place and she was very honest about what she knew/didn't know about a dog's personality and their health. She also takes all her dogs to a very good vet for vaccinations and any other needs that arise. Our dog was with her 6 months before we adopted her and is very healthy. Also when we were looking for a dog we found petfinder.com to be a great resource.

phoenix,3dxacg,Unnecessary_Timeline,6,Mon Jul 20 23:02:50 2015 UTC,"The article said they will use a crossover configuration while construction is happening. There may not be a new bridge any time soon, but I'm sure the highway will be open within the next 2 weeks."

A couple years, if I recall correctly. This is a smaller project but you can't rebuild a bridge that quickly.  Also I don't know how California's DOT compares to ADOT but judging by the state of their roads it's going to be a while before anything is done."
phoenix,3dxacg,apanthropy,3,Mon Jul 20 23:16:32 2015 UTC,"The cost of course goes to all of us - you're right that the drivers hurt the most, in the most immediate sort of way,  but we all end up paying more for freight (and for goods at retail) when there are transportation delays.   According to the 2008 Department of the Interior survey ""72,868 bridges in the United States (12.1%) were categorized as ""structurally deficient"", representing an estimated $48 billion in repairs, and 89,024 (12.2%) were rated ""functionally obsolete"", representing an estimated $91 billion in replacement costs.""     So we're looking at around $140bn to fix the nation's bridges,  but money is a circulatory resource so it wouldn't be a waste to spend it on that specific infrastructure.    ( This wouldn't be another Kanbashi because these are existing bridges, being used by existing people for legitimate commerce and transport)    I think it's a worthy investment,  the up front costs would be lower than the eventual costs of failure.     But I'm also the sort of person who replaces his car tires before the metal starts showing."

phoenix,3dxacg,JediMikeO,36,Mon Jul 20 15:39:06 2015 UTC,"He has a point though. The US desperately needs to invest in repairing our infrastructure. This is from the article:   The Tex Wash bridge, built on the eastbound I-10 in 1967, was listed as functionally obsolete in the 2014 National Bridge Inventory. Essentially, the bridge was listed as no longer adequate for its task, though it was not listed as having known structural problems that needed to be fixed.   There are hundreds, if not thousands, of bridges across the country that are in danger of collapsing just like this one, yet there is no solid plan at a federal or local level in most place to maintain them."
phoenix,3dxacg,dementedsoldier,8,Mon Jul 20 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"Good luck with that. What annoyed me most is how quickly other countries repair, fix things while we get stuck behind paperwork here in U.S."

phoenix,3dwm3r,NMnative,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:00:00 2015 UTC,"We were also new to the area and looking in the areas you mentioned about a year and a half ago. We were very lucky to meet Sara Waide Bowers at an open house and both my husband and I were taken with her forthright attitude and positivity.   I was a real estate agent for a couple of years in another state, and my bullshit detector is usually in the red upon meeting most other agents.  Not so with Sara. She was honest, professional and compassionate in every regard.  She was 8 months pregnant when we met her and showed us literally dozens of houses over the next month- marching around in the heat and never once making us feel bad for calling her out, sometimes on short notice, to see a new listing. She got to know both of us as people and worked hard to find a house that would work for us.  Ultimately, thanks to her knowledge of the area and her initiative, we found (and had a showing) of a house in Tempe that was perfect for us less than a day after it had gone on the market.  Offer was completed after we made up our minds on the 2nd day- deal was struck a few days after that. She did an excellent job of negotiating with an arms length seller (who frankly was a tool) and made everything go smoothly.  I was very impressed with her overall.  I would, and have, highly recommended her to anyone who would listen.  She's one of the best I've seen in AZ.  Hope that is helpful for your folks."

That is against the rules where I'm from, and with very good reason. I don't know what the laws are here, but I found a lot of this kind of attitude with most of the agents we met here.  It's important to note that Sara did have some recommendations of people she had used in the past to complete these types of tasks, but she had lists of people to choose from. She did not play favorites, and took pains to make sure we knew that we were not obligated to choose from her lists. She had these recommendations simply to help people who were new to the area and were not as well versed in real estate or interested in researching, and that we were allowed to choose anyone we wanted. More importantly, she was not in any way offended that we chose to use people/companies that we had researched on our own.  After the fact, she has stayed in touch to make sure we are liking the home, happy with everything that happened and see if we needed anything. She has made intelligent recommendations for AC contractors, home cleaning services, etc after the sale. She has been great to work with and continues to be an excellent resource over a year after the fact."

Kind of a strange way to protest, if it was even a protest. They were very polite.  EDIT: I understand now that they weren't protesters.

Holy shit that's retarded.    People literally booed ""all lives matter."""
phoenix,3ds2ah,BLOODY_ANAL_VOMIT,-4,Sat Jul 18 22:51:40 2015 UTC,"By saying ""All lives matter"", you ignore the real message of the movement and immediately dismiss it by arguing semantics. Of course ""All lives matter"", but by reducing the movement to the literal 3 words you are dismissing it and claiming that black people are not treated poorly by our society, that there isn't a problem for them to be protesting over. It is saying that our society treats white people just as poorly as it treats black people and both need remedied, which is demonstrably false.  Now I didn't see how the protestors handled this whole thing to comment on the situation at hand, but I whole heartedly agree that the rebuttal ""All lives matter"" shows the person does not understand the movement and likely does not see a problem with the way black people are viewed and treated in our country, primarily by the criminal justice system."
phoenix,3ds2ah,DesertCoot,10,Sun Jul 19 03:14:23 2015 UTC,"Booing that statement though is not a way to get people on your side. Of course black people have it hard, but saying ""black lives matter"" isn't helping. What does that tell us? What does their movement want to change? Sure we all want racism to end, but saying black lives matter isn't going to do much because it's not an actionable idea.    The civil rights movement fought for the right to vote and equal rights, the LGBT community fought for gay marriage and is probably now switching to trans rights, but these are policies that can be enacted. Saying ""Black Lives Matter"" is a rallying cry that doesn't have an end goal."
phoenix,3ds2ah,BLOODY_ANAL_VOMIT,2,Sun Jul 19 04:16:32 2015 UTC,"It most definitely does, and I think the fact that so many people don't see that shows they do need to do a better job in articulating the message. The goal as I see it, and I'm sure there are different perceptions, is to end the systemic racism as exemplified in our criminal justice system.  I highly recommend reading the book ""The New Jim Crowe"" by Michelle Alexander, and I believe the movement they are trying to start is precisely the grassroots movement that she espouses as foundational to the end of mass incarceration and the relegation of primarily black men to second class status."
phoenix,3ds2ah,DesertCoot,2,Sun Jul 19 16:40:39 2015 UTC,"I understand they want to end racism in the justice department, but that seems like a huge endeavor without any way to start. What's the first step in ending racism? Telling everybody to stop being racist?"
phoenix,3ds2ah,rocktheprovince,2,Sun Jul 19 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"Letting people know the racism exists is all you really can do. Especially with a black president, many people don't think it is as prevalent as it is. Another problem is that it isn't so much a problem with individuals being racist as much as different social systems (education, housing, criminal justice, etc) that have been built over the course of a couple hundred years where black people were explicitly considered less than human. It is not easy to change how our social systems function and will take time and a change in overall public consciousness, but I believe that over time, as more people become aware, they will agree it isn't right. Once that public consciousness changes, then the laws and structures of the systems will change. If I hadn't read that book, I would've never known the extent of the problem, so I always like to recommend people read it and I feel obligated to speak up in these threads."
phoenix,3ds2ah,DesertCoot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know about this group in particular, but as far as blacklivesmatter goes one broad end goal would be police reform.  But like in a lot of social causes, there is also an end goal that isn't a direct political policy. And that would be to, in general, raise political consciousness among people of color across the country."
phoenix,3ds2ah,lookuppage7,2,Sun Jul 19 06:28:04 2015 UTC,"Not just among people of color either, but to the white people who don't realize how poorly black people are viewed in the eyes of the law. I am a white male, but reading about mass incarceration and learning of how messed up the system is has opened my eyes. I believe that most people are not purposefully racist and don't see the racism inherent in our criminal justice system. If they did, they would have a problem with it, and the only way for real change is for most people to have that consciousness of the problem and recognize it as such.   The problem with enacting this is that if you tell people they are racist when they don't believe they are, they can shut down and call you a racist right back and the conversation can just entrench people in views opposite of what you are trying to promote."

I am not sure if you are speaking from experience but sometimes people will blatantly yell and curse at you because phoenix drivers have no idea how to share the road.

phoenix,3douov,beburk,3,Sat Jul 18 02:22:32 2015 UTC,"But if you're going against the flow of the reverse lane, than the left most lane of the direction that traffic is flowing (not the reverse)?  This situation is confusing because at Camelback the phoenix.gov website says specifically to make the left from the reverse lane."
phoenix,3douov,beburk,4,Sat Jul 18 02:48:33 2015 UTC,"From the City's website :  ""Permanent overhead signs will be mounted on new poles in advance of Camelback Road to alert drivers that left turns are permitted in the peak direction during the 7th Avenue reverse lane periods.""  Admittedly I haven't driven this stretch regularly since some time before these changes, but what I understand is that if you are heading in the peak direction (South in the AM or North in the PM), then you can turn left at Camelback."
phoenix,3douov,beburk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:04:11 2015 UTC,Thank you. I just realized that I didn't clarify in my original question that I'm looking specifically at turning left against the flow of the reverse lanes. E.g. turning left when: heading north between 6-9 a.m. and heading south between 4-6 p.m..  Maybe I'm wrong entirely... Now I wonder if the left turn being allowed rule only applies to with the flow of traffic in the reverse lane and not with traffic going the opposite direction.
phoenix,3douov,OlivOyle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:19:01 2015 UTC,You can turn left where you aren't explicitly prohibited (major intersections) but don't do it from the suicide lane.

Phoenix as a whole, has an amazing food scene there are somethings that I wish I had when I lived in places like Mississippi or southern CA. But all in all I'm never hungry. Bars are amazing all over the valley, from dive to music venues. Downtown is the best for art and more eccentric living. Tempe for school and college party's and Scottsdale for fancy and upscale life."
phoenix,3dnkro,thephoenixx,0,Mon Jul 20 06:51:28 2015 UTC,"I moved here recently from Edmonton, AB.  Here's my impressions vis a vis your questions:   Art scene/neighbourhood is sparse, with the highest concentration in DT Phx. Food scene is pretty mediocre, especially if you like immigrant family run type places.  There are lots of super pretentious places that offer odd or unusual cuisine, but again the actual fare itself tends to be mediocre - perhaps due to a lack of skill, or quality of ingredients? (I lean towards the latter, I've found it very difficult to get anything more than bog standard ingredients here; for me just finding goat feta in a reasonable quantity at a reasonable price was a huge pain) Public transit is extremely minimal; if you want to live without a car, make sure you choose your domicile very carefully.  Since everything is incredibly spread out here, if you want an active social life a car is mandatory (or friends who are willing to do all the driving).  I had hoped to ditch my car after getting here (didn't even own one in Edmonton) but it's not possible for me. Phoenix is sort of bike friendly, it has some lanes and such... but the drivers very much aren't.  I've lost count of the number of assholes who come up behind and honk or scream out the window, or try to get as close to me as possible in the lane to try and scare me for cheap laughs."
phoenix,3dnkro,samandiriel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:29:08 2015 UTC,Mediocre and food don't belong in the same sentence for Phoenix.  There is a staggering amount of great food here but you need to search it out.

My point was that there isn't one centralized food mecca here, instead there are tons of great pockets of little hidden gem hole in the walls and hundreds of very highly rated restaurants all over this metro area.  It might not be New York City or Paris but there are renowned chefs and great things to eat in this city."
phoenix,3dnkro,Ektaliptka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:46:02 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't somehow cease to exist... but Phx is such a huge spread out place that any hidden gems are pretty much lost in the noise because there doesn't seem to be any sorts of areas where one can go and just find such places - it's a major expedition for each and every one.  There's nothing like Yaletown in Vancouver, for example, or Whyte Ave in Edmonton.  A couple of places in Scottsdale are sort of like that, but while they have glitz and fancy fusion menus I've found that the food quality itself to be nothing special.  So, not having the time to search out the needles in the haystack, they're effectively nonexistent from my point of view.  Yelp is no help, because the majority of reviewers seem to prefer spicy greasy food.  Personal recommendations are helpful, but most of my coworkers are as unfamiliar with Phoenix as I am or again prefer spicy greasy stuff.   I think I'm one of maybe five people who brings their lunch... everyone else does fast food, every day :P  Probably what drove this home for me most was the food truck that came by our 500 person office last week - usually they are spicy greasy stuff and mobbed from 11-1, but this one featured steam buns, vietnamese spring rolls, etc. and they did pretty much zero business other than myself and I can say that with confidence s the food trucks park right ouside my office window)  There just doesn't seem to be much variety, and what there is is so thinly distributed and lost in the noise that it's nigh on impossible to find when one's palate doesn't match Joe Phoenix's.  All that being said, if anyone's looking for a super sushi joint I can recommend Hana in DT Phx (that a friend introduced me to) and Sushi Ken down on Chandler by the 10 (which is gawdawful ugly inside, but the Japanese family that runs it knows their stuff!)"

phoenix,3dlh36,IONTOP,8,Fri Jul 17 06:50:13 2015 UTC,"You take the lane. If I am not mistaken you can receive a citation for riding on the sidewalk. The likelihood is low, so I am sure it all depends on the discretion of the police officer.... for example if you are in a suburb on the sidewalk or downtown.   When riding at night you are required to have a rear red reflector on the bike somewhere and a headlight of a certain lumen rating.   Bikes have the right of way on the road in almost every instance... unless for some reason you are blocking more than  4 vehicles while traveling in your lane, it is law you have to pull over to let them pass (too lazy to post the link to the law, but most people don't know this).  Otherwise, obey all vehicle laws as you are obligated by law to stop at stop signs and stop lights, signal your direction for turns, and yield to foot pedestrians.  Also, you can get a DUI on a bicycle."

phoenix,3dlh36,Mikeaz123,5,Fri Jul 17 12:53:12 2015 UTC,Have always wanted to own a bike for this reason. So many hidden spots for exploration. The bike path all along Tempe town lake is gorgeous. And that 5 mile route going north into scottsdale along curry road looks fun! The heat sucks ass though lol
phoenix,3dlh36,samandiriel,4,Fri Jul 17 11:04:40 2015 UTC,"I've been biking to and from work for about 5 years (I live 5 miles from work). Every day I look forward to my lunch hour because I get to spend the whole time exploring neighborhoods and finding hidden gems. I used to hate the extreme heat of Phoenix but I find that I actually enjoy it now!   Good for you man, just remember to always act like a car. I hate how many bicyclists I see that give the rest of us a bad name.  Some tips for riding in the summer:    Cover up! I know it's hot, but the sun will damage you way more than the heat will. Trust your body's ability to self regulate temperature. Invest in a backpack that carries lots of water. I've gone through 2 liters in an hour when really pushing myself. Wear wicking clothes. I hate to be another douchebag in underarmour, but damn their heatgear series is amazing for our climate. It's very hard to find long sleeved/legged heat oriented clothes any where else. Wear something that covers your face and neck. I use a keffiyeh and wrap up. I may look like an Arab farmer or a guy deployed in Iraq, but they keep your lungs from drying out, protect from dust and insects, and keep the sun off your skin. Always remember: If a motorcyclist wouldn't do it, you shouldn't either. If you act like you belong on the road most people will treat you as such. Sometimes people are assholes, but the more of us who obey the rules the less of them there will be."

phoenix,3dlh36,SecondhandSlaves,2,Sat Jul 18 15:06:05 2015 UTC,It's not really necessary if you have the right clothes. Wicking clothes remove most of the stank so you just have to wait about 30 minutes after biking and then change out of them. Also deodorant and some kind of drying powder go a looong way

I'm not sure ditching your car counts as counterculture or alternative lifestyle tho?  I'm from Canada, so perhaps my definitions are rather more leftist than the American standard.

The people who complain the most about transportation options in the valley tend to be the ones living in the suburbs. Yes, you get bigger, newer houses for your money out there...they cost less because they come with inconveniences like long commutes. If there was a bullet train from west Goodyear to downtown PHX the housing costs out there would be insane.  I live uptown but would not bike to my job downtown because I am too damn afraid of the cars. I also rarely use transit, even though the service near me is pretty decent.   I see my car as an expensive luxury, I appreciate that I can afford it, but I definitely see it as a guilty pleasure.

phoenix,3dldxq,lxkhn,2,Fri Jul 17 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"Good:   Virga!  One of my most memorable Phx experiences is of my head and everything else higher off the ground than 6ft getting wet... but everything else below that being bone dry. The wonderful, soothing, cozy heat!  I am never cold, and coming from far far north I am ever so grateful for it.  110F is waaaaay better to live with than -40F, I can tell you that - I never have to worry that if I'm not properly attired, stepping outside could kill me dead in less than sixty seconds. The low cost of living... nice to have a bigger bang for my buck.  Plus there's an Amazon warehouse just a few miles from me - I often get next day delivery on things, which is kind of neato!   Bad:   Drivers are super extra dangerous!!!  And transit is super bad... there are usually no good alternatives to risking one's life daily on the roads.   The huge sprawl and low population density.  I think this is one of the main reasons Phx has no cultural enclaves like China Town or Little Ukraine - it's simply too difficult for people of a certain ethnicity or culture to clump together in dense enough numbers to reach a critical mass. The in-your-face religion.  Coming from a country where religion isn't a huge part of the culture and politics (and 25% are nonreligious), I feel smothered by it and frankly kind of appalled at it's prominence in politics and government.  It seems to be positively schizophrenic, given that separation of church and state is enshrined in law. The shallowness of food culture.  Phoenix often tries hard, especially in Scottsdale, but food culture here just kind of stinks.  Few to none fromageries,  patissieries, chocolatiers, speciality or import grocery stores, etc.  It's hard to find anything other than bog standard ingredients at the mostly chain grocers, too (goat feta cheese is my current pet peeve).   Much as I hate to say it, I can't think of anything uniquely Phoenician myself... perhaps I'm too new."

You can't expect to find the same quality of French food here as you would there.   And btw, you can get Mt. Vikos Feta at Whole Foods and I'm fairly certain at AJ's but don't quote me on the second one. It's generally regarded as one of the best Fetas sold in the US market."
phoenix,3dldxq,vangoghsmissingear,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"You can't expect to find the same quality of French food here as you would there.    While I listed French-type items, it's my general impression across the board - not just French stuff.  Tho I was most pleased to find goat in the meat section at Food City the other day when I was scoping that out (seems like a sort of cut rate Mexican themed bare bones grocery - I've never seen anything else like it here, very utilitarian looking place)   And btw, you can get Mt. Vikos Feta at Whole Foods and I'm fairly certain at AJ's but don't quote me on the second one.   I haven't tried Whole Foods yet (none anywhere near me) and didn't see anything at the AJ's I visited near Ahwatukee (which seems very pricey overall!), but part of it is I just want a big chunk of decent goat feta at a reasonable price.  I eat a lot of greek salad every day for lunch in an effort to eat healthy and cut calories, and Sprouts was the only place I found anything more than a 250g container at all, much less at a reasonable price.   In this instance it's not the quality per se I'm bitching about, but availability of something that is, culinary-wise, pretty common.  I was happy buying a 1kg pail of Krinos at SuperStore (which is a lot like Food City with a better colour scheme, come to think of it) - but here it was a major quest to find any at all.  Same with dry cottage cheese - nowhere I've looked carries just bags of curds (which is great in lasagne)."

Your personal familiarity with any nooks and crannies in Phx hardly makes it more livable or accessible to the rest of the population - telling me to 'tune in' is a condescending pat response and incredibly unhelpful.   And I frankly don't care what Phoenix you live in.  It has zero bearing on my own experience, and doesn't invalidate my impression just to say so.  Worse, the link you've provided is exactly what I'm complaining about:  Phoenix is all about greasy, lowest common denominator diner food and/or covering that lack of flavour up with salt, sugar, lard and hot chilies instead of actually providing decent fare.  Every entry on that page has a picture of something deep fried, overloaded with sugar or hot chili'd instead of flavourful.

Driving down the highway watching a haboob quickly coming your way when you have 30 minutes left on the road is a little bit unnerving. Cool as fuck to see the fucking gigantic wall of dust cover fucking everything if you aren't driving though. Dunno if you've witnessed one if not check out some pictures of Phoenix haboobs.  My favorite thing about Phoenix is when going to Suns games at US Airways Center is that if you park in a lot about two blocks away ($3-5 depending on how well the team is doing) from the arena coming off the 17, there's hardly any traffic when arriving or leaving. The other side of the arena is a fucking mess trying to get out.  It's just a city to me, nothing really makes me think ""Phoenix is great"" after living here 20 years. At least cops don't regularly gun down unarmed people or choke/beat them to death like some other very large metro areas.  Sick haboob picture, don't know or care how to post just pictures: http://talesalongtheway.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/the-phoenix-haboob-2.jpg  libs and illegals are down voting me because of my first sentence. if that isn't the reason explain why you down voted me."

In June of this year, they tried to increase my rate to over $100/mo for the same services. Even after getting transferred to retentions, where they tried to tell me I was getting new customer pricing or better (and even after offering to go down to the basic tier internet), they couldn't even get me down to $70, so they claimed.   So now I'm with Qwest. (I think their DBA name is stupid.)  Mostly off topic rant, sorry, but I would say the contracts with Cox aren't always bad. Worked out pretty well for me, until it ended."

The young man attempted the jump, slipped and fell to his knees on the granite below.  He shattered both patellas a broke a wrist.  He had to lie there  in pain, unable to move. My friends finished setting up the repel and went down.  One is a vet and another has wilderness first responder training so they were able to splint his wrist but the shattered knees made it impossible for him to use his legs.  Some of them stayed with him and some hiked out to get help.  It took a total of 6 hours to get a first responder, extract him from the canyon and get him to the trailhead.  Then he had the ride to the hospital after that.  Please don't take this trail lightly.  There is serious risk involved and you are far from any help."

phoenix,3dj5y5,az_liberal_geek,2,Sat Jul 18 03:54:02 2015 UTC,"All roof coverings are viable.  They each have their pros and cons.  30-year asphalt shingles work well if you are on a budget.  They will last longer than most people live in their houses.  If they are light colored, then they will notably help out your energy bill.  Not all will work with reflective panels in the attic, though, so if that's part of your energy solution then you might have a tougher time finding an appropriate choice.  Metal roofs last pretty close to forever and are excellent from an energy standpoint.  They cost notably more than shingles.  It can be done DIY if you know what you're doing.  Some people don't like the noise they make during rain or hail, but that shouldn't be an issue if you are inside.  They also can dent in strong hail and aren't as easy to repair as some other choices.  But you really can't beat metal for helping out with the energy bill plus long-term usage.  Tiles cost the most but they, too, will last close to forever.  They are also easy to repair if individual tiles break.  They aren't as good as metal from an energy point of view, but not bad (and better than shingles).  IF you are planning on staying in your house for the long haul AND you want to be as green as possible, then I'd suggest the metal option."
phoenix,3dj5y5,beenznrice,2,Fri Jul 17 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"A note of caution if you go the tile route is to have someone check if your roof structure can support the weight of the tiles before you buy the material. Source my dad has been roofing in AZ for about 30 years. Tile is absorbs heat better but is more expensive, and honestly will make your house look like every other tan colored house in the desert. I would stick with shingles, to reduce cost try to do the tear off yourself since it's pretty simple to do."

Only working from logic, I know nothing about roofing but saw that there were no comments.  The HVAC units can be moved, an electrician can put in a transfer switch for the power, you could very well end up paying for your roof with the amount saved in cooling and power with the solar."

phoenix,3dj5y5,darthgarlic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:33:25 2015 UTC,"Beating the Heat Homeowners in extremely hot desert climates need a roof that will not absorb heat and draw it into the house. Therefore, rubber roofing should be avoided. It will be painfully hot if you are working on it in the summer, and it will draw heat into the house. It's possible to find light shades of asphalt, but they are still darker than many metal and tile colors. Metal can also be hot to the touch, but light shades of metal reflect sunlight.Clay tile is a very popular option in Arizona, Nevada and other desert climates for good reasons. It is more expensive than metal or shingles, but it blocks heat and is relatively wind-resistant. Keep in mind that installing tile roofing requires training and special tools, so it is not a DIY project. In many areas, expert tile installers can be tough to find.  Was the first thing I found on google, just made sense to me."

The roof mount AC is kind of a bitch from the installers standpoint, but not much extra from a customers standpoint.  All in all, I would avoid the tiles.

phoenix,3dfun0,Molestoyevsky,2,Thu Jul 16 02:30:10 2015 UTC,"Why did the DA NOT file criminal charges?  Is there one set of laws for cops and another set for just plain citizens?  How about a little bit of equal justice under the law.  Do cops get an automatic pass for breaking the law?  If the DA can't do his job, perhaps the county needs a new DA who can pursue criminal charges against cops as well as citizens."
phoenix,3dfun0,io-io,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:49:59 2015 UTC,"The way qualified immunity for LEOs works is, a police officer can break the law provided that a court decides that a reasonable officer wouldn't have known that they were breaking the law.  ""Reasonable"" is a really terrible legal standard, but the use of the phrase allows that standard to be solidified in the courts rather than enumerated fully in the legislature (which is likely impossible).   So, although this infraction seems crystal clear, the DA is likely checking the internal investigation against current jurisprudence to determine how likely a case is. If another case like this slipped through the cracks, this will probably not be pursued. On top of this, many attorneys shy away from cases involving police defendants, because their job might get harder if they would otherwise depend on police cooperation.  There are probably some members of the DA's office, however, that have been participating with this case, especially the ADA for AZPOST, which oversees licensing of peace officers in this state."
phoenix,3dfun0,Molestoyevsky,2,Sun Jul 19 04:34:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply.  ""Reasonable"" is such a wonderfully descriptive term, especially in this particular set of circumstances.  It appears to be wholly reserved for the application to the law enforcement community, as opposed to being made available to the general population at large.  I am referring to the phrase ""Ignorance of the law is no excuse"".  Balancing those two concepts was the focus of my original post.  Here we have a law enforcement officer, who has had at least a modicum amount of training in the law, essentially receiving a pass - for an action that would probably have a citizen having the book thrown at them.  When you consider that the home owner was arrested, essentially for videotaping the officer inside her own home - it makes a mockery of the first amendment.  Just my opinion, but it appears the DA and his office is unable to balance the very fine concepts of the law, against basic common sense.  Common sense in this case assumes (a trained law enforcement officer) that the officer has a ""reasonable"" understanding of the Constitution (the basic law of the land), and in particular the Amendments.  Especially the Bill of Rights of which he violated.  To us, in the general population, watching from the outside, the DA goes to extreme measures to find every mitigating circumstance in not bringing charges against an officer, where they seem to cooperate extremely well in aggregating every possible violation a citizen may have broken, and bring every charge possible - plus a few extra for good measure.  This is where the police and the DA are loosing the respect and support of the general population.  Equal justice for all, has all but been forgotten.  How does the DA balance ""Equal justice for all"" against ""Reasonable"".  Just a rhetorical question.  The officer retired - has a side business, and in all probability will just drive down the road to the next city, and start all over again.  What is protecting the general population against this possibility.  How long does it take AZPOST to actually be effective - other than to protect their own.  Then one needs to also consider the liability of the city.  Where do the taxpayers and citizens receive protection against lawsuits from the qualified immunity for LEOs for their ""reasonable"" acts.  In theory cities can go bankrupt from these repeated ""reasonable"" acts.  In one instance you state that courts decide that they are reasonable, while the court in the next case determines that the city (taxpayer) is liable for the same act.  If there is liability, then there must be some instance of not being reasonable.  The two court instances are connected by a common act."
phoenix,3dfun0,mrbitchtitz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:56:43 2015 UTC,"Essentially, the qualified immunity that LEOs get was established because the amount of legal training that police officers get is decent but incredibly incomplete. If police were personally liable for every action taken that they were not explicitly trained for, then the chilling effect would be so severe that it might make law enforcement impossible. So the idea is: the agency/state/whatever institution is liable for actionable offenses rather than the officer unless the offense was 1.) trained against or 2.) egregious and obvious. This provides a financial incentive for state agencies to train law enforcement better, even if just to reduce the public's financial liability for the actions of police. Of course, this sometimes doesn't provide enough of a chilling effect for the individual officer. Even if they hate catching shit from their superiors/peers and feel like their career is set back, I think that's substantially different from knowing that you could be easily prosecuted for criminal/civil offenses from everyday things you do at work. I'm not sure which one is ""better,"" but my own prejudice is more concerned with public safety than the comfort of the LEO.    Now, I don't agree with the way that immunity is granted and interpreted, but if you think about it, what LEOs do is looked at fundamentally differently than the actions of other people. Even a textbook arrest involves assaulting someone, kidnapping them, and locking them in a concrete box. If they were held to the same standard as you were, very basic portions of their job would become impossible. This extreme privilege is potentially upsetting, but it's the bargain that American society made to provide a deterrent to crime.    In this situation, it's hard to know exactly what Rose told others, because although he obviously broke the law it's possible that he bumped the situation into an immunity grey area even if it wasn't a legal grey area. His retirement takes away some of the incentive of the AG's office or the DA to go after him. I don't like it, I'm just trying to explain how it's possible for early stages of prosecution against an officer to be a total fucking mess because there's a lot of uncertain legal questions that makes it politically undesirable to pursue legal action. That's regrettable, but I'm at least glad that Rossi is lawyering up to keep this in the public eye and get the compensation she deserves.    Prosecutors and judges have more powerful versions of the same immunity, which is even more terrifying, IMO.    I have no idea if POST sees LEOs as ""their own,"" because the board is mostly cops but the staff is not,  But their function is basically to give training and to grant and revoke licenses so that you can't just leave a job and set up shop down the road as you described. It's a very imperfect system, because there are times when someone does enough to get fired but not enough to get revoked, but I think it's a helpful check.       If you want an illustrated rundown of how qualified immunity works, here's a handy comic that gives pretty good detail, and some relevant SCOTUS cases on the matter.    http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/07/14/what-is-qualified-immunity-and-how-does-it-work/      And here are the biggest cases that helped define qualified immunity, if you're even more interested in how it works:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivens_v._Six_Unknown_Named_Agents  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_v._Fitzgerald  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saucier_v._Katz"

A little research shows that average yearly rain for Mesa is 9.5 inches.  Cum rain to date is 4.28 inches this year and we haven't even gotten to monsoon season yet.  Salt River should be fine.

phoenix,3d786a,0oiiiiio0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:29:53 2015 UTC,Good advice! I went last month but we were on a massive float/raft that should have never been on a river. We spent the whole time padding and I (who cannot swim) fell out several times lmao. Luckily I can float with purpose and did not die. I'll be going with my cousin and maybe his friends.
phoenix,3d786a,amperx11,5,Tue Jul 14 02:54:38 2015 UTC,"The flows seem to be a little higher than than this time last month (800ish cfs vs last month in 600s) so they water should be flowing faster.  If you cannot swim, a life vest is a must. I think there have been 2 deaths in the last month, it doesn't take much, even if you know how to swim.  If the flow is low I would recommend doing 2 point 2 trips, the rapids were hell a month ago with the really low flow. 800-900 is prob the best minimum on the rapid area. It took about 7 hours hours from point 1 to pick up at the low flow, high SPF every 15 minutes and still burned.  As always bring a designated driver and collect any trash you see floating along the way!"

Most of the time the release is based off usage with expected Farm needs usually the bulk of it. So best to compare day over day as well as the same day the week before to have an idea.  Notice the float trips page ( http://www.saltrivertubing.com/float-trips/ ) shows 'based on 1,000 cfs' and I think it only hit that level 1 day so far. Usually only be at that level or above if it's raining upstream and room needs to be made in the lakes."

Sorry if that's vague - I work in a school that trains CNAs, so I try to keep up with what folks get paid, but I don't have a lot of contact with hospitals and nicer long-term care facilities. Mostly just agencies.   Check licensing requirements between states, btw. AZ is fairly strict in their requirements, and you want to be able to plan ahead."
phoenix,3d7z0v,jadefirefly,2,Tue Jul 14 06:08:02 2015 UTC,Would I be better served getting a clerical position in a hospital?  I really just need the patient contact time as I pursue my PA at ASU.  Being a CNA is just a means to an end as I continue in the field.  Any info on that would be appreciated and thank you for responding :).
phoenix,3d7z0v,jadefirefly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:42:03 2015 UTC,"That, I can't really say for sure. I don't know that a clerical position would pay much, unless you've got a decent background in it; most entry-level clerical around here is probably going to pay 10-11.   As an example, I know I'm underpaid for what I do. But I am essentially an office manager, in the sense that I am the front office of this place. I do enrollments, payments, collections, student services, inventory, etc. I'm salaried at 20,800, which is basically just a salaried 10/hr. But I didn't have the greatest leverage to argue for more, as my entire resume before this was retail.   If you're looking to score a reasonable pay rate and the necessary contact hours, CNA may be a better choice. But on the other hand, clerical is probably easier and there's less poo involved. :P"
phoenix,3d7z0v,Internetologist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"CNA is dirty work, but it's definitely something you should stick with.

This stupid trend needs to stop, somehow it makes feel good inside. At McDonald's there could be a car full of morbidly obese people with their children next.  It'd be interesting to know if this was happening at the drive through I was at and order $30 worth of food to see if the person in front would pay for it. If they did, I'd give everything but my sandwich out to some homeless people, if not I would just cancel my order at the window and continue on my way."

phoenix,3d65dv,kirinaz,9,Mon Jul 13 20:46:57 2015 UTC,"Netflix and a pair of bunny ears. OTA TV is all digital now, so it looks as good as cable, and you'll get CBS, PBS, 3TV, FOX, NBC, ABC, UPN, and WB for $0/mo.   The FireTV Stick is $40 and gets you Amazon Prime Instant video, Netflix, YouTube, and if you're the tinkering type, you can install Kodi. There's the full-fledged Fire TV for $100 if you want something with more hardware (same capabilities, just faster/smoother). The Chromecast ($30 at Best Buy, often on sale for $20) lets you play a ton of content from your phone to your TV (Netflix, Youtube, Google Play, Google Music, MLB TV, HBO Go, tons of others). If you have a smartphone, this is easily the most cost-effective option, and it's cool because if your friend comes over and he's already rented a movie on his account, he can cast from his phone to your TV without any fuss. The Nexus Player at $70 another solid alternative, and will support Google Play content in addition to Amazon/Netflix/YouTube. You can run a lot of Android apps on it, and it has controller support for games, which is fun. It has all the capabilities of the Chromecast as well, and should support Kodi. AppleTV at $70 if you buy a lot of iTunes content already The Roku 3 ($100) is less tinkerable but comes with a buttload of content channels out of the gate and like the Nexus Player, is built for playing games on, too. This is the one that most people who don't want to tinker with their device seem to prefer. If you absolutely must have ESPN, check out SlingTV (linked elsewhere in the thread). You'll need one of the above devices to use it. Note that many sporting events air on OTA TV already.   My wife and I cut out cable in 2006 and we haven't missed it. The rates that the cable/dish providers want to for TV is utter insanity."

phoenix,3d588c,B_Witt,3,Mon Jul 13 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, when it comes to major cross streets Phoenix was rather wise in the name/numbering scheme that was used.  Hope the below information is useful to some or a few. Let me know if I made any mistakes.   West of Central,  lanes and avenues are odd numbered. East of Central,  streets and drives are even numbered.   This applies to most roads and major intersections.  Street Numbers  North and South bound roads use numbers that are    even = West side of the road odd = East side of the road   East and west bound roads use numbers that are   even = North side of the road odd =  South side of the road   Additionally, there are a couple of roads that have name changes.  *Glendale avenue is one of those, east of the 51 HWY (21st) it turns into Lincoln Drive.  *Olive turns into Dunlap at 43 rd ave.  *Thunderbird into Cactus at Cave Creek. Keep in mind that west of 19 ave, Cactus and Thunderbird are two separate roads, Cactus one mile south of Thunderbird and ends at 19th ave."
phoenix,3d588c,justicedevil,3,Mon Jul 13 19:57:22 2015 UTC,"All major odd numbered streets are avenues while all evens are ""streets"" with the exception of 7th st. That's how you know if one means avenue or street if they say the major intersection number without specifying."
phoenix,3d588c,tylerrelytyler,2,Mon Jul 13 20:09:09 2015 UTC,Never realized the coincidence. .. still is helpful to specify for when talking about the higher numbered roads since they literally can be on opposite sides of town

There are a few decent strip malls with places like Buffalo Wild Wings and Zipps. You can definitely watch a game and get decent food at these places,  but you'd probably have more fun going somewhere where yup can actually meet up with someone. There's a dive bar called Stackers that is close too and I remember them having great wings, but it is a true dive bar.  I honestly can't think of much more right now and it is bothering me.

In this case he actually seems to be complimenting the City of Glendale for standing up to the Coyotes, while making fun of a particular fan. And he goes after almost every major city in American with a stadium here, so it's not like we're a standout. Any while I love Oliver, this is an old topic that comes up constantly. Not exactly his most original piece.  Also, the AZ mention OP was too lazy to link to directly is at 13:58. Shame."

Much like the Cardinals, Glendale made a lot of promises it is having a hard time backing up. I'm not sure how this is ""standing-up"" for themselves. If anything, this is them backpedaling."
phoenix,3d3vw0,Icebot,-5,Mon Jul 13 22:03:44 2015 UTC,Don't be daft. Glendale citizens raised money to tase  their mayor for a stadium. What a joke!!!
phoenix,3d3vw0,victorysbite,12,Mon Jul 13 13:07:42 2015 UTC,"The mayor was participating in a charity drive, like when officials go into a dunk tank or whatever. It wasn't set up to be about the stadium originally. The fans just donated enough money for this woman to do it. Silly, sure, but a lot of money went to charity for it and officials do stuff like this a lot.  And yes, you're supposed to call out ""taser"" three times, like the woman did in the video. Oliver makes fun of that, too. He heightens things for laughs and dramatic effect."
phoenix,3d3vw0,jmoriarty,3,Mon Jul 13 13:25:53 2015 UTC,The charity was the 100 Club - a group that supports the surviving family when a law enforcement official loses his/her life in the line of duty.

They made a competitive bid and won, now they are having a difficult time backing up those promises. Much like some of the issues they are currently having with the Cardinals stadium.  Who gives a shit if the business is in the red, they've made the playoffs they are not a terrible team and they've been holding up their bargain of maintaining the stadium, the reason they are in the red is because they cannot sell tickets. They cannot sell tickets because the stadium is in a shitty part of town that Glendale has made no attempt to rectify through mass transit options.  Edit  Loved the personal attack there at the end...classy."
phoenix,3d3vw0,Icebot,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:06:38 2015 UTC,"Who said I wanted to be classy? I'm originally from Phoenix, after all.   Obviously the citizens of Glendale don't want hockey, so fuck it. Taxpayers shouldn't be forced to subsidize a failing business, simple as that. If they want to play hockey in the state, let them pay for it. Find some ways to not be one of the lowest average attendances in the NHL, or raise ticket prices, or leave. 99% of the state wouldn't notice."
phoenix,3d3vw0,djreluctant,2,Mon Jul 13 22:33:06 2015 UTC,"I lived in Tucson for 2 years, so your backhanded comment means nothing to me, I can think of tons of reasons Phoenix sucks and tons of reasons Tucson sucks. You just sound like a terrible person all around so I'll chalk it up to that.  They had a contractual obligation that they are now renegging on, and it's not even because the Coyotes did anything wrong, they've managed the stadium fine and increased revenue year to year. The problem is, no one wants to go to Glendale to watch hockey. It's not the team, it's the terrible city and location. As I mentioned in my comment, they are having issues with the Cardinals stadium deals they signed up for, however the Cardinals are extremely popular, American Football in general, so they are less polarized.   Find some ways to not be one of the lowest average attendances in the NHL, or raise ticket prices, or leave. 99% of the state wouldn't notice.   Roughly 20% of the East Valley + Phoenix population attended games last year, while they are not unique ticket sales, that is how many tickets were sold last year. Likewise, the Phoenix Suns which are considered a popular team, in both the NBA and our city only average around 3,000 more people a game.  With a fresh new location that has mass transit options, they could easily surpass that number."

I have gotten really far in life by being this way. Thank you for recognizing that, I've done quite well socially and professionally.  I hope the East Valley hosts it and I hope Jobbing.com Arena is vacant and they end up selling it. I'd rather they stay here than go out of state. Sorry you don't like hockey, but then again I doubt you drive up here for any sports, so your opinion doesn't really mean shit."

phoenix,3d3vw0,Face_Plont,0,Mon Jul 13 22:15:28 2015 UTC,"It's not bailing them out, it's an agreement to maintain the facilities, which they are doing. However, the income is not what Glendale expected (lower than anticipated obviously), which is not really the Coyotes fault but the shitty marketing for that Arena and the terrible location. They are backing out of an agreement, which is a shitty thing to do, but whatever let's say they do it and the Coyotes move to Phoenix, Vegas or Seattle/Portland.   What does the city do then? Do they hire an outside company to manage the facility? It seems like they have issue with contracts and bidding, so they'll probably choose the lowest bidder. Which will then set in motion crappy mismanagement of the facility which will eventually end with it closing, then that will be some awesome financial decision making.  Slippery Slope but whatever."

He noticed the bagels sold a lot in the morning and the juice sold better in the afternoon. He did a test to run a Jamba counter in his bagel place and it worked well. He passed on this info to the higher ups and now they are doing some official pilots of both officially together. Basically, by combining them you have half as much rent to pay and you increase brand awareness for both.   If the Bruegger's here are all franchises, then the owner might have been following this and decided to take the leap before all of the official pilot testing is done.   I don't know for sure though."

phoenix,3d4ve9,ADMSackbar,4,Mon Jul 13 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm not a lawyer, this is not legal advice.  But I have done something similar in the past.  The laws for selling stuff on the street or at an event are tricky. This may or may not help  You could get a street vendors license, but you are not supposed to be on the sidewalk. This seems to most closely match what you're doing.   You can get a temporary business license, I think they sell a three day license or something like that.   Be aware that you'll need both a city and a state license, and you'll have to file with both entities separately. I'm not sure if the state offers the three day licenses, but a lot of cities do. I don't think that the state licensing is as specific.   Or, you could just go out and do it and hope for the best. Odds are, nothing will bad happen. You're only doing this for one or two days, right? In my experience, the penalties that you'll get from city/state are very slap-on-the-wrist.... tens or hundreds of dollars, not thousands. I filed for my license a month after I started doing business (I had a state license, didn't realize I needed a city license too).. the fee was something like $50.  If you're from out of state, there are some weird nexus rules- basically, if your company doesn't have a significant presence, you don't really need a license, but what constitutes nexus is murky at best. My understanding is that the law is written so traveling salesmen don't need a license for every single state.  As I said, not a lawyer. It's been a while since I researched this stuff, and half of it isn't completely clear to me, as it was made up by lizard people :)"

I called the city about permits and it seems like the street vendor one won't work for me. It'll take too long and require the state/city business licences.  I don't have those because I'm just an out of work graphic designer doing lots of little side gigs.  I was hoping I could just sell enough shirts to pay my way to Phoenix to check it out and donate a good chunk to Bernie. I'm still going to check into the 3 day permit(she gave me a different phone number) but I fear I need the same city and state licences.  Might just walk up and down the line and sell them out of a backpack.  Anyways, thank you and I'll keep digging around.  Glad you're not a lizard person!"
phoenix,3d4ve9,802bikeguy_com,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:32:15 2015 UTC,Contact the city's tax and licensing dept to inquire. I do know there's one water vendor that works on donations only so he doesn't have to get a license. My guess is that without a license you'll be at risk for a citation.

Also, I haven't used it at all but just quickly looking at it now, apartments.com might be pretty good.  It's been pretty heavily advertised here in the valley recently, so you might have better luck with it as compared to other sites.  Craigslist isn't an awful idea either."
phoenix,3czx7y,dannymb87,2,Sun Jul 12 12:19:13 2015 UTC,"There are some rare instances where you don't need a car but they're like one in a million.

phoenix,3czx7y,austinmiles,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:14:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendations. I'll check em out.
phoenix,3czx7y,austinmiles,4,Sun Jul 12 15:58:44 2015 UTC,"As far as public transportation goes--you could probably make it work as long as you don't have to work past 9 pm. I don't believe any buses go directly to the Mayo clinic, but if you ride a bike, they've got bike racks on the buses so you could use a combo of bike/bus. Check out valleymetro.org for the schedules.  As far as finding a place close to work...North Scottsdale is going to be expensive as fuck. I would recommend finding something in South Scottsdale, around the McDowell Rd. / Scottsdale Rd. area."
phoenix,3czx7y,AstroZombie138,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:49:35 2015 UTC,"This area is very big. Get a car. I don't know which campus you are going to be at but if it's the main hospital it's not really in what you would normally consider Scottsdale. Its sort of North Phoenix. You might look for a place somewhere nearby the US51. It will get you sort of equidistant to Mayo, Central Phoenix, and DT scottsdale.   We have public transport along main arteries, and the bus system covers most of the valley. The busses can be sort of a hassle and eat up a lot of your day. Scottsdale has not been public transport friendly. The city officials have stated that they believe that public transport brings in unsavory characters.   So much transportation is 10+ miles especially getting to Mayo. Uber is not really an option."
phoenix,3czx7y,NewAgeNeoHipster,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:17:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured it would be something like that. Thanks for the info....I'll look into buying something second hand or leasing or something. Not sure how stuff works if I need a car for one year.  And I'm at the E Shea blvd campus.
phoenix,3czx7y,Icanopen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:20:55 2015 UTC,"Ah ok. That area is pretty close to fountain hills. Its a really nice area. When looking for places. What are your interests? Fountain hills is probably more families and suburban life but there are some really good mountain bike and hiking trails up there. I was going to head up there this morning in fact.   If you are looking for something with a bit more nightlife, Downtown scottsdale isn't bad and is pretty accessible.   Generally driving 15 miles along the freeways isn't abnormal and usually doesn't take more than 20 min unless you are driving with traffic during rush hour."
phoenix,3czx7y,IONTOP,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:55:00 2015 UTC,You're going to need a car unless you are going to rent something in the neighborhoods just north of the Mayo clinic.  If you want a 1 or 2bdrm then apartments.com works.  If you want a 2 or 3+ bdrom then look at realtor.com because you will probably be renting a house.  Craigslist also has some listings.  Also check out fountain hills which Mayo is pretty much on the boarder of.
phoenix,3czx7y,ItsHotInPhoenix,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:15:13 2015 UTC,"Broadstone Ancala (now owned by the Tipton group) is a nice complex Franks on Shea is also pretty nice if you get one of the upgraded units. Not sure what your budget is but they have single rooms and it's very close to the Mayo campus on Shea.  You could even bike to work from there, but I still recommend a car if you want to go do anything else."

As long as you say ""hey, I'm new here absolutely love the city so far."" Etc. They will flock to you wanting to know why you love it, where you've been.  Stay away from corporate places.  Not a lot of locals go to those places.  Best advice is go to somewhere about where you live and ask a bartender ""where do locals hang out, I just moved here and want to meet people who live around me.""  I used to bartend at hard times clarendon.  I hated yuppies, Phoenix is kind of anti yuppie, and more hipster, but we hate them too.  But hipsters are cooler than yuppies here.  For me, best value to convenience is south Scottsdale.  About a mile away from the highway, far enough from asu where they don't come up here and far enough from old town where they don't come here either.  To me south Scottsdale would be like ballston maybe.  Possibly east falls church."

Then my own father called him a ""business man who will know how to 'run' this country "" He is a terrible person and has filed for bankruptcy 4x's! And that probably was good business FOR HIMSELF!  But no he's not a serious candidate, people are just seriously jaded and confused about their party reps. Maybe all the interest in him is genuine, but it's not long lasting.

phoenix,3cwfo9,squintychino,4,Sat Jul 11 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. But I also think in the long run Trumps campaign probably won't succeed because even moderate republicans won't pander to the extreme right base because , while it's fine when the candidate  field is so full,  its divisive for their party as well, when the more moderate republicans have to look like they take the extreme  rhetoric seriously.

All I can say is good luck with that...  Also, there's a beach ball going around so that's fun. It's a bit on the geriatric side here, not surprisingly. The protesters were scary angry though, I really don't like being in the middle of a controversy and as said it's crazy crowded so I'm on the verge of regretting coming. What I thought would be an afternoon amusement turned into something scary big. I just hope neither side murders me. :)"

phoenix,3cwfo9,davidzilla12345,3,Sat Jul 11 11:03:43 2015 UTC,"Most definitely for political reasons. People see him as a good business man who doesn't take shit from anyone. With how the Republican party doesn't have a unified voice, dealing with splinter groups trying to sabotage the federal government or their fellow Republicans, Trump seems like a knight in shining armor. A way to bring back that glory.  For instance, Reince Priebus recently contacted Trump, because the GOP has been trying to reformulate their words to make a message that would inspire latinos. This rubs a lot of conservatives the wrong way as it seems like overreaching doublespeak, or bootlicking towards some establishment. Conservatives want to speak their mind freely and loudly, and the current establishment comes across as cowering to the demands of liberals.  I'm not a Republican, but this is definitely what I've noticed. I think if a Republican came along that had Trumps arrogance and confidence, but had a more tolerant message, the GOP would be all over that person. Really I think it's more in the deliverance than the actual politics, but this gets confused when people want to defend their candidate (so they defend the ideas wholeheartedly as well)."

First, having a green yard is going to be costly. The soil quality in Laveen is bad. There is a lot of sand, which is great for succulents, but tough for grass. If you want to forget ahead, you'll want to test the soils alkalinity and composition. The soil is also very fine, which may pack hard after a while. And not a lot of organic matter. You man need to truck out some soil then truck in some good stuff.   The next thing you're going to worry about: sun and heat. I'm not aware if grass grows in a cycle like flowers, but it may be hard to grow it last spring. Lying sod is something you mentioned. My buddy has a house with nice grass that was sod. I know grass can grow here, but he has automatic drip systems front and back, and had work done prior to get the sod to at least live.   Your dislike of succulents is misplaced. There are some really great colored plants you can pick up that will thrive in this climate. You'll have to understand that not everything will grow here. A quick search will show you many awesome succulents. I'd advise you in this direction for monetary reasons. You can get stuff to grow here. But if you're not experienced, you may just lose money.   Try searching for plants that will grow in our plant hardiness zone and work from there. Good luck."
phoenix,3cwjhl,Anthaneezy,2,Sat Jul 11 13:16:35 2015 UTC,"We are about to lay sod. Planting seed is okay, but you will need to plant straight Bermuda grass. Bermuda grass grows like a weed and basically is a weed (complete with allergies). Sod does not produce seeds or allergens in most cases. It grows well and is a hybrid Bermuda grass.  Because of the temperature here, Bermuda grass only grows during the warm months. Come late October, no matter how much water and fertilizer you give it, it will turn brown and stop growing. It basically hibernates for the winter (goes dormant).   When Bermuda grass goes dormant, most people who like to have a green lawn will overseed with rye grass seed and maybe some fertilizer. It will grow well and you will have a gorgeous green grass all winter. Rye grass can't survive in the heat, so come April, it will die off completely. The good news is by then, Bermuda grass will be awake and growing again and turning green.  So if you want a green lawn year round, there is maintenance to do. If you don't care or don't know (like most people) you can do nothing during the winter and never have to mow your lawn from December until April."
phoenix,3cwjhl,pyr0t3chnician,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:46:13 2015 UTC,"Grass will grow better from bermuda sod. I figure that it's not more expensive than preparing, seeding,  and watering soil. You can  this project in the cool months and the sod will come overseeded with rye so you'll have a winter lawn. You don't have to grow it every year, if you don't want to.   With a design like yours, curbing would be good to divide it up. You can get extruded concrete curbing put down for something like $300 per linear foot. The prep work would be to level the areas that will get curbing. After, you'd fill it in with topsoil and/or rock."

Again, not for ""heavy"" traffic, but I have four large dogs and Sahara seems to do OK.  Another option would be fake grass. You'll save on water, the dogs won't kill it, and so forth."

He was someone's pet that had gotten loose. Not chipped, but neutered, loving and sweet. He recently took Ill and my vet diagnosed him with diabetes, but otherwise healthy. No FIV or leukemia or other health issues. I have been treating him with insulin 2 times a day and changed his diet. But because he is outdoors and has other food available at a neighbors who leaves poor quality food out open dish, this is a problem. I recently took early retirement due to my own severe health issues and am on a limited income. Which is why I am unable to bring him indoors. I have serious medical bills of my own that I can barely keep up with. I struggle daily to get him to come on time fer his injection. He is feeling better after almost 3 weeks of special care and has gotten wiser! I fear he will become more difficult to care for outdoors as he is not responding with food as bait at injection times. I am making a plea to this community to please help me help Simon. I am willing to help with food and insulin as best I can. He really needs to be brought inside ASAP to get the regular care he needs to stay alive and well. We live in hot Phx AZ and the heat is not helping at all.

I live a little bit north of there, and my brother has been registering into their school districts for several years, because of the quality of education. It's a really nice blend of urban life and family neighborhood. I would recommend that area, as it is very diverse and not full of crazy far-right conservatives like many of the other areas. That being said, I've lived here my entire life, and never perceived any serious racial divide, and that's not because I turn a blind eye. I'm a Pheonician, born and raised, and my social surroundings have always been evenly caucasian and hispanic, with other groups mixed in, with racial tensions just above zero.

Downtown (where Majerle's Sports Grill is) has the most amount of social activities, but there's not much of anything else. Phoenix (compared to most other cities, especially European) is very young, and we haven't developed much of a social culture. Others may correct me, but compared to NYC or LA, there isn't as much to do here.  We do however have a pretty good sports community. If you come, I do encourage you to see your beloved Suns, but also try to see a Diamondbacks (Baseball, their stadium is near where the Suns play) or a Cardinals (American Football, their stadium is on the west side of town) game, depending on when you visit.  Also, if you visit I encourage you to see other beautiful places our state has to offer, like The Grand Canyon or Sedona!  And finally, if you end up staying, you'll likely have to get a job as a barber. My wife is Russian, and about 90% of her relatives are barbers ;)"

Phoenix, though, is very spread out. Access to natural things is so easy. Many are right in the middle! Wanna hike? A few miles in any direction, you're there.  But everything else? We got it too.

Law enforcement in this town (mostly due to Maricopa County Sheriff's Office) is pretty racist, and the top cop in the county is a known white supremacist who openly cavorts with neo-Nazis. Something I've heard pretty often is ""if you look brown, you're going downtown"", meaning if you look to be Hispanic, African, etc. then you run a far higher risk of being arrested and imprisoned on any charge - or sometimes for no charges at all. Cops here can hold you for, what, 72 hours without being charged?

phoenix,3co798,GuatemalnGrnade,0,Sat Jul 11 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"Depending on which city you're in Phoenix may seem small and there aren't tons of tall buildings like NYC or Chicago.   The summer is probably like your winter, meaning that people stay inside.   US Airways(Talking Stick, whatever it will be called from now on) usually has a couple homeless people begging which is not really what you want to see when going to a game.   Those are my only complaints. Otherwise it's pretty great."

phoenix,3cqb4k,The_Juzzo,13,Thu Jul 9 23:27:10 2015 UTC,"Ok, so since you're not driving you'll want to stay within a 15 minute walk or bus ride.   With that in mind, think of ten places that you think are well run and make a list. You might have noticed if the employees aren't miserable, or if you just have a good feel about the place.  I wouldn't worry about a resume. Go down the list, call them and say you're interested in a part time job. Ask who the hiring manager is and if you could speak to them or leave a message. If they tell you to come fill out an application, go do that.  That's all there is to it. If you're invited to an interview, wear clean clothes, show up on time, and bring water and something to take notes with.   If you put in an application, always follow up with a phone call or e-mail a week later.  I'm not familiar with that stretch of town so I don't have any recommendations besides in-n-out"
phoenix,3cqb4k,Evilution602,2,Fri Jul 10 00:03:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, I live right there too.  If you had asked before summer started, I probably could have gotten you on where I work as an intern. (Big company, lots of areas to choose from)  Next year, if you remember, get in touch with me a month or so before summer starts if interested. You live right by me, ride would be included."

phoenix,3cqb4k,pancakesouffle,2,Fri Jul 10 20:16:52 2015 UTC,My first job at 15 was a Mrs Fields Cookies at PV mall. At 15 your best bet is probably a job at the mall or maybe as a host at a restaurant?
phoenix,3coscp,darthgarlic,4,Thu Jul 9 15:51:58 2015 UTC,So instead of selling desserts made by other people at their restaurant they will be selling desserts made by other people at their wholesale.
phoenix,3coscp,darthgarlic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:26:37 2015 UTC,They're probably just downsizing whatever front they've been running all this time. I'm sure whatever novelty value they had has long since dried up and Scottsdale business rent ain't cheap... so they're moving whatever shady thing they actually do into Samy's garage.
phoenix,3coscp,Mikeaz123,2,Thu Jul 9 23:16:17 2015 UTC,Laundering money for Sam as far as I remember.

phoenix,3crdyw,toodarnloud88,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:42:46 2015 UTC,Most colleges make you take the last 60 hours of a program with them. Don't know the exact details for the schools out here.
phoenix,3crdyw,jtj313,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on a couple of things. What cost do you want? What kind of business degree do you want? What kind of job do you want after the degree?  Honestly, your best choices are ASU, UofA, and Grand Canyon (though, I'd go for one of the first two instead)."
