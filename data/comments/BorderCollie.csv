BorderCollie,3dyuy6,Anduril1123,3,Mon Jul 20 19:04:32 2015 UTC,My BC loves wearing shirts and jackets. It's a privilege to her. If we go to the dog park and she is wearing something she flaunts it in front of the other dogs. It's absolutely hilarious and utterly adorable!
BorderCollie,3dwqs2,beenfalcon,19,Mon Jul 20 04:18:25 2015 UTC,"Growing up in a house full of dogs was always part of my life. From the time I was three we always had at least one. The one main thing that I take from my time with dogs is that they all have their own personalities, and they are all lovely.   The first Border to come into my life was Lacey, an exuberant and arrogant girl. She was a lot of fun, very headstrong and an absolute fighter. At an early age she was diagnosed with a thyroid issue that meant she would need daily medication each day until she died. We were also told that as a result she wouldn’t live as long as she could have.   After a year or so, the breeder that we had bought Lacey from had decided she was done breeding with her mother, Woopie (who I can’t find any photos of) and that she wanted her to go to a good family where she can live the remainder of her life comfortably. Thus, we got our second dog.   Another year or so down the track, my parents decided that they wanted to have another litter of puppies with Woopie, and so we did. This is where we got David, our boy. When he was born we’d decided that we would keep him as we figured no one would want him due to his irregular markings. We were wrong, everyone that came to buy a puppy asked about him first, but we still kept him. Our brood was now at three.    Many years flew by of growing up with three dogs, Lacey forever being stubborn, Woopie trying to herd me away from loud noises like she would her own pups (I was quite young) and David following my dad around like a bad smell. They had good lives, competing and loving Agility where David once because the State Champion.   Woopie was diagnosed with cancer when she was 13, and unfortunately lost her fight after another 6 months. It was hard to say goodbye but it was the right thing to do, it would have been unfair to make her keep fighting. After a maybe two years without three, we decided we missed the clutter and so we decided to get another puppy. This is where Poppy came in.   Having a new puppy in the house was something we haven’t experienced in a long time. It was exhausting, entertaining and frustrating all wrapped up in one but we’d do it all again (and have). She seemed to breathe new life into the now old and lethargic Lacey and David. It was good to see them play again.   Through the years they all had their medical battles, both Lacey and David having each of their left and right cruciate ligaments repaired. But as they got older, the fights got harder. David developed a disorder called Degenerative Myelopathy, which causes paralysis of the back half. He was slowly losing control of his back end. A boy who could, in his youth, clear an entire queen bed from a standing start. David lost his fight in 2013, and it was hard.  With Lacey we’d always been told that she wouldn’t live as long as she could have due to her thyroid issue, but she was a fighter. Regular vet check-ups, daily tablets and many late night trips of carrying her to the bathroom because her joints were too cold kept her comfortably in the fight until she was a ripe 16 years of age. As always, it’s hard to lose a dog but she had a long, lovely life.   Now we have Poppy, and the recently adopted Annabel. They’re both happy and healthy and doing well.  In my 17 years growing up with dogs I couldn’t imagine my life any other way. Ultimately I feel that although it is hard to say goodbye to such a close friend, and knowing that one day you will have to can put people off getting a dog, a good dog owner should always own a dog. They may only be here for a portion of your life, but you are their life. It should be your mission to give as many dogs as you can a happy and healthy life."

The few awful rainy in the house days we've had we've done done lots of training sessions and some tug and play in the house and he's been fine. We usually have two crazy active days a week (trails, beach, fields, puppy play dates with friends) and one to two ""new thing"" days (walks downtown where it's busy, trips to dog friendly stores and restaurants or visits to friends houses) and he seems to do fine in between all that. I'm so glad the old farts telling me ""he needs fields and fields to run in"" didn't stop me from getting him. Yeah, he likes to run, but he gets much more wiped from thinking and training and meeting new people than even our long trail walks or open field time."

So really only one or two in case of emergency or just drank too much that day.  If he's playing and not listening on the bathroom breaks then he should be on the leash.  That way he can't get away, and with the leash on he'll know it's business."
BorderCollie,3cnpc3,intendingtoburn,2,Thu Jul 9 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"All dogs are different, but at that age I don't think yoshi needs to be out that often in the middle of the night. Once is enough (if even that). You should also, as mentioned, keep him on leash for middle of the night breaks to keep him from getting riled up and playing instead of doing his business.  You think he's mischievous now... Wait until he hits the adolescent months... ;)"
BorderCollie,3cnpc3,Glenndogg,2,Thu Jul 9 23:19:07 2015 UTC,"Now....the little turd is using the signal constantly   Sometimes what we think we are communicating to dogs, and what they are actually learning are two very different things. We think they're learning to use the signal to go outside but they've just realized that they can trick the human into going outside on command! Best day EVER!! My puppy did this with bells too.  If you want it to be a signal for going out to pee, and ONLY for that then you need to be very consistent about it. If puppers gives you the signal, take your puppy out on leash and make sure it's really boring. If the puppy wants to play instead of go pee, then just go back inside. As soon as your puppy goes pee, then play!  Be super strict about this, and you'll soon get the point across that going outside via that signal is only for going pee and not for playing.  At the same time make sure you take your puppy out lots to play - but make it on your terms and not on your puppy's.   I caught him pulling a tomato pot down from the table and starting to destroy the plant after I finished up training and our walk a bit early one day   He's not just a border collie but also a puppy. Puppies are endlessly curious and want to try to chew on everything, that's just normal. Try to puppy proof your house as much as possible and if you can't supervise your puppy then either use a crate or gate your puppy into a puppy proof area. Try to make sure you set your puppy up for success!   what about food-aggression with other dogs, trying to steal food or treats from other dogs after he is finished with his   Manage this! Don't put them in a situation where he can steal and get away with it. He's a puppy - he doesn't understand not to steal, especially if he gets what he wants. You need to manage it and be sure to give your older dogs breaks from the puppy. Puppies to older dogs are like screaming toddlers to us, they're cute and all but after awhile they get really annoying."
BorderCollie,3cnpc3,aveldina,2,Fri Jul 10 04:41:53 2015 UTC,"I may be able to help with your food aggression problem. I have an 8-month old that is just terrible about it at times. How do you do feeding time? Do you feed him separately from your other dogs? Is it several times a day?   I feed mine 2 times a day. I started putting my hand in his bowl before I would let him eat. It was a bit of a dominance thing (""alpha"" gets to eat your food before you do). It helped him slow down. Also, when I give him treats, I pretend to take a bite first. Then I make him sit and tell him ""easy"" so he doesn't gobble it. And as far as stealing food from other dogs, I make him sit and stay as I feed the other dog and then him. (Grant it, that may be a bit much at 4 months old). But starting Yoshi at 4 months with this will help.    For not chewing, I would use Bitter Apple to spray on all my furniture and things he couldn't chew and then leave his toys out for him to chew so he eventually learned what was ok to chew and what wasn't.  Hope this helps! Feel free to PM me if you want some more advice. I've raised 3 different BCs and they are all different in personality. But our little ones sound pretty similar. :)"
BorderCollie,3cjt2j,bas2b2,2,Wed Jul 8 13:43:44 2015 UTC,Great photo! Are the show-bred dogs not as incapable as they are over here? Does Chuck have much drive?
BorderCollie,3cjt2j,JaderBug12,2,Thu Jul 9 22:24:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks!.  I'm not sure how they are over there, I've never been to the US (apart from a layover at Atlanta airport). But going by what I read it's about the same here, perhaps a bit better.  Where I used to train, the Dutch show champion also trained with sheep. She wasn't brilliant, but there was still some instinct. Then again, she wasn't any worse than Mac, who is from a work line, just not a very good one. Chuck was much better. Not especially eager at first, but after a minute it went well. He was very relaxed and seemed to be in control, as much as expected from a 16 month old dog that is with the sheep for the first time.   Then again, Chip had a brief bout with the sheep as well. He's a pleasure to watch :)"

BorderCollie,3c891u,SaucyPaws,3,Sun Jul 5 20:46:47 2015 UTC,"It is a bit of a generalisation to label the entire breed as prone to having seizures. However, there are many breeders who have unscrupulously bred dogs from lines with known cases of epilepsy. Where is your boy from? If he's from a breeder, contact them and inform them that he has had a seizure and try to find out if there's been any family history. It is entirely possible that it's a one-off, but it is also possible that the line had epileptic dogs in the past.  Sorry to hear you and your dog went through this. Epilepsy is manageable when you find the right dosage of medication!"
BorderCollie,3c891u,potato_is_meat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:44:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry for a late reply. My boy has seizures every so often. Mehr one or two a year. His vet checked him out as a puppy, gave him clear health other than the seizures and he's now 11 going on 12 and healthy as he's ever been other then that.   I do think it's just a thing that the breed is prone to. None of his sisters or brothers had that issue, but the line definitely won't be bred further- my sister owns the mother and we had a good relationship with the breeder/stud owner. Irresponsible breeding probably wasn't a factor."

BorderCollie,3c6z7v,abycatgrl,2,Mon Jul 6 00:51:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the honest answer. My guy doesn't seem to be eating anything that he shouldn't, like even when he chews on sticks or bushes it's all about the chewing and there's no actual eating. I get being careful but I really want to make sure he has a million healthy, interesting, non destructive ways to get his fix before the real teething sets in."
BorderCollie,3c6z7v,abycatgrl,2,Mon Jul 6 01:07:57 2015 UTC,"I hear that! My boy only chewed one sandal, he's a quick study. You know your dog best so go with whatever works for y'all. Teething is rough"
BorderCollie,3c6z7v,potato_is_meat,2,Mon Jul 6 01:17:14 2015 UTC,"During teething, people have mentioned that soaking a rag in water and freezing it over can provide a ""pupsicle"" for him to chew, that has the added benefit of slightly numbing his sore and itchy spots where teeth are coming in.  My girl is also very good about not ingesting inedible chews (like a twig or stick) and she is the type of chewer that just grinds down in a steady pattern, so she's never concerned me w.r.t. rawhide chews. I have never been outspoken against them, since I use them myself and it would be hypocritical. I think if you know your dog and monitor them (I never leave my dog with a chew of any sort) they are decent."
BorderCollie,3c6z7v,abycatgrl,3,Mon Jul 6 13:34:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've yet to try this but I should soon. He loves the frozen peanut butter kong and loves pulling his crate towels around with his mouth so I think he'd be into the ""pupsicle"""

BorderCollie,3c4yrd,doghumper,2,Sun Jul 5 03:16:12 2015 UTC,also correct! I drive with them a lot so I want them to be as secure as they can be.
BorderCollie,3c4yrd,aveldina,3,Sun Jul 5 06:31:55 2015 UTC,"It takes surprisingly little for the back hatch of a car to fling open during an accident if someone rear ends you, and you really want an extra level of protection for your dog so it doesn't fall out and run around panicking in traffic... Similarly, if you front collide with someone you want to prevent a loose dog from being launched from the back of the car to the front, killing both the passengers and the dog in the process. I cringe whenever I see someone driving with an unsecured dog, because car crashes happen :(  I've got a similar crate from mim.se and it's been awesome. Weighs a ton, tethered to the car at four corners, completely silent while driving and has almost no wear after five years! My dog loves it too, she quickly falls asleep inside it once we start driving."
BorderCollie,3c4yrd,camst8,4,Sun Jul 5 07:58:41 2015 UTC,"Modern vehicle hatches/trunks are designed to collapse in a collision. They are made to protect the occupants of the vehicle, not the contents of the hatch/trunk.  These kennels crumple in a predictable way and are designed to save the lives of the animals inside in a crash. They're really expensive but I've heard good things about them! Sadly I know of more than one dog whose life has been lost to a vehicle collision. :("
BorderCollie,3c4yrd,doghumper,3,Sun Jul 5 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe to allow them to leave the dogs in the car for a period of time with the back door open, but otherwise secure. Best I can come up with."
BorderCollie,3c4yrd,potato_is_meat,3,Sun Jul 5 01:10:07 2015 UTC,Yeah you can do this but I'm too paranoid to leave my dog in the car with the hatch open in the summer even with the crate locked. What if some dog hating asshole closes the back hatch while I'm not there?

Once he begins to chase, allow him to run full-bore and once he hits the end of the line, yank his ass back as hard as you can. All the better if his feet go flying up in the air. I wouldn't necessarily yell at him at this point, he needs to think that the act of chasing the car is what did it. He needs to have a ""What the hell happened?!"" reaction. If the problem persists even with/after the yanking, I'd then add some yelling into the mix- make him think his world is going to end if he ever does that again. It needs to be a big deal.  I realize this isn't very 'nice'... but there's no wiggle room when it comes to chasing cars."
BorderCollie,3bxq78,JaderBug12,2,Fri Jul 3 13:57:50 2015 UTC,I'll try this. I was going to do it in the driveway and have someone circle a car in front of him.  Every time he pulls I would yank him back.    It's crazy though he doesn't even have to see a car to go crazy.  Just the noise of an out of sight car makes his ears perk up and he tries to run towards it.  And of course him having freakish strength doesn't help
BorderCollie,3bxq78,aveldina,3,Fri Jul 3 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"If you can, this is the kind of thing to get professional help with. This problem is not one you want to mess around with. I've met border collies surrendered to rescue after they were hit and the owner didn't want to pay thousands for surgery/rehab."
BorderCollie,3bxq78,DrPepperPete,2,Sat Jul 4 01:59:53 2015 UTC,"My BC used to do this with running, screaming children.  Tie your pup up with a long line (>15 feet) tethered to something secure and let him see a car go by.  He'll try to run after it and get jolted by running out of rope.  It shouldn't take too many repetitions of this to work."
BorderCollie,3bxq78,JaderBug12,2,Fri Jul 3 03:18:38 2015 UTC,he bit a tire once so then I took him out in the street and drove my car at him.   ...are you serious?!
BorderCollie,3bxq78,bobber18,-1,Fri Jul 3 03:18:21 2015 UTC,Yes I'm serious and he immediately learned to get it of the way of moving cars.  He died of old age at about 14.  Since he was an escape artist I'm sure this saved his life

BorderCollie,3bi8bq,potato_is_meat,9,Mon Jun 29 14:49:44 2015 UTC,"First two things that come to mind, different dogs.  Smart thing from my dog Pepper. Earlier this year we were at a small trial and a couple of the host's ducks got out of their pen. Hard to explain the pen situation but basically the ducks were out of the pen and walked through another fence that I had no way to get around quickly, but there was access to the other side all the way around a building. I sent Pepper all the way around, not knowing if she'd remember that she could go that way, which she did. Without being able to work directly with her, we worked together and she pushed the ducks back through the fence for me to catch and put back in the right pen. Kind of a silly little event but I was pretty proud of how well she handled it.  Dumb thing from my dog Jade. At one of her first trials, the sheep had gotten themselves into a corner of the arena, wouldn't move out. Sent Jade in to get them out, but instead she just kept walking straight in and holding pressure despite me telling her to let them go. One of the ewes was stomping and telling her to back off... eventually the ewe put her head down and head-butted toward Jade. Didn't touch her. Repeat: the ewe did not touch her. It must've spooked Jade or something... she took off, tail-tucked and screaming bloody murder running off all the way across the arena- everyone thought she had been hit hard and surely must've had broken bones or something. I just stood there with this ""WTF?!"" look on my face, ordered her to get back here and finish the job. Which we did, but it was embarrassing.  Jade also used to be terrified of fallen trees/logs when she was young."
BorderCollie,3bi8bq,JaderBug12,6,Mon Jun 29 13:15:03 2015 UTC,"Smartest: My late border collie learned to let herself outside at a young age and had been doing it for years, it was never a problem so I just rolled with it, however, one day I got a text from a neighbor that lived about 8 houses down the block from me saying that he saw my dog wandering around, and that she was heading back toward my house. About the same time I got the text, I heard her come through the back door of my house. I went to check the gate and it was closed, but not latched. I don't know for how long she had been doing this because she was smart enough to cover her tracks.   Dumbest: She started a fight with a pit bull/chocolate lab mix. Luckily, the other dog recognized, and was terrified of her intensity and rolled over on its back and didn't fight back."

Smartest thing was coordinated with his sister to take down an obnoxious lab at the park. The lab was running around bumping into people and dogs so Sister engages it in a game of chase, running a circle around my dog. He waited for an opening and ran straight for the lab, knocked it off it's feet. Sister and brother come trotting back to us side by side with huge grins on their faces.

One day, I was chasing her, switched directions, and waited for her to come around the corner to surprise her and I'm waiting there and she's not showing up and I turn around and she's just standing there behind me wagging her tail because she had switched things up and changed directions to surprise me.

BorderCollie,3b6ty8,ZoMgPwNaGe,3,Fri Jun 26 13:09:55 2015 UTC,What a great dog!!!  Had a hard day but seems happy with his work!
BorderCollie,3b6ty8,Silvercelt,3,Fri Jun 26 23:56:45 2015 UTC,Nice picture! I can only imagine how a border collie assists with cotton field irrigation.

BorderCollie,3b5fjz,SeguinPancakes,3,Fri Jun 26 03:01:17 2015 UTC,"Don't rush you have lots of time! It might be good to expose him to the bike itself (not moving) and make sure he has a very good experience with it (bring out the good treats). But focus on making sure every interaction is a positive one, and you'll have no problems in the long run."
BorderCollie,3b5fjz,aveldina,2,Fri Jun 26 03:48:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks! He's really good so far, not reactive at all and very curious. I definitely want to take advantage that now. He's been okay with kids zipping through the neighborhood on bikes and skateboards and stuff."
BorderCollie,3b5fjz,aveldina,2,Fri Jun 26 14:59:14 2015 UTC,You usually get some fear periods that come and go with puppies. So just keep an eye on things and definitely aim to have as many good experiences with anything new as possible.
BorderCollie,3b5fjz,Phill_Pickle,2,Fri Jun 26 15:29:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with her for sure, and I would also like to add to her advice-after the stage where he sees the bike without it moving....the next step for me was walking my girl on leash while I pushed the bike on the other side of me (dog on right, bike on left).  ...For me, she wasn't fazed at all, so after passing a few houses in my neighborhood, I hopped on the bike, and pushed off slowly, I just coasted without pedaling much at all....She didn't have to run, but she did willingly, so I also picked up my pace.... At that point, I started with my directional commands (which she already kinda knew from walking the neighborhood). Keep in mind though, that this was all a few weeks ago, and my girl is already 2, so I would definitely take it slower with a little puppy.  Just watch him, and let him tell you what he's comfortable with when it comes to actually walking/running next to the bike with you."
BorderCollie,3b5fjz,rubyloodo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:44:57 2015 UTC,"I say the earlier the better, obviously you know you can't be running your dog for a while, but it never hurts to introduce them to things at an early age!   We introduced our dog by putting the bike inside and rewarding her every time she approached it, with a treat and a ""yes!"".  We moved on to literally placing the treats on different parts of the bike (might be harder with a pup), and marking it with a ""yes!"" every time she took one.  She is very fearful by nature so we weren't sure how she would do and didn't want to scar her for life, so we moved very slowly. Next step was walking with her next to the bike, and we just moved up from there.  Now, she kills it when she's running alongside a bike!!  She's fast as hell so she loves it.  So, long story short, take it slow, you have lots of time.  When your pup is older, look into a WalkyDog bike leash.  They are awesome.  Good luck and congrats on your bc!"

BorderCollie,3azswe,potato_is_meat,3,Thu Jun 25 05:26:46 2015 UTC,I hope that's the case with Lucca. I'm just trying to really really not get complacent and to mentally anticipate a teenage terror so it can be nothing but relieved if he stays this good. He's my first dog ever so I'm new to all this.
BorderCollie,3azswe,bunnymeee,3,Thu Jun 25 17:09:55 2015 UTC,I know it seems obvious but take tonnes of photos and video at this age! They grow like weeds after the 10-12 wk mark. I was so busy training/monitoring my pup that I only have a handful of photos & vids. And I regret it! She was so adorably fluffy as a youngster.
BorderCollie,3azswe,dockingrockets,7,Thu Jun 25 13:35:31 2015 UTC,My boy has always been like this. He is 100% happy to just be laying next to my feet.

Mine absolutely loves laying around, all spread out across the couch with a chew toy. Of course she's all alert and ready for a run when I decide it's time, and goes nuts outside, but yeah, totally content just chilling out with mom and dad.  I'm glad it's worked out this way, you hear stories about border collies being these non-stop working dogs that constantly need stimulation or they act out... I'm not sure we could have handled that in hindsight! Love my super lazy girl."
BorderCollie,3azswe,bendydickcumonmybapz,3,Thu Jun 25 01:46:29 2015 UTC,Mine is exactly the same. She's currently napping on the balcony watching cars go by.

I expected to be hassled 24/7 for more and more exercise, but he's just happy being with me, whatever I'm doing. I've been sick the last week on top of studying for exams and I was really worried about how he'd be with less exercise than usual...he's been an angel. Happy to just sleep on my bed with me, but totally up and ready to run if that's whats on the cards. I'm so glad I ended up with a calm level headed boy that doesn't destroy everything when he occasionally gets less stimulation."
BorderCollie,3awte6,ireaditonredditsir,5,Wed Jun 24 03:24:43 2015 UTC,"If that's a puppy, our BC didn't get her full coat until about 8 months old, but her patchy look went away after about 6 months old. If the dog has blown it's coat and it's growing back, I'd guess a few weeks."
BorderCollie,3awte6,OGHamToast,2,Wed Jun 24 03:58:04 2015 UTC,He just turned 1. Never been trimmed. He looks so silly but I also love it.
BorderCollie,3awte6,OGHamToast,4,Wed Jun 24 04:05:13 2015 UTC,"I think our girl blew her coat around 14 or 15 months, but that coincided with her first heat cycle. Not sure if males blow their coats at similar times."
BorderCollie,3awte6,Shaggyninja,3,Wed Jun 24 04:12:35 2015 UTC,Cheers.  We frequent dogparks with numerous border collies and this guy is the only one with a coat that looked like this. Curious what the go is.
BorderCollie,3awte6,TacticalVulpix,2,Wed Jun 24 04:19:01 2015 UTC,Mine has a very small amount of toupee left at the base of her back (she's about to turn 1). But that's probably going away soon judging by the amount of hair on the couch :p
BorderCollie,3awte6,TacticalVulpix,3,Wed Jun 24 05:03:05 2015 UTC,"Mine had minimal toupee, but its disappeared mostly by her now 14months. Blew her coat about a month ago to prepare for winter."

BorderCollie,3awte6,TacticalVulpix,3,Wed Jun 24 16:10:20 2015 UTC,A step ahead in putting fur EVERYWHERE. Before her I'd never had a dog that sheds. I had a Bichon when I lived with my parents. His shedding was when I gave him a clip. I had fur bunnies in every corner every 2nd day!

She knew. It was good to spend some one-on-one time with her last night, I'm doing some more photos of her dogs before they take off to their new homes. Faith and one other are staying with her husband, looking forward to watching the others grow as they are trained in their new homes"

BorderCollie,3asbkg,freckledcupcake,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:11:36 2015 UTC,"I know, it's awesome. The breed is already so diverse, appearance wise. So when you throw anything else in there, you never know what the result will be. I'm really glad I went with a mix. I wanted a pure bred because I had one growing up, but Penny has all the traits I love while still having a good temperament for my lifestyle. I really lucked out. She was the first dog I looked at."
BorderCollie,3asbkg,freckledcupcake,5,Tue Jun 23 03:17:11 2015 UTC,"This is my guy Charlie  He's about 6 now.  He ranges between 21-25 lbs, depending on the time of year. They (SPCA) said he was an Aussie mix, but I'm 99% sure he's BC and Papillion."
BorderCollie,3asbkg,paaps,2,Tue Jun 23 04:35:50 2015 UTC,"I heard that people have been breeding BCs with Pappillons in order to create a miniature version, so that seems entirely plausible. It's funny hearing the guesses shelters make, they're usually way off.   Edit to add: Charlie's eyebrows are fantastic."
BorderCollie,3asbkg,MissWilkem,2,Tue Jun 23 04:40:03 2015 UTC,"RE: Eyebrows - Yeah, I totally fell in love with his expressive face. I wasn't planning on getting a dog that day - I was just donating blankets and pillows, and found myself ""taking a walk"" through the dog section.    His tail is insanely floofy/dramatic and flips over his back side, so I'm convinced it's Papillion. He also sort of prances instead of just walking.  It's pretty hilarious."

BorderCollie,3asbkg,freckledcupcake,4,Tue Jun 23 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"Hee! Yours is like mine - a shorter Border Collie mix. Abby is a Border Collie, Corgi, and Jack Russell mix  She's two and a half, 28 pounds, and has short little corgi legs. She also doesn't seem to care much about herding, just chasing balls and other toys. Abby is super smart though - she regularly tricks other dogs when she's playing fetch so that they won't get the ball before she does."
BorderCollie,3asbkg,ValarDohaeris,2,Tue Jun 23 04:31:10 2015 UTC,"Haha that's awesome! All three of those breeds are clever in different ways. I bet Abby is miles ahead of most dogs.   Penny plays tricks on my sister's dogs (a big lovable pit mix and some derpy little mystery mutt). She'll let them corner her on the couch, and then jump over them, or pounce on their heads. She's way faster than they are and can jump further. And she knows it!"
BorderCollie,3asbkg,haggisthemanly,2,Tue Jun 23 04:36:39 2015 UTC,"Cute!! Mine knows she doesn't have the physical advantage on some other dogs, so she'll trick them. I'll throw the ball, she'll dart off in a totally wrong direction and get the other dog to chase her and then once they overtake her by a bit, she doubles back to get the ball. Or I'll throw it and she'll slowly creep past the other dogs and won't draw attention to herself, then full-out runs after she's past them. She's quite successful when she gets those few extra moments!"
BorderCollie,3asbkg,Phill_Pickle,2,Tue Jun 23 04:49:41 2015 UTC,Oh my goodness those stubby little legs!! So cute!!!
BorderCollie,3asbkg,Phill_Pickle,5,Tue Jun 23 04:49:31 2015 UTC,"Belle is, as best we can tell, lab x border collie.   She has the labrador soft mouth and retrieving down. She's always down for adventure, especially if it's followed by a nap. Basically she's the most beautiful dog I've ever seen.  Her ears are softer than velvet, she's super mellow, and she's hilarious. Sometimes so pathetic, sometimes so clever, always trying her best to be a good girl."
BorderCollie,3asbkg,Vereorx,2,Tue Jun 23 05:39:46 2015 UTC,Her face and coloring remind me of a Chesapeake Bay retriever. But they have wiry hair instead of soft.   She's a gorgeous girl! And she sounds like she has a wonderful personality.

She is only 30 lbs, but one of her brothers are almost 60! the only one I've seen a good adult photo of looks kinda like a setter of some sort. possibly Gordon or English. but since Ady is petite, we wanna think some type of smaller spaniel...possibly a cocker or cavie (we've pretty much ruled out cavie).

They'll (usually) eventually grow out of it, though I'm sorry to say that has only recently happened with my oldest dog (she's 7), and even then she'll still pee a bit when she's REALLY excited to see someone.  Best advice I can give is to train him to pee on command, that way you can kind of prepare for these kinds of meetings and hopefully avoid a giant puddle"

BorderCollie,3aokyh,aveldina,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:55:21 2015 UTC,"see, I've been telling myself that I will start getting up before work, but I have to get up at 5:30 anyway just to be at work and get everything done. So, waking up at 4 does not sound very pleasant. Add in the fact that you really need to have a decent breakfast about 1-3 hours before exercising. or at very least a hearty snack within the hour.... it seems impossible for me to do it and have a normal life after work.   However, going out in the evening is fun. We usually bike around 7:30-8:30 pm ((its usually completely dark by 8:30)) because its so fucking hot here, that you cannot do anything in the middle of the day. Seriously, I don't know how people in the lawn service do it.  the heat index here gets really high. like average day is 100+ Fahrenheit.   Right now we stick to my neighborhood until I get some decent equipment. there is a path behind the house through the woods where people drive ATV's and work truck (they're starting to make more neighborhood), but riding in there with the tire grooves is hard, and dangerous...plus its ALWAYS muddy.......but There are some real trails around though, and friendly people to give me tips...maybe I can find a buddy to ride with and help me learn the basics. Ady loves it though. I call it the  ""fun run"" and she gets all excited, and we go out, and line up, and cruise. all the kids in the neighborhood always say ""i like your dog"" as I ride by, and I always give them some sort of complement too....""I like your shirt"", ""I like your sweatshirt"", ""I like your shoes""....I can't wait for the day I say ""I like YO FACE!"" it's hard for me to resist it most days!"
BorderCollie,3aokyh,Phill_Pickle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:58:28 2015 UTC,"Tomorrow I need to go to a bike to work thing fairly early so I'm thinking if I run the dogs it will be at 430am. :/  I am taking them to an off leash park, there's no where nearby to go besides paved roads and paths and with 2 dogs I don't think on leash is really an option. So I usually load the bike onto my roof rack and do the 14min drive to the park and off we go. The problem in the evening is heavier traffic at the park. I've already had dogs try to attack the bike and it wasn't even busy yet then.   But we will start getting shorter days soon so I'd better enjoy the early mornings while they are still possible."
BorderCollie,3aokyh,aveldina,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:25:06 2015 UTC,"you're dog park must be huge.   and yeah, I could see some dogs wanting to ""get"" the bike. how scary.   we do have some (limited amount) trails around here, but I need to start off like REALLY novice.....and as of now, Ady stays on leash through the neighborhood. I hope to get it to where she doesn't need a leash eventually......especially when we go on trails soon. and if we get another dog...that'll be tricky...so hopefully off leash biking is in our future."
BorderCollie,3aokyh,Phill_Pickle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:15:15 2015 UTC,"It's pretty big, yeah. It's about 2.5km long so the round trip is usually around 5km. It's not an official dog park because it's outside of city limits but the city owns the land. We have a number of dog parks in the city here actually, some are small and the ones near the river are quite large, one has a roughly 1.5-2km loop.  I guess that's the thing though, I have 3 dogs. So on leash has never really been an option. ;)  We have very long daylight in the summer here, and short days in the winter. So we're getting out there while it's good heh. We have sunrise around 5am right now and sunset around 930pm."

The more I learned about them as I grew up, particularly how smart they were, the more I liked them. I've come across some in person over the years and they were always so cool -- one at a festival was carrying an empty plastic water bottle that the owner had her put in the recycling bin; another person had a pair of them and took them to this park I used to run in and play frisbee with, and they seemed so well behaved. I've always liked how intense they look, like they're always looking for instruction.  Now I'm just obsessed -- I check this subreddit and FB groups for new pics several times a day, I'm constantly just staring at my own pup and thinking how cool and pretty she is. I love watching any video with any BC in it. I don't know ... they're just awesome :)"

I'm also very interested in dog sports such as agility so BC's were an obvious choice. To top it all off, he's a gorgeous, friendly, cuddly bundle of fun and I don't think I'll ever have another breed now :)"

They're beautiful, crazy, smart, loving, workaholic creatures. It's tough to not fall in love right away.  I'll always have a dog of another breed around for comedy relief, probably a corgi since I have my own kind of attachment with them. But BCs are life-changing."

Lady's got a light touch so she's a good fit on upland or hair sheep. Probably our greatest challenge was being in charge of a lot of 6 Texel tup lambs... they were enormous, fat, lazy creatures and constantly randy. When I had to get them out of a small pasture so we could lay down fertiliser, 5 minutes felt like 5 long hours. Excruciating.

Over here there are so few people nearby to work dogs with, you're pretty much limited to various breeds or crosses of hair sheep, might get lucky to get some Cheviots or random wool breeds to work here and there, maybe some Suffolks. Just isn't much lamb/wool production in our area, or working dogs.  I have a dog with an overabundance of push but no backbone to back it up and a young dog that I'm not sure what she's got yet, just getting going... think there's give and take to all the different traits.

BorderCollie,39qlxp,HuntingtonPeach,2,Sat Jun 13 20:15:23 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, USBCHA > AHBA > AKC. ABCA is only a registry and does not sanction or host trials. AHBA is similar to AKC in the quality of training and type of stock used but is generally more actual-work focused than AKC. I really enjoy AHBA trials- they're generally very relaxed and just fun to participate in. I don't have much time for AKC trials- they usually consist of a lot of people and dogs with no stock sense, and stock that are sour/overused/abused/harassed, and a lot of talentless dogs being rewarded for something they can't/didn't do.  USBCHA/ISDS-type trials are a true test of a Border Collie, most other breeds can't handle these trials.   Are you interested in pursuing working/herding seriously? A lot of people get their start with AKC/AHBA-type training/trainers, but if this is something you really want to do, I would either start with an NCA/USBCHA trainer or move on to one as soon as you can. But if you're like a lot of people, take what you can get. Do you have your own stock? Are you looking to trial or just have a working farm dog or looking for something to do with your dog?   How old is your pup? Where are you located? Can help you find a trainer in your area if your breeder hasn't helped with that.   If you pursue this, I'll warn you- there's nothing like this in the world. It gives you the highest of highs and the lowest of lows... but you will develop a bond with your dog far beyond what you ever thought possible, way more than anything else (like agility, obedience, etc) can offer. It is completely addicting :-)"
BorderCollie,39qlxp,JaderBug12,2,Sat Jun 13 23:05:14 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for your reply. Where does the NCA rank to you?   I am just looking for something to do with my dog. I don't own a house and will probably move a few more times in the next 5 years or so as I'm finishing up grad school and figuring out where to end up. So, having my own stock or even a working farm dog doesn't make much sense for now.  She's 6 months old now, we're in San Diego, CA. It looks like there are two trainers that do herding lessons within San Diego county -- action k9 Sports and Islander Ranch.  I have no idea how interested in this I am -- she is going for her instinct test next week, and that'll be the first time she's ever seen farm animals since she left the breeder. But I feel pre-uninterested if only because it seems pretty expensive to do -- the people around here seem to charge around $60+ per 30-45 minute lesson, and I assume you'd want to go at least once a week."
BorderCollie,39qlxp,JaderBug12,2,Sat Jun 13 23:54:16 2015 UTC,"Where does the NCA rank to you?    Honestly I know very little about the NCA- I know they're a new club, they're basically an off-shoot of the cattledog people from the USBCHA because they didn't like how the USBCHA was running cattledog trials. Or something like that. From my (admittedly little) experience with cattledog people/trials, cattledog people can be a bit temperamental when it comes to their trials. They have different rules than sheepdog trials. Remains to be seen if the NCA will take off or if it'll even survive, I believe they've tried to do this a couple of times.  Six months is too young to really determine much anyway- doing an instinct test isn't going to hurt or really tell you much, it might tell you if she's 'on' or not, but don't be discouraged if she isn't 'on' for her instinct test. If you think this might be something you're interested in, you really won't be able to start training her until she's physically mature anyway, there's no point in training if she's not physically capable of heading off her stock. That'll only teach bad habits and teach her to chase her stock.  I would say the first link you posted would be a good place to start, at least to learn anyway. Looks like there's at least one Border Collie person there- often times all-breed trainers or people who do not work Border Collies don't understand them very well and often can't train them to their true abilities, especially if your dog comes from working lines. Probably wouldn't waste my time with the GSD person.  It is definitely an expensive hobby if you don't have your own or access to stock- you might play with it for a while, see if you like it, then if you settle in a location with more affordable access to lessons/stock, it might work out better. See if you can find any USBCHA-type trials in your area  You might contact the San Joaquin Valley Border Collie Association- find out if they have any members or events close to you that you could go and learn- most BC people are very willing to answer questions and help out people who are interested in working sheepdogs. Might also want to look through USBCHA's list of upcoming trials, see if there is anything in your area coming up (I see there's something listed from that Action k9 Sports at the end of the month).  If herding doesn't work out or it's not something you think is feasible, there's any number of other activities that you can get into with your pup, and this is one of the best breeds to be active with :-) (also... I think we need pictures!!)  Mind if I ask who your pup's breeder is?"

An instinct test is fun, and you won't regret it. :) It is a joy to watch the little light bulb go on over your dog's head as he/she begins to play with the funnest toys ever!  The rest of herding is expensive, and you can expect to pay about $60+ for a lesson (an instinct test should be shorter duration and less money). However, it's more like riding a bicycle than it it is like learning a language. Going to herding lessons infrequently will not cause your dog to 'forget' anything learned before, just learn more slowly, which for a hobbyist is absolutely fine. Many people enjoy herding for its ability to curb problem behaviors and make a happy pet. Not everyone needs to be the next world champion.  AKC trials can be good or bad, it depends on the trial, as for any organization. AKC B Course is not all that different from USBCHA novice-novice course. You have more ""title hunters"" (people with AKC registered dogs who just want another title for their dog, not a sustained interest in herding) in the AKC shows, but they are absolutely fine for the herding hobbyist, which is what they're geared for. AHBA is similar to AKC but more relaxed, however, sometimes a little too much so. Depends on the trial! USBCHA is the ""big times"". You have to work bigger distances, more ""hands off"" and often tougher stock.   Relatively few USBCHA people give regular lessons. Instead, they tend to give occasional ""clinics"".   If you're ever north of LA or willing to drive that far, PM me, I'll hook you up with someone great."
BorderCollie,39qlxp,obsessedwithmydog,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:42:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the encouragement. I'll see how much we both like it at her first test coming up :)  I think I have an idea of who you mean in the north-of-LA area, actually, but I will definitely get in touch if I'm ever up there. If I don't move back east after school, the next area on my list to colonize is the LA area.  Can I ask you a random question, though -- could probably be a new post, but let me see what you think. I noticed my pup's breeder doesn't ever breed merles. I asked her about this and she said, basically, there aren't any merles who do well in herding trials; basically that, according to her, people breed merles for the color but she hasn't seen them hold a candle to the non-merle herding BCs. Does this seem at all accurate to you? Have you seen any merles be really good herding dogs?"
BorderCollie,39qlxp,obsessedwithmydog,3,Mon Jun 15 20:24:04 2015 UTC,"People bred whatever dog worked well, ""back in the day"". Colour was immaterial. Merle is a colour pattern where you have to choose to include it in your breeding so that it is passed on; it's not a recessive like liver, that could lay dormant for generations until two dogs carrying it happen to be put together.  So if at the time of the great ""boom"" of working sheepdogs there weren't many merled dogs worth their salt, then it makes sense that they fell by the wayside, and mostly B&W or black tri dogs came into the fore.  Now, obviously, there are some merle dogs who, with luck in their breeding, and good training, have done fairly well for themselves. There were two merled dogs who competed at the Deerplay Hill trial in Lancashire just last week, and there are plenty (PLENTY) of B&W or black tri sheepdogs who will never be able to list such a prestigious trial in their accomplishments.  It's unfair and too dismissive to say a merled dog will not work, or not work well. Some do alright for themselves. But those dogs are probably more the product of a great handler and solid training, than natural talent from breeding."

BorderCollie,39jq2u,SeguinPancakes,3,Fri Jun 12 05:16:35 2015 UTC,"Schedule is really up to you, but there are a few things you need to do whatever it ends up being. First, let him out after every meal, playtime, nap, or anything else he's been doing. On top of that, let him out every hour or so (a good rule of thumb is that your dog can hold it for how ever many hours he is months old. So a two month old dog can probably go two hours, etc.).  Second, let him out to do his business in the middle of the night to avoid accidents. Some people don't think they need to do this (or luckily have a puppy that will sleep through the night), but the less times he makes a mess indoors, the faster they will be housebroken. At that age, I let mine out every three hours at night.  With regards to exercise and activity, be sure to wait about an hour after eating before taking him for a walk or other strenuous activity. I usually give him a chewie after breakfast to make sure he chills a while (and also gives me a chance to make and eat breakfast if I haven't already!).  Remember that until about 18 months of age that their growth plates are still open and you should avoid any repetitive motions (like fetch) or jumping on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time. A good rule of thumb is to keep strenuous exercise (that is, excersise that he wouldn't do on his own; think fetch, being chased, or being out on a leash) to about 5 mins per month old the pup is, for up to twice a day. Self directed excersise (running around with his toys, sniffing and running around, etc.) is fine.  At that young age, you can expect him to sleep (or at least he should) very often. My current pup was usually up for an hour or three before taking a short nap whenever he felt like it. My previous BC was a mix and he did NOT have the same sense of sleep discipline! Instead he would just stay up, become over tired, cranky/bitey and we always had to force him to take a nap (we used a crate). If your dog doesn't take a nap on his own, doing the crate thing is a great way to teach him to have an ""off switch"".  Anyway, here's what our schedule looked like when he was about that age: 6am - wake up, let him out of his crate and straight outside to do his business. He will usually lay around or go to sleep a bit while I make and eat breakfast, otherwise he will follow me around and/or chew/play with his toys. 7am - he eats breakfast, I let him outside right away to do his business. Then, I will usually play/train him until we go out for a walk at about 9 or 930, After we get back, gets put into his crate to sleep while I take a shower. After shower, I let him out again and I pretty much just let him do his own thing/entertain himself for a while and maybe do some training games for a 15 minutes before I leave for work at 1230pm. My partner gets home around 130pm. Dog gets let out, and fed lunch. Outside again to do business right after. Next few hours my partner will play with him, do basic training, or just let him do whatever (letting him out every hour to pee) before he gets another short walk at about 6pm. He gets fed dinner at 7pm, and outside again right after for business. At around 9pm, he get put in a crate to sleep for about an hour until I get home. Then, we let him outside, and we play for an hour or so before he gets put into the crate for the night (letting him go outside before that, of course). I wake up at 2am and 5 am to let him out to pee.  It's pretty tough that first few months, I felt like I was going crazy and never getting enough sleep, but stick it out for a year and a half and you end up with a perfect dog."
BorderCollie,39jq2u,Glenndogg,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:31:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the rundown of your routine. Really helps me get an idea of what to expect. I'm so new to all this I feel dumb asking basic stuff like what order you feed-walk-play etc but I'm so determined to do right by this pup after reading a bunch of advisories against BC's for first time dog owners.
BorderCollie,39jq2u,danaofdoom,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:24:47 2015 UTC,"My border collie mix eats in the evening, because that's when I eat. I know a lot of people believe you should eat before your dog to establish dominance, but I've been training her not to beg, and I've found that she has an easier time of that if she's already eaten. It hasn't affected her obedience at all. I also like to use that time to work on her ""wait"" command. She can't have her dinner until she sits patiently until I tell her to come and get it.   Whether or not you treat train after meals is up to you. It also depends on how food motivated your dog is. Mine is extremely food motivated. She always wants treats, no matter how much she's eaten. So I'm careful to use low calorie treats and portion them out. For harder stuff we'll use a high value thing like cheese, but she also gets a little less dinner if she's had lots of treats. I really want to avoid her gaining weight. The vet says she's the perfect weight right now and I want to keep it that way   I've had my dog a week now and she's seemed up for all the obedience training I can throw at her. She's also enjoyed visiting some family members, but she can get overwhelmed if people are being noisy or not respecting her space, and will growl if people loom over her (she doesn't seem to care what my fiance and I do but she's mistrustful of strangers). So I keep an eye on her, and if she seems stressed we go into another room or go home. I was worried that I'd been doing too much with her, but the vet told me to keep socializing her.   As for exercising, our schedule has looked like this:  5am- fiance gets up for work, takes dog out for morning potty break (it takes some convincing to get her up at this point, but she always needs to go and we don't want any accidents). After potty break she comes back to bed and we both feel very smugfortable while my fiance goes to work.   7:30am: I get up. Take dog for a more substantial walk (around half an hour. It's been very hot lately so we don't stay outside long). After the walk she goes in her crate, with a chew toy and a stuffed kong,  and I go to work.   12:00pm- I come home for lunch and let her out to go to the bathroom.   3 or 4pm- I come home from work. We go for another walk, then hang out around the house. We do obedience training and play with toys as the mood strikes. She does best with short bursts of activity. But she's not a pure breed, so you may find your dog has more focus.   If the weather permits we'll go to the park, or go visit a family member with other dogs and a fenced in yard so she can have fun with other dogs. She LOVES puppy play dates.   5 or 6pm- she gets a cup of dog food. After dinner she gets another walk. Then we go on visits or to the park or just another walk.   Usually by 10 we get home and relax.    It's a full day but I love it. This week with my wiggly, cuddly, playful pup has been so rewarding. Even though we have some behavior issues to work through, I can tell this dog wants to please me. She loves attention and praise, and watches me all the time for cues. She jumps at the chance to show me her skills and get treats. Getting up early for walks is totally worth it."
BorderCollie,39jq2u,crashdemon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:27:50 2015 UTC,"There really isnt an ideal schedule. He will adapt to whatever you set, it sounds like you have all the basics. You may be underestimating their activity level but every dog is different. As for treat training after eating, my bc was never into treats he was always toy drivin."
BorderCollie,39jq2u,dict_disc,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:31:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I went into this thinking I'm gonna have a crazy energetic off the wall pup and I was fully ready for runs, fetch, hikes, the works. Then the more I read the more I heard that stuff doesn't happen till they're a year or so.   So I guess I'll get what I get in terms of energy and adjust accordingly. My guy was definitely right in the middle energy wise in his litter. He has a brother that will just turn back and sit in the shade when the others walk down the lawn, and a sister who was all over the place play fighting and jumping all over everyone.  Both the momma and poppa dogs seemed pretty mellow, but they're a few years old now. So...we'll see when I get him home lol"
BorderCollie,39jq2u,aveldina,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:35:31 2015 UTC,"Be careful not to overwork her. According to my Vet, overworking (like running 10 km with a bike etc.) a young (under 1 yr. old) BC can result in joint problems down the line.     BCs love playing so much that they can over do it and hurt them selves. For example, my BC has worn canine teeth from too much playing with tennis balls (stick to rubber). He'll also damage his feet if I don't make sure he plays in moderation.    Otherwise I recommend two things: hiring a dog sitter who does walks in groups (they can socialise your pup effectively and give you advice), and practicing being left alone for a few hours. You may not plan leaving her alone much, but sometimes you'll have to (like when you travel), and IMO it's helpful if they have practiced from young age."
BorderCollie,39jq2u,bas2b2,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:04:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Getting that balance between wearing them out and not letting them burn themselves out sounds key. The alone thing is good to know too, someone on this sub has mentioned that before.   The only day I really need a dog sitter/walker I have my friend -a seasoned dog girl- coming to hang with him for an hour or so. She's going to have her three year old daughter in tow which I'm very excited about because I'd like to get him used to kids early on, since I will probably be having kids in a few years."

As long as the countries you're moving to don't require quarantine (that would be torture for a BC) you should be fine. Costs are quite reasonable, usually under $1000 per flight to bring a dog.  Every time I picked him up the airport staff (who had walked/fed him) would ask if I was sure I wanted him, cause if not they would take him... No, I'm paying money to bring a dog internationally so someone can adopt him on the other end. >.<  Anyways, I wouldn't vacation with a dog internationally-travel is stressful, but moving isn't an issue."
BorderCollie,398w9i,thecotton,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"Question; have you ever gone US > UK?  US is listed as a ""non-listed"" status, meaning the pet can't get an ""EU Pet Passport"". I want to avoid quarantine, but I've read I can get a type of certificate, use approved carriers/routes, and as long as all my other paperwork checks out that means I can use the certificate like a Passport?   Many dog lovers were excited to hear about Britain's PETS (Pet Travel Scheme) Program. This program permits qualifying countries to allow people traveling with dogs to avoid the lengthy 6 month U.K. pet quarantine. Back on November 20, 2002, Britain announced that effective December 11, 2002, both the U.S. and Canada are now considered qualifying countries. Now a pet owner can follow a check list of requirements in order to bring their pooch with them to the U.K. However, there are still several drawbacks to this program. If any of the requirements in the PETS program are not followed, your dog will still be placed into quarantine, with a petition for early release."

I really want to bring my border collie mix to our wedding this weekend, but we haven't found any dog friendly accommodations in the area.   Part of me is anxious because we just adopted her from a rescue last Wednesday and I'm worried she'll feel abandoned. But if I'm honest with myself, a bigger part of me is disappointed because in the week I've had this dog she's been the best therapy I've ever had for my anxiety issues. I now totally understand why people use animals for therapy. Her calm disposition and affection help me relax when I'm wound up, and her bursts of playful puppy energy force me to go out and be active a couple times a day, which is a proven remedy for anxiety/depression.   This weekend is going to be a long one. I'm sure the dog will be fine with her puppy sitter and will be used to our absence within an hour. Hopefully I adapt just as quickly."

BorderCollie,38k0hz,idownvotethenread,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"How old is Orbit, what is he being distracted by, what rewards/for how long/where/what behaviour are you training?"
BorderCollie,38k0hz,potato_is_meat,2,Thu Jun 4 19:14:46 2015 UTC,Orbit is about to turn 3. He likes to spend his time inside playing with his large collection of tennis balls (his favorite thing to do by far) and running from door to door to look outside. These two things are usually what distract him. The only reward he seems to ever go for is hand feeding him is normal food. He usually makes it a couple min tops before getting distracted. And its usually just working with him on simple skills he already has such as sitting and shaking and such.
BorderCollie,38k0hz,potato_is_meat,2,Thu Jun 4 19:36:42 2015 UTC,"He is old enough to be giving you more attention, but you need him to learn to do so before you expect more duration in training sessions. It sounds like he isn't used to ""intense"" training so dial expectations down for his attention to a puppy's level. He'll progress quicker than one, obviously, but everyone has to start at Kindergarten if they've never gone to school before. ;)  Remove distractions - don't leave tennis balls lying around, and keep him in a small room, like your bathroom, with the door closed at first. Decide on a single trick or behaviour you want to work on, and when he's made enough progress to repeat it a few times, give him his freedom. Use really yummy treats, smellier food, and for his ""jackpot"" (the biggest reward at the end, when he does his best) I think a good chase of the tennis ball would be ideal. It sounds like he might be more toy motivated than food, for now at least.  For a reference point, I have been training my BC to do tricks and silly things since she was 8 weeks old. I still rarely go past a couple minutes on training sessions. It's a lot of work to keep up mentally and execute the behaviours. So bear that in mind, and keep things nice and short. I'd stick to a 30s-1 min timeframe to begin with. :)  You can do the sessions frequently throughout the day, but keep them short! And try not to ""push for more"" or introduce new behaviours at the tail end of a session. If you want to move on to a new trick, give him time off, start anew with it later on."
BorderCollie,38k0hz,WorldSailorToo,2,Thu Jun 4 20:29:29 2015 UTC,"Alright sounds good, ill try short sessions in a closed room to start :) thanks for the tips."
BorderCollie,38if37,misscareer,3,Thu Jun 4 12:43:03 2015 UTC,"Aside from working on the farm, I would say my favourite is going to the sand dunes and throwing Frisbees uphill. Took a while to perfect my timing and technique but now Lady gets an awesome workout (better her than me haha) and she'll do anything for a Frisbee. Running uphill in sand and jumping at the top knackers her out like you wouldn't believe! I have to keep her hydrated loads even in mild weather because it is so much effort."
BorderCollie,38if37,potato_is_meat,3,Thu Jun 4 13:07:03 2015 UTC,"Extra benefit to this - the sand means all this exercise is low impact, which will be easier on her joints long term, too.  We cheat.  We raise sheep.  Overenergetic border collie?  Go move some sheep around for a bit.  When it's not a good time of year for a lot of sheep work, fetch is usually a good bet, but some days your arm will wear out before their legs!"
BorderCollie,38if37,nathhad,2,Thu Jun 4 15:54:02 2015 UTC,"That's true! I didn't even think that being on the dunes means way less impact. :)  And yeah farmwork is what keeps her tired the most. This time of year, even heading out early in the morning doesn't mean much since the grass is so tall. On her outrun I can see her little head bobbing up occasionally, looks exhausting. :D"

BorderCollie,38g6xp,matttjonez,2,Thu Jun 4 00:39:33 2015 UTC,Yep plan on going out 1-2 times during the night too.   We tied a bell and tennis ball to the door and taught our BC to hit it with his nose when he wants to go out which is a helpful way for them to signal. Just shake it every time you take yours out and try to get it involved that way if you're interested.
BorderCollie,38g6xp,aampersaand,3,Thu Jun 4 23:11:53 2015 UTC,"Crate for bedtime and away time only, not for discipline. We got a kong and put a smidge of peanut butter in it and would tell our BC, go to bed! She stopped whining after a week, and after a couple weeks she 1) would only go to bed on command if we had her kong (oops) and 2) napped in her open crate on her own during the day (yay!) and 3) put herself to bed and slept there the WHOLE NIGHT with no accidents when my husband accidentally fell asleep on the couch and forgot to put her to bed! Some might say the kong is a bad habit, but it's a good trade off for how quickly she adjusted."
BorderCollie,38g6xp,Sacket,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:22:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I'm still trying to figure out how we're going to execute the crate situation, maybe you can weigh in? We were thinking of just keeping the crate in our bedroom, and totally only crating for bedtime and away time. There are only two hours max between when I leave for work and when my husband comes home most days so that wasn't going to be a problem. Butttt there is one day a week (Mondays) where we are both gone 9:30am-5 pm and for that day I was planning to leave puppy in the gated off kitchen with kong, toys etc and just have a friend visit/check in/potty time in the middle of the day.   So my question is is it really dumb to leave him without his crate during this one day if that's his happy safe nap time place? Is it okay to move the crate for this one day or is that confusing for him? I'm new to this whole thing and while I have nothing but time the rest of the week I'm so nervousness about the best way to handle this one day with my new pup."
BorderCollie,38g6xp,Moops79,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:44:12 2015 UTC,"In my limited opinion this is your call, for one day it's probably not that bad, and for sure won't seriously hurt the pup so long as someone is coming over to let it out."
BorderCollie,38g6xp,aampersaand,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:29:06 2015 UTC,"I initially left Rowdy alone in a bathroom for several hours a day while I was at work and my wife was out of town for a few weeks. I didn't put the crate in the bathroom because I wanted to prevent any accidents in the crate and, honestly, she HATED that bathroom. I didn't want her associating the crate with that bathroom.   I made her associate the crate with fun and sleepy times. It started by tossing a toy in there that we were playing with; making it a place she'd want to go. Never forcing her in against her will. Small steps. Get her to go in first. Once she's comfortable with that, close the door for a couple of seconds. Use treats and always reward the behavior you want to see (calmness in the crate). Rowdy took to it pretty quickly.   I didn't do this, but it might help. Sleep with a small towel to get your scent on it. Then see if the breeder will put it in your new pup's bed now before you ever bring her home. Then when you pick her up, leave the towel in the crate so she'll already associate it with bedtime.   My only other piece of advice is to leash train early. Slowly and patiently. Never let her pull; if she pulls, stop until she comes back to you and slacks the leash. I'm dealing with the consequences of not doing that early, and it's not fun.   Other than that, enjoy your cute new friend!"
BorderCollie,38g6xp,Sacket,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:04:54 2015 UTC,"Consistency is key. Whatever you decide to do, stick with it until the next phase. For whatever reason, we got the xl size crate (with a divider right now) so we don't ever move it. If moving the crate is an option right now, that is fine. If not, he'll be fine, he's a puppy. They can fall asleep anywhere. Puppy mats might also be an option for Mondays, and as he gets older you can phase them out too.  I didn't mention that ours prefers cold tile over soft blankets and during the day sometimes likes to nap in the kitchen, and didn't start napping in her crate until we took all the blankets out of it. :)"
BorderCollie,38g6xp,Moops79,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:17:50 2015 UTC,"One piece of advice I can give you that saves a LOT of headache, hang a bell from your doorknob. every time you take him/her outside to go potty (every single time from the moment you get it!) make the dog ring the bell with its nose or paw. Especially with a border collie, within the first couple months the dog will start ringing the bell when it needs to go out. No guessing needed, no schedule keeping needed, no timers being set. The dog will ring the bell when it needs to go out. This is the BEST method of house training I have ever practiced. It sounds too good to be true but dogs, and especially border collies, are way smarter than you give them credit for. If you do it EVERY TIME you take the dog out, you will be a very happy dog owner indeed. Good luck! Pups cute as fuck."

BorderCollie,38cwlo,Wcoburn93,3,Wed Jun 3 12:11:04 2015 UTC,"Dexter may be the kind of boy who is very, very sensitive to the crazy pheromones being wafted around by a female in season. To begin with, I'm hardly surprised it all kicked off when one was at the dog park (seriously irresponsible of the owners to have brought her).  If she lives in your area, he may be in a constant state of agitation and even removing him and going to visit family, the beach, whatever may not be enough to distract him. Some boys don't eat, don't listen, act out, and constantly emit a high-pitched whine until the pheromones in the air and ground have dissipated for their minds to clear.  Have you considered attending classes with him where he'll learn to focus on you in the presence of other dogs? We promote going to class not so much for what you learn - because not all trainers are created equal - but for the socialising and exposure opportunities.  Throughout his growing-up years, Dexter will fluctuate and sometimes seem fine one day and tough to handle on another. It's adolescence, it's hormones, it's the mind of youth. If you're consistent, stay motivated, keep at the training with positive, encouraging methods, you can weather the storm and have a great adult dog."

Aggression problems it might be wise to speak to someone who can observe the dog in person and work with you. Yes neutering is an option, and yes neutering may help but it's not a free fix.

BorderCollie,3853df,danaofdoom,5,Mon Jun 1 22:33:32 2015 UTC,"Have you considered going through a rescue to be matched up with an older, perhaps more medium-energy collie? You have a flexible schedule, you've owned a BC before, you're financially stable - maybe enough to pay for a dog walker to break up the day... it sounds like an adult BC with a known history suitable to your needs could be the right match."
BorderCollie,3853df,potato_is_meat,2,Mon Jun 1 23:11:12 2015 UTC,I have considered it. I am in favor of this route but my fiance has his heart set on a puppy and is really against a border collie. But maybe I can convince him. It sounds really logical the way you put it.

BorderCollie,37vfwa,movelz,1 point,Sat May 30 23:37:08 2015 UTC,"A breeder up here in Wyoming. Triskle Border Collies.   He actually is very light compared to his mother who is a red/white (chocolate). His breeder thought he might be lilac for a while, but his father was color tested to have no dilute gene so it wasn't possible. His father is a very strange color that no one is quite for sure what it is. Tony just sticks with sable merle, but his color test came back with 2 copies of tan (tri color) which eliminates sable as a possibility. So he likely has a ghost gene that alters his coloring."

I don't think there's any factor (age, gender, etc.) that causes that, it's just a personality thing. Some dogs just have a preference for men or women. Used to drive me nuts... but it is what it is.  Now my younger two prefer me and the oldest gets to stay home with my husband when I go to trials. They're couch buddies."
BorderCollie,37u1pj,JaderBug12,1 point,Sat May 30 12:19:56 2015 UTC,Thank you all for the responses! :)
BorderCollie,37u1pj,deadzip10,0,Sun Jun 7 10:29:29 2015 UTC,"Dogs are naturally pack animals and within the pack the males are dominant regardless of the fact that the females care for the young and, in some cases, do most of the real work. As a result, dogs will often naturally suck up to the ""dominant"" male in the household. It's not really a preference thing so much as the dog not being able to fully understand the difference in the dynamic. Understanding the underlying dominance issues that dogs perceive actually can explain a lot of weird behavior they sometimes show."
BorderCollie,37u1pj,colliekris,4,Sat May 30 12:48:59 2015 UTC,"Not true. Dogs are not rigid pack animals who have a hierarchy of dominance like you're mentioning. Dominance theory has long since been outdated and proven wrong after it was formed from a 1930s study done on CAPTIVE wolves in a zoo. That study was soon considered bunk by peers. The ""pack"" is less dominance based and more family based. Mom and Dad run the show, and the kids stick around until they decide to make it on their own. A wolf pack is infinitely more structured than a dog pack, because wolves must work together to hunt and have complex social lives surrounding their pack. Dogs do not have to hunt and they do not have to count on one another to survive. Their social groups are fluid and often changing. While dominance does play some small part it absolutely has nothing to do with gender. In fact, there are one or two Wolf packs where the dominant adult was a matriarch and I have seen many female dogs who were far more dominant and aggressive about the top spot than the boys.  To answer the OP, dogs have preferences just like humans do. Just because you spend a lot of time with a person, and less with the another doesn't mean you can't like the person you see less more. Some personalities mesh and bond beautifully, others take a little longer to develop. Dogs are intelligent creatures. They feel complex emotion and are able to make those personal preferences. Try not to sweat it!"

We saw 3 different dogs today and 2 yesterday and he remained completely calm.    Re the balloons. We had some at a BBQ a couple of weekends ago and it was fine - but the ones today were on strings and bouncing around.  Combine that with a new human getting in his face and I think that was just too much."
BorderCollie,37r93n,khandelas,3,Fri May 29 19:21:18 2015 UTC,"Well, you've said it yourself that during the week, there's time allotted for training. That alone is a ""job"" - you can do all sorts of trick training even in a tiny flat! Another thing you might be interested is body conditioning exercises, particularly if you intend to do difficult trails with Dex. He'll need a lot of co-ordination and core strength, even if it is easier to scrabble on four legs instead of two. :) I recommend joining the ""Canine Conditioning"" group on Facebook to have a look at the sort of exercises you can do in your own home with Dex. Equipment needed is minimal, and you can always get creative with home-made versions.  You can do agility, too, if you're willing to buy cheapo equipment like jumps and soft tunnels and set it up in a dog-friendly park on your days off. That's what my friend did when she moved away from where she was taking formal agility classes, just to keep herself and her dog ""in form"". BCs love having a strong working relationship with you, so even agility for funsies would help to build that."

My BC went through a brief anti-lake phase as a 6 mo. old but I got her to love the water again with gentle coaxing and being in there with her. Swimming is a wonderful activity for them.

BorderCollie,3774dt,Vereorx,1 point,Mon May 25 13:13:56 2015 UTC,I remember trying to get my BC to swim for the first time. At first I had no idea what to do and I would just try and put her in and let her be swimming about. She was having none of it and would quickly swim to shore only when I decided to enter the water with her waist deep did she realize the water was safe. Not she's a swimming fiend and try's to jump into any lake or ocean she gets near. Love the pictures! Just reminded me of my dog when she was learning.
BorderCollie,37960m,Mr_Steak_Grade_A,4,Mon May 25 22:04:23 2015 UTC,"We have three cats, our BC essentially regards them as her flock.  She keeps them away from the dinner table and keeps them out of anywhere they're not supposed to be.  It's quite helpful.  She is very protective of her cats to the point that we have to lock the cats away if friends bring their dogs over because she will go after any dog that shows an interest in them.  If she doesn't see them for an extended period of time she has to inspect each one thoroughly.  It's rather adorable.   I wish I could offer more advice other than I know it's possible, but we got ours from a rescue that had a bunch of cats running around so she came cat-acclimated"
BorderCollie,37960m,djjolicoeur,3,Tue May 26 00:19:14 2015 UTC,"Reward calmness around the cat. And if you want to play/get her worked up, make sure she can't then redirect her energy on to the cat. Playtime and going out/coming in need to happen with the cat out of the room.  I had 3 cats and my BC was very gentle with all of them. She enjoyed grooming them with her tongue and snoozing on the same pillow. All we did was make sure she was constantly rewarded for maintaining her cool around them throughout her puppyhood."
BorderCollie,37960m,potato_is_meat,3,Mon May 25 22:42:44 2015 UTC,"Our BC loves our cats (though not when they attack her fluffy tail). We got them as kittens and made sure both our BC and rottie (both at least a few years old) knew to ""be gentle"" with the kittens and kept a close eye on them while together until we knew there wasn't a problem. Also, we discouraged them from chasing the cats when they ran away (at first, now they play tag). The cats also had ""escape"" areas, like upstairs or a cat tree that they knew they could get away if they were scared. Now they all get along just fine!!"
BorderCollie,37960m,LadyPandaBug,2,Tue May 26 01:49:29 2015 UTC,"For what it is worth. My BC is obsessed with the outside cats. As for the inside Siamese. She could care less.  The indoor Siamese can walk over her face when she is sleeping, sample from her food dish, but let the outside cats grab ahold of the security screen and shake it....  She goes ballistic wanting to go outside and chase them.  IF the cats don't run (outside cats) she is baffled. Almost angry. I have seen the outside cats cold cock her with the claws on the nose.  She just jumps back and waits for a chance to chase them.  I think the inside cat is not intimidated nor a runner....so the BC pays him no attention."

BorderCollie,37960m,CollieRomeo,1 point,Tue May 26 01:30:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with keeping your BC calm around the cat and rewarding good behaviour. That was the key to our BC and younger cat getting along. The older cat hates dogs and so they keep their distance from each other but we still have the odd swipe if our BC gets too close to the grumpy old sod, but he knows now to leave him alone!   Background: we adopted our BC at 7 months old, and no one got along at first. Granted, we didn't think to research the best way to introduce them and kind of just did it, and I really regretted it as the cats HATED our new BC. I finally got the younger cat to bond with our BC over food and keeping BC calm around the cat. Once the cat built up some trust, I was able to reduce the amount of supervision needed  and now our BC follows the younger cat around everywhere, herding him, and ""nipping"" at his hind legs (he doesn't actually make contact). The cat just keeps walking and puts up with it now."
BorderCollie,37960m,Indirya,1 point,Tue May 26 03:00:15 2015 UTC,"We got cats when our border collie was much older. They were a big novelty to her. At first I was afraid she would attack the cats but she just followed them around. And my kitten followed me around. So I lead a parade everywhere I went in the house.   Eventually she got used to them, and then her life's goal was just to keep them out of the living room. She didn't have to follow them everywhere, as long as they stayed where she wanted them.   My uncle's BC, on the other hand, was best buds with his cat. They would snuggle together. It was really cute."

BorderCollie,377hcb,Ashmore113,3,Mon May 25 14:41:34 2015 UTC,"For the bi-annual coat blowing, I recently bought the Furminator deshedding shampoo and if you follow the instructions, it works incredibly well. Significantly reduces the time it takes for the dog to get all that dead hair out.  As for actual tools, I use the Zoom Groom (blue rubber-bristle brush, works with static) very often. It's great for massaging product into the coat and on the skin during bathtime, in addition to casual use. The dogs both love the cone-shaped rubber bristles, bit like getting one's head scratched.  I use a slicker very occasionally to whip air into the coat and manage flyaways. Greyhound comb for tangled bits - work gently! And a general pin brush, some prefer T-shaped because it's more ergonomic.  Don't forget to get a good pair of nail clippers and a dremel if necessary. Electric trimmer or scissors for the hair between and under the paw pads."

BorderCollie,377hcb,designingnaked,1 point,Thu May 28 14:53:57 2015 UTC,"all the brushes are used for different things. You also have to figure out which ones is best for your pups coat.  I'm not a fan of furminators as they can actually cut out hair...I've seen someone keep brushing and brushing until there was like a chunk missing...anyway....you can get them, just use them right.  I have 3 brushes (4 types). I don't use them all every time I groom though.    a 2 in 1 deal- one side is firm and spread out bristles, but the other side is metal pins. This is for your daily brushing, no mats, not problems. I use the wire pins first, the untangle anything, then I smooth it all out with the bristles. the undercoat rake- I find myself using the rake brush a lot, because of mats in the undercoat near my girls ears and butt fluff. They're mostly for pulling up the loose undercoat fluff (and they do that well) and helping pull out mats without tearing too much of the surrounding hair out too. I've never use the rakes made specifically for removing mats....I just haven't been around one....but I hear they're basically the same. the slicker brush- because its pines are made of a fine wire, I use it to get out any simple tangles or burrs stuck in my pups hair, or places on other dogs wher s that get wet when they drink water....I use it just to kinda break it up)   I try to brush mine enough to where she doesn't mat, but busy lives happen, and brushing gets shoved to the side for a few days. I also use the normal."

So far it's going great. Only a couple of accidents and although he whimpers a little when first put in his crate he soon settles and he doesn't fear it at all. A blanket from his mum and feeding him in there helps a lot. Feels good to have a BC back in the house!"
BorderCollie,36gs6w,Engineer_in_Pearls,0,Tue May 19 07:27:59 2015 UTC,"There are some different ideas on this. But, what I found helped is letting my BC pup sleep at the foot of my bed in his crate. It cut down on the whimpering while still asserting some dominance. And I never move the crate. It's his safe place that he can go any time. It's always open and I keep some chew bones and toys in there for him so he's encouraged to go in and out without him being ""locked in"".  House training wise, just take them outside after they eat or drink. Or are playing. Cause it's kinda like a kid, when they stop playing they realize they have to go. Also, take them out any time they ask even if you just took them (my pup learned to sit by the door and bark once...didn't teach him that - they are so smart sometimes it's scary). As they go reinforce ""good boy/girl"" and say the word ""potty"" and they will start to connect the dots. Hope this was helpful!"

Since she will turn from a nice doggie to a raving loony in a moments notice. It all appears to what she perceives as a threat against me. Except for the Siamese housecat, she is obsessed with the outside cats. And squeekie toys. She goes bananas over squeeky toys.  While she loves my pickup. She hates the big truck, as you can see.

Be careful with their paws, they will tear them up depending on the terrain (its pretty rocky here) plus heat is a factor.  Make sure you stop & plan your rides by ponds and creeks.  At 6 months, I would limit your pup to a few miles and concentrate on training while riding.  It's nice to get them to follow your rear tire and not attempt to pass or be on your side."
BorderCollie,36ej64,PluckyPlucker,2,Mon May 18 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"Awesome - thanks!    Also, how do you work on getting them to stay on your rear wheel?

And make some command for not letting them walk past you(follow) eventually they will understand to follow while walking and no leash.  This translates to biking perfectly.  I've actually got it so I can have my fast girl up front and my slow boy behind.  I can tell her faster, slower, race,  left, right, wrong way.  My boy hasn't figured all that yet.

BorderCollie,36ej64,rubyloodo,1 point,Mon May 18 22:08:02 2015 UTC,Yep just being consistent with commands and actions they will learn anything.
BorderCollie,36ej64,5picy,1 point,Tue May 19 17:35:11 2015 UTC,I recommend a bike leash attachment such as the WalkyDog....keeps them in line with the real wheel and also absorbs lunges/pulls so that you don't feel like you're going to topple with every lunge.  I just got mine the other day and took my border/aussie mix out on our 1st real bike ride last night and it is awesome!!

BorderCollie,36ej64,aveldina,2,Wed May 20 15:46:59 2015 UTC,I couldn't say because I haven't done that.  But a 10 mile run on flat terrain doesn't sound bad.  I only have issues because my trails are quite rocky which tears up pads.  Plus running is going to be quite slower than what I do on a bike.  Just watch for heat and water needs.
BorderCollie,36ej64,saintoaks,1 point,Tue May 19 03:41:02 2015 UTC,"Fully grown, adult, well conditioned dogs? No limit really. Pay attention to the dog and his/her needs. My youngest heats up quicker than my older and needs water or access to a way to cool off more often. If we are near a river or other water source she will cool off on her own when she needs to.  If your dog is really slowing down or sore the next day then for sure back things off a bit and build up slowly. Really your dog is your best guide so listen to them and they'll tell you.  Make sure you keep things gradual with young dogs and allow them to exercise at their own pace. Off leash is great for young dogs since they can stop or slow when they are tired. Keep the distances short but it's a nice time to start building up some fitness. :D Just no forced/structured/on-leash until full grown.   Some people opt to have their dogs well out in front and pulling ala bikejor or canicross style. If you do this make sure you get a proper harness that is made for pulling and fitted to your dog. You'll want to wait until he is full grown though so you don't need more than one. Canadog or Howling Dog Alaska both make great pulling harnesses that are made for high attachment points like a bike. Check out their canicross/skijor kits."
BorderCollie,36ej64,xcitu,1 point,Tue May 19 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"Already said, but make sure to really respect your dog's body before he is a year and a half old. Until then he is still setting up physically. It gets hard when they are a year old and about full grown, but if you hold back until the 1.5 year marker then those dogs can take about any trail/beating you can throw at them. Be sure to inspect your boy's paws before and after your treks. Simple but important."
BorderCollie,36ej64,rawcureface,-6,Tue May 19 15:46:49 2015 UTC,"You don't really  need to exercise him physically. He's allready fit and will always be fit, unless you fatten him up. :P  If you exercise him physically, you'll just get a dog that can run further and further, and it will take longer and longer for him to get a little bit tired and calm.   Exercise him mentally, much more important. He's always fit for trips.  I would wait until he's atleast a year old before ""straining"" him too much. His body needs to develop.  Also, you need to tell him when to stop, he will run until he dies."

My dog is 5, so, I'm pretty sure I have a handle on keeping it in check. I'll keep this in mind if we add another BC to our lives."
BorderCollie,3662xj,Phill_Pickle,6,Sun May 17 01:47:33 2015 UTC,"Just be careful-- BC are incredibly intelligent and hyper active, and can become anxious and/or obsessive easily.   Playing with laser pointers can lead to other obsessions like reflections/shadows/light spots from windows, and if they pounce too much on hard floors, they can actually cause harm to themselves.   As cute and silly as it is. Prompting  your dog do these behaviors should probably be avoided.   Mine likes to chase the pointer as well, but once I learned of the damage it can cause (mentally and physically) I stopped ""letting"" her do it."
BorderCollie,3662xj,BrianMHayes,3,Sat May 16 18:25:48 2015 UTC,"Heed this advice! I have 2 Border Collies. The oldest ""Bandit"", after playing with laser pointers when he was a puppy now has a full on compulsion to chase shadows. Mainly though his compulsion is ""licking walls"". When company comes over he immediately goes right to the wall and ferociously starts licking to the point where his entire snout is covered in slobber and frothing at the underside of his mouth. This also happens when there are loud noises. He does this roughly 10-15 times a day. Maybe even more. He still eats and sleeps and plays healthily but he will not stop licking until we tell him to stop.  I've been looking for an answer to this problem for so long. I essentially just thought since they're such a energetic breed that this was his relief to being stuck inside while I'm at work.  DO NOT USE LASER POINTERS ON B/Cs!!!!  I feel horrible now knowing that this is why he compulses so badly.  The best way I've noticed to keep it at bay is to just run him absolutely ragged at the park or play fetch."

I never brought out the laser pointer when my dog was a puppy, and even now it's a very rarely and briefly used treat. My partner and I are both very mindful of when things get too intense and the laser is taken away.   My dog is 5 years old, so, I guess I don't see he's having huge problems. I'll definately keep all this in mind if we add another BC to our life."

BorderCollie,35ugt1,jackatort,14,Wed May 13 16:40:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely verified. Not just border collies, and dog homozygous for Merle is likely to have such defects. The catahoula is the only exception, their genes are still being studied. Border collies, Aussies, Danes, dachshunds, collies, shelties, anything homozygous will have defects.   Just google ""double merle"" and you'll get plenty of examples.  Intentionally breeding two merles is a deplorable act. They are knowingly subjecting a number of their pups to being blind and/or deaf. Pups are often born with missing eyes, or very misshapen ones. Do your research, and dump your ""breeder"" ASAP."

BorderCollie,35ugt1,potato_is_meat,3,Wed May 13 20:02:53 2015 UTC,"Red, blue, slate, lilac, doesn't matter. The merling gene is the same in all of them, and across breeds. If you see both parents have it, run for the hills."
BorderCollie,35ugt1,5picy,3,Wed May 13 22:23:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  Also, note that if you have homozygous ee Red (""gold""/""Australian red"") dogs, the merle gene isn't expressed, so you can't tell if they're merle or not -- meaning ee Red dogs should never be mated to merles, just in case."
BorderCollie,35ugt1,anatopism,2,Wed May 13 23:44:44 2015 UTC,Exactly as /u/PlayingByEar said. Do not go with any breeder who is breeding a Merle to another Merle.
BorderCollie,35ugt1,jcatleather,2,Wed May 13 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"great Dane owner here and can verify.  lethal white is common with breeders striving for Harlequin, which is a heterozygote of TWO semi-lethal dilution genes. I dont recall all the specifics, but eyes and ears evolved in mammals involving hair follicles.  When pigment is lacking, ear structures and eyes can be affected, and sometimes other things.  The cause of death is not fully understood, but it also happens in other species such as paint horses. In general, its pretty deplorable to breed spot to spot and not ideal to breed merles at all."

He loves his tennis balls as well but if he hears the word ""WALK"", he'll drop the tennis ball, drop the treats, drop the belly rub, and run straight to the door in anticipation of a walk with dad. Walks also help bond you with the dog and he begins to trust you more and starts looking at you as the pack leader. Its not just enough to play with them to tire them out, you MUST WALK THEM A LOT! Especially a new rescue who may act out because he's unsure of who and what are around him. Nothing heals the soul of a dog like a good walk.  TLDR; Walk him dammit :)"

BorderCollie,35bexl,kragdoc,2,Fri May 8 22:35:51 2015 UTC,One word of advice I remember being given by the vet when we got our first BC was to be careful of the swallowing tennis balls. On average their mouths/throats are possibly big enough for it to get stuck if they jump and catch a ball that's falling quite steeply. It's just something to be aware of I think.
BorderCollie,35bexl,aveldina,2,Fri May 8 23:22:13 2015 UTC,"Did I mention he loves tennis balls?   Awesome! Remember you can use tennis balls as a reward then just like you would use treats.    He'll also ""dance"" on his hind legs by command. Meh, that's more of a circus trick and I don't know if we'll continue it.   It's actually good for more than just a circus trick! Standing on hind legs builds core, back and hind end strength. If he likes to play fetch, having lots of core and back strength is really good for helping them avoid injury with those quick and sudden direction changes that they do when playing fetch. So it doesn't hurt to keep the trick and use it occasionally for maintaining strength. Don't over do it of course.   he usually gets a cup of generic Kibbles and Bits in the evening, but with the added exercise he'll be getting I think I'll start giving him breakfast as well.   Many dogs do need food twice a day to balance out their energy need more evenly during the course of the day. Kibbles and Bits is a really poor quality food though.... so if you are able/willing to move him up to anything better, it would be worth it. Remember to switch gradually."
BorderCollie,35bexl,aveldina,1 point,Sun May 10 02:31:37 2015 UTC,"We mixed in a better food with his generic. I think he picked out the good stuff and left the crap stuff.  I also suspect he's been hit in the past, and more than once. We were out in the front yard when someone walked by with their Yorkie.  He was on leash but tried to ""protect"" me from the Yorkie.  I put my hand down to pet him and calm him and he flinched away from me as if I was going to hit him.  Makes me so sad."
BorderCollie,35bexl,theoldbloke,2,Sun May 10 03:36:34 2015 UTC,"Some very soft border collies will react that way even if they have never been hit in their lives, so it is hard to say... You never really know!   He was on leash but tried to ""protect"" me from the Yorkie.   He might be leash reactive, as opposed to trying to protect you. If you find you are having more trouble with it in the future, look up leash reactivity in dogs and you'll get lots of helpful articles such as this one. Dr Sophia Yin's website has good content on the topic too.  It's good that you were looking to calm him though! Some people react negatively or with anger.. and it usually makes the dog's behavior worse. :/"

He'll cheerfully sell his soul for ""just one more throw"". Get one of those plastic ""thrower"" things - basically a long stick that lets you flick the ball long distances - great exercise for him with minimum effort from you.  On his ""protection aggression"": having had two BCs with the same problem, my own experience has been that such behaviour is very, very difficult (but not impossible) to change if a BC wasn't socialized with other dogs as a puppy. It may take years.  I give my 9-year old BC a small handful of dried food for ""breakfast"" to tide him over until dinner.  The best of luck to you both; I wish you and Nico many happy years together. Oh, and please post pics!"
BorderCollie,35bexl,saintoaks,1 point,Mon May 11 15:45:32 2015 UTC,"Did I mention he loves tennis balls? Holy shit...   We got our BC from a breeder. Her dog, Echo, is crazy about balls. It seems that every BC has one 'thing', whether it's balls, herding, or in our (lucky) case, cuddles.   My advice would be to allow Nico to play with balls as a reward, and not to overdo it and 'play into' any potential obsession.   With regards walks, we find Zoe (our dog, about 8 months old) is fine with a ~1 hour walk every day, having started much smaller than that initially. You're supposed to walk them gradually more as they get older, at (10 mins) + 5 per month. (We can't find an actual primary reference for this, it just seems to be taken at face-value. I mean, is that total? Per walk? If so, how many daily? Says who?)  Anyway, she's knackered by 10PM every day with that plus a half-hour play at lunch, then at weekends we'll often take her somewhere more interesting! I offer her a walk at lunch but she seems to prefer to play. I think a walk per se isn't terrible stimulating unless there's something interesting about it. I've seen a couple of threads on here where folk walk them loads and don't understand why they're not knackered. I would recommend loads of interesting toys or whatnot, though. If you've finished a jar of peanut butter, it makes an amazing treat for them to lick off the remainder, as long as it's not too much and you're not worried they'll bit the glass too hard.   Personally, my main advice would be: don't worry about the horror stories and just be sensible, I think they're there to scare off people a bit. We got sick of everyone we met saying 'Oh, Collie's: lot of work, very demanding' in a stern tone. You never get 'Oh, Collie's: very adaptable. They'll get used to anything'. A woman at the vet's went 'You need to walk her at least 2 hours a day', which is patent bollocks. I understand why people like to instil respect for collie ownership, but I also think there's a slight morbid enjoyment in scaring new owners."

Never leave it lying about or even within reach.  The only way she gets to play with it is when you allow the play with you participating.  If she doesn't bring it back, turn and walk away.   Good luck!"
BorderCollie,354x8f,WorldSailorToo,3,Thu May 7 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"Your plan of negative punishment (not playing with her when she bolts) should work quite well. Mine gets SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THE BALL, DID YOU KNOW IT BOUNCES?! So when she's not listening we just stop all play and training for a minute until she calms the fuck down. She gets it pretty damn fast, you can see her trying to control herself and listen, rather than fixating on the ball.   Mine's 13months old."
BorderCollie,354x8f,TacticalVulpix,1 point,Thu May 7 10:27:43 2015 UTC,"Oh my, that sounds cute. My BC pup is only 5 months but she's the same way with balls. It's kind of fun to have something so rewarding, though, to use it in cases where she's not listening (she always runs right into our roommates room every time we come back inside, but I can say ""Where's your ball?"" and she's glued to me. We do need to work on her manners, though, but this has been our stopgap measure for the time being)."
BorderCollie,354x8f,HuntingtonPeach,3,Thu May 7 15:51:43 2015 UTC,"She is adorable! Since you say that the frisbee also works as a good motivator for her, you could also turn this around. You can practice getting her to heel with increasing distractions and increasing distance but keeping her on a long lead. And each time she comes back, you can play frisbee."
BorderCollie,354x8f,SplooshMagoosh,1 point,Thu May 7 13:45:02 2015 UTC,"those are all great idea's. Thankyou for your input.  I think i will be keeping the frisbee with me as much as possible so she won't bolt down to the yard.  to say that she only obsesses with the frisbee would be a understatement.  She can be a freak with anything that can be thrown...This is my fault in that teaching her to fetch very early on and as a new trainer not being aware of the obsessiveness she could exhibit.  I work in a wood mill as well and bring her to work often.  she always has a stick in her mouth and is begging everybody to throw it...But still i have had great sucess in teaching her sit stay's, rollovers and touch, deliver to hand(which took alot of time to get right) sit pretty and bang play dead(still working on)vaulting off knee and back(hurts trainer and is not really good for dogs under 18 months because of growth plates not fully formed)spin and twist(working on)and leg weaves to dog catches...i have been really slacking off latly with obedience training in terms of click and treat training but am looking to get re motivated...I really would like to concentrate on proofing everything i have taught her before moving on....anyways im rambling now so again thanks for the input...everybody said it would be hard to have a border collie but i could not have it any other way.  I have never thought about it as ""hard"" but that i ""get"" to take care of her..."
BorderCollie,353gy7,irishfeet78,11,Wed May 6 20:05:49 2015 UTC,"I foster for a BC rescue, and have adopted three BCs myself over the years, so maybe I can help? Ok, the best thing to do is to sit down with your family/spouse before the dog arrives and agree on some rules (will he be allowed on the couch or not? etc...), and then decide on how you're going to be consistent. BCs need that consistency. They are the quintessential 'give an inch/take a mile' dog, and they'll push their boundaries when they can.   A few really basic things I do when I get a new BC is: 1) end the cycle of 'free feeding' if it's in place. You have the food and the power to feed, therefore you are boss. I also set up a regular feeding time (or two), and I don't allow my BCs to be in the kitchen when I'm in there. They can come in to eat and drink, but never when I'm cooking. 2) Hang a bell on the door, and teach him how to ring it when he wants to go outside to pee. Not for walks, but just for relieving himself. ALWAYS respond to it, even if you think he hit it accidentally with his tail or something. 3) Crate train! Give him a space that's just for him. Make sure no one bugs him when he chooses to go in there, and never use it as punishment. 4) No human food!  And my favourite... 5) I always teach my BCs not to go through a door/gate/whatever until I've gone through first. He needs to wait until you tell him it's ok to come through. Not only is this good for a bit of subtle dominance, it's also a good safety thing, too!  Have fun, be prepared to be amazed and amused, and enjoy your new, sexy calves from all the walking you'll be doing! :)"
BorderCollie,353gy7,bynL,4,Wed May 6 22:20:22 2015 UTC,"Excellent! Thank you!  He is crate trained, but his current owners no longer use a crate. I'm picking one up today/tomorrow.  He is also bell trained at the door, and I already have bells on the door, so that's solved.    That's a good point on the door.  I'll do that for sure.  I've already sat the kids down and let them know the only person to take the dog for a walk is mom and dad - they don't get to.   I also plan to not let him out unsupervised, even in the fenced yard.   I'd feel safer that way, and plus that will cut down on the potential for digging!  I hope..."
BorderCollie,353gy7,bynL,1 point,Wed May 6 22:58:57 2015 UTC,"Well you're pretty much good to go - excellent! And yeah, I hear you about the digging. Our current BC is a digging maniac, so in order to curb it, we taught her how to dig and stop digging on command. That way she gets to do it, and we get a yard."
BorderCollie,353gy7,foronceplease,2,Thu May 7 00:30:30 2015 UTC,"I'll add that BCs are typically not good dogs to take to dog parks. I leash walk/run mine and she stays on-leash because she is super herdy and annoys the heck out of other dogs and has scars on her muzzle from tussles with other animals she received before I adopted her. She is fearless and will not back down if challenged. Just saying you will want to carefully gauge your dog's sociability before having it meet other dogs.    We split her food into 4 portions a day because she eats so fast sometimes she was getting sick with it split into 2 portions. I also put an upside down bowl in her bowl to try to slow her down. :-)  All said, BCs are remarkable dogs/companions if you do some simple things right as /u/bynL laid out. Congratulations!"
BorderCollie,353gy7,bynL,2,Thu May 7 13:26:04 2015 UTC,"An upside-down bowl! Huh, never thought of that one. I usually use a cookie sheet, or put a couple of tennis balls in the bowl to slow down the 'hoovers', but an upside down bowl would work, too. Thanks for the idea!"
BorderCollie,353gy7,foronceplease,2,Thu May 7 14:48:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's like a glass ingredient bowl... it works well enough. We have a ball that she rolls around too that slowly dispenses food which we usually use if we have to give her 2/4 portions cause we were gone for 8 hours or something (1 normal, 1 in the ball). She likes the ball - we should probably use it more."
BorderCollie,353gy7,jtlb44,2,Thu May 7 16:12:15 2015 UTC,A BC just fell into my lap this week. Thanks for the help
BorderCollie,353gy7,EvaPeron,3,Thu May 21 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"Just watch him with small children until he is fully trained. When our BC was younger he would try to herd me and my siblings when we ran. We thought it was hilarious. Our friends that weren't used to would sometimes get freaked out haha. Also, no human food! It does not go over well...  My childhood BC is 16 years old this year. He's a good boy!"
BorderCollie,353gy7,celica18l,3,Wed May 6 23:44:00 2015 UTC,They're 7 and 9 (he's 6) and have been told to leave him be for the first few weeks. Will definitely watch for the herding instinct!
BorderCollie,353gy7,dockingrockets,3,Wed May 6 23:48:37 2015 UTC,"Consistency. Be very very consistent from day one. My 3 year old BC likes the routine. My husband will baby her and let her get on the couch with him or crawl in his lap and she sees him as an equal so she won't work for him like she does me.   I always crate train. She doesn't sleep in it at night anymore she did for the first two years but now I'm comfortable enough that she won't get into trouble. I would crate train for quite some time at night and always 100% while you are not at home. These pups can get destructive and stressed out if they are bored or left alone. Don't give them the opportunity to get into mischief.   We don't always get the change to exercise her physically everyday but we do her mind all day long by hiding toys around the house. I also make her go find the kids, my husband, or the other dog throughout the day to keep her busy. Usually by the time I get my kids in bed she's passed out on the floor exhausted.   I love this breed so very much. They are forever pretty much like toddlers. Curious and full of energy."
BorderCollie,353gy7,nekineznanec,1 point,Thu May 7 01:07:46 2015 UTC,"I'm going to keep him crate trained from the beginning - he's gotten lax on it from what I understand, so it may be a transition for him.  Even our Irish Setter was destructive if left to his own devices, so I expect the same (if not more) of this guy, especially in a new house.  Thankfully, I telecommute so someone will be home with him pretty much all of the time, and we are walking distance from the kids' school so he'll get plenty of walks to/from school.  I like the ""hide and seek"" idea.  We'll use that for sure."
BorderCollie,353gy7,dockingrockets,4,Thu May 7 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"My wife and I sort of accidentally ended up with our BC. First dog as a couple (I've had several growing up, her first ever). There is some great advice already posted, and I'd say to look that over and start with that.  One thing I think my wife and I didn't do was be super strict with her. Perhaps a mistake, but it's luckily worked out just fine. We allow her full run of the house, but she still has a little area with a dog bed and all that. She spends most of her time there when we aren't home, but she can go lay on the couch  if she wants as well. House training was never much of an issue...   These dogs are very smart and it only took a couple of accidents as a puppy to learn to go outside. Now we're at the point where she can just stand there looking at me and I know she needs outside. Try to learn to read your dog, it helps a ton to just know certain looks and body language. Anyways, my point is that they are exceptionally smart dogs so I think you can (if you decide to) allow them maybe a little more freedom than some other breeds, while still understanding that they are also very energetic and have certain needs to keep them content and out of trouble.   Personally, I treat mine like a true member of the family. She knows her basic commands very, very well. But I never bothered with the more novelty ones that don't serve a purpose other than my own amusement. She's allowed (almost) anywhere in the house including my bed and the couch. And we do feed her table scraps (healthy ones) from time to time. We've ended up with a very loyal, smart, mostly very obedient, protective dog.  I think whether you go strict or a little more easy going, with their intelligence, it's hard to go wrong. The key is consistency. Consistency. Consistency."
BorderCollie,353gy7,brianwood65,3,Wed May 6 23:26:07 2015 UTC,"But I never bothered with the more novelty ones that don't serve a purpose other than my own amusement.   This is so untrue. Teaching dogs tricks is probably the BEST way to occupy them mentally and give them the stimulation they require. This is even more true for border collies. Learning trick is very enjoyable play time for them. The dogs gets to interact with you on a much more intimate level then just petting.  Thinking that dogs need just physical exercise is so very wrong, every dog, but BC especially require tons of mental stimulation, which includes toys liek kangs, or fun treat dispensers they can learn to crack, but mostly and foremostly having  you work with them.   Besides ""tricks"" don't have do be you dog doing a handstand, or chasing their tail. You can teach your dog to get a specific toy, or teach your dog to close doors, or teach your dog to clean up his toys, or to not run out of your yard. Literally anything. I feel you are vastly underestimating the intellect of your dog. You can teach him anything, if you put your mind to it. Even talking. Dogs are wwwaaay smarter than you'd think.  Another important thing about BC is that some may be fine just lounging and going on walks, but many wont. Because they are such an active breed they require equal parts ""brain activity"". And many BC that have been neglected on that front turn out neuritic, depressed and just bad dogs.  The last thing I'd like to say is that, you must realise that dogs are dogs. No matter how much you'd want to feel they are like kids, in the end they are dogs. They have no notion of things being humiliating. Him doing a handstand while barking The Star-Spangled Banner will be just as fun to the dog as him shaking your hand. That part is in your head.   So all in all, OP I'd advise not listening to this guy. Also, I'd advise not to listen to me. Read up on as many sources as you can, watch as many videos as you can. Talk to experts in your shelter, and local BC owners. And then... Draw your own conclusions. There's no better way.  Also as a final note. 6 years old is by no measure too old to start training new things. Your dog might learn slower than a puppy would, but he'll still learn.  lastly, check out ""kikopup"" and ""kristin crestejo"" on youtube. These girls know their dogs and make amazing videos.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUXvRAsL5Q41h-KkhbNY3_w"
BorderCollie,353gy7,Kimchidiary,4,Thu May 7 07:39:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you misunderstood what I meant by ""novelty"" tricks, and ones that actually serve a purpose. She can retrieve several items on command, search for certain people, get cats back inside the house...  Lots of stuff useful stuff that serves a purpose and she enjoys doing. By ""novelty"" tricks I meant shaking a paw, rolling over, and things like that. First, I don't want to treat my dog like a circus performer. And second, I know my dog well, and she would have no interest in this kind of thing. Very much more of a retrieval type.   It's also worth noting that not every dog is the same. Assuming every dog of the same breed needs or even wants the same things isn't reasonable. Mine for example very much enjoys bring a lazy ball of fur and snoring for hours, but is ready for action anytime."
BorderCollie,353gy7,pause_and_consider,2,Thu May 7 12:35:34 2015 UTC,"For me, my border collie was just a natural. Honestly, I didn't need to do much training for him outside of bathroom training and he's been incredibly obedient. He's picked basic commands up on his own (I'm not that type of person that likes to train my dog to do all kinds of crazy stuff I love the companionship as opposed to master/trainer type thing) and he's been my best friend. BCs are very smart too. They know how to listen and one thing I maybe regret is that I didn't have a bigger yard to take him too and let him run around in. Dog parks, the bigger the better, are your friend and you can tell just how content they are when they get back from a long run. BCs are fantastic dogs I've come to find that they don't need much teaching before they learn which has been great. Very smart too!"

It's just one of those things that happens with fetch because it's such a high intensity/quick turning exercise.  Maybe looking for options for exercise besides fetch might be wise? Do you have a place where you can walk her off leash? Maybe carry the ball with you to reward recalls but only for that?
BorderCollie,34u91a,Itsabeautifuldaytobe,3,Mon May 4 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about it. I don't buy that crap that border collies always need to have room to run and roam, thus making it impossible for them to live in an apartment. These dogs need more MENTAL exercise than physical and they're one of the most adaptable breeds when you take precautions. If he's already barking at people from the window, etc, that's not an apartment issue. That's an issue right now. Just take the steps to be prepared and everything will be fine. But most of all, RELAX and don't buy into the myth that a border collie can't live just fine in an apartment. I know plenty of people who do it currently with no issue."

BorderCollie,34ey57,aveldina,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:15:15 2015 UTC,"This matches my experience. Our border collie mix had been in a foster home for over a year. He was the problem dog that everyone loves but no one would adopt because he was so hyper and sometimes reactive to other dogs. The rescue didn't think we would be a good fit for him because we don't have a fenced in yard.  We finally convinced the rescue to let us foster to adopt. He was pretty hyper when we brought him home. We walked the heck out of him. We played with him all the time. None of that exercise ever seemed to tire him out. It actually seemed to make things worse.   It turns out, the poor guy was just anxious. I started randomly giving him a treat whenever he was relaxing quietly. I worked on his reactivity issues by getting him to look at me and giving him a treat when we saw another dog. If I needed to restrain him, I crouched down next to him and gave him a side hug, gently holding him back by his chest. That way I didn't increase his stress by yanking on the leash.   After a few months, he became a different dog. He sleeps all day. He still gets 2-3 long walks per day, but we barely hear from him in between."

BorderCollie,344plf,Kyanpe,11,Tue Apr 28 07:42:50 2015 UTC,"It depends on how dedicated you really are to the puppy. Can you spare a couple of hours every day for training and exercise? The reason they aren't recommended as first dogs is because first time dog owners don't realise how much work it is just to look after any kind of dog, let alone a working dog. You can't just have a break either, this is a 15 year, 2 hour a day commitment you are making.  If you've never raised a puppy before it might be a good idea to foster some dogs first. It's only temporary but you will have an idea of what caring for a dog is like."
BorderCollie,344plf,hydroplaen,5,Tue Apr 28 09:47:12 2015 UTC,"Love and attention only go so far. All breeds have their quirks and specific needs, and a certain lifestyle that suits them best. Yes, BCs are smart, but that intelligence comes at a price - they are always doing, doing, doing. Give them a job or they will become self-employed. BCs were not bred to be companions - they are one of man's greatest working partners and we put that desire to work into them, and reinforced it tenfold. So any owner not willing to accommodate that is doing their dog a disservice.  You said you wanted a puppy. I suggest taking a look at this site, maybe getting in to touch with a BC-specific rescue. If you clear the hurdle of being able to foster a BC, it will grant you experience with the breed without the commitment of ownership. I'd advise this ""trial run"" approach for you as this would be your first dog, and there's a lot of questions up in the air. However, seeing as you have not previously owned a dog, I am not sure you would be eligible for fostering. Perhaps volunteering at a shelter could be more feasible.  The only circumstance that would mean you handing a puppy over to a shelter would be you being woefully unprepared (which would be your fault), and the breeder from which you bought the puppy being a poor choice. You do not strike me as the type who would jump into this with both feet and no prep work, so strike that from your list of concerns."
BorderCollie,344plf,potato_is_meat,2,Tue Apr 28 11:11:43 2015 UTC,"Seconding this, OP. Fostering is a great way to see if this is the breed for you, if you can find an agency that will let you do it. Sometimes they're like ""You work out of the home! You don't have a dog door! You are the worst, wurrrggh!""   Also seconding, ""Give them a job or they will become self-employed."" Lol. I tell people this all the time. :) That being said, my BCs are way more biddable than my corgi. If they have a partnership with you toward some task you are accomplishing together, they will throw their little doggie hearts into it 110%.  If you go the puppy route, make sure you have a contract with the breeder. Responsible breeders of any breed want the dog to come back to the breeder if there is ANY issue."
BorderCollie,344plf,obsessedwithmydog,5,Tue Apr 28 15:58:06 2015 UTC,"As this is your first dog, let alone Border Collie, I recommend that you seriously consider adoption (1+ year old) instead of getting a puppy - especially if you are going to be leaving it for 8hrs/day. You simply can't do that with/to a puppy. Puppies need direction and attention when learning critical things like potty training and socialization that someone working a full time job simply cannot provide and frankly daycare is not any better because they won't be able to give your puppy the attention it will need. Not trying to sound pessimistic but to me when bringing a pet into your life, you need to consider the needs of the pet ahead of your wants; if you do that everything will be all good. There are plenty of Border Collie Rescues that know a lot about the dogs they find homes for and likely have the perfect dog to fit your lifestyle. My wife and I rescued our BC. She was 3 when we got her. At the time we thought it would be great having a puppy but we just knew we didn't have the time to raise a puppy. We found a BC that was low-medium energy and she fits our lifestyle perfectly. It's important to note that not all Border Collies are Frisbee freaks or love fly-ball or agility courses. Ours, for instance, is a serial herder. She will only play tug of war with my wife or me but nothing else really. If another animal or quick moving human is around she is 110% business and tries to herd them. That's what she is passionate about."
BorderCollie,344plf,foronceplease,4,Tue Apr 28 12:37:52 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your living situation.  I am fortunate enough to have a huge lawn & I can take my two BCs to work with me every day.  If you plan on leaving them at home for 8+ hours a day, you might not want a BC."
BorderCollie,344plf,PluckyPlucker,2,Tue Apr 28 12:58:36 2015 UTC,agreed.
BorderCollie,344plf,rollingdownthestreet,3,Tue Apr 28 17:43:06 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have done a lot of research about Border Collies and have put quite a bit of thought into this. My boyfriend and I got a Border Collie as our first puppy together (although we both had dogs growing up) and we have never been happier. We did rearrange our schedules so we can play with her or walk her at least every 4 hours during the week (one of us would take a long lunch). We would also do doggy day care or have a friend come over if we both had an 8-12 hr day. The positives of my BC way outweigh those small drawbacks. She is so smart and all she wants to do is please you. I will never have anything but a BC for the rest of my life. So if you really want a BC and you've done the research, get the dog."
BorderCollie,344plf,hbard23,3,Tue Apr 28 10:52:46 2015 UTC,"but also really smart.   Just make sure you are in love with this for the right reasons. If you are interested in advanced trick training, dog sports like agility, disc dog or flyball, or herding sheep then you'll be very happy to have a smart dog.  Getting a smart dog because it will be ""easy to train"" basic obedience is not wise. Any dog is easy to train given enough experience with dog training. Border collies do need more than basic obedience as they are not just easy to train, they WANT to work.  Do you like the outdoors? Can you provide daily exercise, in particular off leash exercise? Leash walking every day is not enough for many border collies. Do you have access to a safe location where you could play frisbee or fetch with your border collie? Are you willing to learn about positive, marker based dog training?  We added lots of links to the side bar for exactly this reason so check them out! :)"
BorderCollie,344plf,aveldina,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:33:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not concerned about how easy it would be to train him.  I want to be able to teach him to do cool stuff.  For example, there was a video recently of a border collie who learned to play ping pong.  Stuff like that is what makes me like this breed so much.  They're little geniuses!  And no, I'm not very active myself, but I would take him for walks, play Frisbee...stuff like that.  I'd probably bring him to doggy daycare when I go to work.  Plus finding cool tricks to teach him would be great mental stimulation."
BorderCollie,344plf,aveldina,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"It is good to know then that teaching advanced tricks does require quite a bit of learning on your part - you need to learn about ""shaping"" specifically and how to do it. And it takes a LOT of time, but little bits of time over long periods. Really cool tricks often take 6months to years to perfect because the dog has to develop the strength and body awareness to do the trick first and you have to very gradually work through teaching them how to do the trick.  A lot of border collies really like disc work, and it combines nicely with advanced tricks as Madlene demos here. You probably will need some instruction on how to teach tricks if you have never done it before. There are lots of good online classes. Local classes can be a bit harder to find but if you look at groups that are into sports like agility many also offer tricks classes.  So as long as you're willing to do lots of trick training, say 5-10 minutes a day stretched over long amounts of time then yes you can get those really cool tricks and border collies love to learn them. If you don't have plenty of patience for the ""work in progress"" that tricks teaching can be, maybe a BC isn't the best fit.   And no, I'm not very active myself   Well, you might need to change that. :) Do you have an hour of your life every single day you can set aside for your dog? Border collies really do need off leash walking in addition to on leash. Do you have off leash or dog parks near by you could go to? You might only be walking for say 40 minutes but I say an hour because most of us in the city have to drive to off leash parks so that takes time too. Doggy daycare is great but it can be quite expensive so many people can't afford to take their dog multiple days per week."
BorderCollie,344plf,KestrelLowing,2,Tue Apr 28 20:02:30 2015 UTC,"I don't own a border collie - I'm in the same boat you are.  Interested, but unsure if I could meet a BC's needs.  The first thing I'd do is try to find people who actually own border collies and go and meet their dogs.  If you can meet several people who own border collies, you can see what the general personality of the border collie is.   And you can ask their owners how much time/effort they put in."
BorderCollie,344plf,neroli90,2,Tue Apr 28 12:25:39 2015 UTC,"Our first dog is a border collie. She is now ten years old, smart and loyal dog. Couldn't pick better.   You could be successsful, but you need to be strick. Also our dog didn't go to school/training and she knows everything. She is a very quick learner."
BorderCollie,344plf,sharkwench,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:08:51 2015 UTC,"If you are committed and determined then you can do it. When I was 8 my family got our first dog. My parents had never had a dog before, we knew no one with a dog let alone having ever experienced a border collie. It was hard but we made it work. Since I was 8 and my brother was 12 at the time, we took care of having enough energy to play with our lively puppy, while our parents took the lions share of the training/walking/feeding.   The thing with border collies is that although they can be quite..particular and require a lot of attention, they are also really smart so they are easily trained and settle very well into a routine. You can have one border collie who was raised as a puppy on a farm who ran around fields all day and another raised with a couple who work 9-5 Mon-Fri and either stays at home in those times alone or dayboards at the kennels. Dog A will use his energy gradually throughout the day. Dog B will need 3 hours of concentrated exercise, attention and play when you get home from work. And no, if you've had a tough day at work you CANNOT shirk your responsibilities. Oh, is there a hurricane outside? Too bad; because your clever border collie knows that 5:30pm is walkie time and won't let you get away with waiting for the storm clouds to pass. Those dogs will know their individual routines and boundaries, but if you swap their lifestyles they will become extremely difficult dogs. It's all about being firm and persistent right from the word go. If you do that you can essentially build the dog you want for your lifestyle.   Honestly though, if you've never had a puppy of any kind, then ANY breed will be difficult so what does it mean to you that one is harder than another? Puppies are difficult. You need to think of them like children. All this time out your day that it requires to have a dog sounds like a chore, but when it's your own you will create a bond and you will WANT to do all those things for them."

BUT, you need to be absolutely dedicated to exercising them physically and mentally. Signing them up for different training classes, agility, herding...they always need to be learning. We never leave ours alone for more than 4-5 hours, even coming home at lunch to walk and play. They are not lap dogs. They're working dogs that require constant interaction. The payoff is big, though."

BorderCollie,340z7p,xcitu,4,Mon Apr 27 13:20:29 2015 UTC,"I got a couple of advices.  He is VERY different from a labrador, believe me. You have to use him. Challenge him, make him work. Make his brain tick. Or else you'll end up with a dog that will damage its surroundings, go crazy, damage himself and others. If they don't use their energy, they eventually ""boil over"" and go nuts. One example can be light&shadow chasing, this is something you NEVER want on a BC. If he starts to notice them, then you have to train him to not do it. (Also, NEVER ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever EVER think about using a laserpointer on the ground with him, do that and he's screwed for life)  I'm using mine in Rally Obedience (Went up from class 2 to class 3 yesterday! :D) and started training him to be a Search and rescue dog (find people by smell in the air, tracking, search in ruins etc).   The second advice is that you have to tell him when to stop. When you're playing, YOU have to stop playing with him and tell him it's enough. Why? Cause he will run till he dies. They love working so much that they will run until they collapse and die.   When you train him, you need to control him. He's so smart and got so much energy, that if he doesn't get an outlet for it, he will start doing things himself.   Teach him basic commands like sit, come, stay (the most important ones) and have him be EXTREMLY good at it, then you'll have a very easy dog to live with.   I never stop teaching him sit, come, stay. When I'm out for a walk, I let him loose and let him run and I call him in maybe 5-10 times each time I go out. Call in, sit next to me, go out. Next time, call in, sit, stay, go 10 feet infront, come, sit, run. The important part is that you call him in a hundred times, and on only 1 of those calls you put the leach on him. Then he learns that come usually means ""YEAH, I can run again if I just come in and sit"", not ""Oh.. he calls for me, how boring, now I have to go in a leash and I don't want that so I think I'll just do my own thing"".   I could probably write a book about what to do, but these are the best tips I can think of right out of the top of my head. Enjoy, he will love you to death. :)"

BorderCollie,33jck1,Fol_Fol,2,Wed Apr 22 23:57:35 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if that schedule would suffice in being with the dog and exercising it, or if I should go with a different breed/what breed?   The challenge with border collies is more about consistency and their need for exercise that is off leash, since a leash walk for many border collies is basically nothing. :) So as long as you enjoy going outside, no matter what the weather (as long as it is safe of course!) you would be fine. But if you are the kind of person who would rather stay indoors if it is cold or rainy outside, you might want to go with a breed that would be happier with that option!  There are some very good links in the side bar you should check out for more information.   Also, should I get a puppy or look more towards adult ones, and rescue dog or from a breeder?   This depends on what you are looking for? If you have never raised a puppy and are not completely comfortable with putting in a LOT of work and time to train, socialize, and raise a puppy then you might be better off looking at an adult rescue.  There is a common myth that all rescue dogs are in some way ""broken"" but that is definitely not the case. Especially with border collies there are really great dogs in rescue through no fault of their own, other than they had too much energy or their owner's living situation changed. My older BC is from a rescue and he is a fantastic dog (we love him dearly!) and since adopting him we've fostered 4 more border collies or border collie mixes and they have all been wonderful dogs.  There are lots of breed rescues in North America if that is where you are? Why not check out one near by and see if they have any dogs you are interested in?"
BorderCollie,33jck1,aveldina,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:27:18 2015 UTC,"Emphasis on going outside no matter the weather. If it's not super rainy, we'll be at the dog park 3-4 times a week. Other people walk their dogs right by and look at us funny for stomping in the mud, but they don't understand. The park is more than just fun, but a necessity for us."
BorderCollie,33jck1,booomfox,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:50:17 2015 UTC,"Every dog is different, and that's true for any breed. The brother to my girl from the same litter is apparently very cuddly and quiet; my girl is more aloof and quite the barker. With puppies you never really know what you're going to get, though you can tell quite a bit if you can watch the litter grow up or even just spend some time with them before you take yours home. But still, you never know what quirks they just haven't shown yet.  If you get an older dog from a rescue, the foster parent will be able to tell you a lot about exactly what you're getting. And an older dog might be easier for you as a first-time BC owner since puppies are, or usually are, especially destructive and energetic.  How many hours will the dog be alone on average, or what's the longest they'd be alone on any given day? It sounds like your schedule is fine, but I personally wouldn't want to leave a puppy alone, even in a crate, for more than 4 hours or so, at least until they've shown they have the bladder control to do that.  But I, like you, have always wanted a Border Collie and just got her this past February, as a 9 week old pup. I absolutely adore her, even if she isn't quite what I was hoping for (more cuddly). I'm so happy I finally have a BC after wanting one since I was a kid, and if you've always wanted one, I think you'll love having one, too :)"
BorderCollie,33jck1,HuntingtonPeach,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:11:26 2015 UTC,Saturday and sunday are the only two days where the dog would be alone for 6-7 hours. every other day 3-4 tops.

BorderCollie,33iyuu,bendydickcumonmybapz,3,Wed Apr 22 22:10:23 2015 UTC,"Be mindful that some puppies will literally go forever, there is no amount that will tire them out. Some need to be taught to settle and relax when there is nothing to do - it's okay for them to be bored sometimes if they are getting a normal amount of exercise! They do have to learn too that they don't need to be crazy ALL of the time (nor is that healthy either). You can teach and reward a settle if you have done plenty of exercising for the day and are ready for some down time.  If you are looking to get into sports you should check out Silvia Trkman's puppy program, I followed this program with my puppy (via the online class, before the DVD) and I absolutely love it. She is super easy to train for agility now since she learned so many body awareness tricks and agility foundation tricks (like 2on/2off, stays, sending) when she was little. It's a really great program and worth checking out. I've never actually seen border collies doing Schutzhund? The border collie association in Canada does not approve of conformation and since my BC is registered through them we don't do anything with conformation (nor would my breeder be happy about it hah!).  We mostly did tricks from 3-5 months and supervised play sessions with friend's dogs. After that we started doing a lot more off leash walking but still shorter lengths (<40 minutes) until 6 months and then after that I haven't limited off leash walking time at all."
BorderCollie,33iyuu,aveldina,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:17:56 2015 UTC,"He definitely knows how to settle -- when he goes back in his pen he just lays around watching the world or goes to sleep, I was just making sure that what I was doing wasn't going to be too much for him, because it's hard to tell when they don't stop or tell you when they've had enough.  I will definitely check out that link for sure!  Why is the BC association in Canada against conformational showing? My BC is registered through my state's kennel club, hence why I can show him, but I won't bother if he won't be successful. My breeders would be happy for me to show and potentially gain different titles with their stock.   And there are not many Border Collie's that do Schutzhund, but there are some, and there is no restriction on what breed you do it with. He may not be cut out for it when we get to the protection stage, but regardless it is a very good program for obedience, focus and if he can't actually compete I won't regret having trained him for it."
BorderCollie,33iyuu,aveldina,2,Thu Apr 23 04:52:23 2015 UTC,"The Canadian Border Collie Association's statement on the matter is    ""As border collies should only be bred for their working ability breeding for appearance is strongly discouraged. Participation with border collies in conformation events is seen as contrary to the objectives of the Association and will void membership.""   My breeder has always been very supportive of their puppy owners like us in pursuing agility, but they don't use those titles to make breeding decisions.  There is a good documentary called Away to Me if you are ever curious to see more of the competitive herding side of the BC world.  I used to train obedience years ago with the local Schutzhund people here, but their training methods are very traditional (and involve no shortage of prong collars, leash corrections and forced retrieves). My youngest BC is really soft and would do awful with their training style. No one else here is doing it... so I've never even considered it with a non german shepherd dog to be honest! Agility keeps us crazy busy though. :)"
BorderCollie,33iyuu,forresto,2,Thu Apr 23 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"That's very interesting to see a different perspective!   And yeah I've seen the traditional way Schutzhund is trained but I can guarantee you I won't be doing any of the harsh training methods in the slightest with my BC as he is also quite soft. We're positive only, as it should be with most BC's since they do seem to be a very soft dog in general. This is why I say if he can't cut it I won't do it with him because I refuse to ever put something like a prong collar on my dogs.  Thanks for your input, and the links!"

BorderCollie,33c0qw,espressoristretto,9,Tue Apr 21 08:12:31 2015 UTC,"If a border collie is tired, a border collie is well behaved.  If you really execute your plan, you're going to have an amazing pet.   They are intelligent enough to learn from you, and understand when you set rules, boundaries and limitations.  Their amazing learned skills can go out the window if they get over-bored.  but remember, these are dogs that move sheep when they need to be moved, and relax on the hillside when all is well.   It is mental stimulus that they need, and what you describe is exactly what should work for a border collie. Also, remember, training routines,  puzzles, and mental stimulation are acceptable ways to make a dog ""mentally"" tired. if they get both mental, and physical stimulation, things are going to go well.   to answer your direct questions: There are short haired border collies, and they don't shed much.   BC's are not one person dogs, they have one leader and others are secondary, tertiary, etc.  I honestly think our BC likes my wife more than I, though she's amazingly cuddly with both of us, and seeks us both for affection and ""sitting near"" time. but if we both give a command, our BC will answer mine first.  Keep in mind, if you are not a BC's leader, then you are a badly behaved Pet to be dominated.  (your game plan would handle this nicely, just remember, rules. )  Both breeds are good pets, husky's shed amazing amounts, and are less adaptable to weird skill sets ( like hopping onto your raised knee and using it as a launching pad to catch a high flying Frisbee before landing, and giving you a high five before you give them a treat)  Huskies are very intelligent, but more...linear.   as an example, repeated behaviors more easily become commands with border collies. (which is good and bad). ""Scoot"" and ""fuck off"" are separate command words with our BC, and we weren't intentionally teaching them.  Scoot means move a few feet away to make room for someone, and fuck off means (at least) leave the room.  BC's are spooky smart  which is amazing and humbling to be around.   I'm going to repeat myself. A Tired border collie is a well behaved border collie.   another example: when she was young, our BC got a bit of separation anxiety when we went to work. this was solved by giving her a fairly complex puzzle ball of treats as we left. make the brain tired, and things get better.   I could rattle on for a long time, so feel free to PM if you have any questions.   I had a husky as a kid, and loved it, and it was a gentle, playful protector, it learned all the basic commands well, and did not go into 2 degree difficulty tricks. he was loyal, and asked for 2 walks a day, and my love.   I have a border collie now, and I am fascinated by what she can do, and how fast she learns, and she is loyal, and off leash trained (by almost accident) and all she asks is for a walk twice a day, and a puzzle ball, and our love.  They're both worthy. I just love the mental challenge of the BC."
BorderCollie,33c0qw,KazenDei,3,Tue Apr 21 14:39:44 2015 UTC,"I'll third /u/KazenDei post - it's a very well written account of a BC and owners.  I can't confirm enough that BC's are a wonderful breed, as I have two. I decided on two as after having the first male for over a year, I was out at work during the day and I wanted him to have a companion/playmate. Along came BC number two.  One thing I'd like to add to the 'list for BC owners' to know is that everyone is correct that they are a smart breed and they learn at the drop of a hat. I chose to treat train, so food was the reward for getting things right. In saying that, my two (whilst learning all the goodies) were still in 'puppy mode' until they were both about three years old.   In being so, we had the odd 'accident' of pillows being shredded, shoes being chewed and even an ipod charging cord being eaten whist it was plugged into the wall!! I think I know who that was, as he is very wary around power leads. My point is that even though the breed is smart, they will still be a handful for a couple of years. This is why I laughed out loud and nodded at ""If a border collie is tired, a border collie is well behaved."" This is the reason why.  In regards to the running, my girl can overheat sometimes during summer when she's running/ball chasing as she doesn't know when to call it quits. This breed will work to death when, in their mind, there is a job to be done. I know the signs now, being  foamy around the mouth and overly excessive breathing, so I shut down as soon as I see the signs. I say this as you run tri's and as much as the dog will stick with you - just make sure it's within its limits.  Being lucky enough to live near the beach, my two can't get enough of having a swim. In regards to their coats, they have a double layer. After a beach swim, I'll give them a good bath with shampoo and conditioner and their coast come up a treat. I have a long hair and a short hair so the comparison is the same. But as their coats pick up sand, you can wash and wash to when their coat is sparkling - but I always find that when they dry out, the finer sand stuck in the double coat will come out. I call my dogs fur teflon - as after a bath they'll settle on my floor boards and an hour later after getting up... I'll find sand in the spot where they sat. Every time :)  Lastly, I also recommend the treat ball (Kong) for when you leave the house. Not that I'm feeding up my dogs at every chance, but the play and reward system in their knocking, biting, shaking, kicking the Kong can go for hours. It will save the boredom for the dog and hopefully a pair of shoes for you.  Good luck with your decision. You sound switched on enough to respect the BC breed to be a great owner. Enjoy."
BorderCollie,33c0qw,snac,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:59:56 2015 UTC,"Ooh - thanks for the warning about overheating and the note about the treat ball! We hope to get a smooth-coat collie, but hey - you never know! Do your longhairs shed a lot? We don't mind shedding that much - it's the drool that we're not so keen on! Thanks again for all this - I'm sure we'll be coming back with advice regardless of what we end up with!"
BorderCollie,33c0qw,freckledcupcake,2,Sun Apr 26 18:32:39 2015 UTC,"I would second all of this.  A tired BC is a calm and well behaved BC. Running daily should be perfect for it! Every BC I've met has been very kid-friendly.  Mine, while not adoring our kiddo (1.5 yrs), will sometimes let her hug and snuggle him, and just walks away if it's all too much for him.    As for the 1-person dog, he definitely prefers me over anyone else, but still takes commands from my husband, sister, and mother.  He has some separation anxiety (thankfully not destructive, just howls for a while until he settles himself in a corner), which is hard to deal with.  I admit we probably don't get him as much exercise that he needs (he's a mix, so it's not quite so intense), which probably leads to the excess energy."

BorderCollie,33c0qw,aveldina,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:30:28 2015 UTC,"He barks when the doorbell rings, which drives me a bit nuts, but mostly because it wakes up the kid. Otherwise, only barks during playtime with other dogs. His anxiety/clomicalm meds have definitely helped his anxiety - seems to not be howling when we leave anymore! yay!"
BorderCollie,33c0qw,colliekris,2,Sun Apr 26 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Hahahaha we had a great time reading your post - especially the part about the commands you involuntary taught your BC's! Scary smart indeed! We'll take extra caution to train and raise our dog with special 'work' cut out for it (running and cani-cross being first in line) - and looking forward to teaching it some cool tricks, regardless of breed! But it strikes me that border collies take to this particularly well! We'll keep you posted, in any case!"
BorderCollie,33c0qw,JaderBug12,2,Sun Apr 26 18:25:19 2015 UTC,"as first-time dog owners we want to make the right decision as they have quite the reputation for being too intelligent for their own good and extra-hyper. Does anyone have any advice/suggestion about this?   It's true they have a reputation. They do end up in rescue/foster care often. The problem is that people get these dogs and then do not commit to doing something with them every day, they start to see behavioural problems and the dog gets surrendered. This is a rescuer from Glen Highland talking about it. and it's a good video to watch since you get an idea what all the fuss is about. To be honest though, this is more of an issue in north america, where people see a cute dog on TV and go out and get one while doing zero research. So since you've done the research and you're still interested, I am sure you are okay. :)   The reason we're thinking of getting a puppy is so that we can draw boundaries and set the rules from day one, rather than having to reprogram an already (potentially mis-) trained dog.   Sort of.. keep in mind that these dogs were probably with someone who also thought the same thing when they got them. So make sure if you are going the puppy route that you learn as much as you can about raising puppies so you don't make the same mistakes. Dr Sophia Yin's The Perfect Puppy is a fantastic book.   That said there are great rescue dogs out there that don't have ""issues"" either - dogs often end up in rescue through no fault of their own. The other upside to a rescue dog is not needing to wait out the puppy period before you can start running with your dog. So it's definitely worth considering. You could always watch rescue at the same time as you are doing your own searching for a puppy, and adopt if you find a rescue dog you like.  With puppies the biggest challenge will be entertaining your puppy through that time period where he/she is too young to do structured running with you. They can do off leash walks though once they are fully vaccinated, have a reliable recall and are old enough not to get trampled by other dogs. The other great option for entertaining puppies is tricks! and it's really amazing how quickly border collie puppies will pick up tricks. To be honest the only limit on your puppy's tricks is your skill as a teacher. There are lots of trick classes and DVDs out there if you need guidance, ideas or inspiration. Many of the best trick trainers use clickers and food (I just use my puppy's kibble!).  Also check out this video by Susan Garrett on coincidences in dog training as this will give you some foundational ideas on why some puppies grow up to be amazing adult dogs and others not so much ...environment has a huge influence.   +How much does a BC shed on a daily basis?   It depends on the dog and time of year. Many tend to ""blow"" their coats during which time they shed like crazy. The rest of the time it's fairly average for a double coated dog. I have short hair dogs and they still do shed but I find it easier to clean up.   +Are BC really one-person dogs? Can this be problematic?   No, not at all, but certainly if one person does the majority of the ""fun things"" then the dog will naturally be gravitated to that person. To be honest these days I believe less and less in the ""pack leader"" mentality. Dogs do what is reinforcing and they are very good at context. If one person tends to be more fun, then they usually prefer that person. If both people are completely consistent in upholding the rules, the dog will listen to both of them equally. Consistency really is everything in training dogs. My dogs listen to my partner as well as they do to me, and we both run them in agility. That said they generally are where ever I am in the house, since I do the most with them in terms of walking, training, playing, etc.    +BC/husky owners: would you recommend a Border Collie or a Husky for a first dog?   You are talking about two completely opposite breeds here. Do you want a dog who loves to work for you? Who will put in 110% effort working for you no matter what you ask? Who wants to be involved in EVERYTHING you do? You'll probably like a border collie.  If you want a more independent dog who isn't as demanding in terms of emotional needs from you, then you may prefer a husky. Do see the links listed in the side bar too for more information about border collies.  Agility is very popular over there so it is definitely something you would want to check out if you get a BC. They are fantastic dogs for agility and honestly the biggest challenge you will have is learning how to handle a fast dog in agility since fast dogs are much more demanding of their person in terms of accuracy and timing. :)   DO find someone who bases their training in positive reinforcement as border collies can be very soft dogs. They are willing to work hard for you and they do not need harsh training methods. Start training your recall right from day one and reinforce it very well (no matter what breed you get) and you will end up with an adult dog who has an awesome recall. Hopefully all of this helps?"
BorderCollie,33c0qw,camst8,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:02:53 2015 UTC,"Hello! Thanks every so much for taking the time to get back to us, and for all the useful resources! We've been making our way through canine psychology and puppy training books, while looking up dogs and talking to nearly everyone who walks past our house with a leashed friend! We have talked about it and are thinking much more about getting a rescue as our first dog - the amount of time and dedication that a puppy requires limits when we can actually pick one up, and depending on whether a little with our requirements can be met on time!  We're planning on clicker training and positive reinforcement training with any dog we get!   As for the discrepancy between the breeds, I'm after a husky (I'm female) and my partner, whose account this is, prefers a border collie, but we like each other's breeds as close seconds, if that makes sense. So let's see! I'm stubborner though :P"
BorderCollie,33c0qw,Fraser514,2,Sun Apr 26 18:46:14 2015 UTC,"As for shedding, it's almost impossible to give you s correct answer. The amount they shed is individual and based on how much undercoat they have. My own collie had a very thick, dense undercoat that seems content to multiple through billowing dust bunnies, no matter how much I sweep, vacuum, and furminate.   If you do get a collie, you have to understand that this breed is quirky as all get out, and it adds to that ""collieness."" They're smart, but they can be quicker to learn bad habits than good, but they want to please you badly. When most people tell me they want to get a collie, I almost always try and convince them otherwise. Especially first time owners. They can be a lot of dog for the inexperienced, but, if you're committed, look into a rescue collie and get an adolescent aged dog or up. They'll be less of a tornado and give you a better idea of what life is like with a border collie."
BorderCollie,33c0qw,colliekris,2,Wed Apr 22 19:40:21 2015 UTC,"Brilliant advice, thanks! I think, from all the research we've done and people we've talked to, that our first dog will almost certainly be a husky, but we're still deciding! We're looking to get a young dog rather than bitch, but we'll open! Thanks again!"
BorderCollie,33aa2a,sugarberryham,6,Mon Apr 20 22:07:01 2015 UTC,"It is really hard help you via the internet with an issue like this to be completely honest. You should ask for help from a local person who can see the dog's behaviour first hand and offer you advice. Or talk to your shelter again and see if they have any recommendations.   This might be the kind of problem that getting an experienced trainer to help you for an hour could go a long way in terms of giving you tools to train the behaviour and helping you understand your options for management.  In the mean time do not let your puppy practice bad behaviour. If she's biting at the rabbit cage, do not let her even access it. It's pretty normal that dogs are curious about small fuzzy things and many border collie mixes will try to herd cats."
BorderCollie,33aa2a,aveldina,2,Tue Apr 21 15:59:27 2015 UTC,"many border collie mixes will try to herd cats.   Can confirm, my Border\Aussie tries to herd my cat occasionally (evidenced by scratches on my cat's leg just below the ankle) - I've caught her in the act a couple of times.  Cat doesn't take it lying down though, he'll wait until she's asleep and give her a good scratch on her nose for her trouble (sneaky little asshole)."

It’s been less than 48 hours and she already can be around the rabbit cage without automatically wanting to nip at it. She still falls into that focused trance, but she doesn’t act on it and we’ve stayed on top of her and break it as soon as we see it. The cat is still hiding under the bed / in the closet (and honestly, she hides from us when we come home from day trips), but they did have a “successful” second introduction with the cat in the kennel and the doggie outside of it- they both eventually lost interest after a bit of unhappy hissing.   As I mentioned, she was a shelter dog, so we had a feeling she’d be super interested in moving fluffy things. But she honestly has the best personality we’ve seen ever in a doggie!! I think it will take some hard work (which, all good things do), but we’re both feeling much better about it c:  Edit: Here's a picture!! http://i.imgur.com/AnS8DR8.jpg"

BorderCollie,3341gn,hairybuttertree,1 point,Sun Apr 19 09:06:31 2015 UTC,Just a suggestion.  Does he only do that at a particular location? Maybe try taking him to various different locations with other people (parks etc.) and bring a toy. Hopefully the new surroundings will keep him occupied and get naturally get used to strangers walking about.
BorderCollie,3341gn,Fraser514,1 point,Sun Apr 19 11:55:40 2015 UTC,He's mostly afraid if we are on streets. If we are on trails or in fields then he is mostly okay with people and dogs.
BorderCollie,3341gn,colliekris,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:55:12 2015 UTC,"At 13 months,  he's probably going through his second fear period. You need to be super proactive in this phas or else it will become a bigger problem. I would suggest picking up a copy of Control Unleashed by Leslie McDevitt and play the Look At That game with your pup. Basically, take your dog to a place where there are strangers, find a distance where the dog is able to notice people without reacting or going over threshold, point at a person and say ""Look At That."" The second your dog looks at the target, click (or mark the behavior with a yes), and wait to reward until your dog looks back at you. When your dog looks back at you make it a happy occasion and jackpot reward. Play this game several more times for about 5 minutes and then calmly leave the area. You have to be consistent with it and do it often enough that the dog begins to associate triggers with something good, not something that makes them afraid. As he gets better at the game, decrease the distance between you and the strangers and, this part is important, ask for more of your dog than he can give. If you do, you risk him shutting down and losing all the good associations you've built up until that point.  Try not to have strangers come up to him until he has gotten the game down and you've built up a good, healthy association with new people."

BorderCollie,32t2w4,Wcoburn93,2,Thu Apr 16 14:21:19 2015 UTC,"Assuming you haven't already tried it, a long line and a lot of VERY consistent recall work, with meaningful corrections.  The consistency is the critical part.  Don't call him unless you can be certain of correcting and enforcing it (with the line) if he hesitates.  He needs consistency so that he comes to believe that coming when you call isn't something that he has a choice about.  Of course, as part of this, you absolutely can't have him out without the line or an enforcement method until his recall is absolutely solid.  Leerburg has some excellent information on training recall here: http://leerburg.com/qarecall.htm  I've found his material to be some of the best considered and most reliable out there.  Don't get distracted by the fact that he mostly works different breeds - this sort of training isn't breed specific at all.  It doesn't even matter that ""herding mode"" is specifically his distraction, you'd be working against the same sort of thing with any sort of activity that the dog loves and wants to blow you off for. :)  A lot of people may say that this is all too much work.  Sure, some dogs learn recall easily, but this sort of method is about the most reliable there is for even a heavily distracted dog.  Good luck with it, and I hope that info helps you out!"
BorderCollie,32t2w4,nathhad,2,Thu Apr 16 14:48:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks a ton! I'll try it starting tonight. By long line, just to be positive, you do mean a leash that will let him go far but that I'll be able to pull him back on? I'll give that a read, and I'll start first thing when I get home!"
BorderCollie,32t2w4,bynL,2,Thu Apr 16 15:37:08 2015 UTC,"Yep - a long line is just a really long leash. They use it for horse training, as well."
BorderCollie,32t2w4,aveldina,2,Thu Apr 16 16:20:48 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that you cannot be correcting without teaching the dog what it is that you want FIRST. If you haven't put in the upfront work to actually teach the recall cue, then correcting is unfair. This is probably obvious but it's something that can be quickly forgotten.  I did not use long lines with mine, however when she ignored the recall in an off leash (dog park) type scenario then I caught her myself and leashed her for the next 5 minutes or so of the walk to cement the understanding that being off leash is a privilege that is only allowed with respecting recalls."
BorderCollie,32t2w4,nathhad,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:40:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is also absolutely a critical point.  Corrections are for when he already knows what your recall word is and is blowing you off.  If you don't have him understanding a recall word yet in the first place, the long line is a good tool to help, but you'd be using it in more of a ""guiding"" than correcting manner.  Different level of force, different goal."
BorderCollie,32t2w4,nathhad,0,Thu Apr 16 21:03:34 2015 UTC,"Oh he absolutely knows recall. In house he'll come right away no matter what he's doing. Outside though, he'll recognize it, and then just continue what he was doing as if it's more important."
BorderCollie,32t2w4,nathhad,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:06:52 2015 UTC,"That's it exactly.  Depending on the size of the area you're working in and the number of obstacles they can get hung up on, normally anywhere from 15 to 30 feet.  You can get premade ones in various materials, but my wife and I both usually make our own.  Either way, you want something lightweight and smooth that doesn't normally impede them much and is hard to get hung up in things.  We're starting training now on a 10 week old pup, and we're using a 30'+ line made of clothesline with a very, very lightweight clip; despite her picayune size, it hardly slows her down when we're not in the middle of a correction.  Clothesline in this case is usually stout enough for even many young adult border collies, and we have a friend who uses it in the round pen when she's starting them on sheep as well (serves the same basic purpose).  For a line that's much stronger and not much bulkier, you can use paracord, which is still smooth, easy to get, about 10x stronger than clothesline, and still knots well.  It will soil and wear out a bit faster than clothesline, but might be a good first choice if you're making your own and Dexter's a bit set in his chasing ways already.  Your first few corrections might need to be pretty strong - otherwise he may build up a ""tolerance"" for the correction instead of getting the idea quickly and safely at a low level.  Many pet stores and similar sell pre-made long lines with either a flat solid plastic material, or a diamond-weave polypropylene rope.  Both work fine but may be bulkier/heavier than you need.  The polypropylene rope version is great if your dog is a swimmer, though - it floats, and is very unlikely to hang up on anything if they go for a swim.  We have one BC who thought he was a fish when he was little, so this was a handy feature."
BorderCollie,32t2w4,bynL,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"Perfect! I have paracord on hand and plenty of it, so that's the first go to line I'll use. And I think this will be easy and simple to do, just keeping him close until he's really use to it and not comfortable going elsewhere without my say so"
BorderCollie,32t2w4,bynL,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:32:30 2015 UTC,"That's also a good idea in general, and helps with a number of training issues as well.  You can aid a lot of things by clipping his (normal-length) leash solidly to your belt and making him spend the entire day with you.  He'll get popped around and tripped over a lot at first, but just move exactly like you normally would.  He'll probably throw a bit of a tantrum, but once they realize it's actually important to pay attention to the human (in order to avoid getting jerked around and stepped on in this case), that often starts to carry into a lot of other situations as well.  Ideally, you want him more interested in you and what you're doing than the things he's wanting to chase after anyway, and that's an all around good thing."

BorderCollie,32t2w4,rahul0705,2,Thu Apr 16 21:09:53 2015 UTC,"In all the BCs I've ever had, there seems to have been an instinctual understanding of ""that'll do"", so I've always used that to get them to stop doing pretty much anything. I first used it as a joke, but  when I saw how effective it was, I just default to it. Like the previous poster said, consistency is key, and ensure your guy is on a longline at the very least until his recall is set."

I had a friend come over a few days back with her puppy (4 months) for the pups to play and I was pretty impressed that whilst they were in the middle of tumbling over each other, Chino would stop play and come when I told him too."
BorderCollie,32ipcc,Phill_Pickle,2,Tue Apr 14 18:12:54 2015 UTC,"See! that's great! keep doing little things like that-getting him to come when he's like in the middle of really fun stuff....and I wouldn't cut out rewards and go to just praise on ""come"" any time soon...hell...I still do a lot of treats and toys when Adyline actually comes back to me upon request.  the older they get, the more hard headed they get, so keep up with the treats or whatever you use as reinforcement! ---I know you didn't ask for training advice....and I'm sure you don't need much, but whatever! :D  BTW....Chino is a great name! It makes mes think of a maraschino cherry....and I was thinking maybe because he's a  ""cherry blonde""....but then i realized the term was actually ""STRAWBERRY blonde""....either way... LOVE the name!"
BorderCollie,32ipcc,Phill_Pickle,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:12:18 2015 UTC,"I actually wanted to call him Louie, my daughter wanted to call him Tom and my son wanted to call him Buzz (huge toy story fan hahaha). My husband ended up suggestion Chino after seeing photos because his colouring reminded him of cappuccino foam."
BorderCollie,32ipcc,Phill_Pickle,2,Tue Apr 14 21:26:56 2015 UTC,"cappuccino! yes! thats good.   do you guys live near any places to let him go out and run his ass off? lol...I don't have too many ""good"" places like that, but I try to go out of my way, to take her to big open areas...like parks, beaches, and rivers. wish we had prairies or mountains around here.."
BorderCollie,32ipcc,Phill_Pickle,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:30:54 2015 UTC,"Yes we do! We live in a small country town (12, 000 population) and there is a lot of river, creeks and dams for swimming and lots of open space to run. We live 2 hours from the beach so when he is fully vaccinated I plan on taking him as he travels really well unlike our other dog!"
BorderCollie,32ipcc,GameofKnowing,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"....when you say ""fully vaccinated"" does that include the Lepto vaccine? I started working at a vet about a year ago, and I learned that a lot of clinics do not include Lepto or Bordetella, unless requested. Lepto is great for dogs who play in water, and Bordetella is good for your pup being around other dogs, like in daycare/boarding/dog park/etc.....its common name is ""kennel cough""  Once again, I'm not trying to sound like a smartass or ""know it all""....I'm just letting you know....that those 2 are very important and aren't always included, so ask about it.....Lepto can be extremely serious, and even after getting over lepto, they can still spread it for up to a year. scary.   edit: forgive any spelling errors....not sure I spelled bordetella right."
BorderCollie,32ipcc,Phill_Pickle,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:56:29 2015 UTC,I've never heard about them so I will definitely enquire about them! Thanks!
BorderCollie,32ipcc,GameofKnowing,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:13:26 2015 UTC,no problem....  I think I forgot to mention that I'm in love with blondes! lol. One day I hope to adopt a strawberry blondie!  My girl has an extreme white pattern. I just posted an album.  edit: wording
BorderCollie,32hlyq,KuteBooty,5,Mon Apr 13 21:34:36 2015 UTC,Yep.
BorderCollie,32hlyq,ravenseyeview,2,Tue Apr 14 03:10:02 2015 UTC,honestly too cute to even be mad.
BorderCollie,32hlyq,Wagwany,2,Tue Apr 14 01:19:41 2015 UTC,I'm sure they know the consequences...  Morning snuggles! It's the best :)
BorderCollie,32hlyq,doghumper,1 point,Tue Apr 14 04:47:22 2015 UTC,My dog does this every morning. Except instead of sprawling he curls up into a defiant little ball and I have to pry him out of bed to go outside and potty.

BorderCollie,32ignl,haggisthemanly,2,Tue Apr 14 01:30:25 2015 UTC,nice duck butt!
BorderCollie,32ignl,misscareer,2,Tue Apr 14 15:36:06 2015 UTC,He's 99.9% butt.
BorderCollie,32ignl,misscareer,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:42:29 2015 UTC,"I buzz my BC's ""pants"" in the summer so they aren't so POOFY back there, but I always leave the curly duck butt long on top :]"

BorderCollie,32ga3v,aveldina,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:41:03 2015 UTC,One of my favourite girls. :-) I always love the photos you take of your gang. You make them shine!
BorderCollie,32ga3v,potato_is_meat,2,Tue Apr 14 09:55:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I don't really have to try, they do lots of shining by themselves. :)"
BorderCollie,32ga3v,misscareer,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:38:27 2015 UTC,I would love to build some agility course stations in our yard for our BC's. Do you have any advice?
BorderCollie,32ga3v,misscareer,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:37:56 2015 UTC,Hmm hard to know what kind of advice to give without knowing how much experience you have with the sport. :)   Have you taken classes before?
BorderCollie,32ga3v,misscareer,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:40:21 2015 UTC,"OOPS! Should have clarified. No classes before, just wanted to give them something of a playarea. They instinctively treat normal things in the yard like obstacles it's so fun to watch. I'll set up saw horses out there to work on a project, and the dogs will be jumping them like they're in the dog show! Or I'll peek outside to spy on them, and they're both sitting atop a tall stump. So neat."
BorderCollie,32dwuf,Border_Badger,2,Mon Apr 13 00:07:32 2015 UTC,Those are some unique markings!
