Essentially, he could afford to do lots that Putin (etc.) disliked but didn't care too much about, like start the EU Association process (people forget this was Yanu's doing), but when it came to doing things Putin would not tolerate, like actually signing the agreement, Yanu had little choice.

russia,3e23ud,felipepires,8,Tue Jul 21 10:54:10 2015 UTC,"First. The EU is more interested in firstly expanding to the Balkans (smaller populations, more easily manageable).   While your observation is valid, this isn't really true. Ukraine is far more strategically valuable as a partner than any Balkan state (though they are more important than Europe gives them credit for).    And even those countries are having a hard time being accepted.   Everyone's having a hard time at the minute, mostly because EU member states don't approve of further expansion. Forgetting all other reasons, this is enough to prevent Ukraine's membership for the foreseeable future.    Secondly, it's clear Russia will NEVER allow Ukraine to join the EU, just their simple disagreement will prompt European leaders to refuse integration. Just in order not to piss off Russia.   This is the second most important reason for why Ukraine won't join any time soon. It would require revolutionary change in Russia itself before letting Ukraine in would become palatable. As far as Russia winning ""without even needing to do anything"", I think even Russian citizens and those on this sub admit now that Russia's at least done something, even if you narrow that down to keeping an open border, letting volunteers cross over with arms and fuel etc.   The separatist republics are a trigger that they can press anytime which will result in Ukraine not being able to join. Great strategic thinking in part of Mr.Putin I would say.   I'm glad you appreciate this strategy; it's worked well elsewhere and will work well in Ukraine for the foreseeable future (again, unless there's revolutionary change in Russia first). It's been called ""strategic relevance"", when you're not particularly powerful yourself, you can boost your power by crippling smaller states around you—especially if they start doing things you dislike.    That will prompt the Turkish government to feel completely ignored and worst even, they will claim ""racism"" led to European fast tracking Ukraine and blocking them.   They already feel this way, and racism is quite a clear reason for their non-accession (among several other reasons).    And the Ukrainian nazi junta will help this argument.   You forgot 'fascist'.    With time and the realization that they will NEVER join the EU, Ukrainians will turn back to the Eurasian Union.    This certainly happens; the EU's most powerful tool for promoting democratic and economic reform is the promise of eventual membership; when this promise is absent, reforms 'backslide' quickly, especially now there's a rival economic bloc which doesn't ask for any serious reforms.    You can already see the symptoms of this happening in Georgia where people's dream of EU integration seems every passing year more and more far fetched. The intention to join the Eurasian Union is now growing among Georgians, slowly, but surely.   This is certainly true, though I wouldn't expect it to change any time soon.    Joining the Eurasian Union will probably be better for both Ukraine and Georgia if one goes by the logic of thinking that it's better to be a ""big fish in a small pond then a small fish in a big pond.""   I can see your logic, as far as decision-making is concerned, but that's also completely not how markets work. There's a reason that every state in the world would love to have an in-road into the EU: it's the largest market on earth, and it's always better to be able to sell your products competitively (without tariffs) to more people. It might be better for these states, but there's little reason to think it would be better for people. Joining the EEU has no political strings, meaning oligarchical systems that Russia got rid of but still remain in Ukraine would endure, robbing the people of their labour and providing no bureaucratic stability/predictability—the primary cause of the very first Maidan protests.   This also doesn't take into account the extent to which Russia's punitive trade sanctions, for example on Georgian and Moldovan wine and on natural energy, have ruined their trade relationships. Because Russia is now seen as a trade partner who might one day blockade you, these states have developed trade links with other nations, particularly the EU, and have no incentive whatsoever to undo these changes, which provide them with stable trade.    The only way Ukraine might join the EU is if the Eurasian Union converges with the European Union in a hundred years time. But that's a crazy thought for now. And that would have Russia tagging along.   I think I agree. But this won't happen without revolutionary change in Russia (and the EEU itself). The EU is very strict on what's called its 'acquis'—the rules and standards necessary for membership—and while Russia and the rest of the EEU don't meet them, serious integration isn't likely. That's not to say there couldn't be smaller-scale agreements between the two, and there's no reason whatsoever that Russia (etc.) could not one day join and be further integrated into the European market; I just don't see it happening any time soon.  [N.B. When I say 'revolutionary change', I don't necessarily mean a revolution, just for Russia to substantially change its security orientation and priorities. Also, if you're bombarding me with down-votes, at least explain why?]"
russia,3e23ud,Kameniev,4,Tue Jul 21 17:50:06 2015 UTC,It really depends on how this war in the Donbas is resolved and whether Ukraine can really tackle its corruption problem. It's still a poor country and has a long way to go but I could see it happening in 10-15 years if progress occurs.

In 10 years there will be no progress for EU aspirations and this ""little war"" will be frozen and Russia/Eurasia will threaten to restart it anytime and from an even stronger position. They already know the array of sanctions they were threatened with. They are now working on a SWIFT replacement with the BRICS, they will be much more prepared to tackle the Ukrainian Nazi junta in 10 years time. And also look at Georgia, the inclination to join the EEU is growing every year (under reported but still growing). Because they know they WILL NEVER join the EU. Ukraine will never join the EU, it's crazy to even think they might have a chance. It's like thinking Turkey will join (which they have been trying OFFICIALLY since 1987). Won't happen. EU expansion will stop at the Balkans and Moldova can go either way. Ukraine will surely sign association agreements with EU (and Russia too), but full membership will never happen. Ukraine in 25 years will join the EEU. Mark my words."

russia,3e1ycw,Irin20,7,Tue Jul 21 09:37:38 2015 UTC,"Roger Boyes and Katerina Kravtsova Published at 12:01AM, July 18 2015   In the winter after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the 38-year old KGB officer Vladimir Putin returned almost penniless from Dresden to his native city of St Petersburg in the collapsing Soviet Union. He had a 20-year-old washing machine and savings from his monthly salary of $270.  Within a decade he had become a millionaire; within 20 years he had turned himself by some accounts into one of the wealthiest people in the world. This was not a conventional entrepreneurial rags-to-riches progression. Mr Putin used his power to make connections with the business world, help them to prosper and shield them from bureaucracy.  As Mr Putin’s friends grew rich, so, says the US, — despite his denials — did he. US investigators believe that his wealth is hidden. Many intelligence analysts and players in Russian business believe that his fortune has been parked with loyal oligarchs, held in trust, perhaps for life after the Kremlin.  “Money doesn’t go into a Putin account; oligarchs hold his money as his trustees,” claims Bill Browder, the British-US businessman who is leading an anti-corruption campaign against the Kremlin leader and other Russian officials. An exiled Russian businessman said: “For the time being he [Putin] lives in a money-free world. If [Putin’s friend] Alina Kabayeva tells him she saw a diamond and wants a similar one, she’ll get not a similar one but exactly that one.”  Mr Putin’s alleged cash machine has become the No 1 target for the formidable team of sanctions engineers, the officials from the US Treasury and the financially savvy intelligence agencies whose task it is to find his vulnerabilities.  Piecing together what we have found out about their work, The Times can trace three phases in Putin’s complex game of intertwining business and politics to his advantage. The Band of Brothers The jobless Mr Putin pulled strings. Within three months his network of KGB colleagues had spotted an opening for him as an adviser at City Hall. When his former university lecturer Anatoly Sobchak became mayor of St Petersburg in 1991, he put his protégé in charge of the city’s external economic relations department. As a KGB officer he was trained to spot foreign spies, vet investors and make sure that the right Russian partners were put in touch with the foreigners.  Within six years Mr Putin, who had power to grant permits and export licences, was surrounded by people who now run Russia’s oil, gas, construction and banking companies. Two of Russia’s largest state companies, Rosneft and Gazprom, are run respectively by Igor Sechin and Alexey Miller, both Mr Putin’s deputies at that time. The man regarded as one of Mr Putin’s closest friends, Gennady Timchenko, founded one of the world’s big oil exporting companies.  Business grew fast in the chaos of the 1990s as the Soviet system fell apart. It was the 1990s when “Russia’s road to corruption started”, claimed one US congressional source with knowledge of monitoring of Putin’s Russia. The St Petersburg era offered the best window into that, they said.  Richard Palmer, a former CIA station chief in Moscow, said in evidence to a US congressional committee in 1999 that senior officials were involved in “the looting of the Russian state”. Mr Palmer named Boris Yeltsin, who was then president. He also named Mr Putin, who was the prime minister.  There is no evidence that any of the individuals targeted by western sanctions, or other oligarchs, are implicated in any corruption or that they secured their fortunes as a result of corruption. However, given their connections to Mr Putin, they are of intense interest to the US. In 1990s St Petersburg, Mr Putin was becoming a figure of substance. He became one of the founder members of an elite dacha compound, the Ozero co-operative, in a lakeside neighbourhood. Those involved developed a bond that would propel him into the Kremlin. His neighbours included Vladimir Yakunin, now the head of the state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, major shareholder of Bank Rossiya. US officials have called the bank “a crony bank” and Mr Kovalchuk one of Mr Putin’s “cashiers”.  A report by the opposition paper Novaya Gazeta claimed that Mr Putin had given up to 23 billion roubles ($4.5 million) of public money to a construction company 20th Trest in the form of loans, with the company storing the money in foreign accounts. Andrei Zykov, a former police officer who led the investigation into 20th Trest, said by phone from St Petersburg that he believed Mr Putin used his privileged position to help the company. Mr Zykov claimed that in return the company helped Mr Putin to construct his Ozero dacha. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, denied such suggestions, saying that they were part of an attack by western media.  Mr Putin denies that anything illicit happened in the 1990s. There was an investigation into claims of fraud in the St Petersburg administration launched by local politicians in 1992. It led to Mr Zykov’s investigation into 20th Trest. Both investigations were closed without going to court. “As a matter of fact, there was no investigation,” Putin said in 2000. “There was nothing there that could be criminally prosecuted.”  Not everyone agrees that Mr Putin did anything controversial in the early 1990s. “Up to 1996 Putin led a modest lifestyle,” a former associate from 1990s St Petersburg said. When his boss Anatoly Sobchak was defeated in the 1996 mayoral election, Mr Putin was out of a job — and in need of cash. His friends helped him to make the move to Moscow, to the centre of power. It is claimed that Gennady “Gena” Timchenko assisted with the start-up capital for a high-level political career.  “Relations with Timchenko helped: Putin was given money to go to Moscow,” a former associate said. A spokesman for Mr Timchenko, asked if he had helped Mr Putin financially at this time, said: “Mr Timchenko has never participated in any of Mr Putin’s private matters.” But when Mr Putin moved, many of the Band of Brothers prepared to up sticks too. They were about to get much richer.  The Kremlin cash flow Vladimir Putin needed cash, or at least the support of the super-rich, at three critical points in his career: on his return from East Germany; when he moved to Moscow (1996); and in the first phase of his presidency (2000-2004) when it was unclear if he would survive more than one term. US investigators believe that his trusted associates began to “sponsor” him. Over time, the Band of Brothers effectively became trustees. And that is one reason why the US has put what it calls Putin’s “cronies” on the sanctions list. The US Treasury explained its targeting of the Putin inner circle by saying that the individuals were, “acting for or on behalf of or materially assisting, sponsoring, or providing financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of” a “senior Russian government official”. Treasury officials said that this was a reference to Mr Putin and others. Anything that weakens ties between them weakens Mr Putin, goes the thinking. “By the time he got to Moscow . . . he had a system that was pretty much in place,” said Karen Dawisha, a US-based academic who researched Mr Putin’s circle. Her theory is that supporters set up a joint bank account for his benefit.  Boris Berzovsky, the late oligarch who claimed to have advised Boris Yeltsin to appoint Mr Putin as the next Kremlin chief, calculated that Mr Putin must have been a millionaire by 1999, albeit a modest one. To achieve and consolidate power you needed far more. Bill Browder, once Russia’s major foreign investor and now a Putin enemy, claimed that there were dozens of different Ozero-style communities, invisibly linking politics with money that was flowing in and around massive privatisation deals.  “There were different connections to different things,” he said. But only one held the promise of buying into supreme power. When Mr Putin became first Mr Yeltsin’s prime minister and then his successor as president, his rich backers saw a chance to move into the big league. At the core of Mr Putin’s system was his insecurity; he trusted the inner circle but saw in other wealthy businessmen only a threat. Many had influence over local governors. With western holdings they were rich beyond his control. They also had political ambitions. “That’s when they started to go after other oligarchs to get their money,” said Mr Browder, architect of an anti-corruption campaign against Moscow. He is banned from Russia and lives in London. When the Kremlin leader smashed the Yukos oil giant in 2003-2004, hitting it with $27 billion in tax demands and arresting its boss, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, he sent a signal to any oligarch who risked public disloyalty. Khodorkovsky spent ten years in jail. Most observers saw the sentence as politically motivated. Just before his arrest in 2003, Mr Khodorkovsky challenged Mr Putin publicly about alleged government corruption. He highlighted the state purchase of an oil company for what was seen as an inflated figure.  Mr Browder believes it was at this stage that Mr Putin saw the need to consolidate his power and money. “He became president in 2000 and he understands that there are elections in 2004. So he wanted to make sure that he had a lot of money saved.”"

Soviet cuisine is more broad and it includes a lot more dishes from different cultures. You need a lot of time to get to know those.  Russian cuisine is simpler, though -- there are several complex dishes, but in general it's pretty simple. Take bliny for instance -- those are just thin pancakes with (or without) various fillers. Or solyanka -- that's a soup that originated in a same fashion as did the pizza (originally, food for the poor people). It was basically a medieval version of a fast food: cook had thrown anything he had in that soup, then boiled it for half an hour and served it. Chicken meat? Sounds great. Pork? Sure, why not. Cucumbers? Hell yes! Potatoes, carrots, cabbage... In the pot it goes!"

The only rule is you have to wait for me to kick, the moment  my foot hits the abll it is fair game.  If you can think about it in practical terms standing too close is ineffective standing too far back is als bad. You need to have a practical distance that allow you to calculate the trajectory and hit the ball out of the air as it slows.

Personally, I don't think that everyone hates Russia but that most people who express anger towards Russia have given up on the idea of Russia ever being a positive element in the world.    There's been very little contrition from Russia (the successor state to the Soviet Union) for its part in establishing communist governments in Europe by force. In the eyes of many Europeans, Russia needs to apologize for the Soviet Union in the same way that Germany apologized for the Third Reich.  Russia has positioned itself internationally as a sort of oppositional force to whatever the United States, Europe and their Asian allies are doing. It was Russia that tried to delay action against Serbia while Serbian soldiers herded women into rape camps. It's Russia that has economic deals with North Korea. There's a theme of Russia supporting anything that the United States is against, no matter how heinous.  If you ask yourself how Russia needs the United States and how the United States needs Russia, there really isn't anything encouraging about that relationship. The same is true of Europe, where the economic relationship with Russia is now seen as a liability. Nobody needs Russia, because nobody trusts Russia enough to allow themselves to need Russia and vice versa. Because of this, people are willing to have very hostile views- it's easy to hate someone you don't need.    One thing to remember is that Russia and Russians are not the same thing. Many people may despise Russia, but many may have no hostile feelings towards Russians upon meeting them."

For the same reasons churchil engineered a famine that kill 6 millions people in India deliberatedly  but his still consider as a hero wich should not and that Cameron refuse to apologize   Russia has positioned itself internationally as a sort of oppositional force to whatever the United States, Europe    Of course and that is truly one of the greatest things the USSR did outside Europe  Entire colonies became countries because of this support , manifestation against the Vietnam war, condemnation , protection of India against a U.S invasion support for democratic states in Latin America and blocking the Yanks everywhere was the truly great things this country did and they are probably billions people that are happy of that.   And their Asian allies are doing   Why are you putting Asia wich was part of the non aligned movement?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement  Only two countries stand Japan and  South Korea.  In the case of South Korea they have quite good relation with Russia.   It was Russia that tried to delay action against Serbia while Serbian soldiers herded women into rape camps. It's Russia that has economic deals with North Korea   Russia and China by the way most of the world today agree that actions in Yugoslavia by NATO didnt have any basis   This is why when you see the map pf Kosovo only a minority of countries recongnize Kosovo. Furthermore UN reports  show that both side were engaging in atrocities.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Kosovo   It's Russia that has economic deals with North Korea.    Who is sticking with Israel and Saudi arabia and that in turn result in the entre middle east hating them?

What we're seeing today is Russians lashing out to those who complain about the Soviet ""occupation"" but Russians often forget that the legality of the issue does not matter to those that feel they have been wronged.  Also I agree that it was the SU that let the republics gain their independence. Still a whole of Russians today hold a grudge against pretty much everyone for the dissolution of the Soviet Union."

""  Source: http://www.airvectors.net/avil2.html  The anedote originated during the height of Operation Barbarossa but the real telegram Stalin did sent was to different type of factory during Winter War with Finland:  "" Telegram Nr. 1  City of KOVROV  Kirkik Factory Nr. 2  To:  Plant Manager Kuriatnikov  Cc: Party Organizer Gureev  It has come to the government’s attention that suspicious characters in the factory inhibit the production of the Degtyaryov machine gun with a 73-bullet drum. This gun is now needed by our Red Army, like air, like water. This machine will save the lives of tens of thousands of Red Army soldiers. The faster we receive thousands and tens of thousands of units of this machine, the better for the Red Army, which is waging war against the Finnish White Guards. In spite of this, suspicious individuals in the factory, bought by enemies of the people, interfere with the work of producing the machine.  You have two to three days to set up mass production of the disk. To do it simply and without tricks, all you have to do is copy the Finnish drum. If production cannot be set up by this deadline, the government will put your factory under special control and shoot all the rats sitting in it.  J.

russia,3dxpj7,turdovski,9,Mon Jul 20 13:50:45 2015 UTC,"what most advanced tanks? what are you talking about. The bulk of Russian military tech dates back to the 1980s. New stuff is for show only. Plus the Russian defence industry is dependent on imports. The Kalashnikov factory had plans to modernise their machinery, the plan was to buy new machines in France - when the EU imposed sanctions on Russia all these modernisation plans had to be put on hold because domestically Russian industry is simply incapable of manufacturing the sort of machines needed for making modern assault rifles."
russia,3dxpj7,igorfazlyev,9,Mon Jul 20 14:21:11 2015 UTC,"what most advanced tanks? what are you talking about.   The Russians just released the brand new T-14 Armata tank, based on the Armata Universal Combat Platform, which will serve as the basis for a whole new generation of heavy tracked vehicles. The Armata platform is very well engineered and sensibly designed by all accounts.  The Russians have a history of designing very good tanks and the platform has a lot of potential for export."
russia,3dxpj7,Apostrophe,6,Mon Jul 20 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"what accounts?  The problem with modern Russian tech is that even when the idea is sound (like the remote controlled turret on the Armata platform), when it comes to execution things often just fall apart, because everything gets stolen and wishful thinking wins over reality. So yeah, in theory, in the reports tha the president gets and that are shown on TV or shown off on red square Russia's got great military tech, but the problem is that in all probability very little of this tech is going to see the light of day in any significant numbers. Russia's riddled with systemic problems. You can't have an advanced military in a country where in an average state financed project between 50 and 70% of the money goes on kickbacks."

russia,3e01zv,vigorous,4,Mon Jul 20 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"Comparing the support most Russians express for Vladimir Putin with their views about the Russian government as a whole, reveals a stark contrast. 58% of Russians say that government officials primarily seek to preserve and strengthen their own power and 60% say that government officials are not accountable to society. Russians are not over eager to spend quality time with government employees, with 69% of them trying to have minimal interaction with the government. Nor do Russians posses strong faith in the legal system, with 47% claiming not to feel protected by the law while only 41% saying they did. These numbers illustrate not only a lack of support, but an absence of trust for the Russian political system outside of Putin.   What does this mean for when Putin leaves? Can anyone in this climate get support if they are not Putin?"
russia,3e01zv,Irin20,2,Tue Jul 21 09:57:28 2015 UTC,"In real life Putin isn't that popular as how some certain engaged groups try to convince the foreign public. There are plenty of critics and genuine hatred towards him among Russians. The quite a large critical part of Russian society don't approve his foreign policy as well as domestic one. Lots of people blame on him the deaths of thousands of Russian people in Novorossia. Also, there is a large part of society who are not actually happy about some recent laws signed by Putin, considering them being a traps designed against the ordinary people, especially the ones that could have the bad consequances in future.  So, it would be too naive to think that Putin is considered such a ""hero"" and it would be wrong to think that his reign is approved by almost ""90%"" of Russins. It is simply not so.

I just said what I know is happening in Russia in reality because I have the possibility to talk to lots of different people, let alone to read really clever, well informed and, most important, genuinely patriotic experts. Kozyrev definitely does not belong to those ones.

KAMENSK-SHAKHTINSKY, Russian Federation, 12 November 2014 - As mandated, the Observer Mission (OM) is operating 24/7 at both BCPs. Overall cross-border traffic flows increased at both Border Crossing Points (BCPs). For the first time since late August, more people entered than left the Russian Federation (RF) at the two observed BCPs. The OM observed the highest number of persons in military-style clothing crossing the border in both directions, since the beginning of its mandate. The OM observed them crossing the border more often in groups than previously. They were formed also of a higher number of people, in one instance of 24 persons...  During the reporting period, the OTs observed 665 men and women in military-style dress crossing the border in both directions. This is the highest number observed so far. These people have been crossing individually or in very small groups, but have recently also crossed in larger groups. On 7 November the OM observed a group of 24 persons in camouflage clothing that crossed by minibus from the RF to Ukraine at Donetsk BCP. These border crossings were made predominantly at Donetsk BCP in both directions. Several Cossacks were also observed by the OTs. The Cossacks are identified by their traditional fur hats, as well as by Cossack insignias. The observers did not see any of them carrying weapons."

At least I don't think they're checking military IDs too :p   The profile of the people crossing the border remains unchanged and can be categorised as follows:  Families on foot or by car with a lot of luggage;  Elderly people with few bags;  Adults (usually of younger age) with no luggage or empty cars;  People wearing military-style clothes with or without backpacks.  The average number of entries/exits increased from 7,042 to 7,523 per day for both BCPs during the reporting period. For the first time since late August the majority of people crossed the border from Ukraine to the Russian Federation (RF). The average net flow, i.e. the balance of entries and exits, turned from minus 648 to (plus) 182 per day for both BCPs. During the previous week 4,537 left the RF for Ukraine, while this week 1,272 entered the RF from Ukraine. Donetsk BCP continued to experience more traffic than Gukovo BCP. The cross-border movements registered at both BCPs accounted for 37 percent of all entries/exits in the Rostov region. The majority of the vehicles crossing the border have number plates issued in the Luhansk region, including the long-distance coaches commuting between Luhansk and cities in the RF."

Of course, I'm not talking about the whole Polish nation, and not even the majority of the population -- it's just that this thing exists in the country, and many Russians (and Polish people as well) know about it.   As a Polish guy myself, I have to say that is true, but not exactly for the reasons you might think.    The general population has a very bad opinion of Russia, as a historic bully. I haven't seen the statistics lately but is generally very bad, and the people who actually have good opinions about Russia are older people that are dying out. Younger people vary from very bad to indifferent, very few are friendly. Many people have a bad opinion of Russians not because they are seen as aggressors/invaders, but because some Russian/Ukranian immigrants are quite rude/drunk/dirty. Same way some people in the west have a bad opinion of Poles. Keep in mind that for most people (me included) it's impossible to distinguish between spoken Russian and Ukranian. This is particularly true in the East, where there are more immigrants. A few radicals hate Russia and Russians just because they need to hate someone and hating Jews is so last century.   I'm from the west of Poland and the only Russians I have met are tourists. I haven't seen any animosity against them other than the general ""damn tourist, get off the bike lane"".

russia,3dvff5,viimeinen,2,Mon Jul 20 13:42:43 2015 UTC,"If they weren't doing anything inappropriate (drunken yelling, etc)   They weren't, I'm 100% sure of it -- they're a young couple, both aren't heavy drinkers (occasional glass of wine, rarely anything more than that; they don't drink stuff like whiskey, vodka, etc.). They were surprised, but they just left -- noone wanted to make a scene out of it.   What is the opposite (attitude towards Polish people in Russia)?   In general -- indifference, I think.  I'm getting a feeling that Polish people won't be really recognized -- they'll be considered Europeans, and if they'll act politely, they'll be treated with same attitude as any other tourists.  As of hatred towards Europeans/American... There's no that I know of. I know for a fact that there's no hatred towards them in big cities -- I've worked with several Americans, all of them were quite fond of Russia, and neither of them said anything about Russians hating on them.  Though, general problem in Russia is indifference, I think -- and not even towards other nations, but to any strangers in general. Younger generation is friendlier, and there's a lot of exceptions among mature Russians being friendly as well, but in general -- smiling to a girl in a subway car, for example, might be considered as harassment (by the girl herself). Not like you'll get in trouble for that, but if she's not smiling back, you shouldn't be surprised and forcing the issue is usually not advised.  But, being a Russian myself, I can say that most of the people in densely populated cities will help you if you'll ask them (or if you'll get sick or get in some kind of trouble), if they speak English hence understand you. Small towns -- same story, though less people know English.  EDIT: I remembered something about hatred towards some particular nationalities. There's a little bit of annoyance towards Middle-Eastern looking people (Russians usually use the derogative term ""hach"" or ""churka"" for them), because they're considered dirty, loud, impolite people. And there's only annoyance if they start to act that way -- other then that, they're treated with the same respect as other nations (men would yield their seats in public transport for women or an elder person of any nationality, for example -- that's a fact as well)."

People leave Russia, because, frankly it's a shithole. Always has, hopefully not for ever. Never been there myself, have had a native muscovite girlfriend. She's told me all about it. Alongside all the russian expats I've met over the years and which have ended up being my close friends.  Edit: forgot to add that I used the term shithole with objectivity in mind.

Excuse me for using whataboutism, but it's not like the Ukrainian Army is the only one shelling civilians. DPR/Russia have done this too (if not more) and you can't deny it.

russia,3dzozt,alex_n_t,3,Tue Jul 21 11:24:15 2015 UTC,"religion?   Belarusian  viewpoint (no doubt quite biased, but much better informed than e.g. an average Russian's from Siberia would be -- we were sort of in the middle of the whole thing, after all):  No, between Russia and Poland it was ages old rivalry for the title of the Ruler of all Slavs. It was going back and forth for a while until Poland lost big in 1772 (they, or should I say ""we"", had a weird form of constitutional oligarchy-turning-anarchy -- not unlike Ukraine today -- which basically caused the kingdom to collapse from the inside) and was pretty much consumed by Russian Empire by 1795.  Poland's last serious attempt at a comeback was in 1919 when they captured some Belarusian lands from the soon to be USSR. Those were subsequently taken away from them in 1939, causing perpetual butthurt that lasts to present days.   Then there was also the Warsaw uprising of 1944, but that's a separate story (of Poland's continuous attempts at being smart ass before and during the WWII that failed horribly).    Lithuania and Poland were never rivals, except for the brief 20 years of 1919-1939 when Poland had Wilno (Vilnius), which Lithuanians believed to be theirs (in reality at the time Poles, Belarusians and ""Lithuanians""1 had roughly equal claims2 ). Wilno was eventually given to Lithuania by USSR in 1939, and the grateful Lithuanians have passionately hated USSR ever since (or at least that is what their government keeps telling them today).    1 Before being joined to Russian Empire in 1772 modern Lithuanian, Belarusian and some Ukrainian territories were all called ""Duchy of Lithuania"", modern Lithuania just happened to ""inherit"" the name after the Russian Empire fell. Think ""Romania"" vs ""Roman Empire"". Lithuanians ""love"" that analogy, the ensuing butthurt is swift and usually quite spectacular.  2 If you look at modern maps, Vilnius is only ~10 km away from the Belarusian border. The city was given to Lithuania to secure their friendship (funny how that worked out in the end, eh?), and probably also so that they had at least one city worth calling a ""capital""."
russia,3dzozt,Paravin,3,Tue Jul 21 04:17:09 2015 UTC,I don;t think the attempt at independence from 1944 was really Poland trying to be a 'smart-ass'.
russia,3dzozt,alex_n_t,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:53:45 2015 UTC,"Well, by saying ""Poland"" in this case I am referring to the government specifically.   Their government wanted to have nothing to do with the Soviet Union, but still wanted to exploit the Soviet Army's success in liberation of Warsaw at the same time. Classic case of wanting to have the cake and eat it too.   I guess their plan was then to say: ""Ha-ha, commies, what took you so long? We liberated ourselves in the meantime! Now we're in charge, no support for you!"" Stalin, of course, couldn't have that. The common citizens suffered as a result as is always the case -- no surprise there either."

russia,3dzozt,alex_n_t,0,Tue Jul 21 11:37:00 2015 UTC,"Is this what you people believe?   Well let's see...   Holy fucking shit.   The Lithuanian part I constantly witness first-hand, including this very sub. They were given Wilno (which they had 0% chances of recovering from Poland on their own), yet today they still condemn the ""annexation of Polish lands by the USSR"" in 1939, despite 1/3 of those lands being their current capital, which they desperately wanted since 1919.   Holy shit.   I'm referring to the Poles' attempt in 1944 to not ally with the Soviet Union (they remained anti-Soviet), but still piggyback on the Soviet Army's advance and take control of Warsaw while the Soviets were busy chasing away the Germans for them. So they started the uprising just a few days before the Soviet Army was expected to enter Warsaw. To which the Soviets said ""oh no, you don't"" and let the Germans slaughter1 the uprising before liberating Warsaw themselves.   Oh, and I fully expect the Poles to have an entirely different perspective on the events, duh.  1 Make sure to ask your Ukrainian friends about Oskar Dirlewanger and the exploits of their compatriots under his command in Warsaw. Azov folks love him.  Now, if you make the effort of expressing your concerns in a more coherent way, I can attempt to address them."

So Russia has no reason to invade whatsoever.   A key issue. No Latvian will think our local Russians are oppressed. Hell, all ethnic Russians I deal with on a daily basis never would use the word ''oppressed''. Oppression is a strong word, like genocide. And Russians, for example, would never use ''genocide'' to describe what happened to Latvians. We would never use ''oppression'' to describe what's happening in Latvia right now. Know what the biggest issue is? It could be oppression, but it would only change the fact that Moscow would use it as a tool to split the society even more, or use it as a geopolitical tool. Local Russians here are worthless in the eyes of the Kremlin, much as they would like to believe otherwise. My girlfriend said it best ''Latvians think of us as Russians, Russians think of us as foreigners, we have no real home''.   In my opinion Latvian RUssians should abandon the concept of the Russkij Mir, which is prevalent through many. Want to or not, but you're going to have to deal with us, and we're going ot have to deal with you. We're not deporting you or doing ethnic cleansing, and you're not going to turn Latvia into a quasi-Russian state. At the same time, we're not going to give you official language rights, and you're not going to be learning Latvian. Where's the middle ground? The middle ground is so low on the ground from our position in the clouds with all of our pride, neither side will ever see it."
russia,3dwfhn,Paravin,2,Mon Jul 20 12:07:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Latvia. But in Estonia we have had several unofficial polls, which say that local  Russians would defend Estonia from invasion if there was a need. It shows, that only a vocal minority would want Russia back here. In conscription I had many Estonian-Russian friends as well, and they were even more patriotic than us- Estonians.  But I agree, our countries shold have it's own army too just in case. Possible agression by Russia is seriously overhyped indeed, but you can never know. At least our borders are secured, and we have the might to take down any ""green men""   if needed."
russia,3dwfhn,estvik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:40:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, the treatment of Russians in LV can be descibred as oppression, as it fits the definition. But, It cannot be compared to the oppression of the jews in germany in the 30-40's. So it's a hard sell. But describing the situation as ""Treatment like second class citizens"" is something everyone can agree on.  Genocide - the treatment of Latvians and deportations are not genocide. Genocide means that the killing/deportations were ethnic based. In Latvia they were class/ideology based.  Your girlfriend described the situation perfectly.   Something you have to understand, is that the Russians in Latvia can be separated into 2 groups: Those who consume Russian media, and those who don't. Those who don't - can't be manipulated in any way by the Russian gov't. They have a lot of information at their disposal, and see that the EU way of life is superior. Those who do - thankfully they are mostly the older gen. And the older gen rarely goes to demonstations. Young adults in this group are few and far between, and they don't have any weight. And even a smaller percentage of them will be fine with trying to organize a revolution in LV.  I had to google what Russkiy Mir is, and I don't care about it. For me - I'm a Russian in Latvia, i will not assimilate in any circumstance, but integrate? I'd love to (well, i'm integrated, but others aren't) if the govt made a few steps towards me.  Russians around me are starting to understand that they've gotta learn Latvian and English. I seldom see people who expect to survive on just Russian.   Giving Russian language at least some status (many Western countries give rights to languages of minorities) would improve the relations, because we both know Latvia isn't gonna be a mono-ethnic country.    Regarding middle ground - i agree mostly. And i've had moderate success with convincing the people around me that we should work together, rather than bitch and moan about the horrible Latvia. Oh god, don't get me started on the people who say ""Latvia is so bad, like nothing can be done"" and spend all their money on vodka."
russia,3dwfhn,Anterai,2,Mon Jul 20 12:55:42 2015 UTC,"Giving Russian language at least some status (many Western countries give rights to languages of minorities) would improve the relations, because we both know Latvia isn't gonna be a mono-ethnic country.   This is an issue I encountered with my European friends in Latvia as well - we're too focused on Latvian. We need to provide translations for documentation and so on in Russian and English at the very least. No reason to translate street signs and so on, but giving the opportunity to add a copy of an agreement in Russian (done via an official translator) would be great move to make everything easier - right now our state services already unofficially serve people in Russian. Heard it in VID (state revenue service), when I was applying as a microbusiness.   Treatment like second class citizens   I can agree with this in some sense. We're not treating Russians as a minority - we're treating them as a problem. Hell, we're VIEWING them as a problem. That's the biggest issue. There's no middle ground, there's only - ''oh these cuddly minorities with Polish schools and everything :3'' and ''GOD DAMN RUSSIANS NOT LEARNING LATVIAN''. Local Russians deserve their own schools. Obviously teach Latvian, but show them that to love Latvia you don't have to be Latvian. Show them how many great Latvian artists and writers have been ethnic Russians."
russia,3dwfhn,Paravin,2,Mon Jul 20 13:02:28 2015 UTC,"Yup, fucking propaganda man, russians aren't a threat to Latvian, Latvian govt is the biggest enemy. I think govt services being available in all 3 languages will improve the quality of Life in Latvia for all. I also was in VID, and the woman was able to speak Russian, but barely, so I've used Latvian with her. Street signs - translating them to english will make life of Tourists easier, and I'm all for that )   Hell, we're VIEWING them as a problem.   Yup, the propaganda did it's job. We have Russian schools in Latvia, but after the change to bilingual education in the mid 00's, our teachers are supposed to teach in 2 languages. And I can tell you, that that's absolute bullshit.    The books were in Latvian (math, chemistry, physics), the teachers explanations were in Russian. It didn't help us learn Latvian, it made us resent Latvian. For me - i was fine with Latvia, poor, but hey, no biggie. But afterwards it clearly made me felt like it's ""Us vs Them"" in here. It was ""The Latvians want us to have a harder time at school, fuck em"". We were kids, but that's what was what we thought and felt.  If only, instead of spending their time on making us learn in Latvian, they would spend some money on higher quality Latvian teachers - it would have a better effect. Ideally Russians who speak perfect Latvian, rather than teacher who could speak any Russian teaching in middle/elementary school (yes, I had 2 in elem, 1 in middle, and 1 in HS, but she was a darling. Others could speak RU, but only 1 was native RU, and she had the biggest effect on us learningwise).  P.S. We should grab a beer."
russia,3dwfhn,Anterai,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:33:23 2015 UTC,we're in semi-rivalry with Russia   ROFL. Dat delusion of grandeur.
russia,3dwfhn,alex_n_t,4,Mon Jul 20 12:38:28 2015 UTC,"Did I say somewhere that the average Russian has to give a crap about us? In purely political terms we're rivals, as much as Russians like to laugh how ''puny'' and ''insignificant'' we are. For 3 micro countries, Russia spends a lot of time crying over us and discussing us. For 3 small states, we have a lot of pull relatively in the region. It's our wishes that brought NATO soldiers to the doorstep of Russia."
russia,3dwfhn,Paravin,0,Mon Jul 20 12:52:42 2015 UTC,"""Rivals"" implies significant competition that cannot be ignored. Your country cannot provide any, simply based off its size. It's that simple.   It's our wishes that brought NATO soldiers to the doorstep of Russia.   Hate to break it to you, but. As much as the proverbial tail may want to think it's wagging the dog, it is just not the case.  American weapon manufacturers want contracts + NATO wants justification for its existence -> they tell your government that they're moving in -> your government tells you through the state media to be concerned about ""Russian threat"" in order to justify foreign military presence in your country.   Bottom line: your country (government) is in the business of providing justification for the U.S. military spending, and their global dominance through maintaining NATO. Doesn't mean you get to decide anything on your own."

Russia may be evil in some ways (but then who isn't) but a superpower it certainly isn't.  Less than two years into an 'asymmetric' operation in Ukraine and a standoff with the rest of the world for which Russia is a supplier of natural resources and Russia's already on its last legs with its economy on the verge of total collapse and once belligerent MPs who less than a year ago bragged about being included on the western sanctions list now  imploring the all mighty ruler to intercede on their behalf with German authorities to allow them to come to Germany to get medical treatment because the Russian healthcare system has been laid waste to by their criminal laws.

In the graph you posted the Russian GDP per capita was higher than any of the other countries in 1990. Recovering from an economic slump is easier than building a country anew. Plus Russia having huge amounts of natural resources might have helped as well.  The ""West"" wasn't actively working against Russia until Russia started invading it's neighbors, and it still really isn't. The western sanctions mostly apply to individuals and military technology. It was Russia that sanctioned itself the most with the food ban and actually forbidding every non-Russian NGO from working in Russia, or at least making it really difficult.  Also, your data is a bit outdated. By 2014 Hungary and Poland had both overtaken Russia in GDP per capita (PPP), and I'm quite sure Latvia will surpass Russia as well during this year.    That only leaves Romania, Bulgaria and Albania below Russia, but even all of them have had their GDP per capita grow more than Russia since 1990, in both percentage and absolute values."

People think that propaganda can only be in totalitarian societies, the best propaganda is the one that makes you think that you live in a free democratic world where such thing is not possible.   The truly shocking revelation here is the education system. That's the tragedy. These days the media can paint whatever picture they want and people will believe it. I see a lot of propagandist-revisionism concerning history these days. It's pretty bad, especially when I hear pop culture ""historical facts"" from the students.  Here is another sobering reality. The educational system that is currently being promoted and implemented in Russia is mirroring the US. The days of hardcore exams are over. Now it's the typical ""Western approach"" - ""Our students are failing? Fuck it, lower the grade average for passing."" And so the bar is getting lower and lower. Hooray!"

russia,3dvey7,walkmiles,4,Mon Jul 20 10:45:48 2015 UTC,"Now, while Russian media and the hysteria they're pumping out, with all the requisite WWII references likening the ""others"" to Nazis and all sorts of devils, often quite literally equating them to actual Nazis, may be amusing, it nevertheless - in my view - creates a problem.  I've said it before elsewhere, I'll write it here - creating a parallel reality, in which ""the others"" are demonised can't lead to anything good in the long run, unless people are virtually immune to it. This, however, I fear cannot be guaranteed given the media's ubiquitous and layered message.  Some Russian and Russian-aligned posters often like to refer to the Western media as a coherent propaganda machine all using the same template (which due to the fact that the messages are aimed at sometimes very disparate audiences is a quite debatable claim). The Russian media, in my perception, far outmatch whatever the ""Western media propaganda machine"" can put out.  Just be careful how much you demonise the Westerners, lest the people believe it too much and you'll be forced to reel in the hatred you've taught people to believe in."

I don't need Russian media for that (I don't consume it at all, don't have access to it).   All I need is to walk into places like /r/europe (or any predominantly Western/US forum for that matter) and mention e.g. Soviet role in WWII to inevitably hear cool stories about ""Russian barbaric hordes raping everything that moves including small animals all the way to Berlin, while mass-executing their cowardly retreating brethren via NKVD machine-gun squads along the way"".  Keep in mind, I don't think ""Westerners"" are ""evil"", per se. A lot of them, however, are indoctrinated beyond reasonable hope of recovery in the foreseeable future. Which in the current situation makes no practical difference to me."
russia,3dvey7,alex_n_t,2,Mon Jul 20 21:51:28 2015 UTC,"While the soviet role in defeating the Nazis is often ridiculously unappreciated, please don't try and deny the mass rapes that happened.

russia,3dvey7,throwawaytits12345,2,Tue Jul 21 00:15:52 2015 UTC,"Lol, you guys are a living proof of my point, without even realizing it.  Ever wondered, how come that all Allied armies committed atrocities (pretty much a given in a war), but somehow only the Soviet ones are carefully remembered and regularly brought up?  I'm not denying rapes happened. It's, as I said, a given during any war. But the general European public is all too eager to point those out and pretend Soviet Army was somehow unique in that regard. That is very telling of the general attitude of those Europeans towards Russians. Of course, the fact that Soviet Army consisted of dozens of different nationalities, including Ukrainians, Poles, Lithuanians, Georgians, Belarusians, Tatars, etc. is typically conveniently forgotten --- why would that be? Because the goal is to assign blame to Russia and to demonize its population (implied to be 100% Russians, btw, which in itself is ridiculous) --- that's why. And that is what I mainly care about from practical standpoint.   You don't do that to someone you consider ""friends"" or even just ""neutral"". Imagine, if every time an American mentioned Democracy,  /r/europe would gang up on them and rub in their face things like black slavery, native Americans' genocide, and concentration camps for US citizens of Japanese origin during WWII?"

Why do Americans get the unconditional ""glorious liberators of Europe"", while Russians, despite the much greater losses and greater contribution to victory over Nazi Germany, get the ""dirty rapists"" and the "" kinda same as Nazi"" (you've just implied it yourself and didn't even notice)? Can you see how Russians might be not quite appreciative of the ones promoting such ideas?  Also, note how in case of Germany, ""the Nazi did it"" (specific group that was deal with) while in case of the Soviet Union ""the Russians did it"" (all of the country, yet to be dealt with). Also, now you're one step away from yet another gem that is ""USSR"" = ""Nazi Germany"", with the above-mentioned subsequent implication, that Germany =/= Nazi Germany, but RF somehow is still USSR ...because Russians!  Again, I'm not arguing true or false, just that it demonstrates that Russia is viewed as hostile, which causes return reaction.   Same way, WWII was just an example, not the core of the issue. As an unrelated example of yet another common theme -- look how many participants in /r/europe are cheering ""Russia's inevitable economic collapse under the glorious western sanctions""? What kind of reaction / perception of the West do you really expect all those remarks to promote?   Same point: no need for media propaganda when there are kind ""Western"" people and their condescending, contemptuous, or just plain ignorant attitude to do the job perfectly."

Tell them where they err. Explain the nuances.  (Incidentally the rape stories are what prompted me to post this comment about being careful how much hate towards Westerners you incite - e.g. Vassily Grossman's articles on Nazi barbarity that dehumanised the enemy so successfully that Soviet commanders later had to go to some trouble to restore order in their units and stop the rapes; wouldn't work the same way any more for most people, but for people whose only news comes from what state owned media put out in Russia) [do correct me if I am indoctrinated by Western propaganda and the rape stories are all made up]  You see, I come here, albeit it's my contention that, sadly, a number of posters here are indoctrinated beyond reasonable hope of recovery in the foreseeable future, for one thing, and a certain group of them have to be Putinbots, for another - and yet, still I come here. Because I believe in dialogue, even in the face of propaganda madness that makes this dialogue a very hard thing, because I never know whether I am talking with someone who can be genuinely talked to, or just someone following their script, or simply someone who considers me ""the enemy"" (because butt-hurt Polak, because it's Russophobia to say anything bad about Russia, but okay to call this or that nation butt-hurt for disagreeing with The Big Slavic Brother).  (Allow me for a personal anecdote here - all those years ago, I was a kid of four or five, my father was required to stay in the Soviet Union for some time for one reason or the other - and we lived in a place with a few other Polish families, but there were also a few Cubans around, some Bulgarians and so on. Either way - we made friends, as kids do, with some Russians - and I'll never forget the first few times we met this Russian kid who had those radical Soviet toys - I think it was some sort of a VDV paratrooper that we'd parachute from an apartment's window and it'd fly safely down to the pavement. Anyways, the first few times this kid was so, I don't know, surprised, taken aback - resentful - when he found out we were Polish. I had absolutely no idea what he meant with that cold attitude and the way he said - ""Вы поляки"" and I'll never forget how puzzled I was that there were all the other kids we could play with from all over the place, but this one treated us different. Anyhoo, I don't hold it against him.)  Cheers. May we live to see better times and may reason and truth prevail one day."

London-supported ‘drang nach osten' of the German Kaisers, of Hitler, and now of NATO.   Again, I can only say WHAT THE SHIT?!?!   ... Anglo-American NATO delayed their aggression against the CIS ...   Here's a fucking newsflash: NATO isn't going to invade you. Give up the dream, they have no interest in this.   ... they made a major error in staging a coup in Ukraine ...   Eh? What? The Ukrainians staged a revolution, not NATO. Put down the conspiracy crackpipe and wake up to what a horribly corrupt man Yanukovich was/is.    ... before fully completing their colonization of Serbia into the EU.   Again, what the shit? If the Serbians want to join, they may be my guest - but no one is fucking forced into the EU. You come, you come, but we're not coming to get you.   And then there's this whole piece of madness:   ... the oft-stated death toll from Srebrenica of 8,000 is a massive fabrication ...   Oft-stated? Oft-stated by whom? The oft-stated figure I keep seeing is 6,838. You know why? Because that's how many victims have been identified by DN-fucking-A.  And finally:   ... the West's goal is to crush, dismember and destroy Russia ...   Just fucking no. No. The West, as always, wants to sell you Coca-Cola and hamburgers.

russia,3dvey7,gogis79,4,Mon Jul 20 09:24:25 2015 UTC,"The Crimean war wasn't so much about the Balkans as it was about keeping the ottomans propped up so that the Russians couldn't get through the straits, keeping them bottled up in the black sea. It had more to do with British interests in Persia and the east than the Balkans."

They backed up A-H's ultimatum to Serbia when Serbia occupied north Albania in the wake of the Balkan wars, but at the same time British consulates supressed reports of Serbian war crimes during the Balkan wars because they were ""our guys"", referring to Franco-Russian support for Serbia and their place in the continental alliance network, and that was a lot more recent than Crimea."

The country was under emergency rule from 1963 until 2011, banning public gatherings of more than five people.

Если сделать выжимку из того, что идет в западных СМИ по катастрофе рейса MH17, то выходит примерно так:  Боинг был поражен ракетой 9М317 производства концерна ""Алмаз-Антей"", выпущенной из зенитно-ракетного комплекса ""Бук-М1-2"". На вооружении ВСУ стоят ЗРК ""Бук М1"" имеющии ракеты 9М38. Более того, украинские ""Буки"" не могут стрелять ракетами 9М317, ибо не модернизированы до уровня ""Бук-М1-2"". Самое же грустное для РФ в истории с расследованием катастрофы MH17 в том, что у следователей оказалась в руках сама ракета 9М317. Следователи изучили все типы ракет ВВС и ПВО Украины, включая и ракеты 9М38 которые представила Украина. Это позволило сравнить поражающие элементы зенитной ракеты, извлеченные из тел и корпуса лайнера. Химическая экспертиза определила состав металла поражающих элементов, обнаружила частицы материала обшивки и стекла самолета, которые пробивали эти элементы прежде чем поразить людей. За то, что у расследующих историю с малазийским Боингом оказась российская ракета 9М317, которая может быть выпущена только из российского ЗРК ""Бук-М1-2""(разработка 1994-1997 гг., принят на вооружение в 1998 г.) отдельное спасибо надо сказать кому то из ""союзников"" или ""партнеров"" РФ(Беларусь, Казахстан, Азербайджан?). Или это постарался кто то внутри самой РФ? Кроме того в западных СМИ пишут про то, смогли определить точное место запуска и что у экспертов имеются образцы почвы с частицами топлива с места пуска ракеты.

In addition, the rifle would still function without that part. The fact that the Westerners commonly refer to it as a ""Mosin-Nagant"" is russophobic bullshit. It's a good (not great) rifle and Westerners back then couldn't believe that the dumb asiatic barbarian peasant Russians could design a rifle which wasn't too much worse than their state-of-the-art Mausers or Enfields, so they grossly exaggerated Nagant's contribution to the design. Pistolet Makarova (PM) uses the same straight blow-back action and is roughly the same shape as a PP, but has only half of the moving parts, with a lot of the parts serving two or more functions in a completely brilliant manner. It's absolutely rugged and incredibly reliable, which makes suited for defensive carry purposes to this day. It's a slightly larger and heavier pistol, because its straight blow-back design necessitated the extra bulk in order to accommodate the firing of a more powerful (9x18 mm Makarov) round.

It's absolutely rugged and incredibly reliable   so is the German original, and (9x18mm Makarov) round is weaker than 9×19mm Parabellum, Soviets chose it not because its a better round, but because they were afraid if NATO invades and captures their ammo supplies they might use their ammo against them, so they made Makarov round that would not fit NATO 9mm weapons.......the same reason why their AK-74 uses 5.45×39mm and not NATO's 5.56×45mm, they could have just copied Western ammo and be done with it , those 2 calibers do pretty much the same job and have similar characteristics, would be much cheaper to copy than to design a new ammo. They did it so on the battle Americans could not use their ammo in their Western weapons."
russia,3dthef,angryteabag,2,Mon Jul 20 08:17:03 2015 UTC,"You forget that part of the brilliance of these weapons was that they were designed to exploit existing manufacturing capabilities with as little modification as possible.  The different sized rounds were not manufactured just ""to be different""."
russia,3dthef,MarxnEngles,2,Mon Jul 20 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"so is the German original   ...which cost a lot more to produce, both as far as machining and assembly time. My biggest problem with the PP is all the fucking small parts that you can lose during disassembly/cleaning. When I owned one, I would keep spare ejector springs and trigger pins. The ejector spring tended to fly across the room at great speed and get lost. As far as it being just as rugged and reliable as a PM, while I never abused my PP and it never jammed on me, I don't see it being as rugged and reliable with so many more possible points of failure.   Any way, there was never a Walther PP in 9 mm Luger (Parabellum). The most powerful round that is was chambered in was 9x17 mm (.380 ACP), which is slightly weaker than the 9x18 mm Mak. The main reason for 9x18 mm Mak being chosen is because anything more powerful would be too much for a reasonably sized straight blowback system pistol, necessitating a more complex and inherently less accurate Browning (or similar) locking action system that the Soviets wanted to avoid. But yes... 9x18 mm Mak is a slightly wider diameter round, precisely because they didn't want NATO to be able to use it in any shape or form.  5.45x39 mm is only similar to 5.56 mm in a sense that it's a small caliber high velocity intermediate round. However, it's very different in design. First of all, the case is 39 mm (same as 7.62x39 mm) simply because it required less retooling to mass-produce. The bullet is much longer than the 5.56 mm NATO one and used a different mechanism of wounding: it has an offset center of gravity which makes it inherently unstable and prone to begin to tumble as soon as it hits human tissue, creating large temporary cavitation in soft tissue and wreaking  havoc on hard and/or brittle tissue. Whether this gives it superior terminal ballistics is a point of contention, but it is a rather novel bullet design."

russia,3dthef,anarquistos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:41 2015 UTC,"Seriously though, Vintovka Mosina obr. 1891 is an incredibly historic and important weapon in many ways. First of all, it was the very first industrial era firearm issued to Russian troops which was of domestic design. It replaced an American-designed single-shot Berdan Rifle. There was a design competition and the design of an obscure army captain Sergei Mosin, won over the more refined, but more complicated design by the established weapon designer Leon Nagant. The production rifle ended up borrowing one non-critical element of Nagant's design and from what I recall, the guy was upset that he didn't get credit and loyalties for it, filing a patent infringement lawsuit. However, by that time, like today, almost every firearm borrowed some design elements from other weapons - there are only so many ways to mechanically accomplish the same thing. Somehow, in the West, the whole thing got twisted into the backward Russia really wanting, but not being able to come up with a good domestic design, ripping off and misattributing another Western one, and the term ""Mosin-Nagant"" stuck. The feud with Nagant obviously didn't last, as in a few years, he submitted his design for a service revolver, which won the competition, was adapted by the Imperial Army as ""Revolver systemy Nagana obr. 1895"" and made him a lot of money. Eventually, the word ""Nagant"" became synonymous with ""revolver"" in the Imperial Russia and then the Soviet Union.  Back to the Mosin Rifle: it served in the Russo-Japanese War and through both World Wars. Although the accuracy was inconsistent between each weapon, the most accurate ones were capable of 1 MOA and even less, and were selected as sniper and marksmen weapons, which became deadly in the hands of some of the world's most successful snipers. It wasn't replaced as a sniper rifle in the Soviet service until the excellent and novel SVD was introduced in the early 60's. However, it's still being seen used in a sniper role all over the world - from Eastern Ukraine to the Middle East, which makes it one of the longest-serving modern era weapons in the world."

russia,3dq38p,9Tskid,22,Sat Jul 18 10:04:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not Russian. I'm some kind of westener. I've been to Russia a few times and met the locals, as I have been to the States (US), other european countries, and two african ones.  Let me tell you about my -obviously partial- idea about them.  It is difficult to talk about the ""average Russian"" as it'd be to talk about the ""average American"": would you pick up a latino from NY, a southern from Alabama, an engineer from San Francisco? All very different sorts. Same happens with Russia, that elongates from Europe to the farthests parts of Asia.  That being said...  That hypothetical ""average"" Russian is well educated, well read, with a good culture. Culture there is not only an asset but appreciated by itself. Of course there are many exceptions, but I found there a true appreciation for culture among different classes, not an hypocritical or superficial appreciation for culture in the middle class (some Western countries).  Russians are proud. It is not a fool void sense of proud - they can be very critical with themselves too. Their proud comes more from a deep connection of themselves with their ""motherland"". This proudness applies also to their lifestyles (I do as I want) and their perception of each other. This applies to anything, even to science. They don't doubt to be different and dare the establishment.  Russians are intelligent. Of course, there's a bit of everything as anywhere else. But the "" average"" is much more mentally developped than in other places. This for me is the true asset of Russia. If they were able to properly exploit it and work together more, they could achieve amazing things.  Russians are passionate people. Maybe a bit cold if you are an stranger, but then all warmth when you get closer to them. And they really have an internal world to share with you.  Putin? Russian recent history has been tough. The 80's and 90's were not easy moments to live there. Putin has put some end to that and some perceived order. The memories of the 90's were so terrible that that is considered a big asset. Some Russians also fear what could happen if a weaker politician was in charge. At some point they will grow out of that fear and it will happen, but it's going to take time.  All in all, Russians are great people. With drawbacks as everyone. But sincere (and this is so rare in the West), loyal, friendly (when you know them)... If I had to choose one travel abroad as the only one in my life, that one would be Russia.  That said, the language is beautiful but fuckingly difficult for a westener... очень трудний язык"

I don't drink vodka even on monthly basis (prolly my last time was like 3 years ago), I never voted for Putin and I don't believe he is competent state leader. I am concerned about growing influence of Orthodox church in the field of public behavior norms/morale. I don't support 'liberal opposition' due to extremely high count of retards amongst its ranks.  Im absolutely against increased military spending and sponsrship deals like buying oil from Iran. I do see that we are heading nowhere with lack of major infrastructure reforms/investement.  My POV on foreign politics - noone is a good guy there. US government, Russian government, whatever government - all of them were always acting like some gangland thugs doing their business. Stronger one is always right, morale, ""truth"" or facts are nothing. It was like that for all human history. We are in pretty bad shape for now, still pretending to be a world power - for me it seems counter-productive.  Russian average healthcare is pretty good for its price, taxes are still okay (thou government is slowly rising them). No bears on the streets. I hope that helped you a bit."

For the record, I totally concur with those people. I voted Putin back in 2000. Then I quit voting because it was a landslide every time.  I am being paid by the Russian government, as part of my job description, although obviously not for the reddit comments and/or furthering the agenda.

russia,3dq38p,wonderfulme,6,Sat Jul 18 18:36:57 2015 UTC,It's not a question of rigged elections. It's not a question of real-life candidates being DQ'ed. There are zero candidates to challenge Putin at this very moment of time.  That was also true with every Presidential election he won.  None of that was rigged. None of that needed to be rigged.
russia,3dq38p,wonderfulme,7,Sat Jul 18 18:40:43 2015 UTC,"But don't you think this is actually a very dangerous thing ? Not even discussing the reasons behind the lack of real opposition, but if tomorrow Putin was to miss a step, fall down the stairs and break his neck, it seems that Russia would suddenly be in an extremly bad spot. I don't believe Medvedev has the power to hold the different elite groups united, and those people would probably very quickly be at each other's throat."
russia,3dq38p,Pelomar,5,Sat Jul 18 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"That's indeed a very valid concern and that would be pretty much a downer.   Should Putin die tomorrow, I wouldn't even want to imagine the consequences. On one hand, we got that Medvedev dude who is currently a PM and Putin's bitch so we would probably have a smooth transition of power, although nowhere in the Constitution it says what exactly are we supposed to do once the sitting President is  dead. Anyway, it would be safe to assume that the presidential powers would transfer to his second-in-command, namely, Medvedev.  The problem is, as it's commonly understood, Putin and Medvedev have very different spheres of influence, regarding the powerful businesses, businessmen and more importantly people within the government ""inner circle"".  Medvedev is very much an outsider in that regard.  So what exactly would happen should Putin just die? A great deal of chaos.  Medvedev would be the interim Prez, a great deal of shit would go down, a year down the line the elections would be held and Medvedev would probably be reelected. Because, again, we don't have a half-assed alternative.  Economics-wise, that would be devastating.  Those are the the risks of one-man-government."
russia,3dq38p,wonderfulme,2,Sat Jul 18 19:22:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think Medvedev is the next candidate. This dude is ok with Skolkovo, he's a geek-nano guy - let him do it! So I think Rogozin is pretty much the next one for the presidential campaign. He's not that publicly well-known but he runs a lot of things and I believe really does his work instead of going to the tv shows every night."
russia,3dq38p,kosmocats,2,Sun Jul 19 06:35:02 2015 UTC,No way in hell. Rogozin is a twitter-bot with no real backing.  Shoigu would be my uneducated guess.

russia,3dq38p,Pelomar,3,Sat Jul 18 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"There's zero choice, unless things go seriously awry. Even then. You can't just outright change the President in Russia. That's going to have a proper fucking butterfly effect.  Because the ministers are going to get changed instantly by whoever comes in (and that's a huge ""who"", I'm betting on Shoigu, the Defense Minister).   And there goes out the window all the cronyism in government-controlled corporations which is regrettably huge only to be replaced by the new cronyism.  This turnaround, along with political uncertainty, is going to basically bring the country to a stop. How long will it take to recover is anyone's guess.  So basically I'm looking forward towards Putin's 63th bday and very much hoping that if and when he leaves, at least he gives our new overlords an extensive orientation."
russia,3dq38p,wonderfulme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:53:47 2015 UTC,"Basically and overall, considering today's political situation, there's no alternative to Putin, by a tremendously long shot.  If he were to step down gradually, like health concerns or anything, he'd name his successor and that successor would get voted in in a landslide.  There's little to no talk regarding the successor just because the man behind the wheel is not going anywhere anytime soon. But I'm plenty sure that this scenario has been thoroughly researched and is being researched as we speak.  My guess would be Shoigu, the current Defense Minister. Doesn't mean I agree with that, but that would be logically sound."

russia,3dq38p,Sanity_in_Moderation,5,Sat Jul 18 15:19:53 2015 UTC,"I'm from Siberia, from Novosibirsk. It is economical center of the region, 1 million people live there, so you can call it ""populated pocket"". ""How many months can you go outside without a coat?"" In our parts (relatively south) for like 6 months, but it really depends on person and wheather. Do you have wild meat readily available like reindeer? Never met actually, but I think you can try and search. Partridges are being sold, but not in large amounts. ""What is life in Siberia actually like?"" Well, like in every place on the Earth it basically depends on your wealth. But talking about some features:  1) we have really expensive houseroom (if you want buy it, not rent), given our average income.  2) We have many people grown up in another country - USSR and it really affect out culture, habits and prejudices, sometimes in really strange manner. 3)Weather like in any regions distant from seas and oceans is really severe (from -40C in winter (-25 - normal) to +35C in summer (in shadow, but it is rare). 4) Almost all our buildings (both residential and industrial) are very old (built in 50-70s) and so mainly in bad conditions. And we don't construct much at the moment, so tendency is not promising You may ask more stuff, do not hesitate"
russia,3dq38p,emseelay,2,Sat Jul 18 16:39:46 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I have two follow up questions.     We have many people grown up in another country - USSR    Are there a large number of people who were sent to Siberia (for whatever reason) by the USSR that never left and now live there as their home?  Do the older buildings require an abnormal amount of upkeep due to the extreme weather conditions?  Do individuals try to reinstall modern insulation to make them warmer in the winter?
russia,3dq38p,Sanity_in_Moderation,3,Sat Jul 18 21:30:42 2015 UTC,"From Novosibirsk too. For your first question the answer is ""yes"". My grandmother's parents were of polish origin, sent to Siberia for some unknown reason, they died shortly after. There are a lot of stories like that. Another factor is heavy industry re-location during 1941-1942 - they were sending here all they could from soon to be occupied western parts of USSR. A lot of people stayed for life. During USSR years there were also a policy of sending educated specialists to Siberia to develop local industry, culture and whatnot.  Upkeep of older buildings have been growing over the years. But the real problem is heating/water/electricity prices. Russian government failed to invest into this infrastructure in 2000s, and now the upkeep prices are out of control. I worked in power generation for some time and it is also a known fact that our power plants are in decline. Siberia has relatievly new power generation stuff, but in European part there are plants built in 30-40s and so on. Overhauling these objects is expensive and has certain limits, and we failed to build new powerplants. They tried to reform this industry, but 2008 crisis ended those efforts in a heartbeat.  When central heating system works (and most of the time it works okay, soviet engineers knew their shit) our buildings are warm. Well, when something breaks it sucks. I remember the 2010 winter that I lived through w/o heating, was fun."
russia,3dq38p,AzeinLoL,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:10:22 2015 UTC,"AzeinLoL answered nicely, but talking of     Do individuals try to reinstall modern insulation to make them warmer in the winter?     Surely yes. In 2007 or so we had kind of fashion - plastic windows. And they are way better old ones. Most of the upkeep consist of some cosmetic work thogh."

The ones who didn't already leave in the 1990's probably won't bother leaving now, seeing how Russia is doing better than many EU countries.

I am assuming you are talking about energy, which for some reasons viewed as the ultimate trump card by Russians, but I fail to see why. ""Cutting off your nose to spite your face"".  Russia is reliant on selling its energy resources and not doing so with hurt Russia's economy greatly, not saying that it wouldn't hurt the EU, just that Russia stands to suffer as well.  In addition, if you don't sell to EU you are going to need another buyer willing to pay comparable prices to EU.  China?  They already pay cheaper rates than any other country in EU based on the big deal that happened last year.  Unless there is a war no way it will ever get cut off, its an empty threat.  What the threat has done, is seem to convince some European countries to fastrack any desire to ween themselves off the need for Russian Energy.  So the real question is, can the EU become Russian energy independent faster than Russia can diversify its economy, I have my opinions but a lot can happen.     The ones who didn't already leave in the 1990's probably won't bother leaving now, seeing how Russia is doing better than many EU countries.   So using a link you had in a previous response, I updated to include most European countries.   I guess you can say Russia is doing better than, but it would be just as true to say many countries are doing better than Russia.  In fact you could go further and say most EU countries are doing better than Russia, which would mean Russia is doing worse than average.  Maybe where you live below average is good, but where I live below average isn't something to tout.      While on the other side, there is the Novorossiyan army, which is entirely made of volunteers, fighting and risking their lives because they want to join Russia.   It widely accepted that some percentage(the percent is debated) of these volunteers are Russian citizens who come over the border.  Don't you have an issue with that, isn't that  huge red flag, pardon the pun, that something is incredibly fishy.  If any country in the world allowed it citizens to cross its border into a conflict zone with the purpose of liberating that area in order to join said home country, it would be met with a huge amount of criticism.  And that's not even touching the reports that have claimed not all of these individuals are volunteers."

The EU is a weak zone of growth under 2% average  and the entire industry  of eastern europe  depend on cheap energy output.  Furthermore a dozens of members do not see Russia as threat and a minority see it like that.

My point was that Russia can't just go cutting of the energy supply to the EU without hurting itself.

Europe has nothing on the table and they  likely sources are shaky.   As a commodity trade you should be aware that the deal China-Russia did resulted in prices below even that of all EU countries   Reports show that the price China will pay looks to be around $350 per thousand cubic meters, which is on the lower end of what European consumers pay for Russian gas under discounted long-term contracts tied to world oil prices.   But for comparison , Germany the biggest customer of Russa pay 370$. This is a good bargain from the part of the Russian while by 2020, China is likey to overthrow Germany as its  biggest customer.   As a commodity trade you should be aware that the deal China-Russia did resulted in prices below even that of all EU countries, prices that China was paying to Turkmenistan.

Some countries have already said or even said thay they will increase gaz cooperation with Russia or stay witht the statu quo.

So that's the 28 member states in the EU, plus Norway, Switzerland, Albania, Iceland, Montenegro, Ukraine, and Moldova for a total of 35, to me that seems like a majority in Europe.  And you said there were dozens, so at least 24, but there are only 21 countries left in Europe.  You're statement is completely false and incredible misinformed.     But they will use the threats whenever they want   My point was if Russia just shuts off the gas it will set a dangerous precedent that will cause many nations to reevaluate a proposed deal with Russia.  Will they change, its hypothetical and we won't know what happens until it does.  As a trade you should be comfortable with the idea that risk is price into the value of a stock, and a risk of a shut off will cause countries to want to pay less for the good/service(and of course I know there are other factors that could easily change the equation).   Reports show that the price China will pay looks to be around $350 per thousand cubic meters   As you are probably very much aware the actual gas prices are a secret and I've seen estimates from 300 to 400, but if I recall correctly China pays around 340-350 to Turkmenistan, a price they wanted to pay to Russia.  You mention Germany's price which is one of the lowest rates in Europe.  To me threatening to sell any item to someone else for cheaper than they already get for that item is a dubious threat.  The whole agreement, while beneficial for Russia, seems to indicate that Russia was negotiating under some duress as they backed of their price point to me China's.  I'm sorry you don't understand the apartment example, it perfectly valid and apt for an example on economics.  It's the same thing as if you paid for internet through your provider(ISP) and they kept threatening to cut off your service, or throttle you back.  While not all people would switch, many people even if it might cost them more would switch to a different ISP, one that won't threaten you.  Just as Russia was willing to get less money by selling gas to China rather than Europe because it suits their agenda(better relations, future agreements...whatever)  I think countries right now are staying the course because there are a plethora of outcomes from this whole situation, and no one wants to make a wrong move.  But a constant threat of a lengthy period of time will change behaviors, and you can't argue that.  If someone threatens to kill you everyday of your life, assuming the threat is legitimate(ability/desire) you would change your behavior or how you interact that with that person, its human nature.     This is exactly what allow Russia to use those threats despite they know well they might be at risk. Furthermore right now it is Russia that has the bargain power not the customers at least until 2030.   Both Europe and Russia are dependent on each other, regardless of if they like it or not.  Short of war, I don't think Russia will ever turn off the gas, they have just too much to lose.  They probably have less to lose than Europe, but still much to lose and that's why its an empty threat, because it won't ever happen."

It is up to Ukraine's border guards to stop them.  Also, I do not doubt that the Russians who volunteer often get help from private sponsors, or an understanding wink from their commanding officers if they are soldiers taking time off near the UA border.  I was going to fly to Rostov (I live and work in the US) and see if I can go across the border and volunteer, but my wife flipped a shit when I ran that by her.

It's like some poor English-speaking region of Mexico starting a civil war to separate from Mexico and join the US. Obama would be like, ""uhhh... ok, we appreciate you love us so much. Here's some humanitarian aid. Please stop fighting.""  The lack of western perspective/insight on the Ukrainian civil war is absolutely insane."

""uhhh... ok, we appreciate you love us so much. Here's some humanitarian aid. Please stop fighting.""   Its mutually exclusive for Russia to say stop fighting while at the same time allowing soldiers, with a wink and a nod, to cross the border and fight this conflict.  You can't say you want your neighbors kids to stop drinking and having parties in the backyard if you keep giving your kids permission to go party with them.  And from a westerns prospective the lack of sincerity by Russia is incredible apparent.  It's deny deny deny.  Think about the denial of any Russians involved in these areas, to maybe a few are getting through but without or approval, and then as you said some soldiers are given a wink and a nod and then go over.  Its a pattern of deceit that leaves the west guessing what is true and where do the lies end.    The US would face just as much outrage if they allowed their soldiers to take vacations in Canada or mexico to fight for a group who's aims are to join the US.  You can tell me all you want that Russia doesn't want this region, but the pattern is there and that is what worries the west.  In the US, and what I would assume is the rest of the west, the idea of annexation is that ultimate taboo given past history.  Just because you can annex doesn't mean you should.  So to you you feel the west lacks perspective, but to the other side it feels just the same which is why there is a conflict.  The US has returned or granted independence to almost all the the lands gained as a result of WW2.  Russia while an over net loss due to other events has still a couple major holdings which Russia claims will never go back.  That resonates with other countries, whats mine is mine and whats yours is negotiable.  You have a friend who never lets you use or borrow their stuff, but likes to use and borrow your stuff, you probably don't want to be friend with that person.  It's not that you hate that person or you want to see that person fail, you just don't want to be their friend."

Russia does not have a strong economy, economically Russia is a shambles, it's got perhaps the worst case of the Dutch disease in recent history.   In this sort of situation acting as if it were a superpower is a disaster to Russian it's tantamount to a national suicide  but that's exactly how Russia's been acting this past year and a half. It's stupid and incompetent. It's Putin and his crew believing in their own Potemkin villages. They're delusional. Under Stalin they would all have been executed: he state duma, putin, the government the whole lot of them."
russia,3dq38p,igorfazlyev,4,Sat Jul 18 19:16:40 2015 UTC,"It was and still is in a bad economical shape, but the west forced his hand. It's a choice between bad and worse. Thanks for the lesson in real politikz m80."
russia,3dq38p,IceBunz,-2,Sat Jul 18 19:26:42 2015 UTC,"The west didn't force Russia's hand. Sure with their involvement in Ukraine they kind of threw down the gauntlet and all but, my question is when Nuland was giving out free cookies on Maidan, where was Russia's ambassador to Kiev Zurabov? Or even before that, when the west was funnelling money into all sorts of pro western NGOs in Ukraine and what not, where was Russia funnelling its money into? I'll tell you where: into the pockets of high ranking governmetn officials who went and spent that money to buy property in the west for themselves and their families.   If Russia had been more involved and active in Ukraine from the get-go, Maidan would never have happened in the first place but even when it did happen, Russia still had lots of options, instead of backing Yanukovich until the bitter end, Russia could said, diplomatically, that it would support whatever choice the Ukrainian people might make, and then it could have applied economic pressure to help the next Ukrainian government see the light. I mean there were and still are lots of options, however, the current Russian government is too stupid and incompetent to have seen any of them."

russia,3dq38p,igorfazlyev,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:26:26 2015 UTC,"Russia is doing its best to live is current world. And russian invasion, if we consider it as real invasion, because there are still no evidence) but let's imagine: it is not as bad as Iraq and Libya, for example.  Oligarchs now follow russian laws and they give some part of their money to people, pay for russian football team or build churches for example.  West's attitude  and behavior drive people insane"
russia,3dq38p,Muncher32,-3,Sat Jul 18 16:44:24 2015 UTC,"how do you mean there is no evidence of a Russian invasion in Ukraine: Russia has ANNEXED Crimea - and if you remember the sequence of events: first Russian troops 'occupied' Crimea and then a referendum was held to 'legalise' the fait acompli.   As for Russia's involvement in the east Ukrainian insurgency: 70% of the militant forces in Donetsk and Luhansk are made up of the so called 'Russian volunteers', even Donetsk and Luhansk authorities aren't denying that. Plus, Strelkov, the guy that started the insurgency in East Ukraine and without whom, by his own admission, nothing would have happened there, is a Russian citizen, the first prime minister of Donetsk Peoples Republic was a Russian citizen: what further evidence of Russian involvement do you need? And how exactly is what's happening in East Ukraine better than what happend in Iraq or Libya? Go tell that to the relatives of all the civilians that have been murdered there. Sure a lot of them were killed by Ukrainian fire, but even on Russia's state owned channel 1 they showed footage about East Ukrainian insurgents firing grenade launchers on Ukrainian forces from an apartment block in which some apartments were still occupied by civilians.   Oligarcsh do NOT follow Russian laws and they do NOT give any money to the people. When Gazprom CEO's car went into an oncoming lane on Moscow's ring road and crashed into another vehicle, murdering two women there, one of the women, the one that was behind the wheel of the other car was postumously found gulty, you know how much money Rosneft CEO makes a day? about 5 million roubles.   IN the west there are problems, but at least people can talk about them openly. IF you want insane, watch Russian TV where black is white, white is black and two and two always makes a five. That's unrefined insanity for you."
russia,3dq38p,igorfazlyev,2,Sat Jul 18 19:25:07 2015 UTC,I will not talk to someone who advocates 90s - the time when Russia was losing 1 mil people every year.
russia,3dq38p,Muncher32,-3,Sat Jul 18 19:59:27 2015 UTC,"and how many people per year do you think Russia is losing now?  Everything has to be looked at in persepctive.  In the mid 2000s Russia had a pretty good period, primarily thanks to soaring oil prices, but, unfortunately, Russia never capitalised on it, instead the economy has been monopolised, small business has been crushed and now that the country is facing a new crisis (mostly self-inflicted), its economy really is in a far worse shape than it was in the late 1990s.   Btw note, that an economy is a very complex system with significant time lags. The boom of the early through mid 2000s was to a large extent a result of the unfinished eonommic reforms and liberal policies implemented in the 1990s. The self inflicted economic crisis we're seeing in Russia now is a result of Putin's 'vertical of power' total monopolisation policies of the mid to late 2000s."
russia,3dq38p,igorfazlyev,-4,Sat Jul 18 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"How did Russia threat neighbors last years?    Chechnya, South Osettia, Crimea, Ukraine. Georgia might be added to that list soon, if Russia's recent antics near Georgia are taken into consideration."
russia,3dq38p,afan101,2,Sat Jul 18 23:01:00 2015 UTC,"okok, Chechnya? that's not a Russian neighbor, that's Russian territory. That's really nice how you ""extended"" the name of the territories to make the list bigger and more impressive - Crimea, Ukraine, S. Osettia, Georgia. But just for the record - there was no any threat initiated by Russia. In both cases (Georgia, Ukraine) it was a provocation on that territories that have either russian peacemakers on the zones of ""frozen conflicts"" - Georgia/Osettia, or russian naval base - Ukraine. Russia'd had to act in those cases. Whoever started it, was aware of that."
russia,3dq38p,kosmocats,-2,Sun Jul 19 07:41:50 2015 UTC,"In both cases (Georgia, Ukraine) it was a provocation on that territories    Absolute lie. Russia started the entire Georgian conflict:   They deployed soldiers and machinery to Abkhazia in May 2008, months before the entire conflict Also in May, they sent 300 troops to Abkhazia under the pretence of repairing a rail line, which was used to transport soldiers during the war, a few months later. Days before Georgia even attacked the Russian peacekeepers, the separatists already were already shelling Georgian villages! Even the OSCE agreed with this. Also a few days before Georgia attacked the peacekeepers, thousands of North Ossetian villagers were evacuated from the area representing 90% of the future combat zone. A few days before the war began, Russian troops who were doing military exercises near the Georgian border did not leave when they were finished with the exercises and instead stayed. They then participated in the war   I regard the Russian-Georgian war as Russia's Iraq. They were looking for an excuse  to invade. They began sending troops long before Georgia even attacked the peacekeepers. This is all common knowledge, so please do not try and distort reality. They did the same thing with Crimea. They invaded it with soldiers without insignia under the pretence of protecting them from protesters. They trained Ukraine's special security forces who were the snipers in Euromaidan and who purposely shot at both sides to escalate the conflict and justify a Russian invasion. But they failed. So now they are sending ""volunteers"" just like they did in Georgia.   It's always the same thing: escalate conflict in pro-Russian regions, invade with a pretence of ""peace"", send volunteers. Rinse and repeat."
russia,3dq38p,afan101,2,Sun Jul 19 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"First of all, Russian-Georgian conflict is NOT Russia's Iraq. Either you're trolling or you, no, you just trolling.  The conflict did not start on August 8th, yes, it substantially got worse from the beginning of 2008. In April 2008 the president of South Osettia stated that the georgian army is approaching to the border with Osettia. And there was no any russian troops (except the peacemakers) at that time. The russian media affirmed that the russian troops were furthing to the region, but why not?? There were a bunch of provocations from the georgian side + mass migration of the population (30.000 refugees) out of the region. The decision to send russian troops to South Osettia was a preventing act.  As it goes to Ukraine/Crimea, and your statement that ""It's always the same thing: escalate conflict in pro-Russian regions, invade with a pretence of ""peace"", send volunteers."" - I just want you to understand that those regions are used to be parts of Russia. Long before the Soviet Union. And of course there are russian-speaking population and ethnic russians who live there. Is Russia responsible for that people? Do international society understands that when they escalate the conflicts right at the Russian borders? Yes and yes. Does Russia have a right to have its troops in Crimea during the referendum on independence there? Yes, and it also was a prevention act because right before the referendum there were certain threats from the radical right-wing party of Ukraine. Does Russia have a ligitimate right to have its troops in Crimea even before the referendum? Also yes, cause there is russian naval base on the Black Sea.  Any other questions on Russian invasion of pro-Russian regions?  And a few question just out of curiousity: Do you really believe to the actions of Saakashvili, the dude whose georgian citizenship was taken away and who is now the head of Odessa?"
russia,3dq38p,kosmocats,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:21:11 2015 UTC,"The decision to send russian troops to South Osettia was a preventing act.    Preventing what exactly? Don't make me laugh.   Does Russia have a right to have its troops in Crimea during the referendum on independence there? Yes, and it also was a prevention act because right before the referendum there were certain threats from the radical right-wing party of Ukraine.    This is just a Kremlin excuse. Russia even sent far-right neo-Nazis as observers to the Crimean referendum! Provide evidence that the right-wing groups of Ukraine were taking over Crimea and that the Russians simply wanted to protect the citizens. On the contrary, it was Russia that sent heavily armed troops to Crimea, without insignia, denied to the international world that they invaded Crimea and said that they were simply ""self-defence groups"" who had somehow gotten Russian military equipment, They also said that these troops had cars with Russian licenses because ""they bought them and put them on their cars"". Are you kidding me? Then they wonder why the West doesn't respect them. Of course, their guilt was so obvious that a few weeks latern they were forced to admit that that they lied.    Also yes, cause there is russian naval base on the Black Sea.       This does NOT mean that they could invade Crimea and create a false referendum.

The Russians tried bribing them with money. They surrounded their bases. Some gave in because they were greedy. Some because they were scared. Some because they had families to feed and didn't want to be sent back to Ukraine as civilians, in shame. 2 people died? How many people were kidnapped, tortured, beaten, by the Russian invaders? How many unreported deaths are there? The Crimean soldiers did not attack the Russian invaders because they knew that would give Russia justification to start a war. They learnt what Russia had done in Georgia.    Georgia violated international law and attacked russian peacekeepers and then was punished for that.   You are lying.

It's the complete opposite. Russia is currently heading directly to a Cold War 2.0. If you haven't forgotten, the last one gave them a heavy blow. Putin has managed to ruin relations with most of its Western neighbours (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, recently having shaky grounds even with Finland and nothing positive from Romania, Bulgaria or Moldova either). Let's also remember Georgia and I'd also mention Sweden. Its relations with Europe, USA, Australia, Japan etc in general is also worst since Cold War and when a few years ago, it was very close to abolishing visa regime with Europe, it has now delayed it potentially for decades.  What is more, he has managed to get international sanctions on Russia, turned the economy into recession, and has probably the worst reputation among common people in the West since at least 1980s. Things are so bad that it even reaches cultural sphere (booing at Eurovision, Anastasia Prihodko, who represented Russia in 2009, has said not to ever return to Russia, etc). There have also been calls for boycotting FIFA 2018.  Due to Russia's actions in Ukraine, many NATO countries have now pushed for boosting defence and getting American troops inside their territories, shifting US troops even closer to Russia. What is more, Ukraine is now actively looking for NATO membership. This has had again drirect negative effects on Russian foreign policy and its security.  So, whatever you say about Putin, he is definitely had extremely negative effects on foreign relations. The only people that actually might think it has been anything good, are Russian chauvinist extremists, who want Russia to be ""respected and frightening"" as in the glorious USSR era and therefore think finding more and more enemies is actually good because it can show Russia like they want. The sad truth is, however, that appealing policies are becoming history and Russia gets more retaliation than ever before.  Oh, also, have fun with Eurasian Union which is already about to collapse. Making a trade union and then having -20% to -30% fall in trade is actually tragic, but oh well, Krim Nash, would suit here I guess."

Eurasian union has certain problems coming from russian economical problems - Russia doesn't grow economically = EAU doesn't grow.   And stop already that shit . The west is not center of the world anymore. SCO and BRICS show everything. I don't even mention that despite sanctions Russia still has good relations with many European countries, including EU members.  Stop living in your imaginary world.

Ukraine is it's OWN country. It is not Russia's territory. It  has the right to choose whatever it wants. By extension, that does not give Russia the right to annex Crimea. It belongs to Ukraine. Simple as that.  When Ukraine was under Russian infuence, there was widespread corruption, pro-Russian oligarchs were kings, any criticism of the government resulted in torture, beatings, kidnappings, imprisonment and even death. The Ukrainian SBU had close ties with Russia's FSB. That is why during Euromaidan, the SBU's HQ was raided and all data regarding cooperation between the SBU and the FSB was destroyed. The Russian spies in the SBU are regarded as being responsible for the sad deaths of protesters during Euromaidan. Hundreds of SBU officers ""defected"" to Russia. Including it's former head!   Now that Russia has left, there is peace in Western Ukraine. But now Russia has retreated into Eastern Ukraine and created a warzone. Anywhere Russia goes in Ukraine, it creates conflict.

They weren't saying anything with certainty. This has been proven in the media. At the time, there was a lot of confusion going on regarding the events.

russia,3dq38p,Muncher32,-3,Sat Jul 18 16:50:47 2015 UTC,"Russia's currently in a far more precarious situation than it was in the 1990s because of Putin. Putin's regime has pretty much destroyed the Russian economy. When Russia had a sovereign debt crisis in 1998, the economy bounced back in less than a year and the way it was done was Yeltsin appointed Priamakov prime minister at the advice of Yavlinski and Priamakov simply left the economy alone. Now the opposite is happening: as the crisis worsens the governmetn meddles in the economy more and more, completely ruining it. Most importantly, Russia currently has an extremely unpredictible political and economic system: the state Duma is passing laws like crazy with a lot of their laws completely changing the system, introducing new taxes and regulations like there is no tomorrow. It is simply impossible to plan ahead and do any sort of business in this kind of environment and then they wonder why is it that in the first six months of 2015 more capital has fled the country than in the entire 2014.  Nobody wants to exist at the whim of mentally unstable legislators and greedy government officials. Russia today is practically hell to what it was 10 years ago (2005) and it's even hell to what it was in the late 1990s because at least back then people could do businss and make a living while toay doing independent is being made practicelly impossible with every law that the state duma passes.  The foreign policy is plain insanity, everything Russia's done in foreign policy this past year and a half has been against Russia's interests. Russia's become a pariah state, isolated, strangled by sanctions with few options left. Russia could afford to pursue a beligirent foreign policy if it was a superpower and an economic powerhouse but Russia is extremely weak economically, dependent on imports in every major area, with a an economy crippled by government meddling: the kind of foreign policy Russia's been pursuing this past year has been suicidal."

I explained why it is worse.   Metaphorically speaking, in the 1990s Russia was like a drowning man: sort of  like a guy who's not been taught how to swim properly but has just been tossed into the water and told to swim or die. Then the soaring oil prices in the mid 2000s sort of gave this man an inflatable lifejacket - he didn't really learn to swim properly, but now with the high oil prices he got this nice life jacket. So what does the man do? he goes ahead and ties his hands behind his back (vertical of power, monopilised state capitalism). Now the oil prices start falling, the air goes out of the inflatable life jacket, the man starts drowning again but his hands are tied behind his back now and what does the man do? Well he goes ahead and in a last ditch effort starts hanging weights on his feet (that's the duma passing new laws to restrict freedom of business)  - what do you think is going to happen to this poor schmuck called Russia?

russia,3dq38p,kosmocats,3,Sat Jul 18 10:48:28 2015 UTC,"Answering your question..I also consider myself as an average Russian, I live in European part of Russia, educated but yet not employed, lol.  Talking about Putin - I'm really proud of that guy. As it was already mentioned here, his approval rating hits 80%, and as some western media wants to put this that only stupid and uneducated people in Russia supports him, it is not true at all. I may say that I was not really happy with his domestic policy a few years ago, but now it's really changing, yeah, unfortunately because of that impulse western sanctions throw at us. But that helped to look indoors at our problems and really see our drawbacks and work on them. As it goes to the international policy of Mr. Putin - he is the man. He has interest of Russia in his heart and by this I don't mean what some countries want to see us/him as agressors, etc, but as the protector of our safety. Let's not forget or minimize NATO's expansion within the few years. There was no any russian aggression at that time, there was no Soviet Union which was why NATO was established, so there are nothing like that anymore, why then need in NATO expansion closer to Russian borders? Also, what I really find extremely offensive, as being a kid that grew up listening to the stories of WWII, - it's how Putin is compared to Hitler. That's waaaaay too offensive, and it's not just because we are the country that beat the fascism, but because both of Putin's parents fought during the war, and his brother died during the siege of Leningrad. I personally don't even know what kind of conscience someone may have to call him LIKE that. I hope my comment kinda makes sense."
russia,3dq38p,Davidhasahead,3,Sat Jul 18 18:09:28 2015 UTC,"Basically, Nato is America's ""friend police"". America was at war with the Soviet Union for 46 years. Now America is basically afraid of Russia becoming a new Soviet Union. If a single gun gets moved in Russia, America will start talking about how Putin is evil and trying to bring back an enemy. Nato is an American gun pointing at Russia incase it ""acts up"".  Also, America has issues with forgetting the past. The Soviets liked to rig elections. So when Putin got a n 80% approval rating, It was assumed to be just that: rigged.  Western media doesn't think the only people supporting him are uneducated. Western media thinks all Russians are uneducated. Western media is not very good with Russia.  Finally, calling Putin Hitler is a very offensive thing to do, but a very American thing to do. Americans know Hitler was bad, therefore calling people Hitler is a good insult. But they don't think about how much worse a person Hitler was to Russia than America.  Hope this helped."
russia,3dq38p,kosmocats,2,Sun Jul 19 05:16:44 2015 UTC,"True. But the worst thing is that Putin says it constantly that we do not have Soviet Union's ambitions on conquiering the whole world, bringing socialism/communism to oppressed countries, whatever. We don't need that, although this is exactly how the West wants to see us. 24/7 Drunk vodka-bear lovers with a single thought on getting more territories for vodka and bear market.

A drunk American college student doing dumb things while drinking beer in russia is vodka and the dumb things are usually in winter.

They are to be implemented both by the President himself and by the Government of Russia within the bounds of their authority. The President’ fundamental positions on domestic policy issues are expressed in his written decisions regarding draft federal constitutional laws and draft federal laws, as well as his letters explaining the reasons for rejecting draft federal laws.  Within the bounds of the authority granted to the head of state by the Constitution and other laws, the President also shapes the basic domestic policy guidelines by issuing legal regulations and through organizational and regulatory activity, such as issuing decrees and executive orders. Each year the President is required to make an Address to the Federal Assembly regarding the situation in the country and the internal and foreign policy of the state.  Foreign policy  The President is invested with extensive rights to implement the state's foreign policy. The President determines Russia's position in international affairs and represents the state in international relations, conducts negotiations and signs ratification documents.

The fact that all the media around you tell you something does not make it true. This applies both to Western and Russian media.

No, that's only a part of it, the more important part of it is, that I know the structure of the media pretty well and know how they work. And they are just not ""orchestrated"".    But no one of us is telling you 9/11 was an inside job.   Sure there were also reports, even pretty prominent on our public media also reporting about those theories, about what speaks for them and what against. There were also long reports about the ""faked"" moon-landing and about what evidence is there and what science can tell us about it. And well, no, I don't need more of that on public TV. Not every position should be represented the same, some are just crazy conspiracy bullshit, and proven wrong by overwhelming evidence. If you want to publish them, you are open to do it, but that's not something the public should and likes to finance.  In difference to such conspiritard stuff, our media e.g. always reported about things like the NSA and the relations to our BND and to our government - a narrative that is often in complete opposition to the government's narrative. Our media kicked our last president out of his office. Our public media broke the most government scandals in our history (while conspiracy media never broke anything).    You said ""non crazy"" stories. Those media define what will look crazy to you.   I said non-ridiculous, not ""non-crazy"". And no, not the media defines that, the stories themselves do. We don't have many stories about our leaders being reptilian aliens ruling the planet or such ridiculous shit, and only a few about the moon-landing being faked or about the twin towers being brought down with explosives. But e.g. on our talk shows about Russia and Ukraine, we always have people from different positions, very often including at least one journalist from the Russian state media, who can tell his narrative. And in addition German pro-Russian journalists.

If they had been more sophisticated, they would have said that MH17 was flying over a war zone, that Holland had issued a warning that very day, that Malaysian Airlines knew about it and chose this route because it saved fuel.   They might have anticipated this possibility by saying anyone flying over this area did so at their own risk.

russia,3dq83j,ukrus,3,Sat Jul 18 14:53:42 2015 UTC,"whose subs?  NATO's?  At any rate, your question is hypothetical and too open-ended."

russia,3dqnov,turdovski,3,Sat Jul 18 15:26:02 2015 UTC,"I remember watching Vice's Russian Roulette when things started to heat up. I noticed that a lot locals were hostile to them filming, they would say ""you all are liars, don't film, you'll lie anyway"". I didn't understand it because it was early on in the conflict but I guess it all makes sense, even back then UA mass media started to fabricate material and this is why locals got all pissed off. Simon then got detained, and come to think of it, this is what it was, opolchenie got pissed off at journalists who were filming and editing, Simon got scooped up along with others for that. Propaganda started to form alternative worldview early on and this is why a lot of Western media started blindly accepting reports from Kiev as true despite the fact that a lot of it was fabricated. A lot of people are still blinded by that. Shariy for example got dismissed as Kremlin's paid shill but in actuality he was reporting legit information and still does but there is so much noise and disinformation around this conflict that most just don't stop to think and re-evaluate their thinking. Some pro-Kiev subs are a good example of it. Once alternative reality has been constructed from the beginning then you can let confirmation bias to do the rest, noise becomes facts. I don't know why I wrote all that, just thinking out loud I guess."
russia,3dqnov,pavelsky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:59:14 2015 UTC,"True...  Actually, nothing new under the sun. All people consist of three types:  those who intentionally accept any evil and any lie and are fine with it as long as it gives them any kind of profit, but only if the evil doesn't affect them personally because when it happens personally it becomes a real evil then;   those who, at any cost, do not accept the evil of any kind - these are the honest, straight and uncorrupted people who are seeking for truth, spreading it wide and far and do that no matter what, even when sometimes it costs them life;   and the rest of people who are hopelessly selfish, indifferent, too lazy to educate themselves and too coward to defend the truth and therefore they can be easily brainwashed to the level when they stubbornly continue believing any bullshit, even when this bs doesn't at all look logical and sane.  This explains why most of people are of the first and third types. Telling truth, defending it and spreading it widely can often be very dangerous and can cost a person not only a comfortable living but even the losing of freedom and even the life. We know lots of such cases. But even when it is not so dangerous, many people still prefer to hide their head into the sand. Being truth-speaker is a thankless job in this fallen world. The truth-speakers are always being mocked, insulted and ignored by the indifferent and blind sheeple.   So, everyone chooses which type of individual behavior he/she to belong - whether to which is ""safer, easier and much more comfortable"" or to the opposite, the "" rather dangerous, difficult and uncomfortable"" one."

Rule 5 is quite clear.  ""If you are replacing the title of the original link, make the new title objective"".  It's not very difficult and requires no brain power to use the title that the article/link already has, but you somehow don't seem to understand.    The problem is that nothing in that article or anything that you have presented with it is valid proof that all the people involved in this situation are fascist. thus you claiming that they are makes your title not objective.  If you don't understand this, or don't think its a stupid rule then maybe you shouldn't post.  It's really quite simple."

russia,3dqnov,Batyrsik,8,Sat Jul 18 20:16:07 2015 UTC,"One of my degrees is in Mathematics, and while doing thousands of proofs I became able to look at a problem(statement/equation) and figure out what you can and can not say.  It's not enough to prove it for 98% or 99%(it is in statistics) because you need to account for everything.    It's like saying everyone in Japan is Japanese, while the majority are, it would only take 1 non-Japanese person to prove that statement false.  So it's a false statement even if its mostly true.  The only fantasy is the one you live in.  I said to you that nothing in your article or supplement information you have supplied in this post proves that everyone involved in this shelling was a Ukrainian fascist.  But you who has failed to provide any proof of something you claim, calls me a liar.  I didn't make the claim, you did, so the onus is on you to prove your statements are objective, and you failed to do that, and thus your title is not objective.  What have I said that was a lie?  Seems like you like to throw around statements and accusations with no proof."
russia,3dqnov,CodswallopLoad,-6,Sat Jul 18 20:43:28 2015 UTC,When you don't believe even what the real video camera has recorded and what ALL witnesses are telling I doubt that even the grass can prove you that it is green.   I bet your another degree is jurisprudential and I can see how you as a judge belong to those of them who send the victims to jail and let the criminals go free.   But remember that those who shamelessly blame the innocent victims do become themselves the victims some day.
russia,3dqnov,Batyrsik,9,Sat Jul 18 21:12:27 2015 UTC,"You are viewing this too emotionally, and the concept isn't that hard.  The videos(2) show the aftermath of shelling and the residents claiming who it was.  Is your burden of proof so low that anything said by someone on a video is proven fact?  I am not saying this incident isn't sad or terrible, but again no where and I can't stress this enough, do you provide proof that everyone involved in this shelling is a ""Ukrainian fascist"".  They are probably all Ukrainian, but at what point did they poll the soldiers on their political affiliations?  It's just your belief that these people are fascists, which is why you put it there and thus by definition you made your title nonobjective.  The term fascist is thrown around so frequently and incorrectly its absurd.  The fascist party from what I know doesn't make up the majority of the political affiliations in Ukraine or its government.  How silly would it be if I said everyone in Russia is gay because I know some gay people in Russia, its stupid and I would be wrong.    And I don't know why you think I jail victims, let criminals go free, and I blame the innocent as I have said nothing on these topics or the context of your article/videos.  I have only commented that your title is not objective and instead of providing proof that you are correct you just say that I am all these other things.  You have a lot of passion in your convictions, but the execution is somewhat lacking."
russia,3dqnov,CodswallopLoad,-5,Sat Jul 18 21:35:30 2015 UTC,"What ""proof"" do you want ? You want me to change the title? I can change it just for you but in no way that would change the FACT of Ukrainian fascists killing the armless civilians.  And if you REALLY want the proofs I invite you to where I am now and I will show you the proofs. LOTS OF THEM. So I am waiting for you ok? You will tell me about the titles then and any other bullshit while I will be showing you the real proofs. OK?  And yes. I am emotional. I do not deny that. But much better to be emotional about unholy war on innocent people than to ""play smartass' while being absolutely indifferent to someone's sufferings.

russia,3dqnov,Soyuz_,7,Sat Jul 18 22:45:34 2015 UTC,"Yes all I've asked is that you post objective titles and be civil.  I didn't say there couldn't be ""Ukrainian fascists killing civilians"", just if you are going to post something claiming that, you need proof.  Either you have proof that the groups of people involved in this particular attack were fascists or you can provide evidence that the majority of the Ukrainian population is voting for or in a fascist political group.  The former is incredible difficult to prove, and the latter isn't true.    Or you could avoid this whole thing by just using the original title, its not that complicated."

russia,3domm9,BaronBifford,10,Sat Jul 18 09:20:02 2015 UTC,"Not really, at least not here in America. Our public school History books are pretty bland, at least when I was in school. They cover such a broad scope of time that there really isn't much detail in them. Of course it's not telling kids that the U.S. is evil, but it's also not really saying the U.S. is the only good place in the world.  They do leave out a lot of things though, the achievements of black Americans and all that shit we did to the Natives for example. But, once you get out into the real historical world, there's all kinds of views. History is not set in stone. People have different interpretations of what happened and what it meant.  If you want an example of this go to /r/askhistorians and ask about Jared Diamond's work or ask them if it was the right move to drop the bomb on Japan. However, real historians won't tell you something because they want to make their country look good, they will tell you because they think it is right.  However, you're right if you're talking about pretty much any time before the invention of the printing press. Before that the only people that could produce information, and thus produce sources, were the people in power.  Modern histories with the help of anthropologists have done a pretty good job at sifting through all the ancient propaganda though.   TL;DR I'm a bit pretentious and like talking about history too much."

russia,3domm9,Dolcester,6,Sat Jul 18 11:32:23 2015 UTC,"Loewen book was a hit by the way   First off, being a hit means nothing. Twilight was a hit. But, lets address that article.    For example, one of the best-selling US history textbooks, ""The American Journey,"" states that even though ""Lincoln and the Republicans had promised not to disturb slavery where it existed,"" many people in the South didn't trust them and feared they would ""not protect Southern rights and liberties,"" which lead to secession.   That is a perfectly legitimate view of events. Is it the one I agree with? Not at all, but that does not mean it's propaganda. At worst it's a symptom of of the business of book selling. If you piss off half off your customers (Texas), they wont buy your books.    The same textbook goes on to say that Southerners claimed leaving the Union was justified because ""the national government"" refused to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act — which stipulated that all escaped slaves were to be returned to their masters upon capture, even when captured by officials in free states — and thus, denied Southern states equal rights.   That's just not true. From ""Confederate States of America - Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union ""   In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have refused to surrender to justice fugitives charged with murder, and with inciting servile insurrection in the State of Virginia. Thus the constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation.    From ""Confederate States of America - A Declaration of the Causes which Impel the State of Texas to Secede from the Federal Union""    The States… by solemn legislative enactments, have deliberately, directly or indirectly violated the 3rd clause of the 2nd section of the 4th article [the Fugitive Slave Clause] of the federal constitution, and laws passed in pursuance thereof; thereby annulling a material provision of the compact, designed by its framers to perpetuate the amity between the members of the confederacy and to secure the rights of the slave-holding States in their domestic institutions-- a provision founded in justice and wisdom, and without the enforcement of which the compact fails to accomplish the object of its creation.   next point.   As for states' rights, Loewen says that's not correct either: ""Confederate states did claim the right to secede, but no state claimed to be seceding for that right. In fact, Confederates opposed states' rights — that is, the right of Northern states not to support slavery,"" he writes.   This one's a bit hard to talk about because ""state rights"" is such a broad thing. However, I believe that in Georgia's succession document  they are talking about states rights.   Our Constitution wisely gives Congress the power to punish all offenses against the laws of nations. These are sound and just principles which have received the approbation of just men in all countries and all centuries; but they are wholly disregarded by the people of the Northern States, and the Federal Government is impotent to maintain them.   All that being said however, I agree with Mr.Loewen. But. my point is history has no right answer. The same events and documents can be interrupted in so many different ways. I would applaud you if you could find me one history textbook, or even normal history books, from any single country, that is filled with nothing but objective facts. If you're interested in the American Civil War I would recommend you check out America Aflame: How the Civil War Created a Nation  by David Goldfield. It's a pretty thick read, but it goes into a great ammount of detail about all the possible causes for the war."
russia,3domm9,blindpringles,-4,Sat Jul 18 12:15:23 2015 UTC,"First off, being a hit means nothing. Twilight was a hit. But, lets address that article.    Loewen is pretty well know academically and has been many time quote in /r/askhistorians.  http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1sbs53/how_well_regarded_is_the_book_lies_my_teacher/  I was  just saying that the U.S is not untouch by that    As for states' rights, Loewen says that's not correct either: ""Confederate states did claim the right to secede, but no state claimed to be seceding for that right. In fact, Confederates opposed states' rights — that is, the right of Northern states not to support slavery,"" he writes.  This one's a bit hard to talk about because ""state rights"" is such a broad thing. However, I believe that in Georgia's succession document  they are talking about states rights.   Georgia is interesting it is clearly about slavery at the end  in spite of their most solemn obligations and covenants; because their avowed purpose is to subvert our society and subject us not only to the loss of our property but the destruction of ourselves, our wives, and our children, and the desolation of our homes, our altars, and our firesides. To avoid these evils we resume the powers which our fathers delegated to the Government of the United States, and henceforth will seek new safeguards for our liberty, equality, security, and tranquility  I dont know the cornerstone speech  from the vice president of the confedération was pretty clear that it was not about state rights  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Speech  In fact claiming state rights is material for /r/badhistory"
russia,3domm9,Dolcester,7,Sat Jul 18 13:03:00 2015 UTC,"If you would have read my comment you would notice that I never calmed that it was about states rights.  Rather, I was responding to Loewen's claim that    ""Confederate states did claim the right to secede, but no state claimed to be seceding for that right.""   I think the passage I provided disproves this statement. However, again, I must stress that I agree with Loewen's views. As I've said time and time again in this discussion, this is not about the view themselves.  The point I am making is that history is so fluid and ever changing, that text books really have no choice but to use blanket statements.    ""Lincoln and the Republicans had promised not to disturb slavery where it existed,"" many people in the South didn't trust them and feared they would ""not protect Southern rights and liberties,"" which lead to secession.   That's a pretty good quick summery of the start of the war. The South wanted to keep the salves (protect Southern rights and liberties) so they left the union. Today, we thinks it's crazy to argue that it wasn't about slavery. But a few years ago it might have been crazy to argue that it was. Add to this the fact that school don't really have time to go in depth on pretty much any topic, and the fact that most school kids aren't histories, you can't get bogged down on one subject.  I have never heard of Loewen or this book before now, so it could be well regarded, I don't know. However, the thread you lined doesn't really prove that it is. Just one dude, without flair, saying he liked it.  To close this, I'd like to refer you to that very same thread. As /u/earthb0undm1sfit said ""I believe it's an interesting & important book that allows the wider public to understand grasp the ""mutability"" of history."""

russia,3drjjs,istinspring,-1,Sun Jul 19 08:54:59 2015 UTC,"The Buk missile launched from Snezhnoe theory has one minor problem - it's not consistent with the laws of physics.   The Daily Beast, Bellingcat and others painstakingly traced the route of the launcher to Snezhnoe and back, including images of the launcher allegedly after the fact - minus one missile. However it had been shown, that the scattering of the impact elements contradicts that theory: For the missile to explode in front of the cockpit, it should have been launched from the south-south-west. The vicinity of Zarochenskoe was mentioned as a possible launch site, I'm not too sure why though, as the arc, defined by the range of possible angles relative to the plane that the missile could have taken at the moment of blast, covers a lot more ground.  That is to say, even if (and that's a big if since the images, allegedly taken in Torets and Snezhnoe aren't properly geolocated), there was a Buk launcher near Snezhnoe at July 17th 2014 at 16:20 PM, it couldn't have been the one to shoot down MH17.  Which one did, to whom it belonged and where exactly did it fire from are all excellent questions."
russia,3drjjs,AlexDub88,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:11:30 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how these weapons really work. They are not simply a heatseeking shoulder launched gimmick. As far as I understand they need at least 2 or 3 vehicles to make the shot. How the missile is guided andd how the fuse works and what the explosive charge actually does are all mysterious to me.  But one thing struck me as strange from the beginning. If this is a rocket with solid rocket fuel and it is 5 meters long and a few hundred kilograms heavy, shouldn't there be a huge smoke trail? The only thing pertaining to this was 1 questionable photo taken near Saur Mogila. How come there are so many locals from the crash site talking about having seen UAF fighter planes but not a single one talking about having seen the smoke trail of a rocket? I don't get it. I mean I know it sounds unlikely that a Su-25 shot MH17. But to me it also sounds unlikely, that nobody saw the smoke trail. And I refuse to believe the entire population of the area secretly conspired to lie about this without anyone disagreeing."

Если сделать выжимку из того, что идет в западных СМИ по катастрофе рейса MH17, то выходит примерно так:  Боинг был поражен ракетой 9М317 производства концерна ""Алмаз-Антей"", выпущенной из зенитно-ракетного комплекса ""Бук-М1-2"". На вооружении ВСУ стоят ЗРК ""Бук М1"" имеющии ракеты 9М38. Более того, украинские ""Буки"" не могут стрелять ракетами 9М317, ибо не модернизированы до уровня ""Бук-М1-2"". Самое же грустное для РФ в истории с расследованием катастрофы MH17 в том, что у следователей оказалась в руках сама ракета 9М317. Следователи изучили все типы ракет ВВС и ПВО Украины, включая и ракеты 9М38 которые представила Украина. Это позволило сравнить поражающие элементы зенитной ракеты, извлеченные из тел и корпуса лайнера. Химическая экспертиза определила состав металла поражающих элементов, обнаружила частицы материала обшивки и стекла самолета, которые пробивали эти элементы прежде чем поразить людей.   За то, что у расследующих историю с малазийским Боингом оказась российская ракета 9М317, которая может быть выпущена только из российского ЗРК ""Бук-М1-2""(разработка 1994-1997 гг., принят на вооружение в 1998 г.) отдельное спасибо надо сказать кому то из ""союзников"" или ""партнеров"" РФ(Беларусь, Казахстан, Азербайджан?). Или это постарался кто то внутри самой РФ?  Кроме того в западных СМИ пишут про то, смогли определить точное место запуска и что у экспертов имеются образцы почвы с частицами топлива с места пуска ракеты. Эту информацию они получили от местных жителей.   http://el-murid.livejournal.com/2447407.html?thread=241049135#t241049135"

The only sure thing, as of now, is that MH17 has had a catastrophic failure above Hrabove, Ukraine. Very much possibly due to external forces, such as a fucking rocket. We don't even know whether that was an A-A or an E-A rocket. We know shit all.  Now real Aircraft Incident Investigations usually take time and a great amount of discretion. Seeing as how a leaked, and very possibly wrong, detail, might as well ground a fleet of thousands of aircraft of a certain type due to real, working theory or imaginary fault being examined as part of the process, one rarely, if ever, hears about leaks while still into investigation.  Because imagine how it would look if, and I'm talking out of my ass, the B777's all had a major design flaw. That would ground A LOT of planes and would incur damages in the hundreds of millions, if not billions, once cleared. That's exactly why we won't hear ""preliminary results"" of any investigation unless the independent investigators (see NTSB for the USA) don't have a very much conclusive theory that they're willing to back up.  What exactly are we seeing with the MH17? The worst, intentionally worst, and very much unprecedented investigation. Continued in part two or wherever."

I haven't spent a lot of time in Western Russia (I've also lived in Irkutsk), so I can't really compare it.

You'll hear chanson in the occasional taxi, you can buy a shwarma on the street from a nice Uzbek guy, there a million sushi places to eat.  In terms of multiculturalism, there's a fair bit. There are a lot of Korean and Chinese immigrants/tourists, and they don't always get along with the native Russians. While I was there, they seemed to simply tolerate each other.  As for parties, there's nightclubs like in any other large city. But, there's also smaller gatherings of friends, if you can find a cool group to hang with, watch some KVN, order a pizza.

Maidan was american backed showing anti russian ideas before it all really began. If i ask people why they hate russia, they quote aggression, corruption, and elitism. all of these things the US has in spades.  Why would they be scared of russian growth? Why wouldnt westerners be pleased that russia is recovering from the madness that was the breaking up of the ссср? Also, when did the right to self determination mean nothing? People in the east want autonomy, when does that start to not matter?! This shit is nonsense, i dont understand. I cant understand. I dont want to sound like i dont like my own culture, but i love russia and it is unfair that i am alienated for promoting humanism.  Im already alienated for being foreign(dude americans are weird, many dont like europe in general), im not sure how i will ever make friends here anyway. So, from what i understand from your comment, are americans threatened by your progress? How? I thought we livrd in a globalized world, what is up with this unhealthy competition if that is what it is? I can.only speculate, i dont yet know enough about america to really understand what is happening between you peoples."

There are tons of MURKIA Americans, but there is a strong difference between people and governments. Sure, plenty of people hate Putin, and pretty ignorantly at that, but I can only think of a couple of instances where someone was truly russophobic, and that was because their parents were Romanian, Polish or Baltic.

russia,3dn7rv,islamabob2,2,Fri Jul 17 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, of course, I truly understand the difference between a government and its people, but many of the americans dont.

I want to make friends, And i have met a few people that are reasonablr and nice to be around, but like i said, i am alienated :/ ive only been here for a few years. I cant even make any friends at work, I am a physician that is young and i am not respected. It just hasnt been going well. girlfriend, the only person i really was close to, broke up with me[ i work too much and wont be social with her, like go out.  she says i cant conquer my misanthropy (which isnt really true, but it is what she thought was true) well enough to even go out with her, so she thought that meant i didnt care enough for her. Amongst a few other problems. ]Everyone is so damn forceful about how they want you to be, i dont think that i can even handle this god forsaken place. . .the only reason i am here is because being a physician in america is a far better job than being one in europe.   Edit: and sorry, i guess i dont really even have anyone to talk to, i hope that i'm not saying too much."

Attitudes can vary vastly from region to region. Unless you're in a very rural or insular region, I doubt you'll be getting heat for being a European. Being a young doctor though may be another story. Do you work at a hospital or clinic or opened your own? Also, what do you mean by 'forceful about how they want you to be'?   she says i cant conquer my misanthropy    Idk dude, I don't know you and there's probably a lot that I'm missing, but it sounds like, at the very least, moving away from home has given you some kind of culture shock. If nobody likes you at work and your GF calls you a misanthrope, it sounds like you need to change your attitude.   I know I'm basically saying that 'the problem is you', and you're definitely not wrong about how Americans view Russia and foreigners, but you can't expect your environment to change to accommodate you, you just have to adapt. I'm not trying to call you out, I'm just weary of people who call the entire US a god forsaken place. Unless of course you're just referring to where you are specifically, than it may very well be that.   Oh, of course, I truly understand the difference between a government and its people, but many of the americans dont. Since Putin has high approval ratings, they think the whole country is sadistic essentially.   I strongly discourage you from discussing global politics with the average American, unless you want to educate them (God help you). They typically have no clue wtf they're talking about, as most Americans don't care enough to actually research on their own and rely on how the news spins things, if they even follow those events on the news. This whole sub is partially dedicated to decrying western (US) attitudes towards Russia, the Ukrainian conflict and everything in between. I think they'd be even more shocked to discover how few Americans are even aware of whats going on, or actually care to begin with.   I doubt you've met a single American who has even heard of the Faroe Islands."
russia,3dn7rv,islamabob2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:26 2015 UTC,"I live in memphis, tennessee. . .jesus, this fucking place. It is probably culture shock, that makes a lot of sense. And yeah, nobody has heard of the faroe islands. . .  Im not sure if i want the people here to be different or if i need to be different, i know i cant force anyone to be different, or if that is even what i want. Id just like to be understood perhaps, but everyone here is so judgemental and unwilling to belay their judgements for long enough to maybe get to know me. I thought americans liked scandinavians, actually. . .  I came in knowing little about the US, i tried to keep my judgements to myself because i was certain what i'd heard couldnt be true, but it is turning out to be true maybe. I think you might be right, this split second judgement, everyone's opinion, no matter how insane, matters, fact is subjective attitude is insane, maybe i am just in culture shock. My accent is pretty neutral, maybe i should try to blend hahaha, unless they ask, i suppose. And what americans do knoe about the faroe islands, if they know about it at all, is that whale wars is in the faroese trying to disrupt our traditional whale hunting, the grind, and they think us barbarians for killing whales for food. Pilot whales, non endangered, their population needs to be slightly culled for their own benefit, and this is a 1000 year old tradition. so, of course if they have actually heard of the faroes, then i am an intollerable whale killing dick lol. I did the grind once, sure, my future son will also take part, but it just makes it worse if i try to explain it.   Have you ever been to the US? What about tennessee? This place is batshit crazy. . .memphis tennesee seems terrible, maybe i should move. . .but i already established my medical practice here. . .gah. . .  And also, it isnt like i try to just talk politics, but it does come up (9/10 times about russia because i always have a russian language novel with me) and i dont care to be untrue to myself and not actually give my real opinion if it is asked for. A certain amount of tact is probably necessary, but i guess i dont know what these people want to hear yet.   ive been to kiev many times, many of my true friends are in kiev, i also have two sisters that my parents adopted that moved back home to kiev, and i find that i fit in more easily. People dont mind that i am from a different culture, they are very welcoming when invited into a home and there is far less fake smiles and fake politeness like is rampant in Memphis. but. . .actually, how is being a physician over there i wonder. . .probably no better than at home or in denmark(2nd home).   And to answer another question, i do ER at some hospitals, and i am the medical director for 5 nursing home  facilities.   Perhaps i really so need to change my attitude. She calls me a misanthrope, but doesnt understand that i am actually just now very reserved now that i am here(not to mention that i come from a city, the capital tórshavn, and it has 22.000 people, and now i live in a city of 1,3 million. . )Ive had bad experiences trying to mingle with people and making friends, i guess i am just sick of trying. And it isnt like i am particularly disliked at work, but i am not liked. More. . .ignored. i must not be very approachable after doing this bullshit for a few years. Thanks man, i do need to change my attitude. If you think that everyonr is going to hate you, they probably will, right?   And i dont know about the US as a whole, but tennessee is a god forsaken place, for real o.o    Thanks a lot for talking, i do realize that my attitude needs to change. My ex was very kind, i had a bad attitude and she still thought there was something worthy about me. Unfortunate that i couldnt adapt for her, and for myself. Maybe i should call her."

I was born and raised in the states, and I've been living in ""the South"" for over 20 years. It can be quite the shit hole. I suggest that, if your situation doesn't get better, you move to another part of the country, preferably out of the South in general, for the sake of experience at least. Mind you, not ALL of the South is bad like some of my own countrymen love to think, it's just a matter of location. I've never been to Memphis, but it doesn't seem like the kind of place even I'd like to live in.  I live in South Florida which is comprised predominantly by non-Floridians. It's mostly people from NY, New England, South & Central America, the Caribbean, Asia and Europe. Trust me, you'd fit right in. Hell, there's even a Danish restaurant not far from my house, but it's expensive as hell.   I thought americans liked scandinavians, actually. . . I came in knowing little about the US   Americans generally like immigrants who don't come to this country en masse, but Americans usually like Europeans of all kind, especially those from Western/Northern Europe. I might be biased towards my region though. No comment on Tennessee. What Americans don't like are hypercritical foreigners who live here and relentlessly tear on our country. I'm not assuming that you do this, but it's something to keep in mind if you eventually decide to relocate, preferably 7 or so states north or west of where you are.   And i dont know about the US as a whole, but tennessee is a god forsaken place, for real o.o   I don't doubt this lmao. Many areas in the South are notorious for being terrible, you should have researched a bit harder, especially since you were planning on moving there :P.   if they know about it at all, is that whale wars is in the faroese trying to disrupt our traditional whale hunting, the grind, and they think us barbarians for killing whales for food.   This sounds like people are just digging up shit about where you're from. Fuck them, we have more skeletons in our closet than most nations.  I studied Russian and Mandarin Chinese at college and have been to St. Petersburg and Niznhy Novgorod. I love speaking Russian with people. I oftentimes practice at a Russian market a few miles from my home and take lessons from a Ukranian woman who lives in a retirement complex primarily inhabited by people from the former USSR.   Trust me, Memphis is not indicative of the US as a whole. The US is a huge country. At the very least, travel around to see how other states work. I doubt that you'll have a hard time getting by as a doctor."

Our movie villians? It's pretty common to still have the villian be Eastern European, with the assumption they're Russian.  The ""best foreign policy minds"" pay attention to Russia, you put your money on that. Russia was integral to the nuclear deal with Iran, and is still a big time player in Europe.  The US military has been deployed in the Middle East, because that's where the fighting is, Asia because of Chinese growth, and across Europe because the Russian boogeyman is constantly evoked,"
russia,3dn7rv,mousefire55,-4,Sat Jul 18 00:40:11 2015 UTC,"The US military has, until Russia's invasions of Ukraine, been drastically drawing down its military presence in Europe.  Until the Russian invasions of Ukraine, the US had no significant military infrastructure in Eastern Europe, as it agreed in 1997.  Rather, US military attention has been overwhelmingly focused on the Middle East and Asia.  US students study Spanish and French because they're the defaults, and they study Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese in college because those are they languages they think will help them get work.  The number who study Russian is much, much lower, because Russia, up until the Russian invasions of Ukraine, was not very interesting in popular perception.  Americans do not think about Russia enough to fear it or hate it.  The reason Reddit occasionally finds itself talking about Russia is because over the past 2 years, Russia has kept doing things which Reddit really doesn't like, like invading Ukraine, conducting Anschluss in Crimea, shooting down a civilian airliner, becoming legit dictatorial, and making life horrible for gay people.    And if you think that Russia is receiving a disproportionate share of Reddit's anger or is failing to be critical of Western countries, you are willfully ignorant."

And that the Ukrainian pilot who is ""hiding"" in Russia and said he saw a Ukrainian fighter jet come back with the missiles missing wasn't even on duty that day, according to the Ukrainian SBU. Also, they edited out key parts of the video that was released a few days ago, including the rebels scavenging through the belongings of the corpses like a bunch of dogs and admitting to having mistaken the plane for a military one. But it's more convenient to ignore all that.   It's been funny watching the Russian propaganda machine deal with this issue. My personal favorite is the report released by the BUK manufacturer. They claimed to have identified the exact BUK model and missile used, to some systems they had sold to the Ukrainians (shifting the blame away from Russia) but then in the same report, say that it could have also been an air-to-air missile (keeping the conspiracy theories that it was an American/Ukrainian jet that shot down MH17 alive). How were they able to identify the model with such accuracy and then say that it could have been a completely different system? Now Russian media is saying it as an Isareli air-to-air missile. Truly puzzling..."

While MH-17 was a tragedy it was not unprecedented, however the response to it has been unprecedented (calling it a terrorist attack/having an ICC war crimes trial/ UN tribunal). The fact that this is happening suggest a bias against Russia/Russian interests which would make it impossible for a fair trial."

Bush: ""I will never apologize for the United States — I don't care what the facts are... I'm not an apologize-for-America kind of guy.""). But what is going on here, is that the Russian government, with their veto, actively prohibits finding out who shot down the plane. If they succeed, there will be no apologies or compensations. So even if there is a bias, don't you think it's important to have this trial to find out who shot down the MH17?"

Payment to relatives of the victims was an act of goodwill, not an admission of guilt.   There IS investigation going on in Netherlands, and a parallel criminal investigation, too. TBH, I don't know what the tribunal is for. To determine the facts? Dutch are doing that already, they've collected all the evidence, reconstructed what remained of the airplane, is the tribunal supposed to duplicate their work?

Now it's up to a tribunal to interpret all the collected evidence etc. to see if and who should be punished.

russia,3dm6zn,Uzbek_X,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"That dude from your article didn't admit to anything. He said ""probably"", that's all.   In 2004 the airline brought a lawsuit for damages and the loss of the airplane against Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and lost. They appealed to two higher courts but the ruling was upheld. Eventually the court refused to pass the case to Supreme Court and that was the end of it. The courts relied on Ukrainian panel of experts who concluded that it couldn't have been a Ukrainian missile, so you ""probable"" was legally turned into ""impossible"".   So, legally Ukraine has not accepted responsibility and has not admitted guilt over shooting down that plane.    Now it's up to a tribunal to interpret all the collected evidence etc   Dutch investigators ARE going to interpret the evidence, the report isn't out yet, and so it's theoretically possible that it will be ruled out as a technical malfunction or even a pilot error. What would be the point of having a tribunal then?   Besides, you are forgetting criminal investigation that goes in parallel.   What's wrong with existing legal avenues?

russia,3dm6zn,trophymursky,0,Fri Jul 17 20:26:37 2015 UTC,"I see why an investigation is necessary, because we need to three things.   1) find out who shot it down (likely seperatists but potentially a false flag).   2) find out whether it was on purpose or accident (the later being more likely but a false flag or an intentional attack is possible)  3) if it was accidentally found out exactly how it happened so it can be prevented in the future.   Russia has always been in favor of an investigation. While in previous cases after the facts were found there were settlements there has NEVER BEEN A CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL for any of the incidents. If there is suddenly a criminal tribunal against the separatists then there should be a tribunal for the US army and for the Ukrainian army."

All on a Gold shoulder lapel surrounded by Red. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshal_of_the_Soviet_Union  Shouldn't be too hard to track the guy down...there were only 41 of them.  The white star has no red outline, so I think the pic is from 1953-1955. After that is seems the star was outlined in Red.   The guy in the pic looks to be about 30 years old, so assuming the pic was taken in 1955 he would have been born around 1925.

russia,3dlcjf,Paravin,8,Fri Jul 17 09:57:32 2015 UTC,"Are you purposefully being obtuse?  The video doesn't show any ""ransacking""!  You're grandstanding and jumping up and down on a biased article because you think people's emotions will get the best of their reasoning based on a graphic video!"
russia,3dlcjf,bmalek,-6,Fri Jul 17 10:06:00 2015 UTC,"I don't care about the actions they have taken with the bags! Period! They can either pick through them, ransack them, cut them open, shit in them, it doesn't matter!  Why does wording matter? For fucks sake, I was arguing how their deaths were pointless, but you're lecturing me on using words describing how they're going through the bag, even though I've stated several times I don't care why they did it and how they did it."
russia,3dlcjf,Paravin,6,Fri Jul 17 12:11:35 2015 UTC,Are you having an MPD crisis or something? You just said   Seeing them tear open the bag was heartbreaking
russia,3dlcjf,Mongolico,-5,Fri Jul 17 12:15:20 2015 UTC,"Should have added more context then, my bad. It was heartbreaking because of all the personal stuff in there, clothing and so on. Not because of the way how they handled it."
russia,3dlcjf,Paravin,-2,Fri Jul 17 13:25:25 2015 UTC,"Let's say it was a separatist operating a BUK which shot down this plane. His home has been getting shelled hard, Ukrainian soldiers and paramilitaries have been shooting at him constantly. Over the recent times quite a number of Ukrainian military aircraft have been attacking him. He is in a real war, where a split second can be the difference between life and death of him or his family. He has a BUK without a proper radar, he sees an aircraft flying towards him. How much is it his fault?"
russia,3dlcjf,WeAreBRICS,3,Fri Jul 17 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"It would still be completely his fault. BUK missiles are usually found concentrated within a large area of tanks. I doubt he was getting fired at much.   Also, I believe emotionally spinning the situation in a hypothetical way (""His home has been getting shelled hard"" or his ""family"") is morally wrong. We do not know what kind of situation the operator was in. We know that he posted celebratory comments on social media and that there is a 40-second window in which the BUK operator has to lock on and shoot at the plane.  If we instead attempt to follow the chain of command, we would have to look at who paid for his salary, supplied his weapons, radar equipment, the BUK, etc. That would be Russia. But then who could we blame in Russia? The FSB, who's thought to be responsible for sending Russian soldiers and volunteers to Ukraine? The GRU? This is why I think an international tribunal won't work. It will be very difficult finding enough evidence to incriminate individuals."
russia,3dlcjf,afan101,0,Fri Jul 17 13:54:08 2015 UTC,"So people should just shoot willy-nilly in a war, because their family is under threat? I'm pretty sure every civilized country in recent years has begun at least some kind of target verification before shooting. The one who pulled the trigger is just as guilty as the one who supplied the BUK."
russia,3dlcjf,Paravin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:48:00 2015 UTC,You are confusing a state (and we have had cases of various states downing civilian aircraft in the past too) with a group of barely organised rebels who are outnumbered and outgunned.

russia,3dlcjf,WeAreBRICS,0,Fri Jul 17 14:01:39 2015 UTC,"Much of the blame must be on Putin, who agreed to supply these people with weapons that can shoot down passenger planes.

russia,3dlcjf,DineLointHarpie,0,Fri Jul 17 14:07:14 2015 UTC,It's not an established fact that Russia provided a BUK. It would be strange to provide only a part of the system. We may know the truth one day.
russia,3dlcjf,WeAreBRICS,-3,Fri Jul 17 15:37:22 2015 UTC,"The pieces of utter human trash were the ones who ordered their army, the right wing death squads and their air force to attack their own people and who continued to route civilian air traffic through an active airwar zone because they were greedy and were perhaps hoping that something like this would happen. Yep. That's the current Ukrainian government for you!   If the plane was shot down the a rebel Buk, the operators were simply trying to defend their homeland from being bombed into submission - thought that they were shooting at a high-flying Ukr recon plane, like the two they shot down already that week. They had no way of knowing that the callous ukrs would route civilian jets through the same airspace. They might not ever forgive themselves, but I believe that God will be merciful towards them if they are good people otherwise."

God know, no Western humanitarian aid agency is helping them or cares about what happens to them because politically, they are on the wrong side. We never cut the Chechens off... even when they were ""independent"" between the two Wars, we continued to pay their pensions and public employee salaries.

We need the second. Background: The second one is a civilian too? Background: The fighter jet brought down this one, and our people brought down the fighter. Background: They decided to do it this way, to look like we have brought down the plane. Yes Kalyian. I understood you, but we’re already at the crash site. A passenger plane was brought down. They brought down the passenger plane and we brought down the fighter. Cmdr: The parachute jumpers are there. Background: But there are two planes, from my understanding. Background: And what’s the other one? A Sukoi? Cmdr: A Sukhoi. The Sukhoi brought down the plane and we brought down the Sukhoi. Is it far from here? Where did it fall? Looks like … Where’s the smoke coming from? Somewhere else is burning, the 49 village. I mean … the two pilots landed on parachutes. (Phone ringing) Cmdr: Yes, speak. I’m here, I’m in Grabovo. Right at the place. I’m not at the bird site, I’m in the field. I didn’t get there yet. Cmdr: Five parachutes jumped off this plane. Five people jumped off this plane on the bird site.

It really just fits the narrative that the separatists/rebels thought they were shooting down a transport plane and they shot down a jetliner.
russia,3dlcjf,aliasalpine,13,Fri Jul 17 10:05:42 2015 UTC,But there was never any news about a Jet being shot down there on that day was there? I heavily doubt that this could have been kept a secret. Especially considering that there's video footage of both the 2 planes that got shot down during the days before MH17.  As someone else in this thread or another has said they probably mistook falling debris for parachutes.
russia,3dlcjf,leo_ash,-7,Fri Jul 17 14:54:45 2015 UTC,"Well there is news, now. Also Russia has been saying they had recorded fighter jets close to MH17 on that day all along, but the West just wouldn't listen because it didn't serve their agenda. Now some of it is leaking to the western media."
russia,3dlcjf,sieltris,11,Fri Jul 17 09:46:20 2015 UTC,But what about the fact that absolutely no one ever mentioned something about a downed jet on that day for a year? How do you explain that?
russia,3dlcjf,leo_ash,-6,Fri Jul 17 10:06:53 2015 UTC,"I am not here to explain. I just read the article and noted the interesting lines. Second civilian onlookers on that day were saying something about a fighter jet or two, but the West didn't care to listen and almost nothing from their accounts made it into news. Now something starts showing up (finally)."
russia,3dlcjf,sieltris,9,Fri Jul 17 10:26:18 2015 UTC,And it's irrelevant to you that said jet that allegedly got shot down disappeared from the earth afterwards?

russia,3dlcjf,sieltris,3,Fri Jul 17 10:34:55 2015 UTC,Did anyone else publish something?  The fact that noone mentioned a downed jet EVER throughout this whole year is proof enough.  I begin to think you might be a troll.

Their working version was that the plane was brought down by Sukhoi, obviously Ukrainian.   How on Earth do people conclude that it was rebel's Buk? Isn't rebel's own admission (actually by fake Strelkov on VK) one of the main reasons for ""rebels did it""?  What this video shows is that at least this group of rebels and those who dispatched them never heard of any Buks shooting any planes and thought it was the work of Ukrainians. They could have been wrong, of course, and they were clearly wrong about rebels shooting Sukhoi (unless there was SU-25 shot down in the area on the same day, who remembers now?)  Reports like ""two pilots jumped out"" and ""we saw five parachutes"" in the fog of war is of ""odna babka skazala"" quality, but better check it out just in case. And still not a word about Buk.

If there was something to find,  why didn't the prosecution bring it up during the trial to prove their case? If they did, it didn't convince the judge Lopatin was dealing.   Lopatin's solar panel project was selected by several government agencies as a signature effort to diversity the Russian economy from its dependence on oil and gas exports. His work has been supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, as well as by Skolkovo, Russia's flagship science foundation and a pet project of former president and current prime minister Dmitry Medvedev.  Lopatin, a graduate of the Kuban State University, was the only Russian innovator at the Hello Tomorrow conference in France in June, where his solar panel project was listed in the world's top 100 innovative projects.  But Lopatin's scientific credentials and his apparently innocent explanation of what he needed the solvent for were not enough to prevent drugs officials from prosecuting him...  ...On Friday, amid intense media scrutiny, prosecutors appeared to backtrack and said they would withdraw their appeal of the suspended sentence, Interfax reported.   So in the time since his arrest, they picked him up as a scientific wunderkind, let him go to France representing Russia in June, but it took until today for the prosecution to drop their appeal?   I don't know if you think I'm trying to argue for some conspiracy wherein I believe the government officials are persecuting innocent people for drug crimes only because they are stupid or have hate and doo-doo in their hearts, but my only point is that all the recent news indicates a problem and that there should be some initiative to fix it."

They do similar things in the states to beef up drug busts numbers, by counting sprouts and seedlings as they would mature plants. This means a 12 plant bust can become a 100 plant bust. 5 tons of poppy seed could only contain .04-2 kilos of narcotics, but on paper they get to say 5 tons were seized.   In a case mentioned in this article, 42 metric tons of poppyseed were seized, but the FSKN only claimed  half a kilo of nacrotics in the contents."

The low percentage content of opium means nothing - there's only one way to produce opium without involving complicated pharmacy labs and synthesis, and it involves processing poppyseed.

They do similar things in the states to beef up drug busts numbers, by counting sprouts and seedlings as they would mature plants.    That only makes sense though.   42 metric tons of poppyseed were seized, but the FSKN only claimed half a kilo of nacrotics in the contents.   Yes, but that's misleading. The actual quote is   Experts from Russia’s Federal Drug Control Service (FSKN) said poppy plant stems mixed up with the seeds contained 295 grams of morphine and 209 grams of codeine   where it's clearly stated that the half a kilo was contained in poppy stems mixed in, not seeds.  Besides, they had 5 tons at the time of the arrest. They've moved much more throughout the years, so now they're getting hit with the book.

russia,3dn20e,CWAnik,0,Sat Jul 18 00:34:41 2015 UTC,"The Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine seem to suggest otherwise.   If there are Russian forces in Ukraine, there's not very many of them. And the act they're doing is to stop Ukraine from slaughtering people in the rebellious eastern provinces.  Putin was correct when he said he could take Ukraine in a couple of weeks if he wanted to. Obviously he does not want to.   So did the ones who invaded Crimea.   Crimea wasn't invaded. Let's honestly look at what happened: Crimea tried to become independent in the 1990s but Ukraine refused and instead made Crimea an autonomous republic with their own parliament.  When the US/west overthrew the elected government (the 2nd time in 10 years) of Ukraine last year, the Crimean parliament voted to secede. The Crimean parliament then voted to re-join Russia, and then a referendum was held in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans opted to re-join Russia.  What is to complain about in the Crimean scenario? That Putin played fast and loose by using Russian troops in Crimea -- troops which were allowed to be in Crimea under a treaty with Ukraine -- to ensure that there was not the same chaos and murder that we saw in Kiev or Odessa?  Crimea has been Russian for longer than Texas has been American. Crimeans opted to re-join a country with a much higher standard of living and a far better social safety net -- from a selfish perspective, the Crimean decision was easy.  Crimeans today enjoy 3 official languages -- Russian, Ukrainian and Tartar. Contrast that to Ukraine. In Ukraine roughly 1/2 of the country speaks Russian in their homes. Yet the only official language in Ukraine is Ukrainian. Why would Crimeans want to go back to being part of poor, bankrupt Ukraine which doesn't allow them the freedom to speak the languages they want to speak?  When looked at objectively, the Russian reunification with Crimea was much more democratic than the US overthrow of the Hawaiian government and our subsequent takeover of Hawaii.  Since Crimeans seem quite happy about their present situation, who the hell are we to complain about their status?"

My guess is that Russia is supplying weapons and support, volunteers, and perhaps some specialist troops, but it's far from what anyone can call an ""invasion"". And again, Putin makes a valid point when he says he could easily take over the country if he wanted to.   And if you honestly believe that story about how Crimea was taken over,   Yes, I followed the events pretty closely from multiple sources. Are you saying the Crimean parliament did not do those things? Are you saying the Crimean peoples are marching in the streets in opposition to reunification with Russia?  Or are Crimeans thankful because they're better off, more free, and they're not going to have to endure the austerity that the EU will now inflict on the Ukrainian people?   and if you honestly think that the US overthrew the Ukrainian government twice (especially in 2004. Dude, are you kidding me?),   As one of our diplomats bragged, we spent $5 billion in Ukraine since the 1990s. The US government does not spend that kind of money on nothing.  We have a long history of overthrowing governments all across the world -- we've done it many times since WWII. We are experts at funding dissidents and protesters, manipulating internal grievances in a country, and overthrowing governments with so-called ""colored revolutions."" Ukraine's 2 coups just examples of our skulduggery."

There was very little support in April for any sort of separatism.  Strelkov himself said that none of this would have started if he and his men had not arrived.  Not only that, but this conflict would have been long over if if Russian forces had not launched a massive counter-offensive in July.    And if you think $5 billion on civil society, agricultural, industrial, and nuclear dismantlement over 20 years is big money, you have no idea what you're talking about.  Similarly if you think the events that took place in the Maidan were some sort of American manipulation and machination.  Russia was not authorised to send special forces operatives to take over the Crimean parliament building, conduct a vote without a quorum or any sort of recording, and systematically take over all of the strategic points on the peninsula.  That is called Anschluss. And if you think Crimeans are more free now under Russia, than you must be missing all of the forced disappearances.  Moreover, why would Putin want to invade all of Ukraine when maintaining a cancerous abscess of war, terror, and human suffering permanently infecting will accomplish his objectives just fine?"

Alas, /r/Russia has a weird relationship with reason. And by that I mean /r/Russia wouldn't know reason if reason came up to it and slapped it across the face. So, here were are with Putinistas making fun of what by measure is a very reasonable suggestion."
russia,3dhu1v,Vysotsky2,6,Thu Jul 16 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"Well I personally I believe that bridges across large stretches of water should be designed by professional engineers and build by professional construction workers and all this should take place under supervision of expert project managers.  So I don't consider your suggestion, that Crimea would somehow be well served by any kind of bridge that was constructed by the random selection of redditors frequenting this subreddit, to be at all reasonable.

russia,3di55w,AlexDub88,-15,Thu Jul 16 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"Why would it be considered an act of war? After US/NATO bombings of sovereign states, nobody called it an act of war, it was an anti terrorist/anti evil leader operation.   Why should anyone care? Nobody gave a shit when the US/NATO bombed and keeps bombing countries, why the fuss with Russia shelling now?   If NATO/western countries want to call Russia an aggressor/invader/war monger, they should classify their own actions in the same manner first."
russia,3di55w,turdovski,11,Thu Jul 16 14:50:13 2015 UTC,"Fundamentally you are correct in saying there is little difference between A US/NATO operation and a Russian operation operating on foreign soil,  regardless of reason.  The difference is that when the US/NATO do these operations they are usually after potential resolutions(some of which were vetoed by Russia) and/or candid discussions with other major powers,  In some cases they had support from a governing body.  Russia took action independently and every step of the way denied everything.  Think of it this way, lets say your playing hockey and someone has the idea of implementing a new rule.  Guy A comes up to everyone and is like ""Hey I think we shouldn't call charging a penalty"" and everyone excepts the consequences and you play the game with the new rule.  Guy B decides he is just going to go around charging people before talking to everyone else because he thinks is a dumb penalty and shouldn't be enforced.  If everyone goes around playing a game under assumed rules and Guy B just starts charging and saying its legal, people will get upset.  Then people don't want to play with Guy B, because he is untrustworthy and not respectful of the rules.    So it doesn't matter if the end result of Guy A and Guy B are fundamentally the same, the path was very different."

The Pentagon has expedited the delivery of bombs, ammunition and guidance systems to assist the Saudi-led campaign Yemen Economic Corporation, one of Yemen’s largest food storage centres, was destroyed by three coalition missile strikes in Hodeidah last Tuesday, according to the Houthi-controlled defence ministry.  Washington is not only fully aware that food depots, water facilities, refugee camps and critical civilian infrastructure are being deliberately targeted and destroyed, but that the White House has given the green light to actions that will inevitably lead to famine and social collapse. http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/03/yemen-saudi-led-airstrikes-used-cluster-munitions Credible evidence indicates that the Saudi-led coalition used banned cluster munitions supplied by the United States in airstrikes against Houthi forces in Yemen, Human Rights Watch said today.

More over, the U.S. calls itself out on this shit. I'm not sure if you've been to America as of late, but people do not like all this drone shit, not one bit.

That we don't like what Russia does, doesn't mean that we like everything the US does.  But: The US didn't attack us - while Russia did. Russia broke treaties with us, fundamental for our European peace order and attacked a country because it wanted to befriend us and we wanted to befriend them. Russia violated borders in Europe and invaded, occupied and annexed a part of a sovereign European state. Something the US didn't ever do (worldwide) in the post-war period. This is not only a conflict we don't like because it is wrong, like for many conflicts the US started, this is also a blatant and direct attack on us, our values and our common international law system."

""While Russia has been busy developing the BRICS bank with other rising powers – a serious financial challenger to IMF and World Bank hegemony – the West has been busy fomenting chaos in both Syria and Ukraine."" :DDDDDDDDD Don't you thing that hundreds of shells containing 25kg of high explosive could be considered something that MIGHT cause just a little tintsy wintsy bit of chaos?

Poles and Lithuania were only 'allies'.  Even the use of word 'German' for Teutonic Order is completely inaccurate historically. EDIT: actually, it's even funny. The main commander for the whole battle was Polish king, Poland sent 51 banners (Lithuania sent 40, including three from Smolensk) and suddenly we have become just an ally, which is listed on the last position.

I've said it here dozens of times - Smolensk banners did not retreat (although it is not entirely sure whether it was a retreat or a tactical move), but the more important part of battle was when the Polish troops were able to counterattack. Smolensk gave three banners from 91 in the ally armies.  Anyway, it doesn't matter: the point is, even if they had the most important influence on the final victory, then stating this is as ""Russian victory, with allies Lithuanian, Czechs, and Poles"" is absolutely unjustified. It is ridiculous, it was a war where Grand Duchy of Moscow was not involved at all."
russia,3djx0w,AlexDub88,3,Fri Jul 17 16:51:27 2015 UTC,Even the use of word 'German' for Teutonic Order is completely inaccurate historically.   Not it's not. They were German. Nobody knows who the soldiers were who fought and died for them. But the same is true for the Polish and Lithuanian troops. At the time rulers waged wars that made it to the history books. But the people dying in these wars usually had little to do with the ethinicity of the rulers. Nationalism wasn't a thing back then. Your attempts to make it a thing retrospectively are nothing but lame.
russia,3djx0w,AlexDub88,-1,Thu Jul 16 22:18:05 2015 UTC,"The Teutonic Order didn't represent the Germany itself. Of course, it had German roots and some German knights did support them, but not all of them. And after 1515? the German Emperor stopped to support them in wars against Poland.  As you said, ""nationalism wasn't a thing back then"". There's no point of implying their nationality, except propaganda reasons. The communist government of Poland used this battle as a ""victory over German invader""."
russia,3djx0w,AlexDub88,3,Thu Jul 16 22:29:07 2015 UTC,The Teutonic Order didn't represent the Germany itself.   Correct. They went there over 2 centuries earlier to conquer land and evangelize heathens to the Christian cause. That happened with full support of the Empire. Them fighting for land against other Christians wasn't so popular anymore. But they were still the same order and still German. Eventually they were thrown under the bus and Prussia took over with less evangelistic motives.
russia,3djx0w,AlexDub88,-1,Thu Jul 16 22:50:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly, so that's why I don't want to call them that way. For over 700 years, the Polish-German border was the easiest to defend, because basically nothing was happening there - except Cedynia, I don't recall anything else. Presenting Teutonic Order as Germany had a special purpose in communist propaganda (they also celebrated the victory in Cedynia a lot), to create in the society the constant fear of the German invader. In Polish historiography, excluding these dark times of communism, there was never a serious and influential interpretation of wars with Teutonic Order as wars with Germany. Even the movie ""Knights of the Teutonic Order"" was ordered by the government, so they could ""remind"" the society about the German threat; this is also the reason why the changed some scenes (the movies is based on a book), so the propaganda effect will be even stronger."

russia,3djx0w,toni-storaro,3,Thu Jul 16 22:21:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, because it implies that they were the main force in the battle. It was 51 Polish banners and 40 from Lithuania, including three from Smoleńsk (I'm not sure how many were from parts of Lithuania, where you could find Orthodox people speaking Russian)."
russia,3djx0w,AThousandD,3,Thu Jul 16 22:34:27 2015 UTC,You do realize that that the Lithuania of the time was a predominantly Slavic state right?
russia,3djx0w,pavelsky,-4,Thu Jul 16 22:38:43 2015 UTC,"Grand Duchy of Lithuania was a Catholic (at least officially) Slavic state, with some influence of Orthodox and Protestant churches; although I'm not sure about the demographics. Moreover, after the Union of Brest some people living from Orthodox Christianity to Greek Catholic.  Anyway, the proper term would be Lithuanian-Ruthenian forces, not every ""Orthodox east Slav"" is actually a Russian. Then you can discuss about banners from Smoleńsk, which was not Ruthenia at all."
russia,3djx0w,pavelsky,5,Thu Jul 16 22:46:45 2015 UTC,"There isn't a term for ""Ruthenia"" in the Russian language. It's all referred to as Russia or Russian. I guess that's where the confusion is from?"
russia,3djx0w,WeAreBRICS,5,Thu Jul 16 22:51:50 2015 UTC,"As I said in another comment - I don't want to get into a discussion about Ruthenia and Russia, because I know that there are some people who feel really passionate about this issue and can't accept other POV. There's no point to discuss it here.  Even if it's only the matter of words, then celebrating this as genuinely Russian victory is at least weird, although I realize that for some people it would be justified, because they feel that modern Russia is the ancestor of all tribes and nations, who used to be part of Ruthenia.  That's one thing, and the other is: it was a war between the Order and Poland with Lithuania (or Lithuania with Poland, it doesn't really matter). The battle was commanded by Polish king Jagiello and the Grand Duke Vytautas, the key forces were Polish banners who withstood and were able to start counterattack (Lithuanian-Ruthenian cavalry retreaded after the second phase of battle, but it is not entirely sure - some historians suggest that it was a tactical move from the beginning).  Even if you say that it's justified to include this into the calendar of Russian military (and I don't see any reason to do it), then calling it the victory of Russian troops, who defeated Germans with a help of Lithuanians, Czechs and Polish allies... It could only be explained as a pure propaganda. I think that even the order of allies is not accidental ;) Again, the Polish forces were providing about 2/3 of allied army."
russia,3djx0w,anarquistos,2,Thu Jul 16 23:09:13 2015 UTC,"I'm really not knowledgeable enough on this so I can't comment about the proportions of the forces. The article states that out of the Polish 51 banners 7 were Russian/Ruthenian, 2 were mercenaries and the only the remaining 42 were exclusively Polish (whatever that means), out of the 40 Lithuanian banners, 36 are stated to be Russian/Ruthenian, thus bringing the Russian/Ruthenian banners to a total of 43, compared to the Polish 42.   These figures are cited to Jevegenij Andreevich Razin, History of the art of war, ISBN 5-89173-040-5."
russia,3djx0w,Batyrsik,2,Thu Jul 16 23:23:02 2015 UTC,"But you still miss the point: even you want to count Ruthenian forces, then banners coming from current Russian territory were only a small percent. Ruthenian banners from Polish army could only come from places like Lviv, Trembowla or Halicz - modern Ukraine. Using this to describe it as a ""Russian victory"" and including this into the calendar of Russian military victories is completely unjustified and unhistorical. It's only for the purpose of propaganda."
russia,3djx0w,Batyrsik,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"Uhhh, if you only count the banners coming from current Lithuanian territory you'll get barely fuck-all. I dunno if you could say the same thing about Polish forces but they would amount to a far smaller total, for sure.   Again, Russian historiography, which dates to the 19th century doesn't acknowledge that Ruthenia and Russia were in any way different entities. And in many aspects that was true - there were no discernible differences between people living in Smolensk and People from Minsk, Polotsk, Turov or Galich.   So you might be right in stating that the Grand Duchy of Moscow didn't participate in the battle, but (again, in Russian historiography) Russia =/= Muscovy, Russia == Rus', the lands of all east Slavs.  Whether this is still relevant today is debatable."

Mr. Yarosh said Right Sector helped move the weapons to the capital in late February. Today, he said of his supporters, “in part they handed in these weapons, in part they keep them.” At the group’s headquarters in the Dnipro Hotel here, where men in jeans and military fatigues guarded the hallways this week, some of them with black-and-red bandannas over their faces, a man with a submachine gun stood guard outside the office of Mr. Yarosh. http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/world/europe/ukraine-sets-deadline-for-militias-to-surrender-illegal-guns.html?_r=1   But..but..

At 6:40 he says notice how even though there is lots of gunfire going on, there are no dead or wounded - the police is not shooting at protesters, they are doing warning shots near the protesters to make them go back. At 7:50 he says notice how the police isn't shooting at the retreating Maidaners, but going further around to try to find the actual shooters. At 8:37 notice what the maidaners are armed with - rifles and shotguns. At 9:08 the Maidaners take position in a journalists suite and shoot out from it. At 9:40 one of the Maidaners says ""change positions"". Then later the spetsnaz, who was being shot from this room nearly kills one of the reporters of RT since they thought he was a gunman. at 10:56 armed Maidaner runs back, while cameraman says ""watch out, they're going to start shooting at him"". Meaning spetsnaz is only targeting the armed Maidaners. At 11:43 another Maidaner with a hunting rifle. At 12:20 Maidan coordinator says ""Send 400 people"" and spetsnaz retreats. As spetsnaz retreats, they suffer casualties from gunfire and grenades. At 15:00 commenter says that this is what probably happened in the evening, the opposition told the president that they armed Maidaners and unless the president wants more blood on his hands, to sign the agreement. At 16:00 a politician from Party of Regions says ""he will not work with the assholes in government now because they, the opposition is who armed the Maidaners. They must be sent to jail.

In retrospect, Yanukovich should have called the army and burned all the Maidan participants from the air. Burned them all to ashes, and then swept them off the streets into the gutter. Because they were nothing but dumb, foreign-supported traitors, trying to destroy the state, and to subvert the will of the democratic majority.  ""Holodomor"" was local resource mismanagement, combined with local authorities lying to the government about the state of the harvest. Oh and also, dumb fucking farmers burning their own crops in protest of communism, not realizing they would have nothing left to eat a few months later.

russia,3dhh23,yasenfire,9,Thu Jul 16 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"When I see an American movie with funny stupid guys having the weird accent and skin heads, I think often: who are they? How did they caught in America? Russia is in the other hemisphere. So, they, probably, specially went to the other country to rob and kill. It's maybe the most hateful thing for me: to break the laws of hospitality, spoil lives of those who give you a shelter. And what I must think about those people? They are not Russians. Scum of scum. They are, probably, even not Russians literally: Russians do not create diaspora or something like that, they spread and dissolve. The thing I can wait from a Russian migrant in America is setting up Stars and Stripes over the house and the lazy grumbling about Russia: ""And we in America do it absolutely differently and right way"".  Brighton is the place for Russian Jews, maybe worst of them, who did not found their own place in the homeland. I can imagine them as the gangsters from movies.  I do not speak about comics and all these villains, after all I do not watch this sort of content too much. The later I can remember was ""The dark knight rises"" by Nolan where Russians were presented in the person of some mad scientist who creates a nuclear bomb (of course!). Also I remember some animation about Spider-Man where he fought against some dyno-Russians from KGB stolen super gyroscopic techs to drive through New-York (or other city) in the gigantic wheel. Well, it is just difficult to write without laugh. What the offense again?  I can remember only two cases when it touched something. The first was sequels of Rambo, where the soviet army was shown at least unjust. But these movies fell to total darkness with patriotism, pig shit, ancient east monasteries, the glorification of Talibs. All was bad, not only these guys, those movies did not have to be created at all, to not spoil the beautiful first movie.  The second case is related with the series of video games Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, where it put me into the position where I must kill thousands of Russian paratroopers to move through. I was playing not for the script, after all, but to watch the modern graphics. Villains were from comics and comical, about mobs... I decided all the battles were just, I am simply an excellent warrior who can crush a couple of division in the honest fight. The worst episode is in the previous part World at War where you need to shoot some defenseless civil Germans trying to hide in the subway or watch Red Army fighters burning them alive.

It does bother me in the sense that it conforms to my belief that American media tries to create a bad image for Russians on purpose.

russia,3dhh23,chewbacca81,3,Thu Jul 16 15:06:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those potato beetles were a serious problem. I am not sure, but I think they also had actual propaganda/info posters about the beetles themselves.  Most of the propaganda I personally saw - and my dad collected decades worth of satire magazines full of stuff like that - mostly deals with NATO and their public statements about Russia.  So a lot of that propaganda is kind of like reaction to what the West says and does.  Soviet movies practiced realism; so for example,  they would portray Russian and Polish soldiers as the good guys and Nazis as the bad guys; but you wouldn't find things like Superman or James Bond."

We had series like ""Four tank-men and a dog"" about PPA soldiers with lot of pro-soviet propaganda and ""Stakes Larger Than Life"" about young Pole who is soviet double agent in Abwehr. Both still have cult status in Poland and are fun to watch.  Ander's Army and Polish Armed Forces in the West is a different story. They were attacked by propaganda even in communist Poland. Anders was depicted as imperial agent, careerist in tsarist army (before and during WW I), german agent etc. Polish soldiers who returned from west after war were often persecuted for treachery..."

And why wo9uld you be triggered by the fact that the Nazis and the Soviet Union made a deal to both invade and partition Poland? The Nazis invaded first and faced most of the resistance, and then the SU had a relatively easy time (although still losing up to 3000 men) invading, that's history, the Nazis and the SU aided each other and loosely worked together, so why do you have a problem with it? Oh and the number of soldiers who died on the Polish side was around 5000(ish, numbers vary between 3000 and 7000), hardly 'no resistance', also 270,000 soldiers fought against the Soviets."
russia,3dhh23,chewbacca81,2,Thu Jul 16 21:13:57 2015 UTC,"The USSR signed a non-Aggression pact with Nazi Germany, attempting to avoid or delay a war as long as possible. Why? Because anything would have been a better outcome than WW2.  The non-aggression pact included a ""line in the sand"" which passed through Poland, and several other countries. That land was valuable for Hitler, but it meant nothing beyond strategic troop position to Stalin. The USSR was a huge fucking country.  What you call ""invasion"", actually looked like this: Hitler has invaded his part of Poland. The Polish military fought back and was defeated in a string of very brutal battles.  By the time the Soviet military entered ""their"" part of Poland several weeks later, what was left of the Polish army was no longer resisting. They retreated and waited.  After Hitler violated his side of the non-aggression pact, the main phase of WW2 began, which was the conflict between Germany and USSR. All the other parts of WW2, including the Allied invasion of Normandy, and including the atomic bombings of Japan, were insignificant by comparison.  After WW2, Poland was reorganized into an independent country, with roughly the same land area as before, and reconstructed primarily with help from the USSR. I believe this should be sufficient proof to any non-retarded person that Stalin did not fucking want Poland."

In exchange for use of US military equipment and personell in the movie.  In my opinion this is disingenuous.

For plausible villains you need people or agencies from countries that oppose the hero - and both historically and presently various tropes fit that bill: the former colonial masters (English), the 'terrorists' (anyone Arabic) and the Cold War enemy (Russian).  Let's be honest now, if a villain was Paraguayan or Ugandan we wouldn't find that in any way realistic, nor would it come with a ton of handy connotations and cultural stereotypes to instantly help the character development within a 2 hour narrative.

As for movies with criminals, the Russian mafia is a very real thing and they aren't 'always' used, Chinese people playing triads, or Japanese playing Yakuza wouldn't be seen as propaganda, it would be realistic.    As for the actors, you take what you get, there are many Russian and Ukrainian-American actors in Hollywood but they are not always used for some roles and instead British actors are used to varying success (I thought Cate Blanchett sucked in Indiana Jones 4, she also turned down an accent coach.)"

You also seem to forget that Russian antagonists only really appear in a handful of action movies and a couple movies you could possibly call dramas, they are absent from all the other genres...the majority of American films are about other Americans, because that is what Americans enjoy.

For example, the early Muslim empires were at some points more advanced than Europe. China had periods where it's progress also surpassed the rest of the world.  Their decline was preceded by the same elements now observed in Russia - xenophobia, disrespect of intellectuals and scientists, despotic authoritarian rule, pointless warfare, fanatical propaganda - the closing of cultural and physical borders.  Russia is in a similar stage of decline - most of it's achievements are in the past.   If you look at trends like Nobel prizes in scientific fields, startup business metrics, quality of education, scientific publications, etc, they are all declining.   Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Mendeleev - that is Russia's history, not necessarily it's future.   The first step towards reversing these trends is to channel pride into a realistic self-evaluation.   You have to put a stop to the fanatical leader-worship.   Citizens who ""Trust"" their elected officials are setting a terrible precedent - providing an opportunity for abuse.

russia,3di5kt,IAmOfficial,-3,Thu Jul 16 15:37:36 2015 UTC,Obviously if they are target of a lawsuit it is because families and friend of the  victims including their lawyers think they also bare the blame and should pay.

Airstrike was directed at the separatist HQ as a retaliation for the atttack because UKR didn't want to strike the top of the living buildings in front of the stormed state border security building.

In the context of expansionism I think it's fair game. Whether it's toppling current governments and installing puppets half way around the world or swallowing up autonomous regions via a vote is just semantics. If Siberia had a majority and beyond doubt vote to join China and China accepted, it's fine by me. If my county of Kent decided to join France, no porblem. If England annexed Calais through a vote, great! If anything I would rather be opposed to being annexed by France but lose to a majority vote of my neighbours than have Cameron toppled, then be bombed into submission, but maybe that's just me.

Nordic countries staying neutral is great for the common security which can't be said for Baltic countries or Ukraine (with Crimea, but Black Sea was taken care off recently...) If you take ex-Warsaw Pact countries and make them part of the NATO, guess what, you just doubled the threat for Russia, measures will be taken, it's how the world works. Post collapse of Soviet Union there was a chance for re-balance of power and collective security, including Russia. That chance was missed and NATO decided to expand, why would Russia even feel safe? My country has been in so many wars and so many lives have been lost in last 100 years alone it's astounding, I am fucking sorry bud, but Russian security is an issue regardless what you hear.

russia,3deo3u,ineedmoresleep,3,Wed Jul 15 21:19:17 2015 UTC,"I finished three years of seminary, and I... have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.  Theotokos is actually far more frequently translated as ""Богородица"" (""Birthgiver of God,"" or ""God-Bearer"" in the sense of ""bearing"" a child - compare German Gottesgebärerin - with Most Holy (""Пресвятая"") frequently prefixed), but we also refer to her as the Virgin Mary (""Дѣва Марiя""), while Catholics will also call her the Blesséd Mother. We also refer to her as Mistress (""Владычица""), Directress (""Одигитрiя"" or ""Указательница""), Heavenly Queen (""Царица Небесная"") and, especially for the Greeks, Panagia (""Всесвятая"").  But these are just naming conventions. There is no point of disagreement whatsoever between the Catholics and the Orthodox regarding these terms. Nor do they disagree on either the Theotokos' perpetual virginity (before, in, and after giving birth), or in the fullness of her having given birth to God in the flesh (Christ = fully God and fully man). They also agree that she was sinless - full of grace (""благодатная"").  Where Catholics and Orthodox disagree is over the nature of sin, and how best to explain her sinlessness in terms that suit our respective theologies. For the Catholics, it was important to devise the Doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, specifically delineating the Theotokos' conception by her parents as exceptional and leaving her without the stain of Adam's sin. For us (Orthodox), since we do not believe in imputed sin, we simply say that she inherited the same fallen nature as the rest of us, but thanks to both God's grace and her own truly exceptional holiness, she chose never to sin or disobey God throughout her life. That is often why, in icons of Sts. Joachim & Anna (her parents), there is a bed depicted in the background; this is a more recent addition to iconography to stress the Orthodox position that the conception of the Theotokos, while miraculous in that her parents had been barren until old age, was nonetheless natural and not ""immaculate.""  So no, ""Virgin Mary"" vs. ""Theotokos"" says literally nothing about our differences with the Catholics, because we use the same terms interchangeably."
russia,3deo3u,walkerforsec,2,Thu Jul 16 01:55:43 2015 UTC,"And to add to the fun, the Latin church has pretty much adopted the Orthodox way of describing original sin. So the Doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is still hanging around as this odd holdover from the scholastic era, despite a more nuanced approach to original sin.   I suppose doubling-down on Papal Infallability will do that to you."
russia,3deo3u,EnterTheCabbage,0,Thu Jul 16 02:51:51 2015 UTC,"she is more prominently featured as Mother in Orthodoxy as opposed to Virgin in Catholicism.   if you had to use just one name for her, it would be Богородица, right? and for Catholics it would be Virgin Mary.    the distinction is not linguistic, not theological - it's cultural.  to a common Orthodox person, Богородица is a nurturing figure, a protector (and also of course all those other things), and to a common Catholic person Virgin Mary is someone to be honored (admired, and only then all those other things too).    Also, do they not teach some basic social anthropology or cultural studies in seminaries? Demographics of believers, etc.?"
russia,3deo3u,ineedmoresleep,2,Thu Jul 16 02:28:36 2015 UTC,"cultural differences, demographics   In my experience, that's more of a thing they teach in American seminaries. Or more accurately in American academies (grad level seminaries). Regular seminaries seem to focus more on dogma and on services. Academies seem to focus on theology behind dogma and what happens in a church, or more specifically in parishes, beyond just the basic services from the book. I never attended either kind of institution and see no point in doing so right now - since I'm in my mid 20's amd single, and have no intention of becoming a monk, so I'm not getting ordained anytime soon. But I have known many people who attended one or both of those kinds of institutions and am just giving the tl;dr versions of what they told me."
russia,3deo3u,deyv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"I've heard about these issues in a secular russian philosophy course, back in the 90s. it was featuring losev, florensky, andreev, and the lot.   they talked for example how Orthodoxy is in general more feminine with Mother of God / Mary being the christian embodiment of pagan Slavic cult of Mother Nature, and Catholicism more masculine"
russia,3deo3u,ineedmoresleep,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:09:59 2015 UTC,"Russian culture, in general is more ""feminine."" It's based largely on emotional and internalized conflict that it is on rational external conflict."
russia,3deo3u,deyv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:31:41 2015 UTC,"You would have a point if you didn't have the terminology mixed up and/or misattributed.  1) ""Богородица"" does not imply motherhood nearly as strongly as it implies giving birth to God. The emphasis is on her role in the Incarnation, not as a nurturing figure. The latter exists, but Orthodoxy stresses more than anything her being the vessel by which God came into the world and the blesséd contradictions of ""containing the uncontainable God"" and ""joining virginity and motherhood.""  2) You're wrong about Catholics. While it is commonplace to refer to the Theotokos as the ""Virgin Mary,"" for devoted Catholics the term most often used, as I mentioned above, is ""our Blesséd Mother."" If anything at all, it's the exact opposite of your theory.  While we didn't cover anthropology, we certainly covered the basics of comparative devotion. You need look no further than the modern-day Nativity scenes of Western Christianity to see that emphasis on nurturing human motherhood is more a facet of the West than of Orthodoxy. But again, this has no relation to our theological differences, which was your original assertion.  Edit: Just to be clear, I'm not'saying that Catholics and Orthodox don't have differing vocabularies or emphases. That would be insane. What I take issue with is your statement that somehow this difference, which is really on the more minor end, is somehow the crux (no pun intended) or, even more inaccurately, the origin of our theological disagreements."
russia,3deo3u,walkerforsec,0,Thu Jul 16 03:42:20 2015 UTC,"did I mention theological disagreements? I am talking about the cultural rift, as in ""predominant views and practices among the followers"". Berdyaev, for example, famously claimed that Christianity in Russia is not a religion of Christ, but a religion of Bogomateri (which has roots in the pagan worship of Mother Nature (mat' syra zemlya). Can the same be said about Catholicism? Nope, those guys are all about worshipping some sort of Father figure.  I am on a phone, so I can't exactly research this and give you the exact quote, but didn't someone like florensky or merezhkovsky even claim that there's a fourth, feminine/motherly/creative ""ipostas"" next to the father, son and Holy Spirit? Have the same claim ever been made by catholic philosophers?  Ok, so in the course on comparative devotion, did they talk about  Florensky, lossky, bedyaev, bulgakov, solovyov and the lot? Specifically, about the manifestation of orthodoxy in the culture (through literature, music, popular culture etc)?  I am asking about this because I am surprised by your surprise. It's common, accepted understanding that russian religiocity is a feminine/motherly religiocity, and that Russia is seen as Bogorodica herself?"
russia,3deo3u,ineedmoresleep,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:31:10 2015 UTC,"Your actual quote:   That's, like, the main point of disagreement between Catholics and Orthodox   ^ That's what you said, and it's hogwash.   claim that there's a fourth, feminine/motherly/creative ""ipostas"" next to the father, son and Holy Spirit? Have the same claim ever been made by catholic philosophers?   Of course no such claim has been made, because anyone who claims it is a heretic. The Theotokos, no matter how holy, is still created, unlike the uncreated Trinity. Interestingly, some Catholics have falsely elevated the Virgin Mary to the status of ""co-redemptrix,"" which is closer to what you are proposing about the Orthodox, but the Catholic Church does not endorse that, and neither do we.   Russia is seen as Bogorodica herself?   What??? Please quit while you're behind."
russia,3deo3u,walkerforsec,0,Thu Jul 16 15:38:34 2015 UTC,"Your actual quote    quote the entire statement, then.  I clearly talk about cultural rift, not   ""our theological differences, which was your original assertion"" - you made that up.     Of course no such claim has been made   are you sure?  «София не только любима, но и любит ответной любовью, и в этой взаимной любви она получает все, есть все. И как любовь Любви и любовь к Любви, София обладает личностью и ликом, она есть субъект, лицо, или, скажем богословским термином, ипостась, конечно, она, отличаясь от ипостасей Св. Троицы, есть особая, иного порядка, четвертая ипостась. Она не участвует в жизни внутрибожественной, не есть Бог, и потому не превращает триипостасность в четвероипостасность, троицу в четверицу Но она является началом новой, тварной многоипостасности» - Булгаков  «София есть Великий Корень целокупной твари» –  Флоренский   What???   Okay then. I didn't mind looking that up (so I actually thank you for being so rude - that made me want to re-read Berdyaev).   Русская религиозность – женственная религиозность – религиозность коллективной биологической теплоты, переживаемой, как теплота мистическая. В ней слабо развито личное религиозное начало; она боится выхода из коллективного тепла в холод и огонь личной религиозности. Такая религиозность отказывается от мужественного, активного духовного пути. Это не столько религия Христа, сколько религия Богородицы, религия матери-земли, женского божества, освещающего плотский быт. В. В. Розанов в своем роде гениальный выразитель этой русской религии родовой плоти, религии размножения и уюта. Мать-земля для русского народа есть Россия. Россия превращается в Богородицу.   http://www.litmir.co/br/?b=113941&p=3   Enjoy your reading :)"

If I understand correctly, the author argues that Kadyrov has been subdued and the siloviki are satisfied:   This is not an attack on Kadyrov with the aim of unseating him (as was the case with former Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov); it is an attempt—and likely a successful one—to reformat and modernize the authorities’ approach to Chechnya. The contract with Kadyrov is not being annulled; it is just being rewritten before its next extension.   (...)   Now Kadyrov will have to justify his unequivocal “no’s” with arguments weightier than reminders of his erstwhile exclusivity. Authorities may now get to question Geremeyev, but they’re not likely to question Kadyrov. At the same time, Kadyrov will probably have to give up his hopes of expanding his power, even in a hypothetical Checheno-Ingushetia—a hope he’s expressed in recent years."

russia,3dduw0,akarlin,-5,Wed Jul 15 21:19:23 2015 UTC,"Any reasonable society would vote Putin's party out. I don't care if he was the messiah himself and he was the best world leader ever. The risk is too high. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. You might get a less ""effective"" president, but he won't become a dictator. Even if you support him, his authoritarian tendencies is clearly a bit worrisome. Even if you believe he is doing fine now, what about when he is in his 70s. How do you know he want get paranoid, senile, and full of dementia. The result of that would be catastrophic. Vote out his party because the risk of power getting to his head is just too high. No one, not the pope himself, should be given more than 10 in power. The risks outweigh the benefits a million to one."
russia,3dduw0,Vysotsky2,4,Wed Jul 15 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"This is highly unlikely. Discussion in the Russian political sphere is dominated by who gets to be on television - and people loyal to Putin control that. There are no viable, visible alternatives. And everyone who tries either gets shut outside of the system and ignored, or bought out and brought into the system, or simply legally screwed - like Navalny. Putin isn't going anywhere until he decides to leave, and then power will be handed over to someone he chooses."
russia,3dduw0,Apostrophe,2,Wed Jul 15 19:19:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed- I would add that after Putin decides not to run, the person he endorses will become the next president- and the person that person endorses will be the president after that, and so on and so forth- until major political, legislative, and social changes happen."

russia,3dfq6g,totallynotfrost,6,Thu Jul 16 18:44:34 2015 UTC,May I repeat my call for an FAQ section?
russia,3dfq6g,mousefire55,15,Thu Jul 16 02:41:31 2015 UTC,"I've just come back from my own first trip to Russia and I've had the same assumptions, looking back now I realise it's a normal country with normal people, sure there are bad people, but bad people are everywhere. Just don't trust any strangers who come up to you, and watch our on those wide Russian roads. Also that global peace index is completely biased."
russia,3dfq6g,pavelzuk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:49:55 2015 UTC,It's not 'completely biased' - it just doesn't hold any value for a tourist taking a holiday and generally doing tourist things.
russia,3dfq6g,belkabelka,7,Fri Jul 17 08:17:32 2015 UTC,"I'm American and have thought of taking a trip to Russia. But its seems to be way to dangerous.   ""There's no such way as western anti-russian propaganda"". Mmmhm."
russia,3dfq6g,-MGP-,5,Thu Jul 16 06:00:36 2015 UTC,"I swear if this question gets asked one more time I'll personally punch them in the face meet these people in the airport, greet them, hand them their complimentary matryoshka and a glass of vodka along with some pirogi, and proceed to wreck their shit show them the sights and try to make them feel welcome."
russia,3dfq6g,GoodJobMate,4,Thu Jul 16 06:35:49 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure there are way more than 9 countries that are far more dangerous than Russia, including pretty much every country in Central and South America, multiple countries in the Middle East, Africa and South East Asia, and - right next door - Ukraine.  I'm American like you and people here are scared of their own shadows. Just don't do stupid shit. Everything in the news is exaggerated, and most of the stories you hear about are people that went looking for sex/drugs, frequently after drinking themselves stupid. Or they hit on someone else's girlfriend and just won't stop."
russia,3dfq6g,pancakees,9,Thu Jul 16 07:21:42 2015 UTC,It's both sad and hilarious what kind of image the western media has created about us. Westerners believe there are armed men running on the streets of Moscow shooting at everybody and anti-gay patrols storming into apartments looking for gay people to beat up.
russia,3dfq6g,Lucky13R,3,Wed Jul 15 23:41:27 2015 UTC,Westerens from Europe think the same of the USA. Mexico is a Warzone. Canada is spare England. Australia is second division England. etc
russia,3dfq6g,foxmulder2014,-5,Thu Jul 16 05:44:03 2015 UTC,Thats really not my vision of Russia. My America Californian view is that Russia is mostly geto. Corruption. Homosexual hate and high crime. Question is the Russian military invading Ukraine? Or Russian rebels
russia,3dfq6g,Lucky13R,5,Thu Jul 16 00:02:19 2015 UTC,"Just stay in California where it's 'safe' and don't ever visit, please."

russia,3dfq6g,foxmulder2014,0,Thu Jul 16 01:01:55 2015 UTC,"Local separatists supported by Russia. Although it's not really an invasion if they are defending their land, is it?"
russia,3dfq6g,Annagry,3,Thu Jul 16 00:28:11 2015 UTC,"Americans are the last people to have critic on the Rebels. The were the ORIGINAL REBELS. Did they not fight against the United Kingdown for Freedown?  Did they not annex/liberate/buy Texas, California, Louisiana, etc  Hell, New York was even called New Amsterdam until the bought it at gunpoint.  Same with Alaska. Sold hardly enough because, they didn't know what it was worth back then.  Borders get redrawn all the time. And this border just makes sense!   Are there any Americans that want California & Texas part of Mexico? Same thing Americans. If you love America, you should support the Rebels in Novarussia"
russia,3dfq6g,-MGP-,-2,Thu Jul 16 05:47:48 2015 UTC,"No nobody has that vision outside a few tinfoil hat crazies that follow crazy websites like Alex Jones, which is widely mocked and ridiculed, 99.9% of people are rational, tolerant and form there own views.  If that is actually your beliefs of what westerners think the question you really should be asking yourself is, are you gaining your knowledge from reliable media?"
russia,3dfq6g,E1M1MID,3,Thu Jul 16 03:39:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's gaining this knowledge from this exact post, eh?"
russia,3dfq6g,foxmulder2014,7,Thu Jul 16 06:03:20 2015 UTC,"I assume you are going to a  tourist-centric city like Peter or Moscow? You will be fine. Visiting those is no different than visiting Paris or London. In fact I would not even really call going to them ""Taking a trip to Russia"" as you are really not seeing the real Russia at all."
russia,3dfq6g,WeAreBRICS,3,Wed Jul 15 23:44:15 2015 UTC,"True. Same as Paris or London is not really visiting France or Engeland.  I've been to Paris a couple times, but I discoverd to REAL France going to Auxerre.  It's been called to most French French town. Man, it's awesome. Like visiting a museum the size of small city. Small bistros everyone. The best wine ever. The pure French atmosphere. Auxerre is AWESOME"
russia,3dfq6g,MeetKi,2,Thu Jul 16 05:42:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, because seeing hrushevkas in Muhosransk is more Russian than seeing historical sights in Peter."
russia,3dfq6g,Basas,3,Thu Jul 16 05:27:13 2015 UTC,"Not much more dangerous than the US  Russia 13,120 murders United States 14,827 murders"
russia,3dfq6g,WeAreBRICS,7,Wed Jul 15 22:54:24 2015 UTC,Flat count doesn't say anything in this case. US has 4.7 per 100k while Russia 9.2 per 100k. And even US murder rate is pretty much the highest among western countries.
russia,3dfq6g,Basas,3,Wed Jul 15 23:27:14 2015 UTC,"To really compare we'd have to look at how many murders occur between people who don't know each other. As we all know, most murders occur at home between people who know each other."

russia,3dfq6g,Uskoton,0,Thu Jul 16 08:22:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, but get a guide.  Russia is huge. Make the USA and Europe combined look tiny. Moscow & St. Petersburg are fine. Modern cities. St. Petersburg the most. It's very ""western"" Moscow as well. Krasnador is fine to if you like to beach/sunny vacation.  Other parts... Expect corrupt cops. As soon as they notice you speak English they're going to charge A LOT more to the regular fine and pocket it themselves. The reason is these guys get paid shit.  This is outside the major cities. Get a Russian guide. Let hem do the driving.  Or if your first visit stick to St. Petersburg, Moscow or Krasnador."
russia,3dfq6g,rizzzeh,-1,Thu Jul 16 05:39:41 2015 UTC,I do believe that if Moscow were in the EU it would be the safest city by statistics. And considering the size that's impressive!  People ask if Russia is safe yet will gladly wonder the streets of London for instance. One of the rubbish bins of Europe with plenty of disgusting crime ridden areas you just don't go to.

russia,3ddc9h,turdovski,-3,Wed Jul 15 20:05:48 2015 UTC,And there were dozens of separatist/russian shelling in the past few weeks.  Even an attempt to take some new villages.  msm isn't reporting on every small detail in Ukraine.

russia,3ddc9h,Vysotsky2,2,Thu Jul 16 02:08:10 2015 UTC,"Ukraine has no news crews on the ground in DNR. Everything is stitched together and force fed by UA using YouTube, lifenews, etc, Shariy constantly shows full length vids where locals blame UA army then same vid is shown stitched on UA TV to tell a different narrative.  Once in a while we get a local claiming DNR rebels are at fault, and I don't doubt that, there are lose canons on both sides. However, majority of evidence (including OSCE) points to ""genicide"" like in nature of conducting warfare from UA side."
russia,3ddc9h,ukrus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:45:19 2015 UTC,Wrong. OSCE says they are about equal violations.
russia,3ddc9h,Vysotsky2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"Dude, that article you cite was before Minsk 2 was signed. I don't know what's your agenda but it's up to the fucken cunts in Kiev to stop the war, agree on a referendum with international observers (OSCE, US, UN whoever) and settle the conflict. Why they don't do that and continue the bloodshed although there is no way in living hell for them to win? It's simple. Cause they pretty well know that they will lose East Ukraine even with all those refugees that left the country or the region. As they lost Crimea. No one here, me included, supports the war in East Ukraine. We all however support the right of self-determination of the people of East Ukraine. You, on the other side, want these people to have no say about their fate and their affiliations i.e. you support terror and dictate over the people of East Ukraine and what is worse you have the nerve, audacity and the arrogance to do it here, in this forum. You are rather pathetic, you know, and same goes for /u/Vysotsky2."
russia,3ddc9h,hastasiempre,0,Thu Jul 16 10:10:21 2015 UTC,"Lol, referendum. You mean hostile military  takeover, that's how they lost Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. However, the whole world still recognizes those areas as sovereign Ukrainian territory."
russia,3ddc9h,CodswallopLoad,0,Thu Jul 16 11:13:40 2015 UTC,"How about the previous two referendums in Crimea which had exactly the same outcome...without a hostile military takeover? You are quite a tool, buddy. The joke is on you, I guess. Also a hostile military takeover without a single shot fired and a single casualty is kind of an oxymoron, don't you think?"
russia,3ddc9h,hastasiempre,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:26:25 2015 UTC,"Moldavia was also ceded to Soviet Union without a single shot fired, so that sad not a military takeover? If France decides to take Monaco I doubt a single shot will be fired. The referendum wad illegitimate to the majority of the world. There was not even an option to vote for the statutus quo."
russia,3ddc9h,Vysotsky2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:10:57 2015 UTC,"Crimea is a done deal, we are not discussing this at all. Crimea as I've posted a thousand times was not a legitimate part of Ukraine in the first place, I don't give a shit what the rest of the world thinks, I care what the people of Crimea think and they have decided 3 times in a row to join Russia, so cut the sophistry. That story is a dead fag. Otherwise we should go back to Kosovo. We are talking the civil war and the bloodshed in East Ukraine. As I said stopping the war and the bloodshed is in the hands of Kiev as long as they decide to grant the region a self-determination i.e. referendum. Why they don't do that? Cause no one wants them there and they will lose big time. Plain and simple."
