cutegirlgifs,3doisj,EverythingVoluntary,7,Sat Jul 18 11:00:59 2015 UTC,The most recent reminder that I've hit middle age: my first thought upon watching this GIF was how good her swing is.
cutegirlgifs,3doisj,Ilikehowitistrending,4,Sat Jul 18 00:59:32 2015 UTC,Interesting how open her front foot is. Almost like what you'd expect to see for a flop or something. The ball is very far forward in her stance too.   I really want to know the trajectory of that ball. Because that doesn't look like the subdued shot I'd expect out of that stance.
cutegirlgifs,3doisj,Gibson19,4,Sat Jul 18 04:14:13 2015 UTC,Eh well if you can't tell which number face she's using then you can't really say how far forward it should be. If that was a 3 face for example and accounting for the angle of the camera that's not too bad. The front foot is questionable though
cutegirlgifs,3doisj,ScrotaryConstriction,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:23:02 2015 UTC,"You are right. When I saw the ball position, I thought for sure she had no idea what she was doing. But she's got a very athletic move and hit the ball with authority even when she was goofing around. My guess is she's an excellent all-around athlete."
cutegirlgifs,3doisj,Ilikehowitistrending,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:30:03 2015 UTC,Might have twisted her ankle if she was wearing spikes.

Seriously, if you're checking out a girl and she catches you, don't look away real quick. Instead, meet her gaze and give her a friendly smile. Unless you're a total creeper or something, I've found that like 90% of the time, she'll smile back and, for some odd reason, touch her hair. That's when you go say hello. I've gotten several dates out of this technique. Note that checking her out and straight staring at her are two different things, and also, it won't work if you're just staring at her chest or ass."

It just so happens that imgur converts all GIFs to WEBMs (stored as .gifv files) that can be accessed by appending 'v' to the end of the normal .gif URL.

cutegirlgifs,33a61h,ctrlshftn,2,Tue Apr 21 05:31:44 2015 UTC,Correct. The next version (probably in a few days) will just post the imgur gifv version and a friendly reminder about adding the 'v' to the end if it is already hosted on imgur instead of re-hosting it completely.

I'm assuming she got that hand movement and lip/tongue thing from an old movie and is trying it out; and I'm wondering who the original is.  Maisie is a nice kid and cute in her own way but the sultry look is not for her.  She doesn't do it well.  And she's a kid.  I know: like all teens she'd hate to hear that.
cutegirlgifs,2ojki6,DeadYeti,1 point,Mon Dec 8 06:30:05 2014 UTC,like all teens she'd hate to hear that.   Maybe it's because it sounds like you set yourself above them.
cutegirlgifs,2ojki6,TheDutchTank,-1,Mon Dec 8 16:50:26 2014 UTC,"Nope.  I used to be one, why would I down what I used to be?  But I do recognize (remember) that most kids/teens have a yearning to be viewed as adults.  And that they often hate being reminded that they aren't.    Which is not saying that adults are better than kids.  Different though, yes.  I'd like to think you don't require explanation/proof of that.   Now you, OTOH, have actually just demonstrated yourself to be a very judgmental person, and one who jumps to conclusions at that.  Which makes your accusation pretty ironic.  Not in a ten-thousand-spoons kind of way either."

cutegirlgifs,2kjzzg,autowikibot,5,Tue Oct 28 21:38:11 2014 UTC,"Carom billiards:       Carom billiards, sometimes called carambole billiards or simply carambole (and in some cases used as a synonym for the game of straight rail from which many carom games derive), is the overarching title of a family of billiards games generally played on cloth-covered, 1.5-by-3.0-metre (5 by 10 ft) pocketless tables, which often feature heated slate beds. In its simplest form, the object of the game is to score points or ""counts"" by caroming one's own cue ball off both the opponent's cue ball and the object ball(s) on a single shot. The invention as well as the exact date of origin of carom billiards is somewhat obscure but is thought to be traceable to 18th-century France.

cutegirlgifs,2gg6xq,spinblackcircles,1 point,Mon Sep 15 23:45:57 2014 UTC,Yeah I knew that but she's a red head a lot of the time so my comment stands. Kind of like how Natalie dormer is one of the hottest brunettes and Emilia Clarke is one of the hottest blondes. Natural hair color doesn't really matter if they spend a good portion of their lives -- on the show and away -- as a different  color. And I have no idea if your first comment was just a mistake or if that actually looks blonde to you haha
cutegirlgifs,2gg6xq,tedbohannon,1 point,Tue Sep 16 05:56:50 2014 UTC,"It looks blond in my monitor. And I agree, some people look more ""themselves"" with an altered hair color.

cutegirlgifs,2cchc2,sbjf,1 point,Fri Aug 1 20:18:20 2014 UTC,Are you just going to repost the whole sub then?
cutegirlgifs,2cchc2,kj01a,2,Fri Aug 1 23:02:58 2014 UTC,"For a little while, yes, because it's a new sub and cross posting is the best way to let people know it exists without just spamming ""hey come check out my sub"". By cross-posting it benefits both subs, it adds content to subs like this one and at the same time lets people know about /r/BeautifulFemales, so we both get something out of it.  I figured that was the least intrusive way of raising awareness of the sub.  Once we hit 1000 subscribers, which will most likely be sometime this weekend, I'll start to taper off the number of cross-posts."
cutegirlgifs,2cchc2,kj01a,1 point,Fri Aug 1 23:15:46 2014 UTC,Is the only thing that differentiates you from /r/PrettyGirls the fact that you allow minors? It seems like a redundant sub.
cutegirlgifs,2cchc2,kj01a,0,Fri Aug 1 23:21:44 2014 UTC,Our rules aren't as strict. /r/PrettyGirls doesn't allow any amount of cleavage.  Even a hint of cleavage will often get a photo deleted over there.

If I could bang her like maybe two or three times, with cuddling inbetween each bang and she would do all of her cute expressions and faces... If I got to do that I could probably die and not care at all. Unless there was a possibility of keeping on banging her instead of dying. Then I would rather live.   I honestly think that if I banged this girl that would be the peak of my existance.  I'm actually not even horny right now, nor imagining what it would be like to bang her. She's to cute for that.... It cannot be imagined properly. Instead I wonder how many times I would be willing to hit the ""kill a random stranger button"" to bang her. Probably like 4 or 5 at least. I think if I killed off to many strangers to bang her it would become too bitter sweet of a bang and that might ruin it.   I would also easily give all the money I have saved up over the last 2 years to get to bang her.  Thats about 12 thousand dollars. Easy decision. So Kurashina, If you read this and need money.

Then there are others who force certain habits (like the quirkiness) in order to be more appealing. It is as if they have to put on a persona they see as sexy, or hot, or cute, or whatever you want to call it in order to get attention. This just doesn't work for me and it's the vibe I've always gotten from Nigri.   Hope that makes sense."

cutegirlgifs,23wkos,ChromeLynx,2,Fri Apr 25 12:24:24 2014 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of giyf :      phrase / abbreviation  Google is Your Friend     ""GIYF"" is often given as curt response to a question that perhaps should not have been asked, or was poorly researched.  This phrase carries several insinuations, firsty that the poster did not bother to try to  find his/her own solution to a problem, but instead 'dumped it' to the forum/chat group to solve.  It is a shortened, dismissive, response to a question deemed inappropriate. Similar to RTFM, it conveys the intonation that ""If you didn't bother to  spend 15 seconds searching for the answer on your own, I'm not going to waste a complete sentence responding to you""  As with RTFM, it carries a cruder double-entendre along the lines of ""Get It Yourself F**ker""  Example:  Q: How do I set my e-mail password in WidgetWorks 2008 v3.1?

cutegirlgifs,1koe7j,Imma_Knight,2,Mon Aug 19 17:22:56 2013 UTC,Why is the background distorted behind her? It moves when she does.
cutegirlgifs,1koe7j,doomeded47,2,Mon Aug 19 18:12:04 2013 UTC,"It's distorted because the rest of the background was made static. The camera was probably moving and someone has edited the gif (or video it's from) in order to hold still all but the woman and a small area around her, which is why only the background directly around her is moving."
