synthesizers,3e3857,sixdust,2,Tue Jul 21 20:32:32 2015 UTC,Getting my first ms20 this week. I've been thinking about getting the Volca beats with it. Do they play nice together? Will I need another sequencer for notes? If so will midi from maschine to ms20 as master clock work? Sorry for all the questions. Your rack is dope brotha!
synthesizers,3e3857,m00rc0ck,2,Tue Jul 21 20:29:44 2015 UTC,"If you wanted to use your MS20 with a Volca Beats I'd recommend getting a Korg SQ-1 sequencer. You would run the synch out of the Volca Beats into the synch in of the SQ-1, and run the CV&Trig out of the SQ-1 to the CV&Trig in of the MS20. This would let you have 16 step sequences in time with the Volca Beats.  Korg MS-20 doesn't respond to master clock, as the LFO's don't synch so all you would rally get from Maschine midi would be note data."
synthesizers,3e3857,Nutritionisawesome,2,Tue Jul 21 21:09:02 2015 UTC,Awesome. That's what I was thinking but sq1 looks cool enough and cheap enough to add. Can it automate filter level? I swore I heard that somewhere
synthesizers,3e3857,shittybuddhist,2,Tue Jul 21 21:46:24 2015 UTC,"It has two sets of CV, so you can have the first 8 steps control note data and have the second 8 steps control any cv parameter that is available on the patch panel of the MS-20. Since it's stepped it wouldn't be ideal for smooth filter sweeps, but it is definitely good for some interesting effects."

I like to have it right next to me when I am working so I can field ideas on it without having to roll my chair over to one of the other stations.  I like to keep the most hands-on synthesizers close by.    I actually have the back of the AK propped up a bit using the monitor stand and some foam so it's slightly angled.  I agree with you about the issues seeing the screen at an angle.  I am actually really excited to use Overbridge for this reason.

I'm wildly fond of it and the quarter-inch output lets me plug it through my pedalboard, giving me sounds closer to a real synth instead of the often cheesy (but lovable!) sounds it has on it. Part of why I made the /r/ was to see how people use theirs and how far they can make such a simple and cheap tool go.  Also, this is obvious, but /r/CircuitBending seems to be the place to be for Circuit Bending info. I've never done any of that, but it is such a cool idea and you can get some crazy sounds out of stuff."

Here is a good video series for those things (you'll need much much more as well): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HXEI_Lk3Qo  Tools: You'll need some basic tools/skills; Multimeter, Soldering iron, etc.  (~$100 worth) How to solder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Sb21qbpEQ  Practice soldering on small projects (Bonus if you have an understanding from your learning): http://www.makershed.com/collections/electronics  http://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Sidekick-Breadboard-Resistors-Mega2560/dp/B00DGNZ9G8 (there are better ones than this, but this gives you an example of what you're looking for)  Understanding Circuits:You're own your own here, as you're going to need to first learn the basics. I will however provide you with a few interesting synth-related resources/DIY projects. I'm sure there are some videos you can find online about electronics design/circuit design.

You can though have a track making a kick sound and have it make a hihat sound on the same track by changing the settings when the kick isn't firing. Hard to explain though.   This will work great if you want the A4/AK to be the ""brain"" of your little setup. It was my first synth and I think that having so many possibilities with LFO, envelopes, blahblahblah in my first one was a really good thing. I feel like it gave me a really quick crash course in programming above the analogue synth bare essentials. You can do some really sophisticated stuff on it. It's very feature rich, but it's not that confusing because it's laid out really well. The downsides:   $$$ Underpowered in term of MIDI, only really sends out clock and program changes. Not a problem in the MB/A4 setup, but it isn't as future proof as having something that has full MIDI capabilities.   Watch this if you've got 30 min to burn. If you have any questions, ask away.

I don't know much about Nords - as they've always been priced out of reach for me. However, they are digital, but good quality from all reports and demos I've seen. Sorry can't be much more help on this side.  However, if you want a poly with a sequencer you could look at the Roland JD-XA which has a 4-voice analog plus a 64-voice digital (with Roland's Supernatural - another type of analog modelling engine).

So you might then need to shop around and see what else sells for $900 as a 4-voice analog. Perhaps the DSI Tetra ;)   Speaking of DSI, they did the Poly Evolver similarly to the JD-XA - but sadly no longer produce. Possibly you could look at getting one of those used?"

synthesizers,3e0tzy,usedtohaveajuno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:24:52 2015 UTC,"A) first off, check that the MIDI devices on your software are set up correctly in the preferences or options menus. Both MIDI in and MIDI out should be using the same device, and transmitting and receiving in the same MIDI channel as the Prophecy is set to.  B) If all of that is correct, test the cable with another keyboard that you know works via MIDI. If this didn't work, it's your MIDI adapter that is at fault.   C) If that does work, try connecting the other keyboard to the Prophecy's MIDI in, set them to the same MIDI channel, and try playing the Prophecy over MIDI through the other keyboard. Than reverse the cables and try doing it the other way. I'd this doesn't work, it's the Prophecy's MIDI ports. If it does work, then I have no idea what's going on!   It could also be that you're expecting something to happen without running any software, in which case you'll be waiting a very long time! MIDI predates plug and play by a couple of decades, so yeah, you most definitely need to be using MIDIOX or something similar to transmit and receive data."

For something to count as a voice, it needs the atleast a full set of VCO(s), VCF, VCA.  Paraphonic is when there's only a single voice, but the VCOs can be sent separate pitch voltages. Still only one VCF and VCA.  These words have no central organs of standardization controlling the usage of the words, naturally, but this is generally what it is understood as."
synthesizers,3dyd9a,slujj-vohaul,2,Tue Jul 21 01:44:26 2015 UTC,"Need to correct Korg then; they're advertising the Odyssey as duophonic. In common parlance, most people think of duophonic as synths like the Odyssey and Sub37; anything with more than one complete voice is polyphonic. Indeed, even Soundonsound's synth secrets goes into great detail on duophony, and guess which synth they use to demonstrate it? The Odyssey.   Edit: specifically, duophonic differs from paraphonic in that if you play a note on a paraphonic synth, in para mode, only one oscillator will sound, if you play two, two oscillators sound; in duophonic synths, if you play one note, both oscillators sound, if you play two notes, they split and one plays the second note. If you take your finger off the second note,  that oscillator returns to the first note again. There are always 2 notes sounding."

This is probably the easiest fix out there, so if you can't handle this, you should just give up on owning a vintage synth altogether. You need a soldering gun and some solder. Be absolutely sure everything is unplugged or you might die. Strip the white cable about 1/8"" of an inch, then apply solder to the exposed wire. Then you just need to melt the solder that's on the plug itself and force the wire through the little hole on the plug side (which is probably filled with solder right now). Hold it there for a couple seconds until the solder dries. If you're feeling slightly more adventurous you could replace the plug with a grounded one, it's much easier to find 3 prong power cables. And since you have it open it might be a good time to replace the battery. Don't touch the battery if you have patches you want to save, however."

synthesizers,3dxwcm,thrifstor,11,Mon Jul 20 13:01:41 2015 UTC,"I think that having 3 separate tracks that you can switch on and off makes the Bass better for techno and acid and stuff like that, but having the option to store 4 bars of music and play chords makes the Keys better for more traditional song writing.   Also, the keys is noisier, probably because of the digital delay circuit. Just something to keep in mind."
synthesizers,3dxwcm,TheUglyHobo,7,Mon Jul 20 13:19:17 2015 UTC,"From my experience, the bass is far, far easier to sequence. My favorite thing is to set up three sequences on top of each other such that when you switch from unison to two sequences to three it has a nice build-up. I love the bass because it's really easy to sequence and make good sounding melodies on. In particular, slide edit and the ability to input notes step by step through step edit mode make it useful. I also like the ability to precisely tune the pitch of each oscillator.  That said, the keys is a far better sounding instrument. It's more difficult to sequence, particularly with four bars, because you can only enter the note data by playing it in realtime, and if you're slightly off in your timing your rather screwed unless you quantize your playing which spoils the fun of it a little. But, the keys has delay, ring mod, and a lot of options that make it a much deeper instrument. Poly mode especially is useful (if you have another midi controller, it's a pain in the ass to make chords properly on that tiny little keyboard unless you input the notes one by one.) I've honestly used the Keys a lot outside of Volca-style sequencing because it has such a great sound to it, and it's very easy to throw together a nice analog patch and throw it in the mix of a track just noodling on it and screwing around with filter sweeps or solos and whatnot. Its versatile nature makes it a far more, well, versatile machine than the Bass, and if it had the same sequencer I would unhesitatingly say Keys > Bass.  But, I can sequence entire tracks with the bass on its own, and yes, once you have three melody lines it's a bit thin sounding, but I especially love the sound of the oscillators in the high pitch range as the bass makes a very good piccolo synth for whatever that's worth.  I own both because I bought them second hand, and if you're really sequencing Volca style, having both makes jamming out with yourself a lot more fun. Really, pick yours out depending on what you're more into."
synthesizers,3dxwcm,Slotosky,6,Mon Jul 20 13:46:32 2015 UTC,"The bass sounds enormous, fat and growly.

These sounds are just bread and butter synth string and synth lead sounds using a sawtooth wave that most subtractive synths can easily replicate.  For the DX7 FM style synthesis for the bell sound, use Dexed  For the strings and lead sounds with subtractive synthesis, use Synth1, U-No 62, or SQ8L.  The big boy versions of these would be FM8 for FM, and the slew of subtractive synths like Massive, Serum, U-No LX, Sylenth, Sound Spire, Synthmaster, Z3ta, Dune, ANA, Omnisphere, etc.  There are probably 100 different ones that could all do the job."

The Juno D is a ROMpler, which means it's full of piano, electric piano, organs, strings, lots of sounds based on samples that sound kind of like real instruments. There are a good number of synth samples on board too, but it will never sound quite like a proper analogue style electronic synth.

But analog, man, analog... if you've got the bug, you know what to choose."
synthesizers,3dx9mp,stylofone,2,Mon Jul 20 10:19:39 2015 UTC,"Pros and cons; the Tetra sounds amazing, hard, powerful pads, screaming leads with all kinds of fun modulation possibilities, really powerful bass sounds, BUT; only 4 voice polyphonic which makes playing chords difficult as the next note usually cuts off the release tails of the last hanging notes; horrible interface for programming - it's almost essential that you get hold of an external controller for programming the basics or you'll be there all day.   Virus: powerful sound, complex synth engine, and a very distinctive sound that you will either love or hate. Some people love Viruses to bits and swear by them, others describe the sound as sterile and plastic - this isn't because it's digital, so much as just the way the filter tends to sound, I think. Good polyphony, but again, horrible interface.   If you want polyphony, get the Virus; if you want power, get the Tetra.   Bonus points for the Tetra; the polyphony and programming niggles can be negated by buying a Mopho Keyboard or Mopho X4 at a later date and polychaining them together - you can then program the Tetra from the Mopho's much more engaging control surface, and the Mopho X4 adds another 4 voices, making the combo a real Prophet 08 killer."

synthesizers,3dx9mp,Pulsewavemodulator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:20:43 2015 UTC,"If you still plan on using VSTs, I would choose a Mopho Keys over the Tetra. The Mopho keys has a much better interface, not totally knob per function but much closer than the tetra. Use the VSTS for poly sounds and a the Mopho for analog goodness. Also, I have seen the Mopho X4 go for under $900 on ebay.  I think the Mopho/Tetra (same engine if you didn't know already) are great sounding synth and it offers a lot of deep control that helps create expressive and interesting patches."
synthesizers,3dx9mp,kirklandish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:51:12 2015 UTC,"DSI Tetra is pretty cool. I'd be looking in that direction - or any analog gear. If you're comparing at price-point you might miss out on looking at the Prophet 12.  If analog is the answer - why not consider the Roland JD-XA - 4voice analog + 64 voice digital (Supernatural) + FX and cross-layering digital into analog signal path/filter etc. This would be like a Tetra + Virus in one board.  Another option is the Elektron Analog Four (A4) - (the keys version is a bit pricier) - I've just got one of these, and WOW it is incredible.  There are so many options - not just the two you list."

Peg_leg may not have worded it in pleasing way, but he is right. The VA/PC line gets blurrier. If OP is limited with hardware and wants some, go VA, with analog endpoints, filter, effect, whatever."

synthesizers,3dx2xa,kopkaas2000,2,Mon Jul 20 12:14:41 2015 UTC,"You don't need new pickups.  I see you already have the nameplate rail off, so you're not scared to open the lid and see what's going on in there.  Every pickup is individually mounted, and how close the pickup pole is to the tip of the vibrating tine (moving the pickup towards or away from you, from player's POV) is the loudness adjustment.  This is the screw just behind the pickup coil.  Peruse the service manual, especially the ""volume adjustment"" section, and then get a long screwdriver and just do it.  I went through my stage 73 a while after I bought it, and just iterated over the whole thing, adjusting each pickup until every key was the same loudness as the one on either side of it, and it made it much more playable.  As the icing on that cake, do the ""timbre adjustment"" once you've done the volume adjustment:  using the two screws that hold each tonebar to the harp, adjust the up/down position of the tine tip relative to the pickup's pole piece to control the balance between the fundamental tone and overtones of each note.  This is the Rhodes ""bark"" you hear people talking about.  What the ""right"" timbre is is an individual choice, just adjust it to how you prefer it.  Personally, I have mine set up so the bass end is a little barkier and the higher end is a little cleaner, which is nice for clear chords up high, and adding a little fat to basslines."

The AK is awesome in it's versatility, the sequencer is second to none, and the new overbridge software eliminates a lot of the menu diving if you don't mind using a DAW to make patches, and also allows for multitracking over USB.  The AK has a dedicated CV track that is great for controlling/sequencing analog gear, but a dedicated MIDI input module on your modular will fill the same functionality, so that is something to consider.  The nice thing is you can output non-pitch/gate voltages as well (LFOs).  The AK isn't all sunshine and rainbows however; it's 4 voice, which is slightly less than ideal.  The oscillators are a little indistinct; what I mean by this is, the analog waveshaping that is taking place to turn whatever the core wave is (i'm guessing a triangle) into a saw/square, never gets THAT close to the wave it is approximating.  The saw is a little rounded, as is the square - and you can hear it.  That being said - it sounds good, and with a little chorus, can sound fat as all get out.  The filter is good but not insane.  The lower resonance multi-mode filter (2nd in the chain) is actually somewhat better to my ears, esp since it can be flipped from 24 to 12db/oct.  I hope this helps some.

synthesizers,3duq8q,SEA-Sysadmin,6,Sun Jul 19 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters you shouldn't be getting that much significant lag between sending MIDI and recording audio; if I can achieve lag-free recording in the same way on a Pentium 4 single core processor running Windows XP and recording 5x 48khz audio tracks from MIDI tracks, then I'm pretty sure you can too! You might want to check into your ASIO configuration and devices; that's usually the culprit where any sort of lag is coming in. Try reducing your buffer sizes a bit (not so far that the whole system glitches or locks up) to see if you can shave milliseconds off the delay.  In terms of routing the gear, I went with a 2 in 8 out MIDI thru box. i can switch between two input sources (my MPC and my computer) and send out over 8 MIDI channels. The maximum chaining of MIDI in my setup is 2 deep. I don't like to go any deeper than that both to reduce the risk of lag and also, more practically, so I don't have to switch everything in my setup on just to play the instrument on the end of the chain!"
synthesizers,3duq8q,t0xicd0g,2,Sun Jul 19 19:09:38 2015 UTC,"What DAW?    My audio latency is 128smp(3ms).  That's pretty damned snappy.  But not snappy enough to send midi out, and record audio in, and have that be listenable with a drum machine.  I am suspecting it's FLStudio, but not quite sure how to validate that.  The reason I point to midi as the source of lag is that I can play bass along with my recordings with no noticeable lag.  Only occurs when the full loop of ->midi to device->audio to recording, which combines the latency of midi and audio."
synthesizers,3duq8q,kisielk,4,Sun Jul 19 19:23:15 2015 UTC,Most DAWs will have a latency compensation setting for MIDI that you can tweak so that it sends the messages earlier than it would normally.
synthesizers,3duq8q,t0xicd0g,3,Mon Jul 20 05:26:11 2015 UTC,"I'm still running Cubase SX2, and Cubase LE 6 on my laptop (which I use very rarely and tend to use just VSTs on it). Right, if your audio latency is 3ms, that is very fast and should definitely be giving you pretty much bang on synchronisation. You certainly shouldn't hear anything amiss if the system was working as it should with those settings. Does sound like there's some lag with MIDI. What MIDI and audio interface are you running through, and which ASIO driver?"
synthesizers,3duq8q,artfart,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:17:36 2015 UTC,"One way around this is to record in your audio, and trim it back a few ms to where it is on beat with everything else."
synthesizers,3duq8q,lxzander,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:14:06 2015 UTC,it would help to know the actual signal path from midi to Audio. and maybe even post a picture of an audio recording next to the source midi so we can see the delay?  but generally speaking every time you pass midi-thru data it will get delayed slightly (specially when going 4-5 devices deep). and depending on what hardware it is that delay might be bigger or smaller than other hardware

Although it's a fairly simple design, it's widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best sounding filter out there, and has been emulated and copied with varying degrees of success by other synth manufacturers including Arp, Studio Electronics, and on the virtual front, Clavia (Nord) and native instruments.  That being said, unless you have a modular cv envelope, the filter won't work like filter section of your synth.

synthesizers,3dt2oz,Biopharmer,11,Sun Jul 19 04:39:32 2015 UTC,"I think you're slightly mistaken about what West Coast synthesis means. It doesn't just mean ""quirky drum sounds"". Vince Clarke made a lot of his own drum sounds yes, but using East Coast synthesis methods most of the time, eg, the usual VCO to Filter to VCA path with some modulation and white noise thrown in. Also that sounds like an 808 coming in at 1:27. Grant Richter, the guy who owns Wiard explains it well here: https://muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=408&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight= If you want to create drum sounds via West Coast methods then the cheapest option (and when I say cheap, I really mean the least expensive, but still expensive) would be Eurorack: Make Noise Maths, Verbos Electronics modules, Lowpass gate modules (Make Noise do a good one, the QMMG), Malekko modules, wave shaping modules. Stay away from regular filters, that's East Coast blasphemy. Search for West Coast on Muffmuffwiggler's for more information. I've four panels of Serge Modular I use but for the music I make I find drum machines perfectly fine for the main kicks and snares, the other weird sounds I can layer on top."
synthesizers,3dt2oz,splitradix,4,Sun Jul 19 07:36:22 2015 UTC,"I like that explanation from Richter. He said kinda what I thought (and was hoping) WC synthesis was all about. It seems to be about finding unfound sounds and exploring strange textures on a multi-dimensional level. Discovery more than intentional creation.  I'm still completely a foreigner to this brand of synthesizer. It's easy to not even know it exists. Maybe I've just gotten tired of subtractive synthesis over the years but this is all wonderful and fresh to me (even though this type of synthesis is really old).  I still feel that there's a beautiful marriage to be had by combining the two schools of synthesis.  And yes, kicks and snares are fine to be covered in the typical way. I'm interested in the crazy metallic and evolving types of percussion to couple with them.  The thing that I'm starting to realize is that WC synthesis is more expensive because it requires more modules. You can fill a eurorack with several subtractive voices easily (you could even just get an Intellijel Atlantis for instance). But there seems to be no full capable single module for WC synthesis."
synthesizers,3dt2oz,nikofeyn,2,Sun Jul 19 07:55:27 2015 UTC,"The thing that I'm starting to realize is that WC synthesis is more expensive because it requires more modules   i honestly don't understand what you think west coast synthesis is. for example, the make noise dpo, maths, and optomix gives you a complete west coast voice and synthesizer.  west coast synthesis is more based upon additive and fm synthesis with low pass gates being a staple. the idea is that the modules aren't strictly configured for a single task. i.e., you can typically do more with less."
synthesizers,3dt2oz,kisielk,10,Sun Jul 19 19:21:30 2015 UTC,"A very under-appreciated drum module is the Nore Drum 2. It has a huge range of sound generators, including FM, ring mod, some physical modelling. It's quickly become my favourite percussion box. I like the DSI Tempest as well, but despite the flexibility I still find the voice architecture to be a bit bland. It can't really generate metallic timbres except by using the limited digital oscillator samples.   For,something way out there, there's the Metasonix D2000. Expensive, bu you're guaranteed to have a sound nobody else is likely to have."

I've come to love it due to the sound manipulation it's capable of combined with its ability to still sequence it in more accessible ways. For instance, I like putting an LFO on the sample slot for one voice making the sound change every trigger. It's one of the most capable machines I think that can also be very 808/909 sounding if you want. If you're able to try one out, sit down with it for like an hour and go nuts.

synthesizers,3dt2oz,xmnstr,7,Sun Jul 19 15:27:27 2015 UTC,"This song is a good example of what I'm talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fncjgN88xUE  Erasure's whole ""I Say, I Say, I Say"" album is all quirky drum sounds like this. They specifically avoided using any dedicated drum modules for the drums, only full synthesizers.  What I find interesting is that Vince Clarke used mostly typical subtractive synthesizers to get his sound (East Coast). I would think that listening to ""I Say, I Say, I Say"" that some of those stranger West Coast stuff would have been up his alley.  I think there's also a gap in synthesis. I feel like oscillators are too simple. A perfect synth would be a marriage between East and West coast. A really complex and rich oscillator (or two) coupled with a really nice multimode filter. In this way most synthesizers are very limited, giving you basic waveforms and maybe some really basic cross-modulation and maybe a ring mod thrown in, but I've been looking at buchlas and stuff lately and it's crazy how interesting of a sound they arrive at without even introducing a filter yet. Buchlas are not even realistically priced though.  I don't know. These are just the things I've been pondering lately."
synthesizers,3dt2oz,technotomato,3,Sun Jul 19 04:51:11 2015 UTC,"marriage between East and West coast   I've though about this before, creating a hybrid east/west synth module. It would be easy to set something like this up with a modular, but also expensive.   I imagine a semi-modular desktop unit with two oscillators with FM and ringmod, each with there own waveshapers, that lead to a multimode filter. I would like to set it up so you can determine how much of each oscillator's output goes into the filter."
synthesizers,3dt2oz,xmnstr,2,Sun Jul 19 12:20:24 2015 UTC,"That would be really cool. Semi Modular's the right way to do it too. A nice well thought-out solid state semi-modular that marries east and west coast. Two complex oscillators and maybe two filters as well (for series or parallel), then have 2 16 step sequencers that can run at audio rates if desired. Add a spring reverb and you'd have something pretty neat. Give it a colorful Buchla style (but with 1/8"" jacks instead of banana jacks)."
synthesizers,3dt2oz,kirklandish,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:03:27 2015 UTC,I would like to have a very comprehensive mixing and filter routing; as in being able to mix the pre and post filter output of the 1. raw oscs 2. ring-modded oscs 3. FM'd oscs and 4. waveshaped oscs. That way you could really fine tune the coloration of the final output.  If using two filters determine how much of each goes to which filter. Perhaps a multimode filter and a low pass filter that could be switched to a low pass gate. I would also like two noise sources with some sort of seperate tonal control (band-pass filter) for creating percussion.
synthesizers,3dt2oz,mierscheid,2,Sun Jul 19 16:50:30 2015 UTC,"They specifically avoided using any dedicated drum modules for the drums, only full synthesizers.   this was my thought as I was reading through the OP. What you really want is a sampler with a solid rhythm sequencer, then use your synths to make all kinds of wacky percussion sounds to load it up with.  The problem with making really deep, dedicated drum machines is that there's not much market for them. The idea of a drum machine (something that sequences percussion sounds) and deep sound design are kind of at odds with one another. Obviously not mutually exclusive, as stuff like the A4 and Tempest show, but all the same, I think most folks looking for drum machines want something fairly simplified, not something they're gonna have to spend a week just learning how to use."

I would try syncing the internal sequencer to Ableton or creating some nice Sampler presets from it before trying to automate it from within Live. It's just not meant for that kind of usage, and I feel like you'll be missing out on what makes the 101 what it is by trying to force it into that role.  If I were trying to do what you were doing, I would start with an SH-101 clone plugin or perhaps the Roland System 1 rather than spending a bunch of money just to get limited MIDI connectivity into an original SH-101.

With only 4 knobs and a matrix, along with several parameters hidden in menu pages, you really need to know what you want to do with a Blofeld.

To me this is one of the premier performance synths. Knobby, featured enough but no menu diving, and it's a freakin' light synth for its size.  I've got a Virus TI but I find I use the Sledge more.  Edit: By the way, the hardware is the same between any revision of the Sledge, the 2.0 refers to the OS and it's upgrade-able for free.

As for stereo on one slider, it can do that.  It has a button to use the faders for the 16 inputs, then switch over to using the faders for some stereo ins, fx sends and returns and mixes, and it has a custom layer where you can assign whatever you want to the 16 faders.

However, with your 'ooh, are you a virgin' attitude (which is something I'd expect from my 12 year old) I guess it would never occur to you that it is possible to actually THINK about these things, and to think about how our own attitudes can be contradictory or confused.

I can circumvent some of these using the Octatrack sequencer / lfos via MIDI, but that's a bit of a chore. Also, you have to constantly check back for the algorithm page as well as the Index modulation page (both accessible with a quick shortcut) to know what goes where - modulation index 2 (IM2) is between what carriers and what  operators - or use this page as a reference.

synthesizers,3dpmle,duckcall,3,Sat Jul 18 05:48:24 2015 UTC,"I think you're looking at the idea of hardware all wrong. Nothing in software sounds like the Z1; it is, even after 15 years, unique in what it offers and the sounds it offers. Most synths don't have the sort of sequencers on board that you seem to want. The ones that do aren't really that great as synths, they're more workstations and the synth aspect of them tends to be usually a pretty boring ROMpler. Most sequencers on decent synths are usually just simplistic pattern sequencers. If you want to sequence it, use a DAW or get a dedicated sequencer like an MPC1000. And multitimbrality is only of use of you want to play multiple parts in a live setting; for recording, just record multiple passes. It's better for mixing and producing have separate stems anyway.   Also, now you have a decent keyboard, your playing will expand to use it, I guarantee. You'll mess about on it, practice on it, and before long you'll wonder how you ever managed without so many keys.   But I warn you, the Z1 is deep and if you don't have a really good grasp of synthesis, you might feel a bit lost and frustrated. It's not a simple synth to program if you don't really know what you're looking at. It's one of my favourites of all time and if I had to keep just two synths from my studio, it would be this and my Tetra."
synthesizers,3dpmle,t0xicd0g,2,Sat Jul 18 07:02:11 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're trying to sell this kid on the Z1, maybe just because you own one? It might be a great synth but based on his description it sounds like a bad fit for his situation.  He's short on space in a dorm room, doesn't care for a lot of keys, and is more interested in hardware with a multitimbral sequencer.   OP, get yourself an Electribe. It's a self contained box of fun, has a great sequencer you can use with other gear in the future, has a great VA engine with loads of filters, and you can make full songs on it. Plus you can tuck it away somewhere out of sight when you're not using it. You won't be able to any of that with a Z1.  Edit: Plus the Tribe will double as a nice little controller for software and VSTs. Another bonus. Just a way better option for someone in a dorm IMO."
synthesizers,3dpmle,slujj-vohaul,2,Sat Jul 18 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I was even handed; I did also try to warm him that it's a bugger to program if you don't know a huge amount about synthesis; the Z1 is an awesome piece of gear but it really isn't for everyone. However for him the main value of this over the Electribe is on having a really good master keyboard. Good keybed, lots of controllers, XY pad, aftertouch. Having a decent sized keyboard encourages more playing and more playing makes you better at playing, which also makes you better at writing."
synthesizers,3dpmle,t0xicd0g,0,Sat Jul 18 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, all solid points. I think the defining factor here is space constraints though. Dorms are really, really tiny. Getting something small and multitimbral that sequences will allow OP to put together full tracks - something like an Electribe is great for a kid in a dorm room. I'd go with that first and then expand with a nice master keyboard once OP is out of a dorm if he even wants one down the line. Keys aren't for everyone after all."
synthesizers,3dpmle,slujj-vohaul,2,Sat Jul 18 20:18:14 2015 UTC,"I guess. I'd probably say the Roland JD-Xi suits his needs even better than an electribe, though."

I suppose $350 for a psu, couple of stomp switches, a passive mult, and the pre-amps and attenuator is a decent deal.  I can see portability be appealing to a certain extent but I can't really believe that this is going to sell well for gigging guitarists. I think the fragility and general fiddly-ness of modules to be too much of an expense, both financially and ergonomically, to have at their feet and it's appeal is more in the visual and conceptual wow factor, rather than practicality.

synthesizers,3douac,spanky520,2,Sat Jul 18 01:05:33 2015 UTC,"My experience with the SQ-1, Volcas, Microbrute, Slim Phatty and Ableton is that it will throw it a bit off the initial tempo, either way, if synced to Ableton's master clock or if its being used as the master clock. I was quite frustrated with this at first but with practice comes improvement, and I'm now able to keep count and time the switch in my head to minimize the audible effect. Its still there though. I think in reality The SQ-1 is re-syncing to the master Ableton clock at the next SQ-1 whole step then beginning the pattern again. One problem this poses is if your tempo is synced from Ableton > SQ-1 > other gear, the other gear which receives its tempo from the SQ-1 will be thrown off as well. You've inspired me to dig a bit deep into this since I now know someone out there has a damn near identical set up as I do. I'll be sure to deliver if I figure out a work around / fix. If anyone knows how to avoid this please call me out here I'd love the help as well."
synthesizers,3douac,SullyEmerson,2,Sat Jul 18 02:08:07 2015 UTC,"ok so after a hour or so of jamming, I was honestly able to keep everything in sync pretty well. I was using the Volca Beats as the main clock source along with the Volca Bass (sequenced via midi) and Microbrute (sequenced via CV) When switching it did reset the pattern, but after practicing with the switch itself and a quick move double tapping the play/pause button right on beat one if it got off too far, I had very few problems keeping everything together and didn't notice any drifting or anything. I'm assuming if the clock is from Ableton, it should be the same, but I'll do a test."

If you want something with knobs and a better interface than softsynths you'll he disappointed in all of your choices listed. They're just digital synths with a few encoders and a small screen (not that there is anything wrong with them it just doesn't seem to solve your problem in any way).  The number of hardware synths out there is staggering. You just have to look into vintage used gear, if everything new is too expensive for you."
synthesizers,3dokmh,30_goats,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:50:16 2015 UTC,The user experience of a 'few encoders and a small display' is vastly different from a vst. Especially for the P6 the buttons and the 6 encoders are used together to make for a pretty hands-on experience. You need some really well configured controllers to rival that with VSTs.
synthesizers,3dokmh,Sylph,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:37:18 2015 UTC,"I believe the preen is analogue and so is the P6, the others are hybrid synths i think. I know there is not to much physical control at one time but it will be nice to have a fm analogue synth for under $250!"

The only one with any analog components is the shruthi, which is a hybrid. I almost want to say you must be trolling.

synthesizers,3dokmh,tugs_cub,3,Sat Jul 18 05:52:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I probably came off as a huge asshole there, and you're just looking for advice.   So the P6 is virtual analog, meant to emulate a typical subtractive analog polysynth architecture but is completely DSP based. Basically a vst in a box.   The Preen is a clone of the famous Yamaha DX7, a digital FM synth. Analog FM on that scale isn't really practical at all, or necessary.   The Shruthi (which I'm pretty sure is discontinued, and any kits left are all that remains unless you get it from a third party) is a digital wave synth with an analog filter and vca. The neat thing about them was you could switch filter boards and have access to different sounds. Same with its big brother the Ambika which was poly up to 6 voices.  The point I was trying to make, is that if you want to take full advantage of a hardware synth, you should get something that has that interface you're looking for. To do this in a poly synth you're looking at a large sum of money. However things like the alpha Juno are analog, cheap, and can be programmed easily with software. Or there are tons of other virtual analog poly synths out there, with excellent interfaces. They're just creeping up in price slowly.  If I were you I'd look at the microbrute/minibrute, or if you can push the budget maybe a bass station 2. They're mono, but hardware, analog and sound great. Good jumping off point for hardware, and you can move forward from there.  Edit: or get one of the volcas."
synthesizers,3dokmh,t0xicd0g,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:15:10 2015 UTC,"if it's mainly the interface that's your concern I wouldn't worry so much about whether the synth is analog  I personally think of some VA/digital hardware as ""VSTs in a box"" but that's because I generally prefer working ITB - except for sounds that only come from weird old hardware or modulars or whatever. It sounds like you want those knobs first and foremost."

synthesizers,3dokmh,midgarden,0,Sat Jul 18 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"Depends how good your ears are, and how well you understand how to control the drift. It wouldn't be easy, but that isn't to say they don't exist or it couldn't be done."
synthesizers,3dokmh,t0xicd0g,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:37:01 2015 UTC,"It can't, not with analogue. I don't think you grasp how mathematically precise the pitch has to be to program FM properly and not have it sounding like a throbby, metallic mess. That's why it didn't really become a serious programming method until digital synths could produce perfect tones."
synthesizers,3dokmh,t0xicd0g,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:10:25 2015 UTC,"6op, yes difficult and probably noisy. 2-3op in analog, not a huge drama to make pretty, have done so myself. I understand the advantage of sines without harmonics, and phase sync, without knowing too much of the maths. But writing it off because the maths says no, without having tried, seems a bit presumptuous. I don't have a large enough system to try, but someone out there might and I would be curious about how impossible it really is."
synthesizers,3dokmh,MultiplyTheBear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:42:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it can't be done in a brief moment when everything stays in tune, but the whole point of FM is a very careful and precise modulation of each sound, tracking perfectly across the keyboard to avoid weird glitchy sound issues. So far I've not come across any analogues that can maintain all of the criteria to give solid, reliable, trackable FM unless what you're actually aiming for is just noisy and unstable. It seems like an enormous ballache to try to achieve it when you could just fire up a DX7, or a VST like Dexed, and do it more reliably, and polyphonically."
synthesizers,3dokmh,carboncopymusic,6,Sat Jul 18 22:55:57 2015 UTC,"Nope, never bored of using VSTs and I have a studio full of hardware. It's just another sound, another tool. I map the controls to my Novation Remote and my Z1 for easy programming. There are VSTs out there that can do things no hardware can do; Zebra, Z3ta+, Reaktor, Massive. Hell, I even get a lot of use out of freebies like Synth1 and Tapeotronic. I'm in it for making music, not stroking gear.   I spent a solid 10 years making music with just software, the only reason I got hardware was because I wanted to expand my palette with stuff software couldn't do as well."

There is no lack of options and there's something for any budget. But you need to know what you're looking for - all of the synths you have mentioned in your post are very different from each other. I recommend looking through this post and the rest of the resources in the sidebar. Give us a better idea of what you want and I'm sure you'll get some good answers."
synthesizers,3dokmh,dbalatero,3,Fri Jul 17 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of synths around $500, especially if you include used.

There's a bustling used market and lots of new stuff coming out as well as inexpensive reissues like the ms20.    That's really the problem.  There's so much out there that it is hard to make a general recommendation.  Take a look at the side bar and follow those links."
synthesizers,3dokmh,workaccountoftoday,3,Fri Jul 17 23:54:08 2015 UTC,"I would be looking at the Roland System-1 or JDXi for poly synths. The system 1 works on its own or with your computer and interfaces really easily with audio over usb. kind of like a pre mapped or preloaded VST and you can switch out synth modeling engines.  for mono synths the Novation Bass StationII, Korg MS-20 mini, Arturia microbrute or minibrute.

A little patching later, and I found myself using my guitar to play my oscillators and control the filter. In another patch, I had a fairly simple signal path of guitar>preamp>distortion>delay. In another, I set up my guitar's signal through a comparator, then put that signal into the sync input of an oscillator and played the oscillator through sync via guitar. Then I went super crazy, used almost all of my patch cables, and was using the guitar as a sound source, pitch source, envelope source, and gate source, was playing in 6-part harmony (guitar alongside oscillators), had the two envelopes controlling pitch and filter cutoff, and had the whole mix going into a delay.

There definitely isn't anything out there that fits quite the same niche. If you are looking for a DCA that's great for pads, leads and lots of the classic sounds, but is a bit darker than the roland and korg options, then the 6r is the thing for you. Just be aware that you'll want to set up a controller to edit the basic functions, and real time tweaking can be tricky. Edits need to be kind of slow if you're going to make them in real time, or the processor can't handle the information and freezes. That having been said, once you have a controller hooked up and programmed to edit, it's a great sounding, fun synth."

Sometimes when these things happen, you can try to pull/reseat the voice chips, which I did, but it didn't work in my case.

Honestly, this piece brings me back to when I first started making music. Over the last few years I feel like I have become more work oriented and almost too caught up in the final results. I have spent a few hours so far just making random mini-pieces of music and not really caring if they sound good; basically I am just hoping to generate as much material as possible to cut up and develop further.  The simplified interface has also helped me just focus on music. It is really easy for me to get caught up in sound design in the beginning stages, while perhaps I should just hammer out the basic structure and melody first and then focus on the sound design.   Also, the on-board synths and effects sound amazing - will definitely be generating a lot of samples with this. So far my favorites are the Grid delay and Cluster synth."

It would never be my end-all-be-all solution to making a song, but it's such a refreshing change of pace when conventional hardware and recording techniques run their course. Like you said, it steers me more in the direction of song structure, than mucking around with parameters.   Here's to hoping they make an OP-2 with more tracks, better built in memory storage (for samples, tracks, songs, etc), the ability to switch between varying projects, designated sequencers per project,and more user-friendly MIDI implementation."
synthesizers,3dmbbo,slujj-vohaul,2,Fri Jul 17 14:53:48 2015 UTC,"If they made an OP-2 I'd hope that it'd be something that compliments the OP-1 rather than replaces it.

It really is a fun piece of kit.   I never used to incorporate the OP-1 much with the rest of my gear in the past, partially because the two I've owned previously had noisy outputs. I just hooked up my OP-1 to my computer last night and drove the different synth engines with Maschine, with the OP-1's audio routed through a bunch of different VST effects. Holy shit. Tons of fun and it sounded great.   I was always under the impression that all OP-1's had inherently noisy outputs, but my most recent one is the only one I've purchased brand new and it's not nearly as noisy. I think I'll incorporate it with my other stuff a lot more now.   Anyway - congrats on the acquisition. Definitely try sequencing it from Ableton and also try driving your other gear with the OP-1s sequencers - lots of fun to do with the ""Finger""."

I've played it at guitar center a few times and it is just so much more inspiring than any of the software synths I use. The wife isn't exactly on board with the price tag at the moment.   What's worse is it had introduced me to the moogerfoogers, particularly the MF-104M SD, and I have no idea why, but I really want this as well. It's price is even less reasonable.  Maybe I can justify it because of their great resell value..."

synthesizers,3dmbbo,sheboygan_sexpo,2,Fri Jul 17 17:59:47 2015 UTC,"I definitely think so, but it requires a lot of hands-on tweaking to really make it shine. Like a synth all onto itself, I have a great time messing with it in real time. As far as bread and butter delay goes, I haven't played any other pedal that sounds as good, but that's more of a preference than anything. Now as far as the right side of the pedal's concerned, you can do amazing modulation with it.   This is the video that convinced me to get one. Granted, that's a guitar demo, but I love the sounds thrown in there.   Here's something I made with it. The windy sound is self-oscillating, modulated-to-shit feedback and every other random noise is me messing with it while it was recording.   It might not be a pedal for everybody, but it's easy to know if it's right for you if you spend a decent amount of time with it. I'd recommend looking at the Eventide Space, too."

It's a good first synthesizer because it's cheap, ubiquitous, and it sounds pretty decent. It suffers because its interface isn't as easy to understand as a knob-per-function synthesizer. It's not bad, per se--just fiddly to edit.   As a second synthesizer for folks who have learnt a bit about synthesis, though, the Microkorg is fabulous. It's cheap and ubiquitous, so for an enthusiast a used MK hovers in the ""impulse buy"" level. The synthesis engine is actually pretty decent, and it packs a lot into a very small package."

So naturally I've come to the most important thing: Acoustic Panelling. I've decided to make my own panels using rockwool after doing extensive research. However, I've been wanting to make the panels a bit more interesting, specifically by colouring the fabric. My question to you guys is:  Would painting acoustic fabric ruin its properties? Would dying it have the same effect? Is there a way I can get creative with the acoustic fabric without ruining its transparency?"
synthesizers,3dmbbo,rodentdp,5,Fri Jul 17 13:23:31 2015 UTC,"I made my own pannels with rockwool (Roxul Safe & Sound) insulation.  I built the frames with 1""x3"" wood that I picked up from my local Home Depot.  There are different widths of Roxul, one for 16"" On Center and one for 24"" On Center.  I used both sizes in my studio.  You'll also want to measure the exact width of the panel of insulation and build a slightly smaller frame, so that the insulation sits snugly within the frame.  Then visit your local fabic store and find a fabric that you like.  Don't worry about painting a fabric but if you want to paint a design on them get a fabric paint at Michaels or an arts and crafts store.  You'll also need a staple gun to secure the fabric in place.  Make sure all of your staples are on the backside of the panel."

That will still be a definite buy for me.  I use the original a ton.  I'm limited on my ability to invest in more hardware by the fact that my PreSonus Audiobox 1818VSL inputs are maxed out until I get a preamp.  PreSonus announced a new preamp at Summer NAMM that looks really good, but retails for $700 so now I'm torn between the new Digimax DP88 or the more basic Digimax D8.  I like the DP88 because it integrates with the PreSonus Studio 192 if I ever want to expand in the future beyond the Audiobox 1818 but $700 is a bit steep at the moment."

Of course, now I've filled all 16 ins on my interface and need to expand, because I have too many patchbays...

It's not like I can afford to go crazy with new synths, but it's kind of a drag when I'm limited in being able to invest in any new gear is stifled by the number of inputs on my interface and the money I want to put toward synths has to go toward a preamp instead."

A couple years ago I got a Focusrite Pro 40 and expanded it via ADAT with a Presonus Digimax FS, which gives me 16 mono/8 stereo ins. Like I said, it still isn't enough any longer, but I don't have to make nearly as many compromises because I utilize this with a couple of patchbays.   I've got a couple of Behringer PX3000 patchbays. I don't think I paid more than $30 for either of them. Don't be put off by the name-this is one of the Behringer products that doesn't suck, although I do sometimes wish the jacks were a little tighter...just the same, they have had no impact on the sound and are easy to set up. They're pretty much maxed out now, so I guess I'll need to cough up another $30. ;)"

I can take some other photos when I go home if you like, but basically the top patchbay is (nearly) all set to Thru and is used for effects (except for a few that I don't have room for on the bottom bay), while the bottom is all for instruments and is set to half-normalled. The first 16 outputs on the bottom patchbay feed into the Pro 40 and Digimax FS. I leave EQ and compression for ITB, although I try to have that mostly worked out before I ever track anything.

synthesizers,3dlclq,zijnvelt,3,Fri Jul 17 09:25:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with the last part, about cutting corners, but that's because kids keep complaining about how expensive they are.   As for the rest, what exactly could they do that hasn't been done before? Old analogs are highly sought after so that's what they are starting to reissue. If you were running a company wouldn't you want to make the things people wanted? I just don't know what else there is to do other than more of the same but other models. I really have no idea what you want. If you want something different, start building a eurorack modular. Now you can have these great reissues AND modules that truly sound different."

synthesizers,3dm3dj,ouqt,6,Fri Jul 17 11:14:18 2015 UTC,"So what I think is happening is: on an inf length track, your change signal only takes in to account how long the pattern has been playing when you actually send a command to change.  The song/chain mode plays a pattern to its end and then plays the 2nd without invoking a pattern change command during the first (eg. it's waiting for the end of the current pattern to invoke the change) - so your first pattern is never reaching it's end due to the inf length setting.  What you can do for song/chain mode is to copy the pattern and designate the specific length that you want for that particular song and insert that into the chain.  It's counter intuitive, but it should solve the problem until Elektron implements a fix."
synthesizers,3dm3dj,user20k,3,Fri Jul 17 13:27:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you. This is very clear, but I've still had to read it a few times to get my head around it. I'm pretty sure you've nailed it, but surely the whole point of the change setting is to avoid this? Thanks, will try your proposed solution and report back.  I will possibly contact Elektron if I determine that it's definitely not me missing something. It's a pretty excellent feature."
synthesizers,3dm3dj,user20k,3,Fri Jul 17 15:38:17 2015 UTC,"Read it again and you've totally nailed it, thanks. I guess they're assuming people will specify lengths when chaining, but it's strange that this negates the whole point of the change setting. I'm going to request an amendment to Elektron."
synthesizers,3dm3dj,MultiplyTheBear,3,Fri Jul 17 15:45:50 2015 UTC,I agree with you here - I think there should be an option in chain/song mode that is available for each INF length pattern that allows you to designate how long you would like that pattern to play before switching.

synthesizers,3dl5ia,ohmtheory,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:54:19 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of fun to be had with a 606. I've not modded mine, I prefer to leave it as-is. But let's have a think...  The hats are a constant source of delight, and you can get an extra hat sound by playing both at the same time.  Of course, don't overlook the accent, which can make a huge difference to a pattern (especially if you vary the strength live).  If you have any syncable gear, you can have great fun with the trigger outs, especially if you set the devices to different metres (3/4 against 4/4 being the classic example, but a 16-step pattern running alongside a 15-step pattern can have interesting results). You should be able to sync the Volca series, Microbrute etc. no problem. With a sequenced synth like the brute, you can edit the tom pattern live to mess with the playback - remove every even-numbered trigger to halve the sequence speed, and so on.  With some synths / sequencers you can also assign the second tom trigger to the start/reset control, making the 606 a fairly versatile metasequencer.  Remember you can switch between write and play modes on the 606 - one of its USPs in the X0X range - so it's good for improvising.  You can string together patterns in Pattern Play mode, as a quick alternative to programming songs.  And don't miss this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkmZIrCFNTo  Tinyloops has a great little 606 area for quick operation refreshers.  Enjoy your 606!"
synthesizers,3dl5ia,3lbFlax,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:12:21 2015 UTC,"It's not the cheapest solution, but the best sync solution is the Quicksilver CPU upgrade. My 606 has USB and MIDI, better sequencer options, better memory, but all the same analog sound generating circuitry."

I sync with a 707 or a 202 or use the 606 as a master to drive lots of other stuff via the trigger sync.    I LOVE oddly triggering patterns on the volcas or sending the trigger to gate my microbrute or mc202.  with the SQ1 you can convert the 606 trigger to midi + cv sequence along with a channel of volca sync."

The reason I settled on the 626 is because it has midi and can follow the master tempo of my rig. So it's a nice bridge from me midi gear to to pre-midi gear, like my Juno 6.  The trigger out is the rim shot, so you can basically program arpeggio patterns. Hope you can do the same!!  Edit: and it was cheap as hell."

synthesizers,3dhfda,fischimuschi,4,Thu Jul 16 14:55:27 2015 UTC,"""Dark techno"" is a bit of a misnomer because, like you said, its really just a style of techno. What people are calling 'dark techno' refers to the sound that got popular out of a club in Berlin called Berghain a few years ago, and is closely associated with acts like Marcel Dettman, Len Faki, and others. It is just techno, but if you listen to enough from that particular scene, there really is a pretty cohesive and consistent sound they have going on.   The other big thing right now is the more industrial-type stuff coming mostly out of the UK (think Karenn, etc).   Minimal and dub techno are, of course, still going strong."

I own a MS-20 mini and a MicroBrute (and use to have a MiniBrute). For some reasons, I think bass is not what they can do best, but again, it depends on what kind of bass you're looking for...  Have you considered other options (Minitaur, Bass Station, etc.) ?  The MS-20 is a more complex beast and that means that with a second oscillator, ring mod, the patch bay, etc, you can produce more ''complex'' sounds as well (larger sound palette).  What the Micro Brute has that the MS-20 hasn't is an arpegiator (or sequencer depending on the model) and an LFO that syncs with a midi clock. I find this really interesting, actually. You will also get a midi out with the MB, something that is lacking on the MS-20. Therefore, you can use it as a midi to CV/Gate converter which is quite cool since you can use it as a gateway between old vintage synths and newer stuff.  Learning curve is faster with the MiniBrute.   Both are quite noisy and agressive."

I know it costs a bit more money, but it has some exceptional features that make it stand out of the monosynth pack.   3 Oscillators, with lots of routing possibilities  Full support for preset saving and recalling, also very fast at swapping presets on the fly  Paraphonic, up too 8 voices  Probably the most sophisticated arpeggiator I've ever used  Very compact, portable, and built like a tank.  I love the ms-20 and it will definitely be my next mono, but it simply isn't as flexible and easy to use as a pulse 2. I've never used a minibrute or microbrute, but I've seen them in stores and they always look pretty cheap and flimsy."

synthesizers,3dh3n0,bingaman,2,Thu Jul 16 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"http://www.motu.com/products/midi/micro_usb   That's $300. You can get a used Blofeld for that price, or a brand new one for $383.  Not to overcomplicate things, but maybe just try a different midi to USB cable? The M-Audio UNO cables are notoriously shitty (I've owned one, can confirm). There are better ones available though, I have an E-MU XMidi cable that works a lot better in my personal experience. Roland and Yamaha also make some, all of them cost around $40 but will likely work better than the UNO cable you have right now. You could always return it and then grab the MOTU if it still didn't work."

synthesizers,3dh3n0,FieldsofBlue,2,Thu Jul 16 18:17:25 2015 UTC,"I own both cables you're talking about. The M-Audio UNO cable cuts out constantly, drops notes, gets stuck notes. If you look around the web there are lots of stories about them sucking in general. I don't feel like hunting down the link, but apparently M-Audio even said outright that if you have one below a certain serial number there are known issues that they don't plan on fixing. Mine is probably 9 or 10 years old so I'm pretty sure I have an older one. The newer ones are probably better but I'd still recommend something else, especially as they're only a few bucks more.  The E-MU cable has worked flawlessly for me though. No problems."
synthesizers,3deu5w,wesontap,9,Wed Jul 15 18:43:56 2015 UTC,Has anyone tried the virtual CZ plugin? I've always been interested in one of the CZs and I'm curious to know how it compares.
synthesizers,3deu5w,30_goats,5,Wed Jul 15 19:14:32 2015 UTC,"it sounds pretty similar, I have a cz3k and the plug-in. I still find myself going for the real version over the software."
synthesizers,3deu5w,jp650,2,Wed Jul 15 20:48:43 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for your input. Do you think that is mostly due to the interface? Or is there something lacking in the sound due to inadequate programming in the software, or the unique aspect of the original D/A?"
synthesizers,3deu5w,30_goats,3,Wed Jul 15 21:09:19 2015 UTC,"I am nearly almost always drawn to a physical interface, even if the CZ isn't the sleekest interface, it can be fun once you get the hang of it. The program is very nice, but it doesn't sound the same.   Perhaps it is the D/A, the way the stereo chorus works, or something else. That said for those who cannot justify the hardware, the software is sufficient (and can be used to transfer patches to the hardware which is already super cool and useful.)"
synthesizers,3deu5w,jp650,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:29:35 2015 UTC,"nice insight. if you don't have space or the money for a new keyboard, is the plug in good enough?"
synthesizers,3deu5w,nickfromdtown,4,Wed Jul 15 22:57:35 2015 UTC,"Haven't tried the VST, but I do have the official Casio CZ iPad app. It sounds fantastic and its 8-stage envelopes are much easier to edit. But, I wish it ran more efficiently. Don't know why it's computationally so intense."
synthesizers,3deu5w,kerm,5,Thu Jul 16 01:47:21 2015 UTC,"I recently bought a CZ-1 and have owned Virtual CZ for a while.  The plug-in RARELY matches up with what the CZ does with the same parameters. Although their interfaces are exactly the same and they both are capable of making great sounds, I find that the same patch in Virtual CZ will often sound different on the actual CZ.  Don't get me wrong though. It is a great plug-in sound-wise and intuitively, and it played a big part in my decision to buy a physical model.  You should also know that the CZ-1 is actually more powerful than plug-in due to a few hidden features that can only be accessed via sysex editing. This dude created a librarian that can access these hidden features. It would be a better alternative to Virtual CZ if only it could send the Sysex in realtime as Virtual CZ does."
synthesizers,3deu5w,Sabored,3,Wed Jul 15 23:52:50 2015 UTC,"great points, you have summed up most of my thoughts as well. I also have both, but I prefer the hardware, even though the software is good as well."
synthesizers,3deu5w,jp650,2,Thu Jul 16 03:31:36 2015 UTC,"I like the Virtual CZ. I haven't done a 1-to-1 comparison with my CZ-101, but it definitely captures the plasticky, not quite analog spirit of the sound."
synthesizers,3deu5w,jepyang,6,Thu Jul 16 03:08:50 2015 UTC,I had a CZ-1 and a CZ-101.  Really awesome.  There's a VirtualCZ plugin that's awesome.  Fills my need.
synthesizers,3deu5w,manysounds,5,Wed Jul 15 20:19:13 2015 UTC,"I still have my CZ synths.  The envelopes were a refreshing departure from the standard ADSR.  The ""key off"" step which you could apply anywhere within the envelope was very cool. I wish all synths implemented this in their envelope structures."
synthesizers,3deu5w,soundeziner,5,Wed Jul 15 23:59:56 2015 UTC,"The super flexible envelopes (six of them!!) on the CZs are their hidden weapon. They're kind of hard to wrap your head around if you're used to ADSR, which I suspect is part of why these guys are still so underrated. There's a lot of wicked sound design to be had from using the envelopes in clever ways that are entirely impossible on most other synths."
synthesizers,3deu5w,jepyang,2,Thu Jul 16 03:15:36 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to program one for the last few nights. I'm struggling to understand the envelopes completely. With the DCO, each 8 steps is a semitone, so 56=7, 96=12(but it seems to squeal at a much higher pitch). I'm trying to work out how to get the pitch to step like it's being modulated by a square wave or an arp, having trouble getting it to happen. Making the envolope stay at one setting for a duration doesn't work due to the level/rate method, right?  Hmmmmm. Writing this, I think I'll just change the level by one unit and have the rate low.  I wish that there was an LFO for the DCW, that'd be cool."
synthesizers,3deu5w,DisposableGamera,4,Thu Jul 16 07:46:54 2015 UTC,That sounded so damn good. The textures CZ's tend to make are so smooth and round to my ears.

It is an amazing patch editor that allows you to access most if not all parameters without having to dive into multiple sub menus and eliminating the need for the tiny onboard lcd. Total game changer if you already own all the peripherals, imo. The developer was also very helpful and responsive when I had issues getting set up initially which actually turned out to be an error on my end. I highly recommend it if you love your CZ! https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cz-touch/id944094485?mt=8  Edit: just realized it's available for iPhone also"

synthesizers,3deu5w,slujj-vohaul,5,Wed Jul 15 19:30:28 2015 UTC,Any synth as good as a CZ-101 that can still be had regularly for less than $150 remains underrated in my book. I would take CZ-101s over Volcas all day every day.

synthesizers,3dgmzu,Laqweesha,3,Thu Jul 16 02:59:42 2015 UTC,"On my 6, it's a fairly subtle filter, kinda like a 6db highpass with no resonance (which, as far as I know, that may be what it is). I think it's a little more pronounced on the 106, but either way you won't get a hell of a lot out of it. It's more for taking out the mud than shaping the sound.   If you really can't hear any change at all, run it through an oscilloscope or spectrograph/spectral analyser and make sure that when you up the hpf slider, the lows are cut a bit. If not you may have a problem."
synthesizers,3dgmzu,AvarethTaika,5,Thu Jul 16 03:20:55 2015 UTC,"You should notice a cutoff in the lower register, exactly the opposite of a low pass filter.   Typically you won't see people playing with the slider because it's more of a utility to remove low end mud and boominess. Whereas lpf's on synths are designed specifically for more musical implementations and interactions with various harmonics (see resonance)."
synthesizers,3dgmzu,30_goats,3,Thu Jul 16 03:22:54 2015 UTC,"The HPF is a global filter, so it wouldn't show up on a voice chip test anyway.  It just cuts the bass out of your sound. Good for light, airy pads and other high register sounds that you don't want competing in the mix. Subtle and utilitarian rather than expressive and musical.

I say let any musician get out what they want, it's well produced.  Maybe next album he'll have the 80s out of his system and go back to making psych music.

synthesizers,3de14z,MultiplyTheBear,2,Wed Jul 15 23:36:58 2015 UTC,"Always been a huge fan of Tame Impala!  I envy those who get to hear all the songs on this album at once.  I definitely overplayed the singles he released, so the album may have lost a bit of its charm on me.  It also didn't help that the new Ratatat, Beach House, and Mac Demarco albums were released within 3 days of this.  Love the bass lines though."
synthesizers,3de14z,slippage,2,Wed Jul 15 21:52:21 2015 UTC,"I wasn't expecting too, but I really like it so far. Synths are sounding very interesting, works really cool with the songwriting. Sure a departure from their usual style, which doesn't really bother me, although maybe there could be more guitar in there to make it less of a jump in style. I think the real question is, what will they do next?"
synthesizers,3de14z,workaccountoftoday,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:37:37 2015 UTC,I don't find the shift to be that surprising in this album.  The next album will be a collaboration with Skrillex...

synthesizers,3dfmmz,dadbody,2,Wed Jul 15 22:32:28 2015 UTC,Glad someone got something out of that sale.   I hate desoldering braid as well so I use a sucker. Way better for me.

synthesizers,3dfmmz,Bornhorst,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:46:05 2015 UTC,"I would think you want to use whatever method gives minimal heat exposure to the board... so if sucker is faster (I.e you leave the iron on the board less vs. copper braid) I'd do that.  Also if you're desoldering ICs and want to minimize localized heat, switch chip sides each pin you desolder, and skip down one. That way you apply heat to one side, then the other, and you don't concentrate it as much. At least this is what I do with my desoldering gun."
synthesizers,3dfmmz,mdrsharp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"I wish I had a desoldering gun!  And I have a friend who mentioned he used a little rubber squeeze ball before, I may give that a shot as it seems safe.  I just don't want to pull off the leads and be screwed!"

synthesizers,3dg4kk,darksouled,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:24:32 2015 UTC,It's not about the keyboard you use but the patch you make with it. Alot of synths will have flute patches that might come close to that or will be easy to modify to get that. This article will help. http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct03/articles/synthsecrets.htm
synthesizers,3dg4kk,fracdoctal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:59:06 2015 UTC,Sounds like a real melodica.
synthesizers,3dg4kk,whocareswhatever,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:59:21 2015 UTC,I think you have the wrong instrument.  A melodica is a mouth-driven reed organ.  This is more like a pan flute.
synthesizers,3dg4kk,peg_leg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:15:46 2015 UTC,sounds like a cheap Casio pan flute.
synthesizers,3dg4kk,peg_leg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:16:00 2015 UTC,"Just sounds like a little toy pump organ to me.  Pretty sure that's not a flute patch on a keyboard.  Sounds acoustic, like everything else in this track. Something recorded in a room.  Don't think it's melodica, as that's a bit too reedy sounding."

That track is just the Electribe 2. My full ambient setup is that, the Octatack, Audiothingies P6, Sidrax Organ, Microgranny, an assortment of pedals and a 4-track tape recorder. And guitar. I like to layer everything in real time as well, the Octatrack is great for that (and many many other things).  The Boomerang pedal looks great, especially since it has MIDI sync."

synthesizers,3df4m5,sd12hu,3,Wed Jul 15 21:37:21 2015 UTC,"A track I did a few months ago. This was my first attempt at an ambient space drone type track using a cassette four track (which was the style at the time).  I recorded each sustained chord separately to tape using a Yamaha MT4X. Each chord is four notes, the highest is Bass Station 2,  the remaining three are JX-3P & EM101 (this makes for huge string sounds), and the bass note is played again by the CZ-5000 with some delay. Lots of reverb added from the BigSky. I played around with the EQ for a nice noisey tape saturation sound. I then applied more reverb when transferring from tape to PC."

This happened straight out of the box, it was a mechanical fault and I returned it to the shop and got a replacement. I'm assuming yours is doing the same thing, I'd get a repair / replacement if it's still under warranty.                  I'm not sure what's going on with the Novation Launchkey 49 but it's sometimes handy to run a midi monitor when using these things to see what exact midi messages are being sent out or received. I use this one for OSX which is free: http://www.snoize.com/MIDIMonitor/ It's really helped me figure out a few midi problems, well worth a download."
synthesizers,3dgw31,splitradix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:06:40 2015 UTC,If your on windows you can use Midiox to check out what messages your midi controllers are sending.

synthesizers,3dgw31,pwdm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:10:54 2015 UTC,"Your right this is something common to synths. The switches, pots and encoders can become gunked up over time.

That button I basically used once when I first got it. It's a shortcut to a basic shitty delay effect. I'd say go for it and don't look back.   Make sure the other buttons (especially the MFX) all work and the three encoders at the top are essential.  I think it's possible that this is a machine built in a way that some genius on YouTube may have an instructional video on how to fix it anyway.   Have fun."

synthesizers,3de15o,slujj-vohaul,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:30:44 2015 UTC,iConnectMIDI4+ is the interface to end all MIDI interfaces.
synthesizers,3de15o,Auxren,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:28:46 2015 UTC,"yes, it's called a midi interface and there are tons of them on the market. I know it's a tad misleading these days due to all the gear that connects with USB (and acts like a midi interface for the OS). But there are a lot of USB interfaces which offer a variety of midi in/outs combinations. And they're not expensive either."
synthesizers,3de15o,littlegreenalien,2,Wed Jul 15 16:52:59 2015 UTC,"what would be an example of a popular one that is available. I'm seeing a ton of interfaces that will connect DIN MIDI to a computer's USB master, but not much of anything ('cept that kenton unit linked above) that will connect a MIDI USB slave (like a mini USB keybed) to DIN MIDI.  My point being: USB MIDI almost always requires a computer in the mix to act as the master."
synthesizers,3de15o,littlegreenalien,2,Wed Jul 15 17:08:01 2015 UTC,"oh. if that's the case, there is little else on the market then the kenton unit. You see. USB midi actually doesn't exist. It's just an integrated midi interface which started happening since midi finally got a standardised driver model so you didn't had to install drivers on your pc/mac to use it, cause the generic ones covers it all. But, as with any usb connection, you need a controller (the computer) which supplies power and a USB timing control. Since USB needs a CPU to perform that control it's not that simple to reverse this, as you need some kind of computer to be the master. You could use a raspberry PI or stuff like that to be the master, maybe an iphone/android can do it. When everything had DIN midi you could hook up everything with anything, which was the whole point. It's sad that this is going away."
synthesizers,3ddbhe,daithibowzy,6,Wed Jul 15 11:14:51 2015 UTC,"I've used Maschine to sequence external gear for about five years. What do you want to know? It's incredibly easy to set up, extremely useful - basically the one piece of kit I'd recommend to anyone and everyone if they're even mildly interested in making pattern based music (as long as they aren't adverse to the hybrid hardware & computer route).  I just upgraded from my MK1 to the Studio this past week. Got it used for just over $600 on eBay in mint condition. What a fucking steal. The workflow is incredible and I just turn my monitors off when I use it now. The Studio also has three midi outs built into it so you don't have to fuss with midi-USB cables for gear that doesn't have USB built in.  I know you have the System-1 as well - I'm planning on the 1M being my next purchase. I've been through so much gear, pretty much all the modern monosynths on the market, and the hardware approach with some software integration is really appealing to me. I have a Minitaur and I tweak everything from the hardware, but I can load in new patches from it's software counterpart if I want. I can press REC on Maschine and all the tweaks I make to it in real time record as automation in the Maschine software. Same exact thing will apply with the System-1M. Just really nice and convenient to have patch recall, 1-1 hardware-software integration, extremely tight sequencing, etc while, most importantly, retaining HANDS ON control. Interface and workflow are king to me. It's basically an infinitely expandable workstation with a focus on sequencing. The trade off with being tied to a computer is pretty minor in my experience - I use my computer to record anyway so all my gear is next to it to begin with.  ...Anyway. Yeah. It rules. If you can find a cheap used Maschine Studio, I'd recommend it, but the MK1's and 2's are good too. If you buy used, ensure you're getting one with proper (unregistered) software included - avoid pawn shops, etc.  Edit: One more thing. Don't forget that Maschine also fucking rules for chopping samples, all the included NI software (Reaktor, Kontakt, Massive, all that shit), and the built in FX. I used to be big on external FX but since I got the Studio I think I'm just going to route my external synths audio through software FX and control them using the Maschine controller. Just really useful in so many ways."
synthesizers,3ddbhe,slujj-vohaul,2,Wed Jul 15 15:10:13 2015 UTC,"Cool, that's loads of good info. I might be able to get one on the cheap as I've a few friends who work for NI. I also forgot about sampling capabilities. Might not need an octatrack after all. :)"

What is it specifically you want to know?  You need to use the Maschine software as well, so if you're looking for a computer free setup, arturia beatstep pro is probably a better way to go.  But it's pretty much as simple as assigning Maschine sounds/pads to a midi out channel, and then use it as you usually use software synths in Maschine."

synthesizers,3dd45s,cu_mu_lu_s,6,Wed Jul 15 09:33:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely sounds like it has something to do with invisible program changes. You probably left ""overdub"" on while changing programs on the BS2, and the MPC recorded it.   If it happens every time you start a new sequence, maybe you accidentally saved a default sequence that includes a program change at some point. Go to Step Edit (Pad 14) and make sure there are no Program Changes there. If there are, delete it and save the default sequence (I think hoover over the sequence name and press ""window""). There's also ""PC"" on the main screen, bottom right, I think you can set this to ""off""."

synthesizers,3dd45s,t0xicd0g,3,Wed Jul 15 11:04:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you change a patch on the BS2 while it's connected, it will be sending out the program change (unless the BS2 allows you to shut down sending program changes over MIDI - some synths do have that as an option)."

synthesizers,3dc6hk,TheSonofMrGreenGenes,6,Wed Jul 15 03:12:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but I'll offer my take. The LP/SlimP has a bit more of a creamier sound to my ears, like the model D. The oscillators are a bit brighter, and the drive is a bit more wild. However, the Sub series has a bigger beefier sound, with the sub oscillator and everything is a bit tighter. I'd say the Source sounds the most Minimoogish.   They all have ""that"" sound, just pick one based on features you want (module, keyboard, mod capabilities, knobiness)."

synthesizers,3dc6hk,sezdaniel,8,Wed Jul 15 14:32:38 2015 UTC,"The Studio Electronics SE-1x is supposed to be a pretty good rack alternative, with memory and a few other features. I usually see them up for $700-800 used. They also have the new Boomstar 5089 which is a basic tabletop module with filter modeled after the Moog. A lot of synths have the Moog sound, if you must have the specific sound of the Model D, I'm not sure if there's an exact copy. Even in demos it seems there's a noticeable difference between the Voyager and Model D. Every Moog I've played has sounded good, but I much prefer the Voyager and Sub to the Phatties."
synthesizers,3dc6hk,cehmu,3,Wed Jul 15 06:29:31 2015 UTC,also studio electronics MIDI Mini is the closest you'll get to an exact copy of the model D.  maybe not too cheap though?  just under $2k?  something like that?
synthesizers,3dc6hk,sezdaniel,3,Wed Jul 15 06:37:21 2015 UTC,"This is true, I think they were calling it the MidiMoog or something for a while. I don't know how much those go for but I think they actually used replacement boards for the Model D or just converted them. Eventually they designed the SE-1 to replace that, and the SE-1x is the updated version. I would imagine the MIDI mini or MidiMoogs are more expensive, probably more than a Voyager RME."
synthesizers,3dc6hk,kopkaas2000,3,Wed Jul 15 06:55:20 2015 UTC,"Moog prices are strange, once you separate the hardware from the pretty box. I own a Voyager Old School that someone converted into a Eurorack modular. It's still a Voyager, but it doesn't have a wooden box and a pretty logo, so the guy I bought it from spent more than a year trying to get it sold for €1000, before I showed up.  You see the same thing with the prices for Moog's new modular re-issues. MOS-Lab and COTK use the same designs, but charge less than 1/4 the price."

This isn't the first time he has done this; after playing an OBX a few years ago, he made the crOwBX clone.   I'm midway through building one myself at the moment. The form-factor of it isn't for everyone (its all on an 8.5x11"" PCB), but many of the builders are opting to make control panels and cases for it.

Any of the modern Moogs you mentioned would probably be fine. I think the biggest differences between them are the features.  Another option is a synthesizers.com modular. You could probably get the modular equivalent of a Minimoog for about the price of the Sub 37 (less if you can build your own cabinet). A cheaper option would be a few eurorack modules and a Moog MF101."
synthesizers,3dc6hk,30_goats,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:56:43 2015 UTC,Yes vintage would be great.  Any specific feedback on the MG-1? I know someone selling one for $450 CAN. Unless I found a prodigy.

synthesizers,3ddvxd,t0xicd0g,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:22:34 2015 UTC,"Why would it be near impossible?  It's MIDI.  People have been using MIDI for over 30 years now.  Depending on which unit you get, you might have to use a floppy disk.  You can get a USB floppy drive for $15 if you don't own a computer with one.  You could probably transfer the MIDI files over your MIDI cables with your computer and DAW.  These types of units are usually fairly flexible.  The worst case scenario is that you hit record on a sequencer and hit play on your DAW and record the MIDI in real time, but most sequencers have better ways to transfer MIDI.  If you wanted something more modern, you could get a groove box like a Korg Electribe, or a sequencing sampler like an Akai MPC.  These can read and write MIDI files to/from compact flash or SD cards."

synthesizers,3ddvxd,slujj-vohaul,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"That's what I do at the momentm : write in Reason and use an MPC 1000 (not mine) for live playing.   So I know it's possible to do it with some old machines, the void is because no manufacturer (apart for those really small niche sequencers pointed above) are still doing those. That's surprising to me because so many people still consider the MPC1000 the way to go (newer MPC aren't standalone) and that there's a huge interest in hardware gear.  Sure you can use old sequencers, but things could be a lot easier with USB transfer and also hose machine could be really simplified if you consider the fact that most editing could be done one the computer. So instead of having a music production center, it could be more like a portable MIDI file sender or something like that for people who does live shows."

The MIDI is very basic right now, but I plan to get some sort of MIDI interface and beef it up.  I've got the MC-303 that I use to sequence the MPX16 sampler. These were my 2 stupid purchases, because I didn't realize the MPX16 didn't have a sequencer, and I could have gotten a much more advanced item than the MC-303. I also use the MC-303 to provide a MIDI clock for the Microbrute (for use with the sequencer and synced LFO), but at the moment that requires some cable swapping. I use the MPK25 as a MIDI controller, but I also use a Rockband 3 guitar as a MIDI controller, which I eventually plan to have all set up so that both MIDI controllers could be used for control any of the devices.  The black thing is a Fostex MR8, an 8-track recorder. It's got MIDI out as well, so I may consider making that the master clock, but for now I've just been enjoying it for recording only.  edit: oh yeah, and it isn't hooked up in this photo, but theres a reverb pedal and a delay pedal on the upper right shelf that I run thru the FX loop of the mixer, which then goes into the recorder"

synthesizers,3d9li6,daithibowzy,11,Tue Jul 14 15:58:07 2015 UTC,"i will be frank: sequencing the analog four or rytm with anything other than the built-in sequencers is dumb. they both respond to transport and tempo control, so you should have no problem syncing them up with other gear."
synthesizers,3d9li6,nikofeyn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:47:35 2015 UTC,"Also there is literally not a better sequencer than the ones built into the rytm and a4. Basically the odd duck in your setup is the system-1. Get something with CV in and sequence it from the a4. Or yeah, get an octatrack if you got the money to burn, why not?"
synthesizers,3d9li6,bingaman,8,Tue Jul 14 18:22:15 2015 UTC,"So...are you looking for something to cover midi sequencing, since your current Elektron gear already has some powerful internal sequencing? I can't see any other reason why you would need another sequencer, other than that you don't really have an OTB midi sequencer.  Assuming that is the case...I wouldn't talk you out of an Octatrack, but it isn't the only option. I love my OT, but I'm also really coming to love the possibilities of using an MPC 1000 with JJOS, which is a nice alternative to Elektron's step sequencing approach, with a serious amount of sequencing tracks (32 vs. 8 on the OT)...if you go this route, and trick it out/ have to get the pad upgrade, JJOS2XL, etc. I would anticipate spending up to $800, but you'll likely be able to come in cheaper if you shop around and find one with some upgrades already done. Still much cheaper than an OT, although it's not nearly as good for sample mangling.  Another option I would look at would be an iPad and the upcoming Modstep sequencer. By all accounts, this thing is going to be awesome. The last thing I need is another sequencer, but I'm still itching to get this."
synthesizers,3d9li6,rodentdp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:16:23 2015 UTC,Which JJOS do you run? I run paid OS 3 and it's a pain to sequence MIDI. In fact it stopped working at all about a week ago and I haven't got it working again.
synthesizers,3d9li6,kalda341,4,Wed Jul 15 05:46:28 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand why you think you need another sequencer when you've already got 2 powerful multi-track sequencers in the A4 and RYTM. Can't you use one of the tracks of those to sequence your System-1?  If you do get an Octatrack, it would add a new dimension of sampling to your setup.   If money is an obstacle - you could try the Korg SQ-1 for the time-being, but as I said before, I'd be using a track from either the A4 or the RYTM and using MIDI on the System-1."
synthesizers,3d9li6,ranzee,2,Tue Jul 14 16:27:14 2015 UTC,A4 and RYTM can't sequence external gear. :(
synthesizers,3d9li6,nikofeyn,5,Tue Jul 14 16:54:00 2015 UTC,"i would recommend taking a step back and consider what you are wanting to sequence. with your gear, only the system-1 is left out of the sequencing party.  i think you have some options:   buy an octatrack for sampling and to sequence the system-1. this provides you 4-note sequencing. just live play the system-1. trade the system-1 for a sytem-1m where it would play nice with the analog four. note you lose polyphonic sequencing here with those two machines. get the beatstep pro to sequence the system-1 (i don't know about polyphony here) and sync up with the analog four and rytm sequencers via clock and transport (through midi)"

synthesizers,3d9li6,shomusic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:22:59 2015 UTC,The A4 can sequence via Cv. It provides 4 outputs of cv and/or gate signals it can sequence any thing that accepts cv. u have to use the cv track or the Fx tracks.. There are lots of possibilities with the a4. An octatrack can sequence 8 instruments via midi if im not mistaken.

synthesizers,3d9li6,MultiplyTheBear,3,Wed Jul 15 16:35:12 2015 UTC,I use my machinedrum to sequence the tr8 And minitaur. Its amazing. I can do lfo's And parameter locks on any knob of both machines. It gives a new dimension to these machines! The octatrack has a better sequencer but only 8 midi tracks! So if you dont need micro timing The machine drum is a good buy!
synthesizers,3d9li6,The0Justinian,3,Tue Jul 14 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"Well, the sequencers on the Elektron gear should be perfect for sequencing those instruments, anything external won't be as well suited for controllilng them. If you absolutely must have a central brain for your setup, might as well jump in there and get one of the best, head for an MPC 1000 with JJOS. 64 tracks of sequencing, over 32 MIDI channels (16 through each MIDI out), and a whole truck full of sampling capabilities on top of that. As a sequencer it is a far better option than an Octatrack; as a sampler, the Octatrack is a better option than the MPC.   In this situation, I'd leave the RYTM and A4 to their own sequencers and just slave stop/start to the MPC, which can then also sequence the System 1 (or just sync up the arpeggiator). An MPC is not just a great box by itself, with no other gear and just a bag full of samples; it's also a great investment because it will probably take you a while to outgrow its capabilities as a sequencer."
synthesizers,3d9li6,qtuner,2,Tue Jul 14 21:08:59 2015 UTC,"I've got the Beatstep Pro and I am really loving it. There are admittedly a few bugs that will hopefully get fix with firmware updates but overall it is really fun.  I am not very familiar with Elektron gear, but I'm surprised if they cannot sequence external gear or at least send clock so you can sync various Arps/Sequences."
synthesizers,3d9li6,rodentdp,2,Tue Jul 14 16:11:49 2015 UTC,What do you want out of a sequencer that you're not getting from the Elektrons? It's one of the best out there IMO...
synthesizers,3d9li6,TheGreatWildFrontier,2,Tue Jul 14 16:12:37 2015 UTC,"BSPs will chain together off of clock pulses, don't know if they'll listen for global start/stop off of each other.  There's also that new guy that came out from Europe that is fully polyrhythmic (little help on the name?  found it: http://squarp.net/ ...the pyramid) and fully polyphonic, but the graphical/UI side of it is a little thin for me.  And it's really expensive for something with no sounds inside.  You could also go with an electribe 2 or even roland MV-series, the latter of which will run a midi sequence on each of its 64 tracks...but the MV is straying dangerously close to being a DAW."
synthesizers,3d9li6,revolved,2,Tue Jul 14 16:35:58 2015 UTC,i'm in the same boat you are. I currently have an octatrack and i'm and i'm still learning the midi sequencer.  My only complaint so far is that midi tracks are limited to 4 bars. I would prefer 8.  I'm experimenting with external controllers now.  I'm planning on buying octaedit when it releases later this summer.  I hope this will make things easier.  I'm keeping an eyeout on the pyramid standalone sequencer as well.
synthesizers,3d9li6,rodentdp,4,Tue Jul 14 19:27:03 2015 UTC,"You can get it to play 8 bars, or even longer, using the tempo multipliers. You can take this even further by running the tracks independently, so you could have one track playing at half the speed against another track set to the overall tempo."
synthesizers,3d9li6,revolved,2,Tue Jul 14 19:50:07 2015 UTC,"Yup. It can be a little hard to grasp the sequencer on the OT and all it can do, but it's all about working with it."

A lot of the editing is impossible without the editor, which runs in XGworks, an obsolete Yamaha DAW. It won't play nice with your setup on sync, runs about 30ms behind.

It wasn't out of sync as long as you stuck to one pattern.   I have a 15min track that uses one pattern and never slips.  But if you try to change patterns during a song, there is a delay each time you change which quickly builds up to unusable.  If you use it as a sound module rather than a groove box, you'd have no issue.    I no longer have it.  Bought it while living abroad and left it with a friend who had no hardware to twiddle."

The LinnDrum sampled sounds from 28 to a 35 kHz sample rate. Also, the LinnDrum was $2,000 less than the LM-1.""

The drum buttons were engraved with a small symbol of the drum it represented (the bass drum button had a small engraving of a bass drum on it). These buttons were later discontinued because they were too expensive to manufacture. Internally it was different as well. It had single chips for the kick, tom, and conga sounds, and double chips for the clap. The Rev. 1 LM-1's did not have the filter on the kick, toms, and congas that Rev. 2 and later machines had.

It also has the ability to give those sounds the characteristics of having been produced by a vibrating string, or in the mouthpiece of a tuba, or having been amplified by resonating through the body of an acoustic guitar.  That part is the physical modeling, but the carrier signal being processed by the physical modeling engine is generated by granular synthesis.

I've had a few people say this to me over the past few years. Hard to believe, being a big synth guy - but I listened to JMJ, Vangelis and the SynthPop scene from the UK and AUS.  I forgot to mention that this song actually started as a Microbrute running through the MF-107 to see what the 2nd Oscillator would sound like. Then I added some nice ARP from the MiniBro, then the filter. Then the song grew from there.   This is how I like to work - like a path of discovery."

synthesizers,3d6rzg,3funky,15,Mon Jul 13 23:35:09 2015 UTC,"What's basically going on is that you're using an audio rate oscillator (modulator) to apply vibrato to another audio rate oscillator (the carrier), and the level is basically how much vibrato you apply. (There's a bit more to it than this simple explanation, but it gets you in the vague ballpark of what's going on)Because the frequency is so high, it doesn't register with our ears as vibrato, but as a note with a lot of new and interesting harmonics, and if you also start modulating the modulator with another modulator, a waveform can degenerate into mush pretty fast. But that's the basic principle. It's almost the reverse of subtractive synthesis in that you start with a smooth, boring sine wave and turn it more biting and aggressive by frequency modulating it.  Also this might help you a lot to grasp it better :)"
synthesizers,3d6rzg,t0xicd0g,2,Mon Jul 13 23:42:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response, so does the modulation frequency determine the number of times vibrato occurs per second? And the index, the frequency-range of the vibrato? I definitely feel like I'm getting closer..."
synthesizers,3d6rzg,t0xicd0g,5,Mon Jul 13 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"Kind of, but not quite; the modulator frequency is a note that tracks the keyboard as you play but isn't actually audible by itself, only by the effect it has on the carrier. If it is set to the same note as the carrier, regardless of octave, you will have a (relatively) clean note; as you detune the modulator the sound gets nastier and nastier until it just becomes noise. The higher the octave of the modulator with regards to the carrier, the more bell like the FMd sound gets. The lower, the more metallic and grungy. Obviously you get interesting harmonics at the fifths and other notes. Try to think of it this way instead of in terms of modulations per second; that sort of stuff isn't necessary and won't help you that much."

synthesizers,3d6rzg,CompuFart,0,Tue Jul 14 04:39:01 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure what t0xicd0g is referring to is actually amplitude modulation. And that's what passes for FM on a lot of synthesizers, including the Yamaha DX-series of synthesizers. But if you're using one of the thru-zero frequency modulation functions available on a number of new and recent Eurorack modules, those genuinely do utilize frequency modulation. This image presents a fairly good visualization of both FM and AM, although note the ""signal"" referenced in that image is the modulator signal -- the carrier signal is not displayed."
synthesizers,3d6rzg,t0xicd0g,3,Tue Jul 14 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"The DX series  uses phase modulation. For a simple explanation, vibrato is apt. Amplitude modulation is more closely associated with tremolo. I'm not aware of AM passing much for FM."

The new Korg Electribe 2.   Possible to have 16 polyphonic sequences. And it has drums and other acceptable synth sounds to boot. I have mine set up to control my prophet 08 module, MS-20 mini, Minibrute, and Eurorack setup and it's awesome. I was up and running within an hour. Super easy to use. I can't recommend it enough.

I had an eye on the new electribe too (especially the sampler version one). + it ties nicely with ableton live, which I use.   edit: are you limited to only 16 steps? At the very least it's nice to keep everything synced up...You say you use it to control your prophet, ms 20, minibrute etc. Can you expand on this a bit?"
synthesizers,3d7bvy,Auxren,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:44:41 2015 UTC,"I have my Korg M50 set up as my master MIDI controller (nice 88 weighted keys). I'll press record on the Electribe, metronome will start going and it loops through and I can record up to 4 bars. Switch to another track, do it again. Super easy.  You aren't limited to 16 steps. Not sure what the quantization is, but it's got a fairly high resolution so I can get really funky and play some interesting stuff.  I haven't explored the extent of the polyphony besides 2-3 polyphonic tracks, but there doesn't seem to be an issue there.  I am using an iConnectMIDI4+ to get all the synths and Electribe to talk to each other.  Here is an example of something quick and dirty I did with the Electribe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1rdGvgCwhs"
synthesizers,3d7bvy,meesloo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:38:58 2015 UTC,"sweet rig.  So. You can play midi into the electribe: - i'm guessing you have to use the midi adapter to go from midi din to the small ports. Any issues there? - are you playing back the internal synths of the electribe, or are you simply recording a midi sequence and then routing out the parts to your different gear?, so for example the so called ""16 parts (what you call tracks?)"" on the electribe can each be sent out using 16 midi channels?   thanks for getting into the details. cool vid."
synthesizers,3d7bvy,Auxren,2,Tue Jul 14 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on what I want to do. If a keyboard is the right controller for what I want to record, I play it on the keyboard, MIDI out via USB through the iConnectMIDI4+ to the Electribe via USB MIDI. You can also do MIDI DIN to MIDI DIN. No issues there, it's pretty flawless. Just need to set the MIDI controller to the right channel based off which track I want to record to. I am playing both a mix of internal synths on the electribe and external synths. All the drums are internal. I think in that recording everything else was external but sequencer by the electribe except for some of the eurorack stuff; it was clocked by the electribe and played on it's own.  But yea, the 16 tracks can send out 16 different MIDI channels worth of information to 16 devices. You could easily use the electribe as your 'brain' and have all the sound making be external. It's an awesome replacement for a computer."
synthesizers,3d7bvy,meesloo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:50:44 2015 UTC,"awesome. thanks for going in depth.  I'm looking for a brain that could replace my mpc1000, which although great, isn't really for me. I like the portability and built in synth / drum options of the ES2. I'm more partial to the ES sampler, but I don't know enough about the internal synth sounds if it's a good idea. I want the best of both worlds - decent basic synth and sampling.  Anyway, so if I understand correctly the iConnect midi can take midi from a usb keyboard and conver it to midi din? Are you using it sans computer entirely? If so that's an impressive unit and a good way to get around the computer. Ie. the microbrute doesn't have midi out, so with something like the iconnectmidi, it could send midi via usb ?   Getting a little off topic, with that.   Anyway. The electribe sounds pretty good. Technically, could you also just get a midi keyboard, (say a mpk25) and midi into the electribe and play polyphonic synth? And then, at a hit of a button you can just switch it to another ""part"" and play that synth patch?  Sorry for all the questions. This thing is starting to sound pretty appealing, and might make me want to sell some gear (microkorg) to get it + a cheap midi keyboard..."
synthesizers,3d7bvy,Auxren,2,Tue Jul 14 19:58:06 2015 UTC,"Yup, no computer involved. The iConnectMIDI4+ has a USB host port on the back and you can connect up to 8 USB MIDI devices and send the data around to any of the other devices and DIN jacks and computers and iOS devices and Ethernet even.   But yea, if you want to play it with a keyboard, use one, if not, the buttons are cool to play on too and can be programmed to various scales."

synthesizers,3d7bvy,Auxren,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:38:08 2015 UTC,"You can adjust the bar length independently for each of the channels. As far as number of bars, it's global for the whole pattern.

It also has two MIDI inputs, 2 MIDI outputs allowing for control of up to 32 MIDI devices. It saves data onto readily available Compact Flash cards, or you can install a hard drive in it, or you can pipe in data via USB.

synthesizers,3d7bvy,rodentdp,2,Tue Jul 14 05:47:23 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the RS7000 :) Also has a lot more extra than what OP is asking (sampler and synthesis mainly), but it features a really powerful 16 track sequencer, with three different sequencing methods (live record, grid and step). Detailed quantization options, midi effects like chord, reverse and drum roll, and much more. You can chain up patterns and fully arrange a whole song, but it's also great for playing live, triggering loops a la ableton.

Really fun groove box if you are willing/able to work around the many little idiosyncrasies. The 808 really needs to be tied to a cpu to do deeper editing of the voices, but works just fine as a sequencer standalone. Plus, motorized faders are cool shit. Picked mine up for $300 a few years ago.   One thing to consider is if you want something that is just a sequencer, or something that samples/makes sounds of its own.

It has midi out, so you can record the midi data to a computer sequencer or something if you don't want to deal with the disk drive. The RM1x runs circles around the MC 303 as a sequencer, but as others have said, there are newer ones on the market that will get you where you want for that price. Also, look into which ROM version on the yammie. With v 1.0, stopping the sequencer sends pattern changes to externally attached gear which is a pain if you don't handle pc' on start. I never experienced the drift you're mentioning."
synthesizers,3d7bvy,maxxx_orbison,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:35:46 2015 UTC,I have the 808 and rm1x that I use to drive outboard synths mainly. They are both a lot of fun and will do what you need. The 808 via CL was about 150$ and the rm1x from a pal was 100$. My favorite seq between the two is the rm1x. The midi delay on a dedicated knob is so fun. The sounds are dated but if you start layering them I still find some of them useful. Whats neat about the rm1x is its got a little touch of ableton scenes in the way you chain patterns. You can also reuse the patterns across different songs too. The 808 sounds sound better to my ears but I don't really like sequencing on it nearly as much. In fact I'm about to put the 808 on CL for the same 150 I paid for it. Newer stuff will probably make your workflow smoother. I never had trouble with either but I mostly would record the tracks to and from my DAW. I didnt really use the floppy to move midi files around. Good luck.

I can't vouch for the quality as I haven't tested it yet but it's a lot cheaper than the Novation Impulse and it meets your requirements.
synthesizers,3d82xg,Pashimp,2,Tue Jul 14 07:26:19 2015 UTC,"I'm in NZ, so my store options are a bit weird, wild fluctuations in price from say amazon too, so I don't really expect someone to go hunting for me, I just want to see what options I have.  for example the Novation SL MK2 is only $50 more on amazon, but it's about $60 more for the 25 key locally, and the 49 key doesn't even have a price.  I also mention the SL MK2 because its the most highly recomended keyboard on gearslutz.  And the rest of the advice I see is nothing but complaints, about the Korg Taktile, Arturia KeyLab, etc, maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places.  $300 is around about my price limit, so I figure why not have some extra features like pads / faders etc, that will no doubt come in useful in the future."
synthesizers,3d82xg,Pashimp,3,Tue Jul 14 08:48:52 2015 UTC,"Do you have any other hardware yet?  Do you know what music you're looking to make?  Do you use softsynths at the moment or does you earlier musical experiences lie with other instruments?  I'm asking because to me personally, while the there are enough pads and controls, 49 keys is a little to few. From what I gather you want something that you can keep and use in the future and rather than buying something that works for now but won't be enough once you really get the hang of things. If you're confident that 49 keys is going to be enough I'd say go for the Novation Impulse. It does seems to be gear towards a ableton live-ish kinda of setup though."

I know ZynAddSubFX like the back of my hand.  But I think the first option on my list is something from the Volca range most probably the keys."
synthesizers,3d82xg,Pashimp,2,Tue Jul 14 10:15:41 2015 UTC,Alright!  I'd say go for it. It seems to me like it suits your needs.  The only thing I can see that it's lacking is polyphonic aftertouch. I don't even use aftertouch at all that much but since you're looking for a master KB I thought that it'd best to mention that. I wouldn't care about that though. Polyphonic aftertouch is really very much an optional extra to me.

synthesizers,3d82xg,Chritet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:01:24 2015 UTC,I like that one more. The vector thingy instead of a big screen is a plus to me and no wasted space in the top corners.

synthesizers,3d6gsa,t0xicd0g,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:59:26 2015 UTC,"This isn't that odd though. 6/4 is no problem syncing with 4/4 as they are both quarter notes. The 6/4 is just adds two quarter notes of time to every bar making them sync up every three 4/4 bars rather than every bar.  As long a the sequencer isn't fixed at 16, 32, or 64 that is. :)  On the Volca (I assume this works on most xox-style sequencers) this can be done by inactivating the last 4 steps leaving you with 6/4 + 6/4 rather than four 4/4's. On a sequencer where you step through the notes it's a simple matter of entering a number of notes equal to a multiple of 6.  I agree with the point you where making though as OP needs more steps for this to work. Standalone sequencers tend to have better interfaces as well.  EDIT: /u/Man_of_Bowls is right. I though the bass row was another 4 bars making it a total of eight 6/4 bars with the occasional eight-note.  (I hope I got the terminology right, english isn't my primary language)"
synthesizers,3d6gsa,Pashimp,2,Tue Jul 14 06:50:18 2015 UTC,"It's odd enough that most built in sequencers can't handle it, which was my point :)"
synthesizers,3d6gsa,t0xicd0g,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:55:54 2015 UTC,I disagree about that though. there might be some sequencer that can't change the number of steps but I sure don't know of any. Both your Microbrute and the TR-8 can handle it just fine as should the Tetra. I cant' speak for the rest as I haven't looked to closely at them but my point is that saying that most can't handle it is a bit of a strech.
synthesizers,3d6gsa,Pashimp,2,Tue Jul 14 08:25:37 2015 UTC,"Built in sequencers are usually an extra, if you want a sequencer for prog, chances are you'll need a standalone sequencer. 6/4 might be OK on some sequencers, but what about 9/8? or two bars of 7/8 followed by one of 4/4 in a repeating pattern? Most onboard sequencers are fairly limited when it comes to more exotic time signatures, hell, a lot of standalone ones are, too. My Microbrute has a very basic sequencer that only has a 64 note memory, but nicely loops after the last input note, so it isn't really a step sequencer in that sense of the word, more just a note memory; the Tetra can reset the sequence at any point in it's 16 steps, but 16 or fewer steps is a short sequence, and it's not that easy to switch between sequences on the Tetra - it's really more for modulation purposes than making a whole track or anything more than a pattern on. My MS2000 is stuck with 16 notes or nothing, though it can run backwards and forwards through them like an up/down arp pattern."
synthesizers,3d6gsa,t0xicd0g,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:36:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing that one might not need a sequencer when time signatures get tricky or the sequences get long. I was arguing that 6/4 isn't one of those hairy time signatures and that the sequence in question was neither long nor complex enough to warrant a stand alone sequencer.  9/8 isn't that complicated either by the way. While it might be harder to play with your hands as you have to keep things synchronized manually a sequencer isn't really going to care. The Volca couldn't handle more than one bar but the Minibrute will without a problem. Two 7/8's and one 4/4 is really just 22/8 once you sequence it so it'll only take up just over a third of the available steps (the Volca Beats can handle this but your TR8 will). The point I was trying to make is that if it consist of quarter notes or a division of quarter notes you'll be fine as long a you have enough steps. Then there is the issue where you want notes longer or shorter than you base step but that isn't going to be a problem in OP's case as the Sub37 can do ties apparently.  Built in sequencer usually can't handle strange divisions though so if you replaced the 9/8 with 8/9 instead most likely would be screwed right away. Some can handle triplets but if it get more complicated than that you'd be out of luck most of the time. I'm not even sure if all modern software sequencers can do this. Fl Studio doesn't as far as I know, at least not very gracefully.  A standalone sequencer might be worth if for usability reasons alone though even if you do deal with sequence that you internal one can handle. I did in fact order a standalone sequencer just over a week ago so I see their value. I just don't think OP should buy one needlessly since they don't want to."

If you play straight eighth (not 8) notes in a measure of 6/4, you play 12 notes, so you play 48 notes over four measures. In order to account for the ties and quarter notes in your sequence, you can use the tie function (or latch) to make a quarter note from two eighth notes played in a row.   You might have to set the envelope to not reset if you play legato (less sure on this part)."

synthesizers,3d55j7,sd12hu,4,Mon Jul 13 22:33:32 2015 UTC,"The general consensus, as far as I can tell, on sites like Muffwiggler and the like, is that creating a drum machine as flexible or versatile as say an Analog Rytm or a Tempest in Eurorack is very very difficult. I can really vouch for the Tempest as far as any experimental drum sounds go. It's excellent for sound design too. If less run-of-the-mill drum sounds are what you're after I'd probably steer clear of the MFB stuff. While the Tanzbär sounds amazing and has a great sequencer, its sounds are still very much in the x0x domain. As far as synthesis goes the Tempest destroys everything else it's compared to. 6 voice polysynth with two analogue, 2 digital oscillators per voice, five (!!!) envelopes, two LFOs, an awesome modular-esque mod matrix... It sounds like it's very close to what you're looking for. I bought mine from Sound Devices for about AU$2250 late in 2011, so I imagine it could've gone down a bit so as to be in your budget. If not, I'd say it's worth the investment, and learning a bit about drum synthesis will keep you busy for a while, that's for sure!

The challenge isn't really so much in the drum synthesis--a modular synth is really good at synthesis!-- it's the trigger/pattern sequencing.   I've been able to get some interesting rhythmic results without a trigger sequencer. In that patch, I've got gates pinging Vactrols open for short, percussive beats. The intermittent/irregular ""Snare"" LFSR noise being intermittently gated by the random burst gate out of the Wogglebug. I think I ended up adding some more variation by modulating the phase of the Malekko oscillator's saw wave and running that into a comparator...the output may be triggering another percussive part elsewhere. (It's been long time since I had that patch running, ha).  Absent that, the only reason to go with a modular drum machine approach is to have access to interesting (but expensive!) trigger sequencer modules like the Trigger Riot which strikes me as the coolest trigger sequencer I've seen."

It's pretty high on my ""want to buy"" list. http://www.noiseengineering.us/basimilus-iteritas  If modular is a viable option for what you want to do really depends on what else you have and what you are trying to accomplish.

If you have the space and want a keyboard though, get the keyboard. A BS2 and a Blofeld would be a nice combination."
synthesizers,3d4rwg,bingaman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:22:26 2015 UTC,"A BS2 and a Blofeld would be a nice combination.   That's the problem. I have this image in my head of a near-perfect combo to keep for a long time, in which case the extra luxury of having only two boxes (+ interface) to deal with sounds lovely. Which, of course, is a dangerous thought as my expectations may be too high.   A question though: how do you play your modules? Do you have one master keyboard, set one box to play something and then switch between them?"
synthesizers,3d4rwg,bingaman,2,Tue Jul 14 22:09:44 2015 UTC,"I like sequencers because I don't really care if something sounds like a person ""played"" it. I like hooking up different things and using one instruments sequencer to control another one. I've had good results using the 303s sequencer for CV and I built a midibox for midi sequencing. But I probably shouldn't give advice because my studio is messed up right now and having too many synths is part of the problem. I think you can get a ton of mileage out of just the bs2 and the blofeld and you won't be hurting for sounds."
synthesizers,3d4rwg,quantumdylan,4,Wed Jul 15 00:32:51 2015 UTC,"I have the module myself, which rests right on top of my controller. You don't really lose anything in terms of controls thankfully, as the keyboard version only differs by having a keyboard attached to it.  Plus, if you really want to, with a midi controller you can map knobs and sliders to parameters on the blofeld. I find this nice for certain things, like quickly changing filter cutoff or resonance.  Long story short, the module is tiny enough to take anywhere and place anywhere. And midi controllers are pretty cheap. Good luck!"
synthesizers,3d4rwg,Pashimp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:18:27 2015 UTC,"this nice for certain things, like quickly changing filter cutoff or resonance.   Can't the knobs and/or modwheel do that anyway? Yes, I understand that they need to be used for several things, so they'd probably be mapped to other things while editing patches. But while actually playing, they can be used for whatever I want, right?    Good luck!   Thanks!"
synthesizers,3d4rwg,seqai,5,Tue Jul 14 22:05:31 2015 UTC,"I say no but this is really one of those things that are very personal. I don't want lots of keyboards since they demand space, something I don't have in unlimited quantities. If you have lots of space and dont mind moving about a little I suppose this is a non-issue.  It might be usable as a master keyboard (as long as local control can be set to off) but 49 keys is a bit weak for that purpose imo.  Further it depends on how you plan to use it. Do you play in a band setting? In that case I'd say the KB version is worth it. If you plan on sequencing mostly I'd skip the keyboard.  An advantage of the KB is that you always have access to the synth. A MIDI controller might be hooked up or routed to another instrument which can leave you unable to playinstantly when a melody or whatever pops up."
synthesizers,3d4rwg,seqai,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:27:32 2015 UTC,"If you plan on sequencing mostly I'd skip the keyboard.   That would either mean 1) more gear or 2) more DAW use. More gear, I suppose, is inevitable in the future, but not a specific plan. And I still don't like fiddling with the mouse to make stuff. Therefore, yes, I'd mostly be playing it.   Space is a good point, though I suppose it's difficult for me to truly understand the problem as I currently only have one synth. Another big keyboard is - again - inevitable, but it obviously doesn't necessarily have to be the Blofeld's integrated one."
synthesizers,3d4rwg,jepyang,3,Tue Jul 14 22:03:25 2015 UTC,"First of all it's important to notice that keyboard version comes with SL upgrade (it makes available use of samples, including user ones) which is sold for 100 euros for desktop version.  It's a good feature to have and I bought it for my desktop one. As there's no difference from sound programming point of view it's all about if you need SL upgrade and decent 49 keys keyboard with weighted action and aftertouch for actually 200 euro. If you gonna perform, I think it's a deal, unless you won't buy a full size midi controller of comparable quality in future but it will be much more expensive."

The sounds I've heard aren't too impressive. So currently I'm not basing my choice too much on that. How often do you find yourself using it?"
synthesizers,3d4rwg,t0xicd0g,2,Tue Jul 14 22:18:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not using it often, in fact I bought it about a month or two ago while I had Blofeld for a few years now. Certainly the synth is deep enough without an upgrade and main feature is sure about morphing wavetables. But I loved my Blofeld and wanted to have everything it offers, that was the primary reason to get an upgrade. Factory samples are cheesy (as factory presets on Blofeld) and transferring samples isn't super convenient but still ok. Then you can use anything from classic synth sounds to prepared piano records or sounds of nature as oscillator. It won't be a normal sampler, but as samples can be used in FM synthesis or ring-modulated some crazy stuff could be done. If you decide to buy a Desktop version you won't need it for quite a long time or even at all, but nevertheless it's a cool feature."

I've said it before, but the engine of the Blofeld is so deep that at the bottom there's James Cameron in a little submersible waving back at you. You can modulate almost everything with almost everything else. My only concern is that you might get lost and overwhelmed by the Blofeld due to this depth and the fairly simple interface. The interface is awesome if you know your way around a synth well; if you don't, you will likely spend a lot of time with the manual, scratching your head.  Other synths you may not have considered but which have a much more easy to learn interface that is very like your BS2; Alesis Ion, Novation Nova module, Novation KS 4/5, Roland SH201, Roland System 1, Korg Radias module.  To specifically answer your questions though, the module and a good controller is a perfectly fine way to go, the interface is pretty much identical between the controls. It is a really nice keybed, though, may be worth looking around for a used one, I've seen a few go on Ebay for between £300-350 lately."

I think a lot of people fall back on presets with the blofeld as there is a pretty major learning curve simply to wrap one's head around the possibilities, let alone to start really experimenting.   That's not to say great sounds can't be coaxed out of it fairly easily, but I'd definitely not consider it a beginner synth as it can easily become overwhelming. I literally drew out patches on paper when I was learning because I'd get lost in the menus & flipping back and forth to remember what I'd set what to got pretty tiresome.   That said, the physical keyboard is very nice, license SL is a nice bonus but by no means a necessity. I personally have the desktop due to space limitations & an abundance of other keys/controllers.   edit:Also... the arp on the blofeld is pretty damn incredible, could work very well with the BSII doing its bass thing and triggering the blofeld arp."

My only concern is that you might get lost and overwhelmed by the Blofeld due to this depth and the fairly simple interface.   That is both a concern and a hope. I feel like I handled the BSII well, considering that while a very well laid-out interface, it's not exactly a simple synth either. I'm hoping that the Blofeld, while much more complex and with a less obvious and less hands-on interface, will give me a similar experience: it'll be bloody difficult at first, but step by step, I'll get the hang of it.    Alesis Ion, Novation Nova module, Novation KS 4/5, Roland SH201, Roland System 1, Korg Radias module.   I actually did! The main problem with old synths is that Ebay is more or less the only choice I have. Local classifieds are rubbish beyond all belief. And either there's some clever trick to Ebay that I'm not clued in about or there's usually like one of the aforementioned synths on sale 75% of the time, they don't even post overseas, which is understandable with old and fragile synths.  I'm still hoping that someone I know has an old Polivoks in the attic they'd love to get rid of though...  Also, if I'm not mistaken, old synths have gone way up in price even in the last year. For example: I can't find a Nova module, but a Nova 2 (keyboard) is on offer for... €550 with shipping. That's Ultranova money. Similar deal with the KS 4/5: some were on sale for lots of money, but didn't ship overseas. Etc. I hadn't considered the System 1, but it doesn't seem to do enough. I did consider the Micron in lieu of the Ion (largely because, again, Ions seem to be in short supply and Microns seem to be far cheaper too), but its interface doesn't appeal to me at all. I'd still want more keys too. The SH-201 actually seems interesting, but again, dunno where I would find 'em. I'll have to keep an eye on ebay for a while."

I first started out with the Beats (I've always been a drummer first and foremost but I've owned a couple of midi keyboards and digital pianos in the past too, never before a synth however) and got the Keys shortly thereafter which was my first time learning the basic workings of a synth.  I quickly outgrew the Beats after purchasing the Volca Sample but then sold both and acquired the Analog Rytm on down payment. I still struggle with the idea of selling it from time to time.. but as soon as I fire it up and explore its numerous ways to shape and bend sounds I'm immediately hooked again.  Eventually got the MS2000B and Waldorf Blofeld Keyboard thereafter but ended up selling them in favor of the Brute. I have a feeling the Brute will fit my palette of sounds a lot better.  Will hopefully be picking up a Yamaha digital piano later this week as well to complete the setup.  (note: I'm putting up the Volca Keys for sale as I'm typing this)"

synthesizers,3d332a,the_cody,9,Mon Jul 13 03:22:50 2015 UTC,"I was around when FM was introduced, and one of my friends spent most of his high school savings on a DX7. So many late nights went peering into the small mailbox display, eventually resulting in quite a few useful sounds. The thing that was - and is - groundbreaking with FM is that it offers a much wider sonic palette than basic subtractive synthesis.  I know it's hard to fathom, but back then, the world was pretty fed up with subtractive (you all seen the ads for $50 TB-303's by now) and this was heralded as the next thing.   The key to FM is expression. Just by adding a little modulation to modulators (non-bottom level operators) such as velocity to their output makes the sound incredibly expressive. This is in my view partly why the non-velocity sensitive DX synths such as the DX21 eventually flopped - the sounds became stale and lifeless.  Start with a simple two-operator stack. Set the relative freqs to 1:1, 1:2 or 1:3 and pull up the modulator velocity until the sound starts to shift. Then add velocity or other modulation source on top.   Listen to how the different frequency relations affect the sound. How does 1:2 differ from 1:1? Slightly more clarinet? When you start to get a feeling for these things, you're already on your way to grasp FM and finally move away from harsh static, bells and bottles."
synthesizers,3d332a,Introvere,8,Mon Jul 13 13:14:42 2015 UTC,"What are some good tricks for using FM on the Blofeld? Or any basics, really... I haven't come up with any FM patches I like yet."
synthesizers,3d332a,BonjourMyFriends,9,Mon Jul 13 03:52:48 2015 UTC,"Subtlety is king. FM responds to heavy handed programming with metallic noise. To get any kind of musical sound from it, try setting the modulator and octave or three higher than carrier and set the envelopes to very low amounts to get subtly sizzling pads; up this to six or seven octaves above for more bell-like sounds.  Also, an oscillator that is sweeping through a wavetable makes a very interesting modulator!"
synthesizers,3d332a,t0xicd0g,3,Mon Jul 13 06:20:35 2015 UTC,"Think of FM as adding subtle overtones. Don't overdo it. Or do overdo it, if you know what sound/noise you want."
synthesizers,3d332a,EndOfTheDigitalAge,8,Mon Jul 13 11:22:18 2015 UTC,"I am growing to love FM more every time I sit down to program some. The palette is so very different to analogue and virtual analogue, and so very different to program. I don't understand why people restrict it to vaguely crappy electric piano sounds when it can do such a wonderful range of synthy electronic sounds!   I've had some fun results with the Blofeld, especially using a modulator that is sweeping a wavetable, that kind of movement is fascinating in an evolving pad or drone. The Z1 allows for the greatest control, however. You can control and modulate levels for almost everything, and arrange the oscillators almost as you please.   The King space however is reserved for when I eventually get myself an SY77. It will be mine. Oh yes. It will be mine. Until then, my best friend is lending me his DX7s so I can get some 6 operator practice in!"
synthesizers,3d332a,t0xicd0g,2,Mon Jul 13 06:30:59 2015 UTC,"I'm really appreciating the filters in Operator for creating some lush yet gritty bass and long-release drones with just enough low-pass to time some of the harsh edges.   Unfiltered FM is also great for creating some really powerful percussion sounds. Most percussion sounds are full of inharmonic partials, which are easy to create with FM."
synthesizers,3d332a,kirklandish,2,Wed Jul 15 13:42:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one of my favourite features of the Z1 is the sophisticated filter types you can use to pass the FM sounds through; a pair of dual bandpass filters is great for glassy, weird stuff, or even formant-sounding patches. Same with the Blofeld too, and even better, both synths have very different characters to the filter sounds; the Z1 tends to sound warmer and darker, while the Blofeld sounds brittle and crisp. I've run the DX7 through my Microbrute's filter a few times too, mainly for mono sounds and drones, MIDI syncing the envelopes, that sounds pretty awesome too. Takes the edge off the DX7's very gritty sound."

synthesizers,3d332a,kirklandish,2,Wed Jul 15 15:14:30 2015 UTC,The main drone under this is an FM patch with a modulator slowly drifting in and out of tune being passed through both dual bandpass filters with each cutoff being separately modulated.

I want a TG33 as well but that's a different beast entirely.  I saw someone built a perfectly good rack from an IKEA thing for cheap. If I built a rack I'd want a TG77 or FS1R, a Waldorf Micorwave (MK1), Prophet VS rack, and Emu Emax rack.  I don't know why I'm telling you all this. I'm just really tired and a bit strange groggy right now.  About FM: Each operator is a building block. In my way of looking at it each operator can be one of a few things: A coloration source, a transient modulator, or whatever. My biggest piece of advice is to familiarize yourself with how operators sound at different pitch ratios. Once you get those relationships you can begin to plan how you want your sound to evolve. The power of FM is effective usage of amp envelopes. That's why the Reface DX better have envelopes to control operator self-feedback.  The Reface DX isn't even multitimbral. In my opinion most gear that isn't multitimbral is already taking up too much real estate."

Admittedly I haven't played around with FM a ton, so I'm mainly curious to hear what other people have to say.  A lot of people are complaining that the new DX only has 4 sine-only operators. But what people aren't mentioning is that each operator has continuously variable feedback. Plus there's an effects section. Is this enough to make up for it being only 4-op?"
synthesizers,3d332a,KeytarVillain,2,Mon Jul 13 18:00:11 2015 UTC,"I think it does in some ways. Because each operator can become a square or saw without using other operators. Now, does the operator self-feedback have modulation envelopes? That would make a big difference.  Surely it will make sounds that no other Yamaha 4-OP FM synth has made. It's not the same as a DX7 but it surely will have a substantial and unique character of its own."
synthesizers,3d332a,Biopharmer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:51:12 2015 UTC,I would probably take a 4-op with multiple waveforms over a 6-op with sine only.

You know, all of those late eighties early nineties genesis twangs and bloops you got from sonic.  I've been using dexed and a mapped controller to quickly edit the parameters on my tx7, which works out amazingly.  Oh, and a rather odd thing I picked up. Got myself a Yamaha SHS-10 from craigslist, never have had a 2-op FM synth before. Such a cheesy little keyboard."

synthesizers,3d332a,Sabored,2,Thu Jul 16 05:46:02 2015 UTC,How do you get your TX-7 to respond to Dexed?  Does it respond to changes on Dexed live or do you make your patches in Dexed and upload them to your TX-7 from there?  I have a DX-7 and have been struggling to get it to work.  Any suggestions?
synthesizers,3d332a,winstonmyers,2,Mon Jul 13 12:50:23 2015 UTC,"Well, with dexed the first thing I do is create an init patch, and that gets sent. The parameter changes, however, are all done in real time. As long as the DX is accepting midi, dexed can change parameters in real time.  The only thing it doesn't do is change parameters when you load a new patch in dexed. To do that you have to manually send it."

It uses real FM, which is a different method than Yamaha's phase modulation, for example it does not allow for operator feedback. (6 op FM with variable waveforms kinda makes up for it). It has a tendency to sound lo-fi compared to the clean sound of a DX7II, at times you can hear some aliasing.   It has pretty powerful programming options, and it's a very easy build. Make sure to listen to demos to see if it's for you."

synthesizers,3d332a,t0xicd0g,3,Mon Jul 13 06:23:55 2015 UTC,"When I saw the details on the re-face, I went out and anger purchased a DX7IID that I found on craigslist.  It was in fantastic condition, although it was quite dirty.  I have two TX7's, a TX81Z, and now this DX7IID.  All of these combined cost me roughly the price of one brand new reface DX.  FM Synthesis fell out of favor a long time ago and the used market on DX's and TX's isn't great.  There are a lot of them out there because they were VERY popular in their time, but now the demand isn't too high.  The keybeds are good, and the sounds are very familiar.  The sounds are extremely sensitive to velocity changes, which makes them very fun to play.  When you play one, it's like opening a time machine from the mid 80s to early 90s, and that's why they are either liked or disliked.  I avoid programming from scratch, as it is a long process, especially on the hardware.  I have ~50,000 patches for them that I found on the internet.  Some of them are from rom carts that were sold long ago, and some of them were banks that people created and were shared in newsgroups.  It's impossible to manage that many patches so I have a few banks of favorites that I mostly work with.  If there's a specific sound I know I want, I have a spreadsheet that I keep so I know how to find it again.  I understand FM synthesis enough to know how to tweak a patch in a direction I want, but not enough to make sounds from scratch.    I use an Emagic Unitor 8 and SysEx Librarian for mac to transmit and receive SysEx to and from my FM synths.  I trigger them with Ableton Live.  As for 4op and 6op, I tend to use up my operators trying to make wave forms on my DX7 that already exist on other 4ops.  I think 4op is enough for most things.  There are some super crazy sounds that can only be done on 6op, but at the same time, having saw waves on a 4op gives you a lot more sonic possibilities.  One is not better than the other, they are simply different.  It's only a loss if it's 4op and there are no additional wave forms other than sine.  FM8 is great.  Operator is great.  Yamahas are great.  They're all different, but good in their own respect.  They all have their quirks and problems.  They all shine in areas that others don't."
synthesizers,3d332a,snaxe,3,Mon Jul 13 16:14:23 2015 UTC,"It's not talked about very often, but the Alesis Micron (and Ion and Akai Miniak, which are all more or less the same synthesizer with different chassis and slightly different features) has what amounts to ""3-operator"" FM on it. (The Micron is a 3-oscillator virtual-analog synth, but one that sounds very digital.) I've been playing with it a bit to learn some of the basic FM techniques and it really excels for interesting bass sounds. It does both linear and exponential algorithms and FM amounts can be routed to the effect knobs.  I'm on the fence about the Reface DX. I'm happy that Yamaha is resurrecting the DX, but I wish they'd taken it a little further. My hope is that it's a precursor to a bigger, better, more modern-sounding DX7II.  My question to any old-school DX owners: is Nick Batt from Sonicstate right about the old DXs being noisy? He mentioned that a few times in the interview with the Yamaha rep about it, and that kind of put the pause button on my wanting to go aftermarket-shopping for one.   [ This interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR47UZNwxlM ]  Edited for clarity."
synthesizers,3d332a,TheAnalogLights,3,Mon Jul 13 23:30:38 2015 UTC,"From my experience: The original brown DX7 is indeed noisy. It's not horrible, but it's there. It's also incredibly slow to program, and due to a misunderstanding of MIDI, velocity only goes to 100 (not 127 as per spec)  The DX7II fixed the noise issue, but introduced other problems. To my surprise, the membrane buttons of the old DX7 seems more reliable (contrary to at least what I would have thought) I owned a DX7II that developed button issues and later played another where one of the buttons simply did not register.   Also, I find the realtime control of modulator levels etc. on the Reface a big step forward. This was a big limitation with all the original DX's where you in principle could map AT, Breath, Mod Wheel, EG and/or velocity as modulation sources, and it was tricky to affect modulators individually in a more useful way."
synthesizers,3d332a,Introvere,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:11:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you! In light of that information, the Reface DX does sound more promising, mini keys aside. (And, hell, even those aren't that huge a dealbreaker.)"
synthesizers,3d332a,TheAnalogLights,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:34:58 2015 UTC,"Dealbreaker on the reface for me is 4 operators vs. DX7's 6. (edit: orignally I said 8). I just don't understand them bringing out stuff that's more limited than what we already had. I suppose I'll stick with FM8 ""in the box"" and for hardware my Studiologic Sledge does limited FM if I need to scratch my FM itch with real knobs."
synthesizers,3d332a,graspee,2,Thu Jul 16 01:32:08 2015 UTC,"I was also initially disappointed, but as they added saw and square waves to the operators (instead of sine as the original DX's) it actually may become the best tradeoff between sound palette and complexity to program. Many DX7 patches are created using two operators just to produce a square and saw, to modulate further."
synthesizers,3d332a,Introvere,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:09:10 2015 UTC,"Really don't understand FM particularly well, though I am making a point to read up on it. For the longest time subtractive synthesis was synthesis to me and I understand fairly well what different changes to parameters will do. FM seems a little more obscure.  Been experimenting with Operator and the (free) M4L essentials drum synths some of which use FM (and K-Plus!). I think FM is great for percussion and percussive sounds and general sonic crankiness. So far I prefer subtractive synthesis for smoother longoing release type sounds, but I will experiment."

synthesizers,3d1li7,nikofeyn,3,Sun Jul 12 22:57:26 2015 UTC,I think the new version is funkier.

Mine has so much inherent noise that even with both oscillators all the way down and the filter resonance at zero it still sounds like I've got the noise generator on
synthesizers,3d3o1v,exh78,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:19:05 2015 UTC,yeah I've heard of that happening!

synthesizers,3d3o1v,24Track,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:43:26 2015 UTC,"No if it was distorted then it would probly just be the signal level volume. There's just this fuzzy, low quality, grainy sound."
synthesizers,3d2jsa,CrispyLiberal,8,Mon Jul 13 00:33:53 2015 UTC,"TR-8, get the 7x7 expansion as well for an almost double amount of sounds. I love it and it does not compare to any of the lower priced drum machines out there. Its super easy to play, and has some really nice sounds. Check out the 7x7 demo. Hopefully, there will be more expansions coming as there is still plenty of space per instrument to choose from. It also has 4 outs, so you can assign some outs to a and b and put them through various effects. Get some crazy results.

synthesizers,3d2jsa,sixdust,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:21:25 2015 UTC,Can you do any kind of parameter locks with the TR-8? Especially programing the 808 kick to change pitch/play basslines?
synthesizers,3d2jsa,NeapolitanSix,2,Mon Jul 13 09:17:13 2015 UTC,"You can't automate the knobs on the TR8. You could use external devices to do it, though.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrGiOtaSZ04"
synthesizers,3d2jsa,mobjois,3,Mon Jul 13 11:22:23 2015 UTC,"TR8 is awesome if you love the 808 / 909 / 707 sounds (I do) and enjoy a very playable sequencer. ER1 is fab for weird percussive and metallic noises as well as a different palette of kick and snare sounds to the TR8. More in depth sequencer, too. The two actually complement each other well.   The Nord Drum / Drum 2 requires an external sequencer or controller to play but has a very wide and usable range of synthetic to almost electro-acoustic drum sounds that are different yet again to what the TR8 and ER1.  Roland R8 has a lot of sounds in board but is well worth looking at because of the humanising functions. It's still one of the only drum machines to my ears that can do fills like a real drummer. Some great expansion cards available full of 808 and 909 sounds, too.   MFB 522 is like a sawn-off 808 in tone, and the sequencer is a bit fiddly compared to the TR8 and ER1; an option if you absolutely must have analogue components making your sound.   For something cheap and basic but reeking of the eighties, there are also a raft of machines you can often find for under $200 like the Roland 505, Yamaha RX5/7, Korg DDD5. They're not always the easiest to program a rhythm on or navigate, but they do have that grungy lo-fi sampling thing going on for them."
synthesizers,3d2jsa,t0xicd0g,3,Mon Jul 13 06:40:37 2015 UTC,"Sinc you mentioned the old Electribe, I'm assuming used is an option. I would look at the Yamaha RY30, Roland R-8, and Boss DR-660, likely in that order. Granted, there are a good amount of kits to choose from, but not enough to be overwhelming."
synthesizers,3d2jsa,rodentdp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:25:22 2015 UTC,"Used is definitely an option. I had my eye on the R8, but the money they're going for makes no sense to me. For $400 I'd rather just get a used TR8.  I messed around with a DR660, I wasn't a big fan. I think I work better with step sequences that lay things out visually."
synthesizers,3d2jsa,t0xicd0g,5,Mon Jul 13 07:54:25 2015 UTC,"It's all about the sequencer on the R8, and it's also built like a tank. Trust me, if you want to get sloppy with your beats, the R8 is well worth the money!"
synthesizers,3d2jsa,Goom909,3,Mon Jul 13 08:20:34 2015 UTC,"MFB will soon release the successor to the 522, so it might well be worth waiting to see what they announce"

synthesizers,3d2jsa,cosmicgat,6,Mon Jul 13 07:39:12 2015 UTC,"I'd go with the TR-8. It covers so many bases given that price range, and it jams like no other."
synthesizers,3d2jsa,bingaman,2,Mon Jul 13 01:09:44 2015 UTC,you can get a dr-202 for 150 typically
synthesizers,3d2jsa,FieldsofBlue,2,Mon Jul 13 12:53:10 2015 UTC,"Waldorf Attack once it gets midi sync added will be one of my main goto drum machines and I have probably 8 other drum machines to choose from. You need an ipad, but the app itself is only $20. It's really a drum synth."
synthesizers,3d2jsa,baruni-kun,2,Mon Jul 13 14:39:18 2015 UTC,I would get the tr8 or the er1 mk2.

It'll be the MK1 version without sampling capabilities, it's got a few synthesis engines and can do rudimentary MIDI sequencing. You can get all sorts of crazy sounds out of it, it's a beast."
synthesizers,3d2jsa,cehmu,5,Tue Jul 14 17:28:56 2015 UTC,"Like most threads of this type, I'm guessing OP has already made his/her mind up about the TR8 and just wants people to confirm its a good choice.  So yeah. The TR8 is good. /endthread"

synthesizers,3d2jsa,some1inmydictionary,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:37:46 2015 UTC,jomox airbase 99.  it's proper analogue.  You need a sequencer for it though.
synthesizers,3d2jsa,throwawaydrummerr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:32:14 2015 UTC,Korg ESX1.
synthesizers,3d2jsa,throwawaydrumerrr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:10:43 2015 UTC,"I love my Yamaha RX-5. The depth of editing for the sounds (including pitch, bend, a many-stage envelope, and more) is awesomely detailed. It's got 24 pads, 12 voices. Individual volume slider and output for each voice. The pads aren't velocity sensitive, but it does take velocity info from sequencers / controllers. If you like NIN-type dark, crispy, powerful digital drum sounds, it's an absolute beast."
synthesizers,3d2jsa,502blues,-2,Mon Jul 13 20:50:59 2015 UTC,"Korg Volca beats - another obvious choice, but I'd rather invest          in a better piece of kit now and avoid the inevitable ""upgrade.""   For 500 dollars you are going to end up making an upgrade at some point.  You cannot get Quality cheaply.  Think about spending 1 to 2 grand if you don't want to upgrade.  tr-8 is a fun piece of kit but comes nowhere close to 808, 909 etc for those who've heard both.   Unless of course you don't plan on releasing music (properly).  Yes, yes, some fantastic music has been recorded into a ghetto blaster with kids toys and ends up perfect.  Your question was one of Quality though, and again, that is not cheap.  Message to everyone starting out with synths and/or modular, if you don't want to ""break the bank"" then figure out how to build your own instruments, modular, record acoustic sounds and sample the hell out of those with some additional processing.  If you don't want to spend money (a somewhat painful amount) this is not hobby for you (hardware music creation as opposed to comp. software exploration) and you will end up being disappointed when you hear the fullness and quality not to mention extra modulation controls that come with expensive electronics."

synthesizers,3d2b0f,Zombieskank,10,Sun Jul 12 23:18:20 2015 UTC,Summer NAMM's not really known for big announcements. The only relevant stuff I've seen aside from Yamaha are a few new effects units from Boss - a potentially swanky delay and a new reverb pedal.
synthesizers,3d2b0f,Leviathant,4,Mon Jul 13 01:12:16 2015 UTC,Poor man's Timeline? I'm interested.
synthesizers,3d2b0f,slujj-vohaul,4,Mon Jul 13 02:00:09 2015 UTC,"Besides the Boss and Yamaha offerings, there were yet more midi controllers from Nukai, and probably most exciting is the return of the Auratone. Summer NAMM is usually pretty dull for synthesists."
synthesizers,3d2nbq,ScrubNickle,9,Mon Jul 13 01:04:28 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with it-it's your money, as long as you aren't neglecting your financial responsibilities you can do what you like. That said, it can often be more exciting to lust for gear than to actually get it, since once you get it you need to put in the work to learn how to use it. Personally, I start to feel guilty when I start looking around my studio and see gear I've never really used or bothered to learn. I'm also pretty anti-consumerist outside of musical equipment, so I'm sure that's a factor, but I feel like I'm neglecting my kids or something if I don't use the gear I buy."

Also, when you talk about the Rhodes, you might want to refer generally to electromechanical pianos generally--Rhodes, Wurlitzer (hammer strikes metal tine/reed), CP-70 (electrified piano with pickups), Clavinet. Most folks just talk about these things as ""keyboards,"" but fail to understand how different they are from each other in how they make sound & how they're played.  You might want to order the episodes in a way to enable your listeners to build a bit. So you can start with the notion that an electronic device can make sound: the Theremin. Then you can talk a bit about how you shape that sound: Moog Modular. That will lead you into a way of talking about control.

synthesizers,3cz9ac,workaccountoftoday,5,Sun Jul 12 03:20:10 2015 UTC,"Does touching the pitch bend control bring it back in tune?   Sometimes the spring wears out and it goes off center, causing a continuous detune effect."
synthesizers,3cz9ac,shroom_throwaway9722,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:40:31 2015 UTC,"Just touching it?  That doesn't seem to be the issue.  Though this morning it was tuned the opposite way.  Except I apparently left it on all last night, and my laptop was sitting on the spot where the PG200 goes, so the board was probably a bit toastier than usual.  Maybe the laptop was causing the problem.  I'll definitely see."
synthesizers,3cz9ac,termites2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:12:52 2015 UTC,"Try changing the pitch bend range, and see if the pitch of a played note changes (while not touching the pitch bender). This might help to show if the pitch bender if offsetting the pitch.  Also, if you haven't done so already, get the service manual and follow the alignment procedure for master pitch and pitch bender."
synthesizers,3cz9ac,nomelonnolemon,2,Sun Jul 12 17:27:47 2015 UTC,Well there is a fine tuning knob on the back. and once the transpose I don't see why it would change.   One thing to keep in mind is the way the octave harmonies are set is that some setting will sound lower overall than others. I find you can't just label a note say c3 and it will sound like that note in that octave in all settings. Personally I love the 3p but it has a lot of quirks and personality to work with.
synthesizers,3cz9ac,nomelonnolemon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:07:39 2015 UTC,I guess I didn't describe this well enough but the fine tuning knob just did not seem to change the tune enough to correct this.  Giving this more thought though I realized that I've been sitting my laptop on the spot where the PG200 usually goes... This may not be the best idea since that's where all the warm shit is in side the keyboard.  I'm going to see how it works once I don't have the laptop sitting there.
synthesizers,3cz9ac,nomelonnolemon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:11:51 2015 UTC,Have you plugged the unit into a tuner to get an accurate pitch measurement?  Also most settings have the chorus or mod function set so turn those off or use a setting that doesn't have one or the tuner won't be accurate
synthesizers,3cz9ac,nomelonnolemon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:32:44 2015 UTC,"I guess I just bombed at explaining what I've done.  I opened it up and tuned it with a tuner the other day, and it was in tune.  Since then, it's gone out of tune from opening it."
synthesizers,3cz9ac,trivorak,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:45:55 2015 UTC,Ok. So since than have you ran it into a tuner to see what it's doing?
synthesizers,3cz9ac,t0xicd0g,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:47:54 2015 UTC,"Well it was in tune, and now it's drifted down out of tune by a half step.  It's in tune again if I just transpose the keys half a step up."
synthesizers,3cz9ac,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:50:21 2015 UTC,So a perfect note down? and when you reset it the key is back to a 1/2 step off?
synthesizers,3cz9ac,t0xicd0g,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Granted, I can't guarantee it's perfect.  I'm literally shit with theory, so here I'll make it as clear as I can to help.  Right now when I turn it on, I hit the C key and it plays B.  Transpose to C# and it's fine.  Though I do realize now this IS different from when I got it.  Originally, hitting C played C# at first.  So... as it is, this isn't nearly as bad since hitting the transpose to C# puts it in its regular tuning."
synthesizers,3cz9ac,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:42:12 2015 UTC,is it just going out of tune because it's an analog voice. Most analog synths have to be tuned after about 30 minutes of warm up time. I'm just guessing here.
synthesizers,3cz9ac,t0xicd0g,6,Sun Jul 12 07:24:34 2015 UTC,"No, the JX range used DCOs that don't drift. It should be solidly in tune from the second you switch it on."

As others have said message the seller first and try and work something out with them, and if they refuse to budge file through paypal and you'll get your money back.  edit: also remember you're buying an old piece of gear. stuff could have been damaged during shipping getting jostled around, or it could have just been a ticking timebomb waiting to go off and unfortunately it was after you bought it.

Realistically, I'd think it is just the power supply.  However, depending on how it chose to die, it could have taken everything else out with it.  It's worth checking out whether or not you get a refund.  You'll probably want to open it up and take pictures of the insides to show the seller as well."

synthesizers,3cymr4,magikroom,3,Sun Jul 12 03:18:41 2015 UTC,"Update: The seller responded with this  Yeah no worries - that is the power supply I was sold the synth with. I used the synth with that power supply many times with no problems. Really have no idea what the issue is and again - as you saw - I spent about $40 having that synth ""professionally packed"" by fedex so the shipping really should not have negatively impacted the integrity of the unit.   I see you've requested a refund? Not sure what to say there as the unit was not sold with refunds as an option. I totally trust that you are having the issues you are reporting but I cannot take responsibility for what happens with the unit once its out of my hands - and I'm 100% sure I sent you a well packed fully functioning unit - which matches the description of the item you purchased.   I really hope it's just the power supply and easy to fix. If that's all it is I'm happy to send you the cash for the power adapter if you send me the receipt.   The guy is really nice and I understand it says no refunds, but there should be something in place if internal hardware is screwed that fast.

synthesizers,3cyaxc,hobbbz,5,Sat Jul 11 23:43:45 2015 UTC,I would also like to hear what is sounds like with the tr8. Especially the swing and random note features.
synthesizers,3cyaxc,Biopharmer,6,Sat Jul 11 22:40:50 2015 UTC,"Sure.  I can tell you that it was Plug and Play straight out of the box. I just connected it to the TR8 and it worked instantly. I just fooled with it for a few minutes, but the Swing and Random appear to work fine.  I can tell you that the velocity sequencing from the Beatstep Pro allows for more detailed programming than the TR8's ""Accent"" feature."

I think it's a much more expressive machine when externally sequenced, just like the originals. A lot of big producers in the 90's didn't even bother with the TR-909's sequencer.

synthesizers,3cyaxc,OhYesTheyFloat,2,Sun Jul 12 06:27:39 2015 UTC,It's honestly the best gear purchase I've made in a while. Very few instruments grab you the way the TR8 does out of the box.

In ableton could I have sequencer 1 controlling one vst, seq 2 controlling another then the drum seq controlling a drum rack?  Can the sequencers be set to different settings? So could seq 1 be on 1/4 and seq 2 on 1/8 or is that global?  Hooked it up to any volcas yet?"
synthesizers,3cyaxc,MachineFunk,2,Sun Jul 12 09:11:09 2015 UTC,"It is fun, but I am still getting the hang of it.    Yes, that is very simple.

synthesizers,3cx7g5,Synthhead44,3,Sat Jul 11 16:00:50 2015 UTC,"So, I modified and re-housed my Boss ODB-3 Overdrive pedal for better I/O options with my setup. Effectively i've just turned a guitar pedal into an FX module with 1/8"" and 1/4"" ins and outs.   The new enclosure is a metal box from a set of drill bits, which i cleaned up, drilled and spray painted.     The First thing i did was remove the momentary switch from the original circuit, and soldered it together in the 'on' position, so there is no bypass-Effect switching anymore, only effect. Then i added an 'on-off' switch to one of the wires of the battery clip, and bridged the 'input' jack so that the pedal wouldn't need a TR cable plugged in to draw power/""complete the circuit"" anymore.(like on most boss pedals) Now it just turns on and off with a switch.   Next i added 1/8"" jack sockets, in addition to the 1/4"" input and output jacks, So i have my choice of either for my I/O. The other benefit of the 2 inputs, is that when using the 1/8"" input jack, the 1/4"" input jack can be used as a Dry out/Bypass,(or vice versa) which doesn't go through the circuit.   Lastly i switched out the original LED for a nice Green one, to match my paint job.  I'm still getting the parts together at the moment so that i can do the Wampler mods on it and actually change the sound of the pedal, but i'm pretty happy with it for now.  I had said i would put a video up of my last mod (Boss SYB5) but didnt get around to it, so i might put together a video of the two of them in action over the next week or so."

synthesizers,3cx7g5,Poopenheimer321,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:33:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude. Yea, the I/O location is the main reason for the rehousing, having things patch in on the front panel just makes everything so much neater.   I'm hoping to make a small extension/breakout box for my Monotribe soon with MIDI in and out, as well as all of the existing I/O, plus individual drum outs, all mounted topside too.  I'm still quite new to electronics, and so i'm working my way through lots of cheap gear to mod, before i take on my monotribe or V.keys. Eventually i'm aiming to do some of the mods on my MS20mini, but not for a while, i couldn't risk making a mess of it.  I have the resistors and diodes i need for the wampler mods on my ODB, i just need the right Caps and i'm good to go.  What distortion pedal do you have?"
synthesizers,3cx7g5,sixdust,2,Sat Jul 11 16:58:01 2015 UTC,Just your classic boss ds-1 distortion. I found a kit on amazon  with a guide and parts included. The sound has been greatly improved but it's in the same casing which is not so bad but I love the top access Jacks.
synthesizers,3cx7g5,Poopenheimer321,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, i've seen a few mods around for the DS-1 too, i asked a friend of mine if he wanted me to have a look at his one, but it turns out he only sold it last week. he has way too many distortion pedals anyway, he's more of a guitarist than a synth player.  I'm looking forward to getting the ODB sounding better now too. It's like the stock ds-1, it's quite harsh, though i do prefer the way it sounds with synths rather than with the bass guitar as is. I think it will sound even better with the mids reduced."
synthesizers,3cx7g5,sixdust,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:22:29 2015 UTC,For sure. I noticed immediately the sort of crunch of the effect was smoother and the overall resonance was better. Boss makes solid designs with cheap cheap parts. All the better for modding!

synthesizers,3cx7g5,sixdust,2,Sun Jul 12 13:04:16 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a good idea to have the 2 inputs and 2 outputs each in series. Does that even work? Do you mean parallel?
synthesizers,3cx7g5,Arxhon,2,Sat Jul 11 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"haha, sorry yea you're dead right, they are in parallel. I must not have been thinking clearly when i wrote the description.  Is there any reason i shouldn't have them like this? like i said, i'm quite new to electronics, so please correct me if i've done something you think i shouldn't.  It all works perfectly anyway from what i can tell. I did test all the I/O jacks and everything before soldering them up and it didn't/doesn't seem to affect the circuits performance."

synthesizers,3cxpot,lmmortal_Beings,7,Sat Jul 11 18:41:11 2015 UTC,"If nothing else, it is an inspirational tool for me.   I take it to the couch, play with it using headphones, go batshit crazy with motion sequencing. And when i got a sound i like, inspiration suddenly kicks in and i rush to my room to include other gears i have.   It is almost always the same. I grab it to play a few minutes, and suddenly it has been 3 hours. Easily my favourite volca because of this.   Other than experimenting new sounds, i only use it as a drum machine. A very basic drum machine.   Sample transfer is not a hassle at all. You dont have to use mobile apps. There is a web app that you can put all samples in a zip and it gives you a waw file, then you play that file into volca's sync in port and you are good to go.   The real frustrating part is the limitations. You can put a maximum of 100 samples, and total size of those samples can't exceed 4 megabytes. So if you want to put some vocals for example, you mostly have to lower the quality to fit it in. And its maximum quality is 16 bits and 32 khz iirc. Thats why i just use it as a drum machine.  Also when you save a motion sequenced music in memory, it is saved with motion sequences but when you reopen it, you can no longer turn of or edit motion sequences. You can just add new motion sequences on top of it.   The speakers are just garbage. But kinda cool?  Overall im very happy with it but i don't use it for serious music production. It is just a great tool to experiment with."

synthesizers,3cxpot,t0xicd0g,4,Sun Jul 12 14:54:10 2015 UTC,"The Volca Sample is a great idea for its brilliant tools for real-time sample mangling and filtering (the analogue isolator is so much fun to play with) but it's marred by a couple of niggling annoyances. Firstly, rather than give it a USB port for easy transfer of samples, you have to rely on phone apps to pipe sample data into an audio socket old school, like we did in the eighties with computer programs and patch dumps. Second issue is that each sample has a it's own fixed MIDI channel - meaning that it eats 10 MIDI channels from your setup before you even factor in anything else you might want to sequence.   I think that in conjunction with the other Volcas it's great fun and works out just fine - it's a better drum machine IMO than the Beats, especially if you load in some really good samples. I just think that when using it with a more MIDIfied setup the shortcomings (especially the MIDI one) become a bit more glaring."
synthesizers,3cxpot,t0xicd0g,2,Sat Jul 11 19:57:52 2015 UTC,"Ya i read about the midi thing, definitely a weird choice by Korg, especially since, in my understanding,  the Beats only needs one channel.  But since i plan on using its internal sequencer this shouldn't be a problem (at least for now).  A bigger problem will be only having 16 steps i think.  How do you find switching patterns on the fly?    The sample transfer will be an issue i can't avoid though. Does the transfering take longer than the actual length of the sample? What i mean is that, if it were able to actually sample would it be faster to just sample than to transfer?   Man, how much space would a mini usb have taken."
synthesizers,3cxpot,SciFiEnnui,3,Sat Jul 11 20:51:12 2015 UTC,"I've only played with one of a friends', he says that sample downloading is a hassle, but he counts the fact that he can set all the things like trimming and loop length perfectly in a computer, most of the usual hassle of hardware sampling isn't there, so I guess it's an offset. I never used the sequencer on my Volcas, I got so bored of 16 steps very very quickly, and only having 10 pattern memories to store to doesn't make for many varied performances. I used to sequence my Bass and Keys from Cubase or through the MPC1000 to make them 'proper' synths!"

Live sampling works great, but trying to load a full sample library requires a card reader (for cards no longer available...), careful naming of samples (00, 01, 02...) etc.   Even after all this, trying to do a full same dump ended up deleting all my samples, which was sad.   The ES-1 is fun, so I probably won't sell it, but I'll probably pick up a used Sample off CL since it's cheap, portable and immediate."

synthesizers,3cybar,THE_SAUCE_OF_LEGENDS,9,Sat Jul 11 21:50:55 2015 UTC,"The Pro One really isn't that different in sound to the Prophet 08, you know. The filters are a little different, but clearly in the same sonic territory. It was how close it was to the sound of the Pro One (which I used for about ten years back in the nineties and early noughties) that made me get a Tetra. The big difference is VCOs instead of DCOs, but this just means phasing issues in practice. Having the oscillators start to drift and beat in the middle of recording a bassline really robs the bass of it's power. Given the choice now, both me and the mate who owned the Pro One would gladly have the Tetra/Mopho/Prophet 08 architecture because it can do anything the Pro One can do, and do a very convincing imitation of it too.   The Junos sound pretty, but they really don't have a very broad palette of sounds. They are very simplistic synths and sound horribly thin without the chorus. Bit if you have to have those handful of Juno sounds, then that's what you have to go for!"

Poly vs Mono architecture is slightly off when getting into Bass territory (which is why I thought I needed a Voyager). You can get close by using Unison to make nice Mono sounds with the 08, but there is something about the sonic aspects of the Pro One that really speak to me. Something that came close to the sound in my opinion, was a Oberheim SEM Pro, but even then, it still wasn't the SCI sound that I really seem to like.  As far as the Juno sound, you're also right. It's completely basic, which is one of the reasons why I'm conflicted about spending $1,000+ to get that exact sound. Something about it really gets me going though, and has me convinced that having those sounds would make me quite happy."

I'm perhaps less specific about the sound, and the Tetra is perfectly ballpark-y for me with regards to the Pro One sound - I could never justify spending a grand on a machine that was only very slightly different, but everyone's needs and tolerances are unique and that's what makes our music so different!"

If you stick to vintage, and aren't too impatient, you can get pretty much the same price back you paid for them.  I don't know much about prices in the US market, but here in Europe you should be able to come out of this on top. A Voyager nets about €2200-€2500. A Pro One should be about €900. A Juno 60 is about €1200.  I do want to warn you about the Juno. It's a great synth, but its sound palette is severely limited.

I'd recommend, as always, the New York School of Synthesis videos on Youtube, they really do give you synthesis 101 and you'll know your way around an analogue or virtual analogue architecture much better and be able to work out how to find those warm sounds you want.  Some hints though; typically, warm, soft sounds tend to have relatively small amounts of filter EG, slowish attacks on the VCA and VCF, not huge amounts of resonance, fairly low cutoff frequency, slow decay / release, and you can add extra fuzziness by slightly detuning the oscillators so that they slowly 'beat' against one another, or by running the whole thing through a chorus for some shimmer."

Changing position, standing, and physical movement are good for your health and for creativity. At least that's what I'll try to do when I move into a new studio in a few months. I'm thinking I'll have a groovebox table, a modular table, a DAW/recording plus controller corner and a guitar corner. I'll bring equipment together only when I actually need it to be closer as in I need to operate multiple items at once or in quick succession, which is not that often. I have found the search for the ultimate studio setup to be a fool's errand. YMMV of course."
synthesizers,3cvlp4,gcheliotis,4,Sat Jul 11 05:19:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to a point, but if everything is so disorganized that it takes 5-10 minutes to plug in and set up a piece of equipment it is real easy to lose inspiration. Really a problem in small studios where you may have to juggle equipment to plug things in and deal with cable routing issues. To your point though I do find that spending an inordinate amount of time pre-wiring everything to make it looks pretty always ends up a disappointment because inevitably you want to use two or three distinct pieces of hardware together that are across the studio from each other, creating actually more work to change the setup."

It has a different method for writing sequences than the SQ-1 and besides the extra patch points on the SQ-1 I believe it's still a more basic sequencer. If you're just looking for a simple straight forward sequence the Microbrute can already handle that on it's own.
synthesizers,3cvj6n,destroyosaurusrex,3,Sat Jul 11 14:11:07 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about the SQ-1 as opposed to the sequencer on the Microbrute is that you can program an 8-step sequence and use the other track to vary the gate length of each step. Especially useful if you have the envelope controlling the filter.   On the other hand, the Microbrute sequencer makes it a lot easier to work odd-length patterns into your composition. (The SQ-1 can do this too, by changing the number of active steps--the feel is just different)."

synthesizers,3cuj7l,dhjdhj,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:38:35 2015 UTC,Actually the problem I ran into with the Roland is not accidental triggering but rather insufficient movement such that when you do push hard enough to trigger aftertouch there is very little difference in distance between 0 and 127 so it's pretty much impossible to have any decent control over the amount of aftertouch

It would require a lot of touchscreen estate. But anyway, you would set a mode, tap in a rhythm, and ""draw"" your melody as a continuous graph with your finger. Every rhythm tap would ""sample"" the graph, and the mode controls would quantize it to a certain scale. That way, you could easily make variations on melodies in three separate ways:   Change the mode/key Change the rhythm Change the melodic shape   By editing only one of these things at a time, you could easily end up with a large number of melodic loops and snippets that would naturally work well with each other.  Anyways, for a more traditional thing: what about knobs for FM? I mean, with 4 rows of knobs and a touch matrix, a 4-op FM synth would be fairly feasible in hardware.

Also, for synths that have presets, the old style bank and number 1-8 buttons. If I want a specific patch on my OB-8 it takes me 2 seconds. On the prophet 12 it can take 30 seconds or longer. Direct access to the sounds is pretty important. Turning a data encoder is just not a quick and fun way to do it. It's exactly why I'll use the OB-8 instead of the P12 that is right in front of me."

A joystick or pad that allows the preset patches to be assigned to the four poles.  (E.g., vector synthesis.)  An assignable touch-strip for pitch, filter cutoff, stereo pan, amplitude, etc.  (E.g., Yamaha DJX or Yamaha CS-80.)  Audio input(s) that allow external audio to be mixed in with the synth's output.  Audio input(s) that allow for the incoming signal to be run through the synth's effects and/or filter section.  Trigger buttons that you can assign chord voicings to.  Preferably velocity-sensitive.  (Example:  Korg KARMA, et al).  An ""idea pad"" line on Ensoniq's MR61.  It's essentially a continually-running sequencer that captures everything you play.  The ""ideas"" can be accessed later and are enumerated sequentially based on when you change preset sounds or pause for 2 seconds or more.  Delta Quantization.  In short, the CPU looks at your freely-played sequence and guesses where the equidistant pulses (i.e., quarter-notes/crochets) would be.  It then quantizes based on this interpolation.  (Gawd, i hope that makes sense! :)  Again, my Ensoniq MR61 does this and i believe their ASR-X did/does as well.  It's really cool to lay down an idea without any click track and then be able to quantize and drop into a song/sequence.

I would suggest investigating the Patch Select Buttons, which allow you to switch between (4) combinations of the (6) waves at the press of a button or pedal.   You can double stack sounds easily by double clicking, and can stack (3) sounds at once into a Performance preset. The effects are pretty amazing. If you load a sample, the OS boots turning it into an ASR-10 - crazy!  It's a very cool machine for it's time."

synthesizers,3cugkv,pappaskamt,2,Fri Jul 10 21:41:53 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, the push doesn't have an actual midi out, so you would need a way to get midi from your computer to the Blofeld. Luckily the Blofeld has USB midi in.   Additionally, you're probably going to want to get an audio interface at some point to record your Blofeld with(it has midi over USB but not audio) and if you do most interfaces have midi in and out built in so you could use that."

synthesizers,3cugkv,Vcent,3,Fri Jul 10 22:15:41 2015 UTC,"Yes. And no.  Yes: because the quality of the audio is likely to be a lot better with a dedicated audio interface. The built in one is basically for gaming/and/or Skype, not for recording musical instruments in decent quality.   No: because you could just plug your audio out directly into your computer's line in(will likely need a 2x 6.3mm mono to 1x 3.5mm stero jack cable for this), and capture the sound trough the onboard interface. Start with very low volume on the blofeld, depending on how ""hot"" the output is, it could destroy your built in audio interface. (This is mostly a theoretical problem, unless you start getting in to modular synths, now there's some hot levels going on!)"
synthesizers,3cugkv,cherubthrowaway,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:32:32 2015 UTC,"Nope, you should be able to use the Blofeld as is, the only reason I mentioned using old school midi over USB midi is USB midi on some older gear can be kind of kind of glitchy. We'd have to get somebody in here who has used it on the Blofeld specifically to comment.  Also you may already know this, but midi and audio are separate, midi doesn't send any audio it's basically just digital sheet music that tells your gear which notes to play.   So the signal chain for midi would be push -> ableton ->Blofeld.  And audio would just be a couple audio cables going into your computer from the Blofeld. You said built in interface, so you probably need a cable with two mono 1/4 in on one end and one stereo 1/8 in on the other."

A lot of patches play with the amp velocity, so set it to 0 and you'll have a louder patch. It was driving me nuts for awhile. Also before you edit a patch, find one you don't like that way you can save over that one. I started at the every end of bank H, since they were drum sounds. Lots of good patches as a starting point so I would be careful of what to overwrite. I usually just give it the same name, but add !!! at the end, since ! is the first character to name the patch. Then anything with !!! at the end, I don't overwrite."

I have my own ideas for the ideal FM interface but given that this is just a little keyboard, it seems to be pretty good.  I'm going to hold off though, until a price drop or until they release a bigger version.  Nick from Sonic State seemed to indicate that there would be different versions, so a small module or full keys would be ideal.  My fear in these situations is that the company will release something we all kind of like but with one or two deal breakers (like mini keys for me) and they'll get cold feet about making more, when in reality it would be a big hit if they just changed it up a little.  But I imagine a ton of the cost for something like this is R&D so maybe theyll be able to keep the same sound engine and just adapt an interface or expand on it for 6 operators."

Thay psych rock feel is still embedded in their songs, but it's less in the forefront.  The biggest difference, and what seems to be most controversial amongst their fan base, is that this album is a lot more synth-heavy, and the guitar is more low-key throughout the album. I've got no problem with that! Kevin Parker also really stepped up his vocal game, they are a lot more demanding and really carry the record."

Managed to get most of the keyboard repaired, still waiting for some contact rubbers to save the upper octave.  I owned a PolySix before, but lost it due to long term storage and Leaky Battery Death. Playing one again, I must say it's one of the best deals where it comes to vintage synths in its price class. Even though it only has a single oscilator, it has the capacity of sounding massive.  Thought about ordering KiwiSix board for it, but there's already a MIDI kit in this one, and the extra patch storage doesn't really interest me that much, so I think I'll skip."

I may post a video of it in action one of these days.  It also has latching and momentary touchpads.

As for the Reface line, I can see what they were going for with the DX & CS and I think they're okay (not a huge fan of the interface, but the size and sound make up for it a bit), but I really don't like the YC. From the demos I've heard, it sounds really cheap and ugly. I guess if you want the stylized, synth organ sound it's okay, but you can instantly tell it's an imitation, and a pretty poor one at that.  I dunno, like other people have said, I think and MIDI controller plus a vst would serve you much better than the YC. The CP isn't much better."

Anyway, as surprising as this might be, the Odyssey has not yet arrived and the money remains well out of my bank account. I know, right?  ANYwhoooo... the Yamaha CS-15 did show up, earlier than expected even! And with more Pocky!! Japanese eBay sellers are the BEST!   https://flic.kr/p/vP6ccF  It has a TON more features than the CS-10 and sounds fantastic. It's very cool to have 2 separate filters but still, it's no MS-20. These smaller yamaha synths have a very thin sound that is fairly unique. Not a lot different from other synths, just... thinner. BUT, that's not necessarily a negative since thinner sounds actually work better in a mix when you have a lot of other sounds.   Also the modulation depth is definitely not up to par with other synths. The CS-10 is really bad and you can only apply the LFO enough to create a mild vibrato. I remembered it being a lot better on the cs-15, and it is... but only about twice as much. When applying sample and hold to the filter or pitch you don't get anywhere near the range you get with other instruments. Still though, lots of cool features like an auto-bend that bends up to or down to each note as you play. Envelopes are not as snappy as the CS-10.  I also tried the Korg SQ-1 sequencer with the CS-10 this week and it works perfectly when set to hz/V.  I am doing a demo song using the CS-10 and 15 and hopefully will be posting it soon.  Also, regarding ReFace, not interested. Yes, I already have a lot of CS synths and a DX-7IId but still, I'll wait until they have bigger versions with more of a front panel.

So, I mean, good on Yamaha for trying, but really given the mass amounts of alternatives and the absurdly high price of these units, I think we should just let Korg take over the modern vintage market.

If you're in the US, I quite recommend Monoprice for cabling on the cheap...but something tells me you are in the UK.

I don't know if the rack attack was like that but it's MIDI implementation must have been better. The thing is, the ipad app does sound really, really good. It definitely has the waldorf DNA, it just needs a little more time. I would love a more physical interface for it but the lacking MIDI implementation makes that not even possible to start on.

I'm thinking of getting the taktile as a rompler/controller and use the faders to control the Octatrack and eventually maybe get a desktop and use it to control it too.  The taktile lacks aftertouch, which is its one con, but those buttons and faders look like they'd make access OT features much easier while I'm playing.

Sure, I could mute parts on the Sample, but what if I just wanted to have a few drum samples seqeunced by the Electribe, while having the remaining sounds loaded up and available for me to trigger manually from the Volca front panel, or even it's own internal sequencer?"

You could turn down the volume on the Sample parts you aren't using. Using your example, you could have 1-5 dedicated to controlling the Sample and then 6-16 for the Electribe. Just turn the level down on parts 6-10 on the Sample. Using the external sequencer on a part would mean that you couldn't use the Electribe part though.   The MIDIbro is awesome.

You could try a PedalTrain Volto which has a 9V DC output suitable for powering effects pedals and the like, that should work for the KP3, but you have another problem with the Micron, which is that it requires AC input, not DC.  You COULD get a pure-sine-wave inverter and enough battery stack to run it, and then plug the Micron into it with its original wall-wart..  At that point, you may also consider just using a different keyboard that's easier to power, and leaving the Micron for when you have access to mains power.  (Nothing against the Micron, it sounds fantastic).  If the OP-1 floats your boat, it can run for a long time off its internal battery.  If a bigger more ""conventional"" subtractive style synth is more your thing, I know the MicroKorgs can run from batteries.

I don't believe the SBX80 is capable of doing this conversion; rather, it would convert MIDI to a trigger pulse. If this is what you want to do (i.e., have a MIDI master clock that runs both your drum machines and your synths), then you have a lot of options."

The Prophet 12 is one of the most powerful synthesiser engines on the planet; a true digital/analogue hybrid that really harnesses a lot of the potential of such a marriage. Trent Reznor used it a LOT on the Hesitation Marks NIN album. The 6 is a simple beast that is really just a slightly more sophisticated update on the Prophet 5, designed, I think, to appease the 'analogue only' crowd. It lacks much of the depth and modulation complexity of the 12, as well as the more interesting digital waveforms."

synthesizers,3crqo6,Pashimp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:51:55 2015 UTC,"I don't have much experience with other poly synths, but say on the 12 you have a layered patch and play a four note chord with a long attack and release. Then play another four note chords before the release has ended on the previous chord, the one extra note overlaping is then triggered instantly as if there was no attack even if there was a long attack. I've never really had much of a problem with it, maybe some other people do. You just have to keep check of how many notes your playing at once. Only really an issue if your using layered patches, you can either play big chords with a short release or three note chords with longer release. hopefully that made some sense."

I'm very biased and would recommend the P12 pretty much everytime but if you already have a Virus I guess you might not need the P12 as well.  I cannot record a sample right now but the P12 does bass well. You're not going to get Moog stuff from it obviously since it has a different filter but you do have a ton of other tools for shaping the bass sound. Having the HP filter is great for increasing the low end content and I suppose the girth knob does something similiar.  What other gear do you have?  How do you plan on using it? Like sequencing, bass, lead, mostly pads, something else entierly or all of it."

There's only like 5 or 6 presets, and they're all a bit out there for my taste.  You'll hear me later start a vocoder patch from init, which I think sounds much better. I added some mix compression just to even out the volume.   The oscillators on the ion/micron/miniak aren't the best to start out with, so it's not the best sounding vocoder. But I'd say it's okay if you need the effect and the ion as a whole is fucking great. If you're gonna drop something like 200$ on a miniak or micro, go the extra 200 and get an ion for the excellent interface."

synthesizers,3coj6r,everyonepoops000,5,Thu Jul 9 15:13:32 2015 UTC,"The year was 2001. I was 9 years old and my father and I were on another one of our frequent trips to our local Tower Records (RIP). As I wandered aimlessly through the rows upon rows of CDs from every imaginable genre and decade, I spotted my Dad at his favorite section of all, the bargain bin. He flipped through old forgotten one hit wonders and optimistically premature ""Greatest Hits"" albums, the jewel cases clicking against each other with each dismissive flick of his fingers. The funny thing about the bargain bin is that somehow you still find yourself disappointed even though it's pretty clear what you're in for when you start searching. I watched for a short while and began flipping through as well, barely glimpsing the album covers as I did. Eventually I came across a black album with a generic eclipse photo on the front of it. It said ""EIFFEL 65    EUROPOP"". I recognized the band name, they made that blue song! What a catchy tune that was, as I immediately began humming it to myself as I scanned the back for anything familiar other than the hit I already knew. Nothing. However, what did catch my eye was the description on the back of each band member and their roles. ""Programming, Keyboards, Drum Machines, etc."" replaced the usual ""Guitar, Bass, Drums"" that I was so used to.    ""None of these guys play any instruments!"" I thought to myself in bewilderment, the same sentence that left my mouth as I graciously asked my father to spend the $2.99 it would cost to own it.    Needless to say, I listened to that album nonstop for a few months after that. I was amazed that these guys could create such catchy and interesting music with ""no real instruments"". From that point on I had a love of electronic music and the means to create it. By middle school I got into NIN, downloaded a demo copy of Ableton to load the multi tracks he released for With Teeth, and the rest was history."

synthesizers,3coj6r,Thismessishers,7,Thu Jul 9 17:51:51 2015 UTC,"My story with synths started with a guitar, a number of pedals, and a broken Casio keyboard that could only play three sounds. At first, I was trying to learn to play guitar when I learned that knowing how to play keyboards would help. So, I got a keyboard from my cousin. I liked the wierd lo-fi sounds (which I didn't know at the time was because of the broken sound card) and tried getting similar sounds from my guitar.   Eventually, this led to me getting various pedals to get different sounds. I tweaked, found limits, got crazy sounds, and at one point I remember distinctly my father had to turn the TV up to 100 just to hear it because I was making such loud, crazy noises. I kinda stopped after that, but still listened to 80's hair metal and such which featured synthesizers prevelantly. That's when I started researching synths, heard of the Minimoog (which I'd heard of before), and got a virtual emulator called MiniMogue VA.   That one virtual synth, which I still have, taught me so much about synths. I even got a MIDI keyboard to control it, which I still have. I was also researching other synths more and more, and eventually wanted a hardware synth. Enter the Korg Kaossilator, which I recently sold. That was fun, but I wanted more. However, this was during turbulent times within my family, so I had to stop for a while.   A couple years later, I rediscovered synthesizers. I got a ton of VSTs, joined online groups, used my guitar and pedals as synths... it was interesting. Then came the holy grail: the modular synthesizer.   The modular sythesizer has become my favourite instrument, but its cost put me off initially. I got modular VSTs, but didn't quite like them. I wanted something tactile. This is when I got into SDIY, which kickstarted my career as an electronic engineer. I built a ton of random analogue synths on breadboards, built effects for both studio racks and guitar pedals, and designed and built a few modules with varying degrees of success. I eventually got a job, was able to afford more parts and actual modules, and other synths like my beloved DX7.   A variety of turns were then taken in my life, landing me in Los Angeles with enough money to buy a number of analogue and digital synths, as well as growing my modular synth. By this point my studio has like 10 synths, including my modular, DX7, Voyager OS, Microbrute, VL-1, MS-20, monotron, CZ5k, and a Juno 6. I'm at the point where I have to keep some synths in their cases because I don't have room for them all, and yet I keep buying more. I'm getting a Sub 37 soon. Before that, I'm buying a new house to, among other things, have all my synths out and available."

I was making music with guitars and basses, but without anyone to start a band with, I was recording it all on my own. Micing my amps with the internal mic on my iBook, using GarageBand drum loops as backing tracks. I ended up recording an album like that. Painful.  I started smoking weed around this time and somehow the result was that I started liking electronic music more and more (Daft Punk was definitely my introduction to it, but I wouldn't say they were ever a huge influence on my music), so I started experimenting more in GarageBand. I took the drum loops I had been using for my rock songs, ran them through a gate and some distortion so they'd sound super robotic, then I would sample individual notes from my organ and arrange them piece-by-piece in GB.  At some point, I figured out that MIDI instruments were a lot less time consuming than this, which led to hardware, which led to more software, which led to even more hardware...."

All that time though and ever since then I had a picture in my head. No idea where it came from.  I'm sitting in front of a window, there's daylight outside but no detail, and I'm playing a keyboard. That image has been with me for a very long time and I have no idea where it came from.  Fast Forward to 2014, a really, REALLY shit year for me. Redundancies, lost friends and a pile of other bullshit. I spent new years crying as I hit the lowest point I've probably ever had.  At some point in January I too out my android tablet and wondered if I could make music with it. I had no idea why I thought that, but I started doing some research and found out about Caustic 3. I played around with it, and (badly) recreated the Cosmo Canyon theme from FFVII (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3srk8Dkuo not my version). I had fun doing it, slapping it together on the train to and from work.  I'd found a hobby. But at the time that was all. Soon though (within about a month) I wanted more. I got FL Studio and started working on other stuff. I picked up some books on music theory and began to teach myself the basics instead of blindly groping around for a tune.  Then I got a midi controller, an Akai MPK Mk2. I wanted to make music, not play an instrument. But there was always something wrong with his placing notes. Something wasn't quite right. I could tweak velocities, I could muck around with slightly off timings, but the music always sounded... wrong. I figured a cheap-ish controller wouldn't hurt, so gave it a shot.  Soon after I got my first SoftSynth, Poizone. Then the books on musical theory got shoved to the side for a while in favour of books on synthesizers.  Much like the initial issues using a DAW, using PoiZone didn't feel right. Adjusting the knobs and faders on a screen just didn't work. Linking to midi controls didn't work out too well either. I mean it worked perfectly but it felt wrong.  At this point I was recovering from my depression very well, and had just managed to clear most of my interest accumulating debts. I did my home work and decided I'd get either an MS20 mini, or a JDXI. I got the JDXI. I never looked back.  Synths just resonate with something in me. I am a synth player, I know it. I'm not very good at it yet, but this is something I am. That element of personal identity, something I've never had for most of my life helped a lot. Suddenly that image I've always had made sense.  In short, nothing specifically made me want to get into synths. It all sort of spiralled from a bunch of random whims that I happened to follow and happened to converge. And I'm glad it happened."

But playing a synth just does something for me that no other instrument has. I mainly played bass for the past 14 years, and I still thoroughly love it, but the experience of turning knobs and making sounds that make me shake my head because of how ridiculously cool they sounds is so transcendent.  Not everybody gets that. That's okay. It's a very personal experience. Unlike getting good at a random instrument, synths just have this gravity and mysticism surrounding them. Endless possibilities. An infinite learning process. Really glad I got into them."

And while it was always ""my parent's music"" there was one album I just latched onto. That was Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots by The Flaming Lips, which features heavy use of synths and drum machines. Something about those sounds connected with me on a deeper level, almost in a spiritual way. And while venues for musical exploration didn't present themselves to me until much later, I had a lot of indirect exposure to nonspecific ""electronic music"", which mainly consisted of happy hardcore and trance that friends of my parents and parents of my friends would end up playing around me. This was enough for me to know from a young age that I liked electronic music and synthesizers in general. At the same time I had always loved computers and other electronic devices. I always wanted to know the full extent of what they did, how to use them, and how they worked.

Also just being a ""child of the 80s"" when so much pop music started featuring them, too.  In addition to pop radio songs:  Wendy Carlos, Herbie Hancock, and Mannheim Steamroller get a bit of credit for my young self's evolving fascination.  I was lucky in that some of my friends had albums from these artists and let me listen.    For a birthday present one year I got a very small battery-powered Casio keyboard with like 8 presets on it or something.   I spent ridiculous number of hours just playing with that thing.  It sounded pretty bad and the keys were tiny but I didn't know any better and I adored it.  One of my friends in HS got a DX7 for Christmas one year and that seemed like somebody winning the lottery to me.  We were all very jealous of him.  He was cool and let us play with it.  My family also had some early adopters of primitive personal computers.  Whenever we'd get a new one in the house the first thing I'd want to do is figure out how to program sounds on it in BASIC.   I have played other instruments (one of them fairly seriously for years).  I was even was a singer for a while.  But nothing compares to the power and flexibility of a synth.  It has it all.  I don't have to tell you guys, you already know.  :)  Sadly life and work/family obligations have pulled me away from this beloved hobby for the last several months so I hope to delve back in before too long."

I listened to a lot of disco and funk from the 70s, and it started to grow on me with some of the greats like Herbie Hancock and the like.  Eventually, I caved and bought an Akai S2000 sampler.

But at that age,  and with the technology available,  it was quite mystical and unattainable. But the 80s brought numerous cheap synths. OK,  they weren't analogue anymore,  but their availability for the home market went through the roof.

I got a Yamaha RY-10 for drums and would record on a 4 track. I started to get into industrial (KMFDM, Ministry, etc). I then decided to get more synths in my music. I started with a cheap casio through guitar pedals and then got a QY-70 for sequencing. I was in love. I used the QY for everything from switching guitar effects to sequencing drums and synths. A local band heard one of my songs that I was playing for someone and offered me a gig as their keyboard player. I didn't have a proper synth and bought an Alesis QS6.1. I practiced every day so I could to be able to play the parts. The band never realized it. From then on I've been sliding more and more into electronic weirdness.   But, the moment it really hit was when I found Skinny Puppy. They sounded so aggressive. I realized my QS wasn't going to cut it (no knobs or filters). From then on, I started to get more into sound design and making strange music. I later found berlin school, progressive rock, and Jarre. I've been addicted to twiddling knobs and blinking lights since then. Recently, I've discovered Autechre and Aphex Twin. Great stuff. I still pick up the guitar, but love playing my synths more now.  I still use the QY-70 and it works beautifully to this day. Best sequencer ever."

One of the things that got traded around were MOD files. These were early sequenced music files that contained their samples right in the the file. I got into MOD tracking and reusing samples from various MOD files to make my own music. Since so much of it was techno and industrial music, it led me to raves and rave culture.  Once involved in the rave culture I wanted to learn how to DJ. I spent a little time getting familiar with spinning and I determined pretty quickly that I couldn't afford the records. So I got more familiar with the tools used to make the music on the records and I got into synths.

Workstations are static. The sounds are limited, normal, and a bit uninpsiring to a synth nerd. It isn't that we hate them, we just find them dull. They are useful boxes of sounds for those who need them. but even those with amazing synth engines lurking under the hood (Kronos, Triton with the MOSS board, etc) bury it under a painful and obscure interface that sucks the fun out of programming as surely as a vampire sucks blood."

Coming into synths from a middle school band and guitar background way back when the appeal was the ability to sculpt sound from the ground up.  The more I fiddled the more I fell in love with the actual science behind synthesis.  Reaktor and Max MSP are still WAY over my head, but it's exciting to think that, in theory, you could build an instrument that is essentially a guitar that has a flexible body that breathes in time with your tempo setting. Or maybe the density of the wood changes over time while the strings slowly mute from nylon to steel.  Synthesis gives us a way to play with the fundemental building blocks of sound. Realistic or just sheer number of presets don't appeal to a lot of people that want to sculpt."

There's just too many options and the sound generation is abstracted from the interface too much. I prefer an instrument where there is a direct correspondence between the controls and the sound characteristics, and that doesn't change around too much. Most workstations and DAWs tend to have a lot of menus and screens you need to navigate to develop your sounds, and you end up mapping particular controls to a set of generic knobs or sliders.

synthesizers,3cpqm5,squidfood,6,Thu Jul 9 21:16:08 2015 UTC,"For me, I was brought up early on as a gigging guitarist towards the ""dedicated pieces"" school of thought. I'm not rigid with it. For instance, I'm pretty die hard about my Kurzweils (k2k and pc3) but outside of those, none really do it for me, and if I didn't have them I'd probably have my Sub37, a Nord electro, and maybe a Korg MS2000. A good amount of options. Simple reality is most people can't properly utilize all of those things. A good pianist is not necessarily a good organist, or a good clav player.       I know it sounds like I'm saying options are a bad thing, but to be honest I kinda think they are. One of my favorite guitars on the earth is an Esquire. Not because I'm old school and vintage and think I'm a hardcore blues guy. I think it's one of the most versatile instruments in the world. But not because it has a million sounds, but because it has one sound that you can do a million things with.      Think about all the people here that probably make and produce EDM. I know next to nothing about it. I don't even really know what 'drum n' bass' is and I have no intention of finding out. And I love that one of them can take a Minibrute, a Midiverb, and a Machinedrum and make a whole club bounce and scream and I can make long winded depressing soundtracks. That gets down to the differences in the  rawness of the creative mind. Not that there's not a lot of sounds from the MB and the MD, but comparatively speaking there's not the same amount of options. So what that means is you have to get on with the business of making music. The same could happen with a super workstation, but that's to be expected. That's why it was designed. You brought up the Axe FX, and the notion that people can sound like every great amp and every guitar guitar is attractive to me or anyone probably, but when I stop and think about guiarists' sound who I'd love to emulate, they always had the same sound all of the time.

Another example is the uhe Bazille that is basically a modular soft synth. It has a lot of digital synth features but with very analog filter. I made A/B comparisons of several of my favorite sounds on the Bass Station 2 and could literally not hear the difference when I recreated them on Bazille. So I sold my bass station."

synthesizers,3cq7we,Roland19,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"That is weird, never heard of anything like that. First step would be to plug another MIDI keyboard into it to see if the same thing happens when you try to play it using a different device. If it plays fine there, then Something in your computer chain is causing a problem. try a different synth taking MIDI from your computer and see if it has any issues. If the Novation does carry on being weird with a different controller, contact Novation support to see if they can help. I'd advise a factory reset, but as a factory reset on these things involves transmitting the OS via MIDI, and your MIDI might be broken..."
synthesizers,3cq79k,chimy727,5,Thu Jul 9 22:05:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what's going on with the first issue, but the plug out synths must be purchased.  If you use the product key card code that came with your 1m then you will get a discounted rate ($95).  They are VST synths, but you can plug out to the 1m so you essentially get the hardware synth as well.  They are expensive, but they do sound really good and are decently priced compared to other high-end VST instruments out there.  You buy the VST, connect your 1m to your PC via USB, set the MIDI output option to the 1m, then hit the plug-out button and your hardware will be updated."

I'm not at all familiar with the roland but have been learning my way around the ms2000. maybe try running the audio from the roland into the ms2000 then setting up a vocoder patch that uses the arp?

synthesizers,3cooa3,mdrsharp,7,Thu Jul 9 15:21:55 2015 UTC,"I have one, it rules, and can absolutely keep up with VAs of today in most respects with a couple exceptions. The keys feel really nice and provide channel aftertouch, and the synth itself really feels ""alive"" with character, if that makes any sense. The built-in effects are nice, the reverb in particular is excellent. I'd go for the AN1x over the Reface CS any day of the week.  It offers simple FM that allows for one modulator and does nice bellish tones. There are a couple DX-style factory patches that make good use of it, although they're not quite as lush and complex as the DX7 or Reface DX.  Unique features include filter feedback (adds fatness), Aphex licensed exciter (adds bite), an oscillator ""Hardness"" parameter, and something Yamaha calls ""Free EGs"", which let you record and play back knob twists which you can send to any modulation target. Also IT DOESN'T FORGET YOUR UNSAVED PATCH WHEN YOU POWER IT OFF HOW COOL IS THAT  The sound palette is as varied as you would come to expect from a full-featured VA, but I've noticed there are a couple of things it does particularly well, namely warm analog-style brass, big washy pads, and anything that sounds like it should be part of the Kung Fury soundtrack. Supposedly the thing was particularly designed with a sonic nod to the Prophet 5, and if it was then it sure as hell shows, but not without bringing its own clean digital element into it, along with something one might call ""sparkle"" or ""fizz"".  There are some things modern synths do better. Editing is kind of finicky in some places and modulation targets could be more numerous. The ribbon and aftertouch are polled too slowly resulting in audible stepping when modulating things like pitch or cutoff. Apparent lack of oversampling means you'll get aliasing in the high registers when using the synth's built-in distortion or exciter. I have also had the occasional glitch when sending large chunks of sysex to other devices on the same MIDI hub, which required a reboot to recover from.  Although the 8-knob multi-page system is pretty good for most editing, Yamaha's own MIDI editor for Windows makes things like tweaking the free EGs and buried parameters a whole lot easier. Be warned that it's no longer supported software though, so things may break in the future. Get the printed manual too, you'll want it to take full advantage of the machine.  tl;dr: Just get one already, they're the bee's knees especially considering the price they go for. Yamaha should just rerelease these, improving only where necessary."
synthesizers,3cooa3,HhatWork,6,Thu Jul 9 16:10:12 2015 UTC,"I owned one. One of the first and best VA synths. Beautiful sound design possibilities. Beautiful effects.

synthesizers,3cooa3,EndOfTheDigitalAge,3,Thu Jul 9 16:01:52 2015 UTC,"It's really amazing. A few days ago I dumped all the patches to my computer and filled the whole thing with INIT patches. Now I'm starting to hear and see the true power if this machine. It sounds huge. The FM is really just simple and effective way to get more complex waveforms to start with (you're not going to get DX-level sounds. But that's not this machine's point).  You also get a two layers per patch. This can be a bass/lead split, a bi-timbral setup (different midi rx channel per layer), or even a mega 4-osc dual filter sound. There's no rules (except you can't change the split point if it's a split).  The filters are really juicy and would be great for anything including Acid or Synthpop. Two layers combined with unison and per-voice stereo separation and detune is huuuuuge. Forget Roland supersaws, you won't even miss them when you use Unison in the AN1x.  It's good at 80's sounds too. It's also got a really really nice low end for a VA. I've played 7 or 8 live shows with it and our band didn't even have a bass player because this machine dominated the low end. Both venues I've played this thing shook the building (in a musical way).  It's also good at Boards of Canada drifting sounds. It can do a pretty good ROYGBIV cover.  Anyway, that was more a ramble than a concise review. Basically, yes, I recommend getting one! I also highly recommend clearing out the internal patches and starting from all initialized patches, then you'll truly make this machine your own."
synthesizers,3cooa3,Biopharmer,9,Thu Jul 9 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"One of the best sounding virtual analogues of all. Beautiful, silky sound, rich and warm. Yes, the cutoff steps if you tweak it, but that's not the point of a synth like this (probably fair to mention that a fair few renowned eighties analogues also step when adjusting the filter). It's a pad machine par excellence, and it was so shocking to me that yamaha didn't follow it up with an AN2x.   The FM isn't something I ever delved into on it, I wasn't particularly au fait with what FM did when I got to play on the ones I got to play on so I never messed with it. Download the manual and have a look to see how it's done.  For the prices these things can be had, though, they're well worth it, a real modern classic. Have a listen to Jexus demonstrating one to see how it can be pushed."
synthesizers,3cooa3,t0xicd0g,3,Thu Jul 9 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"The cutoff is smoother if you tweak it via the mod wheel. Not perfect, but much better than the 128 levels the knob gives you."

That's why some people who go out and get a TR8 come back thinking it sounds nothing like the 808s they've heard on records - 808s that have been EQd, compressed, distorted, etc. Naked of effects, a drum machine alone won't hold up amazingly in a track. A touch of careful EQ to bring out the relevant areas of the spectrum, some compression to give it a bit of punch, even some soft overdrive to maybe give it edge, these are all things to do to make your drums jump out of a mix."

The tube drive I've got setup to really boost the low ends and give the kick a decidedly more 909 sound (in terms of thumpy bassiness). The overdrive definitely helps, though I'm sure that overdrive could be applied directly to just the snare and kick to great effect.  I've even just taken it straight and the applied slight EQ afterwards in DAW."

synthesizers,3cpht3,littlegreenalien,5,Thu Jul 9 20:53:28 2015 UTC,"Opposed to what most reply's say. You're right. The main power of machines of that era were in fact the individual outputs (not only drummachines, samplers came with 10 outputs as well, synths often had 4) and everyone had a 32:8:2 Soundcraft spirit or mackie mixing desk. Allowing decent semi-parametric EQ on every sound, overdrive through the preamp, FX though the auxes, compression through the inserts or on the busses.   That's the main reason I bought my R8, because it had 10 outputs. I could shape the kick to fit the snare and vice versa with only a few knobs on the desk. Being able to work 2EQ's at the same time makes it dead easy and fast as well. Sure you didn't have as much controle in the machine itself, but you can do a whole lot with some simple EQ to a 808 or 909 kick. A mixing desk like that is an instrument on it's own."

Snare can use some boost around 200hz and cut around 130hz if used on top of the kick. everything else can use some low shelving at 130hz. Use a drum bus eq and cut 4.5khz a touch and boost with a high shelf at around 8k. Level of boost and cut will vary depending on your application. After that, a bit of parallel compression on the drum bus followed by a touch of saturation or overdrive and a bus reverb will get you in the ballpark.   edit for the down vote. sorry guys! should have just said smash it thru some shit guitar pedals and post it on bandcamp with art made in ms paint. forgot which sub reddit i was on."

Doesn't seem like the interface is actually improved much compared to all other fm synths which also are really crappy to actually edit. Same problem as the reface sorta. I want an EDITABLE fm synth, I already have a bunch that aren't. Maybe I'm wrong."
synthesizers,3codpy,bingaman,2,Thu Jul 9 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"I dunno, for a long time I was the same way: I wanted an FM synth as simple as subtractive to program, with lots of knobs and whatnot. The more I think about it though, I just don't think that's the optimal interface for FM. FM really shines with lots of precise, in depth sound design, which would be hard to do with a subtractive-style interface.  For me, the appeal of the sammichFM is similar to that of the sammichSID. It's at this weird intersection of cheesy video game music and serious sound-design synthesis. It's an added bonus that I can build it myself without the headaches of doing a modular MIDIbox. The interface is what it is, but I can appreciate that it's someone's pet project and that more controls would add significantly to the cost. FWIW, the midi implementation on my sammichSID is better than I ever would have imagined; the ability to 100% automate it from my DAW more than makes up for the one-knob interface for me. I expect sammichFM to be similar."

synthesizers,3codpy,Sabored,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:06:48 2015 UTC,"I had never really done it much until I started experimenting with my sammichSID. I had the same problem as you; automating my hardware never worked as nicely as the same strategy did with software. I suppose probably because I was dealing mostly with vintage synths and their MIDI implementation simply wasn't meant to be used that way, although maybe modern synths suffer from the same issues.  Anyway, I could gush about my sammichSID for days. My biggest gripe is like what you said about the FM—editing ain't so friendly—but again, it's such a deep architecture that a full interface would be difficult (even the MB6582, which has a ""full"" interface, has to make a lot of sacrifices for simplicity). It's definitely a synth that you have to sit down with and really learn, but the payoff is well worth the initial investment."

You can probably get a good closed hat, but that's more reliant on the envelopes than anything else. Vermona is known for being hardcore analog shit -- so you have to expect that raw analog drum machine noise sound. Vermona actually posted a sound demo on their site where they sweep through some parameters of individual elements here.  P.S. If you want a second opinion, I've never been a fan of Vermona stuff, but they make stuff look cool as hell. If you like the kick, they offer a small form factor kick module.

The hi-hats and cymbals are also fully analog channels, achieved by noise + filtering. So you always kinda end up with a synthesised hihat that's nowhere near realistic. You can come pretty close to an 808 style, but think 'kraftwerk' as that would give a better idea of the hat sound. But it has enough controle to cover a wide range of sounds.   I use the vermona drm a whole lot and I really love it. But then again, I do love those really analog drum sounds and I often use a synth to make percussive sounds (bass drums to high-hats, etc..)"

Both HiHat-Channels can be triggered by two different MIDI notes, one will make the release time slightly longer, so that each HiHat Channel can produce both Closed and Opend HiHat. That's very convenient.  Secondly, the tone of the HiHat channels can be modified in a very wide range. They do not need to sound harsh at all.  Here are two (very unfinished, and not much processed) work in progress of mine that both use the Vermona and its HiHats, with different tones:  http://www.voxager.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/v7_quoderat.mp3  http://www.voxager.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/v7_threeworlds.mp3"

If you want them to sound like sampled hi hats you are going to have a difficult time. You won't regret the DRM1 in general. I will admit sometimes I like to pair up my TR505 and put its hi-hats over the DRM1 simply because I'm looking for a more old school hi-hat sound for more house-y sounding stuff. The thing with the DRM is you really want to run a sequence through it and just sit there tweaking the knobs the possibilities are huge and you could probably do a whole song with just the Vermona this way. For example, the ""DRUM"" sounds can sound like these crazy modulated wood block sounds if you put the pitch all the way up and set the FM up just right. The snare is absolutely awesome as well."

At the extra premium for the rack version I'd hope you still at least get the SH-101.  I will say that I still would rather have a System-1m because it will be interesting to hear what happens when it's really integrated with a modular system.

synthesizers,3cmvb9,Lurkmcgirk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:10:58 2015 UTC,"I guess that's the Range knob on the 101 - definitely useful, but not really the same thing (though in practice pretty similar because the 101 only has a single osc). It's basically a four-way rotary switch rather than a continuous controller - e.g. similar to the Waveform knob rather than the Tune knob.  Maybe the Reface octave sliders are detented or something - that could work. But a sliding, continuous control is pointless and bizarre for switching octaves - it's not dissimilar to having a smooth slider for Off and On."

The best situation for you would be to go try out both and see what you like best. I sort of live in a synth dead zone so I had to take a chance on it. Although the learning curve was steep for me, I'm glad I got it. I've had it for a year and I'm still cranking out new sounds. The one thing it can't do great is classic analog sounds. It can emulate them pretty well, but it is not what this synth was made for. Cool wavetable textures, percussion like sounds, and complex ambient pads is what really shine on the 12. With a great reverb unit, it's brought to a whole new level."

synthesizers,3clqrh,ZephrimC,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:40:27 2015 UTC,"Nice, yeah I have a BS2 and a MB so there's a little too much overlap for me to get a MS-20 mini too at this point.

synthesizers,3clqrh,TMobotron,3,Thu Jul 9 04:04:29 2015 UTC,"As an owner of a Microbrute and a BS2, let me second the guy who said you should shop used and get them both (or at least get one of them for cheaper). Also, if you really meant Minibrute in your title, I'd definitely suggest a Microbrute instead. It's a far better value IMO.  I've posted on here before about the two of them, and my verdict was basically that they are both excellent - BS2 a little better, but directly proportional to its difference in price. At their respective price points they're both pretty perfect.  Since then, I've started to lean just slightly more towards the MB. BS2 has a fair bit more going for it on paper, but I'm finding the MB to have quite a bit more character. BS2 is capable of more sounds, but everything in MB's more limited range sounds a little better to me. And its brute factor is a great ""fattening"" feature. It also has a better interface and is closer to KPF, which might help in getting me closer to the type of sounds I want.  But either way, I feel a lot of analog warmth/fatness from it that I'm not as successful in getting out of my BS2 (it's there, but not quite as much). And though a lot of people probably put too much importance on the ""analog sound"" (and I'm almost certainly one of them), I just find myself getting the kind of synth sounds that have always fascinated me and got me into analog synths in the first place from the MB. BoC are a huge influence, and I get a lot of their synths' warm, human vibe from the MB. But there's also this great video of the BS2 that shows how great it is at some of those sounds as well.  I'd say look at the features that the BS2 has that the MB doesn't (keeping in mind the MB has a few features the BS2 doesn't as well) and decide if they're crucial for you. Things like 2 OSCs and a true sub-OSC can be a big deal (though MB makes up for them some with the waveform options and the ""Overtone"" feature). I also use the BS2 for MIDI control sometimes which is important when I'm working with HW only and need a 5-pin out, and full keys is a huge plus. But if you can live without the added features of BS2 (and you almost certainly can), I'd go with that. It sounds unbelievable and better (IMO) than the BS2, and it's a simpler interface that's definitely better for a first purchase."

For your first synth, I would recommend this as its an excellent LEARNING TOOL & will help you a lot further down the road...

On top of the awesome sounds there, it's capable of so much more and some really spectacular pads. The analog voltage soundset is something you do have to buy, but I actually think you're better off trying to achieve that analog sound on your own and learning way more about the synth in the process.  BUT it is way more complicated than any monosynths at that price point and its interface is far worse than something like a Microbrute that's close to KPF, which makes the depth of the Blofeld's parameters a little intimidating and requires a good bit of patience especially at first.

synthesizers,3ckd6l,t0xicd0g,3,Fri Jul 10 01:24:19 2015 UTC,"As u/plaxpert quite rightly says, it's down to cables. A stereo socket (like on your phone) has two separate contact points, one for each channel. One goes through the tip of the plug, the other through the 'ring' beneath it, the bit separated by the black lines from both the tip and the base of the actual jack plug. If you plug a mono cable into a stereo socket, only one of those contact points will be sending a signal as a mono cable only has a tip contact, and no ring; this means that at the other end you will only hear one of the stereo channels coming from your phone. What you need to do is get a cable with a stereo mini jack plug at one end, and two mono jacks at the other end, and the tip signal will go down one cable, and the ring signal down the other, giving you full stereo from your phone into your MPC."

To distribute them, you can either chain your two devices using the THRU output of one of them, or you can use a MIDI Y-cable (or a MIDI splitter) and send the data to both devices.  Since channel informations are coded, each device will only listen to instructions on its own channel.  Of course, if you send on channels 1 and 2 and your devices can only receive on channel 1 for example... you'd need some sort of MIDI processing box that will alter the stream so that the devices receive instructions correctly... but that's a bit complicated I think."

You can't just switch a knob, you need to select menus on an LCD screen and dive through multiple menus to get to whatever you want.   Honestly, I really dig the microkorg interface. You turn 1 knob to select a logical subset of settings, then turn another to set a value. You never need to go further than 2 turns to get whatever you want. After a bit of practice, it becomes very intuitive and easy. Also, it still sounds pretty good for a VA. The waves are very fat and thick, and there's a good amount of routing capabilities to change up the sound. However, only 4 note polyphony.  I've never owned a mininova, but all I've heard is that it sounds too sterile, too digital and too tame. I've owned a MK for a long time and recently switched up with a m2k (Same voice engine, knobby interface). The microkorg will set you back about 200$, and you'll probably spend at least 300$ on a mininova. If you want easier sound tweaking, just get the M2k for an extra 100$."
synthesizers,3cjdoq,FieldsofBlue,4,Wed Jul 8 13:12:15 2015 UTC,"He's in a studio and has been in the box for 3 years, in which case the vst/standalone Mininova editor will do him for deep patching, while the superior tweaking interface will see him right when he's playing about with created patches, also if he decides to play with others.   I came from the same angle and chose the Nova for that reason, despite being a Korg lover. It was the right move, for me at least.  As always, best to try both, although with mini synths the plugin is bloody important, and shops typically don't have that to try."
synthesizers,3cjdoq,governmentyard,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"Worth noting... if you use maxforlive, this is free and really helps with the interface of the microkorg...  I had an ultranova and a buddy had the mininova... both sound tinny and are a pain to program... also the editor as well as the hardware crashes very often. Novation should stick with analog gear (bass station ii is awesome) and midi controllers. the microkorg is way old, but you're still comparing it, and it's still sold new... that should tell you a lot about it."
synthesizers,3cjdoq,luche,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:29:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, I think I will go with the Nova just because although I'll spend longer creating patches I think I would be able to get a wider range of sounds out of it. Unfortunately synths tend to be more costly here in the UK and there isn't a whole lot of second hand stuff going around, so in terms of cost the MK would cost me £250 and the Nova £270 which is about $400."
synthesizers,3cjdoq,t0xicd0g,4,Thu Jul 9 07:25:20 2015 UTC,"Out of the two, the original MicroKorg is probably the easier to use and program of the two; the MiniNova is deeper, has more polyphony, but when it's hidden behind a fairly tedious interface, more becomes less, if you get my drift.   However, these are not your only options; Roland's JD-Xi is a great contender for the small home studio. It's an analogue monosynth (real, not modelled), two polyphonic ROMpler synths, a decent drum machine and a step sequencer all rolled into a compact package. I'd check this out before you head off to Korg or Novation."
synthesizers,3cjdoq,zzsnzmn,5,Wed Jul 8 15:24:15 2015 UTC,If you're leaning towards the MicroKorg I recommend trying to find a second hand MS2000. Easier to program and similar (not sure if the same?) sound engines.
synthesizers,3cjdoq,selfinflikted,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:49:03 2015 UTC,This.
synthesizers,3cjdoq,3lbFlax,4,Thu Jul 9 16:14:55 2015 UTC,"They're both good at what they do. The nova has more voices and is far more flexible. IMO it can sound just as analogue as the Microkorg, though I've only used the original MK (and an Ultranova, but that shares the same engine as the Mini).  The nova has very deep modulation possibilities (including six loopable envelopes and some unconventional LFOs), and using these - along with its many other features - is the key to success. You have to roll up your sleeves and get stuck into it. The MK will, I think, give you more immediate results (and they'll sound great), but the nova has far more potential.  But if I was considering a Mininova, I'd also shop around to see how much Ultranovas can be had for nowadays - a great keybed, MIDI controller and audio interface, which could all be useful in a mini studio."
synthesizers,3cjdoq,EndOfTheDigitalAge,2,Wed Jul 8 13:58:34 2015 UTC,"Mininova, but also check out the Novation K-Station."
synthesizers,3cjdoq,ranzee,2,Wed Jul 8 11:23:17 2015 UTC,"MiniNova has more voices - which might be handy. Both can achieve similar synthesis but with vastly different interfaces.  I own a MicroKorg, have for over 10 years. It still sells new. I think Korg got something right here. However, I do think it probably is a bit dated now - and I would definitely consider something newer - like the Roland System-1 or the JD-Xi."
synthesizers,3cjdoq,MacZyver,2,Wed Jul 8 12:01:30 2015 UTC,"Went through the same as you, microkorg or mininova? Personally I went with the mininova(I have it and I love it)because of the polyphony. Though I do wish I had gotten the microkorg for the sound, it's not the end of the world. You could get one now and the other later, then you get the best of both worlds. Synths of different brands have different geneticsfor lack of a better word and so it really depends on the sound that you want. As others have said, the interfaces are different, the mininova has more menus that you have to go through, animations through the pads, and a dedicated filter cutoff knob. The microkorg display simpler and about the same amount of knobs. just go with what you are sure that you want   PS One last thing, I got a meeblip anode as a compliment for the analogue sound"

The MiniNova has a much more impressive engine, but the keys are very tacky and it's first impression left me much to desire.  With that said, I know the MiniNova can do some very impressive stuff.

That certainly is up to how you use it, what kind of patches you create.   And more toy than a synth? It's not even an argument for anything, just an arrogant way of discarding something you happen to not enjoy."
synthesizers,3cjdoq,xmnstr,-1,Wed Jul 8 13:20:59 2015 UTC,"No really, there are many better virtual analog synthesizers out there. It was introduced in 2002, that's 13 years ago. Don't you think DSP technology has evolved since, allowing for better algorithms? Is it really unreasonable to call it outdated? Analog gear does not evolve in the same way so it's very hard to compare it directly like that.  Why not call it a toy? The functionality is very simple on purpose. Sure, you can access some more features with an editor but even if you do that it's obvious that the architecture is fairly stripped down. Not to mention the four voice polyphony.  Just a quick question, have you ever owned one?"
synthesizers,3cjdoq,t0xicd0g,7,Wed Jul 8 13:28:53 2015 UTC,"It's hugely unreasonable to call it outdated. This is a market that worships 30 year old 'outdated' gear. I just bought an MS2000 which is a MicroKorg covered in knobs and frankly it kicks arse. It's ballsy and raw and dirty as hell. Does it sound particularly analogue? Not really; that's why I have my Tetra and my AX73 and my Microbrute. What I wanted from the MS2000 is exactly what I got; character and aggression. Synths might age, but the characteristics associated with their sounds don't and remain in demand, or not, with the passage of time. Has it been superceded in technology? Yes. Do any of the newer synths sound like an MS2000? Nope. Which makes the MS2000 still desirable for those who want that sound. That's kind of how this all works.   My Korg Z1 is even older, but nothing,  nothing has ever been able to do what it does, before or since. Is it old and outdated too?   Anybody using the word 'outdated' with regards to synthesiser technology is probably in this hobby for the wrong reasons."

But I would definitely encourage OP to snag an MK used.  The Mininova's engine is much deeper, but if I wanted that sound, I'd spend a few more dollars and get the more usable Ultranova instead."

synthesizers,3cjdoq,xmnstr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:58:44 2015 UTC,"It's popular because it's marketed as the perfect newbie-synth. Most people who buy these don't move on to other machines. It's not really a serious synthesizer, that's why it sold in such quantities. It's a mass market toy."
synthesizers,3cjdoq,ouij,4,Wed Jul 8 13:18:49 2015 UTC,"It's not really a serious synthesizer,    It's actually a more serious synthesizer than most folks give it credit for. Careful programming can get a lot out of it, up to and including some crude 2-operator FM synthesis. The programming interface leaves a lot to be desired, to be sure. But the rotary switch/pushbutton bank and preset selection system is robust and easy to work when playing live.   I guess a fairer criticism is that it's a quasi-preset machine. Sound design and programming are intended to be a separate process from performance. But given the small size and the option of battery power, that's not a big deal.  Also, the original Microkorg draws from a 9V center negative plug, so guitarists can plug it into the same power supply they use for their pedalboards. Don't underestimate convenience, especially for people who are not primarily synthesists.   that's why it sold in such quantities.   It was (relatviely) cheap new; it is absolutely cheap used. It's portable and convenient. It comes with presets that are ""synthy"" enough for band use and an engine that rewards careful programming. It's also very cheap. Did I mention the cheapness?  Nobody's going to mistake a Microkorg for an OB-8, but it gets the job done for not a lot of money."

synthesizers,3cgmjt,ouij,6,Tue Jul 7 20:04:46 2015 UTC,I cannot fathom why Yamaha is releasing a DX reissue that's only 4-op and sine-only.
synthesizers,3cgmjt,LordoftheSynth,6,Wed Jul 8 00:42:46 2015 UTC,"If it was cheaper, I think it would make sense - a ""DX-lite"" with mini keys and 4 ops, at a price that can compete with the MicroKorg (and other synths in that price range). But the MSRP is $799 - sure, that means street price of $100-200 less, but that's still too much.  Hopefully they're using this to test the waters - if it sells well enough, maybe they'll release a proper DX, with 6 operators, more wave shapes, full size keys, and an editor that isn't terrible. At least, I can dream..."
synthesizers,3cgmjt,KeytarVillain,3,Wed Jul 8 05:46:29 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with it making sense if it were cheaper--except 4-op instead of 6-op. Any of the Yamaha 6-op algorithm sets in the classic DXs have all the 4-op algorithm sets they offered somewhere inside.  The implementation of 6-op is a long-solved problem and there's no way any processor today is underpowered enough to warrant 4. (The original DX-7 had a couple slave processors inside in addition to the main CPU.) Progamming 6-op instead of 4-op is not conceptually any simpler in terms of the basics you need to understand, so the idea that they might offer a 4-op Reface as being easier to program doesn't make sense to me. I can excuse the lack of additional waveforms as not ""classic"" DX, but not the lack of 6-op.  I've thought about it a bit today, and I suspect you are correct that they are testing the waters to see what they could potentially sell with a ""genuine"" reissue. They haven't waited long enough to see how anything but the MS-20 reissue sold in the long-term: so they were likely developing these before Korg announced the Odyssey re-issue. I hope they calculated their price point correctly.  I could be tempted by a well-executed DX reissue, so I could have hardware without the compromises in the DX-7 as an alternative. I would empty my savings account to buy a modern CS-80 reissue (and not even in the same form factor)."
synthesizers,3cgmjt,LordoftheSynth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:33:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's no way they couldn't do 6-op if they wanted - after all, Moore's Law says you should be able to get a processor 65,000 times more powerful for the same price as you could in 1983.  But I do think it's about simplicity. Sure, conceptually, 4-op and 6-op are the same - except complexity increases quite a bit with number of operators, as the number of possible combinations increases exponentially. I mean, the first thing you see when you try to program a DX-7 is this diagram, and I can see how that would scare newcomers off. I've seen tutorials for DX-7 clone VSTs where the person just goes ""okay, so, uhh, set your operators to these ratios... now cycle through the algorithms until you find one you like"", showing the person knows absolutely nothing about FM synthesis. FM can be downright scary for newcomers, so I can see why they would limit it to 4 for an entry-level product.  Just look at the algorithms on the 4-op Ableton Operator - so much more approachable. Yeah, I know each operator is more powerful than on a DX so you can't directly compare them in terms of power, but regardless - it's so much friendlier to a newcomer to see that, and more conducive to actually understanding what that diagram means.  Also, it looks like 4-op fits the interface better. This video shows a bit of programming of the thing, and I can see why - 4 ops fit better on the screen, it means only 4 sliders, fewer buttons, etc.  I do still wish it was 6-operator. But I don't blame them for making it 4."

Korg is doing proper reissues.  After some non-starters even Roland is getting it and they're usually the ones out of touch.  I don't know if Yamaha is trying to gauge general interest as a prelude to a ""real"" reissue, or seeing if they can hit the lower end of the market with with some modern re-creations. But at $500 MSRP they're not hitting that, and instead of doing a Second Coming of the DX-7 they're reissuing the DX-9.  The CS unit looks interesting enough to try.

synthesizers,3cgmjt,digitaldavis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:09:18 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I would think the same way when purchasing gear. However, in terms of an investment, the new gear at the same price SHOULD have more features than a used piece of gear. It costs more new, so it should have more value. In a year, there will be used version of these Yamaha for sale too, and they'll be significantly cheaper as well. That's where the comparison starts to break down a little."

There are lots of more attractive options for that price point right now, and a basic DSP synth doesn't seem worth that kind of money right now when you can go full analog and get some great kit for that price.

synthesizers,3cijfs,RobotCookie,4,Wed Jul 8 05:37:40 2015 UTC,Paging /u/kopkaas2000. He posted this review a while back and I'm sure has done more experimenting since!
synthesizers,3cijfs,MultiplyTheBear,6,Wed Jul 8 12:52:27 2015 UTC,"Overall, I'm still loving it. They did an update a little over a month back, where they moved their Equator plug-in engine to the onboard microcontroller of the Seaboard itself. My major gripe with its need to be tethered to a computer has been solved through this.  The organic quality to the interaction you have with the instrument always seems to turn even sterile synth sounds into something that sounds and feels alive. There's lots of promise here. Playing it, even after a couple of months, is still a lot of fun.  The downsides you should be aware of:      There's no direct MIDI output. Either use the onboard engine, or you have to go through a computer. My ultimate plan is to use something like a raspberry Pi to help me with that, and do something clever with a CODE8. This product still has a lot of beta edges. The on-board Equator engine is pretty crash prone, and 'rebooting' the Seaboard takes about a minute. Not quite sure if I'm ready to haul it into live situations yet. The way they set up the touch surfaces makes it that, when microtonality is enabled, you cannot play any intervals smaller than a major second. A minor second legato will always turn into a glissando. A chord with a minor second in it is right out. If you take an honest look at the electronics involved in creating something like this, the pricing seems really rather steep. It could be that the patented silicone/rubber material that they use for creating the keybed comes at a high cost, but I have doubts that it's that bad. Especially if you look at the ridiculous price increase for the 88 keys version. I don't mind too much, but it does feel that they're using the 'toy collectors with a lot of expendable income' demographic to basically finance their development."

synthesizers,3cijfs,t_wag,3,Wed Jul 8 22:53:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly the Push with Ableton lets you set up either soft-synths or hardware synths to respond to velocity and aftertouch pretty cleanly. Baring that, there's a way you can set up a Maschine to send both note and pressure data depending on the software. Finally, check out Kieth McMillan's gear; the QuNexus is particularly  awesome as it sends velocity, pressure, aftertouch, and CC data, all at once, over MIDI, USB, or CV."

synthesizers,3cimsp,ETaroonie,14,Wed Jul 8 05:06:25 2015 UTC,"I'll try to give a brief rundown. Note that these are all massive generalizations and each company has had products that diverge from the descriptions below (e.g. the Nord Modular line was nothing like what they make now).  Nord: Red synths and pianos. All digital. Their designs tend more towards immediacy than flexibility. ""Professionals"" often use them because they're reliable and quick. They make workhorses.  Korg: These days, they seem to specialize in inexpensive synths that aren't usually the best in terms of build quality, but often deliver a price to feature ratio that beats the other manufacturers.  Moog: I mean, it's Moog. They make synths inspired by their past glories (70s/80s) that are generally well-built, sound great, and cost a pretty penny. I love my Sub 37 to death. Google ""Moog bass sound"".  Access: The Virus series. Expensive as hell, built like tanks, unmistakable sound. A Virus sounds like a Virus, and there's no substitute if you need the Virus sound. I'm not really sure how better to explain it.  Arturia: They make two analog synths that are very similar: the Minibrute and Microbrute. Generally speaking, they're somewhat aggressive-sounding basic synths. They're good fun. I enjoy my Microbrute, but I won't pretend that it's my go-to for ambient sounds or anything complex.  Dave Smith: Most of their products are pretty complex analog synths. Similar to Moog, most of their products are heavily inspired by classic synths from their past, but they tend less towards a specific sound (e.g. the ""Moog sound"") and more towards providing a ton of options. Of the manufacturers you mentioned, they're the ones that come to mind for complex sound design.  I don't know what your price range looks like, though. Essentially, it comes down to this: polyphonic, analog, affordable; you can have any two. Dave Smith's Evolver is a fantastically complex analog synth (four oscillators - two analog, two digital, a great mod matrix, multiple envelopes, and an extremely flexible sequencer) that retails for $500, but it's monophonic. It also depends on if you're looking at something with keys or not.  Not having an exact idea of your price range and guessing that you'd like a more complete set of keys than your MicroKorg, I'm going to echo t0xicd0g's suggestion of a Mopho X4. It has four voices, a fairly deep engine, and a solid set of keys with aftertouch."
synthesizers,3cimsp,ruuurbag,5,Wed Jul 8 13:27:17 2015 UTC,"If you want an analog polysynth but want to do complex sound design, and at a reasonably affordable price, your choices are; Prophet 08 and Mopho X4. There simply aren't that many analogue polys on the market yet. In terms of vintage gear, anything capable of deep sound programming is likely to be many thousands of pounds.   I terms of what manufacturers do, you might want to get on Google to do some reading, as Nord and Access don't do analogue synths at all."

I would suggest if you are on a budget and don't mind considering an older piece of gear, then take a look at the Roland JX-3P and Korg Poly 800. Although not as hands on to program as many more knobby synths of the same era, they are fine with a bit of familiarity.

I've done this on my Korg DW-8000 over the course of 2 or 3 days and it brought all of the tact switches back to life.  This method was recommended by the Roland tech who repaired my Juno-106.  If this doesn't work then you will need to replace the tact switches, which will require soldering. You can order the switches from Syntaur or you can save yourself a few bucks if you can track down a part number and order from Mouser or Digikey."
synthesizers,3ciezz,sqweebking,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:07:36 2015 UTC,"Dont do this! Tact switches can be ruined by ""dousing"" them w/ Deoxit, if they're bad replace them but I'm willing to bet that some lingering Deoxit is shorting or grounding out the inoperative switches.  In the future don't just spray Deoxit into faders, the proper way to recondition sliders is covered in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQTPB-EHmE  Syntegrator has a great Juno 106 reconditioning series that I recommend anyone attempting self repairs watch regardless of what you're working on."
synthesizers,3ch0fu,The0Justinian,6,Tue Jul 7 21:04:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going to want to see more before I make any decisions... I jumped on the anti-Aira train and now own three Aira products.    The keyboard that has me most interested is probably the DX but my issue is the fact that I have a TX81Z that is loaded with classic presets and has a ton of editors available.  I just don't see what the DX keyboard can really offer me...  There is the ""ease of editing"" on-board with that LCD screen (which does look nice), but for me, if I want ease of editing FM synthesis, I have FM8.  I know it's not hardware, but between that and my TX81Z, I feel like I'm pretty well covered in the FM market.    These TX81Zs are going for $100 on ebay...  4 operator, classic Yamaha rackmount synth...  I'm not trying to bag on the DX, I'm just really curious how, if at all, it will fit into my setup.  The CS sounded okay...  I'll have to read more about it; especially regarding the polyphony.  I have a System 1m (which has limited polyphony) and a Blofeld which sounds great but is a but cumbersome to program, so maybe having a very tactile synth like the CS would be a decent addition...    But again, there are a lot of other synths out there that are much more tempting at these price points (my current GAS is for a DSI Evolver)."
synthesizers,3ch0fu,damien6,4,Wed Jul 8 00:28:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the tangent, but how are you liking the System-1m? I was gonna buy a Blofeld module (had the keyboard version before and liked it enough) but decided to wait and see what Yamaha had in store with Reface. In the meantime I realized I hadn't given the System-1 a fair shake, and the desktop 1m looks like fun. Have they ironed out most of the initial problems they had upon release?"
synthesizers,3ch0fu,slujj-vohaul,3,Wed Jul 8 00:50:51 2015 UTC,"I definitely expressed some of my frustrations and complaints when I first got the System 1m...  Roland was a bit frustrating to deal with and the roll-out seemed to be a bit bungled.  The left hand didn't seem to have any idea what the right was doing.  Now that the v1.20 update has been released and I've been able to get the Plug Outs at the discounted rate (and working in Ableton Live 9 on Windows) I'm really enjoying this synth.    The new waveforms that came with the v1.20 update really open up this synth.  The modulation capabilities are pretty robust.  You have to get a little creative to use them...  Honestly, I feel like I need to spend more time with this synth to get a better understanding of its capabilities; especially give semi-modular nature of the synth.    If your budget is limited and you're interested in a polyphonic synth, I think it's definitely worthy of consideration.  The Plug Out capabilities really opens up the synth even more, but for now, I only have the Promars.  I am really excited for the Sh-101 to finally be released."

But a lot of people will want these. More than the tiny communities of synth geeks with an overgrown sense of entitlement that major companies should spend millions on research just for them. The Reface range will appeal to teenagers getting a band together; bedroom producers with very little space but a need for a good, but small, keyboard; gigging keyboard players who will MIDI this up to a control keyboard for a really good live EP or organ; synth geeks who aren't blinded by the hate and see that the CS sounds awesome and very different, DSP or not (fun fact; I'd rather have an AN1x than a lot of poly analogues, but there you go)  In short, I think people need to get a grip and stop stamping their little feet and throwing toys out of cots just because this wasn't exclusively what they wanted, and quit with the bitchy, negative posts - remember, the mods warned people about gear negativity not that long ago. So don't do it. Chill the fuck out and let other people enjoy these awesome keyboards for what they are, not what you want them to be."

I understand you feel like you're in the minority by having a positive opinion on these things, but I don't think you need to defend these so much, were not on GS so what people are spouting elsewhere is a bit irrelevant here. None of us have used one yet. Let's wait for a proper review.   Edit: Just watched some more demos and the DX does look like a decent bit of kit. Still though, hard to justify when you can get a CZ-101 for $150, and I already have an OP-1 that does some FM stuff.

What is it with people thinking that high grade polycarbonates and decent electromechanical keybeds are somehow free? Yamaha have gone for durability over feature set, and I actually really like the look of the CP and YC models especially, specifically because they are simple. No VA in the world delivers a really, really good electric piano or authentic Hammond sound. Could the CS have been more heavily featured? Yes, at the expense of menu diving, which I guess was part of the design team's brief - keep it at one control per function."

Back in the day they used to develop awesome groundbreakers first and then scale them down for consumers later; GX1 to CS80, DX1 to DX7, etc. But that isn't a sustainable plan, especially when you have a product that flops, or doesn't do that great, like the VL line in teh 90s. So Yamaha got cautious, and now they release the lower end gear to make the money to put into the more niche stuff. Korg do exactly the same; the Monotribe and Volcas are chock full of limitations, but are fun boxes of plastic and bits and make good noises. They are laying the way for the bigger things like the MS20m and Odyssey. Roland used the Aira range (which a  loud minority also bitched incessantly about on GS) and JD-Xi as a way to build interest in their synth lines so they can fund the modular stuff they announced. And Yamaha are doing the same, and arguably they've come in a few steps above Korg 's Volcas with what seem to be some really nicely made and playable keyboards that make amazing sounds and are small enough to drag out to a gig with, or on a train or a bus, or whatever.   I think Yamaha's decision making process here has been perfectly wise; ""Let's make something that we'll sell a lot of so that we can invest that money into something really cool later down the line""."

I think the Reface units sound good, they look solid, and as I don't come from a piano background I really don't care about mini vs full size keys, my issue all comes down to price. If they came out at $300-350 dollars I would have preordered one yesterday.  Also, why are they called Reface? So many people thought it would be a single unit with a swappable faceplate for the different models and that would have been awesome. In fact $500 for a unit with 1 face plate, then an extra 100-150 for new faceplates plus a firmware update download similar to the system-1?

The old analog polys people love cost as much as a car in the 1980s. $1,000 was entry level for hardware for most of history. Now people think $750 is expensive.   If hardware is just plugins in flimsy boxes it's pointless. The technology or interface has to be awesome else just stay in the box. That costs money.   Also a generation of people with pirated plugins have forgotten that 3 synths used to be a lot. The classic synth players people idolize had almost no polyphony or options compared to anyone with a laptop today. Even the collectors like Vince Clarke only got that way once they'd made their money.   You can make great music with a couple of boards and a computer. To judge hardware as if you should expect to have 10 pieces of outboard is crazy. Worst of all it's a distraction.   If something seems like bad value to you it's not something you should buy.

I think for what they are, they each offer a fairly broad range of sounds that would be useful, at least to me. That price though... Whew! Anyway, I'll be at the bottom of this post if you need me."

There's VSTs with more bottom than that. Nick seemed to echo that. Could be wrong.  The DX sounds good though.  Interesting editing method. Seems to be the pick of the litter in my opinion.

synthesizers,3chebk,JDilly,4,Tue Jul 7 22:44:44 2015 UTC,"You should be able to get a flat-line on any scope simply by powering it up.  Set the trigger to minimum and adjust the vertical position setting.  The big problem with scopes of this age is the electrolytic capacitors.  They leak, sending the bias high on the tubes, which can fry them in short order.  This is why with any tube gear you really want to replace all the capacitors before powering it up.  Replacing the caps is generally cheap and fairly easy.  Replacing the tubes can get expensive.  Even if the scope is working now, I would really recommend replacing the caps as soon as possible."

synthesizers,3cgvtm,Biopharmer,6,Tue Jul 7 21:26:12 2015 UTC,I think each operator can feed back on itself regardless of algorithm. At least that's what I think I heard.

What I had to do was to use one of the Mac OS features and create what they call an ""Aggregate Audio Device.""  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202000  That's where you create a virtual audio interface by combining multiple physical audio interfaces. So just google around for that and you'll find instructions. I had to create an aggregate device so that my Presonus interface, TR-8 and USB turntable were all useable at the same time in Reaper.  Once you have the aggregate device created, you select it in Reaper, and at least for me, it all worked.  Also, if you're using the TR-8 via USB, do not let your computer go to sleep. Pretty irritating bug in the TR-8 firmware will lock up the TR-8, and require a full reboot of your computer and drum machine to get everything back into working order."

synthesizers,3cfkh3,SleepingHeap,3,Tue Jul 7 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"It predates acid-house, mainly. Does it sound similar in many ways? Yeah, definitely. Can it really be one and the same? Nah. It's like calling The Stooges ""punk rock"" or Karlheinz Stockhausen ""IDM."" The similarities and possible influence are hard to deny, but all the elements hadn't coalesced into a unified genre yet."
synthesizers,3cfkh3,jepyang,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:20:39 2015 UTC,"I meant musically.  I'm sure people would argue (and I know some certainly do) that that the Stooges were punk rock. As for Stockhausen, I would classify his sound more as experimental drone than ""IDM"" (very beat orientated) and I don't think anyone would have much to say if I described it as such.  Don't get me wrong I know exactly your point and it's a fair one  but I think it ignores this part of my question:   I mean in terms of strictly speaking about its sound and not its artist's intention or whatever official genre its been given?   What differentiates it strictly musically speaking was what I wanted to question."
synthesizers,3cfkh3,SleepingHeap,2,Wed Jul 8 12:59:26 2015 UTC,"Well, that's what I'm saying. Musically, it doesn't quite fit the paradigm of acid house, which makes perfect sense because that paradigm didn't exist yet.  The biggest difference between this and acid house is that he's just using the 303 as a static sequence, while all the motion in the music happens on top. There's no resonance to the bassline and there's no tweaking of cutoff or envelope. For acid house, you've got to play the knobs like an instrument in and of themselves.  Additionally, the musical sophistication here is well beyond what you hear in most acid house, and sticks rather strictly to Indian classical music paradigms (aside from the instrumentation), which is something that never existed in acid house.  Plus it sounds like he actually understood how to program the 303's sequencer, which automatically places him outside of the acid paradigm ;)"
synthesizers,3cfkh3,jepyang,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:09:17 2015 UTC,Some acid house tunes would have a static 303 sequence throughout (to be a pedant about it) but yeah they would still always have a good bit of resonance and more bite.  I did realise that there was more to it than just standard acid house. I think I've just got a hangup about what makes something or doesn't make something a certain genre.. and just genre's in general tbh!
synthesizers,3cfkh3,SleepingHeap,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:26:18 2015 UTC,"I think one of the other comments classified it best: ""proto-acid.""

synthesizers,3cfkh3,jepyang,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:32:58 2015 UTC,Cos really music genres aren't (strictly speaking) about particular sounds/gear but what its generally agreed people are talking about when they use the genre name. Hence why they gets fuzzy around the edges.

I have made some breadboard noise makers similar to this too, i wouldn't say it's a very complex circuit. Could be the perfect first foray into Mods/bending.

Manufacturers try to put the noise floor below the sensitivity of human hearing, but in a lot of cases, especially with analog synths, it may be faintly audible. Other factors can affect the level of the noise floor too, such as temperature, EM interference, dirty power sources, and impedance of your listening device.

I investigate patches when I find an element that I like though and try to extract that and create a patch of my own where that element is the central peice.  As for getting some variation to your patches:  Try to limit yourself by setting restrictions on what parts of the voice you can use like turning of one of the osc's off completely or just ignore the envelopes completely.

synthesizers,3cetva,rediphile,4,Tue Jul 7 16:26:09 2015 UTC,"i find it more helpful to use presets when focusing on song writing.  if i get a bass sound that is very close to what i want, i'm not going to spend 20 minutes tweaking it just for a sketch.  if the song ends up being a keeper, i'll go back and revisit the bass sound and see if i can improve it.  once i have a rough draft of the song that i really like then I'll spend some time doing sound design.  i guess at the end of the day you have to decide, am i making my music hoping that non musicians will hear it and say ""wow, what a great song"" or are you making music so that musicians will hear your song and say ""wow, this person didn't use ANY presets!"""
synthesizers,3cetva,differentclass,4,Tue Jul 7 17:27:15 2015 UTC,"What are you using? Could you maybe INIT, tweak one setting hard (say, an audio rate LFO or something) and work back from there? FWIW I wander between both approaches."

synthesizers,3cetva,t0xicd0g,5,Tue Jul 7 18:51:24 2015 UTC,"From scratch every time. I find most presets unusable for myself simply because i didn't have the core of the idea for it myself. Even if my patch ends up sounding like one of the factory patches, I will at least have arrived there myself and know exactly how I got there. I'm very big on sound design, it's one of the reasons I prefer synths with a lot of tools in this area, like the Korg Z1 (terrible presets, but amazing for creating otherworldly patches that you just couldn't make on anything else) and Tetra (analogue poly with so many mod routings that allow me to sculpt whatever I want - again, the presets suck), and why I tend to not like machines like the Juno 106 which sounds lovely but for me is so basic it's practically unusable for more than a couple of days.  It's why I like synths instead of romplers, the endless possibilities of programming them are a huge part of what makes the music your own."

synthesizers,3cetva,KingsCountyLightHaus,2,Tue Jul 7 17:41:45 2015 UTC,"I've been mostly from scratch for the past 5 or 6 years. It really makes you learn by ear what each parameter does so now i can hear a preset and hear the waveform and modulations. It's good to understand the basics: waveforms, envelopes, filtering, and LFO mods. Then experiment until your brain finds a ""sweet spot"" for each parameter. Once you have a great patch, save it and use it as a preset for the future!"

Then again, it's probably easier than trying to analyze a preset on that wonderful two digit LED display.  I'll try out presets to get an idea of what the synth I'm working with can do or if I'm stuck trying to get a certain kind of sound and need a reference, but I never use them. Just personal preference."
synthesizers,3cg8uv,capin_howdy,6,Tue Jul 7 17:54:26 2015 UTC,I don't know the answer to your question but I will say that the tactility of the OP-1 is an entirely different experience. I've tried and tried to use an iPad for music and I just can't get past the fact that it's flat. Knobs on a touch interface just don't work right.
synthesizers,3cg8uv,meowbarkhiss,5,Tue Jul 7 18:02:48 2015 UTC,"Knobs on iOS apps are often frustrating, and there's no real consistency of approach - some turn like real knobs, some use up and down, and so on. Hop from app to app and you can easily get confused with different UIs.  But there are plenty of apps that use touch-based controls, which can be perfect for the iPad - Samplr and Borderlands come to mind immediately. They use the surface brilliantly and the end result is an app that's at home on the iPad, and wouldn't really work anywhere else.  Apps like iSem sound great, but their insistence on skeuomorphic interfaces can be irritating. To me, at least - for all I know the familiarity of a modelled real-world interface is popular with the majority of app-buyers, and I'm in the wrong. I just enjoy an app far more when it feels like it's making the best use of the equipment."
synthesizers,3cg8uv,3lbFlax,7,Tue Jul 7 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"an iPad with the right app probably isn't entirely a different experience.    Nah, it entirely is.   Is there an app that is close to the functionality found on a TE OP-1?   Definitely not. There are some cool apps out there but nothing like the OP-1. Closest, but sill very different, would probably be Korg Gadget."
synthesizers,3cg8uv,slujj-vohaul,5,Tue Jul 7 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"i have both an iPad and an OP-1. there is nothing on the iPad that compares to the package the OP-1 provides. there are some great music apps on the iPad, and i have many of them. but i play with my OP-1 way more than my iPad's music apps. the tactile experience plus the unique features on the OP-1 make it more attractive, at least to me. just tapping and dragging on a screen just isn't the same."

They might be bargains. Every synth has a price, the Monotrons proved that. And the world is full of cheap Yamaha synths from the 80s.

I mean to me there is not much new going on there.

If you want a digital synth, I've got the Korg DSS-1 which can do an incredible job at replicating other synths (owing to it's nature as a sampler-synth). There is a boatload of preset disks on the web, and this website might help you out. His GS-001 Analog Performance set (the first download) has a patch in the digital section which is a sampling of the Fantasia patch. Sounds exactly like the real thing!

The Sidrax provides most of the sound, being fed into the Octatrack. The Electribe is used for some ambient stuff near the end.  The Octatrack is being used as a looper/effects machine/mangler. I set up flex machines with one shot recording triggers to loop what I would play on the Sidrax. I set up different effects, triggers, parameter locks, LFOs on each track. Some were just looping exactly what I played with reverb and filtering added and some had random triggers with random starting points on the loop to get a glitchy effect. I could reset and re-record the loops with the press of a button thanks to the one shot recorder trigs."

So check what's being send to it using a midi monitor and make sure you are not using the USB on the minotaur."

Then my Streichfett and Blofeld are USB'd into the setup and I send all the MIDI for those two through MIDI. It's nice to have the USB option with those two, as they don't have any thru which suuuuucks.  Then everything gets controlled via my KX88 I picked up a few months back.

synthesizers,3cbgoj,xmnstr,4,Mon Jul 6 18:49:04 2015 UTC,Hardware MIDI through doesn't introduce any perceivable latency. It's literally just an optocoupler between two circuits.

synthesizers,3cbgoj,kisielk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:12:31 2015 UTC,It most certainly does for notes. It's the nature of the protocol. You can't send more than one signal at once.
synthesizers,3cbgoj,xmnstr,2,Tue Jul 7 06:59:59 2015 UTC,"While the MIDI link itself can introduce noticeable delays (usually only in older instruments which used slower microprocessors to generate the serial data), taking approximately 0.001s to transmit a 3-byte 'Note On' message; the only delay associated with a hardware thru port is what's known as the propagation delay for CMOS logic. This, according to the 4049 data sheet (the recommended part as per the MIDI spec), is typically around 32 nanoseconds - that's 0.0032% of the time it takes for a MIDI message to be sent. There's no way you'd notice a delay caused by hardware thru circuitry."
synthesizers,3cbgoj,jackmaster_swag,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:54:48 2015 UTC,The problem isn't the thru circuitry itself but sending lots of MIDI data on the same port. That's where you get latency.
synthesizers,3cbgoj,xmnstr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:58:56 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, MIDI is a pretty slow system and sending lots of data will slow it down, but chaining devices would not have any impact on the already present delay."
synthesizers,3cbgoj,jackmaster_swag,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:14:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does, because you add one more device to the chain that needs to have data sent to it."

I have midi inputs coming from the OT, MPC 1000, iPad, and Novation Remote 37SL, as well as a few other synths so I can play them into my sequencers. The Octatrack and MPC are responsible for all of the sequencing, and I have some of my multitimbral gear  set up to only respond to the second output of the MPC, which eliminates channel conflicts-great for just using something like the RM50 and Turbo Phatt for beats and bass; I've got some other setups created so I can switch some of those instruments around for sequencing from the Octatrack.   Just about everything gets clocked and sequenced via the patchbays, but I also connect my Monomachine and Machinedrum to my Octatrack via Thru>In. Currently, I'm using the midi out from the Mono to control a Korg KP3, as well as program changes for an Alesis Midiverb 1 and Midifex. The Machinedrum is being used to sequence my other FX units, which really opens up some options, and keeps them separate from channel conflicts with my other gear.

Within a continuous live set, I'd like to switch between purposefully playing notes into the MPC to sequence a Moog for bass, then for the next song, using knobs to sequence kinda happy accidents into the same Moog on the Beatstep Pro. Any advice on that, using two sequencers on one instrument?   I'm also curious what you do with the MNM into KP3 and what type of effects sequencing you use the MD for.

synthesizers,3cbgoj,BonjourMyFriends,2,Tue Jul 7 09:15:51 2015 UTC,"I can answer this as I have a MPC1000 and a Beatstep. Its not the pro but it should work the same way.  The MPC has two modes midi channel wise, normal and then channels 1-32 are set to midi A and B 1-16.  I use the first mode and have active track set to on. This means that I have to be on the track that is controlling what ever effects, synth etc. Of course this means I can sequence stuff one on track and I can not then go to another and use knobs to control stuff through mpc with out the sequence playing. Now with the Beatstep pro I would assume you could get around this and do both at the same time and just set it to first midi receive setting..you want and turn off active track on MPC>this will mean your set channels don't change.  I use JJOS as well so I have this thing called midi note to button. I set it up so that I can hit a pad on the beatstep and this changes the track (use only 16 or so) on the MPC and I can either use knobs that sends CCs or sequence. I have to turn that mode of when i use sequencer though as if I send any off those notes MPC goes to another track. I turn it on and off as I work, allows me to layer control changes with lots of stuff after i made a sequence.. good fun"
synthesizers,3cbgoj,bliprock,2,Tue Jul 7 12:25:19 2015 UTC,"Most of my gear is set up so it can be sequenced from either source. It should not be an issue to use one or the other-I've used the Octatrack and MPC to sequence the BS2 within the same song, although obviously you wouldn't want to run both sequences at the same time on a monophonic synth (or maybe you would, if there was some stylistic choice, but I digress). All the receiving instrument will listen to is the note information coming form whatever source, so using multiple sequencers shouldn't be a problem.  Basically, almost everything can be controlled from either the 8 midi tracks of the Octatrack, or the 16 tracks from MPC output A. Thus, I can assign what I want at will. I have a handful of things assigned only to MPC output B-namely the RM50, R-8M, and input B from the Turbo Phatt. I have some other alternative configurations saved as well, so that I can sequence the RM50 from the OT, etc.   I made a quick, crappy video last year of how I use the Monomachine to control the KP3. I've since finessed this down a bit, but basically I have CCs set to control the X, Y, and Pad Touch parameters of the KP3. Generally, I assign LFOs to the X and Y parameters, and p-lock the Pad Touch. I love doing this using the looper presets on drums, to create some cool fills. In the video above, you can see that I do this with program change as well, which can get some real nutty glitch going. Using the KP3 like this basically is treating it like a hardware version of Effectrix by Sugar Bytes. The same thing basically applies to any of my other effects sequenced from the MDUW: just p-locking and automating different parameters, etc."

In order to free up some space on my MOTU I'm looking at getting a MIDI thru box that will split the MIDI out signal from the MOTU to the TR8 and TB3.  That shouldn't be an issue, right?"

I can excuse minikeys a little more on something monophonic, but to play full keyboard/piano parts on the CP or DX would just suck.  I guess they'll be ""modules"" but at that rate, why not cut off the keys for us and give us a few more controls?  I like the idea of digitally modeled CS-80 and CP-70s though, the DX was always digital so that doesn't matter.  There are pretty limited options for doing a CP-70 these days, and I can only thing of the CS-80 from Arturia for a CS emulation.  These are long overdue!  But the DX needs a better interface especially.  I'm going to feel encouraged NOT to buy them because I know that in a year or two they might be replaced by revamped versions with the same audio engine but more controls and full keys or modules."

synthesizers,3ca71k,termites2,11,Tue Jul 7 07:12:16 2015 UTC,"So sad they seemed to have missed the important points again. I used to create original sounds on the DX7 back in the 80's and there are two things I found essential:   Direct adjustment controls for a few parameters Six operators   I get the feeling Yamaha don't really know themselves (or lost the knowledge over time) what to do with FM. All their ""simplified"" versions of FM just made it dull and less interesting. And now this.   I wrote some ideas in a reply to my comment, that I have moved below to clarify this post  This is how my thinking goes:   4-op FM has a fairly limited sound palette compared to 6-op You could cut back on algorithms, the important to keep are the 2- 3- and 4-stack combinations, and they could be reduced to a few versions Four knobs that can be reassigned to control different parameter groups via dedicated buttons. For example: An EG button would turn them into ADSR for carriers, then you could have buttons to switch between controlling all modulator outputs, all relative modulator frequency ratios, etc . The DX7 would have been immensely more simple to program if they had built it with 4 or 6 reassignable sliders instead of just one. Knobs in ""performance mode"" would be assigned to ""good"" values such as modulator outputs, which makes sense to modulate A loop sequencer where parameters can be locked when recording, or ""motion recorded"" A tiny OLED display showing the generated waveform in real time (possible as everything is done through reading sine data from a table, but would elevate cost)   Something like that, at least."

Line out + midi makes them modules for those who just want those sounds.   And compared to the volcas, these have keys instead of a sequencer, which is a fair trade.   Trust me, if the price is low enough, they'll sell. I doubt they'll be as cheap as the volcas, but I don't think they're quite intended to compete with the microkorg/mininova/JD-Xi either.

The things that made these synths great was the creativity and engineering within the constraints of the technology of the time. That creativity was necessarily within the analog / electro-acoustic domain.  There is a timeless quality to that domain, the same quality you get from an acoustic guitar or a flute. It's fundamental, and of the same fabric of physical reality we all share.  DSP takes away the physical constraints and lands you in an abstract, unbounded space.  I don't want a DSP emulation of the CS/CP/YC, I want the simplicity and purity of an instrument in harmony with natural phenomena."

I'm also curious about the data entry controllers. Perhaps they are alright, but knobs or sliders would've been much better, obviously.

synthesizers,3ccigc,2smashed4u,4,Mon Jul 6 21:05:49 2015 UTC,"They just tried to rip you off.  Potenciometers are pretty simple to replace. You'll need three things: a soldering iron, a soldering pump (to remove the excess solder) and (maybe) a replacement pot with the same characteristics (including type).  Pots come in two types: linear and logarythmic, and putting one of a different type will make your synth behave in a different (bad) way.  After desoldering you may have two options: ""fix"" the pot (because most times it is simply untidy) or exchanging for one with the same electrical characteristics and similar enough form factor to be assembled without problems.  I'd like to tell you that if you want to open your synth you'd better use a megnetized screwdriver and be attentive to the number and order of the screws you unscrewed. Some manufactures make special screws that have an inverted spiral (so you're screwing them more when you think you're unscrewing), so take care and don't use a bigger than normal amount of force.  And happy circuit bending!"
synthesizers,3ccigc,Taupter,3,Mon Jul 6 21:32:51 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah DSI sent me a replacement pot so its the exact one. I dont think the shop was trying to rip me off per se, I just don't think they do synths a lot. I mean, the guy working said as much, but he also told me over the phone before I came in that they could definitely do it. He's a little spacey, good dude though. I just don't think the tech knew how to do it."
synthesizers,3ccigc,kisielk,2,Mon Jul 6 21:44:12 2015 UTC,"The DSI synths are pretty easy to take apart. It's mostly s matter of removing all the knobs from the pots, opening up the synth, detaching a few cables between circuit boards, and then removing the front panel board from the chassis. Probably an hour of labour max even if you take it slow. For someone who knows what they are doing it should be a lot quicker. There's surprisingly little inside the box, so it's not like dealing with a vintage synth that has a ton of wiring and many circuit boards."
synthesizers,3ccigc,hafilax,3,Mon Jul 6 23:23:03 2015 UTC,It can be really simple yet still expensive if it's labour intensive (lots of fiddly screws).

synthesizers,3ccigc,explodedsun,3,Mon Jul 6 22:35:21 2015 UTC,"Any tech worth his salt can replace a pot. That said, I do some repair work on the side and in general for small repairs, 85-90% of labor time is taking the thing apart and putting it back together again.  I just looked up your synth and it looks like a pain in the ass to get apart. You might have 1-1.5h wrapped up into getting in and out of there depending on what the inside looks like. It's not 2 knobs and 8 screws like replacing the pot on a guitar."

The kp3 is wonderful for looping short samples out of other synths or drum machines, especially if the synth doesn't have a sequencer of its own (edit: oh yeah, it's also an effects processor, some of the effects are quite decent.  Many loopers, delays, reverbs, filters, something for everyone).  Kaossilator pro is basically a toy, to me its strengths lie in fx and arpeggiated synth or bass.  Kpquad is pure effects modulator and if you can get a good deal on one they're pretty cool.  Kp3 and k-pro share a lot of functionality.  Lean towards kp3 if you want to sample, and k-pro if you want to create.  K-pro and kp3 work well together as its own sort of instrument, it's a lot of fun but doesn't seem to really result in anything noteworthy for me (ymmv, obviously, lots of cool stuff on YouTube)  The only thing with the kp3 and k-pro is that you have to have decent timing and know the gear in order to set up your loops in sync with what your drum machine or other gear is doing.  Also the kp3 has a slight drift that you'll need to correct once every minute or so depending on what you're doing with it.  I didn't reset the pads playing in the above tune, as long as what's going through isn't percussion oriented you don't need to really worry about it.  No regrets on my end, although I only paid about $500 cdn or so total for the 3 pads, which to me is a steal.  The mini kp/kaossilators are a great way to test the water, you can get great deals on used ones and they carry a lot of the functionality of their larger counterparts.  Plus they run on batteries!  Hope that helps!"

I also at one point made a quick patch to map actual midi note numbers from my midi keyboard to x,y coordinates to play the right notes on the synth patches.  Does anyone know how those saw sounds are synthesized? It's honestly kind of weird that they even put that tiny amount of synth in it, but never did anything else along those lines on kp3."

synthesizers,3cafsc,-main,3,Mon Jul 6 21:50:20 2015 UTC,"They're a family of Korg products, that all have a big touch pad as the main means of interaction.   There are two product lines:  Kaoss Pad  These have red accents and are digital multifx boxes, with a focus on loopers and dj fx. Some models can also record and/or play back samples. The touch pad generally controls two parameters for the effect, one on the X axis and one on the Y, but there are variations - isolators that divide the pad into three (bass, mids, highs) for example. Models you can buy right now include the minikp2s, KP3+, and the Kaoss Pad Quad.   Kaossilator  These have yellow accents and are preset-browsing synthesizers with a built in looper(s). The pad controls note and timbre. Models you can buy right now include the Kaossilator Pro, and the minikaossilator2.     New electribes can kinda do either one on their touchpad. There's also Kaoss DJ mixers that have Kaoss Pad fx built in.   I'd say that Kaoss Pad is just a pretty good line of fx/looper boxes. Good anywhere where you'd use a digital multifx box - like let's say you want hardware for every common effect, with hands on interaction, without dropping $2000 on guitar pedals. The loopers are nice too, I'm going to experiment with using looped sections to cover pattern changes and transposition when playing live. They're popular with DJs. You could also use them to play backing tracks, or for karaoke.   I've never seen the appeal of the Kaossilators, but some people like them. The touch pad interface just seems awkward for playing notes. That said it does lead to unique results, and some people put the time in to learn to play them well. Or you can just use them to come up with short phrases that are then edited and expanded on to make tracks.   You start by looking them up and watching reviews on youtube and deciding if you'd have a use for them."

synthesizers,3c8ub7,hot-pocket,2,Mon Jul 6 00:35:10 2015 UTC,"I've got a fair bit of experience with vocoders. If you're not too familiar with using them I'd suggest starting with cheap/free options until you get used to how they work. I started with Ableton's built in effect then moved onto Image Line's Vocodex VST, from there I bought a Roland VP7 and most recently a V256 by Electro Harmonix. It took me a couple of years of experimenting with different options to work out exactly what I wanted, but for me the V256 is the one!  I've watched videos of the Roland VP-330 in action too and it sounds so classic, but way out of my price range.  Hope that helps in some way anyway."
synthesizers,3c8ub7,splitradix,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"I'd consider myself an advanced amateur vocoder user. Ive got an EMS 2000, a Roland SVC350, and I use the Nord Modular's vocoder a bit too. The EMS 2000 is my favourite. The main thing nobody ever told me but I figured it out is that different voices give very different results. I have a bit of a raspy voice and I'm not a singer, so I don't sound great through the vocoder, but a friend of mine who is a singer sounds much better through it than me. A little compression on the vocal going in and then more compression on the vocoded signal coming out helps too. I usually use a Roland MKS80 as the synth input, always saw, filter almost totally off. This is the best example I recorded I think the singer's vocals, not mine: https://virtualurbanrecords.bandcamp.com/track/one-eighty"

I wouldn't build a PC without one at this point. They just make day to day use so much more pleasant.  You can always buy a small-ish one for the operating system and put larger files and programs on a separate hard drive. That's a pretty common practice since SSDs over 512GB are rather expensive.   2) An i5 should definitely be enough for most cases. You could max it out with an epic number of VSTs playing a lot of notes simultaneously, but it's unlikely.  3) I wouldn't bother with a separate sound card. The one built into the motherboard should be enough for non-recording purposes. Like you said, you're using an external audio interface anyways.  Hope this helps!

synthesizers,3c7h69,osopeligroso,3,Sun Jul 5 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"I just built an i7-5820K-based DAW PC a couple weeks ago.  An SSD will mainly only help for booting OS and launching apps, but I bit the bullet on a new Intel 750 Series PCIe SSD for my boot drive, and it's been quite nice (and so quiet!)  An i5 will certainly work. Someone else here already mentioned the Intel NUC, and I have tested NUCs for suitability as a DAW computer, but an i7 from the current or previous generation will let you run more plugins without bouncing/freezing tracks; in that way a faster processor can streamline your workflow.  As others have mentioned, whatever built-in audio comes with your computer is fine as long as you plan to use an actual audio interface for music production. USB interfaces are fine (I like Roland, Steinberg, MOTU and RME).  If you're mostly doing music you can get away with getting just a cheap crappy video card- you can save money there. Also, if you settle on your parts before buying you can probably calculate the minimum amount of power you need, which would enable you to save some money on power supplies (lower power is usually less $$$). Don't know about Windows 8's limitations on memory, but with Windows 7 (which I'm, using) only Pro or above support more than 16GB RAM. I'd consider 8GB a bare minimum for a new DAW PC. I'm currently using 16 (2 8GB DDR4 sticks).  If you're trying to keep the budget down, look at a previous-generation i7 (those MOBOs and their RAM are cheaper than the newer X99 stuff for current generation), get the smallest power supply that will suit your needs, skimp on the graphics... but try to get the fastest processor that will fit in your budget. Also, some people still say ""more cores doesn't matter in audio."" That isn't true. Cubase, for example, perfectly distributes the load across all cores/logical processors. More cores/threads definitely means more power for modern audio apps... so both cores and clock speed matter. EDIT: Oh, and skip the SSD if you're trying to keep the price down! Yes, they boot faster, but unless you spend most of your day booting Windows and launching apps, your money is better spent elsewhere. 7200RPM or faster HDs are still solid performers and physical drives today actually perform better today than ones made a few years ago; they're still improving, even if they can't ever match SSD speeds."

An SSD big enough for the OS and apps is only going to run you about $60-80. Totally worth it for being more responsive.

In just using your PC you will find it is a LOT more responsive with an SSD than without, and you'll probably never want to a PC without one again. I do recommend a separate HDD for data storage, a 1TB HDD costs like 60 bucks and can store a lot of audio. a 1TB SSD on the other hand costs an arm, a leg and possibly a testicle.  Higher-end i5 is plenty fast.   A decent sound card is nice to have if you actually intend on using it, but I would try to off-load the audio IO to your external audio interface as much as possible. If you never end up using your PC sound card for anything important than getting a fancy one is a waste of money."
synthesizers,3c7h69,Sylph,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:09:18 2015 UTC,"Would a decent sound card work fine since an audio interface would be needed anyways?   Yeah, don't worry about the onboard sound card at all, you won't be using it much. You'll want a big external sound card, with a bunch of inputs depending on how much you want to do.   Would a SSD help with processing at all?   Your programs will start faster, but you'll probably be saving to a disk. I recommend setting up a cheap software RAID mirror - it's performant enough for recording quite a few channels at a time, especially considering that most of that is buffered into memory on its way to disk. Having a mirror means one of the disks can die and you don't lose everything; trust me, it can save your ass.  At ~200kb/sec, a five minute take is 60mb per channel of raw data; even with ten separate channels going, that's less than a gig. You'll have 16gb, I'm sure.  Really, performance issues are mostly a thing of the past. As long as you get a good audio interface that itself can handle the number of channels you need, you'll be solid. So buy a small cheap SSD and two big disks.  i5 is fine; you'd have to use a retarded number of effects and channels to max that out in any decent software.  I like MOTU gear and was able to pick up a 2408 eight-channel box with PCI card for $100. Watch craigslist and you'll be surprised the thoroughly-decent things people are letting go for cheap locally."
synthesizers,3c7h69,moravec-transfer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:58:14 2015 UTC,"An SSD will help because it loads things much faster. If it's just for recording, then an i5 is plenty. But if you use a lot of VSTs (instruments, effects), then I would recommend an AMD FX-8350 (budget option for 8-core processor), or an i7 (if you want to spend more). No need for a sound card. Onboard sound is decent enough and you will use an external audio interface anyway.   Also, you don't need heavy graphics for this. Onboard will do, or get a simple and passively cooled GPU."

But if you use a lot of VSTs (instruments, effects), then I would recommend an AMD FX-8350 (budget option for 8-core processor), or an i7 (if you want to spend more).   This sort of depends a lot on what you're doing. The FX-8350 has a massive 160w TDP, and it doesn't have a built in GPU either so you have to get a graphics card which is going to put out even more heat inside the case. Either the AMD system is going to be loud, or you're going to spend a boatload extra on a good water loop.  Since current Intel processors kick the shit out of current AMD processors in terms of single-threaded performance, and not all computing lends itself to parallel processing, you'll find that in the real-world the AMD is almost always going to be slower.  In Ableton, how your tracks are routed changes how the program does multithreading. If you have one channel with a boatload of processor-intensive effects on it all in a chain, throwing more cores at it isn't going to do anything because the computer needs to calculate what effect #1 does to the sound before it can figure out what effect #2 will do and so on. I think you'd be hard pressed to consistently use your software in ways which would take advantage of the AMD's extra cores over a 4-core hyperthreaded xeon or core i7. Depending on which Intel chip we're looking at, the AMD may never beat it, even with four extra cores in an optimum scenario, because of how much faster the intel chips are. The xeon I have appears to be this way. Far faster in single-threaded benchmarks, and about even in multithreaded benchmarks, even despite having half the physical cores"

I used this rackmount case, an AMD Phenom II Quad 3.2GHz processor, and a motherboard with onboard sound and no-onboard graphics. I decided to go with a dedicated graphics card because I was also doing more Photoshop/InDesign/Illustrator work at the time. However I went with a passively cooled ASUS card which ended up not being that beefy anyway, and as a result of the passive cooling it runs on the hotter side and heats up my whole system, so in the end I probably would have done integrated graphics if I could do it all over again. And I did onboard sound because I was using an external audio interface (Motu firewire at the time of build, then E-MU PCI, now another RME PCI). I just upgraded my main system drive to an SSD about two months ago and it is very much worth the time and expense. I also ""upgraded"" my processor fan/heatsink from a Noctua NH-U9B SE2 to a Noctua NH-D9L plus two Noctua NF-R8 case fans. I had been just using the two large fans on the NH-U9B which was whisper silent, but everything was running a little hot and the airflow was wrong for my case orientation so I went with the NH-D9L's one fan in the correct orientation feeding out of the two small NF-R8s. Now everything is very happy temperature wise and is only slightly louder (still very very quiet). The two new fan purchases along with the SSD ran me ~$200, and back in 2010 I spent ~$500 at NewEgg. That doesn't account for some drives that I already had lying around that I used for mass storage, and doesn't account the monitor that I already had, but for ~$700 I got a solid case, power supply, mobo, processor, RAM, graphics card, fans, system drive, and even some thermal paste!"

I'm currently saving up to a Minibrute but have been a little on and off whether I should get a midi controller and an A4 instead.  It would be super practical for me to store patches and use several voices at once but I doubt I would find the Elektron workflow particularily inspiring as a synth (I already have the Analog Rytm) which is why I believe a Brute would work great for me since I want to have the control functions all laid out in front of me.  But then again, that sequencer though.. I make both rock/industrial music and ambient techno which is why it's so difficult for me to decide which one to get. I would get both if I could afford it."

On a more serious note, the EA1 is a very limited synth based on the MS2000/MicroKorg engine, with minimal control over envelopes, no LFOs or other modulation sources, and two oscillators that can be ring modulated, cross modulated, or synced. It's not an amazing pick as a first synth as there's not much room for you to learn how synthesis works, but it is a great groovebox when paired with a drum machine, and the sequencer is lots of fun (if tricky to learn how to program at first in step mode)."

Heavy use of chorus or delay will help most your sounds. But interesting sounds are definitely possible on this.

synthesizers,3c6v65,edototo,9,Sun Jul 5 12:13:16 2015 UTC,"So would I just be better off getting a MicroBrute, which would help me understand, but I fear wouldn't be any use in recording or song-writing as it sounds quite abrasive and has those tiny keys.   Short answer: Yes. The Microbrute does a very good job of putting everything out in front of you. Some of its parameters are particular to the brute series (the ""metallizer"" wave folder on the triangle wave output of the oscillator, for instance, and the ""Brute factor"" feedback loop). But in general, analog subtractive synthesis skills that you acquire on the Microbrute are easily transferred to any other subtractive synthesizer you use.   To address your two objections:   The Microbrute can sound harsh and aggressive, yes. The mixer section allows you to overdrive the filter easily. Mix values of over 50% for any of the oscillator outputs will begin to overdrive the filter. If you don't want the overdrive, keep that in mind. The brute doesn't have to be brutal; with some programming (and here, some delay and reverb) it can actually sound quite dainty. The micro keys are not great. There's no way around this. But it's a monophonic instrument that does not respond to velocity or aftertouch, only note on/off. This makes micro keys less awful, since the fine control/touch that you might get with a better keyboard is, in many ways, wasted. If the keyboard bothers you that much, you can always use your existing MIDI controller to control the Microbrute. All of the synthesis is going to have to happen from the front panel, anyway.   The JX-3P is an amazing synth, by the way. I have a JX-8P, and I love it. Programming the JX series without a programmer can be a bit tedious, since you can only edit one parameter at a time. I don't mind it, since I'm used to analog synths by now. But it would have been a bit daunting as a novice. Fortunately, there's an iPad app, iPG-800 that turns an iPad into a control surface/programmer for the JX-series synths."
synthesizers,3c6v65,ouij,5,Sun Jul 5 12:41:31 2015 UTC,"The synths you named are decent, but you may also want to consider virtual analog synths too. Analog synths may have got more character in their sound, but for the price you can get decent VA with a lot of modelling and modulation capabilities. In my opinion though synths like Junos may sound great they're quite limited in functionality and what you need is flexibility, ease of use and fun. Sure you should look for one-knob-per-function one, like Korg Ms-2000 or Alesis ION. The latter is the beast, but it could be tricky to find. There're plenty of other decent VA synths, like novation KS series, but the ones I named I like the most. Anyway I'll look for VA the synth with several multimode filters, decent modulation capabilities, sequencer etc."
synthesizers,3c6v65,seqai,5,Sun Jul 5 14:18:15 2015 UTC,"I'll piggyback this response to add that the MicroKorg and Micron are the mini-synth equivalents to the MS-2000 and Ion, respectively.

They are much more versatile, you get tons of polyphony and usually effects.  I'm a Moog Sub 37 owner myself and while it sounds amazing, I would never choose for my first synth."
synthesizers,3c6v65,Gravitom,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:09:05 2015 UTC,I do not own any analoge synths andere been making musical for three years in the box now. I have been saving up for the sub 37 for a while now. And i am going to get it. But why would you not choose it for your first synth? Just curious :)
synthesizers,3c6v65,Dwaalzin,2,Tue Jul 7 21:30:18 2015 UTC,Well it has an amazing tone but it's hard to get a diverse sound out of it. It's a monosynth which has inherent limitations and no effects.  But if you've been making music for three years you probably have a good idea of what you are missing so I don't want to dissuade you.
synthesizers,3c6v65,Gravitom,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:20:45 2015 UTC,"I also see you have a Prophet 12. Is this the kind of Synth that compliments the Sub37 in a way by adding the things to your sounds the Sub37 cannot? Is this why you bought the prophet12? :)  Also, do you use the Sub37 with a DAW and use those effects, or did you buy extra ones externally?"
synthesizers,3c6v65,Dwaalzin,2,Wed Jul 8 14:02:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I think they are great together.  The only thing I'd really like is a good step sequencer.  However I tried out the Analog Four and didn't really like it so maybe it's just not for me.  For effects I run the Prophet into a Kaoss Pad KP3+.  I do this to force myself to be more dynamic with effects.  However I record dry half the time and use my DAW effects.  I do plan on building a Eurorack modular effects unit next.  I'm trying to stay away from building an actually synth though. We'll see what happens :)
synthesizers,3c6v65,Gravitom,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:10:57 2015 UTC,"Alright thanks for the nice info. Doesn't the sub37 has a good step sequencer in there? Or do you mean one that can control all your gear externally? So maybe somethink like the arturia beatstep pro?  And building a modular effect unit is gonna be sweet. Enjoy that rollercoaster ride building it, and then all the rollercoasterrides² listening to the results of playing your synths through there haha."
synthesizers,3c6v65,Dwaalzin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:54:30 2015 UTC,I don't like the step sequencer on the Sub 37.  You have to use all these strange button combinations to do things and it's easy to mess up what you've already done.  It also doesn't display information well on the panel and the display isn't used effectively IMO.  Also it's annoying its on the far the top right.  I'm considering the Beatstep pro actually.  I'm just looking for a little different workflow to mix it up.  What kind of music do you make btw?
synthesizers,3c6v65,Gravitom,3,Wed Jul 8 21:38:30 2015 UTC,"If you really want to go cheap, you can stay in the box and buy a decent midi controller. I have the Akai MPK25, and its buttons and pads are easily mapped to whatever you want. I mostly use it to control outboard gear, but if you've already found some plugin synths you like, then this may be a good starter option. It never hurts to have a good controller anyways.   Pair an MPK25 with a Korg Volca Keys to start and you've got three note polyphony in an easy (and cheap) package."
synthesizers,3c6v65,ACCRETION-of,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:27:45 2015 UTC,"Do you have some sort of audio interface for low latency?  When I was shopping for a midi controller, the Behringer UMA25S beat the rest of the pack out simply because it comes with its own audio interface for the same price."
synthesizers,3c6v65,BigDawgWTF,3,Mon Jul 6 19:40:43 2015 UTC,"Vintage synths are nice and everything, but compared to slightly more modern ones, a lot of them aren't amazing ""all around"" synths unless you're spending $$. In my opinion, it seems like the Juno 106 is overpriced and a little overhyped for what it does, and unless you get one that's been serviced, the voice chips WILL die and you'll have to get it repaired. Some of the ones you mentioned like the JX-3P are cheaper and are great pieces of hardware, but again, they aren't great all around synths and the menu - diving button based interface is gonna be a hindrance on learning synthesis on hardware for the first time.   Microbrute is a good option for learning, I'd say. I have one, and pretty much anytime I play a hardware synth now, I know what's going on or am able to figure it out because of what the microbrute taught me. I don't find that much use for it in the style of music I make, so I use it mainly as a controller or to dick around on (cause it sounds great).   If you have a little extra dough, I'd recommend the Ms20 mini probably. The patch bay side of things is complicated and admittedly I don't really understand it all too well myself, but it's not that necessary and  the part with all the knobs will give you a crazy array of useful/fun sounds and will also be useful to you in learning. It's a mono, but it's great for learning synthesis.   More modern analog polys generally run pretty expensive, but you have the option of virtual analog for much cheaper. Polyphony, many have a ton of knobs and sliders, and they can sound great. Ms2000 or jp8000 would be my recs in that area."
synthesizers,3c6v65,BlueCalx1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:35:01 2015 UTC,"for the price you are looking for, i'd second ms2000. its virtual analog and sounds quite good, is versatile, has many knobs and will teach you a lot about synthesis."
synthesizers,3c6v65,jglong,3,Mon Jul 6 01:02:16 2015 UTC,"If you're into dancier sounds, I'd probably steer well clear of the vintage market. You want hands on control with lots of knobs and the JX3p doesn't give you that by a long way. For about £200-250 you can get a Novation KS4, a Korg MS2000, a Yamaha AN1x, or if you absolutely must go analogue and don't mind being monophonic, Bass Station 2s can be had for around this price too on the used market, and obviously the Microbrute is there too.   Vintage lacks so much that you need for dancier sounds; you can't MIDI sync the LFOs on them for those rhythmic, pulsing sounds; they don't have inbuilt effects very often, and when they do, again you can't MIDI sync the delays; some of them have a worryingly basic MIDI specification and can get confused with a lot of controller data coming down the wire, or only work in omni mode meaning have to run it on a completely separate MIDI setup to the rest of your gear. The early dance artists started off with this stuff out of necessity. It's all they had, and back then it was practically being given away. But they almost all moved on and progressed onto virtual analogues and VSTs because of the potential and power in being able to slave an entire modulation matrix to the MIDI beat."
synthesizers,3c6v65,t0xicd0g,2,Sun Jul 5 17:45:16 2015 UTC,"The JX-3P isn't really an all-rounder. You can't play a patch monophonically, and (relatedly) there's no portamento. So straight away it's not great for bass or lead sounds. It's really geared towards polyphonic patches, so it's good for electric pianos and pads, where the oscillator sync can lead to some interesting places. The chorus is great and the sequencer is good fun, but I wouldn't say it's a great choice as a first / only synth - I think you'd at least need something like a BS2 or 'brute to back it up."
synthesizers,3c6v65,3lbFlax,2,Sun Jul 5 13:48:54 2015 UTC,just gonna add here that I have a jx3p and microbrute and they complement each other nicely!
synthesizers,3c6v65,podblob,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, I imagine clock out from the Microbrute controlling the 3P's sequencer must be great fun. I used to clock my 3P from the TR-707 and it was always a good time - adding swing, removing steps and so on."
synthesizers,3c6v65,3lbFlax,2,Tue Jul 7 16:29:04 2015 UTC,"I think you need to first decide if you want a mono or a poly analog synth. If you just want to learn subtractive synthesis - my advice is to just get a mono - like the MicroBrute - or even a Bass Station 2. If it's chords you want to play - then a poly is your answer - and the JX3P is a great starter - but there is a distinct lack of knobs on this without the controller. Perhaps something more knobby and hands-on might be better for you - like a Korg Poly Six or MonoPoly, Roland Juno's, or something new. Knobby analog poly's are going to set you back some coin.  Another alternative is that you could get a Virtual Analog (VA) synth - and go for one with plenty of knobs - like Roland System-1, Korg Radias, and many others. They will still teach you all about oscillators, filters and LFOs (oh, and don't forget envelopes too!) - are polyphonic and are usually a stack cheaper than analog gear.  Yes, I do think the JD-Xi will be a good start for you."
synthesizers,3c6v65,ranzee,2,Sun Jul 5 14:05:29 2015 UTC,"Someone already mentioned the Gaia. I owned one and its a nice beginner synth (although not analog) because of the one knob per function layout which is a big plus for learning subtractive synthesis. But the retail price is too high imho. Craigslist would be an option.  But here's the thing. My advice would be to consider a maschine. Its also not analog, and its no hardware synth but it has several softwaresynths on board (with Massive a big on too), even a nice drumsynth engine  and they are all automapped on the maschine encoders. You have several synths,  a groovebox with damn fine drumpads, a sampler, sampled instruments (komplete Selection and the later option to crossgrade to komplete) and nice midi controller with daw support (integration as a vst and midi mappings).   Soon after i bought the Gaia i traded it for a maschine studio (you could get the mk2 which is cheaper) and after 2 months i am still amazed every day how versatile it is. Still learning its capabilities.  Now i am looking for my first analog synth too (Prophet08 probably)."

No regrets here.  Other examples  Another one"
synthesizers,3c6v65,thatusernameistaken,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:53:28 2015 UTC,"I have the JD-Xi. It's a great starter synth for sure. However, keep in mind it only has one LFO and is pretty limited by it's lack of physical knobs.   If you want to really learn about synthesis, and less about music arrangement, I'd say the microbrute is the best bet pricewise. If you can step up to the Bass Station or Minibrute, you would probably be happier though.   Another option is buy a midi controller and pick up a solid VST like Zebra or Diva (if your computer can handle them). You already have the DAW experience, and you can map the most important dials on the midi controller to the vst. You can customize the vst's far more than hardware synths, plus you get access to a huge library of pre-made patches as well.   I ended up picking up the Behringer UMA25S in addition to my JD-Xi because it also has an audio interface and I don't need to always route through the JD-Xi for low latency."

The way he uses synths and samples and drum machines along with acoustic instrumentation is nothing short of inspiring!"

synthesizers,3c07xb,Torley_,-1,Fri Jul 3 19:11:51 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree. He takes his signature sound far down every avenue he can, but musically, his compositions tend to be very similar."
synthesizers,3c07xb,NateForTheDeaf,7,Fri Jul 3 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"There are some Trent Tropes for sure. His use of the major I's while taking every chord from the minor scale is almost ubiquitous. Synths and guitars with lots of portamento leading to extremely detuned chords is another feature that's run throughout his career. Pre with-teeth Trent tended to favour distorted acoustic drum sounds loaded into drum machines with a large room reverb, 16th note ostinatos on the bass synth.  That said his carreer has been so long and varied that I don't think it's quite possible to call him inflexible by any stretch. He's almost entirely ditched his sampling of horror movies and other found-noise that used to be THE defining signature of his sound. He's gone from pop style compositions through to the sprawling stream-of-consciousness style shown on the Fragile, back to a more refined pop sensibility a decade later."
synthesizers,3c07xb,Zerocrossing,2,Fri Jul 3 21:15:23 2015 UTC,"I like your analysis.  Also, something he continues to do well is mixing rigidly quantized and looser/live elements — I first learned about the benefits of him doing this in a Keyboard magazine issue years ago."

synthesizers,3c07xb,Lazerface84,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:14:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, there's probably a more technical term for it anyways.  Basically consider the C major scale and all the notes in it (white keys). In traditional kinda pop music, you'll mostly play chord progressions based around chords formed within that scale. So for the D chord you'll play D minor since it's made up of D - F - A. D major would be D - F# - A and the F# isn't a note from the C major scale. Basically the key you are in informs all the other chords you ""can"" or ""should"" play in that key. Playing chords this way is called ""diatonic"" which is latin for ""within the key"".  What Trent often does is play chords that come from the minor scale instead of the major, in spite of keeping the root chord major. It gives a sense of both kinds of harmony and allows for some really interesting harmonic motion. A typical progression would be something like C - Eb - F - Ab which has two non-diatonic chords.  It's very apparent in his piano playing. ""Piggy"" ""The Frail"" and ""Something I can never have"" all use this method but it's really all over his works."

synthesizers,3c0su5,rodentdp,10,Fri Jul 3 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"A couple of months back, I bought an Alesis 3630 from a guy on Craigslist, who mentioned that he had a Juno 106 that he was grudgingly thinking of selling, as he was attached to it but hadn't been using any of his gear for years. Said he knew what they were selling for but that he would sell it for much less since he only paid $300 or so 15 years ago, and I told him to keep me in mind if he sold it. Fast forward to yesterday, and I happened across his ad for it on Craigslist for a decent price, contacted him and he said he'd sell it to me for $50 less than his posted price...and I'm now the very happy owner of a Juno 106. I could tell that he was a bit sad about seeing it go, so I told him he could come play it at my place if he wanted too.   It's in very good shape for the age, but not without faults. There's a broken but usable resonance slider, the bender panel is loose, a couple of buttons aren't as responsive as I'd like. Worst is that it seems like the VCA might be starting to fail, as it seems like I'm getting volume doubling/halving itself, or noise when playing 4 or more keys, but only intermittently. Doing the voice test doesn't reveal anything auditorily amiss, but it's also worth noting that the voice numbers are not represented on the display in test mode. I factored in the cost of new chips with the purchase, but still need to find a tech in my area since I'm not confident enough in my soldering skills to do it myself. Despite all that, I'm loving this synth. I can hear so many sounds from my favorite albums on this thing, and while I'm not a keys player, this board just makes me want to play.

synthesizers,3c0su5,hafilax,7,Fri Jul 3 19:12:29 2015 UTC,"There are all kinds of tricks to programming thin sounding pads on a K Station. Use one oscillator but give it some movement, such as a slight, almost inaudible touch of vibrato, or a fast but of PWM. Another trick is to use a bandpass or highpass filter to suck out those muddy lower frequencies. One oscillator with chorus and a bit of filter resonance takes you down a slightly Juno-ish avenue.   Also, don't detune the oscillators too much - that will also muddy your sound a lot. Try to keep them within an octave of each other and stick to the same waveform for oscillators tuned to the same note, but maybe a pulse or triangle on the one an octave below.  And don't be afraid to shape the filter with the LFO and EG.   There are many, many ways to make a pad that doesn't dominate a mix, especially with a synth as flexible as a K Station, so don't give up!"
synthesizers,3c0su5,KilroytheKilljoy,3,Fri Jul 3 21:40:00 2015 UTC,Do you have a high pass or band pass filter? Use a low harmonic content osc for the root and higher harmonic content in the upper registers.  Really a pad should fill in the empty spectra. If it's fighting for room it's in the wrong register or there's no space to begin with.
synthesizers,3c0su5,Lurkmcgirk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:47:06 2015 UTC,"Only a low pass filter, unfortunately. I'll try what you suggested, though; thanks.

synthesizers,3c0su5,scooter76,2,Fri Jul 3 19:44:54 2015 UTC,"I have a first gen 16 channel Onyx mixer that I got when they came out, as I had a great discount at the time. I understand that the newer model allows you to link multiple units, which I regret not being able to do. Once Mackie released the universal driver, it became a pretty great mixer. The preamps are cheap(cloudy? Muddy? Somewhere in between) but pretty quiet, and I think the eq is more musical than what you find in most other mixers in this range. The line inputs sound very neutral to me. I have yet to find myself short of channels when using it, the driver has never had an issue in windows 7, and it seems to do pretty well in the latency department. I would expect the smaller onyx mixers are generally the same, but I have not personally used them.   I have also used a multimix 8 in the past. It isn't garbage... But if you can swing the extra money, the onyx is going to be built a little better and have more useful eqs. Firewire is basically dead though, and you need a particular, brand of external card if you want to reliably use it with a laptop that doesn't have a firewire port, I guess because of the underlying software stack. Just something to consider, as I struggled quite a bit to get this working when I first got my mixer."

synthesizers,3c1un0,walmartsale,3,Fri Jul 3 23:59:53 2015 UTC,"It would help to know if the hardware units you are trying to sequence have midi thru. If they do, then you patch from your daw, to your 1x1 to your first synth. Then from that first synth go from thru to in on each successive synth. You will need to then set each synth to communicate on a different channel (1-16) and set each midi track in your DAW to send on the corresponding channel.  What this doesn't do for you is allow bi-directional communication. If any of the units you are trying to sequence send midi cc messages when you move a knob/fader then you won't be able to record that in your DAW.  It is very convenient for the bi-directional communication to have each synth on it's own midi port (cable) for both in and out ports, but not at all necessary."
synthesizers,3c1un0,Poictesme,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:53:12 2015 UTC,"Yup all have have thru. I was considering that, but honestly don't want to have to turn on all the modules if I only want to mess around with one. Rather have them running in parallel."
synthesizers,3c1un0,Poictesme,3,Sat Jul 4 01:21:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are a few advantages to running them in parallel, but you can get by pretty well until you have more MIDI outs."
synthesizers,3c1un0,ranzee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:43:04 2015 UTC,The way the MOTU unit works is in the DAW it shows each MIDI port as a separate output (or input). This then allows you to allocate tracks in your DAW directly to a device. The benefit of this is you don't need to play around with MIDI channels.  If you use your single 1x1 interface and the patch bay - you will need to setup each hardware device to listen on a different MIDI channel - and your DAW tracks will need to be set to output on these channels.  I much prefer the MOTU way ... as it leaves the second option available also :)
synthesizers,3c1un0,wiseaus_stunt_double,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:58:02 2015 UTC,"technically, you're still fiddling around with MIDI channels, but it's at the MOTU instead relaying the MIDI data to each device bus-style. The real advantage of the patch bay is that you don't have to worry if a device in the chain getting hosed because it received too many MIDI frames than it can handle and now needs to be rebooted. This has happened so many times that the first thing I bought when I got back into synths was a MOTU. The extra $100 is worth it in lack of headaches and bloody ears from the gibberish caused by MIDI buffer overflow."
synthesizers,3c1un0,ranzee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:02:44 2015 UTC,"Well yes, but my point is that the MOTU can be used as a Patch Bay (as stated in their specs) - and a MIDI interface also - and if you get the XT, you can also control the MIDI data going through it."

Many of the extra knobs and buttons on the Sub 37 come from the Sub Phatty's terrible shift menu.  You had to do a special button combo handshake and then figure out where things were in shift mode by holding the manual open with one hand.  Many settings required a second button combo and figuring out what key to press on the keyboard to get the setting value you want.  You had to have the manual by your side at all times.  The Sub 37 solves all of this with dedicated knobs and buttons where it makes sense, and a menu on a screen where it makes sense.  37 keys feels ideal for a monosynth.  25 is usable, but in many instances you'll really wish you had that extra octave.  And then the extra features: ""duophonic"" osc control, fantastic sequencer and arpeggiator, aftertouch, additional modulation bus with more routing options, probably more that I'm forgetting.  The Sub 37 shouldn't be any harder to learn on.  Since it does everything the Sub Phatty does, you could even force yourself to only use the feature set of the Sub Phatty's front panel while you learn."

Paraphony has been really huge for me creatively as well. I can't really mention the features that the phatty has 'under the hood,' but when I'm making sounds on the fly it's incredibly annoying to use the extra filter/mod/env settings that the 37 has so conveniently on the panel.

ENV —ENVELOPE Restart  When ON: If the same key is restruck, all four Envelopes will reset, and start their cycles at Zero level.  When OFF: Each Envelope will start its cycle at its present level, regardless of what that level is, when the same note is played again. It will then take TIME 1 to reach LEVEL 1, whether the new ramp is in the same direction (up or down) as the original attack segment or not. In other words, each Envelope behaves normally, except that its Starting Level, normally Zero, becomes whatever Level it was at when the key was restruck.  i've experimented with setting t1 on envelopes and toggling RESTART ENV, and setting it OFF makes the sound kinda phasery sounding. i suspect the requirement of using the same note to trigger the restart means it's not really a looping envelope generator.   too long - didn't read - esq/sq80 does not have looping envelope generators."

So my sampler, my synths, effects... they were just forgotten or used as control keyboards. I had a really great productive period like around 2003-2005 where I used Reason and other odd software generated loops and sequenced in Cubase / Nuendo, and triggered VSTi from my Korg Z1 (yeah, i know, absurd). But as time went on I realised that my music was flat as an old beer left after a party.  So I started adding synths again (Z1 again) and was like a revelation. So first it was a Waldorf Pulse, then an MPC, then a Space Echo, Doepfer sequencer, MS20mini, and now Prophet 12 and octatrack.   I cannot describe how more interesting everything sounds, specially thanks to the Space Echo and the MS20mini. And specially the workflow is so much more fun and musical than tweaking for hours the vocoder+compressor+synth+kong drum machine in Reason, or using VST's.   I mean, I cannot think of a worst way of making sounds than a VSTi. Some of them sound awesome, and I love the idea of not having to deal with cables and patch changes, etc... but it just cannot compete with grabbing my Prophet 12, start with a shit sound and end up in some massive chord patch.  Besides the audio quality (I really think there is a big difference between a MS20 and any VST), it is just the interface, another kind of memory is used compared to clicking here and there with the mouse.

You're computer is not dedicated to making noise, there for computer has to process everything else a computer does. Including the programing language the VST was written in. Where as the dedicated circuits are focused on making tonal vibrations. That's all it does. You can not write a computer program to vibrate oscillators the way a dedicated circuit board does. Yes I understand there is programing on the board itself and I'm not expert on making hardware synthesizers. But you can not write a computer program that runs on a computer to make a bass sound like the Blofeld. You might be able to make some cool sounds with software VSTs but they won't FEEL as full bodied as a hardware synthesizer."

I get this argument with analog, but extending it to digital is nutty. Any ""character"" that comes from a VA implemented in hardware is going to come from the differences in DACs, not some magical quality that comes from not having the hardware do anything but generate sound.  It might take a lot of CPU power for a software synth in Windows to match the quality of more powerful hardware synths (e.g. a Virus or the Blofeld), but it's not an insurmountable barrier.

Here's tracks I made awhile back with the Blofeld. https://soundcloud.com/nytel/morning_after_party https://soundcloud.com/nytel/falling  Simply put, if you held down a sine wave on any VST synthesizer, it would not feel as strong as a Blofeld's or a Virus."

synthesizers,3bygmw,bone577,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:15:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure about the value there. Hardware holds it's value while software is worthless as soon as it's registered. The cool thing with hardware is if you get bored, you can get most of your money back by selling it or trading it for othr hardware. Nords for example sell for a lot of money used, even models from 10+ years ago."
synthesizers,3bygmw,Bionic_Bromando,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying in regards to resale but it's kind of not true.   software is worthless as soon as it's registered.   There's actually a very active and legal marketplace for second hand music software. This is a complete licence transfer so the software goes under the buyers name, 100% legit. The resale value is also very good, better than hardware: http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=43  Even that discounted, something like Komplete offers so much more than anything in the hardware space, so so much more... that is if you don't mind losing some of the benefits that are intrinsic to hardware like portability."
synthesizers,3bygmw,bone577,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:23:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize software was that transferable, I guess that would be a better value than most hardware. For me hardware is about the immediacy of the sound, just plug a synth into some speakers and jam away. I'm considering buying Kontakt for instruments that are hard to synthesize though, like electric pianos or accordeons. Seems like a much better deal than buying a Korg Kronos or something."
synthesizers,3bygmw,Bionic_Bromando,2,Tue Jul 7 23:49:31 2015 UTC,Yeah immediacy is also something that's intrinsic to hardware. Also having physical controls is an intrinsic benefit but this is kind of a grey area with some hardware being specifically designed for some software. There's definitely a place for hardware.  Just that if it's just about what sounds you can make or the flexibility you have or the capacity for creating music software is an obvious choice. If you need to perform live then that immediacy and portability of hardware really shines.
synthesizers,3bygmw,bone577,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:12:05 2015 UTC,"If hardware vs software doesn't matter to you, Serum. It sounds great, it's extremely flexible, the UI is a dream, and it costs about a fourth of what the Blofeld costs. It's a CPU glutton, though, so try the demo first.  If you do value having separate hardware, then it gets a bit trickier. The Blofeld will give you a lot of synth without putting stress on your system, and there's definitely value in that (25 voices/16 parts of Serum would eat a LOT of CPU).   I guess what I'm saying is that Serum is probably a better value (by virtue of being software), but you need the machine to back it up."
synthesizers,3bygmw,ruuurbag,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:21:52 2015 UTC,for the price of the blofeld (new :) )you could get Serum and the waldorf Nave vst.

synthesizers,3bxhzk,Raptcher,5,Thu Jul 2 23:35:48 2015 UTC,The TR-8 is definitely a fine and economic option. Also part of the reason why it so accurately emulates the original is because it's FPGA based instead of DSP based. Meaning it uses a chip that's designed to emulate circuitry rather than running DSP code.
synthesizers,3bxhzk,Biopharmer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:18:52 2015 UTC,Yeah eventually it will come down to cost. I wonder the very least expensive modular drum setup I could get? Time to add some stuff up!
synthesizers,3bxhzk,Biopharmer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:56:47 2015 UTC,My TR-8 just arrived today and I've been spending the afternoon with it. It's probably the most satisfying piece of gear I've bought. So I can reccomend it wholeheartedly. I recreated some Aphex Twin Analord patterns on it.
synthesizers,3bxhzk,Arxhon,4,Sat Jul 4 04:26:58 2015 UTC,"I have a TR-8. You can get pretty hands on with it, and it's actually pretty fun to play.  If you're getting a beatstep pro: you're able to drive the TR-8 via MIDI,  but you may not find yourself using the interface of the TR-8. It does come with some effects for the drums, and will act as a soundcard for you with two ins and 2 assignable outs (i haven't really used it in soundcard mode, so i can't speak for how good it actually is).   On the other side, the drum modules run a fair chunk of change."
synthesizers,3bxhzk,Mechanical_Garden,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:19:51 2015 UTC,Yeah. I know long run Euro is the way to go but that thing looks like so much fun.
synthesizers,3bxhzk,Mechanical_Garden,3,Fri Jul 3 22:26:24 2015 UTC,"It depends on how much you're willing to spend and what exactly you're trying to get out of the hardware. The tr8 has a multitude of sounds and effects for a good price, but it doesn't have the same modulation capabilities as the tiptop modules. The modules themselves are fully analog however, unlike the tr8; although it is the most accurate v/a I've heard try to emulate the 808/909s. The modular set up will require a case, power supply, gate/trigger module or midi module for note triggering, aaaannd a cv to audio module, if you're just getting in to the eurorack world. If you're going for a full set of instruments for a solid price, go with the tr8. It sounds good, it looks sick and it's less than $600. If you're thinking a little more long term, or if you have a fair bit of cash to throw at it, go modular. Personally I would love to add a tr8 to my jam room. Modular percussion is really nice if you have other modules to go along with it to open up the capabilities of a lot of those jacks you won't be plugging in to otherwise. I have the kind of euro rack set up I think you're picturing and without the synth section of my rack and a volca beats/DAW it would be kind of bland in comparison. Honestly, if you want to drop some money on something rrreeeeaaally nice I would check out the dsi tempest. Seriously, just.. watch a video. It's awesome in the biblical sense."

synthesizers,3butpk,slujj-vohaul,5,Thu Jul 2 15:04:58 2015 UTC,"The deal-breaker here is if the DIN MIDI out does not supply power as per the spec (the original Beatstep doesn't), thereby making my MIDI Solutions Quadra Thru box useless.  It's really a shame, since this would have been perfect for sequencing patterns longer than one bar on my Volca Beats and Keys, as well as my Microbrute (none of which have MIDI Thru ports).

synthesizers,3butpk,zzsnzmn,4,Thu Jul 2 14:32:08 2015 UTC,The beatstep pro has a much more sophisticated sequencer than the TR8 from the looks of it. Plus it would be easier to have all your sequences stored on a single device.

Analog VCAs are nice and all, and I'm a big hardware nerd and supporter of diy stuff like this, but if the source is samples in the digital domain to begin with... I struggle to see the point. Especially considering the io requirements of hardware drums. Hopefully he goes all out with it, I'd love a crust digidrum box with xox style sequencing and a bunch of knobs and sliders."

synthesizers,3bvknv,riley212,7,Fri Jul 3 04:51:24 2015 UTC,Xfer records Serum.   Only has two oscillators and a sub Osc. But you can make custom waveforms and wave tables. You can record a hardware synth and import the wave file into serum and it generates a wavtable based on the recording that sounds really really good. Or you can draw in your own in the editor section. Has a zillion filters. Very comprehensive modulation routing. Great sounding effect rack that can be modulated as well. And it sounds really good and is easy to use. This is the only vst synth I have been using since I got it.
synthesizers,3bvknv,ruuurbag,2,Thu Jul 2 18:59:05 2015 UTC,"Serum is amazing and it's one of the synths I've missed since going mostly hardware-only.

The resonance goes into oscillation. The modulation source for the cutoff can be either the envelope or an external CV; the modulation intensity is adjustable. Two more switches determine if and which VCO is used for filter cutoff modulation.   And, judging from this demo the filter's resonance/self-oscillation behavior is pretty interesting."

I couldn't find much information about Reon or why Roland reissued this, other than wanting to show off the SBX-1.  Apparently, Reon is a small synth maker in Japan that makes modular gear.  There are other pieces in the drift box line made by Reon including a step sequencer and another synth with a joystick.  I'm not really into modular stuff but this little box seems neat.  It's kind of a half-way between modular and desktop synth.  It's too bad there's no midi.  I'm not going to buy their $500 sync box to trigger a $500 modular synth.

synthesizers,3brri6,menace-official,11,Wed Jul 1 16:55:01 2015 UTC,"it could be just a matter of volume... check your velocity settings, normalize functions, or just your input sampling level. you may not be driving the sampler inputs hard enough, even though the level pushing the speaker makes it sound nice and full.   also ive bever used an esi, but some samplers have input sampling filters usually just lowpass for taking care of aliasing. but check your filter settings, its possible yours has a hipass."

synthesizers,3brri6,woom,6,Wed Jul 1 18:26:40 2015 UTC,wat happens when you go DIRECT from the minibrute to the sampler? kinda depends a lot on what cable type you have currently going from the monitor send to the sampler.
synthesizers,3brri6,thanielionlee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:33:04 2015 UTC,Unbalanced MiniBrute output into balanced mixer input   Isn't this the problem? Does it sound ok after this stage but before the sampler? Do you have an unbalanced input on your mixer?
synthesizers,3brri6,Lehster,2,Wed Jul 1 18:32:24 2015 UTC,I listen to everything from the mixer. I don't have an unbalanced input. Plugging a UB output into a B input shouldn't cause any problems; the B input just acts like an UB one.
synthesizers,3brri6,Biopharmer,2,Wed Jul 1 20:37:27 2015 UTC,"Plugging a UB output into a B input shouldn't cause any problems; the B input just acts like an UB one.   Let me preface by saying that working with balanced signals is not my forte, so I may be wildly off, but I don't think an UB signal plugged into a B input will sound the same as matched input/output.  At the very least, I would imagine your gain would be halved, since the balanced input sums the two halves of the balanced signal at the end, and one of those halves has no signal. This alone could be your problem. Furthermore, if you're using unbalanced mono cables, you're shorting one half of the balanced signal to ground (your cable's shielding) which would seem to add extra noise to the signal (noise that probably wouldn't be canceled in the summing at the end).  I would try plugging your synth directly into your sampler and seeing if that solves the problem. At the very least, you'll be able to rule out either your mixing/cabling or the ADC of the sampler."

It was almost 20 years ago I last used an esi, so I don't really recall the workflow, but maybe it has some default envelope or something that needs to be fixed. Or maybe you are just sampling with too much headroom?"

synthesizers,3brri6,SandvichDISH,2,Thu Jul 2 15:45:27 2015 UTC,It is most likely a garbage ADC making my patches sound dull.   this could be your samplers default filter. my emax and eps automatically set the sampling filter cutoff based on sampling rate.
synthesizers,3brri6,fridofrido,3,Thu Jul 2 01:56:37 2015 UTC,I personally think the E-Max beefs up every sound I've heard it sample
synthesizers,3brri6,grauniad_angel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:38:21 2015 UTC,"that is for sure....  ive never used the modern emu samplers. im under the impression they are a bit more sterile sounding than the sp1200/emax, but i really dont know..."
synthesizers,3brri6,autowikibot,0,Thu Jul 2 21:39:04 2015 UTC,"well, first of all, CD resolution isn't really that great. a lot of people will tell you to render your audio at 96k and keep it as high-res as possible until the very last minute. (obviously at some point it'll turn into an MP3.) I try to do that.  second, when people deliberately use old samplers (e.g. Roni Size in a recent Future Music video), they do it because of the way samplers change the sound. you need way higher res than CD quality to get a recording which seems identical to the human ear, and really a sampler is a musical instrument. it changes your sound. it's supposed to.  but I have a very similar problem with my own Minibrute: I often will make patches that sound amazing to me coming through the speakers on their own, but which disappear in the mix.  I record through Live, and my Live prefs say the input/output sample rate is 48k, so it looks like I've been disregarding my own advice re high resolution. so the bad news is that makes me a hypocrite. but the good news is that maybe my similar problem is really an identical problem: my Minibrute patches don't survive the down-sampling process gracefully either.  btw, I had an Emu ESI 32 about 20 years ago, and had a similar problem there as well: I made an amazing bass patch using its ""Transform Multiply"" feature, but when I made a complete track with it, the sound was buried. that can't be blamed on the hardware, that was me being bad at mixing.  tldr: ¯\(ツ)/¯ (sorry)"

The VL-Tone (as heard in the Da Da Da song in another comment) has similar blip percussion, but the one in the two songs you posted is definitely SK-1. (Note, the bossa nova preset in the Office clip is not an actual song from the SK.) The later SK models don't have the same percussion FWIW.  Also, worth pointing out that there are sample packs of the SK-1's percussion sounds out there, so no need to drop $60 on an actual SK if all you want are the drum sounds. I have two SK-1s, because they're wicked fun, but when I want those percussion sounds, I do it all in software samplers (the preset rhythms, which are the only way to get the percussion sounds, are iconic, but not super useful for more than just novelty).  As a side note, you can also hear the SK-1 drums in this filet-o-fish commercial. Once you know that sound, you start hearing it in weird places."

I use a Zoom H1 at the moment. Your mic already has a interface built in so you don't need to think about that when getting a interface.  The Scarlett-2i4 should work fine for current and future needs if you plan on recording instruments one at a time in stereo at most but you can get away with cheaper as well.

If you mean mixing in the sense of just simultaneously hearing your wind instrument make its sound and your synth make its sound... Nothing special there. Any interface that will take both line inputs and mic inputs is fine.  If you mean somehow combining the two sounds, we need more information on what you want to do.  If you mean controlling your synth with your woodwind, that's complicated but a special MIDI controller that mimics a woodwind will probably be up your alley."

What do you like or dislike about the ELectribe 2?  Are there any tricks or secrets that you used when creating this set?
synthesizers,3bma2p,mdrsharp,2,Tue Jun 30 13:29:03 2015 UTC,"Great questions. Are you a journalist? :) The motivation was a local DJ contest and I wanted to enter but with a live set. I thought about using more gadgets like volcas, POs etc, but then decided to keep it simpler because of the 60-90 minutes rule. So I finished some patterns, made new ones until I had 16 ""good"" ones. Stringed them together as a pattern set and performed it. (2nd take).  The E2 is my first groovebox, I come from like 15 yearss of playing around in Rebirth, Reason etc. and started to buy Budget Hardware stuff. So the E2 is actually my most expensive gear but with all combined I could have gotten a nice modular I guess. Oh well. So what I like is that it has all in one box. I may also get the sampler, but of course it would have been ideal if Korg had combined both into one since they are the same hardware. What I dislike is the limit in voices. Already in the 2nd track you can hear voice stealing, sounds get cut off. Several other things are not ideal as well coming from a DAW background and not being able to quickly shift notes around (I can't play keyboard at all) is something I needed to get accustomed to. There is supposed to be a firmware update next week so we'll see what it fixes.  Tricks; well, most patterns have something special at least to me. On one, I automated the pitch knob, played notes, copied the part, played other notes (and kept the same pitch automation) and so on and got a nice groove from this. I also applied Groove settings to parts with many notes like shaker or closed hihat parts. The Grooves give them a nice rhythm and swing automatically. Could write more, just keep asking if you want to know anything in particular."

I understand the OP-1 is more limited, but in some ways that is a good thing. I get lost in so many options.   My main reason is that I spend about 14 hours every week traveling on the train. I could bring my laptop, but bringing any kind of controller would be awkward when it is crowded. I really think I could sketch all my ideas in the OP1, transfer the stems to Reaper, and then then tweak and overdub in the box to get a more finished product."

At the other extreme, there's the Electrolobotomy Passivac a super cheap, dead simple, 2HP passive vactrol attenuator. It responds nicely to CV, and pings nicely when hit with a short gate.

I've kind of cooled down on buying new instruments, since I've been on a binge and have lots of stuff I need to learn.  Effects are another story. I didn't realize how much I needed an Eventide Pitchfactor until I watched some videos of it yesterday (there are 3 vids linked there, btw). Holy shit, that thing is amazing. I want to put it between my BS2 and my Akai Headrush-I run all 5 outs from the Headrush into different mixer channels, which lets me EQ and pan the different delays, and I'm imagining the Pitchfactor would give me some pseudo-polyphony with that setup.

I bought a TX81z, did like it quite a lot but realized I won't be using it much so I sold it again (for a profit!) and bought a Rhythm Wolf, because it was on a really, really good sale.  Also my Monotron Space Delay arrived today, and it's sooo sweet. I was hoping to use it as a filter bank, but the signal from my Rhythm Wolf is very quiet into the Monotron. Edit: It seems to be one of the cable adapters that are not doing what it should. /endedit Though I did try to plug my phone into it and run a few samples I have recorded with it, and it was perfect. Noisy, gritty and just perfect for sample mangling. (Also, I'm surprised how much can be done with just the Space Delay on its own).  Other than that, I've been to the local music stores and trying gear a few times. There's so many nice synths I'd like, but I'm quite set to not buy another digital synth that will just overlap what I can do with the computer. Still, I'm GAS'ing over the MicroKorg pretty bad. Also the UltraNova.  I was very impressed with the MiniBrute, and funnily, not so much with the MicroBrute even though they are very, very similar. The Bass Station 2 was amazing, felt like a solid unit and would probably be perfect for me in terms of having a synth that kind of doesn't overlap with my softsynths and works as a great controller.  In the end, what I'd like to see in my little studio would be: Monomachine, Bass Station 2 and a drum machine such as the Korg ER-1.  So yeah. That's my little ""rant"" on my GAS. Usually I can keep myself from buying stuff, but I've been reading up so much on synths for a year now and never had the chance to even try one out.   Edit: Oh great, someone just put up a RedSound DarkStar for a pretty good price.  Edit 2: We did it, Reddit! I just put up an ad yesterday asking if anyone had a Korg ER-1 for sale. I didn't think it would do much good, as I've been looking for a very long time on Swedish websites for it, and it's been all quiet. However, one guy messaged me the same day and said he would exchange it for my Rhythm Wolf. So I did!  Quite crazy, I had the Rhythm Wolf, brand new, for one full day.

Korg MS-20 mini - I have a BS2 so getting another mono may be a bit of overkill, but I'm a huge industrial-head and this is pretty much standard gear so I feel like I should get one at some point. DSI Evolver - Everything I've heard from these machines sounds awesome.  You can't trigger the sequencer with external MIDI on the BS2 which is a huge flaw in my opinion... I've heard the sequencer on the Evolver is really good, the onboard effects sound cool, just everything I know about it gives me GAS. Ensoniq Mirage MR - Again, industrial-head and the Ensoniq were huge in the genre (old Skinny Puppy, etc...).  I've heard a lot of sound demos from these and they sound cool so I'd like to have one in my arsenal. micgroGranny 2 - This guy uses these in his setup and they sound pretty cool.

Great sound, but the programming is just one of the worst things ever. Seriously. It's like trying to build a Lego set through a razor edged slit that you can only fit your fingers through - no thumbs.

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to quite exist yet :)  I was also considering the Tascam 16x08, hoping it might let me route and mix inputs to outputs (without passing through the computer, since it's not always on and DAWing), for effect sends and for sampling. But at least their configuration software won't let you do that (AFAICT). I think all inputs can be directly mixed into one stereo pair on channel 1-2, but outputs 3-8 only do USB output.

synthesizers,3bjx1l,cfot,9,Mon Jun 29 20:47:27 2015 UTC,"Sometimes effects can be an integral part of a machine's sound, and other times they're just convenient bonuses. The noisy old Roland chorus is a vital component of the JX-3P, for example, and more recently I think the Ultranova is a good example of a synth where the effects have been treated as part of the whole sound design ethos of the machine, just like the filters and LFOs.  Elektron units are another instance where the effects feel like a core element. But you've also go plenty of examples of classic 'dry' machines - the 303 and 101, all kinds of Moogs and Korgs, and plenty of others. And there are also examples of 'meh' effects - the Alesis Micron comes to mind. Useful to have there, but largely unremarkable and easily usurped by outboard FX. The MPC1000 has the dullest effects I think I've heard. In contrast, the SP series samplers are all about the effects - you play the effects as much as you play the pads.  So ultimately it depends entirely on the synth. Which is a wooly answer, but I think the Nord synths have probably proven themselves by this point.  An arp I don't think of as so important, because it's a function that's easily added - well, effects are easily added too, but effects tend to have a more distinctive character and play a more fundamental role.  One thing that always influences me positively is an onboard sequencer, which I think should be a legal requirement."

synthesizers,3bjx1l,3lbFlax,2,Tue Jun 30 02:02:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was probably a bit harsh there. The effects on a Micron are important because it's a multitimbral synth without a bunch of separate outputs. And pads always benefit from an effect unit, and it is a nice little pad machine.  I remember being underwhelmed by the effects, but it'd definitely be poorer without them - and you do get a lot for your money with a Micron."
synthesizers,3bjx1l,Pashimp,4,Tue Jun 30 02:48:46 2015 UTC,"I prefer to keep things discrete if possible. Separate arp, synth, and effects is ideal in my view. If a synth has a built in arp or effect and I'm using an external one for whatever reason (say I want a plate reverb but the built in is a room type reverb) I feel like I'm wasting the built in delay. So this would very much not be a deal breaker for me. Rather the opposite."
synthesizers,3bjx1l,splitradix,3,Tue Jun 30 06:37:52 2015 UTC,"The Roland JP8000 was my first ever synth, I got it after working all summer of 1998 in a crappy temporary job assembling US Robotics modems. (if your 56k US Robotics modem ever developed a technical fault then my apologies) The layout with almost one knob per function is great for learning how the average subtractive synth works (albeit with some extra unusual waveforms like that supersaw and the feedback oscillator one). I didn't like the built in chorus or delay, but its arpeggiator was great. In the end I didn't like how it sounded and sold it. I had already picked up a second hand Nord Modular and thought it sounded a lot better and eventually I picked up a Nord Rack 2X too, both of which I still use and love. I've got plenty of outboard effects these days so don't miss any onboard ones. The only digital synths I've played where the onboard effects seemed to integrate well rather than feel like a cheap add-on are the Elektron machines. I've got a Machinedrum and an Analog Rytm and, especially with the Rytm, the effects are integrated really well and sound decent. I think those old BBD chorus effects on various synths like the Junos and the older analogue string synths are an exception in the world of on-board effects as BBD chorus in general always sounds amazing, hence the multiple great stand alone BBD chorus/delay/flanger pedals and rack units in existence today (all the Moog chorus and delay pedals use BBD chips)."

I also will ask the same about effects - do you use plugins in your DAW or do you have outboard effects? If ""yes"" to either, then a keyboard without onboard effects shouldn't matter.  As a former NL2x owner, I can share some insights: No matter what you do (unless you go overboard with effects) the NL is going to sound like a NL. It's versatile in what it does, but it will always have that Nord Lead sound. If you love ""that"" sound, then perhaps you'd get along just fine with the board. But if you are looking for more versatility, then I would suggest looking elsewhere. Further, while you can sync the LFOs to an external MIDI clock, you cannot sync the start cycles of said LFOs and for me that was a MAJOR deal-breaker. I didn't know this until I'd already purchased mine. Twas a shame. But, now I have other boards I like far better.  But ultimately, if you like the sound and are unconcerned about minor quirks like the LFO one I mentioned, you might be happy with this board. :)"

The sequencer and presets are so easy to use that you can hack together entire songs and play them back in the style of a launch pad. It's far from ideal, the sequencer is better suited to creating short patterns, but it can be done.  It's also an ideal means for keeping your work saved without the need for a DAW.  The JDXI contains 2 digital synths, one drum rack and one pure analogue path. As such you can mix many elements at the same time. It basically provides most of what you're after in one unit. Of course separate units may do the job better, and if you're just after a synth that doesn't compromise on being a synth (especially an analogue one) then the JDXi is less attractive. The analogue element is fine, it's just not a patch (hah) on something like an MS20 mini, or even a brute."

Either one's good for getting a fatter bass sound, but you don't need both.   I know nothing about the Monotribe, so somebody else will have to chime in on that.  I do have the Volca Beats, and it's pretty great as a starter drum machine. After dabbling with it, you might realize you need more (such as >16 step sequencer), but it gets the job done."

Whenever I record on my analog gear, I always make sure to record both the MIDI and the Audio track at once. That way I can capture any sonic goodness on the first pass, but also elect to delete it and try evolving the sound in different ways. It's also really useful when you want to use the same part in another section of the track, but you want to alter the sound to give it some variation."

synthesizers,3bfpgr,tardwash,9,Sun Jun 28 20:36:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Using one or both tracks on the SQ-1 gives you sequenced control voltages. The obvious thing to do with these is direct them to the filter, so you get timbral variation along with the notes. Having incommensurate sequences (e.g., 8 steps of pitch CV and 5 steps of filter CV) gets you nice polyrhythmic timbral variations.  Also, I like using the ""step jump"" mode on the SQ-1 to ""play"" the sequencer. I get patterns within a larger pattern that way."
synthesizers,3bfpgr,ouij,3,Sun Jun 28 20:41:30 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty awesome. Are there any good guides or videos you would recommend? I find Korg manuals to be woefully uninformative.
synthesizers,3bfpgr,ouij,3,Sun Jun 28 20:55:21 2015 UTC,"Not sure I can recommend any guides or videos. The SQ-1 is pretty much a Volca sequencer. If you've used any of Korg's Volca series, all of its functions are essentially the same.   A couple of things I've figured out while using it:  When you have CV/gate patched out of both sequencer tracks, but select a mode that only uses Track A (so, for instance, a 16-step pattern, or the CV/slide or CV/duty-cycle modes), pitch and gate information is also multed to CV/Gate track B. This is useful, since you can control two oscillators together or separately, and don't have to worry about re-patching. A one-track pattern will control both CV A and CV B. Then you can seamlessly switch to a two-track pattern. This is fun.  Also fun, as I mentioned, is ""step jump."" I use this to play the sequencer. Whatever step you hold down in ""step jump"" immediately becomes active, even if you had set it as an inactive step in ""active step"" mode. It's easier to see than to describe.  Another fun thing  in that little video: the MS-20's pitch is being controlled by Track B of the SQ-1, but it isn't being gated by the SQ-1 there at all. I'm feeding a drumbeat from the Volca Beats into the ESP section and using the envelope follower to open the main VCA, so the rhythm follows the drumbeat, but the pitch follows the pitch CV. Analog: more fun than a barrel of monkeys."
synthesizers,3bfpgr,ouij,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:09:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for this.  I picked one up this afternoon and it took my longer than it should have to figure out I need to have gate patched into the trig on the MS-20. I will try the step jump trick tomorrow.
synthesizers,3bfpgr,ouij,2,Mon Jun 29 03:50:37 2015 UTC,"Another idea: sequence the pitch in MIDI, but use the SQ-1 CV tracks for sequenced modulation. All sorts of variation is possible. The gate pulse can also clock the sample & hold circuit."

Some giant factory isn't cranking these outs. When highly specialized products are made in limited quantities by small companies (in this case just one guy), the product is going to be more expensive.   The materials probably cost him $10-$15. Lets say it takes him about an hour to build one and test it. For it to be worth it to him to sell these, he wants to make about $50 for that hour. For a specialized service like this, that's a pretty decent rate. The shipping is expensive because they're made in Brazil so it likely costs about that much, not to mention the cost of shipping supplies to ensure it gets to you in one piece."

It's usually something like a cold solder joint. I've bought synths with minor problems that were easily fixed.   My biggest score was a MS2000 where the power would turn on and off randomly. Easy fix. Sometimes gear will be cheaper because buttons don't respond well or they have scratchy knobs.  Sometimes you don't need to get out the soldering iron. Last week I fixed a monotribe's button that would only respond if you pressed too hard, or wiggled as you pressed it. I opened it up and and the component was defective. The electronic component has a stem that gets pushed down by the plastic button on the chassis. That stem was shorter than the others and angled so it barely made contact with the button.

synthesizers,3bdf5j,highxfive,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:57:34 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, here are some of the prices I've paid for broken synths that were all easily repaired-  Prophet 600- $80  Trident- $1000  Memorymoog- $2200  Juno 60- $120  Juno 60- $250  Juno 60- $50  Micromoog- $90  Jupiter 4- $800  Source- $400  Polysix- $200  These were all within the last few years, and there have been many many more, so yes... learning to solder and diagnose electronics issues is a ridiculously useful skill to have if you are into synths. It cuts vintage prices massively because You end up actively seeking out broken ones, it makes ongoing vintage maintenence a non issue because there is no waiting/cost for dealing with a tech, it opens up the kit and mod world, but most importantly it lets you have a lot of gear that you otherwise couldn't afford. Buy broken, fix, sell, buy better broken, fix, sell, and basically repeat indefinitely until you end up with what you actually want. Thats's how my entire studio was financed."

synthesizers,3bbdkn,speedlimits65,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:36:50 2015 UTC,im super new to midi and still dont really understand much. would things that come in to midi in be like note information?
synthesizers,3bbdkn,Explodicide,5,Sat Jun 27 20:00:19 2015 UTC,"Midi is just messages streaming from a source to a destination.    Those messages can be things like note on/off, velocity, aftertouch, pitchbend, Clock (so all destinations can sync to tempo), CC messages (assignable controller messages), etc.    The source (keyboard, laptop sequencer) sends messages through its  MIDI out and destinations receive that information through their midi in port.    Some devices can receive and send MIDI data and have both a MIDI in and out port.    Some devices have a third MIDI port named ""thru"".  All this does is mirror incoming MIDI data so that multiple devices can be chained.    You may have a keyboard send midi to a drum machine and a synth:  Keys (midi out) -> (midi in) drum machine (midi thru) -> (midi in) synth.   That way the keys can send messages to either or both synth and drum machine."
synthesizers,3bbdkn,burniemcburn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:40:56 2015 UTC,that makes a lot of sense! so midi thru is kind of like a splitter?
synthesizers,3bbdkn,mdrsharp,5,Sat Jun 27 21:20:50 2015 UTC,"One thing i didn't detail is that every message has a channel assigned to it.    That way it can be a splitter, or you can have two synths play duplicate notes.   In basic midi you have 16 channels you can assign each message to.   The downstream devices, like the synth or the drum machine can be set to listen to a particular channel (which achieves your split) or listen to all channels.   The big downside of MIDI was that it is limited to 16 channels, which is understandable given when it was invented.      In reality a single device may be able to listen on many channels, which means you quickly run out.     For example a drum machine might allow for a channel pet instrument.   This is where the original midi spec shows its age."

synthesizers,3bbdkn,TheAnalogLights,3,Sun Jun 28 01:34:33 2015 UTC,"It's not a splitter on most synths, it's to ""daisy chain"" from one synth to another.   So if you have a MIDI keyboard sending data into the MIDI In port on synth A you can run a cable from synth A's MIDI Thru port into the MIDI In port on synth B, and synth B will receive the same MIDI commands that synth A is getting.    It doesn't split the signal, it just continues it on to the next synth.    However OP made a device with 1 input and MANY Thru ports, so yeah, that is basically a MIDI splitter."
synthesizers,3bbdkn,ranzee,2,Sat Jun 27 22:34:22 2015 UTC,"I'd almost say its more of a duplicator than a splitter, since its sending out passing everything that comes in to multiple outs. Semantics though."

So my Arturia BeatStep doesn't work with it - which is how I discovered this small issue. You can get around it by routing your MIDI through something powered - but still a small gotchya for those wondering.  This project is powered - so great job!
synthesizers,3bbdkn,hormesisaccountant,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:33:16 2015 UTC,Far and away your largest cost is going to be the rack case.  You are probably looking at about $100 there.

I bought a Volca Bass as my first synth back in March of 2014 and started learning the ropes of basic subtractive synthesis, sequencing, electronic arrangements and such after being in kind of ""standard"" rock bands for years and years. I keep picking up pieces here and there as I find them secondhand at decent prices. (I paid $120 for my Micron, which is probably the best deal I've gotten so far.) I love it. The ability to sit there and tweak and create your own world inside a pair of headphones is always exciting and relaxing.  But I'm still more of a ""song"" guy than a ""music"" guy, so I like to record and share more pop/rock song type performances.

I'm more of a gear head and not at all a performer, so there wasn't much in it that I could personally relate to, but I have to say: not bad at all! I'd only recommend some reverb on the vocals and maybe try other effects (live or post) on your voice if you're into that sort of thing, to make it sit better with the synths. Also, it might help to bring the mic closer and sit down in front of your synths and actually engage with them some more, so it feels less like they're doing backing track duties. Again, this comes from someone who's not a performer, so take it with a pinch of salt.

I don't know who the guy she met with was, maybe a professor at UOP, since we were in Stockton.  Anyway, he had a Synclavier and a white Oberheim that must have been a 4 voice.  They spent the afternoon manually sequencing Pachebel's Canon (as in: typing in the notes in Synclavier's language on the command line).  He told me I could play with the Oberheim.  So I messed with it until it made nothing but bird noises since I had no clue what anything was."

synthesizers,3bbpo7,FrederikMeyer,8,Sat Jun 27 18:15:20 2015 UTC,Does the P08 have dual left/right outputs(two L/R sets) like the P12 does? If that's the case the maybe the second pair of outputs might have been activated somehow. My P12 was behaving strangely when I forgot to pull out the secondary output cables the other day.  If not I'd that the voices are grouped internally in stacks of 4 on two peices of hardware for manufacturing/replacement reasons and that one of them has died on you.  EDIT: That black little box in the background lights up everytime you trigger voice 5 to 8 but not the audible voices so this is probably not a half dead board after all! I suggest that you double check all you cables.

Local Switch ([MIDI SW]): OFF Edit Transmit/Receive Switch ([MIDI SW]): OFF Exclusive Receive Switch ([MIDI SW]): ON Program Change Transmit/Receive Switch ([MIDI SW]): BANK SEL + PC MIDI THRU: ON 1. Connect a MIDI cable from the MIDI IN of the JP-8000 to the MIDI OUT of the external sequencer.   Place the external sequencer in Record mode. Make sure that the selected part in the JP-8000 has the same MIDI channel as the track in the sequencer. Begin recording in the sequencer. Play the JP-8000. Stop recording on the sequencer once the phrase has been recorded.    http://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/roland-jp-8000-connecting-external-sequencer/  Also found this:   When I switch the local control to off on the JP 8000 (as instructed in the manual for recording to a sequencer)it doesn't seem to receive any midi in. Keyboard through is switched on on the sequencer and all my other keyboards work with local off. I can actully control other modules from the JP but not itself. I can record note and controller information from the JP into my sequencer but not here what I'm playing while doing it! Does anyone have a Scooby Doo what's going on here?   Is your local control switched off?

If you can confirm that it is playing those notes, then the issue is with the audio setup.  You probably need to have a blank audio track created and its record mode ""armed"".  I don't have logic, but this is how every DAW software I have used works."
synthesizers,3bbqj2,Lurkmcgirk,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:39:46 2015 UTC,I can get straight up audio just fine on the DAW. The problem is I can't figure out how to get sound when I try to use the sequencer with the external synth.
synthesizers,3bbqj2,Lurkmcgirk,2,Sat Jun 27 23:43:45 2015 UTC,"I'm confused.  What do you mean by straight audio, playing a wav file?  And you are trying to hear the JP through the computer, right?  If both of these are ""yes"", then they are two different things.  You can play back an audio file from your hard drive, but an external signal must be ""auditioned"" by arming record for that track.  I know you said everything was set up correctly, but make sure you have your interface selected as the audio in source in the preferences for Logic."
synthesizers,3bbqj2,asilvermtzion,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:30:32 2015 UTC,"I mean that with a 1/4"" cable from my synth to my interface, I can play the synth through Logic, hear it, and record what I'm playing. That part works fine. What doesn't work fine is that if I try to use the piano roll/step sequencer with the external synth, there is no audio happening, even if I set all the MIDI channels to the same one. It may be that I misunderstood something crucial about the process, but I was under the impression that I could sequence a hardware synth through a DAW, and I'm wondering why I can't get it to work."
synthesizers,3bbqj2,fnordtastic,2,Sun Jun 28 00:38:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you had it right.  The manual seems straight forward, just that you have to set the channels for each part.

synthesizers,3bbqj2,digitaldavis,2,Sun Jun 28 01:40:15 2015 UTC,I'd check the MIDI channel settings on your hardware are set to the same channel your DAW is sending MIDI data out on. And that external MIDI control is activated on the hardware (if it can be disabled).

It can't be anything purely DSP based because that will always be easy to replicate. So I think it could be weird hybrid digital/analog stuff. Maybe certain eurorack modules. Imagine everyone scrambling to recreate the Piston Honda in 20 years.  Second: It's going to depend on what ends up being a trend, and trends like the acid/house TB/TR scene were partially because all that equipment was seen as junk in the late 80's and it was really cheap. What gear is seen as junk but is cheap and usable? Maybe ROMplers. I'm not joking either. Maybe this contradicts what I said about digital but who knows, maybe the Triton will be legendary one day.

There isn't really a piece of gear today that is so unique and instantly recognizable like the gear OP listed. I like what you said about ROMplers though.

Other gear starts off as budget oddball stuff and ends up being sought after classics; MS20, Juno 6/60/106, SH101. And other stuff starts out as something a bit out of place and out of time and sometimes even pretty much laughed at at the time but ends up becoming legendary; TB303, TR808/909.  I think the latter category is the most interesting because stuff we consider toys or just outright trash today is almost certain to include tomorrow's highly sought after £1000-2000 classic because of some weird craze that will catch on using cheaply discarded models. So, candidates from today include the Rhythm Wolf, Volca Bass & Keys, Meeblip Anode, M Audio Venom, Roland Gaia, etc.  The middle category is different because they were loved in their day despite their cheapness and simplicity but somehow achieved a legendary nimbus about them because of a certain character or sound that they have. Modern stuff that might head down this road once they're out of production include; Micro/Minibrute, TR8, MS20 Mini and Odyssey, Mopho X4 / Tetra.  And superstars? I suspect the Prophets 08, 6, 12 and the Pro 2 will be highly sought after without ever really getting lost in the wild for many years to come, as will the Sub37 and Voyager, and the Virus Ti.  For me, probably the most exciting thing about the scene for electronic music today is just how much power will be available for next to nothing for those musicians willing to do a little digging. Even today there are unique and powerful synths that never accumulated any sort of must-have status and yet are capable of astounding amounts of stuff. How about a synth with some decent analogue modelling, 4 operator FM, physical models for reed, brass, plucked and bowed strings, organs and electric pianos, and a host of other weird and wonderful oscillator types including noise tuned to a pitch as it's filtered through a series bandpass filters, with a side order of about as deep a synthesis engine as I have ever seen? Korg Z1, currently selling for less than £350 on Ebay. Or what about a dedicated analogue modeling synth with 16 voice polyphony, 3 oscillators per voice, 4 part multitimbrality with dedicated effects for each part and a surface covered in knobs and sliders? Novation KS4 / 5, and I saw one of those go for under £100 because nobody wants them. Looking at today's market, I can definitely see some absolute gems tomorrow's bargain hunters will be treasuring. KingKorg, Roland System 1, Bass Station 2, for example."

I still jones for an 808 but, really, I can replicate the sounds close enough with the modern hardware clones and equivalents or with software and it's simply the device itself that is desirable... Like a classic sports car that is outperformed by most of today's bottom of the line models but still retains desirability because of it's status as an artifact. Truth be known, I'd love an 808 but I'd never use it... I'm tired of the sound of it, it's been done to death, but I still want one just because of it's heritage.  I'd be surprised to see any hardware take that status again. Obviously, I can't predict the future but it's been a long time since we've seen an individual instrument be the driving force behind a new style/genre of music and I feel that it's unlikely that we'll see it again. Music production has changed so much I don't think it can reoccur.  Production techniques now seem to be the motivating factor behind the rise of new styles. Now that sampling and DSP is so powerful and is in reach of virtually anyone with a computer less than 5 years old (and even then... I have some older laptops that can do a decent job if you manage your system well) that sound palettes are no longer confined to the hardware that originates it... And the audiophile-esque argument of warmth and tone of the original hardware being superior to samples or emulations is only a consideration for a small number of musicians (of whom there is a disproportionate representation on this sub, myself included) and very few consumers care at all.  I think now we're searching for perfect interfaces: Hardware controllers, or the GUI of the software...

synthesizers,3b92de,asilvermtzion,5,Sat Jun 27 13:54:54 2015 UTC,"I may overlap with some other answers here, but here goes:  1) Must have some trick up its sleeve that nothing else does to create a large aftermarket demand when someone capitalizes on that trick. Since this will likely be a hardware thing, it most likely won't be digital.   2) Needs to be relatively unpopular so they can be had for a song second hand shortly after production.   3) Needs to be of low build quality to constrict supply driving price up in the future.   Verdict: Timbre Wolf. 1) Round robin voice assigning is unique--almost exclusive, in fact 2) No one likes them now, so some units will likely find their way to the hands of  outsider artists. 3) they're cheaply made, most will die, driving up the future price of the surviving units."

synthesizers,3b8i3m,30_goats,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:34:35 2015 UTC,interesting to know.  Its just another thing to work around.  I listened to some recent recording and I guess I drowned out or overcame the high pitched hum because I can't really hear it.    Did you manage to get your put all back together?  I was thinking about selling mine but now I'm thinking that was a mistake.  After playing with it again I'm pretty happy with its weirdness and set on keeping it.

He got back to me the next day and said that he couldn't find anything wrong with it... So I go to pick it up, and look and behold, the voice dropping issue had magically disappeared, and I felt like an idiot. Ghost in the machine was the official diagnosis.   I was considering selling it after that, but Im over the stage of being angry with it, It's still got a few quirks, like something in the logic of the voice a location doesn't work quite right, and the key follow for the filter is really sensitive. But it sounds great, and I really like it."

I don't have a huge studio but rewiring the PreSonus 1818 and my MOTU Midi Express was a bitch.  Anyway, I have a perfect spot open for my new TX81Z right under my System 1m now.    I also rewired my Lexicon MX200 to process my Bass Station 2 alone.  I was running my TB3 in mono into the right channel, then my BS2 into the left and processing each effect strictly mono, but I've really fallen in love with the sound of the BS2 through the two effects in serial now."

synthesizers,3b6qmi,Buckets1337,3,Sat Jun 27 07:55:28 2015 UTC,"I have an ER-1 mkii.  If you're going to pick one of these up, this is the unit I would recommend as it has ""cross mod"" for the first two modeling channels, allowing you to get some FM-like tones.  The original ER-1 just has a ring mod for these channels.  Since they both have a ring mod across the external audio inputs, I find the cross mod on the mkii a lot more useful.  Anyway, it can definitely do melodic sequences.  However, it is a bit of a fiddly process because you have to set the pitches using a single, highly sensitive pitch knob -- in real time.  This knob also covers a pitch range from below the audible range up past the highest audible pitches for most patches. There is no way to edit the pitches step-style, or even using a MIDI keyboard.  As a result, melodic sequences tend to be kind of loose and sloppy, and can take some time to get right.    The ER-1 is excellent at making glitchy, digital bleeps and things like that.  Random knob-twirling is highly rewarding on these guys, and it can make some pretty surprising sounds.  It also can do a huge sub-bass/kick, and compliments another drum machine really nicely.  I also find myself using the ROMpler part of the unit more than I expected, particularly the hats. It can do melodic sequences, but I think you're not going to want to do that sort of thing extensively after you've owned it for a bit, unless you have a lot more patience than I do."

""Reface"" has to mean something though, right? I'm hoping that you can buy the keyboard in any of the four varieties, but the ""faces"" are swappable. You could pull off the CS face and drop in the DX version.  Ideally they'd work as standalone synth modules too, but I'm not holding my breath.  I'm interested in the DX one.

At first I was just gonna buy an SQ-1 and use it to sequence my Gakken, but I realized I can easily buy an actual synth module for that price and DIY a simple sequencer to use with the Gakken, so now I'm looking at either a Volca Keys or a Volca Bass. I know that both of them are able to do both basslines and normal leads, but I'm not really sure what suits my setup more. I like the slide and the squelchy filter from the Bass, but I also love the delay and oscillator options from the Keys. Since I do mostly darker styles of music (and also because I'm interested in being able to do live acid jams) I'm thinking that the Bass' filter is more important to my music, but I was wondering if anyone had a sample of the Keys playing a bassline to change my mind.  On a side note, what I'd really love to buy would be a Microbrute, but $200 is a tad bit more than I feel comfortable spending on something for a hobby at the moment.

The precision adder function is nice for shifting the pitch of sequences from the SQ-1, adding some neat variation. I've also gotten reacquainted with my Harvestman Polivoks VCF. It's a weird filter. It doesn't seem to like square or pulse waves very much, but feed it sawtooth waves and it purrs and growls in a satisfying way.   I put together a bit of arcade funk the other night to try it out.  Related modular problem: how do you guys handle oscillator tuning?

I had never even heard of the Midifex, but I think it might be the best of the lot. The bloom effect on this is better than either of the blooms on the MVII, and the other reverbs and delays on this are also great. The downsides are that it uses RCA, has a funky power adaptor, isn't the quietest thing, and is all preset-but all of those presets are excellent.

If they tweaked the form factor, added the basic triad extensions, threw in a few rotary encoders and made the ribbon a bit more predictable, they could sell it for 3 times as much, just as a performance controller. As is, they market it to old people playing along to church tunes... Nothing wrong with that, I just wish I had some knobs. The best is feeding an arpeggio in front of a vst on one channel with the chords while wanking away on the ribbon to drive a lead/bass vst on another. It actually sends a 3rd bass channel but the bass notes are locked to the cheesy built in patterns so I turn all that off."

synthesizers,3b6yrr,Bonobo000,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:03:16 2015 UTC,"You need to create a MIDI track for the MIDI data and an audio track for the audio data. You need to have input monitoring enabled if you want to hear the audio. If you don't do that, you will have to monitor the audio using an outboard mixer or plugging an amp directly into the hardware synths. Logic doesn't know there's audio coming from a MIDI device by magic, a purely MIDI track routed to an external MIDI port doesn't make any sound."
synthesizers,3b6yrr,Bonobo000,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:11:43 2015 UTC,"So, I managed to fix the problem (I""m not sure what it was...) since it seems like it magically started working.  The track I had setup wasn't a pure MIDI track (I think). By hitting MIDI notes on the synth itself, I wasn't getting any sort of sound out. It makes no sense to me to have to setup two tracks to get an external synth to work. I totally understand that MIDI doesn't carry audio information, but how would the two tracks talk to each other in Logic.  Do you by chance have a guide for what you're talking about (or screenshots?)  Also, obviously when my synth is off, the audio won't stay on. I'm assuming I'll have to bounce that track in order to work with it."
synthesizers,3b6yrr,Bloodfart12,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:07:50 2015 UTC,"The audio track records the audio output from the external MIDI device. You can change the device, add another audio track, record the same MIDI sequence to the second audio track using the same MIDI track and build stuff up that way or whatever. You don't have to bounce the track, you'll have it right there as an audio track as well as a MIDI track - even if your external MIDI device no longer exists. Logic's ""new project"" dialog gives you the option of an external instrument, that is a project that starts with an empty MIDI track. Logic is expecting you to monitor that instrument through headphones or speakers, it assumes that as far as recording goes you only want to record the MIDI and not the sound. You can add an audio track to this project, set it to record, enable input monitoring (assuming here that you're using an audio interface without a monitor mix) and connect the external instrument's audio out to the audio interface's input. Logic doesn't need to have any link between the MIDI track and the audio track, in terms of the creative process they're almost different stages, it just happens to be possible to record both the MIDI and the audio in one step.  Edit: should add you don't need to record on the audio track, you can just input monitor if that's the only way you're going to hear your instrument playing."

I'd be surprised if it wasn't hidden somewhere in the OS, though commanding it to happen is another challenge.  Wait a tic...don't some of the plug-out synths come with their own native arp?  There's something going on there.  Was unaware of the Midibro; cool little animal, but I'm trying to keep the number of midi relays low in my setup (TR8>BSP>(daughter machines)) And splicing another in between will probably reach the point where lag starts to be audible, to the audience even.    Looking at the sys1's (keys) midi implementation, they don't have any CCs noted for the arp functions either.  But given that Aira devices can be made to scatter togehter (and in time) there's gotta be something, at least on the original sys1.  In any case Next week I'll be diving head first into midi CC's when the BSP and Sys1m arrive.  perhaps I'll have something to share."

Your best bet would be to get a small mixer - Rolls MX28 comes to mind.  Then run the following:   Moog audio out -> Pedals -> Mixer AND Moog headphone out -> Mixer   Then plug in your headphones into the mixer and you can mix both the wet (pedals) and dry (non-pedals) signal to your liking. Here's the Rolls MX28 mixer so you can see how it is applicable.

synthesizers,3b5go7,nikofeyn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:30:14 2015 UTC,I was hoping the Synth itself might be able to provide the power necessary. I suppose I should invest in a good mixer at some point.
synthesizers,3b5go7,calloustreble,2,Fri Jun 26 04:44:34 2015 UTC,"unless you're using a headphone out on the synth, the standard level for audio out on a synth is line level, which is fairly below the voltage levels needed to drive headphones."
synthesizers,3b5dlo,oliverz730,6,Fri Jun 26 02:43:57 2015 UTC,"Ideally, if you want to keep the audio streams separate for later applying EQ and maybe cutting out bits you later realise didn't work so well, you need an audio interface that allows recording from multiple inputs. Focusrite's Saffire and Scarlett ranges have models that do this; I use a Scarlett 18i8 which has 8 separate line inputs on the box itself, plus an ADAT socket which you can link to another input box for a further 8 inputs.   The mixer software let's you control the levels and balance of the channels, and you can save the settings you make to the hardware so that you can use it without switching on your pc.  One hint; use the TR8s individual outs to send the kick and snare on different channels - kicks especially love a different bit of processing."

In my (completely anecdotal) experience most electronic musicians record each instrument part separately, and then mix them together at a later time. Or they play a monophonic bass or lead line, while other instruments are controlled through automation. Maybe you require a polyphonic synthesizer, but if not it's something to think about because monophonic synthesizers offer a lot more features for a similar price.   a) Juno 106 spending up to $800 b) Matrix 1000 + Roland A500 Pro Controller spending up to $600   I don't think these are very good choices.  If I were you I'd buy a Roland JX-3P with a PG-200, or the Dtronics DT-200 in lieu of the PG-200, or the Kiwitechnics MIDI upgrade in lieu of both the PG-200 and DT-200. The Kiwitechnics MIDI upgrade would require a local tech for installation as well, but in all it should still fall within the budget you've implied that you have. And the JX-3P is easily the best analogue synthesizer in your apparent price-range. But if you're willing to buy a digital synthesizer there are a lot of other good options too, such as the legacy Clavia Nord Lead synthesizers, legacy Access Virus synthesizers, and the Roland D-50 / D-550.  If you're dead-set on the Roland Juno 106 or the Oberheim Matrix 1000 however, I would probably choose the Matrix 1000. Or even better, the similar Oberheim Matrix 6R.

The vast majority of electronic music doesn't have chords at all, but just several different instruments playing monophonic parts.

Certain subgenres of house and trance use chords extensively, while others don't use them at all... and the same can be said of downtempo.

I've been listening to electronic music for a solid 25 years now and the vast majority I've heard uses a LOT of polyphony. Even EDM has pads and stings that leave the tail ends of notes ringing, something you really need polyphony for if you don't want to cut those tails off as each note is retriggered. I've also never yet met the synth player who would ever go into battle with just a monosynth; polys are essential for the vast majority of us out there. I think you have an idea of what you want or think about it, and you're trying to make that idea fit onto the rest of us, but frankly it really doesn't.

No, I listen to a lot of people's experiences, have done for about the last quarter of a century, who make and listen to electronic music. So far I haven't yet met any electronic musician who feels they don't need polyphony, or never uses chords. That's a lot of experience across quite a few genres (synthpop, indie, dance, trance, house, psychedelia, ambient, hip-hop). Add to that the fact that nobody is agreeing with you, or defending your sweeping view that, and I quote, ""The vast majority of electronic music doesn't have chords at all, but just several different instruments playing monophonic parts"" and indeed the only comments here are disagreeing, and that also adds a few more voices that tally with my experience.

I've openly discussed my views and considered the views of others in this thread   No you haven't. You've answered them back telling them that they are wrong, like the guy who disagreed with your assertion that chords play no part in classical music, or that most music doesn't rely on chords. Despite what you may tell yourself, that isn't a balanced consideration of others' viewpoints.  Do I want to hear about your experience that tells you that the vast majority of electronic music does not require polyphony? No, for the same reason that I don't want to hear some Jehovah's Witness telling me about their experience that proves that the world is only 5000 years old and evolution didn't happen. I have eyes. I've watched the genres grow from seventies acts like Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream into synthpop and beyond, and as soon as polyphonic synths and string machines were invented, they had a place in every genre. It's there to see, I don't need to hear someone try to convince me that the sky is yellow when I can quite clearly see that it's blue. This isn't a subjective matter you can argue a point on; the vast majority of electronic music uses polyphony and chords. Some individual tracks don't, and some early synthpop relied on monosynths out of financial necessity as affordable polys weren't around, but as soon as they were on the market, they were used. It's a simple observation you can go out and scientifically test by listening to a lot of music, or by just going out and talking to some musicians. Not selectively, to try to prove your point, but just in general.   The person sticking to gospel is the one insisting they're right despite sitting in a sea of evidence that proves otherwise."

It sounds nice at what it does, but it was a basic and uncomplicated piece of gear when it was released; alongside modern stuff it looks almost embarrassingly basic. The chorus is the best thing going for it.   The Matrix is more like it, but it's a pain to program, and glitches if you try to change the sound live on the fly with a controller.   Options that would be better;   1) save up a bit more and get a used Prophet 08 PE - 8 voices, with TWO oscillators per voice; 4 LFOs. 3 EGs (including one with a repeat function), a 4 slot modulation matrix on top of that, and a 4 track modulation sequencer.   2) Spend less and get a really good virtual analogue like a Supernova 2, Virus C or KingKorg - they are all awesome in their own very different ways; the KingKorg is probably the most flexible in character as it has several different modelled filters, including an Oberheim modelled filter that will get you that Matrix sound. The effects are also really, really good on it too.  3) Spend smart and if you have to go vintage and analogue for some reason, DON'T buy an overpriced synth with a known expensive issue like a 106 - the Alpha Junos sell for a fraction of the price of the 106/60/6 trio and pack in 95% of the sound, plus a few tricks the older Junos can't do. There's also the Elka EK22 which admittedly is a pig to program but sounds lovely; and the Akai AX models which sound very different to the Junos despite having a very similar sonic architecture (more complex though - they have more than one EG going around for a start)."

synthesizers,3b278g,tralivallo,2,Thu Jun 25 11:32:52 2015 UTC,"Note that simulators is good, but not the panacea. You will have good results in sim if you model all the real life parasitic parameters (like wires resistance and inductance, electromagnetic background, connection ground loops etc.). So just don't rely on sim completely. Many things are much more simple when you just solder / build them on breadboard by small units, and connect to scope. Simple example: basic transistor switch circuit or digital logic IC may work perfectly in sim, but may won't work properly in real life without tighten transistor base/ logic inputs to ground with resistor (to prevent random false responses)."
synthesizers,3b278g,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Thu Jun 25 15:32:43 2015 UTC,"Fortunately construction details are a non-issue when working at audio frequencies.  That only applies at frequencies well above audio.  As with all simulations, the quality of your simulation is only as good as the descriptions of your components.  However, in my experience LT-Spice has done a very good job of simulating the operation of every analog synth circuit I've thrown at it.  In fact, it is rare that I can even see a difference in signals.  In most cases I have to listen to the signal for auditory differences, and sometimes even that is difficult.  Obviously if you have a good scope and a well-stocked lab you should take advantage of it.  But not having those is no reason to keep you from progressing well down your learning path."

You'll come up with some interesting stuff in no time.  Also, initializing a patch and starting from scratch is good. Just do whatever you want to it and see what happens. Hopefully it has the most recent firmware so you can easily route modulation. In case it does, hold the MOD DEST button for either MOD, the press (or turn) whatever parameter you want it to modulate.   Also keep in mind that MOD 1 is almost always assigned to the mod wheel, so don't forget about the wheel when you start fiddling around with LFO1 and nothing happens ;)  Any specific questions you were wondering about?"

Definitely start with an init patch and build a few basses and leads, some bread and butter stuff to get a feel for the core sounds. Then the things that make this interesting- the latching and looping envelopes should be played with for sure. Check out the sequencer too! Maybe look at a manual online to see a few shortcuts and hidden features"

Hold INIT to initialize a patch and start from scratch.  Make sure to turn OSC 2 up.  Hold latch (in the bottom right hand corner) to latch the envelope so there's a constant note.  This is great for drones.    Play with the arpeggiator.  It's amazing.
synthesizers,3b18v3,joegigs,4,Thu Jun 25 03:49:31 2015 UTC,"I just took mine apart, as I wanted to remove the keyboard since there were several dead keys and I only wanted to use it as a module. The keys themselves have a few places where gunk could build up and potentially make for a sticky situation.  The first is the aftertouch rail. There's a long metal bar that runs on the underside of the keyboard that houses the small aftertouch bands that the DSS uses. It could also be that they are simply getting stuck towards the top, in which case you'll be fine opening it all up.  As long as all the keys work, you should be a-okay. Just try your hardest to not break the aftertouch band on the underside. Mine came with 4 dead keys, and it looked like someone had attempted a rather blunt repair and it had not gone well. As always, just be a little cautious.  If you want pictures of the inside, just let me know. I've got mine out in the backroom opened up, waiting for a new fuse."
synthesizers,3b18v3,quantumdylan,3,Thu Jun 25 15:00:13 2015 UTC,You could try taking the keys off and see how the DSS-1 triggers its keys. Opening up the DSS-1 is not hard just some screws on the sides. This site contains the service manual along with a bunch of other resources. If it looks like dirty contacts one option is to take a scratch bright to remove any light oxidation.  Bonus: If you want to transfer samples to your DSS-1 thru midi I would recommend Sample Wrench.

I'm sure getting deep into the programming I could get whatever I want but I fitz around with that thing and mess stuff up enough as it is! I never understood the appeal of the Digital version when there are softsynths out there that sound great, but someone brought up the point that supposedly the M4000D or whatever it's called does actually PLAY like one so you have the same action and all of that. That may be good for someone who has grown up on a Mello but I certainly didn't so it wouldn't be a big deal for me. Kinda like all of the clonewheels out there being specifically designed for B3 players, which is great in a way but people who have never touched a B3, is it that important?

There's nothing too exciting here.   Whatever Richard Devine was talking about was probably something other than these. Yamaha also registered the trademark ""Montage"" as well so there's a chance that there's a higher tier product on the way as well.

Of course that's not conclusive, but I'd be very surprised (and baffled and appalled) if they went with anything less that 6-op.  If the render is in any way accurate I expect the sliders have multiple roles for tweaking the operator levels, pitches and so on, one per op - which would be a decent interface (plus knobs for various other duties - I can't imagine they'll leave a filter out, regardless of FM purity)."

synthesizers,3b0fge,wimpnotwimp,3,Wed Jun 24 23:43:49 2015 UTC,"I would say that the Monomachine may be a good choice.  It's unique, and you can do a ton with it.    You can use the sequencer and P-locks and make glitchy beats and loops, or you can switch it to Poly or Unison mode and make crazy lead and bass patches to be played by an external keyboard controller (or sequencer by a DAW).  Plus you can load custom user waveforms into the DigiPro machine, which opens up all kinds of opportunities for making weird and interesting sounds (make sure you buy a Mk II for that functionality).  I assume you're looking to integrate it into your VST setup, not to replace your plugins entirely, right?  It's a little thin sounding in places to be the only synth IMO, and it's percussion voices are very ""digital"" sounding (I mean, that's kind of this thing's charm tho).    It would help to know what kind of music you're making too."
synthesizers,3b0fge,Explodicide,3,Thu Jun 25 00:08:46 2015 UTC,"/u/wimpnotwimp and /u/Explodicide both pointed out important points.     Everything you listed is a groovebox, if that is the kind of workflow you're looking for in a synth then I recommend the Monomachine out of your options, far more versatile than the OP-1 and Electribe. The OP-1 is more of a ""here's a box to lay some things down in real quick"", the Electribe is IMO a less capable synth groovebox (less than Elektron I mean, it's no slouch) aimed at cost saving. I would also recommend you check out the Elektron Analog Four and DSI Tempest though since your price range can fit those as well. The Analog Four has a different sonic characteristic than the Monomachine, it has that analog fatness - which your setup might benefit from since everything you have currently is plugin based. The A4 also has CV outs which can be very useful down the line if you decide to continue expanding into the physical synth realm. The DSI Tempest is a beast when it comes to sound design on a groovebox but it's less ""playable"" than Elektron's boxes. I find with Elektron boxes I can have a sound up from scratch in a couple minutes, the Tempest requires more diving in my opinion but I've heard some great sounds out of it.       If you're really just interested in some new sound to liven your setup and a groovebox isn't necessary then your options really expand, would be useful to know what you make/are trying to make."

synthesizers,3ayi6v,jaVus,2,Wed Jun 24 21:15:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I basically use my looper (Pigtronix Infinity) as a really, really, really, really long delay. I'll capture a phrase/performance (anywhere from seconds to multiple minutes long), and then switch the looper into overdub/sound-on-sound mode. In this mode, previously recorded loops fade out over time, so that old stuff fades out while the new stuff is being added. This allows for the performance to be constantly changing. I don't like loopers that just keep playing the same loop over and over.  If you have a DAW, there is a great little free VST called Angstrolooper that does this. I'll usually use that when I'm at home.  However, I'm practicing right now for a few live shows I have coming up later this year, and so I use the Infinity looper live - mainly because I don't like seeing laptops on stage."

I was wondering how with so many sounds going on in the background the sound didn't end up just becoming massive amounts of noise.

synthesizers,3az7ht,MotelVoid,3,Wed Jun 24 18:04:44 2015 UTC,"G1 is incredible, G2 is more incredible. I can't complain about my MicroModular G1 even though it's the least powerful NM. It's freakin amazing. I'd love to have a G2 someday though. Have you seen the monophonic demo software for G2? You get some of the new oscillators to play with; some major demo limits but still a useful free software synth.   If I had a G2 it'd be running patterns on external gear rather than solely internal. That MIDI out capability is the one big thing where I know what I'm missing."
synthesizers,3az7ht,ZAMson,3,Wed Jun 24 18:31:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've played around with the G2 demo (after a bit of tinkering to get it working on my computer). Amazing stuff. It's a real shame Nord stopped making the modular stuff - probably the most impressive digital synths out there IMO. The G2's definitely a ""dream synth"" of mine but a bit out of my budget at the crazy prices they go for.  The sequencer capabilities of the G2 seems to be the main thing I'd be missing, yeah - apparently the sound quality's a little different but not in a worse/better way so much as just a different character."
synthesizers,3az7ht,CompuFart,2,Wed Jun 24 19:11:31 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference I know of is delay memory. G1 has very little.   Also, the G2 editor has a demo mode that will produce sound on your computer, if you want to check it out."
synthesizers,3az7ht,splitradix,2,Wed Jun 24 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the G2 has better compatibility with modern computers (for the editor), but the G1 is MUCH cheaper."
synthesizers,3az7ht,mdrsharp,2,Wed Jun 24 19:55:39 2015 UTC,"I own a G1, love it, my only problem is the lack of a proper working OSX editor. Some third party ones exist but they're buggy at best. I've never used a G2, however a few people I know have and some of them preferred the G1 sound, whatever way they implemented the sound of the oscillators was one thing that was mentioned. Others prefer the G2. There is a definite difference in the sound though, even just using the basic oscillators and filters and not going into the various extra options the G2 has. Worth trying to have a go on both of them. Analogue synth master Legowelt swears by his G2 and apparently owned two for a while because he loved the sound so much."

synthesizers,3azax6,dbalatero,2,Wed Jun 24 19:18:42 2015 UTC,"Hey there,  Originally the Rhodes was a suitcase (which means it had a speaker underneath it) and it had a large preamp in there.  Someone has replaced it with passive electronics and the old holes are still there. The two holes on the far left were for ins/outs and the 3 on the far right were for volume, bass and tremolo. Basically this was a ghetto job though. You can buy a vintage  vibe preamp if you want a powered pre in your piano.  Also your rubber grommets need to be replaced without a doubt. I'd probably replace grommets, dampers and hammers. Check to see if there was a miracle mod done on the keys as well. Buy parts from Vintage Vibe as they have everything you'll ever need. I am currently restoring an 88 key myself."

Also try connecting the RCA Jack directly into a mixer/preamp and see if it changes. Yours looks like mine, it was messed with and modified poorly.  Here's the wiring on my upper harp, the 88 key pianos were wired differently from the regular 73 keys. This pic was also pre-restoration, but I have not modified it at all since.  http://i.imgur.com/veYQMev.jpg  This might be the issue. Damn stoner musicians messing with our beautiful rhodes pianos!  Edit: ok I'm quite sure its the problem, look at the wiring on my RCA too. it sends power out to the top bit through the black wire, which yours does not have: http://i.imgur.com/EqRnMXD.jpg?1  Not sure if they made any harp changes through the years though (mine is 1973)"

synthesizers,3azax6,adamtao,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:54:54 2015 UTC,"Another tip, is use a preamp (48v powered) of your own and plug it directly into the RCA jack on the harp. That way you can focus on the harp first then figure out the passive pre after."
synthesizers,3az2mq,Blind_3,12,Wed Jun 24 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"Intro To Synthesis.  Pay attention and try to follow along on your Sub 37. The interface makes it very easy to locate all of the parameters and functions he discusses. A bit dry, but will provide you with a solid foundation of subtractive synthesis."
synthesizers,3az2mq,sheboygan_sexpo,9,Wed Jun 24 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much exactly what I was looking for! Thank you!   Here's hoping that I'll be making classic 70s inspired patches soon!  I also didn't realize how much of that stuff is still applicable to a new synth like the Sub 37. I guess it's like any keyboard, other than some interface or layout differences, the functionality mostly remains the same. Similar to drawbar settings on a Hammond vs drawbar settings on a B3 Clone, it might look a bit different, but it has the same end result."
synthesizers,3az2mq,sheboygan_sexpo,5,Wed Jun 24 17:46:35 2015 UTC,"No problem!  Although it's a dated video, the structural foundation of all modern synths still utilize the same parameters. No matter what you're learning on, there's going to be an oscillator, filter, envelopes (VCF and VCA), some sort of modulation (typically LFO's), etc., etc. That video's great because it discusses the universal application of trying to make a sound on any synth using common parameters. Once you learn what that video has to offer, you'll be able to synthesize sounds on a Roland, Korg, Moog, Yamaha, the exact same way. The only difference being how it's laid out and where to find everything.  Enjoy."

synthesizers,3az2mq,rush340,3,Wed Jun 24 18:07:55 2015 UTC,^ Came here to post this video. Well worth your time!
synthesizers,3az2mq,sheboygan_sexpo,8,Thu Jun 25 03:05:43 2015 UTC,"One thing that hasn't been mentioned is that it really helps to start with an init patch.  This is basically a blank slate, usually a patch with a simple single oscillator with no modulation.  This allows you to tweak one thing at a time and see how it affects the sound.  Unless they've changed it since I got mine, the Sub 37 has a bunch of blank patches in the higher numbered banks.  On mine, all of the 16 patches in bank 16 are init patches.  Edit: You can also initialize it from any patch: ""Press and hold the PANEL / INIT button to initialize the Sub 37 panel settings to a default state. This is a great place to start when creating new sounds from scratch."" - the manual"
synthesizers,3az2mq,oscillating000,3,Wed Jun 24 23:34:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I found this pretty helpful to play around to get an idea on how certain things work.  I had a question regarding how Cory Henry from Snarky Puppy does this pitch thing on this solo (go to 8:20 if it doesn't automatically do it). I think he's playing a Minimoog or a Voyager, so maybe the Sub 37 can't do that. But it sounds like he's changing the pitch of just one of the oscillators to play two intervals at once. It sounds really cool and definitely would be something I would use in my soloing. From my limited playing around, I think it has something to do with the Frequency knob, but there are still situations where I'm not entirely sure which oscillator I'm working with."
synthesizers,3az2mq,jepyang,3,Thu Jun 25 11:36:47 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely on the right track. The frequency knob found under the oscillator section is exactly what you need here. From the manual,  ""At its center position, oscillator 2 is tuned to oscillator 1. Turning it just slightly out of tune with oscillator 1 can yield interesting detuned or phasing effects. Turning the knob fully clockwise will create a perfect fifth interval against oscillator 1 (assuming that they’re both on the same octave) allowing you to play “power chords” with just one finger.""  That's exactly what's happening in the solo when he reaches up and turns a knob (looking at the front panel of a Voyager, that's where the oscillator frequency knobs are located). Later tonight, I might try my hand at recreating the patch he uses. It's fairly simple, but a classic lead sound.  Granted, the Voyager has 3 oscillators, so the Sub 37 can't sound as full with it's 2, but I personally don't have a few grand more to upgrade :p"
synthesizers,3az2mq,jepyang,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:43:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for confirming that! First time I heard/saw that solo I was thinking ""what sorcery is this?"" But I'm starting to get it. Cory Henry also plays a Sub 37 on the same tune here (go to around 8:10 if it doesn't automatically).  I really wanted a Voyager, I also didn't have the $3,000 or so required. I had to finance the Sub 37 as the musician's paycheck is in most cases and small one. I definitely have no regrets so far, I'm having a lot of fun messing around with it. Still haven't written any music with it in mind yet, but that'll come later.  I really appreciate all the help and advice provided."
synthesizers,3az2mq,plaxpert,7,Thu Jun 25 14:07:05 2015 UTC,"Did the Sub 37 come with a manual? I learned everything I needed to know about subtractive synthesis from reading my Little Phatty's manual. There was a section dedicated to explaining how the signal path flows, and how to affect the sound in various ways, and from there everything just clicked into place for me.  I strongly recommend reading the manual. If you don't have it, I'm sure there is one available online."
synthesizers,3az2mq,61050,4,Wed Jun 24 18:06:20 2015 UTC,"I did read the manual, it's very thorough, but I also feel like there is much more for me to learn."
synthesizers,3az2mq,Schemawound,8,Wed Jun 24 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"Next step is to go through the manual with the Sub37 sitting next to you and play with each function as you read about it, so you can connect it to how it changes the sound.  After that, it's probably 80% experimentation. There are a few tricks you can do to get specific results, but they're mostly special-case scenarios."
synthesizers,3az2mq,Schemawound,4,Wed Jun 24 18:28:09 2015 UTC,That's a great idea!   The experimentation part is what drew me to synths the most. I'm excited with what I'll create once I get comfortable with what each function does.
synthesizers,3az2mq,MoogMusic,5,Wed Jun 24 18:31:47 2015 UTC,"You're off to a good start then! The Sub 37 is a great learning instrument, but fully-featured enough to keep you going for many years.  You'll know that you've started to master it when you start thinking about how you might patch a specific sound without even having your synth next to you. You'll be walking down the street and all of a sudden...""If I route this LFO to filter frequency but have the rate modulated by envelope...."" Eventually, you'll have an imaginary patch in mind that can't be done on the 37...and that's when it's new synth day!"

No half measures, if I'm gonna do it once, I'll try my damnedest to do it right the first time.   I did the same thing with the Hammond stuff. I went from using a software based clone B3 and messing around on a Hammond L-100 I had in the basement to purchasing a two manual Hammond SK2. I was gonna buy a real B3 but I couldn't convince anyone to help me haul it around, for some reason people don't want to help carry 400lbs of pure awesome around.  It took a little bit to figure out the nuances of playing organ. You really have to voice things differently on a Hammond (especially coming from Piano) and Drawbar settings are a whole different topic, and also finding a purpose for the lower manual was a bit of a challenge. But after a couple of months of fooling around on the SK2 I was asked to join the Tower of Power Tribute ensemble, which has been a huge honour for me.  I hope that I will be able to pick up on the Sub 37 as well as I did with the Hammond. They are two completely different beasts, but they certainly sound great when played together."

Needless to say it sold within an hour and I kicked myself when I realised that even if I hadn't got on with it, I could have sold it on and made money on the deal!  My mate is the real dealhound though. Granted, this was teh late eighties / early nineties, but he scored a Sequential Pro One, SH101 and TR808 for under £50 each, a Korg Trident for under £100; then in the early 2000s he got a Yamaha CS5 from a guitar shop that didn't understand it and thought it was broken for £35. more recently he got a Korg Trinity Pro X for £250.

Recorded five times, mixed in Ableton Live with some auto-pan.  This is the first drone I've done and it came about from a weird bit of inspiration. I posted this in /r/drone a while back so here's the story copy and pasted:   Yesterday, a lady asked me directions, so I let her use my phone and brought her to the right street. Then she said, ""hey you should come inside, we're having a Tibetan Buddhist ceremony, it's really special."" I didn't really care to go as I've seen that kind of thing before, but she was excited, I wanted to be nice, so I said, ""OK, but I can just stay for five minutes.""  Went upstairs and was pretty surprised to see a full Buddhist temple-style setup inside an old industrial building. I took off my shoes, walked inside, and immediately I got swarmed by five monks who didn't want to let me in, followed by five other people who thought I should be allowed in. I was just standing there catching odd words of Cantonese while like 1/3 of the people in the building fought over me. Finally it calmed down slightly, some guy about my age just sort of took me away, pointed at some candles, explained a couple things about dying and stuff. Two minutes later a monk came up and tapped his watch. ""Uhh, yeah I gotta go. Thanks, bye.""  The cool thing was this droning sound in the background. Went back to the studio and made this drone out of five Moog Minitaur layers. First one I've made."

synthesizers,3ax8j1,TheGreatWildFrontier,5,Wed Jun 24 13:01:55 2015 UTC,"Timely thread! My latest track is a drone, pretty much hot off the presses.  https://soundcloud.com/akbarsblackeyes/cranes-clicking-tongue  The key components here are Grendel Drone Commander and an MF-105M MIDI MuRF.  The audio out from the GDC goes into the 105M, and the gate out from the GDC goes into the 105M's rate jack, half-plugged-in because that lets the gate signal act as a stepper. So the MuRF steps through it's sequence with each tick of the GDC's gate signal. This technique is awesome with the GDC, because the GDC's rate is not always steady. So using it like this keeps the MuRF in lock-step with the GDC, even as the tempo shifts rapidly and dramatically.  The MuRF has two outputs, but it's not proper stereo. Each output is handling different frequency bands. Half of them go to A, the other half to B. So this kind of gives you two separate signals which are very similar, but different.  This is where it gets weird/hard to follow.  See, I mentioned the GDC's gate signal is going into the MuRF? Well the truth is that the gate signal is actually going into a mult on my Voyager XL. One of the multed outs goes to the MuRF, but the other goes to the exp input on an EHX 8-step.   The gate signal is basically high/low, like a square wave (I think it literally is a square wave in fact). So the EHX rate is either infinitely fast or 0, depending on what gate signal it's receiving. When it receives a high gate signal from the GDC, the steps fly so fast you can't even really see it, but then it stops suddenly on one of the 8 steps when the gate signal goes low. Then it does that again with the next gate signal. So, it's stepping through the CV settings in a very kind of lurching way. Not in order, but also not random. Kind of reminds me of a slot machine, really.   The CV output from the 8-step is going into the exp input on an EHX Holy Stain, which is in pitch shift mode. If I remember correctly, I had it set to 100% wet, so only the shifted signal is being heard. I might be wrong about that though, I can't remember. If you hear any weird shifting harmonies, that probably means I had it set to 50/50.  One of the MuRF's two outputs is going through that Holy Stain.  The other MuRF output is going through an EHX Ring Thing. Nothing complex there, just a cool RM sound.   Man, I could almost live on Moog and EHX.   Anyway, hope you dig it.  EDIT: Oh, right. Drums. Yeah, that was Geist. Nothing really to say there. Geist rules."

Then i hooked up the MS20mini and monotribe via CV/Gate and did a pass of drone, slightly tweaking the filters etc. (My monotribe sometimes goes a bit crazy when trying to sync up the CV/trig from the MS20mini, locking itself into droning whatever keypress i make on the Ms20. which i know it's not supposed to do, but works well sometimes)  Then finally i did another pass where i recorded the high notes/melody/theme from the MS20, added some simple processing in there (reverb, EQ, comp etc) and kept it at that.  https://soundcloud.com/attyk/waterdrone"

THEN... i tweaked an organ patch on the microkorg. softened both sides of the envelope a bit, filtered out more high end, and ran the arpeggiator. this went through a fiery red horse fuzz, into a moog murf.  NOW... heres the important part. i ran them both into separate channels of a 1950's magnatone M8 amplifier. super dark, low wattage tube amp with true vibrato and spooky reverb. i applied slight vibrato with a low rate, and just the right amount of reverb.  now i could play single notes, or chords on the microkorg, the microkorgs patch would be arpeggiated, and the pittsburg would play the leading tone of the chord.  i messed with a many of the parameters within this little machine but here were the big ones.  arp rate-  dramatic changes that sometimes mirrored or complimented the square wave modulation on the pittsburgs pitch and filter  the pittsburgs pitch and filter modulation amount and rate  the super shifters harmony interval. bacially playing harmony/melody in key. super interesting when the square wave pitch mod was set up a 4th or 5th  delay time- self explanitory  murf rate and sequence.  guy came in and told me it sounded like silver apples. i didnt know who they were at the time, needless to say i had to look them up that night.  working in a music store can be fun...."

synthesizers,3ax8j1,TheUglyHobo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:59:10 2015 UTC,"Here's a drone I did from a while ago, I shared it here when I first made it... this is actually just using one synth, a circuit bent Yamaha PSS-80. I have a lowpass filter I built onto it that's a pretty obvious source of modulating harmonics, but there are a few other weird things on there. I built a ""pitch tracker"" circuit that basically overdrives the hell out of the keyboard and gives an effect as if it's jumping between pitches when you play chords, so I switch between a few settings on that. The keyboard itself has a thing to change the ""brightness"" of the sounds, which in turn affects the pitch tracker a lot in ways that I sorta forget. There was also a really messy delay effect I built into the thing (produced a hell of a lot of white noise and amps the sound up a lot, you can tell when I switch it on around 3:30 or so), coupled with a more pleasant sounding echo effect in Garageband (but that doesn't get modulated).  Honestly, the keyboard is only really good for doing drones and a couple of specific lead sounds because of how gritty it is, but the piercing high resonance on the filter is just so pleasant for droning when you throw echo on it... I think that the best filters for doing drone are filters that really scream."

synthesizers,3ax48r,aaricwon,6,Wed Jun 24 05:13:38 2015 UTC,"A good way to learn any synth is to find a preset you like and dissect it by changing parameters and listening to the results.  On the Ultranova, a lot of the presets make heavy use of the five effect blocks, so after finding a good starting patch the first thing you want to do is disable all the effects.  That alone might change the sound significantly, but it's good to get rid of them to stop them colouring the core synthesis. The effect blocks are a legitimate part of sound design on the nova, but you want to get to grips with the basics first.  So shut those off and then work through the various sections (oscillator, amp, filter and so on) making changes and noting the results. It's useful to do this alongside something like the Synth Secrets series in case you encounter something you're not sure of.  Once you're familiar with what the different filters can do to a sound, for example, you'll be ready to transfer that knowledge over to the creation of a sound from scratch.  Another tricky part of the nova architecture is the modulation section, which is very flexible and not particularly intuitive if you're a newcomer. If you don't seem to be getting anywhere with a preset, check there and you might find a few mod routings set up. You can set their amount to 0 to disable them. This isn't an issue when you're starting from scratch, but as with the effects a lot of patches do make heavy use of modulation - the nova presets in general tend to throw everything into the mix.  If you have any nova questions, ask away!"

We've all grown up with consumer manuals that are essentially repositories of legally-mandated warning messages. Synthesizer manuals are not that, generally.

The Ultranova is, at it's heart a virtual analogue, so anything you read about subtractive synthesis is relevant to what it can do, and how it achieves it. In addition to the excellent SOS articles, there is also the New York School of Synthesis series of videos on Youtube that will walk you through what the bits of your synth do and how to use them (in a general way, not specific to any synth) so you will have a better idea of what the functions in your Ultranova actually mean.

I've read books, watched videos, everything else I've seen explains a ton of electronics theory and acoustics and stuff like that. Syntorial just goes ""here's the waveforms, this is what they do, practice them like you would practice any instrument. here's the filter, this is what it does, practice it like you would practice any instrument."" and it goes through all the features on the synth that way.  I do plan to throw in a few brief lectures on how synthesizers work, but it's going to be 90% ""here's how you get from an idea about a sound to making the sound happen in real life"" because I think that's what people really want.  not a Syntorial employee, no relationship there, just found it to be the best method by far, for me."

I guess if you're just sequencing they wouldn't be as useful, but for playing it they really let you add a lot more expression. My favourite thing to do is map the pressure to drive, decimation, and/or distortion and the slider the filter cutoff. You can get some awesome sweeps that way and press in to it to add some grunge.  Another cool technique with the sliders is to have some LFOs set up but the amounts set to 0, and then use the sliders to bring in the LFOs and add variations to your sounds.

I realise that this is personal but I find that I often look at the screen anyway when making patches rather than the dedicated knobs since the values on the knobs almost never coinside with the actual value of the parameter. I've started to use the knobs more and more beause I know that It'll be faster in the end but I was very much quiestioning my decision to get the keyboard version once I realised how great the screen interface was.

Every single time I sit down with it, I come up with a unique patch. I can understand a lack of tonal variety (which makes sense), but I've not come to find the modulation lacking to an extent that makes me think ""Man, I wish I could do what I want to do here... what a drag."" Instead, I'll just do something differently and modulate stuff in a way I hadn't originally intended, which has proven more beneficial than not. It has such an enamoring sense of immediacy and approachability. I purchased it assuming there'd be limitations, and it would just be my go-to for a fat Moog sound, but it's far exceeded my expectations. I'm writing entire songs now, which I had previously struggled with on other synths.   In the end, I'll beat the hell out of the dead horse that is praising the Sub 37.

synthesizers,3av1mg,gcheliotis,5,Tue Jun 23 20:19:10 2015 UTC,Well I sorta disagree with that.  The Prophet 08 is analog has almost as many modulational options as the 12.  And modular synths are obviously analog.  Then take the digital Nords which have never been very modulation heavy.  I agree with you for the most part but it's not true across the board.

As you pointed out, a Nord isn't as modulation heavy as the '08, but it excels in other ways. As with every manufacturer, the models available all do something differently than the other models. Now expand that into manufacturer vs. manufacturer and any debate starts to become moot."
synthesizers,3av1mg,nikofeyn,2,Tue Jun 23 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"Popping in to note that much of what is new and exciting in the eurorack scene isn't analog. This doesn't detract from your argument, but I find it's a common misconception that modular=analog."
synthesizers,3av1mg,i_crave_more_cowbell,3,Wed Jun 24 00:23:16 2015 UTC,Just because it's modular doesn't mean it's analog -- it only means it conforms to some voltage and sizing standard and is designed to be part of a greater sum of modules.

Since the 37 was released a lot of Sub Phatties have been popping up used for as low as $550. Sub 37s seem to be holding out at right around $1500 just about everywhere I've looked.
synthesizers,3av1mg,The0Justinian,3,Tue Jun 23 22:19:49 2015 UTC,"The sub phatty is really quite good for leads and bass, no shame.  And at that price you can use it sequenced when your setup expands.  Honestly if they'd up their game on the polyphonic chaining of moogs (only slims) I'd be chomping a the bit to get a sub phatty to bump out my 37.  Both rockin synths.  Really the phatty is even a better fit for some kinds of music that are straight ahead."

synthesizers,3av1mg,nikofeyn,2,Wed Jun 24 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"it's precisely the same sound engine; and the 37 can do anything, and has another octave of keys as you observe.  And it has some complex modulation options, and it has a sequencer, and, and, and.  It's simply the layout in terms how presets are accessed is a little more ergonomic on the phatty.  It's a smaller piece of gear so it takes up less desktop.  If you just need funk/hip hop bass synth, if you just need motion city soundtrack style synth leads, the phatty is a little less crowded s'all."

synthesizers,3av1mg,Jordan_Rago,4,Tue Jun 23 23:40:52 2015 UTC,"http://www.wunjoguitars.com/uk/wunjo-keys in London  They also had a Pro 2, Brutes, everything Nord makes, the whole Volca line plus other Korg stuff, some Novation stuff, Blofeld and the Waldorf String synth thing.  That was just on display, I'm sure they have more in stock they will pull out for you.    They don't carry Elektron though so spent some time at another store trying our the Analog four.  The guy there was very condescending though.  Probably because I made fun of the Aira stuff for looking ridiculous.    Wunjo also has a vintage Minimoog Model D on display as well."
synthesizers,3av1mg,okraOkra,6,Wed Jun 24 00:23:00 2015 UTC,"Aira is made to be used live in a boiler room style setting.   It has maximum sex appeal for non musicians, and honestly, I love it for that reason.  Oddly enough, the massive amount of LEDs really help when you're playing in a dark basement.  You do pay for something that's not immediately musical.  But you get some things in return (sex appeal, convenience for playing in the dark).  For me its a good trade.  The tb3 (why not buy a bass station) and vt3 (underfeatured) are too gaunt.  But the tr8, mx1, and system1 are really good at what they're meant to do.  We've got 3 prices of aira in our band right now, and its a brand that's helped us along."

I was going to first suggest that you download the editor/librarian software that accompanies the Sub37.  I wanted to provide a link, but then I found out there was no such thing (for the 37).  There is editor/librarian software for the Sub Phatty, and for the Little/Slim Phattys, for the Minitaur, and a host of others.  I have a Slim Phatty, and the software (which you can run either standalone or as a DAW plug-in), makes menu-diving a thing of the past.  I love it.  Plus, as a DAW plug-in, it lets you record setting changes as MIDI tracks, which provides rudimentary automation.  I've used that feature a million times.  I've been thinking hard about getting a Sub 37, but if Moog doesn't offer editor/librarian software for it, that's a dealbreaker for me.  Annoying."

Old samplers are also great value - I picked up an Akai S20 for £25 last week and it just arrived this morning; spent the last two hours sampling beats from my ER1 and random noises. Lots of fun for a ridiculous price! You don't have to just get so-called 'toy' gear for under $100!
synthesizers,3av5k2,t0xicd0g,4,Tue Jun 23 20:20:57 2015 UTC,"The EA1 sounds pretty nice. To clarify, I don't really think of these as toys myself, although they are rather limited. That's just a word some people in the reviews section like to throw around."

The Beats and Sample are a lot of fun unless you already have drum machines and samplers you like, in which case the Volcas will feel really limited."

I tend to use my Bass as the lead/melodic synth and the Keys as my bass synth, simply because of the way you can change from Unison to Octave to Fifth to Ring/Mod on the Keys by using the main knob. It makes creating evolving and interesting bass parts super fast. [Edited for clarity.]"

I don't know how to do any serious repairs, but I've taken a few synths apart. took an MPC apart many years ago to upgrade the RAM, for example. it's really just a matter of using a screwdriver and keeping track of all the screws as you pull them out. but, if you open it up and look inside, and you see a wire is frayed or burned, there you go, that's the problem.  last time I did this, though, the solution for the problem was actually a switch on the back of the synth. (not a Triton.) took the synth apart, put it back together, then saw that the switch on the back was in the wrong position.  problem two, my first thought was maybe the physical MIDI In jack needs to be replaced, but if you can get MIDI to synths after the Triton in the chain, then it must be receiving the messages at a hardware level. again a total guess but that sounds to me like the kind of thing where you discover some weird quirk of the synth after you've read the manual three times and almost pulled your hair out."
synthesizers,3aw1p0,mdrsharp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:21:31 2015 UTC,"I opened it up this afternoon, but there was nothing I could see that was obviously loose or fried.  Like I said, I just had this at the shop to repair all the buttons.  I trust the tech enough to just fix any obvious electrical problems.  It seems like two separate problems.  One with the midi and one with the sounds.  I have all my midi settings the same as my TR-61, which is the lite version of the triton extreme."
synthesizers,3aw1p0,mdrsharp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:49:13 2015 UTC,Let me get this right...  The synth worked fine until you upgraded the OS?  Have you tried reinstalling the new OS using a different CF card (formatted)?
synthesizers,3aw1p0,snaxe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:26:51 2015 UTC,"No, the sounds were always a bit dodgy, and I figured a factory reset and OS update would solve that issue.  It had previously been loaded with the second newest OS."
synthesizers,3auepy,okraOkra,7,Tue Jun 23 16:21:22 2015 UTC,"you mention that you have a bass station ii. i am still figuring it out, but there is a very subtle relationship between the filter cutoff, the filter overdrive, and the distortion effect. simply cranking both the overdrive and distortion won't necessarily give you the punch you're looking for.  off the top of my head, setting the distortion effect anywhere from 9-12 o'clock and then messing around with the overdrive and cutoff seems to give the punchiest results. bee sure to play around with the filter types, but the 12dB filter is the most aggressive. the acid filter can be pretty punchy though. also, crank up the resonance a little and play with the filter mod envelope. by quickly raising or lowering the filter cutoff at the beginning of a note can really make your sound punch itself into the mix, if that makes sense.  play around with the two-oscillators. maybe try one being a direct octave below the other and slightly off tune (like half a cent or less). by doing that, you're adding a lower octave plus some additional harmonics by have things slightly off the perfect octave.  just a touch of noise can help add some frequency content, but just a touch. otherwise your sound can become muddy."
synthesizers,3auepy,nikofeyn,4,Tue Jun 23 17:23:37 2015 UTC,Some distortion can help. Especially overdrive seems to lend itself well to synth leads.
synthesizers,3auepy,xmnstr,4,Tue Jun 23 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if a rock band like Rush was running their synths through a guitar amp sim rig like a Fractal Axe FX."
synthesizers,3auepy,whocareswhatever,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:49:28 2015 UTC,Agreed. You can push the OD a little harder and what might seem like too much solo'd will usually just translate as energy in the mix. A little comp to tame the dynamic range goes a long way too. Especially with synths that have multiple VCOs detuned.

synthesizers,3auepy,manisnotabird,4,Tue Jun 23 18:57:56 2015 UTC,"I've found that keeping it simple helps a lot when making a lead sound that plays nicely in a mix. One oscillator, pulse or sawtooth - waves with hard edges - depending on the sound you want, if pulse then some slow PWM to give it movement sounds good. Not wide open filter, maybe 80% open and with a touch of resonance to give it some tone and bite and emphasise the higher harmonics. maybe a bit of LFO on the pitch, not too much, maybe map it to the modwheel so you can control it and turn it into full on vibrato for expression. Two oscillators can create a solid lead, but can also have phasing issues that make it not sound as up front as a lead should sound if they are both tuned to the same note; octaving them is a good solution to this (or tuning one to the fifth, that old prog rock chestnut).   On top of the above, distortion / overdrive can help bring out some of those harmonics even more, but you don't have to go OTT with it just enough to make the sound stand out."
synthesizers,3auepy,t0xicd0g,2,Tue Jun 23 17:37:31 2015 UTC,"I like all of this advice, especially octave/fifth-ing additional oscillators. I'll sometimes create synth ""power chords"" on three-oscillator synths by tuning one at the root, one at the fifth and one at the octave. Sounds great."
synthesizers,3auepy,TheAnalogLights,6,Tue Jun 23 23:15:56 2015 UTC,"""Punchy"" sounds often mean good compression. I find I get good tones by dropping the sustain to almost nil and using short decays, but then bringing back some volume with a high-ratio compressor or limiter. Alternately, use a white/pink noise oscillator to add some bite to your tone."
synthesizers,3auepy,kryptoniterazor,3,Tue Jun 23 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"without hearing any examples its hard to say. you could have a thin sound and too many other elements... or your sound can be too thick and all over the freq spectrum, clashing with other sounds.. resulting in mud.  you can use high pass and low pass filters to great effect when mixing your tracks.. helping put each into its own niche in the frequency spectrum"

synthesizers,3audye,BigBeta1,3,Tue Jun 23 16:17:16 2015 UTC,I have the QuNexus (bought it second hand) and have been using it every day for almost 2 years. It is one of the most solid and reliable pieces of equipment that I have ever owned. I found that as a musical keyboard it is about all you could expect from its size but it is also great for drums because its action is quite stiff. Along with the software editor it is a very versitile controller but things like pitch bend and velocity from the rubber keys are not so usable. If the K-board is of the same build quality I would recommend it %100 for home and as a travel/gig tool.
synthesizers,3audye,Schemawound,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not really a keyboard player and after owning lots of different synths I realized I don't even really need a proper set of keys. I had the Push which was fantastic, but it lacked a proper way to trigger modulation and it was kind of overkill with the Maschine.  I have plenty of ways of inputting note data already but what's really appealing to me about the QuNexus is the modulation per key via aftertouch/pressure/tilt. Seems like a really expressive way to noodle which is all I am really going to do with it anyway."

I actually the like ""pitch bend"" or tilt on the keys. You can assign any MIDI CC to that, velocity or aftertouch.   Despite it's compact size, using it with the MIDI expander gets a little messy, since you have power the MIDI expander separately (via USB). Sometimes I'd like to just plug and play and not setup the MIDI expander haha.   Overall I like it.

Experiment with where in your mouth you place the tube.  Sawtooth waveforms with fast attack, full sustain and quick release are going to be what you want to use for Roger. Stay away from sine waves, as they don't have the overtones of a human voice.  Keep your left hand on the pitch bend and the mod wheel. 50% of the sound comes from the use of vibrato and bends.   Good luck!"

But I switched from using an emu USB to midi thing to a motu midi express and suddenly the update completed fine. I don't think you are trying to use chained midi to update the firmware (almost definitely won't work) but it could be something like that. If you have any other midi interfaces laying around they are not all created equal by any means.
synthesizers,3asahh,bingaman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:16:24 2015 UTC,thanks! Definitely not trying to install firmware through the midi chain. I was thinking the next step was getting my hands on a different midi interface. just was hoping not to have to spend $$$.

I can use the cheap interface just fine for everything else - including controlling the Blofeld in normal operation - but for upgrading the firmware it just didn't work.  Hope your 'feld can be saved, OP! Though just crashing in normal operation could also mean it's actually broken."

While I know this piece is designed primarily for Elektron gear, it states it will work with other gear and Spectre does recognize it. When running the firmware install, I notice that the ""MIDI Out"" light on the interface is on, but the ""MIDI IN"" light is not. I checked with my M-Audio UNO and noticed the same thing. MIDI Out (from the PC to the Blofeld) seems to be working, but MIDI In (From the Blofeld to the PC) does not appear to be working.  I have double checked that the cables are plugged into the back of the blofeld properly and the out/in are not switched.   The MIDI light on the blofeld lights when I am sending MIDI data do it.   It appears that something on the MIDI Out for the Blofeld is not working."
synthesizers,3asahh,sheboygan_sexpo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:34:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think the MIDI IN light on your interface should be on when upgrading the firmware - at that point all you're doing is sending data to the Blofeld, it doesn't communicate anything back.

Did you directly connect your Blofeld to your PC via USB? You mentioned using MIDI thru and other hardware, so this is likely the issue.  Also, did you follow the directions posted here? The steps are pretty straightforward using Spectre.   There's also a ""Blofeld Rescue File"" on that page, which you'll likely need now after the experience you've described--it re-initiates the system after a corrupted firmware update/transmission, which is probably what you need to do when it loads up the rescue system. I'm not entirely sure of the rescue process, however. My guess is that direct connection to your computer will alleviate most of these woes."

When plugged in via USB @ the Minimal UI (turning on pressing global + utility) and loading Spectre it shows nothing for MIDI In, and only ""Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth"" in outputs.

synthesizers,3areik,ouij,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:19:27 2015 UTC,I owned one of these. It was one of my first synths!  It IS volts/htz so the SQ1 may work for the pitch CV but the triggering is weird. There is some kind of offset in the trigger circuit so a standard short-to-ground trigger isn't enough. I believe i fixed that on mine by tying the grounds of the triggers to the real ground with some small resistors. I put a midimplant in mine and used that to sequence it ever since. apologies if that explanation isn't technical enough.... been awhile. But if you have that problem I may be able to help out and find where I got the idea. (probly some gearslutz post somewhere)  If your pitch is drifting excessively you may need to clean up some of the pots.   The filter stacking modification is highly recommended! You'll get pseudo-oscillation and access to the MS-20 style hi pass / lo-pass trick.   The hi pass on the CS15 is probly the best i've found for boosting bass.... just creamy power in that thing.   http://www.synthdiy.com/files/2008/cs-15_mods.pdf

Artists like Bjork, Radiohead post Kid A, The Haxan Cloak, The Knife and John Hopkins have all had some incredible, arguably experimental, albums that are just as routed in western tradition as they are in experimentation and are very effective and enjoyable listens. On the other hand, I've seen plenty of live noise shows and half the time it's just really not that engaging or interesting, almost as if the experiment is more important than the outcome. Not that that means it's not valid (or not good), but I just appreciate it much more when it's done on a less self-conscious level that just quietly (or not) bleeds into the surrounding musical traditions that we are all hard-wired to enjoy."

synthesizers,3aplpm,t0xicd0g,2,Mon Jun 22 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"The interesting thing that you guys are opening my eyes to is the concept of experimentation as process versus outcome. I have never really considered this.  In theory, you can come up with a very weird and experimental process for making music, but the outcome is the most mainstream traditional pop music on earth. But in a sense, it's still experimental music, even if it perfectly fits into a mainstream genre. Interesting.  I've always thought of experimental music in terms of the outcome. So, the way the music sounds at the end. Whether it abandons melody or time signature or whatever other elements are being played with.  I like the point /u/paukin made about live shows. We have a pretty good experimental scene where I live, but I also agree that a lot of shows are basically experimentalists showing up to listen to other experimentalists. So the crowd's interest and energy are different. The crowd doesn't want to dance, party, drink, or anything you typically expect from a concert crowd. Instead they want to get close and watch the performance with an eye toward technical execution, how things are connected, which instruments are used, etc. So even a ""good"" live noise/experimental set will typically be pretty somber and stoic, as a bunch of people crowd around one guy's Eurorack system.  Which reminds me of when I went to see Xiu Xiu open for Swans, and he did a Eurorack performance. The crowd did not seem to enjoy it. Although I found it interesting, it was definitely not an ""engaging"" performance. But I think anybody who knows Xiu Xiu would know not to set your expectations in stone."

I started out with guitars and was drawn to weird effects and open tunings. With synths and samplers, I feel like I'm able to make even weirder sounds at the source, instead of relying on effects. I find real pleasure in sitting down with an instrument and exploring it's possibilities.  There was a healthy experimental scene a few years ago, but it seems to have quieted a bit. I'm in the Bay Area, so if I'm just out of touch and there is a scene, hit me up!  Experimental music, to me, is music that eschews traditional means of playing and results.

Sounds that I could never throw into a song, because I would have no idea what else to add to them to make it a cohesive piece. Drones ahoy. Ambient space embraced.  Additionally, I've been playing bass and guitar for about 13 years (drums for 2 years), and have pretty deep roots in traditional melodies and song structures, but with a synth (and a select few guitar pedals) the atypical nature of what I like to make and hear always creeps in without exhibiting any effort to accomplish so. I can't escape the weird. I'm glad.  Also, from what I know, the experimental scene around me is a bit limited. But from what I've heard, it's a little bit too... experimental. In my mind there's a thin line between ""I can listen to this for hours"" and ""I can only listen to this for five minutes"". That personal balance is always struck when I incorporate both sides of the spectrum--keep it too cut and dry and I grow bored, keep it far too ""weird"" and I become overwhelmed too quickly.

synthesizers,3aplpm,Mememan305,2,Mon Jun 22 15:09:40 2015 UTC,"No. I mean, if someone were being kind to me the best thing they could say is that my music is derivative experimental music.   I use tools that others use tools to make music with and probably produce music similar to what others have produced.  I'm okay with that, but it really isn't truly experimental.  The mass market tools I have are built on the backs of conventions derived from those music pioneers.    Today people are pioneering too, but I'm not one of them..."
synthesizers,3aplpm,junkestar,3,Mon Jun 22 15:31:07 2015 UTC,"It seems like you're very tightly tying the concept of experimental music to the tools used to make the music. Take Jandek for instance, I think most people would call that experimental music. But his tools are a guitar, drum sticks, etc. Very common, mass-produced instruments.  It also makes me think of visual art, like for instance the glitch art thing that's going on right now. Folks are using the same tools, apps, etc to make the art. But the art they're making is typically banal. Seems like half the glitch art you see out there is just a person doing a typical selfie and then ""glitching"" it with whatever tools they use. So the art is more about the tools than it is about the art. I think a lot of musicians (particularly gadget musicians like, which I think a lot of us are, including me) fall into that same mindset. The art is just the end result of this cool gadget/app/tool/whatever I used to make it.  So, for me the value or credibility of the art is not tied up in whether or not they used a truly novel or groundbreaking technique or invented a new tool, but in how compelling the end result is. There have been a million cicuit bent Speak-n-Spell recordings. But that doesn't mean that a new one can't be amazing. Or that it isn't experimental.  That's just to me, though. I don't think there is an objective truth about this, so I'm definitely not arguing."

This applies to whatever I'm doing with a hammer. If I'm the first person to decide to throw a hammer up in the air to hammer a nail, then I'm doing experimental hammer stuff.  If my buddy sees that and decides to put a parachute on it - then he's still doing experimental stuff.  If a trend grows from his hammer parachute idea and suddenly a group of people are doing that too but in subtle different ways, then it's plain to see that even though they are experimenting, they're using tools in the same way that someone else has used them and getting similar results.  That's me.  I'm driving nails.  I have a hammer on a parachute. Sometimes I like to paint the hammer blue or green and sometimes the parachute is made of different materials, but it is what it is.   The thing is, I enjoy launching that parachuted hammer up to the sky and when it lands the results are gratifying for me.  I looked up Jandek and I don't find what he's doing experimental at all.  It reminds of of Daniel Johnston.  Maybe the two random selections i made were the wrong ones, but it doesn't sound experimental to me.      So, for me the value or credibility of the art is not tied up in whether or not they used a truly novel or groundbreaking technique or invented a new tool, but in how compelling the end result is.     That's not what the avant garde is about.  Experimental art is to find those boundaries or exceed them - taste be damned.   It's about defying expectation.  The hammer parachute example would be instead of launching a hammer with a parachute - to see how far into the ground the hammer can go... or perhaps making the hammer out of irradiated glass and tying it to a weather balloon and waiting for air pressure to change sufficiently for the hammer to shatter and then filming the glass with an electromagnetic filter...

synthesizers,3apqpk,homegnome0,3,Mon Jun 22 22:36:15 2015 UTC,"The Sidrax is an expressive instrument based on touch. You have seven wooden bars that each have their own oscillator (triangle waves) that you play by pressing, touching, stroking, tapping, etc. They are very sensitive. Each oscillator has it's own fine tuning via the sliders. There's also a master tuning knob and a chaos knob.  A tone is played both on press of the and release of the bars, and they are equal. So if I press a bar for 1 second, the release tone will also be 1 second. Usually the press tone will be hard panned to one side and the release to the other. I negated this by using a stereo to mono cable. The stereo stuff does sound cool, but it gets distracting at times.   I'm still learning the patch points. But the Ciat-Lonbarde website has a good description.  There are 44 modulation points brought forth as banana jacks. They are arranged in seven columns, representing the seven bars. Their layout is shifted diagonally, to allow inputs in proximity to outputs. This is for touch-playability; you can make banana jack metal studs that can be squished by hand to gesture-patch the instrument. Inputs are cool colors: blue, green, and grey. Outputs are hot colors: red and orange. The grey jacks are parallel inputs with the master knobs: the one on the left is for master pitch, the right one is master chaos. The color allotment for each bar is as follows:  Two orange jacks, representing the press and release gestures on that bar in voltage. One red jack, which is the pure triangle output of that oscillator. Two green jacks, that are ""glitch"" inputs. They cause the boundary conditions of each oscillator to wire to the output of another. A modulation inspired by circuit bending. One blue jack, an fm modulation input for that oscillator.>"

As far as classical goes, there are numerous synth renditions of classical pieces, personally I'm a big fan of Isao Tomita's work.  And of course, synth-heavy rock music, the 70s/80s were full of it. Try Emerson, Lake and Palmer (which also hits your classical mark quite a bit). Also maybe you'll like some of Rick van der Linden's work on the Yamaha GX1."

I have a few pedals that I might put a synth or two through but I don't have them hooked up now.   Having a patchbay might help with your shortage of sends as you can just reconnect whatever the sends are going out to pretty quickly. Basically you connect all your gear to the back and use the front connections to route the signal however you like."

It's all attached to a custom platform (Z-Stand + plywood + cheap carpet + industrial strength velcro + black pipe) so that if I'm not doing live drumming (or live accentuation of drumming), I can throw the desk back and forth without anything falling off. Lean it forwards so the audience can see the blinking lights and me playing the pads & sliders.   It's no small help that I'm playing with a singer with an electric mandolin shaped like a Telecaster that's being run through an interesting effects chain.  Before the Tempest, my live electronic shows were pretty uninteresting. Back in 1998 I hauled around my desktop (running Impulse tracker), my laptop (running Cthugha), and a projector for the visuals. In 1999 I was just taking my laptop to play the few 'shows' I played. By 2001 I had changed up to playing drums in a shitty punk band, which helped inform later performance decisions.   My first big concert was seeing Nine Inch Nails open for David Bowie, and I think that informed a lot of my choices later on. Trent has this knack for finding the most electronic, made-in-the-studio tracks, and reinterpreting them for live performance. Another approach is to write music with live performance in mind - and that was another angle that helped move me outside the box with respect to creating electronic music."

It's actually not so bad programming them, it sounds so good it's never a chore. It's great being able to detune each one a bit so the chords sound wonky.  Just as I got Kyma I started going full on into analogue synths so it doesn't get as much use as I'd like.

synthesizers,3aomht,BonjourMyFriends,7,Thu Jun 25 17:49:20 2015 UTC,"I mentioned I got booked for my first live set, but I have nothing prepared. I've been practicing for around one year. I always record my stuff but I never pressed ""save"" on the MPC for my sequences because it always felt like practice, or that I could recreate it. Well, now having this live set, I'm a lot more focused on creating structured tracks.  I had to record a demo for the festival organizers, with only about 20 minutes before running to my second job. Here's what I recorded.  Pretty much everything after the 1 minute mark is improv, but this time I actually saved the sequence and drum kits for later. The bassline is not a keeper, but the rest of the track is going in the live set.  Kit is Blofeld, Moog Minitaur, little bit of Machinedrum, and MPC 1000 as both MIDI sequencer and drum sampler. (Monotribe, Mininova, KP3, and Kenton Control Freak were not used).  The biggest hurdle for the live set is needing to stop the MPC all the fucking time to execute some kind of organizational task, which stops everything else since it's the master. I'm looking into using the Kaoss Pad as a looper during that time, but couldn't get it to play loud enough or in stereo using my send-return on the mixer. I may have found just a fix by RTFM, but if anyone has insights into the MPCs start-stop or what you do on stage when changing songs, I'd love to hear it.  Feel free to comment on anything. I'm my own harshest critic but you'll probably hear something I don't."
synthesizers,3aomht,slamgauge,5,Mon Jun 22 09:36:12 2015 UTC,Are you planning on taking all that gear with you to a gig? You might want to trim that down a bit if you are. Setup time is a major concern when playing live. There is always something that causes set times to get tight. When I play live I take an Octatrack and one synth. The less time it takes to setup the more time you get to play.   It is OK if you have to render some of your gear into loops so you can take less gear with you.
synthesizers,3aomht,BonjourMyFriends,3,Mon Jun 22 09:50:01 2015 UTC,"I'm only going to take the MPC, Blofeld and Mininova. A little redundant with the digi-synths, but I need both multi-timbrality and keys. Next in line of importance is that red, knobby Kenton MIDI controller, and the Kaoss Pad if the looping transition thing works out.  Since this video, I've separated all the non-essential liveset gear, so now I have one setup at home and one at the studio. Bonus! My studio-mate is playing the same gig so I'm going to use his little mixer and RNC compressor.   It's a multi-day festival and I'm playing the first timeslot of the day. My first reaction was, ""fuck that, I wanna play at prime party time,"" like I have the last few years as a DJ, but it's actually great. As much as I'm focusing all my energy around this for the next several months and planning for perfection, it's a relatively low-pressure gig. It means I have plenty of time to triple check my setup. I can screw up and it'll be mostly friends around. I'm required to play for 2 hours, but they said I can start early and play for 3, which I plan to. I plan to start off with ambient (people will be sleeping off hangovers in tents nearby) and crank it up to this level by the end. I'm on the DJ stage, so if there's some equipment malfunction, I can always switch over to DJing as a last resort."

synthesizers,3aomht,BonjourMyFriends,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:49:27 2015 UTC,"Well I won't be including the Machinedrum in the live set, but to answer your question... The MPC and MD are usually playing together with MPC as master. So the MD also stops when I press stop on the MPC. I would have to go into the MD's global options and turn external control on and off every time I need to start or stop the MPC. Maybe there's a SysEx for that...?  Un-syncing the MD completely from external MIDI is probably the best option for what you're suggesting. This gets into risky BPM drift territory, but the MD is pretty easy to beatmatch because there are +/- tempo bump buttons. I'll give it a try next time they're in the same room.  I think the most realistic option is just being ok with a few short pauses between songs. It kinda makes it more obvious it's a live set and not a DJ set. Besides I've been at DJ gigs where the sound gets unplugged or someone ejects the wrong CD, and unless it's a really shitty night people naturally fill the silence with cheering. Not the worst thing in the world."
synthesizers,3aomht,revolved,2,Mon Jun 22 17:25:57 2015 UTC,"Turn off transport control of the MD, then you can start and stop as you want and still be in sync to the mpc. Experiment!

Also get some crazy delays on the blofeld so when you stop the MPC it covers over the MD beat hahah!"

The synths seem to be overpowering the drums. Not sure if this is levels or eq thing (I'm listening on 2.1 powered computer speakers).  Movement through ideas works well. Can you keep that up for two three hours? Or, are you gonna do some longer jams in between the more moving songs?"
synthesizers,3aomht,nikofeyn,2,Tue Jun 23 01:40:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comments. Drums are my weakest area and the thing I enjoy the least. I just threw together two existing drum patterns, clearly wasn't perfect. The Moog sounds good in the room, but it's always blasting in the recording. Need to focus on these more.  I know it's ambitious, but think I can handle the full three hours. Bear in mind the gig is in October. If I had a one hour time slot I would spend next few months only making one hour of music. Four months is plenty of time for me to create and refine three hours of music, especially considering I'm also very comfortable improvising on the spot. So I appreciate the challenge. I'm not very self-motivated, but when there's an external goal like this and people are depending on me, I want to blow everyone away.  Stylistically, it also won't be three hours of fast-changing breakbeats. I'm planning to do something like:  1st hour: ambient jams (people will mainly be wandering around or doing activities like group yoga at this time)  2nd hour: dubby mid-tempo beats (6 month old recording, I was literally half as experienced as I am now, but it's the closest thing to an example. I've already made a more concise version and the vocalist is going to join me at some point.)  3rd hour: club set - spend the last hour building up BPM, going more towards techno and breakbeats, more like the original video."

Other synths are a Yamaha PSS though a delay pedal, and a Streichfett. I also had a bunch of samples I mangled with cassette and played back through a loop pedal.   I'm working towards putting together a live set - the first time I've actually performed electronic music live - so this was put together pretty much live, but with a few overdubs. I tried to keep those minimal so that my stuff becomes easier to reproduce in the live context."
synthesizers,3aomht,slamgauge,2,Tue Jun 23 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"sultry. i like it, particularly the bass texture.  but it maybe needs some more variation. i know that personally, i struggle with adding variation to my more ambient pieces, and i realize that after recording it live and then listening to it that i feel that it's not taking me anywhere. i think even slower, haunt-ier pieces need some sort of variation. it's a journey, just slower than normal. haha. my own advice applies double to my own pieces, as i find it too easy to just slip into a valley during a jam."
synthesizers,3aomht,BonjourMyFriends,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I totally agree. The music I make in a more ""studio"" sort of way tends to have a lot more variation, and be a lot shorter. But the limitations of my live setup mean that everything moves more slowly. I think this will improve with practice. And also improved ergonomics. At the moment all my stuff is set up in a way that it makes it physically very difficult to perform live pieces at any speed. It's like playing Twister. But I'm getting a small live desk in the next few days, that means I can set up somewhere else outside my studio and work on that.  Thanks for listening and commenting."

This is a stereo recording straight into ableton with just a bit of compression and limiting, no editing. Any comments on the structure or performance are welcome as this was played 'live' (best of 3 takes).   We decided to limit ourselves to just two pieces of gear each. I went with the octatrack and pro 2 while he has his tempest and small modular system. The Tempest and octatrack really make a great pair. The limitations helps to speed up the writing process which is good because we are anxious to take our music onstage."

synthesizers,3ao8pl,ZephrimC,5,Mon Jun 22 03:33:44 2015 UTC,"TL;DR This site explains the different Roland Filters with schematics. The System 700 has different filter: a state-variable filter 12dB/24dB with LP/BP/HP and Notch and buffers! and yes you're correct about the diode design of the TB-303.   If you like rubbery sounding filters - have you heard the Minibrute filter? Take a listen to it in this song of mine - They use a Steiner-Parker multi-mode filter which offers a 12dB/octave low-pass mode, and 6dB/octave high-pass, band-pass and notch modes. I did a little research on this - and discovered that the Steiner-Parker synth - Synthacon - used a Sallen-Key topology filter design. More can be explained here. The downfall is possibly the lack of 24dB LP mode - something that the Bass Station II has. But their filter is nowhere near as aggressive.   Incidentally, the Jupiter 8 has the same filter as the SH-101 :)  Interesting thread idea BTW :)"
synthesizers,3ao8pl,ranzee,3,Mon Jun 22 05:16:24 2015 UTC,"The 101 and jp-8 do use the same chip, but the JP-8 has a HPF before the IR3109 and has a tap point to allow 12dB and 24dB modes.  The 4xOTA design of the chip is Roland's version of the CEM3320 and SSM2040, all of which can be configured as a state-variable filter with simultaneous HP/BP/LP/Notch outputs."
synthesizers,3ao8pl,Lurkmcgirk,3,Mon Jun 22 10:43:02 2015 UTC,"The downfall is possibly the lack of 24dB LP mode   This is just my personal opinion, but I almost always prefer 12dB LP filters. I don't know, I guess I just find 24dB to be just a bit too dark for my taste. The general exception is when I'm going to distort the shit out of something I prefer a 24dB because it usually comes out less messy."
synthesizers,3ao8pl,TheUglyHobo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:14:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  I love 12db filters too.  MS-20, SEM, Odyssey MkI.  Oddly enough I'm not a fan of the Minibrute filter and I love the MS-20.  I find them similar.  I think it's because the Minibrute has a very clean signal path outside the Brutefactor and the MS-20 is noisy all around."
synthesizers,3ao8pl,Rust_Creep,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:48:48 2015 UTC,important point. i think most distortion sounds best on wave forms with fewer harmonics... this is aided by a stepper filter cutoff

But their filter is nowhere near as aggressive.   While this is perhaps true, I found the BSII to be quite aggressive. But it all depends on what you mean with the term. The Steiner-Parker filter is very ""harsh"" (in a really good way), but the BSII is more like a ladder filter. Really thick/fat, especially if you overdrive it."
synthesizers,3ao8pl,ranzee,2,Mon Jun 22 09:53:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The MiniBrute also has Brute Factor (basically overdrive) - which then things go really crazy. So for me it can sound a little more growly/knarly than a BS2 ... and I do like the term harsh. One of the things that a lot of people don't realise is that the Oscillators tend to overdrive - so if you want to tame the MB, you don't push the Oscillator level sliders over 1/2 way.   With the BS2 - I do like the 24dB filter - it is a really nice sound - very similar to Roland's."
synthesizers,3ao8pl,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:59:21 2015 UTC,"Sallen–Key topology:       The Sallen–Key topology is an electronic filter topology used to implement second-order active filters that is particularly valued for its simplicity.  It is a degenerate form of a voltage-controlled voltage-source (VCVS) filter topology. A VCVS filter uses a super-unity-gain voltage amplifier with practically infinite input impedance and zero output impedance to implement a 2-pole (12 dB/octave) low-pass, high-pass, or bandpass response. The super-unity-gain amplifier allows for very high Q factor and passband gain without the use of inductors. A Sallen–Key filter is a variation on a VCVS filter that uses a unity-gain amplifier (i.e., a pure buffer amplifier with 0 dB gain). It was introduced by R. P. Sallen and E. L. Key of MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 1955.     Image i     Relevant: Electronic filter topology | Butterworth filter | Electronic filter | Linear filter   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

It's taken a few years to get my home studio up to snuff piece by piece, so now it's really about staying on budget while trying to work less so I can further develop my process.  It can be hard because with this job employers are always trying to get you to come in and work more shifts, which can be good if specifically saving for a specific piece of gear.  Works for me, and thankfully my girlfriend and I aren't very materialistic so it all balances out.  It can be very stressful, but at the end of the day I make a living helping others, which feels nice."

Pres & eq sound amazing, and I can’t wait to try an analog mix with the 16x16 I/O!  FYI you need to run a terminal hack to get the drivers working in osx Yosemite, which worked flawlessly, but compromises security on your machine... So you have to be willing to live with that (or roll back to an earlier version of osx).  My only selfish wish is that they made a ""mixing"" version with compressors instead of aux sends on the channel strips, since most people will probably use DAW sends for automation when mixing. But that’s probably not even practical."

synthesizers,3anloj,dbalatero,2,Sun Jun 21 23:58:46 2015 UTC,"So, at first I had wanted to do the entire album with my CS5, and most of the songs use it for most of the stuff or all of it, and there are two songs that I used a Waldorf Blofeld for almost all of it, and then there is a song that I had used the web application audiotool, but limiting myself to the CS5(for the most part) changed my approach by the way I looked at sound design. I normally don't pay as much attention to detail with sounds if I were using software synths only and this made me really think about that more, along with having a greater sense of how to get the sounds I wanted out of a (subtractive) synth. I also tried to play as much of the synth parts as possible by hand, which I think made me more focused on recording when I would go to make a song."

synthesizers,3amtqo,Zombieskank,5,Sun Jun 21 19:44:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe Virus TI for versatility, and because it is capable of atmospheric sounds too. You can also check Waldorf Blofeld."
synthesizers,3amtqo,exculted,5,Sun Jun 21 20:20:08 2015 UTC,"What kind of music do you make? What's your budget? Do you want to go analog or digital? You have mentioned that you already own Komplete so pretty much any polysynth can be used to create soundscapes with all the FX you have. Digital synths, however, are usually better for making weird spacey patches.  As /u/exculted pointed out, Blofeld is a fantastic synth for this kind of stuff, extremely versatile, too, in my opinion, one of my favourite digital synths.  FM/PD synths are usually pretty cheap, and combined with some fx plugins and/or external programmers, can create crazy soundscapes.  There are multiple plug-in synths that can achieve what you want, too. My favourites are LinPlug Spectral - a great waveshaping synth and Madrona Labs Aalto - a Buchla ""clone"". Again, I tend to use them with external fx, since, in my opinion, it allows for more versatility, but they are powerful on their own right, too.  A lot of people use synths like Roland V-synth for 'spacey atmospheric type stuff', but I find them too cheesy / not pleasant to patch, so, keep in mind, my recommendations are not exactly orthodox. It really does depend on what kind of music you make and the kind of aesthetic you're after."

It's got a very clean sound that takes effects well, but I'd recommend getting one that's modded with individual outputs to get the best out of this. The main issue with them is that they weren't especially well made, and they're all a bit old, so buttons can be stiff. Also, they don't MIDI synch, and getting them to do so is expensive.   It's a fun little thing that forces you to be creative."

Roland haven't announced such an addon yet, but I live in hope..."

synthesizers,3alybc,YuOrSeLf,6,Sun Jun 21 15:00:04 2015 UTC,"Live sampling. That's going to be one of the big benefits of the Octatrack over your current setup. It's also incredibly easy after only a day or so of diving in to manipulate sample loops into different sounds, building evolving loops, etc. That said, it absolutely requires you to spend the time actually diving in and reading the manual, this is not an instrument that's usable without reading the manual IMHO.    The main drawback to the Octatrack is simply that its workflow is very unique and anyone just looking for something to immediately build basic drum loops, it's going to be overkill and there are other better solutions in the market. But if you're interested in pushing the boundaries on what you can do with building evolving loops, live looping, making soundscapes, then that's where I find the Octatrack really becomes a special tool.    If you find that your 404+ESX is too limiting for you, then I think the Octatrack will definitely open up more doors."
synthesizers,3alybc,rageplatypus,3,Sun Jun 21 15:50:02 2015 UTC,"I don't have an Octatrack so my opinion isn't going to be worth that much, I'm sure that someone will chime in with real experience.  But the Octatrack has changed a lot of people's whole approach to making music and incites creativity.  The main criticisms I have seen from it are that there is a steep learning curve, and the FX are less than stellar.  Just on paper I would think it'd be superior to the SP-404 plus ESX.  I don't think you can do 'live sampling' and mangling on those can you?"
synthesizers,3alybc,ZephrimC,3,Sun Jun 21 15:20:58 2015 UTC,"no not at all, at least not while synced. i could play a sequence on the electribe and sample on the 404, but even the 404 is kinda obsolete compared to the esx."

synthesizers,3alybc,rodentdp,4,Sun Jun 21 15:36:01 2015 UTC,"You will never use the SP or Electribe after getting an Octatrack, I promise you that.

Depending on the model, it may be worth putting on the chopping block."
synthesizers,3alybc,the_cody,2,Sun Jun 21 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"thanks for the reply, i have an mpc 1000 that i paid 100 bucks for because it was ""broken"". just a loose cable on the inside. 16mb ram."
synthesizers,3alybc,xmnstr,2,Sun Jun 21 22:17:16 2015 UTC,"Oh, very nice. I would hold onto that, upgrade the RAM (should cost no more than $20), and install JJOS2XL if you haven't already. Depending on what you are looking for, that may actually negate needing an Octatrack, not that I'd ever try talking someone out of an OT."
synthesizers,3alybc,gcheliotis,4,Sun Jun 21 23:45:53 2015 UTC,"The Octatrack has some limitations that might annoy you at first.  Like, it's only 4 bars max length. But, if you're playing a sliced up loop, you can set that track to be half time (so you would get 8 measures of 8th notes, rather than 4 measures of 16th notes) while the other tracks did normal time (and you can add in fills by making some notes ""one-shot"" and turn them on by holding the ""yes"" key as it plays).  Or, it's only 8 tracks. But, each track can play a different sample per note. And samples can be sliced into 64 slices, meaning you could just line up 64 kicks slice that to have it be one sample (commonly referred to as octachains). Meaning out of the 128 flex slots and 128 static slots, using 64 slice chains, you could potentially load 16,384 samples at one time.  Not to mention, the on screen editing of samples is really great for hardware.  The effects are pretty good. Just don't expect Eventide or Lexicon and you'll be ok with them. You get two slots per track. Plus you can turn track 8 into a master track, and run track 1-7 into it (for compression or filtering or beat repeat type effects). And there are four parts per bank (sort of like a kit), so you can change the part and have different effects in the master track (this would be the simplest use of parts).  Also, not to mention scenes and parameter locks. Where it's exceedingly easy to automate parameters on steps. And, it's exceedingly easy to automate parameters with the fader. You can drastically mangle everything with one fader slide or a scene change (hold one of the two scene buttons next to the fader and select another scene from the 16 steps).  There is definitely a learning curve. But that's mainly from unlearning the mentality from other gear, while learning the Elektron way of doing things."
synthesizers,3alybc,livefreshness,3,Sun Jun 21 18:13:23 2015 UTC,"It all depends on if you can learn to like the way the OT works. Both the 404 and ESX are comparably simple to use and OT is a very complex machine. The interface is not always straightforward.  In my opinion, you'll get more out of the OT if you let it's strengths shape your workflow rather than you trying to fit it into your workflow. It has a lot of functions but it certainly can't replace the functionality that a computer has when it comes to sample mangling. And vice versa.  These shortcomings may not be a problem for you, but it's worth knowing beforehand that many people end up selling them. They are not easy to get to know."
synthesizers,3alybc,gcheliotis,3,Sun Jun 21 18:55:31 2015 UTC,"That last part is frightening. I guess I really want to know if I will be able to turn on the Octatrack, load up a kit, lay down a track, record effect automations, and sequence it as quickly as I can with the electribe? With the electribe, its simply assign samples to pads, record the pattern, record the automation, copy and paste sequences, and so on. Fairly little menu diving unless I don't know what I'm looking for."
synthesizers,3alybc,xmnstr,2,Sun Jun 21 22:31:38 2015 UTC,"It will be similar, with one caveat: you've been told the OT can do much more, right? In order to allow for much more, it's got added options and some extra complexity in places. So it takes some practice and reading through sections of the admittedly very dull manual so you don't get lost in these extra features as a beginner with the OT. You can be and will be as fast as with the  ESX. But the general rule applies: the simpler the machine, the more immediate it is. If you want an OT because it does more, you'll have to deal with some added complexity in parts. But the more you use it, the more it will remind you of the Electribe, while at the same time taking you to new places the ESX wouldn't."

synthesizers,3ak47o,borgs_of_canada,2,Sun Jun 21 20:37:17 2015 UTC,I don't have one so I can't comment. I do have the midi thru box made by the same person but that one isn't a kit.  I can say the midi box is super well thought out and helped pull my whole system together

synthesizers,3ajam7,i_crave_more_cowbell,5,Sat Jun 20 19:12:23 2015 UTC,"Based on the video sounds, and keep in mind I've never heard a Mopho in real life, but the DS has a harsher, cold, metallic sound to it. The sub is like swimming in warm molasses, and the Mopho is like taking the ice bucket challenge. Neither is good or bad, and everyone may disagree with that, could just be my ears, but take it into consideration and the music you would like to make. making softer atmospheric, etheral sounds may be a stronger point on the phatty, or on the other hand you may want a juxtaposition and something to cut through a little more than in a lot of music you hear like that. But to me, that would be my main consideration, more than amount of keys, though ease and comfort of use would still be pretty big."
synthesizers,3ajam7,Std_Factory,3,Sat Jun 20 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. I was looking to make more ambient style stuff, so I guess that's another point for the Phatty."
synthesizers,3ajam7,xmnstr,3,Sat Jun 20 21:28:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say the Mopho is plenty warm, but it is absolutely harsher. The Phatties have a quite soft quality to them, but I don't always find them warm. I am a bit biased since I sold my Slim Phatty and kept my Mopho, but I feel that the Mopho has a wider range of sounds. The sound of the Phatty really shines through no matter what how you program it, and that's either a good thing or a bad thing depending on if you like it or not.  The Phatty does have a nicer filter, that's something I will have to admit."
synthesizers,3ajam7,t0xicd0g,5,Sat Jun 20 22:12:26 2015 UTC,"Both are fab pieces of gear that will do whatever you ask of them. The question you need to answer for yourself is whether you like the sound of one over the other. The Mopho can be polychained with a Tetra to make it into a 5 voice synth though, so there's that as a possibility for future expansion."
synthesizers,3ajam7,t0xicd0g,4,Sat Jun 20 22:26:24 2015 UTC,"Does that mean that the Mopho would be Polyphonic? Ah, nevermind, I looked it up, the tetra is around $800, getting both will be out of my price range for a while. Still good to know."
synthesizers,3ajam7,t0xicd0g,4,Sat Jun 20 22:29:44 2015 UTC,"Yep. The Tetra, Mopho, Mopho X4 and Prophet 08 all share the same synth engine (except the Mophos and Tetra have the extra sub oscillators that the Prophet doesn't) and can be chained together for polyphony. I'm looking to get a Mopho X4 to turn my Tetra into an 8 voice poly that's effectively a Prophet 08 killer with the feedback and subs. Polychaining is also practically invisible when set up; any edit to the sound you make on the master keyboard is copied on the slave unit or units, even down to saving patches and naming them.  Awesome as the Mopho is, as a poly it's devastating."
synthesizers,3ajam7,xmnstr,5,Sat Jun 20 22:33:16 2015 UTC,"That's great info. I'll bookmark this for later.   Also, intent is sometimes difficult to read over internet lol. When you say it's a devastating poly, that's a good devastating, right?"
synthesizers,3ajam7,Awkwardlittleboy2112,5,Sat Jun 20 22:36:51 2015 UTC,"Oh hell yes, really powerful sound to it; I know some people rag on the Curtis filters but I haven't heard many synths that seethe with so much power in their sounds as the Mopho/Tetra setup."
synthesizers,3ajam7,xmnstr,6,Sat Jun 20 22:41:53 2015 UTC,"I think the Sub Phatty would be a better choice. Not because it sounds better, but because the interface is better. I really like my Mopho Keyboard but let's be honest, it's not the best synth to program from the panel. They layout is kinda weird. The Sub Phatty has a much better layout and will help you learn to use synths and twiddle more effeciently.  If we're going for sound only the Mopho wins for me easily."
synthesizers,3ajam7,xmnstr,3,Sat Jun 20 19:53:18 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I like the sound from the Phatty more, but that's totally opinion oriented. You still think the Phatty has an easier interface, even with the under the hood/shift mode features?"
synthesizers,3ajam7,Awkwardlittleboy2112,3,Sat Jun 20 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"I'd say so, it has more controls on the panel, and even though it has some""under the hood"" functions, the majority of stuff is right there.   Sorry /u/xmnstr for jumping in front of you."
synthesizers,3ajam7,Awkwardlittleboy2112,5,Sat Jun 20 21:52:15 2015 UTC,"Oh don't worry about that, more perspectives will only help OP."

synthesizers,3ajam7,Quickslickdick,5,Sat Jun 20 22:08:20 2015 UTC,What do you plan on using it for?
synthesizers,3ajam7,tripngroove,3,Sat Jun 20 21:54:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a bass player for the most part, and I use a lot of effects. I was gonna use it for basslines and for some ambient/drone stuff. Also I've got some Moogerfooger pedals and a moog expression pedal (along with a bunch of MXR, Boss and other stuff) I was gonna use with it."
synthesizers,3ajam7,sdconvoy,6,Sat Jun 20 22:22:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely go for the Phatty then. Amazing for bass, and responds to effects very well. The few times I've played the MoPho it's been best for leads and FX."
synthesizers,3ajam7,naturalscience,3,Sat Jun 20 23:18:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm getting the idea that they're both great, but the SP is probably better for what I'm doing."
synthesizers,3ajam7,naturalscience,3,Sat Jun 20 23:31:59 2015 UTC,"Both are great synths. While I prefer the filter sound of the Sub slightly I ended up getting the SE, partly because I got a great deal.  Also, I really like playing a 44 key more than a 25 key keyboard.  The SE really wins when it comes to modulation and the amount of control over sound you have. Velocity, aftertouch, mod wheel, etc. are all assignable to many destinations letting you really play with sound in an interactive way. The extra envelope and 4 LFOS are pretty amazing as well ."
synthesizers,3ajam7,yoplate,3,Sun Jun 21 03:32:03 2015 UTC,"I've owned the mopho and currently have a sub phatty. I never really liked the character of the mopho's Curtis filter. It just seemed to plain to me. Also, programming it didn't feel as gratifying as the sub phatty. There's lots of modulation capabilities and a sequencer but I don't know if that's important to you.  Now, as someone mentioned, the Moog is creamier sounding and smoother but there's that nice multidrive knob in the filter section that makes it sound more gritty and aggressive. And bass, yeah the Moog does bass for days. For me the mopho didn't quite cut it for a ""go to"" bass machine. I'd go for the sub phatty."
synthesizers,3ajam7,nikofeyn,3,Sun Jun 21 06:11:55 2015 UTC,"I own and use both of these regularly. Here's my take:  If there's a spectrum of synth use that ranges from sound design/producer on one end to live performance on the other, the Mopho is more for the producer and the Sub Phatty is more for the performer.  The Mopho has many more options for creating interesting sounds. The internal sequencer, aux envelope, arpeggiator, and aftertouch (to name a few) will let you create patches that aren't possible to even approximate on the Sub Phatty.  That said, you can pretty much fire up the Sub Phatty and have it sound good. The panel design has all the most basic controls laid out in such a way that anything you would reasonably want to tweak while you're on stage is there waiting for you. The Moog filter has a character that plays nice with other instruments, and the drive section adds some crunch/harmonics back in after you've cut what you want with the filter.  In summary:   Both are awesome and you'll be totally stoked with either If you're playing live, go with the Sub Phatty If you're producing, go with the Mopho   From a value perspective, I think you're getting more bang for your buck from the Mopho, purely based on the feature set.  Also, I respectfully disagree with whoever said the Mopho is difficult to program. I've had much more trouble with the Sub Phatty and all the damn hidden functions. On the Mopho everything is there on the display - no mysteries."
synthesizers,3ajam7,DoucheyMcBagBag,3,Sun Jun 21 07:32:57 2015 UTC,"I own both big brother synths, the sub 37 and the prophet 08, and they are both incredible, but completely different character wise, which actually leads them to compliment each other very well. The pr08 family of dsi instruments do anything brash and brassy supremely well. Bright leads, sound fx,  and even some bass sounds. Infinite modulation possibilities with 4lfos and the 3rd envelope. That being said, The sub family has a hefty sound that I can't seem to get out of the prophet, and is a ton warmer (protip: I see a lot of people rag on the sub as being cold or harsh, but if you keep the gain structure reasonable, it's super smooth and warm), and the interface is great!"
synthesizers,3ai9ud,mdrsharp,6,Sat Jun 20 13:08:24 2015 UTC,So if it's a link we should have some kind of explanatory comment?

synthesizers,3ai9ud,mrcolonist,7,Sat Jun 20 14:50:01 2015 UTC,"I understand and agree with the reasons why you require explanation of user-created videos, photos, recordings, etc., but don't always see the need to summarize other links particularly press release type items you see on sonicstate or syntopia.

It's very basic Reddiquette as well. Sure, a lot of subreddits are link dumps, but the mods have expressively said that this is a subreddit for discussion, so if someone links e.g. something from Sonic State, then that someone might as well post something worth discussing as well."
synthesizers,3ai9ud,mrcolonist,7,Sat Jun 20 16:09:36 2015 UTC,"Why don't we just make it so videos and images have to be submitted as self-posts?

I appreciate that the mods are trying to keep the signal to noise ratio high but requiring a comment on every post seems excessive. Right now 5/10 of the top posts are videos / photos where OP didn't leave an initial comment, and those are all valuable.  If there's a cool video of someone playing a synth I don't need OP to add a comment ""Hey guys I found this video and thought it was pretty cool, hope you enjoy!""

There's a lot of personalities & tastes on this sub & to be honest it isn't that good about inclusion. We all created a culture that exalts machines over the hand that wields it & have praised mediocrity in it's wake. Honestly I find it fucking hilarious that a pic of a bass station & a laptop is getting a raised eyebrow when it could just as easily be ignored or dare I say ""downboated"", while something like ""I found a thing.."" warrants an actual discussion, though that may be because it is almost Tim & Eric purposefully bad, which is fine, but says a lot about us.

synthesizers,3ai9ud,remedial_dnd,8,Sat Jun 20 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"cause down deep everybody knows a good community is a completely free one even if it's ""inconvenient"" to your preferences.   Speak for yourself, I strongly disagree. In my experience, speaking as both a long-time user of reddit and a moderator of a subreddit an order of magnitude larger than this one, the best subreddits are always the ones with strong, benevolent moderation aimed at keeping a high level of quality content. When this isn't happening, you see growing subreddits overwhelmed with image macros, joke posts, spam, and other low-effort/low-quality content. The voting system comes back to bite everyone in the ass because it's much easier to upvote a mildly clever or interesting image than it is a lengthy but worthwhile self post.  There's nothing about moderation that inherently excludes diverse opinions, as you're implying. Our moderators aren't soviet dictators. If anything, guidelines like this one protect diversity of opinion by preventing higher-effort content from getting buried by stuff that's easy for the ""hive mind"" to collectively upvote.  If you really, truly think that the moderators reaffirming their dedication to a posting guideline that was already basically in place lowers the quality of this subreddit so completely that you choose to no longer participate, well, that's the beauty of reddit: as a whole, it is ""completely free"" and you are always welcome to start your own synth subreddit free from moderation.  The only other thing I'll say is that I think most people drastically underestimate how much moderation happens without anyone ever noticing. One of the reasons this sub is as high-quality as it has been is that we have hard-working mods removing the shitty posts nobody wants to see. Subreddits like this don't just spontaneously happen; they're curated."

synthesizers,3ai9ud,nikofeyn,7,Sat Jun 20 20:03:48 2015 UTC,I understand what you're saying but the point is that if I were to post a pic of my TR-8 that would make a post saying something like this...  I just picked up a TR-8 today.  I've always wanted an original 808 but there's no way I would dump $2K on one.  I make mostly 80's retro synth music and I think the TR-8 would be a great addition to my Juno-106.  If you'd like to hear my music here's a link to my soundcloud.  Now imagine that every photo or video/audio post had this? It would be engaging to the whole group.
synthesizers,3ai9ud,jepyang,6,Sat Jun 20 20:29:12 2015 UTC,"but see, that's what i'm saying. that type of description is only really needed on the ""look what i got"" picture posts, which to me are the only annoyances on this subreddit. i don't really give a shit about a picture about a sub 37 or bass station ii so somebody just posting a picture of a sub 37 is so banal that it really does need a comment. i do care if the comment brings out something to care about.  but an audio or video link with a descriptive title does not necessarily require a comment in my opinion. the content is unique enough that the title and the description in the link (like on youtube or soundcloud) are enough to generate discussion. forcing a comment on every audio and video post will feel like just repeating information already in the title, the content, or the description of the content on the target site.  i have posted a fair share of content on this subreddit, and i have never really felt like providing a comment on an audio or video post really helped generated discussion any more than normal.  basically, we should only be weeding out banal picture posts of common, mass-produced synths without explanations, descriptions, or comments.   example 1 - no original comment on video post, good discussion. example 2 - no original comment on video post, good discussion example 3 - no original comment on video post, good discussion example 4 - no original comment on video (audio only) post, good discussion example 5 - original comment on picture post (as per the new policy), but there was almost no discussion generated. even though i agree with comments needed on picture posts, they don't necessarily correlate to discussion generators. example 6 - audio post with original comment. no discussion even on a topic /r/synthesizers seems interested in (synths through effects). still, the post got good upvotes and thus had a positive contribution. but still no discussion generated from comment. example 6 - no original comment on video (audio only) post, good discussion.   in other words, this policy would have removed many posts with good discussions and left those with little discussion. in general, this subreddit is overly kind to photo posts and typically uninterested in audio posts, even with comments. the video posts seem to be the most successful with the most discussion, even without original comments. the photo posts are really the only thing bordering on a problem."
synthesizers,3ai9ud,grauniad_angel,8,Sat Jun 20 20:47:06 2015 UTC,Those are good points you bring up.    I think that audio posts would really benefit from the addition of a summary.   Something like...  This song was inspired by my love for 90's electronica.  It was sequenced with Ableton Live 7 and there was little done in terms of effects.  The main synths in the track are my Alpha Juno 2 and a casio CZ-1000 with delay.  It doesn't take a lot of explanation but that can spark a conversation and bring in people who have similar gear into the conversation.

It's a move toward encouraging higher quality content.  Is it really too much to include a sentence or two of description after being told it's a condition of posting a photo here?"
synthesizers,3ai9ud,nikofeyn,4,Sat Jun 20 20:39:30 2015 UTC,"just to be perfectly clear, i agree with applying the comment/discussion policy on posts that are simply picture posts of common synths. those are the posts that, without comments, add very little to this subreddit. i am simply disagreeing with blindly applying this policy outside of that scope."
synthesizers,3ai9ud,the_cody,6,Sat Jun 20 20:50:27 2015 UTC,"We all know what content is good and what content isn't. Generally, I leave good content, because it generally creates discussion anyway. The problem isn't that. The problem is bad content with no context that we will generally remove. If there isn't a clear and easy to understand rule explaining a pretty simple idea on how to not get their posts removed, some people get really angry and find examples of good content that was allowed to stay up without a post from OP. On occasion, these people go on down voting sprees or start posting really snarky (borderline rude) comments.  From my perspective, this is more about a simple rule than it is about generating discussion. Interesting content (whether it's good or bizarre or so bad it's funny) generates discussion, even if there is no original comment from OP. Boring content is spam at its worst and karma whoring at its best, neither of which tends to create discussions.  Right now, there isn't a lot of posts without comments. There are more than there normally have been. But, when this rule originally went in place (about a year ago), each of the mods was deleting several a day. More than enough to push good content off the first page.  None of us wants to remove content. This was a compromise between having a really complicated rule that no one would follow anyway, and, having no rule which would alienate people who thought the mods just made arbitrary decisions."
synthesizers,3ai9ud,jepyang,2,Sat Jun 20 21:18:16 2015 UTC,"this is more about a simple rule than it is about generating discussion   that's a little of my problem with it. for example, i have stopped going to and submitting to /r/listentothis because of their draconian insistence on simple rules. for example, i submitted the beastie boys' album the in sound from way out! there, and it was immediately removed. this was due to their ""simple"" rule that popular artists aren't allowed even though this album is relatively unknown and makes a great submission to /r/listentothis.  so in general, i am against the simple rule being applied outside of the posts that are just pictures of synths. i think it should be encouraged for audio posts to, for example, describe setups, inspirations, etc., but i don't really see how that helps mods distinguish from bad or good content. it certainly doesn't correlate to discussion.  i personally don't want to find good content, create a descriptive title, and then just blindly create a comment that duplicates what's in the title and content."
synthesizers,3ai9ud,nikofeyn,3,Sat Jun 20 21:25:26 2015 UTC,"The problem is that then the rule would be: ""Bad content with no active discussion will be removed at the mods' discretion."" Or, something incredibly complicated.  It might be confirmation bias, but I do see a correlation between the amount of initial discussion and whether the OP is participating.   i personally don't want to find good content, create a descriptive title, and then just blindly create a comment that duplicates what's in the title and content.   I completely understand where you're coming from on this.  The major part of this problem isn't regulars. It's people who aren't generally part of this community. Like I said, I tend to ignore the rule when it's good content already. It's nepotism, but I also tend to ignore it for regulars. And, if there is any discussion already, I never delete, because the stated reason for the rule is to encourage discussion. And, because we all have jobs, usually by the time I see a post that (by the strictest reading of the rule) needs moderation, it's already safe from moderation.  So, by the way that I tend to enforce the rule, I think the only posts that are in peril of deletion are bad posts from people who don't really know the community."
synthesizers,3ai9ud,jepyang,2,Sat Jun 20 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"this was due to their ""simple"" rule that popular artists aren't allowed even though this album is relatively unknown and makes a great submission to /r/listentothis.   This is not what I would call a simple rule. It relies on an arbitrary value judgement by the moderators, which is just about the worst way to go about curating content unless a mod just wants their own pet community.  What I see the mods doing here is the exact opposite of that. They're trying to take the guesswork out of submitting. Instead of wondering if an image of your new synth is interesting or rare enough to not get deleted, all you have to do is add a descriptive comment and bam, it's acceptable. The mods should be able to delete something, and when asked why, point to the rule and have any reasonable person say, ""oh, you're right, I didn't do that."""
synthesizers,3ai9ud,jepyang,2,Sat Jun 20 23:27:13 2015 UTC,"This is not what I would call a simple rule.   it actually is if you take a look at their side bar. that subreddit is almost exclusively auto-moderated by bots that read youtube views, last.fm followers, etc. and that's their problem. you can submit an almost completely unknown album or song that has just a few thousands views on youtube for an artist that happens to have a lot of last.fm followers due to their other work, and it will be removed automatically.  so despite their emphasis on new and overlooked music, they basically automatically remove any overlooked music from a semi-popular artist due to their enforcement of simple rules. it's been frustrating on many of my posts there, and i no longer go there."
synthesizers,3ai9ud,nikofeyn,3,Sun Jun 21 02:45:39 2015 UTC,But you understand that's not what's being proposed here?
synthesizers,3ai9ud,jepyang,2,Sun Jun 21 10:07:14 2015 UTC,I am willing to see how it works. There's a lot of video and audio content that falls into the same category of adding very little to our community. I have faith that the mods will continue to tweak and evolve our posting guidelines to meet the needs and desires of the community. It's when they fail to do so that I think people should get upset; not when they're making a good-faith effort to improve things.
synthesizers,3ai9ud,nikofeyn,2,Sat Jun 20 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"here's an example of how it would have worked.  so the policy would have blindly removed content that i feel generated good discussion and added something to this subreddit. and note that posts following the policy did not necessarily generate good discussion, although i feel like the content was decent enough to generate discussion. there are many more examples i am sure. the simple fact is that the policy, in my opinion, is only a good one for the simple picture posts i've mentioned."
synthesizers,3ai9ud,jepyang,2,Sat Jun 20 21:00:35 2015 UTC,"I mean, I agree completely that sometimes good content/discussion happens no matter what rules are being enforced. But the existence of these topics doesn't mean the new policy won't have a generally positive effect, nor does it mean that such content wouldn't have ended up here with the policy in effect (they could just as easily be submitted with a quick comment).  I really see no harm in letting the mods experiment with this. Give it some time, report posts that go against the policy (whether you approve or not; in the long run, it's beneficial to demonstrate what kind of content we might miss out on, let them see what kind of stuff ends up in the mod queue and let them see how much of it gets reposted properly.  The most important thing is just transparency from the moderators. Clear rules and explanations for their actions, and responses to issues brought up in mod mail. So long as we have that, it doesn't matter much what we could hypothetically miss out on because we can trust the mods to do their job well."
synthesizers,3ai9ud,sethescope,2,Sat Jun 20 22:57:00 2015 UTC,"that's a reasonable enough approach, but to be honest the policy is unclear (does it require a comment or not?), and i have better things to do with my time than to worry if my posts are meeting some strict guideline. i feel i submit high quality content, but in my experience, for subreddits that have blind rules, i visit them less and less."
synthesizers,3ai9ud,nikofeyn,2,Sat Jun 20 23:02:47 2015 UTC,"but to be honest the policy is unclear (does it require a comment or not?)   I don't think I understand what you think is unclear about the stated policy. Additionally, I struggle to think of a clearly statable policy that only excludes the uninteresting picture posts that pretty much everyone agrees are no good.  I would not necessarily be opposed to limiting this rule to images only, since that seems to be everyone's biggest beef, but I personally think it would be great for audio as well. Knowing a little about how/why people make the music they do gives me a lot more motivation to listen and discuss. I don't watch most videos so that matters less to me.  Can you suggest a clear policy that defines acceptable content from unacceptable? I agree that clearly stated and uniformly enforces guidelines are important; if people have to wonder, it hurts the sub."

synthesizers,3ai9ud,ScottFromCanada,2,Sat Jun 20 20:01:27 2015 UTC,"but i actually did make a comment with a question, and yet it has genereated zero discussion.   Anecdotal evidence doesn't necessarily show a trend. I agree with the mods on this one, because there has to be some kind of bar of posting. If someone goes through the effort to link something, then there should be a purpose with it — Why not state that purpose?  I don't quite understand all the fuss in this comment thread. It's such a small effort to put into your posts to promote discussion. Not all posts will lead to a discussion forming, but some will.  Then again, personally I dislike link dumping. I think it degrades subreddits to nothing more than what an RSS feed can be. We're here to discuss and be friends, not just throw links into the depths."
synthesizers,3ai9ud,ScottFromCanada,2,Sun Jun 21 09:18:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what I was just saying to mdrsharp is that the title usually explains it and I think most of what I've seen is always related in some way that we can figure out fairly easily.

The point is to spark conversation."
synthesizers,3ai9ud,kirklandish,2,Sat Jun 20 20:24:49 2015 UTC,Did you delete them right away? I was just thinking that I hadn't see anything that needed more of an explanation than what was already there (usually in the title) but maybe if they were already gone that's why I didn't see any.  The other thing you just made me realize is that anyone could spam their own OC that maybe had nothing to do with this sub. So in those cases I understand but hopefully that'll be pretty rare.
synthesizers,3ai9ud,dadRabbit,2,Sat Jun 20 20:34:27 2015 UTC,A message would be sent to the OP and he would be informed that his post will be removed because it requires an explanation.  He is free to post again as long as he adheres to the rule.
synthesizers,3ai9ud,the_cody,3,Sat Jun 20 20:43:38 2015 UTC,That's ok. It's mostly just the way this was posted that seemed like a threat rather than a request. I'm calmed down now. But at least it's generated some interesting discussion!

That's not a slight to the mods here, but reddit as a whole, cause it's bred a bad culture.

When I put something out into the world these days, it's a finished product. It's just not constructive for me to hear why someone does or doesn't like it. The shared piece is no longer getting worked on, and I have no interest in tailoring my future output to please others.  Yeah, I could always post a separate thread (and I have), but the communal aspect was nice too. We get a lot of individual ""listen to me!"" threads and I don't want to see them go anywhere, but they also don't tend to generate quite as much discussion.

With subtractive synthesis, it's often difficult to get a sound to seem to be actually evolving for a long period of time. But with FM, it's pretty simple, especially if you have several operators modulating each other with different slow envelope settings."
synthesizers,3afs7s,mrcolonist,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:03:08 2015 UTC,"Do you know where I could find some sort of guide to how to do that ? I have a recipe book for my tx81z, but I have a hard time making decent pads (or decent anything for that matter)."
synthesizers,3afs7s,borgs_of_canada,3,Sat Jun 20 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"This page is pretty decent, albeit not very updated: the-all.org/tx81z/  Other than that, I think the key is to not overdo the settings. For example, practice using algorithm one, and just two operators. Set OP1 at level 90, and OP2 and level 75 or so, and you'll have a decent FM sound. Then change the attack on OP1 to pretty slow, same with release. Then change OP2 so it has the same attack, but let it decay slowly afterwards (also put the release to like a number slower than the release for OP1).  Then you should have somewhat of a decent pad that should give some idea of how to do it.  Other than that, I like to adjust the levels and waveforms of everything before going into the EG settings. Maybe adjust frequencies as well. EG should really be the final 'shape' of the sound that you do. And always go back to the levels afterwards and play around a bit.  I think the manual is pretty good as well for understanding the TX81z, it really is quite a simple synthesizer but with lots of potential."

synthesizers,3afs7s,TheAnalogLights,2,Sat Jun 20 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"The DX7 gets a bad rap because of its slow and annoying interface (programming 6 modulators, all with separate envelope times and levels all through one slider and keypad has to be one of the tedious methods of programming a synth I have seen) and the slightly unintuitive nature of FM synthesis compared to analogue (which leaves a synth with some cheesy eighties style presets). But perseverance and reading and practice makes FM actually a great source of weird electronic sounds that veer into the metallic, the crispy, the bright; a whole palette unreachable by analogues or virtual analogues. Also, programming the DX7 has never been easier since Dexed became available."

I'd only seen this video previously, but it's pretty rad  http://youtu.be/EAskx5LC0iQ  The vids you posted were great too, but I would get a new stand if I were that dude. I'm pretty sure these are based on (SSM2044) chips, I've looked in to a couple of their other boxes before.  One was programmable and had Curtis chips, one was a preset box and had a Motorola or something.   iirc, they started out making a go of it and were bought by Gibson or someone similar who didn't appreciate the potential, ran it into ground.    Edit: found the schematics, looks like there are three SSM2044 filter chips inside for the synth sounds.  Not sure about waveform generation, though.

Depending on the price and condition I will pick it up I think-it sounds excellent from the videos I've seen, and skimming the manual it looks like you can set each part to a different midi channel, as well as individual audio outputs for each part.   What would you consider as a reasonable price for one of these?"
synthesizers,3ag5jc,Lurkmcgirk,4,Fri Jun 19 23:07:54 2015 UTC,"To me, it would be worth a couple hundred bucks, at least:  synth voice with sequencer and drum tracks, small enough to gig with, enough on its own to be a sketch pad for future tracks.  It may not have the pedigree of other brands, and kinda looks like a weird Jupiter-6/Poly-61 half-brother, but listen to it!  Sounds great!  I personally dig italo-disco, so the pedigree it does have would not be lost on me.    I'm not sure I'd go into debt to get one, and I can see someone asking $500 in today's market, especially if they know it has analog filters.  But for $2-300, I could see it getting a lot of use.  Bit of a shame that it has clock out but not clock in, but I guess I'd just slave it to midi."

There were a number of similar things starting in the late 70s, mostly sold in Europe. They eventually evolved into arranger keyboards. The advantage of this one is that the accompaniment patterns can be programmed, and it has MIDI.  Waveform generation is 2x SGS M112, the same DCO chip used in the Siel DK 70 and DK 80 (and a lot of organs). It's also got a stereo 3 BBD string ensemble chorus.

synthesizers,3aedql,ScottFromCanada,17,Fri Jun 19 13:09:30 2015 UTC,"Day 102, I am officially the last person on earth who does not own an Odyssey. Well, at least that's some kind of achievement.  So I decided to resolve a couple of things from my past. My first synth ever back in 1979 was a Yamaha CS-10. I thought it was cool for a while but then grew to hate it. It just wasn't very useful in a world where multi-tracking at home would cost a minimum of $75,000 and hearing it through my old, crappy (blown speakers) Traynor guitar amp, no effects, wasn't helping either. So I sold it in 1983, traded it actually, for a cheap guitar.   But now that I have a bunch of synths I've been getting curious about how it actually sounded and what I would think if it now. So I found an auction for one that was going fairly cheap, but supposedly works, and got it with no other bidders. It's on it's way from Japan so it might be another week before I get it.  A few months after I bought the first CS-10, back in '79 or maybe it was 1980 by that time, the store got a new synth in, the CS-15. What the.... it was SOOOO much better than the 10!! I played with that thing every time I went into the store and felt horrible that I didn't get that one.   So, long story short, it's another one of those unresolved things that has been bugging me for quite a while now (well, for about 35 years!) and I mentioned to the ebay guy that I would be looking for one in a few months. He immediately offered my his and gave me a discount. I didn't want to spend more money but it was in perfect condition, supposedly just checked out by a technician and comes with the original case. So after thinking it over for a few days I bought that one too.   Even though it's just a small synth that I probably wont use that often, I'm pretty excited about it! It'll be at least 2 weeks before it arrives but that will be a very happy day indeed!  Odyssey, shmodyssey!"
synthesizers,3aedql,rodentdp,4,Fri Jun 19 13:57:48 2015 UTC,"At the rate you are going, you will need to build another studio space to put the Odyssey in once you finally receive it."
synthesizers,3aedql,ScottFromCanada,3,Fri Jun 19 18:26:35 2015 UTC,The rate is ramping down now. I hope. Just one more module I want to get and later some of the new roland modules. Hopefully I can resist more keyboards for a while.

synthesizers,3aedql,krapduude,6,Sat Jun 20 15:57:53 2015 UTC,"I recently bought my first hardware synth, an ms-20 mini and shortly after a volca sample and a Mackie mixer. Now I'm considering completing my basic setup with a Nord Lead 4. Both to get some polyphony, and a controller with more keys than my old 25 key m-audio oxygen keyboard.  My biggest issue with this is that I haven't really got enough music production experience to warrant buying more gear without actually producing anything of value. I'm mostly just enjoying playing around and recording some small things for myself, and a friend who actually knows what he's doing regarding music production giving me some feedback. Heck, I just recently learned to play chords :P I can afford to buy the Nord lead. I'm just worried I'm throwing myself into this carelessly.  I guess this is more of a luxury problem, but the recent weeks I haven't been able to stop thinking about synthesizers, and music production. I'm mostly trying to keep myself from buying everything I want asap...  End of ramble, but this is what's been going through my head lately."
synthesizers,3aedql,sheboygan_sexpo,9,Fri Jun 19 13:44:15 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the never-ending spiral of Gear Acquisition Syndrome!  Just as a personal recommendation, I'd buy a cheaper polyphonic synth before you go after the Nord. Undoubtedly a great synth, but it's on the high end of the affordable synth spectrum and if you find yourself head over heels with all of the features and parameters, it could lead to frustration. Why'd you decide on the Lead 4 in particular?"
synthesizers,3aedql,krapduude,2,Fri Jun 19 13:55:06 2015 UTC,"Well at first I was looking at just getting a larger midi keyboard. Mostly because I wanted to start practicing more ""proper"" keyboard playing. But after some thinking I figured I could use some more synth power, polyphony and all to actually play chords. The Nord lead had me swayed pretty early on, but was initially looking at the A1. The price difference between that and the lead 4 wasn't that big though. So ended up there.  The morph features seem really nice to me, and the ability to layer up to four sounds makes for some pretty interesting stuff. Also having the arpeggiator and effects clock synced seem really nice. Also it being made in Sweden is a nice bonus, being a swede :)  Also, I want to avoid buying something ""lesser"" that makes me want to buy something new to replace it very soon. It usually tends to get more expensive in the end :P  But if you have any cheaper recommendations, I'd gladly take a look at them either way."
synthesizers,3aedql,sheboygan_sexpo,7,Fri Jun 19 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"If you take a look into the previous Leads, they'll be able to do everything you mentioned (except effects). Getting one used would cost substantially less and you'd still have the same Nord sound. It would offer a fantastic way of getting your polyphonic fix and if you feel it's lacking in any way, you'd likely be able to sell it and upgrade without any money loss. I'm not entirely sure how vast the secondhand market is for you in Sweden, but good synthesizers generally retain their resale value. I've swapped out a few synths so far and haven't lost any money in the process (also, from what I hear, /u/slujj-vohaul could write a book on the revolving door policy of gear.).  Ultimately, even a ""lesser"" synth could likely fulfill your polyphonic desires (but again, the secondhand market probably isn't as robust as it is in the states). You definitely have options. To name a few,  Access Virus TI, Yamaha AN1x, Waldorf Blofeld, Nord Lead 3, Novation KS4, Roland JP-8000, so on and so forth."

Given how often I flip stuff, I'd say I lose around ~ $150 a year, which is pretty negligible IMO. Buying used or getting at least 15% off on new stuff is my rule for shopping. If you don't need the money ASAP and rush a sale, you can generally get a good return on something provided you kept the gear in great condition.  I really think I'm done GASing for awhile though, feeling pretty ""feature complete"" as ouij put it the other week."

But I'll definitely take look at the ones you mentioned.  The second hand market does look a bit stale in Sweden, and the ones for sale I've seen usually don't do postal delivery. It's a small but really tall country :P picking stuff up is sort of tedious."

I've now ordered a Waldorf Blofeld Keyboard :) after looking into all the suggestions this one caught my eye the most. Also helped that I found a online Swedish site which had about a $100 off atm. $740 in total.   It seems a tad more menu divey than the Nord, but really smartly done. And sounds awesome! And also the sample memory as an added bonus. And aftertouch even. Probably not something I need initially, but nice to have in the future."
synthesizers,3aedql,sheboygan_sexpo,3,Mon Jun 22 10:18:28 2015 UTC,"No problem! The Blofeld is an amazing synth, but it's capabilities might be daunting at first. If you haven't yet, I'd highly, highly recommend watching this video series on subtractive synthesis. It's a little dry, but if you follow along and actually do what he does (such as mess with the envelopes and filter and whatnot), it'll go a really long way. Not only will you learn where to locate all of these features on the Blofeld (everything he mentions will have an equivalent parameter on your synth), but you'll be come away with some really great knowledge on synthesizing a sound from scratch on your own.  If you have any questions about it later on, feel free to send me a message. I'm still figuring out everything, but the basics aren't too hard to comprehend. And the manual is essentially a tutorial on all it's capabilities, offering a lot of ""try this to get this sound"" tips."

We'll see how that goes further down the line :)  Thanks again!  EDIT: and yes I did actually once start watching that video series heh, and you're right it's sort of dry.

Theer are a few crappy ones to maybe avoid, but by and large the world of virtual analogues like the Nord is populated by much cheaper and arguably just as good if not better machines that are cheap just because they are older; the Alesis Ion blows the Nords out of the water for sheer depth; the Supernova 2 has separate effects for each part so you don't have to share delays or reverbs etc; the KingKorg can be had reasonably on the used market now and sounds much more convincingly analogue than almost anything else I've heard; and even further down the price scale are the MS2000, JP8080, NOvation KS4/5, Yamaha AN1x, all of which are superb synths in their own right and more than capable of being the sole synth at the heart of any half decent setup.   You aren't really losing much by getting cheaper, you're just getting different. Nords have always had a price premium and not always, I feel, a deserved one - they are good synths, but not amazing ones, and certainly not twice the synth of models selling for half the price."
synthesizers,3aedql,bodekmusic,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:49:57 2015 UTC,"For more proper keyboard playing I would just look into buying a cheap used weighted electronic piano with at least 76 keys; you should be able to find something for around $200-300. Something you could do with this would be to figure out the chords you want to use on the piano and then multitrack your monosynth, or maybe sample notes on your volca sample and use that for polyphony (which I think you can do? I don't know much about the volca series, but I do this on my e-mu esi32 sometimes).  That said I think the nord lead would be a worthy purchase, and it would likely teach you a lot."

The good thing is that most gear has decent resale value, so you can generally get a good chunk of money back down the line if you need/want to.

No matter, I have other things to cover that and I can use the acid8 sequencer to sequence them. Some of the triangle and sine wave variations on there are nasty too.

I've been restoring it to glory since then but it hasn't been easy.   I opened up the keybed and removed each and every key in order to get the dust out from under all the keys so they're now working like a charm.   I replaced the coil to the display since they so commonly fail but it turns out that might not have been the issue. I was really bummed when the screen didn't work so I contacted the maker of they coil for ideas and he suggested testing the related components. I found a bad transistor and a bad capacitor and the voltage to the board is 10.2 instead of the stated 7V.   I'm not quite sure what's causing the higher voltage but I'm keen to get to the bottom of it (I did trace it as far back as the rectifier). I found a replacement transistor online and replaced that last night. I hope to sort out the power issue and replace the bad capacitor as soon as I can get to the store to grab one.   I'm really wondering what happened to this thing to make these odd parts fail. Maybe it was hit by a power surge? Anyhow, next up is replacing the firmware with Vecoven's chip so I can use my BCR2000 as a poor man's PG-800 and finally see what this thing can do :)  Edit: it's alive!! Still running too many volts, but after replacing those parts, my screen came back to life! I can finally see what's going on."
synthesizers,3afhl1,24Track,3,Fri Jun 19 18:31:17 2015 UTC,"I would check the knobs. A couple of mine started to get wobbly within the first year of ownership. Also, make sure it is a MkII. There have been a few versions-the MkI can only do 32 steps, while the MkII does 64, so that should be your first clue. The UW is for sampling, and the +Drive option is additional storage for samples and patterns. I would not pay a lot for a MkI these days, as the reason a MkII was created in the first place was because of the scarcity of parts for the MkI. If you have a problem with it, it will probably not be worth the cost of sourcing parts and repair.   As far as how I like it? It's the best digital drum synth/drum machine on the planet (in hardware, anyhow...I'm sure someone could take issue with all the software options out there). Insanely versatile. You can get weird and wild with it without too much effort, but if you really want to get the most out of it, be prepared to spend some time with the manual."
synthesizers,3afhl1,rodentdp,2,Fri Jun 19 18:54:24 2015 UTC,I second checking the knobs. I had a used machine drum that someone had opened and cleaned. The knobs stuck out more than other electron hardware and one was bent. The machine seemed to be more fragile after being tampered with. Other than that just make sure all the inputs/outputs and midi work. Mine had a bit of a feedback problem as well after the unit had been on for a few minutes. I have a feeling that is a result of the previous owner messing with it. Elektron hardware is built really well so if there is a flaw you should be able to notice it.

synthesizers,3afhl1,rodentdp,2,Fri Jun 19 20:14:04 2015 UTC,"Yes...if you use the machines that have retrigger capabilities, you can play with the retrigger rate, and use p-locks and LFOs to adjust the roll to taste. Slide triggers are helpful for this too if you p-lock. Personally, I like using LFOs to control volume as well for a more natural feel-it's the Machinedrum's way of applying velocity. EDIT: you can see it in action here.  Not to dissuade you from your purchase, but this is one of the advantages of the sampling capabilities, as those machines have retriggering built in. Even if you never load in a sample externally, you can resample whatever you do within the machine. I think that's where the magic is."
synthesizers,3afhl1,NuMux,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:00:43 2015 UTC,Another option is to have two tracks with the same sound on it. One tracks has the roll pattern while the other is the normal beat. Unmute the roll track for the effect.

The ZR76 never sounded as good to us, so we never upgraded.     a hint for the sequence pausing - if you keep the same programs on the same tracks between sequences, that wont happen.    What we used to do was start with the first sequence, then copy it, erase the midi, and then record the second part.   pain in the butt, but it goes fast once you remember the button presses."

Once I realised that I started messing around with the included software, ableton. Ableton is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) that basically acts as an environment for making music. A canvas, if you will. It doesn't matter which canvas you use really, its just a matter of preference. Some other DAWs are FL studio, Reaper, Studio One, Pro Tools, Logic. I would recommend ableton or FL for your situation. Whatever DAW you choose, read the manual. It seems trivial, but it will help. Also watch YouTube tutorials and mess around. You gotta remember that you can't mess anything up. Hope this helped a little."

Step 3: Learn how synthesis works - the New York School of Synthesis videos ion Youtube are cheesy as hell but awesome for helping you understand what the hell is going on in synthesisers.  Step 4: Learn, practice, learn, pratcice, learn, practice. Don't be afraid to watch tutorials online if you're struggling with something.

synthesizers,3adk88,kirklandish,3,Sat Jun 20 05:35:59 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking the machines will take care of the rhythm for you in techno, but if you want to bring your drumming skills along then you could consider some kind of pad controller, so you're hitting pads with your fingers to build loops or play melodies.  These start very cheap with gear like the Korg Nanopad, but you'll need software to use with them.  Do you have an iPad? If so you've got access to some very affordable and very powerful music apps, and there are a number of options for adding hardware control (like the Novation Launchpad series).  If you want to try out 'proper' hardware, the Korg Volca Sample is worth considering - it's cheap, and you'll be able to produce basic tracks without needing anything else. It's also fairly well appointed for techno.  If you've got a bigger budget, maybe an Electribe - again, all of these are pretty well equipped for techno production. At that price point, you'd also be able to get a decent DAW for computer-based production, where you can do pretty much anything.  Ableton Live is a standard techno-friendly, loop-friendly DAW that's easy to learn. You can expand it with add-ons, and there are plenty of great free VST instruments and effects to be had.  Renoise is a personal favourite - it's a lot cheaper than Live, but it uses a tracker interface - a scrolling list of letters and numbers - that takes a bit of getting used to. But again, it's very flexible and easily expanded.  Reason is an interesting alternative with a very powerful modelled real-world interface - you use components based on real instruments and you connect them using virtual cables.  They're all great and one is really all you need, but you need to consider which is going to suit you best. They all have trials you can check out, and they all work well with any number of hardware controllers.  If you buy a Launchpad, it'll come with a copy of Ableton Live Lite and some other content. This is a great and affordable way to get started if you're happy using a computer for your music, and definitely worth looking into.  And keep asking questions! If you're filthy rich, we can definitely get you sorted out..."

I have found Ableton and Push to be a great combo, it gives you the flexibility of a computer based setup while minimizing the amount of screen time. Plus the pads are decent for finger drumming (my background is playing drums also). The downside is that it is expensive if you get the full package with Suite.  If you want to mess around on the cheap look at the volcas or some of the electribes (old or new) by korg. If you want hardware only and have some cash check out the Elektron boxes. I have no pkaying experience with them, but they sound great IMO and seem to incredibly powerful (with a learning curve)."

synthesizers,3adk88,Batlikecreature,2,Fri Jun 19 16:47:00 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume by ""techno"" you mean electronic music in general, and possibly electronic dance music specifically, rather than the electronic subgenre techno. If however I'm mistaken, and you do want to make techno music specifically, my advice is still relevant but you'll need to consider it within the style of the subgenre. Start with the strengths you already have.  Because you ""play drums on a pretty technical level"" I would recommend you start by producing the drum track, or several drum loops that can be stitched together to form a percussion track at a later stage in your song's construction. Percussion is an important part of dance-orientated electronic music, and even a lot of non-dance oreientated electronic music, so it's a good place to start. You can use an accoustic drum kit, an electronic drum kit, or a hybrid of the two -- really, whatever is available to you. It doesn't matter what kind of rhythm and tempo you employ, because there's a subgenre of electronic music for virtually every style of percussion. And it's even possible to employ live drumming for some of the more complex and fast-paced electronic music genres. What's important is that you put together a percussion track that you like, or find interesting. I'm going to assume one of the ""few instruments"" you play is the keyboard or piano. If not, there are other options, but I'm not overly familiar with them. As a keyboard/piano player, you've got three options:    You can buy a hardware synthesizer, of which there are many different kinds, and perform the synthesizer parts live, recording each part as a separate track to be stitched together with your percussion track at a later stage in your song's production. This approach doesn't require a computer, although it would be greatly simplified by the use of one. You can buy a MIDI controller, which doesn't generate any sound of its own, to control software synthesizers. You can record live performances of these software synthesizers, but because MIDI is a lot like the digital equivelant of a player piano roll you can also make edits and changes to the performance one step at a time, or even compose entire instrument tracks entirely by hand. This option requires a computer and a DAW. Your percussion track or loops would be loaded in to the DAW, either by recording these parts directly in to your computer with an audio interface, or with a standalone recording device, such as the Zoom H4n, that can save recordings to a format that is easily transferable to a computer. You can employ a hybrid approach of the two previously mentioned approaches. Note there are dozens of different ways these approaches can be combined, depending on how much you want to rely on one method or the other, and for which parts of the process or even which instruments you want to be handled by a specific approach.    At this point, you should have several instrument tracks. If you're using a DAW you should already have each instrument track stitched together, and you have a good idea of how the final product will sound. Many DAWs incorporate mixing and mastering features as well, so you could probably complete your work in the DAW itself, although you could export or record the final output as separate .wav or .au files for each track, and then mix and master your song in an audio editor. If you aren't using a DAW, and you've got live performance tracks for each instrument, you'll want to go straight to your audio editor now to stitch each track together, and then mix and master the song to your liking. Bear in mind this is intended as a very basic outline, and there are (many) other options available. But however you approach making music I cannot emphasize enough the importance of reading manuals and understanding your tools/instruments, experimenting, and improving upon your knowledge of style and music theory. You'll hear a lot of people say you don't need some of these things, but the reality is exceptions are so incredibly few and far between, and there are so many musicians competing for attention now, that these things are necessary now. And spend some time learning about the different kind of electronic music. Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music is a good place to start, despite some of the opinions there not being very widely accepted."

They're intended for DJs but i have found much use for them as they're pretty colorless as far as i can tell. I use them together with my ""monitors"" when producing and they're really great. Only thing is if you have glasses you need to move the glasses a tiny bit after like 6-8hrs because they get squeezed between the ear and skull which tends to hurt after a while. To me that isn't as much of a dealbreaker as it sounds. they're also really good at isloating outside sound. If you use them on the bus you won't hear anything but the music but the person sitting next to you can sing-a-long with your tunes as they leak a lot.  I'm moving on to my third pair in almost 12 yrs, this time from a company named The T.Bone. First pair was DJSound(something or other) second pair was/is American audio and now T.Bone as stated earlier.  TL;DR American Audio HP-700. They're cheap as hell and sound really good."

synthesizers,3acml2,MultiplyTheBear,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:25:12 2015 UTC,You generally only need to use the L+R outputs if you want to take advantage of the in-built effects on the MiniNova. Most synths are mono (before effects) - and you'll see that on the back the L channel has L/MONO written on it. So you can safely use it this way (less the cool inbuilt effects).  I might also suggest using 2 x IMP2's - and input them into 2 separate channels in your console/mixer. I gather that the low impedance mic level balanced signal is the important part here? Or are you going directly into a PA?
synthesizers,3acml2,ranzee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:25:36 2015 UTC,"Currently, I have one mic cable going to the mixer board that we have (youth room at church) that I think that I may be able to get another if I have to go stereo.  So yeah, mic balanced signal is pretty much important. (I think)  Would this dual DI box be a good choice?    I also have been considering getting another synth(microbrute) to use in conjunction with the MiniNova, would I be able to place this mixer or similar between the synthesizers and the direct box? I also want to use the mini mixer board's RCA out ==> RCA to 3.5 cord ==> line in (on computer) so that I could record on garageband, also taking advantage of the mic input on the mixer board.

Might be worth doing some research on reviews. Some devices like these have been known to be noisy.   would I be able to place this mixer or similar between the synthesizers and the direct box?   Yes, it would work fine.  You could even look for a mixer that has XLR outputs built-in - then you wouldn't even need the direct box. These could be a little more pricey though.

synthesizers,3acml2,jaymz168,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:15:01 2015 UTC,"DIs are for guitar level audio    Sound guy here, no they're not.  They're for level matching any instrument that you're trying to send into a mic preamp and/or preventing induced noise in long runs (100' is not uncommon) by turning it into a balanced signal.  There are several other factors to take into consideration as well:     There's probably a snake and stage box involved which almost never has 1/4"" inputs.  This stage box may be the only way to get signal into the mixer because in some venues the back of the board is inaccessible.   Most boards these days are mostly mic pres and only have a couple AUX inputs on 1/4"" which are probably being used for effects returns from outboard gear.   Those AUX inputs are generally a pain in the ass to mix with.  On analog boards they're going to be on rotary pots instead of linear pots (faders), probably not have channel EQ, may not be assignable to AUX outputs (monitor mixes), etc.  They tend to be really limited.  And on digital boards the AUXs are usually on another page from all the channel inputs which can make it a pain to mix with if you don't know how to setup custom fader layers (or the board doesn't support it).   OP also says they're in a youth room at a church and most installers set up churches and the like in a way that makes it difficult to fuck it up.  Churches frequently have volunteers running sound and whatnot and they generally don't really know what they're doing so you have to make it idiot-proof.  Stuff like installing a snake and physically blocking the rear of the board from being messed with.  This prevents volunteers from messing with the system and forcing the church to have a professional to come out every week to undo whatever the last person did."

I want to sync its tempo to an external MIDI clock source. However when I flip the sync switch to Sync In (as per the instructions), the sequencer becomes disabled. I am syncing this with a dedicated MIDI clock, so only clock messages are being sent to the BL3.  My MIDI clock can also send out DIN sync data, I have tried using this method as well, but to no avail. My MIDI cables have all five pins connected. Am I missing something here, or is my unit faulty?? Any replies welcome!"

Put switch to MIDI In position.  This mode will also send a DIN sync clock out the Sync Out of the BL3   For external DIN sync, connect your DIN Sync source (this is not the same as MIDI, just the same sort of cable/connector) to the Sync IN on the BL3 and put switch to SYNC In position.    If it still doesn't work, make sure your midi clock source is actually sending midi clock.  You may need to activate this function as is the case with many hardware devices and software packages"

In fact when I tried using the MD as a MIDI master, and played a pattern on the MD, the pattern tried to play itself on the BL3 as well. All I want is to control the tempo on the BL3 from an external device. My (dedicated) MIDI clock, can also put out DIN sync data, but it makes no difference; the BL3 sequencer gets disabled...."
synthesizers,3abbow,JDilly,2,Thu Jun 18 20:40:21 2015 UTC,"It makes sense that it gets locally disabled.  As someone else said, the transport control is now on the master device.  Now if is responding to note messages from the MD, you may need to exit the midi note control mode which is described in the manual, just after the synchronization instructions.  It seems to me that it should only receive note messages when in this mode, and this mode should disable the internal sequencer.  Also check that the MD is set up to send clock data and not note data, should be in the global settings."

I have the master effect set to wet reverb, maybe a little over 50%. The first higher pitched sound you hear is a saw waveform. It has delay on it and a very slow and very subtle triangle LFO modulating pitch. I have a LPF on it, cutoff at around 80. The second part is set up the same way, except it's playing a different melody than the first part. Third part is also almost set up the same way, except it's a Rhodes sound (I think, I might have changed it, I'm at work and am doing this off of memory) and playing a different melodic part.   The 4th part is the drone that comes in. That's a clav, and it's looping a chord. I have distortion on it, applied to the max. I keep the volume down low and bring the sound in with the LPF. There's a sweet spot, where it's distorted/clear and not too bass-y. I really liked how warm it sounded. I have a random modulation on the OSC knob to give it that rhythmic effect.   The 5th/6th parts that play the brassy lead have one of the sine wavs on them. I can't remember what I used exactly, I'll check once I get home from work. I had a slow attack and long release on these. I was going for a ""mountain horn"" feeling haha. There's some delay on these, as well as a very very slow/moderate triangle pitch LFO. Another LPF on this as well (used the MS-20 on most of these btw), around 60.   The last part is just the M1 piano part. To be honest, I hate how it normally sounds. I think for this I had used BPF, quick release on, radio EQ for the IFX and a modulation effecting the filter.   That's the gist of it, I might be forgetting some things. There were some other parts I didn't end up using. I pretty much maxed out the voices and anything else would have caused voice stealing. I think there is one instance in my video where it happened. I tried really hard to avoid the ""clicks"" that the E2s are known for too. When you get this many parts/voices in, the clicks become more pronounced.   I'm going to do a video in the near future where I make something like this from scratch and while explaining it. I think that would be useful."

synthesizers,3a60wn,angryblue,2,Wed Jun 17 17:57:56 2015 UTC,"Running everything into Cubase, and doing some processing there.  The arp (modular) is running trough a fairly long reverb and a stereo delay. The drums are running trough a short reverb to give them a bit more sense of room. Lastely the chords (volca keys) are running trough a reverb, but most of the nice sound from the volca keys is just comming from the way I did the chords and the detuned oscillators.  Both the arp and the chords are getting sidechained by the volca beats to get the ducking. Though the chords are getting sidechained more heavily.  EDIT: Forgot to mention that I added some really slight distortion and compression to the drums. That compression is really needed due to the volume levels being all over the place on the beats (though the parts volume helps a bit)"

To start with, I've got the two oscs synced, with the primary osc set as a low saw wave. The secondary osc (or more specifically the sync osc) is set as a square wave two octaves above the primary. To top it all off, I have the LFO routed very slightly to pitch and a little bit to a filter, to give that fake-leslie vibrato effect that you get from combo organs.  I actually haven't dealt much with the R3, so I really hope this helps a little bit! I remember to figure out my patch, I looked up the tone generator specifics for Farfisa organs and they had a whole page dedicated to how to get that combo sound. Have fun!"

Especially when you're paying premium prices - if anything Moog should be held to an even higher standard.  You're also voiding your warranty once you open something up on your own. Most people don't have electrical skills to do those kinds of repairs, and even people that are okay with that kind of stuff would probably be hesitant to do it themselves because if they exacerbate the issue they're shit out of luck.

However, there is one thing that Moog does very well, and it's mainly things that come out of the low end of the frequency spectrum.

I'd like the other just because I prefer to have an instrument with it's own keyboard. It always seems to be a bit better than using MIDI for some reason. Sometimes I get a ""zippering"" sound when moving the pitch bend wheel (on the controller keyboard connected to the RME by MIDI) and I haven't found a solution for that yet (I haven't spent much time looking, but I asked in a forum once and they told me what it was.... no clues at all of how to fix it. Thanks guys.) I probably wouldn't get that in the keyboard version.  But since I don't own the keyboard version, I can't make a good comparison.

Call me superficial but I'm guessing that with the trinity one can get a groove going faster than with an individual box as it is generally that little bit more complex to coax all the sounds you need from one box (plus you'll only ever have one part in front of you at a time on one box). I'm secretly hoping that a 'threesome' of Elektron boxes would be more instantaneous fun than a single box as one would be able to get more sounds going before delving deeper into each machine and learning it inside out. I'm coming to this from my experience with modular synths. More modules = more interesting results and fuller arrangements before you even know very well what you're actually doing ;-)"
synthesizers,3a74zf,rodentdp,3,Wed Jun 17 23:23:48 2015 UTC,"I think you can get a groove going pretty quick with any of them, once you put in the time to learn them.

I just wonder if it'd be much more fun jamming on the trinity as opposed to just one machine (currently using an OT), for the simple reason that you'd have three parts controllable in parallel at any point in time, which should make it super quick to get a groove going, easier to monitor the steps when programming sequences as you have all three laid out in front of you, and change up the sound of any of the three parts instantaneously, while each box would do what it does best. In short, my rather optimistic expectation is that it'd be easier and faster to build a groove on 3 than it is on 1. But I have heard folks say that given that each box is complex on its own, three is overload to anyone except the most accustomed to the Elektron workflow."

I thought you were saying that one was too much but that maybe someone spreading out the complexity over three machines might make it easier.  Yeah, the two together is the most fun I've ever had with gear in my entire life.  YMMV, of course."
synthesizers,3a74zf,NuMux,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:30:49 2015 UTC,"Well in a way that's what I'm saying. Not that I'm dumbfounded by each Elektron box individually, but yeah, they do lack somewhat in the immediacy department and I'm guessing that with the trinity it'd be more hands on and immediate, just by virtue of having more parts in front of you at any one time to tweak and trigger without even diving into a menu. You could also phrase that as spreading out the complexity."
synthesizers,3a74zf,Jaalmakadamia,3,Thu Jun 18 05:52:08 2015 UTC,"i have the octatrack, analog four, and machinedrum. i have thought about going full dark trinity, but i keep learning the machinedrum more and more.  the analog four is really a piece of cake. it's only complexity lies within the fact that it is an extremely flexible synthesizer. it's not a workflow issue really. it's more of a ""shit, this thing can do a lot and i've only scratched the surface"" sort of thing.  the octatrack really isn't so bad after you learn a few key basics. watch the tarekith videos to get you up to speed.  i really love them. they sort of ground my whole setup and give me near infinite sound complexity. the machinedrum is the easiest workflow-wise, but it has a pretty deep synth engine that takes some learning."
synthesizers,3a74zf,xmnstr,2,Thu Jun 18 01:56:12 2015 UTC,Good on you for taking the time to get better with the machinedrum. I got an MDUW a while back but didn't show it much love. I think it was mainly the cumbersome handling of samples that irked me. Not so with the OT of course :)
synthesizers,3a74zf,xmnstr,2,Thu Jun 18 07:32:39 2015 UTC,"yea, it has been my least used of the elektron machines so far despite being the easiest to get into, but i am learning that there is a lot there in the synthesis capability. i was fairly happy with a few of the machinedrum sounds on this recent demo track. nothing special really, as there's only two patterns from the machinedrum. as a note, the analog four is doing everything else besides the lead.  also, on the sampling i usually just have the machinedrum sample itslef on the fly. i haven't loaded any external samples to it."
synthesizers,3a74zf,3lbFlax,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:39:54 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that pairing the MDUW with an octatrack would make the UW part rather redundant, as the OT is miles ahead in sampling other sources, itself, and importing and sequencing/looping samples. Which is kind of a shame seeing as I once paid a premium price for the UW. It's nice to have I guess, but wonder if I'll ever find a reason to use it much going forward."
synthesizers,3a74zf,3lbFlax,2,Thu Jun 18 08:34:04 2015 UTC,I have really given up on sampling directly to my MDUW. I still find some samples that are good to load up and use in the MD but direct sampling has never worked out well for me. I also have an OT and it does what I need it to do so I go straight to it for my sampling needs. Way more flexibility in the OT as well.  That being said. The MD is one of my favorite pieces of gear. It is a great sound source for my style of music and I have found many ways of getting melodies out of it when the sound design options favor percussion hits.
synthesizers,3a74zf,3lbFlax,2,Sat Jun 20 14:49:01 2015 UTC,"I'm rocking my own Trinity, OT, MD and Virus.  Sequencing somehow transfers accross Elektron devices, but they all have very different sound engines.  The strength of such gear is that when you combine them, you can use your trinity as one big giant groovebox. All sequencers work together, each box has it's own job, there's no redundancy... It's surreal. Of course, it will take time to learn how to use each box, and because it's a musical instrument, it will take years to master the whole trinity."
synthesizers,3a74zf,3lbFlax,2,Thu Jun 18 05:57:53 2015 UTC,"I did for a short while, just when I had bought the A4 and was about to sell my OT. Honestly, I just couldn't get along with the OT. It is very different to the Analog series, more like the Machinedrume and Monomachine in my opinion. And I'm not a fan of those either.  I really like my Analog series machines though, especially the AR."
synthesizers,3a74zf,junkestar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:43:43 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the analog series boxes are simpler to operate? Could that be the main reason you found them more to your liking? (sound quality notwithstanding)  I haven't used either, but have the impression they're simpler to operate, with a more streamlined OS and perhaps a less complex internal architecture. I've been wondering whether that's a new direction for Elektron, to simplify the workflow, or whether it was just a side-effect of the analog boxes being simpler to operate by nature, seeing as they're based on more straightforward analog synthesis techniques."
synthesizers,3a74zf,bugeats,2,Thu Jun 18 08:27:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call the architecture of the A4 simpler, just complex in a different way. The AR is absolutely simpler, but still very powerful.  I think Elektron realized they had to come up with a better UI after the OT and that's probably the main reason for the Analog series ease of use. I believe they opted for a different approach to the architecture too as part of this, and it seems to have paid off. Their sales have increased 10 times over a couple of years, IIRC.  I'm sure many people can learn to love the OT, but I wouldn't recommend it as a first Elektron machine."

Go find some pictures of broken ones and check out some guides like this http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/fixing-motherboard,1606-2.html  If you find broken caps, then you'll need to read the print on the side of them to figure out the specs, and order replacements.

Do the first if  you can find it.  Don't mess with OS/firmware is it a note or just a loud hum? can you plug in a MIDI controller and play notes thru that? do you have a way to tell if it's sending midi out (Ableton, midi-OX, another midi device?) I'm assuming there wasnt any electric blackout, or low voltage or blown circuit breakers.  Was your house checked by electrician for properly balanced circuits?"

It sounds like a hum but it's definitely the sounds from the synth. Changing the patch results in a different hum sound. -Unfortunately, I cannot test midi (I haven't worked on my setup enough yet). But they keys on the keyboard work just fine and hitting notes will change the hum, leading me to think it's some internal issue. -I do not know if my house has been checked for properly balanced circuits, this is the first time Ive had any issue like this.

synthesizers,3a5vwc,ihamq,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:56:52 2015 UTC,Not sure of either hardware - so sorry if this might be incorrect - but it does seem to me that you might have the MC-303 listening on the wrong channel? Can you not set the default MIDI-IN channel to correspond with your EM-1?  I have a device called a MidiBro (same as a MidiPal) - and you can filter MIDI channels or merge MIDI channels - this would also solve your problem if I understand you correctly.
synthesizers,3a5vwc,ranzee,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:32:10 2015 UTC,From what I've read I believe each part number corresponds to its MIDI channel. Now that might mean that each part corresponds to the MIDI it sends and not what it receives / listens to. But what I've noticed is one part on the EM-1 that is set to MIDI channel 7 will make MC303 play as well as one part on the EM-1 that is set to MIDI channel 10 (and I imagine any other channel) so even if I can change the default MIDI-IN channel it doesn't seem like it woudl change what's happening?
synthesizers,3a5vwc,Daviplan3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:51:44 2015 UTC,"From what I've read I believe each part number corresponds to its MIDI channel   If I recall correctly, that was never the case in ""normal"" mode. My MC-303 is in storage for a while now, but any incoming MIDI message was routed to the part that was selected on the front panel (which is probably why your EM-1 ch.10 messages are redirected to the R part of the MC-303, provided you've got the R part selected).  Alternatively, to access full multimbral capabilities of the MC-303 (at the cost or Realtime front panel controllers), you had to select the sound module mode. But then again, as stated in this SOS snippet:   It's a 'traditional' 16-part multitimbral sound source for use with a sequencer. To access this mode, hold down the Play mode button while powering up the MC303. None of the front-panel controls, other than the volume knob, work in this mode, all control information coming via MIDI. Apart from drums being assigned to MIDI channel 10, this isn't a hidden General MIDI mode (...).   And this is the other possible explanation to why your EM-1 ch.10 triggers the drum part of the MC."

I find your stance to be the more frequent point of view than my own, and usually enjoy a conversation about the different opinions we hold:  In some ways it's more difficult to manipulate and control noise, within the confines of your oeuvre, and to express yourself in recognizable terms, than it is when playing ""regular"" styles. It takes quite a deal of discipline and practice to do it well, just as it does in any other genre, and that practice often necessitates learning your instruments inside out. I've worked with some noise musicians who would put most of us to shame, when it comes to playing style, when they play standards. I wouldn't say that they need to be, or are, any more skilled than other musicians, but they do need to be skilled.  Yes, I agree that there are some out there who take advantage of the term ""experimental"", or ""noise"", or whatever, and use it to justify a lack of ability, but I've found them to be the kind of folks who don't get very far with their endeavors. I'm sure there are exceptions but, as someone who dealt with a number of established and revered experimental/avant-garde musicians, I've not met many... Though I may have witnessed a couple in passing.   But music is free, as in free to be performed and interpreted by anyone who wants to do so. Just like any art. There are no music police who'll come knocking at your door if you don't follow the rules, and what rules exist are specific to, well, the individual and the rules that they chose to adhere to, or are expected to adhere to by their peers and audiences. And it's often those who eschew those constraints that make, and change, musical, and art, history.  And, of course, there is cultural context, that music and art from different cultures tend to adhere to a different set of freedoms and constraints than those you or I may find acceptable, and we may find it unpleasant, unpalatable or even unlistenable, but still the performers are skilled.  edit: spelling n shit"
synthesizers,3a36pj,kirklandish,3,Wed Jun 17 05:56:39 2015 UTC,"Perhaps iis a question of whether all art that utilizes sound is music or if there is a difference between music and sound art.

Maybe that is just my annoyance with the hipster noise scene that I am familiar with."
synthesizers,3a36pj,asilvermtzion,2,Wed Jun 17 07:59:52 2015 UTC,"I tend to assume that sound artists collect and present audio in a specific context, rather than perform pieces for general consumption. Or they'll specifically refer to their work as sound art in order to define their work as distinct from music. There's a lot of leeway though and I think the audience and critics are often more concerned about the definitions than the artists XD  I'm also not a fan of simple/basic noise, with a couple of exceptions, but it's more because of personal taste rather than anything to do with the working methods of the performer. I just tend to get bored with it rather quickly.  I've known a number of musicians who's work sounds very complex and nuanced but is essentially them just pressing the ""Go"" button on whatever generative system they've developed... Not particularly avant-garde styles or anything even, just what I guess is considered more jazzy or freeform. Don't want to name names and let somebody's cat out of the bag."

synthesizers,3a3flg,vonroald,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:50:49 2015 UTC,I took an electroacoustic music class when I was in uni and that class was what more or less got me more interested in synthesis and electronic music. They had a 2600 as well and I just really didn't appreciate it at the time. I wish I could get my hands on it again now that I know how it works.
synthesizers,3a3flg,rodentdp,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:23:37 2015 UTC,"You are probably right, although if one of the 106s has failing voice chips, he could maybe argue that it was in need of repair and he would buy it instead. I dunno. I would at least make the effort, and would probably bug them once a semester until they gave in or I graduated. Universities do sell these things from time to time. I met Paul Schreiber by chance a few times, and he once told me a story about buying a Buchla 200 from a university in Australia for $1,000 or something like that, as they didn't know what they had. Apparently it later ended up being sold to a collector (not by Paul) in Japan for nearly $100k, IIRC."

This synthesizer has new technology that’s never been implemented before, so it’s totally alien to anything I’ve ever used. I’ve had to spend a few weeks just understanding the architecture of it."

It's interesting to think that Yamaha could be developing a new form of synthesis or something.

synthesizers,3a2imj,toadrush,2,Thu Jun 18 01:13:32 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm hoping for too. Analog is great and all, but new types of synthesis are really exciting, and that's only going to happen in the digital realm."
synthesizers,3a20bq,slujj-vohaul,7,Tue Jun 16 16:41:57 2015 UTC,"Not my video, but I thought this was a cool demo. Lots of fun to be had with this box once you focus on what it can do instead of what it can't.  From the video description:  So one of the cool things about the ESX2 is that you can assign an external audio signal to multiple tracks. I have a guitar both on track one and track three, each with different filter, modulation and effect settings. One panned left and one panned right. Nice."
synthesizers,3a20bq,Synthhead44,5,Tue Jun 16 16:43:44 2015 UTC,"Hey, thats a nice feature, i really think Korg could have done a much better job of making this unit more appealing, based on features like this.   As an ESX1 user, i just couldn't see where they were going with shortening the pattern length, and with not increasing the sampling time. though the ableton transfer, and improved/master FX are definitely a good selling point for the unit, a good korg demo of something like this at the beginning would have swayed a lot of nay sayers more in favor of it, IMO.  So, essentially you could take a single input and use it on 16 channels, with different processing? That creates huge potential for resampling!"
synthesizers,3a20bq,atxweirdo,2,Tue Jun 16 19:08:51 2015 UTC,That's a pretty nifty feature for the electribe. Can you still chain effects?

The sequencer is worthless, use it for midi or real time triggering.  The one tip I remember is that by holding down a sample pad while adjusting the start and end points  you can get a super lo fi time stretch kind of effect as it endlessly tries to retrigger from the new start point of the sample.  I think if you hold down shift it will do the same thing faster."

synthesizers,3a37nf,mottobazza,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:33:25 2015 UTC,Simple is good. I think what puts me off delving into the MPCs sampling is that it seems quite deep and for someone who's never used a sampler properly it's a bit intimidating.

synthesizers,3a37nf,rodentdp,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:54:49 2015 UTC,"One thing they do very well is allow you to lower the bit rate on the samples to get a very crunchy sound, as low as 4bit if I remember correctly.."
synthesizers,3a3avv,throwdownn,7,Tue Jun 16 22:03:57 2015 UTC,"The VCA is extremely noisy, and no it's not because it's analog. That's ridiculous and untrue. There's nothing about analog circuitry that automatically leads to excessive white noise.   That being said, it is part of the sound of the MS-20 and it has been well documented. It's mentioned just about every time the synth is brought up here and on similar forums."
synthesizers,3a3avv,GiveUsOurSynths,3,Tue Jun 16 22:26:23 2015 UTC,One thing I have never gotten clarity on:  How does the noise on the Mini compare to the original MS-20?
synthesizers,3a3avv,FullFrontalNoodly,7,Tue Jun 16 22:35:29 2015 UTC,That was the amusing thing is that comparisons i've seen between the two say the mini is a lot quieter

synthesizers,3a3avv,t0xicd0g,4,Wed Jun 17 11:58:15 2015 UTC,"I believe it's the mk1 filter. I've noticed it on every MS20 mini I've ever used, and most originals too, but not all. At first I wondered if it might be age causing some degradation but the fact I could hear it on brand new Minis didn't make sense. Then I had the chance to play on an MS20m and guess what? Mk1 filter - noise. Flip the switch to Mk2 filter - no noise. Really noticeable, too.   Many people will tell you that in a mix, you really won't notice it, and especially if you're filtering, the filter will take a lot of the hiss out. It's true, but if you're really unhappy with that I'd maybe send it back and save up for an MS20m."

I watched numerous videos and listening to sound samples. I've concluded that yes, the ms-20 is noisey. However, the noise I'm experiencing is not normal.  I can point to numerous ms-20 mini youtube vids that sound much cleaner than my new ms-20. There's definitely a defect, even though I know some of you may disagree. The simplest test? I recreated the tone on this video:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAS1ciMyfWE   My synth sounds WAY worse. Noisey. Sadly I'll be returning this ASAP.

So if you want to move to a new key you can make it feel more established by first moving to the chord whose root is a perfect 5th above. The chords on this instrument are arranged so that each key's V chord is adjacent to the right. Another thing to note about this arrangement is that the key signature of each key's neighbor differs only by one accidental: C is in the middle and has 0 sharps or flats, G is to its right and has 1 sharp, D is to its right and has 2 sharps, etc. Going the other way, F is to C's left and has 1 flat, Bb is to its left and has 2 flats, etc."
synthesizers,3a2381,ObscureMachines,4,Tue Jun 16 17:02:06 2015 UTC,You seem to do a lot of the effects on the TR-8 (a lot of the internal effects). Is the stereo out plus two assignable outs working well for you? Is that limitation not really an issue?
synthesizers,3a2381,the_cody,4,Tue Jun 16 17:24:51 2015 UTC,"At first, I thought it was going to be an issue, mainly for mixing. Working around the limitation can be fun though and it made me think about what goes together better etc. So typically I'll have kick through 1, snare out 2, toms outs 3, and percussion out 4.   Personally, I use to spend hours honing in and mixing one simple sound like a hi hat. Now I would rather just record the whole thing through 2 channels and call it a day. The simpler the better. A lot of my earlier stuff was just recorded straight out of the 2 outs. Besides, the TR-8 sounds are really, really good.   Also, if you really want the individual outs the USB interface on the TR-8 has worked great for me. The only issue I've run into was going into the computer via USB, into Live, out of Live into the hardware and mixer, back into the computer via my interface. That has cause some latency problems. However, straight from USB to the computer I haven't had any latency issues."
synthesizers,3a2381,the_cody,3,Tue Jun 16 17:32:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've kinda segregated my hardware and software. I've thought about a TR-8 and MX-1, since that would do it, but that's like $1300 for the combo.   So typically I'll have kick through 1, snare out 2, toms outs 3, and percussion out 4.   That sounds like a totally workable solution, though."
synthesizers,3a2381,Biopharmer,5,Tue Jun 16 18:10:33 2015 UTC,"Can't recommend the TR-8 enough...it's my fav honestly. I've been trying to convince Roland to do a sampler with TR-8 workflow. It would be like MD and OT, Electribe and Electribe sampler, peanut butter and jelly...lol  So cool story. I picked up some gear on eBay from Australia. Turned out it was Touch Sensitive. I asked him about the TR-8 since he had one on one of his videos. He said he got a TR-8 and sold his 808. Said it sounds just as good in a mix, and no one can tell.

If you want stereo effects to come through, you're going to need tow KC-550s. I still haven't put the volume all the way up yet. Setting it to 2 is enough to fill my basement with painful audio.  The built-in mixer is extremely convenient. I've done shows where the mic's in one channel, we're running a bass guitar into another, then a drum machine and a monosynth into two more channels.   If you're in a venue with a decent PA and subs, that's probably going to be better, but how many of those do we really play, right?   I got mine used for something like $300. It was so cheap I thought I was picking up a KC-350, but was pleasantly surprised when the guy rolled out this huge speaker. ""They use these for the drum kits at Guitar Center,"" he told me, ""But it's more than I'll ever need."" Me too, but I'm a fan of over-engineering.  So, yeah. My only complaint is that I find the mid-range to be muddy, at least at lower volumes. Love the onboard mixer, the casters, and it just seems really solid overall."

On a side note there's a really cool midi controller, Le Strum, that works very similar to these, with some great variations on how it plays.

Looking to get one now on the bay...with midi out of course.   Here's a fun little article I found on it: http://kickkicksnare.com/2014/02/03/popular-instrument-youve-never-heard-omnichord/
synthesizers,39yn57,Lt_Salt,9,Mon Jun 15 21:21:10 2015 UTC,"I was lucky enough to see Alessandro Cortini play at NMASS this weekend here in Austin.   A lot of what he played was from his records which was cool (I was expecting new/improvised stuff), and he had fantastic visuals to go along with his set. Even after looking at his setup up close I'm confused how it worked. I think he may have had some kind of audio in running into all the pedals, but I'm not sure.  After watching the studio tour vids he did, I was really curious how he condensed that much gear to go on the road. Now we know.   I recognize some of the gear here, but someone wiser than me will need to do though full breakdown."
synthesizers,39yn57,kisielk,4,Mon Jun 15 21:26:59 2015 UTC,"I mentioned in another thread I talked to him after his show in Vancouver. This is just his setup for this tour... basically he recorded the raw oscillator sounds from his MC-202's which he used on the record, not even a filter applied, and synced them to the video for the performance. The audio and video play off of and iPhone or iPad and the audio goes through this chain of pedals which he manipulates live for the performance.  He said the main reason he did it this way was because he was travelling a lot for this tour, and it's a lot easier to throw a pedal board in to your carry-on luggage than carry around a bunch of MC 202's along with all the necessary effects."
synthesizers,39yn57,kisielk,3,Mon Jun 15 21:49:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't get to see the pedalboard before, but it looks like:  Strymon Dig, Deco, Blue sky. Koma FT201 Behringer mixer..  and the rest should be obvious from the labels :)"
synthesizers,39yn57,kisielk,3,Mon Jun 15 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense. Electronic artists can get a bad rep for ""just pressing play,"" but it was very much a performance.  I can't say I blame him for not wanting to lug around his really expensive gear."
synthesizers,39yn57,nikofeyn,4,Mon Jun 15 22:13:10 2015 UTC,I think it makes little difference whether he's playing the actual synths from an internal sequencer or the recordings if all the expression is done via filter modulation and effects.
synthesizers,39yn57,nikofeyn,2,Mon Jun 15 23:25:11 2015 UTC,"haha. yea, i saw him packing it up after the show. then i saw on his twitter back in january or something asking people for pedal boards that are safe for carry-on. said he had had to check his pedaltrain too often."
synthesizers,39yn57,slamgauge,2,Tue Jun 16 06:11:12 2015 UTC,"thanks for posting this. i was wondering what in the hell was generating the sound and doing the sequencing. i figured he was using an octatrack or something below the top effects pedals that i could see, but according to this and /u/kisielk, he must have just been using a playback device.  btw, do you know if he has recorded the track he played with this riff?"
synthesizers,39yn57,sanantonia,3,Tue Jun 16 04:15:24 2015 UTC,"I was there and wondering the same thing, so where is the sound coming from? I am a fan of allisandro but I came away feeling pretty ambivalent about that performance. I dozed off during his set. I guess that is what he was going for though."
synthesizers,39yn57,nikofeyn,3,Mon Jun 15 21:43:33 2015 UTC,"I had the opposite reaction, Sonno was one of my favorite releases of last year and I thought the performance was hypnotizing and beautiful. Also, he has amazing taste in footwear."
synthesizers,39yn57,slamgauge,3,Tue Jun 16 00:07:32 2015 UTC,i thought his performance was by far the best there. it was so melodic and takes you places. it was enchanting.  and the track with this riff was insane. do you know if he's recorded it? i don't recall it and have been briefly going through his recorded stuff. but when he played it i instantly recognized it from his instagram.
synthesizers,39yn57,nikofeyn,2,Tue Jun 16 04:17:12 2015 UTC,"I am glad you enjoyed it, Alessandro is a super nice guy and I consider myself a fan. I could tell pretty quickly that I was not part of the target audience for this particular performance as I am not big on drone music. I did really dig surchai's performance, I have been wanting to see him and Alessandro play for a while. I wasn't disappointed, I just would have rather seen a performance of sonoio."
synthesizers,39yn57,MotelVoid,3,Tue Jun 16 00:41:00 2015 UTC,"I just would have rather seen a performance of sonoio.   just as a note, he hasn't released a sonoio album in four years. he's had four releases since then as alessandro cortini (forse 1, 2, and 3, sonno, and then one ep as skarn, his techno project."

synthesizers,39yypb,Synthhead44,2,Mon Jun 15 22:46:20 2015 UTC,"The 1st pic is from this morning, before i added the 1/8"" jacks. The 2nd pic is from the final test, along with my atari punk console, which i also made this week.  So, i have had this pedal lying around for years now collecting dust, i recently plugged it in and had a mess about with running the ms20mini through it, and the result was kind of similar to the MS20 'Duophonic' patching when it is controlled by the momentary switch.  I looked online to find out if anyone had done the switch mod before and my search came up empty, apart from some people asking if it was possible, so that they could make a drone pedal that you didnt have to keep your foot on.  I decided to have a tinker with it anyway and found out that if you just add an on/off switch to the lugs of the momentary switch, you can still use the original switch as well as having a switch to hold the note indefinitely. I decided to add a different momentary switch anyway.  I also added 3.5mm jacks in there to make the I/O more suitable with my MS20mini, V.Keys and Monotribe.  This is a temporary enclosure i'm working with until my proper one is ready, it's actually an iPhone 5c box.  Has anyone else on the sub modded your pedals for similar reasons? Or tried and failed?  Next up for me is my Boss ODB3. Sorry about the low quality photos, I might make a quick video of it in action later in the week if you want, i'm waiting to get my ipad back from my dad first."
synthesizers,39yypb,FeelinDank,2,Mon Jun 15 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"No modding yet, but I found a Boss ODB3 for $20 at pawn shop and I bought/replaced a new pot for it since it needed it. I intend to replace C10 first since I couldn't immediately locate the other recommend resistor / capacitors. Also need to switch out the red LED on my ODB3 and my PH-2."
synthesizers,39yypb,FeelinDank,3,Tue Jun 16 02:15:13 2015 UTC,"Nice, you cant go wrong for $20!   Like my SYB5, my ODB3 has sat collecting dust for a couple of years, so i tried it out with my MS20 and was surprised with how good it sounded, compared to a bass guitar going through it that is. It still has those 'icepick' highs though, so that's why i'm going to have a go at the mods.  I found all of the locations for the wampler mods on the ODB3, i just need to get the right resistors and caps for the job.  C10 is the first one i found too, even though it is right in the middle of the board, R31 is just to the left of C10, it's kind hard to see the markings for it, it's right beside the R32 resistor. C8 is down to the right of the LEDs on the bottom right of the board, and those two LEDs are supposed to be changed up for some 1n4148s."

synthesizers,39zlxx,synthatron,3,Tue Jun 16 14:44:39 2015 UTC,If you have a mac you can download an apple program called quartz composer.

That overlaps with the lower end of the shortwave band (~1600 kHz), but I'm interested in the longer wave stuff. In North America, it's possible to pick up quite distant medium-wave AM broadcasts at night, particularly from ""clear channel"" stations that broadcast at high power.

If all the displays are dead then it has to be something they all have in common, so either the power is bad, or one VFD driver chip has died and shorted the power out, or the synth isn't sending anything to the display.  If the power is good, and the synth is sending something to the display, start replacing the 74 series logic on the FLD board (cos it's cheap!), then start replacing the uPA80C VFD driver chips (a bit more expensive).   There is nothing on that board that can't be bought today other than the actual VFD display tubes themselves.   BTW, get the service manual as it's excellent, and has all the correct voltages written in it.

synthesizers,3a059j,peg_leg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"Problem #1: Impedence mismatch.  You would not get enough volume going from headphones to XLR on a mixing board.  Problem #2: Balanced XLR input will nullify the incoming signal.  By the nature of signal balancing as a method of line-induced noise reduction there are three pins. A positive, a negative, and a ground.  The positive signal gets summed against a polarity flipped negative signal.  Since your headphone jack will output two positive signals and not positive/negative the second positive signal will get flipped to negative and summed against the first positive, nullifying the input == NO SOUND.  YOU CAN take the headphone out into a line input, if you wish.  Any phasing between left and right would affect the amplitude of the mixer channel input.  NOT recommended.  If the mixer has line inputs, go from the line output of the synth to the line input of the mixer.  If there is an audio snake in between you can use one of the 1/4"" returns in a pinch (if 1/4"" returns are available).    But really, get a direct box.  They're only $20 for the cheap ones."

synthesizers,39xt5x,natrixgli,3,Mon Jun 15 19:32:54 2015 UTC,"Soundwise I think the MS2000 is a good bet in that price range. The sequencer will be handy, as will the distortion and multimode filter. Though I'd probably want FM or wavetables for Faint-ish stuff. DWGS is close enough."

You also get 24 voices of polyphony and 4 part multitimbral. You can get the gritty feel of the MS2000 or the more digital modern sound of the RADIAS engine. Plus arpeggiator, step sequencer, vocoder, etc. People complain the RADIAS is ""thin"" but I've found with some fiddling with the EQ settings and drive you can get some great thick sounds."
synthesizers,39xt5x,natrixgli,5,Mon Jun 15 21:18:34 2015 UTC,The R3 is really good too if you want something self-contained and cheap.
synthesizers,39xt5x,natrixgli,3,Mon Jun 15 22:00:31 2015 UTC,Would you pick the R3 over the Ultranova? Used they are about the same price.
synthesizers,39xt5x,ouij,6,Mon Jun 15 23:47:52 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, no. The Ultranova has more polyphony, more waveforms (both oscillators and LFO), more oscillators, more FX slots (though the R3 has more effect types), and aftertouch. It's also easier to program.   However for the kind of music you're into I would go with the R3 for a couple reasons. First, it is bi-timbral so you can split the keyboard (or layer parts, or control one part with an external keyboard, or just quickly toggle between two sounds) Second it's got a more raw sound which I think will fit the type of music better. The wave shaping is pretty brutal. Third, it's a hair cheaper and should leave you with enough cash to get a small phrase sampler which I think will be really helpful for your intended use. (i.e SP303, etc.)  Plus the R3 has a sequencer. When you layer two parts with sequences you can get some really wicked stuff going. And there's a PC editor as well.   But I'd go with a Blofeld keyboard if I could spring the extra couple of hundred bucks for one. Then you also get an extra octave of keys, aftertouch, and sampling. LCD Soundsystem uses a lot of combo organ in addition to synths, which would be easier to do with the Blofeld (though I've done good combo organ patches on the R3 by layering two parts)  Overall I think you probably will like either the R3 or Blofeld, but I think the Ultranova (though really underrated and cool) will be a bit too sweet and tame for your liking."
synthesizers,39xt5x,ZappBrannigan085,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:58:43 2015 UTC,"Man, thanks for such a thoughtful reply. You've got me sold on the R3. It may not be as fancy, but it sounds like just what I need to get where I'm going."
synthesizers,39xt5x,ouij,5,Tue Jun 16 15:32:00 2015 UTC,"you've described a Novation Ultranova. I actually kind of like the sound, and I've toyed with the idea of picking up a used one.   Note that the synthesis engine can be quite deep. If you intend to program your own patches, you're going to want to get the manual and spend some time with it before sitting down at the synth. When I demo'd it a few weeks ago, I was impressed at what it had to offer, but I ended up just preset-browsing. It would take another session with the manual in hand to really get a sense of what was possible in the engine."
synthesizers,39xt5x,h3xxya,3,Mon Jun 15 18:06:43 2015 UTC,Actually with the Ultranova use can use a plugin to program it. It's quite easy to use and let's you get to all the deep stuff easily.  The patch librarian makes it easy to backup all your sounds too. You can do your sound design before hand and use the touch encoders to trigger all kinds of fun little modulations live.
synthesizers,39xt5x,ouij,2,Mon Jun 15 18:40:53 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt it. But there's a lot going on in that engine, and it would take me a very long time to build up a patch from nothing that I liked. This is a testament to the depth of the engine.   But knowing how to program it will still take a bit of study. OP is looking for presets first, so I'm assuming he isn't quite comfortable programming."

I have a Mininova which, if I'm not mistaken, uses the same sound engine as the Ultra.  I've been playing with my mini for about 8 months now on and off and I think it's much better suited for techno/dubstep and pads/strings.  You'll end up wanting something much more aggressive sounding.  Unfortunately I don't know what else to suggest as I'm not that experienced and haven't had my hands on that much gear.  Edit*  Thanks for the suggestions guys, I had thought about trying this before then I completely forgot about it.  Are there any cheap multi-effects pedals anyone suggests?"

synthesizers,39xt5x,fracdoctal,4,Tue Jun 16 20:26:38 2015 UTC,"Just to note, Nancy from LCD Soundsystem uses a lot of older vintage units when they played live, specifically the Moog Prodigy and Roland SH 101. Also looks like she enjoys using the KORG MicroKORG.  A lot of the features you listed there won't be available on an older synth but for dance punk you're going to want something with a very cutting and basic analog type sound, something with presence not something with an endless selection of patches and fancy features. The MicroKORG might actually be the perfect thing if you're looking for a bunch of those features in a cheap package. They're kind of annoying to program but easy enough to get used to"
synthesizers,39xt5x,selfinflikted,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This has got me leaning towards the R3 - it seems to have a similar mojo to the MiniKorg, but with full size keys (I hate mini keys - especially live)."

synthesizers,39xt5x,slujj-vohaul,3,Mon Jun 15 22:57:09 2015 UTC,"The Ultranova engine is very deep, but the presets aren't very good - they tend to throw everything into the mix to show off the capabilities of the synth, and it's a bit overwhelming. But! There are some better preset banks available for free on the Novation site, so if you do get a Nova, check those out.  It's a great synth - whether it's the one you're after, I can't say. But it ticks all your boxes - the arp is especially well-specced, and plays very nicely with the LFOs and effects. Sadly there aren't many videos that really dig into it, but the power and depth that the specs suggest - three oscs, virtual unison, two filters, six envelopes, three LFOs, five effects - are very real.  It's not very knobby, but the wheel, large assignable knob, aftertouch and touch encoders mean it can be very expressive played live. The presets do a good job of demonstrating what can be done with the touch encoders, even if they are OTT.  So yeah, worth considering for sure."

As you predicted at the end of your post though, I found myself needing more CV control and ended up with the Expressionist as a result.  If it were me, the RYTM would be the master clock synching with everybody else. Not sure what the MIDI Thru options are on the rest of your gear, but if you're good to go on that front you can chain everybody together, otherwise getting a MIDI patch panel or something like the MIDI Solutions Quadra Thru would be fine.  Another thing to keep in mind is Tubbutec is apparently hard at work on an SH-101 CPU replacement. I just got my Juno-6 retrofitted over the weekend and can vouch for the quality of his stuff.

synthesizers,39xrfa,bingaman,2,Tue Jun 16 20:33:39 2015 UTC,"there's quite a lot of differences really, for starters the sq1 has a sequencer for 2 gate/cv synths. it doesn't have the same modulation options as the kentons. you should read the manuals at the tab on the kenton links you gave and compare to the material below.  http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/sq_1/specifications.php  http://i.korg.com/SupportPage.aspx?productid=726"

synthesizers,39xrfa,owen__wilsons__nose,2,Tue Jun 16 16:50:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry if you know this already but one of my fav ways to use the 101 and something you can do right now is to load the sequencer with notes and then trigger through them. You could send a pulse/rim shot out of your Rytm or Daw to the 101 and it steps through what's loaded in the sequencer. You can also enter glides per note that way which sounds great. Loads of classics were done this way (guy called gerald).  As far as midi to CV Kenton's are solid. Some have more options, more aux out for other parameters so depends how important that all is. They should all work equally well. I have a pro solo mk2 and its very reliable. Although these days I would go for the USB option. If you ever add a Elektron A4 to your set up you'd have CV outs on there as well. Hope that helps."

I tried a jack in both the Ext Clk In and the cv - gate but could only manage to get the 101 to make a drone noise or the same one note and doesn't seem to be triggered properly by the RYTM?  Ive been looking at the A4 its a little pricy but its tempting.

synthesizers,39y9fs,3lbFlax,3,Tue Jun 16 16:44:00 2015 UTC,If you just want to sync the 101 sequencer with your MIDI gear then you'll need something that converts MIDI clock to trigger pulses (ex. sbx-10). Using the trigger out of something like a tr-626 or tr-707 and plugging it into the ex clk in input on the 101 is a neat way to do that because it lets you modify the timing of the sequence while staying in sync.   But if you want to actually sequence the 101 with a MIDI sequencer you'll need a MIDI to CV converter. Kenton's Pro Solo would be a good choice since one of the outputs can be configured to output a clock for slaving the 101 sequencer to a MIDI clock as well.

You can control the tempo either via USB connection to a DAW or internally (by adjusting the tempo knob). There's also the newer big brother the BeatStep Pro which offers even more possibilities.  Since you have a Roland SH-101, you could look at getting the SBX-1 Sync Box - which is actually built specifically for using it with the SH-101 (and TR-808 etc).  or the Korg SQ-1 as grauniad_angel suggested :)"

The Volca Beats has some old style analog sound and some old style PCM samples; the ER-1 has some interesting synthesis and some ""909-ish"" PCM samples.  Honestly, the UI of 80s cheap PCM drum machines are pretty crap. I'd actually recommend a sampler like the ESX-1 or MPC-500 instead. You can load it up with drum machine sounds you like and you get a much better interface. Unless you're really looking for a specific sound of some specific hardware, or, you're really into the idea of using some specific vintage drum machines (I was ... and can understand that), I'd definitely recommend against and just go with a sampler instead."

synthesizers,39vs77,misterinterrupt,5,Mon Jun 15 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"The way I work tends to be pattern based so I record phrases as MIDI into Cubase, cut and paste rhythms to lay down a skeleton, then introduce variation, other layers and melodies, and when I'm ready to commit I use my 18i8 to multitrack the kick, snare and percussion, and a couple of synth lines. For some tracks the same synth might play two or three parts so I have to make several passes but I don't mind, it's how I used to record everything anyway before the 18i8 came into my life!   This traditionally has than been when effects enter play; I've accumulated some wonderful VST effects overs the last 17 years of Cubase recording; Fabfilter Q, PSP Vintage Warmer, Lexicon reverbs, so I have a decent rack to shape the wavs once they are committed to disk. However, I just got an Eventide Space so I suspect the Lexicons might be taking a backseat in the future. It will mean a radical overhaul in my workflow as I'll need to get the mix right before recording, and also have to go back to multiple passes for any part that needs reverb..."
synthesizers,39vs77,t0xicd0g,2,Mon Jun 15 06:29:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds very similar to the way i work.  I like to come up with a couple of parts on my hardware, Drums and a bassline first, or maybe a synth hook that came out of nowhere.  i used to plan my tracking out a lot more and try to re-record parts that were a little too sloppy or whatever. But i've come to the realization that some of those little mistakes are actually what gives a track character in a lot of cases, so i like keeping a certain amount of mistakes in there. (as the producer, you will always notice the little mistakes more than anyone else)  I was using the lexicon reverbs myself for a couple of years too, got very used to using them (in my friends recording studio) and then i had to go back to just having ableton lives stock reverb, which i acually think is pretty damn good.  Would you not be best off working with the lexicons (generic setting) while your tracking, and then setting up the 'space' to use as an FX send in parallel to your dry sound? thats what i used to like doing with the Roland RE-201 or any reverb pedals we had around so i could preform the delay etc. on a separate pass"
synthesizers,39vs77,Synthhead44,2,Mon Jun 15 11:16:29 2015 UTC,"Eh, the tracking issue with the Space is just something I'll live with. It's not like every single track will be drenched in reverb, after all! The Lexicons are lovely, they really do have a nice character to them for a VST, but lately I've been eyeing the Space and the Big Sky because they go way beyond the Lexicons and also have a wonderfully hands on interface that allow you to include them as part of the sound design stage as well as being amazing reverbs in their own right.  With regards to multiple passes, I only ever do a handful because I am not a great keyboard player; I record MIDI and then shuffle any really badly out notes into the right place. Basslines I quantise fully; I'm a big fan of the robotically perfect rhythm section, so I don't like sloppiness there. It creates a huge dissonance in my head when I hear beats that aren't perfect. Piano and more melodic stuff (pads, ambience) I tend to record freehand though. Piano is a more organic instrument, like guitar, where I actually like a little imperfection to show through."
synthesizers,39vs77,t0xicd0g,2,Mon Jun 15 13:56:47 2015 UTC,"Yea, i really need to get myself a hardware reverb soon, i've just gotten used to firing up ableton even if i'm only going to have a jam, just so i can bring in some of my reverb presets.  I'm not the best keyboard player myself, so i always did a lot of tracking and just editing out the 'bad notes' and then tracking over that, and so on. in my current setup, i will track a synth part and the midi from the MS20 or whatever, then edit the mistakes in Midi, then track it again while performing the filters, LFO etc."
synthesizers,39vs77,Synthhead44,3,Mon Jun 15 14:52:37 2015 UTC,"I think I'm more skilled at performing than I am at recording. Subsequently I like to record in a live playing style. This has its pros and cons. The biggest con being that I actually have to be warmed up and ready to play before I begin (I use an Elektron Analog 4 and an MS2000). If I don't get parts right, the recording will be full of errors. Then comes the tough choice: was that good enough, or should I try again? I just don't have the patience to write out and practise good lead lines :P Overall, I wouldn't recommend it for accuracy, but it's great for getting drafts done, which is what I have been focusing on lately."

All technology aside, it's difficult to judge your performance.   I want a balance of imperfection in my recordings, but I often dribble with questions like: ""Was it good enough?"", ""Do I even know if it's good enough?"" etc. — Doubting my own competence.  In the end, I seldom really hear the track in its essence until it has been bounced and I'm just listening. Every time I listen to it in the DAW, I tend to look at the different parts and I know what's coming up, which ruins the experience of listening."

In addition to the challenge of judging the performance after the fact, there is another challenge: red light syndrome when trying to improvise in the middle of a track. If I've done a great job soloing, I don't want to ruin the whole mix which can distract me when I'm trying to improvise.   I see at least a few solutions:    install Overbridge and just start multitracking the A4 so that I can loop/edit when necessary forgo using the A4 FX for the sub37 and brute and record those tracks separately get over it, get better at building up tracks, and just have fun   I'm going for the 3rd."

The ease of software synthesizers has really made me more comfortable with recording though — And much better at playing along with a metronome!"
synthesizers,39vs77,mrcolonist,3,Mon Jun 15 18:00:02 2015 UTC,"Hardware all the way. I've got multiple synths and drum machines going into a 24 (ish) channel mixing desk. Some of the synths go through external eq, compression and/or effects. I've got a master compressor and eq on the mix bus.  Tracks are recorded live all in one go off the mixing desk as a stereo file in Logic. No post processing other than trimming the silence at the start and the end of the file. Each take is a live performance, running around messing with various knobs as needed. If the take I did doesn't sound good then I do it all over again so sometimes this can take a while!  As it's mostly analogue stuff I'm stuck working on the same song until I finish it. I can't really pause one track, start another and go back to the first."
synthesizers,39vs77,splitradix,3,Mon Jun 15 11:23:59 2015 UTC,"I've got 16 mono/8 stereo inputs via my interface (Focusrite Saffire Pro 40, with another 8 ins via a Presonus Digimax FS) to my DAW (Ableton Live), so I multitrack in everything. Generally, I program everything pretty meticulously using the song mode of the Octatrack, but it depends on what I am doing, so sometimes I just jam and edit out the best ideas-if I'm doing more ambient or experimental stuff, I often just set up a foundation and roll with it. If I'm arranging things, I usually try to lay everything down in a single take while I improvise over the top, which may mean it takes me a few passes to get a performance I'm happy with-that's one thing I do appreciate about Live's Clip view, as I can just copy my recording from Arrangement and paste it there for later, so I can keep a few different jams in a session and pick the one I like.   Once recorded, I deal with mixing, although I generally don't have to do a lot since I've done the lion's share of the work before I track. I add compression and effects at this stage as well, although I have a good amount of outboard effects, so I generally don't add much ITB other than a little reverb on a send to help put everything in the same space.   It is all very subjective tho. Sometimes I do everything ITB, sometimes I arrange an entire track and once I record it, find some small bit that I warp and end up making an entirely different track from. I think the big thing for me is having my space set up to go at a moments notice-I don't have to waste time with plugging in any gear because I have everything routed through my midi and audio patchbays, so it only takes me seconds to make changes to my setup, and that means I don't have to stop working to try something out. That's probably the biggest tip that I can give to anyone with a growing collection of hardware-get organized! You have no idea how much time you're wasting in your creative process by setting up gear every time you want to use it."
synthesizers,39vs77,rodentdp,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:19:59 2015 UTC,Great topic!  I am trying to multitrack all the synths into this program called Capture that works with the StudioLive mixer. I set up various patterns and then do takes for each synth and then go to it slicing up and re-composing the various tracks that sound best..  I also generally record any midi into live and sometimes I will record some sounds into live and use the melody recognition feature to get some midi from something and then re-use that.  I have a hard time moving on to a new sound on the analog gear with no memory because I don't want to lose a patch without getting all I can out of it and don't know of a good way to save patch info other than a quick photo of it or whatever.. so that slows me down a little.
synthesizers,39vs77,misterinterrupt,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:07:16 2015 UTC,"My setup at the moment consists of, [what's in my flair], Focurite Saffire Pro40 (8in 10out) FW interface, Yamaha HS50M monitors, Atari Punk Console (just built last week), Akai APC20, Maudio Oxygen49. FX: Boss Syb-5 (Modded) Bass synth and a Boss ODB3 Bass Overdrive.  For a number of years i worked mostly ITB in Pro Tools and Logic, writing a lot of midi, and heavily editing my bass guitar playing to fit with my synth stuff and drums, and the metronome.  for a good few years my ESX1 was my only piece of hardware, so along with an Mbox2 (2in) interface, my workflow was all about tediously tracking the kick, the snare, the hats etc. one by one from an ESX pattern, just so i could mix them later. Then i would play some bass, or synth or whatever over the drums/samples/Esx stuff. Then finally i would spend so long trying to mix and 'edit' things, that i would get the dreaded loss of perspective, and just move on without finishing the track in most cases.   These days, with having enough hardware to make a jam turn into a track much quicker, as well as more than enough ins/outs to ableton live, i rarely spend more than 2-3 days on a track. I don't strive to make things ""perfect"" anymore like i used to, because i realized that the more i tried to mix my tracks to be 'loud enough', or perfectly in time/to metronome, the more i was sucking the life out of it. Most of the music i enjoy listening to has lots of flaws and imperfections, and in a lot of cases that's what i like about it. So i decided to get back to enjoying putting down some tracks, and not worrying about the small details so much, at least for my own tracks.  I try to Keep my setup as 'ready to go' as possible, so i have a template set up in live with a specific channel and Fx set up for each of my pieces of hardware. I have a Midi track set up for the MS20mini (USB) too, and a MIDI track set up for the V.Keys, which utilizes my Oxygen49s Keyboard to give the keys, keys. so generally a jam could turn into a track within minutes of turning everything on."

synthesizers,39vs77,revolved,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:48:42 2015 UTC,"I have two recorders, a Zoom R16 and a Yamaha AW16G.  The Zoom is great as an 8-input DAW interface, but its lack of any sync means it's not always a good choice away from the PC - it's good if you want to record something in one live take, or if you're doing something that's not beat-centric, but otherwise it's a hassle.  That's a shame because it's a nice, well-built, compact and silent unit with tons of space via SD cards. There's not much in the way on onboard editing, but it's really designed to let you capture tracks and then get them into a DAW for finishing. Still, some kind of MIDI sync would shift it from great into amazing territory - and if the Beatstep can do it, the R16 can.  So there's that. The AW16G is a different kind of beast - much more of a full out-of-the-box recorder. The effects and EQ are very flexible and accessible, you can edit on it, you can easily patch around the inputs and so on. It uses a hard drive, so it's heavier and noisier than the R16, which is a shame. Exporting wave files means burning them to a CD, which is a hassle these days, but you can just mix straight out of it easily enough.  The appeal of the AW16G is that I prefer staying away from the laptop where possible... I enjoy working in Live and Renoise, but I get on better keeping things purely ITB with them. When I'm using hardware, I like it to be all hardware - I just find it more relaxing and enjoyable that way.  The main problem I've had with it has been sync. It has MIDI, but it's a bit... fussy - in some modes it can only be master, for example, and I've had no luck getting it to slave to anything so far.  I've been trying to crack it off and on for... well, a few years now, I guess. It's not crucial for me, so I just dip into it until I get frustrated enough to put it aside again.  Anyway, this week I've been having another go, trying to get it synced to the Octatrack, I did manage to get the OT working as a slave device using MIDI clock, but then I found that it would no longer respond to its own transport controls - so I couldn't run the OT independently, the AW16G clock had to be running for it to respond.  That's not ideal at all, so I was starting to get that giving up feeling again. But then I decided I'd try it with the Rytm, just in case. I wasn't very hopeful, and it would have made much more sense to try something from a different maker, but the Rytm was all hooked up and I'm a lazy man.  And it worked! AW16G as master, Rytm as slave, using MIDI clock. The Rytm worked fine on its own and also played in time with the AW16G when it's running.  My level of excitement was quite pathetic, given that this is exactly what's supposed to happen. Straight away I cleared the devices' projects and embarked on an eight-track recording of the Rytm, one track at a time. They all stayed in sync. Perfect!  This is a major development. My next step - tonight, hopefully - is to chain up the OT via the Rytm and see if I can get that to behave itself in this setup. And after that, I want to run a long DIN Sync test with the Rytm driving my 303. If both those things work, I think I might have arrived at the optimal configuration of my hardware. All that's left is to somehow smush the AW16G and R16 together into a beautiful home recording chimera."

I haven't used the ElectribeS, so I can't comment on its strengths, but it looks to be at heart a loop and one-shot sampler.  As such it might not be optimised for transposing samples, which might explain why things are sounding freaky when played that way.  Older rack samplers tend to handle this kind of thing very well, by offering zones and layers and crossfades and various other features, and by having carefully crafted custom algorithms that vary from maker to maker and from sampler to sampler.  It's easy to assume that a sampler just plays what you put in and that they're pretty much interchangeable, but you'll find people swearing by a certain Akai for drum & bass, another Akai for hip-hop, another Akai for instruments, an Emu for this, a Yamaha for that and so on.  As I say, my impression of the ES is that it's built for phrases, loops and one-shots, rather than broader sampling duties. This is the case for most modern hardware samplers, because PCs running software like Kontakt are far more convenient for large and complex instrument samples. My Octatrack will only transpose over a limited range, and my SP-404SX doesn't offer any pitched playback at all.  Still, as the ES seems to offer pitched playback, you can try a few things to make the most of it.  Your source material is going to be key - if the ES is just repitching its samples (I'm not sure if this is the case), you want to aim for as 'pure' a sound as you can get. If your source sample has a little warble at the one second mark, that warble is going to move around as you transpose it, and it'll sound pretty obvious and clunky.  You can try to make the best of the weird results - some samplers have a very unnatural sound if pushed in certain directions, which is often desirable and unique. That'll be a case of sampling everything you can think of and making a note of what works. On my old S-950, a snippet of a piano note tail can sound fantastic when looped and pitched down - rubbish if you want a convincing piano, great if you want an unusual pad or unsettling bass.  You could also look into single-cycle waveforms - if you can load these into the ES you should find they play well across a wide range (and save on memory). But making them sound interesting depends on the filters and envelopes in the sampler. This is the closest you'll get to using a sampler as a synth - basic waveforms sculpted into patches. It still won't match even the most basic of modern VAs, but it'll have its own character.  I'm sure other ES owners will have more useful advice, but I think basically you need to get to know the sampler and work out what it's good at and what it's not so good at."
synthesizers,39w8c9,3lbFlax,2,Mon Jun 15 09:04:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't used the ElectribeS, so I can't comment on its strengths, but it looks to be at heart a loop and one-shot sampler. As such it might not be optimised for transposing samples, which might explain why things are sounding freaky when played that way.   Yes, I believe it is intended to largely be used as a loop and one-shot sampler as it has no zones, but can do transposition to interesting effect. This being the case, am I correct in making the generalization that loop and one-shot samplers are typically used in beat oriented percussive music making and opposed to less ""urban"" or melodic music? (I think if I get the nod this all makes perfect sense to me)"
synthesizers,39w8c9,3lbFlax,2,Mon Jun 15 15:48:09 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, but I imagine the preset samples on the ES might suggest a focus on dance music. A sampler has a place anywhere! But the older rack samplers were frequently used as instrument replacements - in place of organs, pianos, flutes and so on, using complex multisampled patches. The Electribe, along with most (if not all) modern hardware samplers, isn't designed for this.  Oops! Sudden submission based on having to leave the PC..."

synthesizers,39w8c9,Rxke2,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:28:40 2015 UTC,"u/3lbFlax is right, older samplers had a more extensive synth engine, S+S (Sample + Synthesizing) structure, which made it (more) possible to build 'realistic' instruments form samples. Lots of modern day hardware samplers can look very basic in the synthesize dept, because they're often indeed mainly loop or phrase oriented. Though it is often a grey zone which sampler excels in which dept... Multilayered, dynamic aware zones can be a necessity to make dynamic rhythm patterns, so some 'old clunkers' can excel in this, some old samplers have a lot going for them, but often a pita to program..."

Are you comparing synth presets with your 'own' samples? Presets are very often made by professionals, tweaked, optimized, enhanced with built in fx... to sound usable or musical from the word go. With your own samples, you have to work harder, even if they are from libraries, the electribe samples probably does not import stuff like adsr, effect, loop, filter, .... settings, so you often have to 'massage' your 'raw' samples to an extent to make them usable musically instead of percussively. tweaking ADSR settings and adding some subtle fx to make it 'gel' better can go a long way."

If you can crack the A4 > MD sync, I'd try using the A4 as the master and Live as the slave (if you haven't already). I've had very little luck with Live driving the A4, though my Mac does a better job than my Windows laptop. I was trying something at the weekend, and I had Live under Windows as the master driving the A4 over USB. My patch on the A4 had a heavy delay, and it sounded awful - like a record deck with a dying motor, but only when the A4 was slaved to MIDI. I figure it was the A4 varying the tempo-synced delay in response to constant slight BPM fluctuations from Live.  As I say, my Macbook gets better results, and I expect if I put in a few hours I could improve things a little. I'm really just getting it off my chest while there's an opportunity.  So anyway, first thing I'd do is remove Live from the equation and work out syncing the MD to the A4. Once that's done you can bring Live back in and try it as both slave and master, see if one way works better than the other."

synthesizers,39rxzw,technotomato,9,Sun Jun 14 04:17:12 2015 UTC,"Alright. I sold my 808 and 303 for an Octatrack and a Blofeld and it's probably the best gear decision I've ever made. This thing is a beast that can mangle audio in any way you want to. You'll spend a couple of weeks working hard at coming to terms with it, watch every YouTube video out there and then suddenly you just realize that you can make whatever the fuck you want.   In a way, I feel like the Octatrack is like being free from hardware. I'm thinking in terms of chords, sounds and notes now instead of thinking how I can pull this off with the gear I have.   The Octatrack handles midi sequencing like a champ and sending five different midi tracks to the Blofeld at the same time is a breeze.   Words can not express how happy I am with it. Being a chronic gear trader,  there's a very strange feeling around having a piece of gear that you can imagine selling, because what the fuck would replace it?   Some people list the 8 tracks with a sound playing on each as a limitation, but I've never had a problem with it. Due to the way samples work on it, you can easily have three or four sounds per track. I like laying down the kick and snare on the same track by playing it in and then programming a hihat with the steps and then doing a pass where I record the retriever automation for some really alive sounding drums.   Dude, I could talk about this thing for hours.   Cons: price."
synthesizers,39rxzw,Visti,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:05:59 2015 UTC,I would agree that OT+Blofeld is a perfect combination. The Multimode on the Blofeld is the best 'upper shelf' for the OTS lower support layer of beats and miscellaneous samples. In addition the MIDI mappings the OT can sequence sometimes can control parameters that even the Blo itself can't modulate (don't have an example right now but I could later.. .) In other words those two machines become a freaking explosive powerhouse of electronic music!
synthesizers,39rxzw,catchierlight,7,Sun Jun 14 22:36:22 2015 UTC,"The OT is fine for sampling all kinds of things. It doesn't add the character that you get from something like an S-950 or other lower-bit sampler, but the track effects more than make up for that.  What it can't really handle is polyphonic sampling in the manner of old rack samplers. So you can't easily grab a second of violin from a record and start building chords from it. That's a shame, but it's just the nature of the machine.  You don't even need to sample at all with it - just pile a selection of wavs on a CF cards and you've already got limitless opportunities. The free Adventure Kid waveform pack will let you set up endless single-cycle monosynths, and you'll be able to run eight of them simultaneously, all with two effect blocks. It's epic.  It's also a great starting point for a home studio - it'll be able to record and sequence any gear you pick up in the future, and can also serve as a small mixer - you can have two stereo / four mono inputs either mixed with the OT or being processed by some of its tracks.  An example setup would be to have a stereo drum machine on tracks 1 & 2, two monosynths on 3 & 4, tracks 5-7 running internal samples and track 8 as a master effect processor (letting you out a freeze delay on the whole mix, for example). Just three internal tracks doesn't sound like much, but you can do a hell of a lot with them, and if you don't want to process the drum machine with OT effects you can just mix it straight through and get an extra two tracks to play with.  If fascists told me I could only keep one piece of gear, I'd pick the OT in a heartbeat - and I've got a Voyager and a 303 up there. It's endless, immediate joy - as deep as you could want on its own, but very welcoming of extra gear."

synthesizers,39rxzw,dafragsta,2,Sun Jun 14 04:37:59 2015 UTC,"the RYTM has sampling and a very tiny bit of the Octatrack sample workflow is hinted at, so I also think it would be a good place to start. I have the dark trinity (hence the flair) but I'm STILL finding blindspots in my understanding of the Octatrack after a year and a half. Though to be honest, because of the learning curve, I still use other things to do some of the things the Octatrack can do, because I feel it's main strength is in sequencing samples with parameter locks. This means I almost never sample with it. I just filled up a 32GB CF card half way with my homemade loops and one-shot collection which I use for other things."
synthesizers,39rxzw,honeyp,5,Sun Jun 14 15:50:35 2015 UTC,"Biggest Pro: it can change BPM without messing up the pitch of any sample in a track.

synthesizers,39rxzw,TheGreatWildFrontier,4,Sun Jun 14 09:49:49 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on what you want to use it for. I'm into ambient/experimental/sound design stuff, and the Octatrack has been such a boon for me. I'd say it's biggest limitations would be having only 8 tracks and it's workflow can be detrimental to some. There's a lot to learn...it's a very deep machine. I'd recommend scouring the Elektronauts forum before purchasing, most questions you might have will be better answered there.  It's workflow can be described as ""abnormal"". It's abnormal compared to how other samplers work, but if you take your time to get used to it, it feels like second nature. I find it refreshing and fitting to my own workflow.  Sampling other forms of audio is no issue. Everything that is put in to it sounds the same coming out of it. It doesn't color your sound, so don't expect it to magically make your shit sound better.   I think it would help to have gear to sample from. I mean you could sample from anything. Doesn't even have to be other music gear. But having stuff to feed is necessary as well.   I think it comes down to what you are looking for. You can make complete tracks with it, but 8 tracks isn't much and it's not as easy as a DAW. It is still a very powerful machine and you have to be willing to get creative with the workflow and what you feed into it."

Honestly a lot of the tutorials out there are needlessly complex."
synthesizers,39rxzw,MonsieurX,5,Sun Jun 14 05:15:59 2015 UTC,"OT owner here. It's true that with other synths available the OT becomes a studio centerpiece/swiss knife/DAW alternative. But the OT requires a lot of practice (which is itself part of what creative juices you'll make of it). A real synth (poly if possible) will be a better music tool than the OT  But the OT is not just good at arranging songs or parts of a sample into a track but also as a creative tool to make music with - anything ""in"" a sound can be used to create a sound and play it on your keyboard (via midi) - almost everything that a synth can do to a wave, an OT can do to a sample (note that a sample is also a wave).   I got also an AnalogRytm and I wish i had bought it before the OT (although i have no regrets getting the OT 1st). The AR is far more in terms of a synth than the OT and im sure the A4 will eat the AR's synth capabilities for breakfast. Each have their strengths and weaknesses. Sampling, mangling and sequencing that sample is where the OT excels. So having another synth to play with for the OT makes more sense IMOHO but the OT is amazingly capable once you learn to mangle any part of a sample and turn it into a song.   And any sound will do because the OT will turn one sample into a symphony of 8 differrent sounding instruments which you can arrange, resample, remangle and go crazy with - synths can't really do that as easily if at all! Only thing missing in the OT is a keyboard (or pads).  The Analog Rytm is a great alternative to the OT and it has different synths to play with including sampling, mangling and sequencing capabilities.  Since you are also interested in the BS2, maybe a BS2 and a used OT can set you up... I definitely recommend the Elektron gear but if your budget is kind of short, you'll have more alternatives with cheaper gear (BS2, mininova, some pedals and some drum machine for the same price - but you'll need a mixer and a DAW...)"

This is great and adds alot of spontinaety and freeing nature to any studio... and that's not to say you can't program and edit great deal of music with precision and predictability, but I think it does have a great strength as a playable tool. biggest downside in my mind? Well for one it is limited by its architecture, so it will never be a full 'daw' in a box. Which is fine. But for example you cannot select and copy and paste short selections within patterns, you can't select say three beats worth of pattern information and loop it so it becomes 3,6,9 iterations of itself. You can create this effect by painstakingly copying each tracks info within each of those 3 beats and laying them out any way you want, but you can't select that region and copy/paste. See what I'm saying? Though it has an audio editor, it is limited to a specific set of operations. And as has been said there is an 8 track limit. So what I'm saying is incredibly powerful but it is not 'Ableton in a box'... though what it is is many things ableton will never be, because it is a box and it is a solid and powerful instrument in and of itself and that's how I often think it should he appreciated."

It's got a knob for practically everything, but there's still a small bit of menu diving for things like the FM envelope parameters and expanded effect settings. The filter cutoff knob can get a bit steppy sounding if you move it very slowly with the resonance set high, but if you map the mod wheel to the filter cutoff you can achieve slow sweeps with no noticeable filter stepping at all."
synthesizers,39ukm7,KilroytheKilljoy,2,Mon Jun 15 01:50:47 2015 UTC,Novation K-Station   UltraNova probably a better choice - better VA engine and more voices (18 as opposed to 8). There isn't many K's on the used market either. I don't know if the K-Station's VA engine is better than the MicroKorg - which is based on the MMT technology. I really like the sound of the MK and it is actually quite easy to program.
synthesizers,39ukm7,ranzee,3,Sun Jun 14 23:27:04 2015 UTC,"actually quite easy to program.   Only if you are not trying to program it live. MK assumes you program first, then perform later. Absolutely critical to read the manual & set the four soft pots & mod wheel appropriately before you save each preset so that you get access to the things you need."
synthesizers,39ukm7,ouij,8,Mon Jun 15 01:15:35 2015 UTC,"First off, the MicroKorg hasn't got 'proper' keys, it has mini keys, which many people don't like, so consider whether you're happy with that first.   You could probably pick up an MS2000 for that price, or not much more, which is a MicroKorg in a full sized body covered in knobs, sliders and buttons to make programming it a LOT easier. You could probably also find a Novation K Station or KS4/5 in that price range, or a Yamaha AN1x, or a Korg R3 (which is basically a MiniKorg XL with full sized keys and a slightly nicer interface).   The question is, why does the MicroKorg seem to you to be the best choice?"
synthesizers,39ukm7,t0xicd0g,2,Sun Jun 14 22:47:57 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the MK negs here. For a start, it is the most highest selling synth in the current market. An AN1X will cost more - and the synth is really old. The R3 is pretty good - but more expensive. The MS-2000 is awesome, but once again, used. You can pick up a new MK for chips today - with brand new warranty. Best thing about this synth is that it sounds awesome, there's a battery compartment for total portability, and there's a stack of people writing patches for free for it!"
synthesizers,39ukm7,ranzee,5,Sun Jun 14 23:30:18 2015 UTC,"I think he made a fair point.  He said OP could pick up an MS-2000, not should, and asked for clarification as to what was appealing about the MK.  The mini-keys is certainly something to consider for anyone looking for a traditional keybed.  All the synths he recommended would allow OP easier programming of original patches.  We should no more assume that OP wants someone else's presets. But your points about a warranty and battery operation are valuable also.  OP can only benefit from knowing all the options."
synthesizers,39ukm7,Lurkmcgirk,4,Mon Jun 15 00:11:06 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the MK negs here.    The MicroKorg is a compromise synth. It has a very good synth engine, but a somewhat compromised interface. It is a great synth for performers who need a synth to play live, but who aren't fussed about fine control of all synthesis parameters at all times.   I say this a lot: the Microkorg's design assumes that sound design/programming is a separate process from playing/performing. Once you accept this, the design makes a lot of sense.   There are a lot of questions for OP, though:   How much polyphony do you need? The MicroKorg is a 4-voice polyphonic instrument. Polyphony drops to 2 voices for layered programs.  Do you need full-size keys? The Microkorg has micro keys. This is a marginal step up from your OP-1's buttons, but not great. I find it hard to get a good touch on them. If you're looking for a better keyboard than the OP-1 (and you want a keyboard instrument, rather than a controller and a sound module) , the MicroKorg is not what you're looking for. A used MS-2000 will have full-sized keys (and the same synthesis engine as the MicroKorg, plus better controls).  Do you have particular synthesis needs?  The Novation MiniNova has a much more complex synthesis engine than either the MicroKorg or MicroKorg XL. Although the Microkorg can fake some two-operator FM (using the ""cross modulation"" parameter and some clever programming), its wavetable implementation isn't as robust as the Novation MiniNova's. Sweepable wavetables are pretty cool, but the MicroKorg doesn't give wavetable index as a modulation destination.  How much are you willing to spend? If you're thinking about a MicroKorg, I'm pretty sure you're not in the Prophet 12 market, so I won't waste your time. But the Novation UltraNova can be had for around $350 or so used sometimes. This is a really good deal, especially in my area, where I've seen MS-2000s go for around that much. The UltraNova has a better synth engine, but slightly less knobby interface.    The MicroKorg is a great little synth though. It's cheap, ubiquitous, versatile, and it sounds good. You just need to understand its quirks and limitations."
synthesizers,39ukm7,ouij,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:09:10 2015 UTC,"Compromise synth - of course it is - look at the price - it is amazing value for what it offers - and its been around for over 10 years - pretty amazing record for a synth to still be selling new since 2002. Korg are probably making them for $20 now - they've been doing it for so long.  Programming: Depends on what you mean by programming - I've played live and changed things like ARP time-rates, delay time-rates, key-priority and layering on-the-fly whilst playing live (some of which you can see me doing on my youtube video a few months ago). If you mean programming a new sound from scratch - well, I kinda don't see the point of why you'd want to do this live - that's what the patch memory is for and it probably isn't what an MK is for either.  I agree with your other points about polyphony voices and keyboard size - but they were also mentioned earlier by others.   About the mini-keys: I don't mind mini-keys - I'm not a concert pianist. Most of the time I'm only using one hand on the MK - so the mini-keys actually helps in a way.  About used gear: Why not get a used MK - then you'd have a steal - and apply the same principles as everyone else has earlier about buying used gear ;)"
synthesizers,39ukm7,ranzee,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:46:02 2015 UTC,"It's not about programming it live, it's about making a sound from scratch at home. The Microkorg's interface isn't particularly friendly when it comes to patch construction; my Tetra sounds amazing, but when I want to sit and create, I keep on getting drawn back to the KS4 because it bristles with knobs and sliders; creativity is swift and painless, whereas the Tetra is slow and ponderous, even with the Remote template helping me out. I know I'd rather have an MS2000 than a MK for this exact reason despite the loss of warranty. I want a synth so I can make my own sounds freely and easily, and it's exactly why my next big purchase will be a Mopho X4 so I can get the most out of the Tetra."

The Roland System-1 is a really nice interface VA - but lacks voices. I do like the KS4 - but there aren't many for sale on Ebay at the moment - and sold listings show an average of $300 USD. I cannot comment on the KS4 - as I have not heard it, played it or know much about it - so I'll leave that corner for you to enjoy :)  But I do know what you mean - a knob-per main function synth is awesome - like the Moog Sub 37 or even the BS2 - so much fun."

Depending what they want from a synth there are a ton of alternatives available that might just do the job better.  And you think he should avoid an AN1x because it's really old? I don't get it, what am I missing here? It sounds amazing, it has a decent and easy to grasp interface for programming...what's not to love? It's also no more expensive used than a brand new MicroKorg.  I'd also wouldn't suggest that tons of people making free patches was necessarily a great thing.

synthesizers,39ukm7,t0xicd0g,2,Mon Jun 15 00:51:47 2015 UTC,Oh I agree with you - the AN1X is an amazing synth - my point about it being old is purely along the lines of product being protected with a new warranty vs older electronics may not survive (a bit of a gamble). Spec-wise - there's no argument - the AN1X is hands-down a winner.  I disagree with the price - unless things have changed recently - I was looking for an AN1X only a few months ago - and they were rare to find and when there were some - they were in the $600 range.

The cryptic ""alarm clock"" style display is tough to make sense of. The software editor is far quicker, easier to use and easier to understand. (And, I might be mistaken about this, but I'm pretty sure you can only enable oscillator sync by using the software editor. I don't remember where it might be in the menu on the unit itself.)  Even with those downsides, I enjoy writing new patches and using it. The sounds are still pretty good. And that you can get one for $200 on the aftermarket is a big plus."
synthesizers,39ukm7,TheAnalogLights,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:06:19 2015 UTC,"The MK is fine and dandy, as long as you're comfortable with the small keys and limited polyphony. It sounds great and there's a reason it's everywhere - it has a solid balance of sounds, price and portability.  Are there better options? Possibly, depending on what you want to do. The Mininova will give you a lot more polyphony, additional synthesis modes (like wavetables), five effect blocks and more flexibility all-round. It might not have the immediacy of a Microkorg, if you want to be playing stuff right off the bat. I had an original MK and it had a very good set of default patches, which were good starting points for programming. With the Nova I think you need to dive more into the guts of it to get results. Of course if that's what you're looking for, so much the better.  I assume you want a poly, but if that's not a central concern you've got the Bass Station 2 as an option. That would give you something you don't have on the Op-1, an analog mono. I suspect they'd be great partners in terms of sampling the BS2 into the Op-1. The BS2 also has larger keys and aftertouch, if that's something you're looking for.  And of course as others have said, there are scores of used options - you'll definitely be able to do better than the MK with some diligent eBaying.

I'm using an 18i8 at the moment which is the same thing but with more inputs and outputs so I can multitrack all my gear without having to mess about with mixers or making multiple passes to record the audio tracks.  While you're at it, I'd look up Dexed, a free VST (virtual instrument) that is basically a DX7, but with a much easier to use interface (no more selecting parameters and then adjusting one slider) and complete patch compatibility with the DX7 so you can make sounds on Dexed, hear them as you program, and then dump them across to the DX7 via MIDI."

synthesizers,39q78k,gtani,3,Sat Jun 13 21:48:39 2015 UTC,"Damn, didn't realise the 2i2 didn't have MIDI. OP, ignore that one and look at some higher up models in the range..."

synthesizers,39q78k,gtani,2,Sun Jun 14 03:56:42 2015 UTC,Go for the Steinberg UR22. Same as the focusrite but with midi in and out. Plus its better looking IMO.

synthesizers,39q78k,IanStarGem,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:18:36 2015 UTC,So I actually already have a Scarlett 2i2 but like the other poster said it does not have MIDI support. Could I get a MIDI-to-USB cable like the one I originally posted to do things like send sysex libraries to the DX7 via MIDI?
synthesizers,39q78k,t0xicd0g,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but make sure it's a half decent one; some really cheap cables can be a bit dodgy especially when sending SysEx, so don't skimp and get the cheapest one."

The older model mpk61 is heavier and maybe a little bit more durable. Where as the newer mpk225 are way lighter, which is better for the road and the build is still really good it's just constructed with lighter material.   The drumpads on the old models aren't that great where as the newer models light up and they feel really good. There's a little bit more bells and whistle on the newer models too. And what I love most about the mpk series are the keys. I really like the way they feel and they're quiet.  In the end, the the newer models are probably a little better because the drumpads and it's way lighter. If the condition of mpk249 is fine than i'd say that's a pretty decent deal. However, it's the same price as a new mpk49."

synthesizers,39oaus,t0xicd0g,3,Sat Jun 13 07:59:56 2015 UTC,Which would you recommend? Do any offer any flexibility in sample-rate or interpolation?
synthesizers,39oaus,t0xicd0g,5,Sat Jun 13 08:56:12 2015 UTC,"It really depends what your needs are; the V Synth is not very traditional sampler, more of a sample mangling synth though I'm sure you could just load in multisample sets into it.; the A4000 and S5000 are old school rackmount samplers with extensive controls over keymapping, are hugely polyphonic and multitimbral, but perhaps lack modern features like USB sample transfer; the Microsampler is a reasonably straightforward sampler in a knobby keyboard interface; and the MPCs are sequencer/beat machine powerhouses who also, with JJOS, offer keygroups for MIDI playable samples.   As far as I know the newer ones all offer some form of bitcrushing and resampling, and certainly of the older ones the Yamaha offers a really powerful and controllable lo-fi effect.  Off the top of my head I also just remembered the Akai Z series, which are more up to date than the S5000."
synthesizers,39oaus,Lurkmcgirk,3,Sat Jun 13 09:33:59 2015 UTC,Maybe you could find one of these at a good price.  I remember seeing a video of Jamiroquoi's team using one in studio.  I'm not sure if this shares some tech with the V-synth  http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/vp9000.php

synthesizers,39oaus,FeelinDank,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:13:16 2015 UTC,I'd imagine it scales fine over many octaves since the E2 synth version does when I MIDI it up to a keyboard. The standard is multitimbral so long as you set up MIDI channels correctly.

I likely would have taken care to pull straight up rather than at an angle though, as I already had one busted knob which was why I was opening it up to begin with. :)  I've also been reading up on cleaning the nefarious ""black goo"" out of my Rogue and one of the write-ups I found on that process says, ""If a rotary knob is tight, use some string, a T-shirt hem, or a table fork to get under it and coax it off.""

synthesizers,39lww6,SFritzon,5,Fri Jun 12 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely, like I said, I knew what I was getting into and mostly wanted this as a dedicated drum machine. My reference point is the MC-505 which is a beast to manage by comparison. The sequencer for melodic parts is fine and I enjoy the wide variety of scales you can lock the part to. Be warned though that everything is quantized which seems odd to me but you can get around it with resampling a melody you play in realtime and loading that as a one-shot."
synthesizers,39lww6,slujj-vohaul,6,Fri Jun 12 18:44:54 2015 UTC,"Great write-up.   My main beef with the ElectribeS is the lack of any true timestretching, but I knew that before I bought it so it didn't come as a surprise. I haven't really been able to effectively use timeslice yet, but I'm going to re-read through your post sometime this weekend when I have some time to dig in a bit.  The only other thing I'm not digging is how samples are managed. I hope Korg (or a third party) releases some type of app or something to do a better job of this.   You get the tool you need, you don’t take an F1 to the grocery store.   AMEN!    (...break)  A little tired of it being compared to other stuff, enjoy it for what it is.

Definitely, if you have used live then it is quite a different animal. There is no comparable time stretch but the best thing I have found with time slicing to different tempos is to set it at 1/8 or 1/16 and then adjust the pitch so that you are at least not changing the overall length of the sample and you can get it to lock easily.    The only other thing I'm not digging is how samples are managed.   My main goal has been to figure out how to get this thing set up how I want it so I can do as little of that going forward. The sliced kits really seems to help but that is more for drums."
synthesizers,39lww6,RedStarFuture,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:49:05 2015 UTC,Wait... it doesn't time stretch? I just assumed it would..
synthesizers,39lww6,RedStarFuture,2,Fri Jun 12 18:46:06 2015 UTC,"The thing I can't understand is how you can play samples with the SD card out (the factory samples), import a sample from the SD card and then take the card out (it will still play just fine). But it won't be there when you turn it back on...why can't whatever memory is internal just remember what is put on it? It clearly can, it just can't remember. Like, why can the factory samples be remembered? If we delete the factory samples why can't we just fill THAT memory with are own...so strange.  The loading times aren't that bad, but it was one of those ""damn it korg, so close"" moments. That being said, i'll keep using it and enjoy it quite a bit. What would REALLY help is if someone came up with a sample file editor so you can create your own .all file on the computer."
synthesizers,39lww6,Variar80s,5,Fri Jun 12 18:52:59 2015 UTC,"So I think this is a ROM vs RAM issue. The ROM is where all the factory samples are stored and when you boot without a card you will notice that it still needs to load all of these into the sampler. ROM (Read Only Memory) can never be written to. If you boot with the blank template there is absolutely no load time because there is no instruction to load from ROM to RAM. The state of RAM is wiped when no power is supplied. I don't know how most other hard drive samplers work or where the load time is but I would assume that there has to be a time when it is loading the samples into memory because it would be too slow to always read from the hard drive.   What would be great is if there were a way for the electribe to simply read the structure off of the card so that you could go to a pattern and say ""load pattern samples"" and it would grab all of the samples that begin with the numbers for the oscillator parts in that pattern."

synthesizers,39mp4d,revolved,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:33:02 2015 UTC,"(this got a little long; however, overall my impression of the Arpanoid was negative.  See below.) I sold mine.  Lack of midi sync in the time, #Steps knob is really hard to control.  Expression pedal input here would lead to a lot of interesting possibilities.  Except, no.  It simply WOULD NOT PLAY NICE with delay because it doesn't have midi.    It has a weird take on apegiation that was really interesting in open tunings on guitar and it was a nice 'walk away' stompbox for when I wanted to check out of playing to think about what I was going to do next.  But since it doesn't have precise timing, you couldn't use it on top of the Sub 37's arp (wouldn't that be interesting?)  When I took a step back from guitar the Arpanoid was the first thing to go back to the music store.  Ultimately EQD's pedals are great for your classic guitar peasants that want something simple and black-box.  I've got nothing against their tone and the heavy leverage of DSP to get that tone.  But I'm pretty married to TC and Strymon pedals for my synth rig since I can CV and Midi Sync them.    In a prog/indie rock context, like the dude from OP is clearly in, they're probably OK pedals.  But for EDM/Ambient precision and modulation are king and there isn't one EQD pedal that will give me that."

synthesizers,39mp4d,The0Justinian,2,Sun Jun 14 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"Flashback, primarily.  The triple flashback and flashback x4 listen to midi clock pretty obediently.  While I'd like it if there were independent dry/wet options so I could create octave delays, the things are workhorses and I can't complain on the tone side.  I've been getting up to some interesting mischief sending CV's thru the expression pedal input as well--you can go into toneprint and pap exp to things other than feedback--some interesting things.  I do wish they'd do a tremolo or phaser that would clock too.  I think it's only dawning on Tor and the guys there that they are providing some nice budget alternatives to strymon.  I'm really digging the tone on the HOF compared to the cathedral, and though it doesn't midi, it does toneprint, and has a nice and modest 'ambience' setting that wettens things up post-delay that I really dig."

synthesizers,39lilp,crowby,14,Fri Jun 12 15:59:41 2015 UTC,"Since I'm the resident AIRA fanboy, I'll provide my perspective. I've had a TR-8 since it came out in March 2014, and I still use it every single day. The 7X7 expansion made it that much more useful for me considering I make synthpop and I often like to use more sample based drum sounds than the very electronic 808/909 sounds. I got the rest of the line within a few months after I got the TR-8 (most recently I got the MX-1) and they all work so perfectly together I couldn't imagine making music without them. The System-1 especially almost always stays in Plug-Out mode and I'm constantly inspired by the sound and most importantly the interface. The TB-3 is wonderful and I never would have considered integrating acid type sounds into my music if I didn't have it so readily available. The VT-3 is just plain fun. I've actually had people over, put it on the coffee table and plugged it into the home theatre system and we had fun for hours hahaha. I think Roland absolutely killed it with the range.   As a side note, even the MX-1 has actually changed my sound a bit since I make use of more sidechaining (volume ducking) now. This makes my music sound a lot more modern than it did previously."
synthesizers,39lilp,GiveUsOurSynths,7,Fri Jun 12 16:25:39 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think Roland killed it and surprised everyone. I can be a little bit of a purist snob sometimes so I blew the whole line of products off and thought they even looked tacky. Then people started making youtube demos and they sound amazing. Now that I have the tr8, I think it actually looks decent.  The new update to the S1 made it a must buy for me. I read something a while back that you can't affect the oscillator pitch individually on the s1 synth. The envelope affects both oscillator pitches. So is there no way to get the classic sync sound?"
synthesizers,39lilp,mobjois,3,Fri Jun 12 18:18:20 2015 UTC,I was a bit surprised at how much I loved the AIRA line. The TR-8 is the centrepiece of my live set. The SYSTEM-1 sounds great: especially the SH-2 Plug-Out.
synthesizers,39lilp,Biopharmer,5,Sat Jun 13 04:35:06 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you brought up the 7X7 expansion, because it's the exact reason I want to buy a TR-8. Paired with my Blofeld and a sequencer I'll be able to have a little live Synthpop setup. The demos of the TR-8 are so good, and it will be perfect for that Italo Disco sound."

Might be short sighted, but I don't have other analog gear at this time, and I don't think I can use the arpeggiator on my Maschine to control other gear."
synthesizers,39lilp,mobjois,3,Fri Jun 12 20:49:46 2015 UTC,High five! I'm also an unexpected AIRA collector. I can't seem to stop buying them. The only thing I don't really use much is the VT-3. Do you use it on vocals or to process other signals?
synthesizers,39lilp,the_cody,4,Sat Jun 13 04:33:56 2015 UTC,I totally agree about the 96khz. I hope they change that in a future update. This is one of the biggest complaints I keep reading about so I hope Roland is listening.   The product design isn't my favorite either but the tr8 has grown on me. But still.. It is a little too Star Trek villain.
synthesizers,39lilp,siquick,10,Fri Jun 12 20:05:54 2015 UTC,"I know the original VT-1 didn't have Midi In, but that killed the VT-3 for me: no Midi DIN In (and no USB Midi In on launch). I would have bought one of these, except for that. I know it's out of scope for the product, so it's not a complaint about the product, just a complaint about what I would have preferred got released.  The MX-1 mixer looks absolutely amazing, but it only takes Aira USB Audio (in addition to a few normal audio ins). And, as I don't have any Aira boxes, it's kinda worthless to me. Which sucks, because, again, it's not what I would have preferred what was released.  My bandmate has a TB-3. He likes it, but isn't all that enthused by it. Mostly because he feels like there is a lot of synthesis power hidden in it and you only have access to the 303 controls (going by the non-303 presets on it). And, again, as above, this is just complaining about what we would have preferred was released.  The System-1 looks really awesome. I've been tempted a few times to pick one up, especially with the price drop (even through it no longer comes with the SH-101 plugout). It think this is a great synth and I hope Roland decides to support it with plugouts for a couple years.  The System-1m ... I'm not a modular guy ... so anything I say is gonna come off as even more whiny than what I said about the VT-3, MX-1 and TB-3. So, I'll just say that the Sonic State video for it looked pretty fun.  The EFX modules ... FUCK YOU ROLAND!! I don't want to get into modular!!! But, these things look AMAZING!! The EFX modules and the Intellijel Atlantis/Metropolis combo would be a complete setup that I wouldn't feel needed anything more to it. Damnit.  The TR-8. I will be buying one of these as soon as I'm moved out of my current place. I'm pretty much sold. I am hoping for a 606 expansion ... ARE YOU LISTENING, ROLAND?! TR-606/DR-110 DRUMS!!!

Loved it. Samples and vst emulations were pretty good, but the TR8 blew me away with the accuracy, the organic feel. It's the first thing I've heard since that old 808 that delivers that chest thump with the kick. I've been pulling stems from years back and comparing the sounds and the TR8 sounds fantastic.

Really my only complaint is programming it. I find it a little opaque, so I haven't really tried to spend a lot of time making it work, so it's a little opaque (round and round that goes).

But I'm really enjoying it, its great for both long sessions of sound design, and for jamming out live. Both the native synth engine and the SH101 plug out sound fantastic; I've been able to get all manner of basslines, pads, FX, and percussive elements out of it. Actually working on making a sound-pack with samples solely from the S1. The Scatter/Arp can occasionally go off-time a smidge when synced to a master clock, but they've improved it quite a bit since release and I imagine could continue to do so."

This has actually worked out well. I spent a fair amount of money getting a sliding curtain designed specifically to absorb sound. The open wall keeps sound from bouncing around too much, and my speakers face the opening, so what comes out of the speakers goes through the curtain a second time after bouncing off the back wall of the condo. We live near a club, so I can always blame them for any noise spillage. It's ok for space, but I'll need to invest in more a appropriate stand situation if I pick up any more synths."

He has written complaints to the landlord about; me typing at midnight; making 'midnight snacks' at half one in the morning (basically making some toast and coffee); and my favourite, complaining about ""a very loud electrical hum that went on into the early hours of the morning"" - that would be my PC running, the same PC that runs every day, every night, for the 6 years I've lived here. The lady at the landlords agency thought it was crazy, and they pretty much don't ever take his complaints seriously since I actually lodged a complaint about his endless harassing over the tiniest noise.

So say the sequencer is running, and it's on step 4. You decide you want to put a clap on step 13, so you hit the pad. The light for the step comes on, but the clap won't actually sound until the next bar - the bar that's currently playing can't be edited.  No idea why it worked that way, but it sapped all the fun out if it for me. Something to be aware of, at any rate.  For fun and intuitive sequencing I think Elektron are hard to beat, and it's often not a huge jump from an RS7000 or 909 to a Machinedrum Mk 1 these days..."
synthesizers,39kxk6,the_cody,6,Fri Jun 12 21:18:00 2015 UTC,"Since I was considering getting an SY77 last week, I ended up revisualizing my studio to figure out how I was going to fit the big bastard in. Didn't end up getting the synth, but I ended up rearranging my entire studio, moving all the furniture, recabling everything, and most importantly redoing all of my midi routing.   The last part was the worst of all, since I use a couple of old Emagic midi patchbays, and the third party software I use can be buggy and doesn't work well for configuring more than one bay at a time-I had to set one up, then turn it off, plug the USB cable into the other one, hope the software would actually see the bay,  try to configure that so that there were not any channel conflicts, turn everything off, reconnect, turn everything on again, hope the software would actually see the bay again, test, rinse, repeat...but now I've got everything set up so that it just works, I can use my different sequencers without conflicting with each other (and was able to separate out my Machinedrum sequencer to sequence my FX units, which is super rad. Spent way too much time geeking out on using P-locks to control the resonator effect on my Quadraverb+), and there's no more messing around with anything more than plugging in a patch cable or changing a midi channel. Here's the end result. What you can't really see is the L-shaped desk on the other side of the room that is now empty, ready to wiggle into Phase 2. :D  EDIT: Due to the hassle involved with setting up those patchbays, I'm thinking it might be handy to pick up an old iBook so I can run the original Emagic software. Anything else you all can think of using one for that might be worthwhile? The first things that came to mind were tracking down a copy of NI's Spektral Delay and maybe as an editor for a Nord Modular if I decided to get one."

It looks like they are very similar(obviously), but the ESX1 has more sample time, and judging by the difference in workflow to my ER1mkIIs sequencer, i'm guessing the ESX1 has improved workflow in that respect too, as well as having the arpeggiator/ribbon, and bigger display.  Only reason i ask is because i always see the ES1 recommended over the ESX on this sub, thought maybe there was something i was missing.  I have all the 808, 909, linndrum etc. samples on my ESX1, with some space left over for resampling and the likes. So either the ES1 or ESX1 should fit your needs quite well.  I also saw an ES1 for seriously cheap on ebay recently, if i didn't already have the ESX1 i would have snatched it up."

I guess ultimately it depends on whether you just like the groovebox thing and don't really want to move away from that idea, and I can understand that (the x0x style sequencers on the Electribes are very much fun to play with live)."

I have actually never played with an MPC before, oddly enough nobody i know ever had one, but with the way people talk about them on here, i know i'm missing out!  Sounds like the ES1 would be great anyway, and the one i saw on ebay was cheaper than you would get a used volca for. So why not!  Thats also the reason i picked up the Er1mk2 when i did, because i could have got either that or a new V.beats for the same money."

I sold it almost as soon as I got it because I knew I needed an Octatrack. However, if I was to do it again, I would probably look at an MPC1000 with JJOS (even the free one, but trust me, you will want to get the paid one eventually) over any Electribe if I was looking for something to fill my sampler needs without splashing out for an OT."
synthesizers,39kxk6,warriorbob,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:56:48 2015 UTC,The point would be to just have a dumb box for the samples more than anything... I've also been told the sampling rate of the es-1 is lower which may sound better for the vintage samples.

Play a scale, and if any voice is soft or weak during the scale, a voice chip may be loose, or bad. Luckily, when I first got my ESQ-1, it was the former problem--super easy to fix. Just had to open up the top and re-situate the problematic voice chip.   Make sure all buttons function properly.  Make sure the sequencer records and plays back properly--In fact, check to make sure the sequencer cartridge isn't missing entirely. Seen quite a few ESQ-1's being sold with the cartridge slot in the back empty.  Also, if it's a plastic version, you don't have to worry as much about the weight, but the metal version is definitely fucking heavy.

I'm likely going to sell the Pulse 2 to fund a Blue Voyager (off ebay) and a Oberheim SEM Pro.  What are your thoughts? Should I get a rack voyager, and put that extra money toward getting another smaller synth? Or maybe I should forgo the voyager altogether and get a sub 37? Or why not just buy an Oberheim Two Voice Pro, keep the Pulse 2 and Prophet....ahhh decisions."
synthesizers,39kxk6,THE_SAUCE_OF_LEGENDS,5,Fri Jun 12 14:28:57 2015 UTC,I have heard great things about the Sub37! It comes down to personal taste really..
synthesizers,39kxk6,slamgauge,6,Fri Jun 12 14:56:48 2015 UTC,"I actually tried out the sub 37 myself. Maybe I didn't spend enough time with it, but to me it didn't sound as large or heavy sonically, as the voyager. I love the arpeggiator and the price tag of the sub 37. The sound would be a 8 out of 10, whereas the voyager gets a 10/10 for what I like."
synthesizers,39kxk6,sheboygan_sexpo,2,Fri Jun 12 15:04:18 2015 UTC,"I have played with the sub fatty but not the 37. Seems like they have the same voice structure though. IMHO the Voyager sounds better, not a whole lot better or maybe not even enough better to justify the price difference, but the difference is there.   Being able to fm the 3rd osc while syncing the 2nd is really cool and I use that fairly often for textures. If you get the cv expansions it really opens the Voyager up for really quick patching or cool experimentation.   There is also the issue of build quality. The sub fatty/37s have been suffering from filter pot failures. They have just started to use Voyager pots for the new 37s that are going out."
synthesizers,39kxk6,ScottFromCanada,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:33:06 2015 UTC,"That probably has a lot to do with the Voyager having one more oscillator than the Sub 37 ;)  That said, being able to up the feedback in the mixer, then cranking the Multidrive under the filter of the Sub 37 makes it pretty damn fat."

I don't have a Sub 37 so I can't comment but I doubt it sounds quite as big as a Voyager, but it's probably close. My Slim Phatty has a really nice sound, but again, it's not a Voyager. Personally I think you would be best for variety with the P08, Voyager and SEM."
synthesizers,39kxk6,ScottFromCanada,4,Fri Jun 12 15:27:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're definitely right about the sonic qualities of the sub 37. While they do sound great, it's not as beefy and big as the voyager. And you're right about the sonic palate... Now it's just a matter of getting an SEM...."

I was really happy with the personal attention their repair technician gave me.  Got a moog slim phatty new recently as well. It is so much more fun than the minitaur and I was having a real blast jamming with it. However it had the same thing happen to it as well regarding the audio out issue. I was just issued an RMA today. Has anyone else had this issue with Moog stuff breaking like this? It seems to affect a few people on the moog forums for both devices. I use a small mixer, no phantom power, new 1/4"" cables and do not move the items off my desk at all; room temperature so I do not think it is me that is causing the issue.

Sometimes I wish for flights to be longer so I have more chance to play with them.  So far the gate security people have been totally fine with them too.

Originally I was a bit disappointed that updating the OS on this thing wouldn't be as easy as buying a newer boot disk, but now I'm glad the OS is stored internally since I won't have to deal with inserting a floppy every time I want to start it up.  Those EPROMs are probably going to be my last hardware-related purchase for a while; I think my current setup is full enough to tide me over until I can afford something more expensive and full-featured than the <$300 ebay equipment purchases I've been making up until now. I've got my eye on the Blofeld for when that time comes, but the interface seems a bit iffy to me (doesn't seem like enough knobs lol) so I'm not completely dead-set on it for now."

The ""well, we have to wait for how the SMDs last over 40 years"" argument is only valid if we fired up Doc Brown's DeLorean and took a KARP back to the past and watched it age alongside a regular Oddy.

I tested this a few years ago, when I first got it, because I was interested in using it as a kind of improvisation recorder, or something. IIRC it works perfectly for that, but I don't use it that way now, because it's mostly my drum setup, and I had to set up my drums apart from my main studio area (in other words my desk, basically) because of limited space.  edit: I'm talking about the SPD-30, the most recent one. there have been several models, so I don't know if that's the one you mean, although I think it's the only one with Phrase Loop."
synthesizers,39lzd9,kisielk,3,Fri Jun 12 19:54:20 2015 UTC,"You are correct. I just sold my SPD-30 and the Phrase Loop is definitely the thing I miss the most. It worked for both MIDI in and out.

synthesizers,39koh0,8Pryme,5,Fri Jun 12 11:57:00 2015 UTC,"What synth do you have?  Some sequencers can have multiple tracks and allow you to transmit them over different MIDI channels. Some synths are multi-timbral and allow you to play different sounds over different MIDI channels. Combine these two together and you get what you want. The question now lies ... what synth do you have - is it multi-timbral?  Not all sequencers do this - but some do - for example the sequencer in the Ensoniq ESQ-1, the ZACQUENCER (a firmware update to the BCR-2000), a Roland MC-505 - and many more. The new Arturia BeatStep Pro will also have this feature.  You can also use CV to achieve similar results - depending on your gear - this is also a fun option."
synthesizers,39koh0,ranzee,3,Fri Jun 12 12:04:37 2015 UTC,"How it works is all down to your synth. If you have a synth that is multitimbral, then you can set it up in a multi mode, sometimes called a performance mode, where it can play several different patches (sounds) at the same time on different MIDI channels. Most workstation synths do this (Korg's Trinity, Triton, M1, Karma, Yamaha's Motifs, etc), and a lot of modern ROMpler type synths (Korg TR, N and X series, Roland's JVs) and virtual analogues (Novation Nova, Supernova, KS series, Nord Lead, Virus).   Many don't, however, so you need to check your manual or just tell us what synth you have because someone here will know!"

If you have the budget, consider the Octatrack, which is both a MIDI sequencer and a sampler. It can make a sequence on the synth, sample it, make another sequence, sample it, and  then layer both recorded sounds together. I use that it all the time to record interesting loops from my synth and them mix half a dozen of them together."

You also get a bonus audio interface right in the box. The keyboard is great as well. Sounds and plays way better than the Gaia IMHO (I've used both extensively).

synthesizers,39ju3o,selfinflikted,2,Fri Jun 12 16:46:07 2015 UTC,Strange how unanimous this opinion is. When I was looking at the guides to buying synths I detoured into some of the microKorg links and that guy said that instead of the microKorg as a first sytnh he would recommend the Ultranova or the Gaia.
synthesizers,39ju3o,selfinflikted,3,Fri Jun 12 18:15:11 2015 UTC,"Probably because of the interface, I'm assuming? The sound engine in the MicroKorg is leaps and bounds better than that of the Gaia (Gaia uses samples, Korg uses algorithms to generate waveforms in real time, plus it also has those DWGS waveforms). The Korg's interface is NOT conducive at all to sound design - if you want that, get the MS2000 - same sound engine as the MicroKorg, but has a great knobby interface. I really have nothing bad to say about the Ultranova, either, honestly."
synthesizers,39ju3o,selfinflikted,2,Fri Jun 12 18:54:14 2015 UTC,"Interface is a big deal for a beginner like me, so I could understand that. Sounds like the nova is all around better though."
synthesizers,39ju3o,burniemcburn,3,Fri Jun 12 19:32:52 2015 UTC,"Indeed. And if that's the case, I can recommend far better synths than the Ultranova. It's interface is good, but it isn't as good as the aforementioned MS2000. There are several synths with better ""beginner"" interfaces."

synthesizers,39ju3o,chthonist,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:32:09 2015 UTC,"The Ultranova you mean? Well, for starters, it's one of the best sounding VAs for the price point - definitely something you could grow into and keep around the studio for a good long while. Plus, while the interface isn't as knobby as I like, it's decent enough, but not everything is laid out nicely on the front panel. You wouldn't be going wrong with the Novation stuff."
synthesizers,39ju3o,Coralwood,2,Mon Jun 15 11:52:43 2015 UTC,I wouldn't shy away from the Microbrute if you like the sound. Unless you're going to be playing live the limitations it has are going to encourage you find novel ways around it. Monophonic? Record it twice and layers the sounds.
synthesizers,39ju3o,damien6,2,Fri Jun 12 08:37:13 2015 UTC,Ugh I used to have a fusion 8hd. I regret selling it. It had a surprisingly good fm synthesis interface and was a nice 88 key weighted controller with really good after touch.

synthesizers,39ju3o,damien6,2,Fri Jun 12 18:18:19 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed my Minibrute, though it's no swiss army knife. And on top of that, the Micro's lacking some of its features obviously. Anything by Novation is probably a sure-er bet as a first synth. I absolutely love my BSII & would recommend it over either 'Brute.

Anyway it looks like you and everyone else so far agree, and have swayed me towards the Ultra. Thanks for the info!"

Nobody can really give you any real advice on modules to get next without knowing what you like, but a Make Noise Maths is always a good way to start doing some weird stuff.

It's a track that was created in real time with an array of analog synthesizers, recorded and mastered on open-reel tape and cut directly to vinyl to maintain a 100% analog signal path for the entire project.    The gear used in the synthesizer studio included: Modulars : Roland System 700 (Drums), Moog series 900 (minor chords), Roland System 100 (sub basses, wind sfx, sirens), Arp 2500 (squelchy stabs), Buchla 100 series (SFX) Other Synths : modified x0xb0x (low bass) Korg MS-20 (other bass), Roland System 100 standalone synth (other bass), modified Korg Monotron Duo (other bass) FX : Roland Space Echo RE-501 (tape delay, chorus, spring reverb), Roland DC-30 (analog chorus-echo), Roland Dimension-D Analog Chorus Mixer : Tascam M308b  The mixed signal was recorded in a separate studio using a Studer mixer and tape machine. The premaster was then brought to a third studio where the tape was mastered using the following gear: Studer A812 tape machines ORAM BEQ Pro 24 mixing console API 550b EQ Tube-Tech CL 1b compressor Universal Audio Urei 1176Ln limiting amplifier Amek limiter Emt140 plate reverb  The master was then brought to a forth studio where it was run from tape through a few more pieces of outboard gear to finalize the signal and cut directly to a 12"" vinyl record.   This video was taken with a cell-phone camera at the various locations and the audio for the video was recorded and limited in a digital audio workstation in parallel to the analog signal flow."

synthesizers,39gxzi,the_cody,2,Thu Jun 11 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure if trolling?  There has been a lot of R&D into making digital sound like analog. There's no economically viable reason to try to emulate digital with analog.  This is sort of like saying: board games are great and all, but I don't see why we can't try to make board games more like video games. Sure, there are some turn based strategy games and some puzzle games that would work, but, it falls flat for things like first person shooters or any MMO style game. It's just not reasonable."
synthesizers,39gxzi,granttes,6,Thu Jun 11 23:28:52 2015 UTC,"of course there has been plenty of r&d for digital to make it sound like analog. digital is like a molding that can recreate anything so to speak. what i'm trying to get at is that people obsess over analog because of its ""realism"" and avoid using digital whenever possible, but for some reason this posting is attempting to recreate drum n bass music, which has been since its inception, created digitally. it's great for sure, but it's interesting to note that digital can sound just as good as analog and in my opinion, better most times. i've already gotten hell of course because someone downvoted me, but i think your analogy of board games and video games doesn't quite work for this. im just trying to say that digital can do it all plus more, and its hated by a lot of people for silly reasons."
synthesizers,39gxzi,the_cody,4,Fri Jun 12 00:08:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, no. That makes sense. Sorry, your initial post seemed a bit flippant, so I thought you might have been baiting. :D I agree that digital is fantastic!  The obsession over analog is a bit silly, I agree. I've gotten flack for saying this before, but, digital emulations of analog can never be better than analog. But, by that I mean that it's trying to emulate analog, and if it sounds better, it's not doing its job of properly emulating, and therefore not ""better."" Digital is best when it's allowed to be what it should be: insanely capable and diverse.  I do absolutely love hybrid synths. I love ugly digital oscillators running through very nice sounding analog filters. Now, for all intents and purposes, I really don't care if it's real analog or VA. I really loved the Venom, but I sold it because of the (incredibly stupid) decision to not let you create and save patches on the instrument (you have to use the editor software).  I don't know if you've seen the Sonic State video of the new Roland Aira EFX modules? But, damn, those are nice. And, the A/D is fast and high resolution (they play well with audio rate modulation).  Analog has charm in that it's easy to hack and repair. Components degrade over time, so the sound of the instrument changes over the years (not as much as, say, a nice acoustic instrument, but it still happens). For VCOs, there is some instability due to the environment you are in (again, like an acoustic instrument).  Yes, digital can do pretty much anything analog can do. But, it's still emulating what the analog realm is doing. So, by definition, is cannot be better when it's trying to emulate. I really wish the more digital synths would come out with interesting approaches. Even if they're just normal subtractive synths, give me a bunch of interesting filter types that cannot be done in the analog domain."
synthesizers,39gxzi,granttes,5,Fri Jun 12 00:23:57 2015 UTC,"I'm digressing a bit but I would love an easy to use physical digital FM synthesizer. I mean as easy as a simple subtractive synthesizer...where you can really grasp what you're doing by looking at sections just as analog has done. Like ableton's operator in a box with knobs and everything points to certain directions and gives options. I haven't played any FM keyboards, so I don't even know if they're easy or not. And yea, when I meant better towards digital, I was thinking of how it can go beyond the realm of analog into sounds that analog can't make. I also think....that digital can get to a point where you just can't tell the difference between it and analog. I have definitely seen those EFX modules and love my Aira equipment. And if I had the chance to own a giant analog modular, of course I would take it. If you think about it....analog and digital can be considered more of instruments in themselves because of the difference in timbre quality either can produce rather then looking at the qualities separately. Understanding the timbres of both increases your sonic palette. For instance...a Roland 909 kick is really precise in its timbre. I know that sound very well and haven't come across any other drum machine that can produce it just as well excluding emulators. So the fact that I know the timbre of the 909 kick or any of the 909 instruments will help me in my decision of choosing a certain type of instrument. I'm glad digital makes things cheap as well because if Roland hadn't released their Aira series, I would still be drooling over BOTH the 909s and 808s on ebay that go for stupid amounts of money."
synthesizers,39gxzi,the_cody,3,Fri Jun 12 00:41:18 2015 UTC,"ableton's operator in a box   That is quite literally what I was advocating for on the thread about the possible new Yamaha synth: http://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/39eg2o/there_may_be_a_new_fm_synth_coming_out_from_your/cs31fgw I would love to see that happen!!  I have a TX81Z ... and, I'm not normally bothered by menu diving. But, seriously, Yamaha's mid to late 80s instruments have the worst damned interfaces. The RX5 drum machine is what I've called ""double menu diving"" on many occasions. Granted, the Alpha Juno is super simple in comparison, but I've never had a problem programming it. I used to have a Kawai K5, and that is one hell of a complicated synth that has its complexity exacerbated by a piss poor UI.  Digital is pretty much already to the point where you cannot tell the difference between it and analog on a recording. But, it's not about that for me. I want digital to do its own thing (well, I also like that the emulations are so good and reasonably cheap, but, I think you get what I mean?). I want more resynthesis samplers like the Hartmann Neuron or V-Synth to come out. I want more wavetable synths to come out.  I'm not overly fond of ""analog"" drums. I love synthesized drums, but they don't need to be analog (or analog emulations) for me. The Korg ER-1 and Elektron Machinedrum are pretty much the best drum machines ever released, as far as I'm concerned. I've considered the LXR a few times, but the Machinedrum covers FM drums pretty well.  I did an in-person workshop here in Austin last month on synthesizing drum sounds and sampling them. I used a Minibrute and Octatrack. It didn't matter to me that I was using an analog synth. What mattered to me was that I was using a cheap-ish synth that's pretty popular. If the current popular synth in the sub-$500 range was digital, I'd have whatever it was and I would have used that for the workshop. The new Electribes fit this bill, and I've been thinking about getting the sampler (if it resamples?) just for such demos.  As for emulating the 909 and 808? If the TR-8 gets a 606 expansion, I'm sold! I tend to write electro, so 808 and 606 style sounds are where I start from. I usually go far off base once I get started, but they are a good reference point to begin with. Like, I love making hats and cymbals with square wave clusters and no noise (like the 606), and then using multiple filters to get the right sound."
synthesizers,39gxzi,granttes,2,Fri Jun 12 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of making cymbals and hats by clustering square waves and NO NOISE?! I always thought noise is basically what makes hats and cymbals and snares...I mean sure there are always other ways of making those sounds, but I figured that's how it was always done on average. I'm pretty damn sure that 606 will be released for the TR-8.  Talking about menu diving...I honestly don't like it. I have both a virus ti 2 polar and a machinedrum rytm. Both get very minimal use because of all the menus. When I had the Machinedrum SPS 1-UW, that was a breeze! Very little menu diving, BUT, the sounds weren't what I wanted. Ironically they sounded too digital for me hahahaha...in a way that I didn't like. It was unable to make kicks that I seeked, which was strange..  I never owned any of those workstation type keyboards. They just look like way too much is going on. What I would really love is just knobs and zero displays on a ridiculously strong digital synth. I literally want operator on a synth with no display lol...and I just looked at that other post and I agree completely with your top comment. But I doubt Yamaha will make a synth with no display. They're the ones that have been throwing in an ipad on a synth with bells and whistles. Too much flash. I need simple and straight to the point like a damn minimoog lol"
synthesizers,39gxzi,the_cody,2,Fri Jun 12 02:48:53 2015 UTC,"I had a Korg 01/W that I was given. It's the only workstation I've ever owned (or really used). It's one saving grace was the waveshaping (think very customizable distortion per oscillator). I really didn't like it at all. I did pick up iM1 on the iPad ... but was disappointed to find that the waveshaping didn't originate on the M1, but on the 01/W. Oh well.  The K5 I mentioned was an additive synth from Kawai where you had all kinds of crazy control 126 sine waves (harmonics) per voice of polyphony. But, there were all kinds of macros and craziness in the envelopes to contend with. It was just too complicated for something from 1987. They did the K5000 in the mid 90s, that I understand made the additive synthesis actually pretty easy to use (and there was a version with a knob cluster). But, used prices on those never get to the range where I think it'd be worth buying.  And, yeah. The 606 doesn't use noise in the hats (it might mix in some on the cymbal? I can't recall). The 808 and Boss DR-110 mix in noise with the square wave cluster though. The 110 is 4 square waves and the 808 / 606 is six square waves. They are tuned to non-harmonic frequencies. Then, they run through some high pass and band pass filters.  I like doing this with Ableton Analog (when I'm writing ITB, I pretty much just use Ableton Analog for everything, including drums). Here is a screencast of me making drums with Ableton Analog. I use the square wave cluster technique in Analog, because there is this great way to abuse the unison mode. If you set the unison to 100, but key follow for the oscillator to 0, it doesn't detune. So, you can use the key follow amount to create clusters, and with two oscillators, you get two clusters."

I can't speak directly to you're issues as I'm not sitting in front of it right now, but in general I think it does take some time to learn it's strengths, weaknesses, and sweet spots.  About the noise floor, you mentioned changing the drive type or amount. Try adjusting the noise and volume controls. That should help reduce the noise. Also, reducing the the oscillator amount in the osc matrix will give you a less aggressive sound.   If you're using any paraphonic oscillator types you also need to be careful of voice stealing, this can also lead to clicking noises in your patches.  Best of luck!"

Analog VCAs, envelopes and filters all have their little quirks. You learn to adjust envelopes to make up for it. I haven't got a Pulse 2 but the original Pulse and it can be super clicky with certain combinations of settings. Play around with attack and release times on the volume envelopes primarily and also filter envelopes, see if you can't reduce it or make it go away.

synthesizers,39hmkr,scottasin12343,18,Thu Jun 11 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"There are a number of ways to make an analog oscillator, but they generally fall into one of two categories. ""Saw core"" oscillators start with sawtooth wave. ""Triangle core"" oscillators start with a triangle wave. Converting from saw or triangle to a square is pretty easy.  The classic square waveshaper uses a device called a comparator. Comparators take an input voltage and compare it against a reference voltage to determine its output voltage. Comparators only send two output voltages: high and low. If the input voltage is higher than the reference voltage, it sends a high voltage. If the input voltage is lower than the reference voltage, it sends a low voltage.  Say you have a sawtooth wave with a voltage that goes smoothly between -5v and 5v. You can use that sawtooth wave as the input to a comparator with a reference voltage of 0v.   When the sawtooth voltage is less that 0v, the comparator will send its low voltage of -5v. When the sawtooth voltage is greater than 0v, the comparator will send its high voltage of 5v.   Since the saw is below 0v half the time and above 0v half the time, the output wave alternates equally between -5v and 5v–a square wave.

synthesizers,39hmkr,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:56:53 2015 UTC,I've got a good background in analog circuits but not so much in DSP... Why would you use reverse FFT to create a square wave when you can just generate it by simply forcing levels to -V or +V ?
synthesizers,39hmkr,Jaalmakadamia,5,Fri Jun 12 07:44:55 2015 UTC,"The .gif really only describes additive synthesis; it's not done that way in most synths. The problem with making a trivial square wave (as you're describing) in discrete time (i.e. any time you're using DSP) is that the discontinuities are quantized to the nearest sample. This results in horrible aliasing. The most popular solution is to find the sub-sample location of the discontinuity and substitute it with a pre-calculated band-limited transition. MinBLEP is the most widely used variant of that.  The inverse FFT approach is usually used to generate multiple bandlimited stored waveforms that are mapped across the keyboard. The waveforms are tabularized, so it isn't calculated in real time.   The Kawai additive synths (K5, K5000) synthesize the waveforms this way on the fly, but I think they're calculated at a relatively slow rate, written to a double buffer and smoothly crossfaded together. So it's not really that intensive this way either; I believe Kawai were doing this in digital organs (the DX800) in 1981."
synthesizers,39hmkr,mierscheid,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:05:58 2015 UTC,Ok I see so smoothing the wave digitally so that it's closer to its analog counterpart?  thanks!
synthesizers,39hmkr,Jaalmakadamia,2,Fri Jun 12 15:08:09 2015 UTC,Another way of thinking about it is that a trivially synthesized square wave is equivalent to a trivially sampled analog square wave (i.e. with no filtering before sampling). Using bandlimited transitions or bandlimited stored waveforms is closer to a properly sampled analog square wave.
synthesizers,39hmkr,mierscheid,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:51:28 2015 UTC,"You are almost never synthesizing a ""pure"" square wave in a digital synth.

synthesizers,39hmkr,CompuFart,3,Sat Jun 13 03:24:07 2015 UTC,This is a process called a Fourier Transformation. To put it simple this is additive synthesis where a waveform is constructed by the addition of many sine waves. Quite a few digital synthesizers have this form of synthesis as an option.
synthesizers,39hmkr,Roykeru,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:39:34 2015 UTC,"Fourier transform:       The Fourier transform decomposes a function of time (e.g., a signal) into the frequencies that make it up, similarly to how a musical chord can be expressed as the amplitude (or loudness) of its constituent notes. The Fourier transform of a function of time itself is a complex-valued function of frequency, whose absolute value represents the amount of that frequency present in the original function, and whose complex argument is the phase offset of the basic sinusoid in that frequency. The Fourier transform is called the frequency domain representation of the original signal. The term Fourier transform refers to both the frequency domain representation and the mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of time. The Fourier transform is not limited to functions of time, but in order to have a unified language, the domain of the original function is commonly referred to as the time domain. For many functions of practical interest one can define an operation that reverses this: the inverse Fourier transformation, also called Fourier synthesis, of a frequency domain representation combines the contributions of all the different frequencies to recover the original function of time.

synthesizers,39hmkr,autowikibot,3,Thu Jun 11 21:39:53 2015 UTC,"Time to shine with my master degree in signal processing!!  As others have said, you start from some arbitrary oscillator, based on charge/discharge of capacitors. Capacitors charge and discharge in exponential ways, so you end up with a weird waveform that looks like this:  http://secure.tutorsglobe.com/CMSImages/225_Multivibrator%20Homework%20Help%203.jpg  Now, you want to turn that into a square. It can be done with a comparator: if voltage is above 0, output +V else output -V.  Or you can just amplify that signal until it overdrives whatever transistor/opamp is doing the amplification. That will ""squarify"" the wave. There you go, square!  Once you have a square, how about making triangles? it's would be done with an integrator circuit, taking the square as an input. Remember differentials in high school math class? an integrator does the opposite of differentiation. That means it will find the signal whose differential is a square.  And that would be... yes! a triangle!!  Integrator is an op-amp based circuit, google-image it for the schematics.  Now you have an oscillator circuit which can make squares and triangles! awesome! but we all know that to make the world famous ""init"" patch, we need a sawtooth.  Sawtooth is tricker. You'll need a ramp circuit (i.e. a circuit that outputs a ever increasing voltage, for example a charging capacitor) and a ramp reset that resets the ramp to it's lowest voltage. It can be done by short-circuiting the capacitor.  Then you just wire this ramp circuit so that it resets every two-times your square wave crosses zero (you detect zero crossings with a comparator and you count them with a flip-flop circuit).  Tada!! Your ramp will charge, and reset to minimum in sync with yous square. Now you have a sawtooth!  Sine is difficult, go make one with your resonating filter.  The animation you showed is about how you can reconstruct a square wave by summing some elementary sine waves... Technically it could be done in the analog domain (and here's a really ASTONISHING example of such analog fourrier analyzer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAsM30MAHLg ), but most of the time you've got simpler tools. Seriously though, if you are interested in that topic, watch the video above and all the series where they explain this machine, it's really super cool."

synthesizers,39hmkr,Jaalmakadamia,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:34:16 2015 UTC,"As others have said, you start from some arbitrary oscillator, based on charge/discharge of capacitors. Capacitors charge and discharge in exponential ways, so you end up with a weird waveform that looks like this:   You don't see exponential charging/discharging in VCOs. They use integrators; a constant current is forced through the capacitor, resulting in a linear increase or decrease in voltage. This is where the saw or triangle comes from; it's not derived from a square wave.   Once you have a square, how about making triangles? it's would be done with an integrator circuit   A triangle wave is made from either a triangle core VCO or derived from the sawtooth by rectifying it. The problem with creating a triangle from a square wave is that the triangle's amplitude is inversely proportional to frequency. This is no good in a synth, and modifying the circuit to correct it is unnecessarily complicated.   Sawtooth is tricker. You'll need a ramp circuit (i.e. a circuit that outputs a ever increasing voltage, for example a charging capacitor) and a ramp reset that resets the ramp to it's lowest voltage. It can be done by short-circuiting the capacitor.   This is done in DCO-based synths. A control voltage is needed so that the sawtooth amplitude is consistent over frequency.   Sine is difficult, go make one with your resonating filter.   They're made by distorting a triangle wave using diodes or overdriving an OTA (operational transconductance amplifier). Sine waveforms in synth VCOs are very crude."

synthesizers,39hmkr,geekygenius,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:26:17 2015 UTC,"Analog oscillators typicslly works by gradually filling up a a capacitor with current through a resistor. The smaller the resistor and capacitor the higher the frequency. When the voltage over the capacitor reaches a certain level it triggers a switch that empties the capacitor. This process is repeated and creates a saw wave.   You then add some binary logic that meassures the voltage level of the saw wave. If it is higher than the middle level, it is on, if it is lower than the middle level, it is off. Resulting in a square wave with the same frequency as the saw.  This is a very simple example, and not all oscillators use a saw as the base."

Seriously, their last innovative product was the moog guitar, and that was discontinued a few years ago. They've said themselves that the reason they discontinue products is because they can no longer source components because a few thousand chips for synths is not enough to keep fabs running. Seems like a poor, niche business model while you have others killing it by innovating and using modern technology.   I like analog as much as the next guy, but I think it's a shame how much people prize things that are decades outdated when there are newer and more exciting alternatives. On top of that there is a massive prosumer market growing and one that wants software that does something new.

We've seen with Apple that people are willing to pay for thoughtful design."
synthesizers,39cw4z,zomgw00t,3,Thu Jun 11 05:20:43 2015 UTC,"Moog's seems somewhat similar to Harley-Davidson; Harley-Davidson motorcycles are more expensive than most comparable bikes from Japanese manufacturers and their technology and performance has been lagging behind for decades. However, Harley Davidson is still an very popular brand with a massive base of loyal customers. The almost mythic concept of what riding a Harley-Davidson means is an important part of the company's success. While synthesizers are a niche market compared to motorcycles, the idea of the Moog synthesizer is still powerful and, if managed properly, should continue to be powerful. I would even argue that releasing a synthesizer or piece of software that's particularly innovative would be harmful to the Moog brand. It's sort of a way for the brand to say, ""We already make the ideal synth and you know it."""
synthesizers,39cw4z,mrswanker,2,Thu Jun 11 11:58:01 2015 UTC,"I was willing to let a lot of this just be difference in opinion, but comparing Moog's effect work to EHX is kind of bullshit. As someone who has pretty extensively used both EHX and Moog effects to record and play out, EHX's build quality is child's play when put up next to the Moogerfooger line.   EDIT: Immediately after posting this, I realized that you were probably comparing EHX to the newer Minifoogers, which is actually a pretty fair comparison in that price range."

Look at Korg. Look at Arturia, a company that ONLY made software, now selling the MiniBrute and MicroBrute. Analog synths had their biggest showing in years, probably even decades, at this last NAMM. I mean, for christ's sake, they reissued the ARP Odyssey.  Boutique analog gear is in right now. Hell, analog everything is very popular right now compared to where it used to be.  Mind you, for awhile, Moog didn't really exist. Moog released a lot of products, flopped, and then Bob Moog fought to get his name back while running Big Briar.  Moog continues to exist because they make extremely high quality analog synthesizers. The Sub37 is a phenomenal synth with incredible routing, intuitiveness, and build quality, at practically the same cost of what the original Little Phatty was priced."

Though I do think it will decrease the chances of the company doing anything that will make it go broke.   I'm not too fussed about it. Business organization is a matter of choices. There are three ways a business has to pay for doing things like re-tooling:    By issuing shares, that is, giving more people a chance to buy a bit of the business and participate in the profits, or By borrowing money, whether at a bank or on the bond market, or Straight cash, homie.   Straight cash is kind of hard to come by, since it's what's left over after everybody that needs to get paid gets paid. You might not have enough of that kicking around to retool, or expand production, or whatever it is you need to raise money to do.  That leaves issuing shares or borrowing money. If interest rates are low, borrowing money can be really profitable. Ideally, the cost of the borrowing (interest) will be less than the profit the borrowed money helps you haul in.   But if interest rates go up, it becomes more expensive to borrow money. That's when you might want to consider issuing more shares. This amounts to convincing people that, if they give you money today, they will have a piece of a more profitable or valuable company.  But if your shareholders don't want to dilute their interest, they may not want to issue more shares. So you might be stuck.  Again, no right or wrong about it. It's just a choice, with certain practical consequences. If it helps you recruit and retain skilled people, maybe that's more valuable to you.   The biggest problem is when shareholders/employees get to liking the way things are right now and stop thinking about making new/interesting things to meet market demand. The current management has been pretty good about new product development, but that's something to watch, I guess."

A little bit of work programming a MIDI controller isn't a big hindrance - compared to parting with the money for a completely new synth.

The very thought of programming the controller is enough to kill the mood for me.   If my primary synth were FM, then I would think nothing of it, of course. But I've got analog subtractive synths sitting on my desk, and they're ready for me all the time, at a moment's notice. I don't have to worry about what CC or what channel my modular stuff is on: the voltage goes up or down, and there it is.

Computers are great because they can do so much and do it incredibly well. But, certain dedicated pieces of hardware are always going to be a better experience.

synthesizers,39eg2o,ScrubNickle,3,Thu Jun 11 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"The hardbound book is an acoustic instrument in this analogy. :D  Synths, like ebook readers, are relatively new dedicated technology.  I actually prefer reading on a Kindle Paperwhite to a paper book. It's lightweight, has a built-in light, runs for very long periods of time without recharging (this is VS a computer ... oops), I can quickly purchase new content, I can make notes that I can quickly reference without digging out another book and it's really easier on my eyes (since I don't have to have the whole room lit up).  And, really, I'm still advocating for technology here. I think a computer is a really amazing general purpose device. It does a lot of different things and does some of those things incredibly well (better than anything else we have). But, the interface isn't all that amazing, even with programmable controllers.  I want to say that the reason for that is the ""paradox of choice"" (check out this TED talk). The computer synth has so many options and we want access to all those options, but the controller makes you choose the options you have access to. I think the modular synth world is very much in this, but, you do have access to all the choices right in front of you ... but then there are always more and more modules.  The dedicated hardware is limited when compared to software. And, in those limitations, you have to trust the engineers decided the best limitations to work within. A bad product has miscalculated limitations.  Now, that hardbound book is even more limited than an ebook reader. No engineer went to meetings to decide what features to limit on the book (the publishers and editors limits formats and lengths, but that's not really a ""feature"" in this context)."

Not to mention the flawed but still great sounding 200 series grooveboxes and the awesome EX5 workstation.   Personally, I'd like to see a modern take on FM synthesis, with a more up to date amount of modulation possibilities (3 or 4 freely assignable LFOs for instance), a control surface full of knobs and sliders, and an analogue filter to provide real resonance.   Other favourite ideas would be; a long overdue sequel to the AN1x; a fully analogue but much more modern and up to date CS poly - there are more monosynths out there right now than you can shake a stick at, so a relatively cheap (sub £1000) poly with those CS filters would definitely put Yamaha firmly back on the map for synthesisers."

This guy has some good examples of it in action: https://soundcloud.com/jean-edouard/audibleworlds-interview-kyma https://soundcloud.com/jean-edouard/kyma-selected-sound-edits  Their current basic model is just under 3000 US dollars.

synthesizers,39fr4d,Nilesong,8,Thu Jun 11 14:32:04 2015 UTC,"In that case, seeing as you have the digital world covered extensively, I'd suggest getting 3 grand worth of modular stuff, although you'll need to research that a bit. I remember reading a post from the Plan B modular mailing list years ago from a guy who did sound design for the first Michael Bay Transformer film: ""When you see the film [Transformers] you'll be hearing a lot of distinct bass sounds. The main deep and dirty bass. A basic patch on my modular. For those that are interested is goes like this. 2xPlan B OSC (square/saw) into a doepfer phaser - the big one - out into a cwejman DMF-2 (a+b) 32dbx2 LPF. One side of the AB slightly higher than the other. ADSR into filter - adjust to taste. Overdrive the filter on one side, A or B, it end up being mono anyway, and one side keep it really low so you can't tell it's distorted. Feed into cwejman VCA2P that has a separate ADSR than the filter. And that's it. There's the 'Transformer's' Bass sound. So when you see the movie and wonder what the fuck that sound is, that's it. The only variation is some FM synthisis using Cynthia's Zero Osc and sometimes using a doepfer waveshaper.  All of this goes into my shadow hills pre/e27/560eq/and 1968 drawmer comp, just for more thickness and punch.  That's the only trick. The rest is layering with other sounds to add variation. Sounds from the neuron & nuke (waveguitar in particular)  Another thing to be sure of when getting a big cutting bass sound. Roll off your bass @ 50hz. You can add it later with EQ if you really need it. If there is a lot happening musically, you'll need the headroom.""      Just goes to show how powerful modular can be in the world of sound design. If you go with a Prophet 6 you'll end up with a great synth probably (I haven't tried it yet), but you'll be limited by its hardwired architecture. There's a bit of scope for modulation etc, but nothing compared to a modular system.      Maybe check out a Serge modular panel, the Animal is a good starting point, or a Cwejman S1 MK2 if you can find one."

synthesizers,39eyw1,anderson303,6,Thu Jun 11 07:27:41 2015 UTC,"Sure. You'll want a low fundamental note in there in addition to white noise. I like to add a falling pitch envelope. (Set FM to ADSR with no attack, no sustain and set decay, release to taste depending how punchy you want it.) You can set the filter to self oscillate a bit for a snare ring as well, but that can kill the lower frequencies. A real snare can be pretty dissonant so maybe use the second oscillator with a pitch bend as well but starting at a different pitch. I prefer square waves.   Luckily Pitch and Amp can both use the same ADSR."

synthesizers,39eeib,Jordan_Rago,3,Thu Jun 11 04:32:20 2015 UTC,"I would say that it all depends on the piece of hardware, and not just the fact that it has a tube in it. There's a lot of mediocre hardware out there with vacuum tubes in them, and one of the most popular and highly rated mic pre-amps in the high end studio world, the Neve 1073, is a solid state one. So I'd personally rate each piece of hardware by its own merits, rather than just the type of components it uses.  That said, just for a nerdy laugh I went to the Vintage King website and counted how many of the 44 channel strips they have for sale (http://vintageking.com/outboard/preamps/channel-strips?limit=all) have tubes in them, and 22 of them have tubes in them. So obviously a lot of people like tubes in things!  All my preamps are solid state but I've got a Thermionic Culture Culture Vulture, a dual channel tube distortion unit which I think utilises the tube components very well as it sounds really great on pretty much everything I put through it. I can get mild saturation that makes the bass sound bigger, right up to intense distortion that wouldn't sound out of place at a Merzbow concert. I think it's a great example of tubes being put to good use, rather than as a bit of a gimmick like they were on the Korg ESX."

Use solder 0.5mm (and no bigger). Pliers, Cutters, some kind of PCB holder, a magnifying glass, a good LED light, screwdrivers, small socket set, sharp knife, anti-static wrist band, heat sink and gun, wire, electrical tape, solder sucker/wick etc etc.  2 - No, don't use compressed air from a compressor. Use a computer/electronics dust spray can. These are safe to spray on electronic circuits.  3 - turn things off at the power - and let the caps near the power supplies cool down. Usually an hour is safe - but that depends on the voltages and the size of the caps and transformer.  4 - The internet. Local online used buy and sell sites are a great place to find used keys. Most of Roland's keys are interchangeable - so do some research and save your money."

You may have to take more than just the key you need to replace out to get it out, but it's a pretty straightforward job. Beyond that, my most used tools are a multimeter, a soldering and desoldering iron, a set of tiny screwdrivers and a few normal ones, wire strippers, wire cutters, and needle nosed pliers.  If you use whatever compressed air you have that has moisture in it just make sure the board is dry before you turn it back on. I use my air compressor for this regularly, it's not a big deal as long as you pay attention.  Like others have said, the big capacitors in the power supply can hold a charge, so don't lick them. They can be discharged with a resistor like previously mentioned.  Spare parts come from a variety of places. www.vintageplanet.nl has a lot of hard to find stuff and they are reliable.

synthesizers,39ewen,ranzee,2,Thu Jun 11 08:41:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know about sounding totally different; that's something you can say about an Odyssey and a Moog, but part of the charm of the Bass Station 2 is it's relative lack of character. It can do Moogy sounds but never quite as distinctively as a Moog; it can do Rolandy sounds but never quite as well as a Roland. If OP was trying to decide whether to sell an Odyssey or an MS20 I'd agree with you as they have sounds that live in a very different sonic place than a Moog; but a BS2, or even a Pro One? Nah, as a synthead you or I may hear a few subtle differences between them but really they have so much crossover with the Moog that it's just obsessive collecting rather than practicality that would make you hang on to those."
synthesizers,39ewen,t0xicd0g,6,Thu Jun 11 09:03:42 2015 UTC,"I find it quite hard to make tb-303 sounds on the sub 37, but not very hard at all on the BSII. It's actually the only reason I'm still holding onto the BSII - that imitation tb303-filter does the job well. As an example, the intro sound from luisine's Another Tomorrow is something I have a lot of difficulty getting on the Moog, but takes 3 seconds on the bsII. In the same vein, I have a tough time getting nearly as sexy an outrun-style drone on the BSII compared to the Moog."

synthesizers,39ewen,t0xicd0g,2,Thu Jun 11 12:30:14 2015 UTC,"We'll agree to disagree then.  The BS2 doesn't need to be a Moog, Roland or Korg MS-20 - it is a Novation Bass Station - it has its own identity."
synthesizers,39ewen,ranzee,4,Thu Jun 11 09:24:49 2015 UTC,"Well no, that's kind of the point I was trying to make. It isn't really a very distinctive voice as a synthesiser, which isa blessing when making unobtrusive sounds that don't scream MOOG or ARP when they hit a mix, but a curse in that it doesn't have a 'sound' of its own, particularly. At best you could say it sounds more like a Roland. I'm not knocking it, but sometimes you have to look beyond the ""it's my synth and I love it"" and be a bit more objective when it comes to populating your studio, otherwise you end up like the dude who posted pics of his 'Red corner' of his studio on Facebook last year; between two racks he had a Nord Lead 1, 2, 3, 4, 2x and A1. The only one of these that sounds or does anything radically different is the 3; the 2 is just a 1 with more DSP power for better polyphony; the 4 is a more sophisticated version of the 2, the 2x is basically a souped-up 2, and the A1 is a souped up 4. He could basically have just the A1 and the 3 and sell the rest for hundreds and hundreds of pounds, but to him, that all sounded different. To me, he crossed the line into slightly crazy obsessive collector territory.   Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather have a broad range of sounds in my studio than a bunch of synths that all make slight variations on the same sounds."

At best you could say it sounds more like a Roland.   That bit.  We have different opinions - so I'm not trying to be argumentative. However, I feel the BS2 sounds amazing. It definitely has its own distinctive sound. I actually get quite sick of people saying that it sounds like Roland, or tries to be a Moog and fails. The flexibility of this synth is that you can get it to sound ""like"" these. But you can do this kind of trick with many analogs. I've had my Minibrute sound like a VCS3, the BS2 sound like an ARP 2600 and so on. This only happens to people who don't have these synths and need to recreate the sounds. However, if you go to the roots of the BS2 - it is based on the original Bass Station. You can get all the original patches, and that was Novation's goal. Not only this, but to add a few other tricks - like the acid filter (which was a little lackluster in truth).   Novation wanted this synth to be an entry level for many - and the fact that it can mimic the great vintage synths like an SH-101 or a Moog Mini - adds to the attraction.  So I can understand that many feel disappointed with it. But those who have really explored it will discover some amazing modulation features and timbre possibilities. I've had it sounding like an Elka Synthex (with the aid of a Boss Chorus pedal). The noise and ring mod with distortion and overdrive can get some really crazy sounds - unlike anything else.  To me this is the beauty of this synth - it isn't a one-trick pony. The only thing it lacks is CV."
synthesizers,39ewen,ranzee,3,Thu Jun 11 13:58:25 2015 UTC,"Everything you just said I agree with; and I repeat what I said that you disagreed with; the Bass Station 2 does not have a particular voice or sound of it's own, it is a jack of all trades that sits in a mix without drawing attention to it, sometimes sounding Moogish, sometimes Oberheimy, sometimes like a 303, but it never sounds like a BS2, because it is not that distinctive a voice. You and I are saying the same thing but seeing it from different angles. My point is, if you have a Sub37 then it will likely fill the role of analogue mono much better than a BS2, which just treads mostly the same ground with little to bring it out from under the shadow of the Moog. You say don't get rid of it because it sounds a bit like everything.  I think you need to remember that most analogue monosynths have about 95% overlap in the sort of sounds they make, and that remaining 5% is stuff like brassy Oberheim filters, overdriven, throbbing Moogs, sharp, nasal Odysseys, Squawking 303s. The Bass Station 2 sits firmly in that 95%, dipping about 1% of it's toes in the 303 sound with the acid filter. Other than that, the Sub37 does pretty much everything it does. So my argument is, if it sounds like everything, and you have another synth that sounds like everything but with that extra 5% on top, why keep the BS2?"
synthesizers,39ewen,t0xicd0g,-1,Thu Jun 11 14:59:30 2015 UTC,"I think we sit at opposite ends to a similar viewpoint - but perhaps, let me show you with an example - here's a track I did that is pretty much just the BS2:  https://soundcloud.com/ranzee/the-apology"

synthesizers,39ewen,riley212,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:53:32 2015 UTC,"I would keep it for a little bit if you aren't hurting for cash - it has some things that the Moog doesn't, like a sub osc with different wave forms, sine waves, a ring-mod and a multi-mode filter. IMHO it would be a nice companion to the Moog when playing live or recordings."

I recorded a sustained drone for a few minutes on each of the 4 tracks, each in a different key from the Audiothingies P6. When I play back the cassette, I can fade each track in and out, bringing in the different keys, playing it like a synth. Why do all that when you could just play the synth? There's just an odd warmness and saturation with cassettes that makes it sound great! Also running it through an OBNE Black Fountain Delay.

synthesizers,39axll,TheUglyHobo,2,Wed Jun 10 20:47:05 2015 UTC,"I actually just purchase mine from Delta Media. They run $6/ea, but you can get upto 6min on one cassette. I choose to use 1min cassettes because it keeps me from hashing out whole songs in the duration of a 3-minute or 6-minute loop and provides a valuable restriction on time. Otherwise I'd be performing 10-15min tracks. Mind you, any looping cassette (I believe) will have a little gap no matter what.  To cope with that, I usually record a track, fading it in at the start, and then fade it before the loop restarts. I then record other tracks the same way, except spaced out so that the gaps occur at different times and there's continuous sound available even as the tracks fade in and out. Mix the tracks live and run them through delays/verbs/sometimes-fuzzboxes, and there ya go.  I actually started doing this because I got booked for a live ""improvisational"" electronic set at a record store in my city, and at the time, the only material I had was on guitar, or rather old electronic drone material. I wanted to branch out and develop a way to do live electronic music with a very minimal set-up and pretty much ""in-the-box"", but while leaving some element of improvisation. I already had been using a 424 for sometime as a way to mangle digital recordings...so I figured I would record several looping cassettes using my various analog synths and perform live manipulation and mixing of them."

synthesizers,39blm6,Mememan305,7,Wed Jun 10 17:37:23 2015 UTC,"The Zoom R16 is my recommendation and one I've made a few times.  Here are the main pros as I see them:  1) It's affordable 2) It's a standalone 8-in, 16-track recorder 3) It records to SD card (no drive noise) 4) You can move the track and mix wavs straight off the card into a DAW 5) It's an 8-in USB audio interface 6) It's a USB control surface 7) It runs on USB power 8) It can run on batteries 9) It has built-in mics for basic lo-fi / field recording 10) It has decent (not awesome) insert / send effects and EQ  The only thing I don't really like about it is that it lacks MIDI ports for sync - but I've never had enormous luck with that on recorders anyway. For everything else, I think it's a killer unit.  As with everything else, though, it depends what you want to do with it. I like working without a PC, just a few synced-up units and the Zoom. It's not great for editing - but you can transfer to a DAW really easily for that. Overdubbing works fine, recording 8 tracks at once works fine, the USB audio interface works fine. A real all-rounder.  I also have a Yamaha AW16G. That's more of a complete solution - you can edit on it, for a start, and it has MIDI and more comprehensive setup / routing options. It also has two XLR inputs. But using it is a bit more involved and it uses a hard drive, so it's not as beautifully silent as the Zoom, or as portable. Can be found cheap these days, though, and offers a lot for the price. Personally I prefer the SD card approach in general.  I'm happy to answer questions about the Zoom or AW16G. I previously owned a Roland VSS880EX, which was great in terms of features and had very good effects. Again, a bit of a noisy beast. All these hard drive recorders are getting on a bit now, and can be fussy about accepting replacement drives - another advantage of SD cards."

I don't think I ever got it working on the Yamaha due to a general lack of compatible equipment - MTC vs MMC and so on. It was never really a priority for me, but I can try it again and see how it works.  I did get it working on the Roland VS, synced to an MPC that was diving everything else. I'm sure the Yamaha will do it if I get the right combo... it also has a basic sampler / sequencer, but I've never really tried that either."

I record 8 tracks at a time sometimes and I've not had any problems. It records to SD so you can easily get the files into your daw for mixing/editing. You can overdub, punch in/out(with automatic in/out points), records new takes each time, however you like. You can loop sections of tracks and have them looping while recording to another track. The r24 is also a sampler and you can use the buttons at the bottom to trigger loops and samples. It even has a few effects and a mastering/compressor/etc setup on the main so you can do stereo mix downs. It can almost replace a daw except for very fine editing and use of plugins. You could easily cut decent demos of yourself or a band with just an R24."
synthesizers,39blm6,extuber,3,Wed Jun 10 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"Compared to a DAW, they're great- no computer distraction, as you said, as well as generally alleviating some of the more frustrating issues with computer based DAWs: driver conflicts, upgrades that break stuff, latency, etc. Most of this stuff will be used though.   Cassette 4 tracks/8 tracks are pretty fun. For electronic stuff where it's all direct they sound surprisingly good (it's trying to get like, rock drums that reveals the low fi, IMO). Reel machines, such as those from Otari, Fostex and Tascam are the next step up. Most of the indie music done in the 80s and 90s were cut to these kinds of decks and with a bit of care and planning they can sound excellent. Tape is more expensive than cassette, and sometimes spare parts can be hard to find depending on the model. In working shape though, these are solid machines.   Digital multitrackers will give you some of the features of a computer DAW without much of the headache, but a lot of times setting them up or doing edits is a bit like the cliche of ""painting a room through a keyhole"" due to the lack of mouse/keyboard/big screen, although some of the top end HW DAWs do allow this. I had a Yamaha AW2400 which, frankly, was a pretty amazing machine. It was built extremely well, sounded great, had automation and motorized faders, decent dynamics/eq/FX, and generated its own MIDI clock, so you could just layer things down one at a time all synced to the Yammy's internal clock. I think it had USB too for track export. Often these older hard disk recorders have weird deals though, like they require some VERY SPECIFIC 40 GB hard drive that you'll have to try and hunt down as a replacement or something like that. But overall it's a solid choice and these kinds of machines are usually really cheap.   A lot of my favorite records applicable to this sub were just recorded to 2 track DAT, all sequenced and mixed down in real time. I really admire this particular way of working, but of course also like the ability to add overdubs etc on top. I'm not sure it would totally work for you, but I use a Tascam DR-40 for stuff I'm not doing in renoise. It's a portable recorder with built in mics and can record 24/96 on SD cards. It has balanced ins and mic pres in addition to the internal mics. Besides being a great and small 2 track deck, it can do sound on sound overdubbing, not unlike a looper pedal or something. It saves each iteration as it's own mixed file so you can go back if you mess up or change your mind. I find this an extremely direct and intuitive way to work for throwing things down quickly and building up arrangements without getting bogged down in channel settings and input routings. Totally check one of those out if that sounds helpful to you."

synthesizers,39adap,CompuFart,2,Wed Jun 10 19:02:32 2015 UTC,"What do you think the differences might be down to? As you said, the DAC in a DX7 is quite primitive compared to modern DACs. Aside from that, and correct me if I'm wrong, but digital circuitry can be identically emulated through code. If a DI output could be sourced from a DX7, shouldn't the resulting signal be identical to a software version? The only other difference I can imagine, in the real world, would be by using a less-than-perfect DX7 whose contact points and output posts had suffered corrosion and had a resulting change in voltage or/and impedance.     edit: You said you think there are some unknowns within the DX7. This is not realistic. The circuitry within is extremely well understood. And extremely basic by modern standards. A digital signal is a digital signal. Boolean logic is the same in circuitry and software. Am I missing something? It's been 20 years since I got my Audio Tech BSc.."
synthesizers,39adap,scramtek,6,Wed Jun 10 21:29:17 2015 UTC,"While it's possible for any computer to produce exactly the same results as any other, reverse engineering can be quite expensive and difficult.   As Yamaha made specific dedicated custom LSI chips for the digital side, rather than using a general purpose DSP, they may be using odd precision and rounding at different places in the calculations. The main reason being so they could make the chips cheaply as possible using as little die space as possible. As it's a musical instrument, precision doesn't matter in the same way it would in a general purpose computer. It's not an ideal FM implementation, it's the one they could create to meet the product's price target.  There isn't really software in a DX7 that can be recompiled on another computer, as much of it is done at a gate level.  Sometimes when recreating these kind of devices, programmers need to create their own code even for simple operations such as addition! This is time consuming to write, and very slow compared to using the CPUs inbuilt functions.  So a softsynth version like FM8 will sound similar, but there will probably be corner cases where the DX7 will sound different, particularly as FM algorithms tend to emphasise small changes when there is a long chain of carriers and modulators."
synthesizers,39adap,termites2,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:50:24 2015 UTC,TIL about the DX7. Fascinating. Thanks for the info.
synthesizers,39adap,scramtek,3,Thu Jun 11 08:28:49 2015 UTC,"It is certainly possible to emulate the digital circuitry. I'm not aware of any publicly available info on de-encapsulated dx7 chips. You can find info online about the tables in other Yamaha FM chips. /u/termites2 gives a good overview.  If you want to read up on this, the best source of information is probably the gearslutz member ""acreil"", as well as the ""music synthesizer for android""."
synthesizers,39adap,CompuFart,6,Thu Jun 11 03:43:11 2015 UTC,"If you want to read up on this, the best source of information is probably the gearslutz member ""acreil""   That's me, thanks. The main aspects of the DX7 that are typically different from other FM implementations are the lookup table resolution and interpolation, DAC and envelopes. The sample rate is also nonstandard (49096 Hz).  The limited lookup table resolution adds high harmonics and noise, and reduces the envelope resolution. Depending on how the patch is programmed, this can be highly audible. The effects are stronger in the OPP and OPL chips (DX100, FB01, Sound Blaster, PSS-570, etc.), as well as the original GS-1 and GS-2 models, as the table resolution is lower.   The DX7's DAC also makes things significantly more noisy, and this seems to vary from unit to unit. The DX7 II models improve the DAC. The difference actually isn't as big as is often assumed.   Depending on the patch, the combined effects of the lookup tables and DAC can make the DX7 sound sort of bright and airy, as though it's been run through an exciter. If this is how you expect FM to sound, other implementations may sound disappointingly dull, even though they're mathematically more correct.  The shape of the envelope attacks is also unusual, and the envelopes can behave very strangely in certain situations. This behavior isn't necessarily desirable, but it's important for correct patch translation."

synthesizers,399tsa,rotoshake,6,Wed Jun 10 07:57:42 2015 UTC,"I was hoping that the new one would be a significant upgrade in functionality   Most of the complaints I see directed at the new Electribe Sampler are from people comparing it to the last model. I had an ESX years ago, and I think the new one improves on a number of things, although some of your complaints are valid. There's definitely room for improvement in sample management. I just got mine last night and played with it for about two hours. It does seem a bit ""stripped down"" but IMO that's not necessarily a bad thing (except in the case of sample management). I'll give more thoughts about it once I've played with it more but so far so good, IMO.   I formatted an SD card and loaded a bunch of my custom samples on it. The import menu on the Electribe only seems to allow loading of one file at a time, and it also makes you scroll down to the next sample every time (starting at the first one). Loading more than a handful of samples has proven tedious.   Yeah, this kinda sucks. It doesn't take forever to do load a sample, but it seems a bit odd that they don't have ""Import All Samples"" (especially because they do have ""Export All Samples"") - I imagine a firmware update will improve this. Probably runs into an error with trying to load more samples than it can handle so they left it out.   After loading 4 samples (granted some were fairly large pre-recorded basslines), I promptly received a ""Memory Full"" message.   Delete the factory samples to free up space. A user has already created a ""blank"" template so you don't have to do it one by one. Check this thread.   The unit is full to the brim of total garbage dubstep and trap samples that I don't want anything to do with, but there's no easy way to erase them all to make room for my stuff. You have to go through and erase each one individually in another tedious process. (also I'm not exactly sure if this is freeing up memory as the samples can always be re-loaded with a factory reset).   See the above link to free up space. I can't say I'm surprised that a sampler came loaded with samples of music that the kids like these days, though.   There seems to be no way of chaining together patterns into songs..or at least theres nothing about it in the sad-excuse for a manual. This is the dealbreaker for me as it makes using the unit as live accompaniment impossible. (Don't tell me to just use a laptop).   They've replaced this with the ""Event Recorder"", although I'm not sure if it's really a proper replacement. Haven't tried it yet. Did you not know this before buying it?   The manual seems like a quick-start type deal. Where is the full documentation?   The parameter guide is more helpful.   The internal sample capacity is apparently smaller than my ESX-1 from 10 years ago?   Agreed, this is kinda lame, but this info was available on the site, did you take a look before buying it?  The new Tribes have their shortcomings, but people are acting like these are a disaster and it's really not the case IMO. Does it do everything the ESX did? No. Does it do a lot the ESX didn't? Yes. Are they a lot of fun for the price and do they sound good? Yes and yes. I hope they improve sample management though, its the only complaint I have with the unit so far."

Really nice to have on a Sampler.   plus I have a Maschine that never gets used   I have a Maschine as well, I think I might actually pre-chop up some samples with that to load into the E2S in the future. I've also been sampling to my OP-1 so I can see the waveform, then resampling on the E2S. Still, for quick and dirty barebones sampling the E2S works out just fine, I'd like a couple more options (normalize!) but it does the job.   MPC 1000 might suite my needs better   It's a much more robust sampler for sure and can be had for around the same price. I just dig the E2S for it's immediacy, portability and fun factor."

Two vertical controls on the left hand side for added expressivity (albeit serving different functions). An analog distortion for grit, etc. If you've used an EMX-1 I don't know how you can miss the resemblance. The heritage of the machines is different, but there's been some cross-pollination of ideas for sure.

There's a 1/16th note pulse being sent to the gate input of an Intellijel Atlantis. The envelope is quite short and is set to loop. It's just a little bit quicker than the pulse being sent to it. The output is being fed into moddemix which is being triggered by channel 1 of a Maths. The loop on the Maths is free running and was set to give a shuffle feel.  Though a couple of the synth lines are clocked to a strict 1/16th pulse, the majority are being effected by the Group Humanizer to move em around a bit and give the thing a human feel while still being on time.  The bass part and synth pad part are played by a Prophet 600.  The drums are all Octatrack."

I moved on to breadboards, 555 timer stuff and building synth kits, and now sampler heavy with noisy bits and pieces.  They are indeed works of art that people put a lot of time into finding the bends and making them fun to play. My two Sk1's were bent by two different dudes and they do different stuff, one has a extra tiny patchbay or can use an old Atari joystick to access extra bends. The other is bent by Spunkytoofer and he also did the Boss pedal which is one of the most fun and musical devices I own. His SK1 has a custom paint job, a clever 4 way matrix thingy to access a shit ton of bends and a mixer of the 4 voices, tons more.  I don't have any Speaks, so maybe this was a little off topic just saying why I love and would pay for such things... There is an amazing iPad app, Soundscaper, that recreates the simple sample chip from a speak type toy and gives you the ability to bend via 20 addresses across an 8 bit sample, as well as clock and PWM settings and it's truly like bending on an iPad. Three different samples at once, each with it's own customizable filters, delay, EQ, three routable LFO's for movement and a great reverb 'area' to play with.

I've got aspirations to make a hobby website where users could program in 8/16 step sequences that emit midi so you could run your hardware synths off of them.  Then allow users to save and tag the sequences.  It think it would be cool for jamming to be able to just pull up a site and try out a bunch of different user made sequences.  You could even take it a step further and have a realtime collaborative sequence between whoever was on the site at the time.  I made something similar awhile back with some friends   http://eightbitbeats.com  it was before webmidi was available though.

Fits well in a mix, takes effects really well, has a massive and full sound.   When it comes to programming, it is very limited, but knowing how it reacts and works can make a decent variety of sounds (more than one would expect).   Are the prices too inflated? They certainly are more expensive than usual, and even though it can be limited, the sounds are very good and classic for what they are.

Even if you're a long drive away, head over to play with it because a few hours of messing with it may end up saving you that $1200.

synthesizers,3987mz,t0xicd0g,3,Wed Jun 10 17:51:15 2015 UTC,"My college had a Juno 106 that I played with a whole lot. I was never impressed with the sound. I actually greatly prefer the sound of the Alpha Juno (which I owned before I played the 106, so my opinion is biased). I know there's a lot of people who say the Juno 60 greatly outshines the 106, but I'm skeptical. Eh. To each their own."
synthesizers,3987mz,ranzee,3,Wed Jun 10 01:50:02 2015 UTC,"I've said this for years; the Junos sound lovely, but are so limited that they are almost useless for anything other than ""those Juno pads"" or ""that Juno bass"". While that is oversimplifying things a little for the sake of making a point, they really were very basic synths in their day, and are even more simplistic nowadays when compared against other new gear that sells for the same price. I do love those sounds, but I'd maybe pay £150-200 for a Juno, and no more - it's all they're worth to me. Lovely sounds, but not that many of them."
synthesizers,3987mz,sawwaveanalog,2,Wed Jun 10 08:53:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed: I too have never been sold on the Juno sound. Never been sold on the crazy price either.  I have an MKS-70 - and I find that sound a stack load fatter than a Juno - and the crazy thing is - they go cheaper. More oscillators per voice, more voices, more phattness - just crazy. The MKS-70 is a rackmount version of the JX-10 (SuperJX) - which is the same as having 2 x JX-8Ps in one.  Collectors or romantic pricing can really suck at times - especially if you want to get yourself a nice piece of gear. But the logic here defies me."
synthesizers,3987mz,ranzee,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:32:47 2015 UTC,The logic is that the MKS-70 is an annoying to program rack synth with the worst envelopes I've ever heard and a ridiculously bad filter compared to the IR3109 in the valuable knobby Rolands. I like the 70/JX10 but they have some severe sonic drawbacks.
synthesizers,3987mz,sawwaveanalog,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"You can program it with ease using an iPad - or get the PG-800. The envelopes are slower - but there is an upgrade you can do (3rd party) which adds a whole gambit of coolness - including faster envelopes, PWM, major improved MIDI+Sysex etc. But original out of the box ones - do have drawbacks - as do most synths. and if you dont like rackmount synths - then get the JX-10 :)"
synthesizers,3987mz,digitaldavis,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"I had a JX10 for many years alongside an SH101 and 60 and 106 and honestly as far as late era crap interface dco analogs go it's not very difficult to program. I followed the development of the mod from the beginning as well, and it helps.. But it's just a half assed synth with a bad filter. If it had an IR3109 implementation I'd have kept it even with its issues, but that late era Roland filter is just poor.  If he got PWM implemented, and sped up the clock to get the envelops and lfo functional it's a passable all arounder, but my issue is that for as much space as the 10 took up and as bad as the filter was, there was just no rrason to dedicat DAW i/o to ot when VSTs had it beat.   It was a killer pad synth in the era before VSTs were viable, but with everything available now.. Well.. It's a vintage Roland analog, and I do love those.. But it just doesn't sound very good imo. Lots of people agree apparently, hence the price.  If you love it that's all that matters though. Not trying to poo poo on anyone, just explaining myself! The JX10 and I have a long, turbulent history :)"

synthesizers,3987mz,rodentdp,3,Tue Jun 9 23:43:16 2015 UTC,I'd normally recommend the juno 6 (same synth but no patch memory) but those have started to climb up to prices comparable with the 60. The 106 is much more affordable but you'll live in constant fear of voice chips breaking. In my quest to find something similar I've been recommended the Roland Alpha Junos and those look pretty great. The TAL-U-NO VST emulation is fantastic if you don't mind going down the software route
synthesizers,3987mz,CrispyLiberal,2,Wed Jun 10 00:09:36 2015 UTC,Plus one for the TAL-U-NO VST. It's free too!

synthesizers,3987mz,SmackSmash,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:52:33 2015 UTC,"I hate to admit it, but no amount of sound similarity can compensate for the menu diving in an alpha vs twiddling around with an analog."
synthesizers,3987mz,CrispyLiberal,2,Wed Jun 10 07:04:49 2015 UTC,"Well, the Alpha Juno is as analog as all the other Juno's, but I'm assuming you are referring to the interface, or lack thereof on the AJ, and yeah, I agree in that sense. It's a great synth, but nothing beats an integrated interface."
synthesizers,3987mz,jepyang,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:35:10 2015 UTC,I'm picking one of these up as soon as I they have more in stock. I use the Ctrlr VST at the moment but there's nothing like having physical controls.

synthesizers,3987mz,allmycodeisbelong2us,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:49:02 2015 UTC,"I've got a Juno 60 and an MKS-70. The J-60 is actually in pretty shit condition, and has a weird issue where it takes like 30 minutes to drift into pitch (shouldn't be the case because of its DCOs). I don't use it that often because of workflow reasons, but, oh... my... god... to my ears it is the best sounding thing ever. Maybe it's just cause mine is old and parts inside it have aged or broken in a serendipitous way, but I feel like no matter what the settings are, it sounds amazing and immediately throws a ton of music phrases/ideas into my head. Whereas with my MKS-70, I definitely have to work to find an inspiring sound. Then again, the MKS-70 is a bit more complicated.  I like it without the chorus a lot too. The Chorus II is amazing but adds a ton of base level noise.  Anyways, just my 10c. For my tastes (afx-style acid), my particular unit is the most musical synth I've played."
synthesizers,3987mz,rush340,2,Wed Jun 10 10:22:19 2015 UTC,The DCOs are clocked from a high frequency VCO which can drift. I played another Juno 60 that did the same thing. The difference compared to a VCO-based synth is that all the voices drift together rather than independently.
synthesizers,3987mz,octopus-crime,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:31:17 2015 UTC,Dear sir you are a wizard! Thanks for the pointer. Do you know of any way to fix this?

The master VCO is a fairly complicated discrete circuit, and it would likely be a pain to analyze and troubleshoot. As long as it's still usable, I'd just live with it. In the one I used, the tuning was perfectly stable after it warmed up."

Not sure if that was just that particular unit or if this is a known issue with the 60s"
synthesizers,3987mz,sawwaveanalog,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:39:42 2015 UTC,"The Juno 60 is totally worth it.  There's nothing like it for cheaper.  You were shopping for the wrong synth if you're complaining about its limitations.  If you don't think it sounds any better than a VST you should probably stick to VSTs.  It's good that you're figuring out what you really want in a synth, but there's a big difference between saying ""NOT worth the price"" and saying ""not worth the price to me because it doesn't fit my needs"".  I think you meant to say the latter."
synthesizers,3987mz,digitaldavis,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:39:55 2015 UTC,I always thought the Juno range was an expensive way to buy a handful of warm fuzzy presets that sound a bit crap without chorus.
synthesizers,3987mz,sawwaveanalog,2,Wed Jun 10 06:15:16 2015 UTC,"As an ex-JX-3P owner, I'm inclined to agree - chorus on/off was the magic button (the sequencer was nice, but that's nothing to do with the synth engine). I think you could gut a 3P and put a cheap VA in there, and everyone would be happy as long as you put it through the chorus."
synthesizers,3987mz,tugs_cub,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:59:35 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of people, and this isn't a shot, you're looking for synths that present a lot of interesting parameters and modulation routing hence your draw to VA and issues with the 60.  The 60 isn't about what you can get out of it in the sense you mentioned it's about how it can cut through a mix or warm your soul.  Part of the reason i find 96k reviews on youtube through macbook speakers from NAMM and preordering synths before hearing them in person funny.  What sort of monitors/headphones did you play with it on?"

synthesizers,3987mz,sawwaveanalog,-1,Wed Jun 10 06:19:34 2015 UTC,"So today I went into my local used car dealer just to kill some time. I got there just after they opened so the store was pretty much empty except for the employees. When I walked into the showroom and saw a used Enzo sitting on one of the racks, I almost had a heart attack. I never thought I would come across one in the wild, let alone at a used car dealership! I immediately put the key in the ignition and began driving, with no regards to who was around me. This may be my only chance to drive one, so I'm going to cherish it. I was in  it for about 3 hours. And in the end, while feeling like I had finally satisfied the speedboner I've had for so long, I think I'm gonna strike the Enzo from my current potential car candidate ballot, at least for now. Why? Well, after getting acquainted with it for 3 hours, I would have been much more impressed IF THESE THINGS WERE CHEAPER. Don't get me wrong, I had a great deal of fun with it. It's a great fast car. But I don't think it's $1,000,000+ great. I know, I know, welcome to the world of rare cars. But I finally see how limited it truly is. Other than some really great acceleration and really cool handling, I don't see much to this car. The braking ability was nice but kinda slowed the car down like any other car with brakes, nothing really unique or special there. I got some great acceleration out of it that I could imagine being fun at a stoplight and it's capable of some cool hard and soft cornering, but again, it didn't sound like something you couldn't get from any basic, cheaper sports car (or even a gokart).  I could def see myself spending hours with one if they were more affordable, say in the $20-30,000 range. But in the end, the Ferrari Enzo is NOT worth the current going price of $1,000,000+ for its limitations. If you have the money to piss away, then go for it. But I don't think its worth that price for its basic capabilities. And because of the nature of the vintage car market, a lot of that price is just paying for the ability to say you have a Ferarri. It's great at what it does but it isn't worth what's being asked for one. Please don't hate me for saying this because I've actually talked on this sub in the past about how much I wanted one. But after finally getting to know one, it isn't worth the investment. This whole experience has actually got me questioning the whole concept of getting a rare sports car for an inflated price. Do I really want to invest that much money in a two door car, in an industry that relies heavily on cargo space and fuel economy in order to appeal to the mainstream? I'm sorry guys, if you're fine with parting with the money then go ahead, it's a lot of fun. But if you're like me and you've been lusting after one and saving up, you can do much better with that money if you look elsewhere. I had alot of fun with the Enzo today, but after 3 hours with it I would NOT have been happy if I had just blindly spent $1,000,000 on it and couldn't even use it to pick my kids up from school.  tl;dr - The Ferarri Enzo is a great car but is NOT worth the price for its limitations. Unless you can blindly afford one, look elsewhere."

That doesn't mean I'm arguing that the 60 or 8 or anything else is better than anything. On paper the 60 is borderline useless compared to modern synths. Same with a Ferrari. Or a piece of art. Or any other desirable niche item not in current mass production. The value is set by how many of them there are, how many people want them, and how badly those people want them. They aren't overpriced, there isn't an investment bank somewhere manipulating the vintage synth market, that's just where their value has landed.  The whole concept of this item isn't worth x because there are other things that do the same thing but cost less is missing the point entirely.   And I only make love to the 8 on weekends, thank you."

Let's see here, they've now discontinued the Voyager Rack Mount Edition, Freqbox, MidiMURF AND suspended production of the Analog Delay.  That's a lot of pretty big Moog products to take a hit in such a short amount of time.  I imagine some other voyager series will be dropped soon, too.  I suppose they're making way for teh new hotnezz!  I wonder what it'll be!?"
synthesizers,396mze,Benulous,6,Tue Jun 9 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"I suppose they're making way for teh new hotnezz   Thats my guess as well.   However, you'll notice that they've released a lot of gear that is much cheaper than the stuff they've discontinued. You can sell a whole bunch more $1500 synthesizers than $3000 ones, a whole bunch more $200 pedals than $600 ones, etc.   The Sub37 is probably they're best seller since the Minitaur. I think they're wising up to the fact that they can sell a lot more gear when it's affordable for more people."
synthesizers,396mze,slujj-vohaul,3,Tue Jun 9 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"Well, the Sub37 is supposedly ""limited edition"".  I think it may be a test synth for technology in a future flagship.  Also, last time I was at the Moog factory a couple months ago, I got to hang in the back and shoot the shit with the technicians.  One of them mentioned that they'd been building out a whole new warehouse area where they were going to be building out those bigger modulars.  Thinking back on our conversation, I wouldn't be surprised if they were going fully modular with a lot of their products.  Time will tell, though..."
synthesizers,396mze,Benulous,8,Tue Jun 9 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"I think the current Bob Moog edition is the only thing that's limited about the Sub 37. Once that version has been discontinued, I'd expect them to continue producing the Sub 37 with different color schemes."
synthesizers,396mze,sheboygan_sexpo,5,Tue Jun 9 20:28:21 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with this, the Sub 37 has been a huge commercial and critical success and I can't imagine they will stop at 1500 units or so.   They might also release a next-gen flagship synth, since the Model D/Voyager is many people's gold-standard of what an analog subtractive synth should be. I can't imagine they will totally abandon it, just maybe focus more on more economical products."
synthesizers,396mze,kirklandish,3,Tue Jun 9 20:37:43 2015 UTC,"Yep, I don't see the Sub37 going anywhere any time soon.  That's probably one of the best things they've released in a long time.  Hell, I guess I wouldn't even be that surprised to find out they halted production on all the other stuff to concentrate on making more of those synths!  I have an XL and I want a sub37!"
synthesizers,396mze,Benulous,2,Tue Jun 9 22:17:41 2015 UTC,"It'd be pretty sweet if they decided to start producing 5U modules again, and especially if they made them compatible with the power supplies and voltages used by the dotcom format.

synthesizers,396mze,Benulous,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:18:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't characterize it as ""wising up"" so much as recognizing that the market is changing and evolving their business model to meet those changes.  Just ten years ago, there wasn't nearly the demand for affordable synthesizers as there is today. Kids wanting to learn to play music were still buying Squier Strats, not Minibrutes. Hell, there wasn't even anything on the market like a Minibrute.

I think they'll keep the Performer Edition for a while, but I wouldn't be surprised if the Electric Blue is discontinued soon - not much of a loss, I think it looks awful - but I think it'd be quite sad for Moog to discontinue Bob Moog's last flagship design. The Voyager is a wonderful synth, and I absolutely love mine, but I could understand it needing a bit of an update (USB would be a good addition). I don't think the Sub 37 is a replacement at all, the main difference being the lack of a third oscillator, and I wouldn't have thought they'd try to include a sequencer or an overdrive circuit in a Voyager update , mostly because I think it goes against the philosophy of the synth, if that makes any sense.   TL;DR, maybe, but I don't think the Sub 37 is the replacement/answer."

synthesizers,395p7m,mrcolonist,3,Tue Jun 9 16:34:16 2015 UTC,"I'd like to ask you, does the delay crackle if you do the classic full feedback + shortening the delay time effect?  I have the X-Station and anytime I change the delay time while playing it crackles."
synthesizers,395p7m,mrcolonist,2,Tue Jun 9 17:10:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but this sort of thing isn't particular to the KS engine; my Z1 also glitches if you change the delay time while playing. I think the DSP in effects processors built into synths just aren't as powerful as those sort of effects aren't generally made for live tweaking, more just setting and leaving. Some stuff has dedicated units that do the whole speeding up / slowing down thing as you change the delay time, like the Electribe ER1 and TR8, but not the Novation effects.  Edit: Just tried it out and in fact the KS4 just cuts the delay out if you alter the time while playing, presumably to mute any glitching. The Z1 on the other hand crackles and pops like crazy as you turn the knob to change the delay time. I knew the KS4 did something odd when you edited it!"
synthesizers,395p7m,hafilax,2,Tue Jun 9 17:15:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the answer. At least there's a bit of comfort knowing that this is common and not something that's just with my synth.
synthesizers,395p7m,mierscheid,2,Tue Jun 9 18:07:33 2015 UTC,I think it's the delay algorithm. My TC Electronic Flashback stutters when adjusting the delay time when playing and my Ibanez DE7 behaves more like an analog delay.
synthesizers,395p7m,mierscheid,2,Tue Jun 9 19:12:01 2015 UTC,"The Ibanez probably varies the sample rate to change the delay time. This behaves the same as a BBD delay, or varying the tape speed of a tape delay. DSP-based delays work at a fixed sample rate and move the read pointer."
synthesizers,395p7m,Alexis_,2,Tue Jun 9 22:51:03 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of whether the control information in smoothed and the delay read point is interpolated. If the delay read point is updated suddenly and discontinuously at the control rate, it's going to stutter. It's not particularly difficult to make a delay that can be smoothly adjusted; it's just what the designers decided to do. If it's a data entry knob rather than a performance controller, generally they won't bother to do it smoothly."
synthesizers,395p7m,zorrn,3,Tue Jun 9 22:50:06 2015 UTC,"KS is a lovely synth. I had mine for 6 years until I had to sell it when moving countries. First thing I did after getting to my new home was to buy another Novation :)  (...a Nova desktop this time, which is equally awseome)"

synthesizers,396pfo,rodentdp,3,Tue Jun 9 17:58:34 2015 UTC,Always dry. Nothing like realizing you ruined the track because the amount of whatever you added was too much. Chorus is the exception. Sometimes distortion too.
synthesizers,396pfo,Kyogre790,3,Tue Jun 9 22:53:16 2015 UTC,"Both. As you do it more and more you'll start to know what effects you will absolutely keep and which ones you won't.

synthesizers,396pfo,KilroytheKilljoy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:24:10 2015 UTC,"Any time there's any live performance element with whatever I'm recording (parameter tweaking, etc) I always record dry and then run that back out my DAW and through whichever effects I want to; if it's something like a standalone sequence that I can just set to play and record again I might risk recording the first pass through effects."
synthesizers,396pfo,jp650,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:31:03 2015 UTC,"It depends. For distortion? I often go ""wet"". Sometimes I will use reverb ITB, other times I will record wet with one of my reverb pedals. The key to recording wet is to be bold in knowing that you have the settings just as you want.   I get a different character from recording either dry or wet. Plenty of my pedals add character that is hard to find in the software I have. Sometimes recording wet is more fun, and can lead to more creative recordings. At other times it is a pain in the ass and leads to big issues, leading to re-recording. The main point is that either is a tool, and I personally like to do both depending on the situation."

Then I pick my favourite. Some synths have a distinctive sound using their built-in effects - like the famous chorus sounds in some of the 80's Roland gear. In this case I'm in love with that sound - it just goes straight in. However, lately I've been trying out some new analog chorus gear - and comparing the results - and I've been quite pleasantly surprised!   So, both is the best recommendation in my opinion :)"

The ES-1 has a roll feature which is missing on the ER-1, but it has half the pattern space as the ER-1; apart from that, I think they're exactly the same from a sequencing standpoint."

Not 100% sure that it sends triggers on the same notes as the Drumstation receives thoughm, that might be worth checking out. The EA1 would be another good option as you can of course control the notes that are sent. The MPC1000 would be a good buy in general despite also being a fantastic sequencer and sampler, the pads present a great way to program and create beats and you can run up to 32 MIDI instruments from its sequencer!  I'd steer clear of the SQ1 and Beatstep as they are not polyphonic sequencers, and you will occasionally need to have drum sounds playing on the same step."

If you want to save even more - you could look at the little brother: the BeatStep for an even cheaper MIDI/CV sequencer. If you already have a Behringer BCR-2000 lying around, you can get the ZACQUENCER firmware to convert it into a MIDI sequencer - very capable and powerful. Or, as you suggested, the SQ-1 will do you well."
synthesizers,398i1o,ranzee,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:26:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the original, cheaper Beatstep would be fine for the Drumstation, as you don't need separate channels.

As I wanted the cheaper option, since I choose Novation Drumstation for the price, I think I'll take an electribe, the ES-1 or the ER-1, or why not both. But the BeatStep Pro is almost 3 times the price of the drumstation so that's not an option, at least for now. The Beatstep would be a nice option too, I can still try both the beatstep and the electribe and get rid of the one I don't like. Thanks reddit !"

synthesizers,395t5t,MacZyver,8,Tue Jun 9 13:40:31 2015 UTC,"If you're checking it out in person, research the synth heavily (specifically read the manual) and verify everything works properly. Make sure every knob, input/output, key, wheel, ribbon, etc. works the way it should. The con of buying in person, through craigslist or somebody you meet, is that you don't have a return policy--which is why it's imperative to know everything functions properly before you walk away with it. Be sure to ask about it's history of repair, or any intermittent problems that have occurred.  If you're buying off ebay, there's much less risk if you get it and something doesn't work--you'll likely be able to return it, although shipping might be at your own expense and is generally a hassle.   The biggest pro is finding something for a ridiculously good price. And if it functions properly, and isn't in terrible shape, you're good to go!  In the end, every synth has a different history, so buying used from the guy who has toured with the synth for 15 years straight will be different from the guy who bought it new last year and hasn't touched it since. The experience will definitely vary."

I've had excellent experiences with Reverb all around, both buying and selling. They've set it up more like a community and they encourage interaction between buyers and sellers, so people are a lot more inclined to reach out directly and eventually settle on a fair price. Plus they only take like ~3% of your sale price (PayPal takes another 3%), and the ""Bump"" feature is actually very useful. Anything I've put up there has sold within a few days, and anything I've purchased has been in great shape and shipped to me quickly.  eBay and PayPal take a combined 13% of your sale now, it's just ridiculous. The last item I put up there was purchased by someone in Georgia (the country) and they never paid. I had to wait for a week before I could even relist the item and the entire thing was just a hassle.

synthesizers,395t5t,rodentdp,6,Tue Jun 9 22:55:36 2015 UTC,"I generally only buy used. One thing to consider is that a synth loses value as soon as the box is opened, which is worth considering if you ever sell it. Buying used, you can usually break even or potentially even profit if you sell it.   The downside to buying used is the potential that you might buy something and it is broken or defective. As mentioned, eBay is generally a safe bet as a buyer, because eBay almost always sides with the buyer in disputes. Craigslist gives you the advantage of checking something out in person. Guitar Center...the advantage of buying from GC is that they have an easy return policy and you can go into any store for the return, and due to employee incompetence they sometimes price things exceptionally low. The downside is that despite whatever claims they make, it is painfully obvious to me that they only inspect used gear maybe 50% of the time. As mentioned, the return policy makes this somewhat less infuriating, but if you buy something used from another store and it arrives defective, don't let them screw you out of returning the shipping charges. My new favorite is Music Go Round, which I've found is a completely different experience to buying from GC. They do a detailed inspection when they buy in used gear, and then inspect it again before the sale is completed and the item is shipped."

Unfortunately, expecting someone making $9/hour part time to do a thorough inspection means that the results can be spotty. I'd say that maybe as much as 30-40% of the used stuff I have purchased from them online (and I always call to have an employee check the condition, that it includes a power cable, etc.) has arrived in a non-working state.

Part of my luck may be that I've purchased a lot of rack gear from them, and I doubt that gets as detailed of an inspection because there are usually fewer obvious physical defects on rack equipment. Still, right off the top of my head I can think of a DOA Presonus Digimax FS (if you turn it on and nothing lights up, it probably isn't working), a Lexicon LXP-15 MkII that made the most speaker-shredding noise without any input, and most recently a Proteus 2000 with no power cable that could not past the boot screen, and when it finally did it sounded like it was circuit bent and dying...all very easy to detect defects with even the slightest amount of testing.   They are not all bad. I got my very minty MPC 1000 (even had the memory upgrade) from them recently for an ok price, and they let me put down $100 to reserve it over the phone since I was a few days shy of payday.

synthesizers,395t5t,ranzee,5,Tue Jun 9 14:27:00 2015 UTC,"Your comfort level when it comes to repairs will be important if you stick to buying used, especially if you start getting older stuff than what you mentioned. I've bought stuff that was advertised as ""Fully tested and working"" that was far from working by the time I got it home. I've also bought stuff that was sold ""as-is, for parts"" that worked flawlessly when I plugged it in.   In many of these situations, a repair that could have cost some real money to pay someone to fix was resolved cheaply by researching and repairing it myself. Sometimes it is as simple as a can of Deoxit (which revived a half dozen buttons on my MPC1000). My ESQ-m showed up with a wonky data slider, but a linear pot from mouser is on the way to fix that for a few bucks.   Not all repairs will be so simple (my DK Synergy II+ seems to have a very slow running LFO that makes the synth oscillate between broken and working every other time I turn it on), but overall being willing to fix things yourself will make used gear less of a gamble."

synthesizers,39561b,jpaaay,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:55:57 2015 UTC,What IS lfo slew?
synthesizers,39561b,kirklandish,4,Tue Jun 9 15:18:24 2015 UTC,"I am answering this to the best of my knowledge, anyone feel free to expand or correct me.   A slew limiter limits the amount of change in a signal. One common use is for portamento or glide, as in it affects the rate of change in pitch from one note to the next. When used with LFOs it can affect how sharply the LFO rises and falls, this is useful for smoothing out a S&H LFO, making it sound a little smoother.   Edit: I think it also reffered to as a lag processor http://electronicmusic.wikia.com/wiki/Lag_processor"
synthesizers,39561b,Magnusson,6,Tue Jun 9 15:31:29 2015 UTC,"This is correct. The BS2 manual explains it pretty well on p. 16:   LFO Slew Slew has the effect of modifying the shape of the LFO waveform. Sharp edges become less sharp as Slew is increased. The effect of this can be heard by selecting Square as the LFO waveform and setting the rate fairly low so that the output when a key is pressed alternates between just two tones. Increasing the value of Slew will cause the transition between the two tones to become a “glide” rather than a sharp change. This is caused by the vertical edges of the square LFO waveform being slewed.     I believe I've also heard the term used in relation to magnetic tape, i.e. tape is not capable of recording extremely fast transients, so it introduces some slew, which is part of its sound."

ESPECIALLY since it's kinda marketed as a ""performance synth"" and I gotta tell ya - I'd be nervous as SHIT to gig that board out. One false move and a fall to the floor seems like it would destroy the casing, and potentially the entire board.  But, having said that, mine will simply sit in a climate-controlled studio on a z-stand. So, honestly I don't care too much about the build.   A couple of the only complaints I have so far: 1) The keybed leaves a little to be desired. It's kinda mushy, and 2) There is a bit of menu-diving for deep editing, which is understandable since this is supposed to be a performance board, but the menu system is SO much like that of my MS2000 that I already know it like the back of my hand, so this is only a minor quibble."

Watched every YouTube video I could find, read all the reviews etc I ignored all the negative stuff I found because it seemed to sound good on the videos and I loved the thought of all the controls.   Finally got one and was very excited to get it home. After 10 minutes I was disappointed the presents sounded crap so I started to make my own sounds and it just sounded thin and empty.   I played with it got a week but my feelings never changed so I sold it and bought Oddity 2 instead."
synthesizers,394rvz,OhYesTheyFloat,3,Tue Jun 9 12:26:43 2015 UTC,"As others have said and will say, it's not the greatest sounding va (arguably not even a va as it uses samples instead of modelled waveforms), nor is it a particularly deep synth engine. I just saw a Novation KS4 end on Ebay yesterday for £140, which is just obscenely low and as a synth it sounds a ton better than a Gaia, has 3 (modelled) oscillators per voice, 4 part multitimbral for sequencing and layering, with separate effects for each part, and a slew of PCM drum and percussion samples you can edit and run through the synth engine to make your own drumkit. I always knew the KS4 was underrated, I just didn't realise how cheaply they sell for nowadays. Is it perfect? No, it internally clips if you load it up with too many effects and overdrive the filter, the modulation routing could be more flexible - but then, that's why you'd buy a Supernova 2 instead at about 5 times the price!"
synthesizers,394rvz,t0xicd0g,3,Tue Jun 9 11:35:00 2015 UTC,"I did not like the Gaia. But it's a subjective thing. If you like it, get it.  If you're looking for analog, then this isn't the way to go. And certainly not the JP-8000. Neither sound particularly analog.  The only thing good about the Gaia, imo, is the interface. I didn't care for the sound at all.  Get a used KingKORG. It's the best VA on the market right now, and you should be able to score one for your price range, used."

(I don't like the word ""mint"" - as unless it is brand new in a box never opened - it isn't mint).  I've had a few days playing with it - and while it isn't really the best ""VA"" out there - it does have some uses - I find it very good for 8-bit emulation - and that will be one of its main uses for me. As I already have a fairly decent synth collection - it isn't so much a big deal for me. The GAIA sounds a bit digital to me overall.  If you are preferring analog - you wont get a poly for anywhere near this money (unless you grab a crappy vintage Korg like an Poly800).   My advice would be to get a more decent VA - and there's a massive list of them. If you need a few to get you looking - take a look at an older model Access Virus (like a B), a Korg RADIAS or R3, a Roland System-1, a Novation MiniNova etc etc."

I've had mine for years and it's still functioning well though, in part because it doesn't see heavy use but take it as you will.  Drivers aren't required, I believe. I don't remember having to install them but I may be mistaken. Their site says you don't need them, but it may well require a basic ASIO driver install, which you should have anyway.

synthesizers,394cvm,naturalscience,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:46:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the mixer would still be required for bringing the Blofeld and Korg together, the mixer out would go into the Venom and the Venom would send the mix and its own sounds into the PC via USB. I expect you could patch the Venom through the mixer and then ignore the internal sounds on your PC, if that makes sense. So the only stream you'd be capturing would be the Venom's external audio, but that would contain the Venom's voices because they'd have been sent to the mixer.  I haven't used a Venom, but I have an Ultranova and I expect it works the same way - I'd check the Venom manual online for more info.  The Venom tends to be cheap nowadays, probably because it was viewed as an unfinished project - it has a restricted set of controls for onboard editing, and the rest is done through a plugin that I don't think was ever fully finished. But for the prices it goes for nowadays I think it's probably a good option. It's generally regarded as being quite an aggressive and digital-sounding synth - I think it's sample-based rather than VA.  If you're considering the Venom, I expect you could find a mixer with USB audio in the same price range. That'd be a much simpler (and really a more suitable) setup - but you wouldn't get a synth thrown in... Check out the Behringer Xenyx series for some cheap USB-friendly mixers, or the Yamaha MG series if you want to spend a little more to avoid Behringer."

synthesizers,392qjj,slujj-vohaul,4,Mon Jun 8 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"Feature wise I would say Moog is overpriced, but I honestly feel like they are higher priced mostly because Moog's production techniques are just so expensive. You have to remember, that Moog hand builds all their synths, and hand solders most of their circuit boards. Everything possible is sourced through the US when they are able to. This unfortunately adds up. When compared to DSI all their circuit boards are automatically assembled which not only allowing for faster production times but larger production which helps to bring prices down. Moog could almost be considered a giant boutique shop because of the ways they make their synths."

synthesizers,392qjj,bastardpants,3,Mon Jun 8 23:56:06 2015 UTC,"The price is definitely very nice on them right now. I considered picking one up instead of the Minitaur, but I can't get past the fact that the Cutoff and Resonance share the same knob. It seems like a minor problem but its a deal breaker for me."
synthesizers,392qjj,familydogs,6,Mon Jun 8 21:30:48 2015 UTC,"It is possible to have cutoff and resonance on separate knobs, but you have to decide which other (already overloaded) knob gets another function.  You can, say, leave cutoff on the filter knob and menu-dive to pot-map the LFO knob as a backup resonance. Then, press whichever LFO button is currently activated to switch the LFO knob over to resonance (the light on the button will turn off as a visual cue that the knob is mapped elsewhere).  Not convenient, but possible."
synthesizers,392qjj,bastardpants,3,Mon Jun 8 22:06:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the pot mapping works well, it just requires some pre-planning. A more spontaneous approach that I've adopted is keeping an expression pedal permanently tied to the filter CV input, so I don't need to use the knob to adjust filter cutoff while performing.  I've posted about it on here several times in the past, but I love the Phatty interface. Even if it isn't ""knob per function"", it's very immediate, and to me almost as good. You do lose the ability to simultaneously tweak some parameters (I don't do this often anyway), but the LED rings are amazing for seeing values in a dark club during a live set or checking values after loading stored patches. No more blind wiggling and guesswork to figure out what value the knob is set to..."
synthesizers,392qjj,familydogs,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:00:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, I tend to not plan ahead enough to really use the pot mapping, since I usually end up trying to play and tweak instead of sequence and tweak.  I had forgotten about the CV inputs, too. Now that I think about it, I have tried a midi pedal for some parameter adjustments, but midi doesn't allow for the smoothest filter sweep (might be ok for resonanse - I'll have to give it a try!)."
synthesizers,392qjj,t0xicd0g,3,Tue Jun 9 01:12:08 2015 UTC,"If you are more knob-friendly, instead of an expression pedal, per se, you could also use something like this in the filter CV (just a first Google result example) or make your own for cheap.  http://this1smyne.com/shop/me-mini-expression-pedal/  The caveat is that the CV input ranges from the current cutoff value to the maximum value. So, if you want this knob to replace the normal cutoff button, you'd have to save all of your patches with the cutoff at 0."

synthesizers,3930yk,ohizu,9,Mon Jun 8 22:02:03 2015 UTC,"The easiest solution would be to buy a mixer with an aux send.  The Blofeld and Korg go into the mixer.  The Lexicon hooks up to the aux send on the mixer (two cables from the mixer into the Lexicon, and two cables back).  The send / return controls on the mixer set the effect levels for the synths.  The mixer out goes into the 2i4 (the mixer might have its own USB audio connection as an alternative, depending on the model and how much you spend).  This way you get to control the depth of the effects for both synths, which is preferable to mixing them both into the Lexicon where it would be all or nothing. You also have room for expansion with the other mixer channels.  Bear in mind that if you want to play both synths at the same time, your 2i4 will be sending the mixed signal (including the effects) to your PC - so you won't be able to separate the tracks afterwards. To do that, you'll need a multichannel interface of some kind."
synthesizers,3930yk,3lbFlax,3,Mon Jun 8 22:42:52 2015 UTC,"Be careful with this however - there are quite a few mixers on the market that have AUX sends but no returns - which means you have to use up input channels for them - not a huge deal, and in some cases this is preferred - but then again ;)"
synthesizers,3930yk,ranzee,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:10:03 2015 UTC,"Even if there is a dedicated effects return, using an input channel for an effects reverb has some advantages. For example, if your mixer has mute buttons, you can just hit it to hear a dry mix. You can also EQ the output from the effect, which you might use to cut the ""mud"" from a reverb. You can pan the effects, maybe to have your dry on the left side and 'verb on the right. And for the adventurous, you can feed the effect right into itself (not too much!)."

synthesizers,3930yk,skurdnee,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"He doesn't necessarily need to record everything coming from the mixer. I just learned (new to all of this) about something called ""alt 3-4"" which practically means that the mute buttons on the mixer channels not only mutes, but sends the signal to an alternative output.  Having only a simple 2x in and 2x out usb sound card, I bought a Mackie mixer with alt output. Plugged in my ms20 mini, volca sample and iPad to the line ins, the alt out to the input of the sound card, and the output of the sound card back into the stereo return (for now anyway).  That way as soon as I want to record one of the channels, I just ""mute"" it, and he signal is sent to the sound card inputs. I can still monitor it from the mixer with a button press. Was a really nice way for me at least.  This might not be news for anyone else :P but when I read about it I thought it was really clever. :)  EDIT: oh and in my case, it also has aux output. So instead of using stereo return as I did for computer audio, you could just use an actual line in for that, and the stereo return for the fx. Whatever works for you."
synthesizers,3930yk,krapduude,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:06:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it depends on how you want to record, really. If you want to capture full jam sessions as a single file, that's easy enough. If it's sequenced stuff and you want individual tracks to mix and process later, then the alt method is definitely a good solution (you could also just use the mixer faders, especially if there's a pre-fader cue of some kind).  As I said, I really like the Zoom R16 for this, as it can capture eight simultaneous tracks either internally or via USB - so you can just capture a session as separate tracks without having to worry about it. If something magical happens, you'll have it."
synthesizers,3930yk,3lbFlax,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"For playing live, you need a mixer with auxiliary sends and returns. This way you can select the amount of the effect for each channel on the board but you will lose ability to record as separate tracks into your DAW.  For recording, you could still use a mixer but restrict yourself to recording just one track at a time; again, you get to control the depth of the effect and this way you at least get separate audio tracks in your DAW.   I have an 18i8 and I don't want to go back to a mixer so I just plug an effect into the chain between it and the instrument I want to effect, old school!"

I love synthesizers, i think they're one of the best instruments around, however I also am a fan of innovation and I just don't see that in what the synth world is doing right now. As a poor college student I'll never be able to buy synthesizers like this, probably ever, and when I listen to people demo them it's like 'Yup, that 56 year old dentist programmed an evolved poly synth pad. Never heard anything like that before.' Maybe I'll be interested in synths once instruments that I could use practically start being made or re-issued (analog divide down string synth that doesn't have fucked up capacitors...

Look, I get it. In college, I did photography—with film! And chemicals!—and I'd have killed for better gear than I could afford. So many retired dentists taking pictures of bark and talking about Ansel Adams...I wanted to rip their cameras away and take interesting photographs!

I've been lucky to be able to indulge a hobby. But I'm not harboring any illusions that I'm doing anything REVOLUTIONARY. Each sound I make is new to me. That's enough for now.   Look, if you've got big ideas about synthesis, you have every right to be excited. I hope they ferment and become strong and heady, so that when the moment comes, and you get hold of the tool you think you lack, you will make transcendent music.

synthesizers,3926v6,clegg,2,Mon Jun 8 18:39:58 2015 UTC,"I've got an Alpha Juno and had a DW-8000 at one point, both of which came after the synths you have and neither of which really respond to CC (I think volume, maybe a few other parameters, but nothing for the filters or other sound design or performance related settings), only sysex. Have you consulted the manuals for any of the gear you have to check what kind of messages they can send or receive? The MicroKorg will likely work as you're wishing, as I'm assuming it has a much more advanced midi implementation than the others.  Now that said, I'm not sure if the 2000XL can send sysex to other gear. I'm a recent MPC 1000 owner and still learning, but as I understand it you can send sysex to other gear via the sequencer. Maybe it is possible that the 2000XL has the same capability?"
synthesizers,3926v6,rodentdp,2,Mon Jun 8 19:25:53 2015 UTC,"If you're using the MIDI out as a thru it should send everything you play, whether notes or CC or SysEx or NRPN. The MPC1000 certainly does; I use my Novation Remote to program my Tetra and DW6000 through the MPC1000 and it works fine.   Edit: the Nord is not a dedicated controller so you can't remap its controllers CCs. I'd advise getting something like a Novation Remote and using it as the master keyboard for everything and programming templates on it for the 106 and Nord. It will certainly send controller data through the MPC."
synthesizers,3926v6,t0xicd0g,2,Mon Jun 8 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"Confusing title, because MIDI CCs are something virtually any MIDI-capable device can send, whereas finding stuff that can do custom sysex messages (which are distinct from CCs) is a bit more uncommon.  Not sure what the MPC is capable of, but I kind of doubt you can do what you're asking about. It may be able to send sysex as part of a sequence (ie, load a patch at the beginning of a song) but using it as an intermediary between your Nord and your Juno seems unlikely."

synthesizers,390cu5,the_cody,8,Mon Jun 8 09:20:50 2015 UTC,"Want to talk about default presets?   One of the great joys of synthesis is designing patches, but if I find a musically useful preset I will use it. I was more inclinwd to use the default patches when I had the micron or my friend's blofeld because designin patches is tedious on these.  Only having had the Mopho a couple days, I have spent a lot of time browsing the factory patches to get a sense of what it can do. I  might use or modify a couple default patches for my band's songs."
synthesizers,390cu5,kirklandish,5,Mon Jun 8 12:37:19 2015 UTC,"Starting from scratch on the Blofeld is definitely tedious. Luckily, it has the randomize feature, so instead of creating an INIT patch, you can make something totally random. Usually it's unusable noise, but I've gotten some pretty interesting results after tweaking a bunch of randomized patches."
synthesizers,390cu5,sheboygan_sexpo,3,Mon Jun 8 14:52:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's a really cool feature that I didn't know it had. My friend just sold his blofeld to feed the modular money pit, so I won't be able to try it out anytime soon."
synthesizers,390cu5,kirklandish,5,Mon Jun 8 15:29:47 2015 UTC,"I find that starting with a preset in a fairly complex software synth and altering it from there is more pleasant than always starting from scratch. Sometimes I can find a patch really close to my goal and I'll just change the waveforms or envelope shape and it'll be exactly what I want - a lot nicer than having to do it all out manually, and I still get to play with the parameters."
synthesizers,390cu5,TheUglyHobo,3,Mon Jun 8 14:48:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed... starting from scratch is fun, but sometimes just altering the envelopes and filter settings on a preset is a good way to put more of the focus on creating music versus purely sound design."
synthesizers,390cu5,kirklandish,4,Mon Jun 8 15:27:56 2015 UTC,"I will say, the stock patches on the blofeld are some of the only presets on a synth that I've kept. Most of them sound really good.  Plus for me the programming is much simpler, albeit not as quick as my ms20. I've never cared all that much about whether I need to menu dive, seeing as most of my synths are menu based."
synthesizers,390cu5,quantumdylan,6,Mon Jun 8 14:58:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit of a masochist when it comes to patch creation. I try to never use presets, or tweaked presets. I have nothing against them being used, I just like to work from scratch. When I get a synth, I will listen to the presets to get the breadth of sounds it's capable of, and I'll dissect patches to find out how they work. But, ultimately, I try to make all my sounds from an init patch.  I've talked before about how I have a hard time separating sound design and composition. This might be one of the biggest factors in that. Even using presets that I've made doesn't feel right.  I think a part of the problem is that I think of sound design and composition as two aspects of the same process. I hear people say ""I'm a musician, so I need to be able to get usable sounds quickly""  and it seems a bit ... rude? Probably not their intention, but this implies to me that sound design is inherently not something a ""musician"" cares about, but that the notes are more important. As a musician, I've decided that timbre and pitch are on equal footing. The old adage about ""if you can play it on a piano while singing, it's a good song,"" seems to totally miss the point of the art of sound design.  I am absolutely obsessed with Kate Bush, but the album I enjoy the most is The Dreaming, which has the most out-there production. Lots of experimentation on that album. The music is on par with her other albums, but the sounds in the songs and the production play a huge role in making the notes of the songs come to life.  So, yeah. For me, presets are great for learning new ways to abuse the synthesis of an instrument, but I still prefer to make all sounds from init."
synthesizers,390cu5,t0xicd0g,6,Mon Jun 8 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, it's why I love synthesis. If I have creative downtime where I aren't inspired to write music, I will go through my gear and program new patches to populate my banks. Then,  next time I get creative, I have some new colours on my palette. I will keep modified presets if they rock me, but mostly yeah, I also like to work from init patches too."
synthesizers,390cu5,kirklandish,4,Mon Jun 8 20:37:18 2015 UTC,"I think a part of the problem is that I think of sound design and composition as two aspects of the same process.   I hear you, with all of the music I enjoy - acoustic or electronic - the sound of the instruments and how they are used to create texture are a really important aspect. I think that is the reason I have always been drawn to electronic music, the texture of the music and variations in timbre are often an integral part of the composition.   ""if you can play it on a piano while singing, it's a good song""   I see where people are coming from with this, but I think it is closed minded and more than a little Eurocentric. You can't play Gamelan on a piano, but it is still amazing music."

Probably not their intention, but this implies to me that sound design is inherently not something a ""musician"" cares about, but that the notes are more important.   The thing about most musical instruments is that they only make that one sound. Sax, piano, trumpet, etc, all just sound like whatever they sound like. Want a different sound, get a different instrument.   Most synths can produce a wide variety of sound, many of which can be very 'non-musical'. This can be massively overwhelming for those used to more conventional instruments. When we build a patch on our synths we are in a way stepping into the role of audio engineers, using highly technical sound gear to shape sound rather than simply playing an instrument. We 'create'  the instrument then play it. I think perhaps the electric guitar is the closest thing to a synth, with all the combinations of pedals and amps, and it still lacks the ability to do many of the things that a pretty basic synth can do with ease. The people who discredit or dismiss the synth because they are unable to sit right down and play simply don't recognize the potential. Not really their fault either, synthesis is some heady stuff."

This is true to a point, but different techniques do allow for a wider variety of timbres, e.g. pizacatto vs bowing or the many extended technique available to horn players.   The drumset is probably the most configurable acoustic instrument - the tonal variety avaible to you is related to your wallet, DIY resourcefulness, and/or willingness to move equipment."

I'd set a very very short amp envelope, turn up the feedback about halfway, short delay time, long delay length, and use filters to play around with the sound. I'd also maybe keep the volume low until you can tame it, as you could potentially lose control of the sound into heavy feedback.

At first glance, this technique can be viewed as subtractive synthesis based on a feedback loop similar to that of a comb filter for z-transform analysis. However, on the other viewpoint, it can also be viewed as the simplest class of wavetable-modification algorithms now known as digital waveguide synthesis, because the delay line acts to store one period of the signal.  Alexander Strong invented the algorithm, and Kevin Karplus did the first analysis of how it worked. Together they developed software and hardware implementations of the algorithm, including a custom VLSI chip. They named the algorithm ""Digitar"" synthesis, as a portmanteau for ""digital guitar"".

synthesizers,390cu5,slamgauge,5,Tue Jun 9 16:22:04 2015 UTC,"I recently made a patch that tries to emulate the swamatron with my Pro 2. The Swarmatron uses 8 Sine wave oscillators that get pitched up and down to create a hive buzzing sort of tone, I think most people know about it from Trent Reznor's heavy use of it for the Facebook movie soundtrack. Using the four oscillators of the pro 2 I can get a very similar sound.   I set all the oscillators to the same pitch and turned slop up to 10 to get a vco detuning effect. Each oscillator is being pitched up or down by the mod wheel. All the oscillators are set to super triangle which allows you to use the pulse width to control how detuned the wave is, so each oscillator sounds like two detuned oscillators. I set the width to be controlled by the mod wheel here too. So now as you turn up the mod wheel the pitch of all the oscillators spreads out and their shapes detune, which ends up sounding like 8 oscillators.   I also set a bit of glide and put a bit of negative envelope on all the oscillators pitch to approximate the sound of playing on a ribbon controller. Add a bit of delay and you are ready to drone."

synthesizers,390ye3,zentothetenth,6,Mon Jun 8 13:21:58 2015 UTC,"So, I haven't used the Push, but I have a friend who does and I have jammed with him with my Octatrack.  I find the push and the octatrack to be very different beasts. The Push has the capability to power a lot of different things with its pads. VSTs, plugins, drum racks etc. You can go really far with it and new things come out for it all the time.  The Octatrack has some amazing step sequencing, the parameter locks are fascinating, the midi sequencing is great. However I found the Octatrack to be something that you ""program"" and the push to be something that is a bit more of a ""play"" kind of instrument because of the pads. You can play with the octatrack pads, but I found it to be quite rigid in regards to steps - the step sequencing is easier from the get go with it.  Both are deep. The Octatrack is very complex. If you are seeking to eliminate the computer - go for the Octatrack. If you have a mostly hardware set up and want to step sequence everything - go for the Octatrack. If you use mostly software or find that you love to tap on pads, stay with the push."
synthesizers,390ye3,revolved,2,Mon Jun 8 13:40:54 2015 UTC,"I own both and I think this answer is spot on.  While they technically can accomplish similar things, the workflows are so vastly different that I don't see one as a replacement for the other.  Octatrack CAN eliminate a computer from your setup, so if that is your goal, go for it.  Will your push and ableton become useless once you have the Octatrack?  Absolutely not."
synthesizers,390ye3,yeti_jungle,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:29:09 2015 UTC,"I do actually want to take my sample work away from the computer. At this point, the Ableton DAW is just a place for mix and work samples. I find myself being extremely overwhelmed by the limitless of Ableton's sampler, as well as the bright retina screen of my MBP :( The reason I'm forcing myself to choose between them is because the Push seems to be losing its appeal to me. I bought a DSI Tempest (first piece of hardware) so the Push's roll as a drum sequencer was kicked back (especially since the Drum Pads on the Tempest are amazing). Moreover, I feel like the chord mode in Push is like cheating! I don't know theory and despite, that the Push helped me to be extremely productive. This leads me to believe I'll never get around to learning the nuances of theory if I have the Push around to baby me. At this point, the Ableton DAW is just a place for mix and work samples."
synthesizers,390ye3,iwannaquitreddit,2,Mon Jun 8 15:56:44 2015 UTC,"I use my Push in chromatic mode 95% of the time. You don't have to use it in a scale, but you'll have that option there if you want it. I wouldn't worry about being too productive dude!"
synthesizers,390ye3,rush340,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:43:19 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend saving up for a while and buying the Octatrack without selling the Push.  In the mean time, play with the Push while putting some limitations on yourself (i.e. try to make harmonies in chromatic mode, or try to make music with a subset of the features)"
synthesizers,390ye3,3lbFlax,3,Tue Jun 9 03:07:13 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd go for it because I think the OT is probably the best electronic instrument I've ever owned. I haven't used Push, but I do have a Maschine and I'd much rather use the OT.  Obviously you have to be aware of the limitations - you'll be going from virtually limitless polyphony to eight voices, for a start. You won't have any velocity sensitivity, and you won't be able to set up traditional sampling tools like zones.  But the OT compensates for all that. Eight voices sounds meagre, but being able to p-lock the sample per step means you have instant sequencing access to many more sounds, and combined with the various sequencing tricks, p-locks and track effects it's easy to set up a complex beat using just one voice.  It's difficult to know what you mean my 'expressive', and therefore difficult to know if the OT would help you there. There's definitely scope for expression, but I imagine it's a different kind of expression to the Push. You'll be expressing yourself through live sequencing moves, scene changes, effects tweaks and crossfader moves - it's a very technical form of expression, whereas Push gives you velocity and aftertouch and suchlike. And of course they'll take you in different directions.  I think the OT is great for sampling hardware and vinyl. You can have endless fun just setting up one track with recorder trigs and sampling vinyl on the fly. Slicing loops and auto-shuffling is great. Throwing the crossfader in ramps it up even further.  One thing I would say is that I consider the OT a standalone device, or else a master device - which is to say, I never have it synced up to Live or any other DAW. I use it either on its own or have it driving other hardware, either by clock sync or MIDI sequencers. For me, Elektron gear is about getting away from the PC. So if you're planning on staying with Live as your DAW and centrepiece, I don't know how well that works out. Technically I'm sure it works fine, but the OT doesn't feel like a slave device to me. If I'm in Live I'm most likely working with fine edits of waveforms, and that's great and sometimes what you need, but it's a different approach and I don't see the two mixing well (for me).  The OT holds its value well, so you could view it as a low-risk move. I think it's a beautiful tool made by people who love sampling for people who love sampling. But I also prefer my sampling to be on hardware, so bear my mental problems in mind when evaluating my advice."
synthesizers,390ye3,rodentdp,2,Mon Jun 8 15:27:22 2015 UTC,"Sort of. The Octatrack is great for sample mangling and sequencing. Despite the hyperbole of ""Ableton in a box"", it is a different approach and I would not quite compare them. I'm finding that the Octatrack/MPC 1000 combo gets much closer to an Ableton workflow due to scene and track muting.   I've never used a Push tho, and I'm guessing it is a lot easier to use than an Octatrack. The OT is a deep machine, and it will take a good 6 months to a year to probably really get a grip on it, but it is extremely rewarding and unique."
synthesizers,390ye3,scottux,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:22:01 2015 UTC,"You're selling workflow for workflow.

synthesizers,390ye3,slujj-vohaul,2,Mon Jun 8 17:12:32 2015 UTC,"Then I don't think you've fully understood their workflows.   Perhaps a little presumptuous there but okay.   Agree to disagree? I've owned several OP-1s and had the Analog 4 for a couple months. The ""actual interaction"" is up for debate here but I find working with a step based sequencer with p-locks versus recording to a 4-track with a bunch of quirky non-traditional synths to be pretty different."

synthesizers,390ye3,Jaalmakadamia,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"The Octatrack won't be as immediate as Ableton awesome recording/looping features (because interface limitation) and won't be as flexible as the clip mechanism (because again, interface). And it won't host your favorite synth (because hardware).  But on the other hand you get a really dedicated, performance oriented sampler that's really good at its job. And a really clever machine that encourages experimenting, thinking outside the box and happy accidents.  Ableton is a tool but the Octatrack is an instrument. And a very expressive one once you get into live tweaking of encoders and of the crossfader. Prepare for a brutal learning curve though if you have never used grooveboxes."

A lot of its capabilities seem a bit weird in our modern DAW-based, but probably made perfect sense in the early 90s when you needed your midi controller to have all the brains to control which synth is playing which patch.

Couple some very interesting sounding parameters with an almost modular level of modulation routing and it makes for some extremely unique sounds. Even more when you throw in a pair of dual bandpass filters, some FM (called VPM by Korg to avoid a lawsuit), and stick a formant effect unit on the end of the chain. And if you get bored, you can use it as a 2 oscillator plus sub virtual analogue with 2 multimode filters.   The EDP Wasp is one of those analogues that just sounds like nothing else.

Amongst other things, JJOS allows the MPC to see larger cards than the 2 GB given in the Akai OS-I'm using a 32 GB card in mine, which should cover my storage needs fine. The free JJOS allows this, but I would recommend getting JJOSXL sooner than later, as it really transforms the machine into a powerhouse, and it is much more intuitive than the Akai OS. Try to buy one with it already installed, but if it isn't installed you are eventually going to want it, so factor that in. Also factor in that you may have to install a new pad sensor if you get a 1000, and for whatever model you choose you may want to install the fat pads, which I also recommend.

I guess I would trade the MD for a RYTM.  Although the MD sequencer is quite powerful, it lacks micro-timing adjustments. Something the newer elektron boxes tackle quite easily.    Octatrack is my desert island unit.  It'd be the last thing I ever part with."

But I never had an issue with that.  Durability, I can't tell but the 500/1000 feel very toyish compared to a 2K. The 2K is a beast, metal enclosing, a lot of room for the components, no overheating, I really love it.  Compatibility with computer: Well the 500 and 1000 have USB and card reader but like I said you can put one on the 2K.

synthesizers,38xmug,gandahar,3,Sun Jun 7 20:20:18 2015 UTC,JJOS is a third party operating system for the mpc1000 and mpc2500. It greatly expands the capabilities of each machine for only like 125 bucks extra. Apparently the dude that wrote JJOS worked for Akai during the development of both the 1000 and 2500 (basically he wrote the original Akai OS and has since improved each OS separately from Akai as JJOS).

synthesizers,38xmug,alpha_protos,3,Sun Jun 7 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the MV has some insane capabilities. The effects and sample editing functions are really powerful and it's sequencer is really versatile.

synthesizers,38xmug,CajunNate,2,Mon Jun 8 01:57:43 2015 UTC,I have a 500 and really like it. I have it upgraded to the 128 ram and have fat pads installed.

I don't have experience with jjos but the workflow on the 500 is easy to use even though at this point I do most of my chopping and processing ableton and then move it all to the mpc to use live.

I'm going to try that later. Parts are the real answer to OP's question, but I could see 'horizontal slides' having their uses elsewhere..."

Just moving it around your house is enough to jostle a few loose.   Next, you'll want to invest in a new Power supply, because the one that shipped with the Polymoog was under-rated and is probably worse off now due to its age.  Then you'll have something that works... Until a 4000-series logic chip gets a gate stuck open then you'll need to hire a tech to troubleshoot that (At which point you'd better off replacing all of them).  Just buy a Streichfett."

The big damage from water with electronics is short circuiting and therefore blowing components all over the place, but that only happens if power is flowing through them at the time. If they are left long enough to dry completely, there will be no shorts when you switch them back on and it shouldn't particularly shorten the life of your gear.  I'm sure someone with a lot more electronics experience than me will correct me if I'm wrong though, we have a few of them in here!"
synthesizers,38xajb,t0xicd0g,3,Sun Jun 7 17:11:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  You can submerge any electronics in water with no power supply present and provided sufficient drying time, they will be unaffected. A good question to ask however is what climate does OP live in?  If you are in arizona, a day or 2 would be sufficient, Seattle, maybe a month.  Just be absolutely 110% sure it is completely water free before applying power again.

OR if there is water on the boards then you can mist a 50-50 solution of rubbing alcohol and distilled water on the boards.  It will cause the water to evaporate and stop rust from forming on the contacts.  I've never done this method but it's common for phones that have been submerged in water.

synthesizers,38wmap,Jordan_Rago,9,Sun Jun 7 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"A combination of: - excellent build quality - made in Germany (I believe), which has high labor cost - it can take a lot of manpower to develop all of the DSP algorithms, and those development and maintenance/update costs have to be recouped - ultimately they are going to sell it for as much as people will pay"
synthesizers,38wmap,familydogs,7,Sun Jun 7 14:01:11 2015 UTC,"Its the price people are willing to pay, that is true, but there is a little more to it.  The cost of production of a Virus is approximately around US$500 per unit ...  The manpower of development on the DSP?  That is one person: Christoph Kemper, and he has been 'done' with the Virus since 2005, basically .. the rest is just marketing costs which are admittedly not minor - trips to NAMM, FMM, shiny ads in the trade mags, etc.  Keep in mind also that a lot of the cost is in the distribution - all of the people between Kemper Digital and the final brick and mortar store where you buy the physical device need to be paid - in the US there is a distributor channel, in the UK, EU, etc.  These channels all take their cut - and with the fierce competition in the synth market lately, distributors really will drop your product if they can't make at least as close to US$1000 per sale as possible.  This adds up, immensely.    If you want to see cheaper synths, buy direct from the manufacturer and get rid of the middle man.  A lot of people take a piece of that expensive Virus pie .."
synthesizers,38wmap,ibisum,3,Sun Jun 7 14:17:08 2015 UTC,If he has been done with the Virus since 2005 then who has been developing the updates since then? Also what does this mean for any future Virus or another Access synth in general?

synthesizers,38wmap,NEXUS-6-N6MAA10816,3,Sun Jun 7 22:18:36 2015 UTC,A manufacturer has no incentive to undercut what their suppliers sell for. In fact it's probably written in a contract that they can't.   As a manufacturer you're not trying to screw someone who buys 100's of synths to help out someone who buys one.   Now if you send Dave some make-a-wish story maybe he might help you out on the price.

synthesizers,38vu98,Tytatite,7,Sun Jun 7 06:51:47 2015 UTC,"The electronic components that deteriorate the most over time are capacitors. Many dozens, if not hundreds (or even thousands) of these are used in a typical analog synthesizer.  As they deteriorate, they will drift out of tolerance. This will manifest itself in many different ways because capacitors are responsible for so many different things within a synth.  They are used absolutely everywhere, meaning bad ones can potentially have an effect on every part of a synth, from the power supply, to filters and oscillators etc etc.  And in my opinion and experience, the effects are cumulative, in that 1 capacitor out of tolerance might not make a perceivable difference.. But a couple of dozen or more ageing capacitors most certainly will make a difference.  Its not impossible for other components to degenerate too, but it happens to a much lesser degree."
synthesizers,38vu98,SonicHooligan,7,Sun Jun 7 14:20:47 2015 UTC,"Note that capacitors have many different operational values that change over time.  In most cases the capacitance value has a 10-20% tolerance and you will generally find most old capacitors still to be within the tolerance there.  What changes far more significantly over time is leakage and ESR.  The most common effect here is change in the biasing of any transistor circuits, and it is this change in biasing that causes the sonic changes."
synthesizers,38vu98,FullFrontalNoodly,4,Sun Jun 7 15:33:50 2015 UTC,"And thus you get situations such as oscillators being out of tune with each others, the generated waveforms being slightly different, filters having slightly different timbres, and cutoffs and etc. Ultimately everything gets affected as it ages unless it is some digital part of the synth. That is also why some people say that the ms-20mini doesn't sound exactly like the original. That sound difference is partly comes from 35+ year old components."
synthesizers,38vu98,Roykeru,3,Sun Jun 7 15:13:34 2015 UTC,"Right :) Another example.. I recently built a TTSH (ARP 2600 clone). Does it sound exactly like an original? It's certainly close, but not nailed. But I'll bet the clone sounds very much like an original did when it was new. The clone also has rock solid tuning and tracks perfectly to 5 or more octaves. Lets see if it still does in 40 years time ;)"
synthesizers,38vu98,SonicHooligan,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:49:32 2015 UTC,"I always thought they should put an age knob on the ms-20 mini. As you turn it, the sound gets gross and sloppy."
synthesizers,38vu98,crowby,2,Sun Jun 7 18:22:40 2015 UTC,It is not just capacitors. Even the doping in CMOS chips will change over time. Low tolerance resistors will also drift in value.

synthesizers,38vu98,differentclass,2,Sun Jun 7 15:42:55 2015 UTC,One other simple thing that gets overlooked is the fact that trimpots can move with transport over time.

The claps don't sound right and the toms' tuning is a bit limited - I'd like to tune those 808 toms way way down for sub basslines and up for added high perc.   On the plus side the kick is clicky gorgeous and the snare, perc and hats sound lovely too.   Bit of a mixed bag for me since I'm using it more for production rather than live performance."
synthesizers,38sxcq,NEXUS-6-N6MAA10816,8,Sat Jun 6 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"I don't get it, you couldn't tune the 808's toms down to a sub bass either, so why is this a negative? Anybody who wants to use a TR808 or TR8 to make sub-bass is going to go with the kick as you can control and shape the sound way more than you can the toms."
synthesizers,38sxcq,t0xicd0g,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:56:31 2015 UTC,"Depends, if you want a continuous standing wave then fine, use the kick. But if you want to make a groove out of the sub frequencies then 808 toms are more useful. Also this argument that just because you couldn't do something on the original is bogus when the TR8 is a digital remake and thus could be easily implemented."
synthesizers,38sxcq,NEXUS-6-N6MAA10816,3,Sun Jun 7 06:09:39 2015 UTC,"Remake being the key word. Chewing something out that is a remake for not doing something the original didn't do suggests you're probably just looking at the wrong product for your needs. Try a Machinedrum instead, or a synth."
synthesizers,38sxcq,jp650,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:58:55 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of things about the TR8 - I'm not dissing it entirely. I just like having more extended control over parameters in general as it can open up new possibilities."
synthesizers,38sxcq,NEXUS-6-N6MAA10816,5,Sun Jun 7 07:22:21 2015 UTC,"Hence my suggestion that instead of looking to a recreation of a fairly limited if classic sounding drum machine, you would be much better served with a dedicated synth or something like a Machinedrum. Software wise, you also can't go far wrong with Sonic Charge's Microtonic - it actually lets you tune every aspect of drum synthesis (base wave, noise and filter) to whatever note you want, which makes it perfect for pitched sub bass stuff."

synthesizers,38sxcq,t0xicd0g,3,Sun Jun 7 05:47:20 2015 UTC,Yes. This video was very helpful.
synthesizers,38sxcq,Que_Nada,5,Sun Jun 7 21:17:31 2015 UTC,"I like the TR-8, but it annoys me so much that there isn't a song mode.  Hopefully Roland will release that soon during an update, but we NEED song mode."
synthesizers,38sxcq,mynameisthemaster1,7,Sat Jun 6 18:33:14 2015 UTC,"The only people I ever knew who used song mode on drum machines were worship leaders at churches. What happens if you're in the middle of your super-programmed song, and you feel like doing the bridge or breakdown part again? Well, too bad, because you've programmed it to got A-A-B-B-A-B-A-A-C. It's all about live tweaking and pattern switching on the fly - let's sets and performances be more fluid."
synthesizers,38sxcq,t0xicd0g,4,Sat Jun 6 20:37:26 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, and that's totally understandable.  But the main reason I bought the drum machine is because I kind of wanted that.  I wanted to have drum patterns play by itself, without any help from a computer (kind of like Big Black performances), and I wanted the computer itself to send MIDI to synthesizers while I sing/play bass/guitar.  It'd just be easier for live performance.  It's totally my fault for not looking for that though.  And what church did you go to?  Every praise band I've seen at a church has a live drummer, haha"
synthesizers,38sxcq,jahreed,3,Sun Jun 7 03:14:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I see your points.   I became the drummer at the church I went to because we were all so sick of the drum machine. Lol. :)
synthesizers,38sxcq,t0xicd0g,5,Sun Jun 7 04:15:55 2015 UTC,"The originals didn't have song mode either. The TR8 is aimed at a much more pattern based style of playing than the usual sequencer. It would be useful, but I can't see Roland giving it to us in an update any time soon."
synthesizers,38sxcq,jahreed,4,Sat Jun 6 18:40:21 2015 UTC,I think you can utilize MIDI via the USB to get a song mode of sorts.

synthesizers,38sxcq,Que_Nada,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:16:06 2015 UTC,You can always just make a blank pattern and let FL play the actual notes for the drum beats. I sequence my TR8 through Cubase rather than use the internal sequencer as it's more critically accurate when it comes to placing everything square on the beat. I'm nitpicky and can hear differences in drumbeats of several milliseconds and it drives me mad if it's not quite keeping tight in.
synthesizers,38sxcq,hobbbz,3,Sun Jun 7 17:15:04 2015 UTC,Midi triggering notes from your computer is tighter than the internal tr-8 sequencer triggering itself? How is that possible?  or are you clocking the TR8 via midi clock and the drifting you hear is the midi jitter from cubase?
synthesizers,38sxcq,preservation82,2,Mon Jun 8 18:04:09 2015 UTC,"Because Roland decided to go full analogue modelling, even down to the timing of the sequencer. The latest update apparently lets you change this from analogue timing to digital timing which should be perfect. When I was doing multiple passes to record kick, snare and hats to separate channels (I know I could pipe them in separately via USB, but the project was already set up in 48k mode and i didn't want to have to resample every audio track) I could hear when the kick and snare were slightly out from one pass to the next."

synthesizers,38sxcq,thedrexel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:15:29 2015 UTC,"It does have separate outs, but at that point I didn't have a multitrack sound interface so everything was single passes.

When done ""right"" (hint: there's no wrong) it's like a gated shepard tone with some lush stereo delay on it.   I can't recreate BoC:s version. But I made my ""own"". (I just realised it's quite possible BoC actually samples Kraftwerk there.)  Since the feel of it is very much down to how you choose to play it, there's endless variations. But one basic version is to go c d e f e f g h g h c d etc. add fx and stir. play around with it. find something you like.  Note: this isn't synthesis at all, this is composition. So maybe you're after something else entirely.   Edit: I just realised I often used key tracking on the filter so the lower notes have less high frequency content. That adds an ""underwater"" association, it's lighter closer to the surface. Hope this gave you a starting point for exploration."

Thanks for the help, by the way. Oh, and is the Kraftwerk song you're talking about the beginning of Spacelab?"
synthesizers,38v5fc,NEXUS-6-N6MAA10816,2,Sun Jun 7 04:39:38 2015 UTC,"I've been messing around trying to find this sound for the last hour or so.  You are right about the pitch changing. It's integral to the sound. I tried a couple of things on the Virus. I set both osc to sine (think tri and sq could work too). Then started pitching the first osc with an lfo going around a quarter note speed so that it starts going up more than it should as the notes are played. I tried doing the same thing with mismatched pitch keyfollow and it didn't sound right so it's definitely an lfo. Slapped on an arp with up, a high resolution and 4 octave settings. Play a four note chord on one hand inside one octave.  Then a lowpass with key follow, little bit of resonance. Lots of delay and a bit of reverb.   Should be able to do most of that on any 2 osc synth.  That should get you somewhere in the ballpark but you'll need to play around with everything until you hit that wubbly warbly kinda sound.   On a sidenote, there's tons of other cool possibilities when you start mangling the pitch during an arp sequence. Fun stuff."
synthesizers,38v5fc,brock0791,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:27:40 2015 UTC,Some delays have a pitch up or down option to the repeats.  Make Noise Echophon is an example

synthesizers,38uool,darkholler,3,Sat Jun 6 23:55:44 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! I'm kind of jealous.   1) I've never used Sample & Hold, any ideas on how to get the most out of this function?   Sample and hold is a way of getting stepped random voltages, and is useful wherever you want to direct a stepped random control voltage. The classic S&H patch is ""robot talking"": direct the output of the S&H module to filter cutoff. With a bit of resonance, you'll recognize the sound when you hear it.    2) Also, it has a CV, Gate, Trigger In/Out on the back. Any resources explaining how to explore these functions, or just dive in, throw another synth or drum machine though the Axxe?   CV for oscillator pitch, one volt per octave (V/Oct). The gate will trigger envelope generators. If it has CV/Gate OUT, you will be able to control other analog (v/Oct) gear with it. If it has CV/Gate IN, you can likewise use other such gear to control it. With an appropriate interface, you can even control it from a computer (My Akai Max Pro 49 controller has a USB MIDI to CV/Gate interface, so that would do it).   3) I've read about the ARP Little Brother, and am looking to buy one, but since they seem really rare, is there anything that could take its place? I'd like to fatten up the single oscillator and have perhaps other waveforms, detuning abilities, playing in octaves or fifths. Would something like the Moog FreqBox or a modular VCO work?   The Axxe uses conventional V/Oct and CV. If you want another oscillator, you could patch a micro brute into it. It should also play well with Eurorack stuff.  Have fun! There's a PDF of the manual here"
synthesizers,38uool,ouij,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:49:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm planning on sitting down tomorrow with the manual, the brute and some other boxes and see what goes where. I feel like this is where the fun begins. But there's something to be said about the sound character, like early Harold Budd, something that I've heard in recordings of modular setups-- just letting the key hold function drone on while the slightest movement on a slider controls the evolution of sound.  I'm chasing that second oscillator though, haha.   I have no problem with digital gear, and in some songs prefer it. Being an analog purist, I get it. This is a living instrument."
synthesizers,38uool,ScottFromCanada,3,Sun Jun 7 02:46:20 2015 UTC,"I wont write a book here, it's late and I'm tired from replacing the display in my K2000, so in short....  I got an Axxe almost exactly 1 year ago.... holy crap. I just checked the email, it was EXACTLY one year ago, june 6, 2014! I think it's the older version with the Moog filter and it sounds AMAZING! I use it all the time.   I tried putting a second oscillator through it from my modular and I didn't like it. I prefer it as is. But the trigger and CV outs worked exactly as expected, except I think they were reversed on mine. Out was in, and in was out.  If yours has the same keyboard as mine, it will have 2 J-wires. One for cv and they other for trigger. That means if you hold a lower note and hit a higher note, you can get the envelope to refire every time you hit a key. That means you really have to lift your fingers to play it cleanly. I end up retriggering almost every note I play when I'm playing up a scale!  Mine also came in a flight case, the original Anvil case it was sold with in 1975. Very cool!   https://flic.kr/p/nE7xXP  I keep it right beside my desk since I use it all the time. You can see it in the background of this pic.  https://flic.kr/p/tsQDqw  There's no foam in my case either, and when I first opened it, it smelled like a chain smoker lived inside it! It's better now but could use some new foam, so I'm also interested in where you buy it."
synthesizers,38uf17,nelisb,8,Sat Jun 6 22:31:17 2015 UTC,"The ESX will be completely redundant if you get an Octatrack, sell that. I would prob get rid of the 404 as well but keep the MPC 1000 so you still have something with pads."
synthesizers,38uf17,slamgauge,3,Sun Jun 7 00:15:16 2015 UTC,"That's my suggestion as well. And buy JJOS2XL if you haven't already. With that and the Octatrack, you've got pretty much everything you could ever want for sampling and sequencing."
synthesizers,38uf17,rodentdp,2,Sun Jun 7 01:08:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely this! Plus, the MPC will give you a good alternate sequencer to use with the Octatrack."
synthesizers,38uf17,the_cody,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:01:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! The only reason I am hesitant to sell the ESX is because the ease of panning, adding effects, and recording knob automation is. It makes creating drum sounds quite easy for me. Whereas with the MPC, i understand the pads are a plus, but actually creating a kit in it can be a bit of a menu-scrolling pain. Is the Octatrack capable of everything the ESX is basically? I tend to only use my ESX for drums and the keyboard functionality, and the 8-track limitation of the Octatrack worries me in that I might use up all my tracks with drum sounds. Could always just get better at MPC drums though. Thanks!"
synthesizers,38uf17,slamgauge,2,Sun Jun 7 18:03:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah the octatrack can do everything the ESX does. The octatrack is like an ESX on steroids, meth and viagra.   Don't worry about the number of tracks, 8 may seem like a small number but each track is so flexible you really won't need that many. For example there are things called octachains, basically a long sample with a lot of samples in it. Each octachain can have 64 samples that you can play at any time and switch between effortlessly. You can also change the sample that is being played per trigger, so you can play any sample on the machine on any track at any time.   Confused yet? Well here is how I do my drums. I use just three tracks for all my percussion. Track 1 is an octachain of 64 kicks, track 2 is 64 snares and track 3 is an octachain of 64 different percussion sounds like hats and toms, etc. So three tracks and all the drums are taken care of."
synthesizers,38uf17,hoopzs,3,Sun Jun 7 18:33:55 2015 UTC,"If I were in your position I would sell the SP 404 and Electribe SX.  The Octatrack pays for itself just by its ability to sequence and mangle samples and loops, which I think will make your SP 404 and Electribe SX the most redundant. I can't really say as I haven't owned either, just vaguely familiar with them.  I think one of the Octatrack's weaker points is its ability to record and sample external audio. It works fine for sampling another piece of gear and evolving the sound further, but I would never try and sample other music with it. If I wanted to for example, cut out some drum or vocal samples off a vinyl record, I would take the MPC over the Octatrack any day of the week. If you don't use your MPC like that you might be able to replace it with an Octatrack as well."
synthesizers,38uf17,gcheliotis,2,Sun Jun 7 00:23:04 2015 UTC,Why is it not suitable for sampling music?
synthesizers,38uf17,the_cody,3,Sun Jun 7 02:03:35 2015 UTC,"Though I've never used an MPC, the Octatrack sampling couldn't really be much easier. If you're not actively performing and are just working in the studio (in other words, the normal environment in which you would be sampling something that isn't synced), you just record to a track buffer. It's pretty much dead simple.  Record, edit, save and assign. Done.  Again, I've not used an MPC, but I've watched plenty of videos of people sampling with them ... and I see no real advantage in that workflow for sampling ""music"" (as opposed to other gear).  But, to each their own.  This is similar enough to the ""sampling music"" idea: http://youtu.be/QJ1kMQKt_rY"
synthesizers,38uf17,hoopzs,2,Sun Jun 7 08:08:07 2015 UTC,The UI of a MPC and a UI of the Octatrack are both conducive to contrasting styles of sampling and beat making.
synthesizers,38uf17,BonjourMyFriends,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:03:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Yeah I agree that the 404 will definitely be redundant. Most of the time I just use it to trigger pre-recorded samples, hardly ever any actually production going on with it. In regards to the MPC, I have yet to find a comfortable method of sampling vocals with it, or processing samples inside. It just seems like the only sound manipulation the MPC really offers is stretch and pitch. And two master effects. Right now I'm kind of thinking the ESX will compliment the Octatrack and vice versa more so than the MPC. Maybe it's just me. Thanks for your input, It's very helpful."
synthesizers,38uf17,cherubthrowaway,2,Sun Jun 7 18:10:26 2015 UTC,"I think the MPC 1000 is a far more interesting and capable version of the SP-404. Likewise, the Octatrack does pretty much everything the ESX does but blows it out of the water. I'd sell the SP-404 and ESX. I do love the ESX for it's immediacy, but I don't think I'd miss it much if I had an Octatrack instead. With JJOS2XL for the MPC and an Octatrack you'd have an extremely powerful and versatile setup."

Yes, you can tell that it's not a Mini (the oscillators stay in tune too well) but in a mix, in a track, nobody will care.  Oddity does a very good job of sounding like an Odyssey; they also did a cracking job on the ImpOSCar VST too, they have a good ear for capturing the raw 'feel' of those synths. Again, they don't sound identical, but in a track... Not had a chance to play with Oddity 2 yet, but the idea of a polyphonic Odyssey certainly has my interest piqued.  Not a direct copy of anything, but Diva sounds analogue as hell. It can sound big and round and warm and has modulation routings coming out of its ears.

The best way to fix it is to disassemble and manually clean them out, chemical contact cleaners don't work all that well. Buy yourself a desoldering and soldering iron from radioshack for 30 bucks, find a 50 cent piece of electronics to practice on at goodwill, and then do it yourself! You will have to desolder 6 or so points per switch, carefully remove it from the board, use a small screwdriver to pry back the little metal tabs that hold the halves of the switch together, open it and use rubbing alcohol to get whatever gunk is in there mostly out, and then a pencil eraser to get off the rest. Reassemble, reinstall.  Desoldering is a bit of a pain in the ass but 60's are well spaced out, easy to work on synths. If you have to buy all of the tools and solder to do it yourself it'll be less than $50 and a new skill learned and tools gained, vs a couple hundred to have a shop do it."

synthesizers,38nuq1,damien6,10,Fri Jun 5 22:27:20 2015 UTC,"Here's the new discovery I just made about my new synth (Roland Aira System 1m)...   Thank you for your email. When on a Windows machine, you will need to find a DAW that is VST3 compatible for the PLUG-OUT process. Normally you can download a free demo of a compatible Windows DAW, such as FL Studio or Studio One 3. After you do the PLUG-OUT process, you won't need to do it again unless you want to load a different PLUG-OUT.  Please let us know if you have any questions.    Yep, I just learned that if you're on a Windows machine using Ableton Live, you cannot use the Plug Out feature because Live does not support VST3.    Edit: I just got a response from Ableton regarding VST3 support:   Thanks for contacting Ableton Support, and thank you also for writing in about this. Request for VST3 support is one of the more common wishes we receive, and it's definitely something our developers are aware of.  Unfortunately, at this time I am unable to say if or when VST3 support would be implemented in Live.  To bring further attention to feature suggestions, we would encourage you to visit the Ableton Centercode forum where you can post your opinions on the Suggestions page."
synthesizers,38nuq1,ElMayonnaise,6,Fri Jun 5 17:20:10 2015 UTC,"This should be up higher. Seeing as Ableton Live is arguably the most popular DAW on the market, it really should be supporting VST 3.   But why Roland didn't include 2.4 support is equally as silly."
synthesizers,38nuq1,damien6,9,Fri Jun 5 18:11:37 2015 UTC,The dumbest thing is that Roland includes a license for Ableton Live Lite with the System 1m.  They include a DAW that doesn't even support the product.
synthesizers,38nuq1,rodentdp,2,Fri Jun 5 18:12:58 2015 UTC,"Wait...what? I know the Aira Plug-Out system has its supporters around here, but that is such a glaring oversight IMHO."

The only thing that really bugs me is that I get hanging notes at times.  I trigger it using MIDI from Ableton Live through a MOTU MIDI Express 128 and when I stop playing in Ableton a note will continue on occasion.  The key has to be re-triggered to shut it off.  I don't know if it's an issue with my System 1m or my MIDI Express or what...  Not a huge issue for me, though."

synthesizers,38nuq1,t0xicd0g,5,Fri Jun 5 14:44:59 2015 UTC,"That's the beauty, there's no point having two synths that sound the same. The Brute is great for hard abrasive sounds, the MS2000 is a great do-everything synth. You just need to spend more time with them and learn which ones do which sort of roles best for your music."

synthesizers,38nuq1,t0xicd0g,3,Fri Jun 5 21:18:18 2015 UTC,"It is, but even at it's gentlest the filter isn't strong in bass frequencies so compared to other synths (my AX73, Tetra and Volca Bass all have much more bass presence) it always sounds a bit harder and more mid-range."

synthesizers,38nuq1,sheboygan_sexpo,7,Sun Jun 7 01:08:06 2015 UTC,"Does anybody feel like they've found their synth? The one that just becomes an extension of who you are and writes songs/sounds for you? One that no matter what you do to it, you're happy with the result and can just listen to the new patch you made for hours on end?  The timeline of my synth experience and exposure started only back in October (so my venture has only just begun), but it wasn't until I acquired the Sub 37 that I truly felt complacent. GAS was driving me crazy. Everything I saw and learned about just had to be purchased and played. I've limited my purchases so far to only 5 different synths, but that unquenchable feeling has subsided (for now). Every god damn time I sit down to play the Sub 37 I feel inspired. It has yet to not make me think ""God damn that's a cool sound."" It's not as versatile as a Blofeld, and obviously being duo-phonic has it's limitations, but writing on it has been such an effortless pleasure. I'm coming up with stuff I'd have never imagined on anything else I've played. It just...resonates so well with me.  I'm sure the GAS will be back... but for now, I'm really quite happy being content with what I have. I'm hoping most of you have felt this at least once before."
synthesizers,38nuq1,rodentdp,6,Fri Jun 5 16:14:27 2015 UTC,"That was how I felt when I got my Octatrack-like they built a machine just for me. I'm getting a similar feeling with my MPC, but I still have to put in some time with that one."
synthesizers,38nuq1,sheboygan_sexpo,4,Fri Jun 5 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"The Octatrak is such a foreign instrument to me. I know it can be amazing, but I feel like I wouldn't quite get it unless somebody was there in person to demonstrate it's capabilities.   I'm sure that once I was familiar with the workflow, it'd be fantastic."
synthesizers,38nuq1,rodentdp,5,Fri Jun 5 17:58:07 2015 UTC,"It is deep and I would say that it'll take most people at least around 6 months of regular use to really get it down, at least to the point that they don't need to keep the manual at hand all the time. It took me much less time, but I was already familiar with the Machinedrum and Monomachine.   Incidentally, I received my OT a year ago today according to Facebook, after a 6 month wait in the great OctaDrought of 2014. Kinda nutty to look at how far I've come with it in a year, and how much I still have to learn."
synthesizers,38nuq1,sheboygan_sexpo,2,Fri Jun 5 18:30:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's that commitment I don't currently have the patience for.

If I had the Octatrak, I feel like I'd never get a song done--but just endlessly mess with it forever."
synthesizers,38nuq1,TheGreatWildFrontier,2,Fri Jun 5 20:00:49 2015 UTC,"Still looking for mine, so the GAS continues. Right now my go to is the Audiothingies P6.

Haven't had the chance to play the Sub 37, but it seems majestic."
synthesizers,38nuq1,sheboygan_sexpo,2,Fri Jun 5 17:53:19 2015 UTC,"Most demos and stuff I hear on the Sub 37 don't really focus on the weird. It wasn't until I got my hands on one that I realized it was going to be able to do a lot more than I thought it would be capable of. I find myself making ambient/drone patches way more than a conventional bass, or lead patch.   But you don't need a Sub 37 to get weird. Have you checked out demos by Jexus? He's the undisputed king of pushing a synth far beyond it's conventional limits. First video I saw of his was the ESQ-1. At the time, I was contemplating getting a synth and was curious how weird I could take it... The answer, for a lot of synths, is pretty damn weird if you try."
synthesizers,38nuq1,TheGreatWildFrontier,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:10:00 2015 UTC,"I hear you on that, I've been frustrated so many times that gear demos don't show the true range or weirdness of an instrument. I'm really intrigued that it can get a lot weirder from what I've heard then. I haven't checked his demos, but I just bookmarked them for post-work watching tonight. Thanks!"
synthesizers,38nuq1,sheboygan_sexpo,2,Fri Jun 5 18:20:08 2015 UTC,"No problemo. The reviews on his site are pretty unique, to say the least, but he's undoubtedly good at making truly remarkable patches."
synthesizers,38nuq1,kirklandish,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"It's only been a day, but I'm really digging the Mopho. So far my favorite part is being able to assign multiple things to both the mod and pitch wheels in varying amounts, to create some patches that you can really play the sound with.  I was just experimenting with disabeling global pitch on the pitch bend, but setting it to osc 2 frequency on a low depth and cutoff on higher depth. The mod wheel is set to LFO 1 controlling PWM and also feedback gain.   It's pretty awesome to have so much control over the modulation, plus I think it  sounds great. This thing just demands lots of experimentation."

synthesizers,38nuq1,a_disco_ball,2,Fri Jun 5 15:40:08 2015 UTC,very cool.  is it intuitive to program?
synthesizers,38nuq1,kisielk,3,Fri Jun 5 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if ""intuitive"" is the right word really, you probably wouldn't be able to get through it without using the manual. However once you go through the tutorial and learn how it works it's extremely fast and easy to work with. Pretty fast to learn too I guess, since I've only played with it for a few hours and am already feeling quite familiar with it. It's really easy to tweak patterns and come up with variations, and then arrange them in to scenes and songs.   So far I set it up to control my Tempest and Nord Drum in drum mode, another track for Tempest in synth mode, one for the Pro2, one for the Prophet 12. The Nord Drum and Prophet 12 also have local off and midi out going back to the Cirklon so they can act as controllers for the active track.  Still haven't dug in to connecting the CVIO breakout box to my modular and I have a few more MIDI pieces (Evolver and Streichfett) to add. But basically looks like I can run my whole studio from this one box without touching the computer except for recording, which is exactly what I wanted :)"

At this point I am forbidding myself from buying any synths or other sound creation hardware for a long time. I feel like I have a sufficient set-up to create the music I want to make.   The next step for me is getting some stands and such, so I can create a more optimal creative space. I really want to orient myself towards standing versus sitting, since I have more energy and thus enjoy myself more when I am not hunched over a desk. Need something for the Mopho, Push, and my laptop.  With my own music I think it is less a struggle to find a sound and more of a struggle to put all the little bits and pieces into well structured compositions, but I realize that takes time. I had a big musical breakthrough when recording with my band last weekend - I improvised on the keyboard. Most of the improv came from recovering from mistakes, but instead of sounding bad I discovered how I want to play the parts. I will be spending a fair amount of time this weekend working on the recording, so I am excited about that."

I bought the boards and EPROMs in 2007 and only started to built a few months ago.  I at one point suggested about $800 in the 9090 FB group which seemed to be the consensus.  You can buy one ready-built from Poland for €909.  My estimate included the PCBs, EPROMs, and the case, which I have not settled on yet for my build as I'm still arranging the front panel with mods.  The case is the most expensive part, and some people have even built theirs in a cardboard box!  The standard build is a 2U rack, but mine is currently around 5-6U with all controls and sockets on the front for easy access. Keep in mind that this project alone does not include a sequencer, for that you might consider adding the MB-909 from http://www.synthage.com/  Edit: I can look at my Mouser history and see how much I've spent on this project with them, but some parts I had to find elsewhere"

The CV mod I did (per Analogue Solutions mod kit) isn't very good at all.  So, I'd like to know how Tip Top did theirs.  Then again, I think I can use one of my vactrol modules for that.  You can't actually build a complete 808 or 909 set with their modules though.  I almost bought their 808 kick one day last year, but paid a bill instead.

The students are working on recording their own version of the song and being that it's kind of a psychedelic track, the idea was to get some synth sounds in place of whatever was used for those trippy sounds in Bowie's track.  Now, I'm not a gigging musician but more of a bedroom producer so I was nervous, but here's the take away from this session. It wasn't about my performance as much as it was about capturing the sounds that went with the track. Sure I played some chords and did some noodling but because of the direction I was getting from my friend, the track sounded really cool! The Moog Sub Phatty was doing sort of a deep sub bass and some noodling parts in the upper frequencies. The Novation Ultranova was doing several different big pads.

I've got literally no music prepared. I'm feeling really confident and determined though. I've DJed there the last few years so I already know the crowd and feel of the festival. I've recently got my setup to where it can do everything I want and I'm confident at translating my ideas into music on it all.  I've got to narrow down my gear to just a couple items for this. The festival's on an island and I also need to bring a tent (don't worry, the synths will sleep indoors). I'm thinking all this will fit in a case, maybe a couple items packed well in my hiking backpack:   MPC1000 for sequencing, drums and samples Blofeld for multi-timbral synth Mininova for MIDI keyboard and synth Kenton Control Freak 16-knob controller small mixer + RNC compressor (need to buy both)   I'm realizing more and more how much the MPC really is the heart of my setup, and that one day I could even do a set with it alone, but the above is the best small setup for maximizing the sound and how fun the performance is.  My Moog Minitaur, Machinedrum UW, Monotribe and a load of effects pedals are my other main machines that might have to sit this one out. I'll be missing the Minitaur's bass, but it's exactly the same size as the Kenton 16-knob controller and that's more valuable here.  I got the MPC in August, followed by everything else. After learning everything one-by-one, til now I've mainly been doing somewhat unstructured jams on all the gear. I create sequences for the day, but I never saved them until this week. I've really figured out my workflow recently, which is working pretty much solo on the MPC at first to do beats, then connect to the Blofeld desktop, then finishing up by bringing them both to the studio and re-doing some parts with actual keys on other synths later. Limiting myself to just a few machines keeps me more focused on composing tracks rather than trying to play everything at once.  Excited! I needed a goal."
synthesizers,38nuq1,revolved,3,Fri Jun 5 14:53:05 2015 UTC,"Right on, this sounds cool. I would recommend keeping it simple! You can always sample from the gear you don't want to bring and load it into the MPC.   For mixers, try to grab something with PFL and/or fx sends - it's really important for live work."
synthesizers,38nuq1,thatdiscosound,3,Fri Jun 5 15:19:00 2015 UTC,"Agree about limitations. Too much gear can be a distraction.  As for the live set, that's awesome. Congratulations. I've listened to your youtube videos - like them a lot - and was thinking you'd be really great live. Very happy for you."
synthesizers,38nuq1,beardslap,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:20:40 2015 UTC,Might I suggest the MX-1 as a mixer? I don't know what sort of budget you're looking at but for a performance orientated mixer it's great. The inputs are a bit miserly but looking at your gear list that shouldn't be too much of a problem.
synthesizers,38nuq1,BonjourMyFriends,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:51:09 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more along the lines of a Allen & Heath Zed 10FX. To be honest I have never inspected the MX-1 because it didn't really occur to me it would integrate well with non-Aira gear. Are there any videos of that? I'm intrigued, what are the pros and cons of an MX-1 versus a regular mixer?"
synthesizers,38nuq1,beardslap,2,Fri Jun 5 16:33:44 2015 UTC,"I actually did a (very amateur) first impressions vid of it a while ago. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9qga3nEle4  I've only got the TR-8 when it comes to Aira but it works well enough with my other gear, the only thing that's a bit limiting is the number of inputs - you'll get 4 mono inputs and a 3.5mm stereo in.  What's great about it is MIDI syncing and sequencing effects and it's 'playability'. It's totally designed around live performance and being able to store and recall 'scenes' makes it really easy to both be spontaneous in a live situation and have elements planned.  I really dig it, but I can understand the frustration at unused channels if you're not using Aira gear.  EDIT: after watching a bit of that video for the first time in ages I should probably do an update - I'd only had it a day and hadn't really used it much, so I sound like an idiot."
synthesizers,38nuq1,TheUglyHobo,3,Fri Jun 5 16:55:56 2015 UTC,"I've slowly been getting onto modding my Gakken, but since I don't have a sequencer to use yet I haven't bothered adding CV control. In the meantime, I added a switch to turn it on for doing drones and stuff, and and through some effects (mostly overdrive and delay) it actually sounds really great. It's my first real analog synth and it's an absolute blast to be able to be able to twiddle the knobs and stuff. I'm really looking forward to eventually picking up a Beatstep so I can sequence it, the audio rate LFO makes some really great sounds that would sound perfect for the kind of music I make.  I also really want to get around to adding a patch bay to my SR-16 so I can get nasty industrial sounds out of it, but I just haven't had the time yet. Soon..."

synthesizers,38nuq1,TheUglyHobo,3,Fri Jun 5 15:32:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah the switch is to hold a single note so I can just play with the knobs.

synthesizers,38nuq1,rodentdp,3,Sat Jun 6 07:06:23 2015 UTC,"Got an E-Mu Turbo Phatt, installed the Composer ROM I had from a Proteus 2000, and have been working my way through the manual. This thing is DEEP! It's going to take a while until I can become proficient with programming it, but lots of potential in this little box. But it has presented me with another problem, in that the unit has 32 midi channels across two midi inputs. Since I've recently gotten an MPC 1000 which sends out 32 midi channels across two outputs, this shouldn't be a problem for sequencing...but I run everything through a couple of midi patchbays, and the MPC isn't my only sequencer, so I'm getting a headache trying to just get Channel 1A on the MPC to play 1A on the E-Mu, without also triggering 1B. Ugh. Considering maybe getting something that doesn't use a computer for routing (I currently use an Emagic Unitor8 MkII and AMT8, and the matrix router of the third party editor I use isn't the most intuitive thing) as a front end for all of my input devices, maybe something like the Kawai MAV-8 to just switch things at will to everything connected to the Emagics. I really need to find some kind of patchbay/thru box/router with some advance filtering and routing options.   /u/the_cody has pretty much convinced me to sell my Machinedrum UW to buy an Analog Four/Keys, but I think I'm going to wait a moment before I do anything. I think I need to just work with the setup I have for a minute and actually write some music, as I've been in this acquisitional stage for a couple of months now."
synthesizers,38nuq1,revolved,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:03:33 2015 UTC,Maybe an iConnect 2+ to make sense of all the midi?  Also I want to hear you use all 32 channels of midi hahahaha
synthesizers,38nuq1,rodentdp,2,Fri Jun 5 16:06:12 2015 UTC,"I could use 16 tracks for drums alone, man-if you can see the gear in my flair, it'd be easy. But it isn't so much that I need to have 32 channels at once, but more about having the flexibility if needed. For instance, I could use the 8 midi tracks of the Octatrack for some things, 8 tracks from the MPC for others, and devote all of port B on the MPC to control the back 16 tracks on the Turbo Phatt. That isn't including the FX units I have that I never control via midi because of a lack of ports."

A big boy synth is way down on the list of things to buy (it's trailing well below my first home and new scooter so it's gonna be a while.)  Turns out my buddy left a fully functional Ensonic EPS and then moved 500 miles away. So. It's mine. I know how to use it. I can grab samples, filter, set up envelopes and such, but I'm having a hard time coming up with ways to use it.  If anyone has any workflow tips or cool ideas for things to sample, I'd be all ears. So far, I have a cool sample of an Indian prayer bowl. Kinnd if sounds like an ethereal mellotron.  Looking for more of a synth type workflow. I like one shot sampling, but I already have a DAW and MPD32 for that express purpose."

My only gripe is the short attack time, but I can always patch in another EG.  Can't wait for my Memory Boy to get here. Anyone have any experience with that combo?"
synthesizers,38nuq1,jahreed,2,Fri Jun 5 17:54:10 2015 UTC,What do you mean by short attack time?  is your env. clicking or are you having problems creating slow swells?   for me the fun of my mB multiplied when i got it synced via midi or gate in (with the sequencer setup to step on gate).  Any monosynth is going to thank you for adding some delay/verb to the mix.
synthesizers,38nuq1,ph_wolverine,3,Fri Jun 5 18:14:03 2015 UTC,The latter problem. The Max attack time is nowhere near long enough for any meaningful pads. Not that I do much of that anyway...

synthesizers,38nuq1,rodentdp,2,Fri Jun 5 19:09:18 2015 UTC,"I had the Memory Boy and Microbrute for a few weeks, until I returned the Brute (great little synth, just not what I needed in my setup). Patched the LFO out to the expression/CV in on the EHX a few times for modulation. To be honest, I found that the Behringer Vintage Delay sounded a bit better with the Brute, as the Memory Boy is a bit dark in tone and I found the output a smidge too muddy. The Brute really takes well to effects, probably better than any other synth I've played, so you'll still be quite happy with the Memory Boy.   A tip on the Memory Boy: plug in a cable or headphone adaptor or something into the expression input, even if you aren't sending it CV. It will greatly extend the feedback range. Without it, I can only turn the feedback knob to about 2 o'clock before it starts oscillating, but I can turn it to around 4-5 with a plug in the input."

Not exactly a synth discovery, but i was having a look ay my Boss SYB-5 Bass Synth padal, trying to figure out if i could somehow change the momentary switch to a toggle switch, so that i can latch it to drone whatever note it's receiving, but i haven't had much luck finding any mods for it.  What i did realize though, is that if you remove the two screws, and take the top off the battery/switch compartment, you have a very easy to press momentary switch. (this should work with most of the Boss pedals, i think) (it works the same for my ODB3 too)  So, i patched up the SYB5 with my MS20mini, and the result was pretty similar sounding to the MS20 with the ""duophonic"" patching going on, i was easily able to play the SYBs switch(to hold note) with my hand, and control the parameters. I also sent the MS20s LFO out to the EXP input, and got the 'rate' on the Syb to sync with the MS20.  Has anyone else got an SYB5? I got it as a present years ago, and only recently pulled it out of a box and decided to try it with some synths, it actually works better than it did with the bass guitar IMO."

This is just my personal taste, of course, but the sounds it offered seemed too narrow and sterile.   I was drawn to it because of its smaller size, the animation pads and midi control depth. I thought it sounded fine in online demos, but after spending time with it, became less impressed with it.  The patch editor VST was frustrating to use; had it been better, I might have gotten into it more.  I did enjoy the feel of the micro keys. They had a nice soft touch to them and I could play quickly. I enjoyed the overall feel of it, in light of its build quality.

For synths that offer both control-per-function and analog features, I understand the appeal for choosing hardware. But digital hardware synths that require extensive menu diving seem to be a bad investment, at least in my eyes.   I'm pretty happy with my setup right now with Reason (and a good amount of Rack Extensions), my Nektar Panorama P6 keyboard, Minibrute, and the iPad. I have a few accessories I need to get in order to integrate the iPad better with my desktop PC, but I'll have to wait a little while. I might have broken my wallet a bit much!"

It looks fantastic (if that matters). I'm not in love with the keys, which isn't an uncommon complaint. They're built well, but they were made semi-weighted and, if I had my way, they'd be synth action. I prefer either synth action or fully-weighted - semi is an awkward middle ground. However, it's still very playable and I use it as my main board. The motorized fader is a nice convenience because it automatically assumes the position of your tracks' volume as you cycle through them."

synthesizers,38n8rx,bingaman,2,Fri Jun 5 15:46:35 2015 UTC,"true dat... the envelopes are also a little bouncier, not as snappy. it does do a lot of roland juno sounds but it is just different than the 6,60,106. if the 106 was a big brother of the 60, then the alpha j would be like a cousin. different DCO's, different envelope generator. built with a similar idea but different parts. i'd say its cheaper than the others for a reason, but i would pay what i did for it again. with real time control its a kick ass synth."
synthesizers,38n8rx,LaborDay-Lewis,2,Fri Jun 5 16:09:36 2015 UTC,"And to be fair, it can do many, many things that the other Juno's can't. Such as 'WHAT THE?' haha"
synthesizers,38n8rx,bingaman,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:16:10 2015 UTC,If OP has an ipad there's a solution the lack of knobs and sliders. I got a cheap JX8P and just use the iPG-800 app with the ipad ghetto-taped on the side. Works really well and for $5 you can't go wrong.   The iPG-800 controls the Alpha Juno  as well as the JX3P. All really cool synths.
synthesizers,38n8rx,NEXUS-6-N6MAA10816,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:59:58 2015 UTC,"The JX3P (with no mods) is just note on/off via MIDI, no control. For the JX8P, a Behringer BCR200 is a nice way to control it and the combo would be cheaper than the Juno-106. That said, I have both the JX8P and the 106 and in general they sound quite different (although you could get some similar sounds)."

synthesizers,38n8rx,3lbFlax,3,Fri Jun 5 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem like a good deal, but I live in the states so the used synthesizer market maybe different in your country. The avg selling price for a 106 in the US is about 600 euro. Based on the information you provided wrt your needs, I would recommend the roland jx-3p with the kiwi mod. If you have an ipad, I would recommend the roland jx-8p. Both synths are less expensive than the 106 and way more versatile. However, with the jx's you're sacrificing a lot of on board controls for a broader tonal palette. The iPad mitigates this problem and allows you to control your synths' functions via virtual sliders i an app. This might be a deal breaker to some, but it wasn't for me."
synthesizers,38n8rx,weedpot42069,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:27:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for introducing me to the kiwi mods. And you can buy knobby controllers for the jxs, am I right? Those look really nice. I'll be looking into those."

So if you're looking for lead solos or bass patches, it's not ideal. However the poly step sequencer and the ability to clock it using a trigger are very nice, and it sounds good doing what it can do."

The knobby controllers that roland made specifically for the JX's are often more expensive than the synthesizers themselves.

synthesizers,38n8rx,t0xicd0g,2,Sat Jun 6 13:28:05 2015 UTC,"So to stay with current trends. There is nothing unique about an analog synth over a digital one. Been doing this for over 20 years. I've actually found the opposite to be true. If you want something unique, look no further than the OP1 or the Roland V Synth or even a Blofeld. You'll get far more weird and unique sounds from those than any other analog synth in you price range. Everyone and their mother wants that Juno sound right now. Nothing unique about it. Also, Junos really don't misbehave unless they're broken.   Just some thoughts to maybe expand you options."
synthesizers,38n8rx,selfinflikted,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:46:41 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your opinion and you may be right. Maybe saying unique is quite a stretch, but what I meant was, I find that digital synths try to reach for a ""perfection"" in sound, which tends to make them bland. I'm not as well educated on the matter so I won't argue that you're wrong. Might be looking into some good digital synths later. This just happens to be what I'm searching for at the moment. I'll look into those synths you mentioned for sure."
synthesizers,38n8rx,bingaman,2,Sat Jun 6 15:38:28 2015 UTC,"I hear ya. It's that analog is all the rage and in vogue right now, so when ever anyone asks about getting an analog synth, I always ask why.  You also might want to look into the Ensoniq ESQ-1 which is a digital analog hybrid.  I understand that none of the synths (except maybe the OP1) will have that certain cool factor, nor will they give you much stage cred as a June will, and I'm not even really sure if you're interest in that."

The R-100 has a ""mono"" midi mode, where each part can specify it's own channel. However, each part only has its single midi note. So, if you wanted to do more than one note, you'd need to assign multiple parts to the same channel and the notes you wanted.  So, yes. You can do it, but it's a bit of a workaround hack.  That said, the I loved the R-100 and was kinda sad to have sold mine. It's built like a tank. And, if you buy an R-50e, you can swap sound ROMs and get orch stabs and bass on the R-100! :D  If you are looking for cheap and vintage sequencing, you could look into an Alesis MMT-8, Kawai Q-80 or Roland MC-500. Though, I really couldn't recommend it to someone new to this. For you, I'd probably recommend a used Akai MPC-1000 or an E-mu Command Station (MP-7, XL-7 or PX-7)."

Just be aware that it has a fairly limited set of sounds, the display is a pretty small LCD and the OS is a little bit obtuse.  That said, I think it's a fine first drum machine.  If you end up getting more vintage gear, it really shines as a master clock for syncing everything. If you end up hating it, you can probably flip it for what you paid for it.  What is the price your friend is quoting you? Because there might be a better piece of gear in that range that would serve you better. The R-100 is the kind of drum machine you get if that's the sound you want. Have you listened to it and do you like the sounds? Yes? Go for it! Kinda eh on the sounds? You might look into an Akai XR-10 (the old one, not the new XR-20) or a Boss DR-660 (or DR-770).  If your main concern is both drums and sequencing the JX-3P, I would not recommend it.  Anyway, what are you expecting out of it and what's your budget (quoted price from your friend). I can better answer your question if I know a bit more about your situation.  Edit: I misread the opening post. I thought your friend was selling it to you. Either way, let me know the price you're seeing for the R-100."

synthesizers,38i6cf,menace-official,2,Thu Jun 4 14:04:28 2015 UTC,"APC is a great place to start...  that's how I did it; then I followed a great hackaday article called make a digital synth; http://hackaday.com/2008/05/01/how-to-make-a-digital-synthesizer/ then MFOS stuff, then lunetta, then went finally bit the bullet and studied it.  I've never modded stuff, only built from scratch.  Have you looked into the Bazz Fuss?  It's probably easier to build that than take apart your ODB3  http://home-wrecker.com/bazz.html"

I was reading a lot of the stuff on the MFOS website, they have a lot of really cool tips on there. i'd love to build something like the WSG maybe next year or whatever, they look like great fun.  I've been on the hackaday site too, there is some crazy stuff goin on there, seems like it would be a great community for learning a thing or two. the nearest hackerspace to me is the other side of the country though, so i won't be going there any time soon.  oh nice, i'm definitely going to have to build one of those Bazz Fuss pedals, thanks for the link!  I'm still going to have a blast at the ODB3 anyway, i already have it opened up and everything, i never really play the bass anymore, so thats another reason for retrofitting it to suit my synths better. I already have a nice lump of plastic (an offcut from another job) to machine into a new enclosure, so it won't cost me anything but time really, I also have some of the parts for the mod that i need already, and the switch and 1/8"" jack sockets."

synthesizers,38i6cf,mightypea,2,Thu Jun 4 17:03:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a cool project. I too hate having to overexert myself while pushing down a huge stomp switch with my thumb mid-jam. Toggle switches are so much better for gear on top of a keyboard or table. My suggestions:    if your other gear uses CV/gate, add CV/gate I/O wherever it's practical. Especially with something like a filter.    use normalized in/out jacks for each effect so you can reconfigure the signal chain or use just one particular effect if you want, or don't plug anything in and the signal chain stays at the default (chorus>filter>delay>verb for example) this is kind of a project that will take a lot of time, so you shouldn't cut corners with circuit design or the power supply because you'll probably regret it. In my experience it is well worth it to spend a few extra bucks on good parts or a few more hours on building."

synthesizers,38i4vn,7ex4,8,Thu Jun 4 11:03:23 2015 UTC,"What I like about the OP-1:   It's portable It's got it's own speaker, though I tend to use headphones It has a built in radio - you can buy the aerial but I found plugging a headphone into the mic socket works just as well. It's got a load of synthesisers plus sampling, even off the radio It has FX which can be affected by the orientation of the device Several sequencers Some of the sequencers support transpose There's a four track tape recorder where you make play back live sequences by cueing them up It's a lot of fun doodling with it   What I don't like about the OP-1   You can't save sequences Each track is one channel only - until you record it onto the four track tape recorder when it becomes stereo. So no ping pong stereo unless you do it with two tracks 8P Only four tracks! Too easy to get clicks on recording tracks, though lately I seem to be avoiding that a lot Only accepts samples as AIF format; often refuses to load a sample with a simple ""load error"" and no explanation.

It's a fun and unique way of working, but it's also a little too simple in a lot of ways.  The thing is built really solid, but lack of velocity on the keys bugged me.  Mono only per track, and no way to back up songs in progress without a computer meant you can really sort only work on one song at a time.  You can fake it with recording later in the tape, but for arranging songs the tape is short enough already.  It's really fun, and I think it would make a great addition if you have a good bit of gear already.  If you're looking for an all in one solution to writing music on the go, it might appeal less.  If you can live with the limitations, it's more powerful than you think."
synthesizers,38i4vn,sheboygan_sexpo,5,Thu Jun 4 13:28:50 2015 UTC,"Nice review, man. I watched everything I could prior to purchasing my OP-1 and your review was well appreciated.   As mentioned in your comment, the ability to only work on one track at a time (without backing it up to a computer) is my major deterrent from using it all the time. It's really wonderful for what it is and incredibly unique. It's a great way to flesh out new song ideas, but it often requires swapping tracks/songs onto and off of the computer."
synthesizers,38i4vn,Tarekith,2,Thu Jun 4 14:42:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed completely.  In the end I went back to my iPad and iOS apps for on the go music making, or I grab the Korg Electribe since it's battery powered.

synthesizers,38i4vn,alpha_protos,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:03:54 2015 UTC,"Hey, I watched your OP- 1 and Electribe reviews and it seems like you know a lot about both, so I figured I'd ask you this. Which of the two makes a better portable workstation (if you don't want to use an iPad or something like that)? The OP-1's ability to record audio seems really useful, along with all the different sequencer types, but the Electribe is multitimbral and can save multiple patterns. It's a tough choice without having had a chance to try them both out."

In an hour or two, I can have the basis for an entire track ready.  The results are sometimes good enough that I don't hardly bother with processing elsewhere.  Its limitations force you to get creative.  Its gimmicks are unique and complex enough that instead of being cheesy, they can make people wonder how the hell you did something.  If I want to go all-out, I can record some tracks and put them in the computer to process or replace, and of course other non-OP things can be added.  Example here (OP-1 and Juno-6 with some reverb).  I regretting getting mine at first, but I had to learn everything about it and establish what kind of workflow was for me before I could appreciate it.  It's a very powerful tool... Like if you had a Swiss army knife that had a little chainsaw and a lifestraw built in, or something."

synthesizers,38i4vn,t1f,3,Mon Jun 8 12:04:53 2015 UTC,What helps me decide if I should buy something expensive or not is its resale value.

I think others in this thread have detailed the OP-1's pros and cons well enough so I'll skip doing that again, but I personally love it.   That said - it isn't for everybody (and I think I appreciate it a lot more when I have other stuff to pair with it). Get one cheap on MassDrop or buy used for around $625. If it doesn't work out, flip it on Craigslist for what you paid for it (or for a minor loss). If you can't get a bite locally sell it on Reverb (much lower percentage compared to eBay).

I've started a lot of songs on there at sketches - this song for instance, started as a sketch on the OP-1 and the core of it - the baseline, chords, and pads - all stayed in through the final mix: https://soundcloud.com/carriedbycurrents/surrounded   But obviously with only 4 tracks, limited mixing capabilities, and very limited synth engines, I could never write a full song on there."

synthesizers,38i4vn,neontropics,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:42:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know man, regardless it still kinda sounds like a toy to me. Don't get me wrong, I have one & I actually really, really like it even though I do think it sounds pretty horrible, which I excuse because of how crazy it is being that small & yet doing so many things, but I still don't take it any more seriously than say a PS Vita, however I do think it's an amazing piece of engineering to be able to do what it does & It's faults like its lack of memory make you shit or get off the pot & make decisions that will dramatically effect the end result, yet I think it's a good thing that's missing in most modern, ""endless possibility"", black hole hardware. If I had any 1 actual complaint about it, it's that for all it's intuitive & exlporative nature, it's just too complex to operate when you're really fucked up. By contrast I've never been too high to operate a basic monosynth or a guitar, but I've been locked out of the Op-1 several times cause I was just faded, leaving me with all kinds of divinely inspired ideas from the either & nothing to do about it. On the flip side, the thing I do love about it is that if you can imagine a workaround to deal with an obstacle, you can probably make it do what you want one way or another if you get creative, like bouncing tracks down with a different set of effects on a mastering track & moving it back into one of the tape tracks. Then there's the mystery of how vague everything is, which I think has been one of it's best benefits to me personally, cause like most people that have spent too much time in a studio, I get into the habit of putting a knob in a certain place cause I think ""thats where it's supposed to be"" instead of really listening & to make those little decisions. That abstraction is just wonderful. I got this thing because I spend a lot of time playing out of town shows so I've got a ton of down time I would otherwise be using staring out the window of the bus, playing videogames, watching a movie for the 100th time or driving somebody crazy, so it's good to have a something that's damn near infinitely entertaining & musical, that you can do in your bunk & not bother anybody & for that it's fucking awesome, but there's no question in my mind that even though it's $800, it's still a toy. I need to get on updating this again, but I started using the OP-1 as a quasi travel blog, taking whatever I had come up with at the end of a weekend out & just posting it as a documentation of the time, place & feel of our regional adventures, which has little to nothing to do with the music that takes us on the road."

synthesizers,38ilq1,Goom909,6,Thu Jun 4 23:13:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're going to like hearing this, but the Gaia isn't a VA in the sense most VAs are. It's closer to a ROMpler because the waveforms are long samples (which is why they can make it have 64 voices for a smaller price range than regular VAs). What this means is that you're going to find it very limited, especially in comparison to a JP-8000 or a SH-201 (check Adam Szabo write up on the Supersaw waveform for KVR here: http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=348010 ), and the aliasing issues can be quite a turn-off.  You can probably still make good use of it because in the end, all that really matters is having a new instrument to make music with, but I like to warn the folks who get or consider getting the Gaia because I don't think it was right of Roland to market it as a VA and people deserve to know that when they said it came with the ""legendary JP8000 supersaw"", they meant one sample of it."
synthesizers,38ilq1,dafragsta,5,Thu Jun 4 14:19:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah - I knew about the VA trickery. I can hear already the clinical digital sound of it. Unfortunately for me, my ears have been blessed with much analog gear - so I can tell a mile off that this synth is a little try-hard. However, that's not why I wanted one. I actually like the 8bit side that this can achieve - and a few other cool features. I also own a System-1 which kicks the GAIA out of the park in terms of VA ability."
synthesizers,38ilq1,Goom909,2,Thu Jun 4 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The Gaia is the bastard in my collection as far as sound engine pedigree, but 3 layers and 64 note polyphony, and the effects aren't bad (especially the pingpong delay). It does non-tracker NES style sounds really well."
synthesizers,38ilq1,selfinflikted,2,Thu Jun 4 20:42:00 2015 UTC,People will lust after that 'harsh digital sound' in a few years time I'm completely sure; it'll just take a few people picking it up dirt cheap VA's and using it to make awesome songs then the bandwagon will turn.  Probably analog makers will try and imitate 'digital' with analog-digital-modelling (adm) but the purists will hate the sound of it compared to 90's digital. Roland will be spinning around in circles confused.

A friend of mine had one of the early models with the purple silkscreen. It made the gnarliest sounds, and I was definitely sad when I had to give it back. A few years later, someone stole it out of his car. For what they cost now, it's just not worth replacing - if he could even find one for sale.  You have a powerful, rare tool. Try to use it more. If you feel like you've used it to the max of its abilities and have no place for it - sell it.

synthesizers,38l870,Leviathant,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:37:06 2015 UTC,"Ah! The original recommended street price :) An RSP of $777 is such a FR Jared kind of thing to do.  (Back when I bought it, the USD was not as strong against the SEK, so I guess it was the right time). I was kind of shocked to see what they are going for now... But it's a classic piece of gear alright.  Thanks for helping me debating this decision... I guess it's easier when trying to structure things together with others.   On the ""yes, get rid of the old noisebox"" side:  * It's question of real estate (and eurocrack funding, of course)... I have a small living room studio, and recent acquisitions have provoked some low-intensity disturbances in the diplomatic relations with other inhabitants. And I suppose the expanding euororack will overtake other stuff soon as well. * I have had it for almost 10 years, and I guess this often a limit for when you are starting to think about getting rid of old (gnarly-sounding and fun) stuff to replace with other great, new (+ in theory more inspirational) stuff.  * Last year I took the plunge and got the XS, and recently found a cheap Orb, so even though they are completely different synths, there is some overlap (especially if expanded with euroracK) * I also have an Acidlab Bassline mk3 (which is smaller) should I need another external sequencer w/ accent out). It also covers a much more narrow range of the bassline sound.  On the ""keep it side""... * There is still lots more to be had from the 777. If I only took the time to visit my old hackerspace, there are tons of modifications that really increase the usefulness of the 777... increased envelope range for more WHAP!, drone VCA mode, sort of PWM, etc... Does anyone have experience with using a modded 777? Would be interesting to hear a few sound examples of that! * Integration with eurorack would be fun (especially together with modulation sequencers to generate counter-rhythmic filter sweeps for CV and mod in) * It might be cash in hand, but, as Levianthant points out, the chances of ever getting one again is pretty slim. * Great fun getting caught up purposlessly tweaking it (as can be heard it in mediocre demo recording in the soundcloud link above)."

Maybe this will help you get started...if you have enough cables.  I don't know what it ships with.   White Noise Out to S+H In.  Square LFO Out to S+H Clock In.  S+H Out to VCA In (right next to S+H).  VCA Out to either Filter Contol In.  Mod Wheel Out to VCA Control In.  Turn up the knob marked EXT for whichever filter you choose to patch into.    Now when you are playing a note, if you move the wheel up from the center position, you will be opening that VCA allowing the S+H effect to reach the filter cutoff.  Noise produces a wide range of possible filter levels, so the higher you position the wheel, the wider the range will be.  Adjust the LFO rate to match the tempo of what you are playing.   You may notice that this same effect could be created with a slight variation of this patch.  The Noise could be run through the VCA before being sent to the S+H Input, and the S+H Out run directly to the Filter Control In.  This would control the amount of noise (modulation depth) sent to the S+H, instead of the amount of (full range) S+H sent to the Filter Control.    Of course, the first version of the patch could be done without the mod wheel and VCA by simply turning the knob marked EXT manually, but I wanted to encourage you to see some potential uses for the wheel and VCA."

It's claimed that this setup would make eurorack cheaper and more accessible, but I'm not sure a digital module would necessarily be much cheaper than an all analog module. Things like panels, jacks, pots, knobs, are some of the more expensive components in a module, and you would still need all of those."
synthesizers,38ff0m,xrxr,2,Wed Jun 3 22:46:45 2015 UTC,"Not yet, from what I can find. It appears that these were just unveiled yesterday, and some of the modules still don't even have video demonstrating what they do. I'll be curious to see what kind of pricing they end up at."
synthesizers,38ff0m,ouij,4,Wed Jun 3 23:46:17 2015 UTC,"unlike the Eurorack standard, Theseus is entirely digital and produces MIDI/OSC control messages rather than audio signals. This simplification in fidelity greatly reduces the cost of materials and complexity of electronic circuits, making patch cable compositional systems more accessible to artists and musicians.    So you take Eurorack modular synthesizers, and take OUT the one appealing thing (analog voltage control over modules). OK."
synthesizers,38ff0m,splurr,8,Wed Jun 3 21:27:32 2015 UTC,The analog voltage control is not the only interesting thing about modular synthesizers. There is the physical instrument and the hands on multifaceted routing that is also appealing. I think this is a very interesting development and opens up new realms of sonic creation. You can also use it with your analog modules.

Or all analogue modules would need a digital interface, kind of like how all new standalone analog synths have midi/usb. Currently eurorack is mostly digital but presents the user with an analogue control surface. Might as well send midi/osc through those patch cables rather than cv. Could be way more powerful. And way less reliable perhaps. I like how currently eurorack modules get increasingly complex but the patching has remained relatively simple. Damn, it's hard to talk about this stuff without falling into the digital vs analogue trap. I for one would be keen to have a modular system where some of the modules communicate via osc and others use cv, so long as it's equally simple to use and they can live together.   Edit: bring on the downvotes kids. But seriously, downvoting someone because they entertain a new idea, even if they're ambivalent on it?

The System-1 can only do a maximum of 4 voice polyphony - even though it has 2 oscillators per voice - there isn't 6. Also there isn't a Juno Chorus in the System-1 - but they could use the ""color"". So, therefore it isn't likely to be done.  They could easily do a Jupiter 4 - and I hope they do it soon ;) (considering they've already done the Promars).  They System-1 is amazing by itself as a VA, plus there's three awesome plug-outs for it: SH-101, SH-2 and Promars. It really is a big synth in a little price/package. Perhaps based on the success of the ACB tech and the System-1 sales results, Roland may consider doing a System-2 with more voice polyphony - and start competing with some of the bigger VA's out there - and then do things like a Jupiter 8 plug-out :)"
synthesizers,38fvke,ranzee,5,Thu Jun 4 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know this for certain, so take this with a grain of salt:  I'm willing to bet the DSP cores in these devices - the ACB engine specifically - is vastly more configurable than is well understood outside of Roland's software circle. It makes sense to develop something like this as a common platform ...   Think of ACB as being like MAX or Kurzweil VAST - extensible modular programming environments, really. MAX could run - and can, really, if memory serves - on hardware DSP.   The programming environment is used to define software oscillators, filters, etc is common across the AIRA range and the instruments themselves are re-wrappings of the same DSP core.    It's likely that the DSP architecture is not voice limited due to hardware limitations but instead interfacing and usability - I mean, hell, this company was producing massively polyphonic instruments a decade ago. But what does a 128 voice polyphonic Juno-60 sound like?   You start losing that analog clarity as the polyphony creeps upward just due to the sheer interaction of all of the waveforms - plus things like portamento, Arpeggiators, etc etc become quite different sonically from the 'vintage analog' sound people are looking for.  I'm sure that given their technical competence the Roland team could pump out wildly unconventional and heavily polyphonic ACB synths all day - but would people buy them? I mean, the SH101 emulation on system 1 is damn near flawless - but would there be a big market for a less niche instrument like a Jupiter 8?   I'm sure they've done that research. The giant analog poly synths aren't their focus because they're not the market's focus."
synthesizers,38fvke,output_enable,3,Thu Jun 4 04:30:35 2015 UTC,So is Kurzweil Vast modular? I never knew much about it.
synthesizers,38fvke,Biopharmer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:48:52 2015 UTC,Vast gives you the freedom to modulate anything with just about anything and has 30+ different synth algorithms (each one can be customized). Plus you can incorporate functions and equations. It's a real nerd's synth.  It was my second synth and I was confused by other digital synths because they were so limited.
synthesizers,38fvke,crowby,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:24:12 2015 UTC,"Indeed, it is essentially a bunch of 0's and 1's being processed - so anything is possible. What will limit it is the processing power and memory limitations. So your hypothetical scenario is possible.  However, I don't see Roland moving on this configuration for the System-1 - as it is likely they have it well balanced for the hardware."
synthesizers,38fvke,ranzee,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:12:56 2015 UTC,The sound follows the hardware form factor as interface is what people really buy.
synthesizers,38fvke,output_enable,2,Thu Jun 4 15:29:35 2015 UTC,"I think the 4 voice polyphony of the default System-1 engine is just due to it being something new that doesn't have to emulate anything old. I'm betting the emulations take up a lot more processing power, hence the monosynths. Just speculation, but it seems that's the case. If they could streamline the processing enough, I'm sure they could get far more than 4 voices, but I doubt the accuracy to old gear would be close at all."
synthesizers,38fvke,the_cody,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:13:15 2015 UTC,"The way I understand it (and I'm happy to be corrected) is that the FPGA is setup as a logic circuit design - not an emulation. The major difference is that it talks directly as hardware. A software emulation would require a compiler/interpreter to talk machine code to the processor running on some sort of operating system - and that adds a bottleneck to the mix. The Korg Kronos and M3 are examples of this (among others).  Essentially it would require Roland to completely re-program the FPGAs (2 of them) to each act like 3 individual oscillators and the accompanying audio chain (LFO, Filter, AMP etc). So this wouldn't be a firmware update - this would be a chip change."
synthesizers,38fvke,ranzee,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:30:19 2015 UTC,"I think you're using a specific definition of emulation, while I'm meaning it in a general sense. The System-1 Plug-Outs are emulating the sound of specific synths.  The processor that loads the code for the plug-outs might not be limited to 1 or 4 voices, but that limitation might be due to the processing power required to have the Plug-Outs sound as accurate as they do."
synthesizers,38fvke,the_cody,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:01:15 2015 UTC,"I don't have a system-1 so forgive me for this question. Are the voices limited by the DSP? it's a modern virtual synth. The limitation should have more to do with choice by software design rather than a hardware limitation. For a small keyboard, it doesn't make sense but the processing power for 2 more voices should be there."
synthesizers,38fvke,fistingfissure,3,Thu Jun 4 04:10:34 2015 UTC,I understand that there are two FPGA processors onboard. I also understand that the capability of each FPGA is fairly limited to x-number of voices of polyphony. I've not seen anything official from Roland - because they wouldn't - but many posts about this when the whole ACB shitstorm started when it was first announced with the TR-8. A lot of this is due to the specific architecture of the logic block design of the FPGA - but beneficial to it acting more like a hardware circuit (as opposed to software emulating on a processor).  There's a good vid here about the guts of the System-1 if you're interested: https://youtu.be/_3-GRmXyi2Q
synthesizers,38fvke,ranzee,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:23:49 2015 UTC,"I would imagine the keyboard's a factor there, too - the System 1 is well placed as a monosynth or lead synth, but it'd be very restrictive for a Juno where you want to have those octave-spanning chords and bass/lead combos.  I'd think a System 2 or equivalent with more keys and velocity / aftertouch is more likely - but that would be up against the JD-X synths in many ways. Although it seems a bit of a shame the JD-X line doesn't link up to the Aira mixer - so there is still room there for a proper poly."
synthesizers,38fvke,3lbFlax,2,Thu Jun 4 15:17:29 2015 UTC,"Considering the form factor, probably not. They seem to be focused on the old monosynths. Not to say it won't happen, but, it just seems to be the only way they're heading."
synthesizers,38fvke,the_cody,2,Wed Jun 3 23:37:48 2015 UTC,Keyboard aside - the other controls could easily be mapped into the System-1.
synthesizers,38fvke,ranzee,2,Thu Jun 4 03:13:18 2015 UTC,"Just throwing this out there: the SH-101 voice architecture is actually very similar to the Junos. With the polyphonic capabilities already in the System-1, and perhaps using a vintage Boss chorus pedal, you should be able to get spectacularly close to a Juno sound."
synthesizers,38fvke,jepyang,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:22:31 2015 UTC,You can - and I've tried it. You don't even need the SH-101 plug-out - you can just use the System-1.

synthesizers,38flr9,jahreed,3,Wed Jun 3 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"I have a V50, and think it's an underrated synth.  It differs from all the other Yamaha FM synths in that you can set oscillators to be fixed frequency LFOs down to 0.06hz. This gives some really interesting glitchy sounds and strange noisy modulation, rather than pitch modulation as you might expect. I've made some haunting grinding pads using this, and layering two copies of a sound with slightly different mod speeds.   The effects are SPX90 style, with gritty reverbs and a horrific distortion. I think these suit the FM sound, but it might be an acquired taste.  Having 16 voices, and layering patches really fattens up the 4OP sound. There are some huge lead and bass sounds with 8 detuned voices in the presets. It doesn't seem to do a proper mono mode though, which is slightly annoying. It's always slightly poly even with one voice set to one note polyphony, which makes some monosynth lead playing styles impossible."

I recently posted here about how they went out of production and then the final few that were on analoguehaven.com promptly disappeared.  I emailed the makers of the gdc and they said they weren't making any more at this time.  Not sure if that means they will make more again in the future or not.  They did say they had some eurorack modules in the works.  It would be quite cool to have a eurorack version of the gdc with lots of cv control.  As a side note, I've tried to alleviate my sorrow of not landing one of those beautiful ammo boxes by building a eurorack setup of my own that closely mimics the capabilities of the gdc.  It isn't crazy complicated in theory.  A couple of oscillators, a band pass filter, some sync able LFOs, etc.  the question is whether or not the gdc has some weird/unique circuitry that makes it wail like it does that may be hard to recreate.  I'll likely post on this sub later on to share my progress."

I was very excited when I heard these were coming out, but I am not sold on the slim keys.  I've played on a MS-20 mini and I didn't like the width and interval difference.  The keys are sturdy like full size keys, not like a microkorg, but I'm not spending $1,000 on an 86% size model.  I guess I'm the minority here because they keep making small key synths.  Roland does it too.  This would have been a buy for me otherwise.  I understand that they're trying to make them accessible, and I think that's great, but I'd rather spend more for a full size model.  It defeats the purpose of buying hardware if I have to control it externally with another keyboard."

synthesizers,38bkwc,BonjourMyFriends,24,Wed Jun 3 03:56:56 2015 UTC,"Vince Clarke is famous for his synthesizers obviously, but every Erasure song starts with Clarke and Andy Bell with a tape recorder and piano or guitar. Analog synthesizers are what he uses to flavor the track in the end. So here are some words from a master synthpop songwriter on the subject:  ""It always involves me and Andy going somewhere else. There’s too many diversions in the studio. We start on guitar or piano, work out some sort of melody, record it onto a microcassette recorder, and put 8-bar sections together. Then we’ll take it back to the studio, and Andy will work on the lyrics.""  ""We’ve always written like that. It’s a cliché, but if a song sounds good on guitar, then that’s good enough. If you can’t make it work with a guitar and a voice, then it’s probably not working.""  ""We sit with a piano, an acoustic guitar and a micro-cassette recorder and then work out some chord progressions and a melody line to go over that. Once we have the basic tune and the chord changes, I’ll go into the studio to write the music and Andy will go away to write the lyrics. We never write with synthesizers, otherwise I get sidetracked.""  This is how Vince Clarke was able to create such amazing songs on obtuse sequencers like the MC-4. If you've got your song already written then you're just adapting it to the medium.  I see people sometimes say that they end up noodling around on Elektron boxes but never finishing a complete track or song. All the tools are in those boxes to do complete songs. But if you approach it directly you're likely to end up frustrated and wasting time.  It's almost better if you know somewhere with a piano removed from your normal environment, where you can bring a tape recorder and plan stuff out."
synthesizers,38bkwc,Biopharmer,12,Wed Jun 3 07:50:31 2015 UTC,"There's no easy answer. I sometimes get inspired by a patch I've made and that alone sparks a whole track, other times I'll be jamming away on a piano and come up with a melody I then build a track around. Still other times I get a melody and beat stuck in my head and have to get it down. All are valid ways to work, all result in cool tracks and, more often, crap ones! Just go with whatever method of writing suits you best at that time!"
synthesizers,38bkwc,t0xicd0g,8,Wed Jun 3 04:38:59 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you are composing. Rhythm and pitch are only two aspects of a piece of music, and in many electronic compositions they may not play a major role. Some of my favourite pieces have almost a constant melody and rhythm throughout the entire piece, but vary other elements of the sound like the timbre, ambience, distortion, etc. it wouldn't be much use to try to write or perform a piece like that on most other instruments.   If you have a piece where pitch and rhythm play a larger part, sure you can compose it on another instrument. I used to compose 303 bass lines on an acoustic guitar and them program them in."

I like playing the piano as well, but I have never recorded myself laying down several tracks, but I'd imagine I would approach it similarly. A couple of bars at a time, layering and layering, follow one idea which usually is a loose idea of a ""feeling"" or a ""scene""."
synthesizers,38bkwc,mrcolonist,7,Wed Jun 3 05:41:15 2015 UTC,"I'm always fascinated by the creative processes of others. To be honest, having voice memos on the phone has been a big help, and I've gotten good songs from just having that rolling during jam sessions, which then turn into writing/ arranging parts.   Was watching Sigur Ros' doc Heima and they spoke about the writing process, playing a cut of a track and the group writing together, and how their ideas, etc. ended up being very similar, matching the mood of the music. So I think my buddy and I are going to give that a go this weekend.   I remember hearing about Sabbath recording Paranoid, and how Ozzy would sing nonsense words and Geezer Butler would take his melodies and essentially match the sound to words and meaning.  Any other strategies?"

I try to approach songwriting those ways, though sometimes it's more one than the other two. I grew up playing guitar, so I still write mainly on guitar and then either translate everything to other instruments or find things that fit in with my playing style.   Sometimes I feel more productive sitting down with just one instrument and just fiddling around with it until I find a sound or something about it I like...I'll then try to build an idea around that. That's usually the most fun.  There are other times, where just jamming with other people brings out the best in me. That probably happens the most often,."
synthesizers,38bkwc,TheGreatWildFrontier,3,Wed Jun 3 05:56:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree, ""focus on one instrument"" has been the most helpful thing for me starting to write sequences and songs, rather than just unfocused improvising (which is also fun and great for practice nonetheless).  Since moving to the studio I've been bringing my MPC home and churning out sequences on it. When I get back to the studio, I only need to replace some of the weaker samples with stronger synth patches or drum machine sounds.  It's my own problem, being so easy to distract, but I feel like it's pretty common. As much as I want to play them all, I know I wouldn't be getting so much record-able, perform-able music done if there were a bunch of synths surrounding my MPC."

I write just piano songs too though.   I have been playing piano for fifteen years, I only just picked up synths about a year ago. I found my piano skills transferred over perfectly."

Especially when you enable the chord compatability lines it's super easy to see how the melody interacts with the chords.
synthesizers,38bkwc,Jaalmakadamia,4,Wed Jun 3 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"Depends of the genre... when I make dub or trip-hop, I could just make an entire track just with a saw wave. When I do techno, melody doesn't really matter as much as the timbre and how the timbre interacts with the rythm."
synthesizers,38bkwc,LardPhantom,3,Wed Jun 3 07:48:32 2015 UTC,"Myself and my band have found a really productive way to write is to get a sound that's in the ballpark of what you want and to move on immediately. Things can be finessed later, and twiddling knobs for an hour isn't going to get this new track written. We got the bones of 9 songs down in 4 days the last time we worked like this.

synthesizers,38bkwc,LardPhantom,3,Wed Jun 3 14:32:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we're pretty fastidious about recording all the settings of a patch. Also the point is not to create something too specific until a later time, when it comes to more in depth production."

synthesizers,38bkwc,PerceptionShift,3,Wed Jun 3 14:31:10 2015 UTC,"I used to struggle with this a lot until I happened upon a Juno 6 and a tape portastudio. The Juno is simple enough that I can get a rough patch and then just record what comes to mind, just like I would a guitar. The tape is handy because it doesn't capture nearly the level of detail that digital does so it's not so important to have the sound perfect anyways. It puts a greater focus on the melody and rhythm and everything in between. Plus I can get so many more ideas down just playing with the tape rolling. Then I go back and go ""well I like this but not this"" and cherry pick my favorite parts.  Then I go and put it all together with much more finesse and detail in regards to sound design and general complexity. I know what I'm trying to do now so the goal becomes to enhance it with experimentation and tools and effects and whatever. Then I record it on digital and rehash the shit out of it until I have something that I am pleased with but still has its origins in what I put on that tape.   The thing is you don't even need a Juno and a portastudo to do this. Even a cheap shit Casio and a little tape memo deck will do. You can grab some $5 tape deck at goodwill that has mic inputs (most do) and that'll work too."
synthesizers,38bkwc,synthador,4,Wed Jun 3 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"What a great topic! Deeply enjoying the descriptions of everyone else's method.   I have fallen into my own highly defined songwriting routine, which allows me to churn out song after song. Some are good, some are not. It takes months, sometimes years, to decide which are the good ones. Here are my steps:    Pick Key/Mode/Chords. Using something like Autochords or Suggester I gather the eight chords that I will use to make the progression.  Chord Progressions: For this step, I use Garage Band for iPad. I create a new Smart Keyboard track, then in the little wrench menu set the song's key, and ""Edit Chords"" to assign each of the 8 chord strips to the eight chords I picked in step 1. Playing the chord strips I find two or three 4 or 8-bar progressions. I will then record and quantize an 8-bar ""A section"" and an 8-bar ""B section"" and maybe a 4-bar intro/outro/bridge ""C section"". Then, I will create a new ""Smart Bass"" track and add the simplest of bass-lines, using Liverpool, autoplay 1, which is just the root-note, dotted quarter, eighth, half note rhythm. Finally, I will throw on a temporary drum track using ""Smart Drums"" randomized by tapping the little dice icon. Most important... write the chord progression on scratch paper! Melody: In section A, I will create a piano track and let the chord/bass/drums play as a loop while I mess around finding a nice melody. Sometimes I will use the arpeggiator set to eighth notes or dotted whatever notes to get a random melody then tweek it up some. Once I have ""found"" a melody, record it and move on to section B and then C.  Title for the Song: This is important. I will usually make up a silly title based on whatever is going on around me.  Export to Logic Pro X: In Garage Band (iPad), I will export the new song. In ""My Songs"" I tap ""Select"" then select the new song, then the share button choosing iTunes then ""GarageBand"". Using iTunes on the Mac, I can import the .band file. Then, on the Mac, right-click ""Open with"" and open it with Logic Pro X. In Logic, I now have simple MIDI files with melody, harmony and a simple bassline.  In the notepad section, I will type the chord progression so I don't forget when I lose the piece of scratch paper. Make Lead Sheet/Write Placeholder Lyrics: I get the melody and chords onto a paper lead sheet using the Logic Pro X Score Editor which I learned to use by viewing an excellent MacProVideo Tutorial by Peter Schwartz. The lead sheet has only the melody and guitar chord grids. At this stage I will usually hastily make up some placeholder lyrics, based loosely on the song's title.  Play it and Play with it: Reading from the lead-sheet, I will play/sing the song on the guitar trying different styles and tempos. Other times, I will swap many various instruments in Logic trying out rock, EDM, jazz sounds. I will also export the MIDI files from Logic and import to Ableton Live 9 and play the song on external gear as well as experiment with Ableton MIDI effects. My favorite is to use the MIDI chord and arpeggiator effects on the simple bass-line. The most fun is to let the MIDI loop and do sound design on external gear. For bass, its always the Minitaur because the front panel controls are so much fun. For melody/lead, the Slim Phatty is equally great. Harmony (poly) parts are more difficult. I have a Prophet 12 module and a Tetra, neither of which lend themselves to the sort of one-knob-per-function that makes real-time sound-design so fun. Running the synths through countless stompboxes is fun too. Record Various Demos: Record various demos and listen to them constantly in the car.  Refine Refine Refine: I constantly return to all of my many songs updating the lead sheet and the ""master"" Logic MIDI file.    Anyway, that's what I do."

synthesizers,38bkwc,junkestar,4,Wed Jun 3 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like I have no firm rules for myself. A creative work is a messy affair and there is a ton of back and forth. Sometimes I start with a rhythm, sometimes it's just a patch that I land on and develop from there. Other times just an ambient drone that evolves. I feel like inspiration comes in so many flavors.  I'm sure there are folks who have a very strict process that works for them. For me it's kind of never the same thing twice... with that being said, I have only been making music for a bit over a year, perhaps with time I will develop more of a regular process."
synthesizers,38bkwc,parmaaa,3,Wed Jun 3 16:48:35 2015 UTC,"They kind of go hand in hand for me. I make house and techno, so most of what I do can be whipped up pretty easily in Ableton with the drum machine/sampler. I've started making my own patches in Operator and letting that kind of dictate what I'm going to do with the rest of the track. I do this because usually I'll sit down with an idea of what I want to do, and then end up making something completely different. Unless I have a stone-cold melody or bassline in my head, I usually just start messing with a patch until I find something unique that I can build around.   FX chains are kind of the same way...I pretty much just run a Space Echo type chain, or a specific compressor setting on everything depending on the instrument. This is because I know I want the movement and space from the delay/reverb and maybe a little thickness from a chorus. I've just found this to be the best facilitator for creativity. My workflow is always changing. Too much of one thing makes production stale and unrewarding."

But having recently acquired an SH-101, I must add that IMHO half of the synth's greatness is its sequencer.  it's the most immediate one ever.  It's almost like, with the 101, it's less about the sound you are creating, but how easy it is to get a banging groove coming out of it.

synthesizers,38babj,tech53,3,Wed Jun 3 02:38:11 2015 UTC,"The Ultranova isn't really lacking in controls - you've got nine knobs and the mod wheel, and also eight touch encoder assignments, which can cover multiple parameters (and aftertouch).  If your goal is live tweaking multiple parameters, there is one caveat - the eight small encoders are detented. This is ideal for editing patches, but obviously not so great for smooth tweaks. But it's a fairly loose detent, so it's still workable, and (unless you've applied the filter lock) touching any of the small encoders assigns the relevant parameter to the large, smooth knob.  The touch tweaking is a really good feature - assign multiple value changes to an encoder, and then touch it to apply them. The slew features mean you can trigger smooth changes there if you want to, and being able to stack multiple tweaks on one encoder means you can radically alter a sound with a single touch - and you have eight encoders to work with.  So while the Ultranova doesn't have the immediate tweakability of a Gaia, for example, it can certainly hold its own - and as long as you're comfortable with monotimbral performance, the sound engine is considerably more powerful and flexible than the Gaia and most of its competitors.  Ask away if you have any Ultranova questions!"
synthesizers,38babj,3lbFlax,3,Wed Jun 3 10:46:38 2015 UTC,"well, went back over my budget...turns out over a 6 month course I'll have something like 1200 to spend on just bullshit (in other words...gear) so I'm thinking start with an MS-20mini or bass station and maybe try to pick up a virus or used ultra nova down the line. I listened to a few groove sequenced instances of the MS-20 on youtube and they weren't bad, really kind of cool. The bass station also did some cool stuff when similarly set up. The 2 things I like about the bass station over the korg are A) it seems more solid. Much more. B) portability. I don't have a desk or table or any furniture in my room save for a bed, a little laptop cart, and a dresser. Being able to easily bring this thing into the living room on the couch or work on my bed or something is important until I get a desk and a rack. Congratulations Bass Station...I think you just won. I really noticed how much bigger the sounds begin to get when you add a big of delay/verb/chorusing ....which let's face it, is pretty cheap on the second hand studio market if you're not after a lexicon or TCE. Do any of you know of any cool pedals or pedal like things meant for chaining on synths? Not modular but more like a guitar pedal for a synth...filters, verbs, delays, wah, you know...goodies."

I returned mine because of the envelopes being too sluggish and the tone being a little ""compressed"" for my tastes.  But I could easily see myself getting one again down the line.  Minibrute: It can do bass but I never thought its bass was that great.  I am unfortunately not a fan of the Brutes. I wish I was because I like the design and functionality.  The tone just doesn't do it for me.  MS-20 mini: Love it.  Very 70's sounding.  It's best for weird stuff, though, imo.  If your looking for rubbery bass lines it probably won't deliver (although I've coaxed some rubbery-ness out of it).  It never gets boring and is the most fun synth I've played, but I don't think it's right for your purposes.  I don't have a System-1 but I'm very curious about it.  The trouble is I can never demo any of the plug-outs cause every store that has it just has the standard System-1 loaded with no plug-outs.  I've always wanted an SH-101.  The old Roland sound is my favorite.  I am curious how the envelopes are on the SH-101 plug-out.  The real SH-101 is renowned for its ""plucky"" envelopes.   I know I'm going on about envelopes, but I've learned that they're important over the years when it comes to bass lines!   Anyway, those are my thoughts. Hope they help a bit!"

So the list is starting to whittle down a bit now. Honestly the only reason the virus gets away with not having a keyboard and still being on my list is BECAUSE it's a virus. It's hard to get away from the fact that it has that sound. I was watching a thing on it, it seemed like some of the programming was awkward at first, or different from standard synths. Is this true?"
synthesizers,38babj,ouij,2,Wed Jun 3 15:01:15 2015 UTC,"Gaia. Overpriced for what you get. The oscillators are actually PCM samples, and they loop. It's a dandy control surface, but I'd rather get a used Ultranova over a Gaia.  Ultranova easily the bang/buck winner in this list. Interface might take a bit of getting used to, but the synthesis engine is fantastic.  Bass Station 2 A very good option for a first monosynth. Patch memory, nice low-pass filter with variable response. Keyboard filter tracking is 100% all the time, though, and that could get annoying for some patches.  Microbrute/Minibrute I have a Microbrute. It integrates well with other analog/modular gear, and the filter (2-pole steiner-parker) is fabulous. It is, however, a 1-oscillator synth with a sub-oscillator. This is necessarily a more limited architecture than the Bass Station's 2 DCO design. The keyboard on the microbrute is terrible, but that's less of a concern with a monosynth that does not respond to velocity or aftertouch, anyway.   Do you want a monophonic instrument or a polyphonic instrument?"

In soft synths I've always liked massive quite a bit. I know it's not fair to compare soft synths but it's wavetable. A lot of people hate wavetables but I really like them. On the other hand the sound of that bass station kind of makes me cream my panties. I'm just worried that I'll run out of sound design options on it. (as a side note that makes sense why it seems so toy like - if I'm doing pcm samples and not wave tables, I'd rather have a proteus 2000 and a control surface) So I guess we're also down to the Virus, the ultra nova, the bass station, and I'll throw the MS20 mini in for good measure.

I try to not fall into a repetitive workflow, so I am forever reorganizing, reworking connections, etc. And it's a real productivity killer. I can't count the number of times I've wanted to try something and then after rejigging connections for an hour I no longer feel like it.  So, these days most of my gear dreaming involves something like this: http://www.audiopile.net/CUDJ-P  Which I think would be perfect for me. I have a few rack pieces I'd like to just put in there and wire up to a patchbay. Then I could put my mixer in the top, since I use the mixer as basically my audio signal nexus, most everything goes through the mixer and then out to an amp and my computer. What rack spaces are left over, I would fill with drawers and/or shelves to store things. That would allow me to box nearly everything I own up into one cube (aside from large keyboards and etc), but my grooveboxes, pedals, cables, sequencers, all that stuff would be stowed away neatly. But then the side tables come out to create surfaces to work on.  I also plan on getting a rack MIDI thru box to put in there.  Ultimately, my goal is to have the patch bay set up so that I can connect most anything to anything by patches on the patch bay and/or mixer. And to achieve that in a way that also lets me pack it all down into a reasonably small and transportable pod. Which would also help with what I see as sort of a ""next step"" for me musically, which would be live performance.

synthesizers,388f57,rodentdp,6,Tue Jun 2 16:56:03 2015 UTC,"This could easily derail, but why wouldn't you consider it as such? Technically, sampling is a form of synthesis, no? I know that we recognize a distinction between samplers and synthesizers, but the Octatrack is arguably the most ""synth"" sampler ever."
synthesizers,388f57,the_cody,4,Tue Jun 2 17:07:33 2015 UTC,"It's kind of hard to classify. When most people say synth, the Octatrack doesn't really qualify, since it's not a ""keyboard type instrument."" But, as a sampler, it's the most creative sound mucking box outside of things like KYMA or the Hartmann Neuron, making it the one of the most synthesis heavy samplers ever made.  It's definitely not a traditional synth, but it's definitely doing synthesis with the samples.  I can see both sides of the argument, but it's mostly academic. It's a really capable box that allows you to easily and quickly do things that you would normally need a computer to do."
synthesizers,388f57,the_cody,2,Tue Jun 2 21:36:23 2015 UTC,"Can you talk about what it does that comes close to the Kyma or additive resynthesis a la the HN? Not that I'm calling you out, that just seems way beyond my initial impression of the sample mangling onboard."
synthesizers,388f57,dafragsta,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:34:43 2015 UTC,"I meant that KYMA and the Neuron (and maybe the V-Synth?) are way above and beyond. They are incredibly capable instruments that really go above and beyond what a ""sampler"" is, to the point that I don't really think of them as ""samplers."" But, as for products that I'd call ""sampler,"" the Octatrack still reigns as real-time mangling, real-time sampling and real-time editing.  What the Octatrack shines at is real-time manipulation of loop points, stretching, slicing, pitch shifting, recording, sequencing. What sets it apart is the ""real-time"" aspect of that. Most samplers can do what it does, but it's off-line rendering/resampling, or, you can't edit (or easily edit) those parameters while it's playing. And, how fluid the samples feel in the Octatrack's engine, makes it feel more like synthesis rather than sample-playback.  The old elektron-users forum had ""science lab"" contests, where they would challenge making a complete track out of one sample or sound. And, yes, most samplers can do things like that, but the Octatrack is really designed with doing that sort of thing up front, and not as an afterthought.  The level of sample manipulation and sound design you have immediately available on the OT is the sort of thing you'd expect to need a computer to have access to."

You can absolutely use it as a synth by loading in single cycle waveforms etc if you wanted to - I'd still probably describe it as more of sampler/sequencer though. I think we're just getting into semantics, people can call it what they want, I just didn't want OP to be confused about what he/she was purchasing given it's their first foray into this kinda thing."
synthesizers,388f57,JtCallebro,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"I've often thought that the Octatrack almost demands to be one's ONLY instrument for as much mastery as it takes to really make the most of it. There is so much mental planning and memorization to it. It's definitely not a synth in the traditional sense, but I kind of wish I'd had ONLY an Octatrack to mess with 15 years ago, even though it would've then been as advanced as anything out there."

So, what I hope my setup looks like in a few months is actually set up!  With a studio space, I'll also have a room to get to my DIY projects that I've been planning / neglecting. I have an unstarted Shruthi-1 that's been sitting in a box since late last year. I have a couple ideas for arduino projects I want to get to (a touchpad XY->CC for my two vocoders, a CC->NRPN for my ER-1, a generic version of that CC->NRPN/SysEx box that can be set up for what ever synth).  I've got quite a bit of gear I'm still on the edge of selling in favor of a Sub 37 (I just sold my Micro Q ... but am spending that money on funding stuff for my friend's wedding). But, the GAS for the Sub 37 is starting to wane a bit. Though, that new OS update did a lot for refueling the flames of wanting.  I'm super keen on the Acid8! I just want to see one in the wild and hear some user reviews of build quality and lack-of-bugs. I've read a bit about the Therapsid that was a bit disappointing (that it was a wonderful little synth, but had a couple glaring flaws related to sounding like a SID). But, I'm a huge fan of hybrids synths, so this is pretty much exactly the kind of product I get excited and GAS about (like the MeeBlip Anode, which is another awesome little hybrid synth).  I've been getting a bit of time in on my OP-1 and am really loving it! My current plan is to use it to sample other gear, sample random noises, use the built in synths and build up parts that I can then load and chop up in the Octatrack. /u/slamgauge has been bugging me to get a set together for playing live. I think a set based around just the Octatrack live (and maybe Nord Drum and Meeblip with it) would be really fun and super portable.  My bandmate's schedule is starting to free up a bit, so we're gonna have a free day to actually write and practice! He's thinking about getting an Elektron Rytm. I think that'll change our dynamic a lot. I'm usually the more changing parts (mutes, knobs, etc) and main vocoder vocals; he's on guitar-through-a-synth, static parts (arps, basslines, long melodies, etc) and backup talk box vocals. With him getting a Rytm, we'll be sharing a lot of the parts, so it'll be more of ""this is a Cody on vocals, drums and bass song"" or ""this is a Jarred on vocals, drums and bass song,"" letting the other person take the reigns on the rest of the parts.  Oh, and, maybe an Intellijel Atlantis + Metropolis. Because, fuck it, I'm stupid."

Probably the best thing I can do is just hold off for a while and just keep learning the MPC before doing anything rash-plus, I'm still using the free JJOS, so I probably won't really make a choice until I've upgraded to JJOS2XL. I figure that I can just keep saving money while I play around with my setup and decide.   I bought my Machinedrum UW new right before they dropped $200 from the price, so going by current used prices I'd end up losing $700 or more in the sale from my original purchase. With that in mind it seems wiser to just keep it, since it isn't as if I dislike it or wouldn't use it in the future, even if I'm not using it as much now.

The MPC is a lot more fun and I can outline a whole song on it in minutes while I'd still be setting things up for ages on the Machinedrum. Even the process of setting up sample programs is a fun and creative to me on the MPC, while on the Machinedrum I've only just figured out how to transfer samples in a purposeful way after several months, and it requires pretty meticulous organization. I keep trying to get to know the MD more and waiting for that moment when it clicks. Despite knowing where everything is now, I still always feel sort of lost in Elektron's architecture."

It took me at least 6 months to start ""thinking Elektron"" after I got the MDUW, and maybe a full year until I was really fluid with it, but it was easy after that, and having purchased the Monomachine and Octatrack as well I can say that it's a cumulative process. The Octatrack just clicked after learning the Mono, and I doubt I'll have to spent much time looking at the Analog series manuals to learn them.

synthesizers,388f57,jahreed,3,Tue Jun 2 18:04:18 2015 UTC,I've got 3 groove-box stations essentially.  - TR-8 + TB-3  - JD-XI - Electribe Sampler  I'm kinda enjoying having 3 separate methods of making tracks. Now I am trying to decide if I wanna connect them all up or sell one of them to get an analog mono or full size midi keyboard.
synthesizers,388f57,Rev_Gargoyle,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting that you've got once of each! Out of those groove-boxes which would you say is the most ""inspiring"" or easy to use to get new music jams/ improvisations down quickly? I was debating the same ones but ended up going for Ableton Push for its overall flexibility, but now regret it because I wish I'd got standalone sequencing hardware instead...  The Electribe took my fancy but appeared too limited with pattern sizes etc. I am thinking about a TR-8 however."
synthesizers,388f57,podblob,3,Tue Jun 2 20:21:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say as far as getting an idea going and into something cool quickly...the JD-Xi. It gets some flack for having mini keys, menu diving, not the best build quality etc...but the thing sounds good and the 4 part sequencer is just awesome.  When I started out getting into synths I used to record 4 loops of microkorg onto a kaosillator pro and that's how I'd make songs. So the JD-Xi was made for that style of building things up from loops.  The electribe sampler is also great but definitely requires a bit more time and attention to detail to get an idea sounding the way you want. No keyboard means a little less precise (or slower) note entry. But the portability factor (6 AA batteries), with an easy to use sequencer, sampling capabilities and some pretty decent effects make it great for coming up with something.  The TR-8 and the TB-3 sound awesome. Roland did a great job with the Aira range. However unlike the JD-Xi and the electribe's they aren't ""all in one"" devices. If you're looking for a dedicated drum machine, I couldn't recommend the TR-8 enough and likewise for the TB-3 as a dedicated bass/acid machine (which also works as a great mono sequencer).   I like having the limitations of hardware, Ableton remains way too daunting for me. Grooveboxes have always been what I make the most music on and have the most fun with."
synthesizers,388f57,Rev_Gargoyle,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:35:24 2015 UTC,I'm actually doing a lot with the TR-8 and the MK and the KP3 (and an MS-20).    How are you using the TR-8 as a mono sequencer?  I'm thinking it would be cool the sequence the MS-20 with it.
synthesizers,388f57,Rheos,2,Tue Jun 2 21:54:59 2015 UTC,Yeah see now that's a set up i've kinda had before as well and you can do a lot with it. I used to do Bass Station over TR8 and make loops on the Kp3. Eventually I wanted something that sequenced those loops..  Also I meant the TB-3 was a the mono sequencer. Which as far as I know would work well sequencing the MS-20 mini. Sorry for the confusion. The TR-8 will transmit midi notes but not in a way that would be melodic.

synthesizers,388f57,Leviathant,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:51:26 2015 UTC,"Well I made an album of ""demos"" essentially with the MK and Kaosillator Pro where i'd trigger the various loops at different times. Sometimes i'd overdub some synth over the top of it or add some effects. Eventually I got a Korg Electribe ESX-1SD and THAT was one of the best pieces of gear I ever used.   I would record whole live sets into it by taking snippets of bass station patches to mix in with vocal samples and drums. I recorded a set I played solely on that you can listen here  I ended up selling the ESX-1 (for more than I bought it) to help buy the Aira gear and essentially have been using that to play since. Now that I have the new electribe sampler I am thinking i'll get back into more sample based stuff again."

I am quite tempted by the TR & TB having heard good things all around. On launch I was very sceptical but other than their aesthetic they've done everything right.  I agree with you that limitations can actually be a very good thing! I find the infinite possibilities of a DAW end up overwhelming and I much prefer to know a piece of hardware inside-out.

Nothing wrong with what those companies already have out, I'm just waiting to see what's next rather than ponder the existing models endlessly. If I had to get one now it would be the Blofeld I guess.  I'd love a polysynth with lots of modulation and options, like a new Andromeda or something. The Modal 008 is on my radar, but it's probably going to cost a fortune and what little sound demos exist have not enthralled me. In the meantime, working on my Boomstar polychain. 2 down 2 to go. With a couple eurorack pieces I'll have a discrete VCO polysynth not unlike an Obie 4 voice. Curious to hear how the Parva sounds once it comes out. Not interested in the P6. The Pro 2 is my main synth, I can't help but look at the P6 as a step down in most ways. Maybe an Ambika? I like what I've heard.  Just started my second 3U row of Eurorack. Modular is super intimidating at first, there's a big initial hurdle with cases and power supplies, let alone modules. But once you get a row or so of stuff, you start thinking about little things here and there that would be nice. That's where I'm at. I don't plan on a huge case of Eurorack anytime soon, but happy to fill up Happy Ending kits one module at a time until then.   Acidlab Miami. I hope they're working on a 909 too."

It's honestly kind of a tough call. The paraphony on the P2 does a lot, but not the crazy modulation sequences that the PEK can (in polyphony). I like the filters on the P2 way better. The CV ins and outs are a killer feature as well. I got over the lack of analog osc on the P2 the first time I plugged an analog (first Boomstar VCO out, now Eurorack) into the external input.

While I love the Prophet, it doesn't sound THAT analog and it's not very knobby for tactile sound design.  I'm considering the Moog Sub 37 but I really prefer desktop synths as I'm low on space.  However on the other hand the Analog Four seems quite interesting.  While it's analog its dedicated controls are more for sequencing than sound design.  I toyed with building a modular for a bit but I would get too bogged down on the technical side to finish songs."
synthesizers,388f57,the_cody,2,Tue Jun 2 22:27:19 2015 UTC,"Lack of physical space is my biggest limitation right now. I only have room for a very small/slim 49-key controller on my desk, and I want to have 61 keys for more instant access to keyswitches in Kontakt and Machfive. But I also want something on my desk that I can make sound with during moments that I just want to sketch out an idea without powering on my interface and firing up my DAW and creating a new project, etc.  Just last night I ordered three wall bracket kits so I can mount the three computer monitors on my desk to the walls, which will free up space for a bigger keyboard.  So my next big purchase is probably going to be a workstation synth. I'm between the Yamaha MOXF6 and the Roland FA-06. Both boards have a solid selection of sounds, but the Yamaha's more attractive for its Cubase integration, while the Roland's more attractive for its slightly slimmer size. Seriously don't know what I'm going to end up with, but leaning Roland partly because it will leave me a tiny bit more space on my desk and because they have a ton of free patches on the Axial website that work on the FA line."

Currently culling the Moog schematics to DIY one more VCO (Though I may say fuck it and just use other external sources I already have for an additional osc) and working on a custom power supply for the whole unit. I've already drawn up the sketch for the frontplate, but basically I'm making one giant enclosure for all the pieces.

My inspiration comes and goes in waves, and when half of every session is spent fucking with this setting or that, wondering why the JP4 isn't responding to MIDI, wondering why the BS2 keeps dropping its usb connection... it just kills it for me.

But good luck!  If you buy vintage, be sure to test as much as you can beforehand. With gear like the DX7, jab every membrane button and play every key, and test every input and output (or get an assurance you can return it if you're buying through the mail).  Vintage gear can be a great cheap route to victory, or it can saddle you with a big heavy lump of plastic and solder that you quickly learn to hate. Buying new, part of what you're paying for is peace of mind. But if you're careful and cautious and know what to look for, vintage gear is definitely worth investigating.  Personally when I think 'vintage' I envisage ARPs and Synthis and general pre-MIDI gear, but that's probably just showing my age.  Also personally, I don't know if I'd advise a DX7 unless you were hell-bent on a combination of a good keybed and 6-op FM in one package. What do you hope to get out of these synths? Would a new Blofeld or Ultranova give you what you're after from the DX (bearing in mind you could always add a cheap TX module to either of those)? Do you have a controller ready for the NL, or are you just planning to sequence it?  There's definitely a lot to be said for mastering one instrument, if you have the willpower..."

Anyway, there's something odd about how you're phrasing this question.  What sounds do you want to make that you can't make now? What other gear do you have?

Vintage gear is often difficult to program/underspecified in terms of MIDI/increasingly unreliable. You can, however, get synths such as the Access Virus B and C and the Nord Lead 2 for less than $800, and they are certainly up there closer to the A1 in spec than a DX7 or ESQ-1, if very different in sound to the vintage gear. There are so many inbteween options it isn't even funny. Korg Z1 if you want to do VA, FM and physical modellling stuff; KingKORG if you want probably one of the best VA polysynths on the market; Yamaha AN1x, Nord Lead 2, Virus B & C, Korg MS2000, Novation KS range and Supernova if you want dedicated VA synthesis; Blofeld, MicroQ and Evolver if you like messing with wavetable sounds.

I like 1:30 as well - I guess I like the more stripped back parts without the SH-101... hah, sorry. That's just personal preference for minimal music though, not criticism. What else did you use to make the track?  My only other comment is be careful not to overdo it with the delay. I don't really think you went super crazy, but it's on the edge in a couple parts. I know I used to have a habit of putting delay on almost everything because it makes the track sound much more full right away. The danger is muddying up the mix when there are several instruments at once. It sounds excellent on the piano chords, but I think some of the acid/chord/lead sounds would be stronger without it, or with less. You could also use more delay when there's only a single sound playing, but turn it down when new layers come in over top.  If we're talking effects rather than bigger aspects of the song, that's a pretty minor comment, so good job! Look forward to more!"
synthesizers,38aurm,BonjourMyFriends,2,Wed Jun 3 05:29:28 2015 UTC,"Great point about the delays. Automating the delay levels never occurred to me. I will give stripping out/toning down the delays a shot too.  Somebody else mentioned to me that he likd the non-101 parts better. You could be on to something. Maybe having them less prominent would help - was very unsure of the levels. Or canning the 101, keeping a few elements, and reworking into a new teack.  Besides the 101, all the sound sources were created in logic. Bassline, stereo spread chords that come in at the beginning, the sound that is pitched down as it plays at :34, the auto-panned chords around 2:14, and the big low bass at the same time all from retrosynth. The repeated low 16th notes are from the ESM. The whooshes came from the ES2. Piano and strings are from EXS24.  Thanks very much for what you wrote. Very easy to get stuck inside one's head.

I'm pretty pumped on that price and the fact that my Juno won't be missing it's 4th voice forever. I want to go all out and replace all the chips at once but my wallet doesn't like the idea.

It could also be a loose connection to the slider. It really won't cost much to get a dirty contact cleaned, or even a slider replaced, though, to put your mind at ease."

Sure the cleaner will flush a bit of dust out of the slider but unless the slider is totally clogged with dust, in which case it would likely not work as well as it does now, it is unlikely to have an adverse effect.   Just know that a little cleaner goes a long way and the lube spray will attract more dust, keep your gear covered and it will be a life saver for your pots in the long run."

This is pretty easy sound to get from most any synth, short attack, maybe a little wobble in the filter envelope, a low pass filter with moderate res. Make the release longer if you want it to be bell-like, short if you want it to sound like an organ. To my ear this is going through an amp and a speaker in a room... the whole track sounds pretty live. So if I was going to emulate I'd run it through an amp sim set to a clean patch, or even a bass amp, then set the cabinet to be open backed and move the mic as far away as I could and dial in a room reverb to be pretty present. It's not going to sound right by itself, though, for that kind of setup you need more instruments (with their own room verbs) in the mix and run it through some master comp to get things to stick. imo, at least.  Then I hear some backwards guitar samples, I think, which then seems to open up to a pad made of backwards guitar."

synthesizers,387yg1,ralyks45,3,Tue Jun 2 14:26:15 2015 UTC,"There are A LOT of factors here:  100 watt solid state or tube amplifier? A 50 watt Tube amp is about as loud as a 200 watt solid state amp.  If you friend has a 100 watt solid state then your bass amp would need to be 200-300 watts solid state.  Your bass amp should be on the floor and your friends amplifier should be up on a table so that the speakers aren't fighting for the same air space.  Also, you need to VERY carful playing bass AND keys through this keyboard amp as to make sure you dont override your speaker. Sure keyboard amps are generally very solid amps, however, without the right knowledge of what you are playing through it can lead to some very bad times."
synthesizers,387yg1,artfart,3,Tue Jun 2 14:57:01 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend perusing craigslist for a bass amp to see what's available around you. There are many, many amps out there that would suite your needs. I personally wouldn't focus on finding a good keyboard amp--just stick to bass amps and you'll be fine.  Also, wattage isn't the end-all-be-all when it comes to volume. I use a 150w Peavey Mark 3 in a metal/hardcore punk band and it's plenty loud with 15' cabinet. Find a deal!"
synthesizers,387yg1,sheboygan_sexpo,2,Tue Jun 2 14:57:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've found that a bass amp with a tweeter works really well for synths and they are much more plentiful on the used market."
synthesizers,387yg1,kirklandish,2,Tue Jun 2 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"I've played both bass and keys in a few bands, so I'll share a few things from my experience:   You will need way more than a 200w bass amp to ""compete"" with a 100w guitar amp (assuming it's a tube amp). A 100w guitar amp is ridiculously loud. It can overpower just about anything in its narrow frequency range. Unless they are playing large concert halls or outdoor gigs, a guitar player with a 100w amp should not be playing with their amp turned up anywhere near full volume. In rehearsal, the drummer usually sets the volume and everyone else adjusts to them. In my experience, it typically takes about a 200-300 watt bass amp to play comfortably in a band with a loud drummer and overdriven guitars.  As far as amps go, you'll have a lot more options if you shop for a bass amp instead of a keyboard amp. Most keyboard/synth players run straight into the PA, so keyboard amps are not a very common thing. That being said, any bass amp with a horn (tweeter) in the speaker cabinet should work okay for pulling double duty with keys. The mids might sound a little scooped, but it will be way better than trying to run bass guitar into a keyboard amp (which can cause impedance issues). Really, the best option is to have a bass amp for your bass guitar, and a PA for synths and vocals. That's the standard setup. When buying a bass amp, I highly recommend getting a rig with separate head and speaker cabinet rather than a combo amp. A head/cab setup is much more flexible and easier to upgrade later.  If you are on a tight budget, shop used. There is usually lots of great bass gear on craigslist. I find old Peavey amps and cabs to give the best bang for your buck. Avoid anything Behringer or speaker cabs with aluminum cones."

If money was no object i'd say svt classic with a 8x10 cab. Do note that most if bass amps have multiple inputs their usually a low and high gain input so it might be wise to invest in a mixer or a boss line selector.

Personally, I've never seen a reason to have a 100w guitar amp.  If you're in a room that's big enough to need 100w, then the room probably already has its own sound reinforcement.  If the guitar player needs 100w for their tone, they should probably look into a sustainer pedal or sustainer pickup."

Modern electronic implementations have improved on the expressivity by adding pedals, wheels, ribbons, and aftertouch to the basic paradigm, but these have always felt like imperfect compromises to me.  Compare with the eigenharp, which is designed from the ground up to be as expressive as possible."

EDIT: Now doing research I had thought that Vince Clarke had said he used 2 MS-20s as a stereo pair. Now I think he actually used two Roland System 100m units as a stereo pair. Significantly more expensive. Vince Clarke has a deceptively expensive sound (other examples include using an Arp 2600 for drums). Which is too bad for me because I'm trying to chase it.

Different tolerances of components and variable build quality might account for lower noise levels in some instruments though."

It doesn't really bother me all that much, i have a preset Template in ableton live where I've set up fx chains for all my hardware, so they are ready to go when i open live.  My MS20s FX chain starts with a LPF, before EQ,Comp,reverb etc.  Yea I'd say it could be down to the tolerances and build quality, like you were saying."

They're are quirks and I wish I could afford the module version cuz I like to mod and the build/parts quality does matter to me. you have one try this: open up both filters and turn up osc, then move the ESP filter pots and see if there's a very tiny bit of change in timbre, like the effect of the ESP filters are bleeding ever so slightly onto the main signal. Weird, still don't care, it's a fun and amazing sounding synth and at this new price it's a no brainer, especially for a first synth."

This was a date set by Elektron themselves, I haven't seen a single person putting pressure on them in any negative way — That is to say, being nothing but excited.  Then they set another release date for themselves, after we've seen an almost fully working version at Musikmesse '15. They missed that date too, albeit with one day.  Meanwhile, there has been very little information about the development. So even if people would've been upset and angry, it would've been understandable. Elektron made promises and didn't deliver.

Then theres the volume ducking and gating which I agree is sidechained and the whole thing is through a pretty hard master comp/ limiter, too. That synth patch probably doesn't sound that much soloed as it does in the mix."

It's an annual international digital creativity and electronic music festival in its 16th year. Being a working stiff, I wasn't able to take in as much of it as I would like but some highlights I attended included:   Takami Nakamoto & Sebastien Benoits's Reflections Basic House Richard Devine Roland's Salon Électro, featuring the new JD-XA, System-1M and some Reon driftboxes, plus all the AIRA gear and a performance by Matteo Showroom featuring Kilpatrick Audio's new Phenol, Elektron, Verbos Electronics, Tiptop Audio, Hexinverter and Doepfer. Workshop/lecture from Andrew Kilpatrick about designing synths and going-for-it when it comes to big ideas Workshop/lecture/performance from Mark Verbos about his philosophy and journey using synthesizers in live performance   I had a blast and only wish I could've taken in a lot more both during the day and late at night. Maybe I'll take some time off next year to try and get more done.  I got to spend some quality time with the new JD-XA and was surprised & impressed, and had a blast playing with the Phenol - can't wait to get mine at the end of the month. I had conversations with Andrew from Kilpatrick Audio and Mark Verbos, and spent a good long time catching up with both the President and Product Manager at Roland Canada who helped arrange for my crew to visit the Roland Design Group office and Roland museum on Lake Hamana, Japan last year. Roland's return into the modular synthesis world is, for me, one of the most exciting developments in the last few months and so we primarily talked about the philosophy behind that move, the story of the Japanese team searching for the right partner - and why it was Malekko Heavy Industries. If anybody has any questions I can do my best to try to answer them.  Here's a bonus video to me noodling around with my first patch on the new Phenol."

I've read I can trigger 3P by using a loud rimshot or cowbell as the metronome and routing the audio into the CV input. It tried it, however the sequencer is not stepping linearly and randomly skips steps. Could this be a problem with my trigger sound source or the 3P's sequencer? What else could I try.  The sequencer steps normally when using its internal clock."
synthesizers,382vbt,kopkaas2000,3,Mon Jun 1 15:19:01 2015 UTC,Try experimenting with the sound you send in. Ideally it should just be a single square pulse.  I had some luck in the past with a rimshot and the PolySix.
synthesizers,382vbt,d-a-v-e-,5,Mon Jun 1 15:28:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, it should be just a pulse, and it just one time up, then back to zero. A rimshot is a wave that goes up and down a few times, which will confuse the input of the Roland.  Your output should be louder than 0.7 volt. Normally, an output will be around 1 volt, while -6dB is just 0.5 volt. So crack it up loud, or it will not sync. Good wires will make it more stable."
synthesizers,382vbt,simulant_phantom,2,Mon Jun 1 15:56:30 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll create a pulse train using the arpeggiator on my Little Phatty and setting its tempo over MIDI.  I also noticed there is some decay in the rimshot and cowbell samples.
synthesizers,382vbt,d-a-v-e-,2,Mon Jun 1 16:08:06 2015 UTC,"you  can also shorten a sample to just one wave going positive, and back to zero. Then normalize it to 0dB. The sample should look like this: L___ Then you can send it to a free audio output."
synthesizers,382vbt,termites2,2,Mon Jun 1 16:29:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe try a simpler pulse for the trigger. There are lots of zero crossings in the rimshot or cowbell that might be confusing it. Try just a simple square topped pulse, like half a square wave, a millisecond long or so. I can't remember if the JX3P wants a positive or negative going pulse, so try both.   Might be easiest to make this pulse by using the waveform drawing tool in your DAW."
synthesizers,382vbt,simulant_phantom,2,Mon Jun 1 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"My other option is using the arpeggiator on my Little Phatty as the trigger and controlling its tempo over MIDI.

I also played around with using an Akai LPK25 to play the Streichfett's solo voice. This LPK has a built in arpeggiator and accepts midi clock through USB MIDI.  The Arturia Beatstep accepts MIDI notes to transpose whatever sequence it is playing, but it has no MIDI In DIN connector, but with the iCM4+, you can feed whatever physical keyboard you want into the Beatstep and Bob's your uncle.   Setup is difficult, though: the software is pretty awkward. Also, ""input"" and ""output"" terminology seems to be reversed. Once you get it all set up though, it is pretty solid.

synthesizers,382vbt,Ondist,2,Mon Jun 1 15:46:32 2015 UTC,"I picked up an Encore Expressionist for a steal this weekend, and it allows me to finally have this bi-directional setup going:   Moog Sub 37 MIDI out into Encore Expressionist Encore Expressionist converts note values to CV and uses aftertouch to mix in pitch vibrato via a fixed-rate LFO. CV channel out into the pitch CV input of the Therevox ET4.1   And heading the other way:   Ring CV out of ET4.1 into Pitch CV in of the Sub 37 Intensity key 1 out ET4.1 into Volume CV in of the Sub 37 Intensity key 2 out of ET4.1 into Mix CV in of Moogerfooger MF-102 ring modulator (just for fun)   What's fun about this setup is that by applying aftertouch pressure to the Sub 37 keyboard I can simulate the lateral-vibrato possible by the ondes Martenot's suspended keybed. It took awhile to get the right LFO rate as well as sensitivity adjustments for the aftertouch, but it really sounds convincing now and is quite natural to play. You can't use the mod wheel or a knob because while your right hand is playing the keyboard your left hand is operating the intensity key. I'd tried foot-pedal based solutions, and attempted this before with the Kenton Pro Solo, but unfortunately there was no way to scale the amount of LFO that was coming into the CV mix, so it was bonkers crazy over the top instead of the very subtle vibrato required.  Working the other way, I can mix the internal oscillators of the ET4.1 with a patch I made on the Sub 37 which approximates the same waveforms as the Therevox. If I off-set the two Moog oscillators to be a major third and perfect fifth away from the root of the ET4.1, I can get a glissando-friendly chord that can be played using the ring. Jonny Greenwood's student model ondes Martenot had this ability but it was a very late addition to the philosophy behind the instrument, but the effect can be really cool, especially if you tune the second ET4.1 oscillator down an octave and get a nice fat chord with all the expressiveness of the Therevox. It's ondes-nerd bliss I tells ya!  Being able to subtly mix in the Moogerfooger ring modulation is a nice way to get new, interesting waveforms for the ondes Martenot-type playing method, but it's also great just to get cold, digital or FM sounding tones out of the Sub 37 which is usually so organic and warm.

synthesizers,37ypto,lewisflude,2,Sun May 31 23:33:08 2015 UTC,"I guess it is the same reason people want expensive analog polysynths when good and cheaper VA synths are available. I genuinely like what roland has done with the TR8 (except for how it looks). They could have easily settled for using samples so the fact they created a virtual circuit board to create their sounds is really cool. However there is something nice about an old piece of analog gear. The sounds have drifted and there is character. Sometimes things not doing exactly what you want is part of the experience and sound. You'll never get that with a VA synth except when it has been programmed to do so (such as the 'slop' option on the prophet 12).  I'm unsure as to whether you'll be able to hear the difference between a real tr909 and the sounds on the TR8 in the mix. Certainly the sonic state comparison between an 808 and the tr8 you can hear some differences, even if they are really subtle. I reckon the biggest impact is how it is recorded and then processed. A lot of those classic tracks I love that have the 909 such as The Whistle Song by Frankie Knuckles are great because it was recorded onto tape and the sound quality isn't that good. It gives it warmth. I'm sure if you recorded a tr8 in the same way Frankie did it would sound good.  Can you get all the individual outputs through usb on the TR8 or are you always limited to to the assignable outs and stereo outs?"
synthesizers,37ypto,t0xicd0g,8,Mon Jun 1 03:59:27 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters the originals didn't have 64 step sequencers, they had 16 step sequencers. The TR8 is the closest to the TR programming and sound experience you're likely to get, and it can chain A and B sequences together for 32 step sequences.   The Electribe ER/EA1 have up to 64 step (4 bar) sequencers that are pretty solid and very cheap these days, the sequencer interface is obviously based on the TR but requires some shift button accessing for most of the deeper features (no changing swing or pattern length on the fly for instance)."

synthesizers,37yul3,GiveUsOurSynths,3,Sun May 31 15:49:26 2015 UTC,"That sound is produced by ""oscillator sync"" in which you sync one oscillator to another and then alter the pitch of the second oscillator, which creates this sound. As far as which synth it is in particular, it's hard to really tell because a lot of synths have this feature. You just need to have two oscillators, the ability to sync them, and the ability to change the pitch of the second oscillator independent of the first."

MPC1000 with JJOS is bigger, about the size of your MD, but is one of the best sequencing / sampling / beatmaking machines on the market - easy enough to make a program to trigger your MD with the pads for a new way to record beats that can change the kind of beats you make, if that makes sense."

With the sample option you'd have synth tweak options (filters, modulations) for the sample chops (though it won't chop for you, it would be easy to do this on your computer and keymap the chops).   I have the MD UW, I suppose you don't? Youd have maybe 40 seconds or so in there, plenty if you're just doing breakbeats and probably the sleekest way to trigger from MD is having the samples already in the MD.  Another option, though less portable obviously, is an Akai like a s5000 or s6000. I just got rid of my 5000, as it was pretty redundant with me using renoise primarily. But triggering the Akai from a drum machine is a rock solid and proven way of doing this stuff. They are like ten cents on the original dollar and really well built. A Volca or electribe is an absolute joke in comparison."

synthesizers,37xt6t,moveablefeist,20,Sun May 31 08:06:55 2015 UTC,If you are new to modular synthesis and are even considering something polyphonic it is a sign that you need to do a lot more reading (or you have an absurdly large amount of disposable income.)
synthesizers,37xt6t,FullFrontalNoodly,6,Sun May 31 13:00:04 2015 UTC,"sadly, this is 100% legit.  say you want to build a modular equivalent to an old Access Virus. I have one, the first one made, the one known as the A. you have two oscillators, plus a sub oscillator, with 12-note polyphony.  I think in Eurorack terms that would require 36 oscillators, and if you decided to get really cheap ones, you could go as low as $100 each. so you're already in for $3600 and you haven't distributed the control voltage to each voice yet. or set up amps, LFOs, envelopes, effects, etc. plus the oscillators you got for that low low price don't have the many different waveforms of a Virus.  I have Eurorack gear too. it has merits. I'm just saying, if you wanted to use Eurorack to copy a 20-year-old machine that you can buy used for $500, it could cost at least $3600 just to get started.  I'd say do a little research first. even if you can afford that - and you would have to very wealthy in that case - it's just not what Eurorack is good at."

While there are certainly ways to ""play chords"" somewhat easily on a modular, you must first have an understanding of the modular architecture, and for that you must do a far bit of reading."
synthesizers,37xt6t,Lurkmcgirk,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:31:57 2015 UTC,"nah just an explanation was good which i found on gearslutz, all cleared now, mono is how im going"
synthesizers,37xt6t,kirklandish,12,Tue Jun 2 04:22:38 2015 UTC,"A polyphonic synth can be thought of a containing one complete monosynth for EACH VOICE, plus additional circuitry to control those voices so they are accessed sequentially as you hold notes.  If you open up most polysynths, you will see that there is a main board with all the shared circuits and then voice cards which each contain the VCO/DCOs, VCF, VCA that make up the mono voice. Among the shared circuits might be ADSRs and LFOs, along with the keyboard control and note assignment.  To do this in modular requires enough modules to make a monosynth, but then duplicate that for each key in your chord. You're looking at some big money.  It sort of explains why an SH-101 is $(x), and a Jupiter-8 is $(8x).    An option you might consider is paraphonic in stead of polyphonic.  This is used in synths like the Polymath which I linked to in my other comment, the Sub37, Poly-800, etc.  With these, you have separate oscillators for each voice so you can play chords, but they all share a single VCF/VCA section.  It's more limiting that true polyphony, but if you are only hoping to play chords where each note therein starts and end at the same time, para will do just fine.  But to play a low chord and noodle some higher notes over top, you need true poly since the envelopes will either retrigger with each new note (causing your chord to pulsate) or hold causing your noodles to fade away.  This depends somewhat on your envelope settings, of course.  Fully open, it won't matter.   Edit: you mentioned that you have looked at Oberheim...and I mentioned the SEM modules.  It's clear to see that to make his 4-Voice, it requires a case with 4 SEMs, a keyboard, and a control module.  This is rather unique in the synth world, as most polys have their voice cards tucked away inside, but the Oberheim allows/forces the user to dial in subtle variations between the voices."

synthesizers,37xt6t,kirklandish,5,Tue Jun 2 04:38:31 2015 UTC,"Monophonic makes the most sense for modular, considering the difficultis of duplicating voices on a modular system. I doubt you could build a modular polysynth for less than  $2k.  If you really want flexible modulation routings and polyphony for under $2K, why not consider the Prophet 08? It has 4 LFOs and more flexible modulation routings than most synths. If you don't mind digital oscillators, I hsve seen the Prophet 12 go for $2k used. The modulation possibilities are even greater, since the oscillators are fair game as a modulation.  Of course, not everyone likes the DSI sound and it seems the fun of modular is choosing your own filters, etc."

synthesizers,37xt6t,t0nmontana,5,Tue Jun 2 04:23:51 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: A fucking nightmare.    A truly poly modular would require patching each individual voice exactly the same. It would be ""patch env to vcf"" it would be ""patch 8 individual envs to 8 individual vcfs"" then setting each of those 8 envs and each of those 8 vcfs to similar settings. And then doing that for every piece of each voice. That is why you don't see even folks with huge systems set up poly patches in the ""playing chords"" sense. You are looking at an absolute fucking nightmare, sorry.    If you want poly and kind of like modular, Nord Modular or G2 or Oberheim Matrix 12 or Xpander.    There are other synths that are analog, polyphonic, and patchable, the Korg PS 3100, 3200, and 3300 where there are shareable elements of the voice that can be patched. Don't know how well they'd play with another system.    Multi sampling a patch is definitely an option for a modular patch."

synthesizers,37xt6t,t0nmontana,3,Tue Jun 2 04:32:01 2015 UTC,"As others have said here you need to do a lot more reading, and also some self examination as to why you want a modular in the first place. If you want polyphonic, get a polyphonic synth - most modern analogue polys have almost modular routing for their modulations, and most virtual analogues going back to the turn of the century also have pretty deep engines (looking at you, Alesis Ion, Virus and Z1). It's fair to say that a synth like the Prophet 08, 12, Virus Ti is pretty much 'modular in a box'.  The big question though that you need to ask is ""Why do I want modular?"" if you're bedazzled by cables and flashing lights and the idea of living in a sound lab, then maybe you need to step back fro a bit before you start pulling the trigger on a very expensive habit on a whim. If there's a certain sound or area you want to experiment in, then that should focus your attention on certain types of modules (I was interested in waveshaping to mess with LFO patterns in a way no synth I had could do, so I focussed on stuff like that)."

Played it through a chain of guitar pedals, starting in mono and ending in stereo, and involving two loopers and 3 delays I think. Then through a mixer, with compression on the main channels, and dry-cut delay + reverb in the effects send/return. From there, onto tape, then back from the tape through the mixer (with more compression, not sure whether I added delay/reverb again or not..) and into my PC's audio in.  I think it came out really well. It's basically just synthy ambient noodling through the effects I mentioned, though I recorded it by jamming until I had loops that worked well together, then tried to figure out how to make an opening with them."

synthesizers,37v614,OneMillionTroops,4,Sat May 30 17:43:47 2015 UTC,"The Xiosynth is a great synth engine crammed into a crappy interface. You'd be much better off getting hold of the X Station equivalent model which is identical in function and sound, and also has a wealth of knobs and sliders for easy programming.  Or if you don't need an audio interface, you could go the whole hog and get a KS4 or 5 which is basically 4 Xiosynth / X station engines wrapped up in one synth (4 part multitimbral). If space is an issue the K Station is a very, very similar synth but much smaller."
synthesizers,37v614,t0xicd0g,4,Sat May 30 20:44:03 2015 UTC,I second the X station vote.   It's nice to have those extra knobs and keys. Really nice feel to the keybed too.   Will Work great as a Midi controller down the road and it's not that much bigger than my friends Xio.
synthesizers,37v614,zegogo,3,Sat May 30 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"The Xiosynth is a great synth engine crammed into a crappy interface   This. I got a xio as my first synth. Probably would've done more for me if I could play keys better, but I wanted to jump into making sounds and fiddling.... Not too great for that. I think it would be very hard to get efficient with sound shaping using the interface, even with experience. That said, the xy pad definitely adds something for performance, and there's a lot of power and control when you dive into the menus and such."
synthesizers,37v614,unfish,3,Sun May 31 06:24:05 2015 UTC,"I would say so, yes. It has some menu diving, but not much. I own the X-Station myself, it has a few more knobs and the XioSynth is almost exactly the same when it comes to the engine (the XioSynth has some upgrades though).  For jazz though you might want to look into the 49 key version, since you'll be grabbing for some awkward chords that might make the 25 key feel a bit too small."

synthesizers,37v614,octopus-crime,1 point,Sun May 31 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"It's good that you want to help, but you need to pay more attention to what the OP was asking for; they are an experienced keyboard player, so a JD-Xi with minikeys won't cut it, and a Juno 106 with no velocity sensitivity also won't be a great starter synth. The JD and the Juno are also both very expensive, and both have known issues that are extremely expensive to get fixed (keyboard black gunk in the JD and the voice chip failure in the 106). On top of all that, the Juno is an incredibly limited synth that he will likely grow out of fairly quickly.  There are plenty of great polyphonic synthesisers that are perfect for learning sound design on that are much, much cheaper than the two vintage synths you recommend; some are discussing a few of them in this thread such as the X-station and KS range; there are also the Yamaha AN1x, Alesis Ion, Korg Z1, Nord Lead 2, Roland SH201 just to start."
synthesizers,37v614,lerba,0,Sun May 31 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"Good point, but as this is a synth-focused sub and he mentioned being new to synths, I'd recommend something with more intuitive, simple and hands-on controls for a beginner learning synthesis. I agree, the keys on the mentioned roland synths are crap, but then again they all can be controlled with a midi keyboard of choice. Most of the synths you mentioned here could be overwhelming to program for a beginner in my opinion."

X-Station and KS range - knob perfunction; Nord lead 2 - renowned for it's knob per function interface; Roland SH201 - beautifully laid out simple to follow knob per function with only a few shifted or menu buried functions; AN1x has a far easier to follow programming function than the JD800 which is a very busy and overwhelming synth for a beginner. Of the ones I mention, only the Z1 and Ion feature extensive menu use. You probably need some more experience with this gear before you embarrass yourself start trying to tell people who've owned them that they are not easy to program."

Ease of programming is a matter of taste and I'm not going to argue with you about preferences. I have no problem creating patches with my 5-knob shruthi but I'd never suggest a beginner should buy it. If I were a beginner learning about oscillators and filters I would start from a knob-per function monosynth like microbrute. But then again, OP was asking about polysynths which makes it tricky. I think the juno series is the closest to this."
synthesizers,37v614,octopus-crime,1 point,Sun May 31 22:14:53 2015 UTC,"It's really not a matter of better, it's a matter of calling a bunch of synths laden with knobs and sliders per function ""difficult to program"" and not user friendly, which is not a matter of taste, it's a matter of just not knowing what you are talking about.

Once you figure out how to set it up for how you want to use it, it's a self-contained wonder box.   Maschine studio is the same and then some, but of course it's offset by needing the computer at all times (and a sound card).    It really depends on how you like to work, and can you force yourself to ignore the computer aspect of Maschine.  By far Maschine is more flexible on all fronts, though you have to think in a rather old-school MPC mindset to really gel well with how it's laid out.  On the plus side, you cna use samples and softsynths, plus all your 3rd party plug ins.  I've stuck mainly with the included content as usual, but can you imagine Maschine Studio running 8 tracks of Omnishere with Equilibrium's to fine-tune things?  :)  The OT is great if you must have hardware, and don't mind having only up to 8 tracks total.  Minus one for resampling, and another for a master track.  Plus, while you can load single cycle wavs and make a basic synth on a track, it really is only meant for 4 bar audio loops.  Well, maybe not meant, as you can use longer ones streaming from the card.  But then you're limiting yourself on how you can affect longer samples like that (no slicing, editing beyond 4 bars)."

I knew JD-XA was developed by the group that does most of the 'safer' keyboards at Roland, like the Fantom series or what have you, and they take heat from time to time with not taking risks or being interesting.    This keyboard is capable of great things, and my guess is we'll start seeing it on stage with touring keyboard players. It's pretty immediate to get into some great sounds, and both the analog and digital sections were a lot of fun to play around with.   The construction was solid despite what the shiny plastic top might lead you to believe. The knobs were nice and solid and I dug the keyboard action.

There's not a ton of that going on in this sub, even though I'm sure plenty of people have ideas and things to share. Perhaps having loosely-themed threads (drum synthesis week, FM week, physical modelling week, etc.) would help fuel discussion. Thoughts?"
synthesizers,37q5o7,MultiplyTheBear,6,Fri May 29 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of reoccurring weekly threads like Midi Monday and the Friday Hangout, so more would be welcome!  I don't think it's necessary to limit the content of each thread by giving them a theme, as it might not be particularly productive on some weeks due to the subject matter. Just basically leave it broad, like you mentioned--synthesis techniques, tips, ""how do I get this sound?"", etc."

Midi on the first Monday of the month, Synthesis on the second Monday, Workflow on the third Wednesday, etc.. Skip the sticky if there is an AMA around the same time.

I thought I had tried out all the modern monosynths that I'd ever wanna try out. But I forgot about one.   THE EVOLVER. Gonna order one this week once some more of my stuff sells. Really looking forward to it. It almost seems like having a lil modular in a tiny box, I read through this unofficial manual and it seems incredible. Video demos sound great and I've had it recommended to me by a buddy of mine in the past. Should scratch some nerding-out-modulate-everything itches I've been having.  Especially looking forward to using it paired with the ESX2 I ordered which should be here next week ...as well as my third (and final) OP-1. Getting a brand new one this time, keeping that lil guy til it dies. Yeah, I know, I'm too impulsive or whatever - Sue me.  Also seriously considering buying an H9 and selling my Capistan. I've had the ModFactor before and liked it for what it was. I was looking at a second-hand Space, but then I remembered the H9. It isn't as hands on as the larger pedals, but having access to whatever Eventide algorithm you want for $20 a pop is appealing - the iPad integration looks nice too. Any H9 dudes or dudettes out there?"
synthesizers,37q5o7,slujj-vohaul,3,Fri May 29 20:47:09 2015 UTC,"The Evolver is awesome for the price. Patch editing takes a bit of getting used to and the encoders aren't great, but the sounds you get are well worth the effort."
synthesizers,37q5o7,ruuurbag,1 point,Fri May 29 15:32:26 2015 UTC,"I've mostly avoided DSI stuff because my first analog synth was the Mopho and I was kinda unimpressed. Looking back, I think I might have been dismissive too early and didn't give it a fair shake. Not a huge fan of the Curtis filters, but the Evolver has so much else going on that it doesn't really matter. I always seem to gravitate to loops and and drones, so I think I'll get along really well with it."
synthesizers,37q5o7,slujj-vohaul,1 point,Fri May 29 16:14:20 2015 UTC,I know what you mean. The filter on my Mopho really rubbed me the wrong way for a long while after I got it. If it wasn't for the build quality and all the modulation options I probably would have sold it after a few months.   My opinion of it changed over time though. Now I love it. Now that I am a lot more comfortable with it and can find the sweet spot on the filter I find myself being quite a bit more forgiving of it.
synthesizers,37q5o7,slamgauge,2,Fri May 29 16:24:56 2015 UTC,I've thought about one of these myself a couple of times.   As an effect processor alone they are worth it.   My friend has a polyevolver keyboard and it is intense to say the least. The bit crushing and stereo delay make me smile every time I touch it.
synthesizers,37q5o7,ohmtheory,2,Fri May 29 23:25:46 2015 UTC,"Yep - the onboard effects aren't the greatest thing out there, but when paired with the filters and sequencer they become really special. I'm really excited about routing my gear through the Evolver and applying sequenced FX, sampling to my OP-1 or ESX2, chopping, re-sequencing, re-routing again - lets just say I anticipate having lots of ways to mangle shit up."
synthesizers,37q5o7,slujj-vohaul,2,Fri May 29 16:52:22 2015 UTC,I had an evolver for a minute and was blown away by the mod routings also love how tank-like the hardware was (minus the encoders yes...).  i ended up reselling it because i found it to be seriously unruly and the best elements i got out of it were too wild and not immediately controllable for my tastes.
synthesizers,37q5o7,jahreed,1 point,Fri May 29 17:00:54 2015 UTC,For a minute I thought you meant you had 3 OP-1's at once. Which would be cool. Sad to hear they busted! Are they known for being unreliable? I was debating between an OP-1 and a RADIAS....
synthesizers,37q5o7,revolved,2,Fri May 29 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"None of them broke, sorry if I worded that poorly. I sold two of them in the past to fund other gear purchases. When I sold the first one, I ended up buying a second two or three weeks later because I realized I had made a mistake flipping it. I sold the second one knowing I'd regret it but I really needed a new computer at the time. Now I'm at a place where I can pick up a third and I plan on holding onto it. Maybe not my favorite straight-ahead synth of all time, but definitely my favorite ""groovebox""."
synthesizers,37q5o7,slujj-vohaul,2,Fri May 29 15:38:21 2015 UTC,"Speaking of the OP1.   I had one a while ago. I did like it but  I had many reasons why I did not.  That being said, the main reason that I let it go was that I would get past a subtle click that happened at the end of each loop.   Because of that and the other reasons I gave up and sent it back. Was I missing something?   Best Groovebox is debatable, shall we? :)"
synthesizers,37q5o7,ohmtheory,2,Fri May 29 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"Best Groovebox is debatable, shall we? :)   Yeah fair enough. I only got the clicks here and there, I couldn't tell if there was rhyme or reason to when it occurred and when it didn't.  The lack of a proper grid sequencer and the reliance on the 4-track would surely be enough to turn most people off - and it could be argued that it isn't a proper groovebox without one of those (that's why I used the air quotes). It probably shouldn't be somebody's only synth, but it's definitely something extremely fun to have in your setup. I'm not a serious musician whatsoever, so fun factor is my priority when it comes to synths."
synthesizers,37q5o7,slujj-vohaul,2,Fri May 29 16:56:29 2015 UTC,"I agree and maybe I would of had better luck if I would have recorded an extended loop.   I was making the loop using the grid pattern editor Then recording it.  I would then make a new loop (Just the highhats or something) and record that I would then paste the highhat loop in front of the original loop (this is how I myself create a tune - kind of like clips in ableton)   Anyway.. I would then get clicks at the beginning of each loop..   I wanted to love it. I really did. For a battery powered sampler/sequencer/synth nothing else came close at the time.   I wish they would make a new one, a MKII with more internal memory. (I think they are out of OS memory and have to refactor code for enhancements)   In the new one I would love for more effects (a dedicated filter to be specific) and multiple patterns with pattern chaining using the grid editor.   Best groovebox - If we state that a laptop can be involved then the Maschine hands down.   No laptop, which is probably fair....  The RYTM or A4 or Octatrack ::devil horns::"
synthesizers,37q5o7,ohmtheory,3,Fri May 29 17:05:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I haven't had any clicks at all while looping stuff on the OP-1. Granted, so far I've stuck to traditional time signatures and song structures.   This is a little difficult to explain without just showing you, but I always set the loop in relation to the little measure markers within the tape section (the notches) instead of setting the beginning and the end to the actual music. Shift+the arrow keys moves from one notch to the next. I always lift and paste in relation to these markers. Everything easily stays in time and I haven't heard any clicks, or hiccups during anything I've recorded."
synthesizers,37q5o7,sheboygan_sexpo,1 point,Fri May 29 17:18:23 2015 UTC,I did play with the markers. I tried to record long and use the markers to set end points.  The click wasn't as audible but it was still there for sure.   Maybe with more time I would of gotten it.  Not sure.
synthesizers,37q5o7,ohmtheory,2,Fri May 29 17:51:27 2015 UTC,Could it be that there was a drum sound cutting off abruptly at the end of the loop? Perhaps the click would disappear if you record 2 bars and begin looping the second.
synthesizers,37q5o7,travx259r,1 point,Fri May 29 18:22:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah - I mainly work the same way as you, perhaps that's why I rarely encountered the problem. I'll have to experiment when I get my new one to see if there's a way to force the issue."
synthesizers,37q5o7,slujj-vohaul,2,Sat May 30 00:47:09 2015 UTC,I'll do the same. I need to finish a couple demos on it this weekend.
synthesizers,37q5o7,sheboygan_sexpo,2,Fri May 29 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"Best groovebox - If we state that a laptop can be involved then the Maschine hands down.   The Maschine is the only piece of gear that's remained a constant in my setup. I got an MK1 five (or six?) years ago and it's still holding up. I've always held onto it even during times when it wasn't getting used - just tons of value after all the updates over the years and selling it for a quick $200 or whatever would be silly. That said, I might flip the hardware for peanuts and get an MK2 at some point. Knowing NI, there's an MK3 right around the corner though."
synthesizers,37q5o7,slujj-vohaul,2,Fri May 29 19:35:33 2015 UTC,"Isn't that the truth.   NI did that to me so many times.  Even if there isn't there will be a half price sale 31 days after you buy your new MKII.   When I got back into making music like four or five years ago I picked up a machine and was just astounded by it.   No polyphony problems, ridiculous amounts of parameter editing per track, five gigs of samples. Easy as can be pattern creation, chaining and song creation. Super easy wave editing. Effect and parameter automation. Ease of editing said recorded automation through the UI.   Heck you could even have Ableton load the VST more than once and have different songs on each instance, hot swapping which VST instance the Maschine's hardware was controlling.  (the amount of songs only limited by computer resources) You could even drag and drop clips from Ableton into the Maschines VST UI.   I could go on and on. I had it for a month and closed the laptop lid because I did not need it anymore.   Sadly, I got rid of the laptop in my studio and so went the Maschine. When I started buying drum machines to replace it I had forgotten what I would be missing. Started with a Tempest -- don't get me started..   I do love my RYTM though so there is no looking back, and the Octatrack is my favorite piece of gear ever so.... but I gel with the Elektron work flow, some don't."
synthesizers,37q5o7,ohmtheory,2,Fri May 29 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want out of it really.   The Ot is a sampler at heart and a damn good one at that. If you want to be able to live sample other sound sources then you wont the OT.   If for a drum machine you think that you'll mainly be using samples then again I would suggest the Octatrack.   For me, the OTs handles my samples of all types. weather it be percussion or vocals, or my Juno 60 (gear with no ability to sequence - no midi, no CV)   So, if you want to be able to sample your other sound sources then the OT is for you.   Once you have your sound source the OT allows you to do so much with the samples - You have three LFOs per track. (one in the RYTM) You can edit the LFO pattern too, which you can't do in the RYTM.   You have two effects per track, one of them being the filter (for me at least) and you can assign them in what ever order that you'd like. So you can pass a comb filter to a low pass if you want etc.   Also if you want to be able sequence midi with your device then the OT is what you want.   If,,, you want a drum synthesizer then the RYTM is what you want. It does everything a good drum machine should do. The sample management is a bit clunky of you ask me. But it works.   The sample editing is simply setting start and end point. No slices or anything like that. You can bit crush it and such too.   It is a straightforward drum machine. The kick will always be a kick and so on. (unless you use samples and turn the synth voice down)  You can certainly make bass lines with voices though. The low tom is almost there on it's own.   The pads are okay but you do have to tap them. It can be a bit annoying cause you need to use them to select the track. When you would rather press a track button instead of hitting a pad.   The performance aspect is amazing but I use it less than I should at this point. (the setting of parameter locks to a specific pad and the setting of parameter locks to a pad that respond to pressure)  So, I can't speak on that at this point.   Dunno man, if you have any questions shoot."
synthesizers,37q5o7,ohmtheory,10,Fri May 29 18:13:12 2015 UTC,"I did an in-person workshop on Wednesday going over making drum sounds on a monosynth and sampling the result. I took my Minibrute and Octatrack. Made the drum sound on the MB and used the OT for effects and sampling. I don't really go out much (I'm kind of a homebody) and have only ever played a few shows, so this was a totally new experience for me. However, it was fun as all hell. The workshop was supposed to be 30 minutes, but I was up for 50 minutes of unscripted non-stop talking (the guys running the event and the guy up next were all standing and listening, not noticing the time as well). It's a whole world of difference teaching people who are interested in the topic than it is training people at work or lecturing other students in a classroom.  I had some technical difficulties (for some reason, I couldn't get the buffer to record from Main or the Neighbor track to the Thru track I had the Minibrute running on), but I worked though them. I got a little flustered from that and forgot to kill the recording trig, so I accidentally recorded the snare sound over the buffer that had the kick sound (there goes making a beat). But, I went through making a kick with a self-oscillating filter, using band pass to emulate two amp envelopes when making a snare sound and using FM from the LFO to the oscillator to make hats/cymbals without resorting to noise.  It was also full of a lot of questions from the audience on gear and technical aspects of why I'm doing certain things (like why I'm not using noise for hats). Lots of tangents, which works in that context (I've been ""banned"" from training at work because I talk way too quickly, use too much jargon, go off on too many tangents and cover way too broad of topics in too short of time).  Definitely a fun experience and one I would do again."

Change the active steps on the sq1 or keys (or the sequence length in the mc202) and you've got a polyrhythmic melody that might never repeat.    I need like 5 of these :D"

synthesizers,37q5o7,Ondist,6,Fri May 29 17:53:02 2015 UTC,"Mutek began this week, so I went out last night and saw Takami Nakamoto & Sebastien Benois and their hybrid-drum meets laptop & synth ""Reflections"" set, Basic House getting the fuck down with some modular techno, and the star of the evening, Richard Devine's Canadian premiere of ""Disturbances"" which was an incredible patch that he really used to its full potential to make some unforgettable moments. Even he seemed a bit surprised every now and again, and seemed to be a bit taken aback at how well it went over with the Montreal crowd. Very different show from when I saw him at last year's Tokyo Festival of Modular. His evolution is fun to watch.  This afternoon I'm going to head over to the Phi Center & Moog Audio and see talks/gear from Roland, Verbos, Elektron, Kilpatrick Audio, Hexinverter, Tiptop and Subpac. Should be a good time - first chance to see the Phenol I helped kickstart.  I bought an Encore Expressionist, so I now have 8 channels of high-resolution MIDI to CV at my fingertips. Will be super useful for converting aftertouch sent by the Sub 37 into subtle vibrato going into the Therevox ET-4. Until someone makes a laterally-moving CV keyboard this is as close as I'm going to get to an ondes Martenot style expressive keyboard sound. Will use some of the other channels for my SH-101 and eventually the Realistic MG-1 once it gets serviced. I like how you can configure it so that incoming MIDI notes which fall below a certain value go to one output (bass synth) and others go to another output (lead synth). Pretty nifty, but makes me want that Korg MS-20 module even more now...  My Juno-66 kit is in Canada, going through customs now and will hopefully be on hand to be dropped off with my Ju-6 late next week. I'm beyond stoked to have this beast MIDI-powered.

I posted a message on Korg's facebook account asking how much longer until we start getting them in Canada... no reply. That kind of thing really bothers me. Just TALK to your clients, let them know what's going on. If it's going to be 2 more moths, FINE (sorta). As long as you tell me, I can deal with it. But without knowing anything I'm totally in the dark and it's a tad annoying.  Anyway... I got another new toy so I had something in the meantime. I let this go for a few weeks but then about 2 weeks ago I saw a few of you saying you'd really like one of these so I thought I'd better grab it while it was available. So, my apologies if someone else wanted it. I left it for quite a while but no one bought it.  So I present to you my new.... Kurzweil K2000!!!   https://flic.kr/p/tsQDqw  I only had a couple of hours to play with it last night but it's pretty damn cool. It has the best french horns I've heard yet. The strings are amazing too. And just overall, I find this thing to be VERY expressive. The velocity and pressure sensitivity on the keyboard work perfectly to let you really PLAY the instrument. This is why I MUCH prefer an instrument with a matched keyboard rather than a module you use with Midi. It never seems to work as well.  There are also some really cool synth sounds in the presets.  A lot of very nice analog sounds. I don't think I would use this instead of one of my actual analog synths but it's not bad at all. If you wanted an all-in-one synth, this is definitely the one!   The only problem so far is that the LCD doesn't have a light and I can't see it very well. I don't know if that's the way it was made or if there is something burned out that I can replace. EDIT: looked around a bit and found some replacements, looks like a lot of work though. I might get my tech to do it someday.  Also, how the heck do you clean it!? The plastic is kind of rough and tears paper towel to shreds! It's covered in dust but I ended up making it worse.  I played one of these a long time ago when they were new and I wasn't too interested or impressed at the time but I have to say that already I think this may become one of my more used instruments in my collection!  EDIT: The store has told me they received 2 white faced units recently so they expect the rest will be along soon, however they also had not heard when that might be."

synthesizers,37q5o7,jahreed,1 point,Fri May 29 20:33:09 2015 UTC,LOL at the picture of the MIA synth.  How are you liking the K2K?  i got one about 10 years ago for $40 at an estate sale and it's still got a special place in my heart for evolving subtle soundscapes...it's like the ambient/soundtrack master for me.  reminds me i need to replace the battery!  :)
synthesizers,37q5o7,ScottFromCanada,2,Sat May 30 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"Heh, I had to shipped to me and the store checked it over first and said the battery was low so they replaced that before sending it.   Anyway, so far I really like it a lot. I think there is an 80s type reverb on everything so it makes it sound a bit dated but overall the sounds are outstanding. LOVE the french horns and strings and some of the synth sounds have some movement to them which is really nice. The acoustic guitar sounds are really nice too. I have a feeling this synth was used a lot on the Yes album Big Generator.  There was one sound, cant remember which I noticed I could play something, press the sustain pedal, then play a new note and use the bender. The bender changed the pitch of the new note but left the held notes alone. Awesome. I can see this thing has a LOT of power and some features I might really like.   I was surprised how cheap it was though. Under $400 for this one.  I had no idea they had depreciated so much.  I know age has a lot to do with it, but it really does sound great. Warm, and very analog at times, so I think it's still a very nice instrument to have! I think it will inspire me a lot. Guess I should get some floppy disks though! (After I threw them all out years ago)"

The linndrum is my favorite drum machine and it would be awesome to have a modernized version with the classic samples and some new ones, for a $400-500 price tag. There's no ""analog recreation"" that has to be done either. I just want a dedicated box for my favorite drum machine that's easy to pick up and program, reliable, sounds good, and doesn't cost $1000+. The simplicity is the most important part.  Edit: I emailed Roger and he crushed my dreams, said he's not interested in redoing something he's already done. :/"
synthesizers,37q5o7,Kidney05,2,Fri May 29 15:17:49 2015 UTC,"Consider the Roger Linn Design AdrenaLinn III. While marketed as a guitar stompbox, the drum sounds are quite good, MIDI controllable, and can be routed through the beat-synced effects, which can also be sequenced. It only has 4 drum parts and a limited bank of sampled sounds, but most of them sound pretty darn good. It lacks an easy hands-on interface, but everything including sequencing drum beats, can be done on the box. Of all of my drum-machine choices (Tempest, TR-8, Volca Beats, Volca Sample, OP-1, Electribe 2, and the useless Rhythm Wolf), I find myself returning again and again to the AdrenaLinn III for any portable setup where size is a factor. Best sounding hardware drum solution for the size. Great also for generating solid MIDI Time Clock and also has MIDI-thru when slaved. Will take any level audio input and put out a nice line-level stereo output. Powered by a 9v center positive wart and works very well with my OneSpot with a polarity reverser. I agree with you, however, an inexpensive Roger Linn drum machine would be very cool.   Here is a jam from February with the AdrenaLinn III used strictly for its drums. All-hardware, improvised. Moog Minitaur controlled by a KMI QuNexus w/ KMI Expander running MIDI into a MidiSolutions Merge merging with MIDI clock from the AdrenaLinn III to sync the Minitaur's LFO. (The AdrenaLinn III also provides MIDI bus power to power the MidiSolutions Merge). The Minitaur runs into a modded MXR Carbon Copy delay which is synced to MIDI clock via a Molten Voltage MIDI Delaytion. From the Carbon Copy, the audio goes into the Pigtronix Infinity looper, which is also synced to the MIDI clock. I designed each Minitaur sound on the fly using the Minitaur's on-board controls. The AdrenaLinn's audio goes directly into the mixer."
synthesizers,37q5o7,synthador,2,Fri May 29 16:57:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information. Are the samples the real linndrum? The part that concerns me most is the interface and the limit of drum parts. Otherwise, looks like a pretty cool device."
synthesizers,37q5o7,shomusic,1 point,Fri May 29 17:01:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm, neither the manual nor the website provide the origin of the drum sample sounds. Many of the sounds are of acoustic rock and jazz-style kits consistent with the primary marketing as a guitar effects unit. The interface is a steep learning curve for setting drum patterns. There's a SoundTower editor at additional cost, but in my opinion its also hard to use. On the bright side, there are 127 preset slots which are selectable via MIDI, pot or the on-board foot switch. If your live set involves live drum pad performance or live beat sequencing, it won't work for that (though you could use an Electribe or something like that as a MIDI looping controller). If using preset patterns is ok, on/off and pattern switching is super easy by hand, MIDI or even by foot."

synthesizers,37q5o7,really_dont_care,2,Fri May 29 22:44:45 2015 UTC,"There are two ways to do midi controls for the Octatrack.   There is the standard way where you just map CCs from your controller to handle specific parameters in the Octatrack. With this method each track can be on it's own midi channel so it would be nice if your controller can define each knob/slider with a CC and midi channel, but you can put all of the controls on one midi channel if you need to.  The other way to map controls changes dynamically with the track in focus on the Octatrack. This works great if you are only going to be controlling one track at a time. Basically you set up your CCs to control the various parameters of a single track and as you select a different track your midi control will now work on that track. i.e. You set one knob for filter cut off and the knob controls that parameter for the track you have selected on the Octatrack, switching tracks on the Octatrack changes the parameter that is being controlled.    You can actually use both of these control mapping techniques at the same time if you are so inclined."

The MPC just feels a lot more intuitive for drum programming, and not quite as rigid in feel, but it also isn't as fast of a machine, nor is it as well built...plus, I'm still learning it, so I might just be blinded by the new and shiny aspect.

Instead (predictably), I ended up playing a few Novation synths that I had previously been unable to demo.  The Bass Station 2 is the real deal. There's not much to it, but what there is, is marvelous.   The Ultranova--well, that's a little different. I sat down in front of it and immediately went into the whole ""preset browsing"" routine. I hate that so much. I can tell that it's an immensely interesting synthesizer (and can occasionally be had, used, at a very attractive price!) but I hadn't read the manual first.   It got me thinking--how do people buy/demo synths with lots of patch memory? Preset browsing is well and good, and it's probably what most people need. After all, non-synthesists talk in terms of ""sounds"" in a keyboard. But even a modestly-priced digital synth like the Ultranova can have synthesis options that are very deep and complex. How do people sit down and work through them?  If you're a synthesist, it's no big deal to move from a Moog *Phatty to the KARP to the MS-20 Mini to a Brute to a BS2. They're different, but it's simple to come to grips with what you have. How do you do that with an Ultranova?"

The good; 2 DCOs with sync that can also FM the filter, which is a really nice sounding low pass analogue affair with a pleasant resonance that isn't as whistly as 80's Korgs and Akais; 2 separate envelopes that can be sent independently to each oscillator for pitch control (great with sync sounds); a range of interesting waveforms, including a 'pinched' triangle.

It's taking me a while to get back into the Yamaha mindset but it's so great to get back into the hardware workflow.   2.) I'm using a Casio CZ-3000 as a master keyboard hooked up to the Rm1x. I was reading through the Casio's manual and I discovered something cool that I had no idea the CZ-3000 could do. Apparently in the MIDI settings it can be set to function as an 8 part multitimbral tone generator.

Its strength is is playback and muting/unmuting the eight tracks and changing patterns as it plays.   You cannot edit a pattern as it plays.  Every change in step data requires a stop/start.  MMT-8s are great for being able to change the structure of a song as it is played back....like let the drums and bass go another 32 bars before bringing in the arp pattern....but not good for changing the arp chord in realtime.

synthesizers,37px3x,autowikibot,2,Fri May 29 14:38:19 2015 UTC,"Section 8. Formant synthesis of article  Speech synthesis:       Formant synthesis does not use human speech samples at runtime. Instead, the synthesized speech output is created using additive synthesis and an acoustic model (physical modelling synthesis).  Parameters such as fundamental frequency, voicing, and noise levels are varied over time to create a waveform of artificial speech. This method is sometimes called rules-based synthesis; however, many concatenative systems also have rules-based components. Many systems based on formant synthesis technology generate artificial, robotic-sounding speech that would never be mistaken for human speech. However, maximum naturalness is not always the goal of a speech synthesis system, and formant synthesis systems have advantages over concatenative systems. Formant-synthesized speech can be reliably intelligible, even at very high speeds, avoiding the acoustic glitches that commonly plague concatenative systems. High-speed synthesized speech is used by the visually impaired to quickly navigate computers using a screen reader. Formant synthesizers are usually smaller programs than concatenative systems because they do not have a database of speech samples. They can therefore be used in embedded systems, where memory and microprocessor power are especially limited. Because formant-based systems have complete control of all aspects of the output speech, a wide variety of prosodies and intonations can be output, conveying not just questions and statements, but a variety of emotions and tones of voice.

It's probably a little outdated in todays world, but it will do the job.   Roland VM3100 Pro digital mixer with R-bus PC interface card   Don't know if you could still hook it up to a PC, but you'd need a mixer anyway.   Behringer MX602 compact line mixer   who needs 2 mixers.   M-Audio 4x4 computer MIDI interface   should still work.   Yamaha G50 guitar/midi interface with hex pickup   yeah.. because, awesome.

Apparently there are drivers for the Mia available, for windows 7 at least.  As I've pretty much decided I don't want to touch a desktop for production anymore at the moment I don't have a use for it. Might come in handy at some point though.  The VM3100 is pretty cool and has a lot of features, and can also be used as a MIDI faderbox.  The only issue is that it is only 44khz/24 bit internally as far as I know; it outputs 16 bit 44khz SPDIF but  unfortunately it seems from what I've read that the main digital outputs are truncated, not dithered, which is bad.

synthesizers,37pwzl,grauniad_angel,3,Fri May 29 18:27:39 2015 UTC,"Are you planning on playing live? If so, are you planning on running a sampler / backing audio from your laptop? Because your sampler is probably good to keep hold of, especially if you're already comfortable with using it. You could sell it and replace it with an MPC-4000 or an MPC-2500 with JJOS, those are both gonna be easier to use for drums, and will do melodic type sampling as well. Plus, they are legit hardware sequencers.  The K1 will get you some classic ROMpler type sounds, but a K4r would be a better bet (if you want that style of sound). But, I'd ditch the QSR and K1 in favor of a Proteus 2000 based synth, though. If you want to sequence with hardware and just record / mix in software, one of the E-mu Command Stations would do you well. They are a Proteus 2000 based synth with more realtime control than the racks and it has a sequencer in it.  I'm a huge fan of my Alpha Juno 2 (it's actually one of the main recommendations on this subreddit for a cheap poly analog). If you fix it, you can probably flip it for $350-ish at the top (depending on where you live). But, I'd still say keep it. The ESQ-1 is another normal suggestion here. And, if you're after late 80s / early 90s EBM / industrial sound, you might look into an ESQ-1. It's a digital analog hybrid (digital oscillators with analog filters).  You might be able to sell your MicroQ and get a used Blofeld. It's missing the drum mapping and multi outs, but has more wavetables (plus user waves) and a way better UI (much better screen). That's a toss up. You might go for a used Nord Rack 2? But, I'd say it's a decent synth already.  Alternatively, you could sell it all and buy Komplete for soft synths and start a modular for a flexible hardware setup. Or sell it all and go for Maschine and a Virus Ti Snow. Or go full Elektron (sorry, obligatory fanboy suggestion)."

The SuperNova is beast that I'm frankly a little intimidated by, but I like the A station, etc.  I wish Novation had made like a 2 rack unit synth that was somewhere between the two in terms of features...I guess there was also the KS Rack but they're so rare in the United States I may never come across one.  I like the Juno 2 but at nearly 30 years old it really is a bear to maintain - it currently has a dead backlight and will almost certainly need a power supply rebuild at some point; before I put it in storage a transistor in the output muting circuit went bad as well.

synthesizers,37nv20,conjure-official,1 point,Fri May 29 10:25:02 2015 UTC,"Dude, I LOVE that case. The ""stock"" Yocto case is why I've been reluctant to build one. How much did it cost, and it took months?"
synthesizers,37nv20,conjure-official,3,Fri May 29 02:28:47 2015 UTC,"He did them as a group buy, so the way it worked was in January or February he posted to the E-lick forums that he was doing a run of 50. They filled up quick as you can imagine, I got a spot, and sent him somewhere in the neighborhood of $200. He couldn't even begin the manufacturing process until everyone had paid, so the time between early Feb and this week was all spent having them fabricated. One shop did the metalwork and another did the screenprinting.  This was the second batch he has done, and I believe he is taking orders for a third soon- check the E-licktronic forums under Yocto hardware, and the thread is called enclosure alternatives or something like that... He posts as ensfukdjfid or something similar (on my phone don't want to look ha)  You are correct, the stock case is bad, but this thing looks and feels like OEM Roland from the early 80's. It's heavy gauge, solid, totally pro.  Total cost of the complete kit and enclosure was around $650 shipped I believe, maybe a bit less. It is to the 808 what the xoxbox is to the 303, it sounds totally identical. Only downside is that it is a massive kit and the components came all jumbled together, plus there are a few mistakes in the assembly instructions... It takes some experimentation and part replacement to get it calibrated correctly in the end. Definitely not a kit for a beginner. It took about 30 hours to assemble accounting for sorting parts and individually verifying hundreds of resistors."
synthesizers,37nv20,FourFingeredFred,2,Fri May 29 11:05:47 2015 UTC,"So minus your labor (which, at 30 hours, would probably be expensive!) it's roughly the cost of a used Miami. How do you think the sound compares?"
synthesizers,37nv20,mrlionmayne,1 point,Fri May 29 17:58:52 2015 UTC,"I have not used a Miami, but I had been considering one for a while... general consensus is that it's pretty good, but has some noticible differences. That's entirely based on my interpretation of other people's opinions though. Fwiw I think the Miami is a bit ugly, and build quality is reportedly not the greatest, and that is important to me... Interacting with a drum machine should be an enjoyable experience, and the Yocto in that case is thoroughly fun to look at and interact with. If I was going to buy an analog drum machine other than Yocto it would probably be a Tanzbar, or another DRM1 and an Electribe to sequence it... But I have always had a thing for the 808 and just sort of accepted that I was never going to be happy with a good alternative. The Yocto is a straight up 100% clone of each individual drum synthesizer from the 808, all 11 of them, so for all intents and purposes it is a real 808, just one built a few years later with an upgraded sequencer.   You are right about the labor, I've built a few xoxboxes to sell, but I would not do that with a Yocto because it would not be worth the return. It's a huge, super dense board. I enjoy working on synths so I don't really think of the time as money spent, but this one tried my patience toward the end."
synthesizers,37nv20,bingaman,1 point,Fri May 29 18:33:24 2015 UTC,I agree that case looks way better than the Miami. I guess Acidlab didn't want to tempt a trademark suit? Did you need a scope to build it?
synthesizers,37nv20,kopkaas2000,1 point,Sun May 31 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"No scope, just a multimeter and a soldering iron. There are several errors in the listed values of a few components that need to be fine tuned when it's all togetether in order to calibrate it properly, so it's not totally plug and play, but close to it. I did one section a day on average, there are 14 or so of them, a couple hours per session. Once it's together it is an 808. Period. Totally identical electronically, and totally identical sonically. If you want an 808 it's the best alternative to the real thing. All of the quirks are there, the way the noise is shared, the way the caps take time to charge up so the clap is weird occasionally, all of the little idiosyncratic stuff that the real ones do, it does, because it's the same design. TR8 is close but not as deep or organic in feel when sequenced, Yocto is absolutely dead on indistinguishable. If you are comfortable taking on a big project you should absolutely get one."
synthesizers,37nv20,mike_stifle,1 point,Sun May 31 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"Some people don't view DIY'ing this stuff as labor though. To some, it's fun and part of appreciating it. The Yocto is amazing, though I'm still not sold on the clap until I hear some better demos."
synthesizers,37nv20,mrlionmayne,1 point,Fri May 29 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rxAt3m2Zu8k  Here's one that is calibrated right. The problem is that the Yocto is based off of Roland schematics that had some information wrong, so it's not possible to tune the trimmers correctly as shipped. My clap and cowbell are this way, and I am still looking for the right combination of resistors to get it dead on. My rimshot is also quiet, and the opamp that came with the kit for the clap channel was DOA and I had to buy another one, that was fun to figure out... So basically, the reason why some demos are weird is because people finish it and say fuck it, it's close enough, and record it. There is definitely some detective work required when building the thing."

synthesizers,37q6cs,DarkWave77,3,Fri May 29 14:59:58 2015 UTC,"I have both. You can't go wrong with either one. But the MicroBrute is the more Modular friendly version. It has an LFO out, Envelope out, which the Mini does not have. The Mini does have CV ins for amp, pitch, and filter but I dont know why you would want that because the Mini is great at doing that stuff already. That is, unless you want an Amp to modulate your Pitch."
synthesizers,37q6cs,polyeurothang,3,Fri May 29 16:21:38 2015 UTC,"I've had the MiniBrute for probably half a year now and I gotta say, it's pretty dang sweet. For a synth with only one oscillator (+sub), you can get a really wide range of sounds out of it, from soft tones to gross beefy tones.  The only complaint I have about it (and it's admittedly a nitpick for something so good in it's pricerange) is that the keys are a little mushy compared to my hybrid polysynths that I have, but that's to be expected. Other than that, build quality is solid.  One of my favourite things on this thing is the ability to process other sounds, which I use to get wah and distorted tones out of my strat."
synthesizers,37q6cs,IndigoDays,1 point,Fri May 29 15:13:56 2015 UTC,How are you doing this exactly? What exactly is your chain? I can't seem to get a hot enough signal into it to use the external audio in to work.
synthesizers,37q6cs,chladnipatterns,2,Sun May 31 14:49:37 2015 UTC,I just have  the strat plugged into the audio in and then the master audio out plugged into my speakers. The key is to have the switch at the back set to either hold or audio (i forget which) otherwise you won't hear anything
synthesizers,37q6cs,IndigoDays,1 point,Sun May 31 22:09:00 2015 UTC,I did that and didn't get anything.
synthesizers,37q6cs,chladnipatterns,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:24:55 2015 UTC,do you have the audio-in slider and amp sustain sliders up? That's the only thing I can think of beyond making sure the filter is open. also make sure you raise the amp sustain before flicking the switch at the back otherwise you won't hear anything. I hope this helps!
synthesizers,37q6cs,IndigoDays,3,Mon Jun 1 16:12:31 2015 UTC,"i have the minibrute. i briefly bought the microbrute and took it back almost immediately because it really didn't add much to what the minibrute already gave me.  the minibrute is by far the more flexible synthesizer, and the microbrute really has very little over the minibrute. the only truly unique thing on the microbrute is the tunable sub-oscillator. the patch bay on the microbrute is better suited to integrating with a modular at first glance, but it doesn't really give you any more modulation options than the minibrute. the minibrute still has more, particularly in its larger variety of lfo sources.  i'm not really for sure how well the microbrute actually integrates with modular though. maybe someone can comment specifically on that. you really only get the envelope and lfo out through the patchy bay over the minibrute offers in gate and cv out, which would be overlapped and outclassed fairly quickly by even the simplest modulation modules in the eurorack world.  i added a modular about a month ago, and i still think i'd go with the minibrute if i was buying now. it's got the nicer keybed with aftertouch, and it will still be able control a modular voice. with the audio in slider, you could have some fun processing your modular. on the microbrute, the audio in is a trimpot on the back, which isn't as playable as the minibrute's nice oscillator sliders. and at only $100 more, it's really no question in my mind. you can probably still get a bit of a discount at somewhere like guitar center.  i've posted here before about comparisons between the microbrute and minibrute as well. they'll probably show up in a search."
synthesizers,37q6cs,nikofeyn,3,Sat May 30 04:55:50 2015 UTC,Minibrute owner if you plan on going into modular I would get the Microbrute. And even if you don't I would get the micro brute.
synthesizers,37q6cs,CopiousAmountsofJizz,2,Sat May 30 08:38:27 2015 UTC,i love my micro and use it all the time in a CV/gate context see my post today for what i don't love about it...
synthesizers,37q6cs,jahreed,2,Fri May 29 17:33:25 2015 UTC,"You see complaints about build quality from time to time, so exercise some caution. But I have both and they're great.  It took me a long time to get sounds I liked out of my Mini, which kind of made me realize how dependent I was on presets. I'd rarely use them as-is, but I used them a ton as starting points. So over the long term, the Mini made me much better at actually making sounds.  The Micro was a gateway drug for Eurorack, for me. My Arturias both sit on top of a 12U rack with my modular gear inside, so I think of the whole thing as a EuroBrute setup, really.  I have thought about selling my MiniBrute since getting the Micro, but not yet. Noise waveform is nice, it's basically my main MIDI controller at this point anyway, and its Gate Out comes in handy for syncing some Eurorack stuff.  A lot of people have also been very happy using the Mini's arpeggiator to trigger the Micro's sequencer, but I get pitches that are way too high when I do that. Maybe I didn't escape the build quality issues after all, maybe I'm just doing it wrong."
synthesizers,37q6cs,ranzee,2,Sat May 30 00:23:45 2015 UTC,"I have both - and putting both together is awesome :)  I find the Minibrute can achieve sounds like a VCS3, and has a real distinct filter sound. The biggest thing to note is that all the waveform controls via the sliders - if you go past about 1/2 way up they start to overdrive. So you can achieve clean or dirty sounds. You can also set some switches to half-way between their settings to achieve both (like the mod wheel cutoff or vibrato).  I love the Microbrute's sequencer - and I think it is better (easier?) to use than my Bass Station II's sequencer.  I would never sell them."
synthesizers,37q6cs,hobbbz,1 point,Sat May 30 01:03:36 2015 UTC,FYI you can use software to enable the sequencer on your mini. http://hackabrute.yusynth.net/index_en.php?&arg=3 last link in main area

synthesizers,37q6cs,chiefthomson,2,Wed Jun 3 10:40:48 2015 UTC,"I'd never give up my Minibrute! I love the combination of modular and Minibrute. Yeah the sequencer is a missing part, but the mod is down in this thread, so no worry ... I think the real sized keys and the various other buttons and functions make the minibrute much more useful. But I can only tell by vids I've seen online about the microbrute... so only my personal opinion."
synthesizers,37rxut,TheTrumpetKing,2,Fri May 29 22:15:12 2015 UTC,If you program your own patch on the MicroKorg using the formant waveforms - you might get it. But it will be some tweaking. I have the MicroKorg (not XL) - and the factory presets don't have anything like this.  I have a Korg M3 with built-in RADIAS and I'm fairly sure it has a vocoder setting that sounds like this. I just can't remember if its the RADIAS or the M3 as they both have vocoder engines ;)  On a side-note: I think the Roland VT-3 (AIRA) might also be able to do this.
synthesizers,37rxut,ranzee,1 point,Sat May 30 01:09:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! I think I'm gonna have to buy the XL then :)
synthesizers,37rxut,jepyang,2,Sun May 31 17:16:19 2015 UTC,Sounds more like autotune than vocoder to me. I would be pleasantly surprised if anyone managed to coax a sound like this from the MicroKorg.
synthesizers,37rxut,selfinflikted,1 point,Sat May 30 14:22:02 2015 UTC,"It definitely is a vocoder, as can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXHP9-a1AjQ But yeah, it doesn't sound like the typical robotic sounds we associate with vocoders, which is why I dig it so much. They use it on couple other songs too."
synthesizers,37rxut,confirmationbias40,1 point,Sun May 31 17:15:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a vocoder, either. If it is, it's very subtle in the mix, layered underneath an auto-tuned vox track."

It sounds great, is way deeper than the korg, and doubles as a sound card and fx processor for other gear to boot. The Korg is super fun to tweak though and is no slouch in the sound department but having owned both id go for the Novation in a second. More polyphony, way better keyboard (aftertouch!) and much more portable."
synthesizers,37ngd7,natrixgli,1 point,Fri May 29 03:40:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting to hear an opinion from someone who has owned both.

synthesizers,37ngd7,24Track,2,Fri May 29 09:20:49 2015 UTC,Ultranova user here - The interface indeed is very straight forward over you got used to it. Not as good as full knob per function but it's still pretty good
synthesizers,37ngd7,natrixgli,2,Fri May 29 12:17:11 2015 UTC,"The UI of the Ultranova is very well thought out, I was surprised by how easy it is to use. You select sections with a button, then all the relevant parameters are laid out on the screen. Some sections have very in depth parameter editing, or multiple things (i.e. oscillators) which are broken up into pages. But it's very quick and easy to navigate.   The Novation bests the MS2K with 3 fully featured oscillators which have classic VA waveforms plus some unusual variations on them and wavetables. Each oscillator has it's own unison setting with detune which can produce huge sounds. Plus the LFOs have tons of really cool waveforms (like staircase, scales, etc.) that have some really fun potential. There are a bunch of filter types, and up to 5 simultaneous FX with several different routing configurations. And it has chord memory which is pretty rare on VA synths, and lots of fun to use.  For the low price they go for, they're a friggin' steal.   EDIT: Dammit, now I want one."

synthesizers,37ngd7,crowby,1 point,Fri May 29 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"I think the counterarguments for the Korg would be fairly invalid in your case, they'd be primarily the more hands-on UI and the mod sequencer. Those are IMHO the killer features of the Korg and probably not hugely applicable having heard your reference tracks. Plus I never really used the sequencer when I had my MS2000 because I would have needed to feed our drummer with a click track in order to keep him (and the rest of the band) in time with the MIDI clock for it to sound good. We tried to do a cover of The Faint's ""Call Call"" using the sequencer on the Korg and it was a disaster without a click.  I think you'd benefit much more from the more flexible oscillators and added polyphony. The 2nd track has a nice digital sound with a long release time played via an arpeggiator which would result in voice stealing on the Korg. As for the UI, on the Ultranova you have a ""Tweak"" page that you can customize with 8 frequently used parameters for easy access during live performances."
synthesizers,37ngd7,t0xicd0g,1 point,Fri May 29 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"I've owned an Ms2000 and currently own the Ultranova. The Ultranova is a favorite of mine and I've commented several times on here about it. It will run circles around the Ms2000 in terms of sound and synth capability. The only thing it's really lacking is true FM.   I'll mention a few things and comparisons:  The filter volume on the Ms is attenuated as you increase resonance. This can be a good or bad thing. It makes the filter sound weak, but also helps it sit in a mix easier if you're modulating and tweaking at high res values.   This is a small complaint, but I hated menu diving on the MS. The menus were pages and pages long, and that screen was so tiny. The ultranova menus in comparison are well thought out and easy to use.  The Ms2000 has a limited mod matrix. I think it's called virtual patch. The Novation has 20 slots, plus some really cool lfo shapes and features.  My biggest complaint is the mod sequencer. It was the main thing that attracted me to the Ms2000 in the first place and also the biggest disappointment in owning the synth. There is a slight timing issue with the sequencer and arpeggiator. For some patches, you might use the arp in tandem with the sequencer and they would drift apart. Even using it's own internal clock. Imagine the nightmare of syncing with other gear. The most current update came close to fixing the issue, but it's still not quite right. There are some work arounds that help, but ultimately that problem soured my experience with the synth and is the main reason I sold it.  However, all the being said, the ms2000 is really great sounding synth and is very flexible. I miss that distortion button every time I think about the Ms2000. Nowadays, I have a rule to keep my synth collection down to about 4 synths, but I might pick one up again some day."
synthesizers,37ngd7,FieldsofBlue,3,Fri May 29 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"Korg has the better interface for creating sounds and tweaking live, but the Ultranova has the edge in polyphony, complexity and size. However, there are plenty of other synths between these two that might also fit the bill perfectly; Nord Lead 2 - sounds amazing, but has no effects built in; Novation KS4/5 - a less sophisticated version of the Ultranova sound, but with a wealth of knobs and sliders for programming fun; Roland System 1- still only 4 note polyphonic but it is much smaller than the Korg and also has the ability to transform into one of several classic Roland monophonic synths at the press of a button , which will add to your live versatility without adding to the amount of gear you need to carry to a gig; Roland SH201 - gets trash talked by some people for looking a bit Fisher Price but it's actually a damned good synth engine."

synthesizers,37mj74,output_enable,3,Thu May 28 19:07:27 2015 UTC,There's no easy way to do this. The MS-20 filters are in series: HPF output goes into LPF input. You would be adding an HPF in series AFTER the LPF.   You'll have to experiment with wave shaping before the LPF.
synthesizers,37mj74,ouij,5,Thu May 28 19:17:01 2015 UTC,"The ordering of two filters in an linear time invariant system doesn't actually mater. If the filter is overdriven than we lose the linear part, but I'd assume the MS-20 filters aren't purposefully overdriven like the Moog's so we don't really have a baseline ordering in the overdriven case anyway.  The tricky bit is adding envelopes and modulation to the external filter so that it sounds like part of the sound, and not just a static high pass added for mix purposes."
synthesizers,37mj74,lgauthie,1 point,Thu May 28 20:02:36 2015 UTC,"The ordering of two filters in an linear time invariant system doesn't actually mater   now that is actually interesting. Why do high pass filters usually come before low pass filters in non-modular synths that have both?  Also, I tend to use the MS-20's resonant high pass filter as a supplemental oscillator for bass lines: at high resonance, it adds a big boost right about where the HPF cutoff frequency is set. The LPF shaves off higher harmonics, and I end up with a lot of bass. Would this be the same if I reversed the order? I should try this on the modular."
synthesizers,37mj74,ouij,3,Thu May 28 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"The high pass filter will remove energy from the system, so if they low pass filter is being overdriven then that reduction of energy may change how much the lowpass distorts. So it is possible the order is chosen for that reason. It could also have been chosen arbitrarily or for some obscure engineering reason.  Mathematically speaking (sort of) using a LPF to shave off higher harmonics followed by the HPF with a resonant boost is exactly the same as the reverse you describe.  edit  All you are doing is amplifying or turning down certain frequencies with a filter. It doesn't matter if you boost 200hz by 20dB and then cut it by 10dB or cut by 10dB and then boost by 20dB, that frequency is going to be 10dB louder in both cases."
synthesizers,37mj74,lgauthie,1 point,Thu May 28 21:06:10 2015 UTC,if they low pass filter is being overdriven then that reduction of energy may change how much the lowpass distorts.    This makes a lot of sense. The MS-20 is a marvelous beast when you patch in some feedback.

FWIW I only recently learned that this is not the case for the Juno-106:   A lot of Juno players don't realize that there is not a highpass filter per voice; Roland cleverly placed the HPF switch on the panel to suggest that the HPF precedes the VCF, but it isn't so. There is only one HPF circuit for the whole synth, and it works on the summed mono output of the voice circuits."
synthesizers,37mj74,Magnusson,1 point,Fri May 29 12:23:34 2015 UTC,"I've always thought it was just the easier way to think about it. If you plot a spectrum, the high-pass filters out the left side and the low-pass filters out the right side, your sound is to the right of the high-cut and to the left of the low-cut. Putting the high-pass left and the low-pass right just makes intuitive sense. Considering that the signal path usually goes from left to right, that means the high-pass comes first in the signal path."

Also notice that WAV files can always be loaded into (or exported from) a project. So you could just keep a library of WAV samples you want to keep common among projects on the SD card."

When i got my first adlib machine I was looking to get a new piece of gear under $100 to mess with.... but eventually I got totally hooked by the sequencer itself and the elegance of programming/manipulating synthesis based voices in a tracker.   Making FM voices with AT2 is pretty satisfying since the results are somewhat idiosyncratic, being hardware based.

But I have and continue to use Operator a lot for my non-adlib stuff.  I think all FM synths are backwards compatible but what's different is how fine the control is.  IE, Operator can set EG values to Milliseconds, wheras OPL3 only has a choice of 16 different values.  There's probably some differences in how the sounds are ""calculated"" and spit out by the DAC.  IE, a DX7 has some weirdo 15 bit DAC so even if you completely copy the patch in FM8 or something like that it won't be the same exactly."
synthesizers,37hx4j,joshontheweb,2,Thu May 28 03:00:20 2015 UTC,"a DX7 has some weirdo 15 bit DAC so even if you completely copy the patch in FM8 or something like that it won't be the same exactly.   The DX-7 uses a 12-bit DAC, the BA9221. It was fairly commonly used at the time, and there's a couple good reasons why they opted for it.  Internally, the DX-7 runs on an 8-bit microprocessor (due to cost: 16-bit processors were more expensive). Calculating an FM waveform (technically phase modulation, as implemented by Yamaha) by the traditional formula involves a lot of multiplication operations and sine wave calculations. Multiplies are more expensive than addition operations, and approximating a sine wave even more so.  The very clever engineers at Yamaha realized that if you stored the sine wave values in a lookup table, and logarithmically encoded them, you could eliminate all the sine wave calculations, and turn all the multiply operations into additions. This had two effects: they could increase the polyphony of the instrument; they could also get an effective 12 bits of output resolution using 8-bit calculations. There are some noise artifacts to this.  John Chowning estimated the DX-7's internal CPU sample rate to be in excess of 35kHz in an appendix in the Chowning/Bristow ""FM Theory and Applications"" book, and has said the DAC has a 57kHz sample rate in interviews. This does not really hold up if you plug your headphones into a DX-7. The DAC itself is noisy, and there is no anti-aliasing in the DX-7 FM/PM calculations. I read the DAC has an effective 22.5kHz frequency limit many times, but have nothing to back that up, other than the fact that a 45kHz sample rate is close to Chowning's 57kHz.  When I bought my 7, I also had the option to buy a DX7s (same engine, fully 16-bit, stereo output) or a V-series with a more elaborate 4-op FM engine. I chose the 7 because I wanted that particular sound.  [Lengthy DX-7 geekery ends.]"

synthesizers,37hx4j,wimpnotwimp,3,Thu May 28 09:40:02 2015 UTC,Have you ever happened to use a Midibox FM synth? I'd be curious to know how you like that interface for sound design compared to the adlib tracker.
synthesizers,37hx4j,mdrsharp,2,Wed May 27 22:00:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's easier to use AT2 since I dont have to use CC lanes to change parameters, just effects commands.  Also, since you only have 16 values for an envelope generator segment making a break point line is kind of overkill when there's probably only a range of a few values you want to go between.  MIDIbox is also kind of expensive compared to any old computer. The fact that the hardware+software are in the same package is neat to me as well and it kind of makes sense to sequence the OPL3 in this way.  Being able to move around .A2M files is also pretty useful because the person who you send it to can check out your project file in the same way you made it.  If i sequenced a module in Ableton i could send my friend the project file but he would have to have ableton as well and the editor VST etc etc.  I use facebook messenger to send myself or friends modules and the only thing you need to play it back is AT2 which is a 1.5 meg download. For the money, you could get a TX81z which is probably a more useful 4OP FM module but that is just my thinking."

I didn't do a whole lot of programming on it when I first got it, but what I did do impressed upon me the depth of the synthesis. And, now the power supply seems to be dead. I wish it wasn't, because it would have been the perfect synth for specific application I had. The Proteus 2000 series is basically a slightly refined Audity 2000 engine. It's really robust and has a ton of modulation ability, even when stacked up against non-ROMplers.  My jazzhead buddy picked up a MP-7 (the Command Stations were Proteus 2000 based with a sequencer and more realtime controls) earlier this year. He's been really busy with his gigging schedule recently, otherwise I'd have a better experience to tell you about. But, if you do like the Proteus 2000 and want a sequencer built around it, at some point a Command Station might not be a bad investment. Plus, they all have interchangeable sound ROMs (they look like computer RAM sticks).  /u/rodentdp just picked up a Proteus 2000, he might have some words for you."

I had a weird problem with my XtremeLead-1 (I think they're the same main board) and I think it's the capacitor (there's only one) on the main board.

synthesizers,37hjw4,rodentdp,4,Wed May 27 19:44:45 2015 UTC,"I bought it from a certain big box store that is fairly guitar centric. I'm going to go to a local store and raise a stink after work, because I'm sure they will try to short me on the shipping, but I'm not paying when they didn't do their job of inspecting the unit when they bought it.   It is infuriating, because I actually called the store it came from to inquire about the condition of another Proteus 2000 they had in stock, and the employee came back and told me that they had just received in another one in ""better condition, for $10 less"" than the other one. What I received had a broken rack ear, no power cable, and would either freeze on startup or started making some awful bitcrushed noise when it would finally boot and make a sound...and then stopped recognizing the ROM entirely. Factory reset didn't help either, opened it up, reset the sound ROM (as well as trying it in a different slot), and it worked...but then the same shit.  So, I've ""liberated"" the Composer ROM and will return it as defective (which it is), and will probably be buying another module in the series today as well. Maybe I should feel bad about snagging the ROM, but I already know that this place will only throw away the unit after I return it, so why let it go to waste?"

They probably have zero idea there was an extra ROM in it, so I wouldn't sweat it. It feels kinda wrong, but the rationalization you gave plus the fact that they lied about the condition. If they won't refund on the shipping cost, consider that payment for the chip."

My guess is the accents are the chords actually being played as 8th notes, and what follows is the release (or decay) of the amp. Add a square LFO to the filter cutoff, so when the chord is played it's bright, then less bright, then bright again.   Could potentially be a delay, too. Every 8th note is played, and a quieter delay signal plays back the 16th notes.  I'm sure somebody else with more sound-sculpting experience will have a better answer."
synthesizers,37guzo,jepyang,2,Wed May 27 16:25:18 2015 UTC,I was thinking about it being a decay / LFO / and hitting things because it's an accent on the one and then some off beats too... I'll try that. Good idea. Thanks.
synthesizers,37guzo,jepyang,2,Wed May 27 16:43:05 2015 UTC,"If it were me, I would brute force it by actually sequencing each 16th note hit of the chord, individually, using velocity to control the accents, but that's just how I roll.

Korg knew what a piece of shit smelled like.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-EAczyZ-Ak&feature=youtu.be  Check it - the new esx is actually a step down.  From the KORG forums:    … oh my goooddd…the sound is terrible, it sort of overlapses but not only the kicks between the 4/4 sound extremely bad but also the first kicks are f**ked! There is not way to solve this problem, not with filter not with Amp EG, not even if you change the Voice. Terrible terrible terrible.  MIDI 1/4 sync jacks instead of classic midi…WORST THING EVER. The adaptors that I found in the box that came with the electribe do not work, I tried and tried and tried…and asked myself what the hell am I doing wrong that the midi doesn’t work?? Or, at least, I HOPE the problem is the adaptors, there is no way I can check this because I can’t order these adaptors from anywhere. I can’t send midi notes from ableton, I can’t use a keyboard to play the notes.   Instead, for syncing I use the jack Sync inputs and I run the midi through the volcas.  So, ESX-1 is the master ..midi out to one of my Volcas..then from the volcas sync-out to the electribe through jack cable. And it’s so bad because it doesn’t pick up when you press PLAY on the master…you have to manually press play on the E2. I hate it so bad…  And lastly, why would they take out where you can see what the initial setting/level was at your last save??? If by mistake I change a knob value…I can never know what it was before…no indication for that. Terrible!!  These from above are the 3 main problems for me. The rest, I can deal with.  Only one effect/part..very bad but not catastrophic. Only one edit knob for FX…bad…bad. No reverb on the part FX..(only on master FX)…very bad… No reverse, No roll. Filter knob is infinite, kind of bad. The rest, I won’t even mention.   I don’t know what to do, to send it back or not. I only have a few days left out of the 60 days trial. I won’t explain why but it would be very complicated for me to send it back because it was bought by a dear friend of mine outside of the country that I reside. I had to pay shipping + insurance, now if I send it back I have to pay shipping + insurance again.  After being a major Korg fan for all these years, I am truly, truly disappointed in the E2. It cost me so much to have this machine and I can’t use it properly. The clipping is so bad……..so bad….    When a product is buggy due bad testing and bad software and/or hardware a company has choice to ship it or not. Korg choose to ship. I find it funny that people defend Korgs decision to release too early. It's plain to see they didn't test it properly.  The argument I hear is that it's normal nowadays. It's not normal, it becomes normal when customers swallow the BS and stick with an unfinished product. You're too nice.  What do you think Korg would've done if everybody returned their unit cuz of the clicking, anti-aliasing, bad software design or something else? They would've gotten a clear signal. The signal they get now is that they can simply release another unfinished product.     Good luck with your returns!    And again, MHH downvotes the truth. Toys are a predictable bunch.

The MIDI jack cables work fine, though I have seen some other people with issues - they got free replacements that worked. if you want more effects, buy an effects box. Filter knob being infinite is not an issue.   I don't recall ever seeing this thing being more than $400.   I think it's hilarious when people call the gear they don't like toys.

synthesizers,37fldd,cakemedia,1 point,Wed May 27 15:11:02 2015 UTC,"Voder:       The Bell Telephone Laboratory's Voder (from Voice Operating Demonstrator) was the first attempt to electronically synthesize human speech by breaking it down into its acoustic components. It was invented by Homer Dudley in 1937–1938 and developed on his earlier work on the vocoder. The quality of the speech was limited; however, it demonstrated the synthesis of the human voice, which became one component of the vocoder used in voice communications for security and to save bandwidth.   The Voder synthesized human speech by imitating the effects of the human vocal tract. The operator could select one of two basic sounds by using a wrist bar. A buzz tone generated by a relaxation oscillator produced the voiced vowels and nasal sounds, with the pitch controlled by a foot pedal. A hissing noise produced by a gas discharge tube created the sibilants (voiceless fricative sounds). These initial sounds were passed through a bank of 10 band pass filters that were selected by keys; their outputs were combined, amplified and fed to a loudspeaker. The filters were controlled by a set of keys and a foot pedal to convert the hisses and tones into vowels, consonants, and inflections. Additional special keys were provided to make the plosive sounds such as ""p"" or ""d"", and the affrictive sounds of the ""j"" in ""jaw"" and the ""ch"" in ""cheese"". This was a complex machine to operate. After months of practice, a trained operator could produce recognizable speech.   Performances on the Voder were featured at the 1939 New York World's Fair and in San Francisco. Twenty operators were trained, with Mrs. Helen Harper particularly noted for her skill with the machine.

synthesizers,37haic,Tubefruit,3,Wed May 27 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"If I'm reading this correctly, it sounds like you want a MIDI-thru box. Something like this. That way you could send MIDI from and to multiple channels at once from either the E2 or 505.  With the Electribe, you can't change the MIDI channels for each part, so you'd need to make sure you have the MIDI channels on the synths set up to match whatever part you want. So you could have MS-20 on channel 1 (part 1 on the Electribe), ESQ-1 on channel 2 (part 2 on E2) and so on.   I built this MIDI-thru hub from a kit and have used it with the Electribe to control outboard synths. I could make a video if need be, to demonstrate this."
synthesizers,37haic,TheGreatWildFrontier,1 point,Wed May 27 17:50:53 2015 UTC,"While you don't need a MPC, it might streamline your workflow a bit.  I use my MPC 1k to sequence 8 synths.  It can send program/bank change info, which means when you load a song, all your synths will jump to the right patches.  It also will record midi CC do you can automate knob movements.  On top of its sequencing ability, it's a great sampler.  It can't do all the crazy sample mangling stuff like some boxes, but it chops really easy, and setting up the programs is intuitive."

synthesizers,37haic,ouqt,1 point,Thu May 28 03:46:14 2015 UTC,"Cool answer. I have an MPC500 and use it similarly, but never used it to change patches on everything at once - great idea, thanks! Out of interest, do you look up the MIDI info for this for each synth, or try recording a patch change for each one and editing that?"
synthesizers,37haic,fnordtastic,2,Fri May 29 08:24:05 2015 UTC,"I've never used a 500, so I'll explain how I do it on my 1000.  Set each of your synths to receive midi on different channels.  Synth 1 on midi channel 1, synth 2 on channel 2, and so on.  There should be a spot on the main screen for changing midi channels.  You should be able to choose A1 - A16 or B1 - B16.  This is how you select which synth to program, and you choose these channels per each track.  Down where you select your programs, there should be an option that also lets you choose program numbers.  It should look like P01-P128.  If all your midi is hooked up correctly, you should be able to change this number and see the patches change on your selected synth.  To select banks, highlight your patch number and press the window button. (the window button should light up anytime there's extra options for a parameter). Turn on bank change messages, then use the LSB number ( in most cases) to select which bank you want.  If everything is set correctly, you should be able to change the patches physically on your synths, then hit play on the MPC, and have all the patches jump back to the correct numbers.  I like to get all my tracks set and named on the first sequence, make my pattern, then copy the sequence to a new sequence.  Then I'll erase the notes and make a new pattern.  This keeps all the track names and midi info consistent across all the sequences and you won't have to set them or name them again.  When saving, I always save to a fresh folder named just for that song.  I save ""all programs and sample"" then save ""all songs and sequences"".  If everything is hooked up and set right, you should be able to load the whole folder and have your song ready to go. Pressing play should make all your synths jump to the correct patches.  To record midi cc, just hook your synths midi out back into the MPC midi in, overdub the track while turning a knob, and you should hear the result upon playback.  Be aware there are several different types of ways to erase data in your tracks, so of you flub your knob turn or want to redo it later, you can erase only notes, or everything but notes, or even specific notes."
synthesizers,37haic,ouqt,2,Fri May 29 13:36:28 2015 UTC,"Carumba, that's a very useful reply, thanks very much indeed. I had everything apart from the program changes down, but that way of working sounds perfect. I usually create everything from scratch, so have never needed to change patch, but I am thinking of testing out saving patches for once! This will really help, thanks again. Indeed, not sure the MPC500 will necessarily have this functionality, but it might convince me to upgrade anyway!"
synthesizers,37haic,fnordtastic,1 point,Fri May 29 15:02:06 2015 UTC,"I like working this way because I'll go on a spree making beats for a month, then play beats for people to see which ones they want, then multitrack into my daw once they've decided on the beat.  It saves me the time of recording all the beats then not using them.  Also having the entire song available on the MPC let's me tweak songs or change sounds after the fact.  And yeah, def save your patches.  Don't want to lose that sweet bass sound you dialed up.  Another trick I learned was how to use one keyboard to control all the other synths in the setup.  Super handy if you use a lot of chords in your songs or don't like playing notes on the pads.  The only caveat is that you need a keyboard that lets you turn off local control, which separates the keyboard from the internal sound module.  The MPC has a setting to only play midi on the selected track.  So you choose a track and midi channel, and then your keyboard only plays that one synth, without making any sound itself.  Beyond the larger screen, the 1000 has the ability to install an internal hard drive.  I put a 120gb in mine.  I will literally never run out of space.  This lets me sample in bulk, then resave those same samples into my song folder without ever worrying about space or forgetting which disc has the sound I'm looking for.

synthesizers,37haic,ouqt,1 point,Fri May 29 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"Super, it's really nice to read. I've got the local control off thing sorted and have all the synths in different tracks of the MPC, just never delved any further than that. Control changes just scared me because I've got them in a big MIDI daisychain and I freaked out that I would mess something up. The nice thing about the MPC is that I have duplicate tracks/pads for each synth so I can have multiple loops recorded for each one to progress things. I've always worked in a ""make something from scratch, destroy it at the end"" way, which has its own merits, but this will be excellent help for me. Thanks again."
synthesizers,37haic,mcmonky,1 point,Fri May 29 19:40:44 2015 UTC,"MIDI works best when it's centrally controlled IMHO.  After years of dicking around, my current setup has a MOTU 8x8 MIDI router (used to have 2 - they can be ganged/expanded) connected to a Mac running DAW software, in my case Ableton Live.  One main keyboard (Kurzweil 2600) goes into the router as a main controller.  All the outputs of the synths go into mixer like yours (mine 56 channel Mackie) with one return bus returning all the synths back to a stereo in of an audio interface (sound devices USB Pre 2). Live is a wonderful tool to use to create, manipulate and send Midi to the devices.  You want the hardware for the sound.  Hardware MIDI is a pain and this is the best setup I've found that maximizes music and minimizes dicking around with MIDI.  Only other tip I have is to get a meter that tells you exactly what is happening signal-wise on a MIDI cable.  I use a very vintage Studiomaster MA36 box that has saved me countless hours knowing why a box isn't making sounds or responding to clock, etc."

For the money, it seems to provide a great value... but I already have an MK, and I'm using the KP3 as my looper, and I have a TR-8 on the way and I am eventually going to get an octatrack to server as my main sequencer...   but if I was dead set on having a toy to play with until I could collect what I want, the jdxi is a great choice...   as for the system 1...

It's one of the best analogue emulations I've ever heard and I am really fighting the urge to splash cash on one myself, but if you want a) a compositional tool you can take anywhere, or b) don't already have a studio with a drum machine and sequencer, then I'd have to suggest the JD."

(An exception is the Juno-106). For me finally having polyphonic portamento in one of my synths is a dream come true.  Not necessarily unique, but a few interesting facts about it:  While portamento created in an analogue way (simple low pass in the cv-path) never quite reaches the target pitch, the portamento of the Juno-66 does for it is linear not exponential. You can also select either constant time or constant speed behaviour, a feature which is imho not found often."

Would you ever consider taking on a project where you weren't so much adding MIDI or new features, but rather adding CC or sysex support to the parameters already included in the synth so that those parameters could be controlled in realtime with a software or hardware controller?

synthesizers,37cs7r,Lurkmcgirk,1 point,Tue May 26 19:31:33 2015 UTC,Of course the lack of midi is not a requirement to make a synth ugrade.

synthesizers,37cs7r,Lurkmcgirk,3,Tue May 26 19:42:03 2015 UTC,I agree. Resonance modulation is something usually missing but can give you very nice results.  Not really a parameter but synths often lack a fast LFO to make filter modulation sounds possible. A range switch for the LFO is something I often add to a synth (202 for example). I am also a big fan of hardsync but here of course you need a second oscillator..

In some ways the original is better, because there are more dedicated controls, and the added complexity of the GT upper/lower parts makes the gui less usable and gets in the way sometimes.   Soundwise, the resynthesis is a lot of fun, though it does have a distinctive sound to it that I could never quite get away from, and feels a bit uncontrollable at times. I.e, you tend to make sounds by experimentation and seeing what happens rather than thinking of a sound and then programming it.   I tended to end up doing more with just the VA engine, which is very powerful, and can even be convinced to do physical modelling type sounds with the comb filters.  Very deep synth though, and you can generally persuade it to do what you want. I even made a proper 70 note multisampled piano patch once, using the automatic split to chromatic key mapping to get a separate sample for each key."

Everything on the touch screen is exactly where you think it would be, and it has a ton of hands on control."

I definitely was interested in it on paper as a digital sample mangling machine. Actually, I've been after something like this since the VP-9000 was released.  Although I didn't import or record any of my own samples, I was pretty disappointed in it. The interface is not all that intuitive- the combination of soft knobs and the display require more parsing than I would have wanted. I know we all like hardware to get away from computers but when the hardware has a 5 inch square color screen and menu systems etc it's just like working on a computer, a really shitty one. Some synths just invite exploration and tweaking, the Roland gave me a headache like immediately. I'm not into stuff like the ""Time Trip Pad"" or D-Beam.   As a rompler, it's not my thing. There were no sounds I would really be into using. I think most of the cheesy Katsunori type demos of this thing floating around are actually very representative of what it sounds like. Most of those sounds are of the neo-Wavestation/D50 ilk, pretty new agey or dated electronica or law and order soundtrack music. The VA section is not good, think JP-8000 with even less balls.   So yeah, not for me. I'd be more interested in getting a VP-9000 now that they are really cheap, which is the sample engine more or less of the V-Synth."
synthesizers,37e6v8,ascw,1 point,Wed May 27 00:50:39 2015 UTC,"I think the preset patches in the GT are pretty awful. They tend to be more 'hold one key for an impressive swoosh' type of thing, with massive release times+delays and reverbs that make them unusable for musical use.  The original V OS 1 had a great set of presets, including some emulations of acoustic instruments and synth sounds that were really nice. As far as I know, there was a licensing issue with some of the samples, and a hidden feature that allowed multi-samples for ROM samples was removed in the V2 OS, so they created a new preset bank.  There is a conversion of the V1 presets to V2 floating around the net, but some patches don't work properly because of the missing ROM multi-sample capability and other issues.  The V really came alive to me when I started moving away from electronic sounds, and doing more the kind of sounds where you can't quite tell if it's electronic or acoustic. I created some acoustic piano and autoharp multi-samples that can morph from naturalistic to quite eerie, and to me that kind of thing is more what's unique about the V."

I mean sure, there are better workstations, and there are better sounding devices out there. At the time, though, it was revolutionary, hence it became a staple of its time.   Of course, much like most digital synths (especially workstations and the DX series), no one really took the time to learn the instrument and see what it can really do, so most examples of it are the shitty presets. It is actually fairly powerful once you actually use it instead of just play it.   That said, if you're looking for a good modern workstation, don't get an M1.

And they have it in the same way guitarists have it, always chasing the tone dragon, even at their own expense. But dream theatre is progs lowest common denominator, a confluence of guitar center culture & non offensive commercial hard rock thats dressed up to look like the go getters of the 70's 80's & 90's, but without the depth or rebellion of it's most obvious influences, neatly packaged to appeal to engineer & middle management types, but not offensive enough to chase off their significant others. To put it in perspective, you know that rock band that does all the overblown christmas shows every year for the middle America soccer mom set? Well, ostensibly, dream theatre is the same thing without the christmas, which is prog for people who don't actually like prog or haven't really heard anything better, but at the same time I wouldn't really consider them a gateway drug like Floyd or Tool either, but more of a dimly lit dead end street like where Journey & Joe Satriani go to suck each other off while companies like korg & arturia pay to let kids watch em do it."

I bought my first synth in 1976 (which cost the same as a new car in today's dollars) and have owned and played lots of analogue and digital synths.  These days, I just like what sounds good and expressive.  To my ears, the Kronos sounds just great. I am very happy with mine. Its ability to create layers of instruments and the high quality of the audio generated is probably its best feature. Programming is not difficult on them and the knobs on the control surface are linked to the active elements in the synth so that at performance time you just select a patch and your knobs do what you expect them to do for the type of synth you are using.    TLDR: Anything you can do on a JD-XA you can do on a Kronos. The reverse is not true."

I like map out 2 octaves of a scale on the 16 pads and transpose octaves using the arrow buttons below. The position and pressure sensors on each pad are great for pitch/filter tracking and other continuous stuff. The KMI QuNexus works better if you want a chromatic keyboard, but if you map out the scale you need for a given song on the pads, the QuNeo gets the job done. You can even use the sliders, rotary controls, and other buttons to trigger notes as well.  For triggering clips, you can set each corner of each pad to be its own trigger, so 16 pads can really become 64.  I have found moving through presets pretty quick. All you do is hold the circular button on the top left and hit a pad (it can store up to 16).  I would skim the manual for all of the features, but those are the ones I use most.  Hope that helps!"

That said, you can program it to do whatever you want. Half clip launcher, half chromatic keyboard? No big deal. Every pad with a completely different function? Totally cool too. If you're willing to put the time in to program it, it's absolutely the most powerful pad controller out there.  Still, for what you're doing, I would be tempted to stick with a Launchpad."

Not expensive either for this caliber of machine. Only real downside to me is that it's not analog like the 808 and 909 and similar products from jomox and mfb.  Unless you're talking about strictly a sequencer, in which case I recommend the elektron octatrack. Extremely powerful sequencer with loads of features.

synthesizers,37b3bt,t0xicd0g,3,Tue May 26 18:30:54 2015 UTC,"What they did is the same as for the 707 expansion; any sound that used PCM samples in the originals has exactly the same PCM data, but it's then passed through an emulation of all the circuitry the original machine had, including the DAC, which colours the sound from just a raw sample. So yes, the sounds that were samples in the original are still samples now and are the identical samples from the original machines. They haven't sampled from a 909 so much as extracted the actual 1s and 0s that comprise the sample from the chips of an original. The sound you get out of it is pretty much spot on what you'd get from a pristine and perfect condition 909 (most aren't and have aged, hence some of the differences people shout about in some of the A/B comparisons, but the truth is that none of those 909s are even close to being pristine and un-aged)."

synthesizers,37bo5k,bfkill,4,Tue May 26 13:09:00 2015 UTC,"The iConnectMidi4+ does exactly this. You can hook up an 8-port powered USB to its host port and it can output to the Midi DIN ports. You have to set it up using an iOS device or a computer, but, it can run in stand alone mode."
synthesizers,37bo5k,the_cody,1 point,Tue May 26 13:19:30 2015 UTC,"You can use the raspberry pi or any linux computer really to plug the usb controller into, but you would still need to get a usb-to-midi cable (which are rather inexpensive). No ableton required. The problem is that you will need to have some linux know how to get the configuration setup. But, it's not hard and no soldering. Getting audio workingly cleanly is a different matter. But, it would be $50 (for pi and usb-to-midi cable) instead of the more expensive iConnectMidi4+ which is $300.  Another option is the Chip: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598272670/chip-the-worlds-first-9-computer. But, it's not out yet for another year, but looks like it will be good to go out of the box.  I have been going the raspberry pi route recently, but looks for other alternatives. It would be great it there was a simple iconnectMidi4+ that was around the $50 price point."
synthesizers,37bo5k,btbuxton,4,Tue May 26 13:27:39 2015 UTC,"The iConnectMidi4+'s street price is actually $200, not $300. The iConnectAudio4+ is $300, and is missing the extra DIN ports in favor of audio ports.  In my opinion: unless you just absolutely want the DIY approach, or, you have specific needs that the iConnectMidi4+ just cannot do, the time investment in making the Raspberry Pi do what you want just seems, to me, better spent on the iConnectMidi4+. Not that there is anything wrong with the Raspberry Pi approach. And, as OP asked about soldering something up, he seems to be ok with the DIY aspect. I'm just advocating for a product that's not much more expensive and does exactly what OP asked with minimal setup.  There is also the upcoming Bome Box, which is Bome's midi translator in hardware, with a bunch of other hardware ports."
synthesizers,37bo5k,the_cody,1 point,Tue May 26 14:35:37 2015 UTC,"But can this rasp pi solution work like 'set and forget'?  I mean, can I configure the thing that knob x on the usb controller performs change y via midi once and then everytime I power on it's ready to go (no clicks, no needing a keyboard or a monitor or whatever)?"
synthesizers,37bo5k,moravec-transfer,5,Tue May 26 13:37:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, only implement this raspberry pi solution if you actually enjoy fucking about with Linux. It can be fun and rewarding, but it will absorb a lot of your time to get right; your time is worth something, and perhaps just buying a device designed to accomplish your goals will be more worthwhile in terms of time savings."
synthesizers,37bo5k,allegroagitato,1 point,Tue May 26 15:56:15 2015 UTC,you can run a raspberry pi headless (no keyboard mouse and monitor) easiest way to do it is use one of the images from ccrma satelite (has most linux sound software preinstalled) and just google how to run it headless and make a small script that will start up a particular program/config on start-up. You would then need a compatible midi interface to pipe the usb controllers midi out of the raspberry pi. But before it might be wise to see if linux will support your usb controller (probably will see it as a generic midi controller) then you can just use the menu's on the usb controller to configure what midi messages it's sending or use some piece of software that's able to remap the controls. BTw ableton will of course not work on a ARM device like the pi since ableton live only supports intel/amd processors on windows or mac os. There is no linux nor ARM support.
synthesizers,37bo5k,btbuxton,1 point,Tue May 26 13:53:41 2015 UTC,"You should be able to in theory. It's just a matter of configuration. But, I have found the raspberry pi to be temperamental if you don't shut it down properly (sd card corruption can happen). I have started to play with around with some of the other cheap computers (beaglebone) to see if they fare better. The beaglebone has been more stable.  For audio (to take care of clicks, etc), I use a cheap usb sound card that so far does fine with playback of wav files, but I haven't gotten the synthesizers to sound good yet. I'm just beginning to play around with all of this so some of it is me figuring it out.  I will say that Linux audio is a mess."

The VP-770 isn't really any better either. If roland really wanted to bring back a badass analog with no modern competition, they should just bring back it's forefather the VP-330."
synthesizers,378uiy,ouij,1 point,Tue May 26 02:54:18 2015 UTC,"a badass analog with no modern competition,    As if the fact that so few people use vocoders weren't enough, now you want them to produce an unbelievably expensive analog vocoder that still fewer people could use!"
synthesizers,378uiy,remedial_dnd,1 point,Tue May 26 15:14:49 2015 UTC,"Fewer people would use? Every week someone's on here going on & on about the The Cure string synth or the Joy Division pad sound. It's a big enough thing the Streichfett exists, so there's obviously some kind of need for it. Even just as a string/choir synth the VP stands up to or even beats the best out there & I say that as someone who just has no use for anything from Roland, the fact that it has a Vocoder & it sounds as good as it does is just an added bonus to that machine. Just scan through the youtube demos, that thing is just the fucking shit. Nowadays everybody's making mono synths, everybody's gonna make a polly if the aren't already, but whoever brings back one of these dinosaurs is gonna be in a sweet position."
synthesizers,378uiy,ouij,1 point,Tue May 26 15:39:36 2015 UTC,"The Streichfett is really more about divide-down string machines like the Solina, more than a vocoder. If you can live with a little less polyphony, you can get some very Solina-type textures from a DCO polysynth. I use my JX-8P for this. With a cheap Joyo phaser pedal on each output, the sound can be rather Jarre-ing.   EDIT: I say ""solina-like"" because the Solina's divide-down oscillators are all phase-locked with respect to each other--a quality shared by the JX (and Juno) DCO design. With a JX, a little detuning and chorus gets you part of the way there. Phasers get you further, especially if the LFOs on each channel are themselves slightly out of phase to create subtle phase tremolos. The entire setup in that quick clip cost less than just the Streichfett module, by the way."
synthesizers,378uiy,remedial_dnd,1 point,Tue May 26 15:43:40 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the VP-330 is a divide down, or at least the string part is, but I think I'll just stick to my Freeman String Symphonizer, or Crumar Orchestrator, or either of my Crumar Performers, or the Solina before I'll ever put up with another actual polly (never met one I liked) & especially a DCO polly, but even with these kind of options, I'd still say the VP-330 sounds more uniquely useful."

One thing I really like about it is the ladder filter, so turning the resonance up doesn't kill the bass.   I swear I'm not in marketing, I just adore this thing."
synthesizers,379tkm,Asteven97,2,Tue May 26 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"The P6 is my answer as well. The interface is much easier to get along with than the Blofeld. It just sounds great. It's digital, but who cares, it sounds better and more versatile than any other synth in it's price range."

synthesizers,379tkm,Asteven97,1 point,Tue May 26 04:49:17 2015 UTC,It looks awesome! I was looking into an outboard synth to get my live setup more spice and this looks like it can compete with the bloefeld easy. Have you had a chance to try both perhaps and can give some points on each?
synthesizers,379tkm,OneMillionToys,2,Tue May 26 04:52:23 2015 UTC,"Haven't personally tried the P6, but I've tried the Blofeld. The Blofeld is better at weird shit. Crazy soundscapes, trippy ambience, etc., whereas the P6 is geared towards pads, basses, and leads."
synthesizers,379tkm,Asteven97,1 point,Tue May 26 05:01:24 2015 UTC,"Is that to say the blofeld can't achieve similar results in that department? (Pads/leads/bass), also the P6 has 6 modulation slots, I guess you can do some crazy stuff there :)"

synthesizers,379tkm,OneMillionToys,2,Tue May 26 09:14:11 2015 UTC,"Thought I would chime in just to say that the 6 modulation slots are modulation slots (what else could that be :), with source / destination and mod amount. This comes in addition to the fixed routing in the internal synth engine (like lfo1 to osc1 shape, lfo2 and env2 to filter cutoff, etc...)  To be totally complete, there are 3 ""scalers"" object and 1 lag processor available too. The upcoming 2.0 firmware will add quite a few oscillator algos, filter algos, an 8-step seq mode for the lfos as well as a quite fun step pattern to the arpeggio."

It can do a little bit of just about everything and it can do it well, plus you don't have to lug around another full sized keyboard.  You'd have some money left over you could put towards a nice reverb unit, which is a big part of pads IMO.  Another honorable mention is the matrix 1000/6. You have to have some sort of sysex editor to make patches, but it's analog, and sounds really good for the price."
synthesizers,379tkm,cherubthrowaway,4,Tue May 26 04:22:10 2015 UTC,"I've been really happy with the esq-1. It's very easy to program and I find that the hybrid sound fits astoundingly well in the mix with bass, guitar, drums. The modulation routings that are possible make it a very deep synth in comparison to some analogs I've used.  Ive never made a mono sound that I really liked but you already have the ms20 for that (I use a minibrute). Also it's one of the few synths that's pretty cheap on the used market.  Even though it doesnt have knobs I genuinely enjoy programming on it. It sort of lends itself to a sense of completeness with a patch."

I've been hovering over pulling the trigger on one ever since I got the chance to play with one. It's compact, powerful and at the press of a button, turns into an SH101 that's pretty much 98% there. Don't listen to the hate. Play one and listen to your own feelings on the matter.   I think most of us here would say to avoid the Poly800 though. It's pretty meh as it stands; next to a Juno 106 it will just sound bad. I'd steer clear also of the Alpha Juno if only because you already cover that kind of territory with your 106. Not sure what you mean by 'all the MIDI needed for it'. You can either use MIDI or not, if you're playing them live you won't really need to use MIDI unless you're playing them via a master keyboard.   Other great used synths to go for in your price range include the Korg MS2000, Nord Lead 2, Yamaha AN1x, Ensoniq ESQ1/SQ80, Novation KS4/5, Virus B."

It's rubbish."
synthesizers,377iw5,ouij,2,Mon May 25 18:17:09 2015 UTC,"Wait, why would they be LFO or Envelope inputs only? It's just CV, right?"

synthesizers,377iw5,maxm,1 point,Mon May 25 18:50:30 2015 UTC,Theoretically they could have different sample frequencies. Envelope mig need higher frequency than lfo for snappy envelopes.
synthesizers,377iw5,destroyosaurusrex,2,Mon May 25 20:42:00 2015 UTC,Does anybody know if the 1m is compatible with an ms-20 mini or are the voltages different? I'm trying to look for any modules that would work with an ms-20 but it's tricky to find anything.
synthesizers,377iw5,FieldsofBlue,3,Mon May 25 20:18:56 2015 UTC,"It's standard euro so V/OCt instead of the Hz/V of the Ms20. You can still make some use of it for non pitch sensitive stuff but it's not really worth it IMO. That's the one bad thing about the MS 20, but you could get a English Tear from Harvestman which is specifically designed to solve this.   Of course that means you need to buy a case, power supply and the module itself before having anything that actually does something."
synthesizers,377iw5,FieldsofBlue,0,Mon May 25 21:11:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's a disappointing bit; this whole thing is digital so any CV it accepts is being interpreted by a processor rather than having the CV directly change voltage in the circuitry. It probably would have been very easy to add a toggle for it to respond to either hz/v or v/oct, but they didn't."
synthesizers,377iw5,janthorpe1,2,Mon May 25 21:49:52 2015 UTC,"Well, adding stuff costs money, the market for hz/v is not that huge and korg is roland's competitor so it's not that unreasonable.  You get a lot for your money with the MS 20 with the trade of that if you want to expand on it your looking at ~$300 (Happy Ending + English Tear) plus the cost of the modules."
synthesizers,377iw5,janthorpe1,0,Mon May 25 22:34:36 2015 UTC,"I doubt it would be exorbitantly expensive for them to add a toggle somewhere. But the market of hz/v stuff isn't very large, admittedly."
synthesizers,377iw5,FieldsofBlue,2,Tue May 26 00:16:30 2015 UTC,Is there actually anything besides the MS20 that uses hz/v instead of v/oct?

I got mine the first week of May and it felt like it was just dumped on the market.  Now that I'm starting to see some marketing for this synth my fears that Roland dumped this and forgot about it are starting to subside.

synthesizers,377iw5,damien6,2,Tue May 26 04:49:34 2015 UTC,"I don't have any modular gear. Honestly that aspect was secondary to the fact that it's a module as opposed to a full synth. I'm so limited on space I couldn't fit another keyboard. I also wasn't a huge fan of the system 1 keyboard. I like the synth, but the keyboard never did anything for me.  I will probably look at some modular gear at some point but I just did a huge studio upgrade so funds are limited right now. I would be interested in a Pittsburgh Modular system. I'm not really into the bleeps and blips but I've heard they have some pretty monster oscillators in those systems."

I mean, I am excited to get my hands on the Plug Outs, but really, I just wanted a decent poly synth to complement my set up.  The synth itself is a great little unit.  I'm not a big fan of hardware being dependent on software, either.  I was burned by the M-Audio Venom that was never even really completed before they dumped support for it.  I do agree that hardware should stand on its own, but the System 1m is a great unit with a lot of functionality even without the software component."

synthesizers,37752l,beardslap,7,Mon May 25 12:48:25 2015 UTC,Is it just me or in all these demos does everyone keep overdoing the oscillator detuning to the point where it sounds out of tune? Are they trying to force the analog VCO drift effect or something? I would love to hear just two oscillators with no detuning to see the actual oscillator drift.  I'm not totally sold on the 6 over the 8 and the 12. If I were to purchase one I'd have to spend a lot of time messing around with them all. I have the feeling I'd actually go for the 12 given my tastes.
synthesizers,37752l,hafilax,5,Mon May 25 15:55:11 2015 UTC,"I also think he's really overdoing the detuning in a lot of points in this demo, especially the intro song...  I already own a P12, and based on this demo video I'm not really compelled by the P6, I didn't hear anything I couldn't already patch up... the one feature I think is pretty cool is the chord sequencer."
synthesizers,37752l,kisielk,5,Mon May 25 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"According to Dave Smith, the VCOs are ultra stable; if you blow across them on the board they'll drift, but otherwise they are rock steady. Can't really see the point of having rock steady VCOs instead of DCOs in that case, but I guess some people will be happy that it doesn't have the word 'digital' in it."
synthesizers,37752l,t0xicd0g,3,Mon May 25 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"Probably because VCO's just sound slightly different than DCO's, same reason I own a SG with P-90's & a SG with overwound humbuckers & an SG with PAF's, cause all of them sound like SG's... But slightly different."
synthesizers,37752l,remedial_dnd,2,Tue May 26 12:12:35 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone with synths with both, that's just not true. It's another analogue myth. The raw oscillators sound the same on my Microbrute, AX73, and Tetra. Any differences tend to be more about how much of the edge is taken off the waveform, which has nothing to do with whether the clock is digital or voltage controlled. Hell, even my va synths sound very similar unless you play them at high pitches and get aliasing. VCOs drift more, but in terms of how they sound, there is no difference."
synthesizers,37752l,t0xicd0g,2,Tue May 26 12:37:10 2015 UTC,For a long time I've wondered if there's really a fundamental difference between a DCO and a highly pitch-stable VCO. The most intuitively convincing argument I've heard is that they will handle pitch glides differently but I don't know electronics well enough to say this is true for sure.
synthesizers,37752l,tugs_cub,1 point,Tue May 26 23:42:48 2015 UTC,"All synths handle glides slightly differently, so it's hardly worth worrying about!"
synthesizers,37752l,t0xicd0g,2,Tue May 26 23:44:28 2015 UTC,Then the question seems to become - is there actually a good reason to have VCOs in something like the Prophet 6 if you're going to have a microcontroller continuously compensate the CV? I feel like DSI actually took that position for a long time before they decided satisfy the demand for discrete analog everything.
synthesizers,37752l,tugs_cub,2,Wed May 27 02:22:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the Prophet 6 really is fanservice to satisfy the demand for voltage controlled everything. If you look at Dave's trajectory before this, he went for DCOs, then completely digital oscillators in the Pro 2 and Prophet 12; going full analogue is a bit of a surprise move from a guy who faces forward almost all the time."
synthesizers,37752l,t0xicd0g,2,Wed May 27 07:13:18 2015 UTC,"VCOs drift more     Exactly, therefore they sound different."

To me, there are a few reasons to want the Prophet 6:   The Filter. From what I understand, the low-pass filter is a copy of the now near unobtainable SSM 24 dB/Oct filter. I have one such SSM chip in my Doepfer A-105 SSM, and I happen to like its response. it would be nice to have it in a polyphonic instrument. The Interface. For a gigging keyboardist, the Prophet 6's interface is pretty compelling, in that it's very easy to see what's happening and reach out and change what you want. Also, like the Sub Phatty, you can toggle the front panel ""live"" at any time, which makes for a nice, quick program change without necessarily setting up a playlist of quick-recall presets. (Not that the playlist idea is bad--my JX-8P does this, and the Prophet 12 does too, but if you prefer a ""front panel live now"" button, the prophet 6 will do that). The Sequencer/Arpeggiator Seriously, this looks like a lot of fun, especially in a band context.    There are other reasons I think it's cool. I would like to play with the Poly-mod section, since I never used a Prophet 5, for instance.   I mean, does any of this make it suitable for modern music? I don't know. Is a Minimoog modern?"

Vintage analog synthesizers are the most desirable instruments within electronic music.   These two statements are not mutually exclusive. A synthesizer is a just another tool in your arsenal  EDIT: many people, especially those who don't have deep pockets, still covet vintage analog synthesizers. this is evident in that most commercial VST's are analog modeling and doubly so for hardware digital synths. they choose these synths despite their flexibility and sometimes because of how simple they are."
synthesizers,37752l,t0xicd0g,5,Mon May 25 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"Analogue modelling != vintage. Vintage synths usually have one LFO, hardwired to modulate pitch or maybe able to modulate pitch and filter, one or two EGs that are hardwired to filter and amp. Most VSTs are like modern virtual analogues or modern analogue synths, ie a huge matrix of multiple LFOs, EGs and with boundless connection possibilities. Just because most VSTs are analogue modelling doesn't mean they are modelling vintage synths. Analogue has evolved far beyond the vintage layouts.  It's very telling that direct emulations like Oddity also add much extra functionality from the modern age on top of the original's fairly simple structure.  Edit: To also answer your original point about there being few analogue polys on the market, DSI have been making the Tetra, Prophet 08 and Mopho X4 for years."

But, I feel that ignores the broader point that vintage analog synths are often considered the benchmark. I'm not making a value judgement, just pointing out that most synth software that is released is largely based on legacy brands in spite of the new technology that the software adds. Analog modelling came about due to resurgence of vintage synths in the 90's.   I don't think it's a controversial statement  that vintage analog synthesizers are the most desirable instruments within electronic music. And yes, DSI has 3 other poly synths (none of them VCO)... I believe 3 qualifies as few. By the time I finished this comment, I'm sure someone else is going to release an mono analog."
synthesizers,37752l,t0xicd0g,3,Mon May 25 16:28:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think vintage gear is the benchmark any more. Since people started making analogue synths again the bar has risen dramatically in terms of what we consider to be quality and features. Look how we laughed at Akai's Rhythm Wolf, a synth that would have been pretty cool in 1984. These days we're looking at complex gear like the Prophet 12 that can revisit all the analogue territory in the world but can go so much further; the Sub37, the Prophet 08, Modulus 002, even the Bass Station 2 and Mopho at the lower end of the market have feature sets that make the Pro 1 blush.  Vintage gear stopped being a yardstick a while back. People still like the sound of some vintage synths, and that's fair enough, but to suggest they are a benchmark for modern gear that makes them mostly look woefully underspecified is perhaps not accurate.   And DCOs are still analogue. That argument is long, long dead and is not being resurrected here."
synthesizers,37752l,weedpot42069,1 point,Mon May 25 17:32:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think the Akai Rhythm Wolf would have been pretty cool in 1984. I'm not denying the impact and the direction of modern synth making. Hell, I'm sure we would both agree that the market is moving toward modular, and with good reason (for reasons you've mentioned above).   My exact quote was that vintage analog synths are often considered the benchmark. The push back on this is hilarious to me. This is not controversial man, I'm not saying that synthesis hasn't evolved beyond that point, nor am I saying that vintage gear is the be all and end all, just saying that a lot of folks consider it to be the benchmark.  In the same way a 57' chevy may be considered a benchmark so can a Prophet 5. The TR-808 is considered a benchmark analog drum machine despite the fact that it doesn't have a scatter button, or howl, or have a complex modulation matrix. It's usage over the last 30 years has  solidified its presence in history and quite frankly, that's a difficult obstacle to overcome.   I never suggested that DCO's weren't analog but they are different than VCO's. Some people prefer VCO's to DCO's and there hasn't been a poly synth made with VCO's in a really, really long time."
synthesizers,37752l,t0xicd0g,4,Mon May 25 23:08:00 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstand what a benchmark is. I'd agree that the 808 is seen as a cornerstone of analogue drum sounds; as the 303 is a cornerstone of acid bass, their overuse within a handful of genres has cemented the position of their sounds as a benchmark; but I think most people would agree that the 303 as a synth is actually a pain in the ass to use and is incredibly limited. Does the industry chase the sounds of analogue? Of course. But it's the sound that is the benchmark, not the hardware.   Modern benchmark synths, to examine their influence on the design of other synths, would be things like the Prophet 08, Bass Station 2, Access Virus A, B, C , Nord Lead 2. If you look at a lot of modern synths, they all owe something of their design to one or more of these. I'm not discrediting the influence of the Prophet 5 - it's clearly a huge influence on the design of these modern synths - but in terms of capability it stopped being a benchmark as soon as the Prophet 08 dropped and redefined what an analogue poly could be in the 21st century. Same for the Minimoog. Important, yes. But these days, very, very basic - the increased complexity of the Voyager and Sub37 makes them more of a benchmark than the Minimoog.  In summary, a benchmark is a thing used by the industry as a minimum feature set or quality that their newer gear needs to achieve to be competitive and desirable. Do people want a Prophet 6? Sure. Because, as Roland and Korg have demonstrated, there are a lot of people who want to buy vintage gear just because. But would any one really hold an MS20 Mini or Prophet 6 as an actual benchmark in a market that also contains the Sub37 and Prophet 12? Nah. They are fanservice, not innovation.   And I'd certainly disagree that the market is moving toward modular. Modular is having a Renaissance, but it is still a tiny, tiny backwater in a small community. Monophonic, unstable, expensive and without patch memory, it will never be mainstream, Roland will never give up making their more lucrative analogue modelling synths in favour of modular. You can't use them live reliably, it takes forever to patch, it's relatively complex, all of these things conspire to keep modular a niche."
synthesizers,37752l,weedpot42069,1 point,Tue May 26 07:15:43 2015 UTC,"I think you just like to argue :)   benchmark a :  a point of reference from which measurements may be made  b :  something that serves as a standard by which others may be measured or judged  Every single synthesizer that is released today is also competing with the used synth market. This is in spite of all the flaws of a vintage synth (no guarantee on how long they will last, difficult to service, limitations, etc). Analog synthesizers left the market for a really time and were brought back after manufacturers saw the resurgence of the secondary market.   The Prophet 08 is an excellent synth, no doubt. It is much more advanced than the P5 and most likely anything Sequential ever released. Despite that, it's marketed as a successor and retains the prophet name for a reason, wouldn't you agree? Dave Smith understands the legacy power of his former brands. It doesn't mean shit how many modulation options the keyboard has if no one uses it to make music. The P5 was one of the most advanced synths at the time it was released for about a minute, yet it still kept its place as a benchmark synth right until digital synths were starting to be released.  Usability and visability is what determines benchmark status and is more important than feature set, at the end of the day. The Prophet 08, despite how advanced it is,  doesn't really mean much in terms of benchmarking because the price of the Prophet 08 dropped almost 60% on the used market since they were released. The Prophet 5, in that same time period (from when the Prophet 08 was released), increased in price.  I will agree that the Prophet 08 is the modern benchmark for analog poly synths.   The Bass Station 2 is a great, affordable piece of kit. It's considered an inexpensive sh-101 clone. Also like the Prophet, calls in on its legacy. The Access Virus clearly influenced synths like Maschine. It's a bench mark digital synth.    If you look at a lot of modern synths, they all owe something of their design to one or more of these.   They also share a lot in common with the Prophet 5, Jupiter 8, OB 8, and the Elka Synthex, too.  Listen, as great as modern synths capabilities are, the synth manufacturers know they still have to have a foot in the past. While there are differences, most synths are more similar than they are different.  The Voyager did not replace the Minimoog D in any demonstrable way. When the Voyager eventually gets discontinued, let me know when they make a VST version.   Contrary to what you might believe, it's pretty much all fan service. Companies don't exist to be innovative, they exist to make money. The current trend is EDM and you're seeing a lot of manufacturers cater to this. The innovation is happening in software, which sure, can be implemented in hardware but let's not kid ourselves where it's happening first.  Roland doesn't drive the analog synthesizer market so it's irrelevant that they'll continue making VA. I highly doubt they'll continue making VA though for the next 10 years though. The analog synth market is about to get extremely diluted (i'd argue the analog monosynth market is already) once Behringer enters the market. Modular is having a major renaissance but there is no denying the community is growing. The things that make it unstable are not intrinsic to modular. You can use them live reliably, and it does not take forever to patch, in fact it's pretty relative. And you're forgetting that they're inexpensive to produce.    But it's the sound that is the benchmark, not the hardware.   No kidding, but seeing as the two are inexplicably linked, it's the whole package, which is my point. The sound is the most important aspect of a synthesizer whether it requires 30 LFO's or just 1.    a benchmark is a thing used by the industry as a minimum feature set or quality that their newer gear needs to achieve to be competitive and desirable.   This is a definition that you made up to fit your argument. Above is the definition provided by Websters. And even using your definition, me saying that, ""a lot of folks consider analog synths to be the benchmark for synthesizers."" is not wrong in any way.  I'm not sure why you're upset about this."

Regardless, you should just buy it anyway and find out for yourself. Even if you hate it, you'll be able to make a profit if you flip it."
synthesizers,376v2w,sheboygan_sexpo,1 point,Mon May 25 15:15:35 2015 UTC,"I don't have the blo, but a pulse 2. The arp does send midi out and I've sequenced other synths with it. Can't speak confidently about the blofeld, but I imagine it's the same."
synthesizers,376v2w,travx259r,1 point,Mon May 25 12:51:02 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the keyboard, but the desktop Blofeld definitely doesn't (it doesn't have a MIDI out, either, though). I haven't seen anything indicating that the keyboard's arp does send MIDI."
synthesizers,376v2w,gimbers,1 point,Tue May 26 04:40:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, unfortunately it doesn't send the arp over MIDI. But there's a weird timing bug with the first arp note which makes it so you might not even want to use it like that.  Otherwise the keyboard is really nice, so it's a bit of a shame that it lacks this."
synthesizers,376v2w,kolmone,1 point,Tue May 26 05:52:54 2015 UTC,"Well that's sort of a deal breaker I guess, since I plan to use the arpeggiator in quite a few instances. Have you confirmed this to be the case with more than your own Blo Keyboard?"
synthesizers,376v2w,kolmone,2,Tue May 26 06:27:19 2015 UTC,Here's an old reply to someone from Waldorf: https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=86770  And there's also some more recent discussion about it on a Waldorf related mailing list: http://waldorf-forum.com/pipermail/user-forum/2013-March/028040.html  Yeah sucks if you need the arp. I was planning to get a Mutable Instruments MIDIPal to go with mine but that's now been discontinued.

synthesizers,376v2w,echo-eko,1 point,Tue May 26 16:40:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the confirmation. I'll probably end up getting the Blo anyways since every other aspect of it seems really, really good.  I was still planning on getting myself the Minibrute some time in the future which I guess could take care of the whole arp problem for me.  The issue is that I wanted to use the Blo for some of my tracks to send arp notes to my Volca Keys but as it stands now, I'll probably replace my Keys all together when I get the Brute. Time will tell, I guess."

synthesizers,3769pq,diode_milliampere,5,Tue May 26 14:29:38 2015 UTC,Perhaps you saw this on reddit where the author posted it yesterday?
synthesizers,3769pq,FullFrontalNoodly,6,Mon May 25 09:15:18 2015 UTC,"I actually saw it the first time he posted it.  One of the mods went on a power trip yesterday and deleted both of /u/diode_milliampere's posts for violating the ""for sale"" rule of the subreddit, which I find absolutely ridiculous.  Here we have a long-time, contributing member of the community who has created something that is useful and interesting to the community, and he gets shut down because of a rule voted on the community and put into place specifically for the purpose of stopping secondhand gear sales from non-contributors, who were, at the time, simply dropping ads into the community and leaving without even responding to their own thread. His second post didn't even have a link to the sale page; it was just an imgur album with pictures of the zine.  Nevermind that our members post links to their personal bandcamp sites constantly, or that we're always sharing interesting products for sale that are relevant to the synth community, or that the mods invite people here to market their products in the form of AMAs.  I personally find that kind of moderation unacceptable. It's quashing solid, relevant content that revitalizes old, forgotten hardware (ironically, on the same day the mods announced their free advertising campaign for the Juno 66 hardware upgrade kit). What could possibly be more germane to the community than this? This is not even remotely the kind of content I hoped to see removed when the community asked the moderators to remove ""for sale"" posts, and I'm going out on a limb to say that I don't think anyone else had this in mind either.  For the record, I messaged the mods about my issues with this content removal and received no response.  Anyway, there doesn't seem to be any rule against posting about someone else's shit for sale, so that's where we are now."
synthesizers,3769pq,the_cody,2,Mon May 25 15:24:18 2015 UTC,We make mistakes. Sorry.
synthesizers,3769pq,the_cody,2,Mon May 25 23:39:26 2015 UTC,"We're actively working on it. We've realized it was a mistake and we're taking steps to make sure we minimize this sorta problem in the future.  We're pretty good about killing ""hit and run blogspam"" and the ""I have $200, what analog synth should I get"" posts. The sales posts are a bit more nebulous for us. Sometimes, we kill a reasonable post and sometimes we leave up one that's really spam.  We like seeing relevant, new and interesting products, but no one wants to feel like they're just a canned marketing audience."
synthesizers,3769pq,mdrsharp,3,Tue May 26 12:41:35 2015 UTC,"Power trip? I was the mod who disallowed it and I'd like to explain the reason I did so, and how it is being resolved.    As we all know, this subreddit does not allow ""for sale"" posts.  The logic being that a trade or sale gone wrong could hurt the community and change the tone of /r/synthesizers.  Secondly, we would be inundated with for sale posts and actual synthesizer related discussion happening here would be minimal.  Thirdly, I would be heartbroken if one of our members were taken advantage of in any way.  If you want to arrange for a sale or trade off of the sub then I cannot stop you and I won't try.  This is not new, I've said the same in previous posts.  We are a group of people who love synthesizers and we come here to share our love of synthesizers with other like minded individuals.  The overall tone of the tone of /r/synthesizers is positive, we don't slam or criticize others for their ideas or support the idea of elitism that is very prevalent in other forums.    At first I just considered it another ""for sale"" post and I didn't take a whole lot of time to really understand it, so it was removed.  Another user contacted the mods and asked that we reconsider.  I honestly thought about it and I came to the conclusion that maybe we should reevaluate our stance...  /u/diode_milliampere has been a longtime contributor and he has been a positive member of the community and my logic is ""shouldn't we support members of the community who help make it a great place?""  And my answer to my own question was ""yes"".  And it's obvious that he has put a substantial amount of work compiling this information and it could benefit the group in many ways.  I have sent /u/diode_milliampere a message asking him if he would like to make a new post in regards to his publication that would be in the spirit of an AMA.  I'm still awaiting his response.  I'm glad that some of our members have spoken up and challenged us to think differently.  I guess it's important to reevaluate our ideas and how we do things (not just here, but in our real lives).  So when you say ""power trip"" I'm a bit bothered because more is happening than meets the eye."
synthesizers,3769pq,mdrsharp,3,Tue May 26 21:00:47 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I was harsh in my word choice; I don't imagine you sitting at your computer laughing maniacally as you remove posts willy-nilly.  I agree with your reasoning for not allowing ""for sale"" posts, and I remember the discussion in this subreddit that led to that rule being put into place. What alarmed me was that diode's posts about his zine didn't seem to be infringing on the spirit of that rule any more than the dozens of other bandcamp links we get here. Then, seeing the second post of his (with no link to anything for sale) also get removed sent up a huge red flag in my mind.  I am extremely pleased to hear that you've given your position on the issue another thought. One of my very favourite things about our community here is our appreciation of the work people put in to keeping otherwise obsolete technologies relevant and useful."

I clicked on them somewhat by accident because I did recognize the username.  It is possible he deleted them after they were flagged by the mods.  I'm well familiar with reddit's 10:1 rule, but from my recollection of events the mods were acting appropriately on this one.  However, I will grant that if his first commercial posting was flagged by the mods, then yes, I would agree that the mods acted overzealously on that one."

Lots of rhodes forums out there with people who know all the details.  Try there also.  I have a 73 mark 1 and could compare the wiring with mine.

synthesizers,3762pg,bak4320,2,Mon May 25 06:25:30 2015 UTC,For volume check the distance between pickups and tines.  Do you notice a difference in the settings between the middle octaves and treble range?
synthesizers,3762pg,afterjohn,1 point,Mon May 25 07:15:51 2015 UTC,"What about the hammers? They'll get these perfects grooves in them from striking the tines & only produce a muffled, dampened sound."
synthesizers,3762pg,dethroned_dictaphone,1 point,Mon May 25 13:23:36 2015 UTC,"If the strike-line and the hammer tips are good (as already mentioned), and the pickups are lined up with the tine tips when viewed from above, then you can adjust the relative volume of each note by adjusting the pickup's position closer to the tine.  Prepare to spend a few hours with the harp cover off and a screwdriver in hand, going ""plong plong plong <adjust> plong plong plong <adjust again>"" for every key.  You can change not only the volume of each note with the pickup screw, but the balance of of fundamental tone to overtones (the Rhodes ""bark"") with the tine height adjustment screws.    While you're in there, plug it into an accurate tuner and adjust the tuning springs on the lower tines for any notes that are blatantly out too.  Learn from my mistakes though:  Don't bother trying to adjust the high treble end unless they're really badly out, as the shorter the tine, the more sensitive the tuning is to minute adjustments of the tuning spring.  The highest octave is so touchy, you'll go to move the spring for a note that's several cents flat, move it just the tiniest fraction of a movement inwards, and suddenly it's three semitones sharp and GODDAMNIT!  I used the service manual and very patiently plonked away at my mk1 Stage 73 for about six hours one day, and it went from sounding really beat up and uneven (and awfully out of tune, enough to make me wonder what happened to the poor thing in its earlier life) to sounding really pretty."
synthesizers,375ygg,turdspeed,2,Mon May 25 04:03:41 2015 UTC,Have you seen the CB55 clone PCBs? That plus an arduino and a couple hours learning MIDI serial communications and you've got the best possible way to sequence a DR-55.

synthesizers,375ygg,jepyang,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:59:29 2015 UTC,"I've assembled the board and programmed an arduino to send 5v triggers according to incoming MIDI, but as far as physical construction, it's still very much a prototype situation."

synthesizers,375ygg,Lurkmcgirk,4,Mon May 25 10:34:23 2015 UTC,"To clarify, the trigger outs on the 606/707/808/909 are not derived from the ""sounds"", but rather a separate CPU channel which receives the same sequence as the sound channel.  That high/low CPU signal passes through a transistor and resistor configuration which defines the level of the trigger, +5V in the case of most if not all. If one is ever able to trigger a device with an audio signal, it's really a lucky fluke more than an intended design.   http://i.imgur.com/igNFcHJ.jpg"
synthesizers,375ygg,grauniad_angel,2,Mon May 25 11:03:32 2015 UTC,"very interesting. i've sampled that trig out sound from my 626 and it works from my maudio torq audio interface to trigger 101s, amdek hck-100 etc from my daw using a sample player. i guess the audio interface has to run 'hot' to enable this +5v level, but it's very reliable and more flexible than an x0x sequencer."
synthesizers,375ygg,Lurkmcgirk,3,Mon May 25 12:08:45 2015 UTC,"If you sample the trig out, you're sampling a DC pulse (assuming there's no AC coupling in your sample input signal path), so that would work and would certainly be more flexible in another sequencer, although without the hands-on mutes and pattern selection.  Pretty clever, though.  Sampling the Rim Shot audio out would not give you the same result."
synthesizers,375ygg,grauniad_angel,1 point,Mon May 25 12:15:17 2015 UTC,"tbh i think if you 'crank the volume' any sound so that it's a square wave pulse it will work but i never tried. you can rig hands on mutes and pattern selection from most daws, particularly ableton. i tend to sequence tracks rather than jam so it isn't an issue for me."
synthesizers,375ygg,Lurkmcgirk,2,Mon May 25 12:30:17 2015 UTC,"For folks without a trigger to sample, it would surely also work if you were to generate a clean square wave with any plug-in instrument, record as audio within the DAW, crop the audio to be one single pulse and just the high phase of the cycle.  Then use that snippet wherever you want a trigger message.  Of course, you'd need a multi-output soundcard to take full advantage of this, unless the DAW is only being used for sync."
synthesizers,375ygg,grauniad_angel,1 point,Mon May 25 13:49:39 2015 UTC,"yeah and the soundcard has to output ""hot/loud"" enough. my samplers don't playback loud enough to trigger my roland gear.  there's a sample of the 808 trigger in one of the goldbaby packs, or there's a guy down the bottom of this thread hosting one:  http://www.vintagesynth.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=66862"

synthesizers,375ygg,grauniad_angel,1 point,Mon May 25 14:03:12 2015 UTC,yeah that makes sense. the soundcard output thing was more compact than that and didn't involve getting samples onto a sampler so i went with the path of most convenience :)
synthesizers,375ygg,jepyang,1 point,Mon May 25 14:47:20 2015 UTC,"If one is ever able to trigger a device with an audio signal, it's really a lucky fluke more than an intended design.   I actually have an Akai ME35T, which is designed to do exactly that. It's a box with a bunch of trigger inputs on the back and MIDI I/O. Rather than just accepting straight 5v triggers, it will take pretty much any trigger or audio signal, and has settings to adjust each input for the best possible response. (This also means it's velocity sensitive!)  Unfortunately, none of this is super helpful to the OP, since the DR units are pre-midi."
synthesizers,375ygg,Lurkmcgirk,2,Mon May 25 15:38:57 2015 UTC,"Cool unit, but as you know, that's built for that purpose.  Not the same as just patching an audio out to a trigger in and having success."
synthesizers,375ygg,si_si_si,1 point,Mon May 25 16:49:12 2015 UTC,Would this take the tempo from the trigger pulse and output it as a midi clock? Because that's totally what I'm after right now!
synthesizers,375ygg,jepyang,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:28:13 2015 UTC,"No, it translates triggers to MIDI notes rather than clock.  I think that a Monotribe with MIDI add-on (simple mod, no soldering) can do this though."
synthesizers,375ygg,TTRSkidlz,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:36:03 2015 UTC,"The easiest way is to use the built in sequencer and add a sync input.    I put a switched 1/8"" jack between the tempo clock generator and the 110's cpu. If nothing is connected, it runs like normal. If you plug in a clock source, it runs off of that.    I also built a MIDI to 12 ppqn trigger adapter so I can sync to MIDI.    You can certainly make it accept a trigger per drum, but it a little fickle. For things to sound right, the triggers need to be 1ms long, 5v and inverted. Also, the clap needs a train of pulses then a delayed pulse.    You might be able to hijack the buttons and make the CPU generate the triggers. The whole matrix scanning setup makes is seem tricky though. Maybe some FETs across the buttons?"
synthesizers,375ygg,mierscheid,1 point,Mon May 25 14:26:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for your response. The sync input seems like the best way to go. I think I'll give that a try. Should work for the dr55 as well.  Triggering the voices individually from a 707 would be killer but I guess not possible

synthesizers,375afg,hafilax,2,Mon May 25 01:13:59 2015 UTC,"They are crazy expensive because you pay a premium for each piece. You can dabble a bit with semi-modulars like the MS20mini, microbrute, etc. for much less. The full modular is how you get sounds that are way out there.  I think my guess was pretty good."

But for a casual hobbyist, it may lead to quite a backlog of unfinished projects. I'm totally not biased in the matter (COUGH several modules, a steiner-parker Shruti and 8 voice Ambika...)"
synthesizers,375afg,jepyang,1 point,Mon May 25 22:44:27 2015 UTC,There's a pretty huge middle ground between an analog synth hobbyist putting together a modest system and an electrical engineer building $100k wall o' synth.

There are so many great sounds on that album, but to attribute them to Kanye is a bit off, I doubt he touched any instruments."
synthesizers,375afg,Gyroo-,7,Mon May 25 01:56:59 2015 UTC,"Kanye was a producer before he was a rapper, and he's credited as producer on most of the songs on the album so its safe to say that he did at least some of the production.  I know Daft Punk were involved with some of the songs as well."
synthesizers,375afg,whocareswhatever,-3,Mon May 25 02:45:28 2015 UTC,"Producer can have many meanings, he might have done it all or nothing, I just have a feeling he's not responsible for much. I think it's a great record except for the unmusical overuse of autotune which seems to me to be Kanyes only personal mark. I don't know him or anyone involved, this is just what I get off the record."
synthesizers,375afg,JeanneDOrc,11,Mon May 25 03:05:25 2015 UTC,I just have a feeling he's not responsible for much.   He was known for skill with the ASR-10. Your opinion of him is irrelevant to his abilities.

synthesizers,374qlt,internetjohn,7,Sun May 24 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"Here's a video about some sounds used in Paracosm.  (there is also a part 2)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8HCG87RJM  Apart from that, Washed Out uses tons of reverb. That's where the ""airy"" sound comes from.   For the first synth that you hear in this song, it sounds like a triangle wave with a lot of voices. I recreated on a software synth and here is what I had to do.  Bandpass filter with a little bit of resonance that has the cutoff hooked up to a (slow) LFO. Also sounds like there is an LFO on the panning of the synth. I also mapped the same LFO from above to the oscillator's volume, so it gets louder when the cutoff knob is higher. With this, I came pretty close. Don't forget the reverb.  Look into tape saturation, reverb, and just come up with some pleasing synths and you can sound like washed out."

synthesizers,374qlt,AlchemyMoth,4,Sun May 24 22:50:54 2015 UTC,"Also a beginner but I'd say for the swirling synth, an LFO on a Bandpass filter, with a separate slower modulation on the panning."
synthesizers,374ueo,tehskwrl,6,Sun May 24 22:02:26 2015 UTC,It's a lot cheaper to just doubletrack it on your DAW...
synthesizers,374ueo,t0xicd0g,1 point,Mon May 25 00:20:01 2015 UTC,"Cheaper for sure, I was thinking more of the playing around with them part though. I'm interested to know how they would work together with slight detune on one when feeding it through the input of the second."
synthesizers,374ueo,t0xicd0g,3,Mon May 25 06:52:14 2015 UTC,"Fat and overpowering, at a guess. Man, that's an expensive way to scratch the vaguest of itches. If you have money burning a hole, you'd be much better served buying something totally different to the gear you already have to expand your horizons rather than doubling up on what you already have just to satisfy a whim."
synthesizers,374ueo,t0xicd0g,0,Mon May 25 06:58:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, I fully understand this. Which is why I plan to play around with it at the store instead of making the purchase. Its definitely a whim, and one that I am seriously curious about, but not something that I can foresee actually owning the pieces for. I'm curious for experimentation sake and was wondering if anyone had tried it out prior so I could learn from their experience rather than do it myself (because while I have access to a second Minitaur, I usually feel kinda bad going to the store and taking up my friends time with all the banter that we have while he is supposed to be assisting other people). Haven't been kicked out yet, though!"
synthesizers,374ueo,t0xicd0g,2,Mon May 25 07:05:16 2015 UTC,"If you're just going to throw it through the Minitaur's input, presumably you're also going to leave the filter wide open (otherwise it will sound very muffled compared to the processing Minitaur), in which case you're really just using it as an oscillator. Any 2 oscillator synth could stand in for it, in that case, so there's another way to ease your curiosity."
synthesizers,374ueo,riley212,0,Mon May 25 07:12:41 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought it through regarding the filter part, but you are correct I would more than likely leave it wide open to be processed. I think the reason I chose the Minitaur for this experiment is because of the size of the body, not the size of the sound. I am still curious, though, and since I do have another synth with two oscillators I will give that a try at home instead :) Thank you! I really appreciate your input!!"
synthesizers,374ueo,ouij,1 point,Mon May 25 07:21:00 2015 UTC,"No worries, it's an experiment I've done myself a few times, in my case running anything and everything through my Microbrute filter (favourite effects include the TR8 with the BruteFactor knob turned up and the DX7 with warbling self oscillation whistling around it). I have run the unfiltered oscillators of my Volca Bass through it to make a 4 oscillator mono before now. It sounded huge and awesome but also slightly unusable - I can't imagine the resultant sound fitting easily into a mix!"
synthesizers,374ueo,vantseattle,2,Mon May 25 14:43:38 2015 UTC,"I play my minitaur and sub37 together quite often, usually using the mini as a dual sub osc. the sound is about as big as you could want and washes pretty much everything out of a mix. sure sound cool though. add the microbrute into it and it starts to turn into mud"
synthesizers,374ueo,vantseattle,2,Mon May 25 11:14:28 2015 UTC,"I mean, why not? Or, rather: what about this combination would be unusual?"
synthesizers,374ueo,pimpmaschine,-1,Sun May 24 22:46:53 2015 UTC,This is exactly the reason why I am broke. I'm gonna bring my minitaur to the store to try it hehe
synthesizers,374ueo,admosquad,1 point,Sun May 24 23:30:34 2015 UTC,"It would definitely thicken the sound, (even though one minitaur is practically thick enough?)  I would like this to try out adjusting the pitch on the 2nd unit to create heavier chords."
synthesizers,374ueo,admosquad,1 point,Mon May 25 03:39:55 2015 UTC,"I do agree that the sound is quite thick on its own. I'm interested in the audible beats that would occur through detuning. I'm going to head to my favourite music store and test it out before committing to anything... As well, as suggested by another, after I've done my experiment I am going to try and recreate it using recorded sequences in my daw and layer the two that way, see if there is any difference."
synthesizers,374ueo,admosquad,1 point,Mon May 25 06:56:08 2015 UTC,"Rather, propose a minitaur-only-jam, only the stipulation is that you control all the minitaur's and the other participants get to watch."
synthesizers,374m9k,destroyosaurusrex,7,Sun May 24 20:53:11 2015 UTC,"Those are usually used as splitters and not mixers. Connecting two outputs together doesn't always work as expected, as you have found out. Something like the ART Splitmix4 would help or some other passive mixer. You might lose a bit of volume but I'm guessing the amp has enough gain to make it up."

synthesizers,374m9k,Lurkmcgirk,1 point,Sun May 24 21:07:25 2015 UTC,Yeah the audio is definitely crappier every time I add something but the part that confuses me the most is the skipping with the two volcas.
synthesizers,374m9k,ranzee,2,Sun May 24 21:44:53 2015 UTC,"I found it hard to make out skipping in your video.  I don't see how combining audio signals would affect that, unless it is a ground issue and the clock gets delayed for a moment when connecting.  If those speakers are cheap enough, maybe you could just get a second set for some briefcase surround action.  That might prevent whatever feedback is occurring.   Edit:  maybe you could try it with everything powered OFF when connecting, then power ON and see if in sync.  That won't fix the poor audio though."

So always lusted after one of these for that 80's sound, got out-bid on ebay many times until one day I spotted this ex800 for sale. It was already modded by circuit benders in the UK but the price seemed a bit more than they generally go for. Screw it, I was about to move to the other side of the world and I was not about to let this one pass me by so I made sure I won it...  Synth arrived perfectly packaged a few days later, opened it to find it sat in its original box, full instructions and a note from the seller explaining which midi channel it was set to. Works perfectly so I emailed seller back to thank them for taking care to package and send so well. Turns out they owned it since 1984/5 and it was used as part of a popular synth rock  band back in the day. The Sisters of Mercy. So yeah, I bought a goth synth.  I've since reloaded it with new sounds and I am very happy with it. (also the Proteus1 underneath it, another 80's gem although more of a sound bank...)"
