OCD,3e6acd,ThrowawayPureeOCD,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:43:30 2015 UTC,Yes. Have you spoken with a doctor or a mental health professional? Meds and CBT helped me get out of the self destructive think cycle.

OCD,3e6acd,superpentil,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:20:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to give you reassurance, because that would validate this obsession. What you have is a doubt, there is no reason to respond to the doubt, you can leave it as an uncertainty. If you seek reassurance you are acting out a compulsive behaviour which you will feel compelled to repeat every time you experience this doubt."
OCD,3e6acd,JujuSpammer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:42:23 2015 UTC,"I found that keeping my mental health a secret added to the problem. When I told people they were understanding, supportive and it felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. Talking about things helps I found."
OCD,3e5q3n,OcdWa,2,Wed Jul 22 04:01:21 2015 UTC,It was 2.5 years ago. Right now you obsessing over a past compulsion. When that happens it's best to let the thoughts just past. And for the record I don't think you're a freak. Stuff like this happens to everyone.
OCD,3e5q3n,Kristouph,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:13:35 2015 UTC,"You're so obsessed with a past experience that you are deteriorating your standard of living in the present. Now is all that really matters, where you are and what you are doing in the present moment. You can't control the past, nor the future, only the present. You can live how you want to live right now, but it means accepting the memories that you have of the past with the knowledge that you cannot change what happened, you can only influence the present.   You have a problem right now, the way that you're living is not healthy and you clearly don't enjoy it. Stop worrying about what happened in the past, you have to focus on tackling your current issues. Just keep in mind that compulsive behaviours, that is all the unhealthy things that you do on a daily basis which are negatively impacting your mental health are all things that you can stop doing. You can learn to change your behaviour, to handle your thoughts and feelings in a different way that is healthy. It just takes commitment and practice, you must be willing to make and stick with those changes."
OCD,3e4ym1,WhatIf-WhatIf,3,Wed Jul 22 00:11:26 2015 UTC,"I've been using mindfulness as well and it's helped a lot but I still have bad days.  I tried something the other day I learned from Pema Chodron, I said to my fear 'come in and consume me.' Strangely, total non resistance made it disappear rather than get worse. Also, I try to let go of the idea of the future. Like I want to control to future to be sure everything going to be okay, but I can't control it so I say something like 'the future will be whatever it will be.' And it helps me let go of trying to control something that only exists as a fantasy in my mind at the moment.  Hope that helps a little."
OCD,3e4ym1,bluegerm,2,Wed Jul 22 00:39:40 2015 UTC,"It does, thank you! I do somethig similar, and it's been working. I was just taken aback last night when it suddenly wasn't."
OCD,3e4ym1,bluegerm,2,Wed Jul 22 00:51:02 2015 UTC,"I find to accept the emotions and try not to let them inspire thoughts in you is how I deal with it now. If a triggering thoughts comes, acknowledge as a triggering thought, choose to give it no more attention and put your awareness on your breathing.  I find counting my breaths helps me concentrate for longer and breaks the cycle.  Stay strong!"
OCD,3e4ym1,rhajii,3,Wed Jul 22 00:57:17 2015 UTC,"I had this kind of OCD cycle when I was younger; I was obsessively afraid that I wanted to kill my mother, which I followed up with a checking compulsion to pretend to commit the act. It was one of the most memorable and formidable cycles that I have dealt with in my life. Thankfully, like most of my cycles, it went away in time, perhaps replaced by a new one.  Sometimes, it's okay to surrender I think. Last night I was starting up with the obsessive thought that I had poked my cat's eye, and instead of addressing my obsession I just straight up went to bed. At times it feels cowardly, but we all know that our OCD isn't going away overnight, and this way I think one can save their energy for when they actually do need to fight back.  I guess that what I'm saying is that don't stress the tough days too much, that having the self-awareness to recognize them as such means you're doing at least that good. Much love and good luck."
OCD,3e4ym1,JujuSpammer,2,Wed Jul 22 02:21:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, you shouldn't be trying to get rid of the thoughts at all. That might be the problem here. What's important is that you're not responding to the thoughts through seeking reassurance. If you really understand them to be just thoughts with no real meaning, then you shouldn't even want to reduce them. You also don't want to try to reduce the unpleasant feelings that come with these thoughts, such as anxiety.   Wanting to get rid of these unpleasant thoughts or the feelings that come with them implies that they are somehow undesirable, and by struggling with them you actually give them more power over you."
OCD,3e69kc,count_olaf_lucafont,2,Wed Jul 22 07:32:43 2015 UTC,"The problem here is the behaviours that you deliberately engage in to reassure yourself that those memories aren't real. You say for yourself that you know when these things haven't actually happened, yet you feel compelled to try to be 100% certain of that. This is something that you're in control over, you can stop acting out these compulsions. It's not going to be easy, when you resist the urge to seek that reassurance you are going to feel very anxious. This is the normal response when someone refuses to carry out a compulsion, you have to accept this anxiety and persist with not doing the compulsive behaviour. It really is quite simple, but you need to practice it every time you experience these doubts."
OCD,3e69kc,JujuSpammer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:54:32 2015 UTC,"I've had this problem. Different false memories and obsessions but the same sort of thoughts. Cymbalta and CBT helped me. Also, the book 'Brain Lock' for OCD."
OCD,3e58r9,CleanJ3,2,Wed Jul 22 01:34:37 2015 UTC,"Don't try to break those associations. Understand that they exist in your mind and that you can't let them affect your behaviour. You can't avoid objects because you believe they are somehow contaminated, because avoiding is a compulsive behaviour. You need to expose yourself to them, and accept any unpleasant feelings that come with that. That's the key here, you're going to be anxious and uncomfortable because of the associations you have for those objects, but you're going to stay exposed to them and accept those unpleasant feelings without trying to get rid of them."
OCD,3e4frn,conufsedstudent,4,Tue Jul 21 21:47:00 2015 UTC,"This is real life and it's difficult. I don't know if you have ocd or not, you need a medical professional to diagnose you.  One thing I've found to help break obsessional thinking is conscious breathing. When you have a obsession sparking thoughts, you acknowledge it as a triggering thought, you decide to give that thought no attention and you put your awareness on your breath.  I've found personally counting my breaths for 30 or so seconds helps me from getting distracted by thoughts again. Hope this helps some."
OCD,3e4frn,bluegerm,4,Wed Jul 22 00:34:17 2015 UTC,"Having someone listen to you is not really going to help you in your situation. There are probably a lot of deliberate things that you do which are keeping you in this cycle, and you need someone who can identify these things and then assist you in cutting them out. I'd recommend speaking to a psychologist and being fully open with them about all of your symptoms, so they can properly diagnose you and work out proper treatment.   I also recommend you read The Happiness Trap by Russell Harris, it will help you to see your thoughts and feelings in a different way, and to stop struggling with them so much."
OCD,3e5sao,darthbarracuda,2,Wed Jul 22 04:21:13 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it dude. You're not stupid. It's just a gif, man. OCD is an asshole for making you feel this way. I've been convinced of far stupider things I assure you."
OCD,3e408m,TidalWaves89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:25 2015 UTC,"I have dermatillomania, (compulsive skin picking) and to be honest, that sounds like exactly what you are describing.  Even though the name includes ""skin picking"" it doesn't necessarily require a picking action.  It can often manifest as scratching, excessive exfoliation or other forms of skin damage.   You may want to check out r/calmhands for support or even x-post this question there.  Note that if you have OCD, dermatillomania often occurs comorbidly with OCD.    Don't be afraid to talk to both a psychiatrist and a dermatologist about this problem.  Five years is a LONG time to be suffering.  I know it can be embarrassing, but most dermatologists, and almost all psychiatrists understand this disorder and they can help you.    Just know that it's not your fault, there's no reason to be embarrassed; you just need some professional support."
OCD,3e2a6d,dogofthemilitary,3,Tue Jul 21 12:10:46 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you're talking about. There's a reason why OCD is called the ""doubting disease"".  I am a bit of a hypochondriac. But I'm also a hypochondriac about my hypochondria. Sometimes I think I have something serious, but then I wonder if I'm just being a hypochondriac about it. This includes my OCD. I get into a weird argument inside my head and it makes me feel really crazy.  In OCD, it's really common to have a bunch of intrusive ""what if""s. What if I'm exaggerating my OCD symptoms? What if everyone feels like I do, but everyone else is just better at dealing with it? What if, deep down, I just want to feel special or want attention? What if I actually have some kind of delusional disorder instead and I'm only imagining my OCD symptoms?  Of course, working with a good therapist has helped me learn how to challenge those intrusive ""what if""s. But it's perfectly normal (within the context of OCD) to have doubts, and those doubts can manifest in pretty much any area of your life including your OCD itself.  The other thing to keep in mind that the OCD is the disease, and the compulsions are just the way it presents itself. So basically, if for whatever reason you just didn't want to hand-wash, the disease would find some other outlet to express itself (until you get effective treatment). I had OCD from a relatively young age and I also have a high insight and a fair amount of knowledge of the basics. So it was kind of hard for the more common obsessions/compulsions to basically gain a hold in my mind (except for the worst one which started when I was a child). So my obsessions, doubts, and compulsions ended up being extremely complex in some cases."
OCD,3e2a6d,wizardcats,2,Wed Jul 22 02:16:55 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, receiving treatment from someone who specializes in things like this will be key.  Sharing your concerns with them and letting them tell you what they think of any possible diagnoses could be very helpful for you.  To answer your specific question: no, I always know I have OCD, even when my symptoms seem to disappear.  I'm sure there were times when I was younger that I noticed some symptoms diminishing and thought maybe they were going away altogether or that I had ""made it all up in my head"", but this was before I knew anything about the disease.  I understand now, after having been diagnosed ten years ago and dealing with this as far back as childhood, that my symptoms will come and go over time.  Sometimes they are so unbearable that I remain in bed all day, every day, for days at a time.  Sometimes they are so few that I am actually able to enjoy myself.  Even on the good days, I know they are still there and will present themselves again at some point.  I doubt myself on all levels, but not this one.  That's part of the debilitating horror of this beast, as I see it.  It might go away for a while, but it'll pop back up at some point."
OCD,3e2a6d,avoiding_the_crash,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:38 2015 UTC,"The way that I like to look at it is that OCD is something that you practice. If you respond to doubts by performing compulsive behaviours to seek certainty, then you have OCD. Of course, you can learn to stop doing these compulsive behaviours, this means accepting these doubts and not getting rid of them. If you look at ERP or other behavioural treatments for OCD, they all center around the concept of accepting uncertainty and not wanting to get rid of it.   Don't question whether or not you have OCD, ask yourself what behaviours you're engaging in when you're faced with obsessive thoughts and things that make you anxious. Focus on dealing with these things in a healthy way that doesn't require compulsive behaviours."

OCD,3e3ezn,andreiyo55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:32 2015 UTC,Why did you stop? And what is that?
OCD,3e3ezn,andreiyo55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:12 2015 UTC,"ERP=Exposure and Response prevention.  It's a technique used by teraphist's in treating OCD.It basically means that you take someones obsession/fear and make him do it without any compulsion.So in this case it would mean scratching one side without the other one.Anxiety will spike for a while and then calm down and this process teaches our brain that there is nothing to fear if we do not do our compulsions and so we can get treated.  It's alot deeper than this but I hope you can understand it.  You are supposed to do it with a teraphist as I have mentioned above,but if you are really fed up and don't afford/don't have a good one in your area you cand do ERP at home like me.It yields greats results but be careful of relapse.I was free of OCD for 1 month but then relapsed and am now planning on doing ERP again."

I am very proud of you for wanting to start this on your own, and for having the foresight to design a well thought out plan. My wife does ERP with a psychologist, and that is exactly the plan they are following. One thing is that she is cutting out compulsions WHILE doing exposure therapy. So, she has to expose herself to her feared items/things/places (that is one half of the assignment), and she is also assigned a few compulsions to cut out each week (the other half of her weekly ""homework""). She suffers very severely from OCD so this process will take a long while, but it seems to be working effectively, even though it is slow-going for her. Her psychologist wants her to work on ERP for 3 hours a day (1 hour in the morning, afternoon, and evening) -- that might be a lot for you, or you might have time for that much work since you are on summer vacation.   In any case, that is a great plan you have there, and I wish you all the best. Please keep us updated on your progress and success!  Edited for clarity."

One book that really helped me when I was starting my recovery was The Happiness Trap by Russell Harris. The book is closely tied to acceptance and commitment therapy, which is known to be very effective for helping OCD sufferers.

Sometimes an event or stress triggers it, and sometimes it seems to come out of nowhere.

OCD,3dxrjx,Tristopolis,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:56 2015 UTC,"Hello!  I got a couple of questions.  During my own treatment, I had to conduct research by pulling together meta-studies that linked OCD to abnormalities to glutamate activity, as serotonergics proved to be ineffective or worsen my OCD symptoms.  With strong NMDA-Glutamate antagonists, such as Rilutek, it gave significant, and near instant relief.  However, given the ""dirtiness"" of the medication, I began to suffer from numerous liver issues.  I was wondering what research your team has done linking glutamate activating to OCD?  And, if any more selective/specialized glutamate antagonists are being created for OCD treatment?  With the controversy on SSRI treatment, being that a large percentage of OCD sufferers do not receive significant relief within 2 months of SSRI use, why is serotonin still ruled as the most contributing neurochemical to the disorder/first line of treatment?  Research has been done on Ketamine showing near instant relief in OCD patients.  Has your team conducted any research/success in creating a ketamine alternative, mimicking it's success but not it's horrific long term side-effects?  Thanks for your time!  It's great that you guys have taken the time out of your day to answer some questions within the community."

Eventually, the urge to do those same antics fades.  Occasionally they rear their ugly head but I feel more prepared.  As for CBT, I can't say for sure but the precepts look similar to those that mindfulness is ingrained in, so I don't see why it may not at least alleviate it a bit."

It's actually quite a simply cycle, you have some uncertainty that you then try to answer, this gives you temporary relief from doubt but down the line further doubts spring up.   So the solution isn't to answer these questions, and it isn't to stop them from presenting themselves, it is to accept the uncertainty they create without trying to get rid of it. Contrary to what many people think, the main problem with OCD is the deliberate actions you perform, not the presence of doubts inside your head."

What we have is more common than people know and from personal experience is definitely treatable."
OCD,3dz8er,Darth__Nader,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:15:48 2015 UTC,"I have been diagnosed with OCD and this is one symptom I have had as long as I can remember (although my boyfriend said he has issues with symmetry and he does not have OCD). If it's really concerning you or those that love you, then it is definitely is something worth looking into with a therapist or your general practitioner.  The way for things to get better is to not give into the compulsion of ""evening things out"". Most OCD therapies work at this with exposure and response therapy (ERP) by building up your tolerance little by little. Force yourself to do something asymmetrical and then sit with the discomfort. Then do it again and again. Eventually it will become less bothersome and the desire to have things be symmetrical will lessen. Yeah, easier said then done.  You're not alone. You are not ""weird"", nor should you feel embarrassed. If it's distressing you, seek help."
OCD,3dz8er,_Pumpernickel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:02:16 2015 UTC,"I've had the same (like, exact) problems since I was ~7. I'm 24 now. I still get these feelings, but less often/intense now, probably because I'm on antidepressants. I have ADHD/anxiety too, and maybe they're all connected, but I think it's mainly an OCD thing. I don't know how ""mild"" it is, though. It used to really freak me out. That doesn't sound like mildly infuriating asymmetry to me, it sounds like OCD."
OCD,3dz8er,ohmyerica,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:46:06 2015 UTC,"This is one of the major ways OCD manifests in me, as well.  It's terribly difficult to try to explain this one to people as, at least in my experience, they see it as ""quirky"" or even annoying.  They have no idea the mental anguish that comes along with not being able to even yourself out in that moment.  It had gotten so bad for me at one point that I was just staying in bed because I couldn't navigate my house (or my life!!) without having to constantly even myself out.  I couldn't even drive for a while because I would have to find the symmetry even in that task:  If my right tires hit a reflector, rock, stick, etc, my left tire would have to do the same.  I was swerving in lanes and knew at that point that this had moved beyond ""quirky"" and into dangerous territory.  This, I have found, is one behavior that exposure therapy works great for. If you can convince yourself to sit in that disgustingly unsettling feeling for a while and NOT even yourself out, it WILL get better.  These symmetry behaviors used to be my worst, now they are the smallest ones I deal with.  Just knowing and really believing that the feeling that comes with not even-ing yourself out WILL pass eventually is key.  I'm sorry you're going through this.  You are NOT weird.  It WILL get better if you choose to work on it."

Now if you start using a child sexually, and whatever damage to the way they perceive relationships and feel trust that entails, I'd be thinking of a bit fouler.   Still, you fell for a 17 year old that showed you a lot of support, and developed a bond with. That in no way appears strange to me: I'd find it more curious if you didn't."

This is called the ironic process, where trying to get rid of something that is in your head actually makes that thing present even more. That's because by trying to get rid of that thought, your brain is actually searching for the presence of that thought to see if it is there. You must see the irony here."

OCD,3dxcl2,caughtunaware,0,Mon Jul 20 12:53:33 2015 UTC,"OCD is an anxiety disorder. I'm not a specialist, but if you don't care at all the thoughts popping into your head, it may not be OCD. My OCD is mostly obsessive thoughts. For example paralyzing fear my little boy will get hurt or being convinced I've committed fraud but I can't remember how, just scared I'm going to get caught. Occasionally my thoughts spill into routines, but the routines only exist to try and quell the scary thoughts I've been having. Like lying in bed at night unable to sleep because I'm convincing myself I've hit someone with my car becomes checking the car for signs I've hit someone, which can become retracing my route to make sure I didn't do anything wrong. I know I haven't hit anyone, surely I'd remember something as HUGE as this, but why can't I shake this feeling? It's like a doubting disease. You may constantly question and doubt yourself. Rule of thumb. If you've not been diagnosed with OCD, you don't have OCD. My advice to you would be to see a specialist, you might have an anxiety disorder or you may just have intrusive thoughts that are completely common and normal and most people get them from time to time without having any sort of mental illness. I can see many other people have recommended books and meditation to you and there's very little I can add to what has been previously suggested apart from speaking to a professional. Good luck to you! I occasionally get songs stuck in my head, they'll be there for hours. Originally a coping mechanism but occasionally a complete nuisance so I wish you all the best in clearing your mind.."

There is nothing wrong with being anxious, and you don't want to try to get rid of your anxiety.   All of those what if questions are uncertainties that you have in your head. It's fine to have these as well, as long as you respond to them in the right way. You can accept these doubts without looking for reassurance. When you start to seek reassurance you are responding to these doubts through compulsive behaviour, and that's when problems begin to arise. When one of these questions pops up, accept the uncertainty that it creates in your mind and don't try to get rid of it. You might then feel an urge to seek reassurance in some way, it's important that you resist that urge, and accept the discomfort that comes with that."

What separates lust from being unfaithful behavior is whether you act on it or not, which you didn't. Eye contact is kinda on the edge, but I think the crime would've occurred if you had initiated something with the lady.  If you want to tell your girlfriend, then that's cool. Either way I would try to not be so hard on yourself, tho not an easy thing. If I were you, I think the best option would be to be totally honest with her and share your thoughts and feelings like you did in your post.

One thing I've mentioned to my therapist is that when I have lingering guilt like this over something completely innocuous, I remind myself that this is just one of my obsessions and the feeling would likely soon pass.  If I still felt the same in a day or two, then I'd talk with my wife about it."
OCD,3duxzp,sonder-n-vivid,2,Sun Jul 19 18:49:57 2015 UTC,"Had that for a while, an especially bad episode a year or so ago. Now it's worth noting that I do have family members with schizophrenia, have slight hallucinations, and have had very rare transient moments of delusion, also my thinking is generally a mess; though like you I have a diagnosis of derealization disorder, and chaotic, fragmented thinking seems pretty common among folks with that diagnosis. So, I suppose I am not entirely not insane.   For me it was mostly a fear of ending up like my uncle and aunt; one a junky, probably in some desperate attempt to self medicate and reduce suffering, and partially because being high must be pretty great, who is all out bonkers, to say it as it comes in my mind; constant voices, bizarre delusions (being the president, going to heaven, speaking to his dead parents), paranoia (my brother lives in his head and constantly tortures him there) and then there is my aunt, a functional woman by all means: family, job, good money, and even some (international) fame. She's a medium, she's all into the occult; does readings, rituals, all that stuff. Luckily for her; having these types of ideas is common enough to make a pretty good living.   Anyway, so my fear stems from that; my uncles life is no good and I wouldn't wish upon the worst of them out there, my aunt's alright; she just creeps me out with all her weird ideas and awkward, and somewhat strange air. So I wouldn't want to be like them. Naturally; when I started figuring out I had similar experiences; short bouts of paranoia (I was driving without a license for a while, I for a short moment wondered if people knew if they looked at me), seeing things that are not there (papers falling out of my violin study book, then being there again a fragment of a second later), that kind of stuff. I had had these things for a long time, and it has never really caused me problems, however upon figuring out that this was kind of like what my uncle and aunt had, I freaked out proper. I was thinking about it constantly; questioning every little experience, even the ones entirely sane, then denying these experiences again, comforting myself I was fine; googling endlessly in a hope to either find a way to control it, by being sure and getting appropriate help, or finding that piece of information that could comfort me and assure me I was fine. That went on for a good few months. I spend whole days thinking and googling, and feeling absolutely miserable (""perhaps this is normal"", ""a psychotic person would think that too"", ""perhaps the fact that I worry about this is so irrational that it is crazy"", SIGH ""This person on the internet experiences this too, he seems to be fine"", etc, etc.). I still functioned along side of it, still worked, all that stuff, but it was no fun. After a while I decided to go on meds; citalopram, indeed prescribed for OCD like tendencies I was displaying. It went away. I was able to give it a place, it allowed me to look at it with more distance. I had had fears like a ton of times before, but then about health; heart attacks, auto-immune disease, that sort of stuff. My therapist also assured me I was not psychotic. Now a year later; I am starting to realize there is indeed some truth to it. My old psychotherapist could not know that though, it's not a huge issue, so I never spoke of the symptoms I was having, so it must have appeared like a purely irrational fear. My current psychotherapist knows, but these issues are so insignificant that they do are not at a level where she would diagnose me with a psychotic syndrome. So, in the end it turned out; my neurotically driven obsessions were the big issue, but I wasn't entirely wrong at the time either.   So all I can say, I suppose, on basis of sample-size 1: I reckon you are mostly just really scared right now, and that must not be doing you all that much good. I also doubt thinking about this further is going to get you anywhere: you are very afraid, so even if you are fine you are going to have a hard time believing it. Also: you are very afraid, if you're bonkers, you're likely too scared of it to be able to admit it to yourself. So if it's possible; practice some self control and try to not get stuck into constantly think about it. You really shouldn't. You are not in direct danger. If you're fine (in the sense of not being crazy, not in the sense of being absolutely fearful), you're fine. If not, you've probably not been for a longer while, not much is going to directly change. With that; get to the second step, get some outside help because, for your heavy emotional investment, and probably poor understanding of the psyche, you're not going to figure this out by yourself. You can get some help for your worrying, and if there's more to it, and it's significant enough to be a problem in and of itself; for that too."
OCD,3duxzp,VideoSpellen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:51 2015 UTC,"I was in the same exact situation several months ago and it was absolutely horrible. However, I can assure you you're not going insane, it's just the OCD making you think you are because of that constant fear 24/7. OCD latches on to your greatest fears, so it's not unusual that it would challenge something as significant as reality. I would suggest seeing a psychiatrist and possibly getting on medication, but I also recommend meditation because it allows you to see the thoughts as the mental noise they really are. Through meditation, you are put face to face with the thoughts (which can be really scary at first), but eventually you will learn to just let them come and go."
OCD,3duxzp,clandestine_carrot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"Hey, you're stuck in a loop. Those what-ifs keep coming back because you keep knocking them down, you're playing OCD whack-a-mole. The problem with wanting to get rid of doubts is that your brain is always going to give you more doubts in the future. You can keep trying to get rid of them, but that will mean doing the same thing over and over, and it's not surprising that that is making you feel insane.   The way out of this is to stop playing the game, stop trying to get rid of uncertainty by seeking reassurance. When you have some doubt, you can accept it and not respond to it, you don't have to be sure about what outcomes may arise. You can see for yourself just how problematic seeking reassurance is for you, so you know that you need to address this issue. This isn't easy though, when you're so used to doing compulsive behaviours and seeking that temporary relief from doubt and anxiety, stopping those behaviours can make you very uncomfortable. This is a barrier that you have to jump if you want to cut out these problematic behaviours, and that means accepting the discomfort and anxiety that comes with not engaging in compulsive behaviours to get rid of doubts.   I recommend that you look up exposure and response prevention, read about that and you'll begin to understand how to combat this issue that you're facing."

What you need to be mindful of however is your behaviour in social situations. You can't use these experiences as an excuse to avoid social situations, that will further re-enforce the fear and probably make your anxiety even higher. You want to keep getting out there and exposing yourself to social situations, and just feeling whatever you feel when you're there.   You also want to stop ruminating over your social experiences after they have happened, that's definitely a compulsive behaviour here. After a particular social interaction you might get a lot of doubts about what you may have said or done, and it's tempting to review it in your head because you want to be sure, but it's not very healthy and it's continuing your social anxiety problems."

Are the organization patterns caused by something making you anxious, or is it the fact that they're not organized?  Usually it isn't just, ""this isn't straight and that makes me uncomfortable,"" but more like, ""oh no, what if someone comes to visit and my room is a mess? If my room is a mess they may think I'm dirty and unorganized. Nobody wants to hangout in a pig stye. What if they never want to be around me because I'm dirty? They'll hate me and I'll never have friends. I have to clean this up. It's midnight, though. Well, they may show up in the middle of the night because of an emergency. The earlier the better. I need to clean this so they don't hate me.""  There is a type of personality type that refers to organization, but it isn't necessarily OCD. (I don't remember what it's called though.) Also, this is just how OCD manifests in myself, it could be different for you.  I'm my experience I've seen that compulsion comes after obsession. The obsession makes you anxious, so you preform some sort of action to fix what's making you anxious. In other cases people obsess, but without a following action. I'm your case it feels like pure compulsion, but I don't know where your anxiety lies.  I can't tell what makes you anxious here, or whether you just like being organized.  Is it interfering with your life?   Anyway, that's just my thought process, but really. If you think it's bothering you, go see a doctor. It'll help a lot.  I hope this helps.

To me, it sounds like this issue is causing you distress. Again, check it out if you believe it's serious.   No matter what happens though, don't let OCD define you. It can be great to acknowledge it's there and have a better understanding of yourself, but never let yourself be a certain way because of the title. Do your best to relax about the situation and rationalize your worries. People won't care about a little mess and it's up to you whether you want it clean. I feel like blaming the situation on OCD May fuel the behavior, as if you can't help it. I don't want that to make you feel helpless. You can change this.

Do you find that this happens more when you are feeling anxious?"

OCD,3dsem5,theOCDthrowaway,4,Sun Jul 19 00:25:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, simply because allowing certain rituals can (and often) leads to more rituals.  For example, my OCD developed like this: Don't stand on my bed and don't let the cat walk on the bed -> no eating by sleeping areas -> touching the cat means washing hands -> touching anything I don't feel comfortable with means washing hands -> anything I cannot verify as clean should be treated as if dirty.  It wasn't instantaneous, and it developed naturally along the lines of ""Oh, maybe other people have cats and they used this door handle. Well then, it makes sense to wash my hands since I usually wash my hands after I touch a cat."" That seemingly rational (not really) conclusion now has effectively caused a stricter adherence to a ritual.  Long story short, go see someone and take a proactive approach to dealing with these issues."
OCD,3dsem5,import_social-wit,3,Sun Jul 19 01:09:18 2015 UTC,"I thought I managed it.  Right up until my wife almost left me, I became useless at my job because all I was doing was seeking reassurance, I was unable to care for my son and I was generally incapable of enjoying the things I had worked to obtain.  So yeah, you can ""think you manage it"" all you want.  I thought so too.    Get help."
OCD,3dsem5,anon0108,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:41:58 2015 UTC,"I think that you'll find if you do get treatment you will have a lot more time :)   I've noticed some people have adopted OCD as part of their personality and don't necessarily feel the need to change.  If you feel that you have it under control, and that you are closely monitoring your behavior to ensure it doesn't develop into something more extreme, you may be okay.  However, if these rituals come with a great deal of stress/anxiety I would suggest you seek treatment for the sake of your overall health."
OCD,3dsem5,pumpka-boo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:35:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, you should get treatment. Compulsive behaviours suck and you don't want to keep doing them for the rest of your life. OCD isn't who you are, it's not something that you want to accept into your life. If it wasn't so bad it wouldn't be classed as a mental illness. You've described a handful of compulsive behaviours and if you begin treatment then you can start cutting them out. I can assure you that you'll enjoy your life much more once you do start getting rid of them."

I have OCD, and I will push events back until the 'perfect' moment to start them, and this results in many things taking months for me to start, and some do not get started at all. That is one of my OCD tendencies. For that point I can say, yes that is an obsessive compulsion. You obsess over the perfect moment to do something, so the compulsion is to push the start date back."

OCD,3dposg,AlfonzoTheGardener,3,Sat Jul 18 06:15:55 2015 UTC,"Looking up symptoms is a common OCD compulsion. Sometimes you'll have a thought that you have a certain illness and then you'll want to get rid of that uncertainty by trying to convince yourself that you're fine. You'll probably feel quite anxious because the thought of being ill is quite bothersome.   One thing I've noticed is that when you have a thought that you have some sickness, you start becoming very aware of little things that your body does, and you begin to see those as signs that you are actually sick. Every little movement in your body, little aches and whatnot, this can make you think that there is actually something wrong. This is actually a classic bias, the reason you're drawing this correlation is because of the obsessive thought in your head."
OCD,3do4vo,ComN9,10,Fri Jul 17 21:26:23 2015 UTC,"The best way to win is to not argue... which sounds way simpler than it is.

""This is not a rational thought and it doesn't deserve my attention"" ""This is an ocd thought"" ""This thought is about the fear of the unknown, not whatever it's manifesting as""  Start with this is an ocd thought and then make your own, its helped me a lot."

Wanting to get rid of doubts is the driving force behind compulsive behaviours.   The answer is to accept those doubts instead, to let yourself be uncertain and not pursue the questions any further. If you always look to be certain, you will find more doubts that you feel the need to eradicate, and thus you will keep going on in circles. The entire mindset of always wanting to be sure about everything needs to change towards accepting doubts and uncertainty."

You let the feelings associated hit you like a wave at the beach. Then you walk away."
OCD,3do4vo,pepper_tea,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:26:41 2015 UTC,"It depends on the type of thought: I tell myself that because I am feeling anxiety, then that means the troubling thoughts/feelings aren't my ""true"" ones.  If I truly felt that way, I would not feel anxious about it.  If it's the fear of something bad happening, I try to accept the fear without arguing with it.

OCD,3dktog,bandofromans,4,Fri Jul 17 02:08:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds like reassurance seeking to me. Here's the thing, OCD is really something that you practice. It's not some bug that is in your brain that makes you act in a certain way. OCD is just a way of responding to uncertainty by doing compulsive behaviours to try to get rid of that uncertainty. This kind of behaviour can become very prevalent to the point where it dominates someone's life, and that person is then said to have OCD.  You know that you have to accept those sexual thoughts you have, along with any other feelings that come with them. If you have a groinal response, then that's just something that happened, you don't need to analyse it."
OCD,3dktog,JujuSpammer,2,Fri Jul 17 06:11:33 2015 UTC,"My husband had said he's gotten weird boners before, ie, looking at an open oven.

Whichever is the easier one to eliminate, I then compare to another compulsion on the list, and I keep going until I've got all of the compulsions that are easiest to cut out, clearly ranked in order.

Having obsessive thoughts is a bit different, like a voice in your head that you can't get rid of or ignore. This voice will lead to compulsive acts to try to quiet it down, but the compulsive acts just feed into the obsessive thoughts creating a sort of feed back loop in your head. I guess what I mean to say it sounds like you are stressed out and you should talk to a counselor about your ASD, social and academic pressures, and why computer animation is an anxiety trigger for you."
OCD,3diyw7,eatenbybricks,3,Thu Jul 16 18:32:33 2015 UTC,"It's funny because around that time when I was younger, I was having thoughts that I couldn't quiet down such as ""am I folding my hands the wrong way?"" Or ""am I being too obsessive?"". But this was mainly triggered by that computer animation thing and also when my mom said I was acting ""obsessive"" so I was more self conscious of what I was doing. So it may be due to worry about social interactions and stuff. Eventually they did quiet down. And I knew in my mind that what triggered my anxiety wasn't a big deal. I was more worried about what I looked like to others and the anxiety itself than the animation."

OCD,3dghqp,wildwolfway,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:51:38 2015 UTC,Well my first piece of advice would be to ask your parents to sit and talk because something has been bothering you; tell them that you feel different. Self diagnosis of OCD can only make you stress more because you truly do not know what is going on. You know you feel different and have different thought patterns and actions and now you are looking to get an answer. If your parents are working and you are worried about financial assistance ask if they have an EAP; Employee Assistance Program. This program makes is something provided by some employers and it is free to the employee and family. Take a deep breath and know that you are not alone.

OCD,3dfjqz,Crossbows,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:45:32 2015 UTC,"The treatment for OCD is to not follow through with any compulsions. So if you get a thought like ""Oh I find this guy attractive, maybe I'm gay"" you can't really control this. It's a thought in your head, and that's how it is. But if you get an urge to react to it ""Am I gay? I should look at him more, or look at pictures of girls, to make sure I'm not..."" then you need to resist. Analyzing is a compulsion as well.   So as long as you accept the thoughts, and do not react to them (don't avoid them either, that is also a reaction! Let the thoughts ""float"" in your brain, don't do anything with them) your OCD will begin clearing up. You'll get less obsessive thoughts, and you'll hopefully be in the habit of not caring about them anyways. I've never heard of OCD going away completely, but it gets to the point where it really is not a problem anymore.  As far as how long it takes... that is really dependent on the person. For me, as I got better with this therapy, the time got less and less. It used to be months, then weeks, now it's like... an hour or less. What happens is you sort of tend to let your guard down when your disorder fades... so it ends up coming back. It's important to constantly practice this therapy. If it hasn't been mentioned already, if you have anymore problems with this, get yourself a good OCD specialist to teach you all this therapy."

OCD,3ddc2p,AquaVersus,3,Wed Jul 15 11:23:13 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear that you are having a rough go of it. Have you ever talked to a therapist before?
OCD,3ddc2p,OCDKing,3,Wed Jul 15 15:48:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying. I've been in and out of therapy for most of my life, but never for anything like this (usually anxiety and depression). I've calmed down now after I ate and forced myself to get some work done, but I'm worried how I'll feel later on.  I mostly feel pathetic for feeling the need to waste my money like this, and very self-deprecating over the whole thing in general. Is that common?"
OCD,3ddc2p,HardwareDisease,3,Wed Jul 15 16:44:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, guilt and shame are a big part of OCD - see here - and can be major reasons why people typically wait so long to get help.  If you're currently seeing a therapist, bring it up. The best way to tackle OCD is head on, with exposure and response prevention, but this can be tough to do on your own."
OCD,3ddc2p,Klib,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:27:22 2015 UTC,"Therapy for OCD is quite different than typical psychotherapy for depression. It's worth bringing up your concerns to your doctor or therapist, trust me.  It's definitely common to feel that way about it. I left therapy twice because I felt too guilty spending my parents' money on it. But it's worth it. It's the treatment you need to get on with your life, and you can't put a price on that."
OCD,3ddc2p,JujuSpammer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:23:14 2015 UTC,"That's called a compulsive behaviour, you do it despite knowing that you don't really want to be doing it. These behaviours can be really hard to stop, that's why you need to get help from a professional. OCD can be treated, it's mostly changing the way you behave everyday and changing how you interact with your thoughts and feelings."
OCD,3dcv96,JujuSpammer,5,Wed Jul 15 07:29:20 2015 UTC,"The way to overcome this isn't to work out a way to stop having those unpleasant thoughts. That's been your strategy up until now and obviously it hasn't worked. The solution is actually the opposite, you need to accept that these thoughts exist in your head, without wanting to get rid of them.  Now accepting these thoughts doesn't mean holding their content to be true. You're not accepting that you are actually a pedophile, you're simply accepting that some of your thoughts suggest that you may be a pedophile. These are two very different things.   Ultimately, you know what you are and aren't attracted to. Even if you were attracted to children, it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't act out on it. What you need to do is to stop fighting with your thoughts, stop trying to make them go away. Also, stop looking for reassurance that you aren't a pedophile, if you do then you are responding to these thoughts by trying to eliminate the uncertainty that they create. Remember, they're just in your head, they don't have to mean anything and you don't even have to do anything about them, just let them be."
OCD,3dcv96,iamaguyhere,3,Wed Jul 15 08:50:18 2015 UTC,"Fellow sufferer here. I have POCD and its the worst. Though I can honestly say that I'm at a point where I feel happy and feel in control when in an episode.   First of all (as I kinda skim read this, sorry) of you're not seeing a therapist, please do. They don't judge at all in any way, POCD is ridiculously common in the spectrum of OCD obsessions. I can remember feeling like (and still sometimes do) that I'm completely alone in this, trust me when I say though that you aren't.   First of all, everyone may say ""just don't engage with the thoughts"" which is obviously the general outcome but at your stage I think that might be quite hard to fathom, so instead, I want you to start recognizing your thoughts. It took me a while to identify what I was actually thinking. Yes, you see a trigger and get anxious, but during that feeling of anxiety, there must be a thought you are having to cause that and that for me took me a while to identify but I managed to identify them eventually. For me for example, I have two thoughts after seeing a trigger; ""what if I'm aroused?"" and ""what if I get an erection?"" (I'm a male). I think really narrowing down what the thoughts you are thinking is a good starting point.   You do however need to see a therapist as there can be other circumstances in your life that can be a factor to your obsession. I find obsessions do have a meaning (note, NOT saying they are true) but for me for example, I discovered the reason for my POCD was due to the fact I had trouble accepting my self as gay and was really badly closeted and thus, for me anyway, part of my recovery from POCD involves coming out. For you, it could be something different, maybe not even related to sexuality but this can only really be made effectively apparent with the help of your therapist.   In the mean time however, I recommend doing positive activities you love, which will also help your depression (as I am sure you are aware of). Like depression, OCD feeds off of you not doing what you want. I do get negative thoughts like ""I don't deserve happiness because of my thoughts"" etc but I realized that these were a product of OCD not me.   It can also help to remember two things; 1. Remembering the emotional cycle, it's impossible to feel one feeling forever, like biologically impossible, so remember in an episode next time that this will end eventually. 2. Recognize your cognitive distortions. ( I would give a link but I'm on my phone right now but you can easily Google them) they can also be known as unhealthy thinking types. You may think they don't apply straight away as you may think that because of your thoughts they don't apply, but they do. I guarantee that in an episode you're doing at least one of those things. How this helps me is that the realization that I'm doing those cognitive distortions reminds me that this is OCD making me think this way and this can help in separating your thoughts, or at least offer a start.   If you feel you can, you can also try setting a time and place to worry, this is what my therapist offered me when I first started and it really helped in giving me perspective on my thoughts. Set a half an hour period in the day to allow yourself to ruminate but only in that period. You can only ruminate in this period so when you get triggered next time, NO MATTER WHAT, say to yourself ""no I will worry about that at worry time"". I found that by worry time, I had already forgotten about worrying about what triggered me and it made me realize the true importance of the thoughts, which is that they aren't at all.   I hope some of this helps. Please please please remember you're not a bad person.  Also apologies for any grammar mistakes as I'm on my phone."

I made a post you can read, but it'll probably just add to more of your anxiety. I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I'm struggling to cope, but seeing a therapist and trying not to avoid public situations. I've delt with other obsessions in the past and they usually all run their course. I hope this one will too. I also hope that things will turn around for you. Ocd is one terrible b****."
OCD,3dcv96,spacegooober,3,Wed Jul 15 13:49:53 2015 UTC,"This all sounds very familiar to me.  People have written a lot of stuff which is pretty good already so I'll try to say something different.    Really the problem I found was there is a difference between what your rational mind knows is true and what you believe is true.  It's like ""belief"" happens in a different part of the brain.  All this is happening because the two parts of your mind are fighting each other.  But the paradoxical part is, and the bit that makes it such a bitch to get rid of, is the belief part gets stronger the more you think about, even fighting it is making it a lot stronger.  The thing is not fighting the thoughts is almost impossible to do without a trick.  For me the change all came when I eventually realised spending the rest of my life in fear would just be completely unbearable.  It would be even worse than the worst things I was imagining in my head would happen.  Living the rest of my life like this would be worse than death even.  So I just stopped giving a fuck and I stopped fighting those thoughts.  Whenever they appeared I shut down my instinct to recoil and said fuck it I not only will I not fight them but I will encourage them.  So whenever they appeared in my head I would tell myself ""yes this is true, fuck it bring it on I don't give a shit, BRING IT ON GOD DAMMIT!!!"", no matter how horrible it is it will not be as bad as living the rest of my life in like this.  So I actually tried as hard as I could to believe these things would happen, and I genuinely no longer gave a shit.  Eventually you may come to the same realisation, and if you do the following will probably happen.  At first you will sit there saying to yourself ""bring it on, fuck it I don't care"" waiting for your mind to be filled with these awful thoughts and your true paedophile nature to come through. But it won't happen straight away, so you will have to wait some more.  Since you aren't fighting with yourself you will get bored and go get something to eat while you wait for your worst fears to come true. But it still won't happen so you will be like ""listen inner horrible pedo self, I've given you free reign to take control and turn me into my worst nightmare, but since you're taking your sweet ass time, I've got some bills to pay and some shopping to do, so while you get your shit together I'm going to go take care of this stuff"".  And so it will continue, and you'll think about it less and less because your inner pedo self clearly has a mind of its own and will take over when it's ready.  And pretty soon it will be a year later and you will realise you haven't even thought about it in 6 months.  The key is though you have to genuinely not care if these things become true.  If you are just trying to trick yourself into thinking you don't care cause you really want them to go away because you actually do care, then it won't work."
OCD,3dcv96,pepper_tea,2,Wed Jul 15 16:17:03 2015 UTC,"I have wavering HOCD and I say just accept the thoughts. Say, for myself, I say well I could be gay and that's ok. I accept the thoughts.

OCD,3dbx7l,Klib,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:26:18 2015 UTC,"Hey, we've all had bad stretches like that. The important thing is that you were smart and proactive and you are on medication and feeling better. Remember to stay on the medication, because going off of it on your own, without supervision from a doctor, can make things even worse.  Of course, medication is the absolute cure. It takes a lot of work. But just writing this shows that you're willing to put it in. Keep at it!"

When you're stuck in a loop of obsessions and compulsions it can be really hard to pick yourself up and make progress towards recovering, but you have to consciously pursue that, knowing that improving your health depends on your own actions.   It's great that you're going to do CBT, medication on its own doesn't do much for improving your symptoms in the long term. You're going to learn how to change the way you behave and how you respond to thoughts and feelings, and that's more helpful and sustainable."
OCD,3dbykh,reptasmic,4,Wed Jul 15 02:08:42 2015 UTC,"Hey reptasmic- I think learning you have a major health issue is reason enough for anybody to start a pity-party, let alone a third chronic illness.  I also have OCD and depression, but the good news for you is that they both can be quite treatable.  However, get into therapy ASAP.  SSRIs alone are rarely a winning bet when it comes to OCD.  You're lucky you got diagnosed early (so look at it that way) and the sooner you start treating your illness the sooner it gets better."
OCD,3dbykh,carmen_san_diego1,3,Wed Jul 15 03:05:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, guess what, OCD is treatable. There are certain behaviours that you engage in which continue the unhealthy cycle of obsessions and compulsions, but you can learn to stop these behaviours. OCD doesn't mean that there's something wrong with your brain, there is actually nothing wrong with having recurring unpleasant thoughts, they are just things in your head. Recovering from OCD is about changing the way that you respond to these things in your head, and that is through your actions.   Medication is going to help you feel better, but I'd recommend behavioural therapy because that's more effective in the long term. Speak to your doctor about this, you can start learning to beat OCD right away."

I know how it feels to be in this position, where you have a lot of thoughts to let out but no specific thing to focus on. It might be worth joining the chat and talking more directly.  Either way, you've made a good step. It sucks to find out you've got something serious, but you aren't broken. You'll make it through this, find ways to cope, and end up stronger than before."

Maybe you're overanalysing this and there's nothing actually wrong with your brain at all?  I can't see why your brain would start to function differently unless it is due to some serious medical issue. If you do have OCD, then it's likely that this is just some obsessive fear that has become prominent because you have thought about it a lot and responded to it by performing numerous compulsive behaviours. You're using some pretty advanced terminology so obviously you've done some research about this, that could actually have been you seeking reassurance or trying to understand the whole situation."

You might feel stupid because it seems so simple to stop doing these behaviours but you just can't succeed in that, but that's what makes OCD a serious condition. You don't have to feel bad about it, you know you have a problem and you want to improve on it, so you're already on the right track.  Have you ever done any behavioural therapy? Exposure and response prevention is a proven effective treatment for OCD patients, it teaches you how to go about stopping compulsive behaviours, such as skin picking. I'd strongly recommend it to you."

OCD,3d7rui,petbedballet,5,Tue Jul 14 04:25:17 2015 UTC,"Are you seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist? These thoughts definitely remind me of my OCD. The inability to not think about something, no matter how hard you try. The anxiety and anger you feel in the morning when you remember it again, after those blissful few seconds of forgetting. My obsessions are different from yours but it takes a similar form.  I also relate to it getting worse when you have less to distract you. Not having school and/or work to occupy your mind make it incredibly hard NOT to focus on the obsession.  As for beating this thing, there's a lot of advice I'd give. I'd like you to take a look at the subreddit wiki, as it has a lot of the basic stuff like different types of therapy, seeking treatment, etc.  I'm by no means cured, but I'm in a better place than I was a year ago. Personally, the way I've started to overcome it is through a mix of medication and vigilance. Medication has definitely been a life-saver for me, as this isn't something that it's easy to set up exposure exercises for. But you need to work on accepting the thoughts and not trying to fight them. If you keep wanting to not think something, your mind will constantly be checking to see if you're thinking about it, and in turn you'll think about it. Break that cycle. Easier said than done, I know.  I definitely recommend you look into treatment if you haven't already. You don't have to fight this alone."

Professional therapy, if you're invested in overcoming your obsessions and comfortable with your therapist, will only help you. It's worth seeing a psychiatrist for a diagnosis and to go from there, if you have the means."
OCD,3d7rui,MissMamanda,2,Tue Jul 14 04:47:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Therapy and medication has worked for me very well. I don't have thoughts that are violent like that, but I do have the constant repetitive thoughts that don't stop no matter how hard you try. Therapist calls this ruminating thoughts.

OCD,3d7rui,JujuSpammer,2,Tue Jul 14 07:54:28 2015 UTC,"You have to understand that as unpleasant as these thoughts may be, they're just in your head. That's the only place that they exist. Your problem is caused by wanting to get rid of these thoughts. If you try to get rid of an unpleasant image in your head, you won't succeed, that image will keep coming back. By actually trying to get rid of it you are giving it your attention and making it even more prominent.   What you need to practice is not responding to these thoughts and images. If you do some deliberate action when you experience these thoughts, you need to stop that. That's called a compulsive behaviour. You shouldn't try to get rid of these thoughts or make them stop happening, because you can't actually do that. You can't control what thoughts are in your head, they come and go on their own."

And I say ""gray, boring, nothing"" quietly to myself over and over, trying to acknowledge the meaning of each word briefly. And even when the awful thoughts try to creep back in, I remind myself, ""Doesn't matter; gray, boring, nothing.""   Every split-second I am able to think of nothing is time spent not thinking awful thoughts.

This was one of the tougher ones to make go away.  I kind of just wrote a long one here on a different type, but the solution was the same.  The trick is to just stop worrying about it.  I know in the state you are in right now you are so wrapped up in all of this that it will take you a long time to see it this way...but... like seriously, who cares if you have images of your penis going through a cheese grate.  Fuck it, no big deal, they are just images.  Who cares if you feel your teeth scrapping on a chalk board?  And, don't get me wrong I have had that exact same one, and you can actually start to feel it on your teeth it gets so bad, but if you think about it ain't that bad, just a bit scrapping and chalk, no big deal.

OCD,3d7pub,PurpleBlueLights,4,Tue Jul 14 04:08:26 2015 UTC,"You've got a really great attitude already, you clearly are prepared to face this stuff head-on no matter what. That's what'll get you through it.  Most of the advice I'd give you is already included somewhere in the wiki. I'd recommend reading through it, or at least the sections on therapy and treatment. And like I do for any post, I'd recommend you seek professional help in the form of therapy and/or medication. But I understand that's not feasible or ideal for everyone.  The IOCDF has a decent page on self-directed therapy, and a step-by-step guide for designing an exposure exercise.  In terms of what to tackle first, do the most intense exposures you can handle, but ease into it at first. I don't know if you've ever lifted weights in the past, but it's similar to how you approach a bench press. Start with just the bar, and add weights quickly until you find the point where it is tough but you can manage it. That's the weight you want to be lifting.  Similarly, ease into exposure therapy with less stressful and difficult exercises, perhaps on your perfectionism. Then quickly move forward until you hit the point where it's truly draining and difficult. That's where you should focus your efforts.  I hope this helped a bit. Good luck!!"
OCD,3d7pub,Klib,2,Tue Jul 14 04:20:52 2015 UTC,"Some people might not agree with this, but I think that you can work on all of them at once. You're aware that they are related to your OCD and you obviously want to recover from OCD, so why would you keep any of them around any longer than you need to?  Some people approach ERP as something that you do for a set time, and then outside of that you just go back to doing whatever you were before. I think that that approach will hold you back quite a lot. Recovering from OCD means changing the way you behave, the way you respond to your thoughts, your feelings, situations that arise and a host of other things. You have to practice this behavioural change all of the time, not just sometimes.   I think the important thing is working out how you will deal with each of the problems. You need to develop an understanding of each of them, and work out what you need to change in your behaviour for each one. I'd definitely recommend a therapist, they can help you structure your recovery and offer insight and advice."

It's fine to experience the doubts about your relationship, but you don't want to respond to those doubts in your head by asking questions and seeking reassurance. You can leave the doubts in your mind. It's the desire to get rid of these doubts that is feeding your compulsive behaviours, so you need to start accepting them instead.   Let's say that you experience a thought that says that your partner did something horrible, like cheating on you. That uncertainty exists in your head, it's up to you how you're going to respond to it. If you try to get rid of it, by seeking reassurance in some way, next time you experience a similar uncertainty you will have to seek reassurance again. You won't stop having doubts about your relationship, no matter how many questions you ask. With this in mind, you may as well cut out the compulsive behaviour, because that's obviously causing you a lot of problems.   Just keep in mind that when you refuse to ask questions and seek reassurance, you will naturally feel anxious. You will have a growing urge to seek reassurance, because you want to get rid of the uncomfortable feeling that comes with not engaging in your usual compulsion. It's important when you're experiencing this that you persist in not doing that compulsive behaviour, that's the only way that you can cut it out for good."
OCD,3d5v4g,JujuSpammer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:31:31 2015 UTC,"Agree with this. My ocd mostly manifests as checking behaviour. I got to a point where I could limit the actual checking... But started asking my partner questions as another method of checking. Eg asking him if he saw me lock the door. So it was just another form of checking. My psychologist told me to tell him to not engage me when I asked him questions. Politely of course! So maybe tell her to say something like 'you know asking won't help, so I won't answer that' in response to the questions about her past. The best way to stop the compulsions is to not give into them. Which sounds horrible at first but trust me it does work. It gradually gets easier."
OCD,3d5v4g,thatsnotatoaster,2,Tue Jul 14 13:20:26 2015 UTC,"My wife is fighting seeking reassurance as part of her therapy for OCD, and she has asked us to tell her, ""I'm sorry but I can't answer that - you've asked me not to answer OCD's questions."" This way, it is not like we are refusing to answer or talk to HER, but we are refusing to give in to the compulsion."

OCD,3d5v4g,Here_We_Go_Start,2,Tue Jul 14 16:33:23 2015 UTC,"Here's my take on it. I've been dating my girlfriend for two years, but a year before we met, she broke up with a guy that she had been dating for four years — someone she shared very formative experiences with in HS and college.  I used to insecure about it, but now I realize that she is with me, and not him, for a reason. Or, lots of reasons. It doesn't matter what happened with him, or any other guy she dated, because she's not with them. She's with me, and your girlfriend is with you. And obviously, both of our girlfriends are very tolerant of our OCD, so we are lucky in that regard.  Which would you rather: Be with her and be happy, or worry about her past until she dumps you? I've been thinking a lot about the cost of my OCD, and what is worth sacrificing in service of mental ""security"" (aka satisfying my absurd obsessions). Obviously, being well medicated helps me think about this more clearly. I think maybe you should get medication checked if it's that bad, but also think about, how much is this girl worth to you? Do you want to lose her over this? How much would you regret that?"
OCD,3d5v4g,Here_We_Go_Start,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:23:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your thoughtful reply. I often think about the points you make and if it's worth it to upset her the way I do. She asks me that too. If it's worth putting her through such pain and putting our relationship through this just for mental security, as you put it. Like another said, there's no end to the questions. Each one asked just erodes the mental security more. Last night I really made an effort to just tell myself, ""yknow what, i accept her past for what it is and choose to be with her now"". I kept telling myself that over and over and it somewhat helped. Im not perfect either. I've done some things she wouldn't like I'm sure. I would regret ruining this for the rest of my life if she dumps me. I want to stop, I need to stop, I'm trying to stop. I just haven't been able to yet. My longest is about a week with no questions. It feels so exhausting and draining to just go one day..."
OCD,3d5v4g,Neeraj84,2,Tue Jul 14 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"It seems like you have a good attitude and realize what you need to do, which is a huge step. Don't worry about going a week — take it one day at a time. Reward yourself for not asking. You will build momentum.  And when it gets really painful, think of all the stuff you've done with girls that you wouldn't want her to know about, and realize you can't judge her for anything!"

I like this girl and ask her a lot of questions, we are not even dating, and even if we do, it would be LDR.  I feel less alone to see that there are others too who have similar problem as me, and it gets so severe that you almost get non-functional.  I am not sure what is the reason behind that behavior of mine though, is it OCD? BPD? or something else which psychologists and psychiatrists haven't even discovered yet! (I sometimes feel that way, lol.)  Anyway, good luck man."

Have been showering excessively, and reading quite a bit about STD's now..   But yes, I fear that I've caught something, and just feel so helpless at the moment..   I've taken some comfort in knowing that HIV rates are pretty much non-existant where I live, so it's highly unlikely although it's possible, and then there are all the other ones..   I suppose this is why I haven't been sexually active these past few years..  It's so incredibly disappointing that a fun Friday evening had to result in this obsession..   In any case thank you for letting me unload on you guys."

I will try to get in contact with her tomorrow, although I am very nervous about making contact with her.   But you seem to address it rather matter of frankly so I think I will do the same!

But you have to remember that some people are more vain than others and you won't win everyone's approval. Even if you do nothing!

I know that I shouldn't worry about what other people think as long as I'm happy with it but that's easier said than done."

Try to live with the uncertainty and the anxiety it produces, and eventually it will go down. I know it is hard (there was a quilted cover left on the grand piano in our wedding pictures that drove me crazy for a long time), but that is how you fight the OCD -- learn to live in the uncertainty of it, and the anxiety will eventually lessen, as our brains simply cannot sustain high anxiety levels forever. I would suggest you stop scouring the photos and analyzing, as those are compulsive behaviors relating to the obsession over the perceived imperfection, and will just continue to make you feel worse!"

If you have that thought that maybe everyone was laughing at you, you don't want to try to nullify it. You don't want to tell yourself that it probably wasn't the case and that most likely no one paid any attention to the watch. If you do that, you're setting a dangerous precedent, which is to respond to uncertainty in your mind by seeking reassurance. That strategy will keep you doing compulsive behaviours everyday.   It's better to let yourself have those doubting thoughts and accept them, not wanting to get rid of them. You don't want to waste your time being certain about everything."

OCD,3d32w3,hawk-651,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:42:04 2015 UTC,Anyone know what type of obsession I have? I have a bizarre anxiety related to my hair length. I notice that my anxiety/ocd levels overall seem to increase a lot when my hair gets longer. I can feel my head and ears feeling warm and anxiety at increased levels when I have longer hair. I'm almost wondering from a rational standpoint if it's because anxiety causes a warmer head in general and my hair being so thick causes a greenhouse effect of scalp heat and anxiety when it's longer lol. Things go back to 'normal' (more manageable lol) when I give myself a shorter buzz haircut. Luckily it doesn't look too odd and my family/friends just assume I like having my hair short. It's definitely not trichotillomania because the way I relieve it is by giving myself a normal buzz cut. I'm a guy so I can easily pull this style off. But it's just really fucking weird that I've had this recent obsession that started a few years ago and is relieved by a haircut. The only real benefit to this is that I'm really damn good at hair cuts and I guess I look decent with short hair.
OCD,3d32w3,JujuSpammer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:39:22 2015 UTC,You have to keep reading it. You can't avoid the things that give you anxiety. You have to confront them and not let them make you do compulsive behaviours.

OCD,3d32if,unicorn-pudding,2,Mon Jul 13 04:41:02 2015 UTC,"The best place to seek a diagnosis is with a mental health professional. OCD is just a label to describe certain symptoms that people experience, with regard to their thoughts and behaviours. It really depends on the extent of these behaviours and how much they are affecting your life. It's definitely worth seeing someone who can decide if you do fit the OCD label, and offer treatment if that is the case."
OCD,3cyyw6,kamnoodle,6,Sun Jul 12 01:35:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, these are all just thoughts in your head. They don't have any real meaning, it's up to you to decide how you want to deal with them.   If a thought tells you to act in a way that doesn't align with who you are, you're not forced to carry out that action. Despite your thoughts, you still have full control over your behaviour. Therefore, you don't need to worry about thoughts that depict you doing something horrible, those things will only happen if you choose to do them, not due to the thoughts that are present in your head.  With this knowledge, it becomes unnecessary to analyse these thoughts or to take measures to lessen the likelihood of them happening in the real world. You recognise that they are only present inside your head, and that you still control your behaviour. You can let yourself experience these thoughts without needing to be rid of them or to seek reassurance about their content. This is called accepting your thoughts and accepting your doubts, it's very effective for dealing with these kind of thoughts."
OCD,3cyyw6,JujuSpammer,3,Sun Jul 12 02:05:31 2015 UTC,"It took me about five sessions to bring up similar thoughts with my therapist and I wish I hadn't waited so long. We went through some exposure therapy stuff and she explained that people with intrusive thoughts like these are -less- likely to do the things they are afraid of (like harming others) compared to people with healthy thought patterns who don't ever worry about it.   Your counsellor will have heard this before, it happens to more people than you think, and the sooner you bring it up the sooner you both can start working on a plan to get back to healthy thoughts. You won't feel like this forever."

So please know you aren't alone in this.   With regards to your career, my bf is a hairdresser, he can cope now, but his thoughts revolved hugely around stabbing people in the neck with the scissors, drowning them while washing their hair, choking them with the cape thing etc. He copes at work just fine now, don't let this rob you of your dreams.

OCD,3cz0qk,fiber17,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:54:40 2015 UTC,"I have been on several benzodiazepines. They sort of just make you not care, in my case at least. They make you indifferent to your OCD, they don't really make it disappear or anything. You might even not do compulsions out of laziness (they make you very lethargic.)  Generally they aren't given to people with OCD unless they're being used to supplement CBT. The reason is because they're not meant to be taken long term. They don't improve your condition as a whole, and often can make it worse in the long run.  They're also extremely addictive. Your tolerance can build very quickly, and before you know it, you're addicted. Let me tell you, benzo withdrawals suck.  They also have some pretty vicious side effects. They make you very tired, make you feel very lazy, and they make your memory pretty terrible. If your dose is high enough it becomes difficult to talk without slurring pretty badly.  That said, a lot of people do have ""just in case"" prescriptions for benzos, because despite the downsides they are a very useful tool. A lot of people will get them to deal with emergency situations for example. But most people with OCD get them as a ""crutch"" of sorts to help with CBT. You'll have to discuss it with a psychiatrist, obviously. A lot of psychiatrists are against the idea of giving benzodiazepines to OCD patients completely, and for understandable reasons. Benzos by themselves are not going to improve your condition, and run a large risk of making it worse."

If you want to succeed in stopping this however, you have to be willing to accept that very high anxiety that comes with not looking up the disturbing pictures. That's always how you feel when you first refuse to carry out a compulsive behaviour.   Remember, you can control this behaviour, despite what your thoughts say and how anxious you feel. The reason you choose to engage in it is to relieve yourself from the very high anxiety. You can learn to experience the urge without giving in to it, you just have to let yourself experience the discomfort that comes with that, and persist in not engaging in the compulsion.   It's definitely worth it to cut this compulsion out, because you'll show yourself that you don't have to struggle with compulsive behaviours. If you succeed in this, you'll be able to cut out other compulsive behaviours in other areas of your life, and that's the key to beating OCD for good."

OCD,3cys11,JujuSpammer,2,Sun Jul 12 02:40:40 2015 UTC,"I know you feel very anxious when you refrain from looking up the pictures, but it's really important to let yourself have that feeling. You don't want to try to reduce it, you want to feel it fully. If being somewhere makes that feeling very strong, don't get out of that environment to try to calm yourself. That's what exposure is all about, being in the situation that makes you most anxious, and choosing not to perform compulsive actions."
OCD,3cyx1k,coopaloop28,3,Sun Jul 12 01:16:58 2015 UTC,"Well ocds severity depends on a variety of factors but I think, generally,  if you're getting treatment then it's likely to improve (I.e. Symptoms lessen).  I first suffered severe ocd problems from 16-18, then there was a lul, but it came back at 21 very severely.  Since then I've been on medicine and that helps a lot; more than that as time continues I understand it better and learn better ways to deal with it.  In sum, there's reason to say ""it gets better"""
OCD,3cyx1k,clumseey,2,Sun Jul 12 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"It's possible. When I had OCD, the amount of compulsive behaviours I would perform would regularly change. I would have days when I did quite few compulsive behaviours, but then on other days compulsions would absolutely dominate my time.   If you begin therapy, and you apply the skills you learn consistently throughout your life, I can guarantee that you will improve considerably with regard to your OCD. Remember, compulsive behaviours are deliberate actions that you perform, if you learn to stop doing them then OCD influences your life much less.   Recovering from OCD is a practice however. It's not good enough to go to therapy sometime, and then just get back to doing what you were doing before. Once you learn how to deal with your thoughts, with doubts, with anxiety, you have to practice those strategies everyday for the rest of your life. I definitely recommend therapy if you don't do it already, plenty of people have succeeded with cutting out the unhealthy compulsive behaviours that ruled their life earlier, and therapy is the best tool for achieving that."
OCD,3cyx1k,JujuSpammer,2,Sun Jul 12 02:12:53 2015 UTC,"OCD is a progressive disease, but not degenerative. If untreated, most people with OCD will get worse to no end; the rest actually can reach a stopping point of sorts where it just plateaus.  That said, since most people have progressive OCD, it's best to assume it will get worse if untreated. My psychiatrist came up with a good analogy: The OCD pathway is like a dirt track, and the more you drive in a that circle, the deeper the track becomes. It's important to remember that OCD is a physiological disease, not psychological: There is something wrong with the brain in people with OCD. While it will never be normal, you can learn to use your brain in a way that emulates normality to the point where you are effectively normal.  That said, there are a small number of people who have what's called refractory OCD, and it basically means they don't respond to treatment. In these scenarios, very extreme measures are taken (Deep Brain Stimulation, Gamma Knife Surgery, etc...) - but don't worry about this. It's pretty rare.  Edit: I remembered another scenario, though this one is extremely rare: Some people actually go into spontaneous remission. They just ""grow out"" of OCD. So some people do randomly get better. But this is very, very, very rare."

However, your health insurance may or may not require you to get a referral from your GP before they will cover it. Check first! Most doctors that I've encountered would have no problem giving such a referral, though they might require (or charge for) an office visit in order to do so. If yours won't give you one, it might be time to find a new GP.  As for ""running tests"", that may or may not be the correct thing to do, depending on the tests and how long this has been going on. When I was diagnosed ~12 years ago, they tested me for everything from HIV to brain cancer in order to rule out other causes (lots of blood drawn plus an MRI of my brain). They suspected from the start that it was OCD, but ruling everything else out was (is?) standard procedure."

OCD,3cywsd,kmarple1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:36:19 2015 UTC,"There's actually a very good AMA on /r/science about this, so I'll just quote them:   There are 2 evidence based treatments for OCD.  1) Medications (SSRI - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) 2) CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), consisting of exposure and response prevention.  These treatments alone, or in combination, can help half of the people become well. Not just better, but well. Well meaning, minimal to no symptoms.   Personally, I only have experience with medication; I've never tried CBT. You might dig through the AMA for more information.  As for medication, I've been taking it daily for ~13 years. Thankfully, I'm one of those people who can be classified as ""well"". On a day-to-day basis, I have almost no symptoms. There are occasional bad spots, but nothing nearly as bad as when I initially developed symptoms back in high school.  It does need to be said that finding a combination of medicine and dosage that works without terrible side effects can be a drawn out process. For me, it took two months for the medication to fully take effect, and another two years of changing medications and dosages to get there.  That said, getting help was easily the best decision I've ever made. From the time I developed symptoms to the point the pills started working was the worst six months of my life. The process of finding the right meds can be an ordeal, but it doesn't even compare to dealing with untreated symptoms."

In addition to this, I also recommend researching OCD, to see if you can relate to the pattern of obsessions and compulsions which defines OCD, and also to begin familiarising yourself with the ways to tackle OCD. You'll probably find a lot of things that you're doing right now which are keeping you in the unhealthy cycle, which need to change if you want to get better."

If you get urges to analyze thoughts and such, you have to stop (if you have OCD).   I recommend continually hanging out with this guy, and letting yourself feel the anxiety. Don't avoid it, don't avoid thoughts, just let it all happen. Your brain will soon stop caring."
OCD,3ctsdt,yeahmynameisbrian,3,Fri Jul 10 20:35:01 2015 UTC,"This is the right approach. Anxiety happens, what needs to change is the way you behave in response to it. Right now, you probably try to reduce the anxiety in some way, by seeking reassurance, or engaging in mental rumination. You need to move towards accepting the anxiety, have the mindset that you are feeling anxious and that is okay, that you will allow yourself to continue feeling anxious.   Always keep your focus on your behaviour, not your feelings, or even your thoughts. Understand that the thing you're most in control of is the actions you engage in, so you're going to keep focusing on behaving in the best way possible."

OCD,3ctrpp,throwawaypureo,2,Fri Jul 10 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"It's a super common worry. All kinds of images and ideas will pop into your head with OCD including the kind that you had.It's really hard because no matter how much you know you're not attracted to it, OCD doesn't operate on logic and will still make you feel like you're a monster.    This is the tough part.  The actual ""therapy"" or way of getting over it is to bear with the pain.  It's really hard and I struggle with it myself.  Every time you go for reassurance it's like scratching an itch.  It's short term relief but in the end it will make the itch stronger or worse.  OCD is tough like that.     If you have these bad thoughts, you kind of have to acknowledge that they're there but not respond to them. In time the urgency to ""deal with"" the thoughts fades.    But yeah POCD and that sort of thing is really common. It's a little different for everyone but that's not out of the ordinary at all, you're not alone. I've dealt with it all in the past 14  years.  Crushing guilt, urges to confess, reassurance needs, all kinds of stuff for different kinds of OCD.  Try looking into ocdtribe.com.  It can be a good support community like here.    I know this is tough and I know it sucks.  I know from experience.  You don't want to hear ""Hey do this therapy"" -- you want some kind of answer that you're not a monster.  That you're not this awful thing.  That feeling you get?  That terrible desire to just know that you're okay? That's OCD and it's a total jagweed.  Learn that feeling and learn to recognize that it's OCD.  That concept has helped me quite a bit in sorting out some of the things I have to struggle with."

OCD,3cpjwg,mentalissuesthrowawa,2,Thu Jul 9 19:16:25 2015 UTC,"You have to sit with these feelings. I suggest taking 10 to 20 minutes a day to meditate and sit with yourself -through- the feelings. The more you try to avoid them, the worse they get as they seem to follow you around wherever you go.   If you want a guided meditation video to help you along, I have some links to share. I've struggled with those feelings before, and I personally think it was my fear/anxiety about being lonely that caused them. Regardless of the reason, the feelings are there and you have to confront them."
OCD,3cpjwg,saladthrowawayy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:02:25 2015 UTC,"The answer is always to let yourself experience whatever feelings your brain throws at you, whether you find them pleasant or unpleasant. You're exactly right, deliberately avoiding these feelings will make them worse, you're basically signalling to your brain that you don't want this feeling, that you want it to go away. Of course it's going to come back again some other time, and if you keep responding to it by avoiding it, it's going to end up significantly impacting your behaviour and hindering you in what you want to achieve.  Learning to accept unpleasant feelings isn't that hard, it just takes everyday practice. Next time you have some unpleasant feeling, get up and do something healthy and productive. Don't let the way you feel stop you from doing what you want to do. You're not doing this to make yourself feel good, you're doing it because you want to be healthy."

OCD,3cpvb6,Ronald--Raygun,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:36:55 2015 UTC,"It's a thought. Your brain doesn't discriminate between OCD or low-self esteem, or any other mental illness label that's out there. Your brain just does what it does, which is produce thoughts, which can take the form of images, words, voices, memories, whatever.   What your job is (Yes, you, you are not just your brain, your brain is a part of you) is to choose how you are going to respond to these thoughts. You say that these thoughts make you feel inferior and sad, it's very important that you don't try to get rid of these feelings. If you do, you are engaging in compulsive behaviours, these only give you temporary relief, before the thoughts strike again and you find yourself doing the same actions again. The key is to let yourself have these thoughts, to accept that you are having them and that you won't try to get rid of them in any way. You also accept the unpleasant feelings that come with the thoughts. Focus on not doing any compulsive behaviours, no matter how strong the urge is to do so.   If you do that, and do it persistently, you'd have learned how to deal with this problem in the right way. It won't matter whether it's caused by OCD or low self-esteem, since the solution is always more important than the problem."

OCD,3cn6ps,prettycharms,3,Thu Jul 9 05:17:28 2015 UTC,"The diagnosis process consists predominantly of listening to what the patient says; asking questions; and comparing the patient's responses and history to the (DSM's) established criteria. Though this may seem like something a layman could do with a copy of the DSM-5, medical training is needed in order to tease out the difference between ""oh yeah I feel that way sometimes"" and a clinically-significant symptom, as well as to differentiate between OCD and other anxiety disorders - which sometimes have considerable overlap of symptoms. The root cause of OCD is poorly understood, but it may be related to low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, as many individuals with OCD improve when put on SSRIs. As a result, there are - to my knowledge - no lab tests that can diagnose OCD.   Is it easy?   Yes. Be forthright, no stupid questions/no stupid answers and whatnot - don't worry about saying something that might make you ""sound crazy"" in their eyes. It's your doctor's job to stay objective and help you, and, well... they've heard worse.   Does this mean something really bad?   Not necessarily. If you do have OCD, given treatment, the quality of the past decade of your life could potentially have been better and less stressful. That aside, OCD isn't like an infectious disease - leaving it untreated doesn't generally make it worse."
OCD,3cn6ps,scubaguybill,3,Thu Jul 9 06:11:16 2015 UTC,"There aren't any objective tests for OCD (or any mood disorders at the moment). The doc will take a history (meaning you describe your symptoms to them and they ask you questions), and then you'll fill out a couple of questionnaires to test the clinical significance of those symptoms. This must be interpreted by a qualified person, but you can Google ""YBOCS self-assessment"" if you want an idea of where you stand. Does that explain it?   As far as what it means for you if you have OCD... well, it's just a label for a set of maladaptive thought processes. As for whether it's bad, well, how much is it distressing you? It's not like you've got an increased risk of developing cancer or anything; it's just a matter of learning how to control your thoughts (and more importantly your response to those thoughts).  With mental disorders, the criterion we look at is ""is this significantly interfering with your daily life?"" Do you spend time performing rituals? Does that make you late? Do you spend time thinking about what your obsessions mean about you? These are the sorts of questions you'll be asked.   Hope this helps. I'm happy to answer further questions if you have any."

So, in my case, it was about a 5-10 min. description of my habits/compulsions to my doctor."
OCD,3cn6ps,Sarahsays1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:23:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with much of what has been said here; I would only add that if you go to a doctor for a diagnosis don't tell them you think you have ocd or use terms like obsessions or compulsions--describe your symptoms and see if they reach the conclusion that you suffer from ocd.

OCD,3ckvz1,Tatpixie13,2,Thu Jul 9 05:18:33 2015 UTC,"The key is not trying to make the thoughts stop. You have to learn to experience them without wanting to get rid of them or respond to them in any way through your behaviour. I don't recommend trying to figure out why you are having these thoughts, I doubt you'll ever find an answer to this. A much better strategy is to stop thinking about it alltogether. Be willing to experience those thoughts without wanting to get rid of them, and you'll find that they will bother you much less.   Remember, whether it's an image, voice, memory or whatever else, if it's inside your head, it's just a thought. It can't escape your head, it can't hurt you in any way. Therefore you don't need to be afraid of what's going on in your head, just make sure that your behaviour in response to those thoughts is the right one."

I've noticed that this really only happens as I'm falling asleep. I mentioned it to my psych providers and they all said that it's normal, as long as it's the only symptom. If your providers say the same thing; that it's normal, then I think your OCD is just being an asshole and trying to convince you that you have something that you really don't. Don't feel bad about worrying so much. Just train your brain to let this obsession go.

If you want to stop worrying about things, to stop having doubts in your mind, you're just going to keep the cycle going.  Your entire approach to your thoughts needs to change. Instead of wanting thoughts to go away, practice accepting them, practice letting them stay in your head. If you have unpleasant feelings that come along with those thoughts, practice accepting those feelings as well.   Does accepting unpleasant thoughts mean holding them to be true? Not necessarily. It just means accepting them to be present in your head, and not wanting to be rid of them. You also don't want to dwell on your thoughts, in an attempt to figure out their meaning. That will just send you down a path of rumination, which can be a very bothersome compulsive behaviour.  If you adopt this state of thinking, it will be easier to not engage in compulsions. You'll start to see the futility of needing to check on things, of seeking constant reassurance, of avoiding things that make you anxious or uncomfortable. Just make sure that you're practicing everyday, don't let bad feelings or situations stop you from not performing compulsions. If you learn not to perform these unhealthy behaviours through the most unpleasant of situations, that's when you're really going to beat your OCD for good."

Try looking them up - they're open to anyone and it's a great way to meet people who understand what you're going through and can help you seek treatment. Once you seek proper treatment, you can finally be free of engaging in compulsive behaviors and your family won't be such dicks about your illness. Some people still can't seem to fathom the idea of mental illness because it's harder for their minds to gauge that something is actually wrong - but don't lose hope! The stress you're under just makes giving into compulsions worse, but we can help you!"
OCD,3ciq20,Ryukil,5,Wed Jul 8 05:42:20 2015 UTC,"Australian doctor   This is what happens when they hand out medical degrees at the University of Wollongong :P   1960s   Remember that during this time, homosexuality was a listed mental illness. It was hardly the peak of psychiatry. Panic and agoraphobia is also a different deal to compulsions. The fact that it's only a small part of her book means she isn't an expert. The fact that such a strategy hasn't been widely adopted suggests that it probably hasn't been found to be effective in controlled studies. The problem is, I think, that it's a backwards treatment approach. It's the same thing as exposure therapy but the exposure attenuates a behaviour without addressing the underlying problem. By resisting compulsions, you whose yourself to the underlying anxiety rather than masking it. That's just my uneducated assessment based on how you presented the technique though. I'm just very skeptical."
OCD,3ciq20,eg-er-ekki-islensku,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:16:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the 1960's are arguably one of the darkest times in modern mental health history. Very little of what was considered standard then is considered ethical today. I would disregard anything written before the mid 1980's on OCD, and would try to focus most of what information you gather on the late 1990's to the present."
OCD,3ciq20,IWillDefeatOCD,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:30:48 2015 UTC,"You would see a lot of improvements if you start letting go. It doesn't matter if the compulsions are distressing or not. Your brain has to get in the habit of not reacting to your obsessions. I recommend exposing yourself to your obsessions, and not doing any compulsions."
OCD,3ciq20,yeahmynameisbrian,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:26:09 2015 UTC,"They're just talking about the feelings you get with compulsions. Your brain has to get in the habit of not caring about your obsessions. You want things to be a certain way when you do your compulsions, so the negative/painful feeling goes away. So I suppose if you start your compulsion, then slowly stop doing it to get that feeling, it's the same thing as stopping the compulsions maybe? But it makes no sense. You go with compulsions so you can get rid of that negative feeling, otherwise you would not be doing the compulsions. It's just your OCD bothering you about this, let go of the compulsions as you normally do and ignore this silly advice. Even if they were right, why the fuck would you want to do the compulsions? I don't want to stand around all day and wash my hands."

You do not have full concious choice other what bothers you / what you like / what you want to do  I think that puts a spanner in the works with this approach, but I do think that a degree of acceptance is definitely useful with OCD. I think you have to be careful to make sure that acceptance is adaptive though  Peronally, I've tried willingly giving into my compulsions, in fact over time and as my insight has grown I have gradually come to identify with them less and less. In my experience I was a lot less in control of my life and a lot more hopelessly unhappy when I had the view that I was helpless and should do them - and I did a hell of a lot more of them  On a psychology level, this line of reasoning goes against all the current understanding and research that exists in the area"

OCD,3chqkx,redditijustmetit,5,Wed Jul 8 00:21:37 2015 UTC,"Guess what, recovery requires you to accept high feelings of anxiety and be able to commit to not engaging in compulsive behaviours. If you let anxiety stop you from pursuing your recovery, you will always have OCD.  It is possible to overcome compulsive behaviours without therapy. Therapy is designed to teach you the skills you need to not perform these behaviours, these skills can be learned outside of therapy, and they can be applied in your everyday life. If you want to go down this path, I'd suggest you start by researching exposure and response prevention. Familiarise yourself with this technique, it's going to be the core of your OCD recovery.  To put it very simply, you're exposing yourself to the things that trigger your compulsive behaviours, and refusing to perform said behaviours. Let's say one of your compulsions is checking the door lock after you leave the home. What you do is leave the home like you usually do, but deliberate refuse to check that door lock. This sounds very simple, but the first time you do that, you will experience high anxiety. You are probably familiar with this because you've tried before and you noticed this spike in anxiety.  Here's the thing, there's no way around that anxiety if you want to cut out a compulsion. You just have to accept it, let yourself feel it, and persist in not performing your compulsive behaviours. It's the only way that you'll learn not to perform them anymore. Think of it this way, it's better to experience some short-term pain in the form of high anxiety, than to be engaging in these behaviours for the rest of your life.   Alongside ERP, I'd also recommend learning new ways of approaching your thoughts in your head. If you spend a lot of time ruminating and analysing your thoughts, you will open yourself up to a lot of compulsive behaviours down the track. This is mostly true with regard to doubts, you will develop compulsive behaviours to try to get rid of your doubts, by checking, seeking reassurance, performing mental compulsions and so on. You really need to start accepting doubts, allowing yourself to be uncertain of things. If you keep wanting to be sure of everything, you will inevitably wind up with more compulsive behaviours."

OCD,3cg3b0,skjdhfslkjdh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:15:30 2015 UTC,"Hey, I can relate. I'm in a long term relationship and my current obsession is sexual orientation.  Now, while the anxiety is present while you're in a relationship, it isn't the guy or the relationship itself that's ""wrong"" - it's your constant worry that things will fall apart and you won't have control over them. Gender dysphoria is a lot different and a unique struggle in its own way, but OCD makes it seen real to you. And the fact that you, like me, bounced from theme to theme proves it.  I have to remind myself that I always obsess over something different from time to time. What makes the sexual orientation/trans themes so powerful is that they challenge everything you know and feel about yourself, and they consume you.  I have some meditation videos to link to you if you're interested, cause deep breathing helps untangle the nerves and helps you face your thoughts and see them for what they really are - irrational proponents of fear."

Next you need to treat this like an illness because it is. Have spoken to your doctor or therapist yet?  I have found this therapy service helpful - https://www.betterhelp.com/#  - you get 7 days free and its around $90 a month which was a lot less than what I was paying for in-person therapy.   Once you realise that it's a biological condition, it will get easier I promise but I promise you can't out think or rationalise it."
OCD,3cg3b0,saladthrowawayy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:19:20 2015 UTC,mind is right. Trying to talk out of it only facilitates the thought loop. Working with a therapist on how to sit with and accept your thoughts so that you do not react to them is the only way to break the cycle.

I guess what you're doing now is seeking some reassurance that tells you that your compulsive behaviour isn't rational. That in itself is a compulsive behaviour.   If you want to beat OCD, your goal isn't to get rid of your doubts, it's to stop performing the deliberate actions that are keeping you in the cycle."

It can be stressful explaining it to other people.

People who can't work! Me:........Could you not? Anyway. The best thing to do is just focus on getting help. Talk to the people who understand when you need a friend for this sort of stuff. ProTip; if you really want to make a point, describe it as a neurological illness. It's accurate, and somehow more tangible to most people than a mental illness for some reason. Edit: Grammar"
OCD,3cekzd,ffffsauce,3,Tue Jul 7 08:29:42 2015 UTC,"Don't try to make yourself stop thinking of something. What you'll find is that you can't achieve that and that will continue to bother you. You can't make yourself stop having a certain thought, that effort is actually making that thought even more prominent.   I don't know what I can advice you here other than to learn accepting the thoughts your brain gives you, rather than wanting to get rid of them. Thoughts will never hurt you, no matter what they say or what meaning you give to them. You also don't have full control over what thoughts are present in your head, so you can't make them come and go as you please. You need to practice letting your brain have whatever thoughts it wants to have, and keeping your focus on your actions, which you have much more control over."
OCD,3cekzd,JujuSpammer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:41:33 2015 UTC,"I try to let myself accept the thoughts as they come and observe it without giving them any sort of credibility, but sometimes when it sets off that physical alarm in my body I cave and start ruminating about it. You're right though, accepting them and letting them come and go is the best way to approach this. Thanks for the advice :)"
OCD,3cekzd,JujuSpammer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:02:55 2015 UTC,"Being able to experience that physical discomfort and persisting with not engaging in the compulsion is an important part of the process. When you're so used to behaving in a certain way, choosing not to do that will make you very anxious. This doesn't mean that something is wrong, it's just how your body responds to what you're doing.   If you want to stop performing compulsive behaviours, you have to be ready and willing to experience discomfort and anxiety. You shouldn't try to get rid of this feeling, you should let yourself experience it fully, no matter how unpleasant you find it. Throughout this, you make sure you don't perform your compulsive behaviour. This is you learning how not to give in to your thoughts and to choose the right behaviour. Keep practicing this, you'll get better at it and you'll be able to get rid of all the compulsions you engage in at the moment."
OCD,3cekzd,saladthrowawayy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:21:16 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Juju is on point. You have to learn to accept the thoughts and physical feelings that come with them, but I totally understand what you mean. I usually get hot flashes on my face/neck, racing heartbeat, stomach in knots, and my forearms also feel like they're on fire - it's horrible!  But, there are ways to face these sensations. Here is a guided meditation video from an OCD sufferer who helps you sit through and accept these thoughts/feelings in order to feel better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3OJOSqyBsE  It's scary and it isn't something you deliberately want to do at first, but with practice it becomes noticeably easier. When you get these thoughts, your body is in panic mode and sends out distress signals to your brain that makes you experience these physical sensations - it's a flight/fight response and it's normal for any one with a anxiety/panic disorder. Just remember that anytime this happens to you, with deep-breathing/meditation, it's an OPPORTUNITY to sit with yourself and accept whatever comes your way.  Let me know if that helps!"
OCD,3cekzd,Bassman5k,3,Tue Jul 7 14:04:17 2015 UTC,"Hey brother, I'll recommend meditation/mindfulness as well! I suffer bad physical symptoms as well and deep breathing and feeling the body and sometimes using exposure therapy in combination with deep breathing to try to break that association between knots in your stomach and that thought/panic can be helpful."
OCD,3cekzd,saladthrowawayy,2,Tue Jul 7 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"Ooof, I get the hot flashes too. not a good feeling. I'll make sure to refer back to this video next time I experience a bad episode. I have noticed that as I become more aware of these sensations and reactions i'm less likely to be alarmed and ruminate more about them. I like your wording of it being an opportunity rather than some exhausting negative thing. Thanks for your help."
OCD,3cdlxz,softrebel,3,Tue Jul 7 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I think the reason is because new situations and environments require your brain to engage your surroundings. Being in your familiar area doesn't require much mental engagement, so your brain has free reign to do as it pleases. I think this is one of the reasons nature is helpful for a lot of people. Nature is constantly changing, and there are so many things to observe that you can't really ever experience all of it."
OCD,3cdlxz,IWillDefeatOCD,3,Tue Jul 7 02:59:00 2015 UTC,I 100% agree. Stress or lack there of definitely affect my obsessive symptoms.

It has become a safe space for him. Uni stressed him out which made him prone to getting worse with some things, so a change of environment is huge in how it impacts him. I think your post is spot on"
OCD,3cdlxz,scoyle391,2,Tue Jul 7 02:34:14 2015 UTC,"I think this is quite common for OCD. Often your obsessions and compulsions are tied to the things that you do everyday, and a sudden change in that daily routine can seem to give you this temporary relief from those things.  However what I think you'll find is that after a while, you will develop new obsessions, and if you choose to, new compulsions. That's because OCD comes from the way you interact with your surrounding environment, you choose to behave in a certain way when you have feelings, thoughts and other things happen around you. That's ultimately what OCD is, an unhealthy pattern of behaviour that can be very hard to cut out.  The only way to make lasting change is to address the underlying causes of OCD. The way that you approach doubt and uncertainty, the way you behave in response to unpleasant feelings, how you interact with other people. All of these need to change if you want to break that cycle.   I'd recommend behavioural therapy for this, especially ERP and ACT. Speak to someone who has experience in dealing with OCD patients and they will get you started on making those changes, so that you can get permanent relief from OCD, not just temporary."
OCD,3cdlxz,JujuSpammer,2,Tue Jul 7 03:03:05 2015 UTC,"Ha, last weekend I took a trip with some friends and had a hotel room entirely to myself for about 18 hours. Obsessions, compulsions, and symptoms of other anxiety disorders were nonexistent in that environment, but if I had been doing the same activities in my bedroom they would still be there. When I had to go to social stuff it came back, but not as fiercely.  Things were pretty similar when I moved into a new apartment, but symptoms came back after a week or so. It took a long time for it to get back to ""normal levels"" if that makes sense. So I think I agree with a previous commenter, it must have something to do with routine. But in your case you started taking your meds at the same time, so you may be on your way to a more permanent change. Congrats!!"
OCD,3cdlxz,MsAllSunday,2,Tue Jul 7 10:16:00 2015 UTC,"Yes! I remember when I went to Europe (I live in the US), most of my OCD tendencies disappeared and I was able to do things without anxiety for the first time in years. It was so reliving.   Sadly, from experience even new environments will start to lose their charm. Try rearranging items in your home, and try to get out and away from home; go stay in a hotel every few months. This helps you get away from your anxiety, and that anxiety-free state will last a few days when you get home, and when the anxiety returns it will be mild at first, so that is an added advantage."

OCD,3cebx6,GrossCD,2,Tue Jul 7 06:28:03 2015 UTC,"Don't get too caught up with the OCD label. It's just there to describe the pattern of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours, nothing more. OCD wasn't some physical thing that existed inside of your brain.   Try to judge your behaviour by whether or not it helps you with living the life that you want. If you have compulsive behaviours, you identify these as unhealthy things that are an obstacle to you being healthy, and you work on cutting them out. Don't waste your time analysing your thoughts and figuring out their meaning, that is a compulsive behaviour and it's not helping you. People with OCD give too much attention to their thoughts and not enough to their behaviour, this needs to change to facilitate recovery."

If it isn't true, we are wasting our time thinking about it, and if it is, we need to make the necessary changes in our lives to accommodate them. But you want to be 100% sure before you make that judgement and the fact that you've had sexual thoughts before probably suggests that it is just an obsession.  Regardless of whether or not you think the therapist can help, you should definitely talk to him about it."

It's amazing the progress I've made in the last six months with a new psychologist and medication. After years of therapy and never really getting better, I didn't think it would ever improve. But it did, and you can learn to deal with it over time. Cognitive behavioural therapy and exposure response therapy are the two main approaches I think. And those are what worked for me.

OCD,3carfs,OCDAviator,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:12:42 2015 UTC,"woww i can totally relate to this! i feel like i am in this exact same situation w/ a ""library dude"". i don't usually even comment on here but this totally hit home. the difference w/ me though is that i nvr found out if he liked me....for all i know he could have hated me. i saw him everyday though and he really grew on me and i just nvr found out what his deal was. i nvr found out if he was an asshole or a good guy. anyways since i have ocd and a rlly wild imagination i guess i just projected all these ideas about him being perfect. i have had guys interested in me but now i can't look at any other guy! i always think about him and how perfect he was. its absolute torture. anyways i know it is my ocd and my tendency to obsess about things especially when i have so many unanswered questions. i nvr told anyone about this...not even my therapist b/c I'm just so embarrassed that i am still thinking about him when its been like 2 years."
OCD,3carfs,runningevryday,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:37:41 2015 UTC,"Been there, done that. You're obsessing about a relationship that never happened. You never got past the flirting stage - trust me, I know, that's not a relationship.   There's no way you could know if she was the one because you never went any more than skin deep. Playful connections are just that - playful. There was no true, deep intimacy, trust and shared joy, pain, knowledge, experiences.   So see this for the madness it truly is (ie. Obsessing about someone that you never truly got to know) and move on.  And next time you meet someone like that - and you will - next time remember that the last time you never really took any risks and never learned any life lessons - so next time lean into it and actually have a relationship.   Only then can you know if someone is the one.  Trust me, been there."
OCD,3cc71c,Mrs-Norris,5,Mon Jul 6 19:47:36 2015 UTC,"You need to eat. You are running on 100 calories in a 72 hour period. I know it's hard, but you need to eat. If you find that you can't eat, you need to go to the emergency room and tell them this. They aren't going to judge you. You are putting yourself in danger.  Whatever you do, please drink water. If you can, drink a liquid with calories. Do you think orange juice would be fine? You need to get some calories in you as soon as possible. But most importantly, you need to drink water if you are not doing so, because while you can go a while without food, being severely dehydrated can have fatal consequences very quickly. Again, if you are too overwhelmed, please go to the emergency room.  Take care of yourself and best of luck."
OCD,3cc71c,IWillDefeatOCD,2,Mon Jul 6 20:58:40 2015 UTC,"I drank about half a banana strawberry smoothie that had greek yogurt in it and a few bites of one of those high energy bars. I'm drinking some water now, I know not enough though. Yesterday I drank a Gatorade. I am scared to go to the ER. They will think I have anorexia. Also there are sick people there.   This all happened because we went to the fireworks and I am trying really hard to be normal. And normal people aren't scared to eat concessions. So I got a hot dog. Then later that night either from worrying or actually because it was contaminated I started feeling really really bad.   Logically I know, if I WAS sick with food poisoning I would be over it by now. Logically I know my stomach feels weird because there is no food in it. But those what if thoughts are killing me. What if i eat and it makes me sick? Over and over and over in my head."
OCD,3cc71c,IWillDefeatOCD,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:07:11 2015 UTC,"You are diagnosed with OCD right? They will have a psychologist or a psychiatrist speak with you if you go to the ER and they will understand this is not anorexia.  I have eating compulsions too, I know what you mean about trying to be normal when you're with friends. It's definitely hard.  The what ifs are insanely difficult, but you should try to look at it this way: If you eat, sure, maybe there is a very small chance you'll get sick. But if you don't eat, you WILL get sick. That much is certain. Your immune system needs food to function properly. A lack of nutrition is more likely to get you sick than food poisoning will.  I know it's insanely hard, but you need to eat. Unlike most compulsions, this one poses a direct, visceral danger. I don't want to scare you, and you're almost certainly in no danger at this moment, but this will hurt you if you don't stop doing it. It's great that you're drinking water, though, keep trying to drink more.  I really think you should reconsider going to the ER. Your electrolyte balance is almost certainly not correct, and that can have pretty severe consequences (again, you are almost certainly not in danger at this moment, but you need to take care of this very soon.)"
OCD,3cc71c,meepmedeeply,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:40:19 2015 UTC,"I know it is affecting me because I am already a thin person so I don't have much reserves to fall back on. I have noticed I feel weak and dizzy.   I am working on drinking a Gatorade right now. It's really hard. I keep imagining myself vomiting. I also was able to eat about 3/4 can of soup.  I called my therapist and am trying to get an appointment Wednesday because that is my day off work. I really trust him and if he tells me to go to the hospital I will.   I only have to work a half day tomorrow so I hope that will help my anxiety, which is always worse at work.   Thank you for your advice and encouragement. It means a lot."

OCD,3cc71c,Agonyking,2,Tue Jul 7 20:19:41 2015 UTC,"I kind a get how it is with not eating.  When my OCD gets bad for extended periods of time, my desire to eat disappears.  Last year I dropped 50 lbs, it was a rough time.  I always just forced myself to eat whatever was least likely to cause nausea, like breakfast cereal or toast or rice.  It's pretty hard to be offended by white rice.  Take care of yourself, and talk to your therapist if you have one.  And if you don't have a therapist, get one."

Just eat what you would normally eat when you're sick, because your stomach is not going to be able to tolerate a lot right now. Sip on some cold ginger ale and nibble on some saltine crackers. When you feel like you may be able to tolerate a little more, move up to rice, maybe chicken soup and rice, and so on. Possibly some gatorade if you've been dehydrated.   Trust me on this, take it from someone who knows. Hope you feel better, boo."

If you DID eat, and DID vomit, you'll be ok this time too.  And +1 to getting a therapist and talking to someone. If you can, maybe try to drink an Ensure."
OCD,3ca29m,MaverickOCD,6,Mon Jul 6 07:34:52 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't look to get rid of the thoughts in your head or make yourself forget those memories. Doing so will just make them more prominent, and they will bother you even more.  What you can practice however is not dwelling on them. Identify the deliberate behaviours you're engaging in with regard to these thoughts, and stop engaging in them. Maybe you're doing something in an attempt to get rid of the thoughts, maybe you're repeating conversations in your head, whatever it might be that you're engaging in. Cutting out these behaviours is the way you can stop these thoughts from bothering you when you experience them.  So basically, you're learning to accept the thoughts and memories, but you're refusing to deliberately engage with them."
OCD,3ca29m,JujuSpammer,2,Mon Jul 6 09:09:12 2015 UTC,"There must be some kind of habit that's been formed in my head to think and act a certain way at this point. The thoughts come out of nowhere, and they're just more prevalent and repeat more often when I'm stressed. They're also gone before I have a chance to try and accept them, there's only enough time to have a stressed reaction and it's back to normal.  I'll keep looking around for the behaviors that's causing them  Thanks."

OCD,3c8y5b,NoActionIsAction,3,Mon Jul 6 00:30:37 2015 UTC,"It seems that you're still struggling with OCD, so I think you should see a professional and do some more behavioural therapy. What you should look to do is to identify all of your compulsive behaviours, these are the deliberate actions that you engage in when you experience doubts, obsessive thoughts, anxiety and other things that provoke your OCD.   Treating OCD is about stopping these deliberate actions which are keeping you in the cycle of OCD. It's about identifying the things that you can control and changing them. This goes hand in hand with accepting the things that you don't have control over, namely the thoughts in your head and the way that you feel.   Don't get too stuck on what theme you're currently on. It actually matters quite little with regard to recovery. Themes change over time, but the underlying pattern of thoughts and the way you respond to them is still the same. If you want to beat OCD for good, you have to change the way you respond to doubts and unpleasant feelings in all areas of your life. Otherwise, your compulsive behaviours will keep springing up in different areas of your life over time.  One essential component of recovery is being able to accept uncertainty. Constantly seeking to be sure is a core driving element of OCD. Think of all the things you do to make yourself sure that nothing bad will happen to you, that the thoughts in your head aren't real, etc. If you keep looking to alleviate doubt, your brain will keep giving your more doubts, and the cycle will go on and on. You can only break this cycle by accepting these doubts in your mind, not trying to get rid of them.  Another thing that needs to change is the way you interact with your feelings. Often people with OCD let the way they feel dictate the behaviours they engage in. When you feel good you can be healthy and productive, but when you feel sad or anxious, you resort to unhealthy coping and avoiding behaviours.   You need to start practicing being healthy at all times, regardless of the way you happen to feel. This doesn't mean ignoring or suppressing your feelings, it means accepting them as they are, but not letting them stop you from doing what you value. This is something that needs to be practiced everyday. Once again, you're shifting your focus away from something that you don't control (feelings) towards something that you can control (your actions).   I think however the starting point should be to cut out your current set of compulsive behaviours, and for that it's best to do some ERP with someone who specialises in OCD. After you've done that, your aim should be not to begin any new compulsions, so that you stop the cycle from starting again."
OCD,3c8y5b,JujuSpammer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:39:04 2015 UTC,"Juju,  Thank you for your reply. You seem to have a lot of knowledge about OCD. My compulsive behaviours are replacing the thoughts (or arguing with them), reassurance seeking (through forums), and most likely a few others that I can't think of.  I was doing therapy for OCDonline.com for about 7 months that I was able to see some progress, however I recently took the plunge and left my corporate America Job to travel Latin America for as long as possible. This sounds like paradise in theory (and it has been for stretches of time), but all of the uncertainty of my future and risks of travel allow the OCD to go WILD and really full full range. I am trying to be an observant watcher of my thoughts and not get sucked down the rabbit hole. Some days are easier than others...  Also since I don't have money coming in I have only been able to go to one therapy session in the past 3 months.  I would like to conquer this demon on my own...  Have you recovered from OCD? I would be interested in working with you if so."
OCD,3c8y5b,JujuSpammer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"To add to this...I also find making important decisions extremely hard with OCD. Always fearful that I will make the wrong choice, etc.   I suppose it goes hand in hand with accepting the uncertainty of it all."
OCD,3ca40s,OcdWa,2,Mon Jul 6 08:01:24 2015 UTC,"You can't give up with seeking to get better. Right now you're in a bad place, but you have to pick yourself up and get help. You need to speak to a professional, as soon as you can.  There's nothing to be gained from revising the past and feeling bad for the things you've done up until now. You can't take back the time, accept the past and shift your attention to the present. If you keep revising, you never give yourself a chance to live in the present, and to influence your life in the way that you want to.   OCD can be treated, compulsive behaviours can be stopped, you just need to take the first step and seek help. Don't put this off, do it right now."

You might not feel motivated to do it, but if you don't you'll just be stuck in the same cycle that you're in right now. Your problems won't just take care of themselves, you have to make deliberate changes to get where you want to be."
OCD,3c8mqb,saladthrowawayy,4,Sun Jul 5 22:45:17 2015 UTC,"I have changed my diet, recently went to full vegetarian from paleo style diet.  I think it does help but I think the true power lies in changing your relationship with thoughts/urges/emotions...and learning how to not react them.  I wouldn't look at diet as the answer but merely put of the puzzle, although a smaller puzzle piece. Avoid junk food, processed foods, etc. Try to eat all organic."
OCD,3c8mqb,NoActionIsAction,2,Mon Jul 6 00:32:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't look at diet as the answer but merely put of the puzzle   Yeah, that's pretty much how I look at it as well. I'm curious because I, unfortunately, have quite the sweet tooth and am planning on perhaps cutting my refined sugar intake. I've read some articles on how refined sugar could exacerbate anxiety symptoms. So I'm wondering if a change in diet could help minimize the intensity of anxiety/panic attack when faced with obsessions/compulsions, which could ultimately help when in the process of treating OCD."
OCD,3c8mqb,stupidlyparanoid,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:40:20 2015 UTC,Cutting out caffeine and keeping sugar and artificial sweeteners to a minimum has helped me. I also have a sweet tooth and I do notice feeling much worse (physically and mentally) after I overindulge. It's worth trying to fix the craving with a small sugary treat alongside something healthier like your favourite fruit or fruit juice.
OCD,3c8mqb,mark_freeman,4,Sat Jul 11 23:13:21 2015 UTC,"Eating disorders are related to OCD and trying to use food to cope with or control uncertainty and feelings you don't like can quickly become compulsive behaviors that fuel OCD. If you introduce a bunch of new compulsions into your life, you'll notice a change in how you perceive anxiety... temporarily. That's not because of what you're eating, but how you're eating.   You can have the most wonderfully healthy diet in the world and have OCD. And you can have the worst diet in the world and not have OCD.  If you're willing to make drastic changes to overcome OCD, I'd suggest a big plate of eliminating compulsions with a side of delicious, organic acceptance."
OCD,3c8mqb,IWillDefeatOCD,2,Mon Jul 6 11:10:07 2015 UTC,"OCD is a biological disorder. Anything that throws your body off is going to throw off your brain as well.  Any kind of well rounded diet is fine in terms of interaction with OCD. Despite what you may find on the internet, there is nowhere near sufficient evidence to support the claim that things like glutamic acid in your diet affect OCD.  I'm in an OCD program at UCSF and work with some of the best OCD trained psychiatrists/psychologists in the country, the general idea they've given me on this subject is:   Eat enough food. Make absolutely sure you are getting enough calories. Eat a well rounded diet. Certain vitamin/mineral deficiencies can exacerbate OCD symptoms. Avoid caffeine if you can. Caffeine is a stimulant and will invariably increase OCD intensity, even if it helps in the moment. This kind of goes without saying, but avoid drugs and alcohol. While you are unwell, these things will only make your life harder.   As long as you are eating your macronutrient requirements and doing a decent job meeting your micronutrient requirements, what you eat isn't very important.  Source: My team of OCD doctors.  That said:  If you want to drastically change your diet, consult a doctor first. Undertaking any drastic change while OCD is at high intensity is risky because it has the potential to put you under psychological duress. Just my advice, if you want to change your diet, do it incrementally. Large, sweeping changes are a lot harder than small, periodic ones.  Best of luck."
OCD,3c8mqb,yukuisfi,2,Mon Jul 6 18:58:16 2015 UTC,Thanks! That's real helpful. Avoiding caffeine/sugar is going to be the most difficult for me. I just know that having a shitty diet doesn't help anxiety/depression symptoms... but I'm going to be depressed until I beat this problem anyway.
OCD,3c8fs7,HHCJdontbanmethistim,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:44:38 2015 UTC,"You see, you've grown too attached to the mental health labels that exist. You're trying to figure out how to classify the way that you feel at the moment, and that's quite hard. It's also holding you back from improving your mental health.  Don't get me wrong, labels like depression and OCD are important for diagnosing mental illness. There is a good reason that they exist. However, you don't want to become too attached to which label you fall under, it's not going to help you get better. It's more important to focus on the solution rather than the problem.  The best thing to do is to speak to a psychologist. Explain to them the symptoms you're experiencing, what kinds of thoughts you have, the feelings that you're experiencing, the fears and doubts you have, etc. Just be open and honest to them, so they can help you out. Let them figure out the best treatment for improving your mental health."
OCD,3c8k83,fannyrogers,2,Sun Jul 5 22:22:38 2015 UTC,"I know this is something you don't want to hear, but blocking out the thoughts is going to make things much more stressful for you. I suggest you take 30 seconds, close your eyes, and breathe.  Now, I know I tend to get the worst when I'm stressed out about things unrelated to my obsessions.. so I try to remind myself that my brain is reacting to life-stress and there is no need to pay attention to the thoughts. Easier said than done, but even if I have to remind myself every second, I still end up feeling better in the end.   If you're interested, I have a couple YouTube links to guided mindfulness meditation videos. That might be something you ought to try before going to sleep. What is helpful about it is that even if the undesirable thoughts pop up in your head, your only job is to go back to your breath. It's difficult at first, but it gets easier with practice."

OCD,3c8lo0,SykenDrent,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:35:26 2015 UTC,"This is what is called a compulsive behaviour. You have to do it, otherwise you feel very anxious and uncomfortable. You're stuck in a cycle, and the only way to break the cycle is to stop engaging in the behaviour.  This is a challenging process that will make you feel very anxious in the short term. Refraining from compulsive asking these questions will cause an anxiety spike, because you're not engaging in your usual compulsive behaviour. Your brain thinks that something is wrong, this makes you anxious. However, if you want to cut out this behaviour for good, you have to persist in not performing it.   Accept the anxiety that comes with not performing the compulsion, with the knowledge that cutting it out for good is going to significantly improve your mental health. It's better to experience some pain in the short term rather than keep suffering indefinitely. Don't worry, you can cut out this behaviour, you'll just have to be persistent in not engaging in it. Over time the anxiety that comes with not doing the behaviour will drop, and you'll have stopped performing a very annoying compulsive behaviour."

OCD,3c8t8e,iamaguyhere,5,Sun Jul 5 23:46:05 2015 UTC,"You need to change your relationship with your thoughts. Your thoughts shouldn't be dictating your behaviour, they shouldn't be controlling you like they are right now. You have to be the master of your thoughts, you have to learn that you can choose how to respond to them, that they can't make you do certain things.   Right now when you experience particular thoughts, you feel the need to dwell on them. You think that you need to alleviate the doubt in your mind, or maybe try to understand the thoughts and why you're having them. This is driving the cycle of rumination. Your deliberate response to the thoughts in your head is keeping you in this cycle of obsession.   What you need to begin practicing is not engaging with these thoughts. Recognise that they are in your head, and they are confined to that space. They can't escape your head, no matter how hard they try. Recognise that you get to choose how to respond when you experience them. You know that engaging with them is causing you a lot of problems, so the logical choice is to let them be, to not respond to them. This doesn't mean trying to get rid of them, that's not something that you're capable of doing. Your approach needs to be accepting that they are there, and choosing not to respond to them. If a particular thought makes you uncertain about something, you need to accept that uncertainty. Don't look for reassurance.   I'd recommend looking into meditation practice, that will give you a chance to practice accepting your thoughts and not responding to them. A good book to read is Wherever you go, there you are by Jon Kabat-Zin. It will introduce you to meditation and how you can begin performing it."

You have to understand that you're always going to be in control of your own behaviour, regardless of what your thoughts tell you.

Some times, when I get an intrusive thought, I start thinking ""does any one else with Pure O get these thoughts in this exact context too?"" and worry about whether or not the thought is true because the way it's spelled out in my mind is different than in some one else's... then the ruminating loop happens.

OCD,3c5kjm,endtabless,2,Sun Jul 5 00:39:12 2015 UTC,"I experience the same thing quite often daily. You are not going crazy, you are experiencing something known as depersonalization/derealization. It is often a byproduct of intense anxiety, which can of course be brought on by OCD. I can tell you however from my experience that it can be absolute hell, but I can also tell you that it does go away with time. Although it is going to be near impossible at first, accept the feelings as they are and just sit with them, grab the bull by the horns so to speak. Now, this isn't going to be a night/day endeavor, this will probably take a while, but as you get more involved with your daily activities, responsibilities, social gatherings, etc. the feelings will start to fade away. The fact that you are constantly aware of your distorted state of consciousness fuels it and keeps it going. It's also true (and may be of some comfort for you to know) that just your posting this here shows you have a grounding in reality and are looking for real people to help you. One more suggestion, I'm not sure of your habits, but I do know that certain substances such as marijuana, alcohol, and even caffeine can induce or exacerbate the condition, so it would definitely be best to stay away from them. Psychedelics even more so as they are known for completely shattering one's ego.

OCD,3c5kjm,Dalekette,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:19:22 2015 UTC,Try squeezing an ice cube. It can give you something to focus on and ground you.
OCD,3c5kjm,kteich,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely do some research on depersonalization & derealization.    Then, look up mindfulness practice.  When you start feeling like the world isn't real, just focus on one of your senses at a time.  What do I see?  Blue... blue pillow... What does it feel like?  Soft... fuzzy...  What do I hear?  The sound of my computer buzzing, the traffic outside... What does my body feel like in this chair?  Heavy against the cloth...the chair supports my weight etc.  Go through each of your senses slowly.  Also, check that you are sleeping on a regular schedule.  If you are experiencing any type of sleep disorder, you should speak with a sleep specialist.  Insomnia, hypersomnia, or irregular naps throughout the day will make this problem much worse.  Most importantly, when this feeling happens, don't freak out.  You are not going insane.  You are fine.  Tell yourself: This is just an anxiety/stress reaction.  It's okay, and I'm going to be fine.  Just breathe and focus on your senses and what's happening in the moment and you will start to feel better.  Please be sure you are working closely with a counselor and a psychiatrist.  There are a number of medications (Buspar is a great one) that can really help you with this problem."
OCD,3c4qtt,pfool,2,Sat Jul 4 19:43:16 2015 UTC,"I've been there. Complete with irrational fears. My personal recommendation: exposure.   When I was a kid I had an intense fear of becoming demonically possessed (I watched the Exorcist at 7, not smart). That movie terrified me and I was convinced if I watched it, read about it, listed to people talk about it, I would become possessed. At 13, years removed from the initial fears, I sat down with a friend and watched that movie at least 5 times. It helped that I was determined not to freak out in front of my friend. I watched that movie after that even more times, any chance I got until I found it funny. Hilarious even.   If you can stand it, set aside times to touch those items from boarding school and try not to wash afterwards. Make sure you're in a comfortable space where you're not afraid to freak out if you need to. Treat it like holding an ice cube in your hand, it doesn't feel good but its not going to kill you. Eventually you become numb to the sensation and you can experience holding it without even caring that it's there.  Do this as many times as you can until the fear seems irrational and your mind understands that its inconsequential. I think exposure therapy is highly effective with OCD.   This is my experience. Grit your teeth and dive in until the whole concept of touching those items seems absurd.   Best of luck and many prayers!"
OCD,3c4qtt,opheliareads,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:16:46 2015 UTC,"Sound advice thanks, lots of people have recommended immersing myself in these items until, like you said, it becomes absurd. I think ill just have to start small and build up. face my issue head on. Thanks again."
OCD,3c4qtt,ZoticusTurpin,2,Sat Jul 4 22:02:41 2015 UTC,"I can actually understand this. In my experience, i just threw the shit away."
OCD,3c4qtt,JujuSpammer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've thrown countless things away that could have been used and were in no need of throwing away in the traditional sense but in my mind just the things made me fucking anxious to have around. I know deep down how irrational it is, but it provided temporary relief to just rid of it.   Problem is, everything that these items touch, I feel for whatever reason get contaminated or infected in a sense. Like somehow they're now associated with it. For example my car, I sold it purely because it has my school shit in there. No need for that. But yet I felt I had to."
OCD,3c4qtt,Here_We_Go_Start,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:13:42 2015 UTC,"A simple ERP approach would be suitable here. This is going to seem very obvious, but you can overcome this by deliberate touching those items, and then not engaging in any compulsive behaviours to cancel that out.  There really isn't a need to analyse this any further, you don't need anything more complex than that simple exposure exercise. That can actually be common with OCD, you think that the problem you're having is going to require a complex solution, when most of the time you just need to make a simple change in your behaviour.  So right now when you do touch them, you need to wash your hands afterwards. What you need to do is to deliberately touch them, and then refrain from washing your hands afterwards. You'll feel very anxious, the urge to wash will be very strong. You have to persist with not washing, or any other compulsive behaviour you might do after exposing to the items. As long as you keep doing this everytime, that anxiety will slowly decrease. There's no reason why you can't beat this compulsion, it's quite simple to beat, just follow this simple strategy. It will work with a lot of compulsive behaviours, exposing to the thing that provokes your anxiety and then not performing any actions to try to alleviate that anxiety."
OCD,3c4qtt,ButteredBabies,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:08:07 2015 UTC,"I think the immersion that everyone has suggested makes sense. But I also think that your title for this question alone shows that you're on your way to getting over it.  Just keep telling yourself it's a ridiculous fear -- not to shame yourself, but to know that you can survive and move on and nothing bad will happen to you.   This is a simplistic solution, of course, and I've had many people tell me that about many obsessions/compulsions in the past. But if you can look at it from the outside, it can help you start to shake a particular fear off -- especially once that you can disprove immediately."
OCD,3c66ek,ThrowAway4567723,2,Sun Jul 5 05:11:33 2015 UTC,"Don't let fear hold you back from seeking treatment. Right now you're caught in the cycle of OCD, obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours dominate your life. You've recognised this as a problem, and now it's time to take steps to fix it.   Seeking help is always hard. It's scary. You have all kinds of doubts, you think that it might not work or that it will somehow make your condition worse. The whole process seems so daunting, it would probably take years to see any results anyway, so what's the point?   You have all of these things holding you back from reaching out for help, but if you really want to improve, you'll have to face all of them and take that leap. If you feel scared, anxious or whatever, accept those feelings, don't try to get rid of them. Just go out and get help.   OCD is treatable, plenty of people have succeeded in cutting out their compulsive behaviours. There are professionals who will guide you through the whole thing, who will teach you the skills you need to overcome the morbid situation you're in right now. Once you start recovering and taking back your life from OCD, you'll regret not having started sooner. So start right now, face your fears and seek help."
OCD,3c64q5,wtfisgoingonasdf,3,Sun Jul 5 04:47:33 2015 UTC,"Trying to figure out the cause is a waste of time and energy. What matters is that you stop performing the compulsive behaviour, which is touching your chest.   Just look at it in a very simple way, you have a thought in your head which provokes the urge for you to touch your chest. If you don't touch it, you'll feel uncomfortable, the thoughts will become more persistent. Eventually, you can't stand this anymore so you give in and touch your chest. This gives you temporary relief, until the next time the cycle repeats.   The only way to break the cycle is to stop engaging in the compulsive behaviour. When you try this, you'll feel high anxiety, the urge will be very strong. You must persist in not touching your chest, accepting the unpleasant feelings that come with that. Make sure you do this every time, and it will gradually become easier and less unbearable."
OCD,3c4kfs,Eeazt,2,Sat Jul 4 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"It's hard to understand exactly what you're trying to describe. It seems like some surreal feeling that you had.   It's probably best to move on from it, you can spend a lot of time trying to understand these things, or you can recognise that they happened and that they're in the past now, and just move on from them.   If OCD is starting to dominate your life, the answer is to seek help. Speak to a doctor, explain to them your symptoms, and they will start you on the path to getting better. Actually, don't even explicitly state that you have OCD. Just explain to them what you've been going through in terms of the thoughts and feelings you've been experiencing, and the kinds of behaviours you've been engaging in."
OCD,3c47b6,Walkietalkie4000,5,Sat Jul 4 16:45:45 2015 UTC,"The key is to not respond to the thoughts. You tried to grab the banana, that's bad, don't do that again. It's quite simple really, you had the doubt of whether you can or can't do something, then you chose to perform an action to be certain. Well really, you already knew that you couldn't grab it, but you tried to anyway.   It seems silly, but it can still be a very troubling compulsive behaviour if you keep practicing it. If you keep checking and checking, eventually when you try not to check, you will experience high anxiety and a very strong urge to check. A lot of compulsive behaviours are silly, but they still ruin people's lives, so they still need to be taken seriously.   When you experience these doubts, don't respond to them. That will break the cycle of responding to thoughts through checking behaviours. If not checking makes you anxious, you just have to accept that. It's better to accept anxiety than to engage in compulsive behaviours."
OCD,3c47b6,JujuSpammer,2,Sun Jul 5 03:31:53 2015 UTC,Welp. It's so hard to not respond to the thoughts. I have OCD regarding contamination and I'm just stressed that I'm going to slowly kill everyone around me as I'm a veritable door through which contamination enters. How do I deal with that?
OCD,3c47b6,mydevilsride,3,Sun Jul 5 06:40:48 2015 UTC,"You deal with it by not looking to reassure yourself that what you fear isn't going to happen. If you try to ease that uncertainty and convince yourself that it's not going to happen, you'll keep performing compulsive behaviours. You'll get rid of the doubt for a little while, until it comes back again and you'll keep repeating the cycle.  Eventually this particular fear will go away, but something else will take its place. You see, it's all about the pattern of experiencing doubt and then looking to erase it by seeking certainty. It will keep going on like this until you stop dealing with doubts by looking to get rid of them, and that requires you to stop performing compulsive behaviours.  Treatment for OCD has never been about stopping the obsessive thoughts from occurring, the strategy is always to accept those thoughts, to let them be in your head. What you need to focus on doing is not responding to these thoughts through behaviours which look to erase doubts or ease your anxiety. These are called compulsive behaviours, and stopping these is the key to beating the OCD cycle.  I'd recommend seeing a therapist about this, they can guide you through the process of cutting out compulsions, and teach you the proper way of dealing with the thoughts in your head."
OCD,3c47b6,JujuSpammer,2,Sun Jul 5 09:21:52 2015 UTC,"I mean, OCD at its core is basically a tug of war between reality vs. the unreal. The logical side (you) knows the laws of reality, but the irrational side (OCD) doesn't care what the laws of reality are. Add to this that OCD causes things known as cognitive distortions and it starts to get very messy, such as objects being imbued with properties (thought-object fusion) or unrealistic risk estimation."

OCD,3c3a0j,Calathe,2,Sat Jul 4 10:00:36 2015 UTC,"This is something that definitely varies depending on individual experiences. I'd certainly love to go back five years and educate myself about the diversity of OCD and learn that I had it earlier. However, I don't think I've had a net positive experience. Sure, therapy has improved my people skills but it's not worth the cyclic drain of my life and watching hours of my life slip away every day in the name of rituals and obsessions."

OCD,3c3a0j,anon0108,2,Sat Jul 4 15:20:48 2015 UTC,"The thing is, if you could take back the time, but when you went back you just started behaving in the same way that you do now, you would just wind up with OCD all over again.  OCD isn't some physical thing that is crawling around your body, like some virus that you've contracted from somewhere. OCD is a label that describes your behaviour in response to the thoughts and feelings you experience everyday. OCD is the way that you choose to respond when you're faced with uncertainty and doubt. OCD is the things that you feel obliged to do, that if you don't do will make you very uncomfortable.   Is there a genetic component to OCD? Are some people predisposed to it because of the nature of their brain? Probably, in fact I'm sure there is some correlation between the two. But that doesn't mean that you can't change anything about your situation. That doesn't mean that you can't learn to behave differently when faced with the things that provoke your compulsive behaviours.   I don't recommend growing attached to OCD. This is called stockholm syndrome, it's a big barrier to recovery. Sure, you can accept OCD as part of who you are. You say that you're functional, I believe you, I was fully functional through the many years I suffered from OCD. No, I wasn't sad or anxious all the time. I can recall plenty of pleasant memories from that time, even when my illness was at its very worst.   And now I no longer engage in compulsive behaviours, but I'm not happy all of the time. I experience anxiety, sadness, anger, I have obsessive thoughts, doubts, whatever else.   Would I ever go back to engaging in those behaviours? I can say quite confidently that I wouldn't, because I know for a fact that my mental health now is much better than it was back then. I don't need to avoid anything anymore, I don't need to be afraid of what thoughts my brain is going to have on that day, or what feelings I'm going to experience. I don't have to worry about doing things that I know I don't want or need to do, just because I feel the urge to do them.   It's not like I've become a completely different person, there are a lot of things about me that are the same as they've always been. What I have done is change the way I respond to my thoughts, feelings, because they way I was behaving before was clearly problematic. And I'm still changing things today, recovery isn't something that ends, you really have to keep working on it everyday for the rest of your life.  But you have to be willing to change, and having the mindset that OCD isn't that bad will hold you back from that. Don't think of recovery as changing everything about who you see yourself to be. See it as cutting out unhealthy things from your life. You're still the same person, but you're learning to behave in a different way. That way the idea of change won't seem as scary."
OCD,3c3a0j,JujuSpammer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:53:46 2015 UTC,"OCD isn't actually a mindset or thought pattern. OCD is an anxiety disorder for which we don't know complete cure and we treat it by using CBT.   If it was behavioural by its nature, then our intrusive thoughts would stop after successful CBT. But they don't. We just learn to accept them and to react to them."
OCD,3c3a0j,ocdsuckss,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:30:40 2015 UTC,"Learning to accept thoughts and not reacting to them is definitely the correct strategy.

OCD,3c3kre,Here_We_Go_Start,3,Sat Jul 4 12:47:34 2015 UTC,"I do this exact same thing! My obsessions change every several years. When I was a kid it was my parents dying. (I used to sneak into their rooms and watch them breath when they were sleeping - yeah) When I got older and was sexually active for the first time it was unintended pregnancy. (We used spermicidal condoms, spermicide, I wore a sponge, and was on birth control) and I took a pregnancy test if my period was even 30 mins later than I thought it would be. Then it was my boyfriend leaving me. Then it was a different boyfriend leaving me.   The latest obsession is with sleep and it is by far the worst. I won't get into that because I don't want to ""infect"" anyone else with that line of thought.   I have peace in the knowledge that in a year or 2 it will change again. That kind of thinking only serves to reinforce how absurd our obsessions are."

OCD,3bzyti,pepper_tea,5,Fri Jul 3 14:58:44 2015 UTC,"It's very common. It's like when a hostage develops Stockholm Syndrome. Even when I could see OCD was destroying my life, I could always think of reasons to engage in compulsions. It helped a lot to stop listening to myself. My mind was obviously on the side of the kidnappers so it would think up all of these reasons why escaping would be scarier than staying hostage. Don't listen to it. Freedom is awesome."
OCD,3bzyti,mark_freeman,4,Fri Jul 3 18:42:28 2015 UTC,"That's not what accepting thoughts means. Accepting a thought that has unpleasant content or says something that you don't identify with doesn't mean believing that thought to be true. It just means allowing the thought to be in your head, not making a deliberate attempt to understand why the thought is there and not trying to remove it from your head.  You're basically recognising that no matter the content of your thoughts, they are merely intangible things that exist solely in your brain. You recognise that they can't influence the way you behave, and that they don't change your underlying beliefs and values.  With this understanding, you allow yourself to experience thoughts without wanting to run away from them. When an unpleasant thought comes to you, you don't try to get rid of it, you don't engage with it in any way. If the presence of the thought comes with any unpleasant feelings, such as anxiety, you accept those feelings without trying to get rid of them.  This is a much more healthy and sustainable way of dealing with your thoughts, rather than dwelling on them or trying to find a way to stop them from occuring. You have to practice this strategy consistently to get better at it, and it's quite hard to do at first, but like with anything you will gradually become better at applying it."

And the whole point, as much as it hurts, is to accept that your fear could be a possibility.   I'm afraid I am gonna randomly turn into a lesbian, despite the fact that I know I'm attracted to men and despite the fact that I love my boyfriend. Three months ago, I was afraid either I or my boyfriend were going to get into a terrible accident and die while we were at work for the day. I had to text him multiple times throughout the day to make sure he was all right. I just move from thing to thing, and it's horrible.  And as much as I'd hate to suddenly ""find out"" that I am a lesbian and I didn't know this entire time, I know I have to face that fear. The more I accept it nay or may not be trur, the more relief I get and the further away these thoughts become."

Natural sleep is always the best.   If you have obsessive thoughts when you're going to bed, try not to engage with them. Don't let yourself go in circles in your head, thinking about whatever it is. Let the thoughts hang in your head, let yourself experience any anxiety that comes with them. It's dangerous to try to get rid of anxiety, even if you don't like the feeling.

OCD,3bxq57,TEFL22,4,Fri Jul 3 01:51:05 2015 UTC,"I want to start meditating but I am afraid of opening a door I can't close.   I was afraid of the same thing. Like, fearing I was going to tap into my ""true gay self"" and not want to be with my boyfriend any more. But instead I realized that I fear losing my boyfriend and generally my attraction/love for men.   What you have to remember is that if there is something you're afraid of, you need to address it. Fear is the first sign that you need to do something about it - so my only advice would be to start slow and don't expect results on your first day. It takes practice, and always remember to go back to listening to your breath. Personally, I like to imagine what I sound like when I breathe in and out because that helps me keep track of the breath.  Hope that helped!"

It may be significantly cheaper and easier to get an appointment. Also, a therapist can recommend a good psychiatrist to you if you don't have one already."
OCD,3bwz3t,ha_ya,2,Fri Jul 3 03:16:57 2015 UTC,A lot of therapist who think they treat OCD have no clue how to actually treat OCD.  We went to 3 therapist who said they treat it but actually have no clue how to do it.  Go to the International OCD Foundation's website (www.iocdf.org) to find a proper therapist.

You're the second person who has told me that weed has no effect on their disorder, maybe it's just me!   That's interesting, because weed does make me feel paranoid, but in a way that I'm like, ""Oh, I'm just high! My brain is a dirty fucking liar. I really don't have anything to actually worry about."" So it's kind of a ""fun paranoia"" to me, like dreaming but you know you're dreaming. And this gives me a very healthy perspective on my anxieties when I am not high. ""Oh, I suddenly feel the need to wash my hands?"" I think back to when I've been high and felt paranoid. ""Oh, it's just my brain being a dick, just like that time I was high!""  At least that's how it helps me :)"

In fact, I'M HIGH RIGHT NOW! It only happens when I'm doing something and ""forget"" that I'm high. Like if I fall asleep and wake up, or if I'm playing a game and then look around the room. I have to be reallllly high for that to happen though."

OCD,3bwv8l,iamaguyhere,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:30:52 2015 UTC,"the same way you get rid of them normally. accepting that they are there. if a thought turns you on that is unpleasant, don't analyze it, even if it's fucked up. accept that it happened and that's that. there is a huge difference between enjoying a fantasy, and actually doing it.   of course a ""groinal response"" is just a brain function, but a lot of people with sexual obsessions do end up getting actual sexual feelings. A ""normal"" person doesn't care, because they know they're just silly thoughts and they wouldn't actually do them, but it really fucks with us who have OCD."
OCD,3bwv8l,yeahmynameisbrian,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:29:58 2015 UTC,Hi! Can you expand on the first sentence in your second paragraph please?
OCD,3bwv8l,pepper_tea,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:54:54 2015 UTC,"There is ""functional"" responses, like if you think of your groin area and you feel a sexual feeling. This does not mean you are attracted to a certain situation, it's just your brain thinking about that area.   However, when a person has a sexual obsession (worrying that you're into something fucked up or wrong) it's likely that they will end up getting turned on by that situation. Why? Because you're constantly thinking about it, getting these groin responses, they come up when you're doing sexual things, you get compulsions to actually think about it to check if you're actually into it or not, etc. etc. This is another example as to why people should not reassure themselves ""I'm not into this, it's OCD"". It just sets you up for failure. You have to accept that maybe you do like something fucked up sexually. It doesn't mean you would actually do it, it just means you have a fantasy that includes something you find terrible.   I talked about it in one of my comments, you can read that for more information as well."

OCD,3bxws6,carriemybeloved,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:48:42 2015 UTC,What was behind your obsession with unplugging things? Was it driven by some sort of anxiety that it's dangerous to leave things plugged in?
OCD,3bxws6,ha_ya,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:18:06 2015 UTC,"It's not helpful to ask whether something is OCD or not. OCD is just a medical label for certain patterns of behaviour that individuals engage in. Different OCD sufferers can have completely different sets of obsessions and compulsions, in fact every person with OCD has a completely unique set of symptoms.   Getting to attached to the label of OCD can start to mould your behaviour into a certain way. You will think that you have to do certain things simply because you have OCD, things that you wouldn't otherwise do if you weren't aware of the condition alltogether.   The best way to look at a particular behaviour is to work out whether it's something that you value, if it's helping you or causing you problems. If you identify that it's problematic, then you start taking the steps to sort out the behaviour."
OCD,3bxws6,JujuSpammer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:00:32 2015 UTC,"I think that this behavior is very helpful. Like I said, it helps to minimize anxiety :)!

OCD,3bwpud,trixiecat,2,Thu Jul 2 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"I had this problem.  Tried multiple SSRIs. Eventually got switched over to Anafranil which is a tryciclic antidepressant. It's used mainly for treating OCD. It has cut down my nightmares massively.  Been on it for more than two years, 50mg three times a day. The biggest downside is the weight gain. It's a killer. My advice would be that if you do go on it, watch your weight. I left it go and ended up gaining two stone. I found I just couldn't satisfy my appetite. For me though, being a woman and very unhappy about my current weight, I still feel the positives of this medication outweighs the good.  Any questions about them let me know!

Try to be very unreasonable with OCD, don't accept a certain amount of compulsions into your life. If you do that, you might find that they blow out of control again if you go through some exceptional circumstances. Aim to completely eradicate unhealthy behaviours from your life, and make it your goal to be healthy and live within your values every single day. Remember, recovery is ongoing, it's not a certain point that you reach where you can then stop working on it. It's great to read about your progress, you have improved your mental health significantly through hard work and persistence."
OCD,3bwndo,passwordismypetsname,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"Your compulsive behaviour is the complete opposite of the stereotype of organisation that is commonly associated with OCD. It just shows that OCD is very complex and that it can manifest itself in many different ways for different people.  What kind of therapy are you doing at the moment? Normal talking therapy isn't very effective for OCD, what works better is learning how to stop responding to obsessive thoughts through compulsive behaviours. A very successful strategy for achieving this is Exposure and Response Prevention. If you're not doing that at the moment, definitely look into starting it.  In very simple terms, you'll have to identify your compulsive behaviours, for you that is deliberate messing up things that you find too ordered. You then expose yourself to the situations where you would usually perform this behaviour, but you refuse to engage in it. This will make you feel very anxious, but you'll have to fight on through this feeling to teach yourself to not perform the compulsive actions. A very fundamental way of dealing with compulsive behaviours, works extremely effectively, just takes practice from you."

OCD,3buv00,anon0108,2,Thu Jul 2 10:31:39 2015 UTC,"See a doctor about your symptoms. You can learn to get better, to stop engaging in the behaviours that keep your poor mental health going.

OCD,3bussg,biopolthrow,2,Thu Jul 2 09:23:58 2015 UTC,"Recovery isn't something that is supposed to stop. Maybe you thought that at one point you had come out of the illness for good, and now you have noticed the same problems creeping up again, and this is putting you off. This is quite common, I went through the exact same thing on my road to recovery.  It all comes down to practice. Once you learn the skills on how to handle thoughts and emotions in a healthy way, you have to practice those skills every single day. This is hard. It's much easier to practice coping, seeking reassurance, ruminating, checking and all the other things commonly associated with OCD. That's because you're used to practicing those things, you're quite good at them.  I think the best thing for you to do now is to start identifying the compulsive behaviours that you're engaging in on a daily basis. Think of the behaviours that you perform to get rid of doubts, to try to reduce unpleasant feelings such as anxiety. These are the things that you can work on fixing.   I think you'll benefit from a complete overhaul in the way you approach the thoughts in your head and the way that you feel. A book that I strongly recommend is The Happiness Trap by Russell Harris. It goes over the concept of learning to accept the way you feel and learning to not let your thoughts dominate your behaviour. It helped me a lot and I think it will do the same for you."

And yet I'm living a fairly regular life with only visits to the doctor or psychiatrist every three or four months or so.    It can be done.  Would you like to have someone with whom to converse on a regular basis who knows the ins and outs of OCD?  If so, please do message me.

We all have violent thoughts from time to time -- whether we're OCD or not -- but if you can acknowledge the thoughts and then laugh at whatever demon inside that is creating them, you can know that you can control your actions and they can't win.  Try new medication. See a new doctor. Believe in yourself. Try to pull out of the trip -- no amount of money is worth this sort of torture, and being alone is the worst thing for OCD, because you wallow in it.

What makes you certain that you're a pedophike?  These are some questions to ask yourself and seriously think about before you start labeling yourself.  How do I know I'm not a pedophile? These thoughts and ruminations make me feel like I'm gonna puke, even with the groinal response. I don't think a pedophile would have nausea, cold flushes, and the sensation that you want to scream. Ultimately I think a pedophile would experience some kind of pleasure and not this horrid feeling of close to death.  That's my two cents. Make of it what you will."
OCD,3btzbj,pepper_tea,2,Thu Jul 2 03:46:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply.   I wrote you a long message back, something about Dakota Fanning, and soon after realised that I'd written it on a wrong account, panicked, didn't remember passwords for anything for a while and cried a bit over disastrous tifu. It got my mind out of the loop for the moment so I guess that's alright then. I still know that slip up is going to haunt me for a long time.  But yeah, I ask those things of myself all the time and everyday and I'm pretty sure it's not very helpful. Looking into past, my mind can just as well make up memories and feelings to suit which ever option I choose. I'm not sure that if I was a pedophile, admitting it to myself would do any good for me or anyone else.  I think everyone is capable of horrible things and great things. I have real troble with trying to figure out which actions would lead me down a good timeline. I won't one day wake up wanting to molest children. But what if the change is gradual and I only notice it when it's too late? What if the groinal response is just arousal after I stop being afraid? What if I decide that I deserve to be a happy pedophile, starting to chase this feeling, telling myself it's alright, surrounding myself with people who all think this is alright and good?  I just can't move like this. I can't do anything because it might all go wrong."
OCD,3btzbj,JujuSpammer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:22:13 2015 UTC,"The problem is that there are some things that are just so fundamental, and thinking about them can confuse you and is not productive at all.   Attraction is one of those things. When you're attracted to someone or something, you sort of just know that you are. You don't need to consciously think to work out if you are attracted to it. It's something that comes to you.  What you're doing is going around in circles, trying to reach a point of 100% certainty about what you are. It's very obvious that you don't see yourself as a pedophile, and that's clearly the conclusion you want to reach. What bothers you is the alternative, what if you are?   One thing is for sure, what you're doing right now is not working. Constantly obsessing over this topic is only serving to bother you and wear you out. The only logical thing to do is to stop engaging in that rumination. It's not getting you anywhere. That's really hard, being able to accept a doubt in your mind about something that is very important to you, and not responding to it. The only way to get better at it is to practice it everyday.   So you need to accept the uncertainty, maybe you are or maybe you're not. This is what you're struggling with at the moment, but it's what you need to do. Don't engage with the thoughts, don't go over it in your head trying to convince yourself of what it is you want to be. Don't seek reassurance from others either. This is actually a very simple approach but it's challenging because you will experience a lot of anxiety and the urge to perform your compulsive behaviours will be very strong. But you're teaching yourself to accept a doubt without wanting to get rid of it, and that's extremely valuable and will help you a lot over the course of your life."
OCD,3btzbj,ocdsuckss,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:01:59 2015 UTC,"If you were pedophile, you'll know it by now. And yeah, those people are anxious about being pedophile, they know they are pedophile, they accepted it even though they wish they could change it.  On the other hand, you're anxious OVER POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING PEDOPHILE. Thing with OCD is that makes you believe you are becoming gay/murderer/rapist whatever triggers you. But no, OCD in fact makes you fear you'll become one of those things. At the moment, you're obviously not a pedophile, and chances you'll become one are like 0%. Because you don't become that over night.  You have severe OCD, go and seek help from professional  EDIT: And even virtous pedophiles don't feel anxiety or need to puke when thinking about children"

OCD,3bsetz,yeahmynameisbrian,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:29:57 2015 UTC,"ahh okay. well, the general treatment for OCD is for him to stop doing the compulsions. He has obsessions, and he can't control that, but he can control how he reacts to them. Even analyzing an obsession, or reassuring (""This is just OCD, I do not have a disease"") is a compulsion, and should not be done."
OCD,3bsetz,Duckmeister,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:41:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it's time to stage an intervention.  You have to tell him in plain language that you are not happy with the current relationship and you want him to seek treatment.  In my experience, he will probably ignore you at first and just ask if you're giving him an ultimatum.  You have to redirect that by asking him if he wants you to be happy and if he's willing to put in the effort to make the relationship work.  There are two kinds of ""breaking up"" fears: one is where you are afraid that any little thing you do or say could cause the person to leave without warning (common with OCD), and the other is where you are waiting for the other person to get tired of your flaws.  The second, in my opinion, is incredibly selfish.  It takes two to make a relationship work, and if one is not willing to change to meet the needs of their partner then that is a huge red flag for me.  Sure, he may able to live with himself untreated, but it is an entirely different story to live with someone else.  You have to air your concerns in a firm manner, people with ingrained tendencies generally don't get the hint.  You may try asking why he is not willing to seek treatment.  There may be a reason (past experience with a bad therapist, some kind of religious conviction, no insurance/it won't fit in the budget...) that you may not be aware of.  But you have to have a heart-to-heart conversation with him to find out; the last thing you want to do is hint and nudge and poke until you get so frustrated that you just explode at him.  I hope this was helpful, and I hope you guys can work it out!"
OCD,3bsetz,Ronald--Raygun,2,Wed Jul 1 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your insight, I do appreciate it.  I do agree with you that it takes two to make a relationship work, and feel that we'd be stronger supports for each other if we're both actively seeking to get well.  I don't feel that he is refusing treatment with any malicious intent or is trying to sabotage the relationship.  Rather, I think he may be too fearful of the changes he would need to make.  I stated in another reply that he has in fact had several negative experiences with therapists in the past, so I do understand his hesitation.  I think I will take your advice though and perhaps take a more direct approach."
OCD,3bsetz,JujuSpammer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:35:41 2015 UTC,"Is he in disbelief that there is something wrong with him? Because I know that when I get wrapped up in my head I need what I want to know or have. I really believe in what I feel and I can step back objectively and see how crazy I'm acting, but in that moment I need the relief. I don't want to be told that I can see the doctor in a couple weeks and start taking meds that will be secretly giving me cancer secondary to the 4-6 weeks of waiting. Having what I want, my frustrations removed, is like the most potent drug I've ever taken.  That being said,  I've always felt that people like myself, people who live mentally ill, spend more time pondering and looking at things objectively. If he is able to see that the world doesn't operate the way his mind predicts, (seeing as how he is able to support you) maybe he can understand that it would help you if he were to get help.   I know getting treatment is unnerving, and if medication rubs him wrong, talking to a therapist, (CBT) would be a good first step.  Let him know that you don't want him to do anything that makes him unhappy, but it would make you happy if he would at least try it. This might be something you have to ask/approach in more than one way or at different times. Tell him that you trust him to take care of you, and he should trust you to do what you think will help him."

I'll be honest, though I have a pretty solid understanding of anxiety as a whole (I've spent the better part of 20 years coping with it) my understanding of OCD is limited.  I think that feeds into my frustration a little bit, so I do appreciate your insight."
OCD,3bsetz,anon0108,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:39:09 2015 UTC,"I think that if he refuses to seek help from a professional, a good approach might be to work with him on helping him get better. Maybe he doesn't believe in getting help, he might think it's a waste of time. It is possible to overcome mental health issues without seeking help, and I think that might be a good strategy here.  What you can do with him is to sit down and identify the compulsive behaviours he is engaging in. He needs to work on cutting these out, that is the core aspect of OCD recovery, stopping compulsive behaviours. This process is actually quite simple, it requires you to expose to the situation that triggers your fear and refuse to perform the deliberate behaviour/s to alleviate that anxiety. It's simple, but it's very hard. It takes a lot of practice and persistence.   I think however for any of this to work, he really has to be willing to get better. The problem is that only he can commit to that, no-one else can really force it on to him. Just try to push the idea to him that it's worth it to try to cut out his unhealthy behaviours, that it will make his life much better. OCD can make you very negative, it's a mental illness afterall so it generally leads in that direction. Try to get him to do little things everyday to improve, he might think that's it's too big of a challenge and that might put him off recovery.   Here's an idea, identify just one compulsion that he engages in and work on cutting it out. If you succeed with this, he will see for himself that he can in fact change his own behaviour. That might motivate him to take it further and cut out more unhealthy behaviours."

That's going to be very hard, but if you keep responding to guilt through compulsive actions then you'll continue going in a vicious cycle.   Try not to ruminate about what may or may not happen as a result of your actions. Practice letting the uncertainty exist in your head, don't look to get rid of it. Constantly wanting to alleviate uncertainty is the driving force of OCD."

Step one would be to try to calm yourself if you can. Take some deep breaths. Step two is to find a therapist that you can talk to about this. I can't diagnose you, no one here can. You need to find professional help for that. Be truthful about what you're feeling, don't lie to the doctor. That helps no one. Step three is  between you and the doctor.  There is help out there and there is hope. Try chatting in the OCD chatroom or call the Suicide hotline if need be, but don't give up."

OCD,3bppa7,Blueomen,4,Wed Jul 1 03:49:43 2015 UTC,"I do agree with your therapist that it's more important to focus on the solution rather than the problem. You've identified that a particular behaviour that is problematic for you, so now you can work on fixing it.   What you're describing is quite common for people with OCD, you're engaging in mental rumination to reassure yourself of something that you're doubting. Even if you seem absolutely certain, you continue to doubt yourself and seek further reassurance.   The way to overcome this is to practice not engaging in the compulsive behaviour. You need to be able to experience the doubt without looking to be sure of it. Refuse to think about it, don't go checking things, don't seek reassurance from others. You'll experience a lot of anxiety but you have to persist with this approach in order to cut out the compulsive behaviour.   You can't just do this with your current doubts however. You have to make sure that with any new uncertainties that you experience in the future, that you respond in the same way, not looking to alleviate the doubt. This is to ensure that you don't come back to the same problem again later on."
OCD,3bppa7,JujuSpammer,3,Wed Jul 1 07:33:17 2015 UTC,"See a different therapist. You might have OCD, you might not, but your therapist is bullshit. Diagnosing people isn't just to put them into a box, it helps in treating the condition.  You might want to see a psychologist/psychiatrist because therapists/counselors cannot diagnose people/make medical decisions."
OCD,3bppa7,Dragonache,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:57:17 2015 UTC,"Hey! You might not be getting a response because of the rules in the sidebar:   RULES: 1. Do not ask /r/OCD for medical advice. Including: asking for a diagnosis, self-diagnosis confirmation, or opinions as to whether you have OCD. 2. Do not give medical advice or attempt to diagnose other users. For more information, please see reddit's user agreement and this post.   If you're like me, though, it's very helpful to have a name for the issues you're dealing with (so you can research, seek out a community, etc). The best I can recommend is highlighting how important this is for you the next time you're in a financial position to attend therapy, or seeking out a psych who may be willing to specifically diagnose you."
OCD,3bpm03,KimKline,2,Wed Jul 1 03:19:44 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying with being defensive. OCD afterall is just a pattern of behaviour, a pattern that the sufferer has developed and is practicing everyday. Even if they recognise that those behaviours are problematic and have a desire to get rid of them, they can still feel some attachment to them, and that can make it harder to let them go.  Recovering from OCD requires the person to throw out a lot of beliefs and judgements that they held on to for a long time. This is troubling I guess because it implies that what the person was doing that entire time was wrong. This is logical however, afterall you're trying to overcome a mental disorder. If the behaviors you were engaging in previously were perfectly fine and healthy, you wouldn't be looking to change them in the first place.   Overcoming OCD requires you to release your ego, to let go of the ideas that you held up to that point, to prioritise improving your own mental health over anything else. Afterall, recovery is all about change, and you have to put yourself in a state that is ready to accept change."

OCD,3bomaf,rgaona,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:00:38 2015 UTC,"You need to change your approach to the thoughts you experience. Perhaps at the moment your response is to engage with your thoughts and try to work out their meaning and why they are in your head. This can make you go in circles for hours and it is very agitating.   The skill that you need to learn is to be able to experience doubts without needing to respond to them. Let's say you have a thought that tells you that you are homosexual. You have to be able to accept that uncertainty, accept that it may be the case, or not, and don't delve deeper into the topic. Don't ruminate and try to convince yourself that you are or you aren't. Don't seek reassurance from other sources to alleviate your doubt.

OCD,3bmt3f,SirHumphryDavy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:04:01 2015 UTC,"The problem is that you're trying to get rid of anxiety. Anxiety is not something you should try to not experience, rather you should accept when you're anxious and not let that feeling stop you from doing what you want to do.  Recovering from OCD doesn't mean getting rid of anxiety or no longer having doubts and obsessive thoughts in your head. What it really requires is for you to stop engaging in the deliberate compulsive actions that you undertake to alleviate these symptoms. That's what ERP is all about, exposing to your triggers and not performing the compulsive behaviours that continue the cycle of OCD.  So what you need to do now is to identify the compulsive behaviours you're engaging in and stop performing them. Don't worry if you're anxious, remember that you need to accept that feeling, not try to get rid of it. Focus on behaving in the right way at all times, that's what will let you sustain recovery."

OCD,3bmi5x,eg-er-ekki-islensku,2,Tue Jun 30 12:30:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to prepare yourself in any way. The key is to not avoid situations that you think will trigger your OCD, that's going to re-enforce the fear and limit you from doing the things you want to do.  I think if anything, needing to prepare yourself before doing something sounds like a compulsive behaviour, it's not something I'd recommend. Focus on not performing any reassuring or controlling behaviours when you're in that triggering situation, whether they are physical or mental behaviours. If you feel anxious, that's fine, don't try to alleviate that feeling. Make sure you don't do anything in an attempt to get rid of that anxiety.   If you keep exposing yourself to your feared situations, and refrain from performing any compulsive behaviours, you will gain confidence in being able to handle them in a healthy way. You just need to keep practicing."
OCD,3bmi5x,JujuSpammer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:53:53 2015 UTC,"You don't. I basically trust myself regardless. It takes a while but eventually you get to a point where you isolate ALL OCD thoughts. It can be hard to recognize what are and are not because for a while I didn't realize that thoughts that stemmed from the obvious were also OCD thoughts. I recommend identifying what it is that actually scares you about the trigger. Is it a fear of arousal? A fear of causing harm? Once you discover this, you can then begin to isolate it. This is definitely more doable with the help of therapy so if you're not already please seek therapy.   As for short term until you start to address that stuff. I still don't recommend having a ""prepare myself"" mindset because that in itself is an OCD way of thinking about it. It is you trying to control a threat. I recommend just going for it. You know who you really are not what OCD is saying and you know you will not cause any harm. You can when there try to let the thoughts flow past on a river in your head, these are thoughts and all thoughts that stem from those thoughts. Again, it can be hard to identify what those thoughts actually are so be aware of what they are and then you will be able to let them go. For me, I usually start by discovering what the thought is (for me, OCD thoughts are usually kind of like feeling or sub thoughts if that makes sense so it can be hard to notice what the thought is). I then bring it into my awareness by making it a thought I think consciously for a second and once I'm aware I can then let it go.   I hope all of this makes sense and can help you out :)"
OCD,3bn6zw,THE_CRUSTIEST,2,Tue Jun 30 15:56:11 2015 UTC,"OCD has a strong link with Tourrettes and other tic disorders. There is also a thing called TOCD (Tourettic OCD), which involves tics in relation to OCD.  I was diagnosed with OCD as a kid, but in later years I have also developed tics. I have never sought a diagnosis for a tic disorder, but I definitely have tics. (This fact was confirmed by a former psychologist.)  Tics and compulsions can sometimes be difficult to distinguish, but  like you said, tics are often characterized as involuntary - they just sort of happen when you aren't paying attention or aren't trying to suppress them. Many people prefer to call tics ""unvoluntary"" because they can be suppressed if you concentrate.  You could always try to ask /r/Tourettes if you want more information. Here's the post I made to /r/Tourettes a year ago, if you want that for reference.  If it's really bothering you, you can ask your doctor about it. Normally they have a neurologist check you out to confirm a diagnosis, and they don't normally give a dx for Tourettes if you're an adult because it's considered developmental. I've found that my tics are often not that bad, but if I don't have enough sleep, haven't eaten enough, have too much caffeine, or a lot of anxiety, they get worse. I also noticed that for me, taking magnesium supplements helps significantly, but I think I also might have a magnesium deficiency."
OCD,3bn6zw,Alwayswrite64,2,Wed Jul 1 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds very much like my experience - I've definitely developed more ticcy behaviours over time (head and facial twitches, hand shaking, little sounds), but I haven't found them serious or pervasive enough to bring them up. OP might wanna look into tourettic ocd if it's as serious as headshaking."
OCD,3bn6zw,djsnakesonaplane,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:46:47 2015 UTC,"I think that it's more likely a compulsive behaviour, something that you think you need to do to avoid feeling discomfort and anxiety. You say that you become uncomfortable when you resist the urge to perform it, until you eventually give in and do the behaviour. That sounds like the classic cycle of OCD at work.  I used to suffer from similar urges in the past, the way I dealt with it was to refuse alleviating any of the urges. What I found was that if there was a genuine need for me to stretch any part of my body, it would happen automatically without me needing to deliberate do it. I also noticed that some of the actions weren't happening on their own, and that indicated that those ones weren't necessary, and were just outright compulsive behaviours."
OCD,3bm2ng,eag99,2,Tue Jun 30 09:05:47 2015 UTC,"OCD interferes with every part of your life. That's why you should look to recover from the behaviours that prolong and sustain OCD.   There is often a perception that people with OCD are naturally engaging in compulsive behaviours, and that's nothing can be done about it. This is not true. Compulsive behaviours can be cut out with practice and exposure to your doubts and anxieties.   Pure-o is no different to any other form of OCD, it's just an additional label to describe the central themes that someone's OCD exists in. If you have OCD, there are deliberate actions that you are performing that are continuing the cycle, and the way to break that cycle is to stop performing those behaviours. This is where behavioural therapies like ERP come into play."

Ever. *Depression symptoms that go along with OCD, making me a boring and shitty person to be around at times *Moodswings when I'm not on my medication  *Nightmares, so we can't always sleep in the same bed comfortably *General weirdness about food, so they think I hate their cooking *And finally, even though some people consider OCD to be ""fashionable"", there's always those assholes who will avoid us like the plague because of the stigma of either being ""fucking psycho"", ""one of THOSE people"", or--my personal favorite--""A special snowflake who's making it up"". WAYYY more common than you might think.  Anyway, not much of this matters, as I've been with my partner for many years now, and we've got most of it under control, but if I were single, dating with this disorder would be hell.  I'm not sure why you're asking about this, but know that you shouldn't be blaming yourself for any of this. We know that some of our thoughts aren't rational, and that our brain likes to lie to us.

Just accept that you are anxious and don't let that stop you from doing what you wish to do.   Feelings will only bother you if you behave in a way that lets them have power over you. If you avoid doing things when you're anxious, or you try to get rid of your anxiety by performing compulsive behaviours, you're letting that anxiety control you, and you will keep fearing the feeling of anxiety.  If however you learn to experience anxiety and fully accept it, and not let it influence the way you behave, you will start to see it as just another feeling that doesn't have any real power over you.

So, before I went to see my therapist, I did a little research. I made sure, doubly sure in fact, that I was not molding myself to fit the symptoms. I went to my therapist and told him what I had been experiencing and what I thought.   Seek out a doctor that deals with OCD and has experience in treating it.

On top of that, in many cases SSRI medication is used to combat some symptoms of OCD and that medication is pretty much out of question should you not have an actual diagnosis done by a medical professional.   I don't go to the doctor because I feel too ashamed and embarrassed, but without the doctor I don't have a formal diagnosis and I can't really tell people I've got something that I haven't been diagnosed with.    That's how things usually go. I don't see the problem here though. Why would you need to be vocal about your (possible) mental illnesses?    What is even more annoying, is that I have a friend who has diagnosed OCD and when I have tried to tell them a few things they don't believe I've really ''got it'' or really have anything wrong with me, because they are the ones with the diagnosis/getting treatment.   Well yeah, having a mental illness of any sort isn't a pissing contest. At least it shouldn't be. If your main grievance is that others with actual diagnosis don't believe your claims, I'd say you've gotten off lightly.  At any rate, I'd suggest you talk to a medical professional so that you can get your things sorted out. You may or may not get a diagnosis but at least that's the first step towards getting treatment. And that should be the first priority when struggling with any illness."
OCD,3bmzj8,kegluneq,2,Tue Jun 30 19:46:14 2015 UTC,"A lot of it stems from when I first did seek help, I encountered a doctor who was incredibly rude and made me feel crap. I tried to explain a little bit what was going on but he'd cut across me constantly and made me feel like I was just some sullen sulky teenager with mood swings. He then sent me for a blood test and that was all. It wasn't until I persisted that I actually got help in the right places, and then I clammed up when I did have an actual psychiatrist in front of me; my own fault I suppose, but being 14 years old with POCD thoughts is NOT something I felt I could discuss freely with anyone. He also didn't specialise in OCD if I remember rightly.  I wouldn't need to be vocal about what's wrong with me by giving it an actual name, but it would help if it had a label mainly because one of the things which gets me down so much is that I worry that a lot of it is just my personality, the way I am and that there's nothing I can do about it. This leads to more self-doubt, more encircling intrusive thoughts such as ""you shouldn't be feeling like this"" etc. When I used to behave in strange ways I even had people tell me I could easily snap out of it so it made me question whether I actually WAS ill or whether this was just some flaw I could control. I tried telling them that if I could control it it'd be gone overnight but they didn't seem to believe it was something I literally couldn't control.  I suppose my situation was a little weird; being 14 years old, female and having horrific thoughts relating to harm and POCD is NOT something you can discuss easily with a general practitioner who knows little about OCD. In retrospect I should've just said what was going through my mind then I probably would have got a diagnosis there and then but I was so fearful of landing into trouble that I clammed up."

He then sent me for a blood test and that was all.   I'm sorry that happened to you. When I initially seeked help around five years ago, my first appointment was with a general practitioner whose approach was to try to rationalize my compulsions. She even went so far as to compare what I went through with how she does specific tasks and stating something along the lines of ""being pedantic isn't in and of itself an illness"" as if it was just a case of pedantry when I'd clean my apartment almost hourly, regardless of the time of day (this happened for the course of a year or so). When it's about your health, I really do advise you to stand your ground. That's what I did and that's what got me into getting help from various psychotherapists, psychologists and psychiatrists. These are the sort of professionals that do (at least hopefully) have the necessary experience to recognize the symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. A general practitioner might not be able to do anything else but to refer you to another professional who is well-versed in the field of mental illnesses.  edit.  By ""standing your ground"" I mean not having your struggles belittled. If they are driving you to the point of total collapse, they need to be taken seriously. What I don't mean by ""standing your ground"" is insisting on knowing better than the medical professional with regards to what might be the underlying cause for the symptoms."
OCD,3bmzj8,JujuSpammer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:55:17 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day it doesn't matter too much what label you fit under. The important thing is to identify the problematic behaviours that you're engaging in, which are contributing to you having poor mental health, and working on eliminating these.   The problem with the OCD label is that it can make people think that they have to keep doing the same things for the rest of their lives. They attribute their behaviour to a disorder and make no attempt to change it. The fact is, compulsive behaviours can be cut out with practice and changing the way you approach doubts and anxiety. Methods like ERP have been shown to be very effective for achieving this.   I think the best approach is to focus on changing your behaviour away from the unhealthy pattern it has now towards one that is healthier. That's going to be more important than trying to understand why you are engaging in compulsions at the moment. So instead of worrying about the reasons behind the poor mental health you have now, shift your focus to the things that will help you improve that mental health."
OCD,3bmzj8,IapetusMoon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:10:57 2015 UTC,"I can understand about your worry dealing with psychiatrists, but if you're still struggling I think it's best to get a diagnosis and find the help and support you need.  Similar to you my first experience with a psychologist was when I was 15 and I choked because I was too ashamed to talk about my problems. When things escalated I tried it again. I've seen multiple therapists and have been suggested to have social anxiety, depression, aspergers, or severe abandonment issues for being adopted. I just finally gave up in frustration.   It wasn't until I was hospitalized due to a failed suicide attempt that I finally got diagnosed. Since then I've been seeing a psychologist that specializes in OCD and I can't believe the drastic improvement I've experienced. The benefit to seeing someone is that they can offer you support with no judgement, keep you grounded, and set obtainable goals.   Also if they specialize in OCD no matter how inappropriate your obsessive thoughts are they won't think your crazy. I've had obsessive thoughts where I feared I'd kill someone or what if I was capable of a mass shooting. They understand that it's OCD and think you're actually a psychopath."
OCD,3bkytl,softrebel,3,Tue Jun 30 01:55:31 2015 UTC,"i'm not convinced weed is actually helping you. be careful of creating a dependence. and really, smoking weed again is not a great end goal."
OCD,3bkytl,crowncourage,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:56:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like I could have written this about myself. I don't have a final word on this, but my thinking now is that the quality of the experience and the presence (if any) of depression following depends largely on whether I have unresolved anxiety going in. If I do, smoking weed suppresses, but does not remove these emotions and worries, and simply serves as a way to suppress them without dealing with them, which is classic avoidance. Thus, the next time I want to smoke, it becomes more and more tied to my inability to deal with my problems and depression inevitably follows. My advice would be that if you are going to get high, you need to be standing on solid ground.  I would also urge you to see a therapist who specializes in OCD and has specific and detailed training in treating the disorder. You would be shocked how little is covered on OCD in the training a Masters level therapist has to complete."
OCD,3bkytl,BillDoberman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:40:24 2015 UTC,OCD and depression have their root causes in problems with brain chemistry  alcohol & weed effect brain chemistry.  its possible weed effects your brain chemistry negatively.  i've read of similar complaints.  you were creative because you were relaxed its not the weed.  learn to become relaxed and you can enter the creative state on demand.
