Overwatch,3e35ky,Demokirby,9,Tue Jul 21 16:29:59 2015 UTC,"Map burnout? Man we've played de_dust2 for what, 15 years? :D  But to your question, we have no idea."
Overwatch,3e35ky,VSENSES,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:32 2015 UTC,There is people who love playing the same map over and over. But new maps often bring back old players and keep a game going. Problem with new characters is of course everyone is playing as that character initially and most of the player base will end up deciding now to invest much time into said new character after the novelty wears out. Maps offer far more replay award.
Overwatch,3e35ky,Dalarrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:55 2015 UTC,"Perhaps they'll do it like they do with Hearthstone, release new content every 6 months, which has kept that game very much alive."
Overwatch,3e35ky,Xellus,3,Tue Jul 21 21:52:40 2015 UTC,"I doubt there will be a mapmaker just because it would be something much more difficult to do and the only time they have done that is with Starcraft, which gives you a preset toolkit to use to make your maps.  I don't think new maps will be that big of an issue as blizzard should have a team dedicated to that, but also the fact that the game will have so many classes will keep each game feeling unique to the last should help with the stretch in between map releases."
Overwatch,3e35ky,Xellus,3,Tue Jul 21 18:21:05 2015 UTC,"Character variety is great, but maps and new modes are a very important in keeping the game fresh. Tools make take some effort to make but far from being outside blizzards scope of something they can provide if they want to, it is a easy way for the player base to keep the game fresh for everyone. Hell. we would see with in the first few months all the major official TF2 maps recreated by the OW fanbase."
Overwatch,3e35ky,NBlitZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you are saying for sure. I will say though, that there are possible ""negative"" side effects for having user created maps. Off the top of my head: Less funding and focus going into other areas of the gaming, Community spread out over more maps, and it could make the game vulnerable to exploitation. I'm not saying that these would be definitely be negatives, but I think it's important to think about it from all angles.  I'll elaborate on these a bit.   If blizzard has to spend more money and time to develop a kit to create a map editor for people to use, that could have some serious consequences on the other areas of the game, since, in business, more funding isn't always an option. I'm not sure I would be willing to sacrifice other aspects of the game for this if it had to happen, but there is definitely something to be said about the lasting beneficial impact having a map editor would bring. Having more maps can be a bad thing as it splits the community . Think of games like dota and league of legends.(I know, the dreaded moba analogy) These games are extremely popular and part of that is because everyone always plays the same format and map(even though league has tried). This strengthens the community by eliminating splits in community population over multiple modes/maps. That being said, shooters like CS:GO still do very well with many many maps, but the thing to keep in mind there is that there is no difference between each player besides what he purchases and that just isn't comparable to different character in OW. This is why I think a happy medium between the two works really well. A controlled map and game mode pool that is changed here and there by adding new maps and taking out other maps(in matchmaking). I know little about what causes vulnerability by adding user created maps, but I know in my experiences with some games that these maps are easier to hack on. This probably depends on implementation so I'm not sure this point really matters at all.   TL;DR- While having a map editor would be awesome, there are possible negatives to it."
Overwatch,3e35ky,tiranama,3,Tue Jul 21 21:48:06 2015 UTC,I'd rather have the map making team (If there is one) take their time. I rather a unique map completely fleshed out. Giving it a special vibe then have them go through with our demands. I want them to take their time. Hopefully the time we waited for the map will become worth it. That's what I love about work being done right. You come into a map feeling refreshed.
Overwatch,3e35ky,aqlno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:45 2015 UTC,Will we have to buy new maps?
Overwatch,3e35ky,Clearskky,4,Tue Jul 21 18:28:08 2015 UTC,"Probably not. I can't imagine Blizzard would want to split the playerbase the way the Call of Duty and Battlefield have.   Plus, with HotS each new map has always been free."
Overwatch,3e35ky,SirUndead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:00 2015 UTC,Not the lack of maps but the lack of gamemodes would upset the community the most. We can easily discard CTF but KotH should be added beacuse its a highly competitive gamemode and offers symmetric maps which overwatch doesn't have at the moment.

Overwatch,3e3e18,Clearskky,2,Tue Jul 21 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert on game balance, but it sounds like fun and I'd be willing to try it if nothing else. Actually, I just wanted to comment saying my favorite thing about your post is you pushing for story and gameplay integration. Given, we can't REALLY make it make sense that Reaper is killing Reaper or Winston decided to brutally execute Tracer with his bare gorilla hands (Trouble in paradise?), but I definitely think that tying the story into the maps and maybe even the objectives is something that I'd love to see, and I'm sure they have considered it. I bet you we get something like that, a little bit.  Like even if nothing else, there's that Road Hog article in that map, so we can get little visual easter eggs put in, and that's nice.  Me personally, I've decided. I'm going to push to reintegrate Protect The Pimp. It was a game mode in Saints Row 1 that I don't think they've brought back yet despite large fan outcry, so I say we do it here. RESPECT DA PIMPHAND. Hahah."
Overwatch,3e3e18,SirUndead,2,Tue Jul 21 21:13:53 2015 UTC,"I've never been a fan of complicated objectives in FPS's because it distracts from the far more interesting player-driven aspects of the game. In a 6v6 game where SO MUCH is going on with ability spam, this game moreso than most needs a clear and simple objective that everyone can understand instantaneously just by looking at it. I'm all for having more than just A/D-styled payloads and capture points, but it needs to be as simple as these modes as well. Flag carrying modes have already been discounted by the devs due to high mobility heroes like Tracer, and I imagine a ""fix"" like turning off abilities were discounted because a) they're unfun and b) still a nightmare to balance as the roster gets bigger.   So what are we left with? I think adding in some mirrored cps and payload would be interesting, rather than just attack/defend scenarios. I always wanted to see a VIP mode, maybe one in which it's 7v7 with one player as a VIP hero with some nominal abilities. This would really showcase tank heroes who have some pretty stellar abilities to protect. King of the Hill would be cool too."

I'm 100% certain that it won't deal damage though. As you said, invincible is invincible. Nothing else damages Reaper while he's in Wraith Form, there's no reason to assume this will."
Overwatch,3dz8lp,The4thSniper,9,Mon Jul 20 22:00:11 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I could be wrong but I'd prefer it if the visor would completely skip over Reaper when you're targeting when Reaper is in wraith form if he's invincible to it, unless they want to use Reaper's wraith form as a method to sorta ""tank"" the visor via being a slight distraction or something, which would be an interesting concept."
Overwatch,3dz8lp,SirUndead,6,Mon Jul 20 19:06:13 2015 UTC,"I actually like the idea of Reaper tanking Soldier 76. Considering how fast his visor builds up, could prove to be an important strat (along with zenyatta ult.)"

Overwatch,3dz8lp,urashimakt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:24:28 2015 UTC,"No, the mechanics of these skills in most games essentially remove the character from existing physically in the map and becomes a non-targetable unit, so Reaper could not be targeted, hit, healed, shield, or anything else in this form.  It is VERY unlikely he will be able to be targeted, and he definitely won't be able to take damage (they would probably patch it if he WAS targeted actually, because it's a non-productive result.)"

Also, this classic gem.  That aside, a Hero inspired by Predator would be radical as hell. I'm sure Predator's recent, and from what I understand successful, appearance in Mortal Kombat is bringing some players on to the Predator hype train.

If there isn't anything like fire, you can just make the invis a lot shorter duration, which limits the need for stuff like that to a degree."

Overwatch,3duaz8,xeroslash,28,Sun Jul 19 18:10:48 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion, but I really hope that invisibility doesn't become a thing. They're not hard to deal with in shooters that have them implemented, but it's just not a fun experience to deal with.  Another poster mentioned in another thread that suggested a hero to have hologram clones instead, which sounds much more interesting.  Edit: Was on mobile earlier when I made the post, the clones idea was mentioned here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/3dst3c/i_made_a_ability_kit_for_that_robot_ninja_guy/ct8f95x"
Overwatch,3duaz8,Dick_Nation,12,Sun Jul 19 15:52:19 2015 UTC,"To expand on this, it's important to understand what invisibility does. Stealth is really a movement option, but it's generally a pretty poor one (I don't think I've ever seen it implemented well in a PvP shooter). People don't often understand that the basic tenant of stealth is just the same as having rocket jumps; they allow a player to move with some expediency into a more favorable position. Unfortunately, stealth is also incredibly binary. It winds up being a pass/fail system wherein if you remain undetected and uncloak in a safe place, you'll probably achieve whatever you were trying to do entirely unaccosted, and if you don't, you're going to go down without a fight.  The only stealthing character I actually remember being any good was Monday Night Combat's Assassin, and her stealthing was good mostly for keeping creep attention off her. It was easily defeated by other players (she was partially visible within ~10 feet and left dust trails while sprinting), and what made her actually good at what she did was her sprint, super jump and deadly damage. TF2 Spy, by comparison, has nothing to fall back on but his cloaking, and he's roundly considered to be the least effective class in the game. I once heard someone describe cloaking as ""being countered by turning around every ten seconds,"" which is sadly quite accurate. It is in theory a fun idea, but doesn't ever really work in practice."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Duckshark_,13,Sun Jul 19 16:29:16 2015 UTC,"I can agree that from a literal standpoint, Spy is technically the least effective class in TF2, but I don't think invisibility is a poor movement mechanic. You won't instantly go down without a fight if you get caught if you're good and/or aware, and I think you're neglecting to mention that invisibility is a pretty great escape tool in the right hands."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Dick_Nation,0,Sun Jul 19 17:13:34 2015 UTC,"I would suggest that you could achieve similar goals with more fairness to both the user and opponent by a wholly different design. Reaper actually heavily treads into Spy territory already - trading invisibility for invincibility with his wraith form. It's still going to take a lot of thought to use appropriately, but it doesn't feel as cheap to people playing against him and it's entirely more consistent for the person playing him. These are the kinds of things a game should strive for."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Tjackson20,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:32:51 2015 UTC,"Just because two words sound the same does not mean they are similar. IMO, I feel like invincibility is much more ""cheap"" and requires less thought than invisibility.  Edit: oops."
Overwatch,3duaz8,dinoseen,3,Sun Jul 19 23:59:22 2015 UTC,"I feel like invincibility is much more ""cheap"" and requires less thought than invincibility.  invincibility  invincibility"
Overwatch,3duaz8,Dick_Nation,2,Mon Jul 20 03:21:52 2015 UTC,"Compare and contrast what they actually accomplish: allowing the player to move unfettered through a dangerous area. Both restrict the player from attacking and have minor startup and cooldown times. What does it actually lose Reaper to be visible? A very tiny element of surprise, maybe. He can't get winged by random fire or blown up by someone who doesn't even know he's there, catch a puff of fire and get focused down before even being able to fight back again. He can still easily put himself in positions where he gets focused down the moment he comes out of wraith form, just as Spy can if he decloaks at a poor time. Reaper's ability doesn't leave anyone deficient for information, making it much more fun and feeling far less random to try and combat, while still taking cleverness on the part of the user to maximize its effectiveness. Functionally, they are not very different at all."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Tjackson20,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:00:52 2015 UTC,"I would have to respectfully disagree. Invincibility can't really be used as a means of getting behind enemy lines, whereas invisibility is commonly used for just so. In an FPS, the element of surprise can win games. I agree that they both have their place, but they are most definitely not the same thing."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Dick_Nation,0,Mon Jul 20 04:02:31 2015 UTC,"Think about the questions that go into it as a player. Whose job is it to protect your flank? How do you keep it secure? What constitutes your defense? How are you protecting your supports? All of the same questions are rattled off for talking about a character like Reaper as you would tick off for a Spy.  Remember that even in the TF2 microcosm, Spy is largely irrelevant because other classes do the job he is supposed to do drastically better than he can. The function they serve is identical, but they are more flexible and more lethal in every meaningful way than Spy is. The same principle is at work here. Reaper is going to live in that same role, making very similar decisions, but without having to fear so much randomness or a binary mistake costing him so much."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Tjackson20,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:18:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that Reaper's invincibility should be replaced with invisibility; he's fine as is. My only point is that invisibility and invincibility aren't the same thing, and one isn't necessarily better than the other, they just do different things, and are meant for different situations.  I also disagree that the spy has no usefulness. He's great pick class, (sometimes even better than sniper) and excellent at creating confusion. He's a check for a team that isn't working well together."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Dick_Nation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:46:32 2015 UTC,"He's a check for a team that isn't working well together.    And that right there is the critical failure. That's conditional. ""This works if..."" simply means it does not work. You can't balance a game around conditions in which nobody is really playing it well. Scout doesn't work ""if,"" he just works. Same with Demoman, or with Soldier. There's a reason 6s uses the classes they do, and Highlander has Spy pretty much universally regarded as the least important member of the team.  This all loops right back around to where I started: a character needs more than just a stealth mechanic to be good. I'm not even wholly opposed to stealth being part of a character's kit, but it can't be the tool by which they live and die for good gameplay. Blizzard would have to widen their parameters to more than just stealth, and would have to create a character who could do more than the pass/fail gameplay that makes up Spy's entire existence."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Niller1,5,Mon Jul 20 05:31:29 2015 UTC,"Cloaking in a game like Planetside 2 works fine though. It really depends on how it's implemented, not so much that cloaking is a bad idea."
Overwatch,3duaz8,FirstaLasto,2,Sun Jul 19 18:09:33 2015 UTC,"I once heard someone describe cloaking as ""being countered by turning around every ten seconds,"" which is sadly quite accurate.   The thing is, when you're playing Spy, you need to target players in situations where they can't just turn around every ten seconds. Target enemies while they're focused on something else. People aren't going to want to turn around while they're in the middle of a firefight."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Overwelm,3,Sun Jul 19 18:23:29 2015 UTC,Then you're in the middle of a firefight and that's not where a spy wants to be unless they're a DR spy.
Overwatch,3duaz8,kz89,3,Sun Jul 19 18:56:34 2015 UTC,"Youre not in the middle of it. Youre on the offskirts, and you go to the edge of the fight to get stabs."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Overwelm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"Which unless your a DR or YER spy will result in a max of 3 or so stabs against decent players. A traditional spy (imo) thrives in the middle ground between the base and the front lines of the enemy team. He has the most room to work with, frequent access to health and ammo pickups and will often not run into massive packs of enemies. The job of a spy is to thin out the front lines before they get there. It also draws the enemy back to deal with him easily."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Fyrestone,2,Sun Jul 19 19:42:46 2015 UTC,"The Spy isn't about how many kills you get, he's about who you kill and when. Killing a Medic before he gets off Uber is already a massive contribution, backstabbing a Heavy in Payload means they're missing a big part of their front line, etc.  In a firefight if they're focusing on you, they're not focusing on your Soldier, or Demo, or most importantly your Medic.  It's not like you're helpless outside stealth either, the revolver is plenty powerful albeit difficult (the Ambassador in particular)."
Overwatch,3duaz8,kz89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:06:55 2015 UTC,"Doing that you run into the previous problem, people turning around every 10 seconds. It depends on the server and the situation. Overall, a good spy should be employing both of these strategies."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Perfect_Perception,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:58:16 2015 UTC,3 stabs is a high estimate and is an EXCELLENT number of picks. That is in a competitive setting 1/3rd of the enemy team. Even 1 pick is incredibly valuable. A lot of people here are underplaying the value of spy.
Overwatch,3duaz8,Overwelm,4,Sun Jul 19 21:13:29 2015 UTC,I said max not usual. Spies are also rarely if ever played in competitive settings (which is coming from experience..).  I certainly think a good spy can be effective in pub lobbies I was just disagreeing with how they do it.

Highlander is a game mode in which all 9 classes are played, including spy, and is pretty popular. In 6s, Spy is an offclass just like any other non-cookie cutter class, and has it's place in the mode.   which is coming from experience   I don't want to touch this. There's no way to not come off sounding like an asshole."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Overwelm,2,Sun Jul 19 21:47:13 2015 UTC,Ah I can touch it. I never did comp highlander actually but I did do 6s which is why I said in my experience. Without highlander experience I couldn't say how they do in comp but in 6s it's pretty much a cheese.
Overwatch,3duaz8,FirstaLasto,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:17:48 2015 UTC,"You kill the people in the back of the firefight, not in the middle of it. Doesn't have to be a firefight, they can be distracted by other things. Snipers are easy targets, for example, and you can take out an Engineer who is in the middle of work on his machines pretty easily, or a Medic who is focused on his healing target. Spies are about assassinating key targets anyways (especially ones who are in the back line and difficult for a sniper to target), not just rushing in and slaying the entire enemy team by yourself.  All three of those classes have similar equivs in Overwatch (Widowmaker, Torbjorn, and Mercy), so you'll have things to do. Bastion is also a sitting duck once you get behind that shield. Symmetra is another character that spends a lot of time in the backline, but she isn't likely to be distracted, so you'll need to take a different approach."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Dick_Nation,3,Sun Jul 19 20:11:15 2015 UTC,"This falls heavily into the ""fun idea, but doesn't really work in practice"" part. The theory seems solid, but the reality is that in many situations you wind up cut to ribbons before you can execute - so many, of course, that it invalidates most of his usefulness. You can see this at work in competitive TF2, where Spy is virtually never run in 6s and is considered the least powerful and least critical member of a highlander team. Without durability, range or mobility in other forms, Spy is 100% reliant on his cloaking for his gameplan to work (we're not even going to discuss how invalid disguises are - hopefully there's no need to), and it shows the critical failures of that system.  When stealth characters do work, it's when they have other things going for them. Assassin from MNC as I listed above had withering damage, as well as both fantastic groundspeed and the best vertical mobility in the game. Recons in Global Agenda were very easily killed, but they were blindingly fast and incredibly damaging. Even a wrinkle on it like the Raider in Tribes: Ascend, who could disguise from sensors but not sight, was effective because he was extremely powerful in a direct combat situation. Decreasing their visibility was useful to all of these examples, but it can never be relied on as a ""core"" mechanic."

Overwatch,3duaz8,Dick_Nation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:28:41 2015 UTC,"The mechanic being bad is what makes it bad. As I've said, it's binary and feels very random to people playing against it, and there's a huge element of that randomness for people using it as well - it's very easy to get tagged by random crossfire in a game such as this, functionally instantly disabling the advantage of that mechanic.  I don't agree that it's good to give people the choice to inherently suck. I even listed games and characters that have stealth as a mechanic and do it in a much more fair and intelligent way in another post here, so you must understand I am not absolutely opposed to it. It simply needs to be implemented well and needs to not be the only tool in the box of a character who has it, because it is not a mechanic that supports a character all by itself. Spy particularly, and the model that he uses, gets called out because it's a perfect distillation of the flaws inherent in the idea. He relies entirely on his cloak to succeed, and all of his weaknesses and issues provide a perfect map to the problems with the mechanic. An archetype so fundamentally incomplete should not be revisited."
Overwatch,3duaz8,dylstew,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:11:36 2015 UTC,"Omg now I wanna play the original Monday Night Combat again. Does anyone still play that? On PC, Is it even still playable online?  Also, what about fortress forever spy? Was he useless in high skilled play too? Your cloak is infinite and invisible when standing still. But when moving you are slightly visible. His backstabs have a your eternal reward effect, and cloaking while walking a dead ringer effect."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Dick_Nation,0,Mon Jul 20 04:52:46 2015 UTC,"You'd have to ask somebody well-versed in it to know where he stands. I think you're going to see the same flaws inherent there as you do in TF2, even if the cloak has more options and is therefore overall better. Three badly flawed mechanics doesn't make one good mechanic; it doesn't become more than the sum of its parts.  What I would imagine is if Spy is considered powerful in Fortress Forever, it would be on the back of mechanics like conc jumping, which are found more broadly in TF classic and clones of it. TF2's mobility is heavily stratified and it's one of the large reasons the classes that dominate do so; homogenizing it would automatically pull characters towards the center. As I've said elsewhere in this thread, stealth characters are best off when they're not wholly reliant on being stealth characters - cloaking may help them, but it won't make or break their game."

We'll probably see the robot ninja have some sort of stealth, a ""so fast that you can't see him"" kind of deal. I hope its just for movement and he can't run up behind you (or in front of you) and slip his Katana into your back."
Overwatch,3duaz8,_Arms_Race_,4,Mon Jul 20 05:08:51 2015 UTC,"I think that at most we might get a Hero with a stealth mechanic but, disguising and backstabbing would be a bit too much for Overwatch."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Combarishnigm,7,Mon Jul 20 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"I think I can answer pretty safely 'No'. Here's why.  In TF2, the Spy is a class that places an extremely large burden of attention and knowledge on its opponents. Except for Scouts, who generally move too quickly to get backstabbed, every class in the game has to be aware of three facts:  1: At any time, a Spy could appear behind you (due to the cloak mechanic allowing a Spy to get behind your back lines with absolutely no warning). Your primary counterplay to this is ""Look behind you frequently"".   2: At any time, an ally could turn out to be a Spy (due to the disguise mechanic). Your primary counterplay is to watch your allies for signs that they aren't a spy (such as firing a weapon or walking through an ally).  3: When you kill a Spy, that Spy may still be alive due to the Dead Ringer. Counterplay includes hunting around for spots you suspect the Dead Ringer Spy might go, or seeing signs that the Spy did not use the Dead Ringer (such as firing a weapon right before dying, or uncloaking just before dying).  Most new players don't know any of these things, and so they die a lot to Spies until they learn (or are taught) those three facts. That burden of knowledge goes against Blizzard's design for Overwatch so far, which has been very clear and kind to new players.   In addition to the burden of knowledge is the burden of attention. At all times in TF2, you need to be prepared for the possibility that someone's playing Spy, and they're about to stab you. That is due to one of TF2's nine classes. Overwatch is starting with around 40 characters, and will likely get dozens more over the years. It's just not realistic for Blizzard to add one hero out of potentially 100 heroes that will force you to constantly check every corner or spycheck every ally, just in case one of your opponents swapped to ""Spy"" and is about to oneshot your Mercy."

Overwatch,3duaz8,Behe_m0th,4,Mon Jul 20 20:23:32 2015 UTC,"The spy in TF2 makes sense to me, because he requires quite a bit of skill to use efficiently. Having a finite stealth, positional requirements and needing to unstealth all makes for what I feel a balanced experience.  On the other hand you have a more recent iteration of melee stealth guy via Dirty Bomb with their new character Phantom. He has a finite stealth, but as far as I know he can attack out of it, and if not the window for him to drop stealth is a fraction of a second. His melee damage is also static and at the moment very high, so there is no worry of position, and he also packs an smg. It isn't numbers or stealth that really bother me with Phantom, it is his lack of risk. You barrel in with stealth and swing wildly. Not that there isn't a way to perform better with him, but I feel the skill floor is very low.  Which going on to overwatch, I feel if they did a true stealth, it should have the same risk as TF2 spy. Or another version I have heard and greatly enjoyed was have a hero that can climb on ceilings, it isn't a true stealth, but I can't imagine a lot of players in an FPS staring straight above them."

Overwatch,3duaz8,CaptainKick,4,Sun Jul 19 20:36:38 2015 UTC,"I think there is definitely room for a stealth-oriented hero, but I don't think it should be exactly like the spy (and I say this as a spy main).  I think a stealth hero could work as long as it went roughly along these lines.  1) No instant kill backstab. First off, lag + hit registration will always lead to some funky-looking deaths. Secondly, sitting around waiting for backstab opportunities really gimps your team when you make up 1/6 of it, as opposed to the 1/12 of most TF2 servers.  2) Quicker, faster stealth instead of longer, more stationary stealth. Like with backstabs, encouraging people to sit invisibly in corners will gimp your team, especially since stealth heroes always attract a bunch of players.   If I had to design a stealth ability for a character, I'd give him something like a 4 second stealth where he moves at X% faster speed and gets an extra Y% damage boost for the first attack out of stealth. If that ended up being too broken, I'd consider either making the stealth form barely visible by adding some kind of shimmer, or by making the first attack out of stealth have a brief windup so people have a moment to try to react to it."
Overwatch,3duaz8,bveccy,4,Sun Jul 19 23:15:46 2015 UTC,"funky looking deaths, you say?  OT, i don't think it'd be a bad thing if they add invis mechanics, or maybe even melee while in stealth for extra damage. but please, no OHKO mechanics. It won't end well. ever. It's one of the most rage inducing things in TF2 to be facestabbed. there's too many variables like the netcode, the killer AND the victim's ping, lag compensation for player models, the list can go on."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Perago_Wex,4,Sun Jul 19 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"There definitely should be!   Stealth is a really cool mechanic, as long as it has obvious vulnerabilities. I think disguising is also a cool mechanic, but that's cutting it too close to be a TF2 Spy clone (I'm looking at you, Mercy)  No OHKOs please. I don't think it belongs in a game like this. What Blizz could do is add amplified damage for flank/backstabs attacks instead."

Overwatch,3duaz8,Pandapopo,3,Mon Jul 20 12:35:06 2015 UTC,"I hate stealth in any games, though I can understand the...fun in abusing it. It's just an arms race for no reason.  A class has stealth, some classes are then needed to counter it (Not one mind you, many classes) in order to keep the stealth class from being OP and server being swarmed by stealthies.  Then comes the whines and cries of spies/rogues what other stealth class of how UP they are, and it just goes back and forth.   It's also undoubtedly the most boring and binary characteristic. A majority of the stealth heroes in sci-fi/fantasy are these ninja shadowy brooding emo edgelord type.   I just feel stealth is way over done and too much of a cliche. IMO the only point going for it is Overwatch is being marketed as having something for everyone."
Overwatch,3duaz8,CriticalCrit,2,Mon Jul 20 18:49:05 2015 UTC,"Just imagine a Hero less than a Spy and more like a Thief / Rogue, stealing abilities from enemy heros (either to use them himself, or to stop the others from using them) :D  He wouldn't neccesarily be overpowered, but he could disable the enemy formation quite a bit.   Of course he would have to have stealth / invis / teleport mechanics and I think it should be close range from behind.  That would make him a quite skill based Hero."

Phantom's a cash grab and is inherently broken...at a glance. He dies in two hits like everyone else but Rhino, and his cloak makes him INCREDIBLY OBVIOUS. Also, if he didn't pay to win / get lucky, his katana stab doesn't one hit kill and sets him up for a headshot-related death if he's a bad player that uses cloak to melee. (Disclaimer: Most are.) Again - teamwork and proximity mines make him 100% useless.  Gimmick characters that rely on player stupidity only work at the pub level, as one of the upper responses said - and it's just kind of lame when you have to rely on something that eventually wears off as players get good.   That being said, they could release an espionage-esque character, and have him either be overbuffed to keep up with how easily snuffed he'll inevitably be, or incredibly weak and a ""retarded purchase / retarded player"" magnet.

Overwatch,3duaz8,FirstaLasto,0,Mon Jul 20 00:52:29 2015 UTC,"I'm suprised at how many people here seem to be against a character with invisibility and/or backstabs. So, I've thought of a build for a stealth character without either one.  Basically, the character would be extremely mobile (has ways to jump large gaps and reach high places, and would have the innate ability to see enemies a short distance through walls. This way they must plan their routes around enemies, rather than relying on invsibility to just walk past them. The small 6 person teams in Overwatch make this plausable. They would be extremely frail (maybe only 100-150 HP), so not being noticed is very important.  The character would be able to see an enemys health (assuming they make it so that you cant normally see enemy health) as well as other info such as their armor, shields, and ultimate charge. One of their attacks would involve tagging one enemy at a time with a tagging projectile, which lets all allies see that enemys position no matter where they go, as well as all the other info the character can see from them. The tag would wear off after some time.  Another ability they would possess is an attack that drains enemy armor and/or ultimate charge (possibly fully charged ultimates would be immune to this), as well as removing other types of buffs they have, such as harmony orbs or personal shields.  So, rather than an assassination stealth character, they would be a scouting and debuff support stealth character. Does that sound better to those of you that are against invisibility and/or backstabs?"
Overwatch,3duaz8,TimeToGrindGaming,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:53:42 2015 UTC,I loved playing as the spy in TF2 and would probably love a spy like character in Overwatch.
Overwatch,3duaz8,1stMora,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:54:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think there will be spy character in overwatch. But I do think stealth could have its place.  Robot ninja could have abilities like this:   Primary attack: Light fast attacks with the sword. Attacks from behind and above do extra damage. Secondary attack: Heavy slow attacks with the sword. (alternatively ability to defend yourself against incoming attacks aimed at you if timed properly. Similarly to the airblast from the Pyro in TF2. Space: Jump. Hold space to jump high. Shift: Sprint - combo this with a high jump to leap forward in the air. E: Cloak for a short time. Getting hit while cloaked reveals a shimmer of you. Cannot attack while cloaked. Drain less cloak when not moving. Q: Turns you to third person. Gain super speed and attack speed. Jumping from enemy to enemy killing them really fast. (similarly to what batman does in arkham city)   With these abilities our ninja is fast and agile, able to get behind enemy lines and pick off targets one by one."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Perago_Wex,0,Mon Jul 20 00:17:57 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of a character design just like this for the Roboninja. Instead of E being a sprint though, it could be a Lunge, like a cross between Tracer's blink and McCree's dodge roll. You do this little anime flash step thing over a short distance, and good Ninjas could land an attack during the lunge. You can shunpo through enemies too, dealing a bit of damage and getting above/behind them.  I was thinking he's able to get damaged at all times during the lunge so it's not completely broken :P"

Overwatch,3duaz8,FirstaLasto,-2,Sun Jul 19 17:33:24 2015 UTC,"I really hope so. Spy was the reason I used to play TF2 in the first place.  Disguises were my favorite part of playing the class, really. I liked the mindgames involved. Being able to disguise yourself as an ally helped with confusing the opposing team, too (but that will only work if the scoreboard doesn't show the enemy team composition).  I understand that invisibility is frustrating for a lot of people, and I don't think that it needs to be done in the same way as TF2 for a good stealth character. Only being invisibile while stationary would be enough, for example, although I figure a more mobile approach will be taken with Overwatch's emphasis on constant movement (and nobody wants to watch a gameplay preview of a character standing around waiting). If disguises are included, invisibility can be designed as an escape mechanic rather than a stalking one, and I think that will be less frustrating for people.  Backstabs are a pretty important part of a stealth character (because the only other reason to stealth is to relay information, and thats not really worth a team slot), but being instant kills in a game like Overwatch wouldn't fit (because tanks). Maybe they should deal a large amount of damage (enough to kill any non-tank) and bypass armor and shields? A cooldown would ensure you couldn't just strafe-stab a tank after you get the first hit in.  As far as sapping is concerned, Tracer basically has that covered with Pulse Bombs, so it wouldn't need to be a part of a stealth character.  Of course, this is just comparing the ideas from the TF2 Spy, and there are many other concepts for stealth characters that could be included (playing dead like in TFC?), and I'm sure that if Blizzard adds a stealth character, they'll pick the ones that fit the best into Overwatch (including coming up with their own, maybe?)."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Helstrem,2,Sun Jul 19 22:48:06 2015 UTC,"No, regular insta kills are not fun and an invisible enemy who insta kills you, even if he likely dies shortly after, is not fun to play against.

Overwatch,3duaz8,FirstaLasto,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:00:34 2015 UTC,"Can't Widowmaker get insta-kills anyways, even on tanks? Or am I mistaken?  Also, you shouldn't be able to attack enemies WHILE invisible, if that's what you thought I meant. Using the TF2 Spy as an example, you have to decloak before you can attack, and decloaking takes a second or two and has a visual and audio cue, so you can't just sneak up to someone while invisible, decloak, and expect to stab them. The invisbility is for getting behind enemy lines."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Helstrem,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:58:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think she can insta kill a tank, and it takes some skill (or luck, but somebody relying on luck will not be a consistent threat) to land a head shot and her lines of fire can be somewhat anticipated.  The audio cues in TF2 are fine so long as you're not in battle, but in battle they are easy to miss.  Further, the defensive ""skill"" of looking behind you every so often isn't engaging.  Sure, you may randomly happen to flip to the rear view at the right moment, but the biggest effect will be on making the stealthed player overly cautious about attacking you.  It isn't like checking your 6 in a dogfight where doing so is part of maintaining situational awareness of what the other aircraft are doing, with stealth you can't see the other guy to have situational awareness.  Just not a fun mechanic."
Overwatch,3duaz8,Newbieshoes,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:51:26 2015 UTC,Hopefully not.  Spies are dead weight 90% of the time. Reaper pretty much covers this playstyle without the stupid disguises anyways.

They all serve very niche roles within their own, broader roll and to have characters locked away behind gameplay hours, or worse, money or some type of RMC, would just hurt this game so much. It'd keep players from reaching their full potential. You wouldn't be able to form proper team composites if you/your allies didn't have the right Heroes unlocked."
Overwatch,3dudob,HarryFodder,5,Mon Jul 20 10:03:33 2015 UTC,"This was a major point of frustration when I was playing LoL, especially since that game has an order you need to pick heroes in and it would be really hard to coordinate with your teammates depending on what champions they had unlocked. When I switched to dota2 that had every hero unlocked from the start I realized how much this mattered. It mattered so much that I couldn't go back to LoL even if I liked that game more.  I feel that this might be what makes or breaks this game. A poor unlock system like Heroes of the Storm loses a lot of the player base because it's unrewarding nature and very steep prices. Unfortunately Blizzard has a very poor track record of horrible free to play systems. This is why I am not entirely ready to be 100% excited about this game, it's the kind of thing that has the potential to break an otherwise fun game."

Overwatch,3dudob,leigonlord,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:52:55 2015 UTC,It is more of back end thing. It isn't part of the game really as you won't notice it if it was gone.
Overwatch,3dudob,Plzbanmebrony,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:44:52 2015 UTC,"The medic thing is less of a progression and more of something you get if you are doing your job right, a lot of achievements in tf2 can be obtained by just playing the game, and weapons droped/crafted anyway, so you can completely ignore them."
Overwatch,3dudob,lCore,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:00:15 2015 UTC,seriously bro. preach
Overwatch,3dudob,Perago_Wex,3,Sun Jul 19 19:04:13 2015 UTC,"I don't really want to see any sort of progression except maybe achievements. The problem with achievements in a multiplayer game is that people trying to unlock the achievements will focus on them instead of the match objective, and that can be frustrating, so I'm not even sure achievements should happen unless theres a single player or co-op mode."
Overwatch,3dudob,FirstaLasto,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:49:28 2015 UTC,"That is true that sometimes people focus on a achievment instead of the objective. On the other hand, it can also ""force"" the player to discover some new way of playing he/she was not aware of."
Overwatch,3dudob,o0Zeb0o,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:05:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, having achievements for each character gives you reason to play characters you normally wouldn't."
Overwatch,3dudob,FirstaLasto,3,Mon Jul 20 19:11:15 2015 UTC,I REALLY hope they tone down any progression or just leave it out.  Play they game to have fun.
Overwatch,3dudob,Integrals,2,Mon Jul 20 09:28:52 2015 UTC,Hopefully none. Fully hero unlocks on day one of playing and you just get to enjoy the game. I am tied of game devs thinking there has to be progression when all it is used for is sequencing time out of players. Basically tricking them into thinking they are getting their money's worth.

Overwatch,3dudob,prollgurke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:19:17 2015 UTC,"Theorically, I think most of us agree on the fact that the game should be fun enough to not require unlocks/achievments as incentive to play.  However, to be honnest, in other FPS I found myself liking to unlock stuff for my character that have an impact (or not) on the gameplay (new weapons, new equipments, new skins, etc...). The one that have impact on the gameplay should however be quick/easy to get.  If Overwatch is a F2P, there will certainly be stuff to unlock, that could be purchased by real money and by playing (ingame currency/experience). This is the incentive core system of almost every modern F2P."

Overwatch,3drxg7,nCubed21,3,Sun Jul 19 02:54:14 2015 UTC,Just found Two-Bears-High-Fiving in Honest Hearts yesterday morning. Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon in action.
Overwatch,3drxg7,The4thSniper,2,Sun Jul 19 11:24:31 2015 UTC,"""Take drugs, Kill a bear""   Context: This appears to be the ""two bears high fiving"" picture from fallout: new vegas, during the opening of the game you can name what pictures look like (that exam that I unfortunately forgot the name at the moment) and one of those is this one. Sadly there is no option for two bears high fiving (as pointed out by a player).  Later in the game there is an easter egg with a character named ""two bears high fiving"" on the honest hearts dlc, under specific conditions (wild wasteland perk) he will greet the player by saying ""Take drugs, kill a bear"""

Overwatch,3dt1x7,Choadmunch,8,Sun Jul 19 04:31:12 2015 UTC,Have some respect for Blizzard. They're obviously not going to release a game intended as an esport without a mode that supports static teams.
Overwatch,3dt1x7,Combarishnigm,9,Sun Jul 19 07:43:05 2015 UTC,"There will be a ""casual"" que and a ""competitive"" que. Casual will be drop in/out, not many details about competitive que, but Im 100 percent sure at least 1 and 2 will be used"

Overwatch,3dt1x7,Eesive,7,Sun Jul 19 05:53:22 2015 UTC,I think its safe to say we'll get both.
Overwatch,3dt1x7,Clearskky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:48:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how I feel about number one, I'm torn both ways. There will be no need for auto-balancing, as they said they are working very hard to make matches as fair as possible. Fingers crossed. I think that they want to keep the rounds short so that people can just drop out after a 7 minute game. Multiple rounds doubles the time commitment, and I don't know how I feel about that. I'd like to be able to jump in for several 7 minute games rather than half as many 15 minute games. I like changing the map/people I'm facing.    That's just me though. Most of these things don't matter a lot to me particularly. I am a competitive person, and I will compete. The only thing I want is the teams to be as fair as possible, and it looks they're Blizzard is heading in that direction, which makes me ecstatic."
Overwatch,3dt1x7,Eesive,3,Sun Jul 19 05:49:16 2015 UTC,"Haven't Blizzard stated that games will be 2 rounds long, with teams swapping places (defence/attack) after the first one? I remember them saying that..."
