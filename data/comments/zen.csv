zen,3e4t3m,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:45:39 2015 UTC,How does it stand at odds? Isn't it about doubting the integrity of your country?
zen,3e4t3m,PaterBinks,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:40:22 2015 UTC,"Doubting the integrity of your country is 100% in line with the quote, but the typical conspiracy theory isn't about doubting the integrity of the country.  It's about posing unsubstantiated, sensationalist alternate explanations, rather than performing an honest investigation of evidence.  It's easy to tell the two apart.  If someone says ""This doesn't seem to add up to me, I'd like more info about it,"" they're practicing honest doubt.  If, on the other hand, they say ""this doesn't add up; here's what's really going on"" they're a sensationalist, and not practicing doubt at all."
zen,3e4t3m,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:51:15 2015 UTC,"You are assuming that the person who posted this definitely believes in the conspiracy theory. All I can take from this image is what is in the image itself. There is no point in assuming that the person who posted it prefers ""unsubstantiated, sensationalist alternate explanations, rather than performing an honest investigation of evidence"". For all we know, the person who posted it considered themselves very patriotic, but these theories have created doubt in their mind - just doubt, and not alternate belief.  I see no value in pretending to understand why they posted it. I just like the picture because of the words and the images. The idea of doubting something regardless of what the evidence shows is what is important here."

Positive being defined by ""not related to unfounded conspiracy theories"". The image may have also had a ""positive"" effect on the person who posted it.  I suppose it all comes down to context. You have one context for the image, I have another, and so the effect is different."

It's a long story), you might want to be aware of some issues:   A special transmission outside the scriptures; Not dependent on words and letters; Pointing directly to the heart; Seeing one's true nature.   Essentially. Zen is about letting go. ""If you are walking down the road, and you see the Buddha, you should kill him"" is a famous zen piece of advice. That's not about murder; it's about letting go even of the idea of Buddha, buddhahood, enlightenment, and any sort of attainment.  It's actually pretty radical, if you think about it.  Similarly, at some point in your zen practice, someone will suggest you get rid of any attachment to the Quran, Mohammed (PBUH), etc. Scripture is especially seen as an attachment; the sixth patriarch is famous for destroying his temple's sutras in a fit of rage. I'm not sure where you stand, but I know that many Muslims consider the Quran ... to be very important.  Forewarned, sahibi."

According to the analysis of the canonical teachings, five clusters (form, sensation, conception, conditioning, consciousness), twelve sense media (eye, form, ear, sound, nose, smell, tongue, taste, body, feel, mind, phenomena) and eighteen elements (twelve media plus six  associated consciousnesses), are called three groups. The honored Prajnatara just brought up the head and tail, implicity including what's in between. The Sanskrit word anapana is translated as breathing out and breathing in. There are six methods involved with this; counting, following, stopping, contemplating, returning,  purification. The details are as in the great treatise on cessation and contemplation by the master of Tiantai. Those whose preparation is not sufficient should not fail to be acqainted with this.

zen,3e112g,A_Two_Headed_Fish,5,Tue Jul 21 03:16:50 2015 UTC,"Yo!    First off, never let anyone get you down over skepticism.  It's the healthiest and most honest means of investigating the world around you, and not something that I can imagine any well-meaning, educated person would discourage in the slightest.  If you are skeptical about Zen, good.    In the context of Zen, when someone describes ""pointing,"" I don't think they mean it in the ""ordinary sense,"" or at least not in the sense that you're viewing it here.  It's often said that nobody can teach you how to see your self-nature; it's something you need to teach yourself.  So when someone ""points"" (again, in the context of Zen), it isn't pointing to the experience of seeing your self nature directly, because as you've pointed out, that isn't something you can do.  Usually, it's pointing toward something that may hopefully provoke an honest self-investigation.  The self-investigation is the source of the ""seeing.""  The ""Buddha-nature"" moniker is just a word.  It's a sticky one, because a lot of people put a lot of weight into that word, but you're right to say that there's no reason in particular to call it that.  As for why it is called that, there's folks who say that Zen is derived from Indian Buddhism and so carries the term from that tradition, and there's folks who say that it was just part of the general lexicon of religious/philosophical terms in China at the time that Zen was being established, and their tradition just co-opted the terminology of the time."
zen,3e112g,sdwoodchuck,4,Tue Jul 21 04:09:28 2015 UTC,"That is, unless it was an indescribable sensation of indeterminate origin, but if it was, then there would be no reason in particular to call it the Buddha-nature, since it wouldn't have anything to do with anything else, or anything in particular in the first place.   You are fairly close here. The sensation you are talking about is awakening or kensho. It is not so of ""indeterminate"" origin although it is sort of is. The experience is as such, experience of thusness. It's called Buddha-nature precisely because it is not a Buddha-nature. It's a name, abstraction to the awakening to the thusness. We as humans have to call it something, especially here, because typing is the only media of communication.   The issue here is not naming it or some philosophical concept to understand, it is direct experience of it. In other words kensho or satori. Diamond Sutra address this phenomena in detail."

zen,3e112g,AirSandFire,2,Tue Jul 21 14:54:23 2015 UTC,"since for there to be an experience of the Buddha-nature, it must either be a sensation of sound, sight, touch, smell, taste, imagination, emotion, or memory, or it must be a logical abstraction apprehended through thought   You are thinking of Buddha-Nature in terms of objectivity. But think not of Buddha-Nature as the seen, heard, thought; instead, of what is  seeing, the hearing, the thinking. Forget about the object of thinking - instead, turn thinking around and ask yourself: ""who"" is thinking the thoughts? You can say ""I"" - but what is that ""I""? Inquire further - what is the essence of that ""I""? At first, this inquiry happens on the level of gross mental objects, thoughts; but thoughts themselves are already ""too late"". We're talking about something that is before-thought. That paints the thought on the canvas of your mind, so to speak. How could it ever be reachable through thinking or effort?  My honest opinion is: it can't. A master might give you a mantra, make you sit zazen, or give you a kōan. But this is really not meant to make you understand something; since Buddha-Nature cannot ever become an object of thought. OK, in a way, it is an object, but an impossible object. Elusive. So what's the point then? It is only to make you pass the time until the true Self simply decides to ""bestow"" an experience of Self-recognition (kenshō). It's an act of grace. Don't believe me? Read the enlightenment stories of the prominent masters. It always happens ""by chance"". The sound of a pebble, a random phrase, a near death experience. The point is to wear you out until you give up - give up the idea that you can realize your Self through any means that are inferior to it (thought being one of them).  However if you think I'm saying you should give up all your practices, you misunderstand me. It's not that by practice, you reach Self-recognition. Instead, by practice, you make it more likely that the accident of enlightenment will happen. It cannot be your own doing. As you rightly noticed, it is impossible through the medium of thought. So it has to come from elsewhere. Except that ""elsewhere"" is not some external god, but your own true Self.   Good luck! (You will need it.)"

These two points aren't mutually exclusive. The indeterminate origin is something (or not something for that matter) important that you're touching on. But don't confuse the semantic construct with the illusion of what the label (Buddha-nature) is supposed to denote.

For example, ""A monk asked Joshu why Bodhidharma came to China?. Joshu said: ""An oak tree in the garden.""  ""why Bodhidharma came to China"" is essentially the same as saying ""what is true nature"". Joshu has just ""directly talked about and described"" and is ""discussing it plainly""  The problem is that people don't want to accept that answer because it's too plain, they think it's some complicated far away thing. The truth of zen is extraordinarily ordinary. But, people don't like ordinary, they want something special, something extraordinary rather than ordinary. Ordinary is boring."

zen,3e112g,kaneckt,2,Tue Jul 21 11:45:43 2015 UTC,"I agree that the words you use to describe the wind brushing through your hair are not the sensation of the wind brushing through your hair, independent of thought, and that the sensation cannot be conveyed through words even by the best description.  But there's no reason to make a special meaning out of it. It's a matter of recognizing that the two are not the same, and developing the concentration and mindfulness to be able to bring one's attention to the sensations without getting lost in thought.   While the exquisite sensitivity that a mental state like that entails can feel awesome and the peace that can come with it can be amazing, I don't think there's really any reason to mystify it."

Our true nature [Buddha-nature] is unconditioned. The senses, including the imagination, are conditioned and conditioning. How can one possibly behold the unconditioned through the lens of conditionality?  The present day culture has degenerated into materialist/conditionality, so much so, they will admit no animative principle (ātman). Neuroscience wants to believe that consciousness is brain derived which is materialism by any other name.   ""What we commonly call the mind is a set of operations carried out by the brain. Brain processes underlie not only simple motor behaviors such as walking and eating but also all the complex cognitive acts and behavior that we regard as quintessentially human—thinking, speaking, and creating works of art. As a corollary, all the behavioral disorders that characterize psychiatric illness—disorders of affect (feeling) and cognition (thought)—result from disturbances of brain function."" ~ E.R.

I see it as based on theory that if you learn to walk like duck and quack like one, you're a duck. So if you sit like a statue of the Buddha, you are one.  Typical Zen puts too much emphasis on the physical side of zuochan/zazen (坐禪). Meditation or dhyana is about abandoning mental confusion; hopefully, to arrive at Mind in its real state which is unstirred and pure. This is also the way koans work. Koans aim for the unstirred mind which is huatou."

I try to be observant of what my thoughts and feelings are, but I try not to put any labels on them, just feel them as they happen. I also try to be equally observant of what is happening around me. What am I seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching. Other times not of that happens and I just sit and think, which I guess might not really be meditation, but sometimes it is helpful."

I do think that meditation plays a major role. I've been focusing on Anapanasati meditation, or 'Breath' meditation, which should guide you to Jhanas with long enough practice as described in Surangama Sutra. This is the one I tend to practice and focus on. I've done Zazen previously but from what I've read it is less effective, in my experience too. Perhaps there is a specific technique in Zazen that I am missing since I don't visit local sangha but I've been satisfied with Anapanasati and consider it the key meditation technique. I also don't think that reliance on institutionalized centers/sanghas is crucial because everything that you need to know has been written with commentary by Zen masters in detail. Try that. Surangama is less known in the West but it is one of the most practical sutras. It won't mislead you."

zen,3dystf,pavelsky,6,Mon Jul 20 17:11:14 2015 UTC,"The professor discovered that not only does a regular, daily mediation practice reverse the fight or flight adaptations after meditation, but it ""tunes"" the amgydala, the brain, to respond to stress faster and then turn off the stress faster ----- you stay calmer all of the time, in between daily meditations sessions, --- just going about your daily business.   This is interesting conclusion, especially for Zen tradition. If we pay close attention to Mumonkan and Blue Cliff Record, then we'll see that there is a big emphasis on fast reaction and reply. It's common to see Mumon say that an answer is like a ""flint striking"", ""the arrow flew past Korea"", ""lighting"" response, etc. All his comments tend to emphasize answers as intuitive and void of any deep philosophical introspection, and he also emphasizes those monks that try too hard at it, thus ""the arrow flew past Korea"". Too slow. Look!  And think of the Dharma combat, the answers are quick and intuitive, not drawn out logical conclusions.   Putting it all together, my position is that meditation does play a part in Zen. Many Zen masters and monks have meditated, they just say don't attach yourself too it but they don't really negate it as in forbidding it. Just something to think about if we look at OP and Zen texts."
zen,3dystf,korhalf,4,Mon Jul 20 17:21:04 2015 UTC,"The split about meditation on this forum really has to do with some differences in translation and interpretation. Joshu said ""I examine closely"" when a Monk probed what he does , Foyan said ""examine yourself carefully"". There is very little focus on any specific method in doing this since Zen advocates no-method, no-doctrine. The thing is we have no idea or proof of what these people did from day to day. Joshu said he just wears clothes and eats food, is he meditating? Doesn't matter, we each do the work independently and examine ourselves closely. Ummon said when sitting, sit, when standing, stand, but most importantly do not wobble! Is he advocating no-wobbling-meditation?"
zen,3dystf,SoundOfOneHand,3,Mon Jul 20 18:32:20 2015 UTC,"All of this was in the context of monks who already spent a lot of time meditating, so I don't think it needs to be stated that they practised meditation, at least early on in their careers.  Bankei may have overexerted himself but his awakening still came on the heels of extensive periods of meditation.  Bodhidharma sat for 9 years facing a wall, after already receiving transmission from his teacher in India.  But you can sit facing a wall for 10000 kalpas and not experience enlightenment, so the zen masters were kind enough to goad us on in our practice, to keep us on our toes, not just robotically humming some mantra or repeating the words of a koan, but deeply investigating the nature of ourselves and the world.  This is not an activity restricted to seated meditation, and people like Mumon incite us to observe the methods day and night - but very few people stand a chance of ""getting it"" without a basis of formal practice and education.    It seems to me that to be able to break from forms, you must be able to understand and embody them first.  To spit on the statues of the Buddha you must first be able to bow before them.  And to even approach formless method and doctrine, you must have developed the more prescriptive methods and doctrines taught through the ages.  If you start at a new job and seek to throw away all convention of your predecessors, doing it your own way without understanding what they had done before, you will end up doing it wrong and people will say you are foolish.  You have to think and act independently, but you must spend some time mastering the basics before you can do so in a manner that gets the desired results.  If people on here just kind of ""got it"", I think, ""good for them!""  But for those of us who read the Mumonkan and did not experience daikensho, I don't see a lot of practical advice in the absence of zazen, hua-tou, or koan study with a teacher.  It is no easy matter to tame one's inner demons and live like the masters of old - where can such a creature even be found nowadays?"
zen,3dystf,korhalf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:51 2015 UTC,"The thing is I don't see ""convention of your predecessors"", I'm definitely fired! If you have some excerpts on ""mastering the basics"" I would be interested in reading what they are. Mastering the basics, or any type of mastery sounds like the Northern Gradual School, but Huang Po says ""with the suddenness of a knife thrust"", what basics are there in that?   I understand the argument that like water coming to a boil, the meditation, the basics as you put it, the great doubt hua-tou, koan study, are seen as the preparation for true understanding. But those things are the pious practices that do not exist with Foyan, Joshu, Ummon or Huang po. What is there to be mastered in seeing clearly?"
zen,3dystf,SoundOfOneHand,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:26:39 2015 UTC,"""with the suddenness of a knife thrust"", what basics are there in that?    To best demonstrate this, I'd hand you a knife and put you up against a trained arnis de mano fighter.  Years of repetition and precise attention to form go into the martial practices, with the result of someone who performs fantastic deeds seemingly without effort.  Zen training is not dissimilar."
zen,3dystf,ewk,0,Mon Jul 20 20:01:31 2015 UTC,"Nope.  This is the same sort of faith-based hoopla that forms the foundation of all religions.  Not only do untrained people beat trained people all the time, in happens in jungles and on the streets and in nightclubs and on school grounds, but Zen Masters don't teach people to train themselves.  Zen is freedom arising from seeing the self nature.  Suddenly, no training necessary.  Which is why Zen Masters tells stories about the seeing, arising, no training necessary."
zen,3dystf,SoundOfOneHand,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:53 2015 UTC,"untrained people beat trained people all the time   It happens, but odds are with the master. Some people attain mastery very quickly, for others it is slower.  Huineng did so just by hearing a passage from the Diamond Sutra.  Bodhidharma sat for nine years. YMMV, but I have never read a Zen master explicitly say ""no training necessary,"" and there's a reason for that."
zen,3dystf,ewk,-2,Tue Jul 21 00:38:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, now it's down to ""odds"" is it.  No Zen Masters teach training.  No Zen Masters teach that Bodhidharma was ""training for nine years"".  Do you study Zen?  Or are you hoping that the ""odds"" are going to help you out?"

This is where you and the Zen lineage part company.  Zen Masters don't teach ""break from forms"" because they don't teach forms.  It began with ""Void and nothing holy"" and continued on in the same fashion.  People who believe in special attainment and there being some method(s) for arriving at such attainment are talking about religion, not Zen.   I don't see a lot of practical advice in the absence of zazen, hua-tou, or koan study with a teacher   This is precisely what is holding you back.  You think you know what ""practical advice"" is, so you go to church people hoping that their authority can solve some problem for you.    Why not study Zen while you are here?  Or do you think that Wumen, Yuanwu and Wansong, three Zen Masters who wrote books of practical advice on the study of Zen, don't know what they are talking about?"
zen,3dystf,dota2nub,2,Mon Jul 20 23:36:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people like Bankei tell us a lot about how they meditated. He said he metitated so much that he got sick and that it's a stupid thing to overdo it like that and that we shouldn't exert ourselves."

Not sure this is the point....  People who have no external authority to depend on, and know something clearly for themselves, don't need to pause to think and reflect on what the ""right"" answer should be according to those other authorities.  A mother can answer questions about her child instantly .... we need this kind of intimacy with the buddhadharma."
zen,3dystf,ewk,-6,Mon Jul 20 21:20:52 2015 UTC,"It is interesting that your conclusion is not one that the Zen Masters, even over a period as long as 800 years, took much interest in.  How about enlightenment?  How do you think that tunes the amygdala?"

Eventually you come to this wall, the aGreat Wall, and begin to study the math on the wall. Which explains Buddha. Which explains God. Which explains Cheist and everything else, right down to the needle of Zazen, right down to this moment riding a current of emptiness. You cannot ask who waved the curtain first or why it seems as it is. It simply is. The strongest math is no math, forgetful math, no comparative math, absolute math.

Wumen's Mumonkan is really cool. I look at random cases now and again when I get bored. What the heck is it with the thing about the foxes?  As for the shit, it depends on what kind of shit it is.

It is what Siddhartha awakened to and became ""Buddha"" and subsequently transmitted it.""  ""If you don't know the hautou you are not Zen. You will never understand what Wansong is talking about.""  3) Enlightened understanding is beyond the ordinary person ""[Enlightenment] is not a spiritual vision that can be understood by a prithagjana, a common person... If a person has a closed mind to realizing their Buddha-nature, there is nothing to realize except the nature of a worldling (prithagjana) which they are, already."" ""Yes, some of us (not all) have the ability to see our true nature.""  4) Good karma is required to enter the stream to nirvana. ( Paraphrased)  5) ""Zen"" isn't the name for the teachings of Bodhidharma's lineage. ""Whenever I say Zen I mean Saijojo Zen. Wumen and Wansong's dead words are incapable of revealing Saijojo Zen.""  6) There is no sudden enlightenment ""First, one had to become a Buddhist monk—then study lots and lots of sutras and meditate and walk to lectures. Maybe after 20 years they might awaken. It is not easy to become a Chanshi"".  7) There is only Buddhism, no Zen.    ""Zen is a diminutive for Zen Buddhism. There is, properly, no Zen sans Buddhism""  8) Zen Masters keep secrets.  ""Zen masters reveal the great family secret to the uninitiated.  They like to confuse the uninitiated""  9) Zen is a failed sutra study group.  ""Zen masters declined in their spiritual ability and had to resort to inferior Sutras of the second turning.""  "" ""Joshu, or Layman Pang, and Dongshan - Not one of them knew how to enter Buddhism's gateless gate. They violated the four slogans of Zen.""  10) Without faith there can be no conversation.

zen,3e0581,ewk,0,Tue Jul 21 00:53:46 2015 UTC,"Darkzen is just New Age Buddhism.  Nothing very interesting there.  Grandiose claims and the usual cult trimmings.  I don't know if songhill sees it that way.  I think it started when he linked to it one time and you know how people are, everybody started to speculate that he was involved in writing it.  Then of course he bragged about how he's been part of Zen forums ""for decades"" and people started looking through other forums... and he called himself ""songhill"" in those too... so when I ask him about it I'm genuinely curious... but he won't be held accountable for what he's said and done.  Songhill refuses to be honest about what he believes... so the crazy stuff he says sort of became a foundation for equally crazy stuff he probably said said elsewhere."

Morality is a faith-based construction.    800 years of Zen Masters, three books of instruction based on hundreds of poems of instruction... no eightfold path, no ten commandments... just Guishan saying he doesn't care how Yangshan conducts himself."
zen,3e0581,vymo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Do you think that someone could study zen, through koan study, zazen, or other means, with no regard to their own morality?  Is a Zen Master devoid of morality?"

zen,3dzflf,love-_0all,2,Mon Jul 20 22:01:48 2015 UTC,"It's a weird book.  The provenance is weird, the author's lineage is weird, the translation is weird.  It's weird when you only quote parts of it too, like the sentence before your quote, which says:   You can achieve Buddhahood in a single flash of thought.   Buddhists don't teach that, Soto Buddhism included.  It's just a whole bunch of weirdness.    It's almost as if the guy restated a bunch of different texts in one place.  For example:   You should know that setting forth the principle of deliverance in its entirety amounts only to this - when things happen make no response: keep your minds from dwelling on anything whatsoever: keep them for ever still as the void and utterly pure (without stain): and thereby spontaneously attain deliverance.   Note that no mention of sitting meditation occurs in this ""only this"" statement of deliverance.  And from one of the dialogues sections of the book:   Huihai: Please tell me to what you alluded when you spoke of a treasure house of my very own.  Mazu: That which asked the question is your treasure house.  It contains absolutely everything you need and lacks nothing at all.  It is there for you to use freely, so why this vain search for something outside yourself?   Then the text says that at these words Huihai experienced ""great illumination"" and ""recognized his own mind"".  Once again, no mention of whether anyone was sitting at the time of the conversation.  Wait!  Wait!  It gets better:   Huihai spent the next six years in attendance upon Mazu; but, as his first teacher was growing old he had to return to Yueh Chou to look after him.  There he lived a retired life, concealing his abilities and outwardly appearing somewhat mad.   wait for it...   It was at this time that he composed his book... later this book was stolen by Hsuan Yen, a disciple of his dharma brother, who took it to Mazu, who said that ""Yueh Chou there is now a great pearl"".   wait for it...   Once the Master began his daily address to his disciples by saying, ""I am no Chan adept; indeed, I have not a single thing to offer anyone, so I must not keep you standing here any longer... Go (to yourself)[to set your minds at rest.]   So I don't know.  As I've said in the past, it's harder to fake dialogue that it is to fake sermon text."

Just found a book, said ""Zen"", read somewhere in the middle and said ""hmmm, looks like a Zen"", and then somewhere midway through the author's preachy introduction had an eyebrow raised.  Hoped it wouldn't trickle down into the translation too, but sure thing - 2nd verse and here we are.  Hsuan Yen seems convinced there's a pearl in the mud - maybe I just need to read it all and see?"

zen,3dqwq6,songhill,2,Sat Jul 18 16:53:28 2015 UTC,"My life just about spans the entire history of American Zen. Those who've managed a profound satorical experience, even before they got into Zen, were interested in the mystical (e.g., Plotinus). They certainly didn't see Zen as some kind of self-help therapy. Then there were those who were Roshi/Guru followers. They never got very far either. I also have followed the development of Zen on the Internet. I was on the Internet before Netscape came along. I realized that the Internet was more like Dodge City. Yes, it was a great information center but no place for satori. Finding guidance in Zen from a teacher require a huge commitment on the part of the student. They have to be willing to sacrifice about everything in their most holy quest. And even that is no guarantee of success if they turn into Roshi/Guru ""followers."" /r/zen is just a water station. There comes a point when you have to move on. In the Lotus Sutra the water station is a phantom city.    The Phantom City (chapter 7)   A group of people are being led by a knowledgeable guide through a wilderness to a place where, they are told, they will find great treasure. After some time, the group become weary and disheartened and wish to turn back. The guide tells them that, just a short distance ahead, there is a city where they can lodge and refresh themselves. They enter the city, and, when they feel better, the city vanishes. The guide explains that he had created it by magic to satisfy their needs, and, now that it has fulfilled its purpose, he has made it disappear. The treasure, he says, is near, and if they make one more effort, they will find it. We are then told that the guide is the Buddha; the group of people are disciples; the phantom city is Buddhism; and the treasure is the Buddha Nature. ~ Forman, The Innate Capacity"

zen,3doqmc,Ostmeistro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:50:36 2015 UTC,"Is there to be a new policy of enforcing bans on consistent spammers and their alts?   Spamming is not allowed, but we will not instantly jump to a ban if we can avoid it. I think there are different types of spam. In this situation I felt that it was impeding the normal use of the subreddit. When people post things that don't have to do with zen, sometimes those people are serious in their conviction that it in fact IS related to zen. This is a greyer area that I will elaborate on later. As for ""and their alts,"" generally I think it is difficult to determine what actually constitutes as an alt or not.    Is the ""don't post personal information"" rule going to be enforced?   It has been and will continue to be enforced. From my perspective, the way ""personal information"" is meant in this situation is similar to the term ""Personally Identifiable Information (PID). These things include location, name, employment, etc. information that can be used to ""dox"" people. This is not allowed by the official rules of reddit. The mods can't see everything though so please report and message us if you see it happen.   Is content unrelated to this subreddit going to be removed?   What is considered ""related"" to the sub is a matter of contention. For example, I'm not one who finds dogen to be legitimate. Many (most?), i'm sure, find this to be ridiculous. Should I remove all soto stuff? At this time, I don't think so. Furthermore, in my opinion the discussion of ""is this related to zen or not""? is one that is welcome in this space.   Is there going to be discussion of these policies with the community?   there will not be discussion about enforcing the rules of reddit those will be enforced, as they are part of the terms of use for this website. It is my view that rules beyond those should be discussed.  As a reminder, there is a page about moderation in our wiki /r/zen/wiki/moderation."

If someone posts up links to the Scientology website claiming that L Ron Hubbard and his teachings are the way to the truth, they are implying by posting to this particular subreddit that their post has something to do with Zen.

You are talking about some kind of New Age spirituality that seems like something to you that you haven't studied only because you are vague about the spirituality and ignorant about what it is you are associating it with.  This ignorance and this vagueness are why you can't answer questions about what you believe.

zen,3doptp,love0_-all,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:53:41 2015 UTC,"Ok.  I employ the classic technique of concentration meditation.   It's also called Samatha (by the Buddhists) and Samprajnata Dhyana (translated : ""meditation with a seed"")(by the Raja Yogis).  It's dead-simple. The technique goes like this:  You hold your attention upon your Object as perfectly as you can for as long as you can.  Your Object is a thing that you can hold your attention on without too much trouble; a sound, a dot on the wall, a mantra, a visualization, a tactile sensation, the feeling of your breath, an idea. Anything, pretty much. They have lists. Different Objects work differently for different people, so one might want to experiment some. I like to use the tactile sensation of breath in the tip of my nose. It's popular.  That's it. That's the whole technique. There are some other things; like a good way to sit, a good diet, stuff that makes meditation go better - But ya that's basically it.  If you can hold your attention on your Object perfectly for 5 seconds then you are a concentration genius. It's super slippery tricky.  It's really is not complicated or weird. It's really simple. It just takes effort and perseverance to get good at; like body building or juggling or any other skill. The more you do it the better you get. And you get better fast if you do it a lot. 1/2 hour 5-times-a-day is a lot.  Concentration meditation makes you quiet. When you get quiet... well, there's this fog. It's around you right now, surrounding you, enveloping you. You call it ""reality"". When you get quiet this fog clears. Then you see.  It also has some cool side effects, like making your will stronger, your memory improves, you need less sleep. Lots of cool side effects.."
zen,3doptp,woodrail,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:15:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you. My concentration lasts almost all day. When it flags off are now the rare moments. That is what I mean by one pointedness.

Yes. I don't imagine Zhuangzi is talking about a karmic kind of attainment, but rather simply is using the best word for it. Bodhidharma uses ""attain"" several times, even though he talks about non-attainment. Laozi talks about non-attainment, even if Zhuangzi doesn't (from what i have read).

zen,3doec9,ewk,-2,Fri Jul 17 22:56:31 2015 UTC,From the scholarly perspective:    Zen Masters don't recognize them.  Zen Masters reject their teachings.  They teach stuff Zen Masters don't teach.   From the Zen perspective:  What do they teach that you think it is something to do with Zen?
zen,3doec9,endless_mic,5,Fri Jul 17 23:36:26 2015 UTC,"Huangbo says ""For example, when fishing, if one catches a fish, one should forget about the bamboo fish-trap."" That's directly from the Zhuangzi. I'm sure there are other examples; I'll look for some more. Where, and in what context? Zen masters teach things Zen masters don't teach. Seriously. There are some things Bodhidharma says that are not said by Huangbo, and some things Dongshan says that aren't said by Hongren. They're not as perfectly uniform as you make them out to be.    What do they teach that you think it is something to do with Zen?   The issue of whether or not Laozi and Zhuangzi are teaching the same thing is something that belongs on /r/taoism more than /r/zen. However, bear with me. Here are some quotes from Feng and English's Tao Te Ching:   Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.   Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations.   Look, it cannot be seen - it is beyond form.   Listen, it cannot be heard - it is beyond sound.   Grasp, it cannot be held - it is intangible.   These three are indefinable;  Therefore they are joined in one.   From above it is not bright;   From below it is not dark:   An unbroken thread beyond description.   It returns to nothingness.   The form of the formless,   The image of the imageless,   It is called indefinable and beyond imagination.  Oh, unfathomable source of ten thousand things!    The Zen masters also advice ceasing to chase after things, and talk about the Tao being beyond form and qualities, being ungraspable, and being the source of myriad things. One point of difference has to do with its origin -- the Zen masters don't tend to talk about the Tao being ancient, whereas the Taoists do."
zen,3doec9,ewk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:06:29 2015 UTC,"The Zen lineage will quote anybody.  I'm not sure if it's a Zhuangzi quote originally, although it is usually attributed to him.  Blofeld's note is interesting.  Anyway one quote isn't the same thing as what Huangbo says about Bodhidharma, for example. Zhaozhou specifically says he isn't a Taoist.  A general example would be that Zen Masters don't preach ""be like water"" nor are they interested in explaining the underlying nature/causality of being as the OP suggests. They are absolutely no uniform in what they say.  But they don't stray outside their focus at all.   Te Tao Ching is clearly focusing on how to govern the self and the people.  Zen Masters aren't interested in that.  Zen Master tell people to stop believing in chasing, they don't tell people to believe in formlessness."

zen,3do3rn,ewk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:22:53 2015 UTC,"As all things are buddha-dharma, there are delusion, realization, practice, birth and death, buddhas and sentient beings. As myriad things are without an abiding self, there is no delusion, no realization, no buddha, no sentient being, no birth and death. The buddha way, in essence, is leaping clear of abundance and lack; thus there are birth and death, delusion and realization, sentient beings and buddhas. Yet in attachment blossoms fall, and in aversion weeds spread.  [1]   TA / WA / Jaffe / Nishijima / Cook / Cleary / NS / Masunaga To carry the self forward and illuminate myriad things is delusion. That myriad things come forth and illuminate the self is awakening.  Those who have great realization of delusion are buddhas; those who are greatly deluded about realization are sentient beings. Further, there are those who continue realizing beyond realization, who are in delusion throughout delusion. When buddhas are truly buddhas, they do not necessarily notice that they are buddhas. However, they are actualized buddhas, who go on actualizing buddha.  [2]   TA / WA / Jaffe / Nishijima / Cook / Cleary / NS / Masunaga When you see forms or hear sounds, fully engaging body-and-mind, you intuit dharma intimately. Unlike things and their reflections in the mirror, and unlike the moon and its reflection in the water, when one side is illumined, the other side is dark.  [3]   TA / WA / Jaffe / Nishijima / Cook / Cleary / NS / Masunaga To study the buddha way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to be actualized by myriad things. When actualized by myriad things, your body and mind as well as the bodies and minds of others drop away. No trace of realization remains, and this no-trace continues endlessly. When you first seek dharma, you imagine you are far away from its environs. At the moment when dharma is correctly transmitted, you are immediately your original self.  [4]   TA / WA / Jaffe / Nishijima / Cook / Cleary / NS / Masunaga When you ride in a boat and watch the shore, you might assume that the shore is moving. But when you keep your eyes closely on the boat, you can see that the boat moves. Similarly, if you examine myriad things with a confused body and mind you might suppose that your mind and nature are permanent. When you practice intimately and return to where you are, it will be clear that nothing at all has unchanging self.  [5]   TA / WA / Jaffe / Nishijima / Cook / Cleary / NS / Masunaga Firewood becomes ash, and it does not become firewood again. Yet, do not suppose that the ash is after and the firewood before. You should understand that firewood abides in the phenomenal expression of firewood, which fully includes before and after and is independent of before and after. Ash abides in the phenomenal expression of ash, which fully includes before and after. Just as firewood does not become firewood again after it is ash, you do not return to birth after death.  This being so, it is an established way in buddha-dharma to deny that birth turns into death. Accordingly, birth is understood as no-birth. It is an unshakable teaching in the Buddha's discourse that death does not turn into birth. Accordingly, death is understood as no-death.  Birth is an expression complete this moment. Death is an expression complete this moment. They are like winter and spring. You do not call winter the beginning of spring, nor summer the end of spring.  [6]   TA / WA / Jaffe / Nishijima / Cook / Cleary / NS / Masunaga Enlightenment is like the moon reflected on the water. The moon does not get wet, nor is the water broken. Although its light is wide and great, the moon is reflected even in a puddle an inch wide. The whole moon and the entire sky are reflected in dewdrops on the grass, or even in one drop of water.  Enlightenment does not divide you, just as the moon does not break the water. You cannot hinder enlightenment, just as a drop of water does not hinder the moon in the sky. The depth of the drop is the height of the moon. Each reflection, however long or short its duration, manifests the vastness of the dewdrop, and realizes the limitlessness of the moonlight in the sky.  [7]   TA / WA / Jaffe / Nishijima / Cook / Cleary / NS / Masunaga When dharma does not fill your whole body and mind, you think it is already sufficient. When dharma fills your body and mind, you understand that something is missing. For example, when you sail out in a boat to the middle of an ocean where no land is in sight, and view the four directions, the ocean looks circular, and does not look any other way. But the ocean is neither round nor square; its features are infinite in variety. It is like a palace. It is like a jewel. It only looks circular as far as you can see at that time. All things are like this.  Though there are many features in the dusty world and the world beyond conditions, you see and understand only what your eye of practice can reach. In order to learn the nature of the myriad things, you must know that although they may look round or square, the other features of oceans and mountains are infinite in variety; whole worlds are there. It is so not only around you, but also directly beneath your feet, or in a drop of water.  [8]   TA / WA / Jaffe / Nishijima / Cook / Cleary / NS / Masunaga A fish swims in the ocean, and no matter how far it swims there is no end to the water. A bird flies in the sky, and no matter how far it flies there is no end to the air. However, the fish and the bird have never left their elements. When their activity is large their field is large. When their need is small their field is small. Thus, each of them totally covers its full range, and each of them totally experiences its realm. If the bird leaves the air it will die at once. If the fish leaves the water it will die at once.  Know that water is life and air is life. The bird is life and the fish is life. Life must be the bird and life must be the fish. You can go further. There is practice-enlightenment which encompasses limited and unlimited life.  [9]   TA / WA / Jaffe / Nishijima / Cook / Cleary / NS / Masunaga Now if a bird or a fish tries to reach the end of its element before moving in it, this bird or this fish will not find its way or or its place. When you find your place where you are, practice occurs, actualizing the fundamental point. When you find your way at this moment, practice occurs, actualizing the fundamental point; for the place, the way, is neither large nor small, neither yours nor others'*. The place, the way, has not carried over from the past, and it is not merely arising now.  *[Apostrophe added by compiler.]  [10]  TA / WA / Jaffe / Nishijima / Cook / Cleary / NS / Masunaga Accordingly, in the practice-enlightenment of the buddha way, to attain one thing is to penetrate one thing; to meet one practice is to sustain one practice.  Here is the place; here the way unfolds. The boundary of realization is not distinct, for the realization comes forth simultaneously with the mastery of buddha-dharma. Do not suppose that what you realize becomes your knowledge and is grasped by your intellect. Although actualized immediately, the inconceivable may not be apparent. Its appearance is beyond your knowledge.  [11]  TA / WA / Jaffe / Nishijima / Cook / Cleary / NS / Masunaga Mayu, Zen master Baoche, was fanning himself. A monk approached and said, “Master, the nature of wind is permanent and there is no place it does not reach. Why, then, do you fan yourself?”  “Although you understand that the nature of the wind is permanent,” Mayu replied, “you do not understand the meaning of its reaching everywhere.”  “What is the meaning of its reaching everywhere?” asked the monk again. Mayu just kept fanning himself. The monk bowed deeply.  The actualization of the buddha-dharma, the vital path of its correct transmission, is like this. If you say that you do not need to fan yourself because the nature of wind is permanent and you can have wind without fanning, you will understand neither permanence nor the nature of wind. The nature of wind is permanent. Because of that, the wind of the buddha's house brings forth the gold of the earth and makes fragrant the cream of the long river.  [12]  TA / WA / Jaffe / Nishijima / Cook / Cleary / NS / Masunaga"

The doctrine of Mūlamadhyamakakārikā by Nagarjuna brings me here. Perhaps you can say if this is the think link, because here is how I see it:  Buddha and Bodhidharma and Sawaki all realized the same thing. Nagarjuna realized Buddha and Bodhidharma realized Nagarjuna. Does Huangbo realize Nargarjuna? I say yes. But then he strides past.

zen,3do0ko,ewk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:07:10 2015 UTC,"D.T. Suzuki discusses dhyana and prajna in Huineng's text in Zen Doctrine of No-Mind.  While in Buddhism, at least according to the Soto Critical Buddhist Hakamaya, wisdom is can be communicated, in Zen dhyana is not reliant on words and sentences.  There are no  immutable concepts in Zen, no unalterable Dharma (Huangbo).  Suzuki's discussion of Huineng's use of dhyana and prajna revolves  around the metaphor of a lamp and it's light.  The light of the lamp is prajna, the lamp giving off the light is dhyana.  The presence of these two is not dependent on any activity or any wisdom."

zen,3dniiy,ewk,3,Fri Jul 17 20:16:29 2015 UTC,"The phrase ""historical context of the masters' religious development"" sounds like something added to what Zen Masters teach.   Why, yes! Don't you study Dogen's history? Same damn thing, but for everyone.   which wouldn't be Zen Masters' religious developement, but the development of somebody trying to misrepresent them.   Are you trying to misrepresent Dogen, then? I'm not just going to blindly listen to the ""Zen masters"" list you put out without going into the matter myself. Removing a phenomenon from its context is not an holistic way to study; nothing is originally devoid of context."
zen,3dniiy,Temicco,0,Fri Jul 17 20:30:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what your argument is... Dogen wasn't a historian... he was a fraud and a plagiarist which puts his texts squarely in the ""not reliable as a historian"" category.  The Zen Masters on the list are people that everybody agrees are Zen Masters.  I was going for ""universal consensus"", and aside from Dogen claiming that Baizhang invented Zazen and Huangbo ""totes ruined it"" I'm not understanding your objection is..."
zen,3dniiy,ewk,2,Fri Jul 17 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"Dogen didn't teach ""I'm a liar and a fraud"". To determine that, it is ultimately necessary to study his life, rather than just his work. Similarly, I'd like to know the historical context of the lives of the other Zen masters, which may end up being very relevant to the interpretation of their work.  If Bodhidharma, for example, was diddled by a Tiantai master (obviously we've gone into hypotheticals here) then he might be unnecessarily dismissive of Tiantai teachings. I'm not just going to take your word for who is an infallible Zen master, but rather am going to research their lives and what kind of situations they grew up and studied in. I don't get how you can suggest that studying somebody's historical context is a sign that you're trying to misrepresent them. Quite the opposite, in fact."
zen,3dniiy,Temicco,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:09:59 2015 UTC,"No.  Dogen is a fraud an a liar because of what he said, not because we examine his life.  It does turn out, in an academic discussion, that an examination of his life suggests that, like many frauds and liars, that lying and fraud wasn't a ""one time"" thing with him or even a ""couple of times"" thing.  We only get into the academic conversation because people of faith invite that by suggesting that Dogen is to be believed on his own merits.  Dogen said that Zen Masters teach things that they don't teach.  That's him, testifying in his own trial.  There isn't a question of fallibility in the Zen lineage because they don't claim stuff is true.  Dogen says, ""I got this miraculous prayer-meditation from Buddha and Bodhidharma!  It's totes true so you should obvi be doing it!""  In contrast, who is Wumen's teacher?  Wansong's?  Yuanwu?  Do these Zen Masters who wrote books around the time of Dogen claim authority has been handed to them along with a ""secret method""?  It's ridiculous.  If there wasn't Soto in this forum trying to preach the revealed truth from Dogen the prophet then historical fact wouldn't be all that relevant.  People would just read Dogen and go, ""That's not Zen, that's church"" and move on."

On the one hand I can see the argument playing out that /r/Zen has the same collective white-male-troll-rage that is driving the Reddit admins to begin banning whole subs, the rage that  Pao saw firsthand that led to her concern that ""trolls are winning"".  Are they though?  Or is it just that she didn't spend much time with the deteriorating lower middle class?  On the other hand it seems like we are this tiny little corner of the internet and the people who post religious doctrines and roll alts in here and rage and spam and get hysterical about literacy are coming here and not any random place.  So I can see how maybe the argument plays out that ""Zen"" was a name where they thought they could hide their crazy with dignity.

How legit are any of the religious Dharmas?  Theravada's?  Based on sutras that contradict each other?  Soto's dharma fits right in.  I'm saying that as long as Soto continues to avoid addressing it's past and insists on lying to people about what Soto means and where it comes from then it will continue to delegitimize itself even on the cushion.  The first step is admitting you have a problem.  Take the Pope for example.  He apologizes, he doesn't make excuses, he moves forward.  Soto needs some people with that kind of integrity.  Shunryu Suzuki types aren't going to get the job done.  It will be interesting to watch the so called ""Rinzai"" school of Dogen Buddhism react to Soto getting some integrity.  I mean if it ever happens."

zen,3dj403,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:33:45 2015 UTC,"The term ""thoughtlessness"" would seem to recommend a mind free from any thoughts, but Hui Neng denies this: rather, ""thoughtlessness"" is the function of a mind free from any attachment.   The implication is that for someone who is liberated thoughts still arise, but there is no clinging to them when they do. Why the term ""thoughtlessness"" can be used to characterize such a state of mind will become clear in a moment. But the question that arises first is in what way one can ever be attached to thoughts if, as the Śiksāsamuccaya says, a thought has no staying power, that like lightning it breaks up in a moment and disappears"
zen,3dj403,drances,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"This interpretation invites comparison with some philosophical views on telepathy. From his own researches, H.H. Price concluded:  It looks as if telepathically received impressions have some difficulty in crossing the threshold and manifesting themselves in consciousness. There seems to be some barrier or repressive mechanism which tends to shut them out from consciousness, a barrier which is rather difficult to pass, and they make use of all sorts of devices for overcoming it. .... It is a plausible guess that many of our everyday thoughts and emotions are telepathic or partly telepathic in origin, but are not recognized to be so because they ,are so much distorted and mixed with other mental contents in crossing the threshold of consciousness. [30]  This could serve as a description of how prajña is filtered and distorted into vijñana. It also raises the question whether psi phenomena such as telepathy and precognition are natural aspects of prajña-intuition (about whose function there is always something essentially mysterious) which has been freed from such distortions. Claims to psychic powers are traditional to all the nondual Asian traditions. For example, according to the Pali sutras the Buddha had such faculties as ""heavenly ear"", the ability to hear sounds very far away. Are mental powers such as telepathy perhaps the natural function of the mind when ""interferences"" are eliminated?"

zen,3dkfgu,TotesMessenger,33,Fri Jul 17 02:09:38 2015 UTC,"You are immersed in faith-based Japanese Buddhism.  The Japanese were duped by a plagiarist and a fraud named Dogen in the early 1200's.  Dogen told them he was teaching them Zen, but he taught the Japanese a new kind of Buddhism that he invented.  While this is no reflection on Japanese artistic expression or on the Japanese character, some Japanese people, notably the great scholar D.T. Suzuki, have done much to correct the fraud perpetrated on the Japanese by Dogen.  Anyone who has a keen appreciation for Justice and honor, as you yourself no doubt do, would of course not want to perpetuate this fraud by calling Japanese Buddhism by the name ""Zen"".  Here, for example, is a book written by a Zen Master:  http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/zen/mumonkan.htm    You will note that there is no discussion of Dogen's ""Zazen"" in this text, no references to art or swordsmanship, no discussion of Ki energy, and nothing that soldiers would find relevant to their lives.  All of that stuff is Japanese Buddhism, and not Zen at all.  I should caution you that Japanese Buddhists, indeed all the Buddhists who look to Dogen as a religious figure, are very sensitive to the dawning realization that, whatever religious inspiration they have derived from Dogen, Dogen's religion and his prayer-meditation practice called ""Zazen"" are wholly a Japanese Buddhist creation and nothing to do with what Zen Masters teach.  No doubt you will be polite even as you remain honest and respectful toward both those to whom the name ""Zen"" refers as well as to those of the religion you are intent upon joining."

zen,3dkfgu,ewk,5,Fri Jul 17 00:56:50 2015 UTC,"I am not a religious person, myself, so religious histories are not interesting to me.  There is a Stanford scholar of Buddhism named Bielefeldt and he wrote a book called Dogen's Manuals of Zen Meditation in which Dogen's fraud is clearly explained.  No doubt you've heard of FukanZazenGi, the foundational text on Zazen?  It's largely a work of plagiarism, stolen from a Buddhist meditation manual that is unrelated to Zen.  You may also have heard of Shobogenzo, which is properly titled Dogenbogenzo, as the title was already quite famous when Dogen plagiarized it from a Zen Master.  All of this is readily available information.  Some priests know about it, some don't.  Some are honest about it, some aren't.  A person of honor would no doubt want to verify the facts of the situation for themselves anyway."

zen,3dkfgu,ewk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:23:51 2015 UTC,"I wonder, when exactly in the history of /r/Zen did doing an AMA become the gold standard for entering the path of the Zen Masters? Why is it necessary?"
zen,3dkfgu,songhill,0,Sat Jul 18 16:57:36 2015 UTC,"It's not a gold star.  It started because we have two groups of people in this forum that refuse to discuss Zen.   People who claim to be enlightened, and who want to talk about the doctrines they invented while refusing to discuss whether or not their invented doctrines relate to what Zen Masters teach. People who claim to represent a church that is ""real Zen"", who want to talk about their church's doctrines while refusing to discuss  whether or not their church doctrines relate to what Zen Masters teach.   By asking these people what they believe as part of an AMA one of two things happens very quickly:    They refuse to answer, they will not discuss their beliefs; or  They answer questions about their beliefs and it becomes apparent that their beliefs don't make much sense even to them and that they don't have much of an interest in Zen.   So we quickly find out if somebody is trolling the forum or if they are misguided.  Misguided people tend to take care of themselves, they often leave the forum after an AMA and sometimes they even delete their profiles.  Trolls, whether of the religious or commercial or lolz variety, aren't going to take care of themselves, they can't.  But exposing them as trolls provides the community with an opportunity to evaluate the contributions of said trolls in the context of trolling."

zen,3dhxyo,songhill,3,Thu Jul 16 14:33:19 2015 UTC,"Zen in the west has put too much emphasis on the physical side of zuochan/zazen (坐禪). This tends to ignore what dhyāna is about, namely, abandoning mental confusion; hopefully, to arrive at Mind in its real state which is unstirred and pure. It is very difficult to get here. Just sitting won't get anyone there. When Zen masters such as Huineng attacked zuochan it was an attack directed at just physical sitting which had become a ritual.

I'm genuinely curious, as you've brought it up a few times without elaborating and I don't see how that's a ""rookie"" thing, or even a ""bad"" thing (as suggested by ""a [secular] person can read a few Zen books and not comprehend what they are saying"")."
zen,3dhxyo,songhill,2,Thu Jul 16 15:33:43 2015 UTC,"According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ""secularize"" means the following:    To dissociate or separate from religious or spiritual concerns, to convert to material and temporal purposes; to turn (a person, his mind, etc.) from a religious or spiritual state to worldliness.   The key words are ""dissociate"" and ""separate from"" which when applied to Buddhism or Zen Buddhism will leave us with worldly Buddhism and worldly Zen that has no authentic relationship with either Buddhism or Zen Buddhism. They exist in name only.  The rookie reads a few books and imagines he or she fully understands what Zen is about. But they have only secularized it because they live in a secular society—it's all they know. They could not care less about Zen being a form of Chinese Buddhist mysticism. It is too alien for them to wrap their minds around."
zen,3dhxyo,Temicco,2,Thu Jul 16 15:47:51 2015 UTC,"""Secularize"" implies there was something holy to begin with... I also don't see how this is a ""rookie"" issue. This is simply a difference of worldview. My scientific materialism has caused me no issues in my study of Zen."
zen,3dhxyo,songhill,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"You are certainly a rookie when it comes to Zen if you think its message is a secular message. I should add that ""scientific materialism"" is a philosophical claim which I could say, implies that what man is can be totally explained in terms of the fundamental particles and the four forces of physics (they may have recently added a fifth)."
zen,3dhxyo,Temicco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:04:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that it's a school of mysticism; that much is obvious. I just don't think that mysticism is necessarily a ""religious"" thing, given all the implications of that word. Rumi denounced the Islam of his time just as Bodhidharma criticized the Buddhists. That obviously doesn't mean they're going ""woot, science"" (which would be a bizarre conclusion), but their beliefs differ sharply from the overarching organized religion of their time.   The rookie reads a few books and imagines he or she fully understands what Zen is about. But they have only secularized it because they live in a secular society—it's all they know.   Where are you seeing this happen? Are you saying some people remove even the mysticism from it?   ""scientific materialism"" is a philosophical claim which I could say, implies that what man is can be totally explained in terms of the fundamental particles and the four forces of physics (they may have recently added a fifth).   Yes, I'm aware. The one (big) issue with it (as it exists currently) is mentioned in Nagel's essay, ""What is it like to be a bat?"", but nonetheless I find it to be the most elegant and least contradictory position to take."
zen,3dhxyo,songhill,2,Thu Jul 16 16:16:34 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the opinions we have about what the word ""religion"" means, Zen is not secular. It certainly wasn't in Chinese culture which, incidentally, was not as hostile to ""mysticism"" as compared with the west which either ignores it or treats it as ""woo woo"". I would add that secularizing does go on in Buddhism (Stephen Batchelor) and in Zen with Dogen Zen which is heavily focused on ""just sitting"" which is a ritualization (行持 or 行事) of Zen practice."
zen,3dhxyo,Temicco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:14:04 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the opinions we have about what the word ""religion"" means, Zen is not secular.   Our opinion about the word ""religion"" is entirely relevant if you're accusing somebody of ""dissociating or separating [Zen] from religious or spiritual concerns"".  The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy defines ""mysticism"" as    A (purportedly) super sense-perceptual or sub sense-perceptual unitive experience granting acquaintance of realities or states of affairs that are of a kind not accessible by way of sense-perception, somatosensory modalities, or standard introspection.   which applies to Zen.  Is your definition of ""secular"", in other words, more about the removal of mysticism rather than the removal of ""holiness""?  If religion is ""holiness"", then Zen is not religious (cf. Bodhidharma and Huangbo), and as such cannot be secularized.   If religion is ""mysticism"", then Zen is religious, and therefore can be secularized.  If religion is about both holiness and mysticism, and a few other elements (like terminology and monks and monasteries), then Zen is partly religious, and as such can only be secularized in that its mystical and ""other"" elements can be removed. This third way is how most people view religion, IME. However, even the Zen masters make clear that it's the mysticism that's the bones of Zen. Does Stephen Batchelor propose that there is no such thing as enlightenment? Only then could he be said to be secularizing Zen.  Also, mysticism doesn't go against the grain of scientific materialism, which is what I thought Stephen Batchelor was advocating. One can be both a mystic and a scientific materialist."

zen,3dfss7,TedJenssen,2,Thu Jul 16 00:02:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm a pot smoker, so there's that bias I've been examining for some time now. Ultimately I know I'm going to give it up, but still carry the attachment due to the desire to feel ""not bored"" or just as a comfort to the general discomfort I feel daily (dukkha, lol). It's a lot easier to notice when I'm under its effects. Other than that, I'm lazy, and so I'm also examining that. There are quite a few Zen masters (Dongshan comes to mind) who insist that the matter of enlightenment is realization, not a changing and molding of desired states of mind and perceived weaknesses/strengths.    I'm biased against meditation. Hanging around here and taking a lot of the claims here at face value can do that. I still meditate from time to time, but I'm disillusioned with its perceived 'benefits'.  Ultimately, I'm oddly enough biased against most of the things that interest me. I get stuck on the thought of ""okay, so I don't like some of these things, but do I need to change? Do such things even matter? And while I feel I look quite the fool for my openness, I can only do so in hopes that someone else out there knows they aren't alone."
zen,3dfss7,songhill,2,Thu Jul 16 00:09:42 2015 UTC,"Reading this reminds me of myself.   ""okay, so I don't like some of these things, but do I need to change? Do such things even matter?   An interesting point and one I've considered often. For me it comes down to two things.   Be content with yourself as you are, this moment is perfect as is. Change isn't a choice, it's an inevitability. Things change, you change, nothing really changes. What you do, your actions, reflect how you change and in what manner. The only good reason to do something is because you want to. I didn't want to be fat and lazy anymore. It was quite a shock when I realized it was a choice and decision. I happen to be more retarded than most though. Or just in deep denial. Trapped in my own mistaken beliefs etc.   Nothing is real, nothing is true, nothing matters, do whatever you want and the only thing you have to believe in is yourself. I should write a children's show. Believe in yourself, that's the place to start."

zen,3dfss7,songhill,0,Thu Jul 16 01:24:03 2015 UTC,"Have you talked to a mental health professional? Pot is a lot more innocuous as a form of substance abuse then, say, alcohol is due to the lack of physical dependency and liver failure if you're concerned you're taking it to escape other feelings such as ennui or depression. So it can be falsely regarded as an activity that is healthy ""in moderation"" even though ""in moderation"" for active users is completely different than those who partake socially or medically.  Meditation is definitely a healthy activity for those who don't have certain physical disabilities or are undergoing mental health problems, in these cases in can exacerbate already existing conditions i.e. hyper tension, anxiety, poor circulation, depression.   This is less a conversation about ""bias"" as it is about health."

I can let go and not need it, but I do think it's a slippery slope. Lately I've been examining the 'escape' part and how other activities that are seemingly harmless can also be forms of escape, like reddit for example, or video games. Then again, what part does health play in enlightenment? Sure, sickness, old age, and death can bring about suffering, but that's I think if there is clinging or aversion involved. While I'm not advocating a 'fuck it man just let it all go' approach here, I am curious of the correlation between health and enlightenment, if one exists.

This particular manufactured controversy has been happening here for a long time. When enough people get together and agree on it, it takes on the illusion of an actual conflict.   What's really happening here is nothing. Just people talking. On the listening end, we hear this and that, apply filters to it, judge it, and stick it in a box. Since we deal so much with pairs of boxes (good/evil, light/dark, warm/hot) we are comfortable building boxes in pairs.   That doesn't say anything about the stuff we're trying to organize. It just tells people how good you are at building boxes. The boxes can be very useful to store things temporarily, but when we insist that things belong in boxes, then we have a problem. Like a lightbulb... does it go it that ""light"" box, or the ""warm"" box. Or what about the ""electric"" box? Or the ""glass"" box. Or the millions of other boxes we could build for it? What box does ""happy"" go in? What box does ""death"" go it? What box does ""atman"" go in?  Ewk and songhill both have one of these. Neither one of them has a special thing that is inaccessible to the other.  If you can peer through the dust (since it will never settle) then what you might find is that the people who complain the loudest about ""where things belong"" are usually trying to build your boxes for you.

zen,3debjg,songhill,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:34 2015 UTC,"/u/songhill is a ""Master"" of a new quasi-religious sect that he invented called ""Dark Zen."" He put up an ""interview"" where he claims, among other things, to have uniquely rediscovered the actual meditation teaching of the Buddha:   Our mediation is different from all other meditations is this respect. It is the most advanced and yet the most simple to execute. We believe it was the meditation of Gautama the Buddha which has long since been forgotten but was rediscovered by me in 1991 without any help from the canon. I simply put two and two together.   It also explains a bit about why he's so afraid of /u/ewk:   Mara the Evil One has been busy in our neck of the woods, you could say, trying to prevent the Buddhic light from entering into our world. This is no joke. Evil is quite real in Buddhism and there are many who wish us ill.   He also makes some rather dubious claims about aesthetic valuation and storytelling:   Interviewer: I find it so amazing you enjoyed the movies directed by Peter Jackson and were able to see them as echoing Buddhist ideas.  Dark Zen: The Lord of the Rings movies by Peter Jackson were awe inspiring. All who participated in the movie put their hearts into it. My hat is off to everyone who helped put this epic on the screen. For our youth it offered inspiration that it is time to throw materialism back into Mount Doom. And for us crotchety old spiritual warriors of the past [laughing] it gave us faith that not everybody is stark raving mad.   In short songhill represents a kind of battle of good and evil where he is good and everyone who questions his authority is either literally a manifestation of the devil or a deluded being on the fast track to hell.  If by religion you mean bowing down to a statue of the Buddha, Huangbo himself did that without making a big deal out of it."

zen,3dc8ar,ewk,2,Wed Jul 15 06:12:58 2015 UTC,"Here is what I mean: by meditation I mean techniques for manipulating awareness or consciousness.  when feeling trapped in repeating patterns negative cognitions, practicing saying some word or phrase out loud can help move awareness away from internal patterns of negative thinking and toward and external experience of sound, refocusing the mind on the external world.  A negative consequence of this technique is that as awareness moves it destroys whatever process of thought you may have felt yourself trapped in. You could think of it as a form of escapism, which is fine. Sometimes people need to escape their cage.  The trouble is thought is habitual. You might think of this as learning; like muscle memory for the mind.  So a happier, healthier person might find themselves in a position in which they're interested in exploring negative cognitions, but find themselves automatically and reflexively employing this technique the moment negative feelings arise. A person in this situation might cut off the process of moving awareness away from the internal process of thinking, then use memory to try to reconstruct the pattern of negative thought, which is no easy thing as the destruction of the thought process can be quite complete.  Likewise a meditative process which tries to focus awareness on particular objects of concentration can be useful. It can produce a task oriented mind, as well as clarity and organization of cognition. A negative consequence of this sort of focus based practice seems to be a narrowing of awareness.   Focus practice involved cultivating a mind which filters out extraneous information, information which doesn't involve the object of concentration. Some certainly need to develop this skill, but this sort of one pointedness can mean loosing track of anything not involving the object of concentration, which is fine for a monk or yogi living a simple life, but maybe not so great for someone who needs to keep track of a complex life involving a number of competing interests. By the way, did you know one conception of add involves excessive focus? Insight practice may be a good cure for this sort of problem, but at this point we've run up against the limits of my experience.  And of course, just like everyone responds to medications which tend to produce generalizable effects in their own unique and individual way, so to are people's experience of there internal world different. I've found for instance that as someone who tends to be more verbally oriented, talking to people who are more specially/visually oriented about their internal experience is like trying to talk to someone who doesn't speak the same language.  So here I've given you two meditative techniques with two separate sets of consequences. I hope that Clarifies things."

But to take this hardcore view and superimpose it over Zen is totally unjustified. This is what ewk and Rockytimber do.

The history of the etymology of dhyana in China also sharply diverges from your ""dhyana equals meditation"" dogma.  It doesn't appear that anybody ever meant ""meditation"" when they said Zen until the Buddhists tried to redefine the Zen lineage.  If you want to go along with that, sure.  I mean it's not very honest and it exposes your religion as a fraud, but hey, give it a shot.  As long as nobody who studies Buddhism or Zen or language or reads a book shows up maybe you hand out enough church pamphlets to make it ""true"".  Nobody has to listen to me.

zen,3d915l,sdwoodchuck,8,Tue Jul 14 17:13:13 2015 UTC,"This is a well known Buddhist story, and one that means a lot of different things depending on where you're hearing it from.  We're hearing it in the context of Zen; so what does that tell us?  Like Gutei's Finger and Joshu's ""Mu,"" in the Buddha's Flower, we have another example of something presented with no explanation, which defies our attempts to attach a meaning to it, and in doing so provoking a response.  Again, try as you might to attach a meaning to it, you're forced to come to the conclusion that it is you attaching that meaning, not a meaning inherent in the gesture.    We're hearing it from Mumon, who tells you that this story presents the Buddha ""selling dog meat labeled as mutton.""  What is he getting at with this?  Let's take note that the focus of the story, the point where it reaches its climax, is in the Buddha's presenting the transmission of his teaching to Mahakashyapa.  Considering that Zen holds no specific practice, or belief, or scripture to be holy, transmission of anything seems nonsensical.  So what is being transmitted is this ""True Dharma Eye, the Marvelous Mind of Nirvana, the True Form of the Formless, and the Subtle Dharma Gate, independent of words and transmitted beyond doctrine.""  That's an awfully big mouthful to describe what is essentially the lack of dualistic, conceptual, discriminating mind.    So let's take it piece by piece.  The Buddha holds up a flower.  There is no meaning behind this gesture, though nearly everyone in attendance (and every reader) tries to find a meaning to derive from it.  In reality, it is an ordinary gesture, trying to provoke the audience to dismiss that part of their mind that craves to conceptualize.  Mahakashyapa smiles, and the Buddha declares him the recipient of the transmission.  However, nothing is transmitted.  Mahakashyapa simply sees the lack of meaning in the gesture.  It's not that something special was transmitted only to Mahakshyapa.  In fact, the whole of the exchange is entirely lacking in anything special or conceptual.    However, the Buddha gives it a grand label, and makes it seem exclusive.  This what Mumon means when he says that he's selling dog meat as mutton.  He's taking something that isn't special, and making it seem special in order to turn heads.  Why would he do this?  To get others investigating of course.  To make them think themselves in circles.  He is setting the trap that will exhaust their thinking, and hopefully once that thinking is exhausted, they'll get it as well.    Mumon also asks, what would have happened if Mahakashyapa hadn't smiled?  What would have happened if everyone had smiled?  Wouldn't the Buddha's grand plan have been ruined?  It's worth noting that this story is almost certainly not historical, so it is best not to look at it as a testimony of ancient fact.  It is firmly in the realm of legend, and Mumon either knows this, or is at least using the story in that way.  Asking questions about ""what would have happened if this had happened differently?"" are specifically designed to trip you up, in precisely the same way that the Buddha's grand description was designed to trip up his followers.  In exactly the same way as Hyakujo's student's question about ""what would have happened if the monk had given the correct answer"" in case 2 is a trap to test his teacher.    Trying to break down the circumstances of the koan doesn't help you.  That is the same as trying to derive an explanation from the Buddha's flower.  The fictional nature of it doesn't matter; here it is in front of you, presented only as it is.  Cast away your discriminating mind and see it, simple and ordinary.  Don't be deceived by the convoluted ""True Dharma"" label, or by the mentality that this is exclusive or limited.  Otherwise, Mumon has also sold you dog meat labeled as mutton."

Goenka has been teaching vipassana for more than thirty years, he said:  The Burmese government invited me to discuss with the leading monks the reason why I don't use the word ""Buddhism."" I told them that the words “Buddhism” and “Buddhist” do not exist in Pali. In the entire words of Buddha and in the commentaries, the word boddh—the equivalent of “Buddhist”—is missing. Buddha taught only dhamma. Dhamma means the law of nature, truth. Those who follow that are called dhammiko. If Buddha never made anybody a Buddhist, who am I to make someone a Buddhist? If Buddha didn't teach Buddhism, who am I to teach Buddhism? Buddha taught dhamma; I am teaching dhamma. Buddha made people dhammiko; I am making people dhammiko."

Zazen in my rustic cottage  Is peaceful, lonely, and truly comfortable.   and    The moon shines on the river,  The wind blows through the pines--  Whose providence is this long beautiful evening?  The Buddha-nature jewel of morality  Is impressed on the ground of my mind,  And my robe is the dew, the fog, the cloud, and the mist.   And finally, from Du Mu:   For one thousand miles there is the sound of orioles---  reds set amid greens;  Tavern flags flutter in the breeze in river villages  and walled mountain towns  Four hundred and eighty temples were built  during the Southern dynasties,  A multitude of towers and pavilions in the misty rain."

zen,3d7aob,brucenasty,2,Tue Jul 14 12:04:09 2015 UTC,good evening good fellow! when do you have mushin in daily life? how do you explore your myouyo?
zen,3d7aob,monkeyswithmirrors,3,Tue Jul 14 04:23:30 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, it's not possible to have mushin in daily life because if you had mushin, it wouldn't be mushin. Like Bodhidharma said, If you attain anything at all, it’s conditional, it’s karmic. It results in retribution. It turns the Wheel. Of course this also includes attaining mushin. Conventionally, you just stop looking for something else. Drinking tea, or mowing the lawn, is good enough.   As for myouyo, I don't know. I never heard that word before, don't know what it means."
zen,3d7aob,brucenasty,2,Tue Jul 14 04:40:36 2015 UTC,"yes, i too think it is impossible to have mushin entirely in daily life. i am talking of actions, as there are moments in our lives when we are attached to thought and emotions, impossible not to as we are human beings, and so there are also moments in our lives when we can attain mushin. tea and mowing lawn sounds nice.  i am sorry, i just realized i was confusing a japanese word with the zen/buddhist term. myoyu (not myouyo, which means something similar) is hard to describe in words, but it is in a sense an artistical representation of our true selves. like the entirely unique structure of one's dna, a unique myoyu is found in actions done under complete instinct, complete mushin. when we let go of all attachments to perform, myoyu can be found, the personality that is devoid of consciousness, or the true self."
zen,3d7aob,brucenasty,2,Tue Jul 14 05:04:06 2015 UTC,"If there's no mushin in daily life, why is practice emphasized?"
zen,3d7aob,brucenasty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:20:15 2015 UTC,there is mushin in daily life. just parts of it is possible. it is impossible to have mushin entirely throughout daily life because that would mean acting as an animal where every direction is based on instinct. we are humans and must think and have emotions.
zen,3d7aob,brucenasty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:21:44 2015 UTC,"What I meant was that if you have some notion in your mind of ""I'm trying to get mushin"" or ""I have mushin"", then by definition that isn't mushin because mushin doesn't keep any notions of anything. Mushin doesn't even keep mushin."
zen,3d7aob,songhill,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:18:46 2015 UTC,"yes you are correct about this nature of mushin, which is why we must strive for it, because when we revert back to our human-self equipped with the conscious voice we can look back into our mushin state and reflect on the unveiling of our true nature.  it sounds like you are making excuses to not perform with mushin. if you do not practice action without attachment, and instead just think of theories on zen life, how do you know?"
zen,3d7aob,sodamop,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:20:25 2015 UTC,it sounds like you are making excuses to not perform with mushin   I don't think that's the case. It's just more like the mushin of no mushin.
zen,3d7aob,sodamop,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"hmm.. to me this sounds like a romantic idea. i do understand the importance of 'not trying to be/do something', but to me it is important to understand humans are naturally equipped with conscious thought and emotions that generate ego and interfere with a sense of true nature. to not be aware of and then try to de-attach yourself from these thoughts and emotions, they are still present whether you believe they exist or not. if you are truly living entirely without conscious thought and emotion, truly enlightened and totally de-attached from worldly definitions and boundaries, ""with the mushin of no mushin"", then kudos to you."
zen,3d7aob,throw_zen_away,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:53:45 2015 UTC,"important to understand humans are naturally equipped with conscious thought and emotions that generate ego and interfere with a sense of true nature. to not be aware of and then try to de-attach yourself from these thoughts and emotions, they are still present whether you believe they exist or not.   I would agree, all except for the part that implies that thoughts and emotions will always ""generate ego"". Thoughts and emotions are not really the problem, abiding in them is the problem.   Reminds me of the 6th patriarch platform sutra:   ""No-thought"" means ""no-thought within thought."" Non-abiding is man's original nature. Thoughts do not stop from moment to moment. The prior thought is succeeded in each moment by the subsequent thought, and thoughts continue one after another without cease. If, for one thought-moment, there is a break, the dharma-body separates from the physical body, and in the midst of successive thoughts there will be no attachment to any kind of matter. If, for one thought-moment, there is abiding, then there will be abiding in all successive thoughts, and this is called clinging. If, in regard to all matters there is no abiding from thought-moment to thought-moment, then there is no clinging. Non-abiding is the basis   I don't believe that mushin means ""entirely without conscious thought and emotion"". In fact, that's a gross misunderstanding of what mushin means. It just means you don't abide in them. AKA, ""Non-abiding is man's original nature"". Nowhere in the Platform Sutra, Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment, Diamond Sutra, or any other major Ch'an text, is the term ""no-mind"" explained to be a incapacitation of the thinking faculty or the cessation of all conceptual activity. It just means non-abiding in anything."

zen,3d3ek9,thecultisalive,2,Mon Jul 13 18:03:23 2015 UTC,"""The Japanese have a word, yugen, which has no English equivalent whatsoever.  Yugen is in a way digging change.  It's described poetically;  You have the feeling of yugen when you see out in the distant water some ships hidden behind a far-off island.  You have the feeling of yugen when you watch wild geese suddenly seen and then lost in the clouds.  You have the feeling of yugen when you look across Mt Tamapeis, and you've never been to the other side, and you see the sky beyond.  You don't go over there to look and see what's on the other side, that wouldn't be yugen. You let the other side be the other side, and it invokes something in your imagination, but you don't attempt to define it to pin it down.  Yugen.  So in the same way, the coming and going of things in the world is marvelous. They go. Where do they go? Don't answer, because that would spoil the mystery. They vanish into the mystery. But if you try to pursue them, you destroy yugen. That's a very curious thing, but that idea of yugen, which in Chinese characters means, as it were, kind of ""the deep mystery of the valley.""  There's a poem in Chinese which says, ""The wind drops, but the petals keep falling. The bird calls, and the mountain becomes more mysterious."" Isn't that strange? There's no wind anymore, and yet petals are dropping. And a bird in the canyon cries, and that one sound in the mountains brings out the silence with a wallop.  I remember when I was a child in the Pyrenees in the southwest of France. We went way up in this gorgeous silence of the mountains, but in the distance we could hear the bells on the cows clanking. And somehow those tiny sounds brought out the silence. And so in the same way, slight permanances bring out change. And they give you this very strange sense.  Yugen.  The mystery of change.""  ~ Alan Watts"

Not questioning, just feeling that ""yeah so this was someone and they are now going that way somewhere"". It's a sort of satisfying feeling. Maybe not the same thing that they call 'yugen', but I don't really care what we call it or whether we give it a name or not."

zen,3d3ek9,mujushingyo,2,Mon Jul 13 05:50:47 2015 UTC,"I defer to you in all matters pertaining to Zen.  Although your response does seem to reflect that you don't have a proper understanding of Yugen. It's not really about being carefree, but about letting the mysterious remain a mystery, without desires to plumb for secrets.   To sit on one side of a river, and allow the other side to maintain its mystique. A woman is more beautiful in lengiere, enough left unsaid to entice the imagination. Contemplation of the unknown without desire to know.  You see the trouble with knowing the unknown, is finding how familiar and mundane it is. A woman farts and wipes her ass like the rest of us and you'll find the other side of the river much the same as the one you are on. Much better to let some things maintain an air of mystery."

zen,3d3ek9,ewk,-3,Tue Jul 14 04:43:17 2015 UTC,"Letting mysteries remain mysterious is not Zen.  It's a little like there are a bunch of tribute bands that all call themselves the Beatles.  Most of them don't even know the lyrics to any Beatles songs.  Instead those groups perform Elvis hits.  Other tribute bands calling themselves the Beatles play Beatles songs but can't write their own music.  All these tribute bands claim to be direct descendents of the Beatles via relationships with people who worked for record labels around the time of the Beatles.  So when you come in here and want to talk about themes in the music of one of these tribute bands or how other artists have been influenced by these tribute bands it isn't really relevant, right?"

As far as what led me to getting all mystical; I just sorta fell into it. I was in art school, surrounded by weirdos. A friend gave a speech on meditation. I was playing with psychedelics at the time. Thinking about meditation and art. A room happened to be open at the local monastery. It was basically a conspiracy.  So I experimented with meditation techniques. There was something there, the ritual just needed to be scraped off. I needed to make it my own, dig? I tried various techniques; a couple handed to me by the monks at the monastery, some I got out of books. Experimented experimented. Found some stuff that worked for me. Hit it hard.

You refereed me to the Lanakavatara Sutra as the evidence that Buddha preached that 'original mind' is prior to and the creative element of our delusional acceptance in this material existence.  I do not understand the meaning or implications of ""a-theistic"" since it is a personal formulation, or some blending of concepts.  can you define what you mean by it?  Theology is ""the field of study and analysis that treats of [Mind] and of [Mind] attributes and relations to the universe"". I replaced God with Mind for the context of this exchange.

zen,3d0j5a,ewk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:53:52 2015 UTC,"That simply doesn't make follow. The word exists, this is plainly evident, and dictionaries have usages listed for the word, so your position would be an incredibly weak one, dishonest and strained to boot.  The issue it seems is that you think it is a meaningless term (despite you using it frequently, for example ""Buddhist compassion""), and from what I have gathered from reading a few of your pointed questions is that the reasoning for this is because it lacks a singular consistent usage across all people you have come across that may consider themselves ""Buddhists"".  This seems to imply that the lack of an ultimate singular definition is your real sticking point in claiming the term is meaningless. Which is why I asked, because multiple, contextually-dependent usages are certainly sufficient for the terms validity (or to use your thinking ""proving"" a word), especially a complicated term like Buddhism.   You seem to have some presuppositions insofar as linguistics that just don't seem all that compelling to me."
zen,3d0j5a,pupilaskquestionnow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:11:20 2015 UTC,"No, people use a word, but they all mean whatever they like by it and the meaning only exists in the context of an individual's private values.

I encourage you to test my theory by providing a definition for ""Buddhist"" and a description of what ""Buddhists believe"" that we can xpost to /r/Buddhism.  If you think the word can be defined and the beliefs enunciated in a rational manner, then no doubt the consensus over there will support you."
zen,3d0j5a,ewk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:44:36 2015 UTC,"Your first statement is false, you claim it only exists in the context of an individual private values, despite it being listed in the dictionary and used and debated in secular scholarship.  You then prove my hunch about what you really mean by again appealing to the fact that there is a difference in use across the different ""churches"" as you say. The fact that there isn't a singular, universal usage doesn't negate the word or its functionality. Your assertion simply doesn't follow.  There are 32 thousand forms (or more) of Christianity, the fact remains, Christianity and Christian is still a word, one that can even be used objectively, for example measuring the number of people who self-identify as such.   Despite me thinking your position is uncompelling and even a bit incoherent, I still may engage in a similar experiment regarding the definition of Buddhist and Buddhism.   If I do it, it will regard a general consensus regarding the functional terms Buddhist/Buddhism, rather than trying to find an essentialist and uniform ""what is believed"". I think such a question is loaded and premised on a category error, as Buddhism isn't a singular tradition, but a broad and dynamic complex of traditions. It is almost as misguided as asking ""what do philosophers believe"", however the error in this question doesn't negate the fact that philosophy is still a valid category."
zen,3d0j5a,pupilaskquestionnow,0,Wed Jul 15 20:05:49 2015 UTC,"The ""secular scholarship"" argues that a) ""Buddhism"" was coined in the West in the 1800's in response to travel writing about foreign culture. Given that no unifying definition exists for ""Buddhism"" because there is no essential Buddhist teaching, no definition can hope to attain universal use. Whereas Christianity is bound together by a common belief in the deity of Christ as found in the Four Gospels, ""Buddhism"" has no hope of such a common ground since the sutras are neither connected to Buddha even vaguely nor do they take any common view of Buddha's supposed teachings.   I've asked you to define this ""consensus"".  I ask lots of people.  I find it odd that they refuse to answer and that they then reject Theravada, Mahayana, Secular and Critical Soto Buddhist definitions of Buddhism.  By ""odd"" I mean dishonest."
zen,3d0j5a,ewk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:44:18 2015 UTC,"This is a well known fact and in no way supports your case. The creation date is not relevant to its capacity for retroactive functionality. Again, seems pretty irrelevant as this also doesn't appear to support your case. I presented an alternative that can accommodate this fact. Namely multiple usages of the term that are contextually dependent. Your comment here seems all over the place. You made a nice claim but I don't see what you think that is necessarily true at all. How did you conclude that all 32 thousand sects (or more) that Christ was a deity? Furthermore that they all accept the four Gospels (which seems incoherent considering the historical development of these texts)? In your view before the Gospels there were no Christians? I have met and had conversations with many different kinds of self-identified Christians that fall out of your definition, some think he was just a man, that there was no dying for our sins, that most of the Gospels are corruptions. Hell some prefer the Gospel of Thomas and reject nearly all else. What is your response to this, I assume it will be something resembling an implicit ""no true Christian"" argument.   Furthermore, I don't see how you can claim that there is no hope for a common ground in Buddhism, or even if we accepted that, why such negates the functionality of using the term in various appropriate contexts.   What does the connectivity of the texts with the Buddha matter? The degree of connectivity is actually a scholarly issue and I wonder how you can claim definitively that there is no connection between the suttas and the Buddha. Furthermore, it can be said that many texts that some scholars say reflect a pre-sectarian Buddhism are much more connected to the Buddha than the four Gospels are to Christ.  I find it funny that on one hand you have a pretty strict standard for Buddhism, a uniform system of belief, but for Christians you posit something exceedingly vague as a connecting piece, and one that doesn't even seem to adequately hold water.  Are you claiming that all people you have asked refuse to answer or just refuse to play your particular semantic game, utilizing your personal linguistic presuppositions? How is having different usages of a term dishonest?  Thanks for your personal anecdote concerning some conversations you have with people who self-identify as Buddhist, I just don't find it enough to make the many radically sweeping generalizations you do.  Personally I see no real issue with using or choosing not to use the term, I usually speak of ""traditions under the banner of Buddhadharma"". Thus far, I don't think you have come remotely close to presenting a case for why using the term is an issue, especially since you very often use the terms yourself. Buddhist scholarship, Buddhist compassion, ""the Buddhist redefined zen"" and on and on. It seems like your rejection is more theoretical and not actually put into practice.  Thanks for taking the time to explain yourself though, even if I find most of it rather strained and uncompelling. As mentioned, I may indeed try to make a post on /r/Buddhism about the definition and see what comes from it. As mentioned, I have an interest in religious thinking and the minds of religious people, which is why I come to /r/zen."

Name some other taxonomies with ""multiple usages"" and then present me an argument where those taxonomies are used in an unspecified fashion by reasonable people.  You make an interesting point which undermines your argument, but I like it.  ""Self identified"" isn't an argument.  It's sociology, not comparative religion.  The fact that religious studies departments struggle to recruit talent is symptomatic of and evidenced by this very failure.  Somebody can ""self identify"" as a professional football player or even a reincarnation of Buddha.    Personally I see no real issue with using or choosing not to use the term, I usually speak of ""traditions under the banner of Buddhadharma"".   That's the same thing as ""Buddhism"".

Using Batchelor's reasoning, all of Buddhism is Hindu and therefore needs to be secularized to fit within a modern secular society.     Having read Batchelor, I do not think he believes “all of Buddhism is Hindu”    What do you find reasonable in this view?    Since I first was influenced by Buddhism many decades ago, I was always concerned by the overlapping of  Hindu tradition and their pantheistic tradition.  We are talking about a 2500 year old religious tradition steep in the cultural stew of a 4000 year old religious tradition.  There are roots going back into the Sanskrit texts.  In a world where the thoughts and writings of the “founding Fathers”, ideas just hundreds of years old, are contextually out of touch with the modern world, I find it reasonable to find a need to understand Buddhism within a modern context.  I have never been willing to plow through the language and Hinduism overlays in the original texts of Buddhism.  “ In secularized societies faith lacks cultural authority, and religious organizations have little social power.”  - Wikipedia  “the view that public education and other matters of civil policy should be conducted without the introduction of a religious element.” -dictionary . Com   I see this as a reasonable way to conduct affairs. The poster of the quoted comment seems to  imply that this is an attempt to rework Buddhism and strip it of whatever religious authority it holds.  I not sure that is the intent.  I see it more as making the core message(s) of Buddhism accessible to modern man.  As an atheist I find the bracketing off of the theological implications of “mind”, “rebirth”, “eternal existence” desirable, at least for me.  The notion of Mind as the source of existence is for me a solipsism and sophistry.  Saying that in r/Zen gets you called names.  I find the defense of Mind, the return to original mind, and mind as the universal (eternal) causative agent for existence, straying too close to a concept of God.  Given the context of the range of “gods” and deities in both Hindu an Buddhist texts, I do not accept such a religious expression of Buddhism.  Though I do not accept the tag “materialist” as it was applied to me in an earlier thread, I do not have any belief in existence after death, any kind of existence. We are born.  We live.  We die. Consciousness, Mind, do not survive. Consciousness and Mind are the derivatives of the complexity of the evolution of existence.  (I like Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's views here.)  For me there is much in Buddhism and Zen that appeals to me.  I also see the above as consistent with the Tao and the Tao Te Ching.  What I hear Batchelor saying resonates with my POV.

He speculated on how this pun might be involved in the meaning of Baizhang's fox.  In contrast, Ferguson speculated, for example, that Dongshan rejected Nanquan's teaching because he returned to teach at his first teacher's monastery and claimed the Caodong lineage.  That's not scholarship, that's wild conjecture unsupported by the text."

Sounds about right.   Their method conflated meditation and wisdom (dhyāna and prajñā) — two domains that were traditionally considered distinct if interrelated. It is here that we see remarkable parallels with contemporary Theravāda meditation movements.    I am not sure if they were distinct. In Jhana meditation they were interconnected, always.    the early Chan patriarchs similarly may have taken recourse in something akin to the modern notion of mindfulness.   That's because Jhana meditation has always been part of Zen Buddhism. Author starts of with a question ""what kind of meditation, what was it?"" but the answer is not elusive, it's been there all along, it was always Buddhist meditation, Anapanasati. Shenhui and emergence of subitsm is what caused most of the noise regarding Zen.   remarkable parallels with contemporary Theravāda meditation movements.   That's because there is no major deviation, just different focus. It's all in the major Mahayana sutras. Author even quotes Vimalakirti heavily which is consistent with Zen.

Chan-zong isn't as they became to be known after the word 'Chan' much later on and never really used the word internally as far as we know, opting for the much more common and appropriate term, Buddha-dharma （fo-fa 佛法）  （Japanese originated after Chinese and after Buddhism.

For example, he asserts that the arupa states where body appears to drop away and where no form objects can be found, are actually indicative of a Brahmanistic approach and one that the Buddha diverged from. Rather he asserts that the Buddha taught to take a similar preliminary absorption and then to mindfully apply it to sense objects, including body/form, rather than abide in ""bodylessness"" or ""objectlessness""."

zen,3cznxh,ewk,-1,Sun Jul 12 19:17:29 2015 UTC,"No.   Let's look at the text, shall we?    Why, [the barrier of the patriarchs] is this single word ""No."" That is the front gate to Zen. Arouse your entire body with its three hundred and sixty bones and joints and its eighty-four thousand pores of the skin; summon up a spirit of great doubt and concentrate on this word ""No."" Carry [no] continuously day and night. Do not form a nihilistic conception of vacancy, or a relative conception of ""has"" or ""has not.""    So, what have we learned?  Besides that you don't pay attention to what you claim you've read?   ""No"" is the front Gate. By ""method"" Mumon is talking about (a) arousing your body and bones and pores, (b) summoning great doubt; (c) concentrating on the word ""No""; (d) carrying around ""no"" day and night"" without vacancy, without separating ""has"" and ""has not"".   So not only are you mistaken that this is some kind of religious practice like Buddhist word attachment (sometimes called hautou), you appear to be confused about what Mumon says in a few short sentences.  Further, as I've said before, Mumon puts no particular importance on the first Case.  He even suggests that Joshu's dog isn't the first Case, but just randomly ended up there.

Perhaps the phrasing is the issue here -- ""concentration on wu"" is more accurate. It is exactly what Wumen's suggesting. He says, ""If you hold on without interruption, behold: a single spark, and the holy candle is lit!"" That sounds like causation to me.  I don't know why Huangbo says that ""by means of"" is deluded thinking, since it's exactly what Wumen is suggesting. Maybe I'll do an OP about it.  My assertion that hua-t'ou is about samadhi is encapsulated by your points c) and d). My assertion that it's also about great doubt is in your point b). And, to make it clear, I take hua-t'ou not as some kind of holy practice, but rather just as a word for an activity incorporating concentration and doubt around a particular word or phrase in a koan. That is what Wumen is advocating.   It's funny that you think there are ""elements"" though.   You laid out the elements yourself in your second bullet point. I don't get what your issue is.

If you don't know what they mean by ""concentrate"" though, then it doesn't matter what you try to focus on.  If you do know what they mean by ""concentrate"" then Wumen is just a silly windbag and his ""no"" game is just for laughs.  Again, you claim you know what Wumen is advocating... but you can't teach the other 47 Cases.  So you don't know.  You are just pretending out of cowardice.  There is no path in Zen.

It was a question about where you locate this supposed person you believe yourself to be talking to. Where is he in space? On what foundation do you base your ideas about what you think he sounds like? Where are you in this equation? Do you really believe that you exist as anything more than a transitory thought? Can you find your own head in space right now? Can you find ""failure"" or ""success"" right now, locating them clearly in space? If you cannot why do you believe they exist? Why does anything trouble you?

zen,3czbqx,bucon,2,Sun Jul 12 06:13:31 2015 UTC,"Attached to the feeling, are we? ;)  And I would disagree about the scholarship point -- scholarship allows me to figure out what claims are biased or downright false, as well as what different ways the same insight is brought about. Both Zen and Advaita Vedanta, (and possibly the inner tantras of Vajrayana? They're one of the areas I plan to research) essentially say that you're perfect (spiritually, not like totes perf), and no meditation or renunciation ( /precepts) is needed. Despite that, they both have a long history of teaching both meditation and renunciation. I want to get to the bottom of that, and a variety of other topics, before making my mind up too strongly as to my own discipline. I know intellect is not the Way, but I'd like to know the history and doctrinal relevance of whatever I adhere to, ya know?"
zen,3czbqx,songhill,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:35:23 2015 UTC,"I've been reading Surangma Sutra with Hsuan Hua's commentary and I didn't see anything ""religious"" there. Most people make mistake that Buddhism is strictly philosophical in nature. While some concepts are philosophical, a lot of them require practice. Buddhist doctrine emphasizes Four Noble Truth's, so following 8-Fold Path is required to understand advanced concepts and more esoteric sutras. There is no way around it.   You can try reading Red Pine's translations, they are less esoteric and he cites various commentaries. I have his Diamond Sutra and Lankavatara, both really good and well commented.   But like I said. Some concepts are not grasped by intellect without following the Way. Some might disagree and find it ""religious"" and naughty but it's the way it is. You can't talk about the fruit in its' whole totality without tasting the fruit."
zen,3czbqx,songhill,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:42:19 2015 UTC,"Theravada definitely emphasizes the four noble truths and the eight-fold path; I am hesitant to state that Buddhism as a whole does. I haven't properly looked into the matter, but from the reading I've done, Mahayana more often talks about the precepts and the paramitas. Hsuan Hua talks a lot about Theravadin doctrine, but he did actually have an agenda to fuse Theravada and Mahayana into one school, so I'm skeptical of him. However, lest I just make excuses to be lazy, I'll start up anapanasati again. I'll take precepts in a few years, when I ordain.  I'll check out Red Pine though, thank you!"

zen,3cx84k,songhill,2,Sat Jul 11 20:45:56 2015 UTC,Zen is not predicated on any contigencies. Someone sold you shoddy merchandise.
zen,3cx84k,Pistaf,2,Sat Jul 11 16:15:50 2015 UTC,contigencies?   Are you sure you are using the correct term? Zen is not predicated on contingent existence because KENSHO is seeing the unconditioned.

zen,3cx84k,mujushingyo,0,Sat Jul 11 21:26:28 2015 UTC,"AgelessBodhi has; probably songhill also. But in Zen of course we strike right to the Source, to Mind itself -- to the Dharma-Body which has no arising or ceasing in it, and defies all intellectual predication or conceptual organization. So in that Zen sense the taste of an onion (though not considered in a dull empirical way) is as thrilling, poignant, and ultimately enlightening as any of the arupa-jhanas.  I was once doing mokuso Seiza-sitting meditation & attained the eighth jhana. When I came out of it, though it seemed to me only a few seconds later, it turned out I had been sitting that way for about four hours, and as a result of this I sustained a painful bone-bruise on one of my feet that left me crippled for almost a month.   From the Zen POV, Lin-Chi's for example, in that instance I got exactly what I deserved."

If one knows how to return to the Truth, he will not wander outside in search of sense data. The sense organs become disengaged from externals at that point, and if any one of them can be returned to Pure Mind, then the functions of all six sense organs will stop; and Mind will remain clear and pure like an extremely bright mirror. If one can hold this Mind, he will be delivered from the deep pit. Such is the view from one side of voidness; but one still needs to take one more step, and then , in all ten directions, all will manifest. Mountains, rivers and all other things are suddenly recognized clearly as the substance of Dharma."

zen,3cx84k,ewk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:44:11 2015 UTC,"One pointed concentration, for example on the ""head word"" or Hua T'ou. Like what Mumon Ekai describes in case 1 of the Mumonkan. It is worth noting that Zen history is full of artificial methods for shattering the ordinary discriminating consciousness and attaining the natural clear state. Mumon Ekai meditated day and night for six years on the head word, ""Mu."" Toward the end, each time he started to doze off in the zendo he would go out into the hall and bash his head on a pillar to stay awake.  Zen has often been criticized for being self-contradictory in the sense that it uses artificial expedients to induce the satori that instantly returns the mind to its True Nature. But the reason I quoted this is to underline the point that in Zen there is a step beyond one-sided ""voidness."" Buddhist theory is not enough."

Just to be clear, the only claim I am willing to endorse right now is that applying either of the words ""secular"" or ""religious"" to Zen in any of their possible permutations (such as Zen is religious but not secular or vice versa) has no footing in the body of Zen literature, primary or secondary, to date and is instead an arbitrary conceptual division that has been imposed externally by a select contingent of modern Westerners projecting their own beliefs uncritically back in time. This can be evidenced by the fact that no Zen master (to my knowledge) ever even uttered the words secular or religious, let alone apply it to Zen so as to neatly and conclusively define and contain it. Simply put, I don't think they came down on the matter either way, knowing the inherent foolishness of pitting necessarily-arbitrary value systems against each other.

Have you read something at all about how buddhists define faith? It's a rather complicated point for a person who grew up in a western christianity based society. So far all you had to offer is complaining about people who maliciously connect your beloved noble Zen to despicable faith-based Buddhism. I don't understand what's the problem? Sure there are a lot of differences between various schools but it's completely in line of the original teachings. And I really liked the OP's Shinzen Young's article.

Not just the total newbies and passerbys deciding to poke their heads in for a bit (which being hosted on a major social media platform such as reddit, a community like /r/zen is especially likely to attract).  All this post shows is that ewk is good with the kids... Nobody's disputing that. What about the actual scholars, who ewk purports to be sincerely interested in engaging with? Like /u/grass_skirt. Why doesn't he really post here anymore? Do you think he ran out of relevant stuff to share?   Look, I have no problem with dilettantism. Reddit is a monument to dilettantism, so I recognize how inseparable it is from the discussion format. But I do have a problem with hypocrisy and rhetorical trickery and dishonesty. When ewk promotes his particular brand of dilettantism under the guise of rigorous scholarly discussion, that just cheapens and counterfeits the entire enterprise for all but the tourists and passerbys who don't have the volition to actively engage, versus passively receive, or otherwise get to examine in detail exactly what ewk's positions would imply and how fundamentalist and anti-scholastic they really are.  Likewise,  if ewk actually gave a shit about scholarly discourse, he wouldn't be so coy in admitting just how controversial and fringe his opinions actually are. And I'm not saying fringe in an attempt to be derogatory or demeaning, I mean it in a quantitative, empirical, statistical sense, from the perspective of the academic community. Ewk's way of getting around this is by claiming vast, insidious conspiracy, which I think is ridiculous considering the face he displays and attitudes he passes off.   Once you start tallying the votes of people who've been here for a bit, I think you'll start to see a pretty decent skew in the direction of ewk being perceived as a net-negative influence in a statistically significant way (not that I'd ever bother to measure it lol)"

Even then, all of my questions were from books, but I eventually realized that the questions that get answered come from within, come from personal experience.  I was not really a ""Buddhist"" for another 10 years, after a long stay at a Monastery and an emotionally overwhelming Jukai.  Everyone reads koans. Usually a question is asked and answered. Often the answer seems absurd but the questioner is suddenly enlightened. Why? In my little niche of Buddhism it is explained with: the Master discerned the underlying question, the real heart of the matter, and answered that directly.  So, anyway...if your questions come from delusion (as most verbalized questions do) they may be answered honestly, dishonestly or not at all. It really doesn't matter because your question doesn't matter. Hopefully, someday, you will ask a question that comes from within, a ""hair on fire"" question (as Dogen would say) and either the answer will come from within or someone else will answer directly.  This is what Compassion means in Mahayana Buddhism. But that's an even longer discussion. My advice to everyone who's read too much and experience too little is: get your ass on a mat and look at a wall."

There is a sort of truism in life that might be summed up thusly. Growth doesn't occur in a comfort zone. Now see, making a claim like that here on /r/Zen will get me downvoted, or argued with etc. Mostly because in the Zen sense (terms of the absolute) all things are ultimately fictitious. There is no such thing as growth, no ideas of comfort etc. And so forth.  So here when you make any mention towards relativity (concepts of compassion, growth, change and most importantly understanding) you will get shut down. In as you've noticed a rather harsh way.  Which brings me back to growth and comfort zones. All the would be zennests who come here find no talk of enlightenment and no compassion. Just what seems to be an egotistical batlefield. So if you stick around you might pick up something. You might even let go of something. Probably not. It's an uncomfortable place but growth never occurs when someone is comfortable."

zen,3cqw9h,dota2nub,11,Sat Jul 11 06:08:34 2015 UTC,"Zen masters don't teach being humble, or humility. They don't teach ""going further on your way to enlightenment"". They do not give advice and do not offer peace. They are not tolerant and they are very aggressive. They do not help people and they do not consider years of meditation to be worth anything.  They do talk about wisdom and compassion, but wisdom in Zen is ""absence of wrong belief"" (quoted free from my memory, which is full of holes), and compassion is ""not conceiving of sentient beings as to be delivered""(I'm sure about this one)   They do answer questions all the time though, but lots of people around here aren't interested in what the Zen masters taught, they just like the name Zen and want it to advertise whatever religion they feel like selling."

zen,3cqw9h,dota2nub,2,Fri Jul 10 09:24:40 2015 UTC,Which zen masters taught about compassion and wisdom?
zen,3cqw9h,STICKballWIZARD,2,Fri Jul 10 09:25:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it was Huangbo who said these things.
zen,3cqw9h,dota2nub,2,Fri Jul 10 10:29:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, I'll have to read it again then, could you give a few quotes maybe? It may jog my memory. It was a genuine question, I'm not trying to be nob."
zen,3cqw9h,STICKballWIZARD,3,Fri Jul 10 10:34:10 2015 UTC,"It should be somewhere in the Transmission of the Mind. My memory is leaky though, as I said. Let me look it up because I'm wondering myself right now. I'm not sure I underlined the exact passage. Let's see what I can find:    ""The ignorant eschew phenomena but not thought; the wise eschew thought but not phenomena""    Aah, there we go, page 84:     ""Q: How do the Buddhas, out of their vast mercy and compassion, preach the Dharma (Law) to sentient beings? A: We speak of their mercy and compassion as vast just because it is beyond causality. (and therefore infinite). By mercy is really meant not conveiving of a Buddha to be enlightened, while compassion really means not conceiving of sentient beings to be delivered.  In reality, their Dharma is neither preached in words nor otherwise signified; and those who listen neither hear nor attain. It is as though an imaginary teacher had preached to imaginary people. As regards all these dharmas (teachings), if, for the sake of the Way, I speak to you from my deeper knowledge and lead you forward, you will certainly be able to understand what I say; and, as to mercy and compassion, if for your sakes I take to thinking things out and studying other people's concepts - in neither case will you have reached a true perception of the real nature of your own Mind from WITHIN YOURSELVES. So, in the end, these things will be of no help at all.""     that's the part I was thinking of. Looks like I misquoted and changed the meaning a bit. Sorry about that. I'd say his version is a bit more radical than mine even. Now for wisdom. There's this passage on page 98:     ""31. Another day, our Master was seated in the tea-room when Nan Ch'üan came down and asked him: 'What is meant by ""A clear insight into the Buddha-Nature results from the study of dhyâna [I got the accent wrong] (mind control) and prajñâ (wisdom)""?'  Our Master replied: 'It means that, from morning till night, we should never rely on a single thing.'  'But isn't that just Your Reverence's own conception of its meaning? 'How could I be so presumptuous?'  ...  ""    Let's see if I can find it. I'm not really sure it was Huangbo who said this phrase I have in mind... I can't find it. He speaks of wisdom some of the time, but only in the sense that it means not getting attached to something and speaking from a place of dispassion. Maybe it was another Zen Master I think of. I'm a bit confused. In any case, wisdom isn't a thing you have, it's the absence of those things, and good advice is not wisdom - more like the opposite.  Can someone else clear this up?"
zen,3cqw9h,IOnlyCareAboutIrony,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:53:29 2015 UTC,"""The ignorant eschew phenomena but not though; the wise eschew thought but not phenomena""   I've heard that before but worded differently, I think it went like this: ""Fools believe what they think, not what they see. Wise men believe what they see, not what they think.""  I will have to reread Transmission of the Mind again. How does the compassion of Zen masters differ from Buddhist and Christian religious figures? Is it how sentient beings are perfectly fine as they are? Whereas in religious circles such as Christisnity the concept of original sin pervades all their teachings?"

""Do not conceive of sentient beings to be delivered"" - you can parse that sentence in two ways. - Either you don't conceive of sentient beings to begin with, so there's nobody who needs to be saved, or you don't conceive of the beings ""as to be delivered"" like I misquoted before, so if you do conceive of them, they do not need to be helped in any way.  Another Zen Master said something about how an enlightened person needs to be able to take a hungry man's food away. Can't remember where that's from though. It was discussed in some forum post here maybe a year ago?"
zen,3cqw9h,jualpa,2,Fri Jul 10 12:30:37 2015 UTC,"How can you not conceive sentient beings? How is that compassionate? Also, why would an enlightened person need to be able to take a hungry persons food?"

Nothing's there. Don't look. You can't look. Who's you. Look? Blank slate. Now you can start seeing other people. That's compassionate.

zen,3cqw9h,Truthier,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"When you walk, do you conceive of walking? And it's Huangbo's definition of the word compassion, not mine. The way Christians and Buddhists teach it, it means something else, like helping poor people who you think are beneath you on some chosen system of value in some way your value system considers to be helpful.  I was using the metaphor of taking a hungry man's food to illustrate exactly this point. Compassion in Zen has a different meaning to it than anywhere else. Christians give hungry people food, Zen Masters take it away. Christianity gives people hope, Zen takes it away."

When I see other people I recognize them as similar to myself, with a similar way of looking at things. If you can't conceive of sentient beings then how do you even differentiate between a rock and a frog? You may as well sit in front of a wall and do nothing.  If I see a homeless person begging for change I don't see them as beneath me, I see a homeless person begging for change, and if I have some change I'll share it out. Would you not do this?

I think it's better to act in accordance with your own truth instead of something you think is all spiritual and good. That way you get to see the hidden assumptions and thought patterns that would otherwise remain obscured, and you can examine them clearly.

People to hide their true nature? On a zen forum? People are people, some of them try to project an ""aura of enlightenment"" for the sake of some new age spiritual mumbo jumbo hippie zeitgeist, and they are kinda sorta welcome here too. But they get talked down to. Teenagers act the same way, and they get talked down to as well.   try to make sense   And what are you going to get out of this sense? I see Sisyphus, trying to roll the boulder of sense up a hill. But things just don't make sense, so the boulder keeps rolling down the hill.   the first things I worked on were humility and compassion   This is one of the most passive-aggressive comments I've heard on /r/zen. I haven't been here a long time, but in general people are much more direct. What you are doing is extraordinarily rude.   I thought I would find ...   And when you didn't you started complaining like a little baby. Cry me a river. Now you're being passive-aggressive and immature.   peace   Good grief Charlie Brown. If peace is what you want, go to a monastery or out in the woods. There are plenty of peaceful places on planet earth, WHY DON'T YOU GO THERE?!?!?!   I see a lot of ego, intolerance, agressivity and paranoia   Why do you have a problem with people doing things that people do? What did you expect? People don't act the way you want them to act! Amazing! Why don't you write a book about it? Or do what the psychologists do, start making up big words to describe the people you don't like?   Share your experiences with humility   You come to a forum with a bunch of strangers, you don't like how they act, you act passive-aggressive and immature, and you start telling them what to do. What are you, twelve? Because this is pretty much how twelve-year-olds act.   you're no better than them or anybody, and if you think you are, then your years of meditation aren't worth much   You clearly think you are better than the people who post in /r/zen and you want them to know this.

Joshu is bringing it right at you- no bull, no woo-woo, no filter, no inspiration.  So whenever a monk shows up to solicit Joshu in a karma debate, or a buddha circlejerk - he's typically going to say ""No buddha. No karma. No thanks. Fuck off.""   Joshu's main zen thesis is ""Fuck off"", which is just a meaner way of rephrasing Boddhidharma's ""Move along."""

I mean, we can argue about what ""special"" means but this analogy really doesn't hold water to me. He's arguably the best basketball player alive. What are we calling special here? I think we're splitting hairs.  What's the difference between ""emphasis"" and ""special emphasis?""   If someone told me on the street:   That's much different than the situation in the post. The monk asked Joshu a question. He was seeking something from Joshu.  Joshu gave it to him. Even if he had chosen not to speak, he would have been doing something.  If there was truly nothing offered here, we wouldn't be having this conversation about the event so many years later, right?"
zen,3croqb,singlefinger,0,Fri Jul 10 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"Alright you make a good point, I am being vague about 'special'. Special emphasis , as defined for me, is reverence, worship, and adulation. There is only one person that gets special emphasis from me and that's the Boss' kid -Jesus.  You're right the street example was clumsy. Different situation.   Joshu gave it to him. Even if he had chosen not to speak, he would have been doing something   This is splitting hairs again, and I don't mind, but I disagree. The monk soliciting advice from Joshu and Joshu being reticent about it and then saying the monk got something would be like a panhandler going up to you and asking for change and you pull into your pocket and hand the bum over some lint. Yes, we know the vagrant got something, but he got nothing."

You can stare at those and they just keep changing.  If you ask somebody for the meaning of life and they hand you one of those answers, you can climb into the rabbithole and see where you end up.

If you do, then aren't you turning away from the path, rather than entering it?   Ok, I'm going to be a Stoic with this one: Is complaining actually doing anything? That is, is ""setting it right"" within your control, and complaining just a way to achieve that?  If it is in your control, do the right thing, which is justice. If it is not in your control, why are you wasting thought on it in the first place.  Note that what you quoted says:   Now, though I do no wrong, I’m punished by my past.    So another thing that you should be asking now  is ""How did I go from 'accept punishment for past injustice committed by me' to 'It would be a good idea to complain about that!'?""  The past is not something under your control. No amount of complaining will change it, and no amount of complaining will change what justice is or your duty to serve it (because nature), so why are you even wasting thought on those matters. Now you could say ""I need to learn from this"" and you'd be right, you probably should. But as a Buddha/Sage, you're now doing (by definition) nothing wrong at all, so you don't need to learn.

Further reflection on the obvious nature of the easy target. Also the reason this is the Meta, Meta post.  Finally we arrive at /u/newkleuz He assures me I was posting bait, and that I mixed up a saying. ""The wise man laughs, and the fool listens."" Then he goes on to explain to me how I messed up. As he states,    Fools go around trying to be like other people, trying to like the things other people like. It's pathetic. They're filled with self-hatred and think they deserve better. So they listen to whatever nostrum they happen to hear.  Wise men, on the other hand, know they are fools. So when they hear the way, they think, ""oh man, how mixed up I would be if I tried to do what he's talking about? xD""   He tells us quite honestly what makes a man a fool, and what separates the wise from the fools. Everyone is a fool, but the wise know they are fools.  However like Admiral Akbar he realized the trap too late and blew himself up. For if a wise man knows he is a fool, then he'd be a fool to think himself wise. Where then is the difference between the wise man and the fool? Both laugh and both listen. Perhaps then it lies in the things they laugh at, and the things they listen to. Yet if every way is the way, or if the way is no way at all, then what did it matter what they laughed at or listened too?  /u/clickstation gives us a valuable lesson in the absurd.  /u/pupilaskquestionnow said ""Who cares?"" I imagine him like Diogenes, searching with his lantern for the man who cares. Some say he still searches to this day.  29,930 members reflected their true Zen nature and remained silent on the matter.  You wanted to know the point. This is the point. one day has passed in which we've gotten twenty replies, we all became a little wiser, and all you wise men get to revel in your foolishness. Thank you all for humoring me."

KYOGEN'S MAN HANGING IN THE TREE  Kyogen said, ""It (Zen) is like a man (monk) hanging by his teeth in a tree over a precipice. His hands grasp no branch, his feet rest on no limb, and under the tree another man asks him, 'Why did Bodhidharma come to China from the West (India)?' If the man in the tree does not answer, he misses the question, and if he answers, he falls and loses his life. Now what shall he do?""  Mumon's Comment: (In such a predicament) though your eloquence flows like a river, it is all to no avail. Even if you can explain all of the Buddhist sutras, that also is useless. If you can rightly answer the question, you walk the road of killing the living and reviving the dead. But if you cannot answer, you should wait for ages and ask Maitreya, the future Buddha.  Kyogen had really bad taste,  And spreads the poison everywhere,  He stuffs with it the monks' mouths,   And lets their tears stream from their dead eyes.  Theres another kinda cool story that can be read just for interest.   shri rama krishna and one of his diciples  All the multiplicity of this world is the illusary outward form of the one eternal devine brahman (read buddha nature) underlying the entire process. And having sat and listened to this exposition the deciple got up and and went his way and passing down a rather narrow street he saw an elephant coming towards him and a mahoot riding the elephant. well the mahoot saw the deciple wandering down the center of the road and shouted at him ""hey you get out of the way this elephant isnt very nice!"".   But the deciple thought now the master rama krishna has told me that i am brahman and everything brahman and therfor the elephant is brahman and therfor it will be perfectly alright if i walk streaight along the elephant will do me no harm since i know this to be true. so he ignored the warning of the mahoot and approached the elephant and the elephant swung his trunk and swatted the deciple hard and threw him into the ditch where he was scratched with the brambles.   well he was very upset and he came crawling back to shri rama krishna and said master you have decieved me. i understood that everything is brahman that i am brahman and all other creatures is that not so master. and the master said yes it is so. well he said i was walking out in the road and i saw this elephant coming towards me. and it didnt seem to me to be necessary to get out of the way when the mahoot riding the elephant warned me to do so, because I figured that i was brahman and the elephant was brahman and i could come to no harm. you stupid man said shri rama krishna you didnt realise that the voice of the mahoot was also brahman and you should have headed that too.   So also in this case, the one who is trying to regain the vision is the deciple and the vision they are trying to regain is the elephant. But the way you are actually feeling now and which you are ignoring because of your egonist to feel some other way that is the voice of the mahoot, and that too is brahman."

The interesting question is whether Dogen knew it was a forgery when he picked it to base his religion on.  If Dogen had studied any Zen at all (as those who claim he copied the BCR say he did) then he would have known that the manual he chose to plagiarize for his church's bible was a forgery.
zen,3coyus,love0_-all,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:50:50 2015 UTC,Maybe he was prematurely approved. All the rest of what you say seems pretty contradictory to everything.  What do you think about what went down between Dogen and Nonin and the Daruma-Shu?
zen,3coyus,ewk,0,Thu Jul 9 22:25:07 2015 UTC,"There isn't any evidence that anybody approved Dogen, ever.  I don't know what went on between Dogen and anybody.  Obviously Dogen's account is useless in that regard.  It's a fact that Dogen plagiarized a Buddhist meditation manual when he ""wrote"" FukanZazenGi.  It's a fact that the manual Dogen plagiarized was, itself, a forgery, falsely attributed to Baizhang.  It's a fact that Dogen is said to have (sloppily) copied the BCR.  Now, I say that anybody that reads FukanZazenGi can tell that it is completely unrelated to BCR.  Whatever else anybody says about Dogen, he wasn't stupid.  So obviously either he didn't study Zen or he knew the manual he plagiarized was likely a forgery.  You say that something ""seems"" contradictory in that line of reasoning, but what, specifically?  Or are you shocked that a church founder might mislead people?  Given that Dogen is one of the few people to found a church by himself, along with L. Ron Hubbard and Joseph Smith, it seems baffling that you would argue that Dogen was uniquely honest in that group."

After he admitted it was his blog I linked this discussion:  http://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=69&t=8713&start=20  You will notice he changed his username by a single letter but on the earlier page and elsewhere it links to the exact same blog he admitted was his. There is no indication it was satire, in fact there is indication to the contrary as he instead presents rationalizations as to why he charges people.  There are plenty of other small inconsistencies regarding his stance on the matter and not to mention the increasingly vitriolic and paranoid statements he launches at me and others during this humorous struggle (on reddit, not on the dharmawheel discussion; in fact the dharmawheel discussion gives insight into a mumu several years ago, where he seems less bitter and paranoid, albeit still a bit confrontational), but all of that is neither here nor there.

Why would you assume I am interested in the fact that you have since altered the blogpage for whatever reason? For example potentially editing it right before you made the revisionist post a few days ago saying the whole thing was satire (which again, occurred after you denied even having a page claiming you charged money at all, and so forth).

Sure, it could have been /r/chan/, but it wasn't. So we're here.   Anybody, at any time, could leave this place and start up a new zen/chan-related community.   But why would they? To avoid drama?  Sure. You can go start up a community by yourself. Set it to private with you as the only moderator. Oh, and while you're at it, just don't post.   Bam. No drama. Winner.   The second you actually start to do something though, even by yourself, well... let's just say that no mind is free of drama.  If you want dharma, you get drama. No way to avoid it. You think sitting in the forest until you die won't get you drama?   Try telling yourself ""Ok, we're gonna go die in the forest now.""  See what happens.  To suggest that people here are all insincere is kind of nuts to me. Lots of people here, as far as I can tell anyway, are really trying to study, do well, learn, whatever-something-good.

zen,3ckyoa,Temicco,2,Wed Jul 8 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the other posts have made the irony here clear, so I'll go straight to my point. I am willing to move to /r/Chan.  Communities which are more toxic and dramatic tend to have a few well-educated personalities, because only people who know their shit can get through the ""litmus test"" of the sub. Here it's usually the Mumonkan. However, this isn't ideal to newcomers. Either they'll just mimic the louder people, and be pseudo-smart, or they'll honestly try to learn-- an unnecessarily tough process, given the adversarial atmosphere-- or they'll simply not frequent the sub, in favour of some other place.  Less toxic communities tend to be more amenable to the questions and repeated confusions of new members. They'll take a kind of lying-to-children approach. This can give such people a false sense of ""getting it"", not too unlike the first group of people I mentioned from the more toxic subs, but I find that in these circumstances they can be more easily persuaded (if it's done reasonably) that their views are, in fact, wrong/oversimplified/already addressed. Then there's the people who are educated, and can give very detailed answers. Then there's the people who frequent the more toxic subs.  Due to the more neurotic nature of this sub, the content is inextricable from the personalities who post it, and as such can become untasteful.  I don't think your rant is unreasonable. I'm interested in studying Ch'an, and I feel that this sub has made me feel like I desperately need to prove myself (kind of a mix of the first and second groups). I think it might be nice to spend some time in a more relaxed sub (/r/Chan), and actually figure shit out peacefully, even if it takes some time. This sub is known for its toxicity, a fact not recognized by people who spend most of their time there (""not smelling shit because you're always around it"" kind of thing). So yeah, I'm willing to make the move, and see what happens of it. Even if it starts out kind of dead, maybe it will gradually attract more people. It's worth a shot, though."

If you don’t see your nature, invoking Buddhas, reciting sutras, making offerings, and keeping precepts are all useless. Invoking Buddhas results in good karma, reciting sutras results in a good memory; keeping precepts results in a good rebirth, and making offerings results in future blessings-but no buddha.   -Bodhidharma  Bodhidharma isn't teaching people how to get a good rebirth, but how to find a Buddha  He goes on to say:   Unless you see your nature, all this talk about cause and effect is nonsense. Buddhas don’t practice nonsense. A Buddha free of karma, free of cause and effect. To say he attains anything at all is to slander a Buddha. What could he possibly attain? Even focusing on a mind, a power, an understanding, or a view is impossible for a Buddha. A Buddha isn’t one sided. The nature of his mind is basically empty, neither pure nor impure.

This is all nothing more than a restatement of the third noble truth of nirodha, or cessation of suffering.    The Buddha taught that dharma teachings are like a raft - use them to cross the stream but don't strap the raft to your back and walk around with it when you reach the other side.  Same with the teaching of karma, he didn't expound this to develop a rigorous philosophical discipline or win a debate, it was to present a framework for liberation from suffering.

It is merely a word for describing this part of reality. If you cling to it as a ""Buddhist"" or ""Not zen""-Term you narrow your view on it and you won't understand it.  However, most often it is (mis-) used as something spiritual or esotheric. This is not necessarely wrong but might make it harder to grasp.   It is often used in opposite to Dharma which means ""law"" or ""truth"". So, if people speak about Karma, they mostly refere to some action which are not Dharma (not bodhi). In particular many people speak of ""good"" and ""bad"" karma. However, ""good"" and ""bad"" is just thinking and not an observation. It is something made up by thinking and is empty.  And don't forget: ""good"" or ""bad"" (karma) is just thinking. In our school, we call it checking. Instead of experiencing reality, you are checking it. This is a wide spread (Zen-) illness"

zen,3chgwv,pointingatthebye,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:20:39 2015 UTC,"Don't know didn't read lame of thrones   Yet neither individual characteristics nor social conditions kill people. “Youth” does not pull a trigger nor anomie strangle a victim. Murder is an action. And, in fact, the vast majority of people whom our models identify as at risk of committing homicide never resort to it. That is, aggregate level theories cannot explain why particular people kill, how their victims are selected, or what drives them to murder in the first place. Our aggregate approach sees motive and murder as almost random instantiations of demographic and social conditions that we call risk factors. In such a view, individuals muddle through a sort of Hobbesian chaos, albeit in particular types of places and under certain circumstances. As a result, there is little rhyme or reason to who kills whom.    ...   I argue that gang murder is best understood not by searching for its individual determinants but by examining the social networks of action and reaction that create it. Gang members do not kill because they are poor, Black, young, or live in a socially disadvantaged neighborhood. They kill because they live in a structured set of social relations in which violence works its way through a series of connected individuals."

When Xuefeng went to Touzi three times and Dongshan nine times, do you suppose he did it for the sake of words?  You should simply step back and study through total experience. How do you step back? I am not telling you to sit on a bench with your eyes closed, rigidly suppressing body and mind, like earth or wood. That will never have any usefulness, even in a million years.   When you want to step back, if there are any sayings or stories you don’t understand, place them in front of you, step back and see for yourself why you don’t understand. Professional monks say, “Thinking will not do; not thinking will not do either.” Then how do they teach people to contemplate?  I tell you, just step back and look.   Phew! Sure gives people trouble! Sure is hard to understand! But look here— what is it that troubles people? Who is it that troubles anyone? Step back and look in this way; gradually you will wake up, through each passing day illumination will expand and enlarge."

zen,3cfnq3,Truthier,2,Tue Jul 7 15:43:56 2015 UTC,"A gong an is a story of an incident between a master and one or more disciples that involves an understanding or experience of the enlightened mind. The incident usually, but not always, involves dialogue. When the incident is remembered and recorded, it becomes a ""public case,"" which is the literal meaning of the term. Often what makes the incident worth recording is that, as the result of the interchange, a disciple had an awakening, an experience of enlightenment.  Master Zhaozhou was asked by a monk, ""Does a dog have Buddha-nature?"" The master replied, ""Wu,"" meaning nothing. This is a basic gong an, possibly the most famous on record. Here is another gong an, also involving Zhaozhou. Zhaozhou had a disciple who met an old woman and asked her, ""how do I get to Mt. Tai?"" She said, ""Just keep going!"" As the monk started off, he heard the old woman remark, ""He really went!"" Afterward, the disciple mentioned this to Zhaozhou, who said, ""I think I will go over there and see for myself"" When he met the old woman, Zhaozhou asked the same question and she gave the same response: ""Just keep going!"" As Zhaozhou started off he heard the old lady said as she had last time, ""He really went!"" When Zhaozhou returned, he said to the assembly, ""I have seen through that old woman!"" What did Zhaozhou find out about that old woman? What is the meaning of this lengthy and obscure gong an?  Around the time of the Song dynasty (960-1276), Ch'an masters began using recorded gong ans as a subject of meditation for their disciples. The practitioner was required to investigate the meaning of the historical gong an. To penetrate the meaning of the gong an, the student has to abandon knowledge, experience, and reasoning, since the answer is not accessible by these methods. The student must find the answer by can (pronounced: tsan) gong an, or ""investigating the gong an."" This requires sweeping from consciousness everything but the gong an, eventually generating the ""doubt sensation,"" which is a strong sensation of wonder and an intense desire to know the meaning of the gong an.  .....

When your brain freezes a fog goes away and then you see the world more clearly. Seeing clearly is a good thing.

zen,3cfnq3,bucon,5,Tue Jul 7 18:08:00 2015 UTC,Both these sort-of-koans help to illustrate where koans are coming from. Every important koan is based on Buddha Mind which is far more subtle than the sound of one hand or moving a mountain.
zen,3cfnq3,songhill,-9,Tue Jul 7 18:18:37 2015 UTC,One hand clapping isn't a koan.   It's a meditative prayer from the Dogen Buddhist church designed to confuse the mind into a state of subdued pacivity.

zen,3cfpiq,mujushingyo,7,Tue Jul 7 16:10:11 2015 UTC,"The Mumonkan is a collection of kung-ans to be used in Ch'an monasteries. The Master gives a student a kung-an selected from this or some other collection, and the student works on finding the answer to it 24/7, even in his sleep. Each time he goes to the Master for a private interview, he gives his most recent understanding, and the Master replies: ""That's not it."" Soon the kung-an takes over the student's whole life, stopping all his random thinking. By this means he learns to concentrate all his energy on one point with desperation and total resolve. Eventually there is a breakthrough; the student wakes up and understands the kung-an completely, from inside out. He demonstrates this understanding in some way to the Master, who approves this new, fresh and uncontrived understanding. If the breakthrough is total enough, it is the upheaval of the students' whole being and is recognized as wu, satori. Such is the true study of kung-an. The Mumonkan is a resource handbook for this study. It has no use outside of the situation I have described. You cannot just leaf through it and try to understand the cases on your own. You need a strict Master and rigorous training."

Or perhaps ""the truth can't be transmitted via words, so nothing I say would help him anyway; I'd do better to hold on.""  An either-or situation presented like this is a logic trap.    ""The great way is not difficult; it simply avoids choosing.""  To be clear, it avoids judging actions and circumstances in the scope of ""better"" and ""worse.""  The person of Zen is free of such distinctions; he (or she) has no need to let his thoughts and actions be bound by previously acquired knowledge or relativistic morality; he is perfectly free to respond to this situation in any way he sees fit.   It is a freedom every person has, but many close themselves off from it under the delusion that one way is ""better"" than the other.  Most of us are mentally trained to solve problems, and here is a presented problem that seems like it must have a solution. But there is no choice to make between answering and falling; you either freely fall, or you freely hang.

If not, what day would be best?    Have you looked to see if the center has a website? The relevant information for that specific center is probably on its website.  Lots of places offer induction courses, which is a good entry point for participating with the community.     Will they accept anyone to join?  By join, I mean to join in a group meditation.  Or do you have to know somebody to join?    Everyone is welcome.    Do they expect some form of trade for their teaching, like to volunteer or to donate money?    Depends on the place. Regardless, if you appreciate the center existing and providing an opportunity to practice with others, consider making a donation of some sort. The money for rent, electricity, and heat comes from donations.     Is there anything I should not say or should say if I walked into one of these?    You don't need to say much.

If it looks like laypeople are gathering there on sundays for some sort of group practice then go check it out, find someone going in and ask them about it. If you know the name of the place you can google it and maybe find a schedule or contact information.  I would assume they accept anyone to join as long as they are respectful. I would be suspicious if they don't.  traditionally monasteries have depended largely on support from the lay community. That doesn't mean you have to pay for going to a few group meditations. Donate as you feel compelled to do so. If you have nothing you can give them, that's perfectly okay. They will gladly accept anything you offer.  Just be respectful. Often times loud noises are frowned upon. Often times they take their shoes off before going inside. Ask them any questions you have and they should be glad to answer."

(inside joke)  In all seriousness....   Concepts like ""enlightenment"" or ""arresting thought"" are symbols used to describe an idea.  So is ""emptiness"" which is likely what the various versions of ""detachment"" necessarily involve.  as /u/kaleidon pointed out, using these ideas in the wrong ways leads to the wrong results.   https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/3cbvqy/ewk_and_the_bodhidharma_on_detachment/csu4b41  The heart sutra describes the nature of emptiness and clarifies this matter quite interestingly, describing the nature of emptiness and its intrinsic relationship with non-emptiness. When one understands this dharma (itself also empty), one understands  why we say that that which has form is empty, and that that which is empty has a form.   ""Emptiness"" (voidness) and ""non-emptiness"" (suchness) are both ""empty"", if one understands what this is getting at, one can perhaps graduate to another level, (ideally, eventually the one which realizes that all levels are artificial to begin with)  (People have toiled over these philosophical ideas thousands of years ago, it's worth briefly reviewing their conclusions)  It is perhaps worth considering the following question:  When one says detachment, what it is it that is being detached from, precisely, and what remains?"
zen,3cbvqy,Truthier,7,Mon Jul 6 22:36:12 2015 UTC,"Part of the answer has to do with the ongoing conversation about translation.  Some people complain when I translate what is literally ""Buddha Dharma""  in the text into ""Zen Dharma"" when older translations translate it as ""Buddhism"".   Meaning comes  from context and translations involve travel across contexts.  So what does Bodhidharma mean?   Negation of appearances isn't blindness.  It isn't sitting quietly for however long it takes to pacify the mind.   In the same way,  cutting off thinking isn't ""not thinking"".   The other part is that Buddhahood means awarenes explains what is meant by ""detachment"".   Huangbo says don't separate from your daily life and don'tbecome entangled in it.  Same same."

Also Buddhism changed many times in China,  so if one is not familiar with the 3000 year history of Buddhist thought and its changes,  one cannot appreciate which parts originated in India and which parts originated in China.  The clue to modern faith based Buddhists is that they don't really care to understand any of this,  but still insist on saying that zen is buddhist,  which,  by the way,  it is not,  unless you go to a form of Buddhism that did not exist until the Song dynasty,  zen buddhism,  and claim that is zen.    Zen had existed apart from this in China for maybe 600 years before there was a kind of buddhism that tried to canibalize zen and make it part of Buddhism.   Most of what has been called zen since the end of the Song dynasty was really a form of buddhism.    So look back to the zen characters of China before 1300 CE,  if you want to learn to tell the difference.     Zen is not a religion,  a dogma,  a practice,  a philosophy,  a belief or a faith.     Listen to what Mazu,  Joshu,  Fayan,  etc.  said about it."

I don't claim any special understanding or authority.  For example, just the other day I was reading the 2nd Patriarch's poem and it is silly how short it is and how people who claim to represent him don't ever bother to actually read his work or instead claim that they have the equivalent of a ""secret decoder ring"".  If you're interested we could post up sections of the poem each day for discussion and such and see who can handle the fang & claw of this lineage."

I agree that they do reject such things, but things don't have anything to do with Zen as far as I can see. They are pointers and all pointers are appropriate to context (again as far as I can see).  In that sense it makes no difference what is posted, as all points to mind.   In another sense there is very little that serves as a better pointer than that poem. Each section is worthwhile. Together they are a powerful mover. It's true I haven't read it in some time."

I asked a Wikipedia-famous Buddhist monk once, ""in the chant books, it says 'the blessed one'. Who or what is blessing the Buddha?"" I'm not sure he understood the question. He said, ""blissed, he's happy."" Maybe he misheard me.  But if he did understand the question, then are we supposed to bow down to an 8 foot golden statue of the Buddha just because he's happy?  areyoufuckingkiddingme.jpg  Claims of supernatural / mystical ""liberation"" or ""enlightenment"" are based on stories. It's storytelling. Enlightenment and liberation are fictional constructions, bait designed to ensnare the gullible, to get them to confuse a fictional world with the real world. And it sure is an ego trip for the teacher to get others hooked on stories.   You see, when people can't agree on what something is, when they all go around saying, ""I know what it is, listen to me!"" it's just people getting caught up in their own imagination. These teachers run around saying, ""I know what enlightenment is, listen to me!"" or ""I know what liberation is, listen to me!"" If it were real, something that could be studied, then all of these teachers would get together and ask, ""well, what is it?"" They would want to know what enlightenment is. But these teachers don't want to do that, they just want other people to think they're enlightened or liberated. It's an ego trip, and it has nothing to do with reality or truth.

I'm saying all of this ""liberation"" talk is distraction from the real work that is going to give people the tools they need to get their act together. And that is liberating. There is a big difference between the noun ""liberation"" and the gerund ""liberating"". Liberation is something to chase after, and liberating is a way to be, but it isn't something you get, it's something that happens by itself as you develop the habits of mind that allow you to keep your mental house in order.

zen,3c6awk,ewk,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:40:29 2015 UTC,It isn't.   I know. But it is superficially associated. You make your life very hard by applying hard rules to a message board which promotes posting stuff like this. Why not practice more what you think is right?

What if there was some small concise book that succinctly contains the basic concepts, and that explains them in straightforward language instead of allusions, metaphor and Kongans?  What if this book, once read and understood, could let you understand any of the Zen texts fairly easily, since that book forms the basis of knowledge - the basic grammar of philosophy upon which al of the other writings are built?  Fortunately there are such books, you should find a copy of the diamond sutra with commentary and it will help you understand virtually any  other book. I don't know of the best one - I can't see he book previews on Amazon on my phone. Avoid red pine's but his are still good enough to start with."

It can only point you to the cave and the wall imprinted with Bodhidharma's shadow. You have to then sit down, face that wall, drop thinking, & look intensely into the essence of your own body & mind until you realize It instantaneously, like someone drinking water & knowing for himself beyond a doubt if it is cold or hot.  Suppose you said you were thinking of going to Paris this summer but first must buy & study all the best guide-books to Paris so you can take a lot of notes in the margins about what you want to experience once you've arrived. You feel you can't go until you've read every guide-book ever published & thoughtfully compared what they say about the city. In the end, you will likely not go to Paris this summer at all, maybe next summer if you can do all the homework by then, but will just spend your time agonizing about what you should do & see once you're there. That is a portrait of you. That's your relation to ""Zen."" Change it!  By the way: fuck the you that feels unable to realize It and wants to rely on teachings and books, take notes in the margins & ask ridiculous questions. Definitely fuck that ""you."" It's all I've ever said. Sit down and face the wall, ""you"" tiresome little fucker. ""Strive on! Strive on! Sentient beings must save themselves. No Buddha will do it for you."" -Huang-Po"

zen,3c41zj,pavelsky,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:37:34 2015 UTC,"In Bodhidharma's ""wall gazing"" which monks in Ch'an monasteries used to do four to six hours a day, the wall is used to cut off ordinary thinking consciousness. There is nothing there in front of you to arouse any particular thoughts about it. As thoughts wither & die away during energetic sitting meditation, your mind clears & you gain the ability to look intensely ""inward"" into the unmade, unborn, and unconditioned Mind essence. This leads, if you are patient, to the experience of sudden realization (wu, satori) which is your own and nobody else can give you."

It's a great intro text that covers history, philosophy, examples and quotations from various Zen masters. This way you will get a big picture, understand nuances of Zen and masters, and it will help you to choose your next book because ""The Way of Zen"" is filled with quotes from Bodhidharma to Joshu. I wouldn't recommend buying classic Zen text just yet because there is a good chance you will misunderstand it.

Hongren is clearly describing the first Jhana and Samadhi that follows it. Beyond the fourth Jhana is ""seeing your true nature"", it's not describable by words. Thus Hongren said ""I cannot describe it any further.""   The Southern School (Linji) deviate quite a bit from original teachings. They say that it's ""artificial striving"" whether Northern School that followed Bodhidharma's lineage and Lanka masters insisted on gradual practice. Southern School was known to hammer people into sudden realization through artificial practices just to be different. They were criticized for their radical subitism.   One way to look at is that clinging to meditation and Jhanas are not the point, therefore it is understandable why Southern School insisted on rejection of such methods.   Essentially these two passages might look contradictory but they are not."
zen,3c2g47,pavelsky,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:17:00 2015 UTC,"I've never seen a Zen master advocate for anapanasati. AFAIK Jhana meditation requires an object (as in anapanasati), which is exactly what Linji seems to be admonishing. His quote looks like a clear departure from Theravadin meditation. Hongren also doesn't seem to be advocating for traditional concentration meditation, as seen in the context of his quote, included here.   One way to look at is that clinging to meditation and Jhanas are not the point, therefore it is understandable why Southern School insisted on rejection of such methods.   Linji clearly says that even the practice of concentration meditation is artificial striving -- how can that be interpreted as ""don't cling to the jhanas""?

zen,3c2g47,pavelsky,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:18:53 2015 UTC,"I have very little reason to believe that Hongren was teaching anything besides anapanasati/vipassana. The early patriarchs are commonly referred to ""Lanka Masters"" in the records. Since Lankavatara sutra is related to Yogacara then it's reasonable to assume that meditation is not Zazen (Shikantaza) as described by Dogen.   As for Linji, it's his business what he rejects. Southern School of Chan deviated from the teachings of early Patriarchs and invented other esoteric practices like shouting, hitting monks, and clever word play known as ""Dharma combat"". Their ""do-nothing"" Zen has been highly promoted by Shenhui at expense of Shenxiu and traditional Northern School of Chan that still used Lankavatara sutra and teachings of the first 5 Patriarchs.   This debate has been going on for centuries and I don't need to get into details. I ascribe to Northern School of Zen along with later Caodong. We have plenty of folks around here who like to promote radical subitism of Linji, it's not my cup of tea.   Also, there is a case 94 in Blue Cliff Record that quotes Surangama Sutra which focuses on Jhanas. So anapanasati and Jhana meditation was certainly not unheard of and was around the time of Hongren."

zen,3c2g47,clickstation,2,Mon Jul 6 06:38:40 2015 UTC,"There's some sort of a ""categorization"" where there are two kinds of Ch'an: Diamond Sutra Chan and Lankavatara Sutra Chan.  There's also another ""categorization"" of ""the zen of the Patriarchs"" and ""the zen of the Buddha"".   I personally don't see them as being that different. Sometimes teachings change as a reaction to the people's understanding at the time.  Teachings get ""old"" after a while. More and more people follow them, but the quantity (and quality?) of teachers can seldom keep up. After a certain point, there will be more people practicing the ""wrong"" thing than the ""right"" thing. Then some master comes and introduces a ""new"" teaching.  From Theravada to Mahayana to Zen, and from one variation to another inside each of those traditions, there will be changes and ""new"" teachings.  In Theravada Buddhism itself, for example, if we take a look at the population of, say, Thailand, how many percent of the Buddhists there meditate? Compare this to, say, the West, where most Buddhists learn from scratch, how many of them meditate?   How many of them read the Suttas in their spare time? How many of them just repeat rituals etc.?"

I've tried to explain it to people before, but they don't understand how repetitive noise is the same as repetitive sitting. In all cases it's the repetition that matters, as that is how you end up with the loss of self. It's done through losing oneself in what one is doing. You can do that through recitation or copulation. As long as you do it with your entire being there will be no room left for a separate you."

The loss of self that prolonged prayer produces can be similar to meditation.  None of this stuff has anything to do with Zen.
zen,3c2g47,ewk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:36:00 2015 UTC,Saying none of it has to do with Zen is as easy as saying all of it has to do with Zen. Zen is not something that things are or are not part of.  I was simply stating that all means lead to the same end.

Having heard some of what they talk about, I am pointing out to you that you are not talking about what they are talking about, and they talk about that.  You might believe, for example, that ""all means lead to the same end"".  That's called Perennialism, not Zen.  Zen Masters teach that people who want to get somewhere aren't studying Zen."

It's all well and good to be esoteric. However please don't confuse the relative and the absolute though, which is what you are doing here.   Zen Masters teach that people who want to get somewhere aren't studying Zen.   Anyone who might be a Zen Master would never use the term, A Zen Master would have nothing to teach, and no reason to make the attempt. He certainly couldn't teach them to get somewhere, as there is nowhere to go. There isn't even a Zen to be studied, although there is this concept called Zen that people study.  Zen is not something you put into words. At no point in our conversation had I mentioned Zen. I've only talked about how I see meditation as something that can be applied to momentary life, and how I see every action as a form of meditation, some more intentional than others. I closed with the implication that every eventuality leads inevitably to the loss of self.

When I comment on Reddit I just comment on reddit, and when I reply to you I just reply to you. I don't comment on these things because these are the essential things in Zen, things I would assume you would know.   A disciple came to Zen Master Chao-Chou and asked ""I have just come to this monastery, may I have some instruction, please?"" The master replied, ""Have you eaten your breakfast yet, or not?"" ""Yes I have Sir."" The student responds. ""Then wash your dishes."" With that the student was enlightened.   As you said    Zen is a family of people who talk alot. Some of what they talk about is what they aren't talking about.   That's what I've been doing. Trying to not talk about that whole Zen thing. Mentioning it is like pointing at the elephant in the room. It's bad taste. Are we here in this forum to comment on Zen masters, and discuss Zen teachings? That seems to be very unlike Zen, as Zen is Iconoclastic, and must break even the image of itself to really be Zen.

This is called blankness. One can have success with minimal exertion by merely donning tattered robes, eating simple food, and clearly maintaining awareness of the present mind. Deluded people of the world do not understand this truth and put themselves through great anguish in their ignorance. Hoping to achieve liberation, they cultivate a broad range of superficial practices to gain merit – only to fall into the inevitable discontent of habitual cyclic existence.

The mind is neither still nor noisy, they don't understand Buddhadharma. Stopping the mind isn't either.

Some people say that there are some objects that you can concentrate on that are less poisonous than others. It has been recommended to me that I use ""visualization of white light"" as my object. Some people use other strange visualizations, other strange objects. Something like that might be what they are indicating in the OP.  I have little experience with such low-poison objects."

(Or, rather, it just came to pass that in our day and age the word ""concentration"" has been associated with a narrow kind of mental activity.)  woodrail said:   In concentration you concentrate on an object. In Zazen you move a different way, you sorta expand.   Hongren said (I paraphrase):   Practice such that the mind is not within you, not outside of you, and not in any location in between   Is this in line with what you're asking?

I'm not sure I disagree with him, now. But I'm not sure that's what he meant, either.  It's not about ""feeling like shrinking/expanding"".. It's in the attention span: concentration ""shrinks"" the attention span to just one object, while the other one (""zazen""? It's such an argueable word) ""expands"".. Well I wouldn't say 'expand' per se, I'd say 'relax' is more accurate. Not that you grab a lot of things, but you loosen your grip on anything.  Aaaanyway...   I don't see how woodrail's description is in disagreement with Hongren's advice; how does feeling like you're expanding betray that you're practicing in one of the three improper ways?

I entered a state of trance , I felt like death came upon me as I was merging into this ALL , the ideea of me was completely gone , and it clicked and I was completely absorbed into everything,  at this point a intense feeling of pleasure and ecstasy started to arise from my stomach area and I felt like my heart beat went crazy and was beating fast and with alot of power. I somehow snapped out of that state and I stop meditating.  I got scared because of the heartbeats.  I stopped meditating since then. It happened  last week . I don't wanna have a heart attack.

zen,3c0jox,drances,0,Fri Jul 3 23:07:29 2015 UTC,Sometimes wants can be contradictory. In this case you can only choose one or the other. Sometimes wants can be unrealistic. In this case reality will stop you from doing what you want. Sometimes wants can conflict with the social order. In this case others may try to stop you from doing what you want. Sometimes wants can conflict with your own personal internalized code of ethics or system of values. In this case you may stop yourself from doing what you want. Sometimes your wants may clash with the system by which you prioritize your wants based on your perceptions regarding what's realistic and your systems of value. In this case you may stop yourself from doing what you want.   All things are empty therefore everything is permitted.
zen,3c0jox,drances,2,Sat Jul 4 01:19:02 2015 UTC,"What is want, /u/drances?"
zen,3c0jox,drances,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:08:43 2015 UTC,"lol. Do you want an answer or do you want to stump me?  What any word means is dependent on the context in which its used. The context of course includes but is not limited to the people doing the interpreting. Generally a noun acts as a reference to an object in our experiance. Verbs refer to actions, and sometimes to responses we have towards objects in our experiance. To some extent our experiance is personal and dependent on our own unique perspective. To some extent our experiance is public and shared, like the shared experiance of watching the same movie. References to concrete objects is a little easier because they exist more in the realm of shared experiance. I can point to an apple or a car, and you yourself can perceive similarities and differences in your experiance of objects which allows you to make judgments about what I might mean by apple or car. With a 'want' however its a little different because we're talking about a reaction to an object. A want is a personal reaction to something. Maybe you could think of it as a perceived absence, something desired but without fulfillment of the desire. In any case it is the way you react or respond to that unfulfillment without satiation which is the wanting.  Of course if you disagree with my assessment I'd be happy to participate in some dialectic. It's up to you."
zen,3c0jox,drances,2,Sat Jul 4 09:43:36 2015 UTC,It's a description of something. But what is it a description of?
zen,3c0jox,drances,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:29:40 2015 UTC,"Want? An internal state of mind. Of course internal states of mind don't exist as such, so want is illusionary. This is fun."
zen,3c0jox,drances,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:12:56 2015 UTC,Why did you expend so much effort describing something you recognize as illusory?
zen,3c0jox,zenistthrowaway,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:21:01 2015 UTC,"This is actually pretty easy for me. What I'm saying is really just an amalgam of points others have made before. I've been talking philosophy for a few years, and I like to think of it as a reasonably well developed skill. It's like a game. I make some positive claim, you set yourself up in dialectical opposition, and we see what we can come up with. Some call this game ""bullshitting,"" but with those people I respectfully disagree. Bullshitting is usually funny, and this practice is clearly very serious. In any case, you imply you recognize that want is illusory, but can you tell me why?"
zen,3c0jox,smellephant,2,Sat Jul 4 21:38:46 2015 UTC,"You mistake me. I was talking about your everyday life.  Mistaking words for a reality that is outside of words says ""illusory"" to me."

In any case if there's any fault to be dolled out in a miscommunication it belongs to both parties. From my perspective you haven't exactly done your due diligence to be clear in what you mean, and so if I misunderstand it is simply a natural consequence of your unwillingness to be charitable and considerate in your communications.  As to the second point, what can I say? The conclusion that I am somehow mistaken is already built into what you say. What exactly is my mistake? What is a reality ""inside"" words and how does it differ from a reality ""outside"" of words?  You ought to clarify your position, otherwise I may be tempted to start knocking over straw men."

Unhappy.  Better to understand yourself, what drives you, what principles mean something to you. Live by those and you will feel a sense of rightness. It's hard to describe, I have tried before.

I guess. I never really thought of it that way, as I was trying to understand this long before I was introduced to Buddhism or Zen, so I didn't have the concept of ""duality"". But I strongly agree with this:   really comes with acceptance of the transience of both happiness and sadness.   .      What isn't seeing yourself as really important there?    Perhaps, humility was never my strong suite, but I didn't see this particular statement as being self important. Honestly, many years ago it was my first step in trying to understand myself. Once I understood these things I could try to understand why they were important. I haven't really thought of these in years. Perhaps I need to re-examine the way I explain this.

I greatly enjoy my morning commute, and I greatly enjoy everything else too. Is that causal? Is that within the duality? What am I accepting here? There's a lot more to accepting impermanence than living within dualities, and seeing this comes through questioning what you think is the norm. If you think something, ask yourself why you think that's the case. You can do this ad nauseum until a breakthrough happens, then do it with breakthrough too. It's a nice way to realize a whole lot about what's really going on.   Perhaps, humility was never my strong suite, but I didn't see this particular statement as being self important.

I haven't really thought of these in years. Perhaps I need to re-examine the way I explain this.   You misunderstand. I'm saying that the process of examining yourself by necessity puts yourself on the pedestal of importance. I live my life without examining myself at all, yet I'm capable of living life with utter confidence in my actions. My particular inclination is that these self-games that people play are just an overlay of what's really going on through their preferential terminology, and absolutely unnecessary.

I know that Buddhists have a very clear and somewhat simple path that must be followed to call yourself a Buddhist. I have not seen those types of requirements with Zen.  It seems to me that there is no hard and fast definition of Zen that anyone can lay out and point to ""There! That is Zen!""  So the question is why limit your sources of learning? Why not hear what the Dali Lama has to say on happiness, or enlightenment, or anything and tumble it around in our minds, seeing if it fits? Why would I limit my teachers, or at least my influencers because they are ""not-zen"" when no one can tell em what Zen is?  I know why I came to /r/zen, and the Dali Lama fits."
zen,3c00dd,sirwolf,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:40:35 2015 UTC,"""Zen"" is a family name.  The family does leave tracks, so how can you follow them?  This family is very talkative, you'd think it would be easy to find out about them.  If you want to listen to the Dali Lama or the Pope or L. Ron Hubbard or go to Mormon church or become a Muslim, go for it!  This is the Zen forum though.  So why not study Zen while you are here?"
zen,3c00dd,ewk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:15:50 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this family name, even though I have seen you say it before. I looked it up once and found that zen literally means meditate, and it came from chan, which means quietude.   As I understand the origins, this Buddhist guy brought Buddhism over to China and called it Chan. I know the story is much more interesting and exciting than that, but that's the essence, right?  What is this family?"
zen,3c00dd,sirwolf,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:17:56 2015 UTC,"You looked it up in the dictionary equivalent of People magazine.  There is no ""Buddhism"", either, since when you look that up in a real dictionary you find out the word was invented in the 1800's by a British travel blogger.  If India was an aviary, and the Chinese liked to draw birds, then what happened was around 550 CE a talking bird flew into China and pooped all over everybody.  Then Chinese people began transforming into talking birds and so the Chinese called these birds ""Zen"".  ""Zen"" is a hybrid word in Chinese.  The Chinese word ""chan"" sounded like the Indian word ""dhyana"", so the Chinese decided to translate ""dhyana"" into ""chan"".  Chan was a weird word to begin with and this worked out because the Chinese need a weird word to use as a name for the family that this guy Bodhidharma started."
zen,3c00dd,ewk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:54:11 2015 UTC,"for the family that this guy Bodhidharma started.   So, when you say ""family"" you could say community, or group."
zen,3c00dd,sirwolf,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:12:44 2015 UTC,I don't think so.  Community suggests some self-selective quality and group suggests some kind of arbitrary ordering.

zen,3bwrdt,jameswal_,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:14:09 2015 UTC,"Chan was heavily influenced by Taoism and Confucianism, Japanese Zen was heavily influenced by Shinto. Japanese Zen also changed things by making it more monastic. Zen teachers in the west often reject the ideas of rebirth. In the east the idea is still very popular. Many people put extra emphasis into different aspects of their practice. Some focus on the Bodhisattva ideal of saving everyone. Some focus on the Vinya to help gain mastery over their minds. Some fit in front of a wall, some sit in a large circle with others, others ""sit"" while walking to the store or working in the garden. Some find liturgy and ritual helpful, some don't. But people from each of these diverse practices can be united under the title of ""Zen"" or ""Chan"" or ""Soen"" or ""Thien"" because it describes their lineage back to Bodhidharma and his ever famous poem. Besides, Zen is just a word. The same word can apply to different things, or as Wittgenstein put it, words can be used differently in different ""language games"". I feel like much of the dispute that happens of r/zen is the result of people playing different language games and the differing rules of the various games begin conflicting each other."
zen,3bwrdt,jameswal_,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"You are repeating scholarship based on conjecture that people like D. T.  Suzuki dismantled years ago.   Further,  the scholarship you reference lacks examples and gives credibility to claims with no historical basis in fact.   Lots of people claim to be related to America's first pilgrims but we apply simple criteria and we can see those claims are fantasy or fraud.   Finally it is clear that there is only one Zen and that everyone is talking about the same thing: they all claim to come from Huineng  from Dongshan and Mazu.   One scholar argued the problem in the West originates in placing Zen scholarship in Religious Studies departments which are focused on describing faith doctrines rather than evaluating claims of legitimacy and doctrinal changes."

Why not read a book by an actual Zen Master?  Then you can decide for yourself if the church practices people are offering have anything to do with Zen.  You are correct, I don't make a practice of believing what people tell me, even if they are from a church."

Peace and love are not big talking points. But if that's what you're talking about, then why couldn't you simply say it?  However, is there a chance that some masters present one face to the public, and another to their disciples? The Wumen-guan starts with the memorial to the throne, which is quite political. It doesn't seem like too much of a stretch (albeit it is grasping at straws slightly) to have a modern day equivalent."

In a simple way, its ewks selection and interpretation of the old masters vs the personal experience of Songhill.   Seeking the experience of kensho (kensho changed my life, answered all my questions and left me at peace etc.). Denying the existence of kensho (kensho, whatever it is, is just a feeling. Not different than those induced by drugs, but induced in us by desperation or endorphins or whatever). Many people have experiences and they seek simple profound answers. These answers need to be examined closely. There is truth in some and not in others. Some just teach emptyness.  It is not that I want to paint you both with the same brush (perhaps i do though to support my own unified theory of life). i just can't see any way to choose between you.

I get that /u/ewk wants people to be transparent about their claims, but it's just kind of controlling, unfriendly, and seemingly pointless a lot of the time. I've come here to talk about Zen and have my lack of understanding shown by someone who can back up their claims. I haven't come here to take part in some kind of dharma-combat, in which your AMA determines your worth, and in which discussion centres around personal stuff (e.g. all the character-assassination shit, or the supposedly kenshoed people, etc.) rather than people's understanding of actual quotes from Zen texts.

zen,3btwfs,saensible,3,Thu Jul 2 02:56:31 2015 UTC,"Why don't you keep us in your pocket. Have an island of peaceful vibes with you at all times that you can tap into whenever you need.   Anxiety can be a real b, it's what Buddha said the whole problem was. He said it has a cause, which is getting hung up, and a solution, which is free conduct. In between those are the points of practice, which vary by tradition. In Dogen's Zen the points of practice are finding a true teacher and practicing zazen. That is not the only Zen flavor. As you can see human relationships are involved and different humans have practiced the Buddha Way differently over time.  Humans are social creatures. It does something to us when we are in proximity to one another. Teaching happens at every level of being and awareness.  I think anxiety happens when I model other people in my head. If I don't do that I have no idea what they're thinking and I have nothing to be anxious about. I really don't need to know what other people think. If I want to know I just ask.  You aren't alone in the practice. The practice is communal and always has been. People living together in the Way. Even the hermits commune, just look at r/zen."

R/zen might not be the ideal place to ask for advice, since this is zen-focused and many don't consider zazen to be meditation.  Either way, I think you should try it solo again.  It sounds like there's an idea in your head of what meditation is supposed to be, and you feel like your practice isn't up to those standards.  Those are likely bogus standards, especially for an on-and-off practitioner.  There is no reason to give up--by doing it, you succeed.  You have a lot of expectations about solo practice, group practice, others, and yourself.  You need to kill those expectations.  Smother them with a pillow when they begin to stir, or they'll smother you instead.  Try it out, one more time.  Talk about the difficulties you have in meditating.  Voicing the specifics tends to lead to palm-slapping-forehead moments.  Send me a PM if speaking publicly is uncomfortable.  I have no real weekend plans; I'll be available."

It is what Siddhartha awakened to and became ""Buddha"" and subsequently transmitted it.""  ""If you don't know the hautou you are not Zen. You will never understand what Wansong is talking about.""  3) Enlightened understanding is beyond the ordinary person ""[Enlightenment] is not a spiritual vision that can be understood by a prithagjana, a common person... If a person has a closed mind to realizing their Buddha-nature, there is nothing to realize except the nature of a worldling (prithagjana) which they are, already."" ""Yes, some of us (not all) have the ability to see our true nature.""  4) Good karma is required to enter the stream to nirvana. ( Paraphrased)  5) ""Zen"" isn't the name for the teachings of Bodhidharma's lineage. ""Whenever I say Zen I mean Saijojo Zen. Wumen and Wansong's dead words are incapable of revealing Saijojo Zen.""  6) There is no sudden enlightenment ""First, one had to become a Buddhist monk—then study lots and lots of sutras and meditate and walk to lectures. Maybe after 20 years they might awaken. It is not easy to become a Chanshi"".  7) There is only Buddhism, no Zen.    ""Zen is a diminutive for Zen Buddhism. There is, properly, no Zen sans Buddhism""  8) Zen Masters keep secrets.  ""Zen masters reveal the great family secret to the uninitiated.  They like to confuse the uninitiated""  9) Zen is a failed sutra study group  ""Zen masters declined in their spiritual ability and had to resort to inferior Sutras of the second turning.""  "" ""Joshu, or Layman Pang, and Dongshan - Not one of them knew how to enter Buddhism's gateless gate. They violated the four slogans of Zen.""  10 Without faith there can be no conversation  I have no problem defining Buddhism, but not to a skunk with its tail lifted up, ready to stink up the place.

Some claim to have seen the Virgin Mary. Some claim to have been in Heaven, talked to Jesus, and came back. There are all kinds of claims in this world. We can't just accept everything, do you agree? If we did, we would live in a psychotic world. To maintain sanity, we need a dose of healthy skepticism about people's claims. Especially in the case of  religious claims, regardless of where they come from, ancient texts or modern texts. Sometimes even very intelligent people will confuse their own inner world with objectivity.  OK - so much about my predisposition or my prejudice if you will. Now: what is an astral body? Is it like an out-of-body experience? Is it something subjective (like a psychedelic experience) or is it objective? Can the astral body be measured, can it have an effect on the environment, on other people?"
zen,3btwn1,theksepyro,0,Thu Jul 2 16:26:04 2015 UTC,"It's impossible to be absolutely neutral.    Yes, it is much easier to be prejudiced.   We always have a certain predisposition; one of skepticism in this case. . .    Right, fuck having an open mind. Don't Sit down before the fact as a little child (T. Huxley).   I am always learning.   It is called being a slow learner. A fast learner is someone like Max Planck.   Before I knew about quantum physics if someone told me about the double slit experiment, I'd say ""impossible!""   QM is just another theory/model, but a very powerful one which has unsettled the supposedly older settled theories and models of the last 300 years. But all such theories and models Zrxn are fictions or as Paul Feyerabend would say, myths. Yes, man is still in the process of myth-making.    People believe in all kinds of stuff.   Yes, black holes, mega black holes, worm holes, mini black holes and CMB (cosmic microwave background). There is no evidence for their existence. What do you know about Poltergeists? (Hurry up and Google it then try to impress me with your knowledge of the subject.)   We can't just accept everything, do you agree?   So who is going to be the judge and jury—in short, the censors? Your ilk? I don't think so.    we need a dose of healthy skepticism about people's claims. Especially in the case of religious claims, regardless of where they come from, ancient texts or modern texts.   This is just a veiled attack against psychic research.   What is an astral body?

zen,3boelb,MsBlunt,3,Tue Jun 30 21:04:17 2015 UTC,"In your post, you said that you have read many books about Zen. That's good. But if you are thinking, you can't understand Zen. Anything that can be written in a book, anything that can be said-all this is thinking. If you are thinking, then all Zen books, all Buddhist sutras, all Bibles are demons' words. But if you read with a mind that has cut off all thinking, then Zen books, sutras, and Bibles are all the truth. So is the barking of a dog or the crowing of a rooster: all things are teaching you at every moment, and these sounds are even better teaching than Zen books. So Zen is keeping the mind which is before thinking. Sciences and academic studies are after thinking. We must return to before thinking. Then we will attain our true self.  In your post you said that your practice has been counting exhalations to ten. This method is not good, not bad. It is possible to practice in this way when you are sitting. But when you are driving, when you are talking, when you are watching television, when you are playing tennis-how is it possible to count your breaths then? Sitting is only a small part of practicing Zen. The true meaning of sitting Zen is to cut off all thinking and to keep not-moving mind. So I ask you: What are you? You don't know; there is only ""I don't know."" Always keep this don't-know mind. When this don't-know mind becomes clear, then you will understand. So if you keep don't-know mind when you are driving, this is driving Zen. If you keep it when you are talking, this is talking Zen. If you keep it when you are watching television, this is television Zen. You must keep don't-know mind always and everywhere. This is the true practice of Zen.   The Great Way is not difficult  if you do not make distinctions.  Only throw away likes and dislikes,  and everything will be perfectly clear.   So throw away all opinions, all likes and dislikes, and only keep the mind that doesn't know. This is very important. Don't-know mind is the mind that cuts off all thinking. When all thinking has been cut off, you become empty mind. This is before thinking. Your before-thinking mind, my before-thinking mind, all people's before-thinking minds are the same. This is your substance. Your substance, my substance, and the substance of the whole universe become one. So the tree, the mountain, the cloud, and you become one. Then I ask you: Are the mountain and you the same or different? If you say ""the same,"" I will hit you thirty times. If you say ""different,"" I will still hit you thirty times. Why? The mind that becomes one with the universe is before thinking. Before thinking there are no words. ""Same"" and ""different"" are opposites words; they are from the mind that separates all things. That is why I will hit you if you say either one. So what would be a good answer? If you don't understand, only keep don't-know mind for a while, and you will soon have a good answer. If you do, please PM it to me.  You asked why we use words to teach, if understanding through words is impossible. Words are not necessary. But they are very necessary. If you are attached to words, you cannot return to your true self. If you are not attached to words, soon you will attain enlightenment. So if you are thinking, words are very bad. But if you are not thinking, all words and all things that you can see or hear or smell or taste or touch will help you So it is very important for you to cut off your thinking and your attachment to words.  Here is a poem for you:   Buddha said all things have Buddha-nature.  Jo-ju said the dog has no Buddha-nature.  Which one is correct?  If you open your mouth, you fall into hell.  Why?  KATZ!!!  Clouds float up to the sky.  Rain falls down to the ground."
zen,3boelb,Dukkha_Nukem,3,Tue Jun 30 23:25:15 2015 UTC,"While still alive, be therefore assiduous in practising Dhyana [meditation].  The practice consists in abandonments.  ‘The abandonment of what?’ you may ask. Abandon your four elements (bhuta), abandon your five aggregates (skandha), abandon all the workings of your relative consciousness (karmavijnana), which you have been cherishing since eternity; retire within your inner being and see into the reason of it.  As your self-reflection grows deeper and deeper, the moment will surely come upon you when the spiritual flower will suddenly burst into bloom, illuminating the entire universe.  The experience is incommunicable, though you yourselves know perfectly well what it is. ~ Master Sixin Wuxin 死心悟新"
zen,3boelb,songhill,3,Wed Jul 1 01:37:14 2015 UTC,"I think you are getting close.  You're starting to ""feel"" that the words aren't enough, that they are pointing to something that you can't quite grasp.  This is good.  Now, you are going to have to learn to use less force, less effort.  You are straining to hear a whisper, when what you are actually trying to hear is silence.  That requires not effort, but only presence.  There is no ""proper"" or perfect path.  There are paths that have worked for others, and so they are a good place to start.  But if your path is your own, so be it.  You've got a lot of expectations about how things should be.  I won't say that is good or bad, but I would suggest you look at it, and really see it for what it is.     Relax and stop trying so hard.  There is no magical happiness at the end of the rainbow.  Think of it as just exploring another way to interact with the moment you are in.  I think sitting is a wonderful practice.  But don't become to attached to that either.  You're doing fine.  Keep doing it."
zen,3boelb,chattymcgee,4,Wed Jul 1 02:48:12 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I'm just a random person with an imperfect understanding of Zen, even superficially.  What kind of Zen are you interested in? There is Chinese Zen (Ch'an), which tends to emphasize sudden enlightenment, and which happens to be the main subject of discussion on this forum. There is Japanese Zen, which is what most people think of as ""Zen"", and which teaches gradual enlightenment. Korean Seon seems similar to Ch'an, and I know nothing about Vietnamese Thien apart from that Thich Nhat Hanh is its most famous modern master. Because I am most familiar with Ch'an, it will be the focus of my discussion. If you are interested in Japanese Zen (which you seem to be), then the people on /r/Buddhism are likely better equipped to help you.  Zazen is an integral part of Japanese Zen, but is less important in Ch'an. Ch'an teaches that the mind-essence is always present, and should not be sought after through practices (well, mostly). A famous Ch'an koan/gong-an/case (basically, a story involving a Zen master) is as follows:   A monk asked Zhaozhou to teach him.  Zhaozhou asked, ""Have you eaten your meal?""  The monk replied, ""Yes, I have.""  ""Then go wash your bowl"", said Zhaozhou.  At that moment, the monk was enlightened.   It is only later in Ch'an's history that expedient teachings like tso-ch'an (zazen) and hua-t'ou (there's a recent post here on this method) became widely used; before then, the mind-essence was transmitted directly through various actions and phrases, or realized through random events.  Ch'an also teaches that you shouldn't try to purify your mind or end your thoughts, but rather that upon enlightenment you will realize that your mind is pure, and your thoughts are themselves simply manifestations of the mind-essence.  So basically, if it's Ch'an you seek, then no need to sit zazen or do anything apart from what you naturally do. I wrote a bunch about precepts, but I realized I don't know enough to be confident in what I was saying. Search for ""precepts"" in the search bar for some original sources on Ch'an attitudes toward precepts, just be wary if the OP has included their own commentary (which allows an anti-precept or pro-precept agenda to slip in).  I don't know much about sesshin; AFAIK, it's largely a Japanese Zen phenomenon. Ch'an practice is continuous and not restrained to form; you consider your hua-t'ou as often as reasonably doable. That doesn't mean sesshin is inferior; it's just a set opportunity to seriously consider a hua-t'ou. You probably should start reading some of the texts listed here; I'd recommend Huangbo, Mazu, and Bankei for Ch'an. You can find some pdf's online of their stuff.   So I've pretty much stopped trying to reason out what the words may indicate and try only to practice, sitting zazen and thinking about who or what writes these words, eats, sleeps, etc. But I wonder if I am giving up on words without truly exhausting them?   I don't think it matters; I don't know of any Zen masters who said ""OMG you gave up on words without truly exhausting them? How heretical!"" TBH I don't really know what you should be doing; I try to do hua-t'ou, and otherwise I just read whatever I can get my hands on. I also try to drop all of my views without actually trying to do anything (and I have yet to figure out how that all works, but it's recommended by many masters). I'm still doing research to see if there are any modern masters I can eventually go visit, as that is the traditional way to study Zen.  In the end, I don't think I answered much (sorry!), but hopefully this clarified the Ch'an stance on things, at least. But do go read things, and that way you don't have to take anyone's word for anything. And if it's Japanese Zen you're interested in, check out /r/Buddhism, as this sub can be anti-Japanese-Zen at times."

Let me expound my views for the benefit of all beings!

I say that as someone who's done a fair bit of meditation and trying to understand who I am. I've been to a few sesshins as well, very interesting experiences. But as for the epiphany that Zen is all about, I haven't had it, so for me to ""recommend"" sesshin would come from a place of non-understanding. I can recommend it as an interesting experience, and maybe as a difficult endurance challenge, and as a way to see how your mind reacts to lots of sitting meditation...

Zazen in the West is a term that specifically refers to the prayer-meditation that Dogen Buddhists practice.  Dogen wrote a text called ""FukanZazenGi"" which you can easily google and find any number of translations for.  Since it is a religious document you might want to get a priest to interpret it for you since different churches have different interpretations.  Zen Masters don't teach prayer-meditation.   sesshin    Again, in the West this is generally a term used by Dogen Buddhist churches.  It's like confession.  Go and try it out.   it must come through practice   Dogen Buddhists (aka Soto) call their prayer ""practice""... and yes, their religious experiences come through prayer.   brick wall beyond which words cannot go.    You have to have faith if you want to believe stuff.   So I've pretty much stopped trying to reason out what the words may indicate and try only to practice, sitting zazen   Without words there wouldn't be any value in Zazen prayer-meditation.  Now that you have faith in those words then what's left for you to do besides more prayer?  .  This all has nothing to do with Zen, though.  Here's a book by a Zen Master: http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/zen/mumonkan.htm  You won't find anything about practice or prayer in there... at least nothing you can use to help yourself."

zen,3bpvqg,Temicco,-2,Wed Jul 1 07:56:41 2015 UTC,"Nobody said they weren't allowed to put up their own wiki. This one ewk made, curated, and talks at length about in all the texts he posts. Of course he will disagree if someone puts on random crap without as much as a whisper as to why they want to include that stuff. Do you think the care bears belong there? Would you just put them up there without asking? Worse, for things like Dogen there is open disagreement in the community. Why not just put up a canon of texts that everyone agrees on and talk about those? It's not as if we're even close to exhausting them."
zen,3bpvqg,sdwoodchuck,5,Wed Jul 1 08:03:13 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me that what you're arguing for is not a wiki, or at the very least, not the wiki that we have.  The wiki is open to public modification, with or without discussion.  If we're looking for a page preserving the list that ewk made, curated, and talks at length about, without public modification, then maybe ewk's lineage text reference page should be somewhere other than the wiki.  I'm not even jumping into the argument about what does or doesn't belong there, because it really isn't about what ""belongs"" there.  Our wiki doesn't work like that.  It's basically just a matter of ""who most recently has had the will to change it.""    As for whether or not ChopWater has been botting as a means to edit it, I don't know.  If he is, it seems more sad than problematic, but I agree that using a bot to undo changes would be asinine."
zen,3bpvqg,ewk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:32:14 2015 UTC,"without discussion   If that were true, then you would encourage ZeroDay's ""contribution"" involving deleting the wiki and replacing it with sutras?  I keep asking for discussion about Zen and I keep getting people insisting that they are enlightened who encourage me to pray.  One even suggested I send money.  Maybe a wiki isn't so bad?"
zen,3bpvqg,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:02:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't encourage anything of the sort.  Ideally, I agree, discussion would be part of that equation, but that isn't the format the wiki is working with.

zen,3bpvqg,ewk,0,Wed Jul 1 17:35:18 2015 UTC,There are only five people that ever edited the wiki.  Nobody really cares about the wiki.  The wiki has become a proxy for people who aren't willing to have a conversation about their faith.
zen,3bpvqg,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:42:15 2015 UTC,I don't even disagree with any of that.
zen,3bpvqg,sdwoodchuck,-3,Wed Jul 1 17:59:31 2015 UTC,"Sure it should be open to public modification. But it is also open to public criticism, and I consider this guy's actions trolling, plain and simple. If I'm arguing anything, it would be kicking out this particular user. If people don't agree, I won't object, but he's being an ass and I see no reason to keep him around."
zen,3bpvqg,sdwoodchuck,3,Wed Jul 1 08:41:20 2015 UTC,"You'll certainly never hear me defending ChopWater's integrity, whether he is or isn't using a bot to edit the wiki.  That said, I guess I just can't get behind ""kicking out this particular user"" on the grounds of trolling and being an ass, no matter how much I may agree with the harsh opinions of him.  ""Being an ass"" is such an ill-defined concept (folks in this subreddit have a hard enough time just trying to nail down what is or isn't a personal attack) that taking action based on it feels too sloppy of a reasoning to me.  I certainly wouldn't complain if he was gone, but I can't push for that either.  Now if he is botting the wiki, that's a less ill-defined circumstance, and is certainly actionable.  It certainly looks to me like he is, but I have no expertise on any of that, so I have no confidence in my assessment.  So I'm not really pushing for that either.  Lastly, I will say that I agree 100% that public criticism should be encouraged.  But so should criticism of the criticism, and criticism of that, etc.  All I was really getting at is, if someone is editing the wiki in a way that you dislike, might it not be a better idea to pursue other methods of presenting that information such that it's less prone to being tampered with?"
zen,3bpvqg,love0_-all,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:54:17 2015 UTC,"Point taken.  I guess I have some nebulous idea in mind where if enough people wanted to get rid of someone, they'd be gotten rid of. I dislike using rigid rules for such a purpose as people would just try to game the system somehow and you get into the argument of what does or does not constitute a personal attack or silly things like that.  Maybe a person could have people vouch for them too instead of just calling for votes for a ban.  It probably shows I'm not good at this stuff, but I see people try to game the rules so much around here that I'm not exactly prone to place any trust in rules. I'm more in favor of human judgement on a case by case basis. This place isn't a country, it doesn't seem that unfeasible.  As for botting being actionable, I don't know about that. I'd say it was more actionable when he spammed this place with porn, but I guess nobody else cared, so I'm probably not a good judge of what is actionable or not."
zen,3bpvqg,mujushingyo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:01:20 2015 UTC,"It probably shows I'm not good at this stuff, but I see people try to game the rules so much around here that I'm not exactly prone to place any trust in rules.   I think it shows that you're better at this than you give yourself credit for, at the very least.    Unfortunately, both directions have problems.  A strict rules-based system does lend itself to people gaming the rules, and pushing exactly as far as they can get while still toeing the line.  At the opposite end, a system built solely around human judgment on a case-by-case basis lends itself to favoritism (if it's a select few's judgment), or to popularity contests (if it's a community judgment).    Personally, I see the latter two as being worse than the possibility of folks gaming the system.  Yes, it lends itself to people getting away with being belligerent, and that's unfortunate, but it also doesn't leave the door open to excluding unpopular opinions by voting them off the island, so to speak.    But the problems involved there are why I'm generally not in favor of banning as a practice, though there are some instances where I think it's justified (for example, if ChopWater is using a bot to modify the wiki, then perhaps removing his wiki modification privileges would be a more sensible route than an outright ban), and in some cases I can't say the the target of a ban would be missed by me, personally."
zen,3bpvqg,clickstation,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:10:27 2015 UTC,"You're right about banning, especially since he'd just make another alt and start the whole shebang all over again. revoking wiki privileges would be nice, but I don't know if that's possible.  As for stifling people's opinions through majority rule, yes, that might happen. But if people want it, they will do it, no matter what. That's also why I proposed something like a vouching system. I do trust people enough that they will use moderation with something like this, though maybe I'm mistaken and we'd drown in petitions all day. Meh."

zen,3bpvqg,ewk,-1,Wed Jul 1 15:38:30 2015 UTC,"OP is talking about botting. I don't know what the religious thing you just mentioned is, but OP is clearly worried about someone using a bot to edit the wiki. If someone is using a bot to revert automatically,  that effectively changes the wiki from a publicly edited page to a pseudo-privately written manifesto.  Dota2nub wants to make sure that isn't happening. I suspected that this was happening a while ago, I just don't care enough about the wiki to make a stink about it.  When you chime in with your ""cute"" comments and your implications about other users, you're entering the power struggle over the issue. Don't pretend you're not muddy if you're going to roll in the mud!  I'm not saying you're right or wrong, I'm just saying it's silly to pretend you're standing above a puddle when you are clearly swimming in it."
zen,3bpvqg,clickstation,-2,Wed Jul 1 15:47:45 2015 UTC,Hmm? The bot can check every 10 minutes. Nothing to do with 'reaction time'  So you don't care about 'power struggles' yet you post here as if you had anything to say?

zen,3bpvqg,ewk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:06:42 2015 UTC,"""Every hour"" is not supported by the data. There's only been two edits 23 hours ago, and then one edit 12 hours ago (reverted by ChopWater 11 hours ago), before you became suspicious and test your theory by changing the wiki twice an hour ago..  I don't have a theory.. I'm asking why."
zen,3bpvqg,clickstation,-2,Wed Jul 1 06:10:28 2015 UTC,Hmm? I don't like botting. And I'm not sure why the account hasn't been banned for posting porn on this subreddit. I don't know what it takes to kick someone out. People didn't seem to care about the porn. Maybe they care about this? I certainly think it's petty and not conducive to discussion.
zen,3bpvqg,ewk,-5,Wed Jul 1 06:13:31 2015 UTC,"The first question is whether it's okay for Chopwater to use a bot to insert his wiki changes.  Remember when he did this on his previous alt?  He is altering the wiki way faster then he has before and way more often.  The second question is what purpose the wiki serves in a discussion forum.  Remember when ZeroDay deleted the wiki and replaced it with sutras?  Which is this, a ewk-type change or a ZeroDay type change?   ewk did an AMA, answering questions about context.  Chopwater refuses to AMA from any of his alts. ZeroDay made the changes without any OPs about the content changes.  Chopwater also makes changes without any OP's about the content changes.   If this is a discussion forum, then Chopwater's changes, like ZeroDay's, are in the context of his refusing to discuss his views or his changes to the wiki.  That's trolling not discussion.  If wikis aren't the result of discussion then I suppose the mods could allow anyone to create any wiki and say that anything anybody likes is Zen.  The Scientologists and the Mormons could have ""Zen Scientology"" and ""Mormzen"" wikis where they list alternative Zen lineages that include L. Ron and Joseph Smith.  Or the mods could delete and remove all wikis without discussion.  If this is a discussion forum and people refuse to discuss what they believe and why something belongs or doesn't in the wiki, then Chopwater's alterations aren't contributing to the conversation."

zen,3bpvqg,songhill,-1,Wed Jul 1 05:52:33 2015 UTC,"The mods don't seem to agree with you.  Deleting the wiki and replacing it with sutras, for example, was not deemed to be ""in the spirit of a discussion about Zen.""  Now that I think about it, weren't you on the mod team when that decision was made?  Awkward.  I suppose if you say ""anything goes"" now that you aren't a mod that you have changed your views on moderation... perhaps now you might encourage people to delete content they find objectionable whatever the basis for their objection?  Will you be using bots to post religious doctrines in the forum going forward?  Or is that a step too far?  Now that I think about it, you never did find the time to do an AMA, did you?"

I think you kids have provided enough drama for one sub.  If anyone wants to ask me questions, though, as my flair suggests, AMA! Anytime, anywhere.  It's not like I ever evaded a question, or derail the question like you did when I asked about why anyone would suspect ChopWater is using a bot..

You are right.  Maybe chopwater has just devoted his life to updating the wiki with Dogen.  Sounds reasonable.  As far as you not wanting to contribute to the drama, what do you think contributes to it more: Doing and AMA and answering questions, or claiming you will answer questions ""whenever"" potentially derailing other threads and thereby overlooking the fact that you are, by refusing to AMA, refusing to answer questions?  Are you going to post about Zen?  Or just snark around insisting that you don't want to add to the drama?"

I'm all for allowing a public place remain a public place. And a wiki is a public place. If you want to control the lineage texts entry, tough luck, you chose the wrong medium.  And I've been saying the same thing since people complained about you having all the time in a day to revert the changes that other people made.. so it's not like my argument is one-sided.  Plus I never said the wiki holds any particular importance, especially the lineagetexts page. You can put sutras there and it won't change a thang. You're still you, and I'm still me.   As far as you not wanting to contribute to the drama, what do you think contributes to it more   Stop diddlying around and just ask me if you have questions."
zen,3bpvqg,songhill,-1,Wed Jul 1 16:29:12 2015 UTC,"You didn't answer the question.  Let's try again.  Was ZeroDay's deletion of the wiki about Zen texts and replacing it with links to sutras an appropriate use of public space in the Zen forum?  And since you are obviously reluctant to answer, I'll throw in a bonus question:  Does the reddiquette's injunction to pick the appropriate forum suggest that reddit encourages people to delete wikis from other forums and replace them with religious material?  As far as your AMA goes, I know you are chicken.  What's left for me to ask you?"
zen,3bpvqg,singlefinger,2,Wed Jul 1 17:10:55 2015 UTC,"an appropriate use of public space in the Zen forum   How do you know what's appropriate? Faith in the Zhaozhou-Jesus?  A public place is a public place. No faith needed.   Does the reddiquette's injunction to pick the appropriate forum suggest that reddit encourages people to delete wikis from other forums and replace them with religious material?   You're going to have to ask the admins that. I can't read their mind.  But if you're trying to insinuate that only Zen-related stuff should be posted in /r/zen, I can't agree more.  What I disagree with is when someone tries to monopolize the definition of ""Zen-related"" and force it to obey their own religious preference.  Clear enough for you?   What's left for me to ask you?   You're not the first person in history to run away while calling the other person ""chicken,"" don't worry."

And reddit admins say, ""Hey people, we gave you forums to discuss different stuff in and we don't like it when people try to promote their favorite forum by proselytizing in other forums.""  If you don't like it, that's your business.  You say you agree that Zen goes in the Zen forum, but what is Zen?  Did you not want to start with Bodhidharma?  Did you not want to read the lineage texts?  I call you a chicken because throughout your mod career and up till now you are afraid to do an AMA... but that's not the only reason.

Truth be told, Buddhism is about waking up to our true nature which, right now, in our ignorance or avidya, we fail to recognize.

zen,3bmtyb,love0_0all,2,Tue Jun 30 22:28:24 2015 UTC,"This case is drawn from the Surangama Sutra. Interesting how that sutra keeps popping up in the great Zen classics. I've posted a link to it here on this forum. At issue is the experience of perfect pervasiveness, as attained by the sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Assembly while bathing. They all awoke to the basis of water, which is inconceivable and indescribable. This kind of sudden awakening is Zen. It's also Buddhism.   All of you Ch'an worthies, how will you understand their saying, ""Subtle feeling reveals illumination, and we have achieved the station of sons of Buddha""? To realize this you too must be extremely piercing and penetrating.    You must be extremely piercing and penetrating. That's what all the fuss is about. Once you have clear illumination, you can just eat when hungry, sleep when tired. If you don't have it you won't be able to resist getting into hair-splitting arguments with people and pretending to be what you are not. You'll keep adding layers of mud on top of mud. You won't be the Master of your thoughts, but the slave of your delusions.  Our peerless Master Yuanwu continues:   If you can penetrate in one place, then you penetrate a thousand places, ten thousand places all at once. Don't just hold onto a single nook or den -- all places are the gates by which Avalokitesvara enters the truth.  For the Ancients too there was ""awakening to the Path by hearing sounds, illuminating Mind by seeing forms."" If a single man awakens, this is the reason. But why did the sixteen bodhisattvas awaken at the same time? Because the Ancients practiced together and experienced together, awakened together and understood together.   Do you know precisely what Master Yuanwu means by ""all places are the gates by which Avalokitesvara enters the truth""? You don't, if you haven't read the Surangama Sutra! By the way, how does Master Yuanwu's affirmation of ""entering the truth"" fit in with the claim that ""Zen is against all truth""?  It looks like Master Yuanwu is not only quoting at length from a classic Mahayana Buddhist sutra for the purposes of pointing out that Zen's ""clear illumination"" is the same as the sudden awakening of the sixteen Bodhisattvas, but also praising ""practice"" and ""experience"" to boot, does it not?"
zen,3bmtyb,love0_-all,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:38:43 2015 UTC,"It's also Buddhism.   Oddly enough nobody agrees with you.  Buddhists in general don't believe in sudden awakening.  It's one of the reasons why they insisted that ""Zen"" be given a name different from Theravada.   You must be extremely piercing and penetrating.    Sure.  Which is why I urge you to penetrate through your dishonesty in this forum and do an AMA about your alts and your Japanese Ki Power! beliefs and so on.  Penetrate thoroughly.  Don't settle for even a speck of dishonesty.   Don't just hold onto a single nook or den -- all places are the gates by which Avalokitesvara enters the truth.   Can you enter by the gate of AMA or not?  If you run away when people ask you about your conduct and your beliefs, then when you say ""practice"" you are lying to yourself."

If ewk has a conscience he probably realizes that he hasn't had clear illumination so he has to make sure no one else has had clear illumination either.   The AMA is not a dialogue or a conversation.

I studied symbolic logic but not more advanced formalisms. Symbolic logic is ""valid"" independent of the ""truth"" of the premises.   I've been assured by others' confidence* in Godel's theorem that logic cannot prove itself.   Facts seem to evolve: Earth is no longer flat and mice no longer spontaneously arise from dust bunnies. And though I'm hesitant to say so, it feels like there's been progress.   So, anyway. I end up with a conclusion and a question.   The conclusion feels zenny to me: take jokes, Haiku and other arts to heart. Moment by moment the real presents itself differently.   The question is, What's going on when anyone tries so very hard to prove something to another?

zen,3bjrcz,loftycombos,5,Mon Jun 29 23:34:52 2015 UTC,"The only constant in Zen is ""enlightenment"" or ""realizing your true nature"", everything else is superfluous. Sutras, techniques, meditation, Qi, etc. are all secondary because they are just that. They can aid you, like training wheels, but they shouldn't matter so much that people are losing sleep over them or engage in countless arguments. It's like sailing to the New World, there are many routes and methods, many nationalities that sailed there. The important part is getting there. This is why in Buddhism we have Hinayana, Mahayana, Ekayana, etc. Small, Great, One vehicle, respectively. If we look at Zen history then we see various sutras being emphasized at various points in time. From Lanka to Diamond to Heart to Surangama, etc. We also see evolution of ""Zen transmission"". It was enough for Bodhidharma to give Lanka Sutra to Huike and call it a day because he said that everything he will need is going to be in that Sutra. It was enough for Huineng to hear one verse of Diamond Sutra to gain insight. Later Zen masters of Tang would employ shouts, beatings, koans, zazen, etc. So what I am getting at is that there is no reason to single out this or that master and what kind of teachings they've used. If a person is truly awakened then he can teach and aid pupils in anyway or form. Zen masters of Tang used various methods but they also went around and tried to confirm their understanding of Zen from other masters of their time, that was the only measurement of ""Zen or not Zen""."
zen,3bjrcz,pavelsky,5,Tue Jun 30 00:43:32 2015 UTC,"Most of Zen, if not all, is still to be found in the Lankavatara Sutra. We could burn up the Blue Cliff Records, the Mumonkan and all such other works and not be off the path. The Zen the Song creators fashioned was for the sake of skillful means. It reminds one of this story from the Lotus Sutra:   The Phantom City (chapter 7)  A group of people are being led by a knowledgeable guide through a wilderness to a place where, they are told, they will find great treasure. After some time, the group become weary and disheartened and wish to turn back. The guide tells them that, just a short distance ahead, there is a city where they can lodge and refresh themselves. They enter the city, and, when they feel better, the city vanishes. The guide explains that he had created it by magic to satisfy their needs, and, now that it has fulfilled its purpose, he has made it disappear. The treasure, he says, is near, and if they make one more effort, they will find it. We are then told that the guide is the Buddha; the group of people are disciples; the phantom city is Buddhism; and the treasure is the Buddha Nature.    Zen is the phantom city for the weary. But soon it must disappear.  Edit: The synopsis is from Robert K.C. Forman's book, The Innate Capacity."

zen,3bjrcz,ewk,6,Tue Jun 30 15:25:10 2015 UTC,"As /u/ewk has pointed out below, I think both approaches have their issues... What makes Wumen and Yuanwu Zen masters, and are they indeed teaching Qi in the same context? But I don't want to get into Hakuin (which I might do in a later post), but rather point out this bigger issue.  I think the best thing to do is thoroughly read all of the masters, and try to group them based on their teachings. Subitism is taught by Mazu and Wumen, but not by Hakuin. Bankei and Chinul both teach a kind of ""tracing back"" method of identifying the dharmakaya, but beyond that I haven't read into them enough to definitively group them.  Because of all this, we are clearly not only talking about one kind of Zen. The issue with having a bunch of different things called ""Zen"" is that the teachings will not be talking about the same thing, but will be used without discrimination by unenlightened teachers. Some masters say completely opposite things; how can we confidently use them all? It seems perilous for the student's understanding of Zen to do this.  Edit: to specifically address the fallacy mentioned in the OP, I think that's a valid criticism too. The whole ""true Zen master"" thing is bullshit; why not specify using some other unbiased but descriptive term?"
zen,3bjrcz,Temicco,2,Mon Jun 29 22:20:40 2015 UTC,I think you bring up a good point to identify the varying styles of teaching across the tradition. Styles and methods vary as well as the subject(s) of any particular teaching to the point that some teachings appear contradictory to each other (at least at face value).

zen,3bjrcz,ewk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:29:27 2015 UTC,"traces all the way back   lol :P  Ah cool, thanks. I think Bodhidharma mentions it at some point, too. Still not enough to establish the same enlightenment! I've been considering compiling a massive, by-topic and by-Zen-teacher list of what different people say (including context); that way they could be more easily compared.  Such categories could be stuff like ""the nature of mind"", ""the qualities of the dharmakaya"", ""do's"", ""do-not's"", ""on delusion"", ""how the masters actually taught people"", etc. I think it would be quite an asset, but it would take such a long time and I would probably need help... I'll probably just do an OP about it."
zen,3bjrcz,drances,2,Mon Jun 29 22:36:38 2015 UTC,"Informal logical fallacies are interesting because they often have non-fallacious counterparts which have the form of the fallacy but are not themselves fallacious. Here for instance it seems that the problem is a lack of consensus on what a Zen Master is. If you're speaking to someone who is unwilling to create any kind of consensus, then you're simply operating on your own definition, which we sometimes call ""begging the question.""   Or maybe you act as if you're operating on some definition when you're not. There's this old joke in philosophy circles that all philosophy boils down to semantics."
zen,3bjrcz,ewk,-2,Mon Jun 29 23:24:54 2015 UTC,"Disagree.  Everybody here agrees that ""Zen Masters"" refers to the lineage of Bodhidharma down through Wumen and Wansong and Yunmen.  The problem people have is that Zen Masters don't endorse religions.  So people try to add in Zen Masters by insisting that this or that priest is a Zen Master and so what the priest says is automatically ""Zen"".  There is a consensus.  If there wasn't then people wouldn't be choking on it."

zen,3bjrcz,songhill,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:02:08 2015 UTC,"No.  I don't get that impression anyway.  Huangbo, for instance, is arguing about how to interpret Buddha's teachings from India.  To the extent that people in his audience are trying to bring faith into that conversation, he is critical of their arguments.  But he and the rest of the Zen lineage don't spend any significant time on the afterlife, on Gods and demons, on supernatural powers.    When people cross into dharma territory the Masters are merciless, but they don't get involved much in religious questions.  They don't seem to be that interested."

zen,3bi9c3,songhill,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:43:25 2015 UTC,Mumokan is not history. It is a Song period work which is based on other Song period works. The intent of the Mumonkan is to awaken us to the Buddha Mind. It's not a text to teach us mockery or character assassination.
zen,3bi9c3,ewk,-1,Mon Jun 29 15:31:31 2015 UTC,"As far as Mumon is concerned, it is history.  If you don't notice the mockery in the text then maybe get a literacy tutor.  If you think you can assassinate anybody in the text, take your shot."
zen,3bi9c3,songhill,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:35:42 2015 UTC,"Not surprised that someone like you would see the Mumokan has the history of gedozen since you don't understand the basic idea of the koan and what they point to.   Your fallback position is: the Mumonkan is an historical text; it teaches mockery and character assassination.   Does the academic Zen establishment know of your homegrown, Reddit genius ewk? Maybe you can explain to them what each koan means and hopefully dazzle them with your insights. Are you working on a paper to be submitted to the Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies?"

Too many people pretend they are awakened. Enlightenment is so easy. Just sit in zazen, be in the here and the now, and don't forget to be politically correct. But the Buddha never taught such nonsense nor did his descendants, nor teachers like Bodhidharma and his descendants. All taught being awakened to the unconditioned. Huangbo called it the unconditioned Mind. This transcendent reality has a thousand names but a single taste. In a split second we can see the unconditioned and enter the gateless gate.

Any label or term in your mind both applies to one thing, all things, no things... In this way, the mind is full and the world is empty. In the mind of the buddha, who sees much but whose mind is as empty as the world, there is no such thing as a such thing. When the mind is as empty as the body, then the mind sees the whole of the body of truth - the Dharmakaya. If the dharmakaya was somehow a thing in the mind of the buddha, the buddha has a full mind and cannot fathom that the world is empty. In exactly this way, the dharmakaya is the emptiness.  Even this explanation, if being nothing of itself, having no separate existence, is empty and is truth...

So it is not out of character for ewk to proclaim that the Dharmakaya belongs to Buddhist doctrine, ergo, it is not Zen! But this term appears in much of Zen literature. Here is Linji speaking Buddhist doctrine and very profoundly I might add:   “The pure light in a single thought of yours—this is the dharmakāya buddha within your own house. The nondiscriminating light in a single thought of yours—this is the sambhogakāya buddha within your own house. The nondifferentiating light in a single thought of yours—this is the nirmānakāya buddha within your own house. This threefold body is you, listening to my discourse right now before my very eyes. It is precisely because you don’t run around seeking outside that you have such meritori- ous activities."" (Emphasis is mine.)   The Dharmakāya which is unconditioned, is the true body of the Buddha which is beyond conditionality.   Sasaki notes:   The dharmakāya is buddha viewed as truth itself, and as such is the essence of wisdom and purity. Linji is referring to this latter attribute when he characterizes the light of the mind in its first manifestation as(Skr., pariśuddha), that is, pure and free from any defilement. The dharmakāya is symbolically represented by Vairocana Buddha."

zen,3bcqsn,pointingatthebye,2,Sun Jun 28 01:01:41 2015 UTC,"""Moment"" is a flawed concept. There's absolutely no way to experience the ""moment"", the same as there is no way to experience the ""present"". Everything that's within perception is just endlessly echoed knowledge under various pretenses of time and space, and that time and space is itself echoed knowledge.

zen,3bcqsn,love0_-all,2,Sun Jun 28 22:42:30 2015 UTC,"Like most concepts, the construct of time is a useful illusion. If we look at the conventional time the best we can say is that we re only experiencing the past, not the actual present. Again, not real useful to make that distinction in day to day life.  I recently went to /r/asksciencediscussion and asked what scientists were learning about time. I got some very interesting answers, and really need to study it before I can say I understand it, if ever.  But I think what /u/pointingatthebye is saying here is that our entire concept of time, moment, and present is informed by our perceptions and experiences. We are not capable of experiencing time as it really exists, so we color it with our beliefs and desires. One of those being the concept of linear. Once we do this, we are no longer viewing reality, we are viewing our perceptions laid down on that reality."

Things are placed haphazardly in time based on rough guesses, and the entire idea of the present is constructed once the moment has already gone by. Considering this idea of time to be the reality is deceptive at most, yet our being relies on its reality for so much. Why? That's a good question to ask."

On one level, I very much respect the ""nothing to attain"" line of answers- the Heart Sutra is very near the center of my practice. But on the level of what actually happens in the community life of the zendo, it looks to me like sitting zazen and the other activities of zendo life are de facto very much about attaining kensho.  And on that level, why bother? Why not stay home and play a video game? To me, the Great Matter is compassion, so if zazen and kensho don't result in greater compassion, and recent evidence from the many scandals in Zen and in Buddhism in general suggest it doesn't, then why bother?"

zen,3bcqsn,monkeyswithmirrors,2,Sun Jun 28 03:50:34 2015 UTC,"I practice living, because after doing some long, painful thinking about life and death, physics, consciousness, god, free will, and whatever else was plaguing me for years, I came to think that a human life is a cog made of cogs in an infinitely complex cog-machine that has always existed and always will and I like it and would like to make it more beautiful as I go along.  And that, I think, is the ultimate nature of the cogs/cog-machine. That's just what we're all doing, what everything is doing (with a touch of chaos), regardless of how ""aware"" any of this is at any given moment. A cog doesn't need to be aware of the fact that it's a cog made of cogs to function. It functions anyway.   Although, if the cog/cogs become self-aware, that gives them the opportunity to manipulate themselves into acting in greater accordance with the ""infinite whole machine"". So that's nice.   But there is no beginning or end to self-awareness/enlightenment.  And that's because a ""cog"" is only a somewhat-imaginary, somewhat-inaccurate description of the machine-process.  Whatever a ""cog"" is aware of (a banana, a star, itself) is part of the machine.  Whatever you're aware of, in some sense, is your ""self"", because there really is no discrete ""self"" to be aware of. Everything is inter-dependently operating together.  So even if I'm aware of a banana, that is me being aware of my true nature.   If I'm aware of anger leading me to be about to murder someone, that's also me being aware of my true nature.   If I'm just aware of a single speck of blue light. Just ""Blue"", that's me being aware of my true nature.  So no matter how aware I am (how much or how deep), or how ""expedient"" my methods, it's just one point on a line going on forever. There's always a bigger and shinier fish.  Thanks for the question though. Haven't really thought about it as cogs-in-cogs-in-cogs-etc. before. Not sure why I answered off-the-cuff this way.   I could probably give a better explanation if I went back and re-wrote it to make sense but... I'm tired and tipsy and I should get some sleep."

However, your dissertation on awareness is lost on me.

You have to seek, be dissatisfied, and suffer. Saying that you don't want to learn to be enlightened, you don't expect an answer, is just seeking the same using a different method. ""Maybe I'll try not doing anything, seeing as doing something hasn't worked out!"""

I could be thinking about nothing, or maybe potatoes, my experience of blue is pretty similar either way.   I often don't get straight answers about stuff like that on /r/zen/. Often I'll get commands or ""teaching"" like   investigating why you think these dual terms are real will rid you of the need to ask questions in terms of them - saving you a lot of anxiety.

See, in that emphasis, it says that if you're less concerned about these ""other people"" and what they're saying, judging them for their ideas, etc - that you can just live your life.   But it seems that you've got a great deal of notions about how other people think and what they're saying, and it seems as though that changes the way you think for yourself... In that case, you might want to seek enlightenment.   But again, if you listen to me, you don't know how to follow only your own advice.   It's a catch-22 really. You only need it if you need it. If you don't you don't. How can you tell if you need it or not? Probably something to do with those pesky ""Other people"".  I prefer my tuna raw."

It's ours to realize or to ignore (most choose the latter). If you elect to realize it look deep within. Remember the story in the Lotus Sutra:   The Concealed Gem (chapter 8)  A poor man visits a rich friend, gets drunk, and passes out. The rich man, who has to leave on business, gives his poor man a priceless gem, which he sews into the lining of his friend's clothes. When the poor man comes to, he resumes his life as a vagrant, unaware of the treasure he received during his blackout. Later, he meets the rich man again, who shows him where the gem is concealed, and the poor man realizes his wealth. In the story, the rich man is the Buddha; the poor man is a sattva, drunk with the passions; and the jewel is the truth about the Buddha Nature."

There was one part that you missed... What about people who don't live in the world of Big big, little little?  I like this story...    When Maharajji came out you never knew what to expect. He could do the same thing a week in a row until you’d think, “Well, he’ll come out at 8:00.” Then he might not come out all day, or he might just go into another room and close the door and be in there for two days. You had to learn to expect the unexpected. One day he came out and all he said all day long was “Thul-Thul, Nan-Nan,” repeating these words to himself like a mantra. Days went by like this and somebody finally said, “Maharajji, what are you saying?” And it turned out to be an old Behari dialect and all it meant was “Too big, too big, too little, too little.” When he was finally asked why he was saying this, he said, “Oh, all you people, you all live in Thul-Thul, Nan-Nan; you live in the world of judgement. It’s always too big or too little.”"

Any wave-differentiation, however your mind perceives or experience it, has nothing to do with the absolute nature of said mind, much less its absolute reality [dharmakaya].
