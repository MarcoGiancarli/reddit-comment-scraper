He is primarily an enemy of Spider-Man and a member of organized crime who exists in Marvel's main shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe.  He is closely associated with the Hammerhead ""Family"", a Maggia crime family. Hammerhead distinguishes himself from other villains in that he dresses up and acts somewhat like a gangster from the 1920s. Due to an injury he suffered, much of his skull was replaced with an unbendable steel alloy by Jonas Harrow, giving his head a flattened shape.

Fiveheads,32f89x,fartsinscubasuit,2,Mon Apr 13 21:12:29 2015 UTC,"Does that tattoo say ""smelly""?"
Fiveheads,32f89x,gokart-mozart,2,Mon Apr 13 20:53:19 2015 UTC,Close but I only see one L. But I wouldn't be surprised if this mess didn't do to well in spelling bees as a child.
