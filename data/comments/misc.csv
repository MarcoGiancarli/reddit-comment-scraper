The similarities really end there, and to compare the two in that way fosters a false narrative and a false equivalency that is dangerous for the country.  trump is a joke candidate who utilizes red meat vitriol to manipulate xenophobic fucktards into voting for him.  Bernie Sanders is a serious intellectual statesman who is tapping into disgust with income inequality and a rigged financial system.  it is a tactic by cnn to make sanders appear more interesting to idiots.  cnn loves trump for the views he gets them.  sanders does not spout crazy bullshit, but if they can foster a narrative that he says crazy shit then maybe more people will pay attention.  its fucking obscene and bad for democracy."

Sanders, on the other hand, is a socialist bozo who uses the promise of free money to get delusional bleeding heart liberals to put him in office so he can write checks this country can't cash.""

misc,3dxzai,UFGarvin,4,Mon Jul 20 20:54:24 2015 UTC,"I totally agree my biases inform my opinion. However, I think Trump has an objective history of insincerity for the sake of political gain.  I.e. his birther comments from a few years ago.  The prevailing wisdom across the GOP as well is Trump is appealing to what John Mccain called the ""crazies.""  There are many legitimate criticisms of Bernie Sanders, but I doubt anyone is accusing him of insincerity. This is another reason Rand Paul would be the better comparison.  I think when it comes to character/temperament Trump and Sanders are polar opposites.  I also truly believe the reason CNN is doing this directly stems from a desire to increase ratings."

Rather than transporting and slaughtering these hens for one pound of “meat,” the industry is shifting to on-site “disposal.” Current methods of “disposal” include killing hens with CO2 and composting their bodies, breaking their necks (known as cervical dislocation) or grinding them alive (known as maceration). [7,8] In some cases, hens in the compost piles are still alive, and struggle to free themselves.  Some industrial animal factories force the hens to endure one last round of heavy egg laying before they are discarded. In a process known as “forced molting,” all food is withdrawn for approximately 14 days. The resulting stress causes the birds to lose nearly all their feathers, which stimulates a brief, prolific egg laying period. The newest form of forced molting utilizes nutrient-deficient filler foods rather than starvation.  While the females suffer for many months in these factories, the male chicks have a more brief but equally disturbing fate. Unable to lay eggs, and the wrong breed for the meat industry, the one-day-old male chicks are killed immediately at the hatchery. Every year in the United States, 200 million male chicks are either ground up alive and made into fertilizer, or dumped into large garbage bins and left to suffocate.  These tragic conditions are real, and they occur every day in industrial animal factories across the country. The industry’s standard practices show no regard for the animals’ mental or physical health. Like all other industrially farmed birds, hens are not protected by the Animal Welfare Act or the federal Humane Slaughter Act."""

It seemed  to me like Fletcher started out as a good guy that got embittered by the treatment he received, eventually choosing to ""cheat"". His whole background reads like that of a good villain with motivations that are very understandable that really paints everyone involved in a poor light.  Nothing about Pao's case seems clear-cut. Honestly, while the court findings make Kleiner Perkins not guilty, that merely shows that there is not enough evidence to show them guilty beyond reasonable doubt, and they are a very powerful firm. Some of the  documented  facts are extremely creepy(e.g. the gift of ""The book of longing"" from her superior), and portrayals of known facts are very different depending on the angle you view them from. Most of the pertinent facts of the case come down to he says/she says, and I think both sides of accounts are exaggerated for the expediency of pro/anti camps(e.g. ""feminists"" exaggerating the creepiness of acts or making mountains out of molehills, while on the other hand apologists are trying to turn major indiscretions into ""innocent"" mistakes that were misunderstood). In the end I think that there is a bit of truth to either side, that there certainly was some wrongdoing from partners at Kleiner Perkins, though whether it was systematic or not is not clear. The narrative was skillfully controlled and they did a very good job of maintaining appearances.  In the process I've pretty much gone from anti-Pao to feeling bad for what happened to her. She strikes me as a person who is not very good at corporate politics/spin and is actually quite idealistic, believing that others will see the truth. Her husbands case isn't so clear. Even though he may have been wronged that doesn't justify the defrauding of others.  Someone the other day posted this oldish article in an attempt to discredit Pao/Fletcher but funnily enough it actually made me more sympathetic for both of them(though I believe Fletcher was absolutely wrong to do what he did and should see prison time for the fraud) www.vanityfair.com/style/scandal/2013/03/buddy-fletcher-ellen-pao It's long, but it's worth the read if you want to better understand the people, while maintaining a non-judgemental tone."
misc,3dkgyz,creepy_doll,2,Fri Jul 17 04:33:02 2015 UTC,"that her husband definitely had a hard time due to the colour of his skin. It seemed to me like Fletcher started out as a good guy that got embittered by the treatment he received, eventually choosing to ""cheat""   I got the impression that he externalized all of his failures to ""racism"" and completely refused to take any responsibility whatsoever for his personal shortcomings.  A trait that he found in spades in Ellen.  Those two are a perfect match."
misc,3dkgyz,CuilRunnings,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"Did you actually read the article? Fletcher was very successful but he had to create a lavish lifestyle so that others would take him seriously. The picture that the article painted of both of them was fairly intense/low-key people. And quite frankly, at least from Ellen's part, her visible behavior on reddit has been that. Kleiner Perkins has a strong vested interest to portray otherwise, but theirs is the only story I've seen that portrays her in such a way.  Like I said, we don't know the whole story, but looking for it from Kleiner Perkins is definitely not the right place"

That generation is lost if they think hearing things they don't like is justification for silencing the speakers.   Well, I don't know how old are you, but the things you read on the internet are much more cruel than that you hear IRL. It's not surprising that people only troll anonymously, since being an asshole is usually not tolerated by society.The armchair warriors who harass others for having a different opinion or because of their race/gender are totally aware how unacceptable their behavior is (that's why they only do it on the internet), yet still feel that it's their ""right"". They don't seem understand that internet is part of our culture, it's part of real life and have the same consequences (or even more dire - it's much easier to totally destroy someone's life than it was before the internet). If anything, this will be that generation's doom, not that normal people still don't tolerate others advertising they want to punch, kill or rape them (as they never have).  This whole thing is beyond pathetic, and very educational, that even after being proven wrong (It was not Pao who fired Victora, it was the board who wanted wide bans of shitty subreddits and she actually resisted as much as she could, the forced relocation was the former CEO's doing, etc) many people still fight to continue their crusade.  Can you imagine saying to a friend of yours (or your mother) that ""I can't make fun of fat people anymore on the site that I frequent, and don't agree that the CEO banned salary negotiations, so I submitted her photo to r/punchablefaces, made some rape jokes, and signed a petition to remove her from the company.

How can a person from such a ""humble"" lifestyle come across as such an elitist douchebag? Every scrap of gossip (let's be fair, that's exactly what it is) was vomited carelessly onto the page without a second thought, as if the general populace might somehow be shocked that a rich family might have the same skeletons that any average household might keep tucked away in their closets.  The article is clearly written from a ""low-income perspective"", but with every self effacing paragraph, it becomes more and more evident that the writer believes she is somehow better than the people whose lives and personal belongings she's rummaging through with no regard for privacy or common decency. In reality, you could find similar examples of ""household secrets"" in any household, regardless of a family's wealth or a home's square footage.  The fact that this writer believes herself to be some type of holier-than-thou whistleblower is sheer lunacy. What gives a housekeeper the right to preach about bad habits when the very information provided was attained by illegally rifling through private documents and personal property? In my opinion, this is disgusting behavior and the implication that readers would somehow benefit from these mundane revelations is quite disturbing.  tl;dr  We get it.

Take off the kkk-goggles for a second and you'll see that  the black person has been drawn deliberately smaller with an non-aggressive stature to contrast the image of him in the mind of the officer.  The visual cue contrasts the officer's bias.  The officer, on the other hand, is tall and with more aggressive posturing, leaning over the black character.  In this case, the visual cue justifies the black character's bias.  As I said earlier, considering the cartoon in detail makes it clear that if favors the black character over the officer.  The officer is white because it sets up a left/right color contrast and it provides a clean visual cue with no contradictory information.  It becomes intuitive to the reader that    The imaginary person is the officer. The imaginary person is a racist.   If the officer wasn't white, or if the symbolism was subtler, it would make those connections less intuitive."

I find it unfair to make that comparison, and it's an intentionally slanderous comparison, to go back to your first comment:   The officer's perspective validates the black guy's perspective, but the reverse isn't true.

Having, racist biases is very different than being the clearly violent, white supremacist that the black guy sees him as.   Yeah, but the perception is still one-sided.  The difference between a bigot with intent and method to persecute somebody and a bigot actively doing so is like the difference between threatening somebody with a gun and actually shooting them.

The fact that the shotgun is in the picture clearly shows that the black guy views the cop as out to hurt him. When most people envision a cop, it isn't typically with a shotgun. The cop might be carrying a gun (although it certainly isn't a shotgun!) but you should note that the artist didn't include it in the picture, possibly because the officer doesn't plan to hurt him. If the artist wanted to clearly indicate that the black guy saw the cop as only a racist, with no harmful intent, it would probably have been as simple as removing the shotgun.   The difference between a bigot with intent and method to persecute somebody and a bigot actively doing so is like the difference between threatening somebody with a gun and actually shooting them.   Perhaps you're right but there is no reason to assume that the cop has an intent to persecute. The cop does have racist biases and he is definitely mistrusting of the black guy. However, that is different than actively going out of his way to persecute. It's possible that the cop is but there is nothing in the comic to suggest that. If the cop did want to cause trouble, it would have been as simple for the artist as including his pistol (as I said before)."
misc,3cs48j,Zangin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"He does have harmful intent.  He wants to arrest an innocent man because he thinks that man is a criminal and arresting criminals is his job.  Despite your insistence that guns are scary, we don't know the degree of fear and loathing possessed by the black character because his thoughts are represented by a visual metaphor.    What we do know is that racism is defined by bias, and thuggery is defined by behavior.   The cartoon indicates bias, but has visual cues that imply an absence of thuggery.  Therefore it seems that the black character is right about the officer being racist, but the officer is wrong about the black character being a thug.  Of course, we could interpret ""thug"" to be an overly heavy handed metaphor for ""person who doesn't trust the police"" because why not.  Even then, If we assume that the characters are equally biased and equally wrong about it, there is still inequality.  One character has a authority (and a duty) to actively pursue his misconception, and the other does not.  The officer imposes his bias on the citizen because it's his job to get involved with the citizen's business.  The reverse is not true."
misc,3cs48j,DoesNotTalkMuch,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:48:35 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that he is not a thug, but in the same way I agree that the cop isn't a member of the KKK.   He wants to arrest an innocent man because he thinks that man is a criminal and arresting criminals is his job.   I think this is our main disagreement. There are no visual cues to suggest that the cop intends to arrest the black guy (no gun, no handcuffs, nothing). I think you are misinterpreting the cartoon by assuming that the cop intends to arrest the black man. Rather, I view it as them just passing on the street and how, after seeing the other, they immediately let their biases take over. That is, the cop sees a black guy and just thinks ""thug"" and the black guy sees the cop and just thinks ""white supremacist"". This is the point of the cartoon."
misc,3cs48j,Zangin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:56:59 2015 UTC,"If the officer doesn't literally believe that the man is a criminal, then you can't fairly compare that to the man literally believing the officer is an aggressive member of the KKK.  And as I said, racism is an attitude (which is being demonstrated) but thuggery is a behavior (which is not)  While the point of the cartoon may be to compare misconceptions and prejudices, it definitely favors the perspective of the black guy."
misc,3cs48j,DoesNotTalkMuch,3,Sat Jul 11 03:22:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe it shouldn't, but it bothers me that the physical setup of the cartoon doesn't reflect the message.  That is to say, everyone except the black guy sees the officer as a KKK member - the black guy is the one person who can't physically see the reflection in his own glasses. Likewise, the ""thug"" reflected in the cop's glasses can be seen by everyone except the cop.  I know, I know - it's a metaphor, and they're not reflections but representations of what each one ""sees"", and I think it's a valid message, but all the same."
misc,3cs48j,Logofascinated,6,Fri Jul 10 15:27:41 2015 UTC,"Even if you take a ""reflection in their eyes"" visual metaphor literally, that's not how reflections work.  The reflected image on a glass surface is the same as what the person on the other side is seeing when they look through it.  The glasses are reflecting what the characters see because some of the light is reflecting off, and some is entering their eyes.  The only inconsistency is that the number chart and thug caption were written backwards.  The caption is understandable on account of his thug education but you'd expect the numbers to be professionally done."

misc,3ck290,shoziku,2,Thu Jul 9 02:48:54 2015 UTC,"I don't see why the drug of choice is relevant.  If it's true, then he plotted and acted to impair a woman's cognitive abilities in order to be able to have sex with her.  I'd say it's a safe assumption he either didn't believe she'd consent or he didn't care to find out.  In my mind, it's no different than getting a woman drunk to the same end and it's completely different from two people choosing to take drugs or get drunk and then sleeping together.  One is maybe combined poor judgement, the other is predatory."
misc,3ck290,eternallylearning,0,Thu Jul 9 02:59:36 2015 UTC,"I see it as a little relevant.  Previously I was thinking date rape drug or sodium pentothol.

misc,3ck290,shoziku,2,Thu Jul 9 03:15:27 2015 UTC,"I still don't see the difference based on the tool used to make a woman not resist other than one not having any excuse to own or use, and one possibly being justifiable given certain circumstances.  Perhaps you are seeing it as a sign that maybe the case against him is not so much of a slam dunk as if he had bought and used roofies, and I guess I can't disagree, but the way I see it there is not a lot of evidence either way at this point beyond hearsay.  If he is guilty of acting in a predatory manner in order to sexually assault women, then I don't believe the tools used to incapacitate them are relevant to his level of guilt.  Overall, I'm inclined to believe that something went down with at least some of the women.  It'd be one thing if like in the Michael Jackson case, one person brought forward a law suit and suddenly all these other people come out of the woodwork with their own accusations in the pursuit of money, but it sounds like the accusations against Cosby have come out one at a time over decades and with very little attempt to get money from him.

misc,3chrhp,manyfacedgod2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:28:57 2015 UTC,"“Retribution is a valid societal interest,” Mr. Cox said on a recent afternoon, in a manner as calm and considered as the hypothetical he would propose was macabre. “What kind of society would say that it’s O.K. to kill babies and eat them, and in fact we can have parties where we kill them and eat them, and you’re not going to forfeit your life for that? If you’ve gotten to that point, you’re no longer a society.”   ""If you don't support the death penalty, you're okay with killing babies and eating them.""  - Actual Lousiana Prosecutor Dale Cox  Also, according to the New Yorker, he found the parts of the Bible where Jesus was ""judgmental and unforgiving"" and used that to justify his support of the death penalty. Who'da thunk it?   Cox, who is Catholic and went to a Jesuit school, was opposed to the death penalty at the start of his career, and in 1983, after working in the district attorney’s office for six years, he left, because he didn’t feel comfortable pursuing capital cases. He believed that it was God’s decision when to end someone’s life. He joined a civil firm while working part time as a special prosecutor. By 2011, when he returned to the office full time, he said that his thinking had evolved. After constant exposure to violence, he began to reinterpret the Bible. He thought about passages in which Christ was judgmental and unforgiving—Christ’s belief that it would be better if Judas Iscariot had never been born, for instance—and saw Him as retaliatory in ways that he hadn’t appreciated before. After the Church’s pedophilia scandals, Cox no longer felt obliged to follow its teachings precisely. He told me that “we just exclusively use the Old Testament over here,” and that he had ripped the New Testament out of all the Bibles. He quickly added, “That’s a joke!”"

In the end, it becomes a question of taking away ones person's freedom to guarantee another persons freedom. More specifically, the reason these laws were passed was because in some areas, particularly the south, every hotel/store/restaurant/business in a town would refuse to sell to or employ blacks.  Because of this, no black person could earn a wage or buy the goods and services they needed.  These cities couldn't bar black people from living there, but they could make them feel so unwelcome that they effectively were unable to live there.  As other posters have said, these laws were expanded over the decades to more protected classes.     The TL;DR is this: If you start a business and open it to the public, you can't discriminate against someone based on protected criteria, because the legislature and the courts have determined that those classes need protection to become and remain full participants in our society."

Bit of real world: People are happy to wave their hands in the air and say 'oh man, that's BULLSHIT someone should do something', but they'll very, very, very rarely change their actual habits. For a lot of folks, the internet, as vast as it is, becomes reddit/facebook and a handful of other sites. That's it. They sit at a PC, open chrome/whatever and immediately open reddit out of habit. That shit lasts.  Now, let's also remember voat is apparently the project of someone who's a student, and any massive upswell in traffic is likely to lead to all the same traffic based clusterfuck problems that any site goes through during huge size booms. Short answer: No.  This isn't even remembering the fact that most of the 'omg going to voat' bullshit is coming from the people who were outraged over the banning of the fat people hate subreddit - ie: people you don't want to spend time with anyway.   So, now we have:   People don't know People don't care People have habits of coming here and they won't bother to break them Voat will prob. fold as fast as shit if it actually gets significant influx People defecting to voat are likely to be fuckheads you don't like anyway   ... so no, I really don't see 'omg reddit is dead soon'"

Hell, even the USSR wasn't exactly willing to get involved until it got to the point where if they didn't attack first, Germany would.   If that is the best you can do you have failed.   Considering it was the first result of a five-second Google search, it wasn't exactly ""the best I could do"". My point was that white people can riot over some pretty stupid shit, too.

I ended up editing ""continental Europe"" in there before you posted because I realized that using Canada and Mexico as examples of major powers wasn't a very good thing to do.

Treaties are the highest law of the land akin to amendments.  the people have the right to know what our government is doing.  we are a republic, sure, cause the people can be idiots but mainly to protect minority rigths.. but also cause people would vote for services and vote against the taxes to pay for them and shit,. BUT  we have the right to be informed, and the right to lobby our reps on how they should vote and that if they dont vote our way, there could be consequences. It doesnt matter if we are actually in the wrong.   and if we cna see some of the more crazy healthcare and budget ideas.. why the fuck cant we see this? that scares me more too.  like rand paul proposes flat tax.. thats insane, would explode the deficit, we would need massive cuts and would shift the burden to the lower classes...and now I know about it, i can tell my rep hell fucking no. or for the right, the proposals to legalize those brought here as children.. who have not commited any crime since.. yall have the rigth to say ""hey vote fuckign no""  but with the tpp, they arent telling us shit."

I'm not saying it's a conspiracy' I'm saying it's a social issue that they'd even upload pictures of their family members as a sexualized content without their consent- and it's so common that Google results even show it.  Edit: Searching 남동생, 오빠 (little/older brother) shows results that are much different in the purpose of the content. Again, not a conspiracy because I doubt anyone planned to do this - it's a social issue."
misc,3b1zlt,j4p4n,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:37:43 2015 UTC,"Well. You clearly don't speak Korean as well as you say you do. When over there, I hear younger people refer to older people that they aren't related to by titles such as 누나 and 오빠 all the time. It's life in Korea dude. You might speak it, but you've never been there I guess?"
misc,3b1zlt,j4p4n,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:41:34 2015 UTC,"I never said 누나 and 오빠 was specifically referring to family members. I AM Korean.. I was born there. I said 사촌누나 and 사촌동생 is referred to the family members. And the point in my comment is not the word itself, is the content that is uploaded under those words.  If you read individual image sources from this search results, most of them are pictures of family members secretly taken by their older brothers and younger brothers. I thought it wouldn't be too hard to get this point across, but obviously you didn't notice that the pictures are taken in secret with a sexual purpose and deliberate distribution across the internet.  The original picture I uploaded are also mostly pictures of women's back, legs and butts, not their faces - which means it was taken without their consent. That was what I was trying to get at, not that 누나 and 오빠 is referring to people of certain age brackets."
misc,3b1zlt,j4p4n,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:16:26 2015 UTC,"Being born in Korea and understanding the terms you typed enough to understand the cultural-linguistic definitions are a different thing. You are either intentionally trying to mislead people or you don't understand what you are typing. English doesn't refer to younger sisters (for example) in a sense that automatically gives a mental image of a category of person in the same way that many Asian languages do. For example, in Japanese if you search younger sister you get quite a bit of sexual search results, just like in Korean. It's a cultural/linguistics thing. I hope you will be brave enough to admit you didn't understand the background of the words you were typing or were just trying to mislead people for karma or something. Cheers"
misc,3b1zlt,j4p4n,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:39:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're so eager to prove me wrong, man.  So Japan also gives similar results. That doesn't prove anything but Japan AND Korea both have a similar sense of how they think of little sisters. If it's a culture to post 'I GOT THE PICTURE OF MY LITTLE SISTER'S BUTT FOR ALL OF YOU TO FAP ON' and that culture is quite big and people who does it have no sense of guilt doing it .. I think there's something wrong there.  If I wanted Karma then I would've posted on a bigger subreddit. I lived in Korea for quite some time and I can say I understand the culture quite well.  I don't know why you're so caught up on petty difference between words to prove me wrong when I clearly stated my point and what I was trying to get at. If you know Korean so well, read the contents that those pictures were in and see that they're obviously referring to their family members.  I hope you're brave enough to understand that you were avoiding everything else I've been saying to just say, ""The words like little sister could possibly mean sexual themes, therefore your point is not valid"""
misc,3b1zlt,j4p4n,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:51:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm. So I guess it's an English understanding problem then? It's not weird in Asian languages to refer to an unknown girl as ""younger sister"". Yeah, it's perverted, and yeah, some of those hits are actually people posting their own real younger sister (but I can find hits like that in English if I wanted to, yuck) which is gross, but often those hits are just fetish sites playing on the linguistic/cultural thing that you seem to not be understanding."

They first targeted South Carolina, which passed an article of secession in December 1860. Wigfall, for one, actively encouraged an attack on Fort Sumter to prompt Virginia and other upper Southern States to secede as well. The Fire-Eaters helped to unleash a chain reaction that eventually led to the formation of the Confederate States of America and to the American Civil War. Their influence waned quickly after the start of major fighting.   625,000 dead. Great job"

It was considered by many to be a protest against school desegregation. It was also raised at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) during protests against integration of schools.  Supporters of the flag's continued usage view it as a symbol of Southern ancestry and heritage as well as representing a distinct and independent cultural tradition of the Southern United States from the rest of the country.
