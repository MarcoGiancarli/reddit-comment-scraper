communism101,3e68nf,TheHippieMuslim,3,Wed Jul 22 08:02:59 2015 UTC,My teacher based his claim on comparing China before and after neoliberalism. I had thought the fast industrialisation could be a counter point to his claim. Was it the USSR that had the fastest industrialisation?

I don't want to make another post tonight, and you seem to be very knowledgeable on the subject, so may I ask: what is abstract labor?

communism101,3e4wri,jakehmw,5,Tue Jul 21 23:56:49 2015 UTC,"To resume, then: In the use value of each commodity there is contained useful labour, i.e., productive activity of a definite kind and exercised with a definite aim. Use values cannot confront each other as commodities, unless the useful labour embodied in them is qualitatively different in each of them.    Different commodities require different kinds of concrete labor for their production. Producing hats requires one set of labors, producing refrigerators requires another. In general, the same kind of commodity does not confront itself as a commodity; the reason you trade your commodity is because you want a different commodity. Therefore, only qualitatively different kinds of concrete labor confront each other in commodities. If you and I perform exactly the same concrete labor (as well as anyone else in the production chain of which we are a part), then we end up with the same commodity and have no reason to trade.   In a community, the produce of which in general takes the form of commodities, i.e., in a community of commodity producers, this qualitative difference between the useful forms of labour that are carried on independently of individual producers, each on their own account, develops into a complex system, a social division of labour.   A community of commodity producers has different people performing different kinds of concrete labor. This is a division of labor and it becomes more complex as commodity production develops."
communism101,3e4wri,MasCapital,6,Wed Jul 22 02:24:58 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, concrete labor is a synonym for useful labor. I say this so /u/jakehmw doesn't get confused by the change in terminology."

communism101,3e4wri,MasCapital,4,Wed Jul 22 03:58:35 2015 UTC,"In a capitalist mode of production, each producer privately owns their own commodities. The commodities carry with them the social labor that went into their production. So in the market, the social relations between the producer's private labors appear as material relations between people and social relations between things. This is an aspect of the fetishism of commodities, and Marx talks about it in section 4 of the very chapter you are reading. In a communist mode of production, our labors would be directly social, instead of indirectly social, as it is in a capitalist mode of production.  Edit: By the way, I'm currently studying Capital volume 1 and I am on chapter 8, so I imagine there could be more responses to this question than the one I gave and perhaps other more knowledgeable people can provide more detail."

communism101,3e3yig,m2fsamantha,4,Tue Jul 21 20:47:21 2015 UTC,"There'd be no reason to go back to capitalism as capitalism would be a less productive way of managing society.   Stalin, Dialectical and Historical Materialism   It is easy to understand how immensely important is the extension of the principles of the dialectical method to the study of social life and the history of society, and how immensely important is the application of these principles to the history of society and to the practical activities of the party of the proletariat.  If there are no isolated phenomena in the world, if all phenomena are interconnected and interdependent, then it is clear that every social system and every social movement in history must be evaluated not from the standpoint of ""eternal justice"" or some other preconceived idea, as is not infrequently done by historians, but from the standpoint of the conditions which gave rise to that system or that social movement and with which they are connected.  The slave system would be senseless, stupid and unnatural under modern conditions. But under the conditions of a disintegrating primitive communal system, the slave system is a quite understandable and natural phenomenon, since it represents an advance on the primitive communal system  The demand for a bourgeois-democratic republic when tsardom and bourgeois society existed, as, let us say, in Russia in 1905, was a quite understandable, proper and revolutionary demand; for at that time a bourgeois republic would have meant a step forward. But now, under the conditions of the U.S.S.R., the demand for a bourgeois-democratic republic would be a senseless and counterrevolutionary demand; for a bourgeois republic would be a  retrograde step compared with the Soviet republic.  Everything depends on the conditions, time and place.  It is clear that without such a historical approach to social phenomena, the existence and development of the science of history is impossible; for only such an approach saves the science of history from becoming a jumble of accidents and an agglomeration of most absurd mistakes.  Further, if the world is in a state of constant movement and development, if the dying away of the old and the upgrowth of the new is a law of development, then it is clear that there can be no ""immutable"" social systems, no ""eternal principles"" of private property and exploitation, no ""eternal ideas"" of the subjugation of the peasant to the landlord, of the worker to the capitalist.  Hence, the capitalist system can be replaced by the socialist system, just as at one time the feudal system was replaced by the capitalist system.  Hence, we must not base our orientation on the strata of society which are no longer developing, even though they at present constitute the predominant force, but on those strata which are developing and have a future before them, even though they at present do not constitute the predominant force."

communism101,3e1fx1,ccommunist,4,Tue Jul 21 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"Marx defined socialism as the transitory period between capitalism and communism. From Critique of the Gotha Program:   The question then arises: What transformation will the state undergo in communist society? In other words, what social functions will remain in existence there that are analogous to present state functions? Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.   Most communists agree that this period of socialism would incorporate social planning and owning of society's economy. Thats usually where communists disagree. ML types usually take the planning under the state, leftcoms want it in the hands of workers councils, ancoms want the complete abolition of the state and transfer of all power to councils/syndicates."

communism101,3duttz,StWd,4,Mon Jul 20 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"I found that link quite disturbing tbh. This especially:   Put simply, the sharpening competition among workers internationally more than offsets the ""benefits"" of imperialism for workers in the global North.   Of course I agree, the gains working class movements have made have been dismantled by neoliberalism but to imply that we aren't still benefiting massively from being part of the imperialist countries is actually disgusting. Even workers on minimum wage here have ridiculously better material conditions than those in the global South. Arguably many homeless people here are much better off than many of the workers in the global South.    It is not surprising that relatively well paid workers have been at the center of the most militant and radical workers' struggles of the last century. These workers tend to be concentrated in large, capital intensive workplaces that are often central to the capitalist economy. These workers have considerable social power when they act collectively. Strikes in these industries have a much greater impact on the economy than workers in smaller, less capital intensive workplaces (garment, office cleaning, etc.) Workers in capital intensive industries are also often the first targets of capitalist restructuring in periods of falling profits and sharpened competition.   I don't see how this undermines the idea of a labour aristocracy. The point is that due to their position in capital intensive workplaces central to the capitalist economy it means that the capitalist class are forced to concede to them certain provisions and make reforms that benefit them because they are so central to the network of profit flows- and they and the unions know this. They use their position to reform for themselves and raise their own wages but are not revolutionaries.   Maybe I am misunderstanding what the idea of the labour aristocracy is however?"

Bolsheviks, mensheviks, SRs and a bunch of other less socialist parties. So, the Bolsheviks had their powerbase amongst the industrial proletariat (workers in factories) This is obviously where the hammer comes from.  Unfortunately, you cannot win a revolution with only the support of the cities (paris commune anyone) So, to gain the support they needed to pull off a socialist revolution, they needed the support of the peasants (who worked the land) The SR's (social revolutionairies?) had their powerbase in the rural areas, (thus the sickle). They got that support by offering their supporters the land that the rich landowners had hoarded. This land distribution policy was wildly popular because, hell, why wouldn't you want land of your own? So the Bolsheviks and the SR's came together during the revolution to pull it off. So, industrial proletariat and the rural proletariat coming together forms the hammer and sickle."

If Sudoplatov is telling the truth, then the motivation was like this: during the civil war in Spain Trotsky actively interfered in the anti-fascist struggle and his interference was seen by Soviet leadership as a threat to the unity of communist forces (unity under its command of course). It was necessary to prevent something like this happening during the inevitable war with Nazis which was looming on USSR borders. Since Trotsky was the only significant figure in the whole Trotskyist movement, Stalin decided to assassinate him and thus destroy Trotskyism as real political force."

It was more about unity of the communist movement, which the Soviet Union had a great deal of control over.  I don't know whether you'd lay the actions at the feet of the state, the party, the politburo, or Stalin personally, but the foreign policy of the Soviet Union at the time was all about defending the Soviet Union at any cost.  They considered unity necessary because the activity of other parties in Europe was an essential part of their strategy.  On the one hand if they followed Comintern commands they would pressure their governments in ways beneficial to the Soviet Union (eg. during the collective security phase in the mid-30s they helped the Soviet Union gain concessions and treaties with European countries).  On the other hand, if they didn't follow Comintern commands it could damage the Soviet Union (eg. if European parties pushed for revolution during the mid-30s then countries like France and Britain would see the Soviet Union as more of a threat and be less inclined to support them against Germany)."

Communists believe in the idea of personal property, and are against private property. Personal property is property you personally use, while private property includes stuff you own, but don't use.

He lives in 2 First Street; that house is his personal property because he lives there. He rents out the other 4 houses. These other four houses are his private property because he is not using them for himself, so communists believe that he should not own these additional houses because he isn't using them.

While also having the benifit of a fair and non-stratifying society?   Depends on who you ask. I think that drugs are used for people to try to escape the problems caused by the capitalist system you live in. So under a communist system, people won't use drugs, not because it's against the law, but because they would feel no need to.  Does this help answer some questions you have?"

One can't really know exactly what they'll be addicted to until they do it.  Hence why many can try something like a hard ass drug and walk away from it and others can get addicted so something as eating unhealthy food.  Not saying that addiction is in all of us though.  One could lead a clean and sober life and never know they have the propensity for addiction in the first place.  But yes, you are right.

One is just water, and one is water laced with either heroin or cocaine. If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drugged water and almost always kill itself very quickly, right, within a couple of weeks. So there you go. It’s our theory of addiction. Bruce comes along in the ’70s and said, “Well, hang on a minute. We’re putting the rat in an empty cage. It’s got nothing to do. Let’s try this a little bit differently.” So Bruce built Rat Park, and Rat Park is like heaven for rats. Everything your rat about town could want, it’s got in Rat Park. It’s got lovely food. It’s got sex. It’s got loads of other rats to be friends with. It’s got loads of colored balls. Everything your rat could want. And they’ve got both the water bottles. They’ve got the drugged water and the normal water. But here’s the fascinating thing. In Rat Park, they don’t like the drugged water. They hardly use any of it. None of them ever overdose. None of them ever use in a way that looks like compulsion or addiction. There’s a really interesting human example I’ll tell you about in a minute, but what Bruce says is that shows that both the right-wing and left-wing theories of addiction are wrong. So the right-wing theory is it’s a moral failing, you’re a hedonist, you party too hard. The left-wing theory is it takes you over, your brain is hijacked. Bruce says it’s not your morality, it’s not your brain; it’s your cage. Addiction is largely an adaptation to your environment. We’ve created a society where significant numbers of our fellow citizens cannot bear to be present in their lives without being drugged, right? We’ve created a hyperconsumerist, hyperindividualist, isolated world that is, for a lot of people, much more like that first cage than it is like the bonded, connected cages that we need. The opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection. And our whole society, the engine of our society, is geared towards making us connect with things. If you are not a good consumer capitalist citizen, if you’re spending your time bonding with the people around you and not buying stuff—in fact, we are trained from a very young age to focus our hopes and our dreams and our ambitions on things we can buy and consume. And drug addiction is really a subset of that.""   Does Capitalism Drive Drug Addiction  Just thought this was relevant sort of maybe?"

communism101,3dj15o,PauliExcluded,5,Thu Jul 16 18:50:39 2015 UTC,"Well communism has often been led by dictators, no?   Ideology  Someone who is more versed in Communist history can explain this part to you in a more in-depth historical sense, I'll explain it to you in an ideological sense. In our current capitalistic system, Karl Marx described it as a ""dictatorship of the bourgeoisie"" (back before the rise of fascism and dictators, the term ""dictatorship"" could be replaced by ""government ruled by""), so in modern terms this could be rephrased as the ""government ruled by the rich/capitalists.""  In America, assuming that's where you live, the rich and Wall Street can use their money to buy politicians and influence elections to go the way that works best for the wealthy, while ignoring the majority of the country, the 99%, using modern terminology. This has our current system be a ""bourgeois democracy,"" a democracy that favors the rich.  The alternative system, proposed by Karl Marx, would be a ""dictatorship of the proletariat,"" so in modern terms this could be rephrased as the ""government ruled by the working class."" In a socialist system, it would be a ""pure democracy"" because the majority of people, the working class, the 99%, whatever you want to call them, would be in control of the state.  Obviously, the rich wants to stay in power, so they have the state (defined by Lenin as a tool for one class to oppress the other) use a police force and standing army to enforce their will on the general population. In a socialist country, the working class would use the state to oppress the rich and have the state and businesses run by the working class, so the majority is no longer being exploited or oppressed, just the previous oppressors are now being oppressed.  Eventually, as class divisions disappear, the state disappears too because it will have no more need to oppress a group of people. The state will turn into an administration of things, such as build roads, provide healthcare, etc and there will be no more standing army or police.  As this description shows, there has not been a communist state, and that phrasing makes little sense because a classless, stateless society (communism) cannot be a state.  Historical Dictators  Well, depending on who you ask, the USSR of Stalin was not a socialist state. Many Trotskyists (a branch of communism made by Leon Trotsky who opposed the Soviet Union of Stalin) will tell you that the USSR was a ""degenerated worker's state."" This essentially means it was no longer a ""dictatorship of the proletariat,"" but instead a ""dictatorship of the bureaucratic class."" In this idea the bureaucracy, starts to become their own class and favors themselves instead of the proletariat like they are suppose to represent. However, Marxist-Leninists (derogatorily referred to as Stalinists by many Trotskyists) believe that the USSR of Stalin was a socialist state and that Stalin did what he had to. I'm not too familiar with Marxism-Leninism, so hopefully one will come around to explain their view on whether or not Stalin was a ""dictator.""  But really, it depends on who you ask if certain socialist states are really socialist or not.     Can i still live by an individualistically libertarian lifestyle in communism?    My personal opinion  As long as you are not oppressing the proletariat, go right ahead. Capitalism would not be able to thrive under communism, because people would not want to sell their labor to a capitalist for less than it would be worth.  Disclaimer  I am new to Socialist and Communist thought.

The capitalist buys the workforce (not the work itself) and uses it to generate work, which is added to the value of whatever product the factory/company is making. The product is then sold and the capitalist gets (price of materials and maintenance)+(value generated by the worker's force), so, since the amount of labour in the materials and maintenance is constant, his profit, as well as the wages, must come from the value generated by the workforce.      Naturally, no money/value/labour will be wasted, so we can safely say that work=wage+profit."

Capitalism is always hungry though, which is the issue with coexistence. We saw this in the twentieth century, when the imperialist system tried at every turn to dismantle the world socialist system in order to expand into the cracks. A fully communist society lacks ""special bodies of armed persons"" because it is stateless, and thus couldn't protect itself. Communism is the result of a successful world socialist system."

communism101,3df8dx,jakehmw,3,Wed Jul 15 21:12:24 2015 UTC,"Socialism serves as the transition from capitalism to communism. Marx called this low and high communism, if I'm not mistaken.   The biggest Marxist critique of anarchism (in the sense of anarcho-communism and syndicalism) is that its roots are in idealism and that it skips to communism without going through socialism. Socialism is necessary (socialism in DotP-style) to protect the workers' interests from foreign intervention and allow for the material conditions that give rise to class-struggle to be eliminated.   Due to capitalism's imperialistic tendencies, communism, in its full sense, cannot coexist with capitalism as they are two entirely different economic systems. Communism seeks the end of the market whereas capitalism still has the market and, thus, has power over communism. It's socialism's goal to wipe out capitalism from the earth so that communism can come about.   TL;DR: You're right."

I think the masculinity of people of color, especially black and latino men, is actually more of a detriment than a privilege. Being seen as masculine is not always beneficial (for trans women as well, being seen as masculine can actually be threatening to their safety). Masculinity is used by white people to justify the deaths of black and latino men. Look at how Michael Brown was portrayed by the media. Hyper-masculinized terms such as 'demon,' 'thug,' etc. This use of masculinization by white women to demonize and justify the deaths of black people extends all the way to Jim Crow and beyond.  Basically, I think saying that men always benefit from being men is false since it fails to take into account the use of masculinity against poc and the coloniality of gender."

communism101,3ddu7y,Steelbolt,5,Wed Jul 15 14:31:54 2015 UTC,"Firstly, the 1% is not the best term. Bourgeois is a better one.  Secondly, unlike most conspiratorial theories, Marxism relies on a much more systemic view.    Let's look at the example of Bank A.  Mr. Jones, a straight white man who runs Bank A feels that in many cases black people in America cannot be trusted. However, he believes that some may, so he instead of pushing a clearly racist policy of discriminatory loans, so he delegates his job to the hundreds of Mr. Jones's below him. While a few might break the grain, the vast majority, following socially acceptable but heavily coded white supremacist attitudes, ingrained by economic segregation, social tropes, and a social super-ego aware of the violence done towards New Afrikans will give them higher loans. This combines with the other side which is based in historical racism such as open redlining and legally condoned segregation (as opposed to the very similar but ongoing, economic segregation) to ensure that there is little recourse for those trapped.  There is no cabal, no reptilians, no elders of Zion, or shadowy aliens- just the open and direct social oppinions and attitudes prevalent that combine with economic interests (pretty easily defined on class lines) to influence what choices Mr. Jones takes. And if Mr. Jones chooses, as well he may, to not do this, well his business will be affected- perhaps, profitability (in the short term) will drop, investors will leave to more successful, and probably more racist Mr. Jones to get that sweet sweet dollar high, and the system will continue, creating and created by millions of Joneses all free to do as the please, all subsumed under the social pressures that ensure they won't in large enough numbers.

communism101,3dcrrf,ccommunist,5,Wed Jul 15 06:44:42 2015 UTC,"My analysis is that the USSR was fundamentally socialist as a social formation right up until the end in 89-91. To best explain this, I need to provide a framework. First, it's important to note that social formations are not necessarily ""pure"", meaning that small pockets of other modes of production can exist along the one that is dominant in the final instance. Additionally, there are various definitions from various tendencies on state capitalism. I use the definition that state capitalism is the capitalist mode of production but with fundamental control of the means of production lying in the hands of the state. Since capitalism requires requires a multiplicity of capitals, and independent capitalists ultimately need control of capital, I would say that state capitalism can only play a subordinate role in a social formation, i.e. to serve capital or to serve socialism, instead of being a sustainable mode of production in its own right.  So, I would consider the NEP to be state capitalism serving the purpose of socialism. The USSR's state apparatus was fundamentally proletarian and thus protected the workers' interest in the last instance. So, while the NEP was state capitalism, it was ultimately for the purpose of forwarding socialism. Remember that history is not a linear march of progress, and at times the Dictatorship of the Proletariat has to make retreats and concessions (in this case to wealthy peasants).  Stalin ended the NEP, enacted five year plans for the economy, collectivized agriculture, etc. This made the formation closer to being ""pure"" socialism, so in a way Stalin did make the USSR more socialist. However, unlike most, I would say that Khruschev did not restore capitalism, nor did anyone else until the fall of the Soviet Union. Remember that individual leaders are ultimately subordinate to the character of the state and that a few market reforms and revisionist policies aren't sufficient to break the state. No fundamental change to the mode of production was made, the character of the state remained proletarian, and ownership remained public. For more on why the USSR remained socialist, I'd recommend reading Is the Red Flag Flying? by Albert Szymanski, as well as this essay and this article.  But, many other analyses exist. A Maoist or anti-revisionist would tell you that capitalism was restored with the rise of Khruschev and a new ruling class. I can’t seem to find the traditional sources on this, hopefully a comrade can help me out. A left communist would tell you that the state was always a ruling class, and that the USSR was state capitalist the entire time. You can find sources on that argument here. I hope comrades from these tendencies answer as well to give detail to their perspective, because there's plenty of work on this question from many traditions."

communism101,3dcrrf,cave_rat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:28:50 2015 UTC,"Being admittedly overly simple, state-capitalism is nationalization (or socialization or collectivization or whatever your favorite term is for ""de-marketization"" and planning) without democracy, and socialism is nationalization with democracy. (And democracy without nationalization is impotent.) (""State socialist"" isn't really a thing. I really only ever hear it used by anarchists to describe Marxists because we are socialists who understand the necessity of a proletarian state. Lenin uses it once here but he is referring exclusively to a kind of interference, namely interference by a socialist state, not to a form of society or mode of production or anything like that. ""State socialism"" is not a recurring concept in his or any other Marxist's work.)   I want to point out that Lenin, who wrote a lot about state capitalism, clearly saw this difference between state capitalism and socialism, noting that nationalization, planning, etc. does not equal socialism:   twenty-seven years ago Engels pointed out that to describe capitalism as something that ""is distinguished by its planlessness"" and to overlook the role played by the trusts was unsatisfactory. Engels remarked that ""when we come to the trust, then planlessness disappears"", though there is capitalism. This remark is all the more pertinent today, when we have a military state, when we have state monopoly capitalism. Planning does not make the worker less of a slave, but it enables the capitalist to make his profits ""according to plan"". Capitalism is now evolving directly into its higher, regulated, form.   So, nationalization and democracy are both necessary for socialism; if a country doesn't have one of those, it isn't socialist. So if you want to determine the whether and to what extent the USSR was socialist, you need a detailed investigation of its economy and the forms of workers' power. One such investigation is provided in the book Soviet Democracy. Of course there were many shortcomings and anarchists and leftcoms will emphasize those and neglect the great democratic gains in order to claim that the USSR was state capitalist."

communism101,3d4v35,SolidBlues,3,Mon Jul 13 17:25:21 2015 UTC,"""Capitalist"" is best thought of as a role that entails the ownership and control of productive capital, which is capital that can be put to the work of commodity production without a further change in ownership (""circulation"").  So a capitalist may or may not be a land-owner, depending on the circumstances. We would analyse land owned by a capitalist who built a farm on it as productive capital. However, we would analyze land owned by a rentier who rents it out to a capitalist farmer as capital which must be circulated, in this case through renting it, before it can be treated as productive."

Dialecticians don't see things as cause and effect but rather as interlocked parts to a complex system. But, the economic base is determinant in the last instance, which basically means that it is ultimately the economic structure that has dominance of influence on the superstructure. For reading I'd recommend Dialectical and Historical Materialism by Stalin, On Contradiction by Mao and On the Materialist Dialectic by Althusser."

communism101,3d2yaj,DeLaProle,3,Mon Jul 13 05:36:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the pic! So then how do 'counterculture thoughts' come to be? Like socialism and such if everything is circular?
communism101,3d2yaj,StWd,2,Mon Jul 13 06:01:11 2015 UTC,"Just because it seems circular doesn't mean it's a static process. If dialectics is anything it is change.    What you call counterculture thoughts are just as much a part of the process as the ruling ideology itself, or rather they are responses to the contradictions between each and both - that is as these contradictions become more pronounced so does the reaction and resistance to them. Hence Marx's famous quote ""What the Bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave diggers.""    Dialectical thought can be difficult to grasp at first because it can seem esoteric. I'm not a Trotskyist but I still think his The ABC of Materialist Dialectics is perhaps one of the best texts on dialectical materialism for beginners because of its length and simplicity."

While unlikely (for several reasons), members of the upper class can be proletariat. I guess it would also be possible for members of the lower class to be part of the bourgeoisie, but lower class implies that they do not have access to the capital necessary to join their ranks.  So essentially modern class ranks have nothing to do with the distinctions between proletariat, bourgeoisie, etc. What matter are their relations to the means of production.    Class Own MoP? Work on MoP?    Haute Bourgeoisie Yes No   Petite Bourgeoisie Yes Yes   Proletariat No Yes   Lumpenproletariat No No"

After that, freelance journalist would probably be either petty bourgeoisie or proletariat. Also worth mentioning, the haute bourgeoisie anarchoqueer mentioned is also extremely difficult to enter and extremely small section of society.   Scholars and writers tend to be petty bourgeois because their professions are fairly safe from technological innovation (can't yet replace teachers with robots and writers etc benefit from being creative and thus more useful to capital so it concedes them more benefits) and globalisation not being able to attack it yet (although perhaps the massive increase in ""distance learning"" etc will eventually mean capital can even outsource teaching labour). Due to their privilege from the benefits of their petty bourgeois status, these types are susceptible to falling for liberal propaganda such as ""the American dream"" and ""social mobility"" because they are at the level always rising and falling between proletarian and bourgeois status."

Owning property definitely makes you petty bourgeois.    the kind of workers you're describing tend to be among the most left-leaning people in the country   What state? You mean the US? I was just making a generalisation about the hyper-developed West and I agree they tend to be left-leaning, but they tend to be liberals. So still liberals. An example of a ""left-leaning"" mainstream paper here in the UK is the guardian, everyone thinks it's so progressive and it's just liberal crap with a bit of reformism. The ""Overton window"" here is quickly moving to the right with the rise of UKIP and the current ""centre-right"" government. I just hope we swing back left rather than continue further right after we survive the next few years of austerity measures.

Owning a house, e.g., does not make you bourgeois, petite or otherwise. It just makes you a house-owner.  I'm pushing back here because it's important that we don't let Marxian understandings of class collapse into Weberian ones. They are distinct conceptions of class that serve distinct conceptual functions. I'm not going to ""Zizek"" you but will be explicit: if Marxists want to say that class is one's exclusion or non-exclusion from the means of production, then we cannot also make the claim that different kinds of exclusion (which is where the Weberian sense of class makes its distinction between lower and middle class) also consitute class relations at the same level.  In other words, either you control the means of production or you don't. Scholars, writers, etc. do not, rather they sell their labor like other workers. That makes them proletarians.   I was just making a generalisation about the hyper-developed West and I agree they tend to be left-leaning, but they tend to be liberals.   Sure, I don't have a problem with that claim. But it's worth pointing out that most people in the West buy liberal socioeconomic narratives, not just these high-aged workers."

It just makes you a house-owner.   In today's society does the fact that you can rent out a house/room for enough that you wouldn't need to survive solely off your labour not elevate you to petty bourgeois status? I understand that it's not really a means of production, but it's a means of producing for yourself without having to sell yourself and have your labour exploited. Perhaps I just lump home-owners in with petty bourgeois because I don't see them as being helpful or useful to the lower classes that will drive revolution. Also, I don't mean the type of home-owners that have mortgages as there are way more owners than renters in the UK when you count them. The people who sell their labour and also rent are more of a revolutionary class imo."

If a person owns capital and uses that to extract surplus-labor from one or more other people, then that person is a member of the bourgeoisie.  The people who are selling their labor-power to the bourgeoisie, because they do not own the means of production, are the proletariat. The petite-bourgeoisie occupy a middle ground where they own the means of production (on a smaller scale than the big bourgeoisie), and sometimes they work in their own business. Because the petite-bourgeoisie are constantly being pushed into the proletariat they seek areas that suit them, which can include professorships and positions within the state that they are prepared for by the education that their parents have bought them."

communism101,3cxk08,PauliExcluded,12,Sat Jul 11 17:51:46 2015 UTC,"The notion that the labor theory of value says that the value of a commodity is the quantity of labor to produce it is a common misconception. What it actually says is that the value of a commodity is the socially necessary labor time to produce it. What this phrase refers to is the time it takes, under average work conditions, to produce a commodity. This is evident in reality; we see that capitalism is a system of competitive private firms that aim to produce commodities as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to out-compete rivals. If Mark takes a lot of time to produce the same commodity as Jill, Jill's commodity will sell better on the market because she produced it in less time, and therefore can sell it at a lower price than Mark.  Essentially, the value of a commodity, regardless of whether that commodity is a physical object, is the socially necessary labor time to produce that commodity."
communism101,3cxk08,StWd,3,Sat Jul 11 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"There is the Marxist solution of getting rid of value altogether and using the natural measure of labour- time. So forget all the notions of dollars and stuff and the idea that one worker works harder or something so deserves more pay, what matters is how much time you sacrificed to do labour. So one hour of time working as a teacher is equivalent, in terms of payment in labour vouchers, to one hour of working as a doctor. Now all the capitalists and reactionaries get going with their ""but whut about muh motivashun?!"" argument but there is plenty of scientific evidence that we are motivated more by social rewards rather than just monetary renumeration. I think that different professions would still be perceived as having more or less prestige and the people doing them considered more noble or whatever. This is more like the vision Marx himself had however some more reformist ideas which could still be sorta implemented in socialism would be having minimum/maximum income and limits on saving- plus with full price control, commodities costing the exact value of labour that was used to produce the item rather than the socially necessary minimum labour, there wouldn't be much point in saving."
communism101,3cxk08,xplkqlkcassia,2,Sun Jul 12 11:27:43 2015 UTC,"To add to hammer_and_sickle's answer, if you mean ""calculate the value of someone's labour"" (to be honest, this doesn't make much sense in a Marxist context) as in how much a teacher or doctor would receive for their services, in every case, across every profession, workers would receive one labour voucher per hour of work performed (may be adjusted slightly in accordance with economic conditions). With this labour voucher (after tax) they would be able to purchase goods and services whose embodied labour value totals to one hour.

communism101,3cwu7u,ccommunist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:56:38 2015 UTC,"Well I can sorta answer the second. From David Harvey's A Brief History of Neoliberalism (which I recommend you read in its entirety)   In December 1978, faced with the dual difficulties of political uncertainty in the wake of Mao’s death in 1976 and several years of economic stagnation, the Chinese leadership under Deng Xiaoping announced a programme of economic reform. We may never know for sure whether Deng was all along a secret ‘capitalist roader’ (as Mao had claimed during the Cultural Revolution) or whether the reforms were simply a desperate move to ensure China’s economic security and bolster its prestige in the face of the rising tide of capitalist development in the rest of East and SouthEast Asia. The reforms just happened to coincide––and it is very hard to consider this as anything other than a conjunctural accident of world-historical significance––with the turn to neoliberal solutions in Britain and the United States. The outcome in China has been the construction of a particular kind of market economy that increasingly incorporates neoliberal elements interdigitated with authoritarian centralized control. Elsewhere, as in Chile, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, the compatibility between authoritarianism and the capitalist market had already been clearly established.   So China, led by Deng Xiaoping, kinda just got swept up in the capitalist ideas of neoliberalism although we aren't completely sure what exactly caused Deng to adopt those policies."

Although these titles are a product of feudal society, modern-day nobility etc. don't actually own land from which they exploit serfs, so they aren't actually part of some sort of aristocracy. And you don't see them pushing for feudal policies to be enacted by the state. Social democracy, on the other hand is an attempt to improve conditions for the working class without the overthrow of capitalism. But until the bourgeois state apparatus is smashed and capitalists are expropriated, a social-democratic welfare state will still protect the interests of capital, in the final instance."

communism101,3cxpdk,UpholderOfThoughts,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:34:58 2015 UTC,"I imagine Lenin would have simply refered to hinself as a ""Marxist"" or ""communist"".  Leninism is mostly to do with organization and tactics, namely vanguardism and democratic centralism. It's more of an elaboration on Marxism than a formal ideology.  Marxism-Leninism, the official ideology of the USSR, was a formalized synthesis of Marxism and Leninism into a stable governing ideology. The term ""Marxism-Leninism"" was coined by Stalin, and thus Trotskyists of refer to it pejoratively as ""Stalinism"".  Marxism-Leninism-Maoism states that Khrushchev and subsequent Soviet leaders abandoned communism and the revolution by denouncing Stalin and practicing coexistence with capitalism. Mao, who broke with the USSR along these lines, is held up as the heir to the global revolution. Contributions to communist theory include guidelines for guerrilla struggle (People's War) and elaboration on democratic centralism (Mass Line).  Maoism usually refers to ""Mao Tse-Tung Thought"" which is more or less irrelevant today. ""Maoism"" is sometimes used interchangeably with MLM in some communist circles."

My reservations stem, of course, from the history of the Soviet Union and Mao and their not so nice approach to faith.    I am okay with separation of Church and State.  I'm okay with private faith, but my faith requires a coming together to receive what we believe is the body and blood of Christ and to confess our sins to a priest.  I guess I am misunderstanding what private faith means in this context.  Would it be absolutely NO Churches and you practice your faith alone in your home, to the extent that you can do so?

It would absolutely be a part of human activity in socialist (and communist) society.   The actual organization of the teams will vary widely depending on the culture; some might have ranked leagues, others might have conferences. Regardless, there wouldn't be individual owners for these teams. I would argue that teams should be owned by the community they represent and the workers that will work to keep. Franchise owners threaten to move all the time. Or refuse to build in certain cities. Saskatoon and Regina will probably never get an NHL team, because the league considers them too small for a profitable franchise to built there. They're probably right that they could make more money elsewhere, but that doesn't suck any less for hockey fans there.

communism101,3cqnvz,cave_rat,6,Fri Jul 10 16:44:31 2015 UTC,"Long version (sort of). Khrushchev was a young worker from Donbass, who after the revolution joined the Red Army and communist party. In 1923 he participated in the Trotskyist opposition but later switched sides and supported the line of Stalin ('majority of the CC', as it was called). In the late twenties, Kaganovich took notice of him and sent him to study at Industrial Academy in Moscow. Stalin's wife, Nadezhda Allilueyva, also studied there. Once he asked her about him, and she said that he was okay. Khrushchev at that time participated in the struggle against the Right opposition which was strong in Moscow. When Kaganovich was appointed to be the head of Moscow party organisation (de-facto he was in charge of the city as well), he took Khrushchev with him and he became a party secretary in Moscow. Later, when Kaganovich became people's commissar, Khrushchev was his successor as the head of the Moscow party organisation, and in the late thirties he returned to Ukraine as the first secretary of the Ukrainian communist party (so he was in charge of Ukraine now). During the war Khrushchev was elected in Politburo and started to work closely with Stalin. In Stalin's last years, he became one of his closest aids along with Beria and Malenkov. So, as you can see, Khrushchev rose to power thanks to Stalin himself and one of his closest supporters, Kaganovich. He was a product of that system."

communism101,3cp8hc,dk_alex,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:25:56 2015 UTC,"First thing to realize is that the term ""state"" is also used in two different ways by the two ideologies. Usually anarchists use the term to refer either to unjust hierarchies (e.g. the master-slave relation) or to minority rule in general. Marxists, on the other hand, use the term to refer to an organization of class domination. I.e. It refers to the institutions of force that are used to maintain a certain class and its interests as dominant in class society (e.g. the use of the police to protect private property rights; another example, the use of militias to protect workers control from foreign capitalists in a global class society). One of my favorite articles that explains the difference is Anarchy and Scientific Communism by Nikolai Bukharin. Anarchopac also has quite a good video.  With all of that said, to an anarchist, a dictatorship of the proletariat might refer to a literal dictatorship where a dictator represents the proletariat. For Marxists, a dictatorship of the proletariat instead refers to a society where the Proletariat and its interests (e.g. workers rights) are dominant and protected from the capitalist class by a worker's state (""state"" in the Marxist sense of the word).

communism101,3cqy09,Braver_Incident,7,Fri Jul 10 01:44:21 2015 UTC,"To begin to answer this, it helps to clarify what pornography is, and what function it serves:   One of the ways that the sexuality of male supremacy is institutionalised is through pornography. Robin Morgan has said, “Pornography is the theory, rape is the practice”. Pornography is the media of sexual objectification and violence against women. Its message is “a lie about women, that we exist to pleasure and service men and that our deepest pleasure lies in enslavement and subordination…” Pornography is different from other forms of sexual assault because it is “a collective representation of objectification and violence against women”. All women are victims of pornography; it attacks women as a group rather than as individuals.  As understanding of pornography is essential to an understanding of the construction and reproduction of gender inequality and how supremacy defines sexuality. Pornography legitimises forced sex; forced sex defines gender, and gender defines the status of women, which, clear, is far below that of men. The power of men over women – the power to own through higher wages, to rape through male oriented laws, and to objectify through pornography – this power means that force is inherant in sex. Forced sex defines woman, the same woman who must do the wash, raise the children, and engage in coitus with her husband. It’s the law.  Pornography is everywhere. It is not just the snuff films, it is not just Playboy. Pornography is the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue and it is commercials and movies and TV shows. Much of pornography is visible because it is accepted as normal. Women are defined in the multi-billion-a-year pornography industry as sexual objects, and a socially constructed definition of gender validated and protected by that much money is hard to destroy. The brutality and force used to create the image of degraded, subordinate women, who enjoy the violence done to them, however, remains conveniently invisible. And the idea that women might want to redefine the sexual valuation perpetuated by pornography is a direct economic threat to the men creating, marketing, and profiting from the exploitation and economic coercion of the women who participate in making it.  -- MIM Theory 2/3"

The power of capitalism is so ingrained in society, be it Brazilian, American or Australian, that getting any legitimate progress to socialism via election or referendum would be countered by capitalist influence and power. For example, how can you elect socialist individuals to office when a) you have restrictive ballot access laws and b) (in the case of the US) a two party system with no proportional representation in the national legislature. I think that Revolution is the only way that Socialism could truly be instituted."
communism101,3ckrf2,Proletarian87,6,Wed Jul 8 22:11:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer! I'm also starting to believe that revolution is the only way to go. But what troubles me is that revolution in Brazil (and to a certain degree, also in America, Australia, etc) is likely to be also countered, not just by the bourgeoisie state physical apparatus (police and army), but also by the bourgeoisie alienation so entrenched into the people's mind.  We had two situations over here: in the 30s, during Getulio Vargas goverment, there was a minor communist outbreak (mainly low rank soldiers) in Brazil. It was largely unsuccessful and a failure. They believed the urban working class would join them, what didn't happen in any scale. After the 64 military coup, and specially during the 70s, a few marxist guerrilla organizations started fighting against the military goverment. Most of them thought the peasantry would adhere to the revolution, but this also didn't happen. The failure of those attempts in gaining people's support in a era where Brazil was transitioning from a post-colonial agrarian economy into a more industry based one, makes me wonder that now, in a more developed country economically (but also more reactionary politically), the situation is much worse. This always made me think that, achieving progress through the bourgeoisie parliament would maybe open more people's eyes to the fact that socialism is not what they think. But lately I've been also questioning this, seeing how despite the improvements we had over the last 12 years under a social democratic/democratic socialist government (depends on who you ask), now that we're in a crisis that's also affecting the proletariat, people are demanding more free-market measures, and mostly likely, the next government is going to be from a more center-right wing party."

I've always thought that, while the ideology of the extreme left wing parties satisfy me more, I find them and their members usually totally detached of Brazilian reality (mostof the members are university students, with probably almost 0% members of the proletariat), which made me join the PT (Workers Party) which is the party in power right now, but has a huge workers base.

For now we save Capitalism from itself whenever there's a recession or depression, but this will not be possible indefinitely. And either bit by bit, or all at once, capitalism will have to either become fascism or recede.  There was an attempt to parliamentarily introduce a form of socialism light in Sweden, where a ""tax"" on corporate wealth would over a number of years move ownership of corporations from private hands into public ownership (via stocks, I think?). I can't recall the details now.

communism101,3cml1k,Steelbolt,7,Thu Jul 9 12:38:50 2015 UTC,"What exactly is modern-day feminism? Feminism is an extremely diverse political ideology. The most popular are liberal feminists who believe that incorporating women to be equal in a capitalist society is the course for gender equality. There are radical feminists(TERFS and SWERFS) who believe in abolishing gender, but those are typically extremely transmisogynistic and reactionary. (There are also gender nihilists who are not transphobic but still believe in abolishing gender). Communists are very close to feminist movements and while they are critical of liberal, capitalist, and reactionary feminisms, they are supportive of socialistic, proletarian, liberatory feminisms.   MRAs and anti-feminists come from a reactionary camp, and when criticizing feminism as a movement they often show the reactionary sides of feminism, the racism and reactionary politics of many liberal feminists and the transphobia, homophobia, and other reactionary politics of TERFS and SWERFS. They call this ""modern-day feminism"" and say that feminism as a movement is useless for the modern day. ""Feminism of the 20th century achieved equality of the sexes!"" and so on.  I believe that women's liberation is not only important, but necessary for a socialist revolution. I would hardly call the issues you point out ""non-revolutionary"" either. Women are treated awfully in our society, they face sexual violence at a much higher rate than men, are (alongside trans men) denied reproductive rights, and face a myriad of other social, economic, and political problems.

communism101,3cgpki,tiptopgolfy,10,Tue Jul 7 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"First off, nobody wants to turn painting or essay writing into a committee activity.  Communism is in part about freeing individuals to pursue their desires and fulfill their potential -- this is something that really comes through strongly particularly in the earlier Marx.  It's strange that the person you heard would take such individual creative activities and then act as if private ownership of the means of production was somehow the same thing.  For a start, even ignoring all the other problems, what about the vast majority of people who don't own and run the business, but instead work and have to follow the owner's diktats?  Marx actually wrote a fair bit about this from the other side of the argument, pointing out that the capitalist mode of production separates people from the fruit of their labour and leads to alienation.  Here he is somwhat poetically outlining some ideas in the 1844 manuscripts (worth reading that whole chapter, it's quite short):   First, the fact that labor [under capitalism] is external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his intrinsic nature; that in his work, therefore, he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He feels at home when he is not working, and when he is working he does not feel at home. His labor is therefore not voluntary, but coerced; it is forced labor. It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need; it is merely a means to satisfy needs external to it. Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, labor is shunned like the plague. External labor, labor in which man alienates himself, is a labor of self-sacrifice, of mortification. Lastly, the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else’s, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another. Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination, of the human brain and the human heart, operates on the individual independently of him – that is, operates as an alien, divine or diabolical activity – so is the worker’s activity not his spontaneous activity. It belongs to another; it is the loss of his self.  As a result, therefore, man (the worker) only feels himself freely active in his animal functions – eating, drinking, procreating, or at most in his dwelling and in dressing-up, etc.; and in his human functions he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal."

This isn't really a documentary about the history or politics of the DPRK but the Departures series (Canadian travel show) went to the DPRK. I really enjoyed the documentary not so much because of what it is but rather what it's not. Many western documentaries approach the DPRK as if they are secret agents infiltrating the ""hermit kingdom""... ""against all odds"" to show the world the brainwashed North Koreans. And under this guise they come off as racist assholes, constantly prodding their guides in hopes of getting footage and quietly viewing the people as zoo animals and wonder why many look puzzled instead of smiling and waving to them.     Departures is different as it's mainly a travel documentary and treats the people of DPRK as human beings and the hosts seem genuine. Because of this their guides and the people open up more and you can see things for which, if the vice documentary (for example) was your only education on the DPRK, you would assume they would be sent to some labor camp for disrespect or something.

The west focuses solely on the government and makes it out to be terribly overbearing and constantly down the throat of the average person, such that any misstep will lead a person to prison or execution. That really isn't so. There are certainly a lot of ""rules"" that seem strange to people in other countries, such as not being able to wear jeans, etc... but breaking rules doesn't immediately get one into trouble. The other striking thing to me was that the west portrays the DPRK as very orderly and everyone constantly being watched, and I was quite surprised at how much of an organized chaos it seemed to be. As far as standard of living, there are so many countries just as bad or worse than DPRK as far as development and accessibility of food and water, that the portrayal of it by the west is really quite laughable in a lot of ways."

Of course no one think DPRK is a heaven on earth, but some balance would be welcome.  I've start watching Departures now, and so far it indeed seems better than the majority of things out there.

As for pushing them into a struggle they're not ready for, it is already a struggle there from my experience and it only got worse once the new franchise owners (foreign investors) took over. An extra problem is that the place has such a high turnover of staff and being a worker there has a negative stigma among a lot of people despite the obvious lack of ""opportunity"" (to be exploited) because it's unskilled work.

Gulag and the NKVD were used to punish and to  prevent infiltration so it was mandatory.

communism101,3cb6st,iskandarios,3,Mon Jul 6 21:04:30 2015 UTC,"I make a couple of points in response to this: famines in both the USSR and China resulted from massive and, in the case of the USSR, totally unprecedented changes in the system of agricultural production. In both cases they undertook this project in countries which were heavily rural and overwhelmingly reliant on peasant production, so as to build up and modernize agricultural production in both countries. Before this had occurred, famine was a regular part of the life of the majority of the population in both of these countries (I believe in China before the revolution, there was famine in some part of China at any given time). These overwhelming changes were made very quickly, and although in both cases they led to famines at first, in both countries famine as a normal condition of life ended -- the terrible mistakes which led to productive and distributive failures were corrected and production indeed did become adequate to the populace's needs. I guess in both cases we can draw the lesson that getting agricultural production right is absolutely essential, and that it is absolutely worth it to take the time to make sure such a transition is done right. Also, there is the point that I just made that famines were routine both under Tsarism and in China before the revolutions. Why are capitalist famines not even worth mentioning, but communist famines (smaller and fewer famines) are enough to indict the very thought of communism?  As far as mass killings? These have happened under Communist regimes, and they should be condemned where appropriate. Some forms of mass killing, such as the ""red terrors"" used to repress bourgeois counter-revolution, were politically necessary to establish the new governments and were in fact not unique since in every country where a political revolution has occurred similar terrors have been organized to break the resistance of the losing class. Why were such terrors justifiable to establish capitalism, but not communism?  These ""you too!"" arguments are not justifications for communism, to be clear. (Although I think it is possible to make the case that since the process the famines were a part of led ultimately to the ending of famine in these areas, and since the point of the red terrors was to establish the security of a political power committed to ending the political and economic basis for structural, organized violence, it is not that these deaths are justified, but are rather moments in the shift from structural famine to structural food security and from structural violence to structural nonviolence, and do not condemn communist politics but do provide us with important lessons about how to go about doing this). However, someone who is attacking communism using these arguments is doing one of three things: 1. they are explicitly defending the capitalist present (in which case, they should be confronted with the double standard they are applying), 2. they are implicitly defending the capitalist present by denouncing communism but refusing to engage the question of a ""third alternative"" to capitalism or communism (a depressing number of people think this is adequate to defend their argument after they've brought up the issue of communist violence), in which case they should be confronted with their implicit support for capitalism or 3. they believe in some ""third way"" other than capitalism or communism, in which case they should be encouraged to elaborate in concrete, material, and historical terms what exactly they think this ""third way"" might be. Many social-democrats and anarchists consider themselves members of this third camp, for a variety of bad reasons. Forcing them to be concrete about their goals often makes clear that they fit into one or the other camp, no-one really believes in an actual third way totally unrelated to either capitalism or communism or which somehow ""strikes a balance"" between the two. Just about everyone has one class which they think ought to generally have the upper hand in such ""compromise"" scenarios.  It is, also, the case that capitalism is extremely, extremely violent, infinitely more violent just by numbers alone than socialism ever has been. Anyone bringing this issue up to you in critique of socialism also needs to address the much larger and broader violence of capitalism, or else explain why all of the structural violence of capitalism is justified."

So, depending on the tendency Marxists explain the Napoleans, Perons, and Mubaraks of the world differently.  My bias is to understand these Bonapartist figures as being put into power by the ruling class when it's not powerful enough on its own to take control. In other words, it is the class interests that pushes those figures into power. But it is also their weakness to actually take power that requires them to have to seek a figure that can control the masses of the oppressed classes. So the Bonapartist figure glistening then required to give concessions to the oppressed class in order to have the ruling class interests mostly maintained.  Their importance in society is only a reflection of the power they are given. It is the ideology that is built from the social conditions. But we always look for the material conditions first and see how the ideology rises from that first. The cult of personality argument analysis the ideological first and never understands its origin. It also is subject to misapplication as things that seem ideologically similar in this particular way end up having very different matertial conditions, and corresponding differences in ideology. This is why its silly to compare Hitler and Stalin as the same, for example (regardless of your opinion on Stalin)."

Greece is the latter. It is a capitalist country that has a 'socialist' party, Syriza, in power.   This argument is an extension of the belief that 'socialism' = lots of social policies (i.e. what liberals call socialism). When I first learned about the economic situation in Greece in school (not the current one, the one that was a result of the 2008 collapse, if not earlier), it was taught as an example of what happens when taxes are too low and social spending is too high. I did some more research for myself and found out that the situation in Greece is more complicated than that, but my peers at the time agreed with what they were taught. Now it is assumed that, because the social-policies that 'socialism' advocates cost a lot of money to implement in a capitalistic economy, and Greece is spending too much money in said programs, people will put 2 and 2 together and say that socialism collapsed Greece's economy.   TL:DR: it is an argument from ignorance."

What we have is 'really existing capitalism', which takes form as some variety of 'state capitalism', in which the state has significant control of the economy and, in social democratic countries, the means of production.  In regards to the 'Communist' states you mention, workers generally were not in control of production and had limited democratic control over the economy. This means that, though their economies were largely planned, they were done so 'privately' by the state, which was not directly controlled by the workers.  This means that the capitalist - or at least, 'state capitalist' - mode of production defined the economy in these countries, rather than workers control which is the essence of socialism."

communism101,3c3tan,the_anarcho-canadian,6,Mon Jul 6 01:00:11 2015 UTC,"One perspective:  State capitalism, as a term, can have multiple definitions, depending on who you talk to. Many use ""state capitalism"" as a critique of extant socialist states like the USSR or Cuba. For those of us whose analysis says that these social formations were indeed socialist, this use of state capitalism is unscientific and inaccurate. It's mostly just a propaganda term slandering these countries. Again, other tendencies would disagree.  The definition of state capitalism that I find to be particularly useful is that it's the capitalist mode of production, where the state has fundamental control of the means of production. This state capitalism can only really play a subordinate role in a social formation. Generalized commodity production necessitates multiple capitals, even at the monopoly stage. And without legal access to surplus value, a bourgeoisie wouldn't be able to sustain itself. State capitalism can be used in capitalist formations to nationalize certain industries, which ultimately plays a role in support of capital. It can be used in socialist formations as a transitory stage, as a retreat in the progress of class conflict. An example would be the NEP in the early USSR, where subordinate markets were allowed as a consession to bourgeois and wealthy peasant classes. It's also what you see with subordinate markets in socialist states like Cuba, China, and Vietnam. (Although many analyses conclude that China and Vietnam have restored capitalism completely)  Check out this article for more info  But again, other tendencies have other analyses of state capitalism as a term, which should not be ignored  Edit: I wanted to add Mao's description of the use of state capitalism in a socialist formation"

communism101,3c3nti,jdlashley,20,Sat Jul 4 13:28:39 2015 UTC,"These are my thoughts on this topic that I have been having as a physicist. I will be happy to elaborate on any point here.  I think that the first thing one has to realize it's that dialectics are a refinement of non-dialectical methods.  Just as Newton was not rendered useless by Einstein, dialectics do not render formal logic useless. In both of these cases, the refined theory extends the older one and allows one to make predictions that the old theory gets wrong.  To me one of the fundamental differences between dialectics and formal logic is in what they make functions out of. Formal logic likes to make functions out of lines and exponentials. Things that go to infinity at one or both ends. Dialectics on the other hand tends to make functions out of ""s"" shaped curves (logistic functions for those that care). These never go to infinity and are the mathematical equivalent of the law of quantity turning into quality.  This is broadly equivalent to Newton claiming that with enough force an object will accelerate forever, reaching infinite velocity, and then Einstein saying that there is in fact an upper bound. Newton it's not completely wrong. At low velocities his theory works, but you can't extend his results to higher velocities.  In the same way there are sorts of formalist theories in politics and economics that assume that because things are going one way now, they will continue to do that forever. Either things will never change, or will continue to change the way they are currently. This mode of thinking makes sense if you make up the world out of lines and exponential.  As dialectitians we know that just because things are changing now doesn't mean they can't stop, and just because things are static now doesn't mean they will always be so.  I guess that's how I use dialectics on my everyday."
communism101,3c3nti,rachmeilovich,6,Sat Jul 4 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"That's really informative, although I was more wondering how you would use dialectics to analyze everyday situations.

It seems like a really useful way of thinking about things, even apart from Marxism."
communism101,3c3nti,rachmeilovich,7,Sat Jul 4 15:22:25 2015 UTC,"I think the useful thing to remember is that what appear to be smooth changes are composed of many discreet episodes on a different scale, and discreet episodes appear as smooth changes on a different scale.  I know nothing of your parents' particular divorce, so forgive me if I mischaracterize any particulars.  On the scale of one of your parents' whole life the divorce was a single event in a long chain of events that led to where they are now. Zooming in we see a discontinuity in that one moment they were married and the next they weren't (quantitative to qualitative change). Zooming in further we see that the discontinuity is actually a smooth change in frustration or disappointment in the relationship, part of which was it's ultimate dissolution. Zooming in further we see that the smooth change is actually punctuated by individual events. Zooming in even further we see that each event is a smooth change that is in turn punctuated by its own sub events.  The very idea of dialectics is that progression is self similar and scale is everything."

While anarchism and communism as ideologies are opposed to each other, their proponents do not; and have worked together to combat capitalism on many occasions.   The main difference between communists and anarchists is how to achieve communism. In general, communists advocate want to remove the capitalist class from its position to use state power, give that state power to the working class (dictatorship of the proletariat, which despite the name isn't inherently dictatorial), and then use that power to transition to full communism. Anarchists, on the other hand, believe the state is inherently capitalistic, so in order to achieve full communism you have to get rid of capitalism and the state.  When communists hear that an anarchist wants to get rid of the state, they will falsely assume that anarchists want to bypass any transition period and immediately achieve full communism. This is one of the main things that communists seem to misunderstand about anarchism. An anarchist would have to be extremely idealistic to think that simply getting rid of capitalism and the state will automatically bring about full communism. Once capitalism and the state are abolished, there is still work to be done; as we would still be in a period of scarcity. Some places, like the Arabian peninsula, have less access to water than, lets say, Canada; and therefore, there is water scarcity. Once no more scarcity in the world exists, and we enter a period of post-scarcity, is when the anarchist can claim that full communism has been achieved. There is much 'discussion' as to how this point would be reached. The only real work that addresses the scarcity problem is Murray Bookchin's Post-Scarcity Anarchism, but some have accused it of being idealistic."

For a pretext to the Syrian civil war, I recommend the book on Assad's father by Patrick Seale.  Syrian Civil War:  http://www.britannica.com/event/Syrian-Civil-War  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-26116868  These are the most common and informative ones so far, there's plenty about both on the internet. But my recommendation is to read manifestos, party history or even follow the YPGs or YPJs twitter feed. But you can order Öcalan's pamphlets on amazon for £0.75 to £2.50. And his books are a solid read too. He mainly talks about democratic confederalism and why he and the PKK (banned party who fought against Erdogan from 1983 to now, seeking a Kurdish homeland within turkey, Iraq and Syria) are abandoning the idea of a Kurdish homeland.  EDIT: the stuff the KNC can be easily understood from the constitution I linked. The council is a branch of the PKK endorsed by the PYD. It is made up of Syrian Kurds."

communism101,3bxal7,jlmango,10,Thu Jul 2 22:32:44 2015 UTC,"I would say yes. Since we both acknowledge that there is an environmental problem (and I'm assuming you agree that it's human driven) we must ask what is causing it. Well, a lot of it is carbon in the atmosphere, there's far too much. There's also the loss of forests and jungles and the pollution of rivers, lakes and oceans as well as what some scientists are saying is the beginning of a mass extinction event (I believe this would be the sixth is history).   So now that we know what the problems are (and there are more than what I posted), how are these problems being caused? For carbon, much comes from the use of fossil fuels for energy. Why do we use these? The answer is that it's cheap to use it. Developing technology to use nuclear fission (the most practical energy if you want clean and efficient), solar or wind as well as the other sources of alternative energy costs a lot more money and will lead to lower profits in the short term than sticking with fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are also very inefficient. One molecule of gasoline in a car engine will give you 4-6 electron volts (eV) of energy where as fission will give you somewhere around 50 million times that per molecule (or single atom in this case).   Another problem, and one that can be caused by nuclear energy as well, is that it costs money to be responsible disposing waste. Nuclear waste must be safely contained. Sludge from factories must be contained. It's much easier and cheaper to just throw this into a lake or river and call it a day. Oceans are polluted with garbage because recycling is more expensive than throwing something into a landfill which will eventually run out of room.  Forests are destroyed because we need resources. However, many of these forests and jungles are torn down but there is little attempt to replant what was used (and even if there were, it would take a long time for them to regrow). Many industrial countries do not allow the use of hemp (or it's very hard to grow it) which has so many uses and can be regrown so quickly it really is just absurd.  Now, why is this the fault of capitalism and why would communism/socialism make this better? Well, as I've pointed out, capitalism seeks to maximize profits. This comes by having people perform labor and giving them a portion of its value. The surplus value kept by the capitalists must be greater than what they spend on disposing of waste or else they won't do it (and it's always going to be cheaper to not be responsible). There are also many people with invested money in timber industries to switch to using hemp, it would kill stock prices. Socialism and communism do not seek to maximize profits. We all own the lakes, trees and other resources and we recognize that we need a clean, healthy environment to live our lives the best that we can. Therefore, it is in the socialist's best interest to keep a clean environment."
communism101,3bxal7,Jeff6851,5,Fri Jul 3 02:38:32 2015 UTC,"Under communism, production for use-value, not exchange-value, is dominant.  Under capitalism, oil (for example) is produced because oil can be transformed into money, but under communism, oil would be produced because people decided they need to use oil for something or other.  What this means is that you can actually talk people into ending the consumption of oil under communism, because you can talk them into deciding to end or reduce the production of it.  That's simply not possible under capitalism.  Oil companies own capital and they are compelled to valorize it; they must produce oil and sell it on pain of extinction, and they will use their capital to fight all liberal-democratic attempts to constrict them."

Marxism is a living science based on the theoretical and practical work of millions of individuals. So Marxism goes well beyond whatever Marx wrote or said, and while it's certainly based on many of his ideas there is in principle no problem in contradicting him. Just one example: Marx thought revolutions would initially happen in the most advanced capitalist countries. This has not been the case (because of imperialism), and today many Marxists have no problem holding a view that is ""in contradiction"" to what Marx said.  Perhaps another analogy to see what this means is to think that modern physics is not the same than ""whatever Newton or Einstein thought"", even though it obviously owes a great deal to those two individuals."

Your example of where the revolution would take place is an irrelevant one, I think, for that address more the factual knowledge at hand and the conclusions drawn from it -- Marx did not have availability to the same kind of experiences Marxists have now and therefore inconsistent conclusions of his time are quickly omitted.  So the center if my question regards not the evolution of Marxism and how it of course has developed beyond of much what Marx wrote, but whether a distinction need be drawn between Marxism at its very roots and the ideas of Karl Marx.   Hope this makes some sense. Looking forward to your reply."

So for the American middle class and rich, any socialist government would be entirely despotic.  So you have to remember on what metric can anyone really say a system of government is totalitarian?  There has not been any state in my mind that I can recall from history that was entirely dedicated to snuffing out the free will of anyone, only the expression of class interests.  Especially today we can see generally two kinds of dictatorships.  The dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeois.

I agree with you that choice is central to what makes us human, but look at something like the difference in price between generic and brand name drugs or generic bagged cereal and boxed Lucky Charms. Many times, the choice we get to have in a capitalist society isn't really a choice at all, but an attempt to convince us to spend more.  I can't speak about what has happened historically because I have no idea, but it wouldn't be terribly difficult to prevent that type of thing from happening. If someone has an idea about how something could be made better or differently, they'd be able to find others that agree with them and try to make it happen. Without corporate propaganda or the fierce, blind brand loyalty that we see when it comes to things like video game consoles, soda brands, or shoe companies, people might be more open to change and be more willing to throw their support behind an interesting alternative to whatever's on the shelves."

What communists do defend is: having people control the means of production that they anyway use to produce everything, and defend themselves from the likely attempts by capitalists to avoid this; putting those means of production to work in order to fulfill basic human needs instead of capitalist accumulation.

communism101,3bpyax,ilikebuildingsheds,4,Wed Jul 1 13:45:13 2015 UTC,"So as Marxists we have to analyze sex dialectically. Before we get into contradictions, let's look at what it is and where it comes from. Sexuality is obviously a social phenomenon, Lenin talked about this, and it comes partly from our nature and partly from our environment. The jury's out on how big those parts are, but it's probably on an individual to individual basis since those two sides are in a non-antagonistic internal contradiction. One's sexuality is social, so it is also in contradiction with any partners' sexualities, as well as cultural norms and traditions. So in sexuality under capitalism, for the most part, we see the domination of cultural norms and nurture as opposed to having more personal sex. There is a documentary about sex in the DDR that shows this discrepancy. As Marxists, the lesson we get from this, or any dialectical analysis, is that progress always wins. Engage, experiment with your sexuality, give it room to grow. It's a constantly changing and expanding thing. Do so knowing that it is a social thing, and that your partner(s) is/are going through the same process. Have your own personal sexual revolutions, quantitative changes, when you feel they're necessary. All this is healthier for both you and your community. EDIT: I just realized I didn't directly answer any of your questions. Same-gender and opposite-gender relationships don't really have any reason to be inherently different, especially in socialism. Part of our duty as communists and radical feminists is to abolish gender roles in all facets. I'm personally a fan of polyamory, but I know a lot of comrades who aren't, but we'll see what happens. Monamory and polyamory aren't mutually exclusive in the aggregate, so the two can coexist as individuals see fit. I personally hate romance and see it as the last dregs of feudal society being perpetuated by reactionary classes. There should be room for it in socialist society, but not in the same creepy possessive way it is in capitalism.

People often mistake ""purged"" for ""killed"", which is where the ""Stalin killed 50,000 people"" myth comes from. Most of them were not killed, and merely demoted or fired. They were ""purged"" in the sense that they were got rid of and expelled from the CPSU."

The members were: Lenin, Kamenev, Krestinsky, Stalin, Trotsky (full members) and Bukharin, Zinovyev, Kalinin (alternate members). Lenin died in 1924 and other members (except Stalin and Kalinin) were removed from Politburo during 1920s by the Party, democratically. Trotsky was later expelled from the Party and exiled. In 1930s the remaining former members of Politburo were purged, jailed and eventually executed (Trotsky was assassinated), with the exception of Stalin and Kalinin. Also, some other members of Politburo which were elected during 1920s-1930s were also purged (Rykov, Tomsky, Rudzutak, Kosior and Chubar) and others were not (Molotov, Kaganovich, Kirov, Zhdanov etc.)"

The granting of increased workers' rights protections and civil rights protections over the past century, for instance, have kept people faithful to a system that doesn't truly support them because it feels like progress is being made. I'm not saying those are the wrong things to fight for, only that the bourgeoisie has reacted many times before to threats like these, postponing any revolution. Corporate and government propagandists have been churning out anti-communist propaganda for almost one hundred years now, and that's been a huge obstacle to revolution because its been so effectively seeded in peoples' minds. I don't know of any one major thing that would prevent the revolution. All I can think of is the collapse of the USSR. Many people took its death to mean the death of the idea of communism as a viable ideology at all. If the bourgeoisie can continue to push propaganda, continue to push the idea of the ""end of history"" after the death of communism, and continue to throw a bone to us here or there, then we could be a long ways off from revolution.  The threat of total corporate takeover of governments is a real and terrifying possibility thanks to legislation like the TPP. Private companies might gain unprecedented amounts of power in the coming decades, making it difficult to fight against them. I think we're seeing some of those warning signs now. I can only hope that once people see clearly that governments are beholden to corporations that they'll choose to act."

Unfortunately, most of what Americans know about anything to the left of the Democratic Party is EXTREMELY biased; whether it be from the mass-media, literature, the education system, etc.    Everything you have said has essentially meant you don't trust the masses.    It's not that the masses can't be trusted, it's that our society (America in particular) is so anti-communist in nature, that it's almost instinctual to see communism as a great evil. It's not even that the American people are against communism. They recognize the power that corporations have over us. They recognize the corrupt nature of our government. It is just that either A) they are so used to this that they think it is normal, or B) those who do want to change things for the better can't imagine change beyond our current system because, again, people think this is the way things are done, through no fault of their own. They agree that our system isn't the best but as soon as you bring up 'Communism', 'bourgeoisie', and other 'Marxist Jargon' (for lack of a better term), they completely disregard what you are saying. They are not against communism, they are against the idea of communism.   It's like explaining evolution to a fundamentalist Christian. They agree that there is gradual change over time, that traits can be passed down genetically and so on. But if you even mention the word evolution, they will reject everything you say on the matter, even the stuff you already agreed upon. Again, through no fault of their own. This (imaginary) person was raised his whole life believing that evolution is a 'lie', and will only naturally disregard anything said about evolution. This person isn't against the facts of evolution; he is simply against the idea of evolution, as a word, as a thing he was taught his entire life as being evil. It is the same idea with communism. We have a society that teaches us from a young age about the evils of communism (directly in school and by the mass media, and indirectly through the narratives of books to how our system is structured in general), and these people push aside the idea of communism, even if they agree with the ideas of communism. Unfortunately, I don't really see a way of combating this, as the terminology used by communists is so integral to communism as an ideology. Hopefully this puts what Ill-V said into better context."

These are expressions of the material conditions, but the subjective conditions aren't in place yet. What has happened historically is that when there is a revolution, there is already an organization behind it. If not, then a loose association of allied organizations (like the August revolution). There can be a revolution without the majority's initial support. The American revolution only had the support of about a third of the population (it was a bourgeois revolution, but the example should still work). Once the fighting starts, convincing people won't be hard because their lives will be better in red areas than in the capitalist ones. If there is a revolt, we have to analyze it. Is there any organization behind it? Is it the right time for it? What is the revolt's strength compared to its enemies? From a constantly changing analysis we can decide when and if we intervene on what side, supporting or renouncing."

For me it isn't about being anti-sectarian, since there would be no reason not to call myself a Leninist or whatever internally if this was the case.  However, I do choose my labels carefully depending on who I talk to -- socialist, communist, Marxist, anti-capitalist, leftist, I use them all.

They have a ""use-value,"" so to speak, that can't be generalized to an ""exchange value,"" or universal theoretical relevance.  So while ML, council-communism, etc. might each have valuable theoretical and praxical features, neither taken as a whole are something I could subscribe to. They are, necessarily, communisms of past times and places responding to particular political, economic, and social confluences.

This was when the Paris proletariat rose up and threw the French governmet out of the city, taking power via the armed people and their newly elected representatives.  During the Russian Revolutions we saw the soviets rise up, which were the democratic bodies of the working class (although they gradually lost power to the state), and Lenin talks of these as an advance on the organisation of the Paris Commune (aka. the DotP).  So the phease simply refers to the working class taking power, and ther are many organisational models it could follow.

The point can be made that scientists end up thinking dialectically when they actually make a significant scientific discovery (especially when they start from a sort of problematic situation), but this is not the same than using dialectics consciously.  Second, I think the main reason why dialectics is fought head on on economics or politics, but not so much on physics or biology, is that in the former it poses a direct threat to the currently existing class relations. Marxism has been a huge historical threat to the rule of the bourgeoisie when applied to the fields of politics and economy, not so much when it has (possibly indirectly) led to new discoveries in physics, biology, psychology, etc. In fact capitalism has shown itself to be remarkably able to adapt to all sorts of scientific discoveries as long as they did not directly threaten its fundamental ideological foundations."

Secondly, there are punitive measures the state can take if people stop working or sabotage their equipment.

Other conceptions of the state will either deny that classes exist or that the state is always the tool of the ruling class. The Marxist theory of the state is part of the theory of historical materialism, so anyone who denies historical materialism will also deny its theory of the state. For example, one alternative is the Hobbesian idea that the state is the means, arrived at by social contract, through which society reaches civilization by policing people's innate violence, overcoming the ""state of nature"". On the (or a) fascist conception of the state, there are struggling classes in society, but the state is not the instrument of the ruling class. Instead it is the site of class collaboration; its job is to bring harmony between the classes, not to serve one class or another.

You can't rent out your knowledge or your labor to someone else to live off the profit or interest.  You can with actual capital."
communism101,3b8799,bitparity,2,Sat Jun 27 01:14:39 2015 UTC,"The creation of a highly productive labour force gave rise to what is called ‘human capital’ theory, which is one of the weirdest widely accepted economic ideas that could ever be imagined. It found its first expression in the writings of Adam Smith. The acquisition of productive talents on the part of labour, he argued, through ‘education, study or apprenticeship, always costs a real expense, which is a capital fixed and realized as it were in his person. Those talents, as they make a part of his fortune, so do they likewise that of the society to which he belongs. The improved dexterity of a workman may be considered in the same light as a machine or instrument of trade which facilitates and abridges labour, and which, though it costs a certain expense, repays that expense with a profit.’1 The question, of course, is who foots the bill for the creation of such talents – labour, the state, capital or some institution in civil society (like the Church) – and who gets the benefits (or ‘profits’ in Adam Smith’s parlance)?  To be sure, skilled and highly trained labour might reasonably expect a higher rate of remuneration than unskilled labour, but that is a far cry from accepting the idea that the higher wage is a form of profit on the workers’ investment in their own education and skills. The problem, as Marx pointed out in his acerbic criticism of Adam Smith, is that the worker can only realise the higher value of those skills by working for capital under conditions of exploitation such that it is, in the end, capital and not the worker that reaps the benefit from the higher productivity of labour.2 In recent times, for example, worker productivity has surged but the share of output going to labour has declined, not increased. In any case, if what the worker truly possessed in bodily form was capital, Marx pointed out, then he or she would be entitled to sit back and just live off the interest of his or her capital without doing a single day’s work (capital as a property relation always has that option at hand). As far as I can tell, the main point of the revival of human capital theory, at the hands of Gary Becker in the 1960s, for example, was to bury the significance of the class relation between capital and labour and make it seem as if we are all just capitalists earning different rates of return on our capital (human or otherwise).3 If labour was getting very low wages, it could then be argued that this was simply a reflection of the fact that workers had not invested enough effort in building up their human capital! It was, in short, their fault if they were low-paid. Hardly surprisingly, all the major institutions of capital, from economics departments to the World Bank and the IMF, wholeheartedly embraced this theoretical fiction for ideological and certainly not for sound intellectual reasons. These same institutions have more recently similarly embraced the wondrous fiction that the informal sector of social reproduction which dominates in many cities of the developing world is in fact a seething mass of micro-enterprises that need only a dose of microfinance (at usurious rates of interest pocketed at the end of the trail by major financial institutions) in order to become fully fledged card-carrying members of the capitalist class.

The entity that directs people and projects is the party secretary and the party cadre but the party secretary and party cadre are ruled by the ideology, and the party's objectives. So if things are moved in one direction, it isn't done according to the wishes of one person but according to the ideology and the stance of the party.  To make an example, when the general secretary is retiring and a new secretary is being elected, its said that it should never be by voting but by consensus. So when there is more than one contender for the post, the party as a whole discusses the difference in approaches put forward by them and have to decide on the best approach and then, ideally speaking, the other contenders should also see the merits of one particular best approach and should take back their proposal.  In this way, the person with the best approach was appointed as the secretary but it wasn't 'him' that was selected but his approach. In this way, in true communism, things are not decided by leaders, but by approaches which are discussed by the party and decided as a whole."

communism101,3b3yfw,jakehmw,5,Thu Jun 25 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"One of the major elements of Marx's theory of value is, as /u/kirjatoukka said, the idea of not just labor-time, but socially necessary labor-time. What is socially necessary labor-time? Well, we can see that it is a specific amount of labor measured in time (hours, days, etc.). But it must also be socially necessary. If an average worker can produce a commodity in B hours, a skilled worker can produce the same commodity in A hours, and a novice worker in C hours and A<B<C, the ""vulgar"" labor theories of value (as in, not Marx's) would seem to give off the idea that the commodity made by the novice worker would be worth the most, due to a greater quantity of labor-time being ""held"" in it. Likewise, the skilled worker's commodity would be worth much less. We can all tell that this isn't true. Since the average worker can produce the commodity in B hours, producing it in A or C hours does not increase or decrease the value, it's just varying matters of efficiency. B hours, being the amount that an average worker with the average productivity under the average conditions, etc., is the amount of socially necessary labor-time.  Now this doesn't completely solve the problem. It still seems that this mudpie must have value, but only as much as it would take to produce under average production conditions. This overlooks one of the ""nuances"" of Marx's theory of value: the labor must be useful labor to ""count"" as value.  So, what is this useful labor? It is labor that culminates in a specific use-value. Use-value is essentially the ""usefulness"" of a commodity. For example, a chair's use-value would be that you could more or less comfortably sit on it. Value (socially necessary labor-time, thus a more metaphysical or social property of a commodity) must be contained within a specific use-value (or the material properties of a commodity). This shows us another meaning of ""socially necessary"": there must be some sort of social need for the commodity. It doesn't matter how long I were to slave over a mudpie (or how long an average mudpie maker would), if it does not contain a use-value, no value is generated.  For a more full explanation, see Ch. 1 of Marx's Capital, Vol. I."
communism101,3b3yfw,anarchoqueer,2,Fri Jun 26 00:36:28 2015 UTC,"So does the relative usefulness of the labor contained within the commodity change as a result of social preferences? Say that I'm selling coats, but demand falls sharply. The amount of socially necessary labor time required to make that coat has not changed, yet its price is lessened because people are not willing to pay as much as before. Does that, therefore, make the labor less useful? Or are value and price not as interrelated as I think?  I just finished ch. 1 of Capital, so sorry if he addressed this already and I missed it or he addresses it later on"
communism101,3b3yfw,otherfuentesbrother,6,Fri Jun 26 08:12:12 2015 UTC,"There's some sort of relationship there: you can only figure out what's socially necessary by actually trying to sell it. I think Marx uses the example of a weaver having produced too much cloth and not being able to find enough buyers, but it would be just the same if the level of demand went down.  So what's happened, in your example, is that what is “socially necessary” has changed, on aggregate — some of the coats are no longer useful, because nobody needs them, and so the labor required to make them was (retroactively) not socially necessary."

Presumably the society would have mechanisms in place to allow surplus resources to be used by people without seeking prior approval. Not every artist will have to apply for a paintbrush or every brewer for barley. Ideally there will be a surplus of paintbrushes and barley, so those who want to experiment and play can just take from that cache without going through bureaucratic hoops. Only where there is scarcity in a resource will one have to seek government approval, but a properly functioning government should have the foresight to try to produce surpluses where doing is possible, not just so that people can have free access to valuable resources but so that there will be supplies in place in the event of shortages due to emergencies. It's really just a budgeting problem."

The means of production are owned socially by whatever form of democracy that the workers decided on best suited their workplace. I'd imagine that the easiest and most logically feasible step to socialism would be to transfer the property rights of the workplace to a written worker's constitution unique to each workplace.
communism101,3awaxj,SolidBlues,5,Wed Jun 24 02:29:12 2015 UTC,"It would be subject to the laws of market exchange.   And eventually accumulation until bye bye workers co-ops.   The means of production are owned socially by whatever form of democracy that the workers decided on best suited their workplace.   They would be owned privately by workers who would be forced to exploit themselves in order to keep their co-op alive.   I'd imagine that the easiest and most logically feasible step to socialism would be to transfer the property rights of the workplace to a written worker's constitution unique to each workplace.    That's not a step towards socialism, that's a temporary move towards a slightly different capitalism that would eventually go back to being regular capitalism. Assuming it would be possible at all."
communism101,3awaxj,TheNateMonster,-1,Wed Jun 24 02:36:30 2015 UTC,"Of course there would be wealth accumulation, but it wouldn't recreate capitalism because private ownership would be outlawed.  They wouldn't actually be 'exploiting themselves' if they democratically decided to each have an equal share of the profit pie. They would choose to 'exploit' themselves only if they collectively reserved, say 20% of the profit for reinvestment and growth, à la capital flow cycle. It would not exactly be exploitation as this would be a 'free choice' creation of surplus value rather than in a capitalist system where surplus value is coercively extorted."
communism101,3awaxj,SolidBlues,5,Wed Jun 24 02:45:26 2015 UTC,"because private ownership would be outlawed.   The superstructure of society (in this case, the law) does not dictate its base (the mode of production). Not only that but private property couldn't be outlawed, except perhaps only on paper, because it would still exist. It would just be spread out over a larger group of people, but would still move towards monopolization.   They wouldn't actually be 'exploiting themselves' if they democratically decided to each have an equal share of the profit pie.   Just because they agreed to it doesn't mean it isn't happening, and besides because they would still be subject to capitalism's laws they have only two options, exploit themselves or let the co-op go out of business and starve.  By the same token, workers ""choose"" to become a wage slave but we still call it exploitation and coercive."
communism101,3awaxj,TheNateMonster,0,Wed Jun 24 02:59:30 2015 UTC,"The base and superstructure have a dialectical relationship. How do you think Russia, China, Cuba got rid of private ownership of the means of production?  They would not be subject to capitalism's laws, both systems are inherently different. One is a dictatorship while the other is a workplace democracy. The entire decision making apparatus is handled differently and thus market exchange and competition does still occur, but the characteristic environmental destruction, exploitation, alienation, crises of capitalism do not occur. Monopolization is near impossible as democratic workplace constitutions cannot be ""bought"" as a land deed or a property right can.   Of course some business models would be exploitative, but most often those very same businesses manufacture goods or services that are largely undesirable in a socialist society and that business would just fall apart due to labour flight. If communism is ever to be reached, it would be post-scarcity and post-labour and that means that the technological progress that is created in market competition will be needed.  I work in government and I see exactly how bureaucratic and inefficient state-run monopoly institutions are. Centrally planned state socialism is the perfect breeding ground for a patronage culture of nepotism and cronyism to take hold IMHO."
communism101,3aupwa,Locusthorde300,18,Tue Jun 23 17:40:48 2015 UTC,Something to remember is that the amount of necessary work for any individual would most likely be much lower — since there's no need to produce surplus-value for capitalists. Thus there'd be much more free time for people to pursue their own interests in addition to doing whatever is socially necessary.
communism101,3aupwa,kirjatoukka,7,Tue Jun 23 17:58:35 2015 UTC,"You would be able to do whatever you wanted.   Further, the division of labour implies the contradiction between the interest of the separate individual or the individual family and the communal interest of all individuals who have intercourse with one another. And indeed, this communal interest does not exist merely in the imagination, as the “general interest,” but first of all in reality, as the mutual interdependence of the individuals among whom the labour is divided. And finally, the division of labour offers us the first example of how, as long as man remains in natural society, that is, as long as a cleavage exists between the particular and the common interest, as long, therefore, as activity is not voluntarily, but naturally, divided, man’s own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him. For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic. This fixation of social activity, this consolidation of what we ourselves produce into an objective power above us, growing out of our control, thwarting our expectations, bringing to naught our calculations, is one of the chief factors in historical development up till now."

communism101,3aupwa,SolidBlues,-1,Wed Jun 24 05:49:55 2015 UTC,"OSHA and EPA are agencies that regulate commercial activity run by independent firms. In a centralized communist society, commercial activities are run by the central government. The government would simply impose regulations upon itself. It could elect to do that by allocating regulatory responsibility to independent agencies, like OSHA/EPA, that develop expertise on the subject or it could rely upon the central legislative authority to make regulations without delegating to independent authorities.  That being said, there would still be private, noncommercial activity, but that activity would just be regulated by the government, again, either through legislation produced by the central primary legislative body or through regulation promulgated by agencies that the legislative body has delegated its power to."

The only real anti-revisionist split was the Progressive Worker Movement, which started as the Canada-China Friendship Association and was expelled from the CPC in 1963.

communism101,3aw1fw,HandsomeAce,5,Tue Jun 23 23:24:28 2015 UTC,"Prior to the 90's, Maoists were just anti-revisionist Marxist-Leninists that took the side of China in the Sino-Soviet Split. They probably called themselves Maoists because the USSR still called themselves Marxist-Leninist.  In the late 80's and early 90's the Communist Party of Peru and the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement started to codify Maoism as a ""third stage of Marxism."" (RIM) In 1995, Long Live Marxism-Leninism-Maoism! was published by the RIM.  What makes them different? To my knowledge the main differences are on the question of universality and on Mao's rightward turn. MLMs view people's war as being universal, MZTs believe it is only applicable to third world countries. MLMs believe that Mao became rightist towards the end of his life (exemplified by his hosting Richard Nixon and supporting Pinochet) while, I believe, MZTs don't (I can't really say this with any authority though).   Finally, if it differed that much, why didn't Maoists of the 90s adopt a different name?   They did. They argued that Mao expanded Marxism-Leninism to a higher stage and that's why they called their ideology Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. Contrast that with Marxist-Leninist ideology with Mao Zedong Thought."

These things are laden with openly racist and dehumanizing imperialist ideology and should be combatted by revolutionaries.  I am personally still on the fence as to whether they are socialist or not, mostly due to a lack of available data and time to research the little available data that is there. All that I can say for certain is that the history and context of American threats against their sovereignty are connected to atrocities committed again the Korean people. I think it is important to be critical of communist/socialist countries so if there is a theoretical problem with what they have done, I don't think it is wrong to criticize the DPRK.

He also added the theory of surplus value, the key to marxian economics. Marx was the only one to strip away rent, interest, and profit of the entrepreneur and see labor as the core of value and the rest as socially sanctioned exploitation of that value produced. I think you should check out Ben Fine's ""Marx's Capital,"" it's short, easy to understand, and is strong on the dialectical side of analysis."

Is this what Rubin referred to in a sentence almost immediately preceding the passage I cited when he said ""they [classical political economists] finally arrived at the material-technical bases of the process of production. By means of such analysis they discovered labor in value, means of production in capital, means of workers' subsistence in wages, surplus product (which is brought about by increased productivity of labor) in profit.""  That last part ""surplus product...in profit"". Maybe I'm conflating surplus value with profit when it shouldn't be but this sounds like the classical economists knew what surplus value was and what its material-technical substance is."

Theories of Surplus Value is the big text here, and is essentially a compilation of the notes Marx took in the process of researching Capital.  Edit: and also, a chance to plug Rubin's A History of Economic Thought, which is substantially more accessible and covers much of the same ground as TSV."

Alienation is itself a quite existential point, however there is one point that needs to be made clear to differentiate Marxism and Existentialism, mainly around the very basis of Existentialism:   existence precedes essence   So yes, in the subjective atomistic view of individual persons, sure! But there is the problem that we cannot look at the subjective person and their ""essence"" they create for themself without looking at what existed before they began to exist. To put it simply:   existence precedes essence, but existence of social reality precedes the existence of the individual, thus the individual's essence is socially defined.   Or even more simply, in plain English, a person defines their own essence, but only within the parameters of the social and material conditions around them. This doesn't completely throw existentialism out the window according to Marxists, it just means we have to understand it through critical lenses (like with Nietzsche and the master-slave morality).  As for estrangement of labor, alienation, etc. this has to do with an early humanist Marx, so assuming you agree that ""Existentialism is a Humanism"" you can see where those two could be in agreement."

I will summarise very briefly though if you do not have the time to read. Religion has two definitions when it os referred to by communists.  The first is organised religion, i.e.: the church - a mechanism of class society that keeps workers content with their exploitation, as Lenin called it, the ""Opiate of the Masses"". We are vehemently opposed to the institutions of religion that seek only to gain profit from the faith of the workers. We seek to completely separate church and state.  The second is personal faith. Communists are not opposed to anyone having their own personal beliefs. We believe that during socialism, and it's progression into communism, religion will simply phase out for the most part in popularity. Communists do not discriminate against those who hold faith of any sort - only that faith is not a direct influence on the party's actions.  Anti-communists love to spout about communists seeking to ""abolish religion"", and to an extent this is true, since religion is indeed unscientific and irrational, but the means by which we seek to abolish it is over time, through education, not force.  So, to sum up:   Organised religion is bad because it is a tool of the bourgeoisie. Personal religion is fine, so long as it stays personal."

communism101,3aduuv,jdlashley,7,Fri Jun 19 08:56:52 2015 UTC,"Marxism was quite popular in Russia. However, due to bans on organizing parties and trade unions, a lot of it was underground. The one above ground strain of Marxism in pre-revolution Russia was Legal Marxism (a form of Marxism that usually focused solely on economic analysis and removed the revolutionary edge due to censorship). Socialist and radical populism were very popular amongst the peasantry, especially popular was the Narodnaya Volya party. Anarchism was also popular amongst intellectuals and some members of the peasantry due to the influence of the two great Russian anarchists, Bakunin and Kropotkin.   As for China, Marxism seemed to gain more popularity there after the October Revolution in Russia. Previously there was a lot of nationalist sentiment in China and some small anarchist groups, but Marxism was not even really on the radar there until after the May 4th Movement of 1919 and then the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921."
communism101,3aduuv,kc_socialist,6,Fri Jun 19 13:23:28 2015 UTC,"Marxism was very popular among Russian intellectuals since 1890s and there were translated more Marx and Engels works in Russian than into any other European language. However, since the revolution of 1905 was defeated, Marxism lost his former popularity and only the Bolshevik party remained true to the teachings of Marx. The Bolsheviks did an immense amount of work to bring Marxism to the workers and teach them the basic and advanced concepts of Marxist theory. During 1912-1914 when the revolutionary movement became strong again, the Bolshevik party won the majority in the working class, as it was shown by the elections in Duma (all seats for the workers were won by the Bolsheviks) and the popularity of their paper 'Pravda'. This is how the seeds for the future revolution in 1917 were sewn. The understanding of Marxism among other sections of the population, especially peasants, was very limited though. The Bolsheviks won peasants to their side only after the October revolution."

The Scandinavian states have Capitalist economies, they have Liberal democracies, and private property is constitutionally protected. The only thing that makes them seem socialist to outsiders are the free health care and education, the unemployment benefits, the high wages, the large public sector etc., all things that are good and well, but these are just successful left-wing policies — not Socialism.

communism101,3a6aqn,kirjatoukka,14,Wed Jun 17 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"Marxism-Leninism is a pathway to communism. Stalin believed that communism would be attacked and subverted or destroyed by imperialists and capitalists and therefore it was necessary to establish a state apparatus that was capable of defending the people from imperialist sabotage. This apparatus would remain until such time as it was no longer necessary at which point it would dismantle itself and establish communism.  In his address to Eighth Congress of Soviets of the U.S.S.R. Stalin described this arrangement as the ""lower phase"" of communism, and that the ""higher phase"" (as you described, a stateless  society) had not yet been achieved, but was something that should be worked towards.    But Soviet society has not yet reached the higher phase of Communism, in which the ruling principle will be the formula : ""From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs,"" although it sets itself the aim of achieving the higher phase of Communism in the future. Can our Constitution be based on the higher phase of Communism, which does not yet exist and which has still to be achieved?  No, it cannot, because for the U.S.S.R. the higher phase of Communism is something that has not yet been realized, and which has to be realized in the future. It cannot, if it is not to be converted into a program or a declaration of future achievements.     J V Stalin, On the Draft Constitution of the U.S.S.R    And I think we can say that Stalin was correct, USSR was attacked by fascists who wished to kill and enslave Russians, considering them sub-humans. Stalin's rapid industrialization, militarization, and strengthening of the state apparatus allowed the Soviet Union to resist this attack.  Before the war had even ended the USA had already drawn up plans to attack USSR, it's ""ally"" in the war against the Axis, and so began several decades of the Cold War.  So even though Stalin did not achieve communism, he built a socialist† state that was capable of surviving immense attempts to destroy it.  † I admit this depends on your definition of socialism. For me socialism refers to non-private ownership of the means of production, therefore I would consider state ownership to be socialist so long as the state represents the people. This is vastly different to an oligarchy or fascism where the state represents private interests of the financial elite."

communism101,3a6w9s,jakehmw,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"From what I've learned in my few months of studying Marxism, the state emerged due to economic inequality; it was the result of class struggle.   I'm not entirely sure if it originated after the agricultural revolution, but it would make sense.   Once people settled and could start producing their own crops and such, the market could rise and this created classes, and therefore, class struggle. The state is a tool for one class to express their class power; it's an outlet.   Later on, we had the birth of civilization and the remaining barbarism. When comparing the two, the main contrast is the 'barbaric' societies' lack of a state.   So that's why I conclude that the origin of the state is due to the 'free' market. (And I use the word 'free' very loosely)   My only question is: if this analysis is true, then how come these agrarian, 'barbaric' societies don't have a state? My guess would be organized religion is their substitute, but I'm not quite sure.   Hopefully someone much more knowledgeable on the subject can add to this."

The thing is, the capitalist class needs to exploit the working class to survive. All that means is that the pay the worker gets isn't all that they produce, the capitalist takes a bit. This system is obviously shitty to the workers, so there's a state, mainly the police, in order to make sure the current classes stay the way they are. So now we have multiple very unequal groups.

As capital becomes more heavily concentrated into the hands of the larger capitalists, the chances of small businesses succeeding decrease.  In Das Kapital, Marx discusses this concentration of capital and how it destroys entrepreneurship,    “The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities depends on the productiveness of labor, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller.”   The larger capitalist can afford better machinery, structures, and resources to aid him in his production efficiency and quality. Starting with little capital, the smaller capitalist is at a much greater struggle to equate himself to the larger capitalist and become successful. The only thing that slows monopolies in the short-term is reformist intervention in government. It doesn't cure it though. Corporations control the government as it's their way to express their class power. Just look at the decline in entrepreneurship and the middle class in the US as time goes on. There’s a steady decrease.   Now what happens to these smaller capitalists? They either become employed under the command of the larger capitalists or they wander the streets unemployed. Now what means do these workers or unemployed people have to achieve their earned success? Nothing. There is little liberty to chase personal dreams for those who are forced to work under the will of the capitalists and unquestionably none for those unemployed—a group of people expanded by free enterprise in the name of ‘personal freedom.’"

However, the best way to eliminate risk is to force someone to purchase you commodities. That has been done countless times in capitalism, primarily through the use of the state.  You also mentioned risk. Risk is the justification that the capitalists use to justify profits, but it is not the mechanism which creates profit.

It is the same with capitalism; the market doesn't require that there be heads of companies, but most companies operate that way.  The revolution, to which you allude, in its simplest terms, is just workers owning the things they need to do their work.

When we talk about the normal ""ecodefense"" activist, we normally are talking about the hardcore nature lover who is out to fight capitalism not to raise up the workers or solve social injustice or anything like that, but instead to preserve the environment (note: blanket statement from my own experience, not dialectical).   The truth of the matter though, is that capitalism is the problem, not ""green"" this or that. Green capitalism can not save the planet. Only socialism can distribute resources to make them last, and not waste on things like marketing or planned obsolescence.   In this, ecodefense meets the important criteria of fighting capitalism. It does not however provide any type of revolutionary unifying praxis, if you dont care about the environment the odds are you arent gonna join a revolutionary ecodefense group. Rather than unifying various oppressed groups suffering individual oppressions, it attempts to provide an umbrella that everyone should care about, which is not a good revolutionary line.   So I think that the end result is that ecodefense is a valid tactic, were we in a revolutionary setting ecodefense measures would certainly be employed to sabotage capital.

So I think that it makes more sense to say that, for example, white supremacy and capitalism each maintains and reproduces the other.  To speak on the Ferguson situation, yes, I don't think white supremacy can be fully abolished under capitalism. However, I think it's clear that, as white supremacy's material basis lies in colonialism and imperialism, this struggle is inextricably tied to class struggle.

And it's hard to sift though all the class essentialism within leftist analysis.   So class struggle is as contingent upon other types of struggle as they are upon it?   I believe so, although in the last instance, class struggle has the largest role in the trajectory of a social formation.   Does that mean if we were to somehow ""solve"" non-material struggles, then class struggle would end as well?   No. Until the contradiction between labor and capital is resolved, class antagonisms will persist. Also, and I'm not sure everyone holds the same analysis that I do, but I don't consider these other struggles to be non-material. Patriarchy has a material base in the division of labor, white supremacy has a material base in colonialism and imperialism, etc. Superstructurally, institutions and ideology maintain and reproduce these structures (i.e. racist sentiments reproduce white supremacy), but these struggles still have a real, material base.  To answer this question as well:   If we achieved socialism tomorrow, I'm not sure that would erase every social problem.   Your intuition is correct. I mean look, every socialist state ever has been homophobic. We have to attack every aspect of a social formation. Believing that revolutionizing the productive forces will solve everything is economic determinism, and that's shallow Marxism at best.  Hope all of that is clear"

They reject both crude marxists and idealist postmodernists.  Class gets raced and gendered, they argue, but they agree with Sakai in the claim that it's really all about class.  But also like Sakai, and the theoretical tradition behind Sakai (that includes Mao and Fanon), they are arguing for a better understanding of class conflict.  Social class has historically never been abstract, stripped naked of the drag of race, gender, nationality, etc.  Perhaps this is why Night-Vision will never be read alongside the more comfortable and academic theories of the McClintocks and Spivaks: it hasn't really been in, at least not for a long time, to say that class is the fundamental category––at least not amongst privileged academics.  Of course, Lee and Rover do not mean class in the simplistic manner promoted by early 20th century euro-marxism––not that anyone who snubs their nose at the word class would bother to read them long enough to figure out what they mean.   So why is it all about class for Lee and Rover?  Simple: in the real world every nation exists because of productive relations and there are people who own these relations and people who are owned:   ""Our primary question is who is the modern proletariat and what role does it play as a class?  The answer is simple: it is primarily women, children, and alien labor.  Those who are colonized.  The modern proletariat or industrial working class, which is both among the most oppressed and the most productive class that supports the structure of capitalist society by its labor, is not and has never been gender-neutral or nationally self-contained.  No matter how indignantly some men may scream at these words, this is a matter of historical record, of fact.""

Here, we're talking about the makeup of the proletariat as a whole. The proletariat as a whole is more likely to be male, more likely not to be white, more likely not to be in the First World, and so and so forth. If you take the average of all proletarians, then this average would tip towards the female/etc end of the scale. Any average, however, always leaves room for data points to the left and right of the central point. There definitely can be male proletarians, but they aren't quite as common.   Far be it from me to tell you what the ""truth"" is about the proletariat, but everything I've ever read on the subject insists that they are defined by their relationship to the means of production, not by their gender or age.

""Night Vision"" uses the term ""meta class"" to describe 'race', 'gender', and so on. Maybe that will help you visualise it. White supremacy came into being with the beginnings of capitalism and colonialism, and is reproduced today at a fundamental level through strict border enforcement/anti-immigrant politics and neocolonialism/imperialism -- these are economic phenomena. The structural position of 'white' within society has a different relationship to production than the position of 'black', because whites, in their exploitation/oppression of blacks as a whole, create the very concept of 'white' and 'black'. If you take any given white persyn, they're less likely to be proletarian than any given black persyn. And likewise, if you take any proletarian, they're disproportionately black compared to the average persyn. This is simply because the exploitation of black persyns by whites makes whites disproportionately labour aristocratic/petty-bourgeois/bourgeois. So no, we're not changing the definition of ""proletariat"" -- rather, we're pointing out that the position of ""proletarian"" is a social relation, and this social relation is mediated by other types of social relations like race, gender, et cetera.  Why do you say that 'race' and 'gender' are ""non-material"" phenomena as opposed to 'class'? This is probably the source of all the confusion."

Unlike the socialist states, South Korea had access to a much wealthier market whose main actors suffered little damage from WWII.

Its infusions of western capital, that we had been calling for since the 1950s, that were responsible It's true that a actual ""command"" economy run by entirely detached bureaucrats is ineffective, but a democratically planned economy where local control is in the hands of working people would function fine. All the solow model says is that, using the Cobb Douglas function, you see there are declining returns to capital or labor only being invested. As well, depreciation of capital will eventually prevent capital accumulation from continuing if all other things are held equal. Therefore for per capital production to increase you need an increase in the productivity of these factors, usually referred to as technology but theoretically it included allocation, tech, so on. Education can be added as a separate function of labor, although people going to college reduces the labor supply to people who are 22+. It is a bit convoluted as increased capital investment often also means improved efficiency and technology used. See the Cambridge Capital Controversy for the refutation of the Cobb Douglas model that this is based on.  What strikes me is that he seems to imply that the solow model says that a planned economy can't expand because it can't intensify production. And that is obviously something we disagree with. Workers in control of the workplaces will do more to improve production, technology will become an even greater outlet with greater risk capacity, wasted resources in retail and other unproductive labor will be reduced, and so on. The soviets were equipped for a siege, not to operate long term, but it can be done.

The problem with GDP is that it measures value captured rather than value produced.[1] The First World -- which is the metric any bourgeois ideologue uses -- can only achieve the level of wealth and growth it has because of cross-border value extraction (i.e., imperialism). That's not to say that the stagnation/revisionist era of the USSR wasn't also engaged in the exploitation of the Third World (it certainly was[2]), but it wasn't anywhere near the same level as the typical First World liberal-capitalist countries and not enough to reverse stagnation.

He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost.

PPW is a military-political strategy in conducting a war against a stronger and more organized military. I think it can certainly be used anywhere as a strategy if the conditions call for it. Since it requires a huge support from the population, particularly the peasant/petty-bourgeois farmers for supplies. It also requires a difficult to navigate terrain to remove the technological advantages of the stronger military.  I think there is a lot of serious strategy to be learned from it. However, it canot be mechanically applied. Nor, will armed struggle be universally necessary in all situations."
communism101,39l6tc,skyclerk,12,Fri Jun 12 14:34:56 2015 UTC,"So as others have said, communism is stateless, moneyless, classless, etc. So why aren't we there now? Obviously because we have a state. So why do we have a state? What is a state? So when humanity first started settling down and farming, people started building an economy off of slave labor. They needed special bodies of armed persons in order to enforce the new social classes: slave and slaveowner (there were others, like clergy, but these two formed the majority of the issues). Throughout history, no matter where agricultural people were, they developed this. It is a state, and forms of it have existed since then. So why does it exist? To enforce class contradictions, like slave/slaveowner or worker/capitalist. Now, the state is referred to as a dictatorship of the ruling class. The ancient state was a dictatorship of slaveowners, the feudal state was a dictatorship of the nobility, the neoliberal state is a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. So, obviously, the state is the obstacle between us and communism. So how do we get rid of it? FIRST we have to make everyone's relationship to production the same, which destroys class. Then the state no longer needs to exist, and it atrophies. Marxists assert that the working class is the first class tobe able to do this. We are at a technological point where if everyone were a worker, society would still function. So what we need as a ""transition"" state to end all states is a dictatorship of the proletariat. Now, realistically, the working class is heavily oppressed and doesn't have the time or access to become experts on revolutionary theory. But that's the thing, we don't need the entire class to be. We just need a few ""professional revolutionaries"" to lead the rest. This is what the vanguard is: the forefront of the working class from the working class, for the working class. Anarchists and a lot of left-communists hate the idea of a vanguard because they don't see the necessity of leadership to a movement. What I told you is the basis of Marxism-Leninism."

People tend to feel uncomfortable with those ""extreme"" options; they prefer to fall somewhere in the comfortable middle. David Mitchell (comedian, not author) has a bit where he says that if there were a debate on the news in which a doctor argues that nobody should eat any bees, and a madman argues that everybody should eat a quart of live bees every day, that most people would come to the conclusion that maybe they should eat a handful of live bees now and again.

They settle for complacency. They convince themselves that hey, maybe the injustices are actually better for mankind. They convince themselves that their past enthusiasm about solving social issues was just an ""edgy phase."" They convince themselves that their acceptance is a sign of maturity.

Many would argue that the goal of communism is to provide free, reliable, easily accessible healthcare to ALL.   So, with that in mind, lets take in the situation. Its the early 50s, maybe gettin into the late 50s. China is OVER RUN with disease. From malaria, to tuberculosis, plague, cholera, polio, malaria, smallpox, and hookworms. Roughly 10.5 million people were infected with the water-borne liver parasite schistosomiasis. Cholera epidemics raged through the population freely, some years killing tens of thousands. Infant mortality was as high as 300 per 1000 live births.   You are the communist government in power. You have to figure out how to bring good health to remote, agricultural areas which have in some cases literally never seen a modern doctor. You have next to no resources to train/procure a large well of doctors willing to go into the countryside. Not only that, but at the same time health efforts are being held back by lack of basic infrastructure like roads and bridges. And on top of that, your country has been plagued by famine for hundreds of years. So what do you do?  You initiate a revolutionary program to solve these problems. You tell the people to take steps to improve their own health. You kill the disease carriers. You kill the destroyers of food. For the very first time in modern history China was in a place to have both the organizational logistics, the manpower, the dedication, and the support, to actually try to substantively change the plight of Chinese rural farmers. Think about that. For the very first time, the health and well being of Chinese rural workers was made of PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE by the Chinese government (though one might argue that fighting the landowners was the first time).    And so the people listened. They tried to better their lives, and the lives of their countrymen by destroying that which was causing so much hardship to the Chinese people. And you know what? They did it. They tried so hard they caused a disaster. They followed through on a revolutionary program aimed to directly make the lives of them and their fellows better, and unfortunately it backfired. You ask, ""How could they not know this would happen?"". Well, environmental science as an academic discipline didnt really emerge until a good 10 years after The Great Leap Forward, so tell me where the experts are to warn about the consequences? The Four Pests campaign is only a failure due to it actually being a failure, its not a failure of initiative, organization, or commitment by the people. It shows how powerful the people can be when we work together, albeit to our own folly.   To me, if anything, it is an important lesson in ensuring that practice follows scientific reality. A failure of proper scientific understanding? Yes. But a failure of communism? Never."
communism101,39en0c,Fuimofue,6,Thu Jun 11 05:37:14 2015 UTC,"The state arises out of contradictions in class society, as a tool of class oppression. So yes, as long as class exists, the state, in some form or another, will exist. State doesn't necessarily mean government or law-keepers or whatever. It really is just the mechanism of class oppression. Because of this, some leftists, mostly Marxist and Marxist-Leninists, believe in a ""transitional socialist state"" based on Marx's quote in Critique of the Gotha Program ""Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing, but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.""  After this we get into a Whole Bunch Of Bullshit as I like to call it.

communism101,39en0c,ccommunist,2,Thu Jun 11 09:50:54 2015 UTC,"The state is a tool of class oppression. Once classes vanish, the state will also cease to exist, right?   Yes.  Does this mean that once we get to Socialism and there both bourgeois and proletariat no longer exist, the state also ceases to exist?   Yes.  Does the organization continue to exist just without being a state?  Because the organization is so coloured by class struggle, I guess it can exist without it but it might be pretty much unrecognizable.  Without a state, how do you enforce rules?  So lets say even before full communism, a member of the proletariat breaks a rule (idk, they burn down their neighbour's house). Do you think we NEED specifically the bourgeoisie to rain down on them or could, in theory, the proletariat could deal with it. No state involved. So looking at the same scenario in full communism, it's clear that it doesn't require a state.  Will the abolition of money come before or after the abolition of the state/class?  I think slightly before.  What are the main differences between Marxists and Anarchist Communists other than Anarchists rejecting the state?  Because anarchists have rejected the state for like 200 years, they read and write their own books and based on this one early distinction, their body of literature is totally different from ours. So their entire theory of the state, ideology, imperialism, leadership, mass work, pretty much everything is different.  You both have the same end goal, right?  yeah basically. But that's kind of silly because the end goal is so far away. A religious group that prays for a utopia more or less also believes in a classless stateless society, but it doesn't seem that anarchists, socialists, and utopian religious groups all have the same goal with a slightly different methodology,  Can you be an Anarchist and believe in a transition state?

It want until the 80's socialist states viewed the environment as something to deal with.   3) Allow more self determination. People in Warsaw pact nations felt they were ruled by a new Russian Empire as did some Soviet peoples, especially Baltic and Caucasus ones. There should be a better way to accommodate cultural needs without risking the nation splintering. Lenin talked about that a lot and the socialist nations were actually pretty good at keeping ethnic tensions suppressed.   4) More worker control and participation on the job. The Soviet Union was a state socialist nation and its state socialist model was exported to every other socialist nation in the 20th century except Yugoslavia. To this day worker co-ops still exist in the Balkans and helped produce a higher living standard for them than most other East European peoples. A combination of market socialism and state socialism would probably be better than just state socialism. It would also help move towards the withering away of the state faster.  5) Try to be more democratic. I've heard Khrushchev wanted to experiment with having multiple members of the CPSU run in elections as opposed to democratic centralism. More referendums would be nice, the USSR only ever had one. Unions were somewhat marginalized and should have more power.   No nation is perfect. The Soviet Union was the first socialist state in world history, they got some things wrong but proved socialism can work(and even be effeicnet) so long as you have effective planners committed to communism. They also proved socialism can become stagnate and inefficient so there is a lot to learn from 74 years of Soviet history and  even with market socialist reforms Cuba is still mostly state socialist so we can learn from that as well."

communism101,3998fv,Post_Capitalist,3,Wed Jun 10 05:20:42 2015 UTC,"Economic historian Robert C Allen authored a book called ""Farm to Factory"" a reassessment of Soviet development. He challenged the popular notion that the Soviet Union had a failed economy, going so far as to say it was the 2nd most successful developing nation in the 20th century, behind only Japan. Things he points out include that the Russian Empires economic development was mostly tethered to a global wheat boom that crashed and was therefore not a sustainable path for the Czars to pursue.   According to him 1928-1970 the Soviet Union was ridiculously successful at developing but that saying around 1970 they stagnated do to poor planning. He points at things like bad investment strategies, overvaluing military research and developing low yield resources. Before his book came out most scholars pegged the era of stagnation as having been in 1972.    His book received mixed, though mostly positive reviews. Most economic historians and even critics of socialism admitted socialism worked, although they all continue to reject socialism as a viable alternative to the market. Robert C Allen isn't a socialist either and does't support socialism, he just researched it.   Heres a summary of his arguments.   http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/noticeboard/bergson/allen.pdf"

Now I'm sure a good amount of that was propaganda, but if they were the 2nd most successful developing country at that time, why were they not able to provide the ideal living conditions that communism promises? I've read a decent amount of first hand accounts on how, for example, you had to stand in line for 3 hours just to get some bread. Or that the shelves in stores were almost always empty.

communism101,3998fv,otherfuentesbrother,7,Wed Jun 10 05:49:18 2015 UTC,"I once read an article from the late 80's stating that the USSR had a poverty rate of about 20%, compared to 16% for America. Mostly this was in places like Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan which were the least developed part of the country from its very inception.    but if they were the 2nd most successful developing country at that time, why were they not able to provide the ideal living conditions that communism promises?   The Soviet union was very far behind the developed world from its beginning. It's like how modern 3rd world countries might experience a few years of massive GD growth, they will still be incredibly poor and far behind the developed countries. To this day much of the former Soviet Union(and even places in Eastern Europe) are still considered 3rd world even with 20+ years of capitalism.    I've read a decent amount of first hand accounts on how, for example, you had to stand in line for 3 hours just to get some bread. Or that the shelves in stores were almost always empty. Was this true for most people?   This was definitely not true for most people. At least not until the late 80's when things started breaking down and people in large cities started experiencing this. My family never had a problem with getting food until after the collapse of the Soviet Union.   Some of my best educated(mathematicians, engineers, physicists) family members were living on a few pieces of bread and water everyday in the 90's as were there friends. This was in Georgia one of the major agricultural republics in the Soviet Union. This is one of the reason why birthrates collapse around the time, it was too hard to keep having children."

Honestly, this is something that has been a major black spot on the record of a lot of communist countries.  It is not an issue unique to communism, but that doesn't justify it.  I would hope that it would be somewhat mitigated by being more democratic. *Greater government transparency.  This is really crucial for any democracy.    Personally, I think that the Communist movement on the whole has been somewhat deficient when it comes to theorizing about the forms that government should take.  To give credit where credit it due, this is what many liberal and Enlightenment philosophers like Locke and Rousseau have excelled at.  They proposed real outlines for what they thought a state should look like and how it would its form would impact how it functioned.

Cuba: With enough dedication and by adapting to new situations, a socialist state can survive some of the worst political conditions in the modern world.

In the case of C-M-C, the money functions as a means of purchase because the end-goal is consumption, or use-value. There is no quantitative difference in value (well, there could be, but that's beside the point) yet there is a qualitative difference in use-value. Namely, your commodity which is a non-use-value to yourself is sold in order to buy a commodity which has a use-value to you.  In the case of M-C-M, however, there is no qualitative difference between your start and end points. They're both money. And if we're just getting the same amount of money at the end that we put in at the beginning, we're only putting our original money at risk in circulation. Therefore, we must make an additional amount of money (""surplus-value""). This makes the general formula of capital M-C-M' (where M' = M + ΔM). Money is capital here because it serves to increase its own value through circulation."
communism101,393cdc,anarchoqueer,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:43:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Though I get that part. Maybe my question is too specific and really misses the forest for the trees here. But I'm trying to see how Marx traces the emergence of the M-C-M formulation (historically and/or logically) back to the C-M-C circulation by way of credit and money's function as a ""means of payment"" as opposed to a ""means of purchase"".  Not quite sure why the existence of creditor/debtor relations begets a form of circulation wherein  ""the value-form of the commodity, money, has now become the self-sufficient purpose of the sale"" (Capital)."
communism101,393cdc,anarchoqueer,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:50:49 2015 UTC,"There's a really great line in that chapter that goes like   This contradiction between the quantitative limitation and the qualitative lack of limitation of money keeps driving the hoarder back to his Sisyphean task: accumulation. He is in the same situation as a world conqueror, who discovers a new boundary with each country he annexes.   And essentially, with the two equivalents (money and commodity) not being exchanged simultaneously, the money doesn't allow you to gain access to the use-value/consumption, it repays your consumption. The money doesn't help move circulation around in this case, it ends circulation. Therefore the money acts as a horde. It is the change from ""selling in order to buy"" to ""buying in order to sell"". We are, in the former case, desiring use-value; in the latter, exchange-value."
communism101,393cdc,swims_with_the_fishe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I loved that line. So lets say I buy a house for which I'll pay in 10 years. What part of the ""metamorphosis"" was that? M-C? I got a commodity but I didn't pay for it...yet. Was the promise of future payment enough for the money-commodity to ""transform"" into the body of the house? If so I see how that makes sense. And so in the meantime I am hoarding the money, right? So that I can pay it all back in the future. So far so good I am sacrificing present consumption by not allowing my money to re-enter circulation.  Then when the payment finally falls due how has that completed the cycle of M-C-M?   With C-M-C it was easy to see the transformation of forms. My commodity seams to turn into money when I sell it (C-M) and then the money turns into some other commodity when I purchase something else (M-C). But what in the above scenario of simple exchange between a debtor and creditor transformed? Did I start with money (M) and buy a house (C) and sell it for money (M)==>(M-C-M)? No I started with money or the promise of money (M) and bought a house (C). That's it. Where the other side of the circuit? The C-M?"
communism101,393cdc,AllPowerToTheSoviets,2,Tue Jun 9 01:23:12 2015 UTC,it ends a m-c because you are not using money as capital. if a worker uses their wages to buy a house to live in then this is not what marx is talking about. if you are the owner of a construction company then you are using M to buy house C then selling C to get M+. (M+= M+increase in value.)  this would be the surplus value created by the builders. and completes the M-C-M
communism101,393cdc,Aserong,2,Tue Jun 9 12:43:07 2015 UTC,Thanks. I was looking at it from the wrong side of the exchange. It's the seller who will be engaging in M-C-M circulation (once we introduce capital into the equation).
communism101,393cdc,Aserong,2,Tue Jun 9 15:29:52 2015 UTC,"I am currently reading Capital, although it is going very slow because of high school exams. I found chapter 3 to be significantly harder than the following chapters. His argument gets a lot easier to follow. I am not sure if I understand it correctly but these are my thoughts. When I buy a house, then it is C-M-C. I just get the commodity, the house, before I pay for it. So in real time we start with the -C and then C-M happens afterwards. I can do this because I represent the ability to create money in the future by selling the commodities produced by my labor. So the form of circulation is C-M-C although it does not look like it. How does this look from the creditor's perspective? For him the form of circulation is M-C-M. He starts with money and then buys the labour-power of workers. He does this in order to get the use-value of labour-power, which is a house. He then sells the house to me, who represent the promise of money in the future. The only reason the creditor has for doing this is that he believes he will end up with more money than he started with and the next chapters will explain how that is possible even though equivalents are being traded."
communism101,393c7s,wilsonh915,10,Mon Jun 8 23:26:03 2015 UTC,"The social relationship between individuals in the circulation, production, and use of a commodity is one side of its status. Is it being used to funfill the need of others, or is it being created to fulfill ones own need in exchange?   Another side of it is how does a commodity fulfill human use? A factory produces things for use but itself does not fulfill a human use. A jacket only fulfills a single human's use.  Using both of these you can see a full analysis of a situation is needed to understand if something is private or personal property.  Generally, personal property fulfills a specific, individual need. Private property produces the commodities that meet human need.  A single item could be both. Imagine if I bake cookies in my house. If I sell those cookies my oven was functioning as private property. If give those cookies to my daughter for her enjoyment then it was personal property. The lesson to draw is that it is NOT an essential quality unique to the material, but rather an understanding of the social relationship of the commodity."

Tangentially, and don't feel obligated to answer, what if the community decides that art should be consumed by the masses and that we would be better off if this drawing were displayed in a gallery rather than kept by a single person."

If you draw a picture and put it on your wall, it's personal property. If the community decides that it should be consumed by the masses and the artist wants to keep it on their wall, then tough titties, its personal property.  The artist only becomes an artist through the labor of others. The piece of paper was made by somebody else. If they made the paper themselves, they are taking it from public natural resources, because nobody can (well, should) own something endowed by nature itself. The artist was taught by others the techniques of different styles and was influenced by other art. If the artist gains nothing in doing so besides their own gratification (chalk it up to the paper fulfilling a personal need), there isn't a problem--it's personal property. If the artist begins making money on it, then there is a problem, because the artist is not responsible for the labor needed to produce it."

The easiest way in my opinion would be to consider means of production only the things allocated to enterprises for productive activities, with stuff like paper used to produce a poem being your own self-created property.   Erich Fromm has a useful distinction between the various characters of property:  ""Aside from private property, there are: self-created  property, which is exclusively the result of one's own work; restricted property, which is restricted  by the obligation to help one's fellow beings;  functional, or personal, property, which consists either of tools for work or of objects for enjoyment;  common  property, which a group shares in the spirit of a common bond"""

Now, there are in certain ways limits to this--there are some truly huge machines that technically only require one operator. But then, on the other hand, the use of these huge machines makes no sense outside the context of a team of people, so again the distinction is still useful.  There are blurrier things. An ""an""cap talking to me on reddit the other day was wringing his hands about whether a riding lawnmower was personal or private property.  Well, to be honest, I would want riding lawnmowers socialized so that anyone in a neighborhood could make use of them. But from an even bigger perspective, I think lawns are a foolish and bourgeois concept, so what good is a riding lawnmower going to be anyway when we start on the work of abolishing the lawn?  And so a lot of the bigger tools we might think of as being ""on the line"" between personal and private property will likely be rendered less relevant or useful as we head toward communism. We communists recognize that the atomization of domestic labor (the fact that the labor of keeping up of bodies, living spaces, and personal effects is tucked, inefficiently and privately, into billions of separate dwellings) is part of what contributes to the oppression of nonmen as well as helping perpetuate a more bourgeois mindset. So as we socialize domestic labor (e.g., move toward community kitchens and socialized laundry), we'll find fewer and fewer ""borderline"" cases (like consumer-level laundry machines and riding lawnmowers, which could technically be used to run small businesses).  Edit: I also want to encourage you to always check to see whether your questions may already have been addressed by searching the subreddit for key terms.

Here and there, some detail might be improved. The practical application of the principles will depend, as the Manifesto itself states, everywhere and at all times, on the historical conditions for the time being existing, and, for that reason, no special stress is laid on the revolutionary measures proposed at the end of Section II. That passage would, in many respects, be very differently worded today. In view of the gigantic strides of Modern Industry since 1848, and of the accompanying improved and extended organization of the working class, in view of the practical experience gained, first in the February Revolution, and then, still more, in the Paris Commune, where the proletariat for the first time held political power for two whole months, this programme has in some details been antiquated."

Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.  It will be a marvellous thing – the true personality of man – when we see it. It will grow naturally and simply, flowerlike, or as a tree grows. It will not be at discord. It will never argue or dispute. It will not prove things. It will know everything. And yet it will not busy itself about knowledge. It will have wisdom. Its value will not be measured by material things. It will have nothing. And yet it will have everything, and whatever one takes from it, it will still have, so rich will it be. It will not be always meddling with others, or asking them to be like itself. It will love them because they will be different. And yet while it will not meddle with others, it will help all, as a beautiful thing helps us, by being what it is. The personality of man will be very wonderful. It will be as wonderful as the personality of a child.  It proposes to do away with poverty and the suffering that it entails. It desires to get rid of pain, and the suffering that pain entails. It trusts to Socialism and to Science as its methods. What it aims at is an Individualism expressing itself through joy. This Individualism will be larger, fuller, lovelier than any Individualism has ever been. Pain is not the ultimate mode of perfection. It is merely provisional and a protest. It has reference to wrong, unhealthy, unjust surroundings. When the wrong, and the disease, and the injustice are removed, it will have no further place. It will have done its work. It was a great work, but it is almost over. Its sphere lessens every day.  Nor will man miss it. For what man has sought for is, indeed, neither pain nor pleasure, but simply Life. Man has sought to live intensely, fully, perfectly. When he can do so without exercising restraint on others, or suffering it ever, and his activities are all pleasurable to him, he will be saner, healthier, more civilised, more himself. Pleasure is Nature’s test, her sign of approval. When man is happy, he is in harmony with himself and his environment. The new Individualism, for whose service Socialism, whether it wills it or not, is working, will be perfect harmony. It will be what the Greeks sought for, but could not, except in Thought, realise completely, because they had slaves, and fed them; it will be what the Renaissance sought for, but could not realise completely except in Art, because they had slaves, and starved them. It will be complete, and through it each man will attain to his perfection. The new Individualism is the new Hellenism."

communism101,38xh4l,Blackbelt54,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:04:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, so let me preface by saying that, especially in the West, my analysis is not particularly orthodox, outside of certain Marxist-Leninist circles. I hope that some Maoists etc. also contribute to this thread so that you see multiple analyses, because there are many. I’m of the opinion that the USSR was a fundamentally socialist state right up until the late 80s, and I’m not entirely convinced that China is a capitalist country.  To think that revisionism, what is largely a proletarian loss on the ideological front of class antagonisms, can silently alter the class character of a state doesn’t make much sense to me. And I think you are seeing that, as you realize that if the same logic applied to socialist formations was applied to capitalist ones, then reformism should work, because, it’s only a matter of time before the proletariat covertly takes control of the state without changing the character of its apparati, right?  This sort of thinking places primacy on motion, rather than analyzing a social formation as matter in motion. It’s a linear way to look at what the DotP is, as if an unbroken path to communism is even possible in the real world. It ignores the gravitational inertia that comes with a given social formation, or at the least applies it to socialism in a very different way than to capitalism. It strangely maintains that socialism can be reformed away from because of ideological missteps. We can’t categorize a social formation by individuals in power and their own personal convictions and policies, but rather by the state structure that they occupy. And once we agree that a state is a DotP, I sure as hell don’t think it’s going to become capitalist without a qualitative break as the bourgeoisie smashes the proletarian state apparatus and erects their own.  So then, if the USSR was to be capitalist under Khrushchev, the state would have had to fundamentally change class character. A state, with all its apparati of reinforcement, both legal and extra-legal, economic and political, ideological and repressive, is a massive social structure. I think that to believe that electing a few officials could fundamentally smash the proletarian state is an idealist way to look at things. It places individuals over structures and it champions ideological class warfare as a sufficient “cause” to break a state, seemingly without any fundamental changes in dominant economic logic or political apparati.  I think we all can agree that reformism doesn’t work, but if we’re in the frame of mind that socialism can be toppled without a qualitative break, where the proletarian state is smashed, I think we have to let the analysis lead itself to its natural conclusion that reformism could work in a capitalist formation.  I’d recommend reading Is the Red Flag Flying? by Albert Szymanski and this essay to understand in-depth the argument that the Soviet Union was still socialist. Additionally, I’d recommend this and this for articles on China. Also this article is great.  Again, my analysis is one of many and I hope others use this opportunity to show the breadth of thought on the revisionism question. I can’t emphasize enough that there are many analyses on this topic, and mine is only one (and perhaps a minority one at that). I hope this was helpful, and I can try to elaborate on points if people think I wasn’t clear.  EDIT: I wanted to add, that this isn't to say that it's easy for a socialist formation to remain so (obviously in the face of global capitalism, it certainly proves difficult), I'm just saying that a change in fundamental state class character has to happen in order for a socialist formation to reach a full capitalist restoration"

Third Worldism, on the other hand, is a general ethos shaping political projects which sees the fault-line in the global capitalist order as being between the Euroamerican-driven metropolis of the First World and the impoverished continents of the Third World, and sees the emancipation of the Third World through national liberation as the principal means to abolish worldwide capitalism.

It should be noted that the popularization of using the two terms together, Maoism + Third Worldism, came after the collapse of the original MIM centralized organization, and it was an attempt distance from MIM as well as a claim to have achieved a higher level of Marxist science. In other words, some were promoting Maoism Third Worldism as the fourth stage. We were critical of this at the time.  The MIM has always seen Maoism as inherently Third Worldist in orientation, and our class analysis is just the application of Marx/Engels and maybe some help from Lenin, nothing new.

communism101,38vemu,jakehmw,8,Sun Jun 7 03:56:29 2015 UTC,"Racism stems from class antagonisms. From Zak Cope's ""Divided World Divided Class"":  ""The systematic representation of explicitly racist doctrine was also decisively lacking in Medieval Europe. For the 5th century Christian theologian St. Augustine, the means of uniting and administering all of the various cultures and civilisations of the world was conversion to Christianity and the vehicle of that conversion was to be the jurisprudential institutions of the Roman Catholic Church.  However, Christianity proved very capable of fomenting myriad religious, national and ethnic chauvinisms. For Political Science and History professor Anthony Pagden, the process of consolidating the Europeans identity as the most superior example of humanity on the planet, and thus the birth of the racist dogma perse, can be split into two temporal stages: the colonisation of the Americas between 1492 and the 1730s, and thereafter the occupation of Asia, Africa and the Pacific up to the period after the Second World War. Similarly, according to Native American Legal scholar Robert Williams’ examination of Papal encyclicals relating to the conquest of the Americas, the thesis of white supremacy initially gestated in theological distinctions between heathens and believers. Where missionary zeal provided ideological justification for the early Iberian colonisation of the Americas, Native American conversion to Christianity might ultimately annul colonial claims to land and labour. As such, the necessity of totally subjugating the indigenous populations of Latin America was the vehicle for the Spanish Catholic power’s relinquishing the earlier religion-based ideology of its purportedly “civilizing” project and replacing it with conceptions of the immutable inhumanity of the indigenous American population. Although the Spanish crown and the Catholic church rejected the more outright protoracist apologetics of the conquistadores vis-á-vis the Indian population, fearing that a settler-colonial population enriched by purely localized superexploitation might ultimately prove a disloyal partner, the indigenous population’s limited and dwindling numbers (having been exterminated or overworked and/or having succumbed to the new diseases imported by the Europeans), alongside their ability to escape from servitude, ensured that a new source of slave labour would have to be found. Since Europeans could not be enslaved without provoking serious political and military conflicts with other European powers—and without discouraging European settlement of the Americas—and Asians were too far away, the Spanish turned to the enslavement of the peoples of the west coast of Africa.  The subsequent capitalist enslavement of Africans, particularly by the more consciously capitalistic Protestant planters of North America who completely dispensed with any religious justification for colonialism and slavery, became the bedrock upon which the entire racial Weltanschauung was founded. Racism, in turn, assured the continued economic ascendency of all sections of “white” society over the superexploited and, hence, totally marginalised non-white populace. Pioneering world-systems theorist Immanuel Wallerstein suggests that race denotes an international status group inseparable from the fact of global white supremacy. Unlike ethnocentrism, a form of inward-looking narrow-mindedness shared by members of culturally distinct human groups, racism is the ideological correlate of hierarchical privilege aligned with phenotypical dissimilarity on a global scale: “Western supremacy, racism and burgeoning capitalism are originally synonymous. Perceptions of “racial” distinctions amongst Europeans, whilst not entirely disappearing (particularly in the Irish case and, later, as Nazi capitalism advanced), dwindled as the political gap between the white colonizer and the non-white colonised widened and as Europe began to confront the peripheral economic zone as an oppressor. In short, racist theory was first developed by European colonialists confronting the “darker nations” of the Third World as objects for perpetual exploitation and oppression.   Racism must be distinguished from xenophobia which is the attempt to reject the perceived social intrusion of a foreign people. Xeno-racism, meanwhile, is where an oppressor nation, or a member of an oppressor nation, attempts to maintain colonial dominion by attempting to physically exclude members of a subject population from its own borders. Contemporary scholars have detected a shift from pseudo-scientific racism to a new, less biologistic, form of culturalist racism which articulates allegedly natural hierarchies amongst humans in a new way. The late British sociologist Ruth Frankenberg, who helped develop the academic field of so-called “whiteness studies”, distinguished between the older “essentialist” racism, emphasising “race” difference understood in hierarchical terms of essential, biological inequality, and the current discourse of “colour-blindness,” “a colour-evasive and power-evasive” language that asserts “we are all the same under the skin.” In ignoring the “structural and institutional dimensions of racism,” this discourse implies that “any failure to achieve is therefore the fault of people of colour themselves” since “materially, we have the same chances in US society” as whites. US Sociology professor Jeffrey Prager has shown that in the same way slavery was legitimated by beliefs about the essential inhumanity of blacks, “the conception of the cultural distinctiveness of blacks today serves to explain and thereby tolerate a largely divided American society.” Neo-racism, couched in culturalist, as opposed to biologistic, terminology becomes dominant in the era of neocolonialism and in the West it is born from the Cold War ideological competition between the USA and the USSR. French Marxist philosopher, Etienne Balibar argues that new forms of racism (mainly centred on the so-called “immigration complex”) fit into a framework of “racism without races’,” a post-colonial racism based not on pseudo-scientific biological gradations of humanity, but on the supposed insurmountability of hypostatized cultural differences. This differentialist or culturalist racism tends to naturalise human behaviour and social affinities like the older racism. While the latter certainly lives on in racist polemics such as the pseudo-science peddled by US writer Charles Murray and his followers, the demise of colonialism and the advent of global neocolonialism renders the culturalist narrative a much sharper instrument for co-opting and legitimating Third World bourgeois elites, explaining away the ethnicised political struggles of global imperialism as “natural” and inevitable outpourings of mass (cultural) psychology."""

Below is an answer by /u/arjun10:   I think there are two obvious reasons to be ""against"" trans-humanism in a capitalist system.  First, only the wealthy and privileged will have access to such technologies (or, at best, populations living in the First World, imperialist nations), and be able to accumulate even more power--possibly at the expense of the rest of the population.  And indeed, given that trans-humanism is a direct augmentation of the human body and psyche, this type of acceleration in inequality could very well create an extremely rigid caste system, and all the inter-caste violence that comes along with caste systems.    Second, if private entities motivated purely by profit control augmentation technologies, there is absolutely no guarantee that such technologies will actually benefit people (especially the general public).  Think about the pharmaceutical industry and their marginal improvements on existing drugs without investing in massive improvements, or the tobacco industries funding of science to skew the health debate.  Despite corporate propaganda casting augmentation like this, where people are able to live better, fuller lives, it is likely that a scenario like this happens instead, where IP laws and corporate control leads to systems of servitude.  (Both of those clips were on the universe of the video game Dues Ex: Human Revolution.    In a communist society, however, I think human augmentation could be pretty fucking sweet, and something to definitely develop (responsibly!).  I can't think any good reasons to oppose trans-humanism in a communist society."

The quality of having a use-value is usefulness and is created through concrete human labor. Commodities are traded from their owners to whom the commodity is a non-use-value to buyers to whom the commodity is a use-value.  Use-value is also qualitative, whereas the other sorts of value Marx mentions in Ch. 1 of Capital (namely, exchange-value and value aka socially necessary labor time) are quantitative.  So use-value is just the capacity to which the object is able to fulfill a human need and it is only realized in the act of consumption. Commodities are use-values to some people and non-use-values to others.  As for your second question, while I have no personal experience with learning them via this manner, I would be very skeptical of it. If you're looking to really understand Marx's economics, check out some of his shorter works like Wage Labor and Capital and Value, Price and Profit.

Ehh, no big or super organized ones yet, that I know of   What does it mean when someone says that race is the principal issue in the United States?   I think what they mean is that the black liberation struggle against the US's white supremacist colonialism/imperialism has more revolutionary conditions than, say, the general working class movement. I think some could even argue that until the black nation in the US is liberated from US imperialism, a working class movement would be difficult or even impossible.   Does there exist strategies for addressing the race issue within the United States?   I'd say the Black Lives Matter movement doesn't have a fully united agenda yet, but some transitional goals that have been talked about would include things like community police review boards, or ending police occupation of black communities.   Should white people form ally organizations instead of joining black political organizations?   I think that's for black people in the movement to decide, honestly.

So right now, the white settler nation is dominant in the U.S., and the internal oppressed nations (New Afrika, Aztlan, Boriqua, First Nations) are the force they are in contradiction with.

I don't agree, but it take balls to write this post and call down the wrath of post-war Marxism on your own head. :)  You should have asked if fiat money might not just mean money itself has been destroyed by capitalism. Capital hates money even though it begins and ends with money.  Now what happens when capital hates the thing that posits it beginning and ending? How does it abolish the thing without abolishing itself? The solution to the riddle of fiat money is that it is the abolition of money within the money form itself.  Fiat money is in reality the money form stripped of its real material content. Fiat money prefigures the actual abolition of money itself. Beside a class that is no longer a class in historical materialism, we have money that is no longer money -- and both products of modern society.  These two suggest the existence of something that has no expression in post-Keynesian economics: Labor that no longer produces anything. Only labor theory -- specifically Marx's labor theory -- predicts labor that produces nothing, i.e., labor for which fiat money is the only real expression of the value of its product.  --Jehu"""
communism101,38mbex,Bosco_Sauce,2,Mon Jun 22 03:26:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the links. This has been a very interesting discussion to plunge into.   And that is the real mystery of the post-gold standard world — the one which LK is trying to uncover with his argument. How can the law of value operate if prices do not have any relation to values or the socially necessary labor time required for production of commodities? To ask the question almost answers it: The gold standard is abolished precisely to prevent the prices of commodities from reflecting their values.   I think this overall trajectory of Jehu's response to LK is correct. The basic insight here is that fiat currency is a fix for the problems inherent in value-form-determined production (and it is just one of many fixes). That said, I think Jehu reaches some conclusions that are unwarranted by the facts/*.  The main one is the suggestion that the value-form is somehow suspended or ""supressed"" by the advent of the fiat money regime. Now, I don't disagree with the notion that a fiat regime represents a qualitative shift in capitalism, but the idea that included in that shift is a qualitative difference in how the values of commodities are expressed in the market seems premature. This, of course, is based on the fact that Jehu accepts LK's incorrect understanding of Marx's theory of money.   For Marx, fiat is not and never was money. It is a token of money. This is critical, because Marx never argues in Capital that fiat currency had to be a commodity; he said money had to be a commodity. While LK and the MELT Marxists insist fiat currency is money; Marx insisted fiat was only a token of money, a placeholder (if you will) for money itself in circulation. While a token of money is not money, commodity money could itself enter circulation and function as a token of itself. Money could directly fill the function of currency in its own bodily form, but a mere paper token, like fiat currency, could never be money.   LK had argued that, because Marx thought money had to have value, and fiat money has no value by Marx's definition of value, that Marx's theory of value has to be suspended. Jehu responds by saying that of course fiat money has no value, but that's because it's not money, but rather symbols designed to ""supress"" the value of commodities. Their implementation is explained by the fact that money, as opposed to currency, allows for the full expression of capitalist contradictions of production and value-accumulation.  This is an overly convoluted answer. We don't need to contort Marx nearly so much to find a fairly workable account of fiat money.   The main distortion here is the assertion that symbolic money is not money, and expressor of value, but rather currency, purely symbolic tokens with no connection to the value-form (hence my use of the phrase ""fiat money"" and not ""fiat currency"" to highlight my intent). Reading Chapter 3 myself, I do not get the sense that this was Marx's view (and of course, even if it was that doesn't necessarily put us in the bind that LK's biblical literalism reading of Marx does).   The fact that the currency of coins itself effects a separation between their nominal and their real weight, creating a distinction between them as mere pieces of metal on the one hand, and as coins with a definite function on the other — this fact implies the latent possibility of replacing metallic coins by tokens of some other material, by symbols serving the same purposes as coins.   In other words, the advent of metallic commodities as currency immediately introduces a gulf between the specific labor-character of the coin qua commodity metal and its special role as a universal measure of value. The symbolic character of money is inherent in the money-form itself, as indicated by the ""latent possibility"" of symbolic replacement.  The expression of this latent possibility in actual money symbols merely develops this contradictory character of money even further:   The weight of metal in the silver and copper tokens is arbitrarily fixed by law. When in currency, they wear away even more rapidly than gold coins. Hence their functions are totally independent of their weight, and consequently of all value. The function of gold as coin becomes completely independent of the metallic value of that gold. Therefore things that are relatively without value, such as paper notes, can serve as coins in its place. This purely symbolic character is to a certain extent masked in metal tokens. In paper money it stands out plainly.  We allude here only to inconvertible paper money issued by the State and having compulsory circulation. It has its immediate origin in the metallic currency. Money based upon credit implies on the other hand conditions, which, from our standpoint of the simple circulation of commodities, are as yet totally unknown to us. But we may affirm this much, that just as true paper money takes its rise in the function of money as the circulating medium, so money based upon credit takes root spontaneously in the function of money as the means of payment.   If that isn't enough, Marx himself anticipates the objections surrounding symbolic money and addresses them directly:   [S]ome one may ask why gold is capable of being replaced by tokens that have no value? But, as we have already seen, it is capable of being so replaced only in so far as it functions exclusively as coin, or as the circulating medium, and as nothing else. Now, money has other functions besides this one, and the isolated function of serving as the mere circulating medium is not necessarily the only one attached to gold coin, although this is the case with those abraded coins that continue to circulate. Each piece of money is a mere coin, or means of circulation, only so long as it actually circulates. But this is just the case with that minimum mass of gold, which is capable of being replaced by paper money. That mass remains constantly within the sphere of circulation, continually functions as a circulating medium, and exists exclusively for that purpose. Its movement therefore represents nothing but the continued alternation of the inverse phases of the metamorphosis C—M—C, phases in which commodities confront their value-forms, only to disappear again immediately. The independent existence of the exchange-value of a commodity is here a transient apparition, by means of which the commodity is immediately replaced by another commodity. Hence, in this process which continually makes money pass from hand to hand, the mere symbolical existence of money suffices. Its functional existence absorbs, so to say, its material existence. Being a transient and objective reflex of the prices of commodities, it serves only as a symbol of itself, and is therefore capable of being replaced by a token. One thing is, however, requisite; this token must have an objective social validity of its own, and this the paper symbol acquires by its forced currency. This compulsory action of the State can take effect only within that inner sphere of circulation which is coterminous with the territories of the community, but it is also only within that sphere that money completely responds to its function of being the circulating medium, or becomes coin.   To me, all of this seems fairly uncontroversial. While gold, silver etc. might historically derive its money-role from its role as a value-bearer, and this connection persisted for some time into the development of the captitalist economy, ultimately the two roles were able to be separated entirely. Just as credit money develops across time historically, so does symbolic money, and fiat money is the latest manifestation of that development.   And Marx may or may not have anticipated this development or even seen money as by definition linked to a particular money-commodity, but this does not put us in the position of either dramatically asserting that money no longer exists (and thus that the value of commodities are no longer being expressed) or throwing out his theory of value entirely. Marx's monetary theory anticipates a fully-autonomous fiat money, whether or not he anticipated that as a historical possibility.  Finally, while it was necessary to refer to Marx himself in this context of quote misappropriation, this whole historical process of fiat money is summarized succinctly by Matthijs Krul, in a way that in other contexts needs no addition:   Needless to say, this is not at all the case today in the world market nor in any specific national market. Does this then invalidate Marx’s theory as an outdated metallic one? The answer, of course, is no, as Marx then sets out to explain the different other functions and further development of money under capitalism, starting from the vantage point of its role as accepted measure of value. When the capitalist economy fully develops, the gold standard, this fetish of the Austrian economists, becomes a fetter on the full unfolding of the value economy. There will be times when the economy is growing and yet the private supply of gold is not, and over time the development of credit and thereby the finance industry will cause a tremendous expansion of the available capital at any given time, which a gold standard cannot match. Moreover, with money functioning as the measure of value, the point of capitalism for the capitalists becomes the accumulation of money, rather than the accumulation of wealth in the form of use values. The demand for money therefore massively increases as capitalism comes fully into being. The result then is that the gold standard works as a strong deflationary drag on economic growth, i.e. capitalist accumulation, and on the credit system. It must therefore be overcome, and it is overcome."

Just as credit money develops across time historically, so does symbolic money, and fiat money is the latest manifestation of that development.    This entire post is incredibly helpful, thank-you.  So just for clarification - Marx is saying that this distinction between value containing money and symbolic article occurs within the actual hard money (non-fiat) itself? And therefore it is not correct to view fiat-money as the necessary and only possible manifestation of this separation of value, it just happens to be its current manifestation. And by extension this sort of renders the distinction between currency and money inconsequential, because both fiat and non-fiat serve as the money-form to the same extent?  If that is all correct - then why would moving back to the gold standard produce problems related specifically to this issue (highlighted by Matthijs Krul)?  Also, what about the implications Jehu seems to believe this has on the transformation problem as a whole? The reason why I ask is because he seems to imply (if not outright state, I'll have to read over his posts again) that the attempt by marxist thinkers to solve the transformation problem is misguided (accepts bourgeois framing of the problem), and is really just an attempt to salvage the mode of production rather than reconcile two opposing conclusions that would render marx's value theory untenable. That instead of accepting the implication that this contradiction is a problem of the theory itself (rather than the theory being an explanation of this contradiction), marxists ought to be talking about ways to persist this contradiction and ultimately end the mode of production altogether (support policies that reduce deficit spending, for example).    Finally, while it was necessary to refer to Marx himself in this context of quote misappropriation, this whole historical process of fiat money is summarized succinctly by Matthijs Krul[1] , in a way that in other contexts needs no addition:   His explanation makes it sound almost as if this evolution of money in capitalism is kind of a giant bubble, but the fact that this ""expansion"" of money still, seemingly, reflects actual created assets that a gold-standard cannot contain seems to suggest otherwise."
communism101,38mbex,Bosco_Sauce,2,Wed Jun 24 18:34:55 2015 UTC,"Insofar as discussions of fiat go, you summary is correct.  Re: gold standard - I'm riffing a bit at this point, but basically the problem with the gold standard is that a metallic currency standard works well in early capitalism, when accumulated value is relatively small. Metallic currency supply expanded fairly rapidly relative to the overall European economy (think Spanish extractions from Potosi, etc.) meaning that metal supplies were able to provide the circulation fluidity needed at the time.  However, as capitalist economies grew in both value and physical terms, metal was less and less able to serve as a adequate universal standard of value - partly due to the reasons already provided for symbolic currency, but ultimately because economic growth so outpaced metal production, gold could no longer provide adequate currency volume and capitalist economies experienced deflationary crises (e.g. the Great Depression, the moment in which metallic currency become ""non-neutral"").  Re: transformation problem - Jehu's deploying of it here was a non-sequiter, and he's mostly failed to understand the role that the transformation problem plays in Marx's analysis. Case in point:   It never occurs to the bourgeois simpleton nor the Marxist that Marx never intended to show how labor values generate prices of production. Instead, Marx was trying to show why the prices of production of capitalistic commodity production are irreconcilable with labor values.   This is flat out wrong - Marx absolutely intended to show how, at least in theory, labor values generated prices of production. Solving the transformation problem is the first step towards a comprehensive theory of prices, which is the ""holy grail"" of the problem of value and something that has preoccupied every value theorist since the problem was first articulated by the Physiocrats. Marx was no less susceptible, even though he never got far enough in his work to publish anything substantial on this issue.  This misconception in turn accounts for Jehu's weird understanding of money - if price and value are related through an irreconciliable contradiction, then it makes sense that price and value, combined in metallic currency, would eventually become divorced in the form of fiat money. It has a certain sense about it, but ultimately it 1) requires us to abandon the LTV as a explanation for price norms in capitalist economies and 2) requires us to hold that money today does not express values, but rather retreat into the marginalist realm of arbitrary prices. In other words, it requires us to make the concessions bourgeois economists have been asking of Marxists since Walras.  So the final theoretical picture that Jehu puts forward unsurprisingly reproduces the economic analysis that marginalists posit in the first place - labor values are relegated to irrelevance or nonexistence, while everything becomes a matter of prices vis a vis fiat currency. Jehu thinks he's offered some novel corrective to the Marxist approach to the transformation problem (and the relationship between value and prices generally), but he's really only accepted a bourgeois critique of Marxist monetary theory and come out with a very bourgeois picture of what the economy looks like. The only difference is that he thinks labor values lurk somewhere underneath all of this actually analyzable phenomena (since values are no longer expressed, they can't be analyzed), waiting to rear its ugly head and bring ruin to all of these marginalist capitalists and their fiat currency. But it's not clear when or how this will happen, especially since capitalists have been especially adept at dealing with the contradiction thus far."

Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population."

communism101,38kkwd,mimprisons,2,Thu Jun 4 23:57:21 2015 UTC,"Wrong, class is defined by relation to means of production as well as distribution. You cannot be a proletarian if you own stuff or you aren't being exploited. Regularly employed people in the U.S. are paid more than the average value of labor. And most of them own property, vehicles and/or financial assets, making them solidly petty bourgeois as at least a portion of their wealth is coming from the exploitation of others."

All those who call themselves socialists recognise this as the ultimate goal of socialism, but by no means all give thought to its significance. Classes are large groups of people differing from each other by the place they occupy in a historically determined system of social production, by their relation (in most cases fixed and formulated in law) to the means of production, by their role in the social organisation of labour, and, consequently, by the dimensions of the share of social wealth of which they dispose and the mode of acquiring it. Classes are groups of people one of which can appropriate the labour of another owing to the different places they occupy in a definite system of social economy.

They even have websites and special political group names, but I've never met one and I would honestly be surprised if I ever do."

Since Deng, the mainstream opinions in China on Mao have been as negative as they can possibly get away with and the Cultural Revolution is no exception. I'm Chinese too and I hear about the bad that occurred during the Cultural Revolution too but to say that it was an utter failure is absolutely false."
communism101,38hmwb,FuriousTank,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"That's a little simplistic. They certainly are anti-Cultural Revolution, but criticizing the Cultural Revolution too much is still a big no-no. There have been films such as 活着 that criticized the Cultural Revolution but gave a somewhat watered-down criticism to duck the censors...but got banned anyway. As well, Mao is still on the money, and criticizing him too much is still a really bad idea here. Generally, it's best to stick with some variation of Deng's criticism: ""Mao doings were 3 parts mistakes and 7 parts successes."""
communism101,38hmwb,AnCom9,3,Sat Jun 6 08:33:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I meant by 'as much as they can get away with'. Meaning that if they could speak of Mao the way that BiFuJian did and get away with it they no doubtedly would. Instead their anti-Mao must be more insidious in nature. 毕福剑 was not some moron mouthing off Mao for no reason. He knew he had to please because when you are in that position you cannot be left and left in China is pro-Mao. It goes hand in hand with the corruption that exists in China, if you refuse to participate in corruption you aren't allowed to have a career. Same thing in media. That's why you gotta take what you hear about things like the Cultural Revolution with a grain of salt. Even the 'Mao being 30/70'. You know, they are actually teaching that Chiang kai shek is 70/30 now in the Chinese textbooks. It's fucking insane but its deliberate. The corruption starts with bribery and continues with complete cultural and historical revisionism."
communism101,38hmwb,AnCom9,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:34:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Nothing about this rings true with me. I think it is far more likely that Mao is the founder of the communist party, which is still in power, and if you criticize Mao too much, then that undermines the legitimacy of the communist party. It's the same reason why they stress both communist and Confucian values even though they're so contradictory. They want to emphasize the legitimacy of the party as ruler.   (As you probably know, logical contradictions are considered way less inexcusable in Chinese society than they are in Western societies.)"
communism101,38hmwb,FuriousTank,2,Sat Jun 6 10:48:11 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought that was pretty common knowledge, the whole corruption bit at least. I definitely disagree that they only refrain from criticizing Mao b/c he's the founder. The corrupt ones couldn't care less about the legitimacy of the party. It's all about me, me, me and some of them are literally traitors. The fact that we've gone back to stressing confucious also parallels with the re-introduction of capitalism under Deng. A lot of feudal remnants from old China came back after that. Not sure if the Communist party actually emphasizes confucianism like they do Marxism. I thought it was just the education system. Or maybe that's the same difference in a way.  (Also, I really don't know what you mean when you say logical contradictions are less inexcusable in China than in the West. :S)"
communism101,38hmwb,FuriousTank,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:13:38 2015 UTC,"Uh, you brought up a lot of issues. I am far from an expert, but I have done a lot of reading and experiencing, so I'll say what I know to the best of my ability.  First, yes, the corruption like the pollution is common knowledge. They are trying to create narratives, weaving facts with stories to reinforce the legitimacy of the party as ruler.  What i mean by ""legitimacy of the party as ruler"" is not at all philosophical or abstract in nature. I mean that in a literal, visceral sense. If the party loses ""legitimacy,"" then the old idea of ""mandate of heaven"" will probably kick in. That is to say that people will start to believe that the time of the communist party as ruler is over and they must be taken down so a new regime can rise. Everyone in the government--corrupt officials alike--lose big from a destruction of the current regime. This is why ""legitimacy"" is so important to keep in the current system.   I'm not sure how recently corruption was able to be openly talked about in the media, but Xi has used the corruption to bolster his own narrative of leadership legitimacy to great success. Making corruption super-duper common knowledge has become a strength rather than a weakness. It also gives him a really good justification to oust political rivals, even throwing out high members of government in a way that has never been done before--at least not since Mao.   I thought it was just the education system. Or maybe that's the same difference in a way.   Yes. Same difference.   Not sure if the Communist party actually emphasizes confucianism like they do Marxism.   They don't do it in the same way, but they definitely do both. Marxism bolsters the legitimacy of the communist party as ruler, but Confucianism with its radical moralization of respect for authority and hierarchy is more helpful in many ways because it justifies an all-powerful ruler in a way Marxism never can. They are emphasized in very different ways. Marxism more in name only while Confucianism provides the majority of the philosophical backing for most of how China works today.  Regarding logical contradictions--this is perhaps the hardest thing for me to explain. The West emphasizes clear, logical discourse, and the West makes thinks like hypocrisy, self-contradiction, and bold-faced lying as sort of cardinal sins of public life. The East generally does not see these things as THAT bad--though they are definitely considered bad.   Where the West emphasizes logical systems first and data second (the data goes through the system and you get truth out the other side like in the scientific method, etc.), the East emphasizes data first and logical systems second (the system is build around the data, and whoever has the largest amount of good data should control the system).   People at the top get to the top by having the most experience and data (the testing culture tests how much data you know and the meritocracy rewards experience and successes). But sometimes experts will say things that sound like contradictions to the lower classes. It doesn't mean the experts/rules/whoever are wrong, only that the lower classes don't understand their wisdom. Thus authority figures' opinions are deferred to.   This is why contradictions like ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics"" work in the Chinese system and not in most Western examples. Chinese people sort of assume that they don't understand some piece of wisdom because they aren't smart enough, don't have enough experience, or don't have enough data. No one points out the contradiction publicly because (1) making a ruler lose face is a sure way to get cracked down upon, (2) you don't want your own ignorance to be illuminated, (3) openly criticizing the ruler in public disrupts ""harmony,"" the cardinal virtue of Confucianism, (4) the classic story ""the king's new clothes"" doesn't exist in China, and (5) I think most people were really suffering under the Cultural Revolution and preferred a philosophy that promised a better life over more of the suffering they had been going through. Deng had tapped into something people wanted, and he just needed a motto to make his direct underlings fall in line. There are many other reasons, though.   Many Confucian values were detrimental to Mao's communism (the Four Olds, etc.), but the idea that the ruler should be deferred to in all things really helped him. That is my best guess why Deng was able to use this Confucian value to push his agenda--it was because Mao didn't weaken the required fidelity of the people to their ruler.  I can talk a great deal more about contradictions but I'm going to wrap this up. One last thing: there is this nifty video that sort of covers similar issues in the final minute and a half."

communism101,38hmwb,SolidBlues,3,Sat Jun 6 11:02:31 2015 UTC,"The short, least controversial answer is that Lenin and co. ideologically denied that peasants were part of the working class, believing that their economic relationship to capitalism made them petty bourgeois at best, and therefore likely to be enemies of the revolution (and certainly not the agents of it). In China, the traditional proletariat had been almost completely obliterated by reactionaries, so Mao organized the peasantry with great success. This was a moment where practice informed theory (and vice versa) and Maoist now accept that peasants are largely proles.  A side note on the Long Walk: read about this, it may be one of the most heroic and important moments in the history of communism if not the history of the world.  A side note on the Cultural Revolution: the PL position on it, which is controversial but I whole heartedly agree with, is that it is wrong to credit Mao with it. Instead they see it as a grassroots movement that was necessary for continuing the revolution (probably the only reason footbinding, for instance, is no longer practiced in China, which at the time was heavily embedded in Chinese culture). Mao attempted to get out in front of it by endorsing it and then asking it to be stopped, which upset many communists, who were punished for their continued vocal support. Seems to me that the cultural revolution was about the proletariat enforcing their value and worldview on the society, which seems perfectly revolutionary to me."

The idea is that they want the best and the brightest (and most experienced) to end up in the highest echelons of government. In many ways this system does work, but you do need to be pretty corrupt to enter at some of the lower levels. Read this for more information.  Elections at other points in the process (like as you describe) do indeed exist, but the communist party always determines who is on the ballot so they are far from free-and-fair elections even in the most basic sense."
communism101,38g2py,sanguisfluit,5,Wed Jun 3 23:53:27 2015 UTC,"I think he is referring to factory managers, but I may need to reread this. It is definitely a workplace question though.  ""t any rate, the attitude towards the principles of corporate management and individual management was not only explained long ago,"" ""And our whole task, the task of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which is the class-conscious vehicle of the strivings of the exploited for emancipation, is to appreciate this change, to understand that it is necessary, to stand at the head of the exhausted people who are wearily seeking a way out and lead them along the true path, along the path of labour discipline, along the path of co-ordinating the task of arguing at mass meetings about the conditions of work with the task of unquestioningly obeying the will of the Soviet leader, of the dictator, during the work. . . .  “It required precisely the October victory of the working people over the exploiters, it required a whole historical period in which the working people themselves could first of all discuss the new conditions of life and the new tasks, in order to make possible the durable transition to superior forms of labour discipline, to the conscious appreciation of the necessity for the dictatorship of the proletariat, to unquestioning obedience to the orders of individual representatives of the Soviet government during the work. . . .""  “We must learn to combine the ‘public meeting’ democracy of the working people—turbulent, surging, overflowing its banks like a spring nood with iron discipline while at work, with unquestioning obedience to the will of a single person, the Soviet leader, while at work.""  And from the pamphlet he cites   ""secondly, every great revolution, and a socialist revolution in particular, even if there is no external war, is inconceivable without internal war, i.e., civil war, which is even more devastating than external war, and involves thousands and millions of cases of wavering and desertion from one side to another, implies a state of extreme indefiniteness, lack of equilibirium and chaos. And of course, all the elements of disintegration of the old society, which are inevitably very numerous and connected mainly with the petty bourgeoisie (because it is the petty bourgeoisie that every war and every crisis ruins and destroys first), are bound to “reveal themselves” during such a profound revolution. And these elements of disintegration cannot “reveal themselves” otherwise than in an increase of crime, hooliganism, corruption, profiteering and outrages of every kind. To put these down requires time and requires an iron hand.  There has not been a single great revolution in history in which the people did not instinctively realise this and did not show salutary firmness by shooting thieves on the spot. The misfortune of previous revolutions was that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people, which sustained them in their state of tension and gave them the strength to suppress ruthlessly the elements of disintegration, did not last long. The social, i.e., the class, reason for this instability of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people was the weakness of the proletariat, which alone is able (if it is sufficiently numerous, class-conscious and disciplined) to win over to its side the majority of the working and exploited people (the majority of the poor, to speak more simply and popularly) and retain power sufficiently long to suppress completely all the exploiters as well as all the elements of disintegration.  It was this historical experience of all revolutions, it was this world-historic—economic and political—lesson that Marx summed up when he gave his short, sharp, concise and expressive formula: dictatorship of the proletariat. And the fact that the Russian revolution has been correct in its approach to this world-historic task has been proved by the victorious progress of the Soviet form of organisation among all the peoples and tongues of Russia. For Soviet power is nothing but an organisational form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the dictatorship of the advanced class, which raises to a new democracy and to independent participation in the administration of the state tens upon tens of millions of working and exploited peoples who by their own experience learn to regard the disciplined and class-conscious vanguard of the proletariat as their most reliable leader.""  ""Dictatorship, however, is a big word, and big words should not be thrown about carelessly. Dictatorship is iron rule, government that is revolutionarily bold, swift and ruthless in suppressing both exploiters and hooligans. But our government is excessively mild, very often it resembles jelly more than iron. We must not forget for a moment that the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois element is fighting against the Soviet system in two ways; on the one hand, it is operating from without, by the methods of the Savinkovs, Gotzes, Gegechkoris and Kornilovs, by conspiracies and rebellions, and by their filthy “ideological” reflection, the flood of lies and slander in the Constitutional-Democratic, Right Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik press; on the other hand, this element operates from within and takes advantage of every manifestation of disintegration, of every weakness, in order to bribe, to increase indiscipline, laxity and chaos. The nearer we approach the complete military suppression of the bourgeoisie, the more dangerous does the element of petty-bourgeois anarchy become. And the fight against this element cannot be waged solely with the aid of propaganda and agitation, solely by organising competition and by selecting organisers. The struggle must also be waged by means of coercion.  ...There is, therefore, absolutely no contradiction in principle between Soviet (that is, socialist) democracy and the exercise of dictatorial powers by individuals. The difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship is that the former strikes at the exploiting minority in the interests of the exploited majority, and that it is exercised—also through individuals—not only by the working and exploited people, but also by organisations which are built in such a way as to rouse these people to history-making activity. (The Soviet organisations are organisations of this kind.)"""

communism101,38dd0x,TheSaoshyant,15,Wed Jun 3 14:11:54 2015 UTC,"Note: communism is not about a redistribution of wealth in the typical liberal sense of the phrase.  That said, the point I would emphasis most is worker control of the means of production. This sounds abstruse, but it makes more sense if you think about the state of affairs in capitalism: workers use the means of production, but they are controlled by private interests who are ultimately interested in the workers' well-being, on and off the job, only insofar as it's profitable for those interests. The basic goal of communsim is to resolve this contradiction between use and control and make it such that the people who make society run are those that decide what that society looks like.  Another point I would emphasis is that communism is about the development of the individual. It's about making sure that we can all live to our fullest human potential, which includes being part of a society and helping fellow people do the same.   Even if the professions he uses as examples are archaic, this passage from The German Ideology is still one of the most succinct expressions of what communism is about:   For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.   Many if not most other issues - party-form, revolution vs. reform, planning and organization of production in communism - are not only subjects of debate within communist ranks, but will also be distractions for the completely unfamiliar.

communism101,38byrq,MrMcAwhsum,3,Wed Jun 3 13:35:49 2015 UTC,What does a crisis of over-production (of capital) have to do with a rise in wages (consumption)?
communism101,38byrq,MrMcAwhsum,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:43:13 2015 UTC,"I quote from a recent discussion where I got told as follows:   When Marx talked about the crisis of overproduction, he predicted that as productivity improved and less and less labor was needed to produce stuff, the masses would be too poor to purchase all the stuff being produced: aggregate demand would collapse, economic chaos would emerge and God knows what would happen after that.  On the contrary, when modern economists talk about overproduction, they are usually referring to a misallocation of resources, the specific difference being that while Marxists see the possibility of aggregate overproduction and an ensuing collapse in demand as too few are employed at too low a rate, modern mainstream economists view the economy rather differently. Specifically, the economy is perceived as a circular and internal system, to put it simply, meaning that in the long run the market adjusts to remove any such Marxist imbalance between aggregate supply and demand. When modern economists talk about overproduction, it usually means the excessive allocation of capital to one sector over others, so that one sector produces much more than is sensible at the expense of other products. But there is no such thing as chronic, aggregate overproduction: more stuff is good for everyone as long as it's distributed in a somewhat equitable manner, which is a question entirely separate from ""overproduction"".   This made somehow sense for me. Maybe I misunderstand Marx words."
communism101,38byrq,kirjatoukka,6,Wed Jun 3 07:58:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a poor understanding of the crisis of overproduction. That has more to do with Sweezy's concept of the crisis of underconsumption.  If you consider the totality of production, wages only cover a small portion of what is actually consumed. There are also commodities produced for the production process itself (machines, raw materials, etc.) and the luxury goods that capitalist buy with profit. So the crisis of over-production doesn't happen as a result of wages (in fact the crisis results in increased unemployment) but usually because of too much capital in Department I stopping the realization of value, creating a cascade effect through the rest of the economy.  However, in 2007/2008, the crisis originated in the financial markets, and cascaded from there. It was the result of an over-production of fictitious financial capital."

communism101,388xgo,laserbot,11,Tue Jun 2 22:22:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Marxism is a method of social analysis. Marxism cannot be doomed, except in the sense that the sun will eventually destroy the earth, erasing all traces of human thought.  That said, your teacher is probably trying to appear knowledgeable by saying ""Marxism"" when they mean socialism or communism.   If you want a practical example of how this can work, read about the Iroquois. The Iroquois are an actual civilized and free society that existed and was successful, which was not based on the private property and class subjugation inherent to capitalism.  One could argue that the Iroquois were doomed because they weren't as violent as the imperialists, but that isn't inherent to socialism/communism/Marxism, instead, of course, state violence is inherent to capitalism and imperialism because of the insatiable greed for growth.  Also, make sure if you talk about private property, you clarify that personal property is different from private property. That's always a stupid sticking point for people. You'll still have your bike and your Pokemon collection. But the means of production (think factories, natural resources, etc.) won't be able to be OWNED by a person, but instead resources are used democratically with the community in mind, instead of individuals.   You'd think democracy would make sense to people, but a lot of people seem to deny that people can collectively choose what to do with resources, and would prefer to believe in the 'great person' fallacy. The human predilection toward gods and kings is a strange one."

communism101,388xgo,hastavictoria,7,Tue Jun 2 23:31:33 2015 UTC,The funny thing is Marxism was originally about how Capitalism is inherently doomed.
communism101,388xgo,AnCom9,3,Tue Jun 2 22:50:32 2015 UTC,"I think you should embarrass your teacher by pointing out that Marxism is a scientific method for understanding socio economics, and that you assume they mean socialism.  Maybe you could explain what Marxism actually is, while you have a stage. Then you could explain that capitalism is inherently doomed (there was a gaurdian article about how capitalism could never help the poor, despite what the bourgeoisie would have us believe, I suggest looking it up if you can). Or as Fidel Castro said, ""where is the success of capitalism in Africa and Latin America?"" (Spoiler alert: imperialism.)  You could also explain that attempts to build socialism will always struggle because they will always have to fight against capitalists trying to sabotage and destroy them. E.g. economic blockades that followed invasions of Cuba and DPRK, assasinations of Che Guevara, Thomas Sankara, attempted assassinations or imprisonment of Fidel Castro and Nelson Mandela. It should be no surprise that socialist countries have had their share of difficulties when they are constantly under siege from the largest and most powerful imperialist nations in the world.  You could talk about the success of socialism. In Cuba, the literacy rate rapidly increased after the revolution, volunteer teachers would travel to the farms and teach in their spare time, even the sugar cane harvest increased after the revolution. Guaranteed houses, food and birth to death healthcare. Cuba also exports doctors all over the world - I think they provided more medical assistance to West African ebola crisis than USA, despite having an economy hundreds of times smaller. The USSR transformed from a pre-industrial agrarian nation to world superpower and a leader in the space race in 30 years, it's economy grew faster than any other nation, and grew even during the great depression when most other countries suffered, and finally the life expectancy doubled with guaranteed healthcare for all citizens.  Lastly it might be worth mentioning the legacy of socialism. Many people in Russia and central Asian republics suffered from the collapse of the soviet union and still have a great fondness of Stalin. These are the people who allegedly suffered under communism! They want it back! They no longer have jobs, they no longer have healthcare, the infrastructure is crumbling. Where is the success of capitalism for these people!? The Russian economy collapsed with the fall of the USSR, and took 10 years to recover. A lot of people lost their jobs, and a few people become very very rich very quickly.  Now, you need to be able to respond to your opponents' criticisms of socialism. I guarantee it will be the usual bourgeois drivel about communism killed infinity million people. So read up on the masterpost on r/communism. You have to be very careful with your words, you need to defend socialism, but not death.   Maybe point out that many of the deaths under Stalin was because the country was still undergoing a revolution. Just like USA did in order to gain independence from British Empire, people die because battles are fought to secure a better future for the people. How can they defend deaths incurred from the American Revolutionary War, but criticize Stalin for fighting kulaks who were hoarding grain from the people and burning their own fields?! George Washington executed soldiers for leaving their post, eating more than their rations and ""cowardly behavior"" and he ordered the massacre of Iroquois villagers and burned their crops.   Then there's the famine - Stalin was sending grain to Ukraine, he had no reason to starve Ukraine, and complications of distribution and harvest amidst revolution and drought resulted in a devastating and tragic shortage. Curiously we never see the same criticisms of imperialist nations. The British took grain from British India during WWII to feed her troops. 3.5 million Indians started to death. Furthermore about 21,000 people die every day of hunger or hunger-related causes, according to the United Nations. That's 7.5 million every year being killed by capitalism!!!  edit: forgot you must explain clearly what socialism is, otherwise they might get confused thinking liberal democracies with welfar elements are socialist."

communism101,38ak9o,Captain_Mustard,4,Tue Jun 2 23:29:36 2015 UTC,"Check out the responses in here, and I'll copy over my answer as well.   A one party state is preferred during the socialist phase for a number of reasons. One party states are efficient at organizing the planned economy when led through the principles of democratic centralism. Freedom of discussion, unity of action. As we've seen with multi-party liberal democracies, the government is hardly efficient and once a new leader from a different party comes to power, everything changes and all previous efforts at change, whether good or bad, are null. One party states are also efficient at suppressing counter-revolutionary actions. By only allowing the Communist Party to rule and by outlawing reactionary parties from existing, this severely limits the organization of the bourgeoisie. And lastly, the ruling party acts as the vanguard of the revolution, helping with national and international unity and guiding the revolution on its course through the socialist phase."
communism101,38ak9o,ComradeRabbit,4,Tue Jun 2 23:37:36 2015 UTC,"My response (with a bit of editing) from another thread:   One thing that I like about a single party system is that it emphasizes cooperation over competition. Rather than dividing the the working class against one another by putting them under different competiting parties, the single party system instead unites the entire working class under the guidance and representation of a single working class party.  Many people seem to argue that single party system is oppressive and doesn't allow for disagreement, but there are different things that can counter this point:  • As others have said, there is a difference between oppression and suppression. This could also be argued to be one of the differences between bourgeoisie democracy and proletarian democracy. Bourgeois democracy revolves around oppression whereas socialist democracy revolves around suppression.  • As shown in the PRC (People's Republic of China), there could still be minor parties that represent specialized interests, such as an interest in increasing a system of socialist constitutionalism.  • A system of collaboration between the single party and non-financial interest groups could be used. Like the minor parties, these are groups that specialize their focus on certain interests such as constitutionalism or anti-corruption, but unlike the minor parties, they wouldn't have representatives in the legislature. Also, by non-financial, I mean that, unlike the interest groups in capitalism, they would not be allowed to financially influence legislation. The use of PACs, for example, would be outlawed. Instead, they would only be allowed to use non-financial methods of influencing legislation such as organizing public demonstrations and promoting a petition. They would not be tools of business influence like in capitalism, but instead be tools of public influence.  • Members of the single party are allowed to disagree with each other.

communism101,3861vp,jakehmw,12,Tue Jun 2 02:43:27 2015 UTC,"Saving the population from the teachings of the ideas of the ruling class is in essence restricting bourgeoisie teachings, not proletariat. In Marx's time, there had never been a nation where a large-scale dictatorship of the proletariat had been established, so naturally anytime he mentioned the ruling class, he meant the bourgeoisie.  In a DotP, the ruling class will indeed be the proletariat, but seeing as the proletariat composes a majority of the population, communism and proletarian teachings benefit the majority of the population, so there would be no need to restrict this.  This is the essence of class warfare. The capitalists would do anything to keep their power, even resorting to fascism as in the early 20th century as a response to the rise of socialism. For the workers to win, we must commit to eradicating our enemy and their ideas, just as they would do to us. Class warfare isn't always pleasant, but it's necessary for the victory of the proletariat, and for humanity as a whole."

Personally, I don't agree wholly with this, but I can see its necessity. Later on, when all classes are eliminated, measures can be taken to initially relax and later completely eliminate ""indoctrination"" and lead to philosophical discussions instead.

It allows you to think more deeply about the nature of historical writing itself, helping you to pierce through bias and be generally more skeptical of the histories you read.

That way you wouldn't be able to start capitalizing on it.    If you decided that you wanted to do it professionally, then you would have to find employment at a public workshop, or possibly register to form a new one.

Applicant petitions to form a new workshop or something, there is a review process to judge feasibility, and if it is approved, the initial capital is allocated, but kept in the public control.)

communism101,383c4i,axonn137,23,Mon Jun 1 15:39:21 2015 UTC,"In short, no. My analysis is that Stalin’s USSR was socialist if any state has ever been. I don’t know if you’re aware, but many of the arguments that the USSR was state capitalist originated in Nazi propaganda (but this isn’t sufficient to refute the argument, obviously).  First, it’s important to define state capitalism. I consider state capitalism to be state ownership of the means of production, but where labor-power is still a commodity, a bourgeoisie extracts surplus power, and the laws of motion of capitalist production dominate the economic logic of the social formation.  With these criteria, I would say that Stalin’s Russia did not fit this definition. Rather, it was a genuine Dictatorship of the Proletariat; it was a socialist state. I think sometimes we conflate control of the means of production with day-to-day operation. Just because managers exist, this doesn’t indicate capitalism or fundamental control by some sort of ruling class. Stalin’s Russia saw rapid increase in living conditions, housing, literacy, healthcare, life expectancy, etc. Structural unemployment was virtually non-existent, and as we know, a reserve army of the unemployed is crucial for capitalists. In fact, Soviet Russia faced a perpetual labor shortage as they sought to industrialize. The economy grew every year (save years of war), indicating the absence of overproduction crises. The commanding heights of the economy of the Soviet Union were collectively owned, and the economy was centrally planned. There’s really no evidence for any sort of ruling class exploiting workers, it’s mainly propaganda.  This essay, as well as this article are wonderful analyses of the state capitalism argument, with the latter focused on the Stalin era.  That being said, there exists many arguments to the contrary (some prominent) so you shouldn’t take what I say at face value."

communism101,383c4i,ksan,5,Mon Jun 1 22:16:54 2015 UTC,"Someone messaged me saying our good friends at /r/leftcommunism are talking about this thread. Here.  Beneath all the layers of ""tankie-tankie-tankie"" and insults (I mean it's a circlejerk subreddit, right, no big deal) I think there's a couple of things worth clarifying.  /u/red-rooster says:   Capitalists don't accumulate capital for capital sake. That's a really strange argument to make.   Someone should tell Marx, since I was just paraphrasing him (Capital I, chapter 24):   Accumulate, accumulate! That is Moses and the prophets! “Industry furnishes the material which saving accumulates.” Therefore, save, save, i.e., reconvert the greatest possible portion of surplus-value, or surplus-product into capital! Accumulation for accumulation’s sake, production for production’s sake: by this formula classical economy expressed the historical mission of the bourgeoisie, and did not for a single instant deceive itself over the birth-throes of wealth.   Later he basically claims that wherever the law of value is present (as it was in the USSR) you must necessarily have in place the capitalist mode of production, since he sees no difference at all between a description of a planned socialist economy and capitalism. Again, someone should tell Marx (Capital 3, chapter 49):   Secondly, after the abolition of the capitalist mode of production, but still retaining social production, the determination of value continues to prevail in the sense that the regulation of labour-time and the distribution of social labour among the various production groups, ultimately the book-keeping encompassing all this, become more essential than ever.   I could go on, but you get the idea (also, I guess it must hurt when those damn tankies know Capital better than you the über orthodox marxist, huh). We are the brutes proceeding from dogma, but at least we try to construct theories that explain the development of the USSR with some kind of nuance. That's why ""tankies"" talk about the progression from feudalism, to the NEP, to the period of socialist construction and later of capitalist restoration (including detailed analysis of how that restoration happened in practice). For left communists it's all the same from October to yesterday afternoon in modern Russia.  One more thing, they seem to be terribly confused about the role of conscious planning, to the point of claiming I'm contradicting myself. So again: one of the main aspects of the capitalist mode of production is that its laws impose themselves on individuals regardless of their ideas or intentions. In this sense, under capitalism,  intentions are secondary. When you are trying to abolish capitalism and the law of value, though, by necessity you must do so following a conscious plan, otherwise you'll just allow capitalism to restore itself (as history shows). In that sense, under socialism, the conscious aspect of the dictatorship of the proletariat is fundamental. But I guess you need to give a shit about actual revolutions and actual history to know anything about this, so there's that.  EDIT: I guess the thing worth pointing out is that a big aspect of this debate is ideological. Probably left communists are outliers in how ideological their entire perspective is (compared to basically every other Marxist), but anyone approaching this topic should keep in mind this problematic."

communism101,383c4i,ksan,5,Wed Jun 3 20:28:30 2015 UTC,"The first was capital accumulation by the extraction of surplus value from the working class as a whole.   I suppose a decent argument can be made about the USSR being state capitalist, and hopefully someone does that in this thread. I sure hope it's not based on this notion, because it's evident the Soviet state did not try to accumulate capital for the sake of accumulating capital like a normal capitalist enterprise. So try harder, be more nuanced, and link to some article or essay like the others are doing.  And FWIW, this is not the only position within Trotskyism. Even Trotsky himself thought this was not the case, and considered the USSR with Stalin to be a degenerated worker's state as far as I know."

You can say it was for securities sake, outpacing the west, or eventually raising living standards, or what have you, but the fact that they accumulated and re accumulated under a systemic duress is hardly unimportant.

You can say it was for securities sake, outpacing the west, or eventually raising living standards, or what have you, but the fact that they accumulated and re accumulated under a systemic duress is hardly unimportant.    So it was not capital accumulation for its own sake, you are either contradicting yourself or we are just using words in a different way. They extracted surplus labor from the working class to fulfill some kind of conscious plan under very concrete circumstances. That's not what capitalism does, it has a very clear specificity that is explained in Capital (otherwise all societies since classes exist could be called capitalist).  Again, if you want to explain this thesis go ahead, but simplifying it to the point of making it silly is not helping anyone."

communism101,383c4i,SolidBlues,3,Mon Jun 1 23:24:28 2015 UTC,"No, it is not, but it is a very important aspect of the whole thing. For instance, if there are no competing individual capitals trying to accumulate capital for its own sake the role of wage labor as a way of disciplining the working class loses most of its meaning. And this is not a trivial matter: those who claim the road towards capitalist restoration started after Stalin see as essential the Khrushchev reforms that reshaped the different industrial sectors or subsectors to be more like (or a lot more like, depending on the exact time frame) competing capitalist enterprises.  So the issue here is that this thing is not a 101 topic at all, the USSR was not homogeneous throughout its history, and defining the concept of ""state capitalism"" in a thorough way is not exactly trivial. So I'd say the best we can do is point OP to some thorough summary of the most famous defenses of the USSR under Stalin (since that is what they are asking about) as state capitalist, whatever that might be."

Political-economy of the USSR   -Widespread corruption within the Soviet political-economy leading to shortages and a general breakdown in the economy.   -Attempts at liberal market reforms that were essentially incompatible with a planned economy.  -The era of stagnation left the Soviet Union and East Europe behind their western counterparts after the gains they made from the 40's until the early 70's. Despite being stagnant the Soviet Economy did technically continue to grow until 1990, just one year before the nation was officially dissolved.   -Gorbachev's attempts at democratizing the USSR only destabilized it more.  -The Soviet War in Afghanistan bankrupted the nation and a lot of men and money was wasted that could have gone to anything from medical research to improving agriculture.    The Oligarchs    -Many people didn't even care about communism anymore, most people weren't even disenfranchised, they just didn't care.   -Greedy bureaucrats pushing for privatization.   -Yeltsin's coup.    Other   -Ethnic nationalism in the Baltic states and Caucasus region. Most places in the USSR voted to stay together as a new kind of union but a few smaller republics did not participate and had declared their independence.. However each republic had its nationalists.    -External pressure, the USA and even some NGO's were involved in funding and assassinating resistance movements in Eastern Europe.   -The government could have probably called out the military and put down the rioters but Gorbachev felt it was better not to.   Admittedly the Soviet Union collapsing was a strange event that could have been avoided had Gorbachev decided to focus on reforming and improving socialism along with punishing corruption instead of trying to create a nordic-style social democracy. Had they done this they may have salvaged it. In 1985 when he took power the Soviet Union was one of the most stable nations on Earth, the planned economy was still working, the economy was growing, most services worked, and the USSR was essentially at its peak in international influence.   My family remembers that between 87/89 social services stopped working with shelves becoming emptier. Riots were more frequent and harder to put down and the system was collapsing. The utilities, stores, infrastructure and medical care which were all behind the West's which had at one time at least been accessible were now becoming scarcer.

In this case, restrictions to the freedom of the press go hand in hand with all other measures used in preparation for a civil war. When forced to use artillery and aviation against the enemy we will obviously not tolerate this same enemy maintaining his own centers of information and propaganda inside the camp of the armed proletariat. Nevertheless, even in this case, if exceptional measures are prolonged long enough to create a permanent situation, then they carry the danger of going out of control and, giving a political monopoly to the workers’ bureaucracy, becoming a source of its degeneration.  The real tasks of the workers’ state do not consist in policing public opinion, but in freeing it from the yoke of capital. This can only be done by placing the means of production – which includes the production of information – in the hands of society in its entirety. Once this essential step towards socialism has been taken, all currents of opinion which have not taken arms against the dictatorship of the proletariat must be able to express themselves freely. It is the duty of the workers’ state to put in their hands, to all according to their numeric importance, the technical means necessary for this, printing presses, paper, means of transportation. -Trotsky, Freedom of the Press and the Working Class   As for party criticism, Trotsky was supportive of it.

communism101,37qxdr,SenseiMike3210,15,Fri May 29 18:02:38 2015 UTC,"I'll just answer the second half of the thing because I'm in a hurry, but I think this is an important question that has to be answered. In a way it is a 101 question because it is so fundamental to Marxism, but on the other hand I believe giving a really thorough answer requires getting into some really nasty, or difficult, methodological issues.  So, here's my sketch of a reply. I think your doubt basically comes down to thinking that because some commodities bought and sold in capitalism (they are commodities, you contradict yourself a bit in the question) have no value then Marx's claim that the substance of value is SNLT has no merit. This is a very good point. If you go back and re-read the first chapter of the book you'll notice Marx gives a pretty good argument as to why you need to have a substance of value, but his ""proof"" of this substance being SNLT is not definitive. Now you even see that some commodities seem to be an exception to his theory, in the sense that even being value-less they have a price and can be traded. So what is going on?  The problem here is that it is basically impossible to thoroughly demonstrate the theory before presenting it: you cannot present the whole science before the science itself (Marx says this exact same thing replying to a letter from Engels where his friend basically asks for more details in his first demonstration of SNLT as the substance of value). So you need to ask yourself: is taking SNLT as the substance of value for a starting point a good hypothesis to build an entire theory of the capitalist mode of production? The answer to this question can only come when you have actually built the entire theory, so that you can actually compare it with the object you are studying.  I think there are good reasons to suspect your doubts are not going to demolish Marx's theory: do capitalists strive to accumulate conscience, honor or glory? Or uncultivated land? No. They strive to accumulate money, really, which is the form of appearance of value. Why do they do that? What is money anyway? What makes money worth accumulating? Necessary to accumulate? Etc. Or even more mundane issues, like the fact that those ethereal commodities or uncultivated land are not systematically reproduced like the other commodities, so they do not really have the same effect on the development of capitalism (and of course these two aspects are related to each other).  Marx's theory builds a complete set of concepts that logically follow each other and that in a way explain the fundamental logic of the development of capitalism, both as a historical construct an as a ""closed"" totality that reproduces itself. It gives you laws that describe its main tendencies, too, tendencies that have been shown to be relevant many decades after Marx wrote his work. Contrast this with most mainstream economic theories, whose defenders cannot even explain to you what is money, or why crisis happen (even to the point of denying that they can happen!). What is the big difference between them? The fact that Marx focuses on the material aspects of capitalism, from SNLT as the substance of value to the relations of production that immediately derive from that fact, and that shape its whole evolution.  As I said, this is a huge topic. From here we could move on to the difference between real abstractions in Marxism (like abstract labor), and abstractions like the kind of thing you were trying to do in your question, where we just identify any property a bunch of things have in common and if a later thing you add to the group fails to share that property then the whole thing breaks down. This is not the kind of abstraction dialectical materialism uses to build its theories, instead we try to find real abstractions (like abstract labor) that are the key to the logical and historical development of a given entity through its inner contradictions (see Ilyenkov's work on the logic of Capital, etc).  I hope this helps, maybe someone else wants to explain this stuff (and your other questions) in some other way."

He's furthermore, defining value in a peculiar way it seems. A way which I'm still not sure I grasp. I was pretty confident that value for Marx meant a ""quantitative measure of a good's exchangeability"". A measure which is purely ideal and not yet embodied in the real as money quite yet. Does this sound right you think? But then he gives an example of something that fits this description but which he claims does not have value. Land has the capacity for exchange but because it does not embody labor it has no value. So I must not have as solid an understanding of his terminology as I thought or his argument that abstract labor is the substance of value is kind of weak...or I'm not understanding his argument and that's not what he's saying at all.  After reading what you've written I'm thinking perhaps that Marx is not trying to explain the origin of ""value"" (whatever that might mean at this point) of things like land and honor because those do not bear on the parts of capitalist production he's interested in.  I.I. Rubin claims Marx is interested in the ""products on the market...related to the distribution of labor in society"". Land and honor and conscience are ""products on the market"" but have no bearing on this distribution so he's not exploring them. He's only giving an account of the things which relate to society's distribution of labor like linen and iron etc.   Another user in /r/anarchism claimed that Marx's theory helps us ""understand aggregate amounts of value (the stock of capital, the rate of profit, RGDP, etc) in terms of labor quantities."" It may turn out that understanding things in this way is a more useful alternative to the classical theories of the time and necessitate the kind of inquiry he's undertaking. Even if it means waiving off issues of value as it pertains to land etc. because they are unrelated to such an understanding of the interesting parts of capitalism. All of which (in Marx's mind) relate to labor.  I'm mostly thinking out loud at this point. Have any thoughts? Thanks for the reply by the way."

It is weak in the sense that you can find things traded in capitalism that do not have value, yes. The question is whether you consider this simply destroys his argument or not. I think there are very good reasons to say it does not (I tried to go through that before), but in any case it is a valid question. The immediate counter-argument would be: well, what is the alternative and what explanatory power does it have?   After reading what you've written I'm thinking perhaps that Marx is not trying to explain the origin of ""value"" (whatever that might mean at this point) of things like land and honor because those do not bear on the parts of capitalist production he's interested in.

He's only giving an account of the things which relate to society's distribution of labor like linen and iron etc.    I think this is exactly right and basically what I was trying to explain (surely Rubin does it way better!). I think Marx is concerned with explaining how capitalism is born and how it works, so in a way he is interested in the origin of value in the capitalist mode of production and in how it drives its development. Once that is in place you can certainly sell things like uncultivated land or ""honor, conscience"" as commodities, but they will not have value because, among other things, they are not really produced in the same way as the other commodities (or actual commodities). And as you see this does not have anything to do with the material properties of the things we are looking at: virgin land is material but has no value, lots of services are immaterial and they do have value when they are produced and sold as commodities."

Don't quote me on that one though. So I would say that the Paris Commune acted as a socialist government, and not a communist society."

communism101,37rtc4,MasCapital,2,Fri May 29 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"The Commune wasn't socialist, Marx (and Bakunin and others) just thought it would've become such if it hadn't been crushed. It was a case of the armed people of Paris taking over the city and creating a new government that promoted socialistic policies (eg. closed factories/workshops could be taken over by their workforce and turned into coops, but operational ones couldn't), which is why Marx/Engels called it an example of the Dictatorship if the Proletariat.  The Commune government itself was full of left wing radicals of various types, including Proudhonists, Blanquists (the two main factions) and First Internationalists.  Since Marx had refused to theorise on what the DotP or socialism would really look like, he took the experience of the Commune to be of huge significance. For example, it caused him to change the Communist Manifesto to say that the revolution should seek to smash the state, rather than take it over.  Because thus was the only claimed example of nthe DotP until the Russian Revolution in 1917 you'll find it heavily discussed by Lenin, Trotsky, Kautsky and others as they try to justify their political positions. However, the Bolsheviks did consider the Commune a lower form if proletarian organisation than the soviets that sprung up in 1905."

His politics depend very much when you are looking, his approach changed throughout his reign between Pan-Arabian and Pan-African positions. I'm by no means an expert on the area but the image of Gadaffi in Western media is very different to the reality, my father visited the country a year before Gadaffi was ousted and described a nation which was at peace with itself and were behind Gadaffi.  The enduring image of the ""revolution"" for me will be rebels having fighter jets two days into the uprising, that doesn't happen unless you've got some very powerful allies!"
communism101,37qzq7,Apollo393,3,Fri May 29 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking this again comrade, as my question in debatecommunism did not get answered at all.   Edit: I will see if I can find any good sources since this question is never answered in depth  Edit: From ""Tactical Flexibility: Libyan foreign policy under Qadhafi, 1969-2004  The top five dimensions were: anti-imperialism, pro-Arab unity, anti-Israel, pro-Islam, and anti-Communism. These dimensions are generally consistent with what the literature, up to 1988, ascribed to Qadhafi’s foreign policy initiatives. The release of Qadhafi’s third universal/international theory highlighted the meaning of his interest in unification movements and expanding influence around Africa and the Middle East: the establishment of an alternative to the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)—a third power. The strong unification of Middle Eastern or African states could have strengthened their ability to control their own ideological destinies, rather than rely on Cold War tensions for arms supplies and political support. Qadhafi’s desire for unity remained a cornerstone of his foreign policy, even in the absence of the Soviet Union.  Edit: The following is from Libya Review, an article entitled Government Functions. It should therefore be considered to have a liberal bias. Sorry for so much text, but I really want to figure Gaddafi out  The essence of Qadhafi's philosophy is the ""Third Universal Theory,"" so-called because it is intended to be an alternative to capitalism and Marxism. The theory calls for the institution in Libya of what Qadhafi calls ""direct democracy."" In a direct democracy, as envisaged by Qadhafi, citizens govern themselves through grass-roots activism without the mediation or intervention of state institutions or other organizational hierarchies in the military, tribes, ""ulama"" (religious leaders), or intelligentsia. In an effort to implement direct democracy, Qadhafi altered or dismantled governmental and social structures. He launched a ""cultural revolution"" in 1973, instituted ""people's power"" in 1975, and proclaimed that Libya was a ""state of the masses"" in 1977. Finally, to emphasize his policy of decentralization, Qadhafi relinquished his own formal governmental position in 1979 and insisted he be referred to as simply ""Leader of the Revolution.""  The striking innovation in the Libyan political system since Qadhafi came to power resulted from his desire to replace sub-national traditional leaders with administrators with the skills needed to modernize the country. The changes were also ostensibly intended to foster egalitarianism, mass mobilization, revolutionary commitment, public participation and self-determination among Libyan citizens. From a pragmatic perspective, however, the changes served primarily to undermine the authority of traditional or alternate elite groups that posed a potential challenge to Qadhafi's leadership.  The changes intended to enfranchise the citizenry have served primarily to bolster Qadhafi's personal power by diminishing governmental checks and balances on his executive power and eliminating all other power bases. Qadhafi remains the country's strongman, the pivot of power, and the single most important figure in Libya.  Although Qadhafi in theory advocated dismantling the structure of government, in reality Libya has an elaborate and complex bureaucratic structure because the new organizations Qadhafi created have been superimposed upon existing institutions.  Four roughly parallel and overlapping structures are responsible for sub-national representation and participation: people's committees organized at the urban ward or rural village and municipal levels; the Arab Socialist Union , or ASU, the only authorized political mass organization; the Basic Popular Congress, or the BPC; and revolutionary committees, organized both geographically and functionally. The lines of authority and responsibility among these four bodies are somewhat unclear, which occasionally causes intense competition and rivalry within the government.  The General People's Congress, or the GPC, is the legislative forum that serves as the intermediary between the masses and the leadership. It is composed of the secretariats of some 600 local ""basic popular congresses."" A small General Secretariat heads the General People's Congress.  Since its formation the GPC has met in ordinary session annually, usually for about two weeks in November or December. Delegates numbered over 1,000, somewhat more than 60 percent were leaders of the ASU basic and municipal popular congresses. Other delegates included the members of the General Secretariat of the GPC and the General People's Committee, leaders of the geographically based zone and municipal people's committees, and representatives from functionally based organizations.  Executive functions are assigned to a cabinet-like General People's Committee, whose secretary general is elected by the General People's Congress and functions like a prime minister. Cabinet secretaries are appointed by the secretary general and confirmed by the annual General People's Congress. These cabinet secretaries are responsible for the routine operation of their ministries, but Qadhafi exercises real authority directly, or through the manipulation of the people's and revolutionary committees. Before the 1969 constitution, Libya had a dual system of civil and religious courts. The new constitution established the primacy of ""Shari'a"" (Islamic law), unifying the two systems. In 1994, new powers were granted to religious leaders in issuing religious decrees or ""fatwas.""  The Libyan court system consists of four ascending levels: Summary Courts, a Court of First Instance, a Court of Appeals, and a Supreme Court. The GPC appoints justices to the Supreme Court. Military courts and special ""revolutionary courts"" operate outside the judicial system. In 1988, the government also established a People's Court and a People's Prosecution Board."

Engels (recurring to Marx) states that just because things exist necessarily as a result of material conditions, doesn't mean we are mechanically predetermined. ""Necessity is blind only insofar as it is not understood.""

Later, Trotskyists, opposing themselves to the Marxist-Leninists, started calling themselves Socialists (or ""International Socialists"") rather than Communists."

communism101,37f8mi,DucksGonnaDuck,14,Wed May 27 04:50:24 2015 UTC,"Like Luxemberg, I support the idea of freedom of speech (or more specifically, freedom of dissent, freedom of the press and artistic freedom) myself rather highly. But freedom of speech has never been an all-or-nothing proposition. There has always been certain parameters where it is popularly considered freedom of speech does not apply, from the old 'yelling fire in a crowded theater' to modern hate speech laws.  So freedom of speech MUST ALWAYS be tempered with freedom from oppression. And oppression is something that can happen on a small, individual level."
communism101,37f8mi,Adonisus,29,Wed May 27 05:12:54 2015 UTC,"Freedom of speech has allowed the KKK, the Westboro Baptist Church, various neo-Nazi organizations and many others to ruin lives. Sure, in some areas bigots are generally looked down upon, but when they're allowed to spout hate, people who share those same hateful thoughts will group up and form these organizations.  And that's on a widespread scale, in the small, everyday experiences of people, bigotry can be devastating. Personally, being bisexual, when I hear people use ""queer"" ""fag"" and ""gay"" as insults or a way to mean ""shitty,"" well that ruins my whole day. It affects me deeply. It's like this with many people in oppressed communities. Bigoted thoughts and actions can really really fuck with people, and they're protected under free speech for whatever stupid reason. If the system is supposed to work for the people, it should protect the people, not hateful thoughts and actions.  So, in the large scale, it leads to mass organizations that kill people and further bigotry and hatred. In the small scale, it leads to psychological damage. People should be able to say what they want, and I do support that, except for when they use that to hurt others. That's where communists come from when we say we oppose free speech. At least this is how I see it. I'm sure somebody else could word this better."

As far as protests and literature, I would be more worried about the former than the latter. I think censorship of art is to be avoided if at all possible. But protests, while I think should be allowed if they don't threaten proletarian hegemony, may be repressed in the very early stages of socialism. With the threat of counter-revolution in a time of instability, I could see protests being repressed out of necessity.   tortured people who publicly shared different political ideas   Yeah, this is pretty much bullshit. Sure, perhaps the Great Purges were taken too far, but we have to remember that bourgeois historians have greatly inflated the number of deaths, and that a lot of it went on without Stalin's knowledge. We also have to consider that the USSR was in a time of great turbulence. As the first established socialist state, the threat of counter-revolution was immense. They were practically still engaged in a civil war, having to deal with capitalists and the NEP, kulaks were burning crops, the threat of the Nazi regime was on the horizon, and the rest of the world wanted nothing other than to see the Soviet project come crumbling down. It's not like Stalin went around torturing people for the hell of it because of their political views; many of those persecuted during this period of instability were in fact counter-revolutionaries and conspirators."

communism101,37f8mi,markshark17,4,Wed May 27 05:11:18 2015 UTC,"This idea that ""people should be free to ruin their reputation"" is very astute, because it recognizes the social dimension of how communities establish what is right and acceptable. Institutions, such as the state or the media, are an extension of this: they are tools which have social power in determining what is acceptable and what is not. In fact, the state's only function is to support the ideology and agenda of the class in power. In a truly free and democratic society, the coercive power of the state has no point.  What does this mean? In a capitalist society, it means that the very rich have unlimited access to media and government to present their message, that what is good for them is posed as the way things are, always have been, and always will be (this is why communists say freedom of the press only applies if you own a press). It means that detractors are largely absent, portrayed as wing nuts, or activity punished. This is called ""freedom of speech"" in a truly Orwellian turn of phrase.   Under socialism, it will mean a similar system but in reverse; that is, the workers will rule the state and they will use it to decide what is acceptable and what is not (the dictatorship of the proletariat). They will push their ideology and destroy that of their rivals (the capitalists).  Communists believe that once the revolutionary society of socialism successfully destroys the capitalists, only one class will remain, and at that point the state will cease to serve a function and will fade away. The endgame is true freedom of speech, where social power does not decide what is ok to say and what isn't, only interactions between equals."

I would recommend just reading the texts themselves because both philosophies were consolidated in specific material contexts. I am working on a longer blog post that deals with the continuity of Marxism(s). I will try to keep this answer in particular short and sweet.  I consider Marxism-[Leninism-(Maoism)] to be one unitary philosophy with specific advancements that are all steeped in a single philosophical basis. So to me, to be a proper Leninist, it would follow that Maoism is correct because Marx's writings from the 1844 Revolutions up until his death, and then continued by Engels later in his life, all start from the same basic philosophy. So each extension is a logical formulation from previous advancements which marks the difference between Marxism proper and revisionist deviations.   Marxism is a materialist philosophy, but its materialism is historical and dialectical. The benefits of each advancement is that they deal with polemics against their contemporaries and they postulate their own theories. It is not a question of choosing one or the other, but rather seeing which theoreticians and their specific theories are correct."

In one book I read the authors estimated 1/3 of all food produced in the U.S.S.R in the 80's was cultivated by people on their own property for their own consumption as well as for sale in perfectly legal social markets.   Most of the poorer people in the villages were ecstatic to actually have land to work with and needed no convincing. People who were less poor(NOT middle class) were simply required to work the land.

communism101,373lb4,jlmango,6,Sun May 24 15:39:44 2015 UTC,"Anarchists are opposed to dialectical materialism. Meaning, they propose the irrational and metaphysical. This contradiction between anarchists and Marxists lie, basically, in the argument between what goes first: the state or the economic relationships. ('Goes first' meaning 'what is going to be abolished first') Marxists see the state as the result of economic relations. Where there is money, there is power. This dives into Marx's ideas on commodity fetishism and where commodities and our relationships with them and their distribution control our relationships with each other.   Anarchists believe that you can rid society of the state and, thus, rid society of capitalist relationships. This idea is simply ignorant as the state is not the origin of the proletariats' distress. The origin is capitalism. There's historical evidence supporting Marxism and its revolutionary tactics. The Marxist claim that the state is merely a tool for one class to control another is founded in reason and reality. The anarchist claim that the state is an entity of itself is a claim that rests on the clouds of idea--not on the ground of reality.   Look at history: Marxist revolutions have come EXCEEDINGLY farther than any anarchist revolution. This is because the Marxist theory is more resonant in rationality than the anarchist method. Look up anarchist societies. They last weeks, months, MAYBE years until they are destroyed internally or from foreign capitalist intervention. Communism (with Marxist-Leninist ideas) has succeeded greater than any anarchist revolution.

Some have turned communist while others haven't despite lacking the evidence to support their position.   I strongly recommend the Stalin piece I mentioned. It answers the question beautifully--acknowledging many different aspects. The interesting thing to remember is that a lot of communists start out as anarchists but, like a child growing up, they learn to be more rational and start to accept Marxism-Leninism rather than anarchism. Some of these anarchists remain anarchists because of the 'scene' surrounding it--for lack of a better word: the 'edginess.'   The Stalin article is a long read but a worthwhile one at that.

Something about being a part of the whole of humanity and rejecting individualism because there is no individual that exists outside of the historical processes that makes such a person possible.  And that making peace with such karma also necessitates that he takes some responsibility for it as well, which is why he's adamant about supporting anti-racism."

However, I don't think I emphasized enough that Marx's dialectics are not just the inversion of Hegel's, but are structurally different. For more on this I'd recommend Contradiction and Overdetermination by Althusser, but it's a bit dense and probably not essential right off the bat.  Historical materialism is applying the materialist methodology to analyze history. Specifically this amounts to seeing economic formations, the base, in the last instance, as determining the superstructure (politics, ideology, art, religion etc) in a society. When I say ""in the last instance"", I mean that the base and superstructure interact dialectically to form a contradiction. They both influence each other, but the economic base is dominant in the relationship. This method sees history through its epochs of different productive relations (i.e. slave society, feudalism, capitalism, and socialism) in class society. All history is analyzed through the lens of class society.  Edit: In my opinion these are very difficult concepts and can take a while to understand. If you have any questions or if what I said didn't make sense, let me know. The German Ideology, Ch. 1 can be helpful in understanding these concepts."

There is nothing wrong with enjoying folk culture as a form of aesthetic or entertainment, but maintaining cultural distinctiveness is a relic from the past, and not something anyone would want to be forced upon.   National separatism, in a communist context, is when people are forced to adapt to cultures and are taken away the choice of self-determination, e.g. the Kurds.

Anyways, I'm not sure I can refer you to any specific leftist material on the subject of cultural heterogeny, but I can say that many Leftists have a problem with cultural  appropriation. That is, the imperialistic theft of cultural elements by a dominant culture. The most immediate example that comes to mind is the American appropriation and depiction of traditional Native American cultures: head-dresses, ceremonial attire, traditional dances and ceremony, the stereotyping of American Indian behavior (especially depicting them as violent savages or subjects of the ""white man's burden""); especially as they're used for sports teams and depicted in film and television.  That said, Leftists generally have no problem with the heterogeneous nature of humanity. We don't wish to eliminate differences between individuals and groups of individuals, rather we wish to eliminate the structures of power that dominate these relations between people: racism, patriarchy, heteronormativity, cisnormativity, cultural domination, and so on.

I'm absolutely 100% opposed to the appropriation and erasure of, say, Native American culture, but not only. From a more personal or perhaps selfish perspective, I'm Russian but now living in America, and I see the exotification and  appropriation of my culture nearly as much as I see it happen to, say, Indian (from India, not Native American) culture.

A couple of thousand years ago there was no Breton culture, only Celtic, and part of what makes Breton Breton is the influence of French culture nearby. English cultures comes originally from northern Europe but has integrated aspects of many others over time, both from being conquered (by the Normans) and conquering others (for example, India); the same can be said of America, with particularly important influences from immigration over the centuries.

That peninsula has seen millennia of wars whether it was the Romans fighting the Etruscans, the Etruscans merged with the Romans fighting the Latin League, the Latins merged with Rome fighting the Carthaginians and so on until today. At what point do you draw the line and say, this is the ""folk"" culture that you want to preserve?   The same goes for the Germans, perhaps even moreso. The Saxons fight the Franks; the Thuringi fight the Bavarians; the Alemanni fight the Franks - basically everybody fought the Franks, because nobody wanted to be united under one Germanic Empire in the first place (which managed to include some Slavic people anyway). Still today, if you were to say you wanted to protect German culture, and keep it separate, that would mean Cologne would be closed off to anyone from Hamburg. It's nonsense.   The same is true of Spain, and any other culture, historically fascist or otherwise.   By what criteria do you pick the point in time to freeze and isolate a culture?   The Japanese, the last group that I will mention, decided to isolate their culture once upon a time (1633 in fact); they knew that their culture was already the result of a fusion of many cultures, with strong influences from China's Tang dynasty and remaining grudges  left from the war-torn era before the country was united under Tokugawa within living memory - but, they felt threatened by unprotected trade with other countries so they holed up. Except, not really, even that extreme isolationism had exceptions - notably the Dutch and the Portuguese. Because people aren't happy in isolation, they want some of that interesting foreign stuff."

Exchange is called ""zero sum"" in that once labor is specialized through the market, it produces a volume of value, including new value. In the process of exchange that follows no new value is created, only exchanged and moved around. If I charge you too much for something I make a profit only by taking away from you. That's the idea.

I'd suggest you take a look at the stuff in the sidebar; there are some great starter resources for study and so on, alongside other places to go so that you can inquire further and be a part of the online community of socialists and communists of all colors.  So, let's begin:   So when a new technology is developed in a communist society, when people want to receive it, do they use a state issued currency or system that exchanges work hours all valued equally in the same lines of work in exchange?   Let me address a few problems here.   state issued currency   Under full communism, there would be no currency, and there would be no state. People would be free to create, innovate, and distribute as they please, so long as it works and can be mass-produced for anybody who wants it, they can feel free, as I see it. A state-issued currency would imply the existence of the three things that communism negates: class, money, and the state. Let me address each of these in turn, starting with class. A class is a division in the accessibility of a person to social production and distribution in terms of ownership of the means of production and operation. Under the capitalist mode of production, one class owns the means of production, and gets the yield produced from the worker, who owns but his ability, his power, to labor, and as such, can only operate the means of production to produce. By what magic does somebody who has no involvement in the production process have the right to take the product of the laborer and give him scraps of bread in exchange? Secondly, out of a long line of a necessity to address private property and so on, capital was introduced: money. It is by money that these class antagonisms are intensified, stressed, continued, or otherwise exaggerated. The lack of money by the worker and the excess of it by the capitalist means that the worker is at the every whim of the capitalist to do whatever he can for money for bread, most likely owned and given by the same capitalist for the same amount of money. Lastly, the state is the expression of the dominion of one class by another: it is the means by which antagonisms are maintained; it is the chain bound to the shackles round the body of the worker, which is held by the capitalist.  Therefore, under communism—the negation of class, money, the state, and private property—there would be no state issued currency, for there would be no state to issue it and no need to issue currency.   system that exchanges work hours all valued equally in the same lines of work in exchange?   While the first half of this is something that we feel must be employed under the socialist mode of production until the end of private property as capital and general commodity production as placed under the scrutiny of the law of value (for more on this, check out Capital, Vol. 1, Penguin Edition — specifically, the introduction by Ernest Mandel for some of the rhetoric); namely, the use of a set labor-time to give workers ""labor vouchers"" which act as a non-exchangeable currency which is destroyed upon use (so it's not much of a currency) for the ""purchase"" of ""commodities"" (again, see Capital, or /r/pathofcapital, for my hesitance in calling it a commodity outside of the capitalist mode of production) whose ""costs"" are based upon the time of labor spent in producing said item.  However, the exchange of commodities based on the field of production (that is, of course, if I am understanding/interpreting this correctly and am not befallen to fatigued eyes) seems wholly impractical and means people would only be able to partake in similar products of labor instead of all products of labor as a whole, equally.   Because that seems like state capitalism and reactionary cowards hiding behind the good cause.   Well, assuming this is communism, there wouldn't be any reactionary cowards, nor any good cause to fight for, unless you mean the good cause of the commons, of the common good.   If not, is it then lent out as soon as they are made as quickly to as many people as possible, or is it kept under until there is enough made for everyone to share and have equal use?   The production of a new object would probably be undertaken in economic coordination and planning and so on; groups of people and so on would see if it can be produced in the first place, then it would be undergone through automation and so on, and distributed accordingly; either through an ""opt-in"" programme or just given to everybody or groups of people for whatever.  There's not much more to address. Hopefully, this helps. Take care in your studies."

Because of this difference in terminology, the two groups actually do differ in their goals in that Marxist-leninists are okay with having centralized governance/administration/coordination whereas Anarchists generally want to decentralize everything as much as possible.

communism101,36n8uo,SenseiMike3210,5,Wed May 20 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"Sources:  -I. I. Rubin, Essays on Marx's Theory of Value, Chapter 12  -Marx, The Value Form (Appending to Vol. 1 of Capital)  This is a tricky point, not helped by the fact that Harvey doesn't do a very good job of explaining it (I remember having this same question in the back of my mind when watching his lectures for my first read of Capital). Fortunately for you and all us other Marxists, an obscure Russian Marxologist addressed exactly this concern back in the 1920s:   How did Marx make the transition from exchange value to value?  Usually, critics and commentators of Marx hold that his central argument consists of his famous comparison of wheat and iron on page 3 of the first volume of the German edition of Capital. If wheat and iron are equated with each other, Marx reasoned, then there must be something common to both and equal in magnitude. They must be equal to a third thing, and this is precisely their value. One usually holds that this is Marx's main argument. Almost all critiques of Marx's theory are directed against this argument. Unfortunately, every work directed against Marx maintains that Marx tried to prove the necessity of the concept of value by means of purely abstract reasoning.  But what has been completely overlooked is the following circumstance. The paragraph in which Marx treats the equality of the wheat and the iron is merely a deduction from the previous paragraph, which says: ""A given commodity, e.g., a quarter of wheat is exchanged for x blacking, y silk, or z gold, &c. - in short, for other commodities in the most different proportions. Instead of one exchange-value, the wheat has, therefore, a great many. But since x blacking, y silk, or z gold, &c., each represent the exchange-value of one quarter of wheat, x blacking, y silk, z gold, &c., must, as exchange-values, be replaceable by each other, or equal to each other. Therefore, first: the valid exchange-values of a given commodity express something equal; secondly, exchange-value, generally, is only the mode of expression, the phenomenal form, of something contained in it, yet distinguishable from it"" (C, I, p. 37).  As can be seen from this passage, Marx does not examine the individual case of equalization of one commodity for another. The starting-point of the argument is a statement of a well-known fact about the commodity economy, the fact that all commodities can be equalized with each other, and the fact that a given commodity can be equated with an infinity of other commodities. In other words, the starting point of all of Marx's reasoning is the concrete structure of the commodity economy, and not the purely logical method of comparison of two commodities with each other.  Thus Marx starts from the fact of manyfold equalization of all commodities with each other, or from the fact that every commodity can be equated with many other commodities.   In other words, exchange value is merely the result of comparing two particular commodities with one another. Value, on the other hand, is the total relation a commodity has with a market of commodities. This might sound something like an ""average"" of all possible exchange values, which is a first step towards Marx's sense of value, but is not quite there.   Marx analyzes the ""form of value"" (Wertform) separately from exchange value (Tauschwert). In order to include the social form of the product of labor in the concept of value, we had to split the social form of the product into two forms: Wertform and Tauschwert. By the first we mean the social form of the product which is not yet concretized in determined things, but represents some abstract property of commodities... Thus we have broken down the social form of the product into two parts: the social form which has not yet acquired a concrete form (i.e., ""form of value""), and the form which already has a concrete and independent form (i.e., exchange value).   So value is not a numerical index of possible exchange values (the ""average"" I mentioned), but the property that all commodities possess prior to their entrance into specific exchange relations with other commodities. This property, as you'll see Rubin explain, has a ""substance"" of labor, a quantity of labor-time, and a form of value.  If it's difficult to grasp, that's because the amount of conceptual work Marx is investing in the concept of value here is tremendous. The value-form is the beating heart of capitalist social relations, it's the Rome to which all roads lead in Marx's analysis. I strongly recommend you read the full Rubin chapter. You should also read Marx's own appendix which lays out the value argument step-by-step (linked at the beginning of the comment). It's the kind of argument for which repitition produces clarity."
communism101,36n8uo,craneomotor,2,Wed May 20 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"Alright! Excellent this is making sense, in a somewhat vague way but I think after I digest what you've given me things will become clearer.   I have had problems with Marx's theory of value in the past because I was operating from the idea that how much something is worth to people (it's value) was determined by how much socially necessary labour-time went into it's production. But that didn't seem right for a few reasons one of which I mentioned above. However, I could get behind the idea that socially necessary labour-time was the source of a commodity's having value to begin with. Is that sort of close to what is meant by this abstract initial value? Or am I off the mark? Either way I'll keep looking over what you've written and think on it. Thanks! This was a big help!"

However, I could get behind the idea that socially necessary labour-time was the source of a commodity's having value to begin with.   I think you're on the right track here. I'll supplement by pointing to Sohn-Rethel's notion of real abstraction. Adorno explains it here (pulled from here):    The abstraction we are concerned with is not one that first came into being in the head of a sociological theoretician who then offered the somewhat flimsy definition of society which states that everything relates to everything else. The abstraction in question here is really the specific form of the exchange process itself, the underlying social fact through which socialization first comes about. If you want to exchange two objects and — as is implied by the concept of exchange — if you want to exchange them in terms of equivalents, and if neither party is to receive more than the other, then the parties must leave aside a certain aspect of the commodities... In developed societies... exchange takes place... through money as the equivalent form. Classical [bourgeois] political economy demonstrated, as did Marx in his turn, that the true unit which stands behind money as the equivalent form is the average necessary amount of social labor time, which is modified, of course, in keeping with the specific social relationships governing the exchange. In this exchange in terms of average social labor time the specific forms of the objects to be exchanged are necessarily disregarded instead, they are reduced to a universal unit. The abstraction, therefore, lies not in the thought of the sociologist, but in society itself. (Introduction to Sociology, pgs. 31-32)   While here Adorno is addressing the concern that value analysis is an invention of the sociologist, it just as much concerns the notion that value analysis is an invention of participants in value exchange, ""that how much something is worth to people (its value) was determined by how much socially necessary labour-time went into its production.""  That is, the abstraction of value analysis is not something that is repeated in every act of exchange - which is, it's worth noting, the conceptual framing of marginalism and which connects us back to the confusion between exchange value and value. Rather, the value abstraction that Marx theorized and Rubin helped to explain is something always-already performed by capitalist social conditions, by capitalist society itself. We only need to live in them for value to be real."
communism101,36n8uo,craneomotor,2,Thu May 21 15:54:42 2015 UTC,"Ok. First let me thank you for helping me through this and providing additional readings (i'm almost done with Rubin's essay and it has been helpful). Please consider continuing this correspondence because I'm really determined to understand this stuff as well as possible but the texts can only get me so far.   Rubin has helped me answer a few of my initial questions. I get now that exchange value is definitely something different from value. It is the ""quantitative interrelation"", the specific proportions in which goods can be exchanged for one another. It's the ""mode of expression"" of value. Its phenomenal form. So if I understand it then, a commodity can have many many exchange-values which change depending on which commodities are being traded but the value remains constant. However, if the VALUE of the commodity increased then the ratios of exchange would change with respect to all other commodities in proportion to the magnitude of the increase in value. The magnitude of value being ""labor-time.""   Ok that's cleared up. Then we get to my question then ""what is value?"" Is it just the quantity of labor? We already have a word for labor. I was glad to see Rubin addressed this very explicitly. ""Labor cannot be identified with value."" Labor is the substance of value. This is a little more fuzzy than the magnitude of value which makes a lot of sense (if you take for granted the labor theory of value) but I think I get the jist.  Here is where I get lost. we've gone through the substance and magnitude of value but I can't quite grasp this ""form of value"" (Wertform) which, apparently, holds the key to understanding how to get from value to exchange value. Is this Wertform just ""the capacity to be exchanged in a determined proportion for any other product""? This is very abstract stuff and I'm getting lost. Perhaps you answered it though in your comment above and my brain is just too fried right now to fully absorb this stuff. Like how do the ""properties of the social form (it's capacity to be exchanged (?)) show the inadmissability of identifying the concept of value with the concept of labor""?  I'll continue to struggle through the texts because I don't want to seem like I'm trying to be spoon-fed all the answers.   Oh, i also was glad to see you mention marginalism and its assumption that value analysis is repeated in every act of exchange. I thought that as well when reading Rubin. I might as well also mention that, having a degree in economics, my background in capitalist economic thought may be contributing to my difficulties in this regard. (Not that I'm a capitalist. But I wouldn't consider myself a communist either)  Anyway, thanks again."
communism101,36n8uo,Buddhah,2,Thu May 21 18:27:19 2015 UTC,"Then we get to my question then ""what is value?"" Is it just the quantity of labor? We already have a word for labor. I was glad to see Rubin addressed this very explicitly. ""Labor cannot be identified with value."" Labor is the substance of value.   Value is the quantitative measure of a commodity's general exchangeability. This is why Marx always refers to value vis a vis a money-price - since money is the universal equivalent commodity, a discussion of a commodity's value must take place in its terms. This is as opposed to exchange value, which could be discussed in terms of any equivalent commodity (e.g. wheat for iron).   Is this Wertform just ""the capacity to be exchanged in a determined proportion for any other product""?   Yes.   Like how do the ""properties of the social form (it's capacity to be exchanged (?)) show the inadmissability of identifying the concept of value with the concept of labor""?   Rubin here is referring to the ""crude LTV"" - the direct synonymity of labor with value - which is a common attribution made towards Marx's theory of value. The problem with this attribution is that labor is a ""substance"" which exists in all human societies and is mediated through many different social forms, not just the value form.   By content of value [that being labor], Marx often referred to something which may acquire the social form of value but can also take on another social form. By content is understood something which can take various social forms. Socially equalized labor has precisely this capacity, but not abstract labor (i.e., labor which has already acquired a determined social form). Socially equalized labor may take on theform of labor organized in a commodity economy and the form of labor organized, for example, in a socialist economy. In other words, in a given case we take the social equalization of labor abstractly, not paying attention to the modifications which are called forth in the content (i.e., labor) by one or the other of its forms.   So it's not enough for there simply to be labor - labor has to be mediated, via the value-form, into that which can serve as the substance of (capitalist) value. Marx refers to this as abstract labor."

Here's how I understand it.  Value as you know comes from the necessary labour time. Then there's two aspects to value i.e. exchange and use value. These are properties of value. Use values are high in commodities that we need such as shelter, food, clothes,  etc. But as you know we live in a market based society therefore it is the exchange value that is of importance.  The exchange value is how much a certain commodity can be exchanged for other commodities such as money. The way that we can know how much one commodity is relatively worth compared to another, in other words how much value a commodity has compared to others lays in the labour put into said commodity.   Hope that helps."
communism101,36n8uo,swims_with_the_fishe,1 point,Wed May 20 18:22:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response but I actually get that part. What I'm wondering is whether use-value and exchange-value combine to make value or if value is something different but related to the two. It seems like Marx is saying the latter. That value is not a combination of use and exchange value because value is defined by the amount of socially necessary abstract labour-time embodied in a commodity but is related to the two concepts because there is no socially necessary labour time invested in the production of a commodity if that commodity has no use-value or exchange-value.   This is why ""the value of a commodity would...remain constant, if the labour-time required for its production also remained constant."" This is weird to me. Since it's saying the value of a commodity sold, for example, by a monopolistic firm would be the same as an exact same commodity sold by a competitive one even though the price would be different (because the same amount of socially necessary labour-time went into both commodities).  I guess that's because the price is the exchange-value. But then what is he referring to other than the quantity of socially necessary labour-time when he talks about value? Nothing? Seems very circular and unhelpful but maybe I just have to read further.  The way I had been thinking about it was like you just explained and which, I think, can be represented as the following equation:  V=F(U,E)  That is, value is a function of use and exchange value (where V is value, U is use-value, and E is exchange value)  But if this were the case then fluctuations in the use or exchange value would effect the value. But Marx says it doesn't. The only thing that effects value is the quantity of socially necessary labour-time."

communism101,36fndt,Buddhah,14,Tue May 19 00:40:30 2015 UTC,"Maoism (Marxism-Leninism-Maoism) was first identified as an advancement of Marxism-Leninism by the Communist Party of Peru in the 1980s and formalized by the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement in 1993 with the publication of Long Live Marxism-Leninism-Maoism! Previously, ""Maoism"" meant simply the Marxism-Leninism that was espoused in the Chinese Revolution and was referred to as Mao Zedong Thought. During this time, Mao Zedong Thought was not considered to have established significant theoretical advancements in Marxist-Leninist theory.  The aim of many of Mao's theoretical developments is to organize and edify the revolution against the bourgeoisie while fighting against revisionism. We can see many of his contributions to Marxist-Leninist military science in his works from the 1930s, like Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War, Problems of Strategy in Guerilla War Against Japan, and On Protracted War. But the most important of Mao's theoretical contributions that were later codified into Marxism-Leninism-Maoism include the theory of the mass line and protracted people's war.  The mass line is the primary method of revolutionary leadership of the masses, which is employed by the most conscious and best organized section of the masses, the proletarian party. It is a reiterative method, applied over and over again, which step by step advances the interests of the masses, and in particular their central interest within bourgeois society, namely, advancing towards proletarian revolution. Each iteration may be viewed as a three step process:   1) Gathering the diverse ideas of the masses.  2) Processing or concentrating these ideas from the perspective of revolutionary Marxism, in light of the long-term, ultimate interests of the masses (which the masses themselves may sometimes only dimly perceive), and in light of a scientific analysis of the objective situation.  3) Returning these concentrated ideas to the masses in the form of a political line which will actually advance the mass struggle toward revolution.   Because the mass line starts with the diverse ideas of the masses, and returns the concentrated ideas to the masses, it is also known as the method of ""from the masses, to the masses"". [1]  Sort of underlying the theory of the mass line is the Maoist concept that class struggle persists even after the revolutionaries have triumphed over the capitalist state and after socialism has been established. The revolution must remain decisive and effective in eradicating bourgeois elements of society throughout the whole process of striving for communism.  Protracted people's war is a struggle undertaken by the exploited masses to wage war against the ideology of the state and the state itself. The theory was raised as an alternative to the theory of insurrection, which postulated a congregation of proletarians uprising and rebelling against the state. Essentially, insurrection states that the masses will arm themselves and accost the state, whereupon some members of the state army will the join the revolutionaries and the civil war will begin. Protracted people's war, by contrast, states that:  1) Fighting the bourgeoisie on its own terms will lead to failure. The people's army must militarily engage the state via guerrilla warfare.  2) Because state power is transferred gradually and not all at once, a system of dual power in which the proletarian vanguard controls a part of the nation while the state controls the other will arise.  3) Military power must be combined with revolutionary propaganda, material aid for the party, and other phenomena that lead to the continued strengthening of the revolution in general.  Marxism-Leninism-Maoism establishes new theoretical tools of ideological and military warfare against the capitalist state and the bourgeoisie.   As another user suggested, you want to start here in your study of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism."

Some people think ""socialism in one country"" somehow means we only give a shit about our country, or that somehow we only want socialism to exist in our country and we'll suppress it elsewhere, or something like that. This is pretty silly, nobody thinks that,  and it can be easily debunked, so let's move on.  Another position basically claims something like: socialism is impossible to build in one country, so any revolution should immediately try to expand internationally until all capitalism is eradicated. Failing to do so is either dumb or purposefully counter-revolutionary. I think you can at least have a debate about this, but my opinion is that in many cases this is just arguing for a suicidal foreign policy, and that when socialist states have decided to focus for a while on building things internally they have done so in order to survive (the typical example is the USSR after the failed German Revolution, which they supported very actively). There's also a debate to be had about to what extent one should interfere in the revolutionary process of another people, I guess.  Not sure if there are any other positions worth considering, but I think the main debate points are usually those."

communism101,36gace,jakehmw,3,Tue May 19 03:58:18 2015 UTC,"Here's the point of surplus value. Looking at the economy as a whole, where does profit come from. If we take a perfectly competitive market, supply and demand are balance and prices are steady and close to production. This avoids the issue of cheating at the price tag, and it's important. Marx wants to see where new value that didn't exist before comes from. So even if I can take an extra dollar from you, that doesn't explain where totally new value comes from, it just explains how I moved some from me to you. Basically the interesting part of capital is that it expands as a whole when used productively, and ""exploitation"" in the marketplace doesn't really expand it. It's why industry is productive and finance isn't."
communism101,36gace,Blackbelt54,3,Tue May 19 09:24:20 2015 UTC,"Engels addresses this in Anti-Duhring, Part II, Chapter 5:   Let us assume that the costs of maintenance of a labourer in a given society can be expressed by the sum of three marks. Then the product of a day's labour, according to the above-cited theory of the vulgar economists, has the value of three marks. Let us assume that the capitalist who employs this labourer, adds a profit to this product, a tribute of one mark, and sells it for four marks. The other capitalists do the same. But from that moment the labourer can no longer cover his daily needs with three marks, but also requires four marks for this purpose. As all other conditions are assumed to have remained unchanged, the wages expressed in means of subsistence must remain the same, while the wages expressed in money must rise, namely, from three marks to four marks a day. What the capitalists take from the working class in the form of profit, they must give back to it in the form of wages. We are just where we were at the beginning: if wages determine value, no exploitation of the worker by the capitalist is possible. But the formation of a surplus of products is also impossible, for, on the basis of the assumption from which we started, the labourers consume just as much value as they produce. And as the capitalists produce no value, it is impossible to see how they expect to live. And if such a surplus of production over consumption, such a production and reserve fund, nevertheless exists, and exists in the hands of the capitalists, no other possible explanation remains but that the workers consume for their self-maintenance merely the value of the commodities and have handed over the commodities themselves to the capitalist for further use.  Or, on the other hand, if this production and reserve fund does in fact exist in the hands of the capitalist class, if it has actually arisen through the accumulation of profit (for the moment we leave the land rent out of account), then it necessarily consists of the accumulated surplus of the product of labour handed over to the capitalist class by the working class, over and above the sum of wages paid to the working class by the capitalist class. In this case, however, it is not wages that determine value, but the quantity of labour; in this case the working class hands over to the capitalist class in the product of labour a greater quantity of value than it receives from it in the shape of wages; and then the profit on capital, like all other forms of appropriation without payment of the labour product of others, is explained as a simple component part of this surplus-value discovered by Marx."
communism101,36gace,kirjatoukka,3,Tue May 19 06:29:26 2015 UTC,"Just read this chapter of Capital, so I'll try an explanation:  If a seller can just put prices up on a whim, so will all the other prices, which means they all get balanced out across the board.  Similarly, fluctuations due to supply and demand will balance each other out. (For example, if demand for your product goes up, you can put the prices up, but naturally demand for the raw materials will also go up, so your suppliers put their prices up and you pay all the profit to them.)  I think the relevant concept here is the difference between price/exchange-value and value. Just because the price goes up doesn't mean the value goes up.  He also talks about certain things (like screwing customers over, or demanding tribute from colonised nations) just moving money around in the system, not creating value."

Of course in normal Capitalism there's a strong relation between the private sector and the State, the most important one being that Capitalism as a whole needs a State to uphold and implement the legal and social framework that is necessary for the private accumulation of capital to exist, so in that particular sense all Capitalism is ""State Capitalism"", and has always been so."" /u/ksan"

A critique of Socialist countries whereby the existence of commodity production and money still constitutes a capitalist society.   The latter is, in my mind, is a completely anti-Marxist critique that neglects not only historical development of modes of production but also seems to expect Communism to take hold in its entirety in a vacuum (ie not accounting for historical hindrances to socialist accumulation and development).  We must distinguish between Capitalism and not-Capitalism. Any changes of the mode of production requires qualitative and quantitative differences.  So in Socialist countries you did NOT have:   Commodification of labour power (a pretty critical element of Capitalism). Private production Accumulation of surplus value by the Capitalists (on a side note: Many people think the State itself ""reaping surplus value"" , as an entity, means that the new state dictatorship has become the new Capitalist class. This is bullshit because the state is merely a structure that exists to the benefit of one class over the other. So their fault here is personifying the State.) Related to 3: Marx emphasized that competition, the reserve army of labour, and the concept of ""many capitals"" competing by supply and demand made the market tick.

Another underlying source of this concept may be the rejection of bureaucracy as a valid way of organizing administration.   Also, going forward, how can we correct state capitalism?   While I don't exactly believe in the theory, I do think that corruption can (and did) exist.

Stuff that's probably 10, 20, hell, 100 years more advanced than that super badass Samsung S6 that's out now.  Capitalism never offers the solution to things and we all should certainly expect that large companies are holding tech far far advanced to what consumers actually use now.  Hell, talk to any military veteran about if they ever got to fool around with any cool tech and they'll tell you that our military capability, what it REALLY is, is far far FAR more advanced than what they've actually publicly used on the field.  I once knew an old AO from the navy who served in the 70s.  He mentioned that even then they had some tech that made publicly known modern-day war technology look silly in comparison."

communism101,3664q1,jakehmw,12,Sat May 16 14:54:38 2015 UTC,"One of the most common critiques that liberals hurl at Marxism is that it inevitably leads to corruption of power and a ""new ruling class"". First, we have to understand that authority and management is not a bad thing. It's fairly obvious that on a large scale, there needs to be some sort of hierarchy to keep everything organized. That being said, just because a manager or boss has day-to-day operation of the means of production, this does not exclude proletarian control and ownership, if there's democratic participation. You might want to read On Authority by Engels for more on this. So once we see that central authority can be necessary, we must ask, will this authority necessarily cause uneven distribution? To determine this, we have to look at examples of actually existing socialism. Sure, government officials have taken more than they should, and we should criticize this, but this disparity is usually nothing compared to the inherent inequalities of capitalism. For an example, the USSR was probably the most egalitarian society in modern human history. The average ratio of manager and industrial worker income in the USSR in 1970 was about 2.5:1 and the ratio of income of heads of ministries to industrial workers was about 4:1, whereas in the United States the ratio of top managers to workers was nearly 115:1 (Is the Red Flag Flying? by Albert Szymanski, pg. 66). This was in the later period of the existence of the USSR, where you would have expected there to be enough time for the upper management to accumulate wealth if it were to happen. So we have to realize, first, that management is necessary and not necessarily a bad thing. Then, once we see this, we need to debunk the propaganda that extant socialist states have produced a new ""ruling class"" who exploits the workers. Yes, these societies have not been perfectly egalitarian, but they have been much more equal than capitalist states, and we have to realize that as the lower stage of communism, socialism will still have disparities to some degree."

Communists recognize that producers will be necessary to have. Even in an automated society, it's most likely just the menial labour that gets automated. There may still be scientists, artists, etc.   and manage everything, and it needs someone in a position of authority to oversee distribution, and once that person is chosen, it's only a matter of time before he distributes more stuff to himself. On a small scale, there's less resources and everyone shares the duties of managing and distributing resources.""   Management is not the same thing as ownership.

communism101,35sxdi,2DE,26,Wed May 13 06:13:22 2015 UTC,"I actually wrote my Masters thesis on this, so I'll try to give a brief summary of what went down.  Thoughout the mid-late 1930s the Soviet Union was pretty paranoid (with good reason) that Germany planned to invade it.  Most of their foreign policy in Europe can be viewed through this prism.  In 1933 they even offered to guarantee Poland's German border (fearful that Germany would take over western Poland and offer Poland part of the Soviet Union as compensation.  In 1934 they started their strategy of 'Collective Security' when they joined the League of Nations (which they'd hitherto been fiercely critical of).  In 1935 they signed mutual assistance treaties with France and Czechoslovakia (another significant break with earlier policy).  1935 also saw the Comintern alter its policy and put world revolution on the backburner.  Instead they allied with right-wing parties, joined governments, and spoke out in favour of national unity.  The main pupose of all this was to use the Comintern and the various European communist parties to push the governments of Europe into resisting fascism and to supporting the Soviet Union -- which, of course, meant acting as a non-revolutionary status quo power (including opposing the potential French revolution in 1936).  However, contrary to how we like to view events today, the West was much weaker in standing up to Hitler than the Soviet Union was, and this caused concern.  After 4-5 years of collective security the Soviet Union signed the famous Pact with Germany.  This actually really shocked the communist movement at the time.  It was a complete reversal of policy.  So much so that some parties actually refused to believe it had happened for a while, and the parties in Britain and France lost most of their support.  To justify this change they began to argue that there was a looming inter-imperialist war much like WW1 -- which the Soviet Union had opposed and withdrawn from after the Russian Revolution.  In doing so they minimised the importance of fascism and argued that communists in the West should continue pushing their governments for peace.  The reality is that they were both scared and opportunistic.  There was a lot of talk in the Soviet Union about capitalist encirclement, with Japan attacking their eastern borders in 1938, Germany signing a treaty of peaceful intentions with France in 1938, and of course the famous Munich Agreement.  The belief was that the Western powers didn't much mind Germany going on the rampage, so long as it was in the East against the communist menace.  On the other side, the Soviet Union didn't much mind the idea of Germany attacking the West, and always kept an open mind to dealing with Germany.  So, with Britain guaranteeing Poland (making war in the West more likely), they signed the Pact and hoped to stay out of it while European imperialism killed itself off in a long war of attrition.  To sweeten the deal with Germany they agreed to trade, which provided Germany with much needed resources (in particular oil).  Some argue that this makes them an accomplice rather than just a neutral country as they claimed, but that's for you to decide.  Nevertheless, the Soviet Union never trusted Germany, and the invasion of Poland from their side was in large part a response to this.  Even after war broke out the Soviet Union was concerned.  To start with there was the 'Phony War', whereby neither side actually attacked each other.  The Soviet ambassador in Britain warned that the UK may be hoping to drag the Soviets into the war so that they could sign a peace treaty with Germany and create a united front against them.  As the war broke out properly in the West these fears weakened and the hope (and belief) was that the Soviets could stay out of the war for quite a long time.  As Germany began doing much better than expected the Soviets even talked about broadening their cooperation -- the sympathetic writer would say that this was just appeasing Germany to stay out of the war, but it could easily be argued in a more aggressively anti-Soviet manner.  To sum up, then.  The Soviets weren't allies of Germany, and indeed, they were probably the most anti-Nazi power in Europe between 1933 and 1939.  But their primary concern wasn't really fascism as a socio-economic system; it was saving the Soviet Union from attack.  Stalin himself was explicit about this at the 1934 CPSU Party Congress:   [I]t is not a question of fascism here, if only for the reason that fascism in Italy, for example, has not prevented the USSR from establishing the best relations with that country […] We merely do not agree to the world being flung into the abyss of a new war on account of that treaty.”   Despite not being allies or real friends of Germany, many communists will argue that the positions they took were thoroughly uncommunist. But again, that's for you to decide.  [I'm aware that this is long and probably rambling; unfortunately I don't have time to proof-read it at the moment to make it more concise.  But if anyone has any questions I'll happily give them a crack later.]"

If people want to get into theories, what about the one where the western powers didn't want to involve themselves and preferred to just let the fascists and communists murder each other indefinitely.  As for Stalin and Hitler working together, you cannot deny that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact existed, but it didn't have to happen.   The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, named after the foreign secretaries of the two countries, came on August 23 - just a week before Nazi Germany attacked Poland, thereby sparking the outbreak of the war. But it would never have happened if Stalin's offer of a western alliance had been accepted, according to retired Russian foreign intelligence service Major General Lev Sotskov, who sorted the 700 pages of declassified documents.  ""This was the final chance to slay the wolf, even after [British Conservative prime minister Neville] Chamberlain and the French had given up Czechoslovakia to German aggression the previous year in the Munich Agreement,"" said Gen Sotskov, 75.  The Soviet offer - made by war minister Marshall Klementi Voroshilov and Red Army chief of general staff Boris Shaposhnikov - would have put up to 120 infantry divisions (each with some 19,000 troops), 16 cavalry divisions, 5,000 heavy artillery pieces, 9,500 tanks and up to 5,500 fighter aircraft and bombers on Germany's borders in the event of war in the west, declassified minutes of the meeting show.  But Admiral Sir Reginald Drax, who lead the British delegation, told his Soviet counterparts that he authorised only to talk, not to make deals.  ""Had the British, French and their European ally Poland, taken this offer seriously then together we could have put some 300 or more divisions into the field on two fronts against Germany - double the number Hitler had at the time,"" said Gen Sotskov, who joined the Soviet intelligence service in 1956. ""This was a chance to save the world or at least stop the wolf in its tracks.""   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/3223834/Stalin-planned-to-send-a-million-troops-to-stop-Hitler-if-Britain-and-France-agreed-pact.html"

communism101,35shmr,lovelybone93,15,Wed May 13 03:20:19 2015 UTC,"There are some poor assumptions having to do with your Kerensky question.  The first is that Kerensky was deposed after the civil war, which it was not.  It was dissolved before the civil war.  Note I used the word ""dissolved"" rather than ""deposed.""  There's a reason for this.  The Russian Empire was a chaotic place in 1917.  After three years of fighting in a disastrous world war with absolutely nothing to show for it but famine and death, the army suddenly stopped following orders from the Czar, who had appointed himself commander-in-chief two years prior.  He tried to return to Petrograd but was stopped along the way.  Realizing he'd lost the country, he abdicated the throne.  At that moment, there were two governments.  Councils in the large cities called ""Soviets"" and a provisional government formed primarily from the Duma led by Kerensky.  Both governments were extraordinarily weak in terms of control, but the Soviets, though decentralized, had decidedly more organization and control in both the cities and much of the countryside.  The provisional government, on the other hand, was the internationally recognized government and the one whom the army's officers accepted orders from.  In April, Lenin returned from exile and proclaimed, among other things, that the Bolshevik party explicitly favored pulling out of the war.  This is important because the provisional government, rather than ending the war themselves, ordered another disastrous summer offensive against Germany in the hopes of gaining a better position to eventually negotiate from.  Instead all they did was prolong the war and get hundreds of thousands of soldiers killed with practically no gain in land or position.  The people, who badly wanted and needed the soldiers to come home from the war, and the soldiers themselves who had already grown largely distrustful of their officers, became disillusioned with the provisional government.  By October, the unwillingness of Kerensky's government to negotiate an end to the war with Germany, and the Soviet's inability to negotiate on the Empire's behalf, made the situation impossible to continue for many.  Lenin formed what coalitions he could with other parties and then pushed the Soviets to create a national government.  Initial negotiations stalled, however, because from the German negotiator's position, there were now two complete national governments in Russia, both claiming control over the Empire and its military.  Thus, in January, the Soviets dissolved the Kerensky government by locking them out of the government building (which, strangely, both governments had been meeting in different parts of).  The Soviet government, now being the only one in the country, gained enough recognition from the German Empire to negotiate and, by March, had fully pulled Russia out of the war, though at great cost, giving up Poland, the Ukraine, and many other territories.  Giving up this land to secure peace ended up being a sparking point for the breakdown of many of the coalitions Lenin had made with other parties in the Soviets and, combined with the  remnants of the monarchist forces, including most of the southern Cossacks, led to the chaotic and highly destructive civil war.  Dissolving the Kerensky government was a cause for the civil war, not a result of it."

States arise from class rule and are thus a manifestation of antagonisms between classes (proletariat vs bourgeoisie for example).  The tendency towards crisis (on a global scale) no longer exists since such an economic system no longer promotes over production and the cessation of a money based society (see: value form). Also the contradiction between use and exchange value become resolved. In other words: People produce use values. The police are an instrument of the state apparatus. They serve whatever class is in power and thus would no longer be a factor of Communist society. This is not to say there will be no issues to be resolved in such a society but it will not be problems based from protecting one class while suppressing the other.

communism101,35s1nj,audendante,3,Wed May 13 02:48:47 2015 UTC,"The entire role of the police in any society so structured around the capitalist mode of production is to maintain the class contradictions inherent in said mode. It is the organized tool of the bourgeois ruling classes -- the forces of the bosses, and so on -- which, by the bludgeon, force workers on strike to capitulate or be shot dead. The state is the material expression of bourgeois class rule, and can be so seen as that, in relation to production, and so on. In the words of Friedrich Engels, so beautifully remarked in his 'Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State,' as so quoted by Lenin in 'State and Revolution:'   The state is, therefore, by no means a power forced on society from without; just as little is it 'the reality of the ethical idea', 'the image and reality of reason', as Hegel maintains. Rather, it is a product of society at a certain stage of development; it is the admission that this society has become entangled in an insoluble contradiction with itself, that it has split into irreconcilable antagonisms which it is powerless to dispel. But in order that these antagonisms, these classes with conflicting economic interests, might not consume themselves and society in fruitless struggle, it became necessary to have a power, seemingly standing above society, that would alleviate the conflict and keep it within the bounds of 'order'; and this power, arisen out of society but placing itself above it, and alienating itself more and more from it, is the state.   This 'order' that Engels mentions is the expressed maintenance of class society, the expression of the so-proclaimed dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, that workers are so subjected to the whim of the capitalists, so set to produce and labor at their direction, to be given crumbs and scraps, and when they demand more, so does play the role of those maintainers of this 'order,' this historical concoction of the state does intervene, to so keep it, the lapdogs of the bourgeoisie. Of course, while the police are the maintainers of the bourgeois social order domestically, the international force that maintains the subjugation of most all nations to be rendered colonies to the imperialist powers are the army, the navy, and so on, those bourgeois forces for the exertion of bourgeois material power who most Americans are so made to ""be proud of"" and to ""support"" and so on, unthinkingly and unquestioningly, and so on. Of course, I could delve deeper into imperialism, and so on, but I'd suggest you check out the stuff under 'External Resources' in the sidebar.  In order that a society might assume and thereby proclaim statelessness, it must then have done away with two other dialectical upholders to which it is bound: namely, class and money. Once class, as the relationship to the means of production, money, as the material expression of social value and class character, and the state, as the material expression of class rule, the material organ of class dominance, as all three are, are done away with, this should also entail myriad other things which it necessitates: namely, the assimilation or otherwise creation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which will expropriate the class society of the bourgeoisie, which will in turn do away with class in itself, with the money commodity, and in turn, itself. This is done by placing control of the means of production into the hands of the workers themselves, which as a class would be referred to as the proletariat, but it must in turn abolish itself once the bourgeoisie is abolished also. It is in this placement that production is no longer organized for profits, but instead, to address human need; so that empty houses might be occupied by those deprived of them; so that workers earn their bread proper, without arbitrary withholding by the bourgeoisie, and so on.  Of course, the majority of crime will be done away with once the bourgeois class state is negated by the proletarian state itself, for the majority of crime is born out of a need to express helplessness, to express deprivation, to resort to those actions which the bourgeois class state has so deemed as illegal, such as the sale of drugs, for there is no other outlet for ""income,"" for ""callous cash payment,"" for the endless necessity to provide for oneself and one's family, that food might be put on the table. They must resort to the very same tactics of the bourgeoisie in order to place the food upon the table; only thing is that the bourgeoisie acts upon it to increase power, to increase already-mounded capital, while the man who must resort to ""crime"" has none of this, and must so resort to it precisely because he is powerless, precisely because he is moneyless, and starving. He has no industrial expression, no means of subsistence, outside of ""crime.""  In this, with the assurance of a means of labor to these people, they are immediately assumed into the commune, into communism itself, for they are laborers, they are a part of the global association, the free association, of producers. These crimes of desperation are done away with because they no longer have to worry about housing, food, or clothes.  Those acts deemed criminal by the commune itself will most likely be crimes of passion, for it is assumed under communism that scarcity is itself negated as mentioned earlier, crimes of psychological problems, most of which will be easily treatable under communism, with the natural advancement of technology, and so on. There will be a crime rate, no doubt, much lesser under communism, than there ever was under capitalism, or even socialism itself.  I am in no way saying that communism will be a utopia, but those arguments claiming the impossibility of ""communist utopia,"" of communism, are themselves utopian.  This was written late at night, but I certainly hope that it helps. While it is a bit all over the place, I think I organized it in such a way that you can at least follow along in some places. There is some advanced materialist philosophy espoused here, as far as even I understand it, but as I said, you should be able to nonetheless get some of it, if not most all.  Take care in your studies, and I hope to call you ""comrade"" soon."

From Anti-Duhring, Part II, Chapter 2:   Private property by no means makes its appearance in history as the result of robbery or force. On the contrary. It already existed, though limited to certain objects, in the ancient primitive communities of all civilised peoples. It developed into the form of commodities within these communities, at first through barter with foreigners. The more the products of the community assumed the commodity form, that is, the less they were produced for their producers' own use and the more for the purpose of exchange, and the more the original spontaneously evolved division of labour was superseded by exchange also within the community, the more did inequality develop in the property owned by the individual members of the community, the more deeply was the ancient common ownership of the land undermined, and the more rapidly did the commune develop towards its dissolution and transformation into a village of smallholding peasants... Even the formation of a primitive aristocracy, as in the case of the Celts, the Germans and the Indian Punjab, took place on the basis of common ownership of the land, and at first was not based in any way on force, but on voluntariness and custom. Wherever private property evolved it was the result of altered relations of production and exchange, in the interest of increased production and in furtherance of intercourse—hence as a result of economic causes. Force plays no part in this at all. Indeed, it is clear that the institution of private property must already be in existence for a robber to be able to appropriate another person's property, and that therefore force may be able to change the possession of, but cannot create, private property as such."

communism101,35mq72,StateYellingChampion,2,Mon May 11 22:15:31 2015 UTC,"Sure.  Before the first ruling class, the relation of production was primitive communism.  In primitive communism, like any communism, there is no need for intimidation, deceit, or violence, because these activities arise from scarcity, which does not exist under any form of communism.  So for your example to hold, we would have to have a situation where people in a system of class equality perform behaviors that are stimulated only by class inequality.  That seems logically impossible."
communism101,35mq72,ksan,2,Mon May 11 22:24:35 2015 UTC,"Primitive communism existed because of scarcity. There wasn't more than enough to provide the barest, albeit equal, level of subsistence to everyone in the group. Once they implemented new productive techniques beyond mere hunting and gathering, like say fishing with nets, you end up with a situation where there is a slight surplus. It's not enough to distribute equally to everyone so then the question becomes how to distribute it? Classes develop from there. The change in production alters the social relations of the group. The new impulses are the result of a change in the material conditions."
communism101,35muvm,Sherazade69,10,Mon May 11 20:22:08 2015 UTC,"You seem to be talking about co-ops? Afaik the problem with co-ops is the contradiction between the wellbeing of the worker and the success of the company. In a co-op, the workers would have to oppress themselves per se, in order to survive in the hostile capitalist enviroment. Really, co-ops do near nothing to solve the issues of capitalism. And they would never be able to compete with the big corporations, because those corporations thrive on exploiting as much profit as possible from workers. Co-ops are not the answer to anything; only the utter destruction of capitalism will help the worker."
communism101,35muvm,Moose_Muse,6,Mon May 11 21:09:46 2015 UTC,"A few reasons. The first is that it is made prohibitively difficult by Capitalists. They already own all the world's private property, and workers still have to submit to exploitation to even begin to think about ""buying out"" the capitalists. The thought that capitalists will allow themselves to be bought out at any significant scale is unrealistic. The sheer amount of capital required to start a meaningfully large business is impossible to acquire while living a life under the minimum, or even median wage.   The second is that creating a worker co-op within capitalism is simply the perpetuation of capitalism. The capitalist individual is replaced with merely a capitalist collective that has to act like capitalists in order to survive the constant external pressure applied by capitalists. Capitalism is vicious. The tendency of capital is to accumulate. Capitalists want to eliminate competition, and tend towards monopolies. A worker co-op in capitalism is beset on all sides by hostile forces, and is shaped by that attack into something that isn't communist.  The third is that communism is about the liberation of a class of people from another class. Not individuals, not a luck few, classes as a whole. Where capitalists exist, exploited workers exist, and communism will not have been achieved."

Socialism is a transitory stage in development; as such, it is not necessarily linear progress up to full communism. Development can lurch forward, stumble back, stall, all in the context of being a socialist country. So we have to remember that in establishing hegemony, the proletariat has to at times make concessions and retreats. Yes, we should be skeptical and critical of market reforms, but just as capitalism can't be reformed into socialism, I don't think a few market reforms are enough to set Cuba on a trajectory towards capitalism.

communism101,35hkxw,Gluckmann,6,Sun May 10 13:13:30 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as ""regular free speech"". All freedom and all speech has a class character. You perceive bourgeois free speech as ""regular"" free speech to the extent that you have been socialized into bourgeois ideology, making the class character of freedom and speech as imperceptible to you as water to a fish.  Here's a good Marxist overview, centering on an example drawn from reddit itself (the whole Violentacrez/Gawker saga).   Hate and rape speech, we are told, should be protected as ""free speech"" and censoring it is evil; hating on hate and rape speech, however, doesn't count as ""free speech"" and should be censored.  Maybe the logic here, considering the way the minds of liberal ideologues work, is that speaking out against speech constitutes some sort of rhetorical censorship and is thus ""evil"" and so to suppress it does not count as censorship since one cannot censor censorship… this is precisely the absurd level of reasoning liberal contradictions can end up encouraging!  Whatever the case, this reaction to the outing of a reactionary who once enjoyed the protection of the Reddit rulers (Chen hilariously compares them to feudal lords) should tell us something about the entire liberal notion of freedom behind the liberal conception of free speech.  Whereas the privacy and autonomy of ""Violentacrez"" matters––and irate redditors are complaining that he has been outed and that his private life and job will be affected––the privacy and autonomy of, for example, all the girls this troll and his friends pornified on their despicable ""jailbait"" subreddit apparently doesn't matter.  A middle-aged privileged man has the freedom to rape-bait but the girls he targeted do not have the freedom to not be rape-baited.  Here, ""freedom"" ends up being in line with structural oppression.  Whose speech and for whom?  A misogynist's speech for misogynist ends… Interesting how people obsessed with the liberal notion of free speech end up spending more time defending reactionaries than the victims of these reactionaries, going so far as to use the very mechanism of censorship they claimed they were against in the first place."

communism101,35hkxw,jufnitz,1 point,Sun May 10 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry for not getting back to you earlier. The incident described in JMP's post is just one example of a fairly general point about ""speech"" and under what circumstances it is allowed to be ""free"". ""Free speech"" clearly isn't meant to imply that there should be literally zero restrictions on what people can say and when, as US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously articulated in order to justify locking up antiwar protesters in the decision Schenck v. United States:   The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic. ... The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.   So the question then isn't whether we declare speech in an abstract sense to be free or unfree, since everyone from the freedom-iest liberal to the authoritarian-iest Bolshevik agrees that some speech should be free and some restricted; the question instead is how we determine what makes a ""substantive evil"", which acts of speech will lead to one, and who has a right to restrict speech in what ways in order to prevent them. Unless there's a type of society out there with literally no speech at all, every society thus has its own type of free speech, and bourgeois free speech is a type of free speech to the extent that bourgeois society is a type of society.  Barring a definition as absurd and tautological as ""freedom to say anything you're allowed to say"", defining free speech as something that can be present or absent without these sorts of caveats (i.e. ""regular free speech"") is categorically impossible."

I mean obviously that applies to shouting ""fire"" in a theatre since that actually endangers people, but does it really apply to everywhere else? Couldn't we define ""free speech"" as ""freedom to say anything you want, as long as it doesn't endanger anyone or call for the endangerment of someone""?"
communism101,35hkxw,ruscommmie,2,Fri May 15 12:25:51 2015 UTC,"Sure you could define it that way, but your definition would only be as concrete as your definitions of ""endanger"" and ""someone/anyone"" (let alone your definition of ""call for the endangerment of...""). Trivially, sending someone a letter poses a danger of giving them a papercut and shouting slogans on a street corner poses a danger of triggering someone's migraine, but presumably even in a bourgeois conception the right to free speech wouldn't generally bend before the right to be free from such ""dangers"". In a somewhat less trivial sense, one of the bourgeois state's common justifications for using violent force to break up street protests revolves around the ""danger"" posed by protesters blocking traffic, not just for emergency vehicles but also for more run-of-the-mill concerns like people getting to work. This highlights a key point about ""endangerment"" in bourgeois legality, namely that there's not an inherent categorical distinction between the danger of immediate physical harm to one's person and any other sort of ""danger"": in many or even most cases, the only thing necessary to overrule any semblance of free speech is a danger to the all-important bourgeois freedoms of private property and contractual association. (Try mounting a protest march on privately owned land, and see whether your right to free speech overrides the property owner's right to have trespassers arrested!)  At the end of the day the question of which freedoms are more important than which others, and for which people in which cases, is the very question of deciding the norms, rules, and laws of a particular society. For any question about allowable forms of freedom, there are as many answers as there are forms of social relations, and no one answer can ever be fully independent from the form of social relations that gives rise to it. The fact that bourgeois ideology strenuously rejects this sort of ""social constructivism"" toward its own form of social relations, depicting its particular answers to these questions as self-evident or ordained by a transcendent universal Reason, carries no more inherent weight than feudal ideology depicting its own particular answers as ordained by a transcendent universal God."

If the fetish character of the printing press in bourgeois ideology is understood as such, one is forced to acknowledge not only that printing presses cost significant amounts of money to set up and operate (as do the analogous physical apparatuses in other media domains, like broadcast towers or online servers) but also that there is no law of nature compelling their owners/operators (note the difference!) to conform to abovementioned liberal myths like objectivity.  This tension is fully evident in a case like the US Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which despite US left-liberals' enduring opposition actually follows quite logically from the bourgeois notion of free speech. The only truly compelling argument against the Court's reasoning is to break from liberalism altogether and acknowledge that no freedom and no speech is separable from its class character."

So for example:  ""[insert blatantly racist, sexist, etc... statement here]""  would be the same as:  ""I think capitalism sucks""  As highlighted in other comments, there is an obvious structural problem with equating the two. And as we have seen, the latter example is typically met with force and repression while the former is given the cover of ""free speech"". So it has a class character and other structural characters as well."

And meanwhile racist speech is rightfully derided. Look at how the BNP or the KKK are perceived - they're completely taboo.   So it has a class character    What do you mean by that?"
communism101,35hkxw,kontankarite,5,Mon May 11 07:43:45 2015 UTC,"Bourgeois free speech is like saying ""We don't have to agree with the KKK to uphold their freedom of speech"". When we say that speech has a class character, we mean that reactionary/bourgeois speech is given a platform. On the other side, anti-bourgeois speech is often silenced. Take Mumia Abu-Jamal, for example. The former Black Panther has been in prison for decades, but during this time he has written books and done a lot of radio shows challenging the bourgeoisie.

By the way this isn't a puritanical or conservative argument - there's a difference between arguing against the commodification of sex on the basis of rejecting sex and doing so on the basis of opposing commodification. If someone wants to be an exhibitionist or whatever, having sex with whomever at any time that's no matter for me to decide.

How can a surplus of labor, ie more productive potential, automatically transform into its opposite, unemployment? There is no written law that states this must be true, but you would be easily forgiven for assuming there was.   This is, by and large, a capitalist phenomenon however, and would not exist in a society which has done away with wage labour.     When faced with an oversupply of labour in a socialist society several things could be considered:     Decrease in the social work time (ie workday substantially lowered for all) Increase in overall production for a given industry (eg medical research, technological development, space exploration) Both of the above but in limited, divided quantity   But one thing that will not be done is to throw away the lives of a percentage of the workforce outright."

An analogy is the human rights perspective on polygamy. In today's culture, this leaves women in a weakened position and vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, but that does not mean that there is anything wrong(from a human rights perspective) with more than two people marrying if there is equality, choice and safety"
communism101,35eyhf,Brainlaag,16,Sat May 9 22:29:46 2015 UTC,"Leaving aside that women watch porn as well, it's a personal choice. One can argue that in a monetary society the sole incentive of such activity is the possibility to gain good cash with a rather enjoyable, not demanding job for those with a low inhibition, however on the other hand I doubt it would disappear even in a pure communist society. Some people are simply exhibitionists and like to push boundaries where ever possible and I will definitely not stand behind a prohibition of an activity that is not damaging to anybody, nor pronounced by societal pressure (in a communist society that is).  In that light I see no valuable argument to outlaw it, sexual oppression is the very tool of the hierarchic system to keep the peasants in check and the blood boiling for class infighting."

At the very best, Vietnam is a social democracy in which capitalist rule in maintained by limited concessions to workers and peasants. Any argument to the contrary ignores the whole history of the causes behind capitalist-restoration throughout nominally socialist countries.

But some of the things I was reading such as principles of communism by Engels, and Lenin on the topic of state capitalism would suggest that since the productive forces of China, and Vietnam are not developed to the level of capitalist nations they must first advance it through some market elements while maintaining a proletarian state.   What do you mean, ""not developed to the level of capitalist countries?"" The productive forces of either China or Vietnam are comparable to their neighbor's such as India, Thailand, etc. So, ya, their productive forces are developed to the level of capitalist countries. Compared to many places in Africa, for example, Vietnam and China have a highly degree of development and higher capacity of production.   I assume you mean, ""not developed to the level of imperialist countries.""   If this is the case, it begs the question of how exactly imperialist countries became so developed. The answer should be obvious: via imperialism and monopoly advantage. This raises the question of 'how could Vietnam or China attain a similar level of development to imperialist countries without themselves developing some form of imperialism?' At present, this is exactly what both countries are attempting to do to greater (China in Africa) and lesser (Vietnam in Cambodia and Laos) degrees.   Engels even stated how private property would not be abolished immediately.   Marxism is not a religion filled with prophets and holy scriptures, first of all.  Secondly, ""not immediately"" =/= ""indefinitely""  In either case, both countries have been pursuing market oriented economic polices for over 30 years. It takes a certain amount of gullibility or self-delusion to think that the governments of either country will one-day, when the time is right, give up capitalism for socialism. You might as well believe US imperialism will do the same.    In this view the above mentioned countries are still on the road to socialism though I wonder if the introduction of private property would end up having influence on the proletarian state.   I'm assuming that you don't realize that in both countries, higher level government officials are typically millionaires or billionaires. Point being, in neither case are they 'proletarian states.' The government of Vietnam doesn't even make this claim. Instead it calls itself, ""a government of the whole people.""   Again, willful ignorance and self-delusion.     The condition of workers in these countrues definitley seem far from great. The statements i read have suggested that now the proletarian class has grown substantially in these nations and that the poorer conditions are the way to get foreign capital to invest there and advance the means of production and are supposed to be a non idealist means to an end.   There might not be an easy answer. In both cases, wars enacted by imperialists reduced the productive capacity of either country to below feudalism. Marxism, as it was originally conceived, didn't believed socialism could be introduced from a pre-capitalist stage of development. So obviously, some measure of market oriented economics was warranted. This, however, doesn't mean that either countries are socialist, i.e., in transition to a communist economy guided by the rational and democratic production of use-value."

communism101,35darn,EekAMaoist,2,Sat May 9 22:57:46 2015 UTC,Another good read. Thus far my opinion would seem to be that China is in fact revisionist post-Mao. China would be a very capable country of advancing socialism internationally and abolishing private property. Their economy seems to have grown substantially and would pose a serious threat to the bourgeois class if they were to openly challenge it. Though in the case of Cuba and Vietnam they would not be able to survive on their own without some market reforms unless if they had a socialist ally such as China.  Thoughts? Additional recommended readings?
communism101,35darn,Blackbelt54,2,Sun May 10 00:13:55 2015 UTC,"I don't have any specific readings for countries such as Cuba and Vietnam, but what I already linked to expresses my general opinion of them as well. If the Chinese revolution, which was the first attempt at a thorough revolution in the superstructure of society, did not succeed at preventing capitalist restoration, how would countries that did not even recognize antagonistic class contradictions under socialism remain dictatorships of the proletariat?  This certainly isn't a replacement for an examination of Cuba's political economy, but the comment made by Fidel Castro about China's current leader mentioned here is telling about where Cuba stands if you already accept that China is revisionist."

communism101,35929j,jakehmw,5,Fri May 8 03:06:00 2015 UTC,"Marx does this in Chapter 9 of Volume 1. He shows that, assuming all the variables of production, we can think of the necessary portion as ""ending"" at a certain point in the working day and the surplus portion ""beginning"" there.   That said, Marx is very careful to debunk the common misconception that any one portion of the working day can be thought of as ""responsible"" for a portion of the values transferred or produced.   Now, gentlemen, if you compare the working-time you pay for, with that which you do not pay for, you will find that they are to one another, as half a day is to half a day; this gives a rate of 100%, and a very pretty percentage it is. Further, there is not the least doubt, that if you make your “hands” toil for 13 hours, instead of 11½, and, as may be expected from you, treat the work done in that extra one hour and a half, as pure surplus-labour, then the latter will be increased from 5¾ hours’ labour to 7¼ hours’ labour, and the rate of surplus-value from 100% to 126 2/23%. So that you are altogether too sanguine, in expecting that by such an addition of 1½ hours to the working-day, the rate will rise from 100% to 200% and more, in other words that it will be “more than doubled.” On the other hand-man’s heart is a wonderful thing, especially when carried in the purse — you take too pessimist a view, when you fear, that with a reduction of the hours of labour from 11½ to 10, the whole of your net profit will go to the dogs. Not at all. All other conditions remaining the same, the surplus-labour will fall from 5¾ hours to 4¾ hours, a period that still gives a very profitable rate of surplus-value, namely 82 14/23%.   In other words, the idea of necessary labor ending where surplus labor begins is a conceptual fiction that we use as mental shorthand. But the reality is that, assuming the rate of exploitation remains the same, any given amount of labor-time will always have incorporated in it the same proportion of necessary and surplus labor."

But that has very little to do with Marxism, this is just micropolitical silliness.  However if we go by Lenin, Luxemburg or some other thinker who transformed marxist theory into praxis: then you should absolutely vote. To them reform and revolution are not in conflict with one another, anyone who says they are are merely doing so to pose themselves as ""true radicals"" (read Lenins ""Left communism, an infintile disorder""). Communism is at its core built on pragmatism. Not pragmatism as in kneeling for an existing power, but philosophically pragmatic. Pragmatic in the sense that nothing matters other than whether or not something is a strategically sound move or not. Therefore pushing the proletarian positions no matter the means should always be the mission of the communist movement. No principles matter, there is no dogma, nothing is sacred. And the fact is that representative democracy is a great means to push forward the proletarian positions and build a revolutionary movement.  Everyone should read Lenins ""The state and the revolution"" and Luxemburgs ""Social reform or revolution"".  But please remember - whatever you do, whether voting or not voting, it really doesn't matter that much. It's just one micropolitical silliness among others. Whether you organise yourself and actively work to build a revolutionary movement or not is what really matters. What gets me is people claiming that one shouldn't vote based on principle.

Not voting isn't always staying at home though, an organized anti-bourgeois politics protest will do more for everyone than voting would. Voting third party can also be good if the third party has a chance. And in elections that are one-sided (like voting for the president in California), voting totally doesn't matter because of the electoral college. People throw around the lesser of two evils argument, but I've always found that to be a very moralist position. Even tiny differences between the parties are still concrete and real differences. Sanders is a pro-Israel social democrat but I'd rather have him be head of the empire than another Bush or Clinton."

Furthermore, given that regular employment itself is something of a privilege in the modern economy (i.e., wide sections of people are simply excluded from formal and legal employment), the whole notion of 'trade unions as the proletariat's true class organization through which to fight capital' is rather constrained in a chauvinistic manner."

I'm not saying that people shouldn't work with the SEIU when appropriate.

And those Scandinavian countries are on board with that imperialism and lend their support when necessary.  As I heard someone here put it once about these countries, if all any country had to do was just decide it was going to become a social democratic country and it would get all the nice things Sweden or Finland has, literally every country in the world would do it, especially the currently poor ""Third World"" ones. The fact that this doesn't happen shows that these countries' standard of living doesn't have much to do with some kind of enlightened understanding about good government and everything to do with the fact that they benefit from a white supremacist imperialist world system that keeps cheap goods and resources pouring in from harshly exploited and oppressed labor around the world."

However since the 70's and forward due to the capitalist crisis, the workingclass have not been able to have these rights and still produce profit for the capitalists. Therefore we can witness how the ruling class are slowly but steadily removing the reforms, selling government-owned companies and institutions, etc.  The differences between rich and poor are growing every day and in Sweden TWO men own half of the country's capital.  As a result of this, the racist party ""Sweden democrats"" now have 13% and rising.  So, yeah, we were on a great path but now we're not really role models, no.

It was really good for producing things here and there, and also spreading culture. The issue is in capitalism, when commodity production is the primary production. Specialization no longer really happens on the workers' level, it happens on an industrial level. The capitalists have to build single-purpose factories and buy single-purpose tools. They can only really compete with other capitalists in the same business, meaning the competition is more direct and divisive.

communism101,34q7nl,deleventy,6,Sun May 3 19:28:33 2015 UTC,"what is the point of an ethical system based upon virtue?   The purpose of virtue ethics is to determine what type of character traits and habits makes a person moral (""virtuous"") in his/her character, with the goal then being for this person to achieve these moral traits and habits (a.k.a. these virtues) in order to be a virtuous person. This is done while avoiding the immoral character traits and habits (the vices).  Virtue Ethics differs from deontology and utilitarianism in that it primarily focuses on character, or really, the person, whereas the other two primarily focus on specific actions and rules.   Many of the things any individual is, is out of their direct control. To me, virtue ethics sounds bourgeois to the extreme, as it seems to easily support and justify a class system.   Especially with, ""Many of the things any individual is, is out of their direct control,"" you're actually hitting a point as to how virtue ethics can be used to justify socialism over capitalism. For example, it can be argued that capitalism, especially with the profit motive, influences/encourages individuals to possess vices such as selfishness, apathy towards others, and sociopathy (e.g. the necessity, as a business owner, to make decisions such as laying off workers or decreasing worker wages in order to decrease expenses and increase profit).

One party states are also efficient at suppressing counter-revolutionary actions.

communism101,34kixk,timemachine_GO,13,Sat May 2 05:33:29 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between oppression and suppression. Oppression is bad. Oppression is keeping people from living their lives, and then kicking them when they're down. Suppression is good. Suppression is not allowing reactionary, pro-capitalist actions to bubble up, because once they bubble up they put the revolution at danger. The difference is in context. The minority keeping the majority down is oppression, but the majority keeping the minority from putting the whole of society in a stranglehold is suppression.  We don't know the future, so we don't know exactly how the state will dissolve once a world socialist state is achieved. My guess is just that people as a whole will step up and take the responsibility of the state into their own hands, and eventually the state will just wither and wither and before you know it, it's gone. One day you'll wake up and realize it. Just like evolution, it's a process that if you're in it, you don't realize it, but once you look back you realize that everything is different from when you started."

I think that something important to keep in mind is that government and state are not the same thing. What would wither away would be the institutions of force that's used for social class domination. However, I think that there could still be representatives and administrators that simplify public decision making and economic coordination. E.g. With the issue How should society help a community that's been hit by a hurricane, instead of having millions or thousands of individuals taking a long time deciding what to do (deciding what resources should be sent, who and how many individuals should be sent, etc.), the communities of society could just send representatives to meet with each other to make these decisions for them, allowing for decisive decision making that would be needed because of the suffering that's occurring."

One party rule was a historical thing. During the Russian revolution, the Bolsheviks tried multi-party democracy and coalition government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, but it didn't work.

communism101,34kixk,cave_rat,5,Sat May 2 12:03:49 2015 UTC,"One thing that I like about single party system is that it emphasis cooperation over competition. Rather than dividing the the working class against one another by putting them under different competiting parties, the single party system instead unites the entire working class under the guidance and representation of a single working class party.  Many people seem to argue that single party system is oppressive and doesn't allow for disagreement, but there are different things that can counter this point:   As others have said, there is a difference between oppression and suppression. This could also be argued to be one of the differences between bourgeoisie democracy and proletarian democracy. Bourgeois democracy revolves around oppression whereas socialist democracy revolves around suppression. As shown in the PRC, there could still be minor parties that represent specialized interests, such as an interest in increasing a system of socialist constitutionalism. A system of collaboration between the single party and non-financial interest groups could be used. Like the minor parties, these are groups that specialize their focus on certain interests such as constitutionalism or anti-corruption, but unlike the minor parties, they wouldn't have representatives in the legislature. Also, by non-financial, I mean that, unlike the interest groups in capitalism, they would not be allowed to financially influence legislation. The use of PACs, for example, would be outlawed. Instead, they would only be allowed to use non-financial methods of influencing legislation such as organizing public demonstrations and promoting a petition. They would not be tools of corporate influence like in capitalism, but instead be tools of public influence. Members of the single party are allowed to disagree with each other."

Here is a snippet from Engels' ""Origin of the Family""   With the herds and the other new riches, a revolution came over the family. To procure the necessities of life had always been the business of the man; he produced and owned the means of doing so. The herds were the new means of producing these necessities; the taming of the animals in the first instance and their later tending were the man’s work. To him, therefore, belonged the cattle, and to him the commodities and the slaves received in exchange for cattle. All the surplus which the acquisition of the necessities of life now yielded fell to the man; the woman shared in its enjoyment, but had no part in its ownership. The “savage” warrior and hunter had been content to take second place in the house, after the woman; the “gentler” shepherd, in the arrogance of his wealth, pushed himself forward into the first place and the woman down into the second. And she could not complain. The division of labor within the family had regulated the division of property between the man and the woman. That division of labor had remained the same; and yet it now turned the previous domestic relation upside down, simply because the division of labor outside the family had changed. The same cause which had ensured to the woman her previous supremacy in the house – that her activity was confined to domestic labor – this same cause now ensured the man's supremacy in the house: the domestic labor of the woman no longer counted beside the acquisition of the necessities of life by the man; the latter was everything, the former an unimportant extra.   Marx and Engels believed strongly that people should associate freely and lovingly with each other solely because of their shared affection, not for breeding stock and inheritance. That's what they mean by abolition of the family--not some insidious plot to take away love, the very opposite in fact."

A rich family will give their riches to their kids, than to the society, while a poor family will keep having to work to survive. They are not opposed to people being married and forming families.

So is Anarchism:  http://www.isreview.org/issues/53/makhno.shtml   When occupying cities or towns, Makhno’s troops would post notices on walls that read:  This Army does not serve any political party, any power, any dictatorship. On the contrary, it seeks to free the region of all political power, of all dictatorship. It strives to protect the freedom of action, the free life of the workers against all exploitation and domination. The Makhno Army does not therefore represent any authority. It will not subject anyone to any obligation whatsoever. Its role is confined to defending the freedom of the workers. The freedom of the peasants and the workers belongs to themselves, and should not suffer any restriction.61 But left in control of territory that they wanted to secure, the Makhnovists ended up forming what most would call a state. The Makhnovists set monetary policy.62 They regulated the press.63 They redistributed land according to specific laws they passed. They organized regional legislative conferences. 64 They controlled armed detachments to enforce their policies.65 To combat epidemics, they promulgated mandatory standards of cleanliness for the public health.66 Except for the Makhnovists, parties were banned from organizing for election to regional bodies. They banned authority with which they disagreed to “prevent those hostile to our political ideas from establishing themselves.”67 They delegated broad authority to a “Regional Military-Revolutionary Council of Peasants, Workers and Insurgents.” The Makhnovists used their military authority to suppress rival political ideas and organizations.68 The anarchist historian Paul Avrich notes, “the Military-Revolutionary Council, acting in conjunction with the Regional Congresses and the local soviets, in effect formed a loose-knit government in the territory surrounding Guliai-Pole.”69"

The Cuban Revolution is still going fairly strong while being mostly faithful to the Marxist-Leninist model with some changes due to material conditions such as the fall of the Soviet Union and the US embargo.

As long as the socialist phase is in effect, the bourgeoisie will take every possible opportunity to bring about counter-revolutionary and reactionary thought. Suppression removes a good amount of the chance for that to develop into actually destroying the revolution.   And note, suppression is nowhere near the same as oppression. Oppressive thoughts and actions by their very nature ruin people's lives. They lead to mass amounts of pointless deaths and the exploitation of a growing number of nations and populations.

communism101,34chs1,Prentasid,10,Thu Apr 30 01:21:00 2015 UTC,"It seems you have a misunderstanding of how goods would be allocated in a communist society. Primitive trade - by which I mean good-for-good trade - has already been abolished by capitalism. You wouldn't trade goods with other people in communism; you'd likely be apportioned goods based on how much labor time you contributed to society. As we progress into socialism and then communism, we need to establish a monetary system that prevents capitalists from accumulating capital and throwing us back into capitalism. The following is an excerpt which outlines and explains Marx's basic plan for such a system from Allin Cottrell and Paul Cockshott's excellent book Towards a New Socialism, found on page 31 of the .pdf file:   The great merit of these original [socialist] principles is that they provide a coherent foundation for an entire system, not just of economic organisation, but also a whole new legal, moral and social order. They imply a monetary system based upon time rather than upon arbitrary and meaningless currency units like Pounds, Dollars or Ecu. People would be credited with hours worked rather than money at the end of the week. Payments for goods and services would also be in terms of time. You would pay for a garment that took two hours to produce with two hours of your own time. An economy based upon time-prices would have built into it the democratic presumption of human equality. Marx outlined the sort of system we have in mind as follows:   Accordingly, the individual producer gets back from society—after the deductions—exactly what he has given it. What he has given it is his individual quantum of labour. For instance, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work. The individual labour time of the individual producer thus constitutes his contribution to the social working day, his share of it. Society gives him a certificate stating that he has done such and such an amount of work (after the labour done for the communal fund has been deducted), and with this certificate he can withdraw from the social supply of means of consumption as much as costs an equivalent amount of labour. The same amount of labour he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another. (Marx, 1974, p. 346)   Note that these certificates of labour performed are quite distinct from money. They can only be obtained by labour and can only be exchanged against consumer goods. In another passage Marx argues that Robert Owen’s so-called ‘labour money’ was not money at all:   On this point I will only say that Owen’s ‘labour money’, for instance, is no more ‘money’ than a theatre ticket is. Owen presupposes directly socialized labour, a form of production diametrically opposed to the production of commodities. The certificate of labour is merely evidence of the part taken by the individual in the common labour, and of his claim to a certain portion of the common product which has been set aside for consumption. But Owen never made the mistake of presupposing the production of commodities, while, at the same time, by juggling with money, trying to circumvent the necessary conditions of that form of production. (Marx, 1976, pp. 188–9)   When Marx says that labour certificates are no more money than a theatre ticket we can draw certain implications:  (1) The certificates do not circulate; they can only be directly exchanged against consumer goods.  (2) Like many tickets they would be non-transferable. Only the person who had performed the labour could use them.  (3) They would be cancelled after a single use, just as a theatre ticket is destroyed on entry to the theatre. When individuals withdrew goods from a shop their vouchers would be cancelled. The shop, as a communal organisation, has no need to buy in goods, it is just allocated them, so its only interest in the labour vouchers is for record-keeping purposes.  (4) They would not serve as a store of value. They could have a ‘use by’ date on them. Unless individuals redeemed their share of this year’s output by the end of the year, it would be assumed that they did not want it. If labour tokens are not spent then the goods that embodied the labour would not be used. Many goods are perishable and they would have to be disposed of somehow.  Nowadays one need not think in terms of paper certificates of work done. Instead we can envisage the use of some form of labour credit card which keeps track of how much work you have done. Deductions from your social labour credit account could be made by filling in a slip, or using a direct debit terminal. We are presented by Marx with a model—a skeletal one but a clear one— of a socialist society in which there are no commodities (i.e. goods produced specifically for exchange on a market). People are paid in labour credits for work done. Deductions are made for communal needs. Goods are distributed on the basis of their labour content, with corresponding deductions from people’s credit accounts. Production is organised on a directly social basis with intermediate products never assuming the form of commodities."

Of course, this could also be part of a parecon sort of deal, but I don't know - we are no prophets.

In my view, delegative democracy would be paramount in the dictatorship of the proletariat or as a lot of us call it, socialism. In communism however, I point to Lenin's words in Chapter 4 of The State and Revolution:   it is constantly forgotten that the abolition of the state means also the abolition of democracy; that the withering away of the state means the withering away of democracy...  No, democracy is not identical with the subordination of the minority to the majority. Democracy is a state which recognizes the subordination of the minority to the majority, i.e., an organization for the systematic use of force by one class against another, by one section of the population against another...  ...that the need for violence against people in general, for the subordination of one man to another, and of one section of the population to another, will vanish altogether since people will become accustomed to observing the elementary conditions of social life without violence and without subordination.   (Sorry for the longish quote, but it was necessary to quote more than just one or two sentences.)  You can think of it like grocery shopping. No one ever sat you down and taught you how to shop, no one ever forced you to behave a certain way in the grocery store (unless you're unruly of course). You just figured it out through related social activity with the other people in the store.  In my view communism would be kind of like that, but on a greater scale."

I think the democracy that you're fed up with is bourgeois democracy. In capitalist countries we all know that the rich have the most influence and that only they have true democracy. As long as a country is capitalist, any democracy will be bourgeois democracy. Under socialism, the dictatorship of the proletariat, we can use proletarian democracy, but even direct democracy or representative democracy is not essential to socialism. Leninists are proponents of democratic socialism, which can be a pragmatic way to organize the state such that the proletariat can still maintain fundamental control of the means of production."

So the question of ""Why do some people dislike living under socialism"" has several answers, most of them directly related to where and when someone lived. Here are some:   Corruption Disagreements with the party line Lack of high class consumer goods  Revolutionary violence Expropriated member of the bourgeoisie   Peoples opinions towards ""preferring socialism"" also waver depending on how capitalism is doing at the moment. For example, during the recent economic meltdown numbers for people who ""preferred socialism"" surged. Reading western literature and talking to Soviet ex-pats is a terrible way to get perspective on people liking or disliking the system.  63% Romanians prefer life under socialism - http://www.balkanalysis.com/romania/2011/12/27/in-romania-opinion-polls-show-nostalgia-for-communism/  In the Carnegie poll last year, 42 percent of Russian respondents named Stalin as the most influential historical figure. An even greater admiration of Stalin was seen in his homeland, Georgia, where 45 percent of respondents expressed a positive view of him. - http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/poll-finds-stalins-popularity-high/476342.html  About 60 percent of Russians believe there were more positive than negative aspects to life in the former Soviet Union - http://rbth.com/news/2013/10/12/about_60_percent_of_russians_see_communism_as_good_system_-_poll_30755.html  I think that you will find the people who tend to prefer socialism tend to be those on the lower rungs of the social hierarchy.

communism101,34ahd7,t8nlink,3,Wed Apr 29 22:38:27 2015 UTC,"A different type of socialism than communists socialism. Hitler raised the position of all the lower class Germans to be able to work, have vacation, have breaks, 40 work week, work in nice conditions, better pay, and many things like that.....  It's actually kind of amazing when you think about it, every German could go on a vacation, there were no poor people in Germany. The policies of Germany was more about merging all the classes together under one German class instead of waging class warfare.  Many policies aimed at bringing the people together.... Many ""capitalists"" in Germany were not so happy about these things, which caused them to sabotage the war effort, and attempt to Assassinate Hitler. So it would be wrong to call Nazi Germany a normal capitalist society.  “The social programs Hitler introduced had two objectives. One was to improve the standard of living of the average citizen. The other was to create a classless society in which the bourgeois, labor, agrarian folk and nobility enjoyed equal status as Volksgenossen. This translates literally to “ethnic national comrades,” though the expression “fellow Germans” better conveys its spirit.

Hitler believed that removing traditional class barriers would create social mobility for talented individuals to advance. All Germany would benefit through the maturation of the more promising human resources.”   I think that the more accurate term would be class collaborationist rather than classless. The problem with using the term classless is that even though the class barriers were supposedly weakened, these social classes still existed and were just supposed to be united together as one nation. It was ""one nation with different parts that worked together for the benefit of the whole.""  Sorry if this makes me sound like I'm nitpicking. I just think that this is an important detail to notice since it shows that national socialism really wasn't socialist in the classical sense as opposed to the socialism of figures such as Marx and Bakunin. I mean, if they viewed class collaborationism as an instrument while viewing a classless society as a goal, then I guess that would be one thing. However, that just wasn't something that they were focused on.   Many ""capitalists"" in Germany were not so happy about these things, which caused them to sabotage the war effort, and attempt to Assassinate Hitler. So it would be wrong to call Nazi Germany a normal capitalist society.   The problem with this is that it isn't unusual for capitalists to be unhappy towards capitalist politicians and capitalist policies. Capitalists being unhappy about Social Democracy and Social Democratic policies, despite Social Democracy being a variant of capitalism, may serve as a good example."
communism101,34ahd7,AnCom9,3,Sat May 2 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"I think National Socialism is the closest thing we've come to having a ""classless"" society.... The working class and business owners worked together for the benefit of the peoples.  Workers and business owners were not seperate from each other, and there was not really much that a business owner can do, that his workers wouldn't be able to do.      Employee and employer became leader, and follower in Germany.   Sure the employer made more money, but his workers certainly weren't exploited, they were quite happy.  And your totally right about your last point. They wanted to exploit the worker and make more money for themselves, but the Nazis told them to take less money for themselves and more for worker, in simple terms."
communism101,34ahd7,NotEqual15,2,Sat May 2 21:02:52 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna give a couple examples of what National Socialism looks like policy wise.   “One revolutionary measure, appalling to laissez faire disciples like the banker Schacht, was the government’s regulation of salaries and managerial privileges. It first addressed the custom in private sector of paying white collar workers monthly stipends even when absent from the job, while according no similar benefit to factory personnel. The government abolished this discrepancy. It arranged instead “to insure the laborer a certain measure of compensation when missing work due to important family matters, plus a fixed, company-financed subsidy in case of illness.""65 The Law for Regulation of Wages introduced guidelines for calculating salaries. Based on the principle of comparable pay for equal demands on an individual’s time and energy, its goal was to guarantee a decent standard of living for everyone who worked hard. The law stated, “Grading of salaries must correspond to the actual demands of the work involved. It therefore doesn't matter what job the individual has. Personal engagement is the decisive factor.""66 The regulation further called for an adjustment in salary for employees with unavoidable financial hardships, in order to guarantee their standard of living. Even time lost from work due to weather conditions became a factor. It also required that every citizen receive pay for overtime. The wage law did not level off personal income regardless of occupation. Grading took such factors into consideration as physical or mental demands of a job, the precision or independent initiative required, education, hazards and experience. Its purpose was to establish a system that could be applied to the most diverse careers and activities and help reduce social and economic differences. It acknowledged the value of honest labor and the need to adequately compensate all who perform it. A guiding principle of the wage grading program was not to reduce the standard of living of previously higher paid associates, but to elevate that of those who earned less. This arrangement sliced into the profits of industry. By 1938, the costs to employers for workers' salaries had risen by another 6.5 percent.67 They included paid holidays for labor, a measure Hitler personally introduced. The wage law established a minimum monthly income per person, sufficient to guarantee a decent living standard. It affected 96 percent of all salaries nationwide. The Führer himself wrote that bringing a particular class of people into the community “does not succeed by dragging down the upper classes, but by elevating the lower. This process can never be carried out by the higher class, but by the lower one fighting for its equal rights.""68 His concern for the welfare of poorer working people sometimes led to Hitler’s personal involvement in correcting lesser social ills. During a dinner monolog, he once complained of the contrast in comfort and luxury between first, second and third class passenger accommodations on steamship lines: “It’s unbelievable that no one worried about how conspicuous the differences in living conditions of this sort were.” Apparently during a tour of an ocean liner, Hitler took umbrage at the comparatively wretched crew’s quarters. He ordered them upgraded on all passenger ships. The controversy he later described in a discussion about social problems with Abel Bonnard, a member of the Academie Francaise, in May 1937: “When we demanded that crew members should have better quarters, we received the answer that space on large steamers is too precious to fulfill our wishes. When we required that crew members should have a deck specially reserved for them to get fresh air, we were told that this involves technical difficulties the engineers haven't solved yet.""69 As can be imagined, these objections had no influence on Hitler’s resolve. He further related to his French guest, “Today crews on the ships have decent cabins. They have their own deck where they can relax on good deck chairs, they have radios for diversion. They have a dining room where they take their meals with a deck officer. All these improvements really weren't so costly. They just had to want to do it.” Funneling officers into the same mess hall as the sailors corresponded to Hitler’s commitment to demolish class barriers throughout society. The German navy custom of providing four menus per ship, the quality of meals varying according to rank, he also abolished. Observing once at dinner that “during the World War, the field kitchen was incomparably better when officers “had to be fed from it to,” Hitler arranged that henceforth, the German armed forces nourish all ranks with the same rations. “The view that it will weaken authority if distinctions are not maintained is groundless,” he contended. “Whoever can do more and knows more than another will have the authority he needs. For one who is not superior in ability and knowledge, his rank in whatever office he tenants won't help.""70”  “Corrections in salary, benefits and accommodations not only raised the standard of living for labor, but helped integrate it socially. Advantages previously associated with middle class prestige became universal. This diminished one more status symbol dividing the complacent, privileged caste from those seeking acceptance. Hitler had no faith in the good will of the bourgeois and in fact blamed it for Germany’s class barriers. He passed laws making exploitation of labor a punishable offense: “This must be considered necessary as long as there are employers “who not only have no sense of social responsibility, but possess not even the most primitive feeling for human rights.""71 In January 1934, the government enacted the Law for Regulation of National Labor, containing 73 paragraphs. At a press conference, Reich’s Labor Minister Franz Seldte defined the foundation of the law as removal of “unsavory” class distinctions which had previously contributed to the collapse of the German economy, in favor now of “emphasizing the concept of social esteem,” and the leadership idea in business life.72 The law’s vocabulary replaced the terms “employer and employee” with “leader and follower.” It designated respective roles in this way: “The leader of the facility makes decisions for the followers in all matters of production in so far as they fall under the law’s regulation. He is responsible for the welfare of the followers. They are to be dutiful to him, in accordance with the mutual trust expected in a cooperative working environment.""73 The law imposed moral obligations on both. The German economist Dr. Hans Leistritz described them in these words: “Both the facility leader and the followers are under the commission of the people. Each always faces the same choice, of whether he should fulfill his duty or become caught up in self-serving goals. Both the facility leader and the followers can face disciplinary action that punishes transgressions against this social code of honor.” The law cited examples, such as “if a contractor, leader of the facility or other supervisory personnel misuse their authority in the workplace to unethically exploit the labors of members of the following or insult their esteem.” The law likewise held workers accountable for “jeopardizing the harmony of the workplace by intentionally “stirring up their co-workers.""74 Though according management autonomy in decision-making, the law included serious restrictions as well. Business owners and directors were responsible not only for sound fiscal management of the company, but for the protection of employees from abuse. This was not presented as benign advice from the government. It was a law word for word. Income and profit were no longer the primary objectives of an enterprise. The well-being of its associates became a concurrent purpose. The Reich’s Ministry of Labor published a table of offenses under the category of unjust exploitation of employees. These included paying salaries below fixed wage scales or failure to compensate workers for overtime, refusing to grant employees vacations, cutting back hours, providing insufficient meals, inadequate heating of work stations, and maintaining an unhygienic or hazardous work environment. Supervisors were even disciplined for browbeating their staff to work harder.75  Excerpt From: Tedor, Richard. “Hitler's Revolution.” iBooks.  This material may be protected by copyright.

Don't start off with Capital, it is very dense, and can be extremely arduous (esp. the first few chapters) Heres what I reccommend:  1) Principles of Communism by Engels. Good starting, very simple, very fast. Then I would go to   2) The Communist Manifesto by Marx/Engels. Also simple and fast. Intro to main tenants of Communism. I warn you at this point that a few things about communism turn people away from it. Remember, in Marxist terms, the state is simply a mechanism of class rule. It isn't always some hyper-bureaucratic machine. Marxist-Communists aim for the state (dictatorship of the proletariat) to be democratic and liberatory. There are strains of anti-state communism (anarcho-communism and some left communism), which you might be interested in since you are anti-establishment, but even non-marxist communists agree that marx is a great theorist. Anyways, continuing. You need to learn the basics of dialectics.   3) I suggest searching the sub for ""dialectical materialism"" and you will find many writings explaining it. It can be a little difficult, but its pretty important.  4) Okay so now to economics. I reccommend starting with Wage Labour and Capital by Marx. Pretty quick read. Its kind of important to read the introduction with this one.   5) By this time, you might want to start Capital. Its online free, but better to read (imo) with a physical copy. Capital is dense, the first few chapters can be a struggle, but if you really want to understand communism, specifically Marxism, its an essential. WHILE READING IT, WATCH THE SERIES OF LECTURES BY DAVID HARVEY! THEY WILL HELP YOU IMMENSELY  Sidenote: the book your friend mentioned was either three component parts of marxism or state and revolution. Not my favorite work of Lenin, but important to understanding Leninism (a separate tendency from Marxism).   I'm not linking any of these other suggestions, but they're online free and im sure a google search will find them:   Critique of the Gotha Program- Marx Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism- Lenin (This is good for understanding imperialism in Lenin's time, but not as much today. However many of his points are still applicable, imperialism in the 2010s is much different than imperialism in 1910s) On Contradiction- Mao (good for those materialist dialectics) Reform or Revolution- Luxemburg   Since I feel like you would be interested in Left Communism or Anarcho-communism, for questions on those beliefs you should visit r/leftcommunism and r/anarchy101.

The purpose of the state is to maintain and reproduce base economic relations that permeate society. This is done through violence, repression, conessions, and ideology. The government is the high apparatus of the state, but it is not identical to the state. Government officials cannot be elected to transform the class character of the state. The military, police, etc. are part of the state. The state also includes ruling class ideology meant to maintain these class relations. The state, in the final instance, will protect the interests of the ruling class. As long as classes exist, the state will always be the dictatorship of one class over another. I'd highly recommend reading State and Revolution by Lenin to get a good understanding of the function of the state in class society."

An example of his work is Anarchy and Scientific Communism.  One thing Bukharin generally does is make a distinction between the object and the class character that applies to that object in class society. In particular, the object in this case refers to government/administration whereas the class character refers to class domination. In other words, a government/administration becomes characterized as a state when its used in class society by one social class to dominate another social class. In a classless society, it is not the object that withers away, but the class character that applies to it."

If you keep increasing the compensation for labor to match the increase in production time you'll obviously get no surplus value generated, yes. What is the doubt exactly? The entire point of surplus value is work done over and above that needed to generate the compensation received for the sale of your labor power. This has nothing to do with considering the wages per day or per hour (which has absolutely no significance at the logical level)."
communism101,343vso,ksan,2,Tue Apr 28 10:39:19 2015 UTC,"What Marx is trying to do here is tease out a certain quality of human labor that forms the linchpin for his whole analysis of capitalism. Note this passage from Chapter 7:   The value of a day’s labour-power amounts to 3 shillings, because on our assumption half a day’s labour is embodied in that quantity of labour-power, i.e., because the means of subsistence that are daily required for the production of labour-power, cost half a day’s labour. But the past labour that is embodied in the labour-power, and the living labour that it can call into action; the daily cost of maintaining it, and its daily expenditure in work, are two totally different things. The former determines the exchange-value of the labour-power, the latter is its use-value. The fact that half a day’s labour is necessary to keep the labourer alive during 24 hours, does not in any way prevent him from working a whole day.   In other words, when the capitalist only has the worker work for 6 hours (the amount of time it takes for the laborer to produce the value of his subsistence wage), the capitalist makes the mistake of equating the working time (and thus the value it produces) with the worker's wage. He's treating the exchange value of the worker's labor (six hours of labor-time) as equivalent with the result of the use value of that labor (the capacity to produce 12 hours of labor).  Of course, the capitalist doesn't have to do this. The capitalist can pay the worker the exchange value appropriate to his labor and derive a use value that yields an quantity independent of the wage. In later chapters, you will see how these two values can move independently from one another and produce different results for the capitalist (what will be revealed as the rate of exploitation).  The confusion comes from the fact that, in practice, the two qualities of exchange value and use value found in wage labor are not immediately apparent - the relationship between them is fetishized, and that fetishized relationship is known as exploitation. The wage appears to the casual observer as payment for a certain quantity of work - i.e. there is an ostensible agreement between employer and employed that the worker works for a certain amount of time and receives a wage that is proportional to that amount (e.g. for hourly workers, the hour; for salaried workers, a year).   Because of this fetishized character of wage labor, it is in a sense impossible for the capitalist to not exploit workers - i.e. exploitation is inherent in the wage-form itself. So no matter what amount of time the worker is employed, there is always a certain ratio between wage and value produced that is independent of that amount of time. That is why this example can seem counterintuitive at first glance: the capitalist in the example who has his worker work for 6 hours is defying the very logic of capitalist wage relations."
communism101,343vso,craneomotor,3,Tue Apr 28 14:56:08 2015 UTC,"I think your explanation about the difference between the exchange and use values of wage labor is OK; not sure if that will help OP, since their doubt seems a bit more basic than that from what I can understand, but anyways.  This, though:   Because of this fetishized character of wage labor, it is in a sense impossible for the capitalist to not exploit workers - i.e. exploitation is inherent in the wage-form itself. So no matter what amount of time the worker is employed, there is always a certain ratio between wage and value produced that is independent of that amount of time. That is why this example can seem counterintuitive at first glance: the capitalist in the example who has his worker work for 6 hours is defying the very logic of capitalist wage relations.   I don't think that's right. There is an inherent exploitation in the capitalist mode of production even if every commodity is exchanged at its value. So the worker sells their labor power/capacity at its value, the capitalist sells the commodities produced at their value, and even in this situation it is perfectly possible that exploitation has happened (and, as you said, nobody notices, in principle, because apparently only fair exchanges have occurred). This does not mean exploitation is impossible though: if my salary is high enough I most definitely won't be exploited in any meaningful sense. If you claim otherwise you'd have to defend that anyone who receives a salary is exploited, which is obviously nonsense (think of CEOs, or Hollywood actors, etc)."

If you claim otherwise you'd have to defend that anyone who receives a salary is exploited, which is obviously nonsense (think of CEOs, or Hollywood actors, etc).   Just to clarify, I said non-exploitation is impossible.  I take your point about workers that receive superwages are not meaningfully exploitated, especially if the wage is merely a formal allowance for someone who is in fact a capitalist.  That said, I'll maintain that non-exploitation is impossible in regards to the wage-form abstraction. That is, once we get to a certain level of analytical abstraction, away from practical contigencies like the ones you point out. Does this mean that actors and athletes are, in principle, exploited by capital? Probably! But Marx's analysis isn't really concerned with hashing out whether individuals were exploited so much as it was with the aggregate manifestations of capital, class dynamics, etc. So I don't know that saying ""actors are exploited"" really has any bearing for the analysis, so much as it has for praxis and organizing."
communism101,343vso,craneomotor,2,Tue Apr 28 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"So your claim is right at the the most abstract level only: the class of people performing wage labor as a whole must be exploited for capitalism to exist (and I'd add: in the imperialist epoch, this analysis can only be made internationally). Is that what you are saying? That much I can agree with. This is not terribly useful for concrete praxis and organizing, though, as you later claim, since that kind of thing by necessity cannot exist outside ""practical contingencies"". So I'm a bit confused about what is your argument here, but I guess this is a bit off topic by now."
communism101,343vso,ksan,2,Tue Apr 28 16:48:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what I'm saying.  I agree that these things can't exist outside of practical contingencies, and that's an important caveat. But if we're going read Marx's argument correctly, I think it's important that we follow his lead and acknowledge abstractions where they occur.  That said, if OP had asked whether we should organize actors because they are exploited, I would have given a very different answer. And I think that's what you're getting at."

Isn't this precisely one of those issues where Marx introduces determinations that in theory would belong to the third volume to explain things? I'm specifically thinking of how he is forced to mention the existence of many capitals in competition, this being the actual (and only possible) mode of existence of capital, and how this drives increasing innovation but also exploitation, etc. This would in theory belong to a latter volume, the first one focusing in the immediate process of production from the point of view of capital in general.  This in fact would be one of the issues which makes the logical development in Capital not purely Hegelian (even in inverted form), since the development of categories does not absolutely advance by itself through inner contradictions and cannot be shown in 100% clean order. As Ilyenkov says Marx introduces categories, which have inner tensions and contradictions, but at key moments he just resorts to empirical investigation to add further determinations that solve the problems but that cannot be purely derived ""logically"". Precisely like the issue of what exactly does wage labor in the abstract lead to.  Not sure if I'm making sense, and this is kinda off topic and dense, but I think it's probably useful information for those reading this thread."

communism101,343vso,craneomotor,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"Marx is certainly concerned with the rate of surplus value, but I think it's right that he's not strictly concerned with it at this point in the argument.  But, yes, his point is that labor-power is a unique commodity - it's the only one that can create new values. Other commodities merely transfer their pre-existing value to the new commodities (but again, only with the help of human labor, which is another unique property that human labor has), so there's no opportunity for surplus value in those transfers.  Think back to when Marx discussed whether profit was derived from buying low and selling high - the answer was ""no"" because this merely shifts values around and can't explain long-run aggregate profits. Furthermore, if we assume that goods are traded for at their values, as Marx does here, we can't recourse to that explanation of profits.  So what he aims to demonstrate here is that human labor-power is the only commodity that results in new values for the owner without violating the laws of exchange. And he demonstrates this by showing the difference between what it costs and what it produces."

Background: With the collapse of the Soviet Union the transnational companies have been eager to gain entry to the ex Warsaw block countries and plunder its riches. The new Russian oligarchy has been resisting since they would like to exploit the region first. Both the Western and Russian governments have been interfering in the internal affairs of all these countries, trying to ensure that their men (and women) get into office.  Ukraine: The latest struggle between the West and Russia presented in 2013 as Ukraine deciding whether to orientate itself economically to Europe or Russia. Russian was successful in the first round as it won back Ukraine with the promise of large loans and cheap energy. This resulted in the West resorting to overt physical pressure by supporting Right wing and Neo-Fascist groups against the Russian leaning Ukrainian President - the violence in the capital and overthrow of the government was the result.   Conflict: The Russians support anyone who is a thorn in the West's plans, and this includes any independence movements.

Socialist states have militaries, and I’d imagine under communism the people would defend themselves, possibly having a local militia or something of the sort. I’m not sure to what degree these will be needed.   Where is the incentive to work?   Where is the incentive to work in capitalism, when those who work hard do not benefit from the fruits of their labor? Also, under socialism, if you can work, you have to in order to make a living.   How does socialism get rid of classes?   Proletarian dictatorship is a necessary precondition to classless society. Under socialism, as the proletarian state oppresses the bourgeoisie through violence, repression, and ideology, the state withers away and eventually the bourgeoisie disappears as a class. Thus, classless society emerges.   How does Socialism get rid of exploitation?   When the proletariat controls the means of production, the bourgeoisie won’t be extracting surplus value from the proletariat by buying their labor power. The class dominance of the proletariat will go hand in hand with ending exploitation.   Will a strong safety net exist?   Absolutely. If you are able to work, you will be able to find a job, and otherwise, your needs will be provided.   How will people's pay be determined? Who decides how much they are paid?   In socialist states like Cuba, pay is often based on how much a worker contributes. Under communism, there will be no money.   If someone's job can be replaced with a machine, what will happen? I've heard that in Socialism, technology will work to make our lives easier. Wouldn't it just mean that person is out of a job?   Socialist economic logic does not require a reserve army of the unemployed, so everyone will be able to find a job. If technology starts replacing jobs, people just won’t have to work as much.  Remember, the command economy of socialism is driven by fulfilling the needs of the proletariat. If less work needs to be done to produce means of subsistence, then people just won’t have to work as much. They won’t be punished for it through structural unemployment.   Do we vote for political representative and economic representatives in Socialism?   Take a look at Cuba’s democratic system here and here   Are there businesses that are independent of the state?   There could be in very early stages of socialism, as long as these private markets don’t dominate the economic logic of the country. However, expropriating private property is a very important step in building proletarian hegemony.   What's the difference between state socialism and state capitalism? State socialism and libertarian socialism?   State vs. libertarian socialism to me boils down to who is in charge of basic initiatives and day-to-day operations, state officials or the producers. In both instances, fundamental control of the means of production lies with the proletariat. State capitalism is state control of the means of production, in which private ownership and a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie remains but market forces don’t necessarily dominate.   How do artists make a living in socialism?   If their art is something that the workers decide they want then they’d be paid by the state. If not, then workers are encouraged to pursue hobbies and passions in their free time, which hopefully will be a significant amount of time."

Reasons for firing were:   1) a worker refusing to transfer, 2) liquidation of the enterprise, 3) the worker's unfitness for his or her job, 4) the systematic non-fulfillment of duties, 5) criminal acts, 6) excessive absenteeism, 7) long-term disability, and 8) restoration of a predecessor to a job   So you could be fired, but especially in a place like the USSR where there was a severe labor shortage, it was very easy to find a new job. And if there aren't enough jobs to go around, people just won't have to work as much. If they can work and don't want to do their job, and they refuse to get another one, then they probably won't be able to afford basic needs.   So classes don't dosapear under socialism, socialism just leads to Communism, which is where classes disapear?   Socialism is the process of classes disappearing, as the proletariat oppresses the bourgeoisie out of existence. Once this is achieved, there's no need for a state, and communism, the classless, moneyless, stateless society emerges.   Can you go into more detail on how the Capitalists extract surplus value?   I would seriously browse the FAQ and do some basic readings. But essentially capitalists buy labor power as a commodity, pay the proletariat enough to keep them working, but work them harder than for the amount they earn. This extra work they do is where surplus value comes from.   I've always heard Cuba described as state capitalist. How are they state socialist?   The commanding heights of the economy are dictated by collective ownership and control. State officials are not extracting surplus value from the workers, there is no commodification of labor, and democratic processes allow proletarian control.   How ishiw mug the worker contributes determined? The amount of hours they work? The amount of tables they build?   I think it depends on the state, or the specific job.   So if a machine is built that can extract gold from a mine more effectively than a worker, what happens to the workers into town that surrounds the mine? Their lives relied on that mine. Will they just have to find new jobs or what? I don't understand.   I think ideally they would go where work is needed and find other jobs. If there's no labor shortage, then they can go work somewhere and then everyone would just not have to work as many hours.   So do you mean whether or not the people buy their art or do you mean that the people like vote on whether or not they're allowed to just do art or something?   The latter, but it's not whether or not their allowed to make art but rather whether or not the working class decides it's a job they find use for and thus would pay them for."

communism101,33uvm8,ccommunist,2,Sat Apr 25 23:03:37 2015 UTC,"If decisions are made democratically, couldn't a community vote to oppress a group of people or prohibit certain goods?   Constitutional rights will prevent this. Any system could have that problem, from tyranny to capitalism to communism, and it will have to be watched out for and fought against with rights enshrined in the constitution and such.   How would a community defend itself?   Armed militias. An armed working class. If need be a standing army. Anything like that.   Where is the incentive to work?    To better yourself, to better society, to engage yourself, to hone skills, because if not you won't be able to survive, because without work society would collapse. In certain stages of socialism, working will be incentivized  by luxuries. Those who work will be able to consume more.   In a far future communist society (or even not so far future) very little work will actually need to be done. Menial labor will definitely fall by the way side at least. Automation will replace most manual and undesirable jobs. Engaging labor like design and art will exist forever probably, but many people enjoy to do that and don't need an incentive other than that enjoyment they derive from it.   In a moneyless gift economy, how do you stop people from taking ALL the watermelons?   There'd be no need for them to. They'd have them available when they want, so why take more than they can eat. If a watermelon hoarder did arise for some inconceivable reason than a system of police could prevent it.   How does socialism get rid of classes?   Because everyone owns the means of production.    How does Socialism get rid of exploitation?    The producers will control what they produce. Therefore they will not be exploited anylonger.   Will a strong safety net exist?   Very likely. Probably basic income, universal healthcare, universal education etc.   How will people's pay be determined? Who decides how much they are paid?   Market socialism a combination of the market and workers in cooperatives. In state socialism the state owned by the workers. In Communism there is no monetary payment. In certain labor hour based socialisms it would be based on the time you worked combined with productivity.   If someone's job can be replaced with a machine, what will happen? I've heard that in Socialism, technology will work to make our lives easier. Wouldn't it just mean that person is out of a job?   Yes but they will be able to easily find work elsewhere, and in the mean time they'd be cared for by the safety net.   Do we vote for political representative and economic representatives in Socialism?    Yes. For both the economy and the government, which is far more democratic and just than current capitalist systems where the economy is totalitarian and the ""democratic"" government entirely corrupted by money.    How do we figure out how to much of an item to produce in Socialism? What about in Communism?   Market socialism would use a market. State socialism would use rational democratic planning with perhaps managed and regulated markets where need be. Libertarian socialism would use horizontal participatory planning.    How do you decide the price of a product?   Market in market socialism. State in state socialism. Labor embodied in it in labor based socialism. Communes/confederations in anarchist socialism.   Are there businesses that are independent of the state?    In market socialism yes. In anarchism yes.  In certain state socialisms some are some are not. In total state socialism no.   What's the difference between state socialism and state capitalism? State socialism and libertarian socialism?   State socialism would be run by the workers whereas state capitalism is run by capitalists. In libertarian socialism there is no state or a very minimal one, and instead confederations of cooperatives and communes and unions run the economy democratically.   How do artists make a living in socialism?    In some socialisms they'd market their art. In others the state would apportion funds to artists based on popularity. In ararchism communes and such would support artists they liked.  In all socialisms a social saftey net will ensure that everyone can survive even if they do not directly profitable things, and instead do things like art."

This trauma didn't really begin abating until after WW2, by which time the USSR had developed socialist systems in countries that were less dedicated, providing room for subversion. Due to all the traumas, revisionism, Western propaganda, and Western interventions (war, espionage, etc), the USSR eventually disintegrated in a burst of counter-revolution despite having continued good economic growth."

I haven't read Reform or Revolution for quite a while, but I believe social democracy used to be a term applied to socialists in general, including both revolutionary socialists and gradualists. Socialists generally used the term social democracy to refer to their own theory and practice - Lenin used the term to refer to Marxist communism, Bernstein used the term to refer to his own gradualism.  Social democracy originally referred to Marxist socialists, but eventually also referred to revisionists as the revisionist movement gained traction. It eventually gained its modern connotations after WWI - sometime between the world wars, revolutionaries began to identify as such (and usually as communists), while revisionists identified as social democrats; eventually, the division became a split and the term social democracy came to be solely identified with gradualists. The Nordic model of the welfare state then became the standard to which social democracy is usually held.  Basically, when you hear of communists up to the early 20th century using the term social democracy in a positive light, you can always safely assume that they are using it to refer to the revolutionary socialist movement."

That being said, and as Marx also says in that letter, once class society develops certain laws inherent to the dominant mode of production start to dominate, and people cannot do whatever they want. So a capitalist society will need socialism to reach communism, and in general once an imperialist capitalism exists in the planet it will tend to subsume all pre-capitalist modes of production, rendering a straight transition to communism from anything other than capitalism (or socialism!) extremely unlikely."

To elaborate, essentially, the reason that we had to proceed through these various stages of development is because base economic conditions led to these social formations. Class society emerged out of the development of productive forces and the division of labor. Class relations are a necessary consequence of these economic formations. Agricultural development led to the exploitation of humans by others in order to be able to cultivate large amounts of land (slave labor), which was the first class formation. As history moved forward, technological developments and material conditions changed base economic logic, transforming the class conflicts. Out of slave society, the aristocracy rose up and exploited the peasants in feudal society. Under feudalism, the bourgeoisie emerged as a revolutionary class, and so on. Once class conflict had begun, class relations changed and progressed dialectically as each new revolutionary class became reactionary, until the proletariat becomes the ruling class, at which point all class distinctions begin to disappear."

So a doctor who has an extremely high salary would functionally be part of the bourgeoisie (you can actually see this every day), or at the very least the very wealthy petty bourgeoisie. A ""poor"" bourgeois would belong to the petty bourgeoisie also.  So: yes, relation to the means of production is fundamental, but those who treat it as absolute typically end up with abstractions which might be useful in some cases but do not reproduce the concrete reality of capitalism theoretically.

The only exception may be the relation to surplus value (the producer-appropriator class society), as taught by Marxists such as Richard Wolff, but even that is still related to the means of production class analysis. For example, in capitalist class society, the ownership class and the appropriator class would be one and the same. It's the private owners that appropriates and distributes the surplus value.  Also, it is possible for certain workers to be rich. It is possible to be paid a high amount of money. Workers like this are usually the non-productive workers (workers who do not produce commodities) and are paid with a portion of the surplus value."

On this point we, of course, say that we do not believe in God, and that we know perfectly well that the clergy, the landowners and the bourgeoisie invoked the name of God so as to further their own interests as exploiters. Or, instead of basing ethics on the commandments of morality, on the commandments of God, they based it on idealist or semi-idealist phrases, which always amounted to something very similar to God's commandments.  We reject any morality based on extra-human and extra-class concepts.

We maintain on the contrary that all moral theories have been hitherto the product, in the last analysis, of the economic conditions of society obtaining at the time. And as society has hitherto moved in class antagonisms, morality has always been class morality; it has either justified the domination and the interests of the ruling class, or ever since the oppressed class became powerful enough, it has represented its indignation against this domination and the future interests of the oppressed. That in this process there has on the whole been progress in morality, as in all other branches of human knowledge, no one will doubt. But we have not yet passed beyond class morality. A really human morality which stands above class antagonisms and above any recollection of them becomes possible only at a stage of society which has not only overcome class antagonisms but has even forgotten them in practical life.

communism101,33egpj,BioQuark,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:47:46 2015 UTC,So the unemployed would still be given their needs? Wouldn't it be unfair for the other type of workers that can't be substituted by machines?
communism101,33egpj,BioQuark,10,Tue Apr 21 21:58:14 2015 UTC,"Well to begin with, the whole nature of employment and jobs would be different than in capitalism. People are no longer selling their labor for money and there wouldn't be a ""job market"" in the traditional sense you're thinking of. Structural unemployment wouldn't be a thing. People can practically always find other ways to contribute, and ideally, work wouldn't even be divided the way it is today, with workers tending to be specialized and doing repetitive work.   https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm   Further, the division of labour implies the contradiction between the interest of the separate individual or the individual family and the communal interest of all individuals who have intercourse with one another. And indeed, this communal interest does not exist merely in the imagination, as the “general interest,” but first of all in reality, as the mutual interdependence of the individuals among whom the labour is divided. And finally, the division of labour offers us the first example of how, as long as man remains in natural society, that is, as long as a cleavage exists between the particular and the common interest, as long, therefore, as activity is not voluntarily, but naturally, divided, man’s own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him. For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic. This fixation of social activity, this consolidation of what we ourselves produce into an objective power above us, growing out of our control, thwarting our expectations, bringing to naught our calculations, is one of the chief factors in historical development up till now."
communism101,33egpj,Rythoka,4,Tue Apr 21 22:13:50 2015 UTC,"It seems like yoy missed the ""from each according to his ability"" part.  Perhaps at some point there will be so little labor available that there won't be anything for a large number of people to do. At that point, I'd assume something like timesharing for jobs would be developed.  The rest of the time would give you freedom to develop yourself personally, or do personal projects for the benefit of yourself and others.  Just because there's no required labor doesn't mean there'll be nothing productive to do."

That wouldn't be a problem in a communist society,  so we'd be developing a more educated populace, who are more able to do those jobs that can't be automated."
communism101,33egpj,Blackbelt54,6,Tue Apr 21 22:32:06 2015 UTC,"Why would there be any unemployment? In capitalism it is most profitable to hire the least number of people and work them to death, keeping a reserve army of the unemployed to replace anyone who balks(or dies).  In communism, more workers. less work, means each worker works less.   if those who work are those who eat,   I realize some people not understanding communism might say this because they are still doing the bidding of their capitalist owners by pitting workers against workers and have yet to understand the transformative nature of production in a communist economy. People will work for the personal satisfaction of contributing to a voluntary society. And we will provide that opportunity to everyone."

communism101,33egpj,ruscommmie,3,Wed Apr 22 04:29:52 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the development of technology of production implies in unemployment of the manual workers, and at a later stage, may even cause the unemployment of teachers, engineers, medics, and so on. Not all manual workers would have enough intellectual background to migrate to that type of job, nor would there be enough job openings to support all of those who could. How would this be dealt with? We can't just deny the advance of technology, and suppressing it would cause just as many problems.   This is actually only a problem in capitalism.  Capitalism, as a system, pits the worker against technological advance. As a worker in capitalism you are afraid of technology because it doesn't eat, never gets tired, never gets sick, and won't argue with its boss about inhuman labor conditions. You can be replaced by technology because you are merely a resource for the owner--not an inherent and equal part of the organization.  Consider fast food workers and the 'fight for $15'. One of the arguments against a $15 wage that you'll hear is that 'if we pay workers too much, they'll be replaced by machines, thus depriving these people of work entirely.'  Would this happen if the workers had an equal say in the workplace? No! If workers ran the workplace they would embrace new technology! Consider that technology would enable them to produce the same amount of goods with LESS input all around from them. This means shorter hours, easier labor, more free time, more room for creative, non-mechanized work. Workers would of course embrace this. The only reason they don't is because they know that they are expendable resources, not equal partners--so automation means less compensation or the loss of a job.  In capitalism, when you get rid of the workers and replace them with machines the owners will still make money. The enormous profits that McDonalds makes will still be generated if they have automated check stands. Only now they will be even less equally distributed since zero percent are going to the worker class.   Ultimately then, this is the inevitable goal of capitalism: To replace workers with automation.  Consider though whether automation is inherently a 'bad' goal. Is working for years and years for low wages at a fast food restaurant inherently fulfilling? Is that type of work inherently especially challenging or gratifying to the human spirit?  With automation within communism, you have a society where the use value of that work still exists, but instead of its rewards being consolidated to an owner class, they are enjoyed equally. This means that less labor needs to be expended to produce the same value. This proportionally frees up the labor power of society to do other things that are more fulfilling to the human spirit than working at a job where you are constantly told by your boss and your community that your time isn't ""worth"" a living wage!  Furthermore, you have to understand that humans love work. It is one of the core aspects of our being. However, we are all individuals with our own interests, goals, and passions. Forcing people to sell their labor in order to survive means that a proportion of individuals spend their time in jobs that are personally unfulfilling--and which thus give them (and others) the impression that they simply ""don't like work"". I don't think that's true. The human being loves creating and expressing--communism frees us from wage labor and allows us to pursue gratifying and essential work."
communism101,33fiy8,blancandrin3,9,Wed Apr 22 02:38:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's dangerous to go too far in this line of thinking, since ultimately the subjective reality of a state is largely influenced by material conditions. That being said, as the Dictatorship of the Proletariat is the organ of proletarian class rule over the bourgeoisie, the state will act in the interest of the proletariat, in the final instance. Proletarian class rule will look like expropriation of private property, planned economy for the benefit of the workers, collective control and nationalization of the commanding heights of the economy, etc. It will also repress the bourgeoisie through legal and extralegal means, including through militant violence, ideology, and the smashing of bourgeois superstructure. This means combating white supremacy, patriarchy, etc. As far as specific organization, democratic centralism is often an advantageous way to structure the government. Daily life, under socialism, would mostly consist of workers still working, but instead of their labor power being exploited by the bourgeoisie, the fruits of their labor will be the benefit of the whole proletariat. The economy will be a planned command economy, meaning the driving force of the economy will be continuous fulfillment of the needs of the people. This will look like public education, healthcare, full employment, food and housing, etc."
communism101,33fiy8,Blackbelt54,4,Wed Apr 22 03:56:38 2015 UTC,"I would recommend that you check out State and Revolution by Lenin. Your questions are fairly broad. Lenin's text should help narrow them down to something more specific. However, in a broad sense I will answer with the following. A dictatorship of the proletariat should have all of its political power vested in the working-class, and that political power should be exercised through popular democratic bodies. The economic structure of a society with a dictatorship of the proletariat should be organized along democratic lines as well. Just like the state, industry and distribution should be managed by the workers in each respective industry through councils, co-operative organizations, unions etc. That, in the broadest possible terms, describes a proletarian dictatorship.   Nationally or economically specific features will of course impose other factors onto this basic definition. Other organizational questions such as the nature of ownership of industry in a socialist state, the amount of centralization etc. can be factored into the above definition as well, and largely depend on the tendency that an individual subscribes to."

Communists are not mere iconoclasts looking to destroy any symbol of bourgeois society. The point of a communist society is to distribute commodities by their human need, determined in a democratic fashion. Art works and rare antiques would probably best serve human need in a museum, but I'm sure there other uses for them as well in schools or buildings of societal importance.   Overall, the takeaway is that there needs to be democratic control over all commodities, including antiques. A singular individual's mere taste would probably not justify the exclusion of a commodity to the rest of society.   tl;dr http://img.pandawhale.com/71771-that-belongs-in-a-museum-gif-I-UqaM.gif"

From what I can gather it's just that the number of protected churches went down from ~7,000 to ~1,000. Does this mean that all 6,000 were destroyed after not being protected? Were all 6,000 even safe to inhabit? Were any of the buildings repurposed to something else which was more pressing?   Those questions should be answered before claiming that Stalin just went around destroying churches.  Unfortunately, I'm not too much of an expert of the cultural revolution so I can't speak much in that regard. What I do know is that many laws went into effect at that time to protect many historical and architectural landmarks. So, obviously the story is much more complicated than you're making out to be."

There are far more antiques - and other non-reproducible items of value/interest - than would ever fit in museums.  We'd have to build antique warehouses. Even modern museums have far more items than they can display at any given time.  I personally own antiques that I love having in my home but that certainly don't merit inclusion in a museum. It also overlooks unique desirable items that are in the process of being created, like art from living artists. Picasso was famous in his own lifetime, would everything he created automatically go to a museum the instant he made it?  If I had a painting of his from before he was famous, at what point would it be confiscated?"

New institutions may also come to fruition to deal with the post scarcity of treasures. I don't think personal possession can justify things which hold a great social value."

Regardless, my answer that you were responding to originally, was about establishing democratic control of commodities. The small trinkets and rare antiques should all fall under that. What that means is for future societies to figure out. Most likely many of those things would be most useful in schools, museums, post offices, libraries, and other places that are available to the public. Whatever better serves the need of society is better than the appeasement of taste (particularly a bourgeois taste such as ""fine"" furniture) .  As far as confiscation, I'm not particularly sure on how to deal with that. I hope by the time we are in a Communist society, it will not be an issue."

I'm just asking about how people get access to and trade items they desire.   An appreciation of beauty isn't bourgeois; in fact, it's the working class that crafts and designs these things.

communism101,33az0i,laserbot,2,Wed Apr 22 16:28:23 2015 UTC,"I think there are multiple layers here.  First to clarify something that wasn't overtly stated, but that is frequently asked: Trinkets and personal property. You would have a right to your personal property. Communism is against 'private property' in the sense of the 'means of production', but not in the sense that humans have things that they have attached sentimental value to. So if you have a collection of whatever historical trinket because it excites your human spirit, nobody is going to object.  However, with regard to 'priceless' artifacts of human achievement (great works of art, etc.), my opinion is that those things are for humanity to enjoy, not to be stuffed away in a private collection to be admired exclusively by a lucky individual at the expense of everyone else.  The problem is that there is a gray area here between personal property and cultural artifacts--and that's a social question that needs to be addressed more widely."
communism101,33az0i,CantankerousGrump,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:37:51 2015 UTC,How will people exchange/acquire these trinkets and personal property? Doesn't the existence of even these small privately owned items imply the continuation of some sort of market and means of exchange (money)?
communism101,33az0i,laserbot,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:02:57 2015 UTC,"People collected things long before there were markets, and will continue to do so long after markets.  Below is just my thought, I'm not claiming any expertise, so please correct anything wrong:  Assuming the need of a market is assuming that there is an exchange value for these trinkets as commodities. However, these are not specifically commodities, they are merely items with curiosity value for individuals--so you don't necessarily need a market for exchange.  While I don't know for sure, my guess is that there would be some form of gift economy based on communal relationships where people would freely exchange these sorts of things."
communism101,33az0i,CantankerousGrump,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:27:29 2015 UTC,"I think this is a pretty good answer, though I disagree with you somewhat over the definition of commodities. I understand that in current capital-based modes of thought a commodity is a raw material/agro product but it seems like in the future any desirable item/service could be considered a commodity.  My town has this program where people can exchange their time on a one-to-one basis, I do an hour of gardening for you (for example) and my hour goes into a bank that I can trade to any other participant for an hour of their time.

It is making an extremely complicated yet efficient path toward Earth orbit. I think it's aliens, I watch a lot of movies from before the revolution, but the rest of the group disagrees. We don't talk about it much, but the small conversations break up the serious ones well. It's been almost a week and the alien ship is now in orbit. It took a while for the telemetrists to establish stable communication, but they managed to do it with a simple radio. OPTION 1: ""Space Communism"" (My predicted outcome) The first transmission they sent was the periodic table. We responded with the same. Since then linguists have been using stuff like that to build a language hybrid between Esperanto and the aliens' language so that we can have higher-level discussion. THis went extraordinarily well and within a year we were able to make the proper accommodations to construct an embassy for the newcomers. They called themselves the Orich and came from a planet a few hundred light-years away. They started receiving our first radio signals and sent a ship to us to reach out. By the time we got here, we no longer needed their help! We exchanged science and technology, as well as cultural tidbits. Orich music is... well... interesting. Some people like it though. The Orich that arrived have begun to settle into the less industrial cities around the globe, and in a show of solidarity we sent their ship back with a crew of humans to go to their planet and do the same. OPTION 2: ""Nazis in Space"" (I think this is the least likely) The first transmission they sent were polar coordinates. They were the coordinates for Beijing, the largest city on Earth, so everyone in the councils thought that it would be a meeting spot. We were very wrong, it was the landing site. The Orich prefer ground invasion to orbital bombardment since they only have one ship, but they are still a considerable force. Since they culled the Chinese councils, they spread west in search of more open land. They set up base in the steppes, which gave us time to rally up a new Red Army. The old one was dissolved decades ago, ad that was after they had been relegated to manning parades and government functions. We didn't have much knowledge on how to fight, but old tactics from the second World War proved very useful. The Orich behaved much like the Hitlerites did. We only managed to defeat them due to their small numbers and their hate of all things human. THey refused to eat any food native to Earth, so they were trying to build farms when we attacked. The farms were staffed by enslaved humans! Anyway, next time we may not be so lucky. OPTION 3: ""Corporations in Space"" (Highly unlikely) The first transmission they sent was a trade offer. They had already learned our language. They would give us technology and riches in exchange for allowing them to build factories on the Earth. At first we complied, but when they started paying people wages and forcing them to get necessities with this token economy we started to get skeptical. Word of this quickly went up the councils and we decided that we could not repeat the atrocities that came before the revolution. We sent a message that we would take managerial control of the factories. The trade was still valid, we would just be more strict about how things are run. The Orich did not like this at all. They started bombing the cultural centers where councils met and sending relentless propaganda to those unlucky enough to be working in the factories. We pulled together old weapons from the last war and attempted to assemble a new Red Army. These efforts were fruitless as more and more people defected. There were a few reasons to defect. The Orich had better medicine, for one. They mostly lived in rural areas so some defectors felt they could have more private lives this way. Some just wanted to be on the winning side. But whatever the reasons, the remains of our new Red Army ended up having to resort to guerilla warfare to make any progress. We studied a lot of Che Guevara and the Vietnam war, and did what we could. Their numbers were small, but their ideological presence was huge. Now a days we just roam around, trying to recruit who we can and working towards the day when we can get the workers to rise up with us, like their great-grandfathers and mothers before them. Those are some conjectures. Really, depending on the aliens, anything could be possible. They may have had different modes of production all together. I still think it's most possible for them to be communist though, even without the same revolutionary theory we have on Earth."

communism101,32wg32,HapTrek13,6,Fri Apr 17 15:57:38 2015 UTC,"To expand /u/timemachine_GO's post a bit...  Labour is not a commodity. Seeing labour as a commodity gets you into all kinds of theoretical problems trying to work out the value of labour. That was one of the problems of Adam Smith's and David Ricardo's labour theory of value, before Marx. Marx's great insight in Capital is that labour power, someone's capacity to work, is the commodity that is bought and sold in the jobs market. Labour is the value-producing process that is the result of 'using' labour power. Labour power therefore has an exchange value, monetarily expressed in the wage, and a use-value, the value-producing labour process, like any other commodity.   I sell my labour power to a capitalist for, say, 40 hours a week. The value of 40 hours of labour power of a given skill-level is determined by the average required labour time (we call this 'socially necessary labour time', which is equivalent to 'value') taken to produce and maintain the worker at that skill level, which depends on all sorts of things (see other comments in this thread). The price of labour power (the wage) fluctuates around this value according to the laws of supply and demand.   Say I work in a chocolate factory, producing chocolate bars. Into the cost of production of those chocolate bars goes (a) the cost of the machinery/tools I needed to use over that period of time (say £250); (b) the cost of any raw materials I worked with (say £50); and (c) the cost of 40 hours of my labour power (say £200), to a total of £500. All these costs are paid by the capitalist before the work on producing the goods begins. The market value of chocolate bars is £1.25. We call (a) + (b) 'constant capital' because its value is simply transferred one-for-one into the price of the commodity. We call (c) 'variable capital' because the amount can change between the cost of producing the commodity and the price of the commodity itself. How is this?   The capitalist recoups their costs when I have produced 400 chocolate bars. At that point, I have created enough value for the capitalist to pay for the cost of my wages, as well as the cost of the constant capital. But I can produce more than 10 chocolate bars per hour. In fact, I can produce in total 500 chocolate bars in 40 hours. The capitalist then sells the whole batch for £625. Subtracting the £500 cost of production, the capitalist has made £125 profit, what we call 'surplus-value'. The capitalist bought my labour power for a certain amount of time, so even if I have paid for my wages after 32 hours, I have to work those extra 8 hours because that is the contract I have signed with the capitalist. Because of this, labour power is a special commodity that can produce more value than it costs in exchange (hence 'variable capital'), and profit is the unpaid labour of workers, which is is why we call this process exploitation.  Human labour will always produce a surplus: this is how we develop as societies, because we can invest the rest into increasing productivity, into science, technology, art, whatever, after the necessary costs of machinery, materials, and bare human essentials are deducted. What Marxists object to is the form of this surplus as surplus-value, where it is appropriated by private owners of the means of production, capitalists. This means that the people who create the surplus have no control over it and so no control over the society they have created. The alternative, socialism (and then communism), would be a system where that surplus belonged to the whole society and democratically controlled through a plan of production.   For more info, read Wage Labour and Capital and, if you have the time, Capital, Volume 1. It's definitely worth it!  EDIT: To respond more directly to your question, the chapter on the working day in Capital would be really interesting to read. It doesn't talk about wages specifically as far as I can remember but the points can be generalised. The struggle over the length of the working day was (and is) a matter of class struggle, a matter of politics. The arguments made by the capitalists are familiar ones: 'if we don't have 12 hour days, then how will any capitalists make any money? What will workers do with their extra time, they're too stupid to do anything but work for us half the time and sleep the rest!' etc. etc. These were presented as objective facts, but they were actually matters of class perspective. Similarly, the struggle over wages is a matter of class struggle over who gets the surplus value. The point to make is that if one doesn't think that the fast food workers don't deserve $15/hr, then why does the capitalist deserve that extra instead? If you look into it, both sets of arguments will probably come from a class position and since it's a matter of deserving, there probably won't be one answer that is objectively correct. Marxists should make the point that we are for the working class, so we argue on their side for higher wages, but that ultimately we want the working class to take political power (the dictatorship of the proletariat) and end the class struggle over wages (and the working day) once and for all. If we didn't have capitalists and a market in jobs, we could work less hours for higher pay and still probably produce more than we currently do."

Of course, prescriptions drop out of these sciences quite naturally since they concern society. This isn't uncommon in sciences that make claims that relate to human society.

communism101,32rd8t,ccommunist,5,Thu Apr 16 02:27:26 2015 UTC,"If you haven't, I would highly recommend reading State and Revolution by Lenin to understand the Marxist analysis of the state. But the state you described from the anarchist perspective to me sounds more like a government. The government is the highest apparatus of the state, but they are not identical. The state mechanism includes repression, violence, ideology, etc. I think in today's material conditions, a centralized government would probably be necessary. Imperialist threats and bourgeois counter-revolution from within would probably warrant a highly organized apparatus of repression. However, this state would look different than a capitalist state, as it will be in the process of withering away as it continues to destroy the bourgeoisie as a class."
communism101,32rd8t,Blackbelt54,3,Thu Apr 16 04:26:03 2015 UTC,"Anarchists oppose Marxism because it advocates taking state power...   We don't advocate for the seizure of state power. We advocate for the smashing of the state.    But according to anarchists, the state is a centralized organization ruled by the few, with a monopoly on the legal use of violence (armies, police, etc).  So, my question again: does the dictatorship of the proletariat have to be a state in the anarchist sense?    I guess, except that the DotP is not ruled by ""the few""; it's ruled by the working class, the majority in capitalist society.   The DotP is an interesting case in the way it differs from all previous states: it wears its class character on its sleeve. While the DotP definitely loses some characteristics of a state (this is why Lenin called it a ""semi-state""), one fundamental thing remains the same: the organized suppression of one class by another.   There are helpful links about this subject in the FAQ as well."

To give an analogy, the capitalist mode of production has a high amount of difficulty dealing with certain productive advancements such as the increase in automation. With automation increasing, and with capitalism being unsuitable to this level of productive development, society may eventually have no choice but to transition from capitalism to socialism."
communism101,32pzwz,audendante,2,Wed Apr 15 20:20:22 2015 UTC,"Well, the increase in automation means the decrease of the socially necessary labor time by which  commodities are produced, thusly lowering the rate of profit for the capitalists."

That said, democracy isn't the only diplomacy. For example, the East Germany was established with diplomacy between the USSR and the rest of the allies and did extremely well for itself in terms of production and social progress.

Trotsky mis-represented the debate, and his followers have made a disagreement from the 1920s the main point of their politics ever since. Check out Stalin's ""Problems of Leninism""; he gives the other side of the discussion there, and it's worth a read. The question wasn't whether or not socialism in one country was preferable, but rather, given the failure of the German revolution to materialize, what should be done in the Soviet Union? Trotsky's answer was ""permanent revolution!"", which sounded nice, but really had nothing to do with the concrete conditions as they existed at the time. It's unsurprising that he was thoroughly defeated within the CPSU(B).  No ""Stalinist"" is in favour of socialism in one country. In fact, socialism spread to nearly 1/3 the world's people and 1/6 the total land-area of the globe within 25 years of Trotsky making the charge of ""socialism in one country""."

In the span of a few decades the USSR eliminated homelessness, had the highest literacy rates, guaranteed employment, provided guaranteed and quality healthcare, made massive strides towards gender-equality, eliminated food insecurity, provided an unheard of standard of living for an empire that was previously failing at every turn, and uplifted hundreds of millions out of abject poverty. Everybody had food. Grocery stores were empty because people had easy access to their contents, unlike here in America where grocery stores need police officers to protect the food they send to the dump as the poor go without. Grocery stores were empty because pantries were full. The Russian Federation is still trying to regain many of the capabilities and standards of the old U.S.S.R., many of which it will never regain because those standards are hostile to capitalist interests.

In 1926 it was 13.4. The infant mortality rate was 26 per cent in 1913 and in 1926 it was 13.5 per cent. Under the census of 1897, the last general census before the World War, 37.9 per cent of the male population above seven years were literate and 12.5 per cent of the female population. During the next fifteen years literacy made no great strides among the population. The general census of December, 1926, however, revealed that the energetic struggle against illiteracy conducted by the Soviet State was bearing fruit. For the first time in Russian history the majority of the population could read and write. The percentages of literacy were 65.4 for males and 36.7 for females (above the age of seven years). Social insurance, conducted by the State, and under the direct control of the workers' organizations, includes insurance against disability and unemployment, for women during and after pregnancy, and covers mortuary payments to helpless dependents. This insurance is a charge against the employing industry, whether State, cooperative or private. Every employer must contribute 4.5 per cent of the amount of his payroll to the insurance fund."

This isn't true. Most likely these kind of stories were told by those who emigrated to the West and wanted to be allowed to stay there. In 1950-1980s, after the war, life was actually very easy - you had everything provided by the state, education, job, housing, etc. The problems began when people started to complain about quality - and mostly they wanted better consumer goods like clothes.

A wird die Ware direkt an B verkaufen und B sie direkt von A kaufen.

communism101,32gwzf,Bosco_Sauce,2,Mon Apr 20 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"In the entire quote A is seller, and B is buyer, but then suddenly ""for the future A would buy direct from B, and B sell direct to A."". He also writes that it is a sale from A's point of view, but how can it be a sale if he buys from B? Should it not be ""for the future B would buy direct from A, and A sell direct to B"" instead?   Be mindful of whose perspective he is talking about here in his hypothetical, where he (marx) is the capitalist. I think this is what is confusing you. From his perspective as capitalist, when he interacts with A he is making a purchase. And when he interacts with B he is making a sale.   Yet from A's perspective, A is ONLY EVER making a sale when A interacts with Marx. And from B's perspective, B is ONLY EVER making a purchase when B interacts with Marx.   The capitalist embodies both the purchase and the sale whereas A only embodies the sale and B only embodies the purchase. This is how it is inverted, and this inversion is seen as ""meritorious"" (I love this choice of word here. Almost seems tongue in cheek, as if he is laughing at the notion that by existing merely as the middle man one deserves a profit.)  So what Marx is saying is that two out of 3 parts necessary for this ""form"" of circulation are abstracted away from its very existence, or from it coming into existence. I'm not clear on whether or not this would be an aspect of his theory of alienation, but maybe it would be correct to say they are alienated from it. He is never seen as capitalist, or owner of capital. Only money to the individual selling commodities (A) and commodities to the individual purchasing them (B). Never is their true relationship revealed, regardless of it actually existing. It would look like magic to them."

They are workers who find themselves in a position of leadership inside the working class and use that position to  benefit the bourgeois. Particularly, union leaders.

I believe that the next crisis of capitalism will cause the bourgeoisie to entirely squeeze  everyone. The petite Bourgeois will have no choice but to join fascism or fight against capitalism.

I noticed that you posted on /r/depression a while back- it might be a good idea to go there again and/or go to /r/suicidewatch if things get real serious. They obviously aren't going to give much help on the political side of things, but it could help."

I live my life under the principle that what I do personally (that is, what I consume) is apolitical but I have a responsibility to be involved politically through collective actions (participating in movement building and activism). I have also toyed with the idea of what is called ""class suicide"" or forfeiting my class privilege, such as donating all my money to a party. This is an option that will always be open to you, and I think a much more intellectually appropriate political action that actual suicide. My advice would be to hold off on making any choices like this until you can make them in the right state of mind and when you are a bit older and have more experience to weigh. In the meantime I've found that these two things are most important for myself: continue to study, and find a community IRL to help hold me accountable to the movement.

communism101,32dylo,l337kid,2,Tue Apr 14 06:13:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry it's taken me so long to come back around to this. I needed to do some reading for it.  When someone today says ""Ricardo was wrong,"" what they are typically referring to is the Labor Theory of Value (LTV). The LTV, as a value theory, postulates that commodities contain a ""value substance."" This value is distinct from but reflected in the prices we see on store shelves. Furthermore, the theory claims that the amount a commodity contains is proportional to the amount of human labor that it took to produce it.   Setting aside more common but incorrect criticisms of the LTV, the theory is still roundly rejected by contemporary economists, because they operate within a conceptual paradigm known as marginalism. Marginalism came forward as a response to the failure of classical economics to answer a fundamental question: from whence come the prices of commodities (or more correctly, how can we demonstrate the connection between value and price)?   It is not clear exactly which properties of commodities correspond to profit. Does profit come from money, capital or means of production? Is it due to abstinence of the capitalists, the supervisory work of the capitalist, the capitalist’s ingenuity, risk, or the time of production? Are wages related to the value of means of subsistence, the disutility of work or the productivity of labor? Is rent related to the scarcity of land or the marginal fertility of land?  (https://kapitalism101.wordpress.com/2011/09/30/marginal-futility-reflections-on-simon-clarkes-marx-marginalism-and-modern-sociology/)   Marginalism sets these questions aside and instead holds that, what the ""underlying nature"" of commodities might be is not relevant (and might not even exist). What instead matters is that commodities are objects of utility or subjective desire, and thus prices are established according to the degree to which consumers are willing to substitute one commodity for another.  So to recap, the LTV, as a value theory, holds that commodities have value and labor is its substance, while marginalism holds that there is no value inherent in commodities beyond what arises out of the normal course of economic exchange.  Unfortunately, most marginalists interpret this difference in conceptualization as a disproof or supercession of value theory by marginalism. But this is not the case. Rather, the difference in conceptualization is just that - classical economics and contemporary or ""mainstream"" economics simply take up different questions and frame problems differently. Where marginalist economics is predominantly concerned with price analysis, classical economics, including Marx, is concerned with the philosophical question of the nature of value.  Of course, there is a lot of overlap between the two disciplines, and classical economists were considerably concerned with prices, putting a lot of effort towards reconciling discussions of value with analyses of price. Whether or not this reconciliation has been achieved is a tenditious question, one that provides additional motivation for the marginalist perspective to abandon the concept of value. But this conceptual maneuver is not a factual claim about value, and it does not eliminate the question of value as such - it just pushes it out of view.  In that vein, inherent in each theory is a criticism of the other. Marginalism implies that theories of value cannot reconcile theoretical accounts of value and observed movements in prices. Theories of value imply that marginalism provides an incomplete account of economic pheonemona by excluding value, and thus excluding the possibility of, for example, class analysis. But neither theory is a final, conclusive ""disproof"" of the other taken on its own terms. It merely points to a different set of analytical and theoretical concerns - which themselves might merit rejection, but then we've moved to a different part of the discussion.  So when you see people make the claim like ""Ricardo was wrong,"" keep this conceptual distinction in mind. Do not let people tell you that the LTV is ""wrong"" - and similarly, do not let Marxists tell you that marginalism (sometimes they refer to it as the subjective theory of value, or STV) is wrong either! They are merely distinct framings of economic problems, each of which have their own problems and shortcomings.  For more reading, you can refer to Simon Clarke's book Marx, Marginalism and Modern Sociology (a summary can be found here), and also to I.I. Rubin's Essays on Marx's Theory of Value."

Sraffa, the father of contemporary neo-Ricardianism, had this to say about what Ricardo's goal was:   [T]he problem of value which interested Ricardo was how to find a measure of value which would be invariant to changes in the division of the product; for, if a rise or fall of wages by itself brought about a change in the magnitude of the social product, it would be hard to determine accurately the effect on profits. . . . On the other hand, Ricardo was not interested for its own sake in the problem of why two commodities produced by the same quantities of labour are not of the same exchangeable value [which was a central problem for Marx]. He was concerned with it only in so far as thereby relative values are affected by changes in wages. (1981, pp. xlviii–xlix)"

Unless you're somehow capable of disappearing of the grid completely by producing all of your own resources, electricity, water, and so on (hint: you aren't) you have to buy things in order to survive.  As for voting... That depends on who you ask. Probably one of the larger devisions in socialist groups is reformism and revolutionism. Reformists generally believe that exisiting government systems are capable of being changed from pro-capitalist systems into pro-socialist systems from within, by creating a party and getting elected into power. Revolutionaries believe that can't be done and that the governing systems have to be taken down completely from outside, in a revolution, of course.  Personally I'm pretty solidly on the side of revolution. While I think some reformist tactics have their merits in the short term, pure reformism is a dead end, as the capitalist class wouldn't give up their power just because someone asked them to, if it were that easy capitalism wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes."

communism101,329rk5,AskMeAboutCommunism,5,Sat Apr 11 23:28:48 2015 UTC,"One of the problems with reformism is that we live in a global capitalist world dependent on capitalists accumulated power (capital).  Say a popular movement is formed in a country and a communist party is elected. What would happen would be that you'd have an aggressive reactionary propaganda campaign sponsored by capitalists and at the same time you'd have capital leaving the country.  This would most likely result in a temporary economic downturn which would be used by said reactionary propaganda campaign with a ""see what happens""-argument. Take Venezuela for example. The shortage of goods in Venezuela has nothing to do with any socialist government failures, it's rather the capitalist interests simply punishing the people of Venezuela for electing the wrong party.  Personally I think I have a quite marxist approach (w/o labeling myself as such). I'm bouncing between reform and revolution, I see both having its gains, purpose and timing. Currently, in western societies, I don't think violent revolution have much popular support, hence I'm not convinced that is the right type of rhetoric to use.  When it comes to my own choices. Well, I usually avoid companies I know are exceptionally worse than others and known for it, like Coca Cola, Dole etc. I'm of course well aware that my individual choice wont make a different, but I feel I have to live up to my own morals and be able to look myself in the mirror with pride. I have also so far avoided investing my savings in any stocks which have a higher yield/return than the current inflation since I do no want to be earning money from having money."

Parliamentary politics is no saving grace but I'd sure as hell rather see a vaguely left wing party in power than right wing fanatics like the Conservative party or UKIP.  I know a guy who is running locally for the Socialist Party, who I believe are Trotskyists/Leninists. They're really on the fringe though. Plus they seem to actually believe that a party based approach can achieve communism, which I have huge doubts about. Thus I feel more comfortable going to the Greens in the hope that as they build support the sorts of horizontal politics that they seem to, at least in part, support also grows. Even a majority Green Party (or Socialist Party) government would be something to fight. The failures of 1917 should not be forgotten, and not because it wasn't done ""properly"" but because the whole party-state approach is severely flawed.

Definitely yeah, avoiding brand names is a big thing both in terms of products themselves but also avoiding huge corporations whenever possible; a lot of this is easier in urban areas where local food is accessible, so you don't necessarily need to go to Walmart.  Obviously this is hard because goods like oil and electronics are pretty exclusively left to corporations.  If possible, I buy fair trade.  I don't eat much meat because I find that industry particularly appalling, so when I do it's from companies that have slightly more humane ways of treating animals. Personally I try not to put much money into things I think represent vanity.  I have very few clothes and nothing I own in terms of car or home decor or anything is particularly flashy; things must have a specific purpose for me.   Politics are difficult.  I always vote, I think that's important.  But I don't vote along party lines - some of my colleagues think voting democratic is the ""less of two evils,"" but they're just not that different to me.  So either I vote for larger independent candidates or, very frequently, I submit write-ins which I know is a ""useless effort,"" but makes me feel as though my vote is in.

The answers will be the same to how do communists deal with living in a capitalist society. There are many types of communists who support and/or are opposed to many things, some of which they avoid others of which they tolerate. As the atheist in the religious community will likely accept his or her holiday leave from work even if he or she doesn't celebrate the holiday, so most self-proclaimed communists interact with capital and market economies. Like the feminist, there may be a few who choose to live in small self-organised communities, and others who try to change the bigger society, but in either case most realise the tiny effect they have.   For my part, I am not opposed theoretically to corporations, only to their hierarchical organisation and current practices. I do avoid financially supporting some of the more outrageous examples, but so do many capitalists. I think it is probably more typical for communists to concern themselves with what extent if any they participate in the dominant culture of commodity fetishism.   As it happens, I don't vote. I don't have anything against elections, but the elections in which I qualify to participate are a waste of my time.

To combat class reductionism, we must maintain our dialectical materialist analysis without abusing it for reductionist purposes. Yes, as materialists, our analysis says that base economic relations lay the bedrock for superstructural ideology. White supremacy is a product of slavery and colonialism. Patriarchy is used to maintain the family unit so that the bourgeoisie can extract the surplus value of ""women's work"" (housework, raising children), for free. However, even though the material conditions that allow for these forms of oppression are base economic relations, this does not mean that these other axes are ""less important"" or that we shouldn't focus on them. The subjective realities of patriarchy, white supremacy, homophobia, etc. affect many lives on a daily basis and to ignore them is a mistake. And if we look at analysis the Black Panthers used, the black populace of the United States is an occupied, colonized nation. Fighting racism is fighting capitalism-imperialism. Ignoring these other axes of oppression is a distortion of Marxist analysis.  edit: I wanted to respond to your friend's assertion:   all other struggles will be solved if we deal with class struggle   When class struggle ends, the material foundation for other forms of oppression will be gone, but that does not mean that these axes will immediately disappear. As history has shown, the remnants of every epoch of history persist in the next. If we think the superstructural ideology will disappear, we are naive and guilty of economic determinism. The base and superstructure have a dialectical relationship. While the base is the primary aspect of the contradiction, this is not to say that the superstructure is completely reliant on the base. Under socialism, the dictatorship of the proletariat, these other forms of oppression must be suppressed by the state. We can't rely on them simply disappearing right away. Bourgeois superstructural ideology has to be intentionally destroyed.  edit 2: this and this are pretty good articles on the relationship of other forms of oppression to the proletarian struggle"

The idea is basically that when the amount of capital in the economy is low, economic growth can be very rapid if capital is flowing in. But once you are fully developed and producing with a ""full"" amount of capital, economic growth slows considerably. This is supposed to be due to capital wearing out faster than it pays out. I have lots of problems with it, but the basic idea that a poor country that is stuffed with capital will naturally grow quickly isn't bad.  And consider two things from this model. One, if western countries had just given these countries the capital or canceled the debt, etc, they would have grown just as quickly. If there had been a communist government that accumulated capital (and done well at it) it would done well. Any issues with that statement are political more than economic. Remember germany and Japan were also economic miracles after the war, largely because everything was destroyed in the war itself. And two, their rates of growth are definitely more limited now if they have enough capital and their development was relatively natural, as long as they were given the capital to develop. So many of the repressive and anti worker policies were unnecessary in the past and won't help the nation going forwards.

Fascism is the idea that one particular group (usually along national, ethnic or religious lines) is inherently better/stronger/smarter than other groups and therefore has the authority to oppress, exploit conquer, kill or destroy members of other groups. It is the idea that superior humans are allowed to kill, enslave or otherwise better themselves at the expense of inferior humans. It's as if it is some type of bizarre interpretation of natural selection, where the fittest should survive, and the weaker shouldn't have any rights. Nazi Germany maintained the capitalist mode of production, and was never socialist nor intended to be, and despite the name ""national socialism"" their economic policies actually moved further to the right.   Socialists typically retain the idea that all humans should be treated equally with dignity and respect, no matter what their ethnicity, sex, disability, orientation, etc. is.  Leninism is a method for achieving communism (a stateless, moneyless, democratic society). Leninist theory calls for the formation a vanguard party, which is the political organization and leadership created by the working class to educate and organize the working class using both activism and political theory. This leadership is called a ""dictatorship of the proletariat,"" and it seeks to unite and advance the proletarian cause through a cohesive, strong and unified leadership. The vanguard party does this through revolutionary activity such as recruiting, negotiating, funding and fighting on behalf of the working class, eventually overthrowing the capitalist class and giving the means of production and the land back to the people.   In theory eventually the vanguard party would no longer be needed, so it would dissolve itself. In practice socialism will always be threatened by imperialist sabotage, and some socialists argue that so long as capitalism exists, the one party state must remain to defend socialism against capitalist intervention.  Reactionaries and revisionists compare the USSR and Nazi Germany and say ""oh look, they both have big armies and a dictator, they must be the same."" But they have these systems for diametrically opposed reasons. The fascists had their army to oppress people, and the socialists had their army to free people from oppression. The USSR used the red army to defend itself from fascism, then to defend itself from USA (who had already drawn up plans for using atomic weapons against the USSR when they were still allied in 1945) and to arm other Leninist organizations around the world (including Cuban rebels, who wished to liberate the Cuban people from Batista, a brutal US backed dictator; and the ANC who wished to liberate the South African people from apartheid)."

After reading it you will be even more confused as to what exactly is fascism. I also suggest reading part 3 of The Origin of Totalitarianism, the author defines fascism clearer than Mussolini did (this does not mean that fascism is the same as totalitarianism). I would also suggest reading the State and Revolution by Lenin.  If we were to define fascism or the ideals they adhere to I would say that it is a spiritualist, anti-individualistic, anti-communist/materialist, Hegelian, anti-democratic, futurist ideology. What does that mean? They believe in a higher purpose, Italy was heavily Catholic, work (unlike communism) serves as the means to make it through this world to go into an afterlife as a ""clean"" well disciplined individual. Work and discipline are of the utmost importance as this isn't our only life we work to serve that higher power. The State is the embodiment of these ideals and all people within the state are to have the same convictions in this life.  The only thing about fascism, and I'm speaking about Mussolini's party, that could compare to Lenin is Il Duce liked the idea of the vanguard party Lenin had so he started the Avangaurdisti. If you would like to read about that aspect of Fascist Italy I suggest Into The War by Calvino.   I have pretty much barfed up everything I know on fascism, I think this will give you a good start though."

It is in this clas collaboration between state bureaucrats and industrial monopolists that what is formed is a decay of the typical capitalist society—it descends into totalitarianism, state violence, and so on. The state trades the media for the bludgeon, essentially, tearing down all façades of ""democracy,"" ""liberty,"" etc. so that the workingman is crushed by forces beyond ownership of the (mental) means of production (see: Marx, The German Ideology) such as the gun, the baton, and so on. The ""mental means of production"" are nonetheless held by the owners of the society at hand, and tend to use this as a means of indoctrinating those holding the baton in the street, i.e. by telling me they're doing their country and their leaders justice by defending people from whatever object is used to subject the populace into fear, i.e. rampant chauvinism and anti-semitism, islamophobia, and so on."

Since you've already read the communist manifesto, i recommend Wage, Labor, and Capital by Karl Marx, On Contradiction by Mao Zedong, Reform and Revolution by Rosa Luxemburg, and Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism by Vladimir Lenin. All of these can be found in the Marxist.org library.   The concept of the ""withering away of the state"" comes from Frederich Engels. The original quote was from Anti-Dühring:    The interference of the state power in social relations becomes superfluous in one sphere after another, and then ceases of itself. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things and the direction of the processes of production. The state is not “abolished,” it withers away.   There are a lot of different opinions on the state among communists, and I'm not 100% sure in my own beliefs to comment on it yet. Just thought I could point you in the right direction (which is: read Engels)  Not confident enough to answer the other two, also they're phrased strangely."

Also I don't think any communist supports the idea of one person being in complete charge but you have to keep in mind that the the ussr and other socialist nations weren't set up in that fashion where one person had full decree. There are councils within communist parties which vote on decisions and anyone is capable of joining the communist party and possibly becoming a council member if they are knowledgeable enough and voted in.  If ""the dictatorship of the proletariat"" perhaps gave you the wrong idea which honestly when I was still just getting my toes wet with communist concepts it threw me off, understand that the dictatorship of the proletariat is merely meaning the majority aka the proletariat will rule by decree(democraticly) over the bourgeoise and oppress them until international communism has been achieved and reactionary forces have been beaten.

If someone was trying to argue me on this point, as a matter of debate tactic, I wouldn't really wouldn't address the point because it's a large aside and is largely irrelevant. This type of question is largely changing the subject matter and it's intellectually dishonest. I would focus on questioning my opponent why this point is relevant. Even if they were right is that enough of a reason to stay in a capitalist system? In other words, they could be completely right and still not addressing the argument.   Now, to answer the question directly I would argue that capitalism actually destroys individuality. The capitalist mode of production drives to commodify everything, which means mass production of culture as well. In the search for profits, markets must constantly be expanded and cultural products are therefore subject to the same law of commodification. Furthermore, since the bourgeois control the mode of production all culture is only culture which promotes the bourgeois ideology.  But the largest destruction of individuality is the absolute monotony of the work week. Marx writes this better than I could, ""Owing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman."" Since most of our time is spent working the idea that Capitalism promotes individuality is laughable. The exact opposite process occurs through the exploitation of our labor as workers are constantly fighting against being nothing more than extension of machines. How much individuality can a slave have?"

(""From each according to ability, to each according to need"").  The socialist phase (the dictatorship of the proletariat) is predicted to have labour quantity as its basis. (""From each according to ability, to each according to contribution""). For example, there might be a labour voucher system being used. Another example, the U.S.S.R., which was considered to be in this phase, had it as a part of their constitution that everyone is to be paid according to the quantity and quality of their work.   and if there isn't money would we have movies or roller coasters or other unneeded delights we have in a capitalist world)    If the public finds those things to be useful, then those things may become a part of the economic plan.   and if so, don't you think everyone getting the same thing destroys individuality.

I'd like to address a few things before diving into Luxemburgism.   communist state   Most communists would say this is an oxymoron, since communism is stateless. Not a big deal, but in socialist circles its more correct to say ""socialist state"" or ""Marxist-Leninist state.""   totalitarianism   Most of the stuff about socialist states being undemocratic dictatorships is from propaganda. The number of deaths is often inflated (especially when discussing famines) and misinformed (For example, the number of executions from secret Soviet records is between 800,000 to 900,000. People may use this number as the number of people executed for political dissent, but this number is for all people who were tried with capital punishment, so murderers, rapists, etc.) Besides that, the USSR and Cuba were/are fairly democratic especially on a lower level. While high-level government was decided internally (non-democratically), low-level government was democratic. Cuba is actually very democratic, with all government positions being elected, with the exception of Raul Castro (but he said hes stepping down in 2018 and an election will be held then).  Were there fucked up things that happened under socialist states? Hell yeah. Oppression of homosexuals and ethnic minorities (i mainly mean jewish people in the USSR), dissenting leftist ideologies, famines, mass killings, and highly bureaucratic states, were common. How do communists justify this? We can't. We can only defend from lies, and we can work to make it better. And when this comes up, its important to remember what capitalism has done. (Spoiler alert: capitalism has killed hundreds of millions more people than communism ""has killed"").    Luxemburgism   I support it, mostly because I'm not a big fan of some main tenants of leninism (mostly with the vanguard party and democratic centralism).

Not the Last Word"", Source: Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 51, No. 2 (Mar. 1999), pp. 315–345, gives the following numbers: During 1921–53, the number of sentences was (political convictions): sentences, 4,060,306; death penalties, 799,473; camps and prisons, 2,634397; exile, 413,512; other, 215,942. In addition, during 1937–52 there were 14,269,753 non-political sentences, among them 34,228 death penalties, 2,066,637 sentences for 0–1 year, 4,362,973 for 2–5 years, 1,611,293 for 6–10 years, and 286,795 for more than 10 years.

Look how quickly, despite Lenin's good leadership, Stalin made the CCCP totalitarian, outlawed free speech, and sent people who disagreed with him to the gulag. And while Lenin was not ruthless or harsh, there was some amount of totalitarianism in his rule, probably because he needed to control the majority of people who weren't communist. The strength of the state under Lenin made it easier for Stalin to become a ruthless dictator, I think. I am certainly not blaming Lenin for the atrocities committed by Stalin, by the way. I admire Lenin, I think he was a man of the people, and I think he was a good leader. I have not read State and Revolution, perhaps when I have, my opinions will change. But as of now, I think that socialism and democracy can and should coexist, or regimes like Stalin's could emerge too easily."

Check out what Samir Amin has to say about it:   The concept of totalitarianism is itself a false concept, invented in the contemporary era for the purpose of confining social analysis and critique within the horizon of so-called liberal, democratic, and insurmountable (the ""end of history"") capitalism. The move here is to confine the choice to that between liberal capitalism or totalitarianism and by that means preclude both radicalizing the critique of capitalism and defining a choice between capitalism and socialism. Undoubtedly, the critique of the experiences of undemocratic really existing socialism is necessary if one wants to move forward in the critique of capitalism and the definition of the necessary practices to construct the socialist alternative. However, the sterile concept of totalitarianism is of no use in making this critique. Such a critique is based on other considerations that the propagandists of liberalism ignore in principle."

The capitalists wanted to subdue their foreign enemy ,which was the USSR, and their internal enemy which was Black Nationalists with their anti-colonial sentiments.  This was done for the obvious purpose of funding the Contras and pitting Iran and Iraq against each other. The other purpose was to create confusion in the new afrikan camp and dissolve conflict that would arise from within the United States.   The Drug War Today  Currently the Drug War still stands as a way to exert force in the Third World and destabilize it. The destabilization and production of illicit substances provides the United States and global capital with the perfect reason to intervene in other countries. It allows for the militarization of puppet governments in Mexico and Colombia with narcos.   Within the United States the Drug War is a way to further exploit its colonized people of New Afrika. With the emancipation of slaves also came other legal ways of exploiting and subjugating black people in the United States. This is just the latest incarnation of dividing tactics in this exploitative colonizer-colonized relationship. This causes confusion and in-fighting among people who would have caused turmoil domestically. The Drug War essentially allows for a new slavery where mostly POC are imprisoned for non-violent drug offenses and then their labor is exploited for super-profits. In other words, capitalism doing what capitalism does.   The Future of the Drug War (Legalization of Marijuana)  With many US states reconsidering the prohibition of marijuana we have to consider this soberly (see i snuck a pun in there) and consider the class character of this policy change. Much of the legalization camp comes from progressive and libertarian circles arguing against the costs of marijuana prohibition and the possible revenue of taxation. It is important to note that this is considered in the mainstream media in bourgeois terms.  The legalization of marijuana may be a small reform but as we have seen before the capitalist class will find a way to exploit the working class in whatever capacity it is able. Capitalism, colonialism, and imperialism are exploitative and the exploiters will not allow for that to change; the only change will be the rules of engagement.   Furthermore it is important to see that this is a result of the capitalist class seeing the financial benefit of this. This is not to say that Marxists should oppose legalization, it is just to say that we should be weary of the intentions."

Apart from the fact that the knowlegde of marxism is almost inexistent on the vast mayority of the venezuelan.  * The state has control over some important things, but this does not mean that the workers have the control. For example the oil enterprise PDVSA, is under completly control of the state but not the workers, all of them keep working under a completly capitalist mind set, and a completly capitalist system. *Yes, things improved under chavism, but today there are certain problems with the economy that affect everyone: It is not a pandemonium has the media loves to put it, but it is definitely worst than before.

communism101,31clhy,Heidegger,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:07:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand it. My problem with it is that it seems to ignore other struggles in society. My question was do these other struggles also create history?"
communism101,31clhy,jiminykrix,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:48:52 2015 UTC,"It depends on what is meant by 'history' and the extent to which these other struggles are transparent to class struggle. Marxism is an ideology. It is a system of specific concepts and terms connected to each other in specific ways. The struggle for queer liberation, to Marxists, is absolutely essential and just as important for the well-being of people as the class struggle. However, if we're talking about how 'history' is made in the sense of Marxian dialectics, then queer liberation--like everything else--can be seen through the lens of class struggle if we are concerning ourselves with 'history.'  What I  mean by this is, there are aspects of queer liberation (for example) that aren't very well illuminated by strategies for analysis focused on class struggle. Some aspects are, but not all. The theory of intersectionality shows us things about the experience and phenomenology of oppression that are not primarily a matter of pushing money around. Money in the hands of the bourgeoisie enables the oppression of LGBTQ people; it finances their oppression. Almost everything is related to money in one way or another because what people primarily spend their time doing is making ends meet economically in their political context, and Marxism is basically a critique of political-economy: it's focus is on money (really commodities) qua capital. One can't do geology with Marxism alone, although a Marxian analysis of geology as an institution is possible--it obviously wouldn't tell us everything there is to know about geology. Likewise with social sciences such as gender studies--a Marxian view is possible but there is more to it than that. So the concept of 'history' in Marxism is defined in relation to class struggle, so the struggle for queer liberation would make 'history' according to its relation to class struggle.   It is nonsense, from a Marxian perspective, to say that either class struggle or queer liberation is simply more important than the other. Marxism takes no stance on that. Marxian 'history' is not mutually exclusive with the common-usage concept of history (no quotes), and no Marxist would deny that struggles other than the class struggle can make that kind of history. 'History' in the Marxian sense is a technical term adapted from Hegel's extremely esoteric philosophy in which the concept of 'history' and 'the end of history' (a phrase that makes no sense at all if you try to apply it to the concept referred to by the common use of the word: history). And unless you spend all day theorizing about political-economy and long-term strategies for class struggle, there's no reason why Marxian 'history' would be more important to you that normal history. They're both necessary to understand the world around us."
communism101,316tey,Blackbelt54,12,Thu Apr 2 13:25:35 2015 UTC,"Ran out of room so I'm posting the rest here:  Another ethnic group that suffered mass expulsion was the Russaki, or Russian-Germans. The population transfer was triggered by Nazi Germany's violation of Molotov-Ribbentrop in 1941. A decree from the Supreme Soviet Presidium precipitated the removal of 1.2 million Russian-Germans; most were relocated in Siberia and parts of Central Asia. Obviously the driving force behind Soviet actions in this case was the fear of a so-called ""fifth column"" in the country. In 1943 and 1944 Karachays, a Turkic-speaking people of the North Caucasus region, were accused of collaborating with the occupying German army. In November 1943, 68,938 persons were transferred to Kazakhstan and Kirghizia. Were these charges baseless? Not in the least. In his excellent biography of the Man of Steel, New Zealand-born historian Ian Grey writes that along with other Russian Muslims, the Karachai displayed pro-German sympathies, at least to some degree. Alexander Dallin recounts in German Rule in Russia: 1941-1945: A Study of Occupation Policies; London; 1981; pages 244, 246, 258 that early in the Soviet-German war: ""...Revolts broke out among some of the Caucasian Mountaineers. Most widespread in the Muslim areas, particularly among the Chechens and Karachai, these rebellions prepared the ground for a change of regime....Faced with a concentrated German onslaught and a lack of support from the indigenous population, the Red Army retreated from Rostov to the Greater Caucasus Mountains without giving battle....In the Karachai region the bulk of the Muslim Mountaineers accorded the Germans a more genuine welcome than in most other occupied areas. The Germans...announced the formation of a Karachai voluntary squadron of horsemen to fight with the German army....During the entire occupation, there was no evidence of anti-German activity in the Karachai area"".   On December 27, 1943, NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria commenced the deportation of Kalmyks, a Buddhist people living in southern Russia near the Volga river basin. Around half deported to Siberia died before being allowed to return home in 1957. Their situation was analogous to the Karachays. Ephemerally under German occupation, they were accused of collaborated with the Nazis by the Soviet leadership. The decree was signed by Kalinin and reads as follows:    In the period of occupation of the territory of the Kalmyk ASSR by German- Fascist invaders, many Kalmyks betrayed their Motherland, joined military detachments organized by the Germans for fighting against the Red Army, handed over to the Germans honest Soviet citizens, seized and handed over to the Germans livestock evacuated from collective farms in the Rostov oblast and the Ukraine, and, after the expulsion of the invaders by the Red Army, organized bands and actively opposed organs of Soviet power in the restoration of the economy destroyed by the Germans, perpetrated bandit raids on collective farms and terrorized the surrounding population.   The German army often made the clichéd promise of independence to the ethnic groups it presided over. Sometimes the people were persuaded; other times they were not. Edvard Radzinsky writes in his 1996 Stalin that ""During their occupation of the Caucasus the Germans had promised independence to the Chechens, the Ingush, the Balkars, and the Kalmyks. Members of these ethnic groups did sometimes collaborate with the Germans. The same was true of the Crimean Tartars"".   In 1943 there were about 450,000 Chechens and Ingush in the Chechen Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, an artificial merger of the two groups established in 1936. Furr writes of ""massive collaboration"" with German forces and quotes a February 2000 Radio Svoboda interview with Chechen nationalists who brag of a ""pro-German"" anti-Soviet rebellion in February 1943, ""when the Nazi penetration towards the Caucasus was at its greatest"".   In March of 1944,  the deportation of 38,000 Balkars (Turkish people in the Northern Caucasus near Elbruz Mountain) began. Sent to Central Asia, between 20% and 40% of the Balkars transferred died from 1944 to 1956. Alexander Werth notes in Russia at War: 1941-1945 (1964) that ""the Muslim Balkars were more outspokenly pro-German than the mostly non-Muslim (Christian) Kabardinians.""  In May of 1944, the deportation of Crimean Tartars began. The forced removal began only one month after the German army withdrew from the Crimean Peninsula. Furr writes that in 1939 there were 218,000 Crimean Tartars and estimates that the proportional amount of military-aged men should be about 22,000, or 10% of the population. He says that by 1944, ""20,000 Crimean Tartars had joined Nazi Forces and were fighting against the Red Army"". Furr's source for the claim is researcher J. Otto Pohl, who is also cited in a 2002 article by Greta Lynn Uehling for International Committee for Crimea. Interestingly, Uehling asserts that Crimean Tartar participation in ""German self-defense battalions"" was not entirely voluntary, in that it was often ""secured at gunpoint"". Nevertheless, Uehling admits that there was a great deal of collaboration between Crimean Tartars and Nazi Forces.   I think I've covered the main deportations of the WWII era. As you can probably tell, in most cases the State had a good reason for its population transfers. The ethnic groups often contained many elements tied to foreign enemies like Germany and Japan. But I do want to make it clear that the USSR was collectively punishing these groups. As Furr says, it was not following the Enlightenment views of individual, as opposed to collective, punishment. Therefore, in some sense of the word, the deportations can be construed as ""barbaric"". Did the Party at this point in time really care much for the diverse groups of people in the Far East? I'm not sure. Again, WWII was going on in the background, so maybe some of us can excuse the excesses. I, for one, believe that this was a very dark time in Soviet history.        Sources:  Khruschev Lied - Grover Furr  The Voices of the Dead: Stalin's Great Terror in the 1930s - Hiroaki Kuromiya  The Crimean Tartars - Greta Lynn Uehling http://www.iccrimea.org/scholarly/krimtatars.html  Deportation of the Kalmyks (1943–1956): Stigmatized Ethnicity - Eliza Bair Guchinova   Stalin, Man of History - Ian Grey  Russia at War: 1941-1945 - Alexander Werth  Molotov Remembers - Felix Chuev  Probably the best book on the population transfers."

communism101,316tey,dkbuntovnik,7,Fri Jun 19 05:04:42 2015 UTC,"As is the case with many anti-Stalin claims, the originator of the ""forced deportation"" distortion is none other than Nikita Khruschev:   Comrades, let us reach for some other facts. The Soviet Union is justly considered as a model of a multinational state because we have in practice assured the equality and friendship of all nations which live in our great Fatherland. All the more monstrous are the acts whose initiator was Stalin...the mass deportations from their native places of whole nations...without any exception...not dictated by any military considerations...   If you know your Soviet history, you should also know that many of the things Khruschev says in his ""Secret Speech"" are pure bullshit. This allegation is no different. I don't reject the fact that there were mass deportations of certain ethnic groups, but contrary to Khruschev's supposition, these mass deportations were actually driven by military considerations. After all, WWII was going on in the background, particularly in the rear of the Red Army.  So you want non-bourgeois sources, huh? Keep in mind that many bourgeois historians have done good work on the USSR, not every Sovietologist is Robert Conquest or Richard Pipes. But I do have a copy of Furr's book, so I'll borrow from that a bit. The first large-scale deportation of a specific ethnic group came in 1937, when about 175,000 Koreans living on the Chinese border were forcefully relocated to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan because they were allegedly spying for the Japanese. Now, I know what you're thinking: it is simply improbable that almost 175,000 people would all be spying for a foreign enemy. Furr responds by saying that if ""only the guilty"" were punished, the nation as a whole would split, and its survival would be threatened. Young men were usually the demographic involved in conspiracies, and if only they were deported, you could probably make an educated guess what would happen to the group altogether. So instead, tactics of mass deportation were used to keep the groups intact. Were the accusations of espionage veracious?  Well, here's what Stalin said to the famous defector, Genrikh Samoilovich Lyushkov:   It is necessary to clean up the army and its rear in the most determined manner from hostile spy and pro-Japanese elements...the Far East is not Soviet, there the Japanese rule...Stalin resumed the conversation by saying it was necessary in cleansing the rear to terrorize the Korean district and the frontier so as to prevent any Japanese espionage work.   According to Lyushkov, Stalin ordered the deportations ""from the standpoint of counter-intelligence"". He sincerely believed that the Koreans in the Far East had spies for the Japanese in their midst. Hiroaki Kuromiya covered the topic extensively in his The Voices of the Dead: Stalin's Great Terror in the 1930s. He writes that the Soviet-Japanese border areas ""had been tense for some time"". One Soviet report dated December 25, 1934 describes two Chinese spies sent by the Japanese being detained on their side of the border. On December 28, a Soviet border guard was shot at by four unknown men from the ""Manchu"" side. And on the very next day, a Japanese plane invaded Soviet air territory near Grodekovsky (гродековский). In 1936, according to Japanese estimates, there were 203 border disputes with the Soviet Union. Still, despite all of this, Kuromiya contends that it isn't clear whether any of the ethnic Chinese and Koreans deported were actually spies. History suggests that Japan very well may have been extensively using espionage tactics, as they used them in both the Russo-Japanese War and the Siberian Civil War. Knowledge of the prevalence of black ops near the border areas combined with Stalin's conversation with Lyushkov should lead honest people to the conclusion that the mass deportations were not based on racism or hatred for Japanese culture, but fear."

Most notable in the achievements of leftist agitation and Communist sympathy are the formations of leftist parties and unions in the early 1900s--among many, the 1905 creation of the Industrial Workers of the World, and the 1910 formation of the National Confederation of Labor. I'm not a great labor historian of either the United States or Spain, to which each union is respective, but they did play large roles in their later years of development. While the IWW's radicalism grew rapidly in its first years, it died down greatly about a decade and a half after its creation, as its opposition to U.S. participation in WWI resulted in its decline, and the CNT reached its peak of social influence during the years of the Spanish Civil War, lasting from 1936 to 1939, and its being practically killed with the rise of fascism following the war's conclusion.  The gradual support of Communism continued through with the Russian Revolution, serving as a worldwide cry for the rally of leftism in the support of far-left ideology. Of course, people took to striking, the majority of which resulted in massive scabbing and outright battles between workers and scabs or police.

I suppose the point I'm trying to make is that a majority of crimes will be eliminated should we reach the point to provide for everyone's needs, underneath socialism.

While both the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks believed that a ""bourgeois democratic"" revolution must take place before a socialist revolution, the Mensheviks supported legal means (utilizing the Dumas, the provisional government, working with the non-socialist parties, etc.) to bring this about, while the Bolsheviks believed in transferring all power to the soviets (composed of workers, peasants, soldiers, and sailors) which would oppose the provisional government and, eventually, seize state power and carry the socialist revolution forward. Both sides vacillated in their willingness or lack thereof to work with non-radical parties, but the summary is mostly accurate.  For an archetype of the Mensheviks' orthodox Marxism, or more accurately, crude materialism, check out Plekhanov. He was the first Russian Marxist and was incredibly influential. Our Differences explains his idea about the (I don't think he used this term) iron laws of history that dictate upheaval and revolution. His writing is accessible and easier to comprehend."

The system of exploitation has to be abolished before we can have any serious discussion of ""rights"".

Sometimes, not always, you can get them to make a break with their consciousness, and sacrifice their social position for the oppressed. Marx, Lenin, Mao, were all petty-bourgeois, for example.

communism101,30ruzu,Klankin,9,Mon Mar 30 04:15:17 2015 UTC,"Stalins contributions were more practical than theoretical. If you need a blueprint for a planned economy or collectivization these were both things explored under Stalin. It really was the first modern attempt to bring a country to communism. Plus winning WW2. Stalin had less time for theory and more time trying to actually implement socialism.   Additionally Stalin contributed ""Socialism in One Country"". He wrote quite a lot on the nature of Social Democracy (and its failings). He also had an intense (and arguably correct) position on trade unions. He also showed the strength and dangers of utilizing nationalism as a force to protect the country and rally the people. Here are his works: https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/decades-index.htm  Mao contributed far more theoretically as well as practically. Some of his biggest works (and I dont necessarily mean entirely him, but under Mao or by Mao) were the theory of mass line (an organizational strategy for communist agitation), ""On Contradiction"" (https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm), instructional guides for waging effective guerrilla war (protracted peoples war), the basis for third worldism, New Democracy (how to incorporate other classes into the revolution), and possibly my favorite work ""Combat Liberalism"" (https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_03.htm)  Its important to note the Mao contributed quite a bit from a post-revolution perspective. Both in terms of how society should orient itself, as well as the mentalities that had to be fought even from within the communist party. Mao had seen the revisionist Khrushchev slander Stalin and derail the USSR, and he was determined to not have the same thing happen in China. Many of Maos contributions were on the inner workings of class politics, rather than the mechanisms to build communism (not that he shirked from this, but many of those lessons were learned in the USSR revolution)."
communism101,30ruzu,StormTheGates,7,Mon Mar 30 13:39:06 2015 UTC,What was Stalins position on trade unions?
communism101,30ruzu,any_excuse,7,Mon Mar 30 14:13:04 2015 UTC,"In essence he was against the militarization of the unions. Ill quote just a paragraph (or three) of a much larger argument:  ""Our disagreements are about questions of the means by which to strengthen labor discipline in the working class, the methods of approach to the mass of the workers who are being drawn into the work of reviving industry, the ways of transforming the present weak trade unions into powerful, genuinely industrial unions, capable of reviving our industry.  There are two methods: the method of coercion (the military method), and the method of persuasion (the trade-union method). The first method by no means precludes elements of persuasion, but these are subordinate to the requirements of the coercion method and are auxiliary to the latter. The second method, in turn, does not preclude elements of coercion, but these are subordinate to the requirements of the persuasion method and are auxiliary to the latter. It is just as impermissible to confuse these two methods as it is to confuse the army with the working class.  A group of Party workers headed by Trotsky, intoxicated by the successes achieved by military methods in the army, supposes that those methods can, and must, be adopted among the workers, in the trade unions, in order to achieve similar successes in strengthening the unions and in reviving industry. But this group forgets that the army and the working class are two different spheres, that a method that is suitable for the army may prove to be unsuitable, harmful, for the working class and its trade unions.""  The best place to see this position is in ""Our Disagreements""  https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1921/jan/05.htm"
communism101,30ruzu,StormTheGates,5,Mon Mar 30 14:42:01 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge Stalin's only notable contribution to theory is the concept of ""Socialism in one country""; which is a strategy for consolidating revolutionary gains in the face of capitalist imperialism.  Mao contributed a fair bit more. Just to give a quick rundown, because I'm not knowledgeable enough to go into any significant detail: the peasantry as a revolutionary class, third worldism (sort of an expansion on the existing idea of a labor aristocracy, and incorporating theories of imperialism), and the mass line ( essentially guidlines for agitation).  Stalin isn't typicaly grouped with Marx and Lenin (Notice M-L-M, not M-L-S), but is just seen moreso as a significant figure in socialist history."

If you measure it by how much time the public is given to focus on participating in politics versus meeting their basic needs, then the developed world would rank very low -- especially when one considers that turnout among the poor and disadvantaged tends to be the lowest in the industrialized West.  If you want a good, academic book on Cuba and the Cuban revolution, I would suggest ""That Infernal Little Cuban Republic"" by Lars Schoultz. In a nutshell, Cuba has historically been an exploited nation, with sugar its primary export for most of its existence. After kicking out the Spanish, the Cubans (like the rest of Latin America) came under the influence of the U.S., who actively intervened in Cuban affairs to protect the interest of U.S. corporations. When the U.S. was actively considering embracing out-and-out imperialism, Cuba was often pointed to as a place the U.S. should take control, be it as a state or territory.   Fidel Castro was not a Marxist originally. If you read his ""History Will Absolve Me"" manifesto, it's pretty typical nationalist liberal stuff. He only became a Marxist because he was surrounded by capable revolutionaries like Che Guevara who were true believers, and because it was in his interest to ally with the left-wing trade unions in the major cities (since his rebels were based in the mountains). When he came to power, he abandoned Guevara and his proposals to set up a communist society with moral incentives in favor of a more Soviet-friendly economic model that kept material incentives in place. Unfortunately for him, the USSR did little to build up the Cuban economy, and Cuba remained primarily an exporter of sugar, which the USSR bought at a marked up price.  Of course, the collapse of the USSR brought an end to this, and even though Cuba has invested a lot in social services (great doctors, great schools) due to the U.S. embargo, the country has suffered due to the forced isolation. The end result has been a slow turn toward instituting neoliberal reforms and gradually abandoning any vestiges of the Soviet economic approach."

Marx and Engels were heavily influenced by Hegel, a German philosopher. Hegel was important in contributing to dialectics. But Hegel was an idealist, where Marx was a materialist. This means that Hegel argued that changes in material conditions are a product of human thought and ideology, where Marx believed the opposite. Marx argued that material conditions, specifically economic relations, are the source of ideology.  So Marxist dialectics are specifically materialist dialectics. The dialectical method is essentially a way to analyze the world. We see everything as connected in some sort of way; you can't analyze a phenomenon in isolation without studying its relationship to surrounding phenomena. Another important concept is that everything contains internal contradictions, making it a ""unity of opposites"". For example, capitalism contains the contradiction between labor and capital. These inherent contradictions lead to the end of capitalism, and the birth of a higher stage of economic relations (socialism). We also say that every system has a primary contradiction which is the contradiction that is the most influential on the system, in the last instance. The primary contradiction can change over time.  Another key concept is that quantitative change leads to qualitative change. In the dialectic of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the bourgeoisie is the dominant aspect, i.e. the class in power. However, as capitalism advances, small quantitative changes slowly tip the scale in favor of the proletariat, until the qualitative change (revolution) occurs, which changes the economic base and thus makes the proletariat the ruling class. I hope this made some sense and if I butchered anything, I hope someone calls me out on it.  For further reading, check out this article, this article, and Mao's On Contradiction"

communism101,30ldvd,jiminykrix,2,Sat Mar 28 14:27:40 2015 UTC,"Bertell Ollman, a Marxist professor at NYU, writes very clearly and simply about dialectics. His book, Dance of the Dialectic: Steps in Marx's Method is really worth a read.   He's made the first chapter, ""The Meaning of Dialectics"" free on his website:  http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ollman/docs/dd_ch01.php"

communism101,30m8d1,jiminykrix,5,Sat Mar 28 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with /u/RedKras about this, but I want to address what I see as a premise in your question.  You say ""implement"" as though, at any given time, we have the option of choosing any number of political systems as if from a menu. That is not how we understand communism.  In England in the early 1500s, no one asked, ""What are some reasons we should implement capitalism?"" Capitalism emerged from feudalism because it made greater and greater sense over feudalism. Capitalism didn't happen because people were argued out of feudalism into capitalism--it was bound to happen because capitalism was a lot more productive than feudalism.  Marx identified various reasons why capitalism is making itself obsolete and counterproductive in the same way feudalism was shortly before it gave rise to capitalism. In the same way that capitalism evolved naturally out of feudalism, we see communism evolving naturally out of capitalism.  The Communist Manifesto really is a good place to start for this."

Since then, one of the most capitalist countries has sent men to the moon, gotten a machine on mars, is one of the most technologically advanced countries on earth, and a superpower to boot. How is capitalism becoming obselete?"
communism101,30m8d1,sinc6501,2,Mon Mar 30 20:36:36 2015 UTC,"Marx dreamed up communism early in the 20th century (please correct me if im wrong).   ""In the history of Western thought, certain elements of the idea of a society based on common ownership of property can be traced back to ancient times. Examples include the Spartacus slave revolt in Rome.[8] The 5th-century Mazdak movement in Persia (Iran) has been described as ""communistic"" . . .   Communist thought has also been traced back to the work of 16th-century English writer Thomas More. In his treatise Utopia (1516), More portrayed a society based on common ownership of property, whose rulers administered it through the application of reason. In the 17th century, communist thought surfaced again in England, where a Puritan religious group known as the ""Diggers"" advocated the abolition of private ownership of land.[11]""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism   How is capitalism becoming obselete?
