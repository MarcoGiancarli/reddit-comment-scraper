eliteexplorers,3e60ad,mixertoxer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:42:41 2015 UTC,Here's one person's thoughts from a few versions ago - it didn't work for me: I just plotted each and every jump manually... which sucked.
eliteexplorers,3e60ad,raluth,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:54:54 2015 UTC,"When I went to the core i did so at very high elevation and then dropped onto sag a* from above. This reduced the distance travelled in the regions with extreme star density. I plotted 100ly legs if I remember correctly, which would take 30-ish seconds to plot."
eliteexplorers,3e60ad,pluginmeerkat,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:06:23 2015 UTC,"I try to plot a coarse 900-950ly away, and quickly move from star to star, trying to plot at each, once lag starts. When one works, it'll be instant and the lag will stop."

Well, they didn't make it in a day, probably even not in a month, and I mean playing daily   I really love exploring in Space Engine... the graphical variety of systems, and the ability to make screenshots is amazing since you can so easily and precisiely move the camera. To me, its a more fun exploration experience, with zero grind.   There is ( almost ) no grind to explore, you can fit a ship for little money, and having a bigger ship will only increase slightly his exploration capacity.

eliteexplorers,3e3ag4,arheus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:21 2015 UTC,"This. You can explore in a stock Sidewinder, although you might want to go for class A FSD and class D everything else. Get the ADS as soon as you can, then the DSS. Once you have those, start on a slightly longer trip. There's a black hole in the Pleiades -- in the Maia system, I think. That will seem like a pretty long trip, until you get used to the real long-haul trips (farther than Sag A* etc).  The Hauler is an awesome, inexpensive little exploring ship. For exploring, I'd get that as soon as practical (get the ADS and DSS first), then I'd keep the Hauler until you can buy a properly-outfitted Asp."

The deal is that 99% of the time you will be in the void with no need for that stuff. I have only one heat sink and one AFM turned on to save power. My cargo hatch, shield and power distributor have been turned off since I left human occupied space and that also helps to reduce heat.

All I can recall is that it's not much.. this was before the update that doubled all the values however.

eliteexplorers,3dxtz7,Rekal_Sarosen,2,Mon Jul 20 17:03:38 2015 UTC,It should be relatively easy to test if you are near civilized space (which I am not). Travel a few 100 ly out so you get to solar systems undiscovered by you (doesn't have to be first discovery):  Scan a class M star with the DSS and then jump to another system with a class M star and disable the DSS in the module window and do another scan. Take note of the system names that you just scanned and then head back to nearest station and sell the data. Maybe also test scanning two High metal content planets in the same way just so you can compare and see if it is a flat percentage that is added or not with the DSS enabled.
eliteexplorers,3dxtz7,GretchemRPH,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know the exact value cause I'm not anywhere near a station, and I could be wrong because I'm putting this together from third party info, but if I understand correctly (really laying on the disclaimers thick, aren't I?) the discovery scanner's results in a basic flat rate for any object found (except asteroid fields). So the quality of the objects you spot well off in the distance don't actually give any benefit. It's only the quantity of the objects with the discovery scanner. It's not much, maybe 200 or 300 per object?  That does really add up though when you're just traveling at full speed."

And clearly in local systems we aren't talking black holes or anything.

After a day or two of doing some well paying smuggling missions, you'll be able to outfit a Hauler with an ADS and a A Rated FSD, which will get you started exploring.  Here's a solid starter build for a Hauler:  http://www.edshipyard.com/#/L=70V,,2-3I3m3I2C2C2C3c,4zM0KU2jw2UI  You can safely downgrade some of this stuff, especially the AFMU, to make it cheaper.

eliteexplorers,3dtdws,Kamika67,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:14:03 2015 UTC,"1) The DBE is a great little ship, but if you can afford an ASP go with that.  2) Your integrity will most likely hit 0% before you even reach SagA. It just means that you will take more hull and module damage if you fck something up.  3) I have never used weapons on my exploration ships. You only need them for the first 500 ly's or so. And when coming back with millions worth of data on board you won't want to engage in any fighting. Running is your best friend. And coming back in Solo mode if you fear to be interdicted by a player.  4) Shields on the other hand are more usefull than that little more jumprange you get if you go without them. If you are interdicted and have to run your shields are the only thing keeping your data safe.  5) I have not been back to civilized space since 1.3 hit so can't help you with PP stuff, but I would highly doubt that any NPC would wander further from inhabited areas than a few hundred light years."

I keep weapons on mine for combat in civilized space   4.i would keep them in case of rough docking or you get shot at in or out of civilized space  5.naw"
eliteexplorers,3dtdws,Minereon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"1) It's a good ship for exploration. Great range. The Asp is superior in that it has more internal slots for more gear choice. E.g. you can equip extra Autofield maintenance units and fuel tanks, and still carry a gigantic fuel scoop AND shields. The DB series has fewer internals, so you may have to lose out on something.  2) Ship integrity is lost only through supercruise travel. During exploration, the only times we supercruise is when we are travelling to an object within a system to scan it. E.g. that Earth-Like World 138,000ls away (yeah I had one last weekend). In theory, if you avoid extensive supercruise, you can prolong your ship integrity.  In quantitative terms though, loss of all ship integrity (i.e. 0% integrity) means your ship health is 30% less than its full value. If you had 100% hull at 0% integrity, you effectively have 70% hull. It's still a good amount of ship health.   3) To be pedantic, it's not ""safe""to go to the core without any weapons since you'll be defenceless. But, unless you're well armed and armored, you're not supposed to engage in battle. Your only option is to run if attacked or interdicted. Assuming you equipped the lightest shield and thrusters, for example, you're not really in the shape for a fight. You'll more likely end up dead. For this reason, there's no point in bringing weapons because you should not be using them.  4) Bring shields to protect yourself during escape. e.g. from an interdicting NPC, on your way out or on your way home. You can turn off shields (and distributor) once you're in deep space, to keep your ship running extra cool. I only turn them on if I drop into a planetary ring for photos.  5) I have never touched PP features so I can't comment here.  Happy exploring and safe travels, CMDR!"
eliteexplorers,3ds5p0,BOOmabad,3,Sat Jul 18 22:59:04 2015 UTC,"I'm in a DBX and I love it to death. If you can afford it when you return from the Coalsack, I'd say go for the Diamondback - it does an incredible job for what it costs. It has some solid Medium and Large hardpoints for combat, but I'll be honest - I haven't used mine in a fight, so I'm probably not one to talk about its merits on that front.  The Asp is an excellent all-around ship - it's designed for exploration, but there are many people who use it for combat as well. But, it also costs, what, three or four times more than a DBX?   So, I'd say start with a DBX, as it'll take you further than a Cobra will for exploration - then from there, you can decide whether you want to upgrade again to an Asp. If you decide to upgrade, you can sell your Diamondback and salvage what modules you can from it when you've got the cash lined up."

eliteexplorers,3ds5p0,Cupakov,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:50:52 2015 UTC,And how much would a fully fitted DBX cost?
eliteexplorers,3ds5p0,Anthem_of_the_Angels,2,Sun Jul 19 10:21:49 2015 UTC,"You could purchase and fit a perfectly functional DBX for under or around 4m credits total, I would wager - I'd be able to get a better estimate if I was anywhere near civilized space. You're looking at 1.5m for the hull if you buy it at Hamilton Gateway in Wolf 406 (20% off the normal price), plus another 1.5m for the Advanced Discovery Scanner, and 250k for the Detailed Surface Scanner. You'll want to sink some cash into your FSD and Fuel Scoop as well, so that'll be where most of your money will go - I've gotten by with a D4 fuel scoop. Everything else I've either upgraded to D-class, or removed outright to reduce weight.   That said, my fit is far from optimal, since I was strapped for cash when I bought my DBX. Hell, I have 31k credits to my name right now. I'm sure you could do better, but I've done quite well with my budget set-up."
eliteexplorers,3ds5p0,Cupakov,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm pretty poor myself now, sitting on 0.5 mil and a Exploration Cobra, worth around 3mil, so I'm afraid of buying the ship right now. AFAIK it uses the same part size as Cobra, so I need around 3.5 mil for FSD, Scoop and scanners only. I will be getting back to rare trading right now, then."
eliteexplorers,3ds5p0,Anthem_of_the_Angels,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:40:26 2015 UTC,"You can likely salvage a few parts off of the Cobra if they do indeed use the same module size. I managed to save my scanners when I upgraded off of the Adder, at least. Everything else had to be bought new. E:D really needs some kind of inventory system for purchased modules...  But yeah, you could PROBABLY do a budget fit for a DBX with ~3.5m; I think I'm only running on a C-grade FSD, and I can still go 500+ly without refuelling (the fuel tanks on the DBX are ridiculous), which is more than enough for my purposes. But a little extra cash never hurt. \o/"
eliteexplorers,3ds5p0,FireMoose,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:16:30 2015 UTC,You could always get the explorer and sell it when you have enough for an asp.  The improvements the explorer has over the cobra should more than cover the the 190 kcr you lose when selling back the DBE.  If you feel that the cobra's limitations are wearing on you I would recommend upgrading to the DBE.  Both ships can hold their own in combat.  The DBE has two medium hardpoints and one large.  The asp has two mediums and 4 smalls.

eliteexplorers,3ds5p0,Starfire013,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:02:56 2015 UTC,For exploration you'll want to add a fuel scoop in one of the teir 4 compartments.  Upgrade the FSD as high as you can.  Downgrade the power plant's teir to 3 and upgrade the rating to A or B if you can't afford A.  For very long voyages you will need an auto field maintanence unit in case you jump in too close to a star.  A heat sink launcher or two is cheap and potentially lifesaving.  Of course the advanced discovery scanner and detailed surface scanner are must haves for explorers.

I can record the system and jump distance during FSD warmup so that it doesn't cost me any time at all.  Since that's all any of the tracking apps seem to do (other than allow the user to make manual database entries), it makes more sense for me to keep my data in a spreadsheet than in one of these database apps, since it's a more flexible and powerful format and using the app doesn't actually save any time."

It makes up nearly 80% of what we breath but we don't use it in our chemical cycles. The ammonia-rich part has more to do with 5.5% of the 2270 atmospheres being ammonia. That translate to a partial pressure of just shy of 125 atmospheres worth of ammonia. Seems rich to me considering how chemically reactive (and dangerous to humans breathing it) ammonia is. The 'thin, sometimes seasonal atmosphere' bit is just the general description, but is it thin sometimes and non-existent the others or is it thin sometimes and 2270 atmospheres thick the others? Also, thin is a relative term so meh. /shrug  The carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere is the same deal. Earth's atmosphere has 0.04% carbon dioxide.

eliteexplorers,3do5be,FireMoose,5,Fri Jul 17 21:29:43 2015 UTC,"For strict exploring, Asp has slightly more range IIRC but I think the real reason to get an Asp would be that it's a more capable all-rounder for whenever you're not exploring (or when you're returning with precious data) - lots of cargo space, lots of utility slots, lots of weapon slots, solid shields, etc.   It can also carry more equipment without taking as much of a hit in jump range."
eliteexplorers,3do5be,D-Alembert,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:48:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Is it considered a better combat ship than the DBX?  The DBX has two medium hardpoints and a large, while the asp has four smalls and two mediums."
eliteexplorers,3do5be,D-Alembert,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know enough about combat. If my layman's guess is of any interest, I'd probably use the DBX - I'm guessing it probably turns faster, it's presumably cheaper to replace if destroyed, and while I don't know if it handles power management as well as the Asp, I think the hardpoints are more suited to my personal combat preferences (fewer but larger guns).  (I have both ships, but I've barely used the DBX, and never in combat - I'm not really a fighter and I already had my Asp set up nicely when the DBX was released)  EDIT: Checked the specs, it's the DBScout that turns faster, the Asp turns faster than the DBX. Ok, that makes it trickier..."
eliteexplorers,3do5be,EnigmaNL,2,Fri Jul 17 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"Yes. It has a longer jump range and you can put a much bigger fuel scoop on it, which is a must if you intend to go far. You can only put a 4A fuel scoop on the DBX, which fills your tank in 1m33s but you can put a 6A on the Asp which can do it in just 36s.  That might not seem like much but when you want to go to the core those seconds mean a lot.  If you want to keep a shield generator on the DBX you only have room for one AFMU, ideally you'd want to so they can fix each other if they get broken.  Also the Asp looks and sounds much better, but that's my just my opinion :)."

eliteexplorers,3dofh2,freedom4556,2,Fri Jul 17 23:05:59 2015 UTC,"Get a Hauler, fit the best FSD that you can and rating C or better of the best fuel scoop. Class D everything else, including the smallest shields that will work. Pick up an Advanced System Scanner and a Detailed Surface Scanner.  No weapons, armor plating, warrant scanners, etc -- they just reduce your range. You might go for a rating A power plant and thrusters -- this helps you run away from NPCs when you get back to ""civilized"" space, where everyone wants to kill you for the cargo you're not carrying."
eliteexplorers,3dofh2,FlyByPC,2,Sat Jul 18 00:51:42 2015 UTC,"My first exploration trip (2kLY to the Blinking Nebula) was in a Cobra.    D-rated internals, ADS, DSS, and the best-rated FSD and scoop you can reasonably afford.  Power plant should be the smallest A-grade that can power all of your modules.    I cleared enough on that expedition (with the Tsu CG) to pick up an Asp, which I am currently flying towards the core."
eliteexplorers,3dofh2,The42ndHitchHiker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:02:16 2015 UTC,"You can look around the forum for loadout suggestions.   You want to focus on max jump distance, so that means the biggest jump drive you can get and light weight pretty much everything else.  You want to get at least one heat sink (or two) and an AFM to prevent/repair any damage from overheating.  Lots of people drop weapons altogether. I would keep shields. Obviously you are going to need fuel scoops, I would get the best one of those if money is no problem.   Some people like the advanced scanner. I prefer using an intermediate scanner as it requires you to look for some planets and stars. To me this makes exploring more of an activity rather than a simple speed challenge of how many systems you can do as quickly as possible.   Don't be too intimidated. Exploring favors being prepared. It's very unlikely you won;t get shot, but you may run out of fuel because you were low and forgot to check whether the system you jumped to had a scoopable star. That sucks, and if you are a few thousand light years out, it's unlikely someone is going to come help you in time.   It's not the excited adrenalin rush of combat. if you like being methodical and enjoy sights of stars and planets, then exploring can be a lot of fun."
eliteexplorers,3dofh2,chrisfs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:13:30 2015 UTC,Wondering the actual use of heatsink launchers? You will have a finite amount to  use before they run out while an AFM will last longer?   Is there a tradeoff here between longer jump range or more protection using heat sinks?

eliteexplorers,3dlx0o,xmanofsteel69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:51:05 2015 UTC,It depends on how much time you take to sight see along the way. It also depends on whether you do detailed surface scans of everything you see or just rare planets.  I only scanned rare or interesting planets/stars and black holes and neutron stars.  The type of fuel scoop you bring is also important. Take the biggest one you can fit/afford because it will save you a lot of time.

eliteexplorers,3dn560,raluth,3,Fri Jul 17 17:20:30 2015 UTC,"You have 2 types of scanner.  Discovery scanner which comes in Basic, Intermediate and Advanced.  This finds objects in the system.  This is bound to a button and activated by holding the button while in supercruise.  It makes a loud sound and discovers everything in range.  Surface scanner, this scans the surface of an object and gives you the details about it.  You can buy an upgraded Detailed Surface Scanner for 250kcr which gives extra detail and means you get more cr when you sell your exploration data.  To activate, target an object and fly close enough to that object, it activates automatically and will pop up a message in the top right when it completes.    On the system map you will see any objects you ""discover"" and they will be unexplored until you detail scan them.  Do not bother detail scanning asteroid belts - they are worth nothing.  Everything else has a value, see this.  These are the prices for detailed scans.  If you are the first person to sell the detailed scan of an object you will get 50% more credits."
eliteexplorers,3dn560,reganheath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"For discovering, the Advanced Discovery Scanner will ping and identify every body in the system. That, of course, is the fastest way to discover planets.  Individual scanning of the planets does not really have a great way to speed it up. Best I can suggest is be selective on what you decide to scan. You can view the system map and get a pretty good idea on what a planet is, and if you check the habitable zone of your star (of which good estimates can be found on these tables) you will have a good idea where terraformable worlds can be found. Terraformable worlds are great money, fairly common, and typically close to the primary star."

On previous trips, I took so long on the way out that I got homesick at about 20,000 Ly and bolted home.

The planets are all rocky ice or icy worlds so no one is getting rich scanning here, but it's just sort of a planet hunting tutorial in the form of a system.  Noting that having found 9 planets they are all in a nice regular row on the system map, supposedly if there are any gaps that means there's something missing that you haven't found.  Anything beyond the 9?  No idea."
eliteexplorers,3dkr8t,chrisfs,2,Fri Jul 17 02:00:40 2015 UTC,"Well, first check the numbers, if you have planets 1-8 and then #10, you know you haven't found #9 yet.   Here's a trick to finding how many planets there are in a system. Go to the system map.  Click on the star (works best with single star systems, if multiple click on top star), then press the 'd' key to move to the right. If there is empty space, then that's where planets would be.    That will give you a rough idea of how many planets are left.  With systems with more than one star, there needs to be space for the star with the most planets, so there may be dead space,  Go to a system where you know there are no planets and try it out and you'll see the 'd' key stops working very quickly.   'd' is the default key mapping for the 'keyboard and mouse' mapping. it might be different if you chose something else. check the options if it's totally not working,"

The best cheap exploration ship is probably the Hauler. If you have the extra credits you can add a Shield Generator or Auto Field Maintenance Unit as well.  http://coriolis.io/outfit/hauler/02C2D2A1D1D1D2C----312f2i.AwRj4ig=.IwBj4ig=

eliteexplorers,3d9y86,sturk,2,Tue Jul 14 21:11:13 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of about a quarter of the way into doing that now, though admittedly I'm going through an internal debate as to whether I want to finish or not. Here's my negatives:    As mentioned, it takes a LONG time. I've been taking it easy for a couple of months and I've still got a long way to go. There's a whole lot of nothing out here. Sure, you'll find the occasional interesting planet, system or nebula, but after a while they start to blend together. You're missing out on everything else: trading, fighting, Power Play, grouping up, all that is impossible when you're over 25,000 LY from inhabited space. Just once in a while I'd like to see a different cockpit already, goddammit. I love my Asp but I'm getting kind of tired of looking at it. This was the worst of all for me: it's been done. I found three people during a cursory search on the ED forums that have done it in less time and with a longer route. Admittedly if I had the kind of free time others seem to have I'd be done already too but to know you're not doing anything groundbreaking anymore is very disheartening.   If after all that you're still interested in going (and you'd better be REALLY interested in going) here are a few tips you absolutely need to remember during a trip this long.   Don't EVER come out of hyperspace without your throttle at zero. I've avoided at least ten hairy situations with binary or trinary stars by doing this. To go along with this ALWAYS have your hands on the controls when you come out of hyperspace. It's going to be incredibly easy to fall into complacency after the 200th jump but all it takes is one wrong move and you're on fire. Just the other day I jumped between a couple of stars and if I hadn't been paying attention would have had some serious trouble instead of a couple of percent damage to a few modules. When you're going through a patch of systems with unscoopable stars, don't let your fuel tank get more than half empty before checking your route to see if you'll be able to fill up before running out. Once you get that far out there won't be anyone to help you. Feel free to wander around and find interesting things to look at. Take plenty of pictures. ALWAYS keep in mind though that the protection of your ship is paramount. Losing all those credits due to carelessness or not paying attention is going to hurt bad.   All this being said, it's a hell of an accomplishment and you'll be joining a very exclusive club, not to even mention an instant promotion to Elite in exploration and more credits than you know what to do with. If you do like I did and play in open (after getting at least 100 LY from the inhabited systems) maybe we'll bump into each other. Good luck out there!"
eliteexplorers,3d9y86,james-f77,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:07:44 2015 UTC,well been playing this game from launch and exploration is one of the thing what i haven't done much but so far i can say i like it the most :)

eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,3ringbout,3,Tue Jul 14 17:33:13 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit of a noob but will try to answer:  1) With a fuel scoop there's no need for a station. I'm currently 20,000ly away from the closest one. As far as I know, all the populated systems are kinda centralized. Once you are in deep space, there's no stations.  2) If you die before turning in data, it is lost.  3) With 400 billion systems, first discoveries are not rare. That is, unless, you are going to popular spots like SagA, Betelguese, and black holes near civilized space. On my current trip to SagA, I have not come across a discovered system for about 15,000ly. I've scanned about 1,800 systems and I think less than 100 were discovered already."
eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,GodOfPopTarts,2,Tue Jul 14 17:41:16 2015 UTC,Is civilized space the area that powerplay is zoned to(around sol)? I noticed that I didnt have to get very far from there before I stopped seeing stations. Is there no life anywhere in the galaxy but there?
eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,55555,2,Tue Jul 14 20:48:32 2015 UTC,There may be life elsewhere but all human life is in the relatively tiny bubble of Civilized space near Sol. There are areas of the galaxy 1000's of light years from Civilized space that it's not possible to enter without a permit. I guess FD have reserved these areas for something...
eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,Yclept_Cunctipotence,2,Wed Jul 15 07:40:12 2015 UTC,Interesting...  Thanks!
eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,55555,2,Wed Jul 15 11:53:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, beyond a few hundred light years from Earth, there are no more stations. To get fuel,you use a fuel scoop and skim hydrogen from the atmosphere near stars while keeping far enough away so as not to overheat and damage your ship. Only some kinds of stars are 'scoopable'. OBAFGKM classes, also remembered as KGBFOAM.   You are either keeping a kinda close steady distance or you are diving and rising a lot.  Different classes of fuel scoop are more or less efficient (more fuel scooped per second which means less time spent heating up).   You only get credit if you make it back to a station and sell your data. If you die (due to running out of fuel, getting too close to a star and getting too much damage, or whatever)  If you go out far enough, you are guaranteed to discover a new star. The issue is getting out the several hundreds of light years first. For some people that's tough, for others it part of the fun. It can be parts of both."
eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,chrisfs,2,Tue Jul 14 18:27:19 2015 UTC,"Is the tough part of going out that far the ""boredom"" so to speak?"
eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,chrisfs,2,Tue Jul 14 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"It can take a good number of jumps to get out that far (several hours). If you aren't enjoying the scenery along the way, it gets repetitive and if you are, it will take somewhat longer. So yeah, that's an issue for some people."
eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,sjkeegs,2,Tue Jul 14 18:37:22 2015 UTC,The tough part may be more related to the repetitive nature of the process. Don't get lazy and forget to throttle down when jumping into a system.
eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,GretchemRPH,2,Tue Jul 14 19:05:33 2015 UTC,"Not to worried about repetitive things. I come from the Ever Quest era where I would stand in one spot for 10+ hours because our group found a good camp.  And I learned my lesson from my first jump... Ok, got some cool warping graphics, this is pretty neat. Oh, coming out now I think. WHOA, shoots you out right at the star, that's pretty cool. Um...it doesn't slow me down... Heat warning?? Ummmmmm I should slow down...  So amazing though."
eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,laz777,0,Tue Jul 14 20:12:24 2015 UTC,"ha, another Everquester who remembers the grind :) but yeah, what you find if you surf this subreddit and threads in the main one is that once you are out there, you are in pioneer mode, you can't dock anywhere to refuel or reload or repair, you need a scoop to get your own fuel, and those fancy self-repair things just in case.  Sorry for the technical terms, I'm just starting at this myself :)"

eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,sjkeegs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:01:19 2015 UTC,not if you are careful... the problem I find is that I get so blase about jumping that I will pop over to the fridge or put the kettle on quickly whilst my FSD is charging up. If you don't make it back to the chair fast enough to throttle down then bad things can happen! :)
eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,GretchemRPH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:24:16 2015 UTC,Is that why I keep running into the sun every time I jump? How the hell do I throttle down mid jump???

eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,GretchemRPH,2,Wed Jul 15 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"so beyond that edge of settled space, does no more stations mean also, no npc pirates and such?  Is that why people put up explorer ship configurations with either no shields or say to turn them off to save heat, that the only danger or harm is environmental?  (frying on a star, that sort of thing if you aren't careful?)  Also, part of no stations is no reloading, don't those heat sink launchers actually fire heatsinks as a kind of ammo?"
eliteexplorers,3d9z7y,chrisfs,4,Wed Jul 15 00:03:30 2015 UTC,"There are npc pirates a little way further out than stations, but not all that far out, so it's not long before you're on your own.  Shields don't protect against heat or any of the other things that kill explorers, and shields are heavy so they reduce your jump range, so many explorers ditch them entirely, but some explorers carry them anyway - not only to protect against hostiles when returning to inhabited space, but also after going so long without docking, you can lose the knack and accidentally collide with the station trying to dock.  Yes, heat sink launchers only have a few shots. So do field-repair auto maintenance units. So it's up to you to decide how and when to use those limited resources."

Just be sure to get an Advanced Discovery Scanner as soon as possible if you don't already have one, else you'll never see most of the bodies in the systems you visit. (Your recent upgrade from sidewinder to adder suggested to me that the ADS at $1.5M might require some saving up.

eliteexplorers,3d9vc9,D-Alembert,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:10:11 2015 UTC,"If you avoid well-trod areas (like the path to coalsack or other nebulae, or moving horizontally along the map, etc) then you'll start seeing unvisited objects within visited systems after ~300Ly from Sol, and then entirely-unvisited systems after ~400Ly, and once you're beyond ~500Ly, unvisited systems will start outnumbering visited ones.   After much searching, last week I found an unvisited system containing an Earthlike world just 436Ly from Sol - about 8 jumps from Jaques Station! :)"
eliteexplorers,3d9vc9,55555,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:16:59 2015 UTC,Thanks. I was a little baffled that players had hit so many systems on the way to coalsack. Elite explorers are an obsessive group I think.
eliteexplorers,3d9vc9,D-Alembert,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:40:57 2015 UTC,"Yup :) There are also hundreds of thousands of players, so traffic around the populated systems is much higher than the matchmaking system leads us to imagine."
eliteexplorers,3d9vc9,55555,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:45:05 2015 UTC,Yeah what's the deal with the matchmaking thing? So there can only ever be 12 people i can contact? I read something about the number 12. I don't really understand though. No giant space battles right?
eliteexplorers,3d9vc9,D-Alembert,2,Thu Jul 16 20:49:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the upper limit on ships is but I suspect it's a variable that FDev can change at will - something they adjust to ensure performance doesn't suffer too much on client machines rather than being a limit of the system or game engine.   The matchmaker tries to match you with ships that have low ping between each other, which filters out most of the ships in a system (and means you're more likely to see players who are geographically nearby) but this avoids the frustrations of really bad lag in a realtime battle. and creates a kind of more persistent world where other CMDRs are more permanent residents - if you're on a particular guy's trade route, you'll probably meet him, rather than only meeting people plucked randomly from the global userbase and so you'd never see the same person twice. It's pretty clever, and now that I think about it, I like the status quo balance of other players being common enough that you don't feel entirely alone, but rare enough that you pay attention to them when you see them. I don't think I'd like it as much if it was normal for every system to have a dozen other CMDR's buzzing around everywhere all the time, or never seeing the same CMDR twice."

Open the galactic map, select View->Map (not Realistic) and Show by color Star Class. Then you can uncheck all star types except Non sequence stars. Then the galatic map will only display non sequence stars (neutron stars and black holes). Navigate the map down to around -1000 below the galaxy. If you then move around a bit (a few thousand LY to either side or back and forward) you should eventually see neutron stars."

eliteexplorers,3d921k,Skyflyer,2,Tue Jul 14 14:14:48 2015 UTC,It is easier near the core. That is where you get the best density at least.  I found my at least when I navigated to -1000. You also have to zoom in and out when you navigate. Zoom out to be able to move long distances fast and then zoom in to check if there are neutron stars in the area you have moved the view to.

eliteexplorers,3d7rh6,marcallanteart,11,Tue Jul 14 04:22:11 2015 UTC,"If you enjoy the hunt, feel free to stick with the intermediate scanner.  Exploring is about doing what you enjoy.  However, you may find that spending a long time in each system eventually starts wearing on you.  The advanced discovery scanner is good for not just seeing that there is something in the distance but getting a better idea of what it is.  As you start skipping ice and rock planets due to their low value, you may be interested in getting the ADS so you don't miss any water worlds or earth-likes.  I would recommend sticking to what you enjoy and getting the ADS when you want to speed things up."

eliteexplorers,3d7rh6,EnigmaNL,2,Tue Jul 14 14:10:57 2015 UTC,"You'll find lots of people who say you absolutely need an advanced scanner. They are usually about scanning a system as quickly as possible and finding everything immediately. Personally, I like the intermediate scanner more because you have to search for things. I know for a fact I have missed stuff, but that's fine. It's part of the exploration for me. Sometimes I spend longer on a system and sometimes I fly through it.  What I would like are scanners that are between the intermediate and advanced (say 2000 or 5000) rather than a big jump from 1000 to 'everything'"
eliteexplorers,3d7rh6,chrisfs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:33:20 2015 UTC,"I had fun hunting for planets, but a couple of systems were really frustrating.  I've recently upgraded from intermediate to advanced: I've started my first long trip and ADS is saving me lots of time.  I guess it really is a matter of what do you enjoy the most."
eliteexplorers,3d7rh6,valfuindor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:33:42 2015 UTC,"I'm near the core with an intermediate and I suppose it's pretty fun to fly around and suddenly notice some dots which move faster than the others. As you approach them and then sound the horn you get ""9 new objects found"" it's pretty exciting. However this means you have a very very verrrry small chance of finding any black holes unless you jump right onto one. If you're planet hunting then it's probably alright but for black holes and the like you definitely want an advanced scanner"
eliteexplorers,3d7rh6,JordanMeBaby,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:48:11 2015 UTC,"Black holes count as stars, so you know of their existence immediately, just like every star. If it's hundreds of ls away from anything else, it will be tough, but I was in one system and found three black holes with a basic scanner because of their proximity to other stars. So it can happen."
eliteexplorers,3d7rh6,chrisfs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:37:56 2015 UTC,"That is true, black holes are stars so they show up on the System Map. However, you have no idea (1) where they are in the system and (2) how far away they are from the main star. You can usually guesstimate the latter by looking at the major axis of the black hole, but, in the end, you often have to get lucky to find one without the Advanced Scanner."
eliteexplorers,3d7rh6,Quo_Vadam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"It depends on personal preference. For myself, I'm there for the view, so I want to be able to find the planets easily so I can go and look at them (I'm not bothered about speed honking or anything like that, I'll often spend 15 minutes just flying round a system looking at things even if there's nothing 'valuable' in it). Hunting for planets visually is a purely mechanical exercise that (for me at least) got very tedious."

eliteexplorers,3d2zge,TragedyT,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:05:31 2015 UTC,Nice pics!  I'm hoping to hit there tonight myself - how did you find route plotting near the core?  Any tips?
eliteexplorers,3d2zge,TragedyT,2,Mon Jul 13 14:12:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah that gets tricky. I found if you select a destination (without routing yet) and then  zoom out until you can barely see the stars and then click current location, lather rinse and repeat for selected location several times, then click route on the destination it seems to go faster. Without this typical waits can be 30-45 mins to calculate a route!"
eliteexplorers,3d2zge,TragedyT,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:47:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, it was surprisingly quick and easy for me - seems much much quicker than last time, where I had to turn back at 22,000 Ly due to the slowness.  Admittedly, this time I went 1000 Ly above the core, which I hear helps.  But apart from the last 800 Ly to Sagittarius A, which I had to wait several mins to run through the nav computer, I was able to plot each 1000 Ly trip in seconds.  Then I nearly exploded my ship while taking vanity shots of the black hole, but that's another story..."
eliteexplorers,3d2zge,TragedyT,2,Tue Jul 14 07:57:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah my route was straight through the galactic core. My first stop was Cygni X-1 which is around 10k ly from civilization, then I flew to the bottom of the galaxy and went through 15k ly of neutron rich star fields, and finally laddered my way to the Sagittarius A* through the densest part of the galactic core. Hopefully I'll make elite after selling all this data!"

eliteexplorers,3d3iky,Deprise,3,Mon Jul 13 05:55:41 2015 UTC,"To one Explorer to another, there are quite a few tips I'd be happy to give. I've been doing a journey to hit several Nebula and I've learned a lot.  Things to do, I would say to always keep your throttle down after you jump. When you're in the transition phase before dropping into a new system (especially if you have a flightstick and throttle), please slow down. You have no idea what you're going to encounter. You might just find a simple star or you might find a Trinary System with three stars giving your little ship a very uncomfortable and unwelcomed hug. If playing with a game controller, keep your throttle down button ready.   You could honestly choose to scan everything but you should know what is worth scanning and what is not (if you're in it for the money). Obviously, Earth-Like planets are worth it but so are Terraformable planets, even if they're high metal content planets. Belts give little to no credits, so I tend to avoid those. I tend to scan High Metal Content, Water, Earth-Like, Ammonia, Stars, and Black Holes, to maximize my profits. Also, please do make sure to get the best scanners you can get. More details equals more profit.  For stars, there's a saying I've heard several times while traversing in the Black. Oh Be A Fine Girl Kiss Me. This is a saying that  helps remind Commanders which stars are scoopable. Any other star cannot be scooped and will damage your ship. Please have a good Fuel Scoop or else your journey will become a crawl.  Black Holes used to be far more dangerous then they are now but I would not recommend tempting those gluttons. They will drag your ass out of Supercruise and you could potentially damage your ship. Out there in the Black, you don't want your ship to suffer such things, especially out of civilized space. As long as you're going rather slow near by a Black Hole, you should be able to scan it. Once you hear that magical sound, slow the hell down and you'll be fine. You should also be wary of Neutron Stars. They are far worse but keep a calm mind and you should be able to get close enough to scan it without tempting that siren.  While exploring, have something on in the background. Podcasts, shows. music, Audio Drama, a Skype Call, ect. It really does help pass the time and who knows, might keep your head clear. Crazy things happen there. Oh, and what ever you do DO NOT tab out of your game when you jump. You might slam into a star and lose ALL your exploration Data. Learn from Space Commander Yahtzee the 3rd and slow down before tabbing out.  Finally, as for your destination, I'd say go to what draws you the most. The Galactic Core draws many people but the Nebula around us has captured my heart.  Whether it's the credits you're after, the sheer pleasure of discovering, or to have your name upon the very stars themselves, I wish you luck and hope you enjoy yourself out there.  Cheers, CMDR Zsigmond"
eliteexplorers,3d3iky,ShadowlordArk,3,Mon Jul 13 07:41:22 2015 UTC,"I may be a lowly Explorer tootling around in an Adder I'm still pulling up to spec, but I will heartily second a few points:  1) Throttle down during a jump. And don't look away when you're jumping into an unknown. As the man says you can get into a lot of trouble, very fast.  2) Elite is my podcast game. Being out in the stars, it's lovely to have some ""radio"" playing.   3) Don't worry about the grind. Just marvel at the prettiness you encounter. Fly about and make an eclipse happen. Or watch a sunrise. It's a stunning game. Enjoy that."
eliteexplorers,3d3iky,weemadando,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:21:30 2015 UTC,"Just to give my two cents on enjoyment in the game.  While i'm scanning planets, I thoroughly enjoy buzzing past the main star as fast as possible at scoop range. It just looks so neat, its worth the risk."
eliteexplorers,3d3iky,55555,2,Thu Jul 16 17:16:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This is exactly what I was looking for. I shall take these lessons you've learned to heart.   Also, may we always remember Space Commander Yahtzee, Hero of Space."

eliteexplorers,3d3iky,CmdrBaked,3,Tue Jul 14 00:11:23 2015 UTC,"I literally got back from my 30k round trip last night.  Bought me a shiny new ship :)  Here are my tips (from learning the hard, but clenchy way):  Always pay full concentration, this can be hard after a few hundred hours but don't the one time you do, you could be pulled out of Super Cruise and end up taking heat damage.  Heat sink launchers are like condoms. End of. Better to have them and not need them, than need them and not have them.  Never ever go below 25% fuel before scooping. Make no exceptions that last 25% is for emergencies!  As mentioned scoopables are noted in a few ways: Either /u/ShadowlordArk 's way >Oh Be A Fine Girl Kiss Me. I remember KGB FOAM instead as this is the one i got taught.  I think he has also covered everything else.  Probably the most important tip though: Unbind the Delete key. This is silent running and will fuck you if you need to CRTL+ALT+DELETE.  Dont risk it!  Fly Safe Cmdr, may you have alot of playlists to occupy thy mind.  o7"

Before you head way out there, do a practice run close to civilisation.   Oh and don't skimp out on fuel scoops like me. I got a 4C, and it isn't too bad, but wished I saved for an A lol."
eliteexplorers,3d1mau,Cosmic-RS,5,Sun Jul 12 19:56:23 2015 UTC,I visited that a couple of months ago. Not sure exactly what it was called (if anything) but there were a lot of O and A stars as well as a few black holes. Basically it's an open star cluster. Based on the size on the screenshot I'd say it's about 300 or so light years from you - towards the east if you took the direct route to Cat's Paw.
eliteexplorers,3d1mau,pluginmeerkat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:23:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, I can't really see anything that looks like it on the galaxy map though, but I'll keep looking :)"
eliteexplorers,3d1mau,pluginmeerkat,5,Sun Jul 12 20:26:32 2015 UTC,I usually use this trick to find things like that: Select one system after the other in your navigation menu. Wait until one of the systems is almost in the same direction as the object you're looking for (i.e. the circle marker is close to that group of stars.) If you then check the galaxy map you'll have an approximate direction from the system you're in via the selected target system and onwards. If you zoom out a bit (until most smaller stars disappear but the bigger ones remain) and move the map in said direction you have a reasonable chance of finding it.
eliteexplorers,3d1mau,JeremyR22,2,Sun Jul 12 20:29:15 2015 UTC,"I just used this method and found it! Bunch of O, A and B types, like you said. Thanks very much :)"

eliteexplorers,3d0tpt,FishbulbMN,3,Sun Jul 12 15:56:37 2015 UTC,Ship integrity is wear and tear on the ship. It happens over time. When the integrity falls to zero your hull will be at 70% of its original strength.
eliteexplorers,3d0tpt,sjkeegs,3,Sun Jul 12 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"As sjkeegs said it's simple wear and tear. Supercruise affects W&T the most, hyperjumps don't seem to affect it much. The net effect is that your hull strength will be lower even though it will still read as 100% in your cockpit. And don't worry, hull strength never goes down so much as to pose a danger to your ship - just avoid getting into a gunfight on your return trip."

You will be doing this a lot so the shorter the time you can make it, the better. Power Plant, fit a lower class (smaller) A rated plant. Shields, fit a lower class possibly A rated shield.   It's all about making it as light as possible to extend your jump range.    Also..   Advanced discovery scanner Detailed surface scanner   Don't add fuel tanks - someone on reddit did the calculations, the reduction in jump range means over a long distance you make more jumps, jumps take a fixed amount of time, as does refueling.  Add it all up and the extra fuel will only slow you down.  You would only need extra fuel if you planned to go to a very empty part of space without any scoopable stars.  You do not really need shields (except for the short trip through inhabited space on the way out, and more importantly on the way back).  You do not need weapons, you will run from everything.  You might want heatsinks - they can only be employed out of supercruise tho, but sometimes you are torn from supercruise by being too close to something, and then you need to get back to supercruise taking as little heat damage as possible, thus heatsinks.  They weigh something tho, so reduce jump range - don't take too many.  You might want auto field maintenance units.  They can repair engines etc if you take enough damage to reduce them to 0%.  They cannot repair hull or canopy, which was the only thing I really needed repairs on - so I am not certain I would take one if you're low on cash.  They weigh nothing so if you have the cash, take one."

Just go out and see for yourself really, once you leave the ""bubble"" of the main area if you go up or down the galactic plane by a 1000ly or so you will find plenty of unexplored systems, with 400 billion in the game the surface has hardly even been scratched yet at all. If you're outside of civilized space and running into lots of pre-discovered systems just go up or down or change track.   As for a ship depends what your budget is like, quick explorer setup is D class everything aside from an A class FSD, add the best fuel scoop you can fit, add a discovery scanner (preferably advanced) and a detailed surface scanner, a heat sink, an auto-field maintenance unit and you're pretty much set. You just want to make the ship the lightest you can really while still maintaining enough power to run all the modules. Maximize your jump range as you can but bigger jump range just means you can get to further apart starts and in less jumps that is all. Something you probably won't need to worry too much about if you're just starting out exploring."

eliteexplorers,3chcr8,IIFortranII,2,Tue Jul 7 23:01:23 2015 UTC,"There is no one way really, some people like to draw as close as necessary and just stop until scooping is complete, I personally prefer to continue orbiting at full speed so I can bug out quickly if overheating becomes an issue, although if you get your orbit correct you should be able to maintain the same heat while maximizing your scoop rate."

eliteexplorers,3chcr8,amkosh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:11:47 2015 UTC,"I like to skirt the star as well, but I think part of that is because I like to spend at least some time actively flying my ship :)  One thing to keep in mind though is the size and structure of the star you're scooping from. The structure will be the same for each star regardless of size. This structure is easiest to visualize as a giant onion, with the inner core obviously the star itself and three additional layers. The first layer is the point where you'll get forced out of frame shift. Second layer is where you'll get cooked and take damage. Third layer is where you can safely fuel scoop.  Where size comes into play, is how close that third layer is to the center of the star. You always arrive from hyperspace just outside of the third layer, regardless of how wide it is. This makes the larger stars--type O and B and the giants--more dangerous to scoop from. You arrive so far from the star that your frame-shift top speed can reach 20C before the proximity to the star starts to slow you back down. Going those speeds while scooping is more dangerous because you can cross from the third scoopable layer down into the second you're-going-to-burn layer without realizing it. The ship heat buildup will still appear gradual and the fuel scoop's rate will not top out at your maximum scoop rate any faster.   Suddenly you're in the second layer and the proximity to the star has killed your top speed, you realize your mistake and it feels like you're crawling by the time you try to pull your ship out. The space you flew across in a blink at 20C, takes literally 60 times longer at 0.33C.  So whichever scooping technique you decide on, just be extra wary of large stars like Betelguese. M class stars are the smallest scoopable and the most forgiving, thus my favorite :) I've spaced out, ran face first into one, turned around and frame shifted right out without any additional damage without using a heat sink."
eliteexplorers,3chcr8,raluth,2,Thu Jul 9 14:31:42 2015 UTC,"I go into the star slowly, wait to I get to about 3/4 of max, or a max heat in the 70s.  I then pull out and use min throttle, wait 1-2 mins, and then fuel complete, and full throttle out of Mr Star.  Easy peesy, lemon squeezy."
eliteexplorers,3chcr8,D-Alembert,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:31:48 2015 UTC,"Using a lower-size, A-grade power plant can really help when scooping: A plants run significantly cooler. So if you have a choice of a 3C or a 2A (both around 10MW), choose the 2A. It is lighter too! Obviously the bigger and better the fuel scoop, the less you'll melt. In an Asp (the ultimate explorer) you can fit insanely large scoops of you have the credits (a 6A is about 28M CR; a bit smaller and cheaper is fine here, though!)"
eliteexplorers,3chcr8,55555,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:02:28 2015 UTC,"A bigger fuel scoop means you can get a good fuel intake from a safer distance :D  I like to scoop at about 75% of my scoops maximum rate - I find that this is a nice balance between scooping rapidly and keeping heat build-up low or slow, and gives some safety margin for... ""user error"" :D  Using an A-grade power plant also means you can get closer during scooping without heating up as much, because the A-grade produces less waste heat."

eliteexplorers,3chcr8,Aerovoid,2,Thu Jul 16 17:27:15 2015 UTC,"I search for undiscovered systems as close to the (human-occupied) bubble as I can find.   ~300LY from Sol you'll start finding undiscovered bodies in already-first-discovered systems. ~400LY from Sol you'll start finding entirely undiscovered systems, especially if you're not in the direction of any nebula or other well-trod direction (try to be above or below the bubble of occupied space, but not straight down or straight up) If you're in a well-trod area of space, you'll have to go out further. Past 500LY more systems than not will be undiscovered if you've avoided paths to common destinations (nebula etc)  Generally, I go out 400LY, then when I've hit a couple of undiscovered systems, I switch my course plotting from FASTEST to ECONOMICAL, which means I'll start jumping to every star along my path instead of the jumping the greatest distance I can every jump. This way I'll visit lots of systems and find more undiscovered ones.  I also look at the galaxy map in realistic mode (or use filtering by star class) and try to find hotter stars - the orange-yellow M-class stars are very common near the bubble, and you can refuel from them, but they're often too cold to contain much more than icy rocks. I look for hotter stars (yellow-white-blue) and prefer to visit those because they more often have more interesting systems."
eliteexplorers,3chcr8,facmanpob,2,Wed Jul 8 01:07:00 2015 UTC,The further out you go. The less likely you're going to fly into a scanned system.

Try veering off the direct path a bit as well.

After exploring for a while you should go for Shifty76's sidewidner build as that will be the best explorer ship for the sidewinders. :)"
eliteexplorers,3cd43q,Iamp_,2,Tue Jul 7 01:01:13 2015 UTC,"As mentioned by other people the main problem is that you can only fit a Basic discovery scanner with your budget.  The minimum tools for exploration are: Advanced Discovery Scanner, Detailed Surface Scanner and a Fuel Scoop. Those 3 together are something along the lines of 2 million.  The cheapest viable sidewinder in my opinion is this.  Costs around 2 million and has the 3 essentials. It is missing shields, which is a big downside, nothing is more frustrating than to be shot down by an NPC on the way back. Also refuel time is around 1 minute and jumprange is relatively bad.  So here is my alternative: an exploration Hauler. Price is about the same, but you gain: a shield generator, increased jumprange(+8 Ly) and reduced scoop time (down to 30 seconds for completely filled).  An exploration cobra has less jumprange, longer refuel times and costs more than 3 times that amount.  This sidewinder is within your budget, but you realy won't be happy with it. For exploration you NEED an advanced discovery scanner and that costs 1.5mio. There is absolutely NO way around it. At the beginning I explored with an intermediate one, which is somewhat bearable and you can find some extra planets via parallax, but this is very tedious and more often than not the found planet was some iceball which isn't worth too much.  Getting the 2 mio for the hauler is not as bad as it sounds, maybe you have a friend who can help you get it. If he has a big ship you could accompany him trading and get a relatively big trade dividend whenever he cashes in. Or if he is a more combat oriented player you could accompany him to bounty hunts in Resource Extraction Sites, all it takes for you to get a share of the bounty is 1 hit before the ship blods up. If your wingman is up for it you can hunt in the more dangerous RES where bountys of 100k+ are normal. For each 100k kill you get 50k. For 2mio you would need 40 kills which should take around 2 hours Cash in afterwards and you are set.  If you don't know anyone playing the game I am sure someone in the community could help you out. Personally I am pretty busy at the moment, but depending on your timezone I could possibly help you out."

Many people aim to scan 1,200 neutrons (first discoverer) and also honk the horn in every system, maybe scan the primary star, scoop fuel, and jump.  Plus, stop and detailed scan anything that looks like a water world, earth like etc.  See this for a list of detailed scan values"
eliteexplorers,3c9t57,reganheath,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:33:17 2015 UTC,I'll go for 1200 neutron stars. Still quite a lot : -)

eliteexplorers,3c9t57,Risley,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:45:11 2015 UTC,if you dont scan anything else you have to aim for about 3000 neutron stars.

eliteexplorers,3c3thx,Shaquintosh,3,Sat Jul 4 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"When you look at the system map you can guess if a planet is worth the time for scanning. Earthlikes have a special look, same ammonia. So firing the scanner and looking at the map is all you would have to do."
eliteexplorers,3c3thx,michscha,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:29:12 2015 UTC,Not that I know of. Maybe the guy just wanted to get somewhere fast and only scanned the earthlike because it can be easily distinguished from a terraform candidate. I also find that it can be difficult to tell if one is a candidate or not.
eliteexplorers,3c3thx,Toxiccameron,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"To me that seems like people know where to find the really valuable stuff and dont even bother with the rest   This is what many people do when exploring. Scanning anything else is a waste of time as they payout isn't high enough. Better to head to the next system to look for the next valuable find.  For finding terraforming candidates there is a fixed formula that will give you an idea of how far from the star to look.   I added missing star types from the original google docs sheet by kelpi11 to my own sheet and have found it to be pretty accurate.  I'm not sure how accurate the T Tauri data is as none of the TT's I found had terraforming candidates to cross-reference with.  If you want to add missing data just enter the solar radius and surface temp in the grey columns and it'll calculate out the rest. Distance is in AU and LS because while LS is useful when first jumping into a system, once you've moved to a planetary body you lose that distance reference. You can check a body's AU from the system map to see if it falls within the likely TC range."
eliteexplorers,3c4qxz,Yr_Heliwr,6,Sat Jul 4 19:44:29 2015 UTC,"As far as immersion is concerned I find the lack of science stations, other races, or other infrastructure in the black strange.  I like the idea.  Maybe not the factions we're used to, but nomadic groups perhaps that severed ties, science outposts, etc.  Couple some rares in there if you want, add some cross-vertical experience (exploring / trade).  Along with science outposts come failed expeditions.  Coming across a massive colonization failure, or hull of a big Federation science vessel gone missing could be cool.  Another thing to scan and sell.  Just some ideas, and none of them are new or do I claim them to be mine.  I have about as much say of what goes into this game and the next person.  :)"

eliteexplorers,3c4qxz,FourStringsOrMore,2,Sat Jul 4 21:17:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like the emptiness of the black.  A few hundred stations scattered around would be cool, but it probably wouldn't change how I explored much.  What I'm hoping for is more detail with scans and data collection from bodies.  I can't imagine extra stations would add much to the day-to-day of exploring (except that it would be nice to drop off data more regularly), but surface sample collection drones, more involved (higher paying) scanning, geographic surveys of earth-likes that required you to orbit, etc. would add a lot more to the immersion for me, and would actually change the act of exploring."
eliteexplorers,3c4qxz,Shaquintosh,2,Sun Jul 5 18:23:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see the need for remote stations but I love the idea of finding the remnants of an old exploration vehicle or even an entire ship that has succumbed to some tragedy like loss of life support or ran out of fuel or even some alien life.
