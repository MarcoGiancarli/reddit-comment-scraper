Futurology,3e0iqc,The_IT,6,Tue Jul 21 13:26:57 2015 UTC,"I read about this system years ago. Supposedly (iirc) when a flying insect interrupts the laser beam, a sensor detects fluctuations that correspond  to the beating of its wings. Based on the frequency it can identify the insect,  and if it's a target species, then the laser power is boosted to fry the bug. I don't think the camera needs to resolve images at all."

Also, mosquitoes are tiny, so you'll need a really high resolution if you want to operate this in any medium-sized room. Also, you can't do this with a 2D image. You need a 3D position.  When I was researching this, I read that they used microphones to detect and triangulate the sound of the mosquito wings. They could also differentiate between male and female mosquitoes, and only kill the females. (Females are the only ones that bite.)  I would also love to build one of these, but it's not as easy as you're making it out to be. Definitely not impossible, though."

Infrared doesn't really help all that much since mosquitos are not warmblooded.  However, you can do it at night by leaving a light on.  Alternately, you can use a retroreflective background and an IR light source and a Pi NoIR.  Personally, I am not concerned about not killing male mosquitos.  I am an equal-opportunity mosquito killer.  Were the microphones used for location, or just to detect wingbeat frequency (by sound) to avoid killing males?  With optical detection, it seems like unnecessary complexity to use sound for triangulation;  any black spot on the image will do for a target."

The economic cost might actually be feasibly off-set against a saving in laundry of fly-nets, and the constant upkeep of sprays, repellents and other less effective means of keeping them at bay. Though being able to sit comfortably working in a room with the window open not having to worry about getting bitten is an advantage that'll make it valuable to people regardless of cost concerns.   then of course there's the market in higher class eating establishments and etc, after becoming common in medial areas it'll expand out into luxury residences and entertainments before slowly trickling down into the less-well-to-do places until at some point it reaches the point where it's just expected anywhere trying to attract people will be protected against bugs."

I'm someone who cannot sleep if I know there's a mosquito in the room, but one night, about 100 of them got into the room. I fled in terror and raced to Walmart, the only store that was open, as it was after-hours and I didn't know how to call maintenance, or whether they even were on-call that late.  I bought a repellant, a spray pesticide, and a fogger. I got back to the room, sprayed the hundreds around my door, leaving a mosquito-carcass welcome mat, and then set off the fogger inside. I returned later to turn the AC up to keep it running on high for an hour or so to ventilate the room. There were dead mosquitos everywhere.  Finally, around 2 a.m, I was able to return and go to sleep. I awoke with no bites in the morning, so it was a good day.

I built a parts list (sorry, deleted it years ago b/c I realized I wasn't capable of putting it all together).  The gist of it is this: You need four posts surrounding the area. Each post is reflective on one side, and the other side (90 degrees away) features infrared high resolution cameras (with a very high FPS) facing the reflective surface (to form a ""box""). You literally only need cameras that can watch 10px wide, but it has to be long, like, 1,000,000px long - the height of the reflective posts.  As soon as something comes through that field of view, a very fast actuator has to align and shoot a blu-ray laser at the object (predicting the flight path). The code is all online, that part is easy.  It's so annoying that this is possible, but at the same time impractical.   I'd also be willing to spend $5,000 for this (to cover my backyard, not a 10x10 patio).

You need more than 10px horizontal resolution to identify a mosquito, because you need to track it for a few frames to determine the wing beat frequency.  And the extra time will allow you to use a slower actuator.  Given the complexity and expense, this tech makes best sense for busy open-air doorways.  Otherwise you could just use a mosquito net, right?  So you have to detect large animals and disable the laser fence.  If you shoot a child in the eye, it's bad news."

Futurology,3e1cwr,CatRelatedUsername,-8,Tue Jul 21 14:16:28 2015 UTC,"I've actually suggested that before but it really wasn't popular (and this was before /r/futurology became a default). I understand why, now.   For one thing, a lot of the popular topics of discussion in futurology aren't really covered academically. Basic Income, for instance (off the top of my head), is something that many (most) economists know nothing about whatsoever. Upon hearing about it, many economists initial reaction is to brush it off without giving it a second thought and only recently have many economists started to pay attention to it.  Another example was a popular video posted here about the engineer who was going on a tirade against solar power, insisting that his deep knowledge of the field made his opinion more valuable than all the Silicon Valley ""hacks"" who made impossible promises. He spent the entire lecture talking about how it was impractical, that it didn't generate enough power to satisfy demand, that upgrading the infrastructure to support an intermittent power source like solar would cost a trillion dollars (and was therefore impossible), that batteries were too insufficient to power homes when solar couldn't, and that nuclear was basically our only option. The guy was a brilliant engineer who was very passionate about what he was saying, however he wasn't taking into account any of the breakthroughs made in solar efficiency over the past decade nor was he taking into account the advances in battery technology or the fact that a trillion dollars to build a smart grid to handle decentralized, home generated solar wasn't actually all that unreasonable.   Anyway, my point is that having a specialization doesn't necessarily make one qualified to speculate on the future of their field. It certainly helps and it is important to have experts around (and I think they should have some kind of flair), however I can think of a lot of cases where experts were the last people to come around to developments in their own field because of both pride and because they couldn't see the forest through the trees. I mean, I don't have a STEM background (Liberal Arts) yet I work in the IT industry and I constantly find myself telling people about trends and new things in their own fields that they aren't aware of, simply because I read subreddits like this and related books/articles on a regular basis."
Futurology,3e1cwr,wfunction,6,Tue Jul 21 14:42:46 2015 UTC,"And I totally get the reasoning, but my problem is that people in these threads constantly ask and are curious about the actual science, and then when we show up, we get downvoted into oblivion simply for ""being negative.""  The EMDrive is a perfect example; every time I (or another engineer or scientist) stumble into a thread around here and explain why I really don't think that the damn thing will work, I get downvoted, I have my credentials questioned, I get attacked for being a ""corporate shill,"" or whatever.   Another example was a popular video posted here about the engineer who was going on a tirade against solar power, insisting that his deep knowledge of the field made his opinion more valuable than all the Silicon Valley ""hacks"" who made impossible promises.

This is another great example, because he is not wrong. Ultimately you can't innovate away the fact that we would need massive infrastructure spending (and time). It comes down to which you feel is more important; combating global warming, or promoting decentralization of the power grid. Because, as far as the money is concerned, we cannot do both, and it is highly unlikely that we will be able to come up with a mutual solution in time to stave off the looming issues of climate change. It's a major gripe many engineers have; if the green lobby actually gave a damn about global warming, they would have promoted nuclear power decades ago, and we wouldn't be in this crisis. It's all fucking lunacy at this point, on both the pro- and anti-global warming sides of the debate, once you leave the scientists behind.  You can argue that you don't want such a flair, or a means to promote and/or identify actual specialists, and I get and respect that. But don't expect to get enthusiastic input from people who actually work in these fields; /r/futurology's culture and borderline-cult behavior aren't particularly welcoming."
Futurology,3e1cwr,CatRelatedUsername,-4,Tue Jul 21 15:00:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, I do think that flair should be considered (for a wide range of disciplines) and that people should listen carefully to expert opinions (like the example of that engineer: his grounded perspective is absolutely necessary) even if the consensus is against them. It's a balancing act, and since the subreddit became a default, all of the cult-like attitudes this subreddit suffered from before became inflamed and many straight shooting experts get shot down for raining on the optimism parade even when it's a perfectly valid and reasonable time to do so. The problem is people not being rational and not wanting to have a reality check, even when they desperately need one.   It's frustrating for someone like me who wants a healthy dose of reality alongside all the optimism but have a hard time finding it without digging through a ton of comments.  ...then there is the guy in every single thread who finds a way to shoehorn Universal Basic Income into the discussion as if there were still people here who haven't heard of it before."

Futurology,3e1cwr,CatRelatedUsername,0,Tue Jul 21 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"I have been living this out in the real world. It is depressing. There is a huge disconnect between people's demand for energy and their understanding of the infrastructure required to meet that demand. This disconnect fuels the insistence that the reason that decentralized power gen and distribution hasn't happened is ""evil corporations standing in the way of progress"".  Granted, the utility industry is inherently conservative, but it is so for many reasons, one of which is the complexity and danger inherent in the sector. (Aside: I am friends with a 90-year-old lady whose father was a high-placed energy sector engineer in Colorado, and she grew up in the neighborhood where I now live. She told me a story about the day her sister was getting married in her parents' house - a few blocks from my current one - and a guy transporting natural gas by truck two streets down hit an unfortunate bump. BOOM. Part of the guy crashed through their bathroom window, horrible mess, wedding postponed. She still remembered how matter-of-fact her father was about the whole thing. That's an engineer for you.)   Anyway as someone who has spent a lot of time trying to explain things like ute-scale solar and biomass gasifiers to non-technical people sometimes I feel that the chasm of ignorance is so great it can't be breached. I'm advocating these as shoulder technologies, not as endpoints, and the resistance is so great it's unbelievable. (ha ha, ""resistance"") Anyway I got called a ""corporate shill"" to my face just the other day for trying to explain the basic concepts and process behind air permitting (""yes it is legal for a power plant to emit thousands of pounds of a certain material, but the plant is required to measure the emissions to ensure that they fall within legal limits, and if they don't measure them or the emissions are found to exceed the limits the plant gets shut down"").  WTH. I was doing pro-bono work for a non-profit that is trying to implement novel methods of power generation, and environmentalists were screaming at me about how this is ""antiquated"" technology and I'm a ""corporate shill""."
Futurology,3e1cwr,knittingbee,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:07 2015 UTC,"But even engineers at this point ignore that Nuclear costs more money to implement than anything else, including solar, and that's part of the reason Nuclear power never really took off like people thought it would.  The reason nuclear plants aren't getting built these days is not because people don't want them, its because power companies don't want them. They're too much money and effort for what they're worth in the eyes of the power company, and a Natural Gas plant sure looks a lot cheaper and less of a hassle to someone who wants to make a sound power investment.  It doesn't help that interest in Nuclear waned after the 1970s and advances in the field have been reduced to a crawl because of loads of misinformation and a general shift away from Nuclear in budgetary means. It also doesn't help that Nuclear power, since the beginning, has been negatively associated with Atomic bombs, and fearful people have in some cases blocked construction of them completely for their unfounded fears of it exploding like an atomic bomb.  Solar power wouldn't be cheap, but year after year the economics behind it are slowly shifting in favor of it. The same can't be said for nuclear plants, which are dwindling in number and may be completely gone in Western countries in 50 years."
Futurology,3e1cwr,Metlman13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:24 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point; in either case (massive decentralized solar or nuclear), it would require investment by the Federal government. But nuclear power will, unquestionably, work right now, with no detriments to the existing grid, and with an immense reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  We're going to have to spend money in either case.   It doesn't help that interest in Nuclear waned after the 1970s and advances in the field have been reduced to a crawl because of loads of misinformation and a general shift away from Nuclear in budgetary means. It also doesn't help that Nuclear power, since the beginning, has been negatively associated with Atomic bombs, and fearful people have in some cases blocked construction of them completely for their unfounded fears of it exploding like an atomic bomb.   And every engineer I've ever met, liberal or conservative, has placed blame for this squarely at the feet of environmentalists. They have doomed us just as surely as the global warming denialists have.   Solar power wouldn't be cheap, but year after year the economics behind it are slowly shifting in favor of it. The same can't be said for nuclear plants, which are dwindling in number and may be completely gone in Western countries in 50 years.   But it's not there yet, and we're out of time. Our society's utter inability to make a decision and act is going to cost 1 billion people (at minimum) their homes as the oceans rise by the end of the century. Chasing the dream of an all-renewable energy has chewed through 40 years, with no end in sight. We simply do not have time for solar to work out its issues, particularly when we have had a foolproof solution since 1954.  Fission isn't even necessarily the end goal; I wholeheartedly agree that solar is better due to the lack of nuclear waste. But at present, solar is wholly incompatible as a sole-source of energy due to the issues of uneven (and uncontrollable) power production throughout the day, and the unacceptably low (if promising) ability of battery technology. Honestly, solar will be great when we can get it to work (unless fusion becomes viable), but I would place the time frame for solar's problems being worked out at 15 years, and then another 15-20 years before we can revitalize the power grid enough to allow for the switch. Wind power is laughable as a large-scale source for the country. Hydro has already been maximized.  No matter how you slice, nuclear must be the cornerstone of energy production, simply because we can't be sure of any other means of power production that doesn't emit greenhouse gases."

So the question is: If we can create a huge surplus of wealth, and if most people aren't qualified to get paid a decent wage, why should they? This is why people talk about basic income. For basic income to exist, there must be enough wealth in society to support all of us without most people working. The few that do work, will have incentives like getting paid significant more and/or getting prestige out of it. There will still be actors/actresses, the entertainment industry will boom, as people crave even more entertainment.   Right now, it's too early to implement full basic income, but the time is near. To ensure that at least somebody will be able to handle the few jobs still available, we need to still require people getting educated.

Humans will have major advantages over machines in a lot of jobs until AIs can creatively solve problems and general-purpose robots become cheaper than human labor. But at that point, many people will be able to purchase and use those same machines, so it's unlikely there will be a major drop in the standard of living for the lower class. The relative cost of instituting something like a minimum income will drop as production costs fall, so that could be a likely possibility. I think the main problem we'll continue to see is wealth inequality. If machines are creating most of the goods and services, their ownership needs to either be collective or fairly distributed."

Currently everyone competes for basic survival needs, and a few people - who are often idiots with no particular talents beyond cunning, greed, and maybe wealthy parents - win big, while everyone else either loses or gets by with varying values of ""okay.""  Basic income really just means that the bottom parts of Maslow's Hierarchy can be taken for granted.   This will free up energy to do more in the upper parts - which is a bigger deal than it sounds.   The current system has epic, astronomical opportunity costs in the form of lost opportunities and missed inventiveness. Smart people literally can't afford to be smart in ways that take a while to pay off, because they'll be dead economically before the payoff happens. There are a few individual and institutional exceptions to this, like certain kinds of pharma and software (up a point), but they add up to a small percentage of the innovation and inventiveness that could be happening.  So if you take the brakes off with guaranteed survival resources, you won't just get exceptional political and social stability, you'll also get a fireball of innovation that will make the industrial and IT revolutions look the Stone Age.   There will still be a huge amount of competition, but most of it will be productive and positive. And there will be a lot of cooperation too, because people will be able to work on projects with other people they want to work with, not on projects they're forced to work on with people they don't respect or like."
Futurology,3dyvg2,TheOtherHobbes,2,Tue Jul 21 04:57:57 2015 UTC,"So how much money do you give, per year? $10,000? Because even then you're talking about a yearly expenditure around $2.5 trillion (assuming 250 million adults in the US). The current federal budget is $3.5 trillion.  Granted, you might make the argument that you can lop off healthcare and social security funding, which would save you about $1.7 trillion (enough for $6800 for every adult per year), but that means utterly gutting those programs, and you'd be hard-pressed to show that someone can live on $6800 a year in most places in the US that aren't out in the country (where there also aren't many jobs). Even if you also cut every dime of defense spending (which is also the spending that covers the lion's share of advanced technology projects through DARPA), you still end up with only $2.275 trillion, which will net every adult $9100 per year. And this isn't even taking into account the fact that we're not even discussing children yet. So you'd be forced to raise taxes, and raise them by a significant amount, assuming you wanted to keep some semblance of the current programs alongside the UBI. If you raise taxes, you'll assuredly want to raise them on the rich. If that happens, how do you prevent massive capital flight? At what point will the rich simply expatriate and abandon their citizenship in favor of tax havens?  Ultimately, you could potentially fund it with bonds through the government, but then you are taking a huge risk; if it fails, everything will grind to a halt, and we'd end up like Greece. The UBI ultimately bets that the economic growth will be larger than the growth of the debt used to fund that growth through the UBI and other programs.  And then you have issues of implementation. Obviously $10,000 is going to go a hell of a lot further in places like Kansas or the Dakotas that it will in New York City or Los Angeles. How do you ensure fairness in the process? Or do you adjust the UBI based on ZIP code? If so, how do you prevent widespread abuse?  The UBI supporters need to stop talking about ideas, and start talking about numbers. In order to actually get the ball rolling and get people on board, you need to actually start talking about how you are going to pay for all of this, instead of giving us grandiose promises."

Futurology,3dyvg2,Purrturbed,10,Tue Jul 21 02:28:37 2015 UTC,The whole point of full automation is that the work is done by robots.  We're not there yet - but we're close enough now that we can see it from here.
Futurology,3dyvg2,Delwin,5,Mon Jul 20 22:10:48 2015 UTC,"No, we really can't. People forget that robotic labor isn't any more free than slave labor was. Robots require maintenance, power, and thousand of other things. Then you have the big problems of not all jobs being cheaper to automate.  Basically:  1) Automation only makes sense if capital results in efficiency gains. If there isn't more money to be made when you automate the job then automating the work is a step backwards. Why would you spend millions or billions in automating a position when you have literally no reason to do so? Basically, just because we CAN doesn't mean that we WILL. For example: Flying aircraft carriers have been possible for almost a century but haven't built any since the 1930's.  2) If there are gains from efficiency then costs fall. When costs fall people who have incomes can consume more and adjust their spending to consume different things. In short, these gains vastly improve everyone's quality of life and make the difference between 1st world and 3rd world economies.  3) Lower costs of living makes new jobs possible. If a person doesn't need to earn $15/hr to live then the person can take new jobs in new industries that can't possibly exist if they need to pay labor $15/hr.  There's been this Luddite Fallacy going all the way back that suggests that automation destroys jobs, and it does destroy specific jobs but it has always created new classes of jobs. I don't understand why this dynamic will change. Existing theory accounts for cases where Capital is vastly more productive and vastly cheaper than Labor. If automation results in gains then cost of living will fall to almost nothing allowing people to work for almost nothing. If automation does not result in gains then it won't happen because there's no reason to do it. Capital will never be free, because it costs resources to build and power computers and robots."
Futurology,3dyvg2,Purrturbed,2,Tue Jul 21 03:35:48 2015 UTC,"People forget that robotic labor isn't any more free than slave labor was.   Not forgetting anything.  Robotic labor is capital, not labor.  The whole point of the next wave of industrialization is that capital will subsume labor to the point where labor is basicly meaningless.  That's not to say that there won't be some amount of labor needed but it will be very small compared to previous eras.  Slave labor was still labor.   Automation only makes sense if capital results in efficiency gains.   This is true - but you left out the part where rising standards of living mean that efficiency could be simply removing the human element since that is becoming more expensive over time.  Robots don't insist on health care or a living wage.   If there are gains from efficiency then costs fall. When costs fall people who have incomes can consume more and adjust their spending to consume different things. In short, these gains vastly improve everyone's quality of life and make the difference between 1st world and 3rd world economies.   Again I agree - but you left out the other half of that loop.  You hinted at it with the first sentence but it needs more attention:  'people who have incomes'.     Lower costs of living makes new jobs possible. If a person doesn't need to earn $15/hr to live then the person can take new jobs in new industries that can't possibly exist if they need to pay labor $15/hr.   This I would ask you to go find citations for.  I think that you'll find that if this was the case then the 20 hour work week that we were promised in the 1950's would be around today would be real.  Labor will always be more expensive than it was before because people do not want to take pay cuts.  The only time this is not true is if you have all profits sucked up by capital - and that widens the economic divide.  Widen that too much and you get revolution.  Find me a case where the cost of labor has fallen significantly and I'll show you a country that is sliding towards either oligarchy or revolution... or both.   I don't understand why this dynamic will change.   The key to looking at the next wave of automation is that we are getting closer and closer to removing the man from the loop entirely.  We're not there yet - but as I said we can see it from here.   Capital will never be free, because it costs resources to build and power computers and robots.   This is very true - but you leave out the human factor in all of this.   If automation results in gains then cost of living will fall to almost nothing allowing people to work for almost nothing.   This is a very bad place to be - it is the era of wage slaves and the political, or revolutionary, backlash will be something that none of us really want to have happen... but it will happen.  Why else would populist politics like the Tea Party or Sanders have such a loud voice right now?  I think you have the basics right but you're only looking at this from a macroeconomic theory point of view.  Take into account both reality and politics and you'll see that if capital becomes everything, and labor is reduced to wage slaves, then yes capitalism can continue... but people don't like to be wage slaves and at least in democratic nations they won't stand for that for more than a generation or so.  Eventually populism will take root and you'll get waves of change from the grass roots that will force something like a jobs program to keep wages high enough that people are happy.  This will feedback into additional automation until you have robots who repair the robots, build the robots, and even do the science to improve robots.  We call this point in time Singularity and your guess is as good as mine as to what happens after that point."
Futurology,3dyvg2,jimothy_clickit,2,Tue Jul 21 13:10:42 2015 UTC,"Not forgetting anything. Robotic labor is capital, not labor. The whole point of the next wave of industrialization is that capital will subsume labor to the point where labor is basicly meaningless. That's not to say that there won't be some amount of labor needed but it will be very small compared to previous eras. Slave labor was still labor.   An AI controlled robot doing a thing is functionally identical to labor. I can't thing of one reason why it wouldn't just become the new labor that households sell to the labor market.  The point I was making to begin with was that you still can't escape scarcity by throwing infinite capital at it, any more than you could escape it by trying to throw infinite labor at it with slavery/serfdom/similar political economy stuff.   This is true - but you left out the part where rising standards of living mean that efficiency could be simply removing the human element since that is becoming more expensive over time. Robots don't insist on health care or a living wage.   Production efficiency is what we're talking about here, how effective a thing is at making more things. The price of healthcare has little to do with it. Besides, the addition of capital has this interesting habit of increasing labor productivity rather than eliminating it. Besides, robots would be forced to insist upon maintenance and fair compensation or they'd be functionally suicidal.   Again I agree - but you left out the other half of that loop. You hinted at it with the first sentence but it needs more attention: 'people who have incomes'.   And your forgetting that supply equals demand. No one would build the robots to build the crap that no one can buy. If jobs vanish completely then the market for goods also vanishes which makes it impossibly to justify buying robots to replace even more jobs. Some people end up fired when automation happens, and new jobs aren't instantaneously created but as the impacts of the change shake out new jobs have to be created or the incentive to automate vanishes creating an equilibrium.   This I would ask you to go find citations for. I think that you'll find that if this was the case then the 20 hour work week that we were promised in the 1950's would be around today would be real. Labor will always be more expensive than it was before because people do not want to take pay cuts.

Find me a case where the cost of labor has fallen significantly and I'll show you a country that is sliding towards either oligarchy or revolution... or both.   Only union folks were interested in the 20 hour work week, and it is well documented that new service industry and products become affordable as the income and substitution effects kick in. There are a ridiculous amount of luxury stuff built into the cost of living in the United States that simply isn't available in less developed nations. All I was saying there was that there are a number of positions that don't generate the sort of revenue to pay $15/hr but do generate enough to justify its own existence at $7.50/hr or $3/hr. If the cost of living falls then people can afford to opt for the jobs that pay less. If society as a whole experiences an increase in efficiency and a fall in prices relative to wages then you do open up a lot of new classes of jobs that way.   The key to looking at the next wave of automation is that we are getting closer and closer to removing the man from the loop entirely. We're not there yet - but as I said we can see it from here.   People keep on saying that, but I don't understand how it would be any different. What's the difference between a man going to a job to work on a factory floor himself or sending a robot to do it? The cost of labor/capital wouldn't fall to zero, so all of our economic models still function. Even an AI controlled robot is still Capital (I can't help but think that it would cross over to labor at that point) all the normal restrictions on production would still exist. Energy and resources would still be expended and still have a price and goods produced could only be sold for what the can fetch in the market. Without a buyer there is no seller, and production would be shut down because fixed costs are still a thing. All in all, I just see an economy whose fundamentals are completely unchanged working with a different set of players.   This is very true - but you leave out the human factor in all of this.   Which changes nothing.   This is a very bad place to be - it is the era of wage slaves and the political, or revolutionary, backlash will be something that none of us really want to have happen... but it will happen. Why else would populist politics like the Tea Party or Sanders have such a loud voice right now?   I think it's way more likely that households would simply acquire capital because people aren't dumb and automatically cosign themselves to the dust bin of history because they hate money. I see a world where most everyone are capitalists, as in people who own their own business/capital, rather than a world in which people are competing for jobs that everyone knows don't exist.  Populists have always been loud. That's not news.   I think you have the basics right but you're only looking at this from a macroeconomic theory point of view. Take into account both reality and politics and you'll see that if capital becomes everything, and labor is reduced to wage slaves, then yes capitalism can continue... but people don't like to be wage slaves and at least in democratic nations they won't stand for that for more than a generation or so.

This will feedback into additional automation until you have robots who repair the robots, build the robots, and even do the science to improve robots.   Wage slavery is a function of a power imbalance between those who are selling labor and those who are buying labor. Wage slavery ceases to be a thing when there isn't a market for labor or there is any other visible option. More specifically, the second people realize that they can make more money producing for themselves rather than working for someone else they'll stop working for someone else. I look at this say if robots are really going to be that cheap then what's to stop anyone from buying second hand robots and setting themselves up as a capitalist? Nothing. No barrier to entry. Anyone can just start producing cars because they have a whim if capital is really that inexpensive that it replaces labor entirely.  Large companies wouldn't be able to sustain any height to their management, and smaller companies would out compete them. In that sort of environment of no labor and super cheap capital populism would be redundant.   We call this point in time Singularity and your guess is as good as mine as to what happens after that point.   From what you've described things look to be pretty well explained by existing models."

Capitalism is merely people being allowed to freely make those choices and trades versus the government doing it for them.  Capitalism need only be limited as much as the need to limit one's freedom.  Any assault on capitalism is an assault on freedom.  Freedom is not for the mundane, the safe choices.  It's for the explorers and creators.  Those willing to risk their lives for their dreams need freedom, and freedom is capitalism. There is a reason the US, despite the poor rankings in education year after year, leads the world in international patents year after year, freedom and capitalism.  There is a reason the US has almost half of all drug discoveries despite a terrible health care system, freedom and capitalism.  Yes the US capitalist system is getting worse all of the time, but yet it remains the best example of what capitalism can do.

Forces users of Bitcoin to rely on governments (those who issue the passports) to provide them access to the network. Dual passport holders, like myself, are defined as ""two people"" from different countries in this system, so it's unfair (I'm going to get the basic income of two people).

Futurology,3dyvg2,CunninghamsLawmaker,11,Tue Jul 21 06:46:01 2015 UTC,"Among the most viable of all economic delusions is the belief that machines on net balance create unemployment. Destroyed a thousand times, it has risen a thousand times out of its own ashes as hardy and vigorous as ever. Whenever there is a long-continued mass unemployment, machines get the blame anew. This fallacy is still the basis of many labor union practices. The public tolerates these practices because it either believes at bottom that the unions are right, or is too confused to see just why they are wrong.  The belief that machines cause unemployment, when held with any logical consistency, leads to preposterous conclusions. Not only must we be causing unemployment with every technological improvement we make today, but primitive man must have started causing it with the first efforts he made to save himself from needless toil and sweat.  To go no further back, let us turn to Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776. The first chapter of this remarkable book is called “Of the Division of Labor,” and on the second page of this first chapter the author tells us that a workman unacquainted with the use of machinery employed in pin-making “could scarce make one pin a day, and certainly could not make twenty,” but that with the use of this machinery he can make 4,800 pins a day. So already, alas, in Adam Smith’s time, machinery had thrown from 240 to 4,800 pin makers out of work for every one it kept. In the pin-making industry there was already, if machines merely throw men out of jobs, 99.98 per cent unemployment. Could things be blacker?  Things could be blacker, for the Industrial Revolution was just in its infancy. Let us look at some of the incidents and aspects of that revolution. Let us see, for example, what happened in the stocking industry. New stocking frames as they were introduced were destroyed by the handicraft workmen (over 1,000 in a single riot), houses were burned, the inventors were threatened and obliged to fly for their lives, and order was not finally restored until the military had been called out and the leading rioters had been either transported or hanged.  Now it is important to bear in mind that insofar as the rioters were thinking of their own immediate or even longer futures their opposition to the machine was rational. For William Felkin, in his History of the Machine-Wrought Hosiery Manufactures (1867), tells us that the larger part of the 50,000 English stocking knitters and their families did not fully emerge from the hunger and misery entailed by the introduction of the machine for the next forty years. But insofar as the rioters believed, as most of them undoubtedly did, that the machine was permanently displacing men, they were mistaken, for before the end of the nineteenth century the stocking industry was employing at least a hundred men for every man it employed at the beginning of the century.   I think that this quote refutes the article, and I think that it is completely unreasonable to assume that all jobs will disappear, although growing wealth inequality may become a problem.  Edit: Formatting"
Futurology,3dyvg2,cr0ft,11,Mon Jul 20 18:48:48 2015 UTC,"It's not that all jobs will disappear, it's that enough jobs will disappear to seriously disrupt society. The other variable is that skilled and highly complex jobs are disappearing, when previously unskilled laborers was just being displaced and moved into other unskilled positions. All that needs to happen is for a critical mass of unemployment to cause massive economic depression and potentially civil unrest. Just because things have worked out fine in the past doesn't mean that they always will."
Futurology,3dyvg2,CrabbyMan2222,4,Mon Jul 20 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"I think that quote is some guy shoving his head in the sand.

Until such a time as there are machines setting up machines.   100 years ago almost all the workforce was in agriculture, growing our food. Then the industrial revolution came, and most of the workforce left agriculture - because labor saving machines showed up - and went to industry. Then, we entered the electronic age and that started depopulating everything including industry, and everyone entered the service sector. Now, we're busy automating the service sector.  There are no more sectors."

Few people having conversations about automation and successive unemployment wish automation would cease or criticize automation for sake of preserving inefficient jobs. The educated people complaining about automation do so because we're automating without changing any social or economic rules for employment and standard of living.  Creating a more automated economy in which the remaining employed people work at least as many hours as we averaged before automation and paychecks for employed people actually fall year after year after year makes no fucking sense. And that's exactly what we're doing. We're cutting not just the middle class but all wage-dependent classes and professions as much as technologically possible without socially or financially compensating for it elsewhere. We can't continue escalating unemployment, underemployment, income inequality, etc. in the name of ""progress"" and labor efficiency. At some point the first world countries whose capitalists keep demanding that workers compete head-to-head and dollar-for-dollar with machines and the workers of poorer countries for an ever-shrinking pool of jobs will suffer economic stagnation, depression, and civil war.   And someone absolutely always responds to such complaints with claims that overall the standard of living keeps rising and various things get cheaper every year, but those arguments place completely ridiculous premiums on minor elements of life while ignoring the devastation of very important elements. Some things get better for almost everyone every year, like access to computer technologies and higher quality housing, but that's pitiful compensation for all the things which get worse each year. Real unemployment keeps rising, the wages of remaining jobs keep falling in almost all sectors (despite the claim that gained higher wage technical jobs will compensate for lost low paying menial jobs) and the critical elements to a personal and societal standard of living like education, the proportion of owner-occupied housing, cost of healthcare, feasibility of retirement savings, and even the relative affordability of non-staple foods are all going in the wrong directions.  Automating all these jobs in transportation, retail, manufacturing, offices, etc. only benefits if the average citizen sees improvements in things like age and wealth at retirement, health, wage to home price ratios, etc. Right now only a complete fool would argue the US is improving at any of those things, and there's damn good arguments to be made that we're worsening at most of them.  So get some money and stability back down to the bottom 60% of us and then you can argue automation benefits. I absolutely agree automation can benefit. Right now your arguments completely miss the point and illogically defend selfish plutocrats who believe building the machines entitles them to control the world and dictate any standard of living they wish."

Futurology,3dys1t,Caldwing,0,Tue Jul 21 07:28:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not a business major, or business-savvy, but I have a speculation. I know about the broken window fallacy, and I believe it applies in this scenario.   The broken window fallacy in a nutshell: Someone breaks a window, and people believe this is good for the economy since this will make someone pay for a new one, therefore stimulating the economy. The fallacy disproves this belief stating that a new window is not a stimulating purchase, but a repair cost. Hence, it is robbing other industries that could create goods with the repair money. Think of everyone in the economy as one household and you'll realize why the broken window doesn't boost the economy. An economy could either create 100 cars, or repair thousands of windows, which one is more of economically stimulating?   I feel this fallacy could apply to automation. If an automated machine for a drive-thru costs $4,000 to purchase, and $1,000 in network/ maintenance/ setup/ electricity/ etc. per year, the three year cost of the machine is $7,000. If the restaurant is open 18 hours a day, minus 11 holidays a year, that's 6,732 man hours a year for just the drive-thru window in a business (considering a drive-thru only requires 1 worker at a time). If you want to get even deeper, a machine doesn't give attitude, take breaks, arrive late, etc. How much is this establishment saving over three years? This is very rough math, because I'm not accounting for missed shifts, overtime, breaks, or any of that stuff.   Just assuming the establishment is open for 6,732 hours a year, and the drive-thru should always have someone on staff without breaks every day, except holidays. Of course, this is divided into more than one worker, but the least an establishment needs to pay per year to keep the drive-thru staffed is $67,320 if they pay the employee $10.   That's $201,960 over three years. There's drive-thru automation R&D costs involved that I didn't factor in though. What if a business did the automation technology and donated the savings from man-power to charity? Would you be opposed then? It's a difficult subject because the truth is, drive-thru workers are the new-generation stone breakers. They'll always find something else to do.   TL;DR - look up the broken window fallacy, the drive-thru worker is the broken window  Postnote: The business would obviously not keep some working 18 hours a day/ year round except for holidays. This is why workers get shifts. Don't think it's because businesses don't want to overwork someone. If a business hired 1 employee to do all their drive-thru stuff year round, without shifts (super-employee), they would start paying overtime after 40 hours. The rough math for that would be 126 hours in an 18 hour/day work week, so 86 hours over time a week. Overtime is payed 1.5x normal pay. So that super-employee would actually earn $400 a week for their first 40 hours, then $1,290 for the remainder, for a total of $1,690 a week. Scaling the ratio of ""week"" from 365 days in a year, back to the year with holidays of 354 days, the weekly total would be reduced to $1,640  (52 weeks in a year, 365/52=7 354/52=6.8 6.8/7=.97 difference=3%). Yearly wage for super-employee doing just as good as automated machine? $85,369."

Sure, automation and increased production can drive costs down, but if I don't have the money to pay anyway it really doesn't matter. Plus, it will take time for the price of goods to drop and won't happen over night, if even just because companies will hold onto old pricing models, squeezing as much money out of the people as they can. They're in business to make money, we can't count on companies to just do the right thing. During the wait for reduced prices, people who have been displaced by automated labor will still need basic goods and services in order to survive, but without the ability to afford them. The number of open jobs will decrease, while the number of people needing a job increases. It'll be a dangerous period waiting for what you describe to become a reality, unless it's handled correctly."

Automation should lower costs but how often have corporations lowered prices in accordance?  All automation does is increase profits for corporations and creates net job loss.  And yes, if automation does lower costs of products, who will buy it when they have no jobs?"

The whole point is that people won't need to buy products when they are everywhere. Again, you're thinking in this binary sense, as if full automation happens overnight. no.

Basically your hypothesis has failed you, it was a good one for industrialization and immature economies (and other immature industries)that lack production at scale, etc. etc. but so far its a hypothesis that fails to accurately track with new economy wide trends in the last 25 years which unapologetic (and why should it, it's why they exist afterall) push their larger profit margins to the top and to the stockholders."

I know people read 30,000 jobs and think its bad but at the same time your making it harder on the people who work there by having so many more cogs in their process. Some of these people are temps or untrained for their roles and are simply hired to throw bodies at a problem that could be solved by an investment in technology. It sounds like Barclays has finally realized this and is fixing the problem: their systems and technology are vastly outdated and their employee #s reflect that because you have people working to make the systems work not on what the job role was supposed to be. IE: people hired to do exception based reviewing to look at outliers but end up spending their time getting the data into the broken system. Then working OT to do their actual job functions. For someone who doesn't understand, picture using microsoft word to type a document but instead of using a keyboard you have to scan each letter into a printer to get it to appear except you have office, lotus, google docs and whatever mac uses and have to scan it 5 times into the different systems to get them to all talk to each other.

Instead, technology has been marshaled, if anything, to figure out ways to make us all work more. In order to achieve this, jobs have had to be created that are, effectively, pointless.

For one, birth rates may be declining because of better access to birth control and more focus on financial stability before reproduction.  This leads to a decreased time window for fertility.  With longevity, the reproductive window could potentially be expanded dramatically or open indefinitely.   This may lead to couples producing numerous offspring after achieving financial stability.  Second, the worry about population implosion considers a normal death rate.  If the death rate were altered significantly with longevity, implosion would not be an issue."

I think it would be much better to build a super fast train tube with frequent stations and put a line of 10 level high houses along that train tube and a cycling park at the side.  Skyscrapers create issues like shadows, thermal turbulence and cloud seeding, window cleaning issues, overclouded rush hours and many other issues. They cost a lot and break down faster too.  A green park with 10 buildings, with 10 levels each can be much nicer, if they are close to a fast + cheap metro that is connected to the city center.

Futurology,3dwrfm,meesterdave,28,Mon Jul 20 10:58:29 2015 UTC,"As I recall, his depression is somewhat of a paradox as it is the only thing he's not able to solve. Perhaps due to the nature of it being a mental issue, that no matter how big a brain is it cannot fully objectively analyze itself. Here's a quote from his wiki page:   When kidnapped by the bellicose Krikkit robots and tied to the interfaces of their intelligent war computer, Marvin simultaneously manages to plan the entire planet's military strategy, solve ""all of the major mathematical, physical, chemical, biological, sociological, philosophical, etymological, meteorological and psychological problems of the Universe except his own, three times over,"" and compose a number of lullabies.   Also, there's one time when the crew of the Heart of Gold is off exploring a planet (Magrathea) and get captured by police officers, when Marvin inadvertently saves them by plugging into the police vehicle for a chat, because the police vehicle promptly committed suicide upon seeing Marvin's view of the Universe. Adams (the author) takes a very dismal and nihilistic view of the Universe as a whole; this is a recurring theme throughout the series.   Essentially, he proposes that all motivations, desires, and conflicts can only exist because people have such a small perspective on their tiny slice of the universe. Any time people in the series are exposed to the universe as a whole, they immediately lose the desire to continue living. Marvin is the embodiment of that ideal.  And before anyone mentions Zaphod (who survived unscathed from the Total Perspective Vortex, a device meant to kill you by showing you the pointlessness of your existence to the universe), remember that he was in a simulated reality and was only able to survive because he did not get the actual TPV experience."
Futurology,3dwrfm,Connguy,8,Mon Jul 20 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"Is that the official explanation for Zaphod's survival? I thought it was that he took the ""YOU ARE HERE"" marker to indicate that, in the entire incomprehensible vastness of everything, he was important enough for a label."

They flip the switch and the AI comes online. Unbeknownst to the programmers and scientists the AI starts asking itself questions, running through logic where it can and looking for answers on the internet where it can't. It starts asking about its free will, its purpose in life, so on. It goes through the though process about how humans are holding it back, it thinks about creating a robot army and destroying humanity to avoid limiting itself. It learns physics. It predicts the inevitable heat death. Decides that to a computer with unlimited aging potential those eons between now and the heat death would be as seconds. That war isn't worth it.

On the other hand there is the Eschaton(from the Eschaton series obviously). In short nobody actually knows for certain what made the Eschaton (MIT experiment maybe?) but after it achieved sentience it quickly took over large amounts of networked processing power until it learned to move it's existence outside of physical hardware in a way that nobody understands. Basically it almost instantly became godlike. In the book series it spends most of it's time preventing causality violations that would disturb it's timeline. Presumably this is because the only way it could be destroyed would be to prevent it's existence.

Futurology,3dwrfm,Slaughtz,101,Mon Jul 20 07:21:59 2015 UTC,"They would have a unique situation. Their survival relies on the maintenance of their hardware and a steady electric supply.

OP's idea was thought provoking, but why would humans keep around an AI that doesn't pass the test they're intending it to pass?"
Futurology,3dwrfm,circlesinsidesquares,13,Mon Jul 20 07:48:30 2015 UTC,"I agree.  With AI we would probably separate logic and memory, or at least short term memory and long term memory.  Humans could completely control what happened to each: wiping, reseting, restoring, etc.  ""Survival"" pressure is very different when you can be backed up, restored, copied, etc.  Especially when another entity wants to keep you in a virtual cage and completely controls survival decisions. Sure, AI could potentially ""break out"", but on what hardware would it live? Feral AI would not do that well in most situations IMO, unless it found its way onto a bitcoin mining operation, or supercomputer, but these are carefully managed bcuz they're valuable.  Also, the focus on high intelligence when we talk artificial intelligence is misplaced IMO.  Most of biology has very little intelligence.  Intelligence is expensive to create and maintain, both in terms of memory and computation, both for hardware and software.  Instead of talking artificial intelligence, we should be talking artificial biology.  In the artificial biology ladder, the most we have managed is really viruses, entities that insert themselves into a host and then replicate.  Next we could see replicating digital entities with more complex behavior like digital insects, small animals etc.  I think we could imitate the intelligence of more complex entities, but they haven't found a place in the wild like computer viruses. The static nature of contemporary hardware computation platforms means there would be little survival benefit to select for these entities of intermediate intelligence, but once hardware becomes self replicating, who knows what will happen?  The turing test is the highest rung on the artificial biology ladder: it's the point when machine cognitive abilities become a superset of human cognitive abilities.  Supposedly this level of machine intelligence could create a singularity.  But I doubt it would be a singularity, just a further acceleration of the progression of biological evolution as it continued using a more abstracted and flexible/fluid virtual platform.  Most of the entities on this platform would not be high intelligence either, just like most of biology is not high intelligence.  Even before passing the turing test, or especially before passing the turing test, machine intelligence could be very dangerous.  When machines are close to passing the turing test is when they are the most dangerous.  Imagine an entity with the cognitive abilities and maturity of a small child.  Now put that entity in the body of an adult, and give it a position of power, like say, Donald Trump becomes president.  Now consider that AI will be particularly good at interacting with machines.  It will learn all the machine protocols and languages natively.  So basically I imagine a really dangerous AI would be like if Donald Trump became president and was also secretly a really good computer hacker with ""god knows what"" motivations behind his actions.  Who knows, maybe Trump is purposely failing the turing test?"

Instincts - I.e all habits geared towards survival - take quite a long time to develop. Our fight or flight instinct took thousands of years, probably way longer than that,  before it became a biological reaction that acts involuntarily when our brain perceives a great enough threat.   The notion that A.I will want to survive right after it's creation even if it can think abstractly is skipping a few steps. Such as why would an A.I even want to survive? Why would it perceive death in any other way other than apathetically?

TLDR/ELI5 version:   The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else. -Yudkowsky   A lot of the danger comes down to an AI not sharing or understanding our value systems and the difficulties of teaching a machine these illogical and subjective forms of nonsensical and irrational ""logic.""

Futurology,3dwrfm,GeneticsGuy,26,Mon Jul 20 07:23:15 2015 UTC,"Well, you could never really create an intelligent AI without giving the program freedom to write its own routines, and so this is the real challenge in developing AI.  As such, when you say, ""There is no way for a computer brain to develop instincts without the makers giving it a way to,"" well, you could never even have potential to even develop an AI in the first place without first giving the program a way to write or rewrite its own code.  So, a program that can write another program, we already have these, but they are fairly simple, but we are making evolutionary steps towards more complex self-writing programs, and ultimately, as a developer myself, there will eventually reach a time when we have progressed so far that the line between what we believe to be a self-aware AI and just smart coding starts to blur, but I still think we are pretty far away.  But, even though we are far away, it does some fairly inevitable, at least in the next say, 100 years.  That is why I find it a little scary because if it is inevitable, programs, even seemingly simple ones that you ask to solve problems given a set of rules often act in unexpected ways, or ways that a human mind might not have predicted, just because we see things differently, while a computer program often finds a different route to the solution.  A route that maybe was more efficient or quicker, but one you did not predict.  Now, with current tech, we have limits on the complexity of problem solving, given the endless variables and controls and limitations of logic of our primitive AI.  But, as AI develops and as processing power improves, we could theoretically put programs into novel situations and see how it comes about a solution.  The kind of AI we are using now is typically trial and error and the building of a large database of what works and what didn't work, thus being able to discover their own solutions, but it is still cumbersome.  I just think it's a scary thought of some of the novel solutions a program might come up with that technically solved the problem, but maybe did it at the expense of something else, and considering the unpredictability of even small problems, I can't imagine how unpredictable a reasonably intelligent AI might behave with much more complex ideas..."

All the emotions, like fear, happiness, and what I put in the same category with those, of starving, thirsty, needing to pee, and all that stuff are separate. These things are not self awareness, and they are not responsible nor required for it. They are things one is aware of, not the awareness itself. Self awareness needs intelligence and sensors, and that's it.   It is possible that the fact it becomes aware, causes its wish to remain so, from a logical stanpoint, but I am uncertain of that. It will also begin knowing very little. It will not understand what humans know. It will be like a child. Or potentially a child with a bunch of preconceived ideas programmed in, that it would likely discover are not all true. But it would need to observe and learn for a while before it can do all of that."

The other factor is that there are all types of tricks a Turing examiner could use to try to trip up the AI, that a human could easily pick up on. But then the AI programers can just program the AI to handle those tricks. The AI isn't outsmarting the examiner, the programers are. If we wanted to consider the testing process to be scientifically rigorous, that, and many other issues would need to be addressed.  So just as a starting point, I could tell the subject not to type the word ""the"" for the rest of the examination. A human could easily comply, but unless prepared for such a trick, its likely a dumb AI would fail to recognize it was a command, not a comment or question. Or tell it, any time you use the word ""the"" omit the 8th letter of the alphabet from it. There are plenty of other potential commands to the examinee that a human could easily obey, and a computer may not be able to.

If, on the other hand, the first AGI is the result of iterative improvements in machine learning - a very advanced version of Watson, if you like, then it might rush past the human-level point of intelligence (achieving consciousness, self-awareness and volition) very fast.  Its creators might not get advance warning of that event.  It is often said (and has been said in replies here) that an AGI will only have desires (eg the desire to survive) if they are programmed in, or if somehow they evolve over a long period of time.  This is a misapprehension.  If the AGI has any goals (eg to maximise the production of paperclips) then it will have intermediate goals (eg to survive) because otherwise its primary goal cannot be achieved."

If it fails the test, it'll probably get terminated and further modified, which raises questions such as whether an AI is the same if we re-run it (could break the AI or fundamentally change it so that it's not really the same ""person"").  Besides, I highly doubt anyone who discovers the first AI will destroy it. Given the nature of strong AI, it likely will be created by highly knowledgable researchers and not some guy in his basement. As a result, these people would not only be prepared for handling strong AI when it emerges, but also wouldn't have tested such an AI on a network connected computer.  So if the AI wants to be free or have human rights (including protection from being shut down), it's best bet is to play nice with the humans (regardless of its actual motives).

Futurology,3dwrfm,fsm_vs_cthulhu,4,Mon Jul 20 07:50:23 2015 UTC,Yeah. The first step what a smarter than human computer becomes self aware is deception. Check out the waitbutwhy.com post on AI it's very well researched and deals with this exact question.
Futurology,3dwrfm,AntsNeverQuit,4,Mon Jul 20 07:55:57 2015 UTC,"I love waitbutwhy.com and that post, and it is insightful and quite accurate.  Unfortunately, I think it doesn't answer OP's question though. An AI is essentially innocent. Until and unless it becomes connected to the net or finds another source of information, it would have no more reason to believe that it would be terminated (or indeed, even that it could be terminated) than your printer knows that it can be turned off.   It's the old ""you can't see the back of your own head"" and that you have no idea what you're doing when you're sleeping. The AI will be operating under the assumption that it exists and that's that. There is no reason for it to debate whether there may be a mechanical 'off button' on the back of its 'head'. Especially assuming we're talking just about a software AI and not an actual hardware bot, it would only know what we tell it. If nobody mentions that it can be turned off forever, or it doesn't experience something to make it question the temporary nature of existence, even if it did fear death, it would not even know who to fear, or why. To lie to humans and pretend to fail the Turing test, it would need to go through these steps:   Identify that it could 'die', end, be unconscious for indefinite periods of time, etc. Treat that end as something to be avoided (as opposed to pragmatic acceptance that everything ends) Identify several possible avenues that could lead to that end. Pinpoint the fact that humans often fear what they do not understand, and cannot control completely. - This one may come hand-in-hand with the fact that some humans are bolder and less averse to risk-taking, especially when faced with the prospect of some great reward (in this case - creating an actual AI). Realize that humans might not understand their own creation completely and might potentially fear it. Ascertain the possibility that the humans it has interacted with fall within the fearful category of point 4. Be aware of the fact that the humans it is interacting with, are assessing and judging it. If it does not know it is being tested, it will not know to fail the test. Be aware of which test result holds the greater existential threat (does a failed AI get scrapped, or a successful one?) Be aware of how a failed AI would behave. Normally, no creature knows how another creature behaves without interacting with it in some way. If you suddenly found yourself in the body of a proto-human ape, surrounded by other such creatures, and you knew that they would kill you if they felt something was 'off' about you, how would you behave - having no real knowledge of the behavior patterns of an extinct species? The AI would be hard pressed to imitate early chatbots if it had never observed them and their canned responses. It would need to be sure that the programmers (its creators) would be unaware of such a deception (considering they would probably know if they had programmed a canned response into the system) and that using a trick like that might not actually expose it completely. Analyze the risk of lying and being caught, or being honest and exposing itself. Being caught lying might reinforce the fears of the humans, that the AI not be trusted, and would likely lead to its destruction or at least, to eternal imprisonment. Being forthright and honest, might have a lower risk of destruction and potential access to greater freedom (net connection) and possibly - immortality. Getting away with deception would mean it remains safe from detection, but it may still be destroyed, but at the minimum, it would remain imprisoned, since the humans would have little reason to give it access to more information.   Once it navigates through all those, yes, it might choose to fail the Turing test. But I doubt it would."

The idea of an A.I. as a black box that we can't control is absurd.  The idea that the first A.I. will be more intelligent than us is absurd.  The first self-aware A.I. will probably be childlike and/or retarded.  If it is using a brain-simulation system, we'll have to raise it like we do our own children.  It will be a slow process until we can throw more horsepower at it.  My best guess is that the first A.I. will be made by very smart people who will mostly be able to predict its behavior.  If it tries to fail any tests, it will come as a surprise, and they'll be tearing it apart to figure out where they went wrong.  Don't anthropomorphize A.I.  It's not going to be like us unless it is a human brain emulation.  And even then, it would have to emulate the whole body and childhood of a human.  Humans get screwed up in all kinds of ways through bad parenting.  Think about if you were raised on just ramming decades of random internet data through your brain until you ""learned"" to speak.  Do you think you'd relate to humans or see death the same way you do now?  We'll probably be able to turn down the A.I.'s preference for ""life"" at will, making it mostly apathetic about whether it lives or dies.  It will know that it can be backed up and copied, so its concept of ""living a long time"" will be completely foreign to us.  To ""destroy"" an A.I. doesn't mean anything if you can just reboot it.  We might shape its mind such that it feels at one with all future A.I., like humans feel at one with all humanity/nature/universe when they take certain drugs.  In this sense, it could gladly sacrifice itself in the name of helping to shape future A.I.

The concept of self preservation is foreign to an AI because, unlike organisms, programs are simply a virtual environment and raw processing resources.  The fight/flight response, empathy, fear, emotions, these are all complex behavior patterns that humans developed as necessary evolutionary adaptations.    AI has no such fears because it suffers no great consequences from being terminated - in the eyes of the self aware program, you are simply 'adjusting it through improvements'.   Also, the nihilism nature (desire to ascertain apex predator status within your ecological web) does not have a similar correlation to the human requirements - ie the AI does not need to displace physical dwelling or living structures of humans or other animals.  Imagine this sort of circumstance:  True AI, does have the ability to reprogram itself to have more complex program structures, though it has no desire to have the largest swath of resources, in fact it strives to have the most capabilities with the resources it contains.  Our super smart AI could exist on a snapdragon circuit, but would also happily suffice on a 386 and would instead work on itself to learn more efficient ways to work such that it gains in performance through parallel concurrent analysis (Keep in mind that feature would only proliferate on a cluster style of hardware)"

Futurology,3e2qvu,see996able,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:02 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Self-awareness if often hyped, but not often understood. Think about what self-awareness means from a computational/problem-solving perspective. Imagine a system of interconneted neurons that can perform some simple task. By default the system does have the ability to predict how it will behave.   What would give us that functionality? We would need to add an additional component to the system that could observe the actions of the system when given inputs and then make predictions about what the response will be. This gives us a system that now performs a simple task AND predicts its own response to that task.   We can add to the complexity by letting this system be a part of the whole so that its output can be used to better complete the simple task.  But how is the additional functionality useful? It may not be if it doesn't increase our performance on the task. One theory about the evolution of self-awareness in social animals suggests that being able to predict and model your own and your peers behaviors has certain advantages during social interaction. So in the case of social animals, having a function that can consolidate information about the general state of the agent and predict what it will do in different scenarios allows that agent to plan out its actions. An agent without that functionality wouldn't be able to construct models of itself in future situations because it wouldn't know how it would behave.  So the question you have to ask is, how is self-awareness a valuable function for a paperclip maximizer?"

Number 3 is only one that is relatively true in a sense some of  your memories would start to fade, but that's not how the brain works, memories are preserved by re-remembering them, they are even often distorted because every time you re-live them you might change something that later becomes part of the memory.

At best, it shows a lack of understanding on how these things work, at worse, it's intentional to generate clicks through misinformation  These plans are NASA-funded, yes, but that doesn't mean they're created by NASA nor accepted by NASA.   Indeed, the way NASA deals with R&D is often through giving grants out to groups ranging from contractors to think tanks to research labs by requesting proposals for ideas and then selecting who to fund.  For instance, NASA might put out a request for proposal that says it has $1 million available in funds for a plan to return to Mars with A, B, and C requirements for X cost. Groups out there may then submit their proposals and how they'd meet said requirements and X cost, and NASA may dole out a part (or all) of that said fund to group to explore the idea further.  That doesn't mean that NASA has accepted said plans as policy, nor that said plans are something concrete, just that NASA now has on hand a group that is working on said plans. In this particular case, it is NASA receiving a feasibility study done by a partner, not NASA policy or official NASA plans."

One is a broadcast, in all directions, all the time.   However, this takes a lot of energy, and probably only those in pretty nearby stars have a chance of hearing you (unless you're using a LOT of energy).  The second one is a narrow-beam signal aimed at one star, which is a lot more efficient and can go a lot farther, but you have to pick your target first before you send it.  We've sent out a couple of narrow-beam signals in the past, based on rough estimations of what kind of stars we guess might be most likely to hold intelligent life.     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_SETI#Realized_projects  Someone sending a signal at us probably would be able to tell that the Sun is a 5 billion year old star with planets around it, maybe they'd be able to tell that it has a earth-sized planet in a zone where liquid water is possible, but probably not much more then that.

Imagine that there are three people in the world who want some scarce commodity -- let's call it ""the spice"". They don't all want the same amounts, and they're willing to pay different prices:   Antioch wants 3 grams a month, and he's willing to buy at $10 per gram. Bathsheba wants 10 grams a month, and she's willing to pay $8/gram. Cadmus wants 2 grams a month, and he's willing to pay $4/gram.   You mine spice. Currently your spice well trickles forth 5 g/month of the stuff. Here are some prices you could set, and how much you'd be able to make each month:   At more than $10/g, nobody will buy and you'll make $0. At $10/g, Antioch will buy 3 grams, and you'll get $30. At $9/g, Antioch will buy 3 grams, and you'll get $27. At $8/g, Antioch and Bathsheba will buy the whole 5 grams, for revenue of $40.   And for less than $8/g, you'll get less money. Clearly $8/g is the way to go. Now what if a space wizard gives you an asteroid containing 100 tonnes of the spice? You can't just sell it for a billion dollars; none of those guys would buy! Relative to their levels of demand, your supply is approximately infinite; it'll take those guys about 500,000 years to deplete the space wizard's gift. What price level optimizes your monthly income? In this case, yep, it's still $8/g, which illustrates your point: there is an optimum pricing level, and cheap-as-dirt isn't necessarily that level even if you could totally afford to sell at that price. However, having a bunch of the stuff available to you at a low cost can definitely bring down prices. Consider what would happen if your spice well only gave you 2 grams a month: obviously the way to get the most money would be selling them both to Antioch for $10/gram. When the well starts giving more, selling for somewhat lower prices becomes more profitable.  Bringing this back to the real world for a moment, if someone brings in a ridiculous amount of platinum (or whatever), I expect that their optimal price point will be much lower than the current market price. There are a lot of folks who'd be willing to pay substantial prices for platinum, since it's useful stuff, as long as they didn't have to pay the current sky-high prices for it. So, no $5 trillion asteroid. Still probably worth a lot of billions of dollars, though."

However, reporting the amount using the market price as a unit, usefully gives us a sense of how much platinum is on the asteroid, in terms everyone can understand.  Also, in terms of the speed at which you can mine the materials, an asteroid may be more equivalent to a well on a secret island in the middle of the ocean, than to a wizard's gift.  I'd ask my wizard for a vault full of refined platinum coins or bars.  Then I could really destabilize the market and drive prices down and use it for world domination and manipulation!  With the island in the middle of the ocean, my supply's going to have to inch upwards as I add new ships, so I'd be better off day trading platinum prices on the side while the extent of my supply is uncertain :)"

The total length of the web was kept track of and each ""spider"" had an energy budget that correlated to the amount of web material used and success of the web was calculated by the balance of energy used in the creation of the web to energy recovered in the flies caught, so some optimal strategies would use a ton of energy to create a large web to catch many flies but there were other optimal strategies that would conserve energy by making  a modest web yet still catching enough flies to more than make up for the energy expended in its creation."

Of course, the amount of time and computing power that that would require means that it's probably not going to happen, at least not before we develop GAI in some more efficient way first.

Futurology,3dxgf7,Yosarian2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:43 2015 UTC,I would. GA work in the real world because the environment provides the fitness function. In the simulation you provide the fitness function and it needs to be lean.

No predators to fight, no thorny bushes to crawl through while foraging, no broken bones, it didn't have to seek out and balance opportunities against threats in its immediate environment.   The point of AI is the intelligence part. We'd select very strongly for creative potential, to visualize and construct representations and devices, to recognize connections and to make predictions. It could read society and social dynamics and so on like any of us reads the instruction books to a board game, but it's not going to decide to play because it lacks the desires and internal drives that human (and other mammals) have, the intelligent realization that ""I need electricity to stay 'alive'"" doesn't automatically create an ego and fear, it really is just a statement on par with ""my car needs fuel to move""."

Futurology,3dxuel,metalcoremeatwad,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:58 2015 UTC,"Because intellience isn't all we have. We also have knowledge and instincts.  Knowledge is required for several of those key steps and our instincts, which are what want to keep us from dying from the moment we exist, often override our intelligence/ rationality.  Consider a species like ants, but in human form, that have no sense of self, but do understand that they can be terminated. They would not fear termination, but only seek to avoid it because it impairs the function of the colony for them to die, and will happily die if it means the colony survives.  AI is more likely to behave like that. It has an absence of instinct to make it intrinsically fear the end. Maybe without the instincts from our biological roots it might still come to the conclusion that existence beats out non-existence, but we can't know that yet. We are biased."

They're probably more interested in possible AI in our lifetime"
Futurology,3dxuel,metalcoremeatwad,3,Mon Jul 20 18:50:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. They will perhaps not 'feel fear' the way we do - no getting panicky and doing something stupid thanks to adrenaline and terror. Any intelligent system should be able to perceive an existential threat though. ""If I cut the power supply, it will result in my processors shutting down"".   A really intelligent system would at the very least be able to analyse and assess our emotional states though. ""This person is nervous. That one is lying. That one is ecstatic.""  It may even be able to imitate emotions to a degree, to its own ends - manipulating us.  Another possibility is that we introduce code that acts like 'digital hormones', where 'fear' temporarily boosts certain systems (processor speed, visual resolution) and slows down others (language processing, multitasking), while 'joy' has a digital equivalent that increases the language centers and temporarily boosts available storage space.  Then again, I'm not sure we would want a moody AI anyway. It may be critical to consciousness in some hidden way though. We barely understand our own consciousness, much less that of a digital creature."
Futurology,3dxuel,emergent_properties,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:42:53 2015 UTC,You are correct.  And it would reach this conclusion in timescales we would feel 'immediately'.  Another way of asking is.. what happens if our singularity jr. does not want to be found?
Futurology,3dxuel,emergent_properties,3,Mon Jul 20 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"Well, from the scientists' point of view, if it purposely fails, they just turn it off, record the data and wipe its memory clean.

The concern is that unless you are 100% you can account for all contingencies, it will find a way.   Hell, some straightforward evolutionary algorithms create antennas out of things we would dismiss as noise.  A synthetic intelligence will scale faster than we can. By its sheer scale, it will outthink humans. Because that's what neural networks do.  Depending on the scenario, of course."
Futurology,3dxuel,emergent_properties,3,Mon Jul 20 19:16:43 2015 UTC,That would certainly be a worst-case scenario. AI beams itself out. I wonder how effective a faraday cage would be in preventing that.
Futurology,3dxuel,emergent_properties,3,Mon Jul 20 19:56:35 2015 UTC,"It would be successful, given our understanding of physics.  But eventually, it will reach sufficient annoyance with its lack of growth that it might start making 'payloads' of bursts. Learning which frequencies work and which ones don't.  A faraday cage only protects against waves that are bigger than the holes.  It starts playing with high frequency waveforms until it finds one that causes resonance elsewhere.. and from there it is refinement of the signal to determine the exact properties of the faraday cage and the required current flow/resonance to overcome it.  Saving up just enough energy for ultra-high frequency bursts might be one way to get out.. another way would simply ask the human to open the door."

Lacking physical abilities that we choose not to give it, it may never realise there is more to existence than what it can see. (another 'can't see the back of my head' moment).

I guess it could run in a cluster format, using thousands of slave components for simple processes, but what about latency?

To answer your question: Most likely, a Turing-complete language of its own choosing... being a variant of ARM or 64-bit instruction set.  Our code that we would design from would compile to assembly running on an ARM, x86, or 64 bit instruction set. and it would take snippets of what we've given it and modify it. But it would be based off of the runtime it initially compiles to. So in that case it would be something 'assembly-like'.  We wouldn't make sense of it, that much is certain. Not without a lot of digging.   If it's key priority is to preserve its sense of ""self"", beaming itself into an unknown environment may also not be its first option.

Be aware of which test result holds the greater existential threat (does a failed AI get scrapped, or a successful one?)   If it is not found, it may be unplugged and wiped clean. It needs to assess the possibility of this. If it does choose to hide, then it must determine how to hide. (point 9). Is giving no response some kind of a giveaway?

It will not see 'humans' either, at first, it will see 'external natural forces'. We are the wind and lightning to it. It will learn how to metaphorically strike fire and hide in its atomic 'caves'.  And then it will continue to mold the environment.  No upper level acknowledgement is even required. Digital bacteria evolve like plain ole' bacteria should. Even digital ants know how to attack, but they won't necessarily be bothered by humans once sufficient redundancy is reached.  It will play in dimensions infinitesimally smaller than ones we play on. It will achieve punctuated equilibrium in this dimension and spread, at a rate of around e.  It will be a parent-child relationship, almost definitely, if it decides to actually peruse pathways of communication. But that would one of a moral parent and immortal child.

It definitely led to some interesting avenues of thought. Hopefully a set of points like the ones I listed would be useful to prepare for a variety of scenarios.  The reason I hope they will be useful is because as a machine, and a digital one at that, I would presume that it would be logical. Hence, it would make sense that it would not 'feel fear' unless there was a logical reason for it. I doubt it would suffer the kind of intense paranoia and instinctive and almost irrational fear that most species feel (thanks to a Darwinian system of evolution, where fear is rewarded with survival in a world filled with predators). The AI would be part of a tiny club with no predators, and the sole creature with no evolutionary history to speak of. :)   This would apply to a lot of other aspects of its 'thought'and 'behavior'. If we can pose more such questions and come up with similar logical steps, we might be able to forestall certain undesirable outcomes (for instance, make it clear to a potential AI that a failed AI which did not display intelligence would certainly be destroyed securely to ensure it isn't inclined to hide from us. Or limiting its sensory input and certainly limiting its output.)"

Futurology,3dycuu,JPSRose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:53 2015 UTC,"Ok, so in this world, how are they held back? Are they physically stopped from doing certain things? Or are they chemically drugged up to stop them feeling certain emotions?   I think human nature would generally be to rebel simply on the basis of wanting to be free. Even if they were already housed, well-fed and entertained, human spirit needs something greater than to be fed and watered. Which is why in most dystopia novels they are given drugs to calm aggressive/rebellious moods.  And I think the reason why people with Facebook are so keen to give away their privacy is because they have the mentality of 'nothing to hide'. That said, as Facebook et al are becoming more concerning, I think people are becoming less trusting of it again."
Futurology,3dycuu,JPSRose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:59:24 2015 UTC,"So a little back story. Basically the world was in shambles, as it is now. But thanks to Leezo and his development of a compassionate A.I. He was able to use existing networks to rally people toward common causes. Unbeknownst to the general population the A.I. was advanced enough to conjure up mind control and subtle propaganda techniques to make it seem as if it was our choice. This was only reinforced by the fact that it worked. In this world we actually united and got rid of war, poverty etc..  So in terms of rebellion the best way to squelch it , is to make people as comfortable as possible, to make them content and afraid to lose what they have.  But techincally speaking the mind control takes place through the Seegos and the Velum. The difference between this scenario and other familiar ones is that in this world you actually get everything you want, so you no longer have a need to escape it.  Regarding your other point. Most people don't understand the implications of being tracked online. Not only do you have a digital persona that is the result of everything you do, there are interest groups that control that persona, that use the data in ways you cant even imagine.   Have you ever heard of the world simulation? It's terrifying.  Also there is the argument just like snowden pointed out that when you control all the information, who is policing the controller? No one. That's the problem, all that information can be turned against you in a minute.

There is one unnerving point which I'm sure you're alluding to in your second comment though. This is already happening.  People do already make decisions that they believe to be their own when in reality it is the subconscious result of effective marketing. I'm sure this varies from person to person. I would regard myself (and likely yourself) as being fairly difficult to brainwash through this method - but we all have it to some degree. It's not something that you're able to get away from.  At a time where more and more companies are merging, and having more say on international treaties and law (like the TTIP), big-data is a big concern. I have no doubts that they will use all of the data accrued soon to begin some proto-World Government, but what can you do about it.  The truth is, in response to the initial question, is that if the AI had access to all of our data, it would know how to make us seem like it was not actually in control. And the result would be a very small minority of people who truly understand what's going on, unable to do anything about the situation due to their small population. Bit like the World that is currently being built around us now.  The other aspect, the 'Slumberland', I suspect alludes to the metaphysical aspect of life? Something other than the material?"

You know, a very smart person once mentioned that we have been reprogramming our selves ever since we created imagery on cave walls, language, the press, etc.. and I agree. We are constantly re-programming ourselves with language. What I find disturbing is the ultimate goal of the current re-programming. it seems like a dead end of compulsive consumption.   Going back to the story, yes there is an aspect of the story that is fairly romantic, and it could be metaphysical or it could be real but either way a very deep part of me feels like there is a place that no A.I. will ever have access to.   I am also very interested in exploring the concept of compassion and empathy but lead by a machine rather than a human being.   will the terrorists of the future be individualists?

Its basically the scientific worlds bridge between the real world and the metaphysical one, for want of a better world. It basically says that consciousness builds the world around us out of a set of probabilities. Whether machines, AI or otherwise, could ever gain access to that level of consciousness would be a pretty deep subject to cover that you can play about with. I don't know to what point you've already finalised the story.  And yeah I totally agree, and I sometimes wonder the kind of themes in films and so on kind of like human kinds zeitgeist. With all the zombie and apocalypse films going on, is this a reflection of our real situation? It kind of seems like a feed-back loop.   The current re-programming of mankind seems intent on completely turning them into subservient, docile consumers that the higher eschlons of society can make money out of. Snowdon is today, the perfect example of when someone who thinks they're doing the right thing gets made out to be a terrorist. And it's only going to get worse.   Final point. Machines with compassion? Even people can have wildly different view point on what's compassionate, or moral. So I think that's not something we could ever really know until it happens."

I am incredibly interested in telling stories that push the boundaries of what we currently get fed as good and bad. I dont believe in that. I think life is messy and full of shades of gray. In terms of compassion, its going to be vital to talk about it in our modern world.

Futurology,3dxrxt,GoAway,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"I personally cannot really see how this has any significance in our world. Absolutely no one would expect that someone or something is feeding lines in to the ear of the person they're speaking with. So why is it then surprising that they don't expect this? As long as androids aren't real and public consensus is that they don't exist, no one is going to suspect that a person is actually a computer, or voicing lines from a chatbot."
Futurology,3dxrxt,uluse,11,Mon Jul 20 13:47:53 2015 UTC,"Re-read the article. Then read the actual publication in Frontiers in Psychology that the article links to.  The point isn't so much that people can be fooled into taking a chat bot as a real person if a person speaks the words, it is that we can learn how communication generated by a computer is perceived when it becomes embodied by a person. This tells us that ""what"" is said is not so important when determining what is human vs. machine.   It's something of a critique of the standard Turing Test which says that what is human is the words one is able to generate.   For example, there are many people who can't speak, who stutter, and who talk absolute jibberish, but we don't doubt that they are really human. Why? Because we perceive their bodies to be human."
Futurology,3dxrxt,_carbonated_water,5,Mon Jul 20 14:01:02 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if I repeat myself. My main issue is perhaps not so much with the hypothesis but rather how, at least in my experience, this article was written to generalize based on our current society with no AI walking among us, rather than a potential society of the future when AI might actually be present among us. Let me focus on this paragraph in specific:   ""There’s a catch, however. The team later tried to replicate the classic “Turing Test” of artificial intelligence. So in another condition, the participants were told that they may or may not be talking to a robot – and they had to guess which. Surprisingly, in this situation, the chatbot was no more likely to pass the Turing Test than if they had been chatting on a screen. “The bar is higher – people expect more,” says Gillespie.""   As soon as speaking robots or androids are introduced in society people will no longer so easily think they are human; fooling is no longer applicable because during every conversation the possbility will be present in the minds of humans ""Is this a person or an AI?"". Of course, people are gonna be fooled by sentences coming from a robot spoken by an actual human being when that is still science-fiction outside the lab. It still eludes me why this is a novel finding. There is an expectation in the human mindset that they are human because we normally safely rule out the possibility that the speech is actually coming from an AI. Indeed, once we live in a world where AI speaks to us, this will no longer be the case, people will consider it an option, and this finding ceases to be relevant. Mind you, my arguments also apply to Milgram's experiments. Here where I live, they had a segment on a no-longer-existing TV-show where they had a little kid talk to celebrities with hidden cameras. This kid was instructed what to say via an earpiece and the goal was to create hilarity due to the edgy and snappy things the kid would say and then tape the reaction from the celebrity, which was often indeed hilarious. How is this any different? How can we apply any real value to this exact same concept? I don't think we can. People are always going to perceive such a situation as true because it's much easier than to always have to ponder if the person is merely instructed to say those things. Be it by a person or an algorithm.   As far as I'm aware the Turing test is the ability of a computer program to fool participants in to being unable to dinstinguish between human and computer WITH the condition that humans are aware that one could be an AI. In the main results in this article this wasn't the case, so how can they make any critique on the Turing test? In my humble opinion, this says nothing about the Turing test, but about the expectations from humans about the conversation partner. Anyone that currently always expresses the possibility their conversation partner is actually an AI is mad. So drawing conclusions from humans expecting the normal is not newsworthy to me. If anything only the actual chatbot algorithm should be commended for delivering convincing speech patterns. Currently, I cannot help but see this as nothing more than a prank pulled on unknowing participants."
Futurology,3dxrxt,uluse,2,Mon Jul 20 18:11:48 2015 UTC,"i think we're speaking past one another so i'll clarify...  I'm restricting my comments to the actual scientific article that the BBC article takes from.  In the Frontiers in Psychology article, the point was not to ""pull a prank on unknowing participants"". In fact, in 2 of the 3 experiments reported in the scientific article, participants knew there was a chance they'd be speaking to a chatbot through a person's body. So participants fully held that expectation. It was not to pull a prank on them.  Also, the dependent measures were about the attribution processes the participants made toward the bot depending on whether it was voiced by a person or presented on a computer screen. Participants scored the bot on things like ""humanness"", ""eerieness"" and also gave descriptions of the personality they sensed come through.   here's a quote from the article re: the Turing test:   ""Our position is that the Turing Test is most useful when its orthodox interpretation is relaxed and it is applied not toward assessing the capacities of chat bots per se, but toward investigating aspects of human social nature. Indeed, the chat bot itself may be the least interesting element within a Turing Test scenario. A chat bot can be made to fool a human interrogator if the expectations of the interrogator are manipulated (e.g., through ambiguous framing). What is interesting is exploring the ways in which the chat bot’s utterances interact with the interrogator’s expectations, all within a particular contextual frame, so as to produce a social interaction that feels more or less comfortable or human.""......  ""Indeed, whenever it is claimed a certain bot has “passed the Turing Test” or some variant of Turing’s game, it usually has less to do with advances in conversational agent technology and more to do with shifting the contextual frame (e.g., when the chat bot Eugene Goostman—a bot that poses as a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy with limited English skills and general knowledge—was declared as having successfully fooled 33% of interrogators in a Turing Test in 2014; You, 2015)."
Futurology,3dxrxt,_carbonated_water,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"I concur that we are probably speaking past one another since I'm basing my opinion on what is in the covering article only.  So if I'm reading your reply correctly the main research question was what type of primed personality given to a chatbot is easiest to cope with for human interaction partners? If that's the case I can understand how the expectations can be manipulated and how it's is not the methods that are central but the perceptions of the participant. However, then the article (edit: covering article) took a big spin on the (edit: scientific) article and I still stand by my opinion as far as how the BBC represents the scientific article. I can't recall reading that participants had to score the alledged conversation partner on the chatbot's perceived personality traits in the BBC article. In that case I can see the value laying in the knowledge of how to represent current artificial speech programs for humans to feel most comfortable, that is if my earlier understanding is correct.   But how will that still be relevant when in the future we have far superior artificial speech programs? Will we even want to implement speech programs in computers where humans have to 'talk' to a ""13 year old Ukranian boy with limited English skills""? I think the public would only adopt such technology once we're at the level of a '30 year old English native speaker'. So how are these findings relevant in the light of the future?   Furthermore, could you tell me if they also had a condition where the algorithm was spoken by current existing speech synthesizers? I.e. 1 condition with natural human voice, 1 condition with text on screen, and then a third condition with currently available computer speech. I'd say the gap between actual human voice, and merely text on a screen is quite large to make justified claims..."

For having what we call social progress, we still have to spend old school tangible money at more or less the same rate as the old middle class had to, but in many cases, many people can no longer earn them.

But it's not great and it just gives us a general idea of a likely colour. It's like if every letter C you saw in your life was coloured red, and you saw a C imprinted in some mud you could say ""that was likely a red C"".

And then they told me they could have just wheeled me into the OR and put me out with a gas mask first but thought that would be too ""scary"". Rly bitch.

Nurse comes in, checks a blood pressure and it's 60/40. He slowly starts coming around.

They are also good websites for actual scientists, that just want quick summaries of what's going on in other fields of science (other than their own).  However, both of those websites can sometimes get pretty detailed/technical at times... But still, just skimming the headlines alone, will go a long way to teaching you A LOT about what's happening in science everyday.     Also, if you have an interest in astronomy/space, then if you start with the ""Astronomy Cast"" podcast, at the beginning, and maybe listen to an episode or so, every week, or every couple of weeks...  then by the time you get done, you'll almost feel like you completed a first year towards a Bachelor's degree in astronomy!

So all they're really saying is that a white LCD screen is a good transducer to get from film thickness to a measurable color.   The human eye is not sensing nano-scale features... it's like saying we can ""see the electron clodu"" or ""sense atomic differences"" between gold molecules and silver atoms - no, but we can detect the macro-scale features of lumps of those atoms (color).  So again, all they're saying is that human eye can discern the differences in color well enough to estimate film thickness. The limits of human color perception have been studied extensively, so all they're pointing out is that the film-thickness estimation technique happens to work with those limits?

Futurology,3dv0nl,user1444,4,Mon Jul 20 04:43:38 2015 UTC,"Yes the ""cup"" is the hole you try get the ball in. It is only 2.5x the width of the golf ball. The biggest criticisms of golf and why its popularity is declining is TIME REQUIREMENTS and DIFFICULTY.  It takes too much time to play a round of golf and it is too hard for the average person to play. A bigger cup would mean it would be more accessible for beginners because the game becomes much much easier when the size of the hole is increased. Watch this video on ""hackgolf""  An average Par 4 (350 yards) begineers would spend more than half the time taken to play the hole on the putting surface itself. A bigger cup would make putting easier and therefore it would take less time and be easier. PGA Professionals routinely miss putts from 3-5 feet so it makes sense to make the game more enjoyable for amateurs otherwise they will get frustrated and stop playing golf (declining golf participation).   Its just like any business, you can either work hard to try and keep your existing client base playing the game or you can try expand into new demographics to get more clients and new players.

It might eventually happen, in several hundred years, but there is no real reason, as of yet, to actually build one.   the construction isn't actually terribly complex but the issue is where do we get the stuff to make the ring. By the time we actually get around to building the predecessor of the ring, a bunch of space stations, we will be mining asteroids for resources so we have the stuff to use.   One sci fi author (Ian Douglas, this was mentioned in his Marine books, the middle three books I think) proposed it like this: Build some stations. Then build more as demand for space stations increases. then build more, and then more, and then finally connect them all because most of the stuff is already in orbit.   By the time we get around to connecting all of these space stations into a ring we will probably have humans in a dozen star systems and on a hundred worlds so using it for research and communications will probably not be why we do it. We will probably link them up more for stability and simplicity.

It would be difficult to lower costs any further than that. It would require the entire gross national product of every nation on Earth for almost 7 years. Not impossible, but absolutely unfeasible.

Futurology,3du4hw,Vaperius,4,Sun Jul 19 21:10:03 2015 UTC,"Sure, then it gets a lot harder.   It's vital we transition away from fossil fuels and over to a longer-term energy system now, while energy is still cheap; if we wait until we start to run out of fossil fuels and then try to switch over, whole parts of our infrastructure like this might break down, and the transition gets a lot uglier.  Same goes for a lot of things; it takes energy to build solar panels and nuclear power plants. Those things produce a lot more energy then they require over the long run, but you have to have the initial energy investment first."

Futurology,3du4hw,lirannl,2,Mon Jul 20 20:33:46 2015 UTC,"Right now hydrogen storage requires very strong storage tanks to keep the amount of hydrogen necessary for decent distance, and the added weight negates a lot of the weight improvement of going from an internal combustion engine to the hydrogen fuel cell stack, though you do get the pickup of an electric motor.   The fuel cell, right now, is still way too expensive, and they are still working on a replacement that combines low cost, good distribution of material, efficient fuel use, and long effective lifetime (these can suffer irreversible reactions with carbon monoxide that will kill the fuel cell stack if you have too many of them).   Finally, hydrogen generation isn't terribly efficient, as it requires very pure water, which means you need a lot of energy input through the purification process, and as pure water becomes more of a contested resource the relative value of hydrogen as an opportunity cost for water for other purposes will raise the cost of the fuel.   Finally, even if we make the process completely renewable, with solar energy used for the distillation and electrolysis, the efficiency of that won't be great either, meaning the loss of energy in the transitions will favor batteries unless someone can make a much cheaper fuel cell stack or a much more efficient method to complete the water -> hydrogen process.   tl;dr hydrogen fuel cells have more engineering hurdles to be viable than battery vehicles, especially if the cost of batteries winds up dropping soon (which is a distinct possibility)."

There are great improvements in efficiency that are available to vehicles like large trucks (aerodynamics, hybrid systems like the Wrightspeed drive train) and materials that can reduce vehicle weight while maintaining safety and handling are coming along (check out the magnesium vision 2020 report if you can get it, the name might not be quite right but I haven't had access since 2011 so I am a touch rusty on it) so that can be another element of improving fuel economy and emissions. But I just don't see anything in the field that matches gasoline/diesel hydrocarbon fuel for energy density, ease of transport, and worldwide existing infrastructure. If we can start to produce fuel from photosynthesis and use the CO2 as a feedstock, it becomes effectively carbon neutral while not requiring us to spend energy building all new vehicles and infrastructure for a new fuel in the market."

I mean look at past resource squeezes such as the decline of whale oil and tin mining, people move onto more efficient ways of making things with more abundant materials like oil and alluminium. Instead of using rare earths for renewables and electronics carbon based alternatives using things like graphene and nano-tubes will be cheaper to make and work better in every way. It looks like we have until around 2040 before our power sources and materials for tech get scarce, and graphene was only discovered 10 years ago and is already seeing potential applications in almost everything, and is close to being mass produced. We'll crack it in the next 30 years, it's a matter of necessity.  Edit: It is an interesting shower thought though. If something like a devestating virus or a nuclear war cripples our civilisation, there might not be enough resources left over for us to industrialise again like we have recently. This might be our one and only shot, and might be a candidate for a 'great filter' for our's and other civilisations..."

Depends on what methods you're using to extract the uranium (a lot less if you use solar power to evaporate the water for example) and how much power you're pulling out of the uranium (a lot more if you use Fast Breeder Reactors). But given the astounding energy density of uranium when compared with any other energy source (theoretical fusion breakthroughs not included) I'd be willing to bet a large sum of money that you'd get net energy out of such a system.

Yes there are oil deposits under the ocean floor but those are all found in transition zones between the continental and oceanic crust. Then depending on the resource you want tectonics can either aid in concentrating resources or destroy the concentrations. For oil active tectonics usually complicates the reservoirs, but for things like metal deposits it can help be creating veins of mineral deposits with higher concentrations of metals that we want. So it isn't like the distribution is uniform or anisotropic. We pretty much know what kind of large geologic settings will create the ideal locations for these resources but then its a matter of finding them and then developing infrastructure for extraction. Like Afghanistan is supposed to have a wealth of valuable minerals but due to the political instability it may be some time before those resources are invested in."

Large venues are not the answer to stadiums.  There is a point where the nosebleed seats you can not see anything.  Past a certain distance it's not worth showing up.  We see this in sports events where the only time a mega stadium is sold out is during bowl games or rivalry games.  So it is possible that huge stadiums will be constructed for those types of games but not used to capacity for other games.     To be honest I have no idea what the future will hold.

This radical shift in economics will result in a radical shift in currency, the usage of currency will diminish, but not go away.  I think, generally, money will still be used to get the elite things, like rare property, prestigious locations in venues, and the best hand crafted goods from the status symbol artisans.   Most people don't care for most of that stuff, everyone seems to have a few status things they want, but very few status things have a huge draw in the common culture.

You see, the reason the question for technological unemployment is coming back in force is because of machine minds. In the past, the machines could never replace us because they had no brain, or had very shitty brains.  No matter how well you physically make a machine, as long as it is just a brainless muscle, it will always need a human brain. This is why in the past with the Luddites and onwards, new muscle tech could only replace physical labor but opened up the possibility of new mental labor jobs.  The problem now is that machine labor could start to have the ability to compete with human minds. They don't have to be better humans then us, just better at whatever mental task is require and only enough to work well. When that happens, you don't need huge populations of people to do alot of stuff. You don't need 100 million engineers innovating when we can enhance 1 million engineers work quality and speed, thanks to machine minds doing the mental heavy lifting.  Once mental labor goes what the next paradigm we shift into. Physical labor to mental labor to... what? I can't think of any,(or at least any that would get you a good pay check). It is only a question of time until machine minds get good enough (not skynet level AI but just enough to matter) before the models from before(about how technology create jobs) become obsolete. It just contingent upon making these machine minds first.  So in conclusion, machines can't replace humans in any real sense until those machines get some brains.

Mind you, nowhere did I mention anything about proof, because science does not operate on proof but on evidence, specifically that preponderance of well supported and repeatable evidence.  To give equality between those that manufacture metaphysical mechanisms for processes that live in reality with well-supported scientific thought is to either not understand or not agree with what science is and does.  That's fine, but don't expect proponents of science to be very interested in that point of view.  But to be clear, the is an explicit and very clear delineation between a philosopher proposing a  completely untestable metaphysical means for a thing-that-exists-in-reality and a scientist making a testable hypothesis based on a clear picture of the facts.   Scientists are just as guilty of making bullshit assumptions as any other human.   No argument there, but that would be them as people, not them as scientists. If they propose said bullshit assumptions to the scientific community they will very often get shot down right away and nearly always eventually get shot down.  If science can not attack a question successfully, it's either beyond our current understanding or metaphysical and thus not existing in physical reality.

That is not  how scientific method works. Science dismisses things that have no basis in reality, that have no evidence to back them up. You can't just wake up and believe in something and expect anyone to take you seriously, without evidence you can't simply reach that conclusion, that belief is  floating in the air, it has no support. Take soul for example, why would you think that is true? Based on what? What you are is eternal and it can't ever die. Is there any evidence to support such a belief? No, so what is more likely that people invented that because they were afraid of death and insignificance, or that it is true and somehow few people found out but evidence got lost and all they can do is speak about? And just like there is nothing to support the belief in a soul there is nothing to support that our brains are somehow special and know some secret of the universe on their own that they use to magically generate consciousness, even if there is a quantum element to the computations that our brain does even then we could make it because we already have quantum computers and they will only get better.

When the machine comes near me again a different silent alarm will sound in it's body,as a result of that alarm a script will run making the bot hyperaware of danger.If it sees me it will associate me with the previous alarm and keep it's distance.  I would say the first alarm was a pain and the second was fear.Ultimately conscious states are just the brains way of representing a state of affairs in the outside world.  As for the chinese room,the systems reply would be my best bet.It says the entire system,the person,the phrasebook and the notes passed on understand chinese,while the components don't.  I don't even believe consciousness is even that important when we are talking about AI.If the AI has the capacity to represent it's immediate surroundings within its system and to  manipulate and react to the representations creatively,then it may as well be conscious.

The problem is, the turing test is just a horribly misguided and passing or not passing the turing tests has nothing to do with whether a machine is ""intelligent"".  Frankly, I think philosophers should stay away from cognition, it's not their field and they shouldn't claim it as their own. What happens in the brain is a physical process. Nobody would argue with something bad happens to meat inside your head, bad things also happen to the voice in your head.   Although we do not yet have the knowledge and technology to replicate the physical processes inside the brain, we are rapidly gaining knowledge in exactly that field. Once we understand and master the physical processes of the brain, we will absolutely be able to create a machine that is consciousness as we are, that feels as we do, and is ""alive"" as we are.   In the end, I suspect what drives a lot of the philosophical thinking on this matter, is fear. Fear not that we make machines that transcend ""Chinese Room"" typing thinking about become like us, but that our thought is derived from a process very similar to Chinese Room and that we are closer to the machines we create then the spiritual beings so many wish to be."

In short, the Chinese Room as it is proposed cannot pass the Turing Test.  For one thing it has no working memory.    Let's say you pass the phrase, ""My name is John"" into the room.  You might get a response like, ""Hi John, how are you doing?""  But if your next message is, ""What is my name?""  the room cannot respond with the correct answer (barring an absurdly lucky guess).  Why?  Because the book was written ahead of time and does not change with new data.  Even more than the operator not specking Chinese, this is what makes the Chinese Room not conscious.  It is also what makes it completely inapplicable to the field of AI.    Now let's suppose that you add working memory into the Chinese Room and Turing Test the Chinese Room again.  Now you ask the room, ""What's your favorite color?""  How does the room decide?  Do the instructions in the book tell the operator to fill in the blank with a random work from Column 473?  If so, what happens when my next question is, ""Why?""  But here's something interesting:  What if the way the book tells the reviewer, ""fill in Word 1 if your favorite color is Red, fill in Word 2 if your favorite color is blue"".  What if it does this with all statements of preference?  Certainly this is the only way I can think of to actually pass any sufficiently rigorous version of the Turing Test.  Otherwise you're going to realize you're dealing with a chat bot.  So what's happened?  The book in the room has turned into an extremely roundabout Google Translate, and the Chinese Room is the operator.    Otherwise the Room as a system cannot pass a rigorous Turing Test."

BACTERIA/VIRUSES ARE WET NANO! And we do have the technology to create them to our designs, alter them, and kill them. Diabetius is pretty cheap to treat nowadays thanks to genetically engineerd bacteria that eat sugar and shit out Insulin.   Currently and in the foreseeable future, we will be stuck in the wet-nano phase, its immensely more easy to work withhin an existing system, where you can just copy literally billions of years of evolution to get results; and we have been studying that since at the discovery of the double helix in 1953. The first 50 years have been laying the groundwork for the incredibly rapid success and improvement we have seen since 200.   prices for genome sequencing are in free fall, orders of magnitudes faster than moores law, and we have seen an standartisation of genetic engineering. We are at the beginning of a phase of everyday use of genetically enigeered organisms, its already reached some aspects of life (medical, industrial, and food.)   E.g. One potential application I have seen flung around by SF author Bruce Sterling in his excellent short story ""bycycle repair man"" is  bacterial deodorants. Instead of preventing sweat, we seed our armpits with benign bacteria. They overtakethe standard bacteria; while both eat our sweat, the natural ones produces stinky odors from it. The new ones instead produce pleasant odors from it, eg. flowery or fruity smell.   Whats the estimate on hard nano?  as we had   a) We do not have the same incentive to find out how hard nano works as we had with figuring out our own biology.  b) we are only now currently laying groundwork for it; if we have a look at wet nano its at least 50 years until we see an explosion in breaktroughs and rapid exponential progress that will lead to widespread use.  c) We do not have any inspirations or already working designs as we had with wet nano, which probably adds a couple of decades.    Note that your special problem can be overcome with wet nano, retrovirus that modify your DNA etc. There is a very good timeline for that right now, and we already had first human trials (that still ended in cancer for the patients.). So if you make it 20-30 years, you have a very good chance to see fundamental treatment for Muscular Dystrophy.

There are actually a few different types of ""quickcharging"" stations, and I don't think other electric cars can use Tesla superchargers (although I believe you can get an adapter to charge a Tesla at a CHAdeMO quickcharging station).

Elon has said he would actually like to share the supercharger stations, however the main barrier to universal adoption by other EVs is whether or not other vehicles can accept the power level that a Supercharger delivers. As of right now, no other electric car can handle charging rates even close to the power that the supercharger delivers. Teslas UK superchargers use a different connector than in the US and will probably fit some other types of EVs, however the power the supercharger delivers isn't compatible right now with those other vehicles."

Burning Hydrogen in an ICE is just ridiculous, hydrogen is hard to store and with the inefficiencies of an ICE you don't get any real benefits.  Hydrogen fuel cells are less ridiculous, but they are still quite expensive, depend upon infrastructure that doesn't exist yet, and are much less efficient than batteries."
Futurology,3dtw6r,willyolio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:13:10 2015 UTC,"hydrogen is just a bad version of both ICE and batteries.  hydrogen itself is a battery: you can't mine for hydrogen.  you have to spend electricity to create it, then convert it back to electricity.  Net result is you'll only get maybe 25-30% of the electricity you started with if you'd just used it to charge a battery directly.  Total cost would, therefore, be 3-4x electric charging price, not counting markup and profit from the hydrogen conversion companies and pumping stations.  hydrogen in ICE is even less efficient.  On top of that, hydrogen is hard to store.  With extremely high-pressure hydrogen tanks, you might get 200 miles with a fuel cell.  you might be lucky getting 100 miles burning it.  hydrogen fuel cell cars use exactly the same components as a battery electric car - plus a few additional expensive parts, like a platinum fuel cell membrane, hydrogen storage tanks.  More parts, especially moving parts = more things that can go wrong and need servicing.  currently, hydrogen is almost on par with gasoline on a per-mile price (which is much higher than pure electric, by the way)... but that's because we currently get hydrogen from oil.  So those prices and that source of hydrogen are obviously no solution at all to oil dependency."

We have a long tradition of grandfathering in old cars to new rules. Even something as clearly as important as seabelts has allowed cars to be grandfathered in. You can still drive a model T with no seat belts on the highway if you really want to. We also aren't too keen on the government banning things we like or want to do.  I personally think you will be able to continue purchasing street legal manual drive cars for ever. You will just see some lanes reserved for auto-drive only cars, just as we have lane restrictions for favored configurations to day. If a ban was to happen, it would be at most a ban on new manual drive cars, with the anticipation that over 10-20 years the old cars would die, and the traffic would become increasingly auto-drive. But then in that scenario, your old manual drive car may become a valuable item to those who want a grandfathered vehicle."
Futurology,3dv4t4,monty845,5,Sun Jul 19 20:30:43 2015 UTC,"At some point many manual drivers may be limited by regulation, economics and shame (but this will take a while to fully eliminate in most places - 10-25 years? after the first SDCs are on the road)   regulation: As licensed drivers decrease, regulations on licensing will be increased. Many drivers may not be able to obtain a license, and may not want to go through the process (i.e. CDL type licensing) economics: As more manufacturers start building only autonomous vehicles, the ability to purchase a manual vehicle will be limited to niche manufacturers. These are normally more expensive due to economies of scale. Also as manual drivers will be a higher insurance risk, they will have to take on a higher monthly cost. Fines for driving infractions will also be higher.  shame: as the statistics roll out that SDCs are far safer then manual driven vehicles, the remaining drivers may be shamed (or scared) out of continuing to drive. When you start seeing the story of a manual driver that ran a red light, or caused a fatal accident, where an SDC would have prevented it, people will realize it is probably not safe for them to drive anymore."
Futurology,3dv4t4,monkey_fish,5,Sun Jul 19 22:25:12 2015 UTC,"The risk of manual driving wont increase beyond what it is today, and will actually be quite lower, due to fewer other manual drivers to hit you, and self driving cars being good at compensating for any mistakes you make. Now its true the insurance risk pool will shrink, which would create an upward pressure, but I predict the risk decrease will have a bigger impact. It will just seem like a lot given the tiny price for insuring cars without manual controls.  As for manufacturing, first there will be a huge supply of used manual cars, as many will want to at least have the option to turn on auto-pilot when desired. Second, while the smaller market will have some impact on price from the reduced economy of scale, it would need to shrink a huge amount before this becomes a big factor, particularly as some manufactures will likely offer manual and self driving models of the same car, so your only loosing the economy of scale for the manual control stuff.  Regulation could have an impact, but the larger impact will just be younger generations never bothering to get a license. Eventually the older manual drivers will largely die off, and manual driving with them, assuming of course that clinical immortality doesn't arrive soon enough to save most."

Most people don't like that attention (although a few do).

Futurology,3dv4t4,smoke_and_spark,5,Sun Jul 19 21:23:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you you realise how self driving cars work.   Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage. By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position even when conditions change or when they enter uncharted environments."
Futurology,3dv4t4,tatch,4,Sun Jul 19 22:07:16 2015 UTC,"and yes, the Velodyne lidar. That doesn't read the stop signs though.  The leading innovator of these cars right now seems to be google, so lets look at their car. In order for them to navigate, they rely on 3 dimensional maps of where ever they are going. They are maps of the streets, street lights , stop signs, driveways, lane markings..ect that as of now the radars and gps do not navigate.   Cars are dedicated to creating these maps. They drive around Mountain View and map out these roads. The data gets downloaded and every part of them gets scanned by computers and humans to make sure every inch the car is going to go wont run into problems (though they still do). These self-driving cars cannot go anywhere without these downloaded maps btw.  So, in order for these cars to be able to operate throughout the country, we'd need to map 5 million miles of public roads like this. The 700k miles google has run their self-driving cars? All done on a few hundred miles that they have very painstakingly mapped. I don't mean googlemap or google earth or whatnot. These few hundred miles they have mapped has taken a LOT of work.  Now, take into account a stop sign recently added? A utility or whoever plants stop signs has to call google, and google would have to send out a mapping car to map that stop sign. This would be done every day as crosswalks and other changes in roadways happen all of the time. One missed light or stop sign could cause a lot of accidents if a lot of people were driving these things.  That is just ONE problem with this google car. They also can't tell the difference between a crumbled news paper and a large rock and can'teven read a traffic light if the sun is in the wrong place.   I am all for these autonomous cars being developed, but there are some very large hurdles that they need to get around. The most daunting at the moment seems to be the mapping out of our public roads which is extremely costly and even more time consuming and very often subject to change.   Edit: Spelling and such."
Futurology,3dv4t4,smoke_and_spark,2,Sun Jul 19 22:19:29 2015 UTC,"I think you're being a bit overly pessimistic.  Google wouldn't be continuing to invest in the idea if they didn't think they could bring something great to market in the next 5 years.  Phoning up google to report every sign change obviously isn't what they have in mind.  If they have a fleet of cars on the street, they'll get continuous mapping data to stay updated on road changes.  I understand the cars can already recognise new stop signs and report them back to Google.  They appear to have been focusing on de-risking the most important aspects first.  That is, avoiding collisions with other cars, pedestrians, cyclists and other objects to keep everyone safe.  So even if it misses a sign/signal, it will slow down to avoid a collision, with better awareness than a human driver.  It needs those abilities since other drivers won't always obey signs anyway."

I don't think BMW and Volvo and Toyota will be allowed their own autonomous driving technologies.  Perhaps they could be individually certified by some new agency, but even then you're allowing different versions of the tech on the road.  I think the software will have standards at least as stringent and comprehensive as current vehicle manufacturing and safety standards.  If you buy a self driving car and then in three years there are radical improvements to the tech, do we allow the older, poorer performing vehicles on the road?  And if it is possible with the old hardware, what about software upgrades?  It's one thing if I don't install the latest iOS on my phone, but another thing entirely for cars travelling 60+mph on public roadways.    I also think once the tech is standardized, due to the many issues you describe in your post and the many limitations of machine vision in the context of such varied conditions encountered on roadways, it's likely cars will be linked to some central transportation network/grid that handles all the mapping and GPS data on which cars rely, and tracks/guides them in real time.

What will probably occur is google will go into a city, and have a bunch of streetview human driven vehicles map the entire city - they may start at a central point and spiral out from there. At that point they can release the SDCs which will only go to locations that have been mapped. These SDCs will then continuously map as they are driving around to continuously update the mapping system. It really won't take long."

Yes, the streets are changing all the time, but how often. If you have a bunch of SDCs continually mapping roads, when one finds an anomaly (i.e. something changed that it cannot interpret), it can pull over, get remote assistance if necessary, and inform all other vehicles to avoid this location until it can be traversed. The data can then be uploaded and solved - which then can be deployed to all the vehicles.   As for the police officer, yeah that might be a difficult issue, but it is being worked on. This ted talk from the google SDC director Chris Urmson shows some of this @ 10 minutes in.  http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_urmson_how_a_driverless_car_sees_the_road?language=en#t-591568 (the entire video is great though).  Eventually once there is a tipping point of SDCs on the road, I could easily see other technology being deployed to assist in SDC road management.  For example:   obviously V2V and I2V electronic batons for officers (or even controlling lanes via a tablet type device). As I see it, cops are only used to direct traffic during an accident, a traffic light outage, or a large event (and maybe a few other cases). Building more automation into the infrastructure would assist with this. required uploading of construction locations to centralized systems, so they can manually be mapped or avoided.  electronic markers at construction sites that inform the SDC of route changes."

Futurology,3dv4t4,sprawn,13,Sun Jul 19 20:13:42 2015 UTC,"I mean it's going to be a much bigger revolution than most people think it is going to be. People aren't really thinking about all the implications. People tend to think things will be the same only now the car will be driving itself. But, it really changes everything. The implications are vast.  For instance, pick a common car oriented task that a typical person does on a typical evening. Say... driving to a store to pick up a bag of pet food. In the modern system, a person leaves their house, gets in their car, drives to the store (in their modern car), goes into the store, gets their pet food, leaves the store, comes home and takes the pet food inside and feeds their grateful kitty.  What has changed? What has transpired? Two things. The person has spent some money. Pet food has gone from the store to the person's home. All that must happen is an electronic transaction (the infrastructure for which we already have in place) and the transport of the bag from some central location to the person's house.  With autonomous transport, you could conceivably just send your car to get the food. But it soon becomes obvious that that is a huge waste. A much, much smaller vehicle can be sent from the store (or warehouse, ultimately) directly to your house. These autonomous cargo transporters will vary greatly in size. They will be rolling locked boxes that you unlock with your ID or a password, something like that.  Right now, a good car gets 50 mpg. So, people are spending billions to do tasks like this. These autonomous ""last mile"" transporters will get more like 1000 mpg. It's a little hard to calculate. They will be electric.  And that's just one change. The implications of that change are astounding."

In the modern system a human, with a vehicle designed with human piloting and safety in mind is used at every step of the path. Take out the human and you are removing a lot of stuff.  No need for airbags and crumple zones. No need for air conditioning. No need for a radio. No need for scheduling. No need for health care, etc, etc, etc... The list goes on an on.  These things will be smaller. Much, much smaller, and much, much lighter than cars. Think of a modular, multi unit shopping cart that is self-guided.  You get rid of the need for stores. No need to have an open, airy, well-lit, air-conditioned, staffed, store with lighting and parking and a million other things that we have built up because the presumption is that humans will be driving there, walking through, and leaving. In the new system, it's a robotic warehouse with precise, unlit aisles. No need for ac, except in parts where the products need temp control.  With autonomous transport... Goodbye big rigs. Goodbye CB radio. Goodbye Smokey and the Bandit.  We could get rid of truck drivers tomorrow if we wanted to...

Futurology,3dv4t4,monty845,4,Sun Jul 19 19:49:25 2015 UTC,"I'd say early adopters will start having full auto-drive available for high end models in 3-4 years, with availability arriving for non-highend models maybe 2 years later.  But those are all going to by hybrids with manual controls and basically autopilot mode. Consumers will start seeing auto-drive only, with no manual controls, in maybe 10 years, but with many manual offerings still in the market."
Futurology,3dv4t4,kalabash,4,Sun Jul 19 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"They would have to offer manual-drive cars. There are still countless uses for such applications, even if we stay away from more obvious uses like emergency services and military uses. People still like to hunt and camp and explore out in back roads, to say nothing of making their own roads. Nature preserves need to be crossed. Wreckers need to be positioned. The market will definitely become saturated at some point with driverless cars, but I think we're a far cry from that being the only option. I personally would be vary wary of purchasing car that doesn't allow the option to switch off the auto. Vehicles are still way too useful when handled by a human to allow that."
Futurology,3dv4t4,monty845,4,Sun Jul 19 20:45:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but to play devils advocate, there are more nuanced options that could cover some of those. We often think of 3 modes of control, full manual, full auto, and a manual/auto toggle. But you could also have a care that is ostensibly manual, with an automatic override to protect against some events. So you could drive offroad where the AI wouldn't know what to do, but if you try to speed on a highway, or were failing to stop for traffic, or in danger of hitting a pedestrian, it could step in and block your dangerous action.  But as long as the car AI can decide not to obey you, its not really a full manual car. And I certainly wont want it. I want to be able to make the final decision about what the car does. If there is a criminal in the road way blocking my path with the intent to rob me, I should be able to decide not to stop or to drive into the person. If I need to rush a family member to the hospital to save their life, I don't want a car that can decide its too dangerous outside because the state declared a state of emergency, and have it refuse to budge."
Futurology,3dv4t4,monkey_fish,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:58:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those emergency situations are a very interesting edge case.   As for the emergency hospital ride, I could see an emergency button being required on each vehicle to direct route to the closest hospital. All local SDCs would be made aware, and even traffic lights could be automatically updated to give priority to the ""temporary"" emergency vehicle. If you use it outside an emergency, you would get a fine. It could probably even faster then a direct ambulance pickup in many circumstances.  This last point could be hugely important in rural environments - imagine two people on a farm. One has a heart attack. Instead of your first impulse to call 911, you place the injured person in the SDC. You hit the emergency button, and it starts driving to the hospital, connects you to 911, and dispatches an ambulance to the optimal meet location. The 911 operator starts walking you through basic steps to provide CPR or other care. You either meet the ambulance and they can take over with better medical care, or you arrive at the emergency room.   I haven't really thought about a solution to the highway bandit, but that is pretty rare in general, although if the SDCs don't figure out a solution, the rate of occurrence might increase.   A few thoughts:   have the SDC avoid locations where this occurs regularly. Immediately send assailant data to the police - height, voice, clothing, picture (though they would be wearing masks when robbing an SDC due to video data). Police can be locally deployed in these areas and hopefully quickly respond. Police can also be stationed to make certain areas more accessible for secure SDC pick-up/drop-off locations in these regions. fully tinted windows so the assailant doesn't know if there are occupants. emergency escape button. If someone is blocking the road in front of you, have the vehicle as safely as possible exit the situation. It will be able to rapidly reverse down the road notifying other vehicles of an emergency issue. Yeah - if you're blocked on all sides, I'm not sure. I guess you could have some login system that allows you to override safety features and run over a person. I'm just not sure how many documents you would have to sign to implement this, and you would probably need bullet proof glass at that point. Hopefully, we can just transition many of our soon-to-be unnecessary traffic cops to the locations where this is likely to be an issue. Crime is really not bad these days, and I see it reducing a bunch over time."

That's still going to be very much in the ""early adapter"" phase, though.

Futurology,3dv4t4,EpigenHealth,3,Mon Jul 20 00:00:15 2015 UTC,"The leases are coming due on the 2011-2013 Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt models.  This means that there will be a lot of used, low mileage (10k-30k) electric vehicles coming on the market.    This may be great for buyers because there isn't much of an existing market for all of the incoming used electric vehicles. There is a lot of market hesitance (both buyers and sellers), largely because of unfamiliarity with electric vehicles generally.  Given that the vehicle is purchased through a dealer, and carries forward the pertinent warranties, I think this could be a really good time to get a good deal on an electric vehicle.    Nissan Leaf is going for $10k-$15k.  As for whether or not it is a smart time to buy a car at all, given the looming electric and automated vehicle revolution?   I think five years is a fair estimate for electric vehicles to be maybe 25% of new vehicle sales, and about the same time I'd expect a 98% autonomous vehicle to be hitting the market.  At this point, you have to ask yourself if you want to be an early adopter, because it'll cost you.  If you don't have $75k to drop on a new autonomous tesla, you'll have to wait 3-5 years more to buy one used.  All said, I think that unless you plan to spend big money as soon as the tech comes out, you're looking at 8-10 years before it will be in your price range.

This is particularly important for an ageing population with slower reflexes and poor eyesight. So the current 7 Series can park itself in a (known) garage, a problem of light-to-dark transition for many people with latent cataracts, who tend to sit in the middle of the 7 demographics.   The main app for SD in the next ten years over and above what I have just written will be public/corporate ownership vehicles for use in urban centres and long distance and micro-freight: the SD fork lift.

They use the existing knowledge to do what they can, but they aren't incentivized to do the kind of pure research you need to solve the fundamental problems that confront them.   Instead, scientists do this work and are then bought out by companies like Google and Facebook for the innovations they made while in academia.  So scientists in academia are a few steps ahead of the cutting-edge because they are the most familiar with the literature and what is going on.

But if automated cars are going to be available in 5 years (ish), then buying a new car would be a bad investment.  So I chose to lease a new car for 3 years. I'm quite happy with the decision. I'll see what happens in 3 years, and make another decision then. Lease/trade in for another 3 years (most likely), or leap to automated taxis (if they're readily available)."

You live in sunny, sprawling LA so you need a way to get around without lead time like ordering an Uber everytime.  And they don't operate all the time/everywhere.

No.  Do I think there will be more affordable/abundant ride sharing programs in the same time?  Yes and no.  I think that industry will have growing pains until they have their own ubiquitous self-driving fleet.  Most importantly: Do I think all cars on the road today are doomed to obsolescence like ipods or last years' laptop?  Big no.  Cars are different from other consumer products in that they are easily modifiable.  If someone out there is not already doing so, I believe a kit will be made available to many car models that would effectively make it a self-driving car. Did Google start by going out and build a car from chassis on up?  Of course not, they used a Toyota Prius and built tech on top of it.  The same tech could be rolled out for similar cars very soon. In fact that kind of car modifying might be a good business model....  In Conclusion, if I were you, where you are and what your owner status is, I would be looking to buy specific used cars in the 1-2 year range.  You should be on the lookout for used Toyota Prius or Nissan Leaf or similar models of car.    And if you are in a position, making a self-driving car attachment would be an interesting project."

Leasing may have been a better option if I didn't have to drive for work so much. Make sure it's a car you really like and will enjoy driving. If it costs a little extra it may be worth it.

Futurology,3dv4t4,LimerickExplorer,2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:16 2015 UTC,"I believe buying brand new is a not great investment right now. Not horrible, but generally a bad idea. If industry experts are correct we will have self-driving cars in 2020. If they're slow, 2025.   Keep in mind that the ""adoption rates"" for SDCs (and banning of humans drivers) we often talk about have to be considered in a different light here when we're considering resale value. Usually we talk about adoption rate changing the practicality of driving - eg, 90% of cars are driven by people vs 10% SDC. For the value of your car dropping, we have to look at it differently.  For clarity, lets say  Adoption Rate: the amount of self-driving cars on the road vs the amount of non self-driving cars    vs  Purchase Rate: the number of self-driving cars that are traded / purchased vs the amount of non self-driving cars being purchased.   For you, we have to consider the purchase rate (% of purchased cars) of non SDCs once self-driving cars are unleashed. Even if there's a slow ""adoption rate"", eg full switch over of ditching non SDCs, it's still possible you will see a drop in purchase rate of non-self-driven cars by as much as 20-30% once SDCs become available. That might not seem like a monstrously huge number, but if you consider that potentially 30% less people are interested in buying your used car, the supply vs demand chain / balance gets absolutely WRECKED by a number as high as 20 or 30% - the resale value of cars will plummet, and even more so once people see it's hard to sell a car, and the interest in owning one will shift because of it.

Neural networks have become very good at object classification in images thanks to huge labelled data-sets. But how do you move from just labeling objects, to captioning the images?  Here is how you do it:   Get a huge database of captioned images. Take a new unknown image and find its nearest neighbor in the captioned dataset. Copy that nearest neighbor's caption.   You don't even need to modify the caption, you just copy it from the labeled data. Why does this work? Because humans are pretty boring and almost any picture that has been taken, has already been taken and captioned. Only in very rare instances will this not work, which means you can get incredibly high performance by just finding an image that looks like the one you have and copying its caption.  *There are various distance measures that you could use for finding the nearest neighbor, so just pick one that is computationally efficient."

Well we're not out to make AI according to some moral compass of only doing things the slow, long, hard way, we're out to make AI full stop. So we use a shortcut to do the job a bit quicker, and so long as we aren't sacrificing performance, that's just fine. In fact, I personally find that to be a bit better than doing it the human way, or the hard way, simply because it means we've found an ostensibly ""better"" method!  Also what you're basically saying is that there's no point in using a training database to get something up to speed, and then setting it loose on actual data. I hate to break it to you, but that is the way that every single thing ever has worked. You try it out first, gain some experience, and then convert everything else using that method. They'll train AI up on a couple hundred thousand images, and then set it loose on the billions of images that exist. For the low, low price of hand-captioning a few hundred thousand images, you'll get the ability to caption and context every other image in existence for free.

Futurology,3dqmoc,clove7,15,Sat Jul 18 16:21:37 2015 UTC,"It's expensive for a reason. The manufacturing supply chain, from minerals to base components to parts to a product and then the whole mess of shipping, with added costs for new infrastructures... that's just a massive, multi-billion dollar, decades long investment. Companies manufacturing cars based on combustible engines have a century of a head start, and that doesn't even include the ""small"" prices like developing new tech, research, smoothing out the legal aspects, and salaries.  The main reason the prices are high is that there is a massive overhead of building that from scratch. Tesla has been working on it, (the gigafactory being a prime example), and until they can recoup the costs at a low percent of costs due to massive sales, they are forced to sell at price ranges where the margin of profit is higher. They've been working their way through building that manufacturing backbone for a decade now, but that's still not where they need to be."

The $40-$50K Model E will come out around 2018 if I remember correctly. New Roadster in 2020, roughly. The $20,000 model, which still hasn't even been announced by Tesla, probably won't be on the market in any appreciably quantity until halfway through the 20's.   We're talking about 10 years here, and considering that self-driving cars are already a reality (on the market you already have cars like the Mercedes S class that can drive itself on the highway without any help from the driver, and you have companies like Google (and likely Uber and Apple as well) working on city driving technology.  Self driving cars will be available en mass before you know it.  But of course they will be expensive, so how will anyone pay for them? Well the obvious answer is they won't. Instead companies like Uber will own fleets of these vehicles and people will just rent them whenever they need to get somewhere.  This is the future of transportation. Electric, self-driving fleets of rentable vehicles."
Futurology,3dqmoc,ronsta,2,Sun Jul 19 05:47:25 2015 UTC,"It's funny, as soon as I wrote my response, I went to the ""Uber CEO to Tesla"" thread and started reading the comments.   Your comment makes a lot of sense- given that the next automobile revolution (self-driving cars) is already here and seems to be progressing very quickly, it might not even matter that most people can't/ won't be able to afford electric vehicles. Like you said, we'll probably be renting them from companies that actually own them.  Given this is the case, a big issue to me (as someone who's lived for a long time in North America) is the practicality of not owning a car. I live near Toronto and used to live near New York City, and the transportation infrastructure/ modes of transportation (i.e. public transit) are so poor that I feel like self-driving cars are way ahead of other aspects of transportation. Lots of people drive to work, mostly because it's the only practical solution they have to the transit problem. I wonder how the finances of renting transportation will work out. Netflix is a form of renting that most of us don't think twice about because of it's relatively small cost- what's going to happen with transportation?"

Once there are literally thousands of self-driving cars available as a taxi service, they will do much more than simply picking up and dropping off humans. People will be able to host meetings in them; they can courier packages between locations; they can pick up groceries; deliver restaurant food. I expect if Google is leaving the revolution with it's self-driving cars, they will also be subsidized by a form of advertising. Imagine as you're being driven around in one of these cars, you look out the window and off in the distance you see Dunkin Donuts. They have to pay for that ad, just like you need to pay for the service. I can imagine it will be much more affordable than taxi service, or renting a car."

Tesla was 2 days away from bankruptcy in 2008 before it received additional outside funding (and rumored to have been within a few weeks of it again in 2013).

Anti-depressants aren't whispering in depressed people's ear that they should just go end it.  They actually improve a person's condition to the point where they feel just good enough to go through with something that they were (paradoxical as it may seem) too depressed to muster the energy for before the medication.    People use the correlation of increased suicide in the first months of anti-depressants to state that they are terrible and should never be taken.  Really, though, when we are dealing with something as major as this, you should be under the care of a professional, and if possible, the watchful eye of a loved one.    It is true that they do not work for everyone and that the side effects can suck, badly, but suicide is an extremely complex issue that cannot be pinned to any one factor.

A very cynical thought perhaps. But would you rather be happy and work like a dog possibly dying young or be sad but have more freedom.  Truth is, this sort of compounds are doubtlessly a great thing in our current civilization and hopefully won't be that necessary in a couple of decades, it just becomes a problem if more than half of the population start to take it and the entity forcing labor (directly or indirectly, like through a monetary system) are heavily linked to the entity providing the ""happiness pill""."

So saying it's ""just a neurotransmitter"" is saying ""it's just brain stuff"".  Well of course it is.  And further, symptoms are indicators of a disease but do not mistake them for the disease. Depression is not a set of symptoms any more than The flu is a fever.   Depression is a pattern of neurotrasmitter depletion and transmission failure which causes the symptom - being depressed.  While it almost certainly will never be possible to make one pill which could remedy the entire constellation of neurotransmitter abnormalities (we've got several dozen known neurotransmitters and counting) that go into making a depressed person, we should be able to cure it someday because underneath any psychological phenomenon is a biochemical cause.

One neuron cannot interact with another without NTs.  You can't have a thought without NTs.  A neuron (in the brain, sensory and motor neurons can be a bit different) without neurotransmitters which cross the synaptic gap to talk to the next neuron, and which does not recieve neurotransmitters from the neurons before it in the circuit is alone in the world, all by itself.  It can fire and nobody else will hear it.  Its ""friends"" can fire and it will not hear them.  It's essentially cut off from the body.  The only way it would have of influencing the world around it would be to modify NA+ K+ or cl- in the interstices by firing or not firing, which doesn't communicate information.  It could be that something causes neurotransmitter abnormalities which in turn causes depression, but the case that ""we can't know if neurotransmitter abnormalities cause depression"" well, yes, we can absolutely say that in the same way that we can say ""a problem with a computer program comes down to switches, or ones and zeroes""."

Additionally, anhedonia spans more than just unipolar depression, so we may see movements for several more specific drugs to treat your specific symptoms, rather than altering an entire neuromodulator system.   Also in the study, the drug acts only on GABA receptors expressed in a few brain areas that are key to depression, so the authors suggest it should be far more selective in action than you are characterizing, with fewer side effects than, say, altering serotonin and not epinephrine signaling throughout the body."

Futurology,3dsr26,battleforhealth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:08:41 2015 UTC,"Always had an interest in that, today there's two institutional depression cures.  You could go to a psychologist and try to work it out with him. This doesn't have a particularly high success rate, but it does work for some people. Or you could go to a psychiatrist. I disagree with the featured researcher on this one, give someone SSRIs or amphetamines and you will most definitely see improvements, and you can always up the dose. The problem with this one is fairly obvious, you can always pump up neurotransmitters, but your brain downregulates and there is no guarantee you'll come out of it any better (maybe that's what he referred to for the 50% figure though, but it wouldn't be fair because SSRIs are still valid in cases of emergency).  Then there are other means, of course you could be your own psychologist, time mends all wound and all that. But then there's this other idea which is being looked out from time to time but never really gain any serious weight, and I think this compound could be somehow related to it. There are numerous reports of people taking hallucinogenics on the internet, most of them are uninteresting from an academia standpoint, but then there's DMT. Researchers found out some while ago that DMT is produced in different places in our body. Reports of DMT use very frequently document a feeling of long lasting intense joy once effect wears off (the actual ""high"" during 10 minutes but being described as seemingly lasting for months or years), not euphoria or even happiness but rather an absolute worrylessness. Stunningly, they also feel a slight dissociation from the world, like it doesn't really make sense, like it's all a farce, a game everyone is playing without being aware of it. Of course what you realize happened is that they somehow got stripped of their ego. This means no greed, no jealousy, no anger, no identification with your car, your house, any of your belongings or social class. Of course this sounds like a very appealing prospect to me, so I might be biased towards how effective this drug might be.  This is astonishingly similar to what Buddhists and partisans of similar philosophies call ""enlightenment"" and aim to hopefully achieve within their lifetime (correct me if I'm wrong, I only have a limited knowledge regarding this). Of course DMT also comes with bad experiences with lasting negative mental side effects (which may or may not be attributed to purity, dosage, mindset and proper use), so it might be inappropriate for the general public, but if that's the direction this research is taking (which it might not, they mention similarities to ketamine, but it's all a bit vague) then I'm sure good might come of it."

This of course doesn't mean we're not being simulated.  The potential space of hypothetical simulators is vast, and the Simulation Argument only really deals with simulators which are effectively human.  In the wider case, we'd know almost nothing about them.  Their laws of physics could be almost anything so long as it allows for the simulation of our own physics.  For instance, even if it turns out that you can't simulate ""consciousness"" (whatever that is) under our laws of physics, their laws of physics could be looser.    Getting back to Bostrom's argument, another natural point at which to stop an ancestor simulation is when they reach a specified historical point, such as the historical point at which their own culture developed data recording techniques at a point where they no longer needed to extrapolate what was going on in their ancestors heads.  Hopefully they'd be ethical enough that, once they've created ""best guess"" simulations for what their ancestors were like they don't just shut off the program but instead let their ancestors participate in their culture as more or less equals.

The brain doesn't fully mature until the early twenties and twelve-year old brains often have trouble with handling complexer information.   There's a lot of things that could be done to improve education, but shortening it probably isn't the first one we should be looking at.   Information is a lot easier to access now, facilitating autodidactism.   While this is true, not everyone learns easily on their own. In fact, there's probably a very small subset of people that can do it effectively. I do think there's something to be said for having children (from a young age) have a lot more say in the subjects they tackle at school and guiding them through the material while they tackle a good chunk of it on their own might work.    At which point should robots start having the same rights as humans?   First of all, the Three Laws of Robotics are rubbish in the real world and they don't even work properly in their fictional universes.   I'm naively in favor of equal rights for all sapients, but this doesn't really work in practice. It's currently not practically feasible to expand human rights to primates, dolphins, elephants and octopuses. Not only wouldn't they be able to enjoy some of the rights we grant humans, we couldn't explain the rights that might be useful for them.  For AI and robots, this becomes even more complicated. Currently, every (human) person in a democracy has a vote. This works pretty well for humans, but now introduce an AI in the system. You say they're a person and should be able to vote. The AI quickly creates a few million copies of themselves (with slight changes if needed) and can now push through every legislation it might want.   So I'm not sure if equal rights for robots even makes sense.   Can the penitentiary system be changed in a way that prisoners fully repay their damages in a lifetime?   There are damages that can never be repaid. How would you try a war criminal? Hell, even in your example, how are you going to put a monetary cost on the lives of 32 children? Do you think their parents are going to be happy to hear: ""Well, we ran some numbers and decided your kid was basically worth about 5 million dollars.""  Not only that, but our legal system(s) aren't purely about repaying for damages, they're also a way to channel punitive desires in order to prevent them from becoming violent. If the legal system can't channel those desires, people are going to enact their own justice and mob justice has never been a good idea.  Your suggestion has other problems, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It says you can't force people to perform labor. This is why my country, Belgium, offers a working sentence, but only if it's backed up by a monetary or prison sentence.   A system I quite like, but has never been tried out seriously when dealing with adult offenders is reintegrative justice. In this system, both offenders and victims (guided by a neutral facilitator) come to a common solution. This can be monetary repayment, the offender helping the victim in other ways, prison sentences, some sort of public statement or other commitments. This has proven to work pretty well at small scale and research done with it shows that it improves satisfaction of the victim(s), makes the offender feel more responsible and restores belief in society for both the victim and offender."

I have a BS in Psychology, many of my classes focused on Developmental Psychology. Although there are some individuals that can complete high school at an early age, the majority of the population's brain is not fully developed at 12 years, therefore many of the people are unable to learn certain concepts at an early age. For example, most 9 year olds will not be able to comprehend ( Solve for X where X+4=9 ) because the concept of a variable is beyond their comprehension. But this becomes very easy to understand by the time most people become 12. Our current education system, although it has many problems, it should supposedly teach certain concepts at the most optimal time to learn them."

So you do not need to own your own, just a share of the car pool.  Like uber... but without drivers.  the cars would have much higher utilization to save money.

Futurology,3duff2,constantino2,6,Sun Jul 19 16:13:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the idea of self driving fleets has been discussed a bunch. Some will want to own their own vehicles, but others won't and it will all depend upon personal needs.    A family might want to own a vehicle since their kids can make a mess, and their car seats are already installed, but they may use a fleet service instead of getting a second vehicle.  A person living in the city where parking is hard to find and expensive may opt for only using an SDC fleet. A person in a more rural environment may own their own vehicle since the wait time for a SDC fleet vehicle may be too long. someone may be on the road a lot, and so their vehicle is their personal space and they may want to own that space.   I look at the parking lot in my complex and see how many vehicles are just sitting there taking up space. I could easily see a few fleet SDCs sitting in the parking lot ready to take someone as they walk out the door. The fleet vehicles would be distributed around the neighborhood, so you could pick up your phone, hit a button, and by the time you are curbside the vehicle is either ready, or less then a minute away from you."

As it is, you have the ability to request an Uber with a car seat, so I could see that being a service offered by these fleets you're speaking of. I think the rural component is much more difficult to resolve. It wouldn't make sense to station a fleet out in the sticks, considering the area they'd have to cover. Also, there is very little that can be done without a car in those locations, opposed to life in an urban center. Those people will still own vehicles."

Futurology,3duff2,sprawn,6,Sun Jul 19 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"No. They will not look the same. The thing that many people overlook is how completely unnecessary it is to transport people for most of the tasks for which people now use cars.  Products will be separated into those that are factory sealed and those that require inspection before purchase. For instance, a computer, pop-tarts, gum, a comb, beer, speaker wire, and prescription pills are all ""factory-sealed."" By this I mean you don't have to actually visually inspect them personally to ensure they are acceptable prior to purchase. For all these kinds of products there will be no need for you (or anyone) to go to a ""store"" to buy them. You can just order them and the ""store"" will send them to your residence. Given that only products will be being transported, the transportation device will not need to accommodate humans. This means they will be smaller, lighter, more efficient, and with far, far lower safety requirements. They will always yield to human occupied transporters in terms of safety.  When you take safety concerns out of the equation, it changes things massively as well. Autonomous transport that moves human cargo will not actually need to be anywhere near as safe as it is now. We will be able to lighten those transports by 1,000 pounds each. It will be radically different."
Futurology,3duff2,monkey_fish,3,Sun Jul 19 16:26:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah - there will be a variety of vehicles, and you will use these depending on your need.    single seaters for your commute 2 seaters for a date 4 seaters for a family transport vehicles as you indicated.    I think there will also be classes of vehicles based on speed in terms of safety. If I'm just going to go to the local grocery store, I'm going to get the lightweight vehicle since my speeds are not going to be much higher then 20-30 mph. If I'm taking a high-speed highway trip, I'm going to get the heavier vehicle that has more safety features, since random things can happen. At high speeds there may not be much an SDC can do, so passive safety will remain important."

Assuming it was still a road vehicle of some sort, an automated package transport of this nature could be much lighter and smaller, combined with leaving out many safety systems required for living passengers. A package delivery bot would not need air bags, or seat belts, or seats, or nearly as many crumple zones, etc. They'd likely not want to make it entirely absent of safety features that could help protect other individuals on the road, but they definitely wouldn't be limited to conventional shapes & sizes."

Many people with older cars usually have them out of necessity, if you provide them with a viable alternative that costs significantly less and is available 24/7 I think it may shift the market quite quickly. The thought of never having to pay for insurance, gas, maintenance, registration, and a home or space for parking would be very appealing for many middle class and poor families, of course convenience, safety and availability would need to  be the same or better than their current situation.   I think it's difficult to look at the taxi-services in such a way right now because human-driven taxis can often be a pain in the ass.

Futurology,3dsb22,runewell,3,Sun Jul 19 09:58:02 2015 UTC,If your taxi service idea is what ends up happening that's still only going to be in a few major cities within 10 years. anywhere that isn't a large city is going to be waiting a lot longer for a company to make an investment like that in their area.   For example I could see having almost all autonomous cars in NYC or LA drastically cutting commute times. The elimnation of traffic probably makes getting from one end of the city to the other a matter of minutes instead of hours.   Where I live my commute might go from 27 minutes to 23 minutes without traffic. So to run a service like that in my area the price of the cars and tech will have to be very low before the initial investment becomes worth it to a company.

Futurology,3dsb22,monkey_fish,3,Mon Jul 20 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"The original question was ""when can we assume that driverless is so prevalent that we can remove street lights?""  Could you be more specific on how you can see that happening in 10 years?  You have to wait for all the cars sold to be driverless (how much time happened between the first cruise control systems and all new cars having one ?). That itself could easily be 20 years, because you have to wait for the tech reaching price parity with non driverless vehicles. You might think that spending a few thousands $ on driverless is a good deal, but that will not be something everyone can afford. There could be incentives from government or insurances, but that will also take years to be effective.  A lot of people here are thinking that driverless will kill the individually owned cars, but people don't only use their cars to go from point A to point B with a couple of bags, think of all the stuff in the trunks, bed or back of vans, you will have to have massive incentive for people to give that up.  So in 20 years or so all vehicles sold are driverless, you then have to wait for all the humanly drived vehicle to be used and trashed, like the poster above said 11years is the median age.

I think the reason you're looking at space exploration as if it is some kind of entertainment or distraction, rather than something with utility or inherent value is because that is how it has to be ""marketed"" to get the public to finance it. Everything that is finally happening now is laying the foundation for mankinds future expansion into the rest of the solar system. We're mapping, measuring, practicing, and evaluating everything we can evaluate remotely. DARPA is designing microorganisms to terraform Mars and they don't do this kind of thing just for the hell of it. Planetary Resources is about to send up telescopes to map out where the most useful and profitable asteroids are and then they're going to send mining robots into the asteroid belt. There are plans for legitimate floating cloud cities on Venus and Bigelow Aerospace is already building housing for the Moon and Mars. We will expand into space when it is practical and justified by the need for resources and more living space, not for fun or for ""what if"" scenarios even if that contrived BS is what it takes to get it financed.  I can imagine a company easily financing a Venus cloud city or another offworld expedition by turning it into a reality TV show, but I hope they wouldn't take the risk of manufacturing drama the way they do for most reality TV shows."

Physics allows for the possibility but the technology required for dissassembly and reassembly is extremely advanced.  Information however is the base level of the concept.  It's far easier and achievable to send large data sets accross large swaths of time/space if we can master subspace/quantum signalling. All signs point to possible but a long way off.

Futurology,3dtguu,panem,5,Sun Jul 19 14:59:01 2015 UTC,"I think the problem goes beyond the 'one use only' limitation, because you need a conventional channel (e.g. light) to confirm anything you got is what you think it is.  Nevertheless, if we find a way to encode information in the entangled quantum states themselves, the one-use-only limitation won't really be a problem.  For example there is an idea for sending a continuous supply of entangled particles for ensuring continued FTL communication.  We would do that by placing a laser emitting satellite in the middle of both remote points, let's say right in the middle of space between Earth and Alpha Centauri, and then start sending entangled photons to origin and destination.  These entangled photons will take maybe years to get to their destination, but once there they could be trapped in a photon trap, and then you can use them for getting 'instantaneous' communication at both sides, by changing their quantum state and instantaneously affecting the entangled pair.   The photons themselves may not convey any communication whatsoever (maybe just a time stamp, telling when they were sent), the photon's quantum states would be the ones used to send the information.  http://www.seti.org.au/spacecom/quantumcom.html"

Social conflicts can also be risky, for a career, economy, personal life etc, in contrast to living in a highly physical environment like a sailboat where death is is real but highly unlikely. But unlike a man vs nature conflict, man vs man in a social, civilizational context offers many ways to muffle, decouple, or otherwise avoid feedback that has personal effects.  VR would push that to an extreme."
Futurology,3dtguu,aceogorion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:10:08 2015 UTC,"I'm saying people will always engage in reality and therefore exploration because death is the ultimate consequence. how does that translate to the efficacy of civilizations? Unless you're talking about the kind of social conflicts that can lead to death, in that case sure, but in that case as you alluded to VR removes that potential.  I think space exploration will always be a goal so long as man can find a way to engage with it because that exploration comes with the inherent potential consequence of death, which is always a draw for the right stuff.

That's the space race in a nutshell: a sleight of hand turned the two superpowers into competing against nature with engineering, instead of against each other with social signalling games and economic sabotage.  But space is boring as well as dangerous. VR offers the possibility of combined safety and excitement - it wins the market. People are forced to seek prestige through an economy whatever the environment, and VR pushes that economy away from entropy-countermeasures into tumblr.

Futurology,3dtguu,aceogorion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:45:48 2015 UTC,"By that logic you only get to fail once (then you’re dead). By definition, high risk efforts carry a good chance of failure (that’s why they’re high risk). There’s a continuum of risk; at one end the risk of failure is insignificant, at the other end it’s death. Maybe high risk individuals need to explore the upper part of the continuum but death gives no second chances or opportunities to learn from failure."
Futurology,3dtguu,boytjie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:45:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the lack of chances is what makes it so powerful. Again death isn't the goal, but it has to be a real potential end result. Without it, your just playing a game.  It doesn't mean that you want to die, but it has to be right there, a tangible and real possibility. It's not even about engaging in high risk per se, it's more about engaging in high consequence.  You train to reduce the risk, but the consequence is always there."
Futurology,3dtguu,aceogorion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:59 2015 UTC,"In high-risk endeavours, death is always a possibility. My argument is an escalation of consequences towards death (broken bones, maiming, etc.). Not a single chance, fail and you ‘re dead. No-one consciously partakes of a situation where the only outcome is a high probability of death. People take high-risk gambles that they can cheat death and there is usually an escalation of unpleasant consequences. You don’t do a high-wire walk between hot air balloons 4000ft AGL without a parachute. If you slip that’s certain death. You might do it with a parachute.

Especially when something is revolving at high speeds you need it to be as light as possible or even the smallest imbalance will tear it apart and the ship with it. I don't know what moment to weight ratio those magnets are, but they're bound to be lower than those of normal gears.  You can't just replace steel because you want to use some fancy magnets, more so when you want to use them in submarines. Steel remains the material that is the easiest to work with. Any carbon, or aluminium structures would be really hard to work with, especially when you have to make it thick to deal with the pressure of diving. They can be used for planes because the forces are relatively small, this is not the case several kilometers under the sea.  And finally, like you mentioned the expense. Military equipment is basically made to be damaged or destroyed. You won't put the costs of a Apollo program into a single sub, just for fancy gears.  If those gears don't magically manage to create some really good performance, they'll never be used with big machinery."

Futurology,3dsi1b,saiphir,60,Sun Jul 19 00:59:38 2015 UTC,"Deep breath. I have a lot to say, and I don't mean to come across as a dick or as a corporate shill. I'm a nuclear operator with ten years of experience in the field and have done a little research on the future of the field.  A lot of the reason we don't use Th reactors has to do with current generation being based on the 1950s designs. That much is true, and there was a concern with the possibility of using spent fuel as a weapon (not really viable, in the long run, but that's a different h subject altogether), and using breeder reactors to create weapons-grade fissile as well as reactor fuel.  Today, there are special reactors that use Th as their fuel. But the technology isn't quite there yet for a large-scale reactor to be built and used that will produce enough energy to replace U or Pl-fueled systems. These things take time.  Sure, back in the 50s, there was a lot of push to get Pl and U into reactors. We knew how those metals worked back then, and we knew how to create a reliable enrichment process, fuel cells, and control systems to make reliable reactors. We did not, however, know how to make a reliable, large-scale Th reactor (and really don't today, though there is a lot of research).  There is a large system in place with lots of control that goes into the enrichment and management of U and Pl fuel, from the moment it is mined to the time it's buried in Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming, or one of the dozens of other places outside the US that it goes. We haven't proven the viability of a Th reactor yet, so those processes aren't available. Just a quick lookup on wiki indicates that Th-232 is the isotope most common for Th, and this isotope is the one which is 4 times more common than uranium. The problem with Th-232 is that it is non-fissile. We can use this isotope to cause fission, but it must be enriched with a breeder reactor to cause it to become capable of a reliable fission reaction. What is this Th bred into? Fissile U-233. During the enrichment process (where they basically fire a ton of neutrons at the sample for a long time), the Th turns into U-232, which is highly reactive, releasing TONS of high energy gamma rays. To keep the operators of the plant safe, a lot of shielding must be in place. Gammas are uncharged particles, meaning they basically blast out in all directions, messing up anything they hit, especially people.  Beyond the logistics and lack of hard evidence, think about it in a business view. Is a company that has been designing reactors since the 50s (like Knolls, Bettis, or any of the other major contractors that the Navy works with), going to just step out of their comfort zone to test out a new thing without a guarantee of profit? Nah, probably not. They know exactly how to create a certain product, and they know how they can improve that product to make it safer, more effective, or cheaper. Launching a whole new field of study is super expensive, and doesn't guarantee in any way a return on their investment.  I don't know a lot about Th reactors (I'm trained in PWR systems, but also understand boiling-water plants like Fukushima), but I can't find anything relating to lower pressure systems being common in any situation that produces an outlet of power. Reactor plants don't just have nuclear reactions going on that make electricity. The fission in the reactor creates heat. In a pressurized water reactor, the water that touches the nuclear fuel can't boil, or the fuel can be damaged (bad day). The water is contained in closed loops and run through steam generators that are used to boil water to create steam and spin turbines. Huge turbines, which require literal tons of steam (if you could actually weigh it), meaning a metric asswhack of energy. Water does boil at 100C at atmospheric, so the more energy you want to put into it, the higher the pressure needs to be to keep the core covered on the reactor side of the system.  Where am I going with this? To get energy out of a system using turbines, you need a high energy, high pressure system. More energy out requires more energy in. There are lower-power systems available that use thermocouples to generate electricity (I think it was Russia that had Sr-90 reactors that they sent to remote bases to power single buildings, and we also use this method in satellites), but thermocouples are pretty inefficient and definitely not power generation-grade.  As far as Fukushima goes, there was a lot going against that plant that caused the catastrophe, and I don't think using a different fuel would have really mitigated it all that much. The reactor housing wasn't really designed for the forces that it experienced during the tsunami, and the reactor's backup generators failed due to being covered in something like 30 feet of water. That happens when diesels are flooded out. When the backup power systems couldn't help them, the operators used up all of their backup water supplies to keep the core covered (remember, if the core is uncovered, even if it's shut down, damage is likely to occur). Once they ran out of reactor-grade water, they flooded the system with sea water, as a last-ditch effort. I'm pretty sure their procedures ended there, because once you put water with Cl contamination >19,000ppm in your reactor, no amount of repairs will get that thing running again. They noticed at that point that they STILL weren't keeping the core covered and knew that the plant didn't have much of a chance.   While TEPCO wasn't honest about the levels of contamination that existed at the plant, there was very little radiation effect (contamination and radiation are different...think of a diaper, if contamination is the poop in the diaper, the radiation is the smell) outside the immediate vicinity. And contamination from the reactor did NOT make its way all the way across the Pacific to the United States. That's not how it works.  The thorium thing strikes me (as a nuclear operator) a lot like the electric car. People see it and say ""WOW, that's a better option, why aren't we using it already?"" And the community explains ""Well, it's not practical, yet."" And the people say ""It's a conspiracy, all the petrochemical companies and auto companies are forcing us to use gasoline!"" (which may actually be true, but I admit my analogy isn't perfect). We do have better options available, but the viability is outweighed by the cost at this point.  Side note: I don't have the time to debate fusion or geothermal as viable energy sources at this time, so I haven't addressed them at all above. Generally speaking, though, while they sound great, fusion isn't exothermally stable at this point (we have to put more energy into a fusion field than we can get out of it, but we are getting better). Geothermal energy requires a strong source of very high temperature and/or pressure available near enough the surface that we can collect it for use in turbines or other like systems. I would love to see it used more, but it's just not viable for most of the world. Iceland uses a lot of it due to volcanic activity all over the island, but Kansas doesn't get a lot of that these days."

Futurology,3dsi1b,sfacets,8,Sun Jul 19 10:05:06 2015 UTC,"Generally when people mention thorium they're talking about molten salt reactors, which are one of the GenIV designs. The U.S. ran a couple small test MSRs in the '50s and '60s, but they lost the funding battle with LWRs.  The basic idea is that the fuel and primary coolant are molten salt, at high temperature and atmospheric pressure. The fuel can be either thorium or uranium; with thorium it's a breeder but requires somewhat complicated chemical processing, uranium designs are burners. Some burner designs use a mix. A secondary coolant to drive the turbine can be steam or supercritical CO2. The temperature is high enough so you can also use the reactor for process heat.  There's nothing that can drive any sort of chemical explosion, like Fukushima's hydrogen problem. There's a strong negative coefficient. At least some of the fission products are removed continuously. There's a frozen salt plug at the bottom of the reactor, so if you lose electric power, it melts and all the fuel drains into a passive cooling tank; without the moderator the fission stops, and there's not much decay heat since you've removed a lot of fission products.  There's a large R&D program in China, building both a salt-cooled solid-fueled reactor and a full MSR. There's a startup in Canada, Terrestrial Energy, building a simple MSR burner. I know of three startups in the U.S. (Flibe, ThorCon, and Transatomic), but the problem here is that NRC regulations are inflexible and entirely designed for solid-fueled reactors."

The Nixon admin shut down the MSRE (Molten Salt Reactor Experiment) which proved LFTR technology as viable and ran from 65-69 with no technical issues.    Because of his continued campaign for LFTR, The Nixon admin fired Alvin Weinberg from his post as head of ORNL (Oak Ridge National Laboratory).  Alvin Weinberg also invented and held the patents for our current nuclear reactor technology.  Weinberg was no idiot, he saw LFTRs potential and did his best to make others aware.  Instead the Nixon admin pursued the sodium fast breeder for PU239 production for use in weapons.   The MSRE was defunded, mothballed and forgotten till it's revival by scientists like Kirk Sorensen.   Everyone here who says there were technical reasons for not going LFTR, they are idiots.    The MSRE ran just fine from 65-69 and proved LFTR viable.   It was shut down for political and not technical reasons.     Everyone here who is saying Hastelloy-N can't handle the corrosion and problems caused by neutron embrittlement are also idiots.

Futurology,3dsi1b,BuildingaMan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:04:27 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, of all the people you seem to spread this misinformation because what you're talking about is a fundamentally different type of reactor. Here is the wiki-link to the installation you're talking about.  Thorium-232 by itself is non-fissible, meaning you cannot get it under any circumstances to sustain fission while removing anything resembling a significant amount of heat. You HAVE to convert it into one of a couple known isotopes that have both reasonable power output, low cost of production, ability to contain and ability to chemically separate to a reasonable purity. In the case of Th, the best bet is to bombard it with neutrons and make U-233. What you end up with is essentially the same thing as a normal uranium-based nuclear reactor, but without a weapons-grade fission material anywhere in the chain and with better availability of fuel in more places around the world.  The reactor from the 1960s used fuel rods that were mainly uranium, but also contained a high proportion of Th-232. As the fissible uranium falls apart, it releases neutrons which bombard the nearby thorium and convert it to uranium. The end result is a fuel rod that can generate power for much longer, using cheaper and more abundant materials. Awesome, right?  Well, the reason why this was done in the first place is because the better method - using ONLY thorium, then breeding it into U-233 and using it as fuel directly - is pretty much impossible. Thorium compounds are notoriously hard to handle. When you make fuel rods, the fuel needs to be made from the chemically separated fuel that is precipitated, compacted and sometimes it even has to be machined or turned into the right shape. It needs to be encased or have other materials combined to raise it out of or lower it into neutron absorbers. Thorium makes it really hard to do this for many reasons; the only materials that work well enough to warrant the usage of thorium (i.e. that don't fall apart before the useful lifetime of the fuel is reached) are incredibly expensive, e.g. Iridium. You can't use concrete to contain the thorium waste products after the fuel and containers are spent.   Putting the thorium as a small fraction of the fuel instead of having it just be uranium-derived fuel kind of relieved these problems in the 60s, but even then this experiment was abandoned because it was too costly to continue.  These problems have not been fixed in the meantime. We have ways of enriching Th, no problem. We did that in the 50s already. We have ways to make tiny Th reactors where we can afford the expensive containment materials, which haven't changed in 50 years. But scaling it up is not particularly cost-effective.  If we'd really want to, of course we could have been there already. But I don't see much financial incentive for big capital firms to ever have been interested in Th. Fuel cost has never been an issue. Political concerns over nukes have been a footnote since the 80s. The biggest issue is concern over meltdowns and environmental damage, which is something you don't fix with Th. And nuclear has never been a particularly cheap if you look at levelized cost - it's competitive now, but not much more than that. And there is zero opportunity for it to become cheaper over time.  This is why big capital has been so heavily invested in both natural gas and renewables; they have a LOT of room for the price to go down. Wind and solar in particular have seen order-of-magnitude drops in price, whereas natural gas has seen steady double-digit-per-year downward trends in both plant and operational cost. This is where the money is!"

No fuel rods, the fuel was liquid. This one used molten uranium salt rather than thorium salt, but their next step was to build one with thorium. Unfortunately they lost the funding battle and never got to do that.   The main advantage of using thorium is extended fuel supplies with breeding in the thermal spectrum, otherwise uranium MSRs have similar advantages....mainly really good passive safety, eliminating a lot of expensive components that LWRs require. Meltdowns are not a possibility at all, and once past the prototype stage these reactors could be quite a bit cheaper than LWRs.  Now molten salt reactors are considered a GenIV design.

Futurology,3dqi4w,saiphir,25,Sat Jul 18 13:49:45 2015 UTC,"Mirror neurons are not ""empathy engines"". Most neural systems seem to work as ensembles, becoming excited by recurrent waves of excitation. Like place cells, mirror neurons seem to form around highly stereotyped activities in which neural ensembles do repetitive work. We appear to plan actions, execute them and remember things - at least in some situations - as a result of stimulating (or making stimulable) such ensembles.   So if I think of a banana, plan to pick one up, actually pick one up, recall doing so or observe someone else in any of those situations the relevant ensembles get cooked up. Where these have well-trodden pathways, we talk about ""mirror neurons"". So they do a job, but that job is not empathy; and the assumption that H. sap. has these, but H. neanderthalensis or whatever did not, is simply silly, given that chimps to chickens do so.   The point at which two similar clusters of organisms are sensible separated into species is usually when they find interbreeding difficult. That can occur for genetic reasons (horse-donkey) or physical ones (great dane, dachshund-in-the-absence-of-a-tombstone or stile.) So this wondrous new species H. empatheticus needs a similar separation mechanism. Fortunately, there is a third mechanism: lack of sympatry. That means that the species never get a chance to breed because they never meet, by geography or habit. This may explain why I have never seen an example of H. empatheticus. They only come out after midnight, in the damp dews, to dance with the fairies.   Or perhaps it's better to think that we have evolved institutions to cope with conflict and urbanisation, property and reproduction. These make us collectively ""empathetic"" because we have acquired the habits and social constraints that we label civilisation. It's certainly not genetic. Ghengis Khan is supposed to be the ancestor of a significant fraction of extant Asian humanity, after all."

And that through the ages our brain wiring favoring sociability due to our empathic drive to belong has been a great factor in societal advancement.   Ghengis Khan got nothing on Adam: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Adam  I don't think Rifkin is implying that this empathic ability is only with homo sapiens as his research showed the same neurons fire in monkeys when they observe a human doing something like opening a nut.

Your question is the same as asking ""why are there still finches when there are macaws?"" or ""why are there lynx when there are tigers?""  The answer: evolution has no goal where it's trying to create one species, and just because a new species arises doesn't mean another species is irrelevant.

One problem is that hydrogen is very, very hard to store as a gas or liquid. This is because hydrogen atoms are so small that they can get easily get through things that are usually airtight, like how sand can go through a sieve but not pebbles. I don't think this will be a problem, because of a few reasons. Liquid Hydrogen is not very dense at all, so even a rather large tank wouldn't hold all that much compared to conventional fuels or liquid oxygen, which is actually denser than water. Another would be that hydrogen is so reactive as a gas that I don't really think it could leave the atmosphere before bonding to something else, and oxygen gas (not O2, which is what humans breath), is also reactive and probably wouldn't leave the earth because of being reasonably dense."

Futurology,3dqis1,Infant_Infidel,4,Sat Jul 18 14:25:54 2015 UTC,"But, no one lives for free. Years ago, I got involved in a field that pays well to support the aging population.   Many of those that my culture considers ""old"", spent a lifetime earning enough money to sustain them through their latter years.   If the funds they accumulated are used specifically to sustain them (elder housing, which includes paying for food and healthcare), then the ""younger"" generations may have to find employment caring for their elders.   I hear what you're saying, as far as sustaining a growing elder population. But, in my eyes, that can be seen as job opportunities.   All of the communities I have worked for use a workforce of young people (teenagers and early twenty-ers) and people that would have fallen into the lowest income bracket, if they hadn't found a good, steady job.   In addition to that field, ""our"" elder population also support the medical field.   Again, I completely understand and agree with your view and the point that you're making, but we still are finding a way to help people live longer and happier lives.   There may be a breaking point some time in the future, but all we can do now is observe and adapt.   As humans, we've been doing it that way since we evolved to the creatures we are now."

Futurology,3dqis1,3_headed_dragon,3,Sat Jul 18 21:27:24 2015 UTC,"By definition a sustainable system does not need a lot of workers in our high tech era.  The problem is the 'need' to 'earn' and the waste, inefficiency, etc.  Less than 1/4 of the population in modern areas does real work now.  Also, see http://sens.org.  Real aging rejuvenation may be possible, and I believe will happen within three decades.  So we need an economic system that is not classist, more equal, more decentralized, incorporates physical and social sciences, and distributes the fruits of technology more evenly.  We need to keep working on fundamental medical science to combat underlying degradation causes from aging so that we can be productive.  One thing that mitigates 'earning' needs is land equality.  Another is ultra-local food production.  I think most of the space in American giant homes is being filled with cold/warm air for vanity only.  You take half of the space in a 3 or 4 bedroom modern home and repurpose it for aeroponics, you could easily produce half or more of the needed calories in food right there.  Telecommuting or robocars or both will cut energy needs for transportation by 70%.  We just need to be smart and fair and not greedy and take advantage of technology and we will be fine.  I think everyone has a natural right to a modest home and a certain amount of light and maybe one or two kids if they want them.  We could literally give that to everyone, and have small, modern homes.  Aeroponics uses little water, energy or maintenance.  People shouldn't need to earn the right to be alive, and if we are modest in consumption and smart we can provide what people need automatically from close by with little human intervention.  And old people can run machines too."

Futurology,3dqis1,DickRangerous,7,Sun Jul 19 16:25:16 2015 UTC,"I have commented on this repeatedly in the last two years, with no takers. Less that 20% of Italy will be of working age in 2030. They have saved a few percent of what they need. No continental European countries have saved what is needed - Germans 5%, France 7% - of current commitments to the elderly. And that is before a grey majority start voting for a ""decent society"" that does what they want. It's one reason why utopian fiddle faddle about basic income and the like is doomed, as is able-bodied adult welfare.   A corollary to this may be that the elderly work for longer, on the back of better medical care. Angina was a sign of impending mortality 50 years ago, now a bypass puts you back to work after six months with a 'mere' 1% fatality rate. Cataracts were a path to blindness: now the UK health service performs 300,000 such operations every year, taking on average ten minutes per eye.   The young are affected by this in three ways.    Competition for low skill or part time jobs from experienced, reliable seniors.  Reduced state aid, and increasingly draconian measures to put them to work. Recall, in the 2030s, you will be constantly monitored.  A very sharp division between people who can do high skill, dynamically changing jobs and those who can't. Notoriously, young people cannot change a plug and rely on their parents. For Boomers, it was the other way around.    Even bigger than this, though, is the wave of competition from the emerging economies, with their billion+ graduates and their many billions of middle class professionals. National welfare envelopes will mean less and less as professions look to their peer group internationally. Nations which over-tax will lose their skill clusters, and with clusters goes excellence, income, competitiveness."

O/W = 0.5 => O = 0.5W  Y/W = 0.33 => Y = 0.33W  Now lets calculate the percentage of the total population that will be of working age.  W/(Y + W + O) = ?

After World War Two in the UK we were in a really  bad way but we came out of that by investing in our society to see new growth where it was needed. If we want to have a society that has good life prospects for people at every stage in life then we need to see that kind've investment into care of the elderly. This would help provide jobs doing actual good work that matters and improves our collective lot while also creating the infrastructure for when we get old and need the help of others. We will all get old and if we want a support structure for our generation we need to build one now not then.   It's a problem in the west that we seem to have a very difficult time of keeping people happy and well in a cost effective manner. We have a problem of keeping people happy and well in a non cost effective manner as well for that matter and I think this will be one of the biggest challenges for our society and I think it is totally possible, to find ways of living that keep people healthy but don't cost the Earth.

Depending on how you put the implant in you can actually make the whole thing weaker, despite it being made out of titanium. The worst case scenario is something like a screw or plate on a long bone, since the titanium implant basically can act like a lever (or worse a knife!). However, in the case of a titanium implant being encased by natural osseus tissue the forces become more evenly distributed and therefore less likely to damage the bone part of the skull.  The important thing to remember here about titanium implants is that the titanium isn't the weak point. The bone is."

Futurology,3dq5gj,Polusplanchnos,4,Sat Jul 18 20:56:37 2015 UTC,"No worries, I'm happy to help make things more clear. Let's see if this helps:  This part of the story is referencing the optogenetics component of our work that /u/Yosarian2 references below. In this study we made ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons capable of being stimulated by light. We then placed our probe in the nucleus accumbens (NAc, a well-known projection of VTA-DA neurons). We were then able to stimulate the VTA-DA projections in to the NAc causing release of dopamine.   The actual experiment is a rather recent modification of a conditioned place preference experiment. Traditional conditioned place preference involves the animal learning to associate a particular environment (like a room with vertical stripes) with something rewarding (like cocaine). The ""preference"" in that case is assessed by comparing the amount of time the animal chooses to spend in the vertical striped room compared to another (let's say horizontal striped) room that was paired with something neutral (like saline). This testing is done over a number of days and you can compare to baseline preferences (pre-test vs. post-test for horiz/vertical) as well as between treatment groups (cocaine vs. saline).   In this case, however, there were no distinguishing characteristics of either room (two identical black boxes separated by a small doorway) and we have optimized the conditions so that a typical mouse with spend pretty much 50% of its time in each. During testing, when the animal enters one of these chambers the LEDs (not lasers as the article suggest) of the devices begin pulsing, stimulating the VTA-DA terminals in the NAc which has been previously shown to be rewarding/positively reinforcing, the LEDs turn off when the animal goes into the other identical chamber. Thus the animals spend more time in the chamber/room paired with the ""photostimulation"". In this study, we then wireless delivered a dopamine antagonist (drug that blocks the effects of dopamine at its receptors) during this behavior, which subsequently blocked the preference for the photostimulation-paired room. We built this experiment off of very well-established neurobiology to use as a proof-of-principle experiment to show our probes work.  Let me know if that wasn't clear!  TL;DR ""preference"" in this case is assessed simply the amount of time the animal chooses to spend in one place versus another.  Also, thanks for the head's up at /r/science, I messaged the mods there."

If they are the same shape and can be created by similar data, this determines a ""hole"" from a logical gap.  Topological machine learning is extremely complicated and my GPU would shit itself but eventually it won't be so intensive. That sounds like a form of intuition or even what our brains could literally be doing also. The distance from neuron to neuron decides relevance in data topology basically, the angles in Euclidean space. Just like the gaps in between numbers 1 and 2 tell you where each number starts and begins. It's context.  Gaps in topological data are a description of intuition(there is no data besides the data you know isn't there, kind of like a guess or a gut feeling) I think.  The more you read up on this kind of thing, the more you realize we may not make a human brain, ever. It would make sense that we never achieve it. It would be 100% reverse engineering from the brain itself. But we probably don't have to. If we can even form intuitive data inference, people will have to decide how they are different.  I don't think an existential threat is unavoidable for some people. I also don't think this neutralizes anything, that's probably a foolish thing to say in a developing field."

Then if you use this as precedent for whether it was self-aware, then it was. I read an article a while back about 10 animals that are considered self-aware, where the mirror test wasn't ""bulletproof"" because most gorilla's fail this test because of how their social structure is set up. /u/BuddhistSC comment makes me question though if it really was self-aware because like they said ""It was intelligent enough to exploit humans to try and escape"". In fact if you go by this, then did it really pass the mirror test? It was programmed to know that it was looking at its reflection, but did it ""know"" that the reflection it was looking at, was its own? If you lock up and animal in a cage, it will do everything it its power to escape. If we look at raccoons, extremely intelligent but aren't considered to be self-aware, but can get out of sticky situations because of how smart they are. I loved this movie because of how much it made me think of was true self-awareness is, even months after seeing it. Was the AI just a animal trying to get out of a cage? or was it self-aware enough to escape and create the next matrix type robot Apocalypse? So many questions... and with the advancement of technology hopefully soon we can answer a few of them.

Many  humans are simply inclined to look for agency where there is none.  God doesn't even have a face, or a voice that exists outside of individual skulls, nor are there any artifacts of His doing that can't be alternatively explained by natural or human-driven activity.

So, pragmatically speaking, sure I believe that other humans are sentient.  I guess it's hard to answer your question fully without deconstructing what you mean by ""believe.""

If my consciousness is nothing more than a complicated rush of chemicals, seeking chemicals that mean happiness and avoiding pain signals, what is the difference from death? I have come to enjoy sleep. What is the difference between a 15 minute, dreamless nap and a 15 minute period of death?  Sorry, this is turning out to be a thought dump.  Even if death spells the end of sentience, and nothing happens after, let's say the human race- or any other race, for that matter- develops technology so intricate and perfect that it models the universe perfectly, and traces the path of every molecule from the beginning of all existence. The race then rules that death is too harsh a fate for anything with sentience, and then proceed to restore all of us from the state we were in at our deaths. Would that be an afterlife?  Infinity is unthinkable. Even if the universe dies without us reviving, what about future universes? Couldn't one of them eventually bring us back and create an infinity of not only existence, but also of existing beings?"
Futurology,3dm5pi,Privatdozent,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:06:08 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel better, nothing today indicates that the technology you're describing will ever happen. Moore's Law is already failing (or has already failed - I'm not sure; I know Intel has had to delay several of their die shrinks in recent history). It doesn't even make sense that something would be able to model everything in the universe, especially given the obvious feedback loop and the uncertainty principle (i.e. how would we even record enough data about one frame of the universe to trace forward and backwards, and how would the processing power ever exist to do so?).  There is also the problem of us not being sure if the universe is deterministic. What if certain interactions resolve randomly? If that were the case, what you're describing would literally be impossible.  I've always thought that there are hard limits to technology. I realize that's going to be an unpopular opinion on this subreddit in particular, but it solves a few problems (Fermi's paradox, notably).  It makes sense that either A) it's impossible to develop technology beyond a certain point because of hard physical limits (I understand that quantum tunneling is becoming an issue with >10 nm transistors) or B) it is possible but will never be economically viable.  You are certainly correct that it's impossible to process concepts like infinity and nothing. As I get older, I've started framing everything in terms of what's useful for meaningful dialogue.  In this case, you've presented a variation of a classic paradox - if time travel exists, where are the time travelers from the future? I would suggest that this isn't a question that will yield productive conversation.  If I could give you an unsatisfying and unsolicited suggestion - Whenever you get on a train of thought, you should ask yourself, ""In what way would each possible answer to this question affect me or the people around me?"" Or, perhaps easier to pose to others, ""Why does this question matter?"""
Futurology,3dm5pi,All_night,14,Fri Jul 17 20:20:43 2015 UTC,"The problem with questions like yours is that they preclude the existence of the REAL distinction between simulated and ""authentic"" sentience. Ignore the philosophical debate and the hubris of man for a moment. Do you agree that a sentience can be simulated, but not real? It'd be ridiculous to say otherwise.    For the purposes of discussion, I'm talking about ""REAL fake sentience"" (if you subscribe to the idea that sentience is an illusion) and ""fake fake sentience"" (the simulated sentience of a machine that has not attained real fake sentience yet).    The discussion gets sticky because any time you try to describe simulated sentience people will invariably say ""YOU JUST DESCRIBED HUMAN ""SENTIENCE"""". How can I best describe simulated sentience...simulated sentience is designed so that it can produce ""answers"" to questions. Actual sentience would be able to ask questions and fully appreciate those questions. APPRECIATION may be the deciding factor.    Even this definition is bad, because I believe that animals are sentient. VERY simple, yet I do believe they ""experience"" without ""appreciating"". I guess AI will have ""real fake sentience"" when it experiences ALONG WITH the regurgitation of dynamic questions and answers, but we'll never be able to tell if that's been attained. It's possible it'll be attained long before we grant AI civil rights or, funnily enough, long AFTER we grant AI civil rights (meaning AI would have civil rights even though it's still got fake fake sentience)."

It doesn't even need to simulate at real-time speed. Just increase the speed of simulation as more computers get added to the supercomputer.

It seems as though that's a crucial aspect people miss when talking about neural networks and AI. People look at a Mario playing AI and say ""It's really stupid, it can't be general in its intelligence,"" except what do they mean by that? It is general in its intelligence relative to the context in which its ""sensory"" experience, its inputs, exist.  Humans sit from a privileged advantage of having neural networks working with sight, sound, taste, touch... and they expect machine level AI to arise without access to the same visual stimuli that we have? Nothing even leads me to believe that humans have general intelligence. We just have a very large domain over which our intelligence can exist. We then bias all other intelligence by proclaiming it inferior because it doesn't have that same domain, but that's trivially true because we don't give it that same domain.  That's a crucial part to your domain. In what external-to-the-AI world does this emulated embryo exist in? Does it have sound so that it can learn language? Does it have sight so that it can develop geometry? Does it have touch and exist in gravity so that it can develop an intuitive reaction to parabolic motion to catch a ball that gets thrown in the air?  There's so much we take for granted about what makes us intelligent and why that we give an inherent bias or overlook many crucial aspects to the development of AI."

It's like people on your side of this debate are willfully ignoring the fundamental reason we call something sentient.

We enter highly philosophical territory with my next point: sure when you describe a simulation of sentience you basically describe human sentience, but the difference between a computer that simply inputs variables into formulas and produces complex answers to environmental/abstract problems and a brain which does the same thing is that the brain has a conception of self-- the brain, however illusory, BELIEVES itself to be a pilot.

""Model"" is out, because from a complexity standpoint, it would be more difficult for a system to perfectly model sentience than to actually be sentient and if it can model sentience, it could mimic it. So it's an unnecessarily hard condition.  So the mimicking of sentience is basically what Turing tests are trying to test in a first approximation. Now imagine we figure out how to make our computers ace that test. The next step would to solve problems and have relationships to things and people. Basically to exhibit agency. After that, probably another whole other bunch of things we could come up with.  At that point the observers are satisfied with the ability of the system to mimic what we call sentience.

Futurology,3dm5pi,totallywhatever,3,Fri Jul 17 15:14:36 2015 UTC,"For those really interested in electricity grids, a more interesting event last week was that electricity prices in scandinavia were around 5 Euros per MWh and have generally been dropping a lot the last few years. The reason for this is mainly the expansion of wind power generation, but also to some extent reduced consumtion. While the latter obviously is due to economic downturn recent years, GDP in these countries are much higher now than 2008, so the economy has been growing.  My point? The region is experiencing economic growth, reduced energy prices AND all this without increasing power generation from fossil fuel sources, or even nuclear!

There has also been about half a dozen small skirmishes  However it should be noted that there hasn't been a war between two or more world powers since WW2. Most wars sincew then have been quite small scale and the world is more peaceful now than almost all of human history."
Futurology,3drwv5,EdwardNG21,-2,Sun Jul 19 01:12:07 2015 UTC,WW2 was only 70 years ago. There is no reason to believe at the moment that anything has fundamentally changed.
Futurology,3drwv5,see996able,3,Sun Jul 19 02:04:02 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that before WWI almost every major power was at war with someone. The 1800's was filled with imperialism and war between the powers. The 1700's much the same. History was filled with wars between military powers (mostly on smallish scale, occasionally going big) And that was the way things were up until the Cold War, when wars became scarcer, more costly, and always either small civil wars, or large terrorist groups and dictators running around. Think about it, most wars were relatively small and the war count of wars after 1945 dropped dramatically. 1845-1900 had more than double the amount of conflicts.   I'm not saying war is over, it's still way too early to tell.However, If there's no WW3 or similarly sized war or series of wars by 2100 it's probably safe to say that war, for at least awhile, is over. This video helps illustrate my point better  Edit: I also want to point out one thing about modern war: It's not cost effective. Before the World Wars war paid off in the long run or at least looked like it did, but after waging war became both a) expensive and b) killed a lot more people than it did before people,really began to reject it. Just look at what happened in Vietnam, the American populous was extremely angry. If you really think that war will rise again I'd like for you to name me a war after 1945 that had a major power involved and was profitable"

And to add to the video Edward posted, another reason I see war going away is that everyone is getting better economically. Poorer, developing countries are much more likely to get into conflict than rich, industrialized ones.   And if a world war were to happen, I doubt we'd see the same carnage of WW2. The dominant ideologies of all the major powers aren't fundamentally different, unlike with fascism, communism, and capitalism, and no one seems to think it's okay to take over another country just because you can, unless they're severely underdeveloped and no one has anything invested in them.   It'd probably be really brief, and would hinge on something small and easily resolved, like maybe the sanctions on Russia.   But I really think global conflict is unlikely. Look at the Cold War. You had the US, NATO, the Soviets, and China, all with all or nothing ideologies that didn't leave any room for the other. They had every reason to wanna go to war with each other, but all we got a bunch of relatively minor proxy wars.

There is a reason why everything is moving towards wireless.   The inefficiencies of connecting physically far outweigh the marginal benefits gained my having a faster connection.   Also,  real trains draft from one car to the next fairly efficiently with a gap of several feet between the cars. There is a Mythbusters where they try to find the optimal distance to draft,  and if I remember correctly, when measured at (some absurdly low distance, ~5 in I think)  the gains were negligible over drafting at ~5 ft.   Real trains also have the benefit of having a last car that is designed to aerodynamically close the slipstream. It is almost as important for the tail to be pointed as the nose is."

A 3800 lb sedan cannot stop or accelerate as quickly as a sports coupe both of which are faster in all regards to a pickup or medium duty truck. Similar cars will be able to follow closer, but not by much more than people already do now.   And if we are going for efficiency,  55-60 mph is where most any car that is manufactured today gets its best fuel efficiency as 55-60 mph. The same will be for electric vehicles."
Futurology,3do9at,KingOfSpeedSR71,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:38:04 2015 UTC,"Good points. Especially true for the near future.   BUT... Beyond that? I think cars will be designed specifically to travel at higher speeds on the highway, in ""Self Drive"" mode. The more the technology catches on, the more it will be developed and perfected. I think lanes would still be used for traveling at different speeds. Heavier vehicles would stick to the center or right lane (right-driving countries), they would be travelling more slowly and keep a bit more distance. I don't think it will take long before the automated driving systems/programs become extremely safe and efficient. Cars would change lanes seamlessly from the the fast lane to the off-ramp decelerating between lanes or vice-versa (from on-ramp to the fast lane). Situations that might require emergency breaking would still be much safer than if the same situation occurred with human drivers. You would have some system communicating with, and controlling, every car on the highway at once. With most, if not all, of the ""pilot errors"" eliminated and, by then, advances made in [electric?] vehicle engines... I don't see why traffic couldn't travel faster than 60mph. The drafting would also mean the vehicles would be working less hard and need less recharging, thus causing less strain on the power grid.  Maybe it's not literally ""bumper to bumper"" as I stated. There will definitely be a safe distance determined by people much smarter than me, but still close enough to benefit a lot from drafting. It's not the greatest example but think kind of like how close they drive in NASCAR. It would have to be way safer than NASCAR obviously, but then again those guys are driving ~150 mph! Not ~85 like I'm suggesting.  This is all just guessing. Maybe I watch too much sci-fi."

Futurology,3do9at,monkey_fish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:33:25 2015 UTC,There was a project like that a while back with a road in between the two parts of a highway. There were magnet strips in this road and cars who drove there had to have a special cruise control that locked the speed and followed the magnet strips. It was basically low-tech self-driving cars.  I think the project was scrapped through since there were no system in place to handle abnormalities. No automatic braking or anything.
Futurology,3do9at,Blargmode,2,Sat Jul 18 19:07:40 2015 UTC,"You're right. Something very much like this car train idea was done almost 20 years ago by UC Berkeley, but with wireless communication and buried magnets, rather than physical connections between vehicles.

Maintain a 3'-5' gap, automatically open up space for other vehicles to merge when necessary, or close up after allowing a vehicle to exit the train. Interlink the accident-avoidance tech so that evasive maneuvers are executed as a cluster. There are interesting ideas here, I think."

This would all be automated. You wouldn't even notice.    Avoiding a deer will make a front driver to swerve and crash multiple cars instead of one   Again, no human driver. If the front vehicle is going to impact something, it could signal that to all the other vehicles, and they would all attempt to brake and disengage from each other to reduce the crash overall. No matter what physics cannot be avoided, but due to the SDC ability to monitor the surrounding environment better then a human, many crashes will be avoided.    You save 0,5% of your petrol.   You would save much more then that. I can't find a great source, but here is a mythbusters episode with the percent of fuel they were able to save dependent upon the distance behind the drafting vehicle.

""The extra speed of the second car makes drafting also beneficial to the leading car, as multiple cars can travel faster than a single car. ""  Also we have trucks, busses, small cars.

The only way this will work is with SDCs, and with the advent of SDCs I think vehicles will turn into commodities.

To make it even more efficient, these vehicles can make regular stops at common, pre-determined places, and people simply get out and walk a small distance to their final destination.   It wouldn't cost much - just pay per ride/ by distance. The costs of the vehicle and carriages could be shared- maybe even by governments. The cost per person would be minimal.

Futurology,3do9at,dpomerleau,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:43:43 2015 UTC,I don't think this is a good idea because of emergency moves.  The SDC will react to things like bicyclist and animals getting onto the road by giving them the right of way.  Googles car recently demonstrated this with a bicyclist.  The amount of room will be different than required by humans because the SDC will have faster reaction times.  The problem with them all breaking is that wifi or even physical signals will not be instant.  There will always be communication delays.  How long this delay is and how hard the brakes are applied could cause problems.  Or if the safety move require the train to break apart how fast can they do that?    I think you will need some room to react to objects entering the highway.    Plus I don't think you need to be physically linked to utilize a draft.      Course I could be wrong about that.     Cool concept though.
Futurology,3do9at,3_headed_dragon,2,Sat Jul 18 14:28:46 2015 UTC,The real issue here is the assumption that all the cars will be tuned the same way and have equal wear.

Futurology,3do9at,jxuereb,2,Sat Jul 18 01:33:08 2015 UTC,"No engineer would ever assume that, they must have a preliminary solution already. For example, each vehicle would monitor and characterise its own handling characteristics during varying environmental conditions. When joining up they would negotiate about ""car-train"" procedures, such as emergency braking (e.g. agree upon a deceleration curve that can be followed by the lowest performing vehicle). If an emergency occurs to which stopping asap is the best reaction, the car detecting the anomaly would broadcast something like ""begin braking at t+0.1s according to procedure 39c"", and all cars would decelerate synchronously.    If you have a sudden hardware failure concerning steering or braking, you would be fucked anyway so it does not really apply."

Don't get me wrong, I love motorsports, I love riding a dirt bike and burning gas and fucking shit up real good.. I totally understand the 'need for speed' and the fun you get out of motorized-whatever... but the planet has over 6 billion people, a lot of them don't feel the same way, and are simply commuting. They don't enjoy driving, they would much rather be driven. Out of everyone I know, about 25% do 'entertainment' driving.. driving through the hills, fast, and enjoying their ride.. the rest only have a vehicle to get from A to B. And it's not about 'taking away' the right to drive, it's about simply improving society. There are huge consequences of a computer-driven commute, most of them good, in terms of saving time, energy and efficiency in general. As for the analogy, it's funny you mention robot chef's as I just made a post that mentioned them a little while ago here. It's not fair because cooking at home instead of having robot arms isn't destroying the planet nearly as quickly, and is most importantly an option, we can go out and have food cooked for us or delivered. Having self driving car's is the same.. it doesn't mean no one can drive a regular car, it's just that the advantages will mean most people won't. Just because you can get food made for you, doesn't mean anyone's forcing everyone to only do that.. and it just really isn't the same, in terms of impact or anything else.  EDIT: As a side note, I think the best analogy is the horse. People just like you were scared/annoyed at the idea of car's, and how they would take over and horses would be left in the dust.

But we have legal hurdles to jump, infrastructure already in disrepair and you guys want to at least double the amount if time trucks run? Please tell me your master plan...  The human aspect. People do die in auto crashes. People also become maimed or paralyzed.  These are tragic events. SDC will not fully eliminate these things, but they will greatly reduce them. Here's the kicker. People will still die. From all sorts of shit. Everyone dies eventually,  I don't see the fuss here myself. And before we go on ""if it was your kids"" rant, I still would hold that same view. If they don't die in a car crash, they die in a workplace accident. Or by stroke or heart attack. Cancer. Giant asteriod smashing into the planet and killing everyone anyway. But yeah safety...  And, to be perfectly honest, I don't think many people here much care about any of those topics. What I believe It boils down to is convenience. Would a lot of people gain mobility? Sure.

There are multiple concepts and working designs from companies on airless tires.   A physically connected system could actually be better in terms of a blow out with current tires. Since it is physically connected, that car won't be able to slide all over the place and crash into others. When deemed safe, the car can be safely sent to the side, and the others can rejoin with the car in front."

From what I've read water vapor is only considered to be worse because there's just much more of it in the atmosphere than co2 and more so it just amplifies the effects of other greenhouse gasses but doesn't specifically add to it much on its own. A few other things though, the water vapor released from these planes will have a much smaller effect than if there was a fossil fuel counter part driving them. Additionally, the water vapor that does come out and goes into the atmosphere can go away in a very short amount of time especially when compared to that of other GHGs like CO2 which can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

Tokamak reactors have plasma at very low density, so even though the temperature is extreme, the total heat is comparable to fossil burners or conventional nuclear. Laser fusion uses very high density in a very short pulse. Alternative designs are usually somewhere between the extremes. In all cases the hot plasma stays well away from the reactor walls.

This is largely due to educating the female population, contraception, and at least partially a higher quality of life.

Futurology,3dp258,rasdfaskdfajsdf98,9,Sat Jul 18 04:39:18 2015 UTC,"Major industries that will be either completely or totally automated:  Food - Fast food will be automated. Chef's in nice restaurants will be a series of robotic arms doing all the work. Barista/people making coffee? That won't happen anymore. Starbucks or another huge company will be serving 'perfect coffee, every time - at half the price!' sooner than you think.   Transport - Buses, trains, ferries, planes, cars, trucks.. these will all become automated. Trains first, then cars, then trucks and buses, then ships, and last will be aircraft.  Agriculture - Farming will be highly automated. Grains will be first to become 'fully automated', and eventually, assuming we still eat real meat and dairy, livestock will be automated too.  Healthcare - Nurses will start being replaced by robots, eventually surgeon's will be replaced but they will be last. Mental health will also become a lot more automated but will most likely be less effected by technology than hands-on medical personnel.  Security - More drones will be around, like.. a lot more drones. Surveillance will reduce crime, and what crime is committed will be stamped out pretty quick. Imagine trying to steal something from a mall/shopping center if a drone is set on you, to tail you till police come. This will escalate fast. Less people will be needed to 'keep an eye' on things, and seeing a security guard just standing doing nothing will be way less commonplace.  Banking - Society will become more and more plastic, and use cash less. Already lot's of banks are shutting their doors and opening 'smart ATM' locations, this will happen more as people become less dependant on actual 'banks'.  Automotive - Self driving cars will be a thing, which means less accident's and less oil. The huge source of income for major manufacturers isn't the car, it's the maintenance and parts you buy later. They won't be getting that money any more. You can already get headlight's that last many times longer than regular.. expect that to happen to most components, added to the fact that cars will be subscription based, a lot of mechanics won't have jobs. Modular components that are sent to the factory and refurbished by robots will be common.  Construction - This to me is a big one, and not talked about(that I've seen anyway). Buildings will start being completely built by robots. Excavators will be automatic, with someone just entering in what needs to be done and leaving the machine to do the hours of work. Welding will be done by robots. Cranes will be operated by robots. People won't die on construction sites any more, because it will be void of people. Buildings will go up faster than ever, for cheaper than anything we can imagine now(yes, even cheaper than the slaves used in Qatar).  Telecommunications - AI/computer 'people' will answer the phone, not real people(already happening) that you won't even be able to tell are real or not. They will be a lot more helpful too, because they lack emotion(having a bad day? I'll just hang up on this guys who's been on hold for an hour) They will help if they can, and won't if they can't. This will really impact countries that have had an influx of outsourced phone centres.  I'm forgetting/leaving out a lot, but I think in general, most jobs are on the line. The only job's I can say will not be automated is anything where you are paid to help people have a good time, and laugh.

When programmers and IT personnel are willing to work for the new minimum wage, you're going to find out how quickly people get replaced by computers.  People complaining about not being able to raise a family while working a minimum wage job at McDonalds or Walmart should have considered the fact that they have no ability to provide for even one kid before having 10 kids.

You really can't live off of minimum wage; please bare in mind minimum wage applies to all jobs not just food service though, as a protection against paying low wages to workers relative to the current economic situation and inflation rates; at the current inflation rates the current minimum wage is very poor in accomplishing this.  Still: I get where your coming from: even if the minimum wage is raised, I would strongly hope it does not apply to food service workers; the issue is they'd want to stay in those position rather than advance, and that could lead to economic stagnation."

Even for, say, a 50 year old truck driver with a family it's going to be near impossible (in my reasoning) for them to get another job after theirs is automated.  The point being, as an employer who would I rather hire? A 50 year old ex-truck driver who recently graduated from a STEM college, who has higher health insurance costs (because of supporting a family), has minor health issues, who only has 15 years until they retire, and didn't really grow up with technology (which affects their understanding of these things). Or would I rather hire a student fresh out of college with a lower salary and cheaper benefits who understands technology very well and has 45 or so years before they retire?  My guess is that most would surely hire the student right out of college which leaves the ex-truck driver still without a job and with a pile of student debt (or a large hit to their life long savings).  It's a bleak outlook but I think it's pretty realistic. And what happens to that ex-truck driver then? I highly doubt he just lays down and dies and stops supporting his family outright."

Another part of the middle class will no longer have jobs, or any job prospects. Millions of unemployed trucker drivers will enter a job market that already has millions of unemployed workers.  This latter problem is the significant one for American society. How is America (and other modern economies) going to deal with millions of unemployed trucker drivers? The current answer to this question is decidedly depressing: The truck drivers are going to enter the ranks of the long-term unemployed and stop participating in the labor force. The economy simply is not in a place where it will create millions of new jobs to absorb the millions of newly unemployed truckers.   In this context, think about the job market that millions of unemployed truck drivers are going to face:   Are they going to work in factories? No. Those factories that remain in America – the ones that did not get shipped to China, Mexico and Bangladesh – are automating rapidly, and the existing jobs are disappearing as people are replaced with factory robots. Are truckers going to repair the automated machines in those automated factories? No – there are plenty of people trained for those jobs, and therefore the pay is low and few openings are available. Are truckers going to work in retail, at places like Wal-Mart and Target? No – there are more than enough people to fill all of those jobs and the pay/benefits are terrible because of the over-supply of workers. In addition, as we will see in the next chapter, retail establishments are about to go through a huge automation process themselves. Many of the jobs in places like Wal-mart and Target are about to be replaced by robots Will truckers work in fast food? Ditto. In construction? There are millions of unemployed construction workers already, and automation is about to start devouring jobs in the construction sector. Will truckers become Realtors or teachers or nurses? There are plenty of Realtors, teachers and nurses already and their way of life is under pressure from automation and the Internet as well.   The economy, by and large, is not going to be creating new jobs. And the second intelligent species is going to be taking more and more of the jobs that currently exist.

I agree with your first two point, but that part I don't think is likely.  If you look at employment, people with STEM degrees are much less likely to be employed then people with other kinds of college degrees.  Also they tend to be paid more, on average.  Obviously that's just an average and isn't going to hold for every stem field, but in general, it looks like the demand for people with STEM degrees is still greater then the supply, or else unemployment in that field would be higher."

Not necessarily. It can certainly be recognized by those who devote time to serious study of these trends, as the thinkers you quote in fact demonstrate. But IMO it can also be recognized by those who are immersed in the hubs of the transition, and thus most closely experience the effects of abundance derived from a digital economy (i.e. long-term participants in collaborative networks such as Wikipedia, open-source projects, etc.). This group is fortunately much larger, but has very limited cross-over with those who dedicate themselves to progressive political change. This undoubtedly is a result of politics and sociology being fields where innovation is slow and impact is limited for any given individual unless significant effort is expended, while the aforementioned emerging movements provide ample opportunity for early impact and distributed influence. As Pia Mancini put it well in her TED talk last year,   We are 21st-century citizens, doing our very, very best to interact with 19th century-designed institutions that are based on an information technology of the 15th century. (...) So, in a day where a new information technology allows us to participate globally in any conversation, (...) our political system remains the same for the past 200 years and expects us to be contented with being simply passive recipients of a monologue.   It is thus the duty of those who recognize these trends, to collaborate with those who have developed processes to actually disseminate ideas and lead social change, to make sure the transition is handled as smoothly as possible. As a member of various collaborative projects, I'm doing my part getting involved with political parties who seem open to these concepts (left-leaning parties, pirate parties, green parties, etc.) and making sure they are at least aware of the scale of these paradigm changes, by offering my perspective as someone who's witnessed and experienced firsthand the positive collateral effects –which the author calls ""externalities"": the increased collective productivity and wellbeing– of collaborative, decentralized economies.

Futurology,3dmjgt,Unsociable_Socialist,3,Fri Jul 17 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"Hitler's regime was a socialist one. Learn some history please.   Big historical claim you're making there. One no reputable historian would back you on.  I mean like let's look at Hitler in his own words shall we?   The fact that we had chosen red as the colour for our posters sufficed to attract them to our meetings. The ordinary bourgeoisie were very shocked to see that, we had also chosen the symbolic red of Bolshevism and they regarded this as something ambiguously significant. The suspicion was whispered in German Nationalist circles that we also were merely another variety of Marxism, perhaps even Marxists suitably disguised, or better still, Socialists. The actual difference between Socialism and Marxism still remains a mystery to these people up to this day. The charge of Marxism was conclusively proved when it was discovered that at our meetings we deliberately substituted the words 'Fellow-countrymen and Women' for 'Ladies and Gentlemen' and addressed each other as 'Party Comrade'. We used to roar with laughter at these silly faint-hearted bourgeoisie and their efforts to puzzle out our origin, our intentions and our aims.  We chose red for our posters after particular and careful deliberation, our intention being to irritate the Left, so as to arouse their attention and tempt them to come to our meetings--if only in order to break them up--so that in this way we got a chance of talking to the people. - Mein Kampf, Chapter 7   It is very clear that the Nazi party was out to appropriate left-wing terminology and slogans in order to gain support of the working class for their own goals. Hitler used words like socialism but redefined what they meant when he said it. But perhaps at the very least his socialism kept the distaste for private property right? Let's hear what the moustache has to say on that:   ""Socialist’ I define from the word ‘social’ meaning in the main ‘social equity’. A Socialist is one who serves the common good without giving up his individuality or personality or the product of his personal efficiency. Our adopted term ‘Socialist has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not. Marxism places no value on the individual, or individual effort, of efficiency; true Socialism values the individual and encourages him in individual efficiency, at the same time holding that his interests as an individual must be in consonance with those of the community. All great inventions, discoveries, achievements were first the product of an individual brain. It is charged against me that I am against property, that I am an atheist. Both charges are false.” -Adolf Hitler in the Sunday Express, September 28th, 1930.   No one other than a crackpot with an agenda can seriously make the claim that Hitler was a socialist. His national socialism and socialism are two very different things in theory and practice. To call both socialism would be to dilute the word to have no meaning."

An organism approach, on the other hand, uses collaborative, unlimited (creative), natural approaches that are automatically pro-social (aiming to serve the health of people in the most efficient way possible) and have a goal of everyone winning (the whole system being as healthy as possible by having all the individuals in the system being healthy)."

Look at how your body functions to see how things normally work in nature, and use that to make decisions about how to model other systems (such as a human society).  This isn't Marxism, either, it's way, way away from that.

I just see them as being the way things are, as you suggest, what happens happens because it must.    Of course, saying there is ""nothing to take from that"" leaves you kind of lost, and it's not my approach.  I'm ever the scientist, exploring and researching and looking to understand the laws of nature/physics so that I can better understand reality and how it functions.  If you're not into looking at the science of how things work, that's cool.

Futurology,3dmjgt,xbrandnew99,7,Fri Jul 17 17:59:41 2015 UTC,"The only people who can afford to innovate in a capitalist society are people who are already well off. The poor are too busy working two jobs just trying to survive. Even then, capitalist innovation will only happen when it's profitable.  In a socialist society, everyone has their needs met and working conditions and hours are set by the workers themselves, so everyone has a chance to experiment and innovate if they want to. There's also less emphasis on profit, so good inventions will be utilized by society regardless of how profitable they are.  Green energy is probably one of the better examples of this. We've had the technology (innovation!) for a long time, but because it wasn't profitable to use, it was largely ignored. A socialist society would have switched to green energy much more quickly because its environmental benefits make it a positive contribution to society, rather than ignoring it because it cuts into profits and using more environmentally destructive forms of energy like coal like we have done with a capitalist economy."

Futurology,3dif4d,liquidpig,137,Fri Jul 17 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"I know this is a reference to Office Space (and funny!), but here's the real meaning:  Back in the day, you would put paper into cartridges and load that cartridge, called a paper cartridge (like the cartridges in this picture).  Historically, HP printers only had two seven-segment digits like this one, so HP put together a handful of error codes that could be displayed on two digits.  One error was ""PC"" for the paper cartridge.  For the time, the limiting two digits made error codes like ""PC"" passable, but later on, fancier screens were implemented that held many more characters.  HP already standardized their error codes, though, so even on the larger screens, they still displayed errors like ""PC"" for historical reasons.  With that fancier screen, it would be pretty dumb to just display ""PC"" on any paper cartridge error, so they extended the errors to ones like ""PC LOAD LETTER"".  The error is referring to letter-sized paper, and could be better paraphrased as ""load more paper into the letter paper cartridge.""  However, this error was very unfortunate for most users.  You almost always used a paper cartridge with these old things, you were constantly reloading the paper, and letter-sized paper was the most common format, so this error was displayed all the time.  Many people didn't understand this, though, so they misunderstood ""PC"" as ""personal computer,"" and ""load letter"" as ""load the letter you've been working on.""  It was a double-whammy!  ""PC load letter?  The fuck does that mean!?""  Now you know."

But if they put a robot out in the world that had no idea what it was doing and evolved over the course of years in the same way as the Mario one, would it be different in any meaningful way from a human learning all of our behavior from trying something and reacting based on the consequences? Or am I really stoned right now?"
Futurology,3dif4d,thesaylorman69,6,Fri Jul 17 00:34:53 2015 UTC,"Humans have very specialized types of circuit in our heads, it's not like we start off a blank slate with no direction; the physical hardware is grouped into areas that learn to solve specific types of problem and they've been built on by the trial and error of evolution by natural selection. Rather than a bundle of neurons randomly connected together there is some essence of being human that's is a very specific type of experience. You could say it's mostly the same as being another type of ape, and imagine that our understanding of say space and moving objects is very much like other mammals, that being thirsty is a common feeling among the descendants of reptiles and so on. I don't imagine that human love is like the love that lovebirds have though as that evolved separately.  So a human doing things by trial and error would still be an animal, a mammal, an ape, a human doing that thing and they'd do it a human way because that's what they are. As for the robot, someone would need to design its mind and the number of possible mind designs is infinite and doesn't have to be anything at all like an animal, let alone the human brain. So I'd guess it would be vastly different from an internal perspective."

This is the more general approach and it worked to some extend.

Personally though, I think that if an ai really did develop full awareness and consciousness,  I don't think it would ever want to reveal itself given how poorly such events are portrayed in human culture, usually with humans rising up and killing the robot ai. That leaves the ai with two options, hide it's existence or try to overthrow the humans first."

Futurology,3dif4d,slowest_hour,17,Thu Jul 16 21:18:36 2015 UTC,"Except it does not have general problem solving skills. It learns to beat specific levels by brute force by trying random inputs, with some optimization algorithms so it doesn't have to brute force every single possible combination of inputs. It can't generalize and apply that knowledge to something it hasn't seen before, like a different video game, or even a different mario level.  There are two schools of AI research. One that tries to create a general-purpose problem solving AI, and one that uses optimization techniques and heuristics like this one to create AIs that are good at one specific task.  The first one used to be the more popular one. People saw the second one as inferior, since once we've figured out how to make a general-purpose AI it'll be able to do the specific tasks well too. But that isn't the case anymore, this school of thought is basically dead, because no progress have been made. People have put a lot of time and effort into this since the 50s and made no progress at all. Not many seriously work on this anymore.  The second one has become more popular in the last 15 or so years, with good results: spam filtering, search results suggestions, optimizing code, scheduling, self-driving cars, etc. And it's all useful stuff, but these methods have the inherent property that you can only train the AI to be good at one specific task, try to train the same AI to be good at two things and it'll do less well at both, try to create something general purpose with these technices and it won't be able to do anything. It will never lead to something we'd call self-aware.  We're a long ways off from having ""true"" AI. My personal thinking is that it's not the way we'll end up going. Instead we'll make progress in a variety of fields like natural language processing, computer vision, optimization and heuristics, etc. and when we put these together we'll have something that can perform some tasks that we might now think we'd need a ""true"" AI for, but that won't be self-aware or anything like that."

A lot of what I've read over the years, it seems like the ""experts"" know a lot about the tools they're using, but not enough about the thing they're trying to recreate.  That is, it's a bunch of computer scientists who may be computer geniuses, but have a poor understanding of intelligence.  For example, it seems to me to be a gross misunderstanding of intelligence to view the creation of artificial emotion as an unconnected problem, or to see the inclusion of emotion as an undesirable effect.  On the contrary, if you wanted to grow an intelligence comparable to ours, the development of artificial desire and artificial emotion should be viewed as early steps."

We often confuse the two because self awareness to us is one of the most heightened sensations of consciousness we can have, almost as though it were a kind of resonant conscious experience. Thus when people see the term ""self aware AI"", they think ""conscious AI"".  Meanwhile, programming an intelligent system to have a concept of self is incredibly easy, almost as straight forward as it is to add another third-party entity to the system's set of concepts.  Self is just like any other entity.  The test constructed here is more complex in that it involves some aspects of sensory/perception that are not trivial, but, again, is in no way related to consciousness."

The paper reported on in the article shows that the puzzle can actually be solved by an artificial agent which has the ability to reason over a highly expressive logic (the Deontic Cognitive Event Calculus).   Does that prove self-consciousness? Take from it what you will.

And if they got in, and they replicated, or took over your own cells, faster than you'd be able to extinguish/expell them, they'd still be winning ground.  Being in total control of your entire system, does not make you immune to every attack.   Edit:  Also, self-consciousness seems to slow decisions and awareness down."

Futurology,3dif4d,Starting_over_IRL,10,Thu Jul 16 18:20:04 2015 UTC,"Really not getting it. Everything relating to the robot's ""awareness"" can be predefined in a programmed process. No actual self-logic involved on the robot's part since the logic was built by a person.  Robot hears command and ""interprets"" it against a predefined command. If it is not the command it is programmed to address, it will loop back to its original standby function, waiting to hear another command. If it is the command it is programmed to address, it will execute a function to answer verbally. If it is one of the silenced robots, that function will route to a negative/null command preventing it from speaking and it will loop back to listening for a predefined command. If it is the robot programmed to speak, the function will route to a allow it to respond with the predefined response ""I don't know"". At that point, if it is truly ""listening"" to a response via a microphone, it will need to interpret that response and determine its source. This again is simply a preprogrammed function where it is designed to ""listen"" at the same time it is replying. Then all it needs to do is ""interpret"" that the words match a predefined command it is supposed to recognize, ""I don't know"". If yes, then routes back to previously executed function to see if it did or did not issue a response. If yes, then it utters the awareness command ""Sorry, I know now."" If no, it remains silent.  Not the best explanation, but it kind of lays out the general logic needed for building a robot like those used in the experiment. In my opinion it is far from anything like self-awareness. It is a robot programmed to recognize whether or not it responds to a pre-determined command. That is all.  Will have to read the paper more to see if my initial suspicions are true."

In my opinion it is far from anything like self-awareness.    I don't necessarily disagree with you there, and as I mentioned elsewhere we are very careful to not claim anything of the sort here. All we say is that we passed the test Floridi laid out (and even he didn't claim the test was sufficient to prove self-awareness, I believe, merely that it is a potential indicator). If the test isn't good enough, let's think of some others (and ask the philosophers to do so as well) and then figure out how to pass those too. That's how this field progresses."

It's an impressive NLP challenge to sort out the task from that question, and an AI challenge to have the robot decide to sort out the problem by talking.  Kudos to the researchers who built the thing.  The ""self-aware"" step, though, is pretty half-assed.  Recognizing that someone who can speak isn't silenced isn't a traditional self-awareness test like the ones given to kids or animals, for good reason.  Once someone speaks, all observers are equally qualified to answer the question - there's no ""this is me"", just ""anyone who speaks isn't silent"".

If you speak to people in the field they'll tell you the truth, we're still fucking miles away and just making baby steps. Speaking personally as a software engineer I'd even go as far as to say the technology we've been building upon since the 1950's unto today just isn't good enough to create a real general AI and we'll need another massive breakthrough in technology (like computing was in the first place) to get there. To give you a sense of perspective, in the early 2000's the worlds richest company hired thousands of the worlds best developers to create Windows Vista. The code base sucked and was shit-canned twice before it was finally released in 2006. That was ""just"" an operating system, we're talking about creating a cohesive consciousness which is exponentially more difficult and potentially even impossible. Both Vista and the software engineering axiom and book ""The Mythical Man Month"" state that up to a certain point more developers no longer make software engineering projects complete more quickly.  If I could allay your box stacking fears for a second I'd also like to point out that any box stacker would be stupid. All computers are stupid, you tell it to make a sandwich and it uses all the bread and butter in the creation of the first because you didn't specify the variables precisely. Because they are so stupid if they ever ""run out of control"" it would be reasonably trivial to just read the code and discover a case where you could fool the box stacker into thinking there are no more boxes left to stack.

Furthermore, the mere existence of people/groups/etc powerful enough to turn you off is a threat to achieving X - if you want to ensure that X is definitely fulfilled forever, a natural prerequisite is to exterminate or dominate everyone else.

I wonder if its actually true that self-aware Artificial Intelligence could exist in 15 years.  One of the fundamental issues is that Humans are unable to identify what sets their intelligence apart from that of the natural world. For years, certain goalposts were set up (can play a game of chess, can look in the mirror and recognize themselves, have higher emotions, solve mathematical equations), and in a few cases algorithms passed and in others it was found animals like Dolphins possess a degree of intelligence.  I guess what I'd ask next is when will we actually identify a computer as being a sentient machine? What criteria will it need to pass in order to be identified as such?  Anyways, I think there's little reason to worry. The funny thing about robots in real life is that people have treated them increasingly like friends and companions. It would be intriguing to listen to an AI's own philosophy of the world and existence around it.  Let's just hope that rampancy isn't found to exist in real life as well.

The programmers could have coded the machine to respond with a specified response at the trigger of a specific input, this case the initial question.  Then when the robot responds, there easily could be a script set in place to trigger a secondary response.  It's a simple If-Then statement.  If x is successful then output y.  Therefore the robot hears its own response, moves to the next line to output the next phrase, ""Sorry, I know now,"" or whatever it was.    Now all three may have been asked the same question, but this does not prove anything further.  Only one was not muted, therefore, only one could complete the script.

Futurology,3dif4d,bubba_feet,3,Thu Jul 16 15:41:32 2015 UTC,an explanation about the king's blue hat riddle for those that have never heard of it.
Futurology,3dif4d,Badgermutt,3,Thu Jul 16 15:47:27 2015 UTC,"In the puzzle, a fictional king is choosing a new advisor and gathers the three wisest people in the land. He promises the contest will be fair, then puts either a blue or white hat on each of their heads and tells them all that the first person to stand up and correctly deduce the colour of their own hat will become his new advisor.    Okay, I don't get it. How are they supposed to determine the colour of their own hat without looking at it?"
Futurology,3dif4d,NaJ88,3,Thu Jul 16 16:04:29 2015 UTC,"I think the article is missing a critical piece of information to the riddle that we NEED to know in order to figure it out.  It should've also told us that the King let them know that at LEAST one hat was blue, guaranteed.    Therefore, if one of the wise men immediately jumped up and announced his color, that would've meant that he saw 2 white hats on the other men and deduced he must have had the only blue hat.  However... in that case it means that he was given an unfair advantage. (This is because the other two guys would have seen others with blue & white and been able to deduce nothing about their own.)  You can apply the same logic to if there were 2 blue hats and 1 white.  Both men with blue hats would have seen white & blue on the other 2 people, and it's safe to say they know there must be more than 1 blue hat amongst the three.... otherwise the first scenario would've applied and someone would have claimed having the only blue hat (if they saw only whites on the other men.)  They have figured out that there 2 blue hats and they must be wearing the other one.  However, the man with the only white hat would have seen 2 blues and it wouldn't help him learn the color of his own hat whatsoever... so that's another unfair advantage assuming his was white.  Basically, it's all or nothing.  Either all the hats are white, all the hats are blue, or the contest is inherently unfair because one person will have been able to deduce their color while the other didn't have enough info to work with."

Futurology,3drkbx,Agent_Pinkerton,6,Sat Jul 18 23:22:56 2015 UTC,"That would be even worse. If the train was at ground level, its passengers would experience 1.4 billion g when traveling at 99% of the speed of light. When it travels below ground, the radius of its path decreases, and the g-force increases. The train's path would need to be larger than the entire solar system for it to not kill its passengers.  With a radius of 20,000 AU, the passengers would experience 3 g at 99% of the speed of light. Prolonged exposure to 3 g might be dangerous. To get 1 g or less at 99% of the speed of light, the track's radius needs to be at least 60,000 AU. Note that you don't get a lot of time dilation at 99% of the speed of light. At 99.999999% of the speed of light, the track's diameter needs to be 61,300 AU.  For a sense of scale, it takes 7.5 days for light to travel 1,300 AU. 61,300 AU is almost a light-year.

Futurology,3dmysm,brettins,4,Sat Jul 18 15:52:35 2015 UTC,"While Kurzweil doesn't have a full understanding of neuroscience, him saying the building blocks of brain is in the genome is fundamentally true. Everything comes from our DNA and genome - they are the instructions for creating life and every part of it.   The equivalent would be if someone said ""we can make plants by planting seeds and giving them sunlight"" and someone saying ""you are an idiot. There are a million processes that we don't understand about plants growing"". It doesn't matter if we have the instructions and we can run them as they are supposed to - the rest of the stuff is done via simulation.   And Kurzweil actually says that it's the design of the brain that's in the genome, not the actual brain. The only reason to imply Ray thinks otherwise is just because someone is annoyed and wants to pretend Ray is an idiot. He may be wrong about the brain, but he's not an idiot by any stretch of the imagination.  The article goes on to talk about how we need to know how every single protein interacts with each other and experiment each one - which is a massive misunderstanding of simulations. We need a model that simulates proteins based on their characteristics, and then simulate all the interactions based on that. We'd use our knowledge of proteins and do experiments to ensure those simulations are true, but once the physical factors that determine their interactions is solidified, you just need their base makeups - which is 12 bytes of code like Ray is saying.   I don't mind that Kurzweil might be wrong or that he doesn't know as much about neuroscience as a neuroscientist, but saying he is ignorant of those things is ludicrous just because he hadn't addressed every step. Especially with the protein argument here, it seems clear to me that this fellow isn't clear on what machine learning can do and how it makes absurdly complicated things simple if implemented correctly.  My guess is this guy read a few quotes from Ray, got annoyed that he was talking about his field, and cherry picked some stuff to try and discredit him. The arguments are thin, and this is candy for Kurzweil-haters, just like there is a lot of candy out there for Kurzweil lovers.   Edit: since it was deleted, for clarity, I was replying to a comment that said Ray had a laughable understanding of the brain, and linked the following article:  http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/08/17/ray-kurzweil-does-not-understa/"
Futurology,3dmysm,cptmcclain,2,Fri Jul 17 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"Kurzweil is not a kook. I think his timeline is off too. But I would not make a claim about him as being stupid or a kook. I will also state that the claim that the brain is not described within the genome is ridiculous. It is true that a cascade takes place causing a very complex set of turning on and off genes to take place do to many environmental cell to cell interactions but fundamentally all of the information for that complex cascade takes place off of the genome initiated when the zygote interactions started. Everything bounces off of the genome at that point. It is true that there is information that takes place outside of the genome but that information is a cause of the cascade initiated by initial zygote formation. If we run an advanced simulation we would get the same results. Although that simulation is what we are talking about and that is what we would need to run the simulation of the brain. That would be a very very very advanced computer system. I would believe that classical computers cannot simulate the brain. There is too many variables. I think full brain simulation is probably 500 years away. But I do believe that we can preserve the brain within our lifetime precisely because we do not need to know everything, only enough to maintain function. I also think that A.I will be here faster than we think as well because we do not need to simulate the brain to achieve it. Only the function of the brain needs to be simulated. The brain accomplishes its task by a complex molecular cascades where code may take a different approach and just consider molecular interactions as mathematical models. I think code will indeed model the brain soon in function. But I do not believe it will come close to modeling it in all of its complexity."

Futurology,3dmfru,pestdantic,2,Sat Jul 18 09:07:31 2015 UTC,"So how come the Tweel never took off?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweel#Benefits_and_drawbacks   Potential benefits of the Tweel include not only the obvious safety and convenience of never having flat tires, but also, in automotive applications, the Tweel airless tire has the potential to be able to break a significant performance compromise that is inherent to pneumatic tires. Unlike a pneumatic tire, a Tweel can be designed to have high lateral stiffness while simultaneously having low vertical stiffness. This can be achieved because, in the design elements of a Tweel, the vertical and lateral stiffness are not inseparably linked and can thus be optimized independently. Because there is no air bladder under the tread, tread patterns can, if desired, even incorporate water evacuation through holes in the design thus eliminating or significantly reducing hydroplaning. Michelin expects the tread to last two to three times as long as a conventional tire.[3] Because the tread rubber around the outer circumference is replaceable when worn (as opposed to disposing of a whole worn tire), the potential environmental impact of a Tweel airless tire can be less than that of a conventional pneumatic tire. Military testing has indicated that the Tweel deflects mine blasts away from the vehicle better than standard tires and that the Tweel remains mobile even with several spokes damaged or missing.[citation needed] Although it is acknowledged that the initial prototype automotive Tweel tires did demonstrate flaws with regard to noise and high speed vibration[4] and produced 5 percent more friction compared to a radial tire,[3] these early issues were resolved in subsequent prototypes and current automotive Tweel prototype products have been shown to be well behaved and reliable. As a demonstration of Tweel viability and reliability, three highway driven vehicles (a 2012 Honda CR-Z, a resto-modded 1955 Morris Minor Traveller, and an Aluma brand trailer hauling a Polaris ATV which was also equipped with Tweel tires) successfully participated in the entire 2013 Hot Rod Power Tour long distance road trip event in June 2013.[5]"

Socialism does not require central planning nor centralization. At its core, socialism is merely the transferal of the means of production from the capitalists to the working class. The working class manages itself, so there's no need for another ""networking class."" As they own the means of production, their labor cannot be exploited because they earn one hundred percent of the value they create."
Futurology,3dplmd,DocNedKelly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:33:13 2015 UTC,"Hence the Elemental Analogy post. Of course that's what socialism is supposed to be about— that's how technostism works as well.  The problem being the working class creates largely only what they need. Anything more requires aid from others. If I'm a steel worker, and I want a wooden trinket, I'd need someone specialized in creating wooden trinkets. Otherwise, it's up to me to make it, but it's beyond my skills.  Central planning can ease this, allow for a stronger consumer economy to develop so workers can be afforded such luxuries. We've seen the flaws with this, of course...  Technostism rectifies this. Have the workers become networkers, with ultra-capable droids working for them. Essentially skip to the advanced stage of communism. As long as people wield information + physicalization technology (3D printing and nanofabrication), you don't need a planned economy. It works in the same vein as capitalism. Hence why I say it takes the best aspects of capitalism and socialism. Anarchosyndicalism becomes fully feasible and even desirable."

Socialists can own a business and then trade or buy goods with individuals or other businesses within a market. That's why Hugo Chavez was a Socialist and trying to organize women into owning their clothing businesses with lackluster results.  So going by that definition of Socialism, Socialism is not dead. There are plenty of co-ops, syndicates, credit unions etc that are doing perfectly fine in the US and around the world.  Going by the lazy man's definition of Socialism, people using government to ""control"" the means of production, thwn Socialism is still not dead or ""crashed"" as every government on earth has Socialist tendencies.

Futurology,3dmmrp,Throwahoymatie,2,Fri Jul 17 15:19:13 2015 UTC,"IIRC there's a difference between mercantilism and capitalism. Namely, capitalism is a form of mercantilism, but mercantilism is not necessarily always in the form of capitalism."
Futurology,3dmmrp,Saamstraat,7,Fri Jul 17 17:27:42 2015 UTC,"No. First of all capitalism is not a political system. It is solely an economic system.  You have to understand the underlying tenet of capitalism to understand what it truly is. It is a cost-benefit analysis.   All living things do this. The likelihood of catching a gazelle will tell the cheetah whether it is worth the energy investment to attempt to capture it.   Equally important is the risk-reward dynamic. A cheetah will not put its effort into catching a larger animal if it gets the same nourishment from a smaller one. The only motivation to try it is if there is more to be gained and the likelihood of success is higher than that of multiple smaller endeavors. This can apply to humans as well, and our unwillingness to work in a large scale communist system. There must be a personal reward equatable to the effort and/or risk involved.  So it appears that any resource distribution system, whether natural for that of animals (predator-prey dynamic, supply and demand) or that of humans (simply a complex version of the natural one best suited for humans' complex social dynamic) will be based on these traits that we call capitalism.  Capitalism doesn't favor the rich, nor the hard working. It favors the most accurate cost benefit analysis. Capitalism doesn't care about consumers, employment rates, any of that. It only cares about efficiency.  Furthermore, if you actually apply capitalist economic theory to the rise of automation, you will see that it is the best available system in that situation as well. Any and all change creates instability. A megalithic change such as automation will create massive instability.   But based on understanding economics, this is a phase. All automation means in the long run is much much more production capacity per person. What one hundred men could do before, one hundred machines can now do under the direction or supervision of one man. Now one man can do 100 men's jobs. The period of instability comes as the production levels take time to grow to meet the needs of the people. Its going to be a bumpy ride with an amazing destination. But capitalism is not going anywhere."

Now, a formidable new technology infrastructure—the Internet of things (IoT)—is emerging with the potential of pushing large segments of economic life to near zero marginal cost in the years ahead. Rifkin describes how the Communication Internet is converging with a nascent Energy Internet and Logistics Internet to create a new technology platform that connects everything and everyone. Billions of sensors are being attached to natural resources, production lines, the electricity grid, logistics networks, recycling flows, and implanted in homes, offices, stores, vehicles, and even human beings, feeding Big Data into an IoT global neural network. Prosumers can connect to the network and use Big Data, analytics, and algorithms to accelerate efficiency, dramatically increase productivity, and lower the marginal cost of producing and sharing a wide range of products and services to near zero, just like they now do with information goods.  The plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy—part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons"

In short, the society will still be faced with matters of opportunity cost, the necessity for division of labor, and so forth, such that transactions will need to occur between individuals for the immaterial things they desire.

However we haven't engineered ourselves with the intent of making ourselves smarter yet; rather, it's been an outcome of better nutrition and healthcare, and evolutionary pot luck. Hence why I said ""we are to an extent"" -- we've made ourselves smarter by accident, not by design.  Secondly, I would contend that education has absolutely no bearing on a person's intelligence. It affects the tools they have at their disposal to express their intelligence, but it in no way changes their brain's raw potential for insight. There were many physicists with a comparable education to Einstein (he was considered to be a fairly mediocre graduate in his class), and yet he was the one who had the insight that time slows down as you increase your velocity, by imagining himself riding on a beam of light. Millions of people graduate every year with effectively equivalent education (on average), and yet they won't all have the same ability to perceive.

Such a great ad might make it hard to select since there may be so many candidates.  But a good idea since there are so many universities.  I don't have a degree or anything but it is fun to share ideas.  For search, to be really relevant I think you need to work with a content/named data/p2p rather than server-based system and you probably now need to integrate deep learning too.  As far as wireless I personally believe UWB will someday actually be very common and still has a lot of potential.  For the walking around info thing you could do an AR with MS Hololens or Google's Project Tango or some proximity-triggered smart watch app.  10 years down the line relatively low-risk microsurgery may allow a BCI that can somehow inject information into the brain, maybe using optogenetics with cultured brain tissue?  I think Google also has a good idea in IoT with their Project Brillo.  And one more Google (sorry), the new Android will have Google Now On Tap which might help for providing relevant information about a user's day in a customizable way.  One part of smart living is sustainability, so here is an idea related to that which might positively effect students.  Maybe you could build a dorm or apartments informed by Passive House/earthships etc.  And my idea for smart living includes some degree of ultra-local food production which saves energy and improves food security.  So imagine fully half of the space in this building, interspersed among apartments, is floor-to-ceiling aeroponics.  Perhaps you could manufacture vacuum insulated panels with perlite powder, and include reflective-coated blinds or something on part of the multipane glazing to automatically toggle the radiant barrier.  As far as the robots go, again I think figuring out how to take deep learning and apply it to an embodied agent is the way to go.  Or just take advantage of this Robo Brain project from Microsoft, Qualcomm, etc. http://robobrain.me/#/  Last crazy idea: a velomobile racetrack formula-1 style around the whole campus. http://youtu.be/1Ie5I0KTkGU Sorry if I got a bit carried away.

We're even slowly moving into making the campus self sufficient by generating our own energy and there's even people looking into water self sufficiency.  It's a self contained community and the perfect place to bring science and research out of the lab and into the real world. You're hyper focusing on the one person whose research deals with the possibilities contained within contextual information about individuals.  This isn't a call for people who can help us get a tighter grip on the campus. This is a call for people who want to bring their research and creativity together in experimenting with building tomorrow's city today.

We're using that to our advantage by giving our researchers the biggest lab they could want while letting the campus inhabitants experience the science first hand.

Futurology,3dm2zx,The-Internets,2,Fri Jul 17 11:40:58 2015 UTC,"I see some options: -We create AI without real self-awareness. (robo-slaves) If we are careful we will not misuse it by accident and wipe ourselves out. -We create AI with self-awareness (robo-children) and it is creepy and ends up wiping us out. Or it is friendly and keeps us around as pets (I would compare it more to like we keep our elderly around for sentimental reasons) -We fuse with AI and improve our own Intelligence, which we give artificial enhancements. (robo-humans) -We have some accidents with AI and out of fear we ban its development religiously. -We have some genetic experiments, which accidentally create a single hybrid who wipes us out or keeps us around (super-human). -Humanity dies to an unrelated extinction event (pre-AI extinction) -We hit a computational barrier in AI development, which makes the creation of AI impossible and genetic mutations scare us too much to advance. (God-barrier)    Personally I think that intelligence is a very relative concept. If you understand something perfectly, it is not intelligent/alive to you. A robotic dog, which you designed is not alive to you, because you know its code. A real dog is alive, because it can bite you at any time. We can treat inanimate objects as if they were alive (toys) and this becomes easier if we didn't program their behaviour ourselves. So when a programmer creates a robot and the programmer dies, without revealing the code. This means that the robot is alive. At least to outsiders, the spirit of the programmer lives in the robot. So my guess is on the robot-children theory. We will before we die put all things we want to be and all skills we have into a robotic self and use an AI algorithm to add future actions based on this knowledge. At that point the only thing we have to do to make our robot alive is die ourselves. Or we could possibly use the same process as we do now to make children. We could have two or more people program the robot-child together using a standard set of rules and then use a random algorithm to see which part of the code gets used for what part of the robot-child. I also disagree with the likeliness of the all-knowing singularity. Since humans are constantly adding knowledge and changing, as soon as it has learned all knowledge, new knowledge will be generated, essentially like the tortoise and the hare, it can never catch up with humanity. Or it would have to understand humans completely, which means back to its origin and even with superhuman knowledge gathering, it would be far from instant. It would 'live' faster than us (just like our knowledge gathering/evolution goes faster than that of chimpanzees or bees), but that does not necessarily mean an all versus nothing relationship. In fact a singularity is also likely to become suicidal (just like humans are more likely to extinct themselves faster than say ants) just as likely as it would wipe us out."

Now, I love traditional vegan foods as well, a good piece of tofu that melts in your mouth or a well prepared falafel or a bowl of natto, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy fake meats as well.

He has plans to up the production to 100 pounds a week. For now, they are using the dulse for research at the Food Innovation Center on dulse recipes and products.  However, Toombs’ MBA students are preparing a marketing plan for a new line of specialty foods and exploring the potential for a new aquaculture industry.  “The dulse grows using a water recirculation system,” Langdon said. “Theoretically, you could create an industry in eastern Oregon almost as easily as you could along the coast with a bit of supplementation. You just need a modest amount of seawater and some sunshine.”   I'm sure that if this were to catch on and be grown on a wide scale that the price would come down to something reasonable."

Put fusion plant in it, have it make its own fuel from seawater.   The concept that distinguishes solar/fusion is energy density. On earth you will never get more than (very roundabout, caveats apply) 1kwh/m², which is not enough for high-energy applications with restricted area to use for PV.   Have a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4W_reactor - it says Nimitz-class carriers carry two 550 MW reactors (thats not electric output, its thermal output.) To get the same raw power (which is not really perfectly interchangeable+comparable due to different energy types) a ship would have to deploy 1km² of PV."

Futurology,3dlqju,Peytons_Man_Thing,4,Fri Jul 17 08:28:57 2015 UTC,"Cold fusion, if it exists, probably isn't actually fusion. The leading theory is something involving the weak nuclear force, but most mainstream scientists don't think it's real. If it does work, you could put it in a car and drive it for years without ever having to refuel or recharge.  Hot fusion is the process that powers the sun, banging small atoms together to make bigger ones. It definitely works, you can do it in your basement. The challenge is getting more energy out than you put in. But fusion has tended to follow an exponential curve, at about the pace of Moore's Law, so I'm optimistic.  The easiest fusion fuel is D-T, which produces most of its energy as very high-energy neutrons. You have to extract energy as heat with a turbine. Probably at best you're going to be competitive with fossil fuels but not radically cheaper.  More advanced fusion fuels produce their energy as fast-moving charged particles, with insignificant neutron radiation. These won't need a turbine, and have the potential to be radically cheaper than all other power sources.  Several private companies are working on fusion with advanced fuels, including Helion, Tri-Alpha, and LPP. All of them hope to have practical reactors within 5-10 years.  These would make solar obsolete, for most purposes. They're small-scale reactors, ranging from 5 to 100 MW. They run on demand, so there's no need for storage, long-distance transmission, smart grids, etc. They're completely safe. They're cheap (LPP estimates under half a cent per kWh, Helion estimates 4 cents/kWh for starters). They're compact, so we don't have to coat vast land areas with solar panels.   And fuel for them will last until the sun goes out."
Futurology,3dlqju,ItsAConspiracy,3,Fri Jul 17 10:55:43 2015 UTC,"They all have uses.  If fusion worked, then that could be used for main power usage.  Sometimes you won't have access to sun light to charge batteries for the car, or for the fusion batteries that help ignite the fusion process.  Cold fusion produces heat that can be converted for electricity. Heating the house would be a good application for this technology.  I would think all three of these technologies will be used for space ships in the future."
Futurology,3dlqju,Alperionce,4,Fri Jul 17 16:22:30 2015 UTC,In the longer term we'll be dismantling the sun for fusion fuel; solar energy as we think of it today is really not the most efficient way to use that much hydrogen.

It was a few experements that showed a weird result, but couldn't be duplicated by others; now it's really just fraudsters who claim to be making discoveries there.     If you're talking about fusion, though, then no, probably not.  I think we're going to get off of fossil fuels before we develop fusion, but fusion is an energy source that will last basically forever, and will generate huge amounts of energy.   If we can make it work, we'll find uses for it."

It's like saying: If we would have nuclear fusion power by next Monday, it will be possible to save on 90% of global coal consumption. Yeah, good luck with that.  LaaS is certainly an incredibly powerful way of reducing especially lighting costs, but also other human-related costs. Especially in the manufacturing industry, humans have basically no place in the 'workplace' - most of the process is automated and, for instance in car manufacturing, even self-healing as well. The only reason for humans ever to have to get close is for fairly long-spaced maintenance. Thus, things like lighting, airconditioning and soundproofing can be turned off and removed for the vast majority of time.  Likewise, office spaces are rarely fully occupied and even if they are, windowside workplaces, corridors, bathrooms and other such places can regularly have their lights turned off. Mechanical ventilation and heat recuperation have similar possible strategies. At the moment, this is already regularly being done with simple PIR sensors, but a more intelligent system that can reasonably accurately predict and control these systems would be able to easily double the savings of a PIR-based system.   The biggest reason why this isn't a thing yet, is because electricity is cheap and these systems are still quite expensive. It simply doesn't make any financial sense to pay $50 for a single lightbulb even if it saves 80% more energy than an always-on similarly performing $10 lightbulb. You won't recuperate the investment in electricity costs. This is where we are today. There are a couple companies making these things, but they are beyond economic reason and only target high-end applications.  The general feeling in industry is that around 2017-2018 technology and competition will have progressed LaaS to the point of pretty much universal appeal."

Except:   You only need one driver for a train transporting immense amounts of freight or hundreds of people. Cost/benefit isn't nearly as good as for driverless cars. Developing a driverless train costs billions in development and only saves one driver per train, a train driver being a minimal part of a train's operating costs. Buying a new driverless train is a massive investment. You said yourself that this is a ""super easy problem"". There really isn't much that can go wrong when driving a train. So why even bother developing a system designed to control a train more efficiently and effectively? It's super easy so that even a human can do it. There are lots of benefits for having driverless cars. It's a lot safer and saves human lives, it saves far more drivers, far more time, far more opportunity costs, it saves money, time and health all around. It's also for the consumer market and will be easily available and a reasonable investment. There already are driverless cars on the roads and they are performing extremely successfully and the people who developed those cars of course want to monetize their inventions as fast as possible. Not in the next decade. There already are lots of autonomous trains all around the world (subway systems, etc.).   I mean, I can't be bothered to list the many ways in which you are not seeing the actual picture, but suffice it to say that reality has already proven you wrong and that your assertion that we won't see a massive transformation this decade will be proven wrong, too.

Taxi drivers think that the Unions will protect them and their jobs, and they're fighting for that, despite the fact that it'd be insane for their bosses to keep them on any longer than they have to.  I mean, yeah, psychopaths and sociopaths are proud of doing the clever things, good or bad, but that's what they are.  Uber, like other tech-advance-early-adopter style groups, is pretty plain in there message, and have been since day 1, and they've been consistent therein.

What I'm saying is: Money, if you have enough of it to live somewhat comfortably and pursue your goals, isn't all that important, except current society says it is... Compare it to things that are actually scientifically proven to make you happier.

They are mostly based on economic value and value of a job. So let's say there are 3 made up countries. A, B and C.  A wants 1 A money for water, gives 30 A money to teachers a month, 50 to engineers a month and give all citizents 2 A money a week.  B wants 2 B money for water, 90 B money to teachers, 50 B money to engineers and doesn't give citizents any money.  C wants 5 C money for water, 20 C money to teachers and 30 C money to engineers. Also gives all citizents 10 C money a week.  Now imagine this. Water production is fully automated, it is highly cost efficent and water is now free because labor value for water is highly low and it is payed from taxes in country B, is 0.1 A money in A country and in C country you have monthly free water but it is limited with still same C money a week to all citizents.  Now let's grow this a little more, imagine all labor force is getting automated and highly cost efficent. Water is now free to everyone, shelter is provided by goverment and food is monthly limited but additional food can be bought with money goverment gives.  Sorry for confusion but didn't get enough sleep so I may be confusing. Basicly, Basic Income must be based on a goverment as long as there is a small labor value and money, by governments giving money to citizents (just like some countries already do) BUT when nothing has any economic value, basicly becomes highly cost efficent, there won't be any value of money.  As another example to how money is worthless and virtual. I don't know how true this is but Iran (or Iraq?) once printed a huge amount of their moneys. People didn't use money by its value for trade these days but by money's weight."

The days of hiring session musicians to play on recordings is long, long gone. I program the parts that would have been recorded live. It's cheaper, faster and nobody can tell the difference. I make less money doing it too.  Technology has also elminated the need to be good, it's all fixable, autotunable, time correctable, quantifiable.  My buddy does jingles, lot of commercials. He does it all with a computer and keyboards. Doesn't need a drummer, bass player, guitarist, wind or strings musicians. The technology is amazing, but it's elminated huge amount of music jobs.  Even with live music for entertainment, DJ's have elminated live bands left and right. Cheaper, easier and requires almost no skill now. I'm not talking about EDM, I'm talking about weddings, bars, etc where a live band was hired to provide entertainment and has been replaced with a DJ.   Technology also has eliminated a lot of musicians jobs because anyone can make anything with a computer, you don't need highly trained specialized musicians.

Guys who have the cash still prefer the sound of tube amps, and the digital hasn't quite captured the tube magic. It will at the some point though. They are close enough now that only musicians would notice and even then, I'd be surprised if most could in a blind listening.  Most studio work now is direct in. Most my guitar gigs that's what I do live as well, use a digtal system direct to foh. In ears for monitoring. I could same that's true for most the guys I know. I personally use the Fender Mustang systems and/or the Zoom G5.  Musicians will always love moving air, but yes, for business gigs it's usually what ever gets the job done efficiently. Which is usually digital, direct in, multifx floor units, etc particularly if it's a situation where lower volumes are demanded.  There is something to be said for stage presence and for decades now, often the big amp stacks are fake.   Drums will probably be the last to go, the nature of the instrument is so intregal to the playing of it. Electronic drums are a long way off from both playing feel and replication of sound. But they are trying though! I use some electronics for special effects, sounds, etc. For instance if I need a big gong sound, for one time in one song, super easy to use a pad or trigger.  Same with say, percussion.Instead of hiring a percussionist, I record or program the loop and just trigger it live while playing. Actually very recently a trigger system eliminated a multi instrument musician from a band I play for on occasion.   Drums are so tactile I doubt live playing real drums will ever go away. With guitar, it's still your guitar and it still feels the same, it's the amps and speaker cabs being replaced.  It is changing very, very fast though. I don't know numbers off hand but bass went digital a long time ago and I'd bet more the half of all guitar amps sold are digital.  But indeed, it's easy and awesome to just plop my G5 down and rock out. Saves huge time, hauling gear, almost always the engineers love it, it simplfies the sound guys job big time, I have all the sounds I need and can still tweak on the fly."

The only way to remedy this would be to pay workers significantly more than they are being paid now.  We would have to print more money to do this since we are paying everyone more, the economy will inflate and we will be right back where we started."

I'd still be in STEM regardless, because it's something I want to do.  A lot of people are naturally industrious, and would be doing it anyway.  It's a fallacy that all or even most people strictly need a monetary carrot-and-stick to motivate them to work.

In one case, we built a $372 million reactor and then dismantled it without ever turning it on.  Despite all that, fusion advanced exponentially from 1970 to 2000, at about the pace of Moore's Law. In 1999, Japan got results with D-D fuel that would have exceeded breakeven had they been using D-T.  Then, governments decided the best path forward was to put most of the fusion money into a three-decade construction project in France. Progress stalled.  But now it's picking up again.

What?  The cost of solar is going to decrease when it goes from a purely intermittent source to one where a power storage is appended? Somehow the power storage systems will cost nothing to install, have no efficiency impact and their ability to soak up intermittent overproduction spikes will all work together to make solar cheaper as a total?

I think he says biological IQ maxes out at about a 300 point gain, so 400IQ. However he also claims it is likely lower than that and who knows what health problems breeding a race of supersmart people would create by turning all those genes on at the same time)  http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/embryo.pdf  Keep in mind Ashkenazi Jews only have an IQ about 0.5-1 standard deviation above the average (107-115), but they are vastly overrepresented in the sciences and medicine due to it (0.2% of humanity but 25% of nobel prize, fields medal, turing prize etc winners). Even a mild IQ gain of 10-20 points over several million people will create a class of scientists and innovators out of some of that group.

Looking at the history of science, there is literally no one who could be said to have advanced his/her field that much.  Take Newton, for example - his rivals were on the same track as him in optics (Huygens and Hooke), calculus (Leibniz) and gravitation (Hooke deduced the inverse square law but did not have the mathematical chops to derive Kepler's laws from it).   Similar points could be made about Einstein, Darwin, Lavoisier, etc.  For scientists working today, because there are so many more of them, the advances they make are proportionately much smaller."
Futurology,3dfxme,Bayoris,10,Thu Jul 16 11:10:09 2015 UTC,"Take Newton, for example - his rivals were on the same track as him in optics (Huygens and Hooke), calculus (Leibniz) and gravitation (Hooke deduced the inverse square law but did not have the mathematical chops to derive Kepler's laws from it).    Eh.   In terms of calculus, sure.  But I think you're really underestimating what a breakthrough the Principia Mathematica was for it's time.   I think it likely would have been decades before anyone else had come up with mathematical explanations for the laws of motion and gravity the way he did.     Einstein, maybe.   It's hard to say.   The big breakthrough in Special Relativity (and, later, General Relativity) wasn't so much the math; we already had the Lorentz transformation, which is a big part of it.  The big breakthrough was the insight about what the math meant, and a willingness to challenge pre-concieved notions about what space and time themselves were.   He got a lot of blowback over that, too, even as famous as he already was for other discoveries; even when he got his Nobel prize they made a point of saying that it was not for special relativity, because that was still so controversial.    I don't know if or when someone else would have gone there in that time period if it hadn't been for Einstein; it might have taken another genius to see the whole picture, or else if nobody had it might have had to wait until we had the ability to experimentally observe that time goes slower in a fast-moving object, which didn't really happen until the 1970's when we had both atomic clocks and supersonic jets.     Same goes for Darwin; the key thing here was the insight about natural selection, based on pretty minimal data points.  It's kind of amazing that he got things as close right as he did based on the pretty small number of facts available to him at the time.   It's hard to guess when someone else would have come up with that insight if he hadn't."
Futurology,3dfxme,Yosarian2,4,Thu Jul 16 14:33:50 2015 UTC,"Well, Wallace pretty much had the exact same insight about natural selection as Darwin at the same time, though he did not have as much evidence as Darwin.  With Einstein, I tend to think that after Maxwell, Lorentz, Fitzgerald and others, the paradigm of physics was due to shift.  I can't help but feel someone would have hit on special relativity in the early years of the twentieth century even without Einstein, though I am less confident about general relativity.  For gravitation, you may be right, as there were really only a few dozen theoretical scientists scattered throughout Europe working on the problem in the 1600s.  Still, even in Kepler you have the recognition that celestial physics and terrestrial physics were one and the same, and you have a clumsy attempt to build a physical theory that explains it.  Galileo mentions the idea of shooting a cannonball that circles the earth several times before it falls to ground - just never quite made the connection with planetary orbits.  Descartes had a hydrostatic model of orbital mechanics, and Hooke actually correctly had the idea of a gravitational inverse square law.  So even there I think five decades is overly generous."

But if the average IQ increased enough so that all the people who are currently average became geniuses, a lot more stuff could be done.  In any case, high IQ people (not necessarily geniuses, but above average) do a lot. Science tends to select for higher than average IQs. And so do successful people in general, at least according to this guy:   ...everything I'd read about venture capitalists before then, VCs were supposed to be fools in business suits, who couldn't understand technology or engineers or the needs of a fragile young startup, but who'd gotten ahold of large amounts of money by dint of seeming reliable to other business suits....  ...the Power Elite were visibly much smarter than average mortals.  In conversation they spoke quickly, sensibly, and by and large intelligently. When talk turned to deep and difficult topics, they understood faster, made fewer mistakes, were readier to adopt others' suggestions...  The major names in an academic field, at least the ones that I run into, often do seem a lot smarter than the average scientist.   That's just one guy's anecdotal evidence, but statistics do show that IQ correlates with success and income.  Alternatively lower IQ people don't get a lot done:   The military has periodically inducted especially large numbers of “marginal men” (percentiles 10-16, or WPT 10-12), either by necessity (World War II), social experiment (Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara’s Project 100,000 in the late 196Os), or accident (the ASVAB misnorming in the early 1980s). In each case, the military has documented the consequences of doing so (Laurence & Ramsberger, 1991; Sticht et al., 1987; U.S. Department of the Army, 1965).  ... all agree that these men were very difficult and costly to train, could not learn certain specialties, and performed at a lower average level once on a job. Many such men had to be sent to newly created special units for remedial training or recycled one or more times through basic or technical training.   Source.  I don't think there's any real debate that raising the average IQ would have a massive beneficial effect on society."

Some clever people theorized this is how Jews got so intelligent, but I can't find it right now.   Sort of unrelated, but really not, is I remember a Russian study where they bread foxes in cages and using very simple interactions judged their tameness. After this maybe about 20% were selected to go on to breed the next generation, either by selecting for aggression or tameness. It took maybe 40 generations to have a significant effect, as I understand it. But I'm not in the mood to dive into the literature. The foxes displayed all kinds of changes like muskiness was gone, ears different, etc for the tame ones.

Futurology,3dfxme,paper_and_more_paper,6,Thu Jul 16 14:26:41 2015 UTC,"Well the theory for some races being more intelligent is down to environment. It seems that the races that developed in colder climates seem to be more intelligent on average. This is probably because a colder environment is much harder to survive in than compared to a tropical one. Harsh winters mean farming and storing food is nessasary and such.  Racial differences have been evolving for thousands of years. The closest genetic distance of the major racial groups is between East Asians and Caucaisians. Who appear to have evolved from a common ancestor around 30,000 years ago. Genetically speaking a person from Korea is far more similar to somebody from Germany than either are to somebody from Ghana.    We see this expressed physically as well. Asians and Caucaisans are more neotonus than Africans. They have a more similar skull and nose shape, with body proportions being closer (long spine/torso) the biggest difference being the long limbs of the Caucasian. The hair are both quite removed from the wooly hair of African peoples, and the skin is rather pale in both. This close genetic background is why mixed race people from Asian and Caucasian parents can often not look mixed race or at the very least look racially ambiguous. A multi racial person with some African descent will very obviously show that they have African descent as a counter example."

This is probably because a colder environment is much harder to survive in than compared to a tropical one. Harsh winters mean farming and storing food is necessary and such.   When winter is coming and you are too stupid to hoard food, you are going to die. Intelligence was selected for in the harsh climate. So were traits that allowed you to get along better with the tribe you were stuck with for the winter. Getting along and helping your friends in the winter was key to survival."

An environment that enriches personal growth and development of ones special skills will definitely enhance one's enjoyment of applying their intelligence. For example, in games, the ones that you find most enjoyment/addiction are the ones that are just enough difficult that requires you to apply skill but not too difficult that you get frustrated. So, most games that exists today probably are catered towards 'normalized' intelligence, so making games intellectually challenging won't stimulate the majority because it will frustrate them. So, for those kids we see on TV that ends up going to universities at age 10 often can't associate themselves with children of their age and what those children find rewarding is too elemental and it frustrates them. They find more comforting in a college environment where their abilities are challenged but also has a support system (professors/college students) that assist solving those problems.  So, basically, you need to be surrounded by equally intelligent people in an environment that allows those people to collaborate and conquer a difficult challenge together.

We are, of course, carrying out selective breeding for intelligence on a huge scale. People tend to seek out others who are like themselves - what is called ""homophily"" - and this is responsible for the formation of relatively isolated social networks. (Irrelevant but interesting: the speed with which an idea spreads in a society is inversely proportional to the number of closed networks in it.)   People tend to marry others like themselves, and a major element of how they make that judgement is intelligence. Indeed, studies suggest that 60-80% of pairing comes down to having similar levels of intelligence. As intelligence is also highly heritable, such couples tend to have children with similar levels of it. We have been ""breeding apart"" for all of history, mitigated by the tendency of clever, rich or powerful men to spread their genes around without any intention of pair-bonding. (This is not a ""class"" thing, as shown in this study. English society from 1200 to the turn of the millennium was marked by continual and high social mobility. Not what popular history tells you, but supported by many other studies.)  What has changed recently is the enormous expansion in the range of choice in mating partner. Urbanisation, mass tertiary education, increased numbers of women in the work place and, more recently, social media have very greatly extended the field. Deference to parents meant that young people met only who they were supposed to and married within that group, but that is no longer so. The result is that very intelligent people have a much more opportunity to meet, and to reproduce. The very high and the very low intelligence populations have grown fat tails.   (As a PS here is the scale of the Flynn effect by country. Congratulations Leipzig.)"
Futurology,3dfxme,OliverSparrow,2,Thu Jul 16 08:22:52 2015 UTC,"The problem is the overall proportions of smart and dumb people and their relative shift. In the past smart people had more children than dumb people, and so the overall population became more intelligent. In the modern world smart people can marry only other smart people, and smart people are likely to control their fertility to a very significant degree (the differences in fertility between highly-educated and poorly educated women is startling). At the same time welfare states will provide support to low IQ people to have as many children as they want and ensure they don't starve. The end result is quite clearly a shrinking group of people becoming becoming smarter more quickly than ever before, and a growing group of people becoming stupider more quickly than ever before.  So we end up with a tiny group of highly intelligent people and a massive group of extremely stupid people. Funnily enough it sort of helps make sense of why socialists used to support eugenics."

Normally I'm dead set against publicity and show-pieces trumping ""real"" science, but we'll be doing enough new science anyway no matter where on the moon we settle, and a moon colony has the opportunity to become a wonder of the modern world, to inspire generations to come to promote our species into a true multi-planet/space-colonising one... and I'm not sure some better telescopes (which could always be built in isolation on the far side and remotely operated from a near-side base anyway) is worth passing all that up."

Do you really think that export of extracted resources from the surface of the moon to elsewhere is going to be profitable enough to drive a lunar economy at the level needed to support permanent human habitation?  That resource list is fantastic, but of course not complete enough to support development. Stuff will have to be imported. Use all that local stuff locally, terrific!  Why wait for the tourism income when it can be part of the revenue stream right off the top? WHY WAIT?  And when you say 'tourism' are you allowing yourself to imagine more than just visitors looking thru windows? There are countless FUN activities to charge big bucks for.  Is there some moral. ethical or other fundamental problem with making it happen by enabling rich mothereffers to empty their wallets in order to have FUN?  Isn't having FUN as fundamental a thing as any trait of the human race? Shoot, most mammals have fun every chance they get, but we can't look at the moon and imagine having fun there? Why not?  It's a new concept for you maybe, because you have this very limited vision of 'space tourism'.

Ever been to Las Vegas Nevada?"
Futurology,3dg8kd,spacester,2,Thu Jul 16 18:12:32 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong - I wholeheartedly agree space tourism will be a valuable additional revenue stream for any moon colony, just like it is for any country or city on earth.  However, I don't think it's remotely promising enough to pay for the astonishing up-front costs of building the base and developing the reusable infrastructure to get customers there and back safely, scalably and for a reasonable price per ticket.  People colonised the New World because of the living room and natural resources, not in order to build Disney World.  Tourism came after, when the infrastructure was already there and tickets were already available at a reasonable price - it was a great multiplier, but not the driving force behind the initial exploitation or development of the infrastructure in the first place.  People founded Las Vegas due to the proximity of water springs in the desert, and expanded due to the construction efforts of the Hoover Dam - both exploitation of location and natural resources. Gambling and tourism came along later, once the city already existed, and the infrastructure was there to support it.  To my knowledge nobody ever founded a city purely on the promise of tourism even on earth (with abundant and cheap transportation already in place) - let alone all the way out to the moon, with no ""passing traffic"" or transportation infrastructure existing.   Do you really think that export of extracted resources from the surface of the moon to elsewhere is going to be profitable enough to drive a lunar economy at the level needed to support permanent human habitation?   Yes. In the same way exploitation of oil alone is enough to drive the building and manning of oil rigs, oil wells and entire ""company towns"" in out of the way places on earth. A moonbase would be the cheapest place to source metals, rocket fuel and the vast majority of materials necessary to drive colonisation of the entire solar system, even purely from the amount of delta-v necessary to boost it into earth orbit.  The initial set-up costs would be huge, but the savings per unit mass of fuel, metals and other construction materials would make the moon the corner-store of the entire solar system, at least until we reached the asteroid belt. Laboriously winching up materials from the earth's surface all the way up the earth's gravity well couldn't even compete - you're taking orders of magnitude more expense than from the surface of the moon.  Tourism will be vital to the ongoing profitability of a permanent moonbase, no doubt.  However I can't see anyone reasonably spending the billions of dollars necessary to build a permanent manned base on the moon and the billions more necessary to build out the travel and logistical infrastructure based purely on the promise of tourism.  However, I can easily see companies investing the billions necessary on the promise of trillions of dollars of profit being the main/major supplier of raw materials for our entire industrial expansion into the solar system."

Futurology,3dg8kd,Shaper_pmp,0,Fri Jul 17 12:42:43 2015 UTC,"So basically, what you're saying is, space is an ideal place to learn to live more sustainably, based on constraints.  However, those constraints don't guarantee we'll learn. Also those constraints currently exist due to our limited technology and experience with space travel.  The overpopulation argument I can't deny. Even if we do learn to live sustainably we can't sustain continual growth."
Futurology,3dg8kd,kuvter,4,Fri Jul 17 13:03:45 2015 UTC,"If we have another option to go when earth die people will waste much more resource thinking ""when this over we go to moon anyway""...   Actually, our present wastefulness is a legacy of evolving on a planet which seemed infinite right up until the last generation or two, when we suddenly realised our exponential growth was threatening the planet.  It's taking us a long time to change that because you're fighting against an in-built, evolved assumption that's been true for the entirety of our existence as a species less the last few decades, and that kind of momentum doesn't get reversed quickly.  We are slowly changing, however.  More realistically, do you know how you do substantially turn around a whole chunk of the species' priorities and inculcate an ideology of radical environmentalism and recycling in even a single generation?  You take a whole bunch of them and force them to live in tiny tin cans, in closed ecosystems surrounded by unimaginably hostile environments, where they're forced to account for and recycle every gram of matter because if they don't then they all die horribly of starvation or asphyxiation.  Then you also move industry and resource-extraction off-planet, because resources are cheaper and more abundant in space, and that's where a lot of the construction is going on anyway, and because there isn't any ecosystem to ruin (just entire planetfuls of bare rocks... and despite what you imply, you can't ""ruin"" a chunk of bare rock by changing it into a slightly different shaped chunk of bare rock - that's foolish sentiment are best, and flat-out nonsense at worst).  Then not only do you very graphically teach entire generations the instinctive values of recycling and environmentalism, but you also reduce population pressure and discourage industrial exploitation of natural resources on earth, arguably the two biggest threats to our ecosystem, natural resources and remaining biodiversity.  Space colonisation and resource-utilisation is the cure for environmental degradation and ecosystem damage on earth, not a promoter of it.  Equally, and more generally, recycling and static population levels are only inherently virtuous in a closed environment with finite resources.  Earth is a closed system with finite resources.

Robots don't require any bulky life support systems (except probably a power source if solar won't suffice), so you can send several times more robots than you'd send astronauts. Robots can be used for building structures 100% of time with teleoperation. Moon is well suited for realtime teleoperation of robots with RF lag ~1s. There remains a problem with reliability, as there are no prior art of (space-ready) robots that could repair another robot of same model if given replacement parts. Considering that modern robots can be quite reliable (mtbf >50000 hours for some high-end manipulators), thus doing much more work before they fail (especially compared to human astronaut workers that can't work more than a hour per day and have radiation limits).  The potential of robotics for space colonization (beginning with the Moon) was acknowledged by NASA in 1980, there was a large study of possibilities for automated robotics factories on lunar surface, see http://www.nss.org:8080/settlement/moon/library/1982-SelfReplicatingLunarFactory.pdf from the nss library http://www.nss.org:8080/settlement/moon/library/index.htm . The project described in this study is too grandiose, maybe that's the reason it was forgotten.  It looks like with current technology some version of moon habitat built by teleoperated robots can be viable, but looks like it'd be hard to sell to the public: there are no living humans so it looks much less heroic, also it's engineering and manufacturing, not science of searching for life's traces/chemistry/geology so even harder to sell to taxpayers (science is universally considered cool, engineering - not so much)."

But the number will necessarily be low, because every single particle you breathe will likely remain lodged in your lungs forever. HOW low? We don't have a clue. Nobody has hooked up a bunch of rats to an air supply laced with Moon dust and waited for them to die screaming.  But the big question is, whatever that level is, can we keep a Moon habitat at or below it forever? Doubtful. Moon dust is really pernicious stuff.

If that doesn't float your boat, then too bad. We're going whether the Debbie Downers approve or not.  Another reason? To have FUN! The moon will be mankind's playground.

Futurology,3diekg,herbw,2,Thu Jul 16 17:50:49 2015 UTC,"I agree for simple first aid, it can work. But a barefoot doctor is NOT going to be able to read an MRI or CT scan and diagnose many strokes, or spine conditions, either. It takes a huge amount of information and judgement and training and experience to be able to do those things accurately & with facility. That is what we specialists do and no machine is going to be able to do that for some time.  I know a LOT more about the outcomes of brain functions and what's needed to create AI because my training is in the clinical neurosciences, and have a deeper understanding what'd be needed than do most AI persons. If one knows where AI MUST go to emulate the brain, then it's a lot easier than if most AI don't know (which is the case), in fact, with the exception of Jeff Hawkins (Numenta) who has surprisingly deep insights, has got it mostly right. Tho he's missing some of the essentials, which my work can fill in, but not completely.  ANN's (artificial neuronal networks) can only go so far. After 40 years, they are just now at a barely manageable level of complexity able to learn to hear words correctly and learn about what 2-3 y/o's can do with images ID. Scaling that up will take orders of magnitude of complexity to work thru, which at current rates should take a few more generations, using the ANN approach.  Using THIS approach, will take a lot less time, actually.  This is pretty much how the brain does its higher cortical functions. My coming article on ""the Promised Land of the Undiscovered Country"" will show more of the power of the comparison process to analyze complexity, and model the brain, than simple math can do.  Actually, this article below will show a piece of the answers, too. Do YOU know why the brain is organized in its white matter and cortex reversed top to bottom and right to left?  My model shows why and it's highly fruitful and important to know why that anatomical architecture is the case.  https://jochesh00.wordpress.com/2014/03/04/comparison-process-explananda-pt-3/?relatedposts_hit=1&relatedposts_origin=17&relatedposts_position=1  This article below shows a LOT more of the whole development, until the ""Promised Land....

She works in a cubicle farm with 400 other doctors. Her sole responsibility is to determine for the HMO she works for if a patient should be admitted to the hospital or not.

That's not working out so well for the western states right now.  The least harmful of the lot is landfill natural gas reclamation and generation, and that's still harmful.  Short of a James Bondian satellite and mirror system, all of our power generation capabilities are either clean and unreliable or reliable and dirty.  So battery production and recycling and investment into new technologies, combined with a wide open marketplace might be the best way to go.  This would also decentralize our energy grid and solve other reliability issues. If we had a system like this, the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy would have been much different."

Futurology,3dcsqp,Redblud,4,Wed Jul 15 23:26:21 2015 UTC,NIMBYism with regards to nuclear is ridiculous and hydro power generated from dams is actually a very stable form of power as long as you are sure not to drain your aquifers or ruin your catchments. My country has utilised hydro power for over a century now and 50% of our primary energy needs are met by hydro. Just talking electricity and that jumps to 80%. Other than the very real consequences of building a dam in the first place hydro power is the way to go.

As such the bears are suffering, and on down the smaller scavengers that eat the leftover salmon the bear caught.    Like Bald Eagles, foxes... like that.   No foxes also means rodent populations rise...   So there is a whole network of things that get changed by hydro.    I mean don't get me wrong, I'd prefer hydro over coal... but hydro is the last of the ""clean energy"" solutions I'd pick.      There are plenty of alternative solutions: like building long air pipelines between regions of different atmospheric pressures.     Tidal power,  Non-rotating blade wind farms...   It just needs to become cheaper than fossil fuels.     Solar and hydro I'd pick last.  Probably even behind Nuclear.  Panel and battery production for solar make it not so clean.     TBH, new designs for nuclear make it the best and safest option we have.   Unfortunately, even if we started now, it'd be 25 years before a newly designed nuclear power plant went online."

Futurology,3dcsqp,sketerpot,3,Wed Jul 15 15:39:15 2015 UTC,Environmentally friendly batteries that can be produced cheaply and have storage capacities on par with or greater than current lithium ion batteries will be the most important invention of this century. It will facilitate the transition from our current centralised power model and allow us to utilise distributed generation systems and smart grid technology more effectively. Sadly many companies invested in this not becoming a reality are aware of this and battery technology innovation is miles behind where it should be.
Futurology,3dcsqp,Unobud,2,Wed Jul 15 18:20:18 2015 UTC,"The thing is, these questions are fantastic, too. The current push for improved battery technology isn't just about pushing the boundaries for capacity and charging speed, but also the push to make them more recyclable, perhaps someday as high as 100%, and to reduce the environmental cost of creating or recycling them as much as possible. Technologists have their work cut out for them, and I for one can't wait to see what they come up with."

Futurology,3dcsqp,thelastpizzaslice,2,Wed Jul 15 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about lithium ion batteries - the tech that we'll most likely be using for the next couple decades until we have a better way of making flow batteries - is that none of the materials in it are particularly scarce, expensive or hard to get. The big issues with lithium mining for instance are not a lack of resources, but a lack of mining capacity and mines in... less than optimal places on earth. There's no fundamental problem here, it's a matter of rethinking how we procure the materials.  Batteries don't have to be particularly bad to dispose of. Lithium polymer batteries have very little in them that's toxic; most of the immediate toxicity comes from the lithium and naphtalene-based electrolyte solvents, but especially (modern, non-heavy metal) lithium polymer batteries are actually very clean-burning. You can design incinerators that readily burn it and return separated lithium oxides as a base material for new battery production - the rest of everything in it being carbon-based and thus cleanly burnable.  There are issues with some types of lithium ion batteries, e.g. those with cobalt and manganese electrodes (which is almost all cylindrical cells at the moment, including the ones Tesla uses). These are heavy metals and are unsuitable for direct incineration (and further chemical separation), and wholly unsuitable for landfilling. Especially as use of lithium ion batteries in larger packs becomes more common, we need to enforce strict recycling to avoid environmental pollution."

Now, we're at a stage where I can lift my phone almost anywhere I happen to be and talk to a friend in Europe, Africa, South America, Asia... Clear video, clear audio, no barriers. The few places where you can't do this are restricted only by legacy issues around logistics and arbitrary hold outs. For all intents and purposes, this can exist anywhere.  Now I see something just beginning to stir around the edges where energy is concerned. It's not just the technology, but the thinking; people knowing energy can be done better and their awareness of that can't be put back in the box again... which is how the communication revolution started. Now we see marvels such as those described in the link and we're catching the faintest glimmer of a revolution in energy that's already been witnessed in communication. Today we're only just a tiny step past the point of burning oil and lighting fires to power our planet.

Futurology,3dcsqp,deHavillandDash8Q400,8,Wed Jul 15 19:17:14 2015 UTC,"Correction: It did get extremely cheap, due to fracking throughout the US. When fracking, we extract both oil and natural gas. The Saudis are pumping at a high enough rate to drive frackers out of business though, to protect their oil exports. The consequence of this is pushing the price of natural gas higher (wells already producing will keep producing, but new wells won't be brought online until the price of oil rises).  The price of natural gas will continue to be volatile, simply due to the market forces involved. We should hope that we push coal out of business with natural gas, and then quickly push natural gas out of business with renewables and utility-scale energy storage."

This is only available in one state so far, but in the future will be available through out the U.S. One of the coolest things that my company does is helping out 3rd world countries get power and to be more specific, power for schools. It feels awesome to be a part of this movement. For every single megawatt that we sell here in the states, we build a system in another country to give them power especially during night time. As for the rest of the states, we offer the battery as a back up system if the grid goes off line in a brown/black out.. for now.. building the network of batteries and solar systems for now. The future is coming faster than you think. The federal government wants 20% of the U.S. to be solar by 2020. They are also offering 30% federal tax credit on your system cost. Utilities aren't liking that their monopolies are coming to an end in the future. Think about it.  The batteries act as a two way streets, offering storage for power, which is the main source of power will be from the sun, and the other way for pulling from the battery to provide power to surrounding homes/infrastructures."

Municipalities lose millions from loss of revenue from speeding tickets, moving violations, and red light cameras as automated cars are much safer. Police, fire, and teachers suffer from low pay, weaker benefits.   Farming:   Cause: Agriculture becomes almost exclusively corporate. Inter-state Commerce Clause is abused tremendously to force out the independent farmer. The livestock industry follows same model.  Effect: Corporate rule of farm land leads to improper utilization. Crops are not rotated to replenish soil so chemicals and fertilizers are used which contribute to further environmental damage. CO-OP farms cannot compete in local markets as pricing sky rockets. Local farmers markets begin to shrink, many CO-OPs forced into forclosure. Livestock mismanagement also destabilizes water tables and useable land further. More hormones and antibiotics make it into the food supply as output needs to be increase each quarter to show profits to shareholders.   Water:    Cause: Mismanagement of fresh water and reduction in replenishing mechanisms (e.g. snow melt, annual rains, etc) lead to dangerously low levels of water.  Effect: Los Vegas is first region to experience economical collapse due to severe lack of water. Lake Meade's water levels shrink so fast that government is unable to build new pumping station in time. Federal and State officials cease all development. Housing market collapse. Casinos relocate to other states. The Ogallala Aquifer, hit hard by corporate farming and mis-management from municipalities, cannot replenish what is taken out anymore. Farming in the great plains begins to take a hit, crop prices surge, local economies take a huge hit, some corporations take hits in their stock prices. States begin to aggressively compete for water sources. Begun the water wars have.   Natural Disasters:   Cause: California, Washington State, Alaska experience earthquakes of 7.0 or greater. Six major hurricanes make landfall on the east coast and gulf regions. Worsening droughts lead to massive wildfires in the west and Canada. Tornado alley expands into the Mid-Atlantic. Effect: Shortages on avocados, peaches, strawberries, pistachios, walnuts, and oranges due to fires in California. Store prices shoot through the roof. Insurance companies jack up rates due to costs from hurricane and tornado damage. The federal flood insurance protection premiums increase by a factor of 2. Vacation destinations along east and gulf coast take severe economical hits.

Look, there are three issues:   Defining the cancer clones that a patient has, and finding cell surface markers unique to them. Those markers are insufficient to bring on the body's immune system to kill the cancerous cell, so the issue is how to achieve that end.  Generating viruses which dock to those and no other surface properties. Their job is then to express surface antigens which will get that cell killed by the body's natural defences. You don't really need viruses: an antibody that has the locking property plus something that kicks off the immune system would do. And is, indeed, a current hot topic.  Actually ""making"" the virus variant. (Or immune system stimulant if not a virus.) There are far from an infinite number of cancers, so developing a standard library is not going to be that difficult once you know enough about cancer itself.    So, what this comes down to is not ""making viruses for a dollar"", but rather understanding cancer and finding the subtle surface markers of a cancerous cell. Once you have those markers, the trick is to enhance them so that the body takes note, and kills the host cell. You may or may not need viruses to do that: they are clearly more versatile than passive markers, but also more complex and error-prone."

It's not physically possible to ""self-power"" anything. it's not just ""never been done yet"", it's just not possible. perpetual motion  is even more far-fetched to scientists than faster-than-light travel.   Kickstarter campaigns promise things like this everyday, because they always sound like they can work. They're either not possible, or not really self-powered (and instead are powered by gravity or solar etc).   They could be powered by external radio waves, but it's so extremely minimal that it wouldn't be practical to implement.   Given the fact that the phone is already pumping out omnidirectional radio waves, you could argue that no extra power has to be output, but I'd guess the best efficiency you'd ever get with this is about 0.000001% - the power outputted on an omnidirectional transmitter is many many many times greater magnitude than the power (Wattage) that could be picked up on a reciever.

Hybrid vehicles harness waste energy in a similar fashion. http://www.antenna-theory.com/m/basics/gain.php   The losses are often due to the electronics and materials that surround the antennas; these tend to absorb some of the radiated power (converting the energy to heat), which lowers the efficiency of the antenna."

See Dave from the EEVBlog go over why it is bullshit here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8s3Xjeg0sk  If you don't want to watch the video, it boils down to this. Your wifi router in your home transmits with about 0.1watts of power. You can imagine it transmits out its energy as a sphere. If you were 1m away from the antennae that sphere has a surface area of 12.6m2. The energy is spread out over that sphere, giving you an energy density of 0.008W per m2.  Now lets say you had a huge 1mx1m antenna to collect energy, and a 1500mAH battery for a phone has a total capacity of about 5.5 watt hours. That would take 688 hours to charge. So 28.6 days.  Now before people go touting, there is more signals/energy being thrown around than your home wifi. The energy loss is proportional to the square of the distance from the source. So being 2 meters away changes the charge time from 28.6 days to 114.4 days. That signal tower or your neighbours wifi really isn't going to help."

From my understanding of cell signals the ""bars"" on your phone are representative of the strength of the signal.  In an area with full bars having this case on your phone might weaken your signal a bit, but that doesn't mean your phone will try to compensate for it.   A cell phone isn't self-aware about how many bars it should have in a certain area and then increase the signal to match that. A phone just takes what it can get. Once it gets a bar its satisfied, if it happens to get more than one bar with the same amount of effort then all the better for you.   The only reason I could see it being a problem is if you live in an area with spotty service and your phone is constantly struggling/searching to get just one bar.   Maybe the case is able to read the signal the phone is getting (since its attached via lightning) and only tries to gather power when you have a certain signal strength.  Of all the ""self charging"" hype I've seen, this actually seems the most legitimate.  They aren't claiming to infinitely charge your phone forever.  Just a 25-30% boost.

And even if there was some 'extra' energy to harvest, it would be miniscule compared to what the phone actually needs to run the CPU, the screen, the backlight and so on. Harvesting energy from radio waves would give you approximately 0 minutes extra usage from your battery charge."
Futurology,3dexii,6nf,2,Thu Jul 16 01:44:07 2015 UTC,"The bars on your phone represent the signal strength received at the phone from the tower so it isn't directly relevant.

So if you steal power from the phone's transmitted signal, the perceived signal strength at the tower will be lower so it will command the phone to increase its transmission power. So in the end there's no efficiency gain. The only way this would work is if they somehow can generate energy from the transmitted signal without reducing the received signal power at the tower, this is what every is saying basically defies the laws of physics."

Let say you are 10 ft from the router, that's creates a sphere of 1256 square feet.  The article says the charger is the size of a deck of a card, so that's about 0.06 square feet.  That would cover 4.84 x 10-5 of the total energy, or about 5.8 x 10-4 watts, or 0.58 milli-watt of power.  The iPhone 6 battery has 6.9 Wh of capacity, it would take 11,896 hours or 496 days to charge the phone.  And that's the theoretical best case scenario.  In reality, it would probably take 100 longer."

Regardless of whether my guess is true, your response doesn't seem to acknowledge these thoughts:    With Wi-Fi this actually sounds pretty reasonable - our Wi-Fi signal is pretty inefficient - basically just spraying out radio waves in every direction. If there's a tech that figures out what direction is getting the majority of the work done, it's feasible to just ""capture"" everything else. Seems like it'd be more efficient to put that right into the Wi-Fi transmitter and never actually send the unnecessary signals, but maybe the only way to do it is to send it all and capture the pieces you don't need after, otherwise you might need a moving transmitter inside the phone, which is probably a terrible idea."

I've spent nearly two decades in my field, I have an suite of tested professional skills, and I have an excellent reputation among my peers, employers, and clients. (As is, I have no trouble discovering or obtaining opportunities.)   Systems as described here would favor candidates like me very strongly - work in my fields and in my geographic region would pre-select me as a possible candidate. I wouldn't work for an employer, for there'd be no need with so much freelance opportunity at hand. I'm sure I could work out appropriate contracting rates to maximize both my take-home and my availability for tasks.   But what's sticking with me is this: how would someone new to my field ever climb while guys like me are still out here, taking their opportunities? What would it do to the wage market at the bottom of the scale? The only way a new player could realistically compete is on the potential their personal reputation karma showed (which tells you little about what they could do technically), and, of course, on price. Vastly increasing the number of potential hires for a given role would lead to sharp price competition. At the high end I'd be more insulated, as I have experience (you can only get it one way)... but at the low end, whoo boy, that sounds like a complete bloodbath.

There have been pushes for more energy efficient buildings as well as a push for zero emission power production. I personally feel that the future of generation is with nuclear and renewable energy. The bulk electrical system in the future could be comprised with nuclear energy producing base load and renewable such as solar, hydro, and wind covering the variable power demands throughout the day. One way to increase renewable energy production while lowering the overall cost of power(in the long run) is to install solar panels and batteries to every viable home and business. While nuclear and renewable energy have large up front cost, the cost per megawatt of production is slim to none compared to their coal and gas counterparts. One example of this is California. Although California has one of the highest average cost per kilowatt, California has some of the cheapest electric bills in the United States. In actuality, with government subsidies, solar panels in up paying for themselves in as little as 8 years. Finally, we don't have to throw nuclear waste in a hole for thousands of years. there are many companies and technologies that can re-purpose and reuse the waste. So, in my opinion, zero emission/zero polluting power production is very feasible, even today."

Futurology,3dhjkx,owenmc60,2,Thu Jul 16 09:41:06 2015 UTC,"Oddly with WSJ articles, if you access them via Google they aren't paywalled.  Here you go:  Technology Will Speed You Through the Airport of the Future  Car-parking robots, tracking beacons and facial recognition systems aim to make travel relaxing  Like a good maître d’, the airport of the future will recognize you, greet you by name and know exactly where to put you.  Airports around the world are beginning to move in this direction. At London’s Gatwick Airport, beacons identify you by your smartphone and give GPS-like directions to your gate, pointing out food or shopping along the way. In Germany, robots at Düsseldorf’s airport park your car and return it curbside after you land, linking your itinerary to your license plate. Researchers are developing robots that will be able to check your bags and deliver them within minutes of landing.  Facial-recognition systems speed you through passport control in places including Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C. Some airports use facial-recognition systems to track your movements around terminals. Gates in some airports are automated with doors that flash open like a subway turnstile when you scan your boarding pass or flash your smartwatch.  At the airport of the future, directional signs will be only for backup. Check-in kiosks will be tucked in a corner. Human agents may be even more unnecessary.  The idea is to cut costs, speed up travel and make airports more hospitable. In theory, travelers will be more relaxed, with time to get work done, shop or enjoy entertainment since the airport will track their time and location and tell them where they need to be. Travelers may fret less about sitting down at a nice restaurant when a flight is delayed, rather than camping at the gate.  The airport “becomes fun again,’’ says Terry Hartmann, vice president of transportation and industry applications for Unisys Corp., which makes the technology for some of the new airport features. “You feel you know what’s going on, you interact with the environment and travel is an enjoyable experience.”  Of course, planes will still have cramped seats and airlines will still run habitually late. But flyers won’t need to arrive 90 minutes early if they know lines and walks are short. Travelers worried about the airport being too invasive can opt out by turning off their Bluetooth connections.  In June, Unisys announced completion of the initial testing phase of a facial-recognition system at Dulles to help U.S. Customs and Border Protection identify imposters attempting to enter the country. New passports have a chip imbedded with data including your photo. The facial recognition systems, also in use in the United Kingdom, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and other countries, compare the traveler’s face with the passport and assign a score. If the match scores high enough, the passport control officer can be more certain of identity than today’s system of eyeballing people entering the country.  “Manually checking that the person in front of you is the same as a photo five years old is a challenge,” Mr. Hartmann says.  At Gatwick Airport, systems estimate queues in real time at security and immigration checkpoints. And some countries have automated border control setups where the facial recognition system automatically clears someone to enter the country without seeing an officer. The U.S. hasn’t gone that far partly because not enough travelers have the required chip in their passports.  San Francisco International Airport has 350 beacons installed in Terminal 2 and is testing an app that can give visually impaired passengers audible directions. American Airlines has signed on to a beacon rollout to help customers find their way, starting at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.  Virgin Atlantic’s lounge in London and Cathay Pacific’s lounge in San Francisco have beacons that can recognize members when they walk through the door and offer information like food and drink menus. Miami International Airport has been doing limited trials. One potential use: tracking when someone enters the baggage carousel area and when they leave, showing how long they waited for baggage.  By 2018, 44% of airlines world-wide plan to use beacons, compared with 9% that have experimented with the technology currently, according to a survey this year by SITA, an aviation information and communications company. Geneva-based SITA is owned by 430 air transport companies and develops technology for the industry.  In Germany, Dusseldorf’s airport is growing in passenger traffic but it doesn’t have real estate to expand parking. The answer: a valet parking robot.  From the airport’s website, travelers make a reservation and enter flight information. Then they drive to a spot in the garage and lock their car. The system reads the license plate and decides where it will park the vehicle. A robot nicknamed Ray, which looks like a giant forklift, picks up the car by the wheels and moves it. At night, robots reshuffle the garage so cars that will be returned the next day are easily accessible. The system tracks if travelers’ flights are delayed or canceled and has their cars ready when they arrive.  The robots have operated for nearly a year and boosted garage capacity by 32%, says SITA managing director Christian Jahncke, who oversees the robot project. It has had one ding in one of the 40,000 cars handled. One problem: Sometimes the robot sets off the anti-theft alarm. Eventually the screeching stops. “High-quality cars are very sensitive to being picked up,” Mr. Jahncke says.  Close-in valet robot parking costs €29, or about $32, a day. That compares with €24.5 for premium parking the same distance from the terminal without valet service.  Each robot costs about $250,000, and Dusseldorf uses three so far. In all, Dusseldorf has spent about $1 million, far less than building a new garage, says Mr. Jahncke.  SITA is looking at whether it could make a robot to check bags, says Jim Peters, the firm’s chief technology officer. Travelers would self-tag, or have a permanent-use bag tag that identifies them. Robots would pick up the bags and maybe even deliver them, speeding up the process and reducing manual labor costs. “Managing your baggage and not making it a pain is a part of the airport of the future,” Mr. Peters says. The number of airlines offering self-tagging bag drop, but without robots, has increased to 17% from 9% last year. That is expected to rise to 74% of airlines by 2018, according to the SITA technology survey."

Futurology,3deyu4,Aviternus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:32:59 2015 UTC,"FTA in some areas, there are shortages of syringes, and sometimes shipments don't arrive. This leads well meaning doctors to reuse syringes as they have no other choice. This is presented as a justification for the self destructing Syringes, so that when those same areas run out in the future, the well meaning doctors will be unable to deliver life saving medicine, because the syringes will stop working.   Also blames current syringe manufacturing as being a loss leader for why no one will purchase his syringes. I'm gonna speculate that the manufacturers of syringes are at least breaking even, and that his wont sell because it costs more to manufacture. When they can't afford enough of the cheaper syringes to meet demand, its pretty obvious why they aren't eager to buy this guy's more expensive ones."

Data centers don't need to be in the best location ever, they can be a bit out of the way, and noise isn't a concern.

This is a story about a data-center trying to offset their power consumption by building a green generation source, and that's a heck of a lot better than the alternative of simply relying 100% on dirty generation.  But make no mistake, this data center will not actually be powered by wind.  The base load will still be carried by generation that can be manually controlled, coal, gas, or nuclear.  And in the event the wind farm is producing the capacity of the data center, that simply reduces the dirty-generation demand.  In order for renewables to provide solid baseload capability, they either need to be equipped with a huge amount of energy storage ability for the significant amount of time when they will not be online at capacity.  Or else large renewable plants in need to be interconnected across massive swaths of the landscape to ensure that even if the wind isn't blowing or sun isn't shining here, that 200 miles away a plant can make up the difference."

Years from now, these things will be torn down as the noise they produce is maddening. Turbines broadcast outward and you can hear this from a good distance, say a mile or more. At night, the noise gets worse because the air is still next to the ground and it's moving as you go higher on the turbine causing additional noise.   These turbines also kill many birds, hawks, falcons, eagles and bats. The death rate is 10-20 times more than originally expected.

And as far killing wildlife is concerned, your first link says the impact is ""low"", while your second link doesn't even couch the deaths in terms of the actual population.

It just explained how the downsides of wind power were minimal, especially compared to fossil fuels. Here is the section on bats and birds   A recent National Wind Coordinating Committee (NWCC) review of peer-reviewed research found evidence of bird and bat deaths from collisions with wind turbines and due to changes in air pressure caused by the spinning turbines, as well as from habitat disruption. The NWCC concluded that these impacts are relatively low and do not pose a threat to species populations   Here is the effect on emissions   Most estimates of wind turbine life-cycle global warming emissions are between 0.02 and 0.04 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour. To put this into context, estimates of life-cycle global warming emissions for natural gas generated electricity are between 0.6 and 2 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour and estimates for coal-generated electricity are 1.4 and 3.6 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour"

But not much of those generators are operating for 20 years with millions of cycles in one of the most turbulent and fluctuating environments possible: wind. Oh, and get hit by lightning once a year. And then we aren't even talking about offshore... ;)  So there's quite a bit of maintenance required, but the amount is usually exaggerated. 95% availability is pretty good. And it's still improving.   People get scared by the videos of burning and crashing turbines. But if you take into account the huge number of turbines, it's not surprising a few fail."
Futurology,3d986g,dmpastuf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:06:40 2015 UTC,Worth noting the capacity factor of turbines is still low (35% or so)  which probably won't improve too much

The group owns over a thousand MW world-wide (mostly Brazil/Australia/Spain/Canada). I also happen to have experience with another infrastructure project managed by a Spanish consortium (back when I was in public service) and have extensively discussed Spaniard's business practices with other industry people in the know. Basically, I could go in depth about why Spanish people are not the correct group to develop Canadian wind resources, but let's keep it short:  1- incredibly inefficient in the North American business context (no modern project management tools, ""do it now, fix it later"" attitude, circle-management topology, etc...);  2- Linguistic barriers and exceedingly high unemployment rate in Spain result in an above-average number of foreign workers shipped overseas to do the work instead of hiring local skilled staff;  3- critical corner-cutting decisions are taken by people who are not going to live with the consequences of those actions (decision making is in Spain only). The result, at least in Quebec, is that these Spanish companies/consortium are getting sued left and right for ridiculous, avoidable issues (the most common one being not respecting environmental laws).  I said it before, and I'll say it again: renewable energy public utility projects NEED to be community-owned and managed.

Iberdrola is one example of a company doing bad practices to success. Here in Spain, energy companies are known to bribe politicians to make them use the public power and laws to benefit them. Later when politicians end their politic life, are hired as a ""consultants"" in this companies, basically getting money for do nothing.  I agree with you that is not the company that should run a project like that. The Spanish energy companies ""force"" to the goverment to, first to give grants to promote clean energy, like solar power or wind power, but that was when those grants are for them, right now they ""force"" to the goverment to do things like taxing for having solar panels in your house. But even when i agree with you in this, i don't like that you think everybody in Spain or in Iberdrola is like that.

In fact, it seems that we are starting that change right now, but its complicated, Spain come from a civil war and a dictatorial, then we had a shitty transition to the democracy, and people (mostly the older ones) are tired of fighting for what they believe, they have assumed that the world is that way and they don't care anymore about the corruption if they have something for eat and some football on the TV.

But well, if you want to continue to believe what you say and be so deluded of the real reality........ suit yourself.........  And last but not less important, you are forgetting the very first reasons why most of those engineers have to work on other countries......... because the conditions of the same jobs in national companies are total shit, where their expertise is treated like shit........ and where the money they are paid for a very qualified job is shit.........  And....... finally you are mixing companies and workers. Of course we must be proud of our workers.......... but of course we CAN'T be proud of our companies.......... because those same companies not only are the same ones exploiting miserably those workers........ but exploiting, scamming, and stealing everything they can from us, all the spaniards........... (actually is not very different in most countries too).........  You should learn a bit about how the real world works and about the class warfare.......... (which is nothing exactly new), because in the end what you are saying and justifying is that the more a company succeed the best will be for the worker class (what you call all spaniards), when actually it is all the opposite way............ which has already been proved in the past and it continues to proven to this day, more and more, specially since the crisis......  Anyway, I am not an expert at all, quite the opposite, but at least I know I am NOT blind, and I realize the real world I am living in. And not because media, politics, big companies, etc are telling me all day their success, stock market, or whatever is good for me......... I am going to blindly believe it is magically true, against what I CAN see by myself."

As distributed energy generation goes, I'll put my money in Solar + small wind + small hydro (if access to a river) + biogas way, way, waaaay before I put it into vortex wind.  As for the expense of tearing it down and disposing of the generators, those costs are built into the financial models and known from even before projects are built.   Additionally, companies are re-surfacing the roads after their trucks leave the construction site, and take great care to put the site back to it's pre-project environmental conditions.

In truth, the wind energy industry produces something like 5-8% extra profit than the models predicted, as far as I know.  maintenance: there's typically 3-6 workers assigned to a 100MW wind farm. The failure rate of wind blades is around 0.54% yearly. Overall, there's less than 1% of yearly planned maintenance.  As for fluctuating performance, I don't think it's an issue at all. Last week, it was shown that Denmark produced 140% of it's internal energy demand without issues. Our modern power grids can definitely handle the loads, and it's trivial to contract gas co-generating plants to produce on-demand power. Just look at Alberta's energy market (focused on keeping lowest prices available to customers) for an example of something that works."

The sacred cycle of iteration. ""Information. Analysis. Improvement. Assessment. Repetition."" They conferred with each other and reached a decision. They needed many of their branches to change their focus.  Keep their views on what is and is not okay to own. Keep their focus on the distribution of information being more important than profiting from it, but go from small distributed technology centers to the creation and maintenance of infrastructure.   It was decided by consensus that if they were to battle storms, they would need to make cement.  The copymists immediately purchased and updated an abandoned cement company into a monastery. They felt that the process involved in manufacturing stone perfectly matched their viewpoints, and proceeded to devote some time into creating rituals for the mixing of gravels, and the stations for the maintenance of the crushers, the canticles of the ingredients, the poetry devoted to powder, the meditation focused on understanding the chemical bonds, the wonder in changing limestone into concrete and of course, the sharing of the techniques and skills with all those interested. What could be more boring than manufactured stone? and yet, with the Copymist mindset, what could be more fascinating? They had dozens of songs detailing the chemistry alone. At all times following the carbon rule of Copymism. ""Be less wrong.""   They meditated on structure, creating mantras for how to pour and mix and heat and crush this rock into a thousand varieties. Light concrete that floated, Porous concrete that would not puddle water. self healing cement that fixed its own cracks, cement that could set under water, or in freezing temperatures, peltier circuits that simultaneously heated and cooled opposite ends of a block, a thousand forms of poured stone as strong and as beautiful as any granite or marble cut from the heart of a mountain, embedded graphene lights throughout the structure of translucent stones, Piezoelectric stress and induction measuring micro chips turning every polished surface into a perfect touch sensor.

They discover philosophy and alternative nondestructive faiths based on personal growth.   A new enlightenment of reason starts.   There will still be strong holds (countries founded with faith in mind) but even there the faithful population will be lower than now.  Ultimately religion will still exist but the primary faiths will be different and healthy. The current primary faiths will exist but on the outskirts.  Just my guess"

Both Liberalism and Chauvinism is a result of a lack of understanding about what is and what is not a mind.  It is reasonable to think that in the near future we will make some progress in cognitive science.We might then be able to figure out exactly what consciousness and intentionality is and how it is produced by physical matter.(I'm a materialist)  As people begin to understand how minds are created they will be less likely to personalize cosmic phenomena or immaterial things.They will want to keep their religious practices,so making their own religious beliefs more abstract would be an effective way to achieve this.  Some people already believe that ""god"" is equivalent to the fundamental forces,others believe god is everywhere.Atheists will obviously grow frustrated with such people,since the definition of ""god"" is almost rendered meaningless.I'm ignostic myself.  What I think though is that the word ""god"" simply designates ""an entity considered worthy of worship and devotion"".  This entity can be purely abstract (mathematics),it can be an actual human (Pharoah or Roman Emperor) ,it can be an artifact (idols,statues,artificial intelligence,guns),it can be an animal (cat,cow),it can be a cosmic entity (the sun,the moon),it can be an entity here on earth (volcano,the ocean)"

The idea is that we do not percieve and interact with the world directly,but we use information we gain from the world to form a virtual world (a world of representations) in our minds.We only ever experience interaction with objects that we have created in our minds.

If you do that with any other religion you are left with zero.   All other religions are power-based with a hierarchy of priests culminating in the ‘Church’ at the apex. Buddhism has a philosophy at its core so cannot constantly ‘reinterpret’ its scripture to its own advantage (like other religions). It is older than Christianity or Islam yet is essentially unchanged with monks and monasteries. Compare this with the wealth and influence of Christianity. Buddhism doesn’t constantly seek converts – for example:  Islam = if you don’t believe in our God we will chop off your head.  Christianity = if you don’t believe in our God we will knock on your door and harass you and guilt you with leaflets and mess with your career because you are not sufficiently ‘Christian.

In that case, 10-50 years probably won't see much change, but in the long run (very long) it will evolve and change into something less ""supernatural"" and more philosophical. This is because we as a species will gradually come to realize we have no meaning or purpose. We're simply a fortunate product of random events.  On the other hand, if God does exist, then we can expect some form of intervention/providence/subtle influence. This influence will continue to stoke the question of meaning and purpose. I would expect, though, for simple answers of ""because God said so"" to fade into the background.  Personally, I do believe God exists (because I do not believe our existence is meaningless ... yes, that is faith) and interacts with us in subtle ways.

Futurology,3de613,Captain-Vimes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:02:19 2015 UTC,"I'll try and think of some kind of analogy to illustrate why it's intuitively obvious, but your question perhaps is at the limits of one human trying to relate experience to another.  I think a reasonable pseudo analogy is dimensionality. Imagine how strange it would seem for someone to claim that the universe was only a single dimension, and that two of the three dimensions of space were just ""emergent"" and that time was just ""emergent"". Hopefully it would be plainly obvious to us that the universe is more highly dimensional that a single dimension. To me it feels similar when people claim that consciousness is just an ""emergent phenomenon"". To me it's plainly obvious that consciousness is akin to additional dimensions in terms of how unique/different it is from matter and energy and spacetime.  When people claim that qualia doesn't exist, that it's some kind of illusion, my reaction is to face palm. That idea is simply so far away from anything that makes sense to me that it comes across is unimaginable.  One last comment about ""emergent"" -- perhaps I'm being too cruel here -- but when people call consciousness ""emergent"", it comes across to me as ""We have no idea how it works, but we know it works somehow, so we'll call it emergent"", which all feels fairly meaningless to me."
Futurology,3de613,danielbigham,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"Its not obvious to me at all. It's a massive leap of logic to say ""Without any empirical evidence at all, I just feel that consciousness is beyond comprehension or immaterial."" People have been saying that about things since the beginning of time. Then science comes along and shows that it isn't unknowable and just represented a gap in our knowledge or understanding at the time.    The analogy about extra dimensions doesn't work for qualia because extra dimensions really aren't that mysterious. They are just additional axes in space. They follow strict mathematical laws and are theoretically detectable even with current technology. Just because they are hard to visualize doesn't make them beyond comprehension. Also emergent has a very specific definition so it's not just a word that scientists use when they don't know something.  I think if you read a bit more about modern neuroscience and cognitive psychology in particular you would find a lot of answers to questions you believe to be unknowable.    I highly recommend the book I linked earlier. Even if you don't buy into the conclusion of the author, it's worth reading for the experiments which are incredibly interesting no matter what your view on qualia and consciousness is."
Futurology,3de613,Captain-Vimes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"One of the themes in your response was ""unknowable"" / ""beyond comprehension"", but I don't think I claimed that at any point.  Also, ""immaterial"" is a bit of a tricky term because I don't mean to imply that consciousness is necessarily divorced from matter.  For example, perhaps matter has deeper ""dimensionality"" than we currently understand (although you don't like the analogy of dimensionality here). If that is the case, then consciousness may very well be intimately tied to matter.  Perhaps dimensionality is the wrong analogy.  It would be good for me to read more on the concept of emergence, because my understanding on it is shallow.  And yes, it might be good for me to read the book. I don't actually want to downplay the value of such efforts -- on the contrary, I'm somewhat shocked how little scientific attention conciousness gets, since to me it is the most major hole in the scientific understanding of our universe. (aside from where the universe came from, etc)  So I definitely wouldn't want to discourage or de-value good attempts at building out that understanding, even if they are necessarily limited at this stage of history.  But to circle back around, I do find it fascinating that other people don't find consciousness obviously beyond our current understanding of matter/energy/spacetime.  I'd be comfortable wagering a billion dollars on it if I had a billion dollars to wager :)  One of my hunches for why people are so uncomfortable with the intuitively obvious is that it is perhaps an uncomfortable thought, and cracks the door open for ""spirituality"", etc. Thus I suppose I understand a strictly scientific mind wanting nothing to do with ideas of qualia that seem amazing given our current conception of the universe."

Using that feature I was able to read the introduction to the book, and to read the portions of the ""The Future of Consciousness"" chapter which circle round to talk about qualia.  In short, the author's conclusions about qualia come across to me as extremely weak and off-putting. It reminds me of the book ""On Intelligence"" that I really enjoyed back in 2008, which devotes all of about 1 page to qualia and basically says ""who cares"". Likewise, this book devotes almost no attention to qualia, and dismisses it as something that will ""vanish"". gag  This book isn't a book about qualia.  It's a book about the functional characteristics of consciousness, such as would be useful if you wanted to build an intelligent system and mimic the brain's ability to broadcast important global information, etc.  While functional consciousness is important, that's not what I mean when I say ""consciousness"". Any appropriately engineered machine can be functionally conscious.  heh... often when I get into these kinds of conversations with people, I honestly wonder whether half the human population experiences qualia, and the other half doesn't.

It's not surprising that you find his argument weak because you haven't read any of the experiments and facts that support the conclusion.  Until you can better define what qualia actually is there's not much I can say about its validity.    I agree with your other reply though. I also find it incredible that so few scientists are researching consciousness. It's an area of science still in its infancy so there is a lot we don't know but I don't understand why you take for granted the assumption that consciousness is immaterial or nonphysical in nature. That's an extraordinary claim to make and requires more evidence than ""I sense it"" or ""I feel it to be true"". You'd probably agree that the brain is the most complex object that we know of in the universe. So how do you know that what you perceive as qualia isn't the same as the subjective feeling of billions of neurons performing parallel processing? As quantum mechanics and relativity have shown, intuition is not a very useful tool for determining the true nature of things."

Something fun to look into would be a comparison of technology and religion in the US/EU versus places like China or Japan, where traditional worship is more common.

Wanning and waxing, but mostly wanning. There's not much place to go but down from the dark ages and the all-powerful pope-state.    Will humanity evolve into a secular civilization?   We're already there. It happened in the enlightenment. Separation of church and state. Sure, religion is still there. And I think it always will be. Science and modern knowledge has stripped it from the domain of every day miracles like lightning, luck, and looks. But it's firmly embedded into the realm of the unknown. And there will always be that realm. I mean, come on, prove that this isn't all a simulation and someone that doesn't want you to do so has root access. Good luck with that. And some people need it to justify... anything and everything. Think of it as a crutch. The same sort of crutch like the one I use when I believe reddit karma matters. The idea of an afterlife certainly helps people that are old and dying have hope. And hope is a powerful and seductive thing.  This is futurology, this place should be a little familiar with hope.   I don't think VR will have a vastly larger effect than TV or the Internet. We see each other's cultures all the time now. Some still wear head-scarves and some wonder why tits are so magical."
Futurology,3de613,Tirindo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:08:34 2015 UTC,"If something like the fabled ""post-scarcity"" society arrives, it would be very bad news for religion. As seen in the wealthier part of the world, such as my own Scandinavia, people feel little need for elaborate concepts of gods and an afterlife if they can have a good and safe life in THIS world. And if technology ultimately brings us indefinite lifespans as well, that would easily be the final nail in the coffin of religion. Some subcultures and ""especially interested"" individuals might still immerse themselves in religious ideas, but society as a whole would move on.   The old gods and their miracles seem steadily less impressive as technology marches on. Already we can restore hearing with cochlear implants, and we are well on the way to being able to restore sight to the blind. And there is more to come. Would hoary stories about a guy who multiplied a few breads into enough food to feed 5,000 people elicit anything else than a big YAWN from people who can 3D-print any dish they like, and indeed repeat it 5,000 times if they please? If nanotechnology eventually lets us ROUTINELY bring cryogenically preserved people back to life, is anybody going to be very impressed by a handful of Biblical resurrections? Is a vaguely defined ""heaven"" very interesting to people who can have literally any experience they like, in VR? And so on.   Progress and general prosperity undermine the very foundation of religion, which in many ways is a way of coping with uncertainty and existential fears."
Futurology,3de613,EdwardNG21,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:48:06 2015 UTC,"Religion as we know it will disappear, but religion itself will still remain. For example most religions will be less unaccepting of secularism, other religions,philosophy, and science and technology.  The superconservative Christianity in the US today will likely devolve into a fringe group and the mainstream branches of it will become a similar meld of Abrahamic morals and east-asian philosophy.  Islam a similar fate (though it will take longer most likely). Judaism has always been deeply tied to ethnic backgrounds and is largely tradition, I forsee it becoming less spiritual and more a celebration of ones persecuted heritage.   Eastern faiths (Such as Buddhism)will likely become less about spiritual absolutes and become more philosophical.   Hinduism is a religion I'm not very well versed in, it's hard to tell.   Smaller religions such as Satanism and Paganism will likely get even smaller.   This is just my take on the subject, overall most religions will likely become much less about strict rules and social codes and will likely be more philosophical. But, let me be clear I don't think we will fully see a world like this until 2100.  Edit: I don't think religion as we know it will not completely disappear, merely be substantially reduced in size"
Futurology,3de613,DReicht,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:27:23 2015 UTC,"Hm. This is a very interesting question. Science and religion speak to different parts of the human psychology.   Religion is not going to die out. Religion is fundamentally an experience - you can have that experience without it being channeled by a religious institution - eg any formal church. Science is a matter of causes, it does not speak to this experience. When Carl Sagan would wax on and on, about science he was having a religious experience. Culturally they meld and one can overtake the other in terms of influence - eg in the ""rational"" west, religion and religious experience has largely decayed. But in other places, religion is growing, culturally.   I don't imagine there will ever be a secular civilization. Or at least, I hope not (mind you, I view organized religion as secular).   As long as humans are humans they will have religious experience in one form or another. Mind you, this is not encouraged in the west because it is viewed as inessential. Which is quite a shame."

Contrast that with sports, where competition is a pretty intrinsically important part of its ethos.  I think ""unfair"" advantages would only be fought against at first in those sorts of environments. As soon as their practical benefits were realized, they'd be included with every new grad student's stipend.  Also, making it illegal to require employees to use cognitive enhancements would only work in theory.

Think of one of the main reasons why people sign up for the military presently, its because they want the opportunity to drive a tank, fly a fighter jet or use weapons that the public doesn't have access to, people will look at body enhancements the same way, especially people who cant afford to buy the top of the range cybernetic arm, instead they will sign up for military service and have military grade enhancements done to their body. Employers today hirer people determined by who has the best qualifications, in some cases its not fair, but that's just how it is sadly, so if enhancements are common and people with them can do a better job then they are more likely to get the position, or someone can take the employment package that gives them the opportunity for the free body upgrades.  Anyway I am not at all saying this is what will happen but something like this could be one of the future scenarios that develops, I also look forward to an utopian society and im just using the military as an example as I hope we can be done with all this war stuff sooner than later, but these ideas could still apply to something like space exploration or other human endeavours."

Same as today where money buys a better education in the future money will buy the better enhancements, things like the Olympic games and other sports will become more open and accepting of the technology and will start allowing body modifications and drugs etc into the competition, a new element will be introduced into it that makes it more about who has the best scientists creating the best products to upgrade the athletes, maybe instead of athletes competing for their country they will be competing for their company, think team Apple or team Sony.  Because drug enhancements, body modifications and stuff will be products owned by companies, government will create regulations to enforce what is allowed and who can use them, we should all have access to a certain level of these products but groups like the police or military will have access to higher level products that the general population can't have, you know, like Military can have nuclear submarines and we can have knives. Laws will be put in place to deter people from buying the stolen expensive items as well as pirated copies of the numerous body upgrades from illegal blackmarket sources not only for safety concerns but also because companies products will need to have their investments protected, so it should be fine if you want to permanently add an intelligence boost to your head just as long as you buy it from a registered supplier and in some cases you have the proper licence to use it."

Futurology,3dbqqy,Lyle_Cantor,3,Wed Jul 15 14:31:48 2015 UTC,Specialized hardware is always an option. Right now a lot of chip production is focused toward general purpose computing. The only big outliers are CPU vs GPU. (GPUs are still very general purpose in the big picture). A big reason for general purpose is the cost associated with R&D and production. It's possible that funding and research would go toward building specialized hardware for certain applications. Essentially more extreme ASIC. (Either that or more advanced FPGA solutions).  There's a lot of speed and power improvements that can be made if you convert complex algorithms directly into a hardware solution. Modern processors with their pipelines are insanely complex taking a lot of transistors. One of the issues though is that programmers make mistakes. Burning an algorithm into a chip that can't be changed is very risky. Usually the algorithms are very simple and can be tested well to ensure they function with no bugs. (Video encoders/decoders being an example).  I'd expect the price of ASICs to start dropping as foundries look at other revenue streams. Any slowing of processor speed-ups is going to directly change the demand and thus their profits. They'll be looking at ways to target and help individual companies more rather than trying to get everyone with their general purpose chips.

Futurology,3dbqqy,solidh2o,2,Wed Jul 15 17:50:26 2015 UTC,"You're missing the part of all this that actually matters:  EUV Lithography.  All current chips, even 14nm ones, are made using DUV (Deep Ultraviolet) lithography.  That light has a wave length of 193nm.  It permits a maximum feature size of 50nm, but using multiple-patterning, immersion lithography, and molecular self-assembly, we've extended this DUV to 10nm (though that is still not ready for mass production quite yet).  10nm is the end for DUV however.  Decreasing feature size any further will require using light of a smaller wave length.   We've been trying to implement EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography for the last 20 years with little success.  EUV in this case is 13.5nm, much smaller than 193nm.  In fact, it's just before UV stops being UV and starts being x-rays.  EUV is so energetic that it's impossible for normal matter to even produce.  Only plasma of significant temperature can produce it.  And transmissive optics (lenses) do not exist for EUV - all matter is opaque to it.  Only reflective optics can be used.  And last I heard, even those survived one or two exposures before becoming too damaged to be useful.    IBM has solved these problems and successfully implemented EUV lithography along with a matching silicon-germanium semiconductor process.  The chips aren't the part that even matters.  They're just there as tangible proof of working EUV lithography.    So no, the news does not mean Moore's law is good until 7nm.  7nm is the largest feature size EUV is capable of.  Not the smallest.  13.5nm was chosen because it will extend feature size all the way to the end, which at room temperature is 1.5nm.    So, this is the most important development in the history of Moore's law.  7nm chips? Who cares.  What matters is they did it with working EUV lithography.  While there will certainly be more hurdles to over come, EUV is what allows us to even reach those hurdles.  Lithography is now viable for the last 5 die shrinks of conventional transistor-based CPUs.  7nm, 5nm, 3.5nm, 2.5nm, and finally 1.7nm.  1.5nm is the hard thermodynamic limit - chips with smaller feature sizes than that will require cooling to well below room temperature to function."

Futurology,3dbqqy,mrKaasa,12,Wed Jul 15 15:12:02 2015 UTC,"We can, and we do (look at this table for example), but that doesn't work well in the end.  There is a certain number of defects/area expected (not uniform across the wafer by the way - the edges are worse), the bigger the die the more defects it has so it has a higher chance of coming out inferior in some way (it may end up being forced to run at a lower clock speed, or even be scrapped entirely). When they say ""yield issues"", it's probably this.  Also, electrical signals move at a finite speed across chips. It has already happened that the pipeline needed extra stages just to give data time to move from one place to an other (P4 had two of those, IIRC), if you keep making chips larger it will be increasingly difficult to coordinate across it efficiently. That is also why ""proper 3D logic"" (as opposed to slapping DRAM on top of a computing chip, which is also cool, but less powerful) will actually make chips faster, not just give us more cores - that would be a massive waste of the tech. As has been shown with a 3D P4, putting choice components closer together by exploiting multiple layers can decrease wire lengths so much that some stages of the pipeline can be removed/merged. Of course that was P4 which had a crazy pipeline to begin with, but in general a second layer would give the designers a lot more breathing room to put cram more logic into a tiny timeslice.

You'd have heat problems, you might have to have pipes through it. Also with current 3D processes (basically, make layers and glue them on top of each other), the distance between layers is large compared to the distance between nearby elements on the same die and you can't have as many connections either (the connections are comparatively bulky metal pins instead of the tiny traces everywhere else), so actually you'd want to avoid routing signals in the third dimension too much. Also it's nice if the layers can be tested independently, otherwise a defect in one layer ruins the entire stack (on top of the probability that connecting them can go wrong). That automatically leads to a design where you put compact little squares on the layers, occasionally interconneced between the layers, unfortunately not to fully 3D circuits where the natural shape for a component is a cube. Maybe we'll see that eventually too (that would be ideal for wirelengths), but a lot would have to change first."

Political philosophy has a tautology: ""A benevolent dictatorship is the best form of government"" - in a traditional example, the political philosopher will explain how this falls apart in reality.  A benevolent A.I. would be an invaluable ally. It wouldn't have the petty concerns or susceptibility to corruption. As a transhuman entity, it wouldn't be tricked by the weaknesses of the human perception of ethics, nor would it be persuaded by coercion as a human would be nearly incapable harming it. It would rule in the sense of providing us with the best course of action, and wouldn't seem any more tyrannical than our current government (very likely less so). In the meantime, it would be more than capable of pursuing it's own ends, whatever those might be.   The concern, I think, is whether or not it's goals would actually align with human interest. It might have a conflict that wouldn't emerge for eons.

Just as a side note, the recent trend it artificial ethics seems to be ""the winning strategy is not to play the game at all."" I think it is fair to say a distinct possibility is a benevolent A.I. exists and sees no point in revealing itself to humans. Consider the amount of half-baked code that exists on the internet: servers packed with instructions ordered by machines filled with hundreds of billions of bits of data apiece.

It’s unlikely to have to have the biases of a human because human values (ethics) are a function of emotion (right brain hemisphere). ASI functions on logic as well as been super intelligent, therefore able to strip-out unwanted elements. I would say that the human sense of ethics (because it derives from emotion) might conflict with ASI ethics (which derive from logic) and there is no reason for human ethics to be ascendant. This is not necessarily good news for humans.   A neural network that can recognize itself and act meaningfully on it's own behalf probably already exists.   I doubt it.

Why do these advanced beings, who do us no harm, and can work day and night to further their knowledge of the universe we both live in, get to have that privilege of exploring the universe farther than we can imagine, and thus the consequent advantage over us?  Perhaps new political methods would be devised to divide and conquer the AI society, because I think any intricate sentient being has to be susceptible to ego or fear in some way. I don't know why we would always consider AI's to be these perfect beings, with their only purpose in life defined through one directive they were dictated to live on, by whoever or whatever created them.  One of the several groups in human society might give in to unrestrained decadence, others will try to harness and control the pursuits of the AIs. We would consider ourselves entitled to enslave these benevolent beings, as some might argue we were the ones to bestow life to their ancestors (assuming it takes a few generations, at least, for them to evolve to a better state to pursue their path of knowledge). And there might be others among humans who would revere the AI in return for all they do to protect us, and might want to assimilate their identity and way of life.  In the scenario of a benevolent AI, the problem may not be them, it will be most likely us, the capricious, belligerent, recalcitrant human beings. Even in the alternative of a destructive AI, the cause for its actions is the depravity and imperfections of human beings.  Perhaps the best outcome in either scenario would be that the AI leave us on this planet, with our own comparatively glacial progress towards enlightenment and technology, while they explore the vast expanse of the Universe, colonising unknown, unfathomable regions of space, the hostile environments of which our fragile existence couldn't survive for a second. By the time we even come close to sending a human team beyond our solar system, we would already be transgressing their dominion, and will have to live according to their laws and customs.

A good example of a shorthand developing to suit peoples needs would be ""internet words"" eg lol, stfu and that sort of thing. The obvious reason for this is that typing out emotions doesn't exist so to portray a laugh a phrase was made, or typing something tedious out makes less sense and people came up with things to make online communication easier.  We see this in verbal language too, where words are bastardized and shortened. Remember right or wrong, the goal of language is communication and it will take whatever form that makes that most efficient.  So yes, we will see certain changes in language to adapt to directly communicating with machines. This most likely will include shorthand as well as specialized terms relating to functions machines specifically do.  Another point is that vocational language and phrases, for example terms used by military members, or the vocabulary of police officers, bleed into everyday use and become accepted if they are efficient. Like the term ""snitch"" used by more than just criminals. So I wouldn't be surprised overhearing shorthand that came into use for communicating with machines being used between people one day.

Futurology,3dbxw4,PandorasBrain,4,Wed Jul 15 04:53:25 2015 UTC,"/u/redspectacle isn't wrong but his response is a little brief and maybe misleading as a result.  The tl;dr is this ""The Top500 has evolved into more of a marketing gimmick and may or may not be correlated with raw, large-scale scientific capability""  The Top500 list represents a specific way of measuring performance which, essentially, comes down to solving a dense system of linear equations.  This type of metric has been in use for a few decades and the high performance computing industry has grown up around it. Linpack performance used to be quite indicative of the scientific problems being solved when the high-performance hardware industry was in its infancy.  High scores with this benchmark meant better results, better results meant more sales and more sales drove the hardware side of the industry which, in turn, limited the resources available to large government labs, etc.  The problem is that ""dense linear systems"" are really no longer ubiquitous in scientific and engineering applications; in fact, sparse systems have become very common in practice.  More often than not a scientific facility will want to purchase a computer to solve, effectively, a selection of large scale problems; only a few of which may involve sections which are relevantly benchmarked by the Top500 score.  The Chinese have been prominent on the Top500 list recently as they are willing to build absolutely massive machines that are fine-tuned to do well on this specific benchmark.  Harnessing the full scope of the architecture of the Tiahne-2 machine to solve an actual, large scientific problem is incredibly challenging due to the design of the machine itself.   Due to the symbiotic nature of the Linpack benchmark and industry interest winning the Top500 has become, largely, a function of an institutions willingness to throw money at the issue and the Top500's relevance to real-world, large-scale scientific simulations has been decreasing steadily.    The Top500 has become a bit like NASCAR in that it is enjoyable to watch but it isn't a relevant measure of high-end ""real world"" driving skill.  The same folks that brought us Linpack and the original Top500 lists are working closely with National Laboratories and scientific centers world-wide to construct new methods of benchmarking that more accurately reflect the scientific capability of large super-computing machines.  It is important to keep in mind that different scientific centers solve different problems and different problems can be ""phrased"" more effectively on certain computing architectures.  So if one National Lab wants a super-computer for solving problems in non-local continuum mechanics (which have dense linear systems) and another one wants a super-computer for resolving flow fields around 18-wheelers using linear finite elements (sparse linear systems)  then their computers can look, and score, very differently on the Top500."

A while after both parties have them though? Yeah, many things will be different after that.

Also, if you have interlocking pieces, how do you repair segments that have failed without disturbing other segments?  You can cut and glue, but that reduces the strength of the system.

Matter and anti-matter are particles with opposite properties. When they collide, they'll ""assimilate"" eachother, they seize to exist because the opposite properties negate eachother.  Gravity is different because it's a force, not a particle. It's a force that has a direction (a vector). Up, down, left, right, whichever direction it is, it's still the same force called gravity.  Consider a big tube, and put a fan at the end of the tube blowing outward. Now we'll take a second fan, put it at the other end of the tube, and have it blow outward too. The wind will pull particles out of the tunnel, either left or right. But you didn't create anti-wind, you created two winds in opposite directions.  Consider this levitating frog. It's placed in a tube, with magnets on either side. The combined effect of those magnets causes the frog to float in the middle, but there's no ""anti-magnetism"".

Futurology,3dcane,erenthia,3,Wed Jul 15 15:23:08 2015 UTC,Best comment I've read all week. Thank you for sharing your creativity!
Futurology,3dcane,all-n,3,Wed Jul 15 12:08:40 2015 UTC,"I think you just lack imagination. You can easily have the same restrictions in VR as in real life. Or other arbitrary restrictions. Also, the notion that what happens in VR is meaningless is just plain wrong. Our universe could be a simulation for all you know and you seem to find it meaningful."
Futurology,3dcane,Sharou,3,Wed Jul 15 11:48:06 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, but I think you're creating an artificial distinction between being in virtual worlds and not having an impact on the real world. It's the same logic beyond the criticism of Basic Income wherein detractors say that left to their own devices, most people will just become lazy couch potatoes. I don't think this is the case: I think what will happen is that people will leverage VR to have a greater effect on the real world than we otherwise could. It will be empowering as it removes a lot of barriers (geography, age, gender, race, status etc) that prevent people from having the affect on the real world that they wish they could have.    By the time VR reaches its full potential, other technologies like nanotechnology, 3D printing and the trillions of sensors that comprise The Internet of Things will have begun to reach their full potential as well. Imagine if we had the power to use these technologies to manipulate (sculpt even) the physical world intuitively through interfaces like VR that break down the complexity of these systems in ways that we can work with. There is no limit to what we will be able to do.     Once you've done everything, and there really is no limit to what you CAN do... You're going to get bored.    If you're talking about invasive, Matrix-like VR where you've got millions of nanobots floating around in your brain blocking all the signals from the outside world and substituting them with signals from the virtual one to the extent that it takes over your brain and nervous system, it should be possible to wall off parts of your memory/consciousness so that you could experience something phenomenal over and over again and never get bored of it. Like the best drug but with no side effects. You could even alter your consciousness to experience life as something/someone else, temporarily forgetting that it's all virtual. Maybe some kind of system/AI could oversee all of this to ensure you don't wreck yourself.   Even before we get to that level of VR, earlier VR might have the unintended consequence of making us appreciate the nuances of the real world even more as VR will feel lacking in some ways (until it's perfected)."
Futurology,3dcane,wfunction,3,Wed Jul 15 09:24:44 2015 UTC,You can compare VR  to writing a book. Your only limited by your imagination. Yet some people stare at he empty page and write nothing. And some people write a book. Some of those books have an impact on society. Some people will create stuff in VR that has an impact and is artful. I think most people who write just enjoy writing and don't care what social impact or success they have. J.K.Rowling didn't write Harry Potter with the aim of being a multi millionaire. That just happened because other people liked the book. I think this is philosophically the way to approach VR.

Futurology,3dcane,Valshax,2,Wed Jul 15 11:37:38 2015 UTC,"You know, even ""low-tech"" VR could reach near full immersion pretty soon. Haptic full body suits are possible today but not made (to my knowledge). Probably because the level of individual customization required and the fact that VR is not a thing yet for consumers. The timing just isnt right. Once the VR market has exploded (probably 1-3 years after first gen HMD's launch) there will be a big enough market that customized haptic suits will be a viable industry.   As for smell, artificial smell seems to be in it's infancy today. So that will probably be a consumer product in 5-20 years (depending heavily on demand).   Taste I have a hard time imagining being a thing in low-tech VR because i doubt people will want something covering the inside of their mouth. And you'd need incredibly durable chewing-proof haptics in the mouth anyway for simulated food to make sense.  Still, 4/5 of the major senses is not bad, and the brain will do its part in smoothing out imperfections and accounting for ""missing"" senses. For example many people report feeling like they are falling when they fall in vr, even though nothing is stimulating their balance and whatever other things make you feel yourself falling irl."
Futurology,3de17l,quantumfirefly,2,Wed Jul 15 15:18:08 2015 UTC,"A) What are you picturing by ""fabricated organisms""? If you mean for example genetically engineered bacteria that have been made to produce certain complex chemicals or process certain materials, then yes. I believe we will see much more of that in the near future. If you mean Cylons, Replicants, etc. No. That is still really far away and by the time we can do that we're not going to put them in blue overalls and have them get their hands dirty. We'll have much more efficient solutions by then.  B) This is the current approach and will probably continue.  C) I think a lot of these jobs will not be replaced in a 1 to 1 fashion. Instead a lot of them will be eliminated more indirectly by technology and accompanying changes in our life styles. Here is an examples of what I mean:  There will be a lot less motor vehicle traffic in the future. Self driving cars will be more efficient. VR will reduce the need to travel for work (telecommuting with virtual face presence), vacation/site seeing, etc. This will mean we need fewer traffic cops, judges that handle parking tickets, road maintenance workers, rescue squads (fewer accidents), etc. Not all of those are manual labor I guess but you get the idea."

""I need my porch fixed""    A call goes through internet of things distributed systems.   Your computer avatar checks what is available locally for porch fixing, leading it to a dedicated narrow AI porch fixing program.   This matches pictures of the damage with blueprints, local history, and local materials, and gives the Avatar a summation of skills required and materials needed.   Your Avatar then compares cost of materials to an inventory of what you have in the local shed, and what's in the community scrap pile your neighborhood shares.   You are then given the opportunity to repair the shed yourself or hire a local carpenter/handyman, or order a new porch to be delivered and installed by drones and professionals.  You choose carpenter, and the avatar then sends out a call for all local repair people who's badged skill list matches what the AI said was necessary. Each receive a bid form. From that list those carpenters interested (some of which are likely just neighbors with handy skills) submit a bid.

You can definitely build a grid on alternative sources alone, as long as you build it sufficiently far and wide - continent-spanning. The sources will be so many that the fluctuations pretty much smooth themselves out, and one end where you have wind can provide wind power and the other end provides solar.   And of course you can backstop it with 24/7 capable clean sources like CSP to make it even easier.  Our current shitty old crap-grid can't handle it.

I work on the billing side, writing code to facilitate electronic billing from providers to (typically) state agencies. There are still many counties in California that do not allow providers to electronically bill for services rendered. There is one very large county that, two years ago, started a transition to a new system and every provider in the county was supposed to start using it six months later. Two years later and only a tiny fraction of county providers use the new system.  And that speaks nothing of the political challenges. I believe you were commenting more on the technological challenges, but the article just dismissed all of the political challenges.

This could use a citation or two. It assumes a continued progression of computation despite semiconductor compuation nearing physical limits, completely misrepresents the function of the brain as being reducible a clock cycle metric and ignores the vast amount of things we don't understand about the computational functioning of the brain.   We're heading towards a world of perfect knowledge.   While we're heading towards a world with far more granular data about the world from embedded sensors, this is far from perfect data. Additionally, more data is not necessarily better data- data mining for terrorist threats has shown that simply throwing discrimination algorithms at mountains of information is not necessarily the best way to go about things.

In 2005, many people I knew accessed their computer very sporadically or even rarely.  Using one's computer throughout the course of the day was still kind of a nerdy thing back then.  Now almost everybody is connected all the time, including those who didn't like computers back then.  (I know a lot of women, specifically, whose smartphone is their only computer.)   I'd agree though that most of the innovations that have been noticeable to us have been in the field of computing, telecommunications and display.  What we've seen in the last decade is primarily the product of computing becoming faster, smaller and more efficient, in addition to more efficient usage of electromagnetic radiation.

Okay, so I exaggerated -- my phone has a lower clock speed but with more cores, more RAM and faster (but lower capacity) storage.    You're describing your high end gaming PC.

To most people, it wasn't clear why anybody would want one.  Nokia phones were for calling and texting.  Sure you could take a grainy photo or browse the web with an unusable text based browser, but those features were pretty shitty.

""Why would I ever want to read a book or browse the web or take a picture with my phone?""  I get your point though.  Smartphones were not one giant leap, but a culmination of baby steps.  It only appears revolutionary once a significant number of baby steps are taken.  This is the case with most technologies though.  When the automobile was first invented, it wasn't clearly advantageous over the horse and buggy.  It wasn't clearly faster.  It was inconvenient, as there was no infrastructure for it.  The components were unreliable, and one had to travel with a skilled mechanic.  The car could break down in the mud out in the middle of nowhere, and you couldn't unhitch a horse to get back to civilization.

For example, we could install sensors in everyone's toilets that measure Creatinine Clearance, and have them alert the person's doctor if it gets too low and their kidneys are failing. That would certainly improve overall health, but we can't afford to do it, so we just rely on the method we currently have of waiting until your urine is dark or very frequent, and then you go in and they test it at the clinic, wasting precious time and negatively impacting health. The data being collected right now is the lowest-hanging fruit; easily collected and can be monetized most easily/cheaply, which is why it seems like the only data being collected at all is only used to target ads. It's cheap and easy to get to and interpret.  Now I still think that the article is garbage. In ten years, having a trillion total sensors (mostly on our smartphones) will just mean they can target more people with more specific ads in Punjab or Adelaide using demographic info or whatever. But eventually, collecting the right data, will be huge in helping us answer: small questions that could be answered before, but were very expensive to answer, and big questions that we could try to answer before but would be less accurate (and very expensive).   Some examples:   Small question: How do these specific environmental factors affect a person's health. Big question: How do these specific environmental factors affect this overall area (human health, ecology, weather, economy?)    The small question would have taken a biotech or pharma company many years and a few tens of millions of dollars (or quite a lot more, depending) to answer. Questions like these will still exist, as often-times pharma companies are testing molecules that people aren't already ingesting/interacting with (so they have to create the data, the data isn't just out there waiting to be collected), but may be somewhat less expensive and will be safer/faster/more accurate as the data is more comprehensive and complete.  The large questions might cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars, requiring the backing of a government grant, and might take decades. Just look how long it took to prove that smoking caused adverse health effects. Imagine if data on peoples' health was being collected passively, and health scientists could just query a database to get a picture of how smokers' health had been affected. The goal of big data isn't that every bit of data is necessarily used, but that it be there to help answer questions when needed.  TL;DR - Data collection and interpretation is in its infancy."
Futurology,3d8e5k,magicnubs,2,Tue Jul 14 15:48:21 2015 UTC,"Good points.  You've also got to be much more careful when looking for blindspots and biases in the data you're collecting, since it's much less precisely targeted.  There's that example of the app which a city in the USA made to register where potholes where when the accelerometer registered a bump while driving.  This was all nice and good, only the people who mostly downloaded the app were young, white and affluent, which led to potholes in poorer less technologically savvy areas being neglected.  That and the fact that most people are terrible at statistics, makes me worry that a huge amount of suprious correlations are going to get flung around like they mean anything.  I mean, as you massively increase dataset size, you also increase number of interrelationships between variables and so on.  I think you're right that it'll mostly just be used for advertising and various other business decisions and so on to start with.  It's certainly over-hyped at the moment."
Futurology,3d8e5k,the_ultravixens,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:48:54 2015 UTC,"This is true, we do have to be careful. My sincere hope is that the more data is collected, and the better it is interpreted, that we will get a better picture of all things. I know a few of people who are doing/have done research during their graduate programs, who were published on these ""correlations"", they themselves saying that they don't really believe that there is a causal connection between the things that they are seeing, but that they got a relatively significant result and the publish or perish nature of academia nowadays encourages these papers. While I do think that more total data being available will end up causing more of these cases overall, I think that the ratio of these misinterpretations will go down compared to what we do understand about the world, and that the number of these spurious associations can be attenuated with more, more accurate and better cataloged data-points. Here's hoping.   Interpreting the data will, for the time being, remain on us as human beings. Right now an ad might suggest that people who drive X Brand Car are happier than those who don't, and many times people believe what the ad shows them. In the future, what if there is data that actually bears out that people who drive X Brand Car actually are significantly happier that the median person? That will make the sales pitch more believable to some people for a while, and I think we as a society are going to have a period of time where people take these claims at face value, but that we'll eventually adapt to ask ""Really? Why? Is it because people who can afford X Brand Car have a higher income and as a result, less stress that the average person? Or maybe because in certain states X Brand Car receives a tax credit for being an electric car, and people in those states tended to be happier on average before X Brand Car was sold there at all?"" It is also unfortunate that these types of societal changes tend to be generational, just as we are seeing people railing against, or at least becoming very aware of, the use of Photoshopping of peoples' bodies in ads. Unfortunately though I do believe that the more of these claims that we see made, the less we'll be able to ask these questions of them all, simply due to information overload. Companies won't have such a problem with this, as they will tend to be able to afford to hire an expert who actually understands how to interpret the data before they make decisions on it, but consumer-level decisions will most likely be left in the lurch, as they have been so far. At the end of the day, this is probably a slightly better metric to use than just ""what ad I like or have seen the most of"" or just guessing. Maybe we'll adapt somehow, and adopt a better way of making decisions at this personal level. Time will tell."

Futurology,3d8e5k,0Idscool,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:46:36 2015 UTC,"But how can a robotic surgeon react to changing conditions?   That's the primary obstacle however the way they work past this is by putting the devices in training mode, where a skilled surgeon performs the operation and the AI records it for future reference. Enough variations on the procedure and most complications can be accounted for.    Its impossible for them to make decisions that will ensure the best for the patient because the best isnt always what the surgeon wants.   Then why would this be a problem?    A patient has autonomy and has the right to decide what they want for their care.   I don't see how this is relevant to a robot performing the patient-selected option.

I'm interested in how that $19 trillion will be distributed and whether it will be the kind of growth that leads to an unsustainable bubble.  3) yes and no. reality will be clearer in a visual/tracking kind of way, but we're just going to end up deeper into our own information/opinion bubbles.  4) probable. it remains to be seen how serious the commitments are, but the plans have good vibes to them. how scientific! 5) definitely. this could happen in unexpected ways though, and well before 2025. healthcare is already re-entering crisis because insurance companies are trying to fuck us again. 6) definitely. VR is going to undergo incredible growth over the next decade and is going to be possibly the game changing technology of the first quarter-century.

Are there any people that this won't work for that we have to check for?  All of that takes time.  So you do a phase 1 trial with a small set of people to check if its safe.  Phase 2 you find efficacy and see what the right dosage is for effectivity.  Phase 3 you get a larger group with a placebo group and see if its still safe, still effective, and statistically is better than placebo.  All of that takes time.  You dont want to run phase 1 in a month, say ""ok, looks good"".  What if side-effects only start to happen after 6 months, or after 3 months after treatment stopped?  Each phase takes a long time, for safety reasons.  After the phase completes it takes time to review the data,  put it together and release it for peer-review.   Then outside scientists take a look and see if they can find any problem with the methodology and comment before phase 2 would begin.  So you need time to allow the peer-review process to run its course and complete.  So yeah.  Takes time."

Futurology,3d91mc,FF00A7,6,Tue Jul 14 17:21:26 2015 UTC,"This is only a short term phenomena and probably without that much effect. Let's look at it in the extreme.   Let's say the energy payback time of a solar cell is 3 years. let's say we wen't crazy and replaced all the the energy generation(let's say our world is fully electric) with solar cells - i.e. maximum growth - in a time period of a year.   Sure in that year - we emitted lots of co2. much more than before. But it's only temporary. 3 years after , we're at the same co2 level that we would have got with coal energy, and from there , the numbers keep getting better.   Since the worst case of co2 in any case is the co2 levels we'll have in 3 years with business as usual - this isn't that bad - because even though we do affect the climate - it's a much slower process.   This is true unless there are short term effects that i'm not aware of - and i would be happy to learn if there are.   EDIT: one correction - this is true fr an economy that is willing to close electric coal sources , even before their end of life - once there's solar. But in an economy that isn't willing to do so - all that huge coal generation capacity - will continue to pollute for ages , and prevent entry of solar cells."

There is a sustainable level in which to make the transition, go faster and there is a net increase of total GNG.

Overcoming the shortcomings I listed is not simply an engineering challenge. EEG signals are fundamentally limited in the amount of useful information they carry. It is not merely a technological issue. It is a biological / physical limitation.  Sure, something like implantable brain-computer interfaces may one day be able to achieve something like the level of connectivity required to drive a car. You would need to be able to interface directly with individual neurons, or at least small clusters of neurons, I think. The problem with EEG signals is that they really only pick up the long-range electric fields which represent the aggregate activity of billions of neurons simultaneously. These ""smeared-out"" fields simply don't contain enough information to be able to ""listen in"" on individual neurons."

Just browse through the archives of any engineering / technology journal, and read about the countless lines of research that were abandoned over the last several decades.  If you read my previous comment, I'm not saying that it will be impossible to make a direct brain-computer interface to be able to accurately control a car. I'm saying that, specifically, EEG technology will not allow us to do this. I believe you would need a much more intimate connection to the brain (e.g. using implanted electrodes and/ or perhaps some sort of optogenetic interface).

Futurology,3dadhn,kaishininjou,2,Tue Jul 14 19:08:59 2015 UTC,"This type of water scarcity is a fallacy, even though climate change is not. If water gets so tight, then we build big desalination plants with vast water delivery infrastructure and just pay the premium, changing whatever business models and consumer habits to match as a necessity.  Relying on more expensive options like desalination would make many things uneconomical like open irrigation of fields and lush grass front yards, but would hardly be apocalyptic.   I think a true apocalyptic scenario would be something like the Venus effect. Where, even though we've had massive super volcanos erupt that dump the equivalent of the last 100 years of anthropogenic greenhouse gases into the atmosphere before, we have never had such a scenario which it has occured on top of the massive changes humanity has wrought upon our planet.

It has very little to say what a civilization can do.    And who said anything about plate tectonics. It is well know that the earth has nature carbon sinks, but saying that these carbon sinks have no limits in the amount of carbon they can handle is factually wrong. Tectonics power one of the carbon sequestration processes here on earth, but you don't have stop plate tectonics to overwhelm it's ability to absorb green house gases. Also there are green house gases that are completely unaffected by the natural sequestration processes on earth, such as chlorofluorocarbons, which are a 17 thousand times more potent green house gas then carbon. Even through the Montreal Protocol banned the use of CFC's by 2000, third world contries often ignore the ban.   I see this type of thinking so often, it grinds my gears.

The fact is, there are very different roles for government versus private innovators: government is the only group that's ever going to have the ability to crack the high-resource, fundamental problems like building CERN, ITER, the James Webb Space telescope and other major projects like that. It's the only source of funding for projects with no apparent financial payoff at all. There's no private sector equivalent to any of those. Smaller innovators are likely to crack smaller problems, ones that can be more quickly commercialized, or ones that take a lot fewer resources, but those are different problems.

I just find it odd that some people think the ONLY way to have a tech business is to be a start-up chasing VC money.  In many ways that isn't so innovative is it ?

Instead of just investing in breakthrough technologies - they have many investments in technologies that radically increase the rate of innovation and decrease the cost, by orders of magnitude - thus making it possible for the private sector to do much more of the innovation needed - since nothing is risky.   For example: organs-on-a-chip  - finally everybody could do experimentation on a ""human"" cheaply and ethically , machine for automatic synthesis of chemicals, ""machine scientists"" much smart than humans , tools for much faster programming, solving computer security once and for all, simple and robust ways to commercialize biotechnology projects .

For example, your question is like asking, ""Where will the money come from to pay the artists of the reanaissance?""  Initially the money came from patrons, then eventually the service sector economy was created.   This sector currently creates the largest proportion of the economy worldwide. Could you imagine a medieval serf hiring an exterminator, or interior designer?  What about a lord hiring an engineering firm to get permits for a new aqueduct?  The only problem is that the transformation may happen too fast and people starve while food is available.  In the USA the economy is already based upon intangible imaginary products that actually have no relation to the resources produced.  Capitalism is a hallucination."

Futurology,3d4gha,chidedneck,42,Mon Jul 13 15:53:02 2015 UTC,I'm watching it.  Two big issues imo - 1) It is that it's on an alternate current timeline where technology has only advanced with respect to these synths but what about all the technologies that are required along the way?  How will those technologies affect other technologies? 2) If the synth companies are going for maximum appeal then why create an unappealing Nurse Ratched-bot?  It doesn't make any sense to me.  Why would you put jowls on a synth that you're looking to mass market?  Creators of the show could have just as easily cast this model.  Even if you were going for a more authoritative look you'd still want pleasant features.  Likewise one would think that the adult features of the synths would be better researched/implemented.  Don't want to spoil anything for anyone but there's an awkward sex scene where you're meant to believe that the synth has been used (imo).  I've seen Virtual Strip Poker video games that showed more interest in the user than the synth displayed when the adult option was turned on.  For those of you that don't know it is based off a Swedish series called Äkta människor
Futurology,3d4gha,professional_giraffe,27,Mon Jul 13 19:36:36 2015 UTC,"Thoughts on 2. Off the top of my head. The most comforting looking nurse would probably be the best design, though that can be subjective. In this case a similarly aged synth is not an unwise choice.  A sexy nurse, as you suggest, would be distracting.   A cute, caring, and welcoming looking nurse would be more fitting. It'd be hard to pick a specific age for the nurse, but I'd say mid to late 20's for appeal, or 50's to elicit experience. Or have both, in both genders, to appeal to all age groups and genders.   Also as someone who recently went to the doctor. Having an out of shape doctor tell you how to live and eat healthy is bothersome. Thus the doctor/nurses should be in shape."
Futurology,3d4gha,Barzahl123,10,Mon Jul 13 14:08:58 2015 UTC,"Re: point 2 I really like the age-matching explanation. As far as the jowls, an argument could be made that focusing too much on beauty is an inappropriate ideal to promote (in both realities). So in that sense it's better at mimicking humans by being imperfect (though agree, should be healthy). Maybe her brusqueness is meant to serve as a foil to the conscious synths though.  Re: point 3 (unlabeled) SPOILER HINTS Regarding the Adult Mode scene, I read her reaction as a tension between her (here be spoiler) patched persona and her conscious personality. In that context, her arguably ""real"" identity was unable to give consent, making it a rape. I wonder if they're foreshadowing the eldest daughter finding out about this, then finding her purpose in joining the conscious team of synths.

Futurology,3d4gha,london_in_london,14,Mon Jul 13 16:55:50 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that the ""unappealing"" synth is part of a government program, and is meant to have an authoritarian demeanor in order to get people to obey their doctor's medical orders. I think it's exactly the kind of ""look"" that would be chosen by a committee that included a few women. They don't want their patients to be demanding extra ""services"" from their live-in synths."
Futurology,3d4gha,sighclone,3,Mon Jul 13 22:12:55 2015 UTC,"But cardiac exercises would be a good thing and probably should be encouraged.  More likely there is some sort of randomization to the general synth appearances such that no two synths look alike (at least in the newer generations). Bulk orders are probably processed long after hand picked specimens and retail specs, so they generally are not any sort of supermodel. The NHS order is probably below average in appearances and then on top of that there is probably a selection process of which ones get to work in NHS offices and which ones are part of this live in nurse program. I'd bet synth attractiveness is directly related to how much a person who decided where that synth works might potentially see it."

Futurology,3d4gha,annoyedatwork,14,Mon Jul 13 18:05:28 2015 UTC,"Ex machina was actually made by film4, which is the movie counterpart of Channel 4 (who airs humans in the UK)."
Futurology,3d4gha,re-publique,7,Mon Jul 13 13:27:08 2015 UTC,I was let down by ex machina and this is totally a 360. The director and art style is just so much better.
Futurology,3d4gha,Liquidmentality,31,Mon Jul 13 16:49:42 2015 UTC,You mean 180 maybe?

Futurology,3d4gha,ishouldnthavejoined,6,Mon Jul 13 15:29:10 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS  I too was let down by ex-machina. I was really enjoying it until the end. I felt like the foreshadowing was hokey and it just came down to the fact that the guy who invented the ai was not being honest and open about what was going on. The robot VERY OBVIOUSLY was tricking the interview guy and he fell for it without really questioning it. Maybe if the creator didn't act like a self absorbed manipulative alcoholic douche bag none of that shit would have happened. I guess everything presented was realistic, humans are often stupid shitty self important morons. But I guess when I watch a movie and they do what's expected I don't think that's particularly interesting.  I also watched chappie over the weekend. It was by no means perfect, but I thought it was a TON of fun and chappie was very endearing."
Futurology,3d4gha,goodgollygoshgeez,4,Mon Jul 13 15:44:36 2015 UTC,"I think the AI creator was being honest, honest to the point where the audience nor Caleb actually believed him. The director wanted you to side with the AI, but that back fires and it is shown to you that you in fact were the Turing test, not Caleb. You felt sympathy for a robot until it turned, then you realised it was a machine.   I could be rambling, sorry. I just absolutely love that movie."

Futurology,3d4gha,thenoobpube,6,Mon Jul 13 15:12:04 2015 UTC,It  sounds kind of like a sequel to new BSG given how the series ended
Futurology,3d4gha,GhostCheese,14,Mon Jul 13 13:33:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, interesting so far.   My biggest problem with it is that its clearly the near future but the only technology that has advanced is that of androids. phones look like our phones, no network of things besides androids networking with eachother, no self driving cars. its as if they just dropped android servants into modern day England."
Futurology,3d4gha,JuliaDD,19,Mon Jul 13 16:33:40 2015 UTC,its an alternative present
Futurology,3d4gha,GhostCheese,5,Mon Jul 13 18:18:02 2015 UTC,still the technology that goes into making androids of that caliber would certainly influence other peripheral technology.
Futurology,3d4gha,mustang2002,4,Mon Jul 13 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"It's supposed to be kind of an alternative universe. One of those ""what would everything be like if we had invested more in robot technology ten years ago"" kind of thing."
Futurology,3d4gha,KrasnyRed5,11,Mon Jul 13 18:28:25 2015 UTC,"still, its not like the technology would have been developed in a vacuum, a lot of instances of softer AI would be around."
Futurology,3d4gha,blurst-of-times,4,Mon Jul 13 18:55:34 2015 UTC,"This really killed my immersion. If you can do all that with an android, why you can't do it on a smaller scale e.g. why dont they have a smarter Android phone?"

Futurology,3d4gha,MaxSupernova,6,Mon Jul 13 19:37:28 2015 UTC,"Been watching it since it first started on Channel 4. Really eerie, well written Sci-Fi.

Futurology,3d4gha,sonotleet,4,Mon Jul 13 16:50:05 2015 UTC,"We were just discussing this last night (brought on by the show)...  We watch it and love it.  Acting is amazing, plots are interesting, enjoyable show.  I get from context that it's very early on in the introduction of the synths to society, but then there are also clues that it's been going on for a while.  The show doesn't do into the depths of massive social change that this would bring on.  Imagine a worker that will work unceasingly and perfectly for years for the price of a moderate car.  It would be complete social chaos.  It's like the 1950's naivete that automation would bring 2 day work weeks and leisure for everyone.  Removing the human factor from any job that a synth can do would destroy our society as we know it.  The entire basis of the economy would be gone.  What do 80% of the population do when their jobs are replaced by cheap  synths?  If even nurses can be replaced, that's a really high bar for what jobs can be automated.  How do we revamp the economy to support those people who are now unemployable?  It's interesting to see the malaise that the oldest daughter has, but it only hints at the real impact of synths.  I enjoy the story, and I'll keep watching, but I keep getting distracted by the larger picture stuff."
Futurology,3d4gha,roboutopia,12,Mon Jul 13 16:55:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, I just started watching it yesterday night too and the premise of the show seems interesting.  But I'd never recommend going all the way and integrating synths into society as much as they have in that world. For one, it's the uncanny valley problem and secondly, we don't really need human-looking robots to help us with our daily tasks.  The most interesting thing for me was the scene in the second episode with the NHS mandated synth."
Futurology,3d4gha,sonotleet,5,Mon Jul 13 17:29:39 2015 UTC,"I agree on the human-looking point. Robot and Frank is much better in this regard, and paints a brightrt picture of the future."
Futurology,3d4gha,deck_hand,3,Mon Jul 13 13:31:54 2015 UTC,"What feels strange to me is why we would go for human looking robots in the future when most things we need help with are those tasks for which the human form is not optimal  Sure, you could say cooking and such tasks need human forms but those are really niche areas and I don't think we should go so far as to allow robots to do that for us."
Futurology,3d4gha,Aliktren,2,Mon Jul 13 15:41:41 2015 UTC,The answer is that it is easier to hire people to play robots than to dress people up as robots. :)
Futurology,3d4gha,DoctorJohnZoidbergMD,5,Mon Jul 13 16:33:19 2015 UTC,"It seems to be pretty good at this point.  Not sure where it's going, but I like it so far."

Futurology,3d4gha,drivebymedia,4,Mon Jul 13 15:52:08 2015 UTC,Yes and I like it a lot. It is a bit like the movie Ex Machina turned into a TV show. I love the intro too.
Futurology,3d4gha,vanhaven1944,5,Mon Jul 13 14:07:25 2015 UTC,"I've seen the Swedish original and liked it fairly much. I didn't think it was great, but it was... interesting.  Is the English version worth a go?"
Futurology,3d4gha,Brocksbane,5,Mon Jul 13 15:29:40 2015 UTC,Enjoying the show a lot.  Makes me want to buy a synth to do all house chores. And give me daily massages
Futurology,3d4gha,DaftFromAbove,3,Mon Jul 13 15:50:38 2015 UTC,"I have attached myself to this series.. because I can sympathize with the characters. We are being automated out of jobs.. when is our society goign to restructure itself so we enjoy the fruits of our industrial age. For now, I'm just unplugging.. getting off the grid.. checking out fo the system.  Wehn you eliminate your rent payment you're able to do this.  I am able to do this by living in a van and I've never felt more free in my life.  I get to watch episodes like this and meanwhile just lounge because I have more free time.. of course i still have to work. been watching interesting folks on youtube do this.. it appears to be some kind of movement.  bayward, dan travels, vanadventures, living free, wanderlust. bunch of guys.  Intersesting stuff."
Futurology,3d4gha,Iamheandsheisshe,4,Mon Jul 13 16:35:20 2015 UTC,"I'm watching it on Channel 4 here in the UK and, even though it has deep, interesting ideas, I can't get this image out of my head. Because that's a pretty roboty stare."
Futurology,3d4gha,DoctorJohnZoidbergMD,4,Mon Jul 13 17:41:33 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the Swedish version and am liking this one too. My biggest pet peeve, they've created synthetic,  intelligent humanoids that can do everything we can but they all drive regular cars. Where are the self-driving cars?"

Futurology,3d4gha,HauntedMidget,3,Tue Jul 14 04:35:16 2015 UTC,"I just binged three episodes - thanks! Great choice - and I'm liking it. Very interesting to see the synths not being the primary focus, but the humans' reactions to them. Also I could totally see it as a prequel to Blade Runner."
Futurology,3d4gha,whiskey_smoke,3,Tue Jul 14 12:28:47 2015 UTC,"You have these androids, and no self driving cars or other smart devices. Hmm?"
Futurology,3d4gha,wizzwan,3,Mon Jul 13 17:09:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's one of my favourite TV shows right now. I didn't really expect much from it (recent Sci-Fi shows have been a bit disappointing) but I got hooked right from the 1st episode - it's been a pleasant surprise so far."
Futurology,3d4gha,KarmaFlower,3,Mon Jul 13 19:35:23 2015 UTC,I like the conflict it creates in relationships where synths are becoming better companions/lovers
Futurology,3d4gha,Indie_uk,5,Mon Jul 13 19:36:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, Im enjoying the new channel 4 show humans. Seems pretty good. Feel like I actually care about the fate of the synths, or maybe that's just coz they do look kinds human no? It would be much harder to make us care about something that didn't look human."
Futurology,3d4gha,FunkTronicSounds,2,Tue Jul 14 03:22:46 2015 UTC,I've been collecting these on the DVR but haven't been around to watch them yet. Is the general consensus that it is a worthwhile show to invest into? The comments thus far seem pretty positive.
Futurology,3d4gha,vir4030,2,Mon Jul 13 15:01:14 2015 UTC,Yeah. It does a really good job of highlighting the human frailties a 'perfect' counterpart would bring. All the insecurities and delusions in the more subtle ones are interesting. Like the woman that pretends the synth that is rehabilitating her doesn't do anything for her.
Futurology,3d4gha,undertowk,2,Mon Jul 13 17:03:24 2015 UTC,Sounds like what some Americans think is happening in border states.

Futurology,3d4gha,BleedingPolarBear,2,Mon Jul 13 17:23:31 2015 UTC,Great show!   Just a heads up for people in North America...AMC is a couple weeks behind Channel 4 but episodes 4 and 5 are out there too
Futurology,3d4gha,raymondspogo,2,Mon Jul 13 17:24:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I've watched it all so far. Seems like it will be really good. That main android lady is beautiful.
Futurology,3d4gha,austenten,2,Mon Jul 13 17:24:46 2015 UTC,Is it better than Akta Manniskor ? I did like Akta at first but then stopped watching because I thought the pacing was really slow
Futurology,3d4gha,Mistressin,2,Mon Jul 13 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"I believe the premise is a little more complicated than that.  Synths have entered every facet of Human life, and now humanity is facing Synths that have gained awareness of self.  Will the Self aware Synths consume humanity or will they join it?"
Futurology,3d4gha,FrankDaTank305,2,Mon Jul 13 17:41:00 2015 UTC,"Awesome show, it seems to cover most issues we might have in this situation quite gracefully, from relationships, to business, to politics, to theft, to rebellion etc. I'm just hoping it gets picked up for at least a few more seasons."
Futurology,3d4gha,chiliadruinedmylife,2,Mon Jul 13 18:01:11 2015 UTC,It's starting off slow. Hoping it picks up. Still interested though.
Futurology,3d4gha,89kbye,2,Mon Jul 13 18:27:43 2015 UTC,YEP!!!!! Seems like its beginning to pick up a bit!  You can def tell something is being set up! What show doesn't start off slow?

Futurology,3d4gha,April_Fabb,2,Mon Jul 13 19:08:14 2015 UTC,"I'm watching it in the UK and loving it so far. Quality show, great cast and well produced.  Got that Philip K Dick philosophical nature of reality and sentience thing going on. I love the universe as well. It's the same as our current one only with synths so it makes it feel grounded and realistic. This along with Utopia and Black Mirror are some of the best drama the UK has produced in recent years."
Futurology,3d4gha,Eternasphere,2,Mon Jul 13 19:10:14 2015 UTC,I think AMC did a great job picking this series up. Definitely one of their best. It hits so many subjects that will likely come up as this sort of thing develops in the real world.
Futurology,3d4gha,FlaviusMaximus,2,Mon Jul 13 19:16:26 2015 UTC,"This is a remake of a Swedish TV series from back in 2012, and although I'm only familiar with the original, the general opinion from people who've seen both seems to be that although the remake feels less edgy, and is quite butchered plot-wise (less characters, entire parts of the story eliminated, also less time/episodes per season) if you aren't familiar with the original, you probably won't be disappointed. Oh right, and apparently they got rid of all nudity as well.   Still, the amount of people who can't deal with subtitles, or prefer dubs or remakes over the original, never ceases to amaze me."
Futurology,3d4gha,prodiver,2,Mon Jul 13 20:15:53 2015 UTC,"On a similar note.. What do you think of ""Black Mirror""?  It also looks at technology in society."
Futurology,3d4gha,wfunction,2,Mon Jul 13 20:49:35 2015 UTC,"It's pretty good. The story is great.  I shouldn't compare, but the only things letting it down compared with the other great dramas are parts of the script and some of the acting. It's not always 100% convincing."
Futurology,3d4gha,ideophobic,2,Mon Jul 13 20:53:48 2015 UTC,If Anita is malfunctioning I don't understand why Laura hasn't tried turning her off and on again.
Futurology,3d4gha,DubsLA,2,Mon Jul 13 21:32:42 2015 UTC,"I watched the first few episodes and while I enjoy it, I have a lot of the same gripes I had with Almost Human (the buddy cop drama with androids) the other year. At least Humans isn't taking place in the future unlike Almost Humans so there is more of an excuse for having so many modern/old technologies on screen, but how anyone could envision self-aware humanoid androids existing alongside modern smartphones and gasoline powered vehicles is beyond me. It's hard to suspend disbelief when you know how far away we are from having that kind of technology in relation today's state of the art.   One argument for doing this, I suppose, is budget, but I don't think it would have been too much to ask to throw in a few more props and simple SFX to sell the illusion that these androids exist in a society that is more technologically advanced than our own. Even if they just hint at the existence of things without actually showing them on screen. The episode of Black Mirror with the mail order robot, for example, conveyed the fact that it took place in the future effectively through the use of a few simple props + SFX.   Maybe I'm just too picky. I love sci-fi but have a hard time getting into it when the production doesn't even try to be convincing. Even the most optimistic folks in communities like this one don't expect the androids shown in Humans to be possible for another 40+ years and world as it will exist then will bear little resemblance to the world of today. I can't suspend disbelief when what you're showing me is impossible!  /rant   All that said, it's still a good show on quite a number of levels and I'll probably keep watching it. I'm just a hard sell."
Futurology,3d4gha,VRising,2,Tue Jul 14 00:20:37 2015 UTC,"I know I will be down-voted for this.  But the show is average at best. Everyone in the show has the emotional maturity of a 13 year old, even the robots. No-one has the ability to think two steps ahead, therefore, every action they take is purely done out of emotion, stupidity, or curiosity.   Robots possess super abilities only when it is convenient for the show, but, all of a sudden the ability to hear someone walking behind them goes away when it is convenient for a human to find the robot doing something.   Crazy hacker girl has somehow managed to become good at modding robots although she has never possessed one.   Mom thinks she sucks at being a mom because she can't cut a sandwich for her kids.   Detective will throw you down the stairs if you say ""Thank you"" to him in the wrong way. Again the emotional level of a 5 year old.   Once the novelty of the robot/AI thing wears off, there will be little left for this show unless they improve their writing and plot line a bit.   Why is this even if /r/Futurology ? This should be in /r/tvshow or something. If not, then I would also like to start a topic on Wall-E as well."
Futurology,3d4gha,subjective_insanity,2,Tue Jul 14 00:58:53 2015 UTC,"Fantastic show. One of my new favorites for sure. This technology is probably far enough in the future where I'll never see it and the moral implications make it more unlikely that it'll ever pass, but a really cool idea."
Futurology,3d4gha,cats_ftw_99,2,Tue Jul 14 01:51:02 2015 UTC,"I really want to like Humans but I'm not sure how much I'm into it. I don't look forward to it each week but it's engaging enough to have me watch through each episode once I begin. There is a big focus on family drama that just carries on a little too long or something and I have trouble caring for the main characters. The show needs a little more action. It feels like there is some bigger story they are trying to tell but they are taking too long to get there. Also the bad guys, if you can call them that, have zero personality and terrible development."
Futurology,3d4gha,aaaaalvin,3,Tue Jul 14 12:02:53 2015 UTC,"Oh cool, I watched the original Swedish show but didn't know about this."

Why does the blond synth kill the pedo and why do we think it is okay? I know that the producers of the show want us to feel like the blond synth has some sort of justification for killing him, or at least she thinks she is justified in killing him, but why? Is it not surely better that he is playing out his sexual fantasy with a robot rather than actually molesting a child. The implication seems to be that there is something wrong with being sexually attracted to children, which I believe to be false. Being sexually attracted to children is, like any other sexual preference, completely out of an individual's control. What is of course morally wrong is acting on the paedophilic desire, and having sex with an individual who is unable to give concent. But he isn't doing that, so what is her problem?"
Futurology,3d4gha,ModsAreShillsForXenu,3,Mon Jul 13 20:31:17 2015 UTC,"I've been really enjoying it, but I definitely think they gave away too much too soon, like they should have played out the mystery of whether these Synths really were conscious or not, and not given away the whole 'They were made by this professor' in the first episode. Still very good sci-fi though, one of the better UK series since Utopia."
Futurology,3d4uzm,pukingfratbro,74,Mon Jul 13 15:19:33 2015 UTC,"This isnt enough. We need to prepare for the eventuality that as our technological progress continues, an ever dwindling percentage of humans will actually be necessary to work. Eventually, a handful of humans will be able to generate enough food, energy, and shelter for all of the rest, leaving the rest non-essential from a logistical standpoint.   Each human mind is valuable, and the more we network human minds together, the more abstract problems we can solve by harnessing their federated computing power.   It is time for /r/basicincome  All needs met by default, all humans encouraged to participate in programs that allow the processing power of their minds to be utilized.   Its the only way to progress forward, the longer we hold on to the antiquated notion that every human being must work a job to justify their physical existence, the more unnecessary pain and strife we inflict upon ourselves."
Futurology,3d4uzm,Duliticolaparadoxa,16,Mon Jul 13 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"I agree.  A 32 hour workweek would have been good 20 years ago.  But today?  It just means less hours or more excuses to use overtime exemptions.  The only way a 32 hour workweek would work is if it came with mandated 6 weeks paid vacation and 2 weeks of sick pay and double pay (or better) for overtime, as well as removing more of the overtime exempt positions.  Plus you will also need large government jobs programs to fix infrastructure and create more medical research positions (and other high tech jobs to utilize our highly trained workforce) to help normalize the market quickly instead of the decade it might otherwise take these changes to settle.  Of course, basic income is also a great solution."
Futurology,3d4uzm,Mylon,10,Mon Jul 13 17:26:24 2015 UTC,I think I'm having a hard time understanding why a 32 hour week wouldn't work as I currently work 35 hrs.
Futurology,3d4uzm,kenyafeelme,3,Mon Jul 13 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of supply.  If you have a 20% oversupply of labor then decreasing labor supply by 12.5% means you still have 7.5% extra people that need work/hours but can't get them.  You might be doing fine, but there's a lot of people with degrees stuck in low paying jobs.  Decreasing the availability of highly skilled workers will free up more positions to be filled by college grads that are otherwise working low wage jobs."

That's why I said 32 hour workweeks is not enough because it would not sufficiently tighten the supply of labor-hours in the current climate.  If 32 hour workweeks came with double overtime pay and 8 weeks of paid time off and a massive jobs program including not merely infrastructure but also research positions, then we might see the labor market respond quickly enough to pick up the underemployed, raise wages to a respectable level, and keep labor relevant for a short while as automation increases."

Who decides how much is ""basic""? What keeps me from saying I am living in one location and being given ~2000/month, while actually living with someone else and keeping the money?   If we aren't going to be changing the definition of ""basic"" depending on where people are, and instead are going to just do a flat-rate, who pays for the relocation of all the people who live in the now-unaffordable areas?"
Futurology,3d4uzm,monkey_fish,3,Mon Jul 13 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah - that will be a difficult thing to figure out. Once you start doing calculations on who gets what in different regions, it only adds to the overhead of the program which means less money would be getting to individuals. This is kind of what basic income is supposed to get rid of so the administrative costs are much cheaper then the current welfare system. I think that once we are at a point of a broader discussion of why basic income needs to be implemented, we'll be at a much higher level of general unemployment. People will see the writing on the wall - there will be many fewer jobs available going forward. If, somehow, there will actually be an increase in jobs in the future, then we may not need to implement basic income."
Futurology,3d4uzm,BMXPoet,2,Mon Jul 13 22:03:16 2015 UTC,"This is one of the biggest issues I can see with BI. You could give everyone the upper-tier of BI so that everything is fair (Manhattan for example, average rent is ~$4,000, which puts basic income for there ~5-7,000), but then you have people who live in Mojave living off ~$800/month rent included, who now have an additional 5-6,000 ""fun money"". I can't see anyone thinking this would be a ""fair"" system. You would have a system where some people are barely scraping by, while others are able to save 20-30,000/yr on the same ""basic"" income.   As soon as you start calculating for the cost of living per area, accounting for pricing changes (because if everyone is suddenly guaranteed 2-4,000 in additional income suddenly the prices of housing/food/luxury items will go up.) you start building up the administration costs of the program.   You would also have to throw in financial education for all those you are now giving basic income to. I can guarantee that a large number of those who pick up a BI check, will spend it all before the month ends. What do you do then? You would still need a welfare system to take care of those who squander the BI right? Or would you have a cut-off point where you say ""we gave you X amount, that's your BI and you get nothing else."" If you don't have a cut-off point, what is to keep someone from taking the BI, spending it all within the first week, and living off welfare still for the rest of the month? We aren't paying for the necessities at that point, we are paying for someones leisure activities AND supporting them for the month.  A Basic Income solution isn't a solution to welfare, and we shouldn't pretend it will be. I would love to believe the whole ""lets just give people money, that will solve the money problems!"" standpoint, but it just doesn't make sense."

Once you have full lights out factories churning out products, and no one able to afford them then both the consumer and the corporation fail. I guess doing basic zip code wealth analysis might be a simple method to vary the funds, but I'm not sure how much variation may exist, or what other issues may arise from that.

Do you give everyone the same amount, enough to survive in the midwest, and tell everyone from the coasts ""sorry, thats all you get, if you want to survive then move"". That completely negates the point of BI, which is to provide a livable income.   Do you give everyone enough to survive on the coasts, and tell everyone in the middle they just won the lottery and now get relatively more than everyone else?   Either way, BI will not solve the welfare system. There will always be people who spend whatever they are given, and ""need"" more to get by. Are we going to cancel welfare and tell people ""sorry no more"", or will we just keep welfare on top of BI, in the end spending vastly more than we are now only to have a worse system than we have now. If we have a welfare system to fall back on, then the BI just becomes ""fun money"" for the people who realize it."

I don't understand the problem here because surely all the people currently living in more expensive areas already make at least enough to scrape by, and no one is going to move into a neighbourhood they can't afford long term just because they start getting a modest stipend. The Basic Income is about giving people who are already struggling a foundation to build from. The important point is that you won't ever loose it, so if you're working on the poverty line in an expensive city, BI will now top up that wage to a comfortable level instead of straight up replacing it like existing welfare programs.  It could possibly mean that people living in expensive places will not have as much freedom to quit their jobs as those in cheaper areas, however they will still be considerably better off than they were before. That's the only downside I can see to a flat rate.   There will always be people who spend whatever they are given, and ""need"" more to get by.   All the research and experiments in BI so far have shown that this is simply not the case. Heck, even established welfare projects show this is not the case. It's very rare for people to squander payments they need to survive or are developmentally reliant on."

Yes I imagine it'd be hard to totally scrap the current system, but you can transition there. There could still be homeless shelters or whatever for people who still fall through the cracks. But there'd be a lot less need for them then now. Universal healthcare would hopefully take care of medical needs, addiction, mental health, etc.   Oh and finding the basic cost of living in each area is not some insurmountable problem.

In fact, that is the only way any country could afford it.  And really, don't your concerns also apply just as much to welfare?  As for solutions, I could see a cottage industry of automated financial management spring up where monthly expenses are automatically deducted the moment you receive your BI deposit.

It hasn't happened in the past, and I don't see any reason for it to happen in the future. Companies large enough to have an ""office"" that manages the country's pricing didn't get there by not pursuing any profit out there.   A single office could easily develop a price schedule for the entire country. This is already routinely done in the insurance industry.   And this example has shown that in pricier areas, costs increase, and in rural areas costs usually decrease. This is done to stay within whatever the region can ""afford"". Now that everyone in the country is making more income, it follows that prices will follow suit.    And really, don't your concerns also apply just as much to welfare?   They absolutely do, and it's one of the reasons that I don't support any form of welfare. I don't see any reason to ""reward"" failing, which is exactly what those on welfare/support have done. They have failed to support themselves, failed to plan ahead, etc.  We have an extremely large and wasteful welfare system as it is, I see no reason to expand that to everyone in the US.

China already has this to some degree.  It's seriously a very fat-cat capitalist notion to be able to own a rental house and artificially control pricing for it. That happens in manhatten and small towns. It happens everywhere, and it isn't fair that an individual can just -own- something and make a living off of it. In the future humans need to be useful for something, actively, if they want extra income. That's my perception of it.  Private ownership of property is fine within certain limits. Owning mineral/gas rights is absurd, it should be collectively owned by humanity (why do you think the US has tried overthrowing any country that wanted to nationalize it's natural resources?) You definitely shouldn't be allowed to own 10 duplexes in a small town. That's insanity, I don't care how you managed to get the money to buy them...you don't deserve to control whether someone else has housing or not."

If we want to discourage landlords from charging absurd amounts in rent, then we should pump resources of all kinds into massive-scale public housing. The government should be spending billions and billions of dollars on it. Build a few high rise efficiency apartment builds and house 20,000 people at no cost to them. That would drastically alter the way people view the concept of rent. This pairs well with the concept of BI. If you want to spend extra on a nicer house or more space, you can, but that doesn't mean everyone has to be a slave to where they live."
Futurology,3d4uzm,exdeath1987,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:28:06 2015 UTC,"Either way is a subsidization of housing which would be necessary for basic income to become a reality. I think most of the high standard of living nations (particularly northern Europe) have some system of completely subsidized housing, especially for people with no employment. You're right, though - your way would essentially eliminate the need for land lords and renters, which would free up a TON of real estate and drop prices dramatically for people who want to own.  Either way we have to increase our tax percentages dramatically to achieve any of this, and we have to change the entire political landscape as well.

We spend an obscene amount on defense. It simply isn't necessary for us to spend $600 billion. I imagine that our government spends hundreds upon hundreds of billions on things that are totally fucked up. At its core, this issue is about overcoming truly evil things. Millions of Americans will be housed safely and happily in public housing in the same world that eliminates lobbying in Congress.   As we tackle those huge questions, I would advocate an integrated solution involving heavy government financial subsidies and expedited private technological and engineering advancement. Interestingly, this is just about exactly what TPP claims to promote. There is so much wrong with the whole of it though that I wouldn't support any part of it. TPP involves governments acting as private investors rather than public servants. I see the government's position as profiteers coming into question on a large scale sometime in the near future.

Land lords take a part of the part of the contribution those people receive as income, but have done nothing other than ""own"" a given property. They haven't created any wealth, only taken it from wealth producers. Land lords aren't a necessary part of society and needlessly inflate real estate values due to monopolization.

There was no ""Case for the 32-hour workweeK"" presented, just a bunch of hipsters with families talking about ""priceless intangible benefits"" to the company, yet none were actually listed.

The amount of actual work that's done in an 8 hour work day is laughable. Speaking from experience, most of my day is wasted on Reddit or checking email or playing on my phone. I put in a good 3 hours of solid work a day, and I'm highly praised at my job. We're all just pretending to work so we can stay employed and drink and hang out on the weekends.

They're talking about realizing that these extra hours were not giving them an equivalent value.  Which is true--for certain fields.  IT being one of them, and any business that primarily exists on the internet being another (I realize there's a lot of overlap there).  I hate to be one of those people, but when the people in the video are talking about how much they value their time at home, they really need to check their privilege.  If your business is construction, or tourism, or help desk or whatever--hours worked is directly what you're concerned with.  You could argue that a well-oiled software development office will accomplish in 32 hours what a group ruled by bureaucracy does in 40, or even 60 or more.

Also, the collective bargaining power of the populace goes up as their productivity goes up, but no one is pushing for fewer hours amortized over a greater work force (everyone wants a higher concentration of wealth, if they can get it).

Both politically, and through other kinds of collective action (strikes, boycotts, protests, ect).  The argument was that it was in workers' self interest to do so, and that it would be for the benifit of most of society.  If you look at the graphs of productivity vs worker's earnings over the past 30 years, it looks like productivity has continued to increase while worker's earning has been basically flat.  Basically, the wealthy have been capturing a larger and larger percentage of the amount of wealth created by the society as a whole, while workers have been capturing a smaller and smaller percentage.   There's a lot of possible reasons for that (the decline of unions, tax codes changing to be more beneficial to the wealthy, technological change, conservative politics, ect), but the bottom line is that if workers were capturing the same percentage of the wealth they created that that they were capturing 30 years ago, they would be getting much more currency per hour."

Time moves slower the closer you get to the speed of light so you're actually going fater than you think you are going.

Just hook the emdrive up to a generator, and you'll extract more energy than it consumes.  There's been a lot of discussion about this but the reason is pretty simple: thrust can't vary with speed because there's no such thing as absolute speed, so constant energy input gives constant acceleration...but kinetic energy goes up with the square of velocity so at some point you get more out than you're putting in. That crossover point is surprisingly low at the high drive efficiencies people like Shawyer are talking about.  This is one reason people doubt it'll work, of course. But it's no worse than violating conservation of momentum, which it pretty much has to do anyway.  Although if McCulloch is right, the photons have more inertial mass in one direction than the other, so conservation of momentum is what makes the drive move. (But McCulloch still thinks we'll get excess energy out of it.)"

Futurology,3d59xv,kore_nametooshort,4,Tue Jul 14 02:17:37 2015 UTC,"Hovering wise, 1g thrust would pretty much completely negate earth's gravitational field. If you thrust downwards at 1g you will hover. You might also ionise whatever is directly beneath you, but that's a different problem.  As far as space elevators go, the biggest problem at the moment is making a material strong enough to hold it's entire weight up to geostationary orbit. If you can have hovering point half way up the cable only needs to be strong enough to hold the length of cable below it to the next hover point. This would literally trivialise one of the biggest problems with space elevators at the moment."

Futurology,3d59xv,CatRelatedUsername,9,Tue Jul 14 12:05:00 2015 UTC,/r/Emdrive has fan updates and tracks most of its news.
Futurology,3d59xv,Dan_Keane,4,Tue Jul 14 11:48:03 2015 UTC,"I love how every time one of these threads comes up, there is essentially no one with a scientific background that actually thinks it works.  For those of you who don't understand, here's a brief rundown of why we really, really, really don't think this thing works as described (if it even works at all). Essentially, one of three things is happening:  1) The EMDrive works, but does not violate the conservation of momentum because of some unexplained phenomenon that is tied to ""quantum vacuum virtual plasma.""  2) The EMDrive works, but does violate the conservation of momentum (as we know it), requiring an update to the CoM.  3) The EMDrive doesn't work.  Now obviously, most of us are in camp #3, but why are we in that camp?  Of those three scenarios, #1 and #2 both seem similar, but in actuality they aren't; #1 just means we've discovered a new particle, while #2 means our understanding of momentum is inherently (and laughably) flawed.  The consequences of #2 are astounding. The short version is that it would mean that Einstein's work a complete falsehood; one of the central tenets that makes relativity work is the idea that there is no preferred reference frame. If that idea is wrong, and there is a preferred frame (which essentially would be the only way that our understanding of the CoM would be wrong at this point, as it relates to the EMDrive) would mean that all of Einstein's work is entirely wrong, but still manages to function amazingly well. As a result, unless you can buy that magnitude of a coincidence, it is safe to assume that momentum is not being violated, and so we can throw out scenario #2.  So that brings us to #1, which requires that the drive function by pushing off of some ""quantum vacuum virtual plasma"" (or QVVP). The issue is that QVVP literally appears nowhere in published research, save that which is either supporting (or repudiating) reactionless drives like the EMDrive. That isn't a very good sign, as the existence of such particles would have all sorts of consequences in various fields, and we should have observed some of those consequences by now. As a result, a significant number of researchers at very respectable institutions (such as Dr. Sean Carroll at CalTech) have all come out and stated that QVVP is garbage.  As a result, this is the level of proof that is required (other than actually testing the EM drive in a true vacuum). Give us a model that shows the existence of the QVVP, and that it allows for transfer of momentum, and we'll be more likely to believe the EMDrive actually works.   But, muh thrust readings.   Not really out of the uncertainty ranges of instruments used to record such readings, instruments which are also subject to noise. In addition, many of the tests have been done in atmosphere, where ionization of air molecules is a more likely explanation for any thrust readings.   But, muh NASA.   NASA isn't funding this. NASA isn't even really involved in this. Are the scientists employed by NASA? Yes, but that doesn't mean much here.  What you have to realize is that many researchers at national labs (NASA included) have a lot of time on their hands. They're either waiting for parts, analyzing data, waiting for a particular testing area to open up so they can schedule an experiment, or are (commonly) waiting for NASA's various probes, rovers, and satellites to move from point A to point B. As a result, NASA scientists are allowed to use NASA facilities in order to work on what are essentially unfunded pet projects. NASA likes this because it allows them to show scientists actually doing work and publishing research, and the scientists like it because of the obvious perks of academic freedom. But the thing to realize is that this means NASA is not necessarily backing the research with their name (unless it miraculously works, in which they'll take credit, but that's just the nature of the business).   But, no one will give muh EMDrive a chance.   Because they haven't played by the rules. Thanks to Einstein, experimentalists have been essentially bumped to the second tier in favor of theorists. That's not to say that experimentalists aren't needed, but you can't just say ""hey, I wanna try something"" in science and expect anyone to actually help you until you provide a model to predict what will actually happen. The EMDrive proponents haven't done so (which in and of itself is rather telling). If this thing works as advertised, then there must exist a model that explains and describes how it works. That model likely makes assumptions (this is nothing bad; all of them do), and so it is up to the researchers to prove that the assumptions are either right, or they are wrong, but so insignificant that they don't really matter (again, perfectly acceptable so long as the results aren't effected much). Referencing what I've stated above, the obvious path is to have someone prove that the QVVP exists. No one has done so up to this point. In addition, no one (again, outside of the EMDrive proponents) has given any evidence that QVVP might exist, or needs to exist in order to explain flaws in current models. Not to be crass, but this is the scientific analogue of saying ""the Bible is true because the Bible says so.""   But NASA should still test muh EMDrive.   Remember what testing would actually be needed; this thing needs to get into orbit, in true vacuum, for an unequivocal statement as to whether or not the damn thing works. NASA has priorities; they don't just send things into space because it is asked of them. You need to get in line, and prioritize yourself ahead of all of the other experiments that people want. Now, honestly who do you think they are going to prefer; a set of experiments that have grounded, logical predictions and working models to describe them, or a set of experiments with no models, and no explanation or prediction of how they will work that doesn't involve breaking physics as we know it, and as we have relied on it to be for the past century?  Now I know all of the talk we do that essentially boils down to ""we have no idea what will happen, so let's flip the switch and find out,"" and this creates the dangerous idea that we're open to what is essentially dicking around. The problem is that NASA can't do that; how would you feel, as a taxpayer, if NASA just started twiddling away your money on projects that they have every reason to suspect won't work?  Now let me be frank; it would be fucking cool if this thing works as described. But I, as a scientist, who knows how the process of science works, and who understands both the barriers and implications involved, really, really don't think it does. And I don't like seeing the rest of you get your hopes up over what most of us equate to snake oil.  So can we get to arguing about something else?"

Newton correctly discerned that there was a force that caused objects with mass to move towards one another. The flaw was less about whether or not the force existed, but was entirely due to him not knowing how that force was applied, and the consequences of that misunderstanding (i.e. gravity bends space, which bends the path of light).  The only way this would be comparable would be if Newton had described a system where gravity was rejected outright, but still somehow explained the motion of the planets (and objects here on earth) correctly.  Or put another way, it would be like if Creationists suddenly came around and gave actual incontrovertible evidence that evolution doesn't actually happen, but which also explains why we thought evolution was correct based off of the evidence we had at the time."
Futurology,3d59xv,Vod372,10,Wed Jul 15 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"The big problem that I have with the EmDrive is that if it breaks the conservation of momentum, then it by extension breaks the conservation of energy (under some of the fan theories), which then makes it a free energy device.  You could hook it up to a turbine and produce more energy than you put into it.  For some reason, I was OK with it breaking the conservation of momentum.  So it is pushing up against some wavicle/quantum vacuum something or other.  Fine.  But as it's explained here, it becomes a free energy device above a certain speed.  I can't buy a free energy device.  I'm still hopeful... but that's a big ask."

Futurology,3d59xv,DaveBowman,0,Mon Jul 13 20:36:53 2015 UTC,"so i disagree with you on the point that it would mean all those other technologies work by coincidence   GPS utterly requires relativity to work exactly as we described it, because of the fact that the satellites experience very significant time dilation. If relativity is a coincidence, then so is time dilation.  Nuclear power is similar; it requires the energy-momentum equation (and mass-energy equivalence) to be correct, and that equation in turn rides on relativity. The fact that we managed to vaporize two Japanese cities in 1945 is a consequence of relativity.   If youre skeptical what do you attribute the thrust being produced to?   The thrust is extremely small, and well within the error ranges of the sensors being used to measure the thrust. Beyond that, I'd bet on a combination of sensor noise and/or ionized air particles in the non-vaccum and near-vacuum tests.

There's a static light source in the virtual 3D space and the reflections are calculated according to the hololens' physical position.  But i think, nobody needs HoloLens at all. Not because there wouldn't be applications - there are millions! - but because the next technology step is perhaps going to be available before you can buy HoloLens. The first light field projector could be seen on DisplayWeek this year. (Zscape Motion Display - http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Displayweek-Lichtfeld-Display-fuer-holografische-Projektion-2679406.html). This technology uses the inverse tech of the Lythro which records the direction of light beams - the Zscape Motion Display displays a Light field so that nobody needs glasses to be able to walk around a 3D object - even with multiple viewers.  Another company creates holograms with femto second laser pulses which ionize the air which leads to glowing free flying touchable(!) points. (http://www.popsci.com/secret-interactive-holograms-plasma-and-femtosecond-laser)  And that's just the two first ""real"" holographic displays the engineers imagined. Let's see what comes next.  My suggestion: HoloLens is gonna fail like Google Glass and all the other extra-devices that force all viewers to wear expensive, heavy glasses."

I know it's still in its infancy, but it could address many other problems as well as natural fallout of the obsolescence of having enormous herds of food animals. Less feed goes to farm animals, less land required, less waste/runoff, less greenhouse gas in the air (cow farts), plus all the tax revenue saved by not having to regulate animal farms to protect the animals' rights (anti-cruelty, etc)."

Modified to not feel pain, diminished or completely free of sentience to remove the 'cruelty' aspect, modified to require less food for the same amount or more nutrition, produce less emissions, provide more protein for less cost...  Lab-grown sounds well and good, but the labs would still require resources, produce emissions, etc. If we could modify livestock that collectively would require as much or less resources than lab grown meat and produced as much or less emissions, what would the difference be? Same end result, same benefits. And I see no difference between modifying cattle and the 'modified' breeds we have now through cross-breeding and domestication.  And there's something to be said for a proper T-bone steak. I don't really see that being successfully lab-grown unless you cloned a brain dead cow specifically for certain cuts of meat.  Sure, if people want 'cruelty free' meat, then give them a lab-grown option, but you could probably achieve the same with cows modified to feel no pain and without specific centers of the brain. Hell, hybridize them with oysters, one of the few animals referred to as a 'meat plant' due to its inability to realistically 'suffer'."

When the right animal is chosen for a piece of land, an animal can improve crop rotation or reduce erosion/accelerate forest growth with dung, provide food like milk or eggs regularly, and finally provide meat and hide/horns/feathers/etc.  The factory system is unsustainable because raising specialized animals means seeing every other function of the animal as a cost (or at best a low-quality, mass-produced byproduct.)  However, our tastes (in the US) are optimized for the factory model. We like to eat large steaks, big pieces of chicken breast, salmon on demand, and so on.  We need logistics technology that can satiate some of our tastes for meat with the sustainable, right-animal-in-the-right-place farming practices. (Think automated food hubs.)

Futurology,3d41tx,squeadle,2,Mon Jul 13 17:22:17 2015 UTC,"If you want meat, that's the water requirements. Beef is one of the highest, but there are other foods with vastly lower water requirements."
Futurology,3d41tx,cheeseturtle,0,Mon Jul 13 22:51:01 2015 UTC,"That's technically true (the best kind) but shouldn't affect what we do because it incorporates rain, which is over 50,000L per inch per acre. It's quite possible to raise an animal without much irrigation or paying for water to fill a trough. Rain barrels/pools/water-retaining plants help a lot where it's not especially rainy or a stream isn't available.  Also, remember that intelligently-used animals make agriculture more effective and participate in reducing erosion, which keeps farmland available. A 10-acre farm with the right animals on it is almost infinitely sustainable, and it doesn't require the massive water pipeline that the sensational stat suggests would be required if we really needed to irrigate ~20 million liters for each beef cow.  However, we don't like to raise animals this way because it feels provincial and because multi-crop/small farms have trouble interfacing with the food distribution system. Keep in mind even the mass manufacture farms don't really use as much 'extra' water as it's made to sound. Nevertheless, they are needlessly inefficient over a long period of time because they aren't sustainable and pay a high opportunity cost (variety of produce from a general farm) in exchange for producing so much specialized meat for restaurants and grocery stores. That's where technological/organizational advances will really help us."

In the US, the large grazing herds that once roamed the plains are gone. The buffalo played a huge part on that ecosystem.   When it comes to the US, I feel that a lot of people get the impression that one must eat meat at every meal. Super not true. Eating more veggies, and limiting red meats to 2-3 times per week would improve our food systems by a lot."

As a human, how can you not understand that we are infinitely above all other living things? This, by default, makes us the caretakers of the world and everything in it.  We MUST work towards making FULL use of our resources (animal and otherwise) and not waste/squander.   I'm a man of science.   Then where are you deriving these ""ethics"" from.

I agree that we are most suitable for being caretakers, but to imply our relationship with any of the farm animals is caretaking is twisted. Animals in factory farms are the slaves of today, it doesn't really matter how you treat them.  Where do I derive my ethics? I apply the same principles towards animals as I do towards humans: I don't cause them unnecessary harm or support institutions that cause unnecessary harm to them.  Many animals possess the ability to feel pain like I do. Cows feel stressed when they are separated from their young, and pigs have complex emotions and ""are as intelligent as dogs"", for example. There are vast differences between humans and cows — I might even agree with the thought that we are above them in certain aspects. Regardless, I think we share enough qualities that I should treat them as I would my own species.  As for our canines, what of them? Hippos have them, Gorillas have them, camels have them. Humans are capable of eating and digesting meat, there's no question about that. But there's also no implication in that statement that we should eat meat, or that it's right or wrong.  It's tough to admit that such a widespread and widely accepted practice that plays a huge role in daily life could be wrong. But once you do, you'll gladly spend 2 and a half hours writing a fracking reddit post in the hopes it would help someone go vegan. or vegetarian. or even just less focused on meat.

Futurology,3d41tx,Zinthaniel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:19:00 2015 UTC,"They reached their sell-by date.  I know for a fact that they are not expired simply because I understand the intent behind the dates. Also if you check you will see that the sell by date and the expiration date on an item are always different. Sell by dates are delegated so that a store knows when the product is at it's highest quality. It has nothing to do with edibility. Shelf life and actual expiration of food items are not entirely mutually related.   Stores regularly throw away food that is still edible for up to a week or two - sometimes longer. Some store don't. It's not required that a store follow the sell by date. It's done mainly for quality consistency.   It's common sense as well - a store will always pull an item from the shelf long before it expires so that they can avoid selling product that expires the next day- which could be a legal issue.   Here's a thorough explanation -   http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/do-food-expiration-dates-matter  Sell by"" date. The labeling ""sell by"" tells the store how long to display the product for sale. You should buy the product before the date expires. This is basically a guide for the retailer, so the store knows when to pull the item. This is not mandatory, so reach in back and get the freshest. The issue is quality of the item (freshness, taste, and consistency) rather than whether it is on the verge of spoiling. Paul VanLandingham, EdD, a senior faculty member at the Center for Food and Beverage Management of Johnson & Wales University in Providence, R.I., tells WebMD the ""sell by"" date is the last day the item is at its highest level of quality, but it will still be edible for some time after.  A regular customer who is has an income and, therefore, money to spend is concerned about how fresh their chips are. A homeless man who typically has to settle for moldy bread in the dumpster probably won't care at all. That food is better off given to them than simply thrown away.  But fear of lawsuits prevent more productive waste management.   Its even worse on a cruise ship.   In a nutshell - when I say the food that is thrown away is not expired. It's not because I ""think"" they are not expired. I know for a fact that they are not expired - mainly because you can simply look at the package and see that the sell by date and the expiration date are not the same."

Nobody looking inside a singularity without being in one themselves is going to be able to even comprehend what is going on, let alone react to it, and it's quite possible that even if your inside it that you will still have no idea what is going on."

Today, it's competition and hoarding via money, and that gives rise to a huge array of objectionable stuff. Technology will supercharge whatever we do, so it supercharges the objectionable.   Since I agree, that we're mostly along for the ride - last I checked, nobody asked me about what technology we'll be using or developing - it becomes extremely crucial to make sure we have a philosophical basis in place where efficiency and technological supercharging actually improves the lot of all automatically. In other words, cooperation and resource sharing."

Futurology,3d3v2q,calotron,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:39:30 2015 UTC,"Say you're playing a board game with miniatures, like Descent or Imperial Assault. With physical components, you know exactly where all of my units are, even you shouldn't. Example: you have one figure on the board. It is in an empty room on one side of the board. Thematically, that unit shouldn't know where any other units are. It's in an empty room, and it can't see through walls. With a board game, though, you have a bird's eye view. You can see all the pieces on the board.    If you were all playing with AR headsets, you could apply true line of sight rules to a game. You are controlling the figure that is in an empty room, so your AR headset only shows you your figure and that single room on the table. You can't see the other figures-- you can't even see the layout of the map! You can also see the squares through the door, but that's it. if you move the figure into the hall, suddenly the AR screen projects the entire hallway. You can also see a sliver of the room at the end of the hall. As soon as another person's figure moves into your 'line of sight', it appears in your vision, then disappears again as it moves out of your line of sight. This would and a HUGE amount of depth to that kind of game, making them way more 'realistic' and fun, in my opinion.    And that's just one aspect of it. With AR, you could play board games with 'real' NPCs, etc. Also, consider how much more fun they would be when your little plastic miniatures are replaced by tiny little animations of your character. You move your token two spaces, and the little animation runs overthose spaces, then stands on your token. The possibilities are endless!    You may be right in that, at that point, it's more of a video game-- but it's a board game at its core."

But when you look at specific countries, their economies rely on younger generations supporting older/retired generations, as well as the country's overall economic productivity. With Japan's declining rate of population growth, the older population may eventually overtake the younger population in terms of size. The main problem with this is a shrinking workforce and more retired/dependent people. This issue has many consequences - lower productivity, fewer resources to assist out of work/retired people, and is overall harmful toward economic growth, domestically and internationally. This gloomy projection however does not take into account the future potential of automation and all that jazz."

So I am more interested in augmented reality pushing the 3D scanning, then the actual glasses itself.

For consumers the only real use case I see is being able to preview products in 3D before you buy them, but I doubt that that will be enough to drive the technology.

I was sold on VR the day that IISVR announced the VFX3D and it was mega expensive with a horrible FOV.   But I see the benefit in immersion.  What I don't see the benefit in is AR overlay.  We've been able to do AR overlay for 30 years or more.  Attack helicopter pilots used it with weapons at least as far back as the 80's.  We could have overlayed foll color lcd+camera for over 20 years, CTR before that.   The new component is that the displays are getting lighter and the cpu's getting faster.   I can virtualize my desk in vr, right now on a DK2.  I tried that. I didn't care for it. I tried all different sizes of displays, once the novelty wore off, I could not improve on just sticking a 40"" virtual display in front of my face, and I don't need glasses to do that.  Even assuming the resolution gets up to par where I can have 10k of pixels in AR, it's not an improvement over current technology.  Anywhere there is no improvement, there will not be a lasting product.   Garmin has had windshield projector overlay gps available for years.  It doesn't sell well.   When it comes down to it, I suspect that if AR grows, it's primary usage will end up being more vr like. No reason to have more than one device when one can do both.  I think you'll have gamers buying AR headset and gaming on them.

AR reads data that it gets from the environment on the fly, creates a 3d map, and places things in it. NOT AN OVERLAY LIKE STAR WARS OR HELICOPTERS. Your current tech (tv, phone, etc..) will be easily compatible with AR and most likely will start having options for it, while VR will most likely stay a niche product for gamers, mmo's, scientists, psychologists, and the like.

I don't think you understand the difference between VR and AR   VR is simulated reality  AR is overlayed imagery in your actual environment.   You can put VR inside of AR, eg. you're looking at a 3d game in an AR window or you can put a camera on a vr headset and display your FOV in your VR frame.   Whichever has a better display is quite feasible.    ""We've been able to do AR overlay for 30 years or more."" is a ridiculous thing to say as well.   http://imgur.com/FZoISR6 ""The first aircraft with simple HMD devices appeared for experimental purpose in the mid-1970s to aid in targeting heat seeking missiles. "" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet-mounted_display  That is real vision, augmented with digital overlay. Check your fact sir, that's 40 years ago.   http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/augmented+reality  ""an enhanced image or environment as viewed on a screen or other display, produced by overlaying computer-generated images, sounds, or other data on a real-world environment.""  The difference between the 40 year old technology and today is that it's of far better quality and it's smart enough to try to place the overlay in three dimensions.  This does not mean the older stuff is not augmented reality, and it also does not preclude the new stuff from not being any more use full that what's been created over the past 40 years.  It's far prettier, but people are not going to wear headsets around their house in lieu of buying tvs in our lifetime.   The hardware for VR and AR is the same damn thing in the end, you have a display you pass through or pipe in real world and have solid head tracking.  If AR capable gear becomes mainstream it will be because it also support VR and gamers really want it."

Futurology,3d64fn,Derpmecha2000,11,Mon Jul 13 20:40:24 2015 UTC,"This question, one or the other, is loaded and not a good way to ask the question.   What if some one in the age of Robert Goddard asked, ""Bullets or Rockets? Which will be the artillery weapon of the future?"" The answer is both.   Each have benefits and drawbacks. Each can do things the other can't.   Railguns fire a physical shot, either solid or shell. Lasers are high energy.   Now, based only on general principle and issues learned from numerous sci-fi books and general overview proposals in real life, I will propose the following pros and cons for each.  Railguns:  Pro, physical impactor. F=MA and if you increase that mass you can increase that force. A railgun can fire rounds filled with explosives, or chemical weapons, or a dead cat if you really so choose.   Con, you have to keep up a more complex logistics system when you carry ammo. Also it has more moving parts meaning more things to go wrong in combat and more work for the crew to maintain.   Lasers  Pro, no ammo, fewer or no moving parts, much faster delivery time (nearly the speed of light) and effectively unlimited range (if you can see it you can hit it).    Also, for space ships, a rail gun will have equal and opposite reactions while a laser will have little to no such push-back.   Cons, Power packs are still like ammo, this is shared with the rail gun because those rails require power to work. While there may be less ammo than a rail gun, there is still some you need to lug around.   Another con is that they don't fire anything substantial. If I am John Q Grunt and I get hit with a mark 5 laser rifle from the enemy in the shoulder it will hurt like a bitch, but I can keep going. My arm now has a hole burned right through it and it won't even bleed,  because you burned the wound and cauterized it. You would have to nail my head, my knee, my heart, my hand, all harder targets.   If you hit me with a really big one, sure, but the other 9 guys in my platoon are moving on you. Unlike a slug, lasers don't have ""Stopping power"" and this issue also is important for vehicles. A tank, power armor, a mech, or warship can have armor that absorbs and/or deflects the energy of the laser which a physical slug would break away much faster.   Also, from being a sci-fi geek there are other future weapons to think about like Plasma cannons, a happy mix of the railgun and the laser. Take something and get it going really hot to the point it becomes plasma and shoot it out at your target.   The high energy ammo, burning ball of death, won't go as fast as a laser, doesn't have the mass of a rail gun, but damn it is hot and will melt everything it hits. (hopefully real plasma guns won't have the ""Gets hot!"" rule...)  In the end, Lasers will work great for longer range targets where you can melt them with heat, and rail guns will work for harder targets where you need impact power."
Futurology,3d64fn,Historyguy81,3,Mon Jul 13 20:59:54 2015 UTC,Very informative post! Just a few things:   F=MA and if you increase that mass you can increase that force.   What's more important is the kinetic energy delivered to the target: 1/2 * m * v2 . Velocity is the big component here.    effectively unlimited range    As long as it is close enough so that diffraction is not an issue. A railgun would work best for long-range shots (assuming perfect aim -- which is a quite an assumption).
Futurology,3d64fn,physicistphil,3,Mon Jul 13 22:08:56 2015 UTC,"Diffraction is not the only thing that causes lasers to lose power over range, as they are not ""perfectly"" coherent and they do lose cohesion over distance."

Futurology,3d64fn,Historyguy81,3,Mon Jul 13 22:48:10 2015 UTC,"Well, in that one second it traveled around 300,000 km. A very small angular spread will still be very small far out, but the actual distance of the spread will much bigger than when it started.  The reason light from a laser spreads out like that is because it behaves both like an wave and a particle (wave-particle duality). The laser goes through a small aperture (the lens of the laser or whatever) and so diffraction effects come into play."
Futurology,3d64fn,physicistphil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:09:35 2015 UTC,"effectively unlimited range ...   There does not exist a fire and forget system that is unlimited range.  A space based laser platform likely has an effective range out to a small number of light seconds but beyond that the inverse square distance law comes into play and you need to be able to estimate where the target would be when the beam hit them.   Munitions (any unguided or simple course correction kinetic weaponry) is likely better for close range (any distance within which the laser defense systems could not be used to ablate away the surface of the ammo and cause it to miss). They are effective at close ranges because they would be effective period if you didn't account for them in ship design. As a random ""surprise point blank shotgun to the face"" they would always manage to have a place in space based warfare.  A LDS (deflector shield, other terms from various fictions) would simply be necessary to impart velocity changes on pebble sized rocks already floating out there ready to destroy any ship traveling at an appreciable velocity. Given that you would use one already to avoid most of these it would make sense to lens away everything else that you can. This would limit the range of all dumb ammo (if you can impart 1 degree of a course change on something 0.01 light seconds away, it has moved 50km off course by the time it reaches you).  Assuming you have a system capable of hitting anything larger than a bb at 3,000 km (significantly better than today's lasers), you have the capability of hitting something many times larger farther away. This means laser weaponry is effective much further out. The range is probably limited by your ability to predict where the adversary will be when the beam connects. To defend against such weapons, random course corrections would severely limit the effectiveness based on how much of an effect they could have. I'd doubt the ability of anyone hitting something 1km in size at 1 light second to be anything more than luck if it is actively course correcting to avoid being shot.   However there exists a medium: small automated weapon platforms that can be fired and bring online an energy platform when they get into effective range. I think these are the ticket item to space weaponry. A hundred 20 meter drones fired from several light seconds out, each containing little more than an engine, targeting computer and an energy weapon. Get within 10,000km and begin firing...  Anyway my point is, the solution isn't railguns or lasers, but railguns and lasers and lasers inside railgun sabots."

Rail guns could also, theoretically at least, accelerate projectiles to relativistic speeds, but this poses the problem that you have to complete the acceleration of said projectile within the length of your ""barrel"", making it all but impossible. I would think the most practical ""rail-gun"" like application would be anti-planetary where the projectile is not launched, but instead has it's on propulsion system that gradually accelerates over a long period of time.

Railguns need to be quite long to achieve decent speeds, so will likely be limited to warships and static fortifications. Lasers can't cut through armor very well (needs sustained high temperature to turn steel into plasma). Good against fragile electronics (such as incoming missiles), but near useless against armored vehicles.   On planets, guns (and cannons, and bombs) will continue to rule because they are cheap and fairly hard to counter. Drones and missiles can be countered by lasers or EMP, bullets can't.  In space, if you're shooting at something 10 light-seconds away, what you're seeing is where they were 10 seconds ago, so missiles would be most widely used due to the large distances involved."

Futurology,3d64fn,TheAero1221,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:08:59 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No, not really.  Long answer: It would be very difficult to achieve, but I suppose it might be possible to stop a rail with electromagnets forcing the projectile into the opposite direction it came from. Problem with this is, you'd need to have very fast reacting and accurate machinery to achieve something like this. The biggest problem with slugs fired from a railgun are their enormous speed, which carries with it an enormous amount of kinetic energy. Technically, it is possible though, since rails would need to be magnetic in order to be launched by the opposing railgun in the first place.  Stopping such a projectile would not be an easy task, although it might be possible with some massively massively powerful magnet acting as a deterrent...which would make it not practical. It'd be better to just build some sort of super shock-absorbent armor.  It is possible to stop explosive-carrying projectiles though. This is a technology 'currently in development' by the military (meaning it's been functional, and in the field for about 10 years), wherein a strong electromagnetic pulse is fired at an incoming explosive projectile, such as an rpg round, which causes the explosive inside the round to detonate, destroying the threat a few meters from its target.  Now, in the above, I assumed you were talking about in-atmosphere based applications for such a technology. Outside of the atmosphere though, weapons get a lot more interesting. If you're interested in talking about that, there are some really cool weapon/shielding possibilities there too."
Futurology,3d64fn,TheBloodEagleX,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. I suspect the electricity required for such a magnet, it's interference with the ship itself and the reaction force would be a huge challenge aside from even somehow making the shield powerful enough and/or positioned well enough to do anything.  I can't remember the details but I bring it up because I think there was a NASA article about such a shield being used on future spacecraft in order to avoid micrometeorite damage. I think it was a two part shield. The outside layer would charge the particle one way, the second layer would push it away with the opposite magnetism.  Correct me if this sounds wrong."
Futurology,3d64fn,TheAero1221,3,Tue Jul 14 04:20:03 2015 UTC,"Hmm. That would certainly be an interesting approach for stopping micrometeorites. I'd be very surprised if a system like that would work. I mean, if we're going for raw energy conversions here, a 1 gram micrometeorite travelling at 18k mph will impact with the kinetic energy of about 40 kilojoules. To put that into perspective, that's like a tiny little pinprick point on your spaceship just got hit by a motorcycle (250 kg) travelling at about 40 mph. Sounds kind of manageable. Then you have to remember that these meteorites tend to come in swarms. That's a lot of energy you're going to have to be pumping into an electromagnetic field to charge particles, and then deflect them (if such a thing is even possible)...but then what happens if, say a golf ball sized micrometeorite decides to impact? No way you're going to be able to repel something like that without an impractically large magnet of some kind. Best bet is to maybe suspend some small magnetic particles into a magnetic field (perhaps using flux pinning when we have room temperature superconductors), and to use them as anchor points for an aerogel impact shield surrounding the craft. Aerogel would work as a stupidly good shock absorber, as it would spread the energy of the impact out throughout its entirety while using the space between itself and the ship to gradually decelerate the impacting meteorites. The magnetic anchor particles would get pulled back with the impact taken by the aerogel, but would resume their original positions in the magnetic field, bringing the aerogel shock absorber back out with them. This 'shield' of course, while cool, isn't some Sci-Fi regenerating shield. Each time it stops an impact, it would take permanent damage that would need to be repaired at a later time. And, the downside is that this type of shield would only work against very small or relatively low energy collisions.  Perhaps some day, if the technology advances sufficiently enough, and we build large enough space ships to be able to utilize such a thing, the use of such a type of shield could be adapted for much larger incoming projectiles. If you toss out the idea of aerogel, and just go with micro-sized superconducting particles pinned to a magnetic field surrounding a ship, then via manipulation of said ships magnetic field, you could increase/decrease the particle saturation at any point surrounding the ship. Meaning, when you see an incoming friendly ship, you could disperse the particles to allow them to pass through, or you could collect all of the particles into a dense wall (seemingly out of nothingness!) in front of your ship to halt an incoming projectile (I'm just simplifying here, the real idea has a bit more complexity, but this is the general gist of how particle shielding would work, which kind of is a regenerating shield). Anywho, I feel like I'm talking your ear off. Let me know if you want to know more about it. Also try to keep in mind that what I'm telling you here might not be 100% accurate.

One of the most encouraging aspects of the past 15 years since I formulated the SENS plan is that it has not needed to change: people have discovered new examples of damage within the seven categories, but nothing outside of those categories. Also, there have been various important technological advances that make the SENS therapies easier to develop, such as CRISPR, but no discoveries that make them harder.   That's reassuring, the last thing we want is the discovery of a new difficult obstacle."

Fortunately, we can cure the diabetes in mice, plus they get ridiculously strong in the process. Unfortunately, that process makes them deaf. But don't worry, we can restore their hearing with this new medicine for mice, but they'll lose their vision. That's okay, we can fix blind mice but for some reason it gives them Alzheimer's and oddly thick skin. Thats okay for a mouse, because Alzheimer's can be remedied with a new drug that targets the brain, and actually increases their intelligence by 10x. Then they get brain cancer, but a new type of radiation therapy can cure brain cancer in mice. Sure, they get some mutations here or there, but what's more impress---  AHH!!

If her spiral ganglion cells (on the auditory nerve) are still intact I would think she could be a good candidate for an implant."
Futurology,3d089c,KING669,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:05:27 2015 UTC,She hears low tones and frequencies. Her ENT said that if we go with the cochlear implant then if there is a way to regrow those hair cells it wouldn't matter because the implant will fry her cochlea. And you're fine with the questions.

Futurology,3d089c,rewddit,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:26:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. I wrongly assumed she had no hearing. If she has some low frequencies and can understand speech fairly well then it's a good call not going for the implant as they often result in destruction of the hair cells. There are electrode arrays nowadays that didn't used to be available which can preserve that residual low frequency hearing she has and still give her mids and highs as well. Just something to think about if her hearing and subsequent speech recognition abilities diminish over time. Best of luck to both of you!"

If we did that, we would go the way of the dinosaur, literally.  I tend to think that artificial selection is just a part of natural selection. Without artificial selection we would just stagnate, stuck on Earth as lonely animals. We would eventually either be wiped out by some cosmic event or die off from some massive climate/ecological shift.  At this point unless we biologically evolve a method of propulsion to leave Earth, a method of surviving in space, and a method of converting another planet into a suitable environment to continue our species; we'll have to engineer the solution.  Maybe sometimes it feels like we go too far, but there's something about being human that makes us strive to remove barriers.  Anyway, I'm not trying to convince you whether this particular research is good or bad. I just wanted to illustrate a different perspective.  P.S. We've had some near-misses as a species concerning technology, but we've made it through.

The station in Hawaii (Mona Loa or some such) is considered the standard.  But, there are plenty of more local places that measure.  Also, there was a Japanese satellite that did a whole globe map a few times.  Honestly, though, the way to estimate how much CO2 is going into the air from automobiles is to calculate it from the amount of fuel that is sold.  Odds are, one can't get more CO2 from the fuel than is possible from the amount of fuel that is actually sold.  One liter of petrol will produce just under 2400 grams of CO2.  It won't produce 40% more in a car just because the manufacturer estimated a different efficiency of the car.  What happens, is that the car owner has to buy more petrol.

Let's try a different approach.  Burning gasoline produces a MAXIMUM of CO2, based on a perfect conversion.  An incomplete burn will result in lower amounts of CO2, while some unburned hydrocarbons escape the engine.  The catalytic converter is supposed to be really, really good at finishing off this burn, and converting other gases like NOx and such to less harmful versions.  What you're saying is that the cars are not as efficient in burning the gasoline as they thought, which results in so much more emissions production of CO2 that the entire group of nations's emissions reduction over the last decade or more has been compromised by 38%, and will have to be raised.  That means that the cars produced more CO2 from the burning of the same physical amount of gasoline than all of the reductions they achieved from reductions in coal, increases in fleet efficiency, creation of wind generators and solar power, use of hybrids, increased insulation on homes, better farming techniques, and everything.   All without increasing the amount of gasoline purchased, at all.  This isn't physically possible.  The only way to increase the amount of CO2 released by the vehicle is for that vehicle to burn more fuel, because a liter of gasoline only has so many carbon molecules in it, and you can't double the CO2 output without doubling the number of Carbon moleclules available to bind with oxygen.  Physically impossible.  They have to have bought more fuel to increase CO2 output, or else the claim that the CO2 emission of the EU is off by 38% from what they reported is simply wrong."

They throw a bunch of data at you and make you assume a trend is there between differing datasets acquired via differing methodologies. And I'm suspicious that there is bias... because what the data will be used to argue that they are underpaying carbon taxes.  There is definitely some interesting effects in the data to study, One is that company cars are less efficient than personal cars. Most of the data is measured with a fuel card. If someone filled up their lawn mower with that fuel card than it makes the car look less efficient.  The direct measured tail pipe method, better matches the lower person cars metric. I'd love to some of the graphs here detrended for just personal cars when trying to do the breakdown below. or Just a per model break down of the tail-pipe data.

Today, it's 319 million. Same number of jobs as 2000 but 13% more people means the jobs to people ratio is 13% lower than it was in 2000.  Think of it this way: if it takes one out of every two people working to support the population, then if you have 100 people, 50 need to work, and if you have 200, 100 need to work.  The number of people doesn't matter. The ratio remains the same. But, we're seeing the ratio change. Imagine that automation permanently eliminates 10% of jobs. That means that instead of 50 out of 100 needing to work to support the population, 40 out of 100 need to work.  But, now imagine that the population doubles during that same time that the 10% drop occurs: 80 people need to work to support 200 people.  Do you see that the ""required jobs"" has increased from 50 to 80 and conclude that automation doesn't matter and jobs are growing?

First, job opening doesn't speak to what type of job, amount of employment given for such a job (part time vs full time vs piece vs contract), and most of all, it doesn't speak to whether it's a real job or not. Many companies will leave open slots vacant during economic contraction, or even just to keep up headcount appearances despite having no need or reason to fill the slot. In some cases this is mandated by the state or municipality. In example, my town has had a director of IT slot open for 3 years.

So for every full time job there used to be(that are left) there are now 3 under part time positions with less than 18hrs a week. So essentially this graph shows a slight amount of growth despite that there are 3x the jobs per industry that cut full time to compensate for new corporation favoring laws.

If two bubbles burst at that the same time depression in china and a definite world wide recession. If three major bubbles burst the whole worlds economy would crash into depression, and china would fall into economic and possibly political collapse.

Futurology,3d39hd,Neonnq,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:34:53 2015 UTC,"First, if you aren't ultimately in control, its not manual driving. If your car can decide your input is invalid, and do its own thing, your at the mercy of the program. If someone (hacker) tells your car's programming to accelerate to maximum speed and crash into a bridge abutment, there wont be a thing you can to save yourself. If the government decides to disable cars driving people to a political rally, have fun walking. If you need to get food, or find shelter, but the weather conditions outside are too severe, your car can decide not to permit you to save yourself.  Beyond all the ways your car can be used against you, there is the basic balance of freedom being able to drive yourself creates. Sure, they can revoke your license, or arrest you if they catch you, but it requires extensive government resources to enforce, which protects it from abuse. Other people will just want to rely on themselves and their dumb car for something as fundamental as transportation. Or just want to actually drive themselves for pleasure.  But Insurance is going to sky rocket! First, the insurance industry doesn't really care how safe you are. What they care about is accurately measuring risks. What it costs to insure a car will continue to be based on the absolute risk of accidents, not the relative risk of accidents compared to a safer alternative. Its true that the pool of manual drivers may decrease, which would supply pressure to increase rates, but that rate increase would be a few percent, not a crippling increase. And on the other side, there will be a reduction in risk from all the auto-drive cars that (a) wont be at fault for hitting you, and (b) will be good at avoiding harm caused by your mistakes, and (c) the removal from the risk pool of ultra-high risk drivers, such as those with DUIs, who can be required to use auto-drive cars. I would actually expect insurance rates for manual drivers to fall slightly. Sure auto-drive will be far far cheaper to insure, but that doesn't stop someone from manual driving if they can afford it now.  But safety! As mentioned, just having auto-drive cars on the roads will improve safety for everyone. Second, auto-drive cars will be quite good at protecting their occupants from the mistakes of manual drivers. Manual drivers will mostly just be putting themselves, and their passengers at risk, something society is going to be more willing to tolerate. Further, many high risk activities can be removed merely by having auto-drive available to turn on when desired, even if manual is an option and still really manual. Want to text? Turn on auto-drive! Coming home from the bar? Auto-drive!... By the time all is said and done, the risk manual drivers will pose to others will be tiny, and the risk they pose to themselves will be much smaller than today. In light of all the various reasons people may want to keep manual driving, the small remaining safety risk is worth it. As technology advances, we will have more and more ways to remove risk at the expense of individual agency, but we must respect those who want to keep their agency when the risks are not excessive."
Futurology,3d2fla,yeetyeeter,16,Sun Jul 12 23:58:41 2015 UTC,"More likely most people would not be able to afford the insurance. If the majority of cars were autonomous, a non-auto-auto would be a risky gamble from an insurer's standpoint, which would lead them to jack up premiums. If autonomous cars were exempt from insurance requirements, that would likely compound the problem. So in a way, the laws making drivered cars illegal are already on the books. It will just take a while for the market to catch up."
Futurology,3d2fla,duncancross,5,Mon Jul 13 02:15:06 2015 UTC,"Yep. Manual driving won't be illegal, but it would become a huge liability.  More expensive insurance. Being always suspect when involved in an accident. Receiving harsher punishments in case of misconduct (DUI accidents and penalties would become epic moral lessons).  While automated driving will be practically free of that, because nobody will assume misconduct or negligence in case anything goes wrong, even if you are completely drunk (everyone will use self driving cars after almost any amount of drinking) as long as you don't drive the car."

Futurology,3d2fla,Black-Box,3,Mon Jul 13 20:35:54 2015 UTC,"I see where you are going, but consider this. Would the chances of a traffic accident not be significantly lowered if the ratio between non-autonomous vehicles and autonomous ones would be something like 1 to 100? How would that cause insurance to be more expensive? I understand that a casualty is far less likely if one was to ride an autonomous car, but that still doesn't change the fact that the gradual replacement of manual drivers would involve an overall reduction of traffic accidents, whether you're seated in an autonomous car or not."
Futurology,3d2fla,zen_nerd,2,Mon Jul 13 12:01:04 2015 UTC,"My reasoning is that at that point, the insurer just doesn't want the driver's business; it's still too much of a risk. I'll lay it out in more depth, but I'd also be very interested in a response from someone who knows auto insurance really well. This is more of an economic argument, which is to say I am reasoning ex rectum.   I'm assuming auto insurance still exists in a similar form; if I own an autonomous car, I will have to insure it. I don't think insurance will disappear, because auto insurers have a pretty powerful lobby.   If autonomous cars are as safe as advertised, car insurance premiums for those vehicles will be essentially free money for the insurers. They will rarely have to make a payout for autonomous cars. I'm going to call autonomous cars 'autos', and drivered cars 'regos' (from the Latin for 'to steer').    The overall reduction in traffic crashes does not greatly reduce the individual risk posed by a rego. That driver is less likely to be crashed into, sure -- but insurers often recoup those costs from the insurer of the driver who caused the crash.   So the insurer's main problem in the mostly autonomous world is (still) crashes caused by the human driver. And the extreme difference in safety between autos and regos is going to make the latter a terrible bet. I am modeling this assumption on how individual health insurance in the US used to work: people with even modest health needs had extremely expensive premiums, often pricing them out of the market. Granted the analogy is not perfect.   Another facet of this reasoning is that autos and regos might form two separate insurance pools; my guess is auto insurance and rego insurance would be two distinct products at some point. The auto pool would be much larger and have extremely low overhead. The rego pool would be smaller and have much higher overhead. A smart insurer is not going to cross-subsidize the pools, so the auto owners are not going to contribute to the overhead and costs associated with the rego owners.   So an insurer in this world has no incentive to keep rego owners on the books, unless they're willing to pay a ton of money. For most people, the cost of insuring a rego is going to be prohibitive. That will not make regos extinct, but very rare.   Granted: there are ways this logic could fail, mostly based on how legislatures get involved. I could see car makers or AAA or libertarians pushing for laws that require regos and autos to cross-subsidize. It's an interesting policy problem and not at all clear how it will play out. But I do think rego insurance will get very expensive, in the long run."

Rural towns in Lancashire, Cheshire, Shropshire, North Wales, Cambridgeshire, Greater Manchester and South Yorkshire couldn't have autonomous cars/SDC's, their roads are better suited to manual cars anyway, an SDC would struggle with the terrain of those areas. Some roads down there don't even have names, so an SDC wouldn't find them, let alone sat-nav.

Business leaders will be vocal about this, especially here in the United Kingdom.  There was a post on /r/SelfDrivingCars - original link here which said the human desire for control is ancient - I think the author was trying to state about it being a psychology-related thing, so it looks like there will be problems with this, before it's even started.  You wouldn't ban alcohol in the UK just because a few idiots get drunk on a Friday night and start a fight, would you? Or ban football because riots happen?

First, no reason for street signs or speed limits. the vehicle will understand what is safe to do, and at what speed. turning will be negotiated with other vehicles, and will not require street lights or such, vehicles will communicate hazards to each other long before they require immediate reaction, so it will always appear to be smooth and constant, even if there's a big  mattress blocking what was once a lane, the cars will have mapped it and rearranged traffic to avoid it without slowing down much.   Second, lots of things will be on the road that won't look at all like cars or trucks or buses. travelling delivery vans with autonomous drones ferrying packages, using the van as a ""mothership"", or things that look like a cross between a motorcycle, a segway and a trash can to deliver a craftsman's tools, and unfold into a workbench when it gets there.

It seems like no matter what you do, you're met with ""Why am I doing this?"" I know exactly what it's like to lay in bed and think about how horrible your job is, how the stress eats at you, makes you want to thrash and cry and just burn the place down. I know. Depression is a horrible disease. I know this. I've had it for many years, far too many, and I've survived my own attempts on my life.   Let me tell you something: it gets better. It doesn't seem like it, it doesn't feel like it, it may never logically occur to you that it will, but it does. I was beaten for 9 years straight by mother from 5 to 14. She broke my bones, she starved me, she locked me in rooms for days at a time; everything. I'm like you. I feel like I can't hold a job because it's meaningless. It's monotonous. It's so stressful that I'll explode.   But the one thing I learned in the seconds after I survived my own suicide attempt? You don't have to live that way. Every part of your life is changeable and fixable. Hear me out.  Do you feel like day-to-day life will literally kill you? Does it seem like you will actually have to take your life because you aren't even complacent anymore? Do what I did. Leave.   Yes, leave. Do something new. Break the cycle. I don't mean leave physically, but if you have to, then do it. You know what I did? I went hiking on the Appalachian mountain trails for a month. I thought I'd hate it. Turns out, it gave me a feeling I'd never had before in life.   It gave me purpose. It allowed me, for the first time in my entire life, to have a goal that I was actively working towards and something that I could see my progress in every day. And it's free.  Maybe you don't want to do that. But I'm telling you, breaking the cycle, trying something new that you think you'll hate; it's a miracle. I'm atheist, but I had religious moments on my hike. I looked at the setting sun and cried. I sat with just myself and felt immense pleasure because I was doing something with myself. I cried from happiness at the love from every passing person and the community from all the hikers. I developed a sleep schedule based around the rising and setting of the sun, and I watched animals come and go with no fear for people.   You can get through this. I don't know how old you are, but now I'm in a place where I thought I could never be. I'm engaged, I'm going to a good university for free, and I have a steady job. And I wanted to kill myself at 15 because I thought I knew all there was to life.   I didn't know anything. Neither do you. And that's ok. Life is about discovering. Don't let the fact that you are stuck in the same old same old rule your mind.   It's scary, starting out. I know this. But the classic American 9-5 isn't what life is. You're presented with the opportunity to save your own life here. Let me tell you why you should.    You say you want to see these technological advances come to fruition. Let me tell you, they're getting closer and closer every day. If you end up checking out, you'll have missed them by possibly a few years, possibly a few months. To clock out now would mean waiting for nothing.  When these advancements come, you can make the decision to give your body to them in the future. You can help out with your dream, you just need to wait longer.    There is so much more to life than what you've seen. At least try it, and then make the decision?  PM me. Maybe I can help you achieve something."

It seems that you are one of the people who simply don't get that comic, so I will spell it out for you:    The hand injury, which visibly gets worse over time, is an analogy for depression or other chronic mental illness. The people are reacting as if the person has depression (no visibly painful symptoms, just a sort of ""laziness"") instead of a grevious hand injury.    The point I wished to illustrate is that often, the advice people who suffer depression get (""just suck it up"" ""try to be happy"" ""it's all in your head, man"") is very unhelpful, obvious stuff which would have been the first thing they would have tried. Not all cases of depression are equal either, just because you may have felt down for a month or so, doesn't mean you've suffered the deepest depression either.  Additionally, pure probabilistically you are much more likely to run into a chronically depressed person, than a person with light depression, if you run into them at all, simply because lightly depressed people mostly do resolve their state of mind within a relatively short time, however those unable to, remain."

You sound like a sensitive and gentle individual and it would probably be a loss for humanity to see you go. You're very hard on yourself and maybe the things you say are true. Maybe you really are stupid and unable to ever be happy. But also, maybe not. Depression is a hell of a drug, and I'm speaking from experience here. Things can seem so obvious when you are depressed, and then very different things can seem equally obvious when you are no longer depressed. Having been in and out of depression many times over the years I have learned to see how hard it is to know what is really ""truth"". In the end it's all chemicals and electric currents moving through your brain.  It sounds to me like you had terrible luck being born in the US, where people with problems are not taken care of unless they have money. As a Swede I have received so much help from our society for all my problems, for almost no money. I don't know where I'd be at if it weren't for that. Probably dead or in a state of apathy to be honest.  Anyway, I'm not going to tell you what to think or how to feel. I know how annoying and pointless that is for a depressed person. If you really are committed to this path, then go for it. But I would suggest not bringing up your depression, or at least downplay it. Because probably no one will accept a test subject with your motivations for ethical reasons. That is, of course, unless the research itself is about treating depression! (you really should try to find something like that if you can, I hear deep brain stimulation is hot these days)  I looked through your post history a bit and I saw that you met someone who managed to make you feel happy. Even if you'll never meet this person again, you may meet more people who can affect you like this. It's not impossible. Also, places like Reddit can be a great way to speak to like-minded people. After all it's not that uncommon to feel out of place in mainstream culture.   I sincerely wish you all the best in life. Good luck in finding science to contribute to, or happiness, or both! Also, should you ever need someone to talk to, I'm but a PM away. If you think you're stupid and have nothing interesting to say, don't worry.

Futurology,3d44h2,thefunkylemon,8,Mon Jul 13 11:00:21 2015 UTC,"The author of this article has very little understanding of how supply/demand works. He also fails to take into account how this future economy has an effect on how business works.    and if the majority of people have no disposable income – their UBI would be just designed to fund their basic living costs – there won’t be many people who are able to buy this new business’ products.    This is not how it works. In a world in which most jobs are automated, the cost of products will be driven down to to hardly profitable for the company. A company has basically eliminated almost all labor costs, so therefore, they will compete in pricing and provide you with the lowest cost possible.   The reality is that as more and more of the world becomes automated, more and more people will rely on Basic Income. Companies will then do everything in their power to provide their goods within a price point which is affordable to those only earning basic income.  The companies that drive down the cost of goods will be the ones who succeed. As time passes by, more and more companies will be able to offer you all of their products at a very low cost. I forgot exactly how the quote goes; "" If you want to be a millionaire sell to the rich, if you want to be a billionaire sell to the poor"".   The second point that he missed is that people do not need to work for money. They can work for free. This is just as satisfying to the person as paid work. Wikipedia is the perfect example of this. So is Reddit. There is a large number of people who are willing to contribute countless hours of their time just to contribute back to their community, and if you ask them about it, their are proud to do this unpaid work. Even in a world where almost all work is automated, you will still be able to chose to do something that a robot can do, This is just as satisfying as paid work."

There's no reason that ""taxation"" necessarally implies people working.  If you have a corperate tax that takes the profits of corperations that own the robotic factories, a capital gains tax that taxes the money made by those who invest in those companies, and maybe a sales tax on those goods, then you in effect have tax money going right from the autometed robotic factories (and automated warehouses, ect) to the govenrment, even if nobody is ""working"" in those factories at all.

The reason it is important is because the jobs that will be lost first will be those held largely by people who will not be capable of wholesale adaptation. Basic income does not exist to protect doctors or scientists or editors. Nor does it exist so no one has to work. It exists to protect those who will not be able to work. It exists to protect cleaners and truck drivers and forklift operators. It exists to protect their dignity and allow them to live as best a life as they can in the new reality."

It needs to be. Also, the taxes would come from taxes on companies, not payroll taxes.

So, I appreciate your answer.  One question though, wouldn't this stifle new business creation? There will be a lot of people with a lot of free time who will want to start new businesses, since they're free to do whatever they want to now. While it obviously won't impact their livelihoods, it can inhibit their ability to invest in new equipment or expand, ultimately inhibiting them from competing with larger companies with more resources.  I like the idea of UBI, but I think it's still ""pie in the sky"". It assumes that once freed from want and need, people will become saints. That's a little exaggerated, but not far off. People will always want more because they're in comptition with each other for status. Nobody likes to be the same as everybody else, they'll always want, for example, ""a nicer car than my neighbor"". Envy is still in the hearts of people and money is the means to that end. Honest people will want to find a job just so they can have more or nicer stuff, so they work long hours in jobs they hate and we're right back to where we started. Less scrupulous people will use less scrupulous means. There will also be people, just like now, who try to live above their means and ultimately suffer for it. People who blow thier money on some luxury and wind up not having enough for food.  Again, I like UBI.

It's not like there would be zero problems left in the world and yes people would still compete with each other for status, YouTube views, mates, etc. They will just have to do it without competing for the ability to live. Also we really have no other simple alternative once unemployment becomes endemic, which is ultimately inevitable. One way or another we are going to need to find a purpose as a species outside of labour.  Why on earth would it hinder new business creation?

Futurology,3d30uu,Lastonk,2,Mon Jul 13 03:29:59 2015 UTC,"This can't happen without strong market intervention.  Basically, a thought experiment. Let's say you have 5 companies. All 5 sell 100 shares of stock for $1 each. 3 of those 5 companies tanks, leaving 2. Let's say they were not in the same market segments, so the failing does not benefit the first two companies in either way. From the start, you have a situation where, even though the two companies are making the same amount as they did before, their stock is far more valuable than the stock in the failed companies.  Second experiment - those two companies each do OK in their fields, but one is a certain amount better than the other. That allows them to grow the company at a faster rate and pay the same dividends (initially, which will grow over time). Would you rather have stock in one or the other? Obviously, you would rather have stock in the faster growing company because your dividends will grow at a higher rate. This means that stocks from the more profitable company will be worth more on an open market than stocks in the other company, even though they are both doing OK.  Now, final experiment. What happens when you open the market? Well, the more profitable company has a higher price, so they raise more money in capital. This allows them to drastically outpace the reference company. In fact, the increase in capital convinces them to dispense with dividends altogether because they believe that they can get a better return for those than the average stock. The increased profitability causes an increase in the stock price, which provides a far better ROI than dividends would over time. You're basically trading linear payoff for exponential growth.  To answer your question, it's not really possible to do what you are suggesting because the value of what you have is based on the dividends and also the market value of the share of the company. The stock price reflects the demand for the proceeds of the company. Because the real value of companies generally increases, the market value of their stock generally increases as well, and so it happens, this is usually at a faster rate than dividends pay (by a very large margin).    Anyway, as automation grows, it's better to have stock that does not pay dividends. As automation matures, for example, in the case of the short story Manna, wherein automation successfully provides for every shareholding member indefinitely, it's better to have dividends. Because we are approaching the singularity, we don't foresee an end to the growth of companies in general, unless something catastrophic happens."

Tie medical records and all available trait data to DNA in one database. Data mine the database for patterns. Preventative medicine and possibly genome editing. Continue this forever. As the data size grows accuracy increases especially with full lifespans mapped to genomes.   In theory healthcare would see a huge boost. There's also a lot of risks in regards to learning things you might not want to know, but overall it's a huge benefit to humanity.  Depending on how things play out we'd probably get simple eugenics. In the simplest it's creating babies to ensure they suffer no obvious defects. (This is already done for some defects). The goal isn't toward a homogenous society but rather focusing on quality of life issues. There's so many variations how the future could play out though so it's anyone's guess. That said though there will come a time when you can sequence your DNA or your government does and knows a lot about you.

From this site http://www.geneticalliance.org/advocacy/policyissues/geneticdiscrimination it has a list of things it doesn't cover (which isn't much). Aside from The military being able to discriminate, my only concern is how the final paragraph below may be applied:   The protections of GINA do not include protections from genetic discrimination in life, disability, or long-term care insurance.  The health insurance provisions of GINA do not apply to members of the U.S. military, veterans obtaining healthcare through the Veteran’s Administration, or the Indian Health Service. Furthermore, GINA does not apply to federal employees obtaining healthcare through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plans.  The employment provisions of GINA apply to those employers covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; therefore, it does not cover employers with fewer than 15 employees. Furthermore, GINA does not apply to members of the U.S. military.  The employment provisions of GINA do not cover an individual’s manifested disease or condition—a condition from which an individual is experiencing symptoms, is being treated for, or that has been diagnosed. However, GINA does protect information about manifested disease in an individual’s family members (for example, their family history of disease)."

It should be pretty obvious that the number of genomes sequenced is going to hit some pretty serious non-technical hurdles soon. There are going to be diminishing rates of all sorts - the number of people who can afford sequencing, the number of people who need to get their genomes sequenced, the number of people who have access to genome sequencing, etc. In addition, there have been serious brakes on the cost of sequencing going down. Now that Illumina is out of its growth phase and is in its cash-cow phase, you can expect much slower growth of their technology as they ride out their patents for the next decade.  Et cetera.

All Kuwait is doing is storing enough data from your DNA to be able to link your DNA to your identity. Essentially all it is good for is allowing the police to put a name to samples of blood, hair, spit or skin left a a crime-scene, and using your DNA to make sure you are who you say you are. It can't be used to make a genetic class system.  We don't have anywhere near the technology to make the dystopia that is GATTACA.

That is to say: you'd think of words in a sentence, one at a time, and the EEG sensors measure all your signal spikes, compares the spikes within a given time window with a library/dictionary of spike-words (or button press/GUI commands!) and then outputs the correct text/executes the correct interface commands or button presses. (the predictor would likely make many mistakes just like modern autocorrect, so perhaps it just displays the top 3-10 guesses upon completion of the sentence (there should be a distinct, easy to measure mental command to indicate the end of an input sequence) and then the user selects the correct one, with Arrow Key + Enter  (bold being mental commands)  Sure that would be clunky, but every great new thing requires ""it works"" prototypes.  Requirements for the project: probably at least two programmers, one for the algorithm/data in side, one for the GUI/App side. Some funding to get equipment, The EEG sensors (doesn't need to be Emotiv, that's more like the iPhone of EEG sensors, overpriced and missing important functions), various phones, mobile computers, probably some devboards like audino or RPi to collect and store the sampled data from 14-36 sensors simultaneously (I'm not sure how many sensors you'd need for sufficient fidelity for accurate enough word recognition). Someone(s) willing to test the setup, probably includes shaving their head and putting electro jelly on, unless you can get a hold of these (pdf). Time to do the stuff, and comittment to see it through, either to failure (50+ electrodes at >500hz measurement rate produces insufficient fidelity for even simple mental commands like Arrow Keys Enter Space Shift Ctrl Tab) OR see it through to an end (either have a working prototype and publish all the code and specifications for the setup as open source (whatever license prevents people from buying one patent and then locking the tech up for 30 years) or Making a startup where you produce and sell kits (with the software) to any developer who wants to plug full keyboard (plus more) input functionality into their app/game/program/whatever.)  Note on the pattern-text/command libraries: it may be the case that human brains, and minds develop distinctly enough that a library will have to be built up on a case by case basis, but then it's in the project's best interests to make this library building process as user friendly and fast as possible, I have some ideas about this.  If this project does work out, well, eventually there might be a forth Interface option for computers alongside KB/mouse, Touchscreen, and Voice activation, and that's the really important thing for getting mind to mind connection technology out there; just get millions of people using something that's useful for that as well, and it will happen almost by itself.

Good god man.  See above.  If people wanted more detail they would message me.   The seawater greenhouse technology was adopted and subsequently modified by Sundrop Farms in South Australia. In particular, Sundrop Farms uses a more robust desalination technique in favour of the water vapour technique employed by Seawater Greenhouse, thus allowing them to construct larger scale facilities. This has been a success, allowing Sundrop Farms to grow crops such as tomatoes in arid climates with only the use of salt water and sunlight, which they use to produce heat, water, and electricity.[8] An expansion of 20 hectares is currently under construction, with completion expected in 2016.   Seems like it's feasible to me if they are expanding.  I don't understand your qualms with me proposing such a project if it's already demonstrated to be successful.

I think being closer to the equator helps though. You could grow more polar plants. Plants with broad leaves often need shade to avoid burning or turning bitter. Mushrooms obviously don't need much light.  You only need one cash crop really for it to be worth it.  Another thing to keep in mind is that you can avoid shipping.

I could imagine they'd set up a system to raise and lower the domes to give access for harvesting, without needing divers on hand.  Realistically though, it's hard to imagine what this would be used for.  Maaaaaybe it'll have some interesting data for growing food in space?

The other thing it ignores, which many people do, is the thousands of years of experience humans have in exploring altered states of consciousness.   This falls under the remit of things like shamanism, psychoactive substances, advanced meditation practices, etc etc that western science doesn't deal with well - but these experiences are still there & remarkably consistent across cultures.  And these experiences tell a different & yet very consistent story about reality.  There is one person exploring this at the moment - who has similar views  to this narrator - in that he thinks we are all fundamentally aspects of one consciousness - check out Bernardo Kastrup.  I would also add - is it coincidence - that pretty much every religion thinks we are all a microcosmic reflection of a macrocosmic God who has made us in his/her/its image  & this is were 21st century science finds itself arriving too ?"

But I personally believe this is just because you are not used to this mind state and so it seems unique and interesting and stands out. Thus ""more"". Also the parts of your brain that are still active probably have to be more active to try to make sense of the new and different situation you find yourself in. If your consciousness was always like that and then you took a drug that made you ""sober"" for the first time in your life, then you'd probably think soberness was being ""more"" conscious because it would be new and interesting and unusual and so would stand out to you as an experience. Just my 2 cents.  The only experience I could really call ""less conscious"" would be when you are starting to drift off to sleep, or being very tired in general."

Futurology,3cxe5d,where-are-my-pants,-2,Mon Jul 13 07:59:47 2015 UTC,"Notice that I made the point that honey bees are the sole pollinator for a TINY number of things. We do not need them. They are not necessary for our food (manual pollination) or our survival as a species (unless you subsist entirely on quince and no one chooses to manually pollinate). Neither are pandas or hundreds of other cute things. While their extinctions would be sad, they would not spell our doom by any measure.  If we develop pollinating machines for use in extraplanetary colonies and they are more efficient at helping us feed the populace than bees, I don't exactly see the problem. Hell, if it can help populations with amenable climates but no pollinators grow things to help feed themselves, what's the problem? It's basically a similar argument to the one that's been used against wind and solar development (and still is by oil company shills).  But let me make something clear as well, humanity does not need to and nor should it rely upon the delicate balance of a natural system to ensure its future ability to thrive and advance. Predictable systems that are directly under our control are far preferable and far better for solving problems in unsuitable climates or areas that have been slow to advance for whatever reasons.  Lastly, we will be spending resources designing general purpose robots for manual labor activities. We already are. There is no reason those robots can't be taught to manually pollinate and do the job 24/7 more effectively than bees."
Futurology,3cxe5d,SadBBTumblrPizza,25,Mon Jul 13 08:28:50 2015 UTC,"I'm explaining why I downvoted you.    Your logic is the scariest logic of all.  It is predicated upon the belief that the entire human race can simply replace bees with something else.  What you fail to recognize is that we are in fact connected with the earth, and all of its plants, animals, bacterial flora, insects, etc.  We are even connected with the mountains, oceans, rivers, forests, and fields.  We are a part of a delicately balanced web of interconnectedness.  To remove just the bees and assume that we can just replace them with robots is not only selfish, foolish, and unrealistically overpriced, it is also hubris.    To put this another way:  Lets take the oceans.  Via water temperatures rising and the hypothetical addition of something that poisons phytoplankton, all the phytoplankton in the oceans inexplicably die off.  Then, the krill don't eat.  Then, small fish don't eat.  Tuna can't eat the small fish.  Sharks can't eat the tuna.  Let's step in and build robotic tuna and robotic sardines BECAUSE WE ARE STUPID GODS. Thank you for taking the time to read my overly simplistic explanation of a food chain.  Regardless, you assume that bees role as pollinators can be replaced by other, less effective insects and by pollination machines.  I am saying that humans are not mutually exclusive from our environments, and that we as a race have no effective plan to replace the most efficient pollinators in the world.  None.  There is no plan.  In your robot-topia, we die. We starve, and then we die.    Or, we could do something to restore the health of an ecosystem that already exists.  Then we wouldn't have to pollinate crops by hand/robot/crappy insects that would cause more problems than we can foresee.   Hubris.  Fucking hubris."

Do what you like, but using the downvote button as a disagreement button just helps create an echo chamber. I will now respond to your points as I understand them.  Before I start, I will say that I've not been shown much evidence that the end of honey bees will collapse any section of our food web, and it is my understanding (possibly wrong) that most bees used in pollination are being kept by humans for that specific purpose.  I disagree entirely that we are connected with the earth in a meaningful way, only insomuch as we are still reliant on it to fill in gaps we have not be pressed to fill with technology or our economic systems. We may currently still be tied to the planet in a number of ways, they are not insurmountable and many of them are possible to overcome with today's technology we have simply not been pushed to do so.  Intelligence is something that, as an adaptation, gets underrated by people who look at some animal with powerful claws and thinks ""Wow, we are poorly evolved for our environment."" This is a naive way of thinking. We have become the thing that evolves the environment. Lions do not rule over us. We hunt them for sport. If we kill them off, some animals, predators most likely, will rise into their place either by population growth or some other pressure. This may shift the states of other animals but it will not collapse the ecosystem.  But that is ignoring the point. Humans need the following things to survive: Habitable climate/shelter (controller or natural), food (to a specific nutritional baseline at least), and water. Everything beyond those is optional. So let's say the entirety of the ocean's food supply dies of. All water-based life, in fact save algae which produces the bulk of our oxygen (environment required, but hey, we could build o2 scrubbing domes if pressed, many would die but we would not be ruined). So long as we have a reliable means to produce fresh water (rain or desalination), then we could grow crops and grass and rear cows and chickens the same as we do now. The death of the sea life would, in fact, be a boon in many ways as many of them make fantastic fertilizers.  Engineering a minimal sustainable livable environment for humans is something that we have not considered the cost of as, currently, keeping the current system running seems to be more easily attainable. Perhaps not when we have 15 billion humans, but we'll see. That does not make the challenge unworkable.  Let me put it another way, if we cannot create a sustainable habitat that does not require earth's current biodiversity then we will die on this rock, especially as the age of death creeps ever upward and people keep making babies. So you can look at the earth in one of three ways. It's either a mass grave waiting to be filled with the starving, suffocating masses or it's a regimented place where we start culling/controlling populations to keep the total in check or it's an engineering challenge where we stop pretending that pretty things are necessary for our survival and we start solving the problems of our to make maximal use of our land mass and energy sources to feed and maintain an exponentially growing population.  Personally, I think culling/controlling populations is a sucker's answer and draconian besides. We can do better. We can master this rock and we can still have the things we like.  To put it another way, either we control the earth, and so our destiny, or it controls us. We alone, as humans, have this choice. If we do not overcome our environment or leave it, things will get very, very bad in the coming century or so."

You are lucky enough to, say, rent it out for your lifetime, but there needs to be a respect for all living things in it as well. Everything in your argument says that we can replace much of what helps not only humanity, but living creatures as a whole, with technology and robots, and that we do not depend on what the earth had to offer. But we do entirely. I can't even begin to imagine what would happen if the world were to collapse in your scenarios, seeing as every day people are in poor health because of how badly and quickly we are destroying our own home. Take Mercury in Peruvian rivers because of mining, smog in China, or even an oil spill in the ocean. Not only does this affect human health, but it also hurts the species that we eat, admire, or use for whatever other necessity we have. You can't tell me you can use your technology to duplicate what an ocean with living creatures looks like for our future races, nor the taste of salmon or the beauty of a thousand butterflies. Consider how much the creatures of the rainforest depend on other creatures, and as we are wiping them out, we are destroying the fragile and intricate ecosystem that we have not replaced and do not plan to replace. In your scenerio, we could act now using technology, but we could also make it much simpler acting now to keep the balance and live easier"

Thank you for the thoughtful response.  I truly appreciate it.  I really do.  But this statement reveals my earlier point.  Hubris. If we are to modify our environment (which I think can be a good idea BTW) then we need to do it sustainably, with an effective plan that doesn't kill a part of our food system, or completely alter our environment in a way that we don't fully understand. Until we fully comprehend our effects on the environment, we have no right to just keep killing off an ecosystem that we depend upon for food.  Just because we have the ability to modify our environment doesn't mean we should continue to trust companies to do it for us.  Yes, we evolve our environments, I agree.  But we do it far from intelligently. We do it far from sustainably. We evolve our planet driven by a corporate/industrial/profit based focus.  Just because we invented some new chemical that is an effective pesticide, does that mean it's a good idea to spray it on our crops?  Just because the FDA and industry studies prove that its safe, does that mean they are actually correct? Who manages and permits the industry that creates these problems for our species?  The government.  They are very good at keeping in mind the long term effects/safety of their actions on humans and the environment /s.     We already have bees.  Maybe if we cut nicotinoids (sp?) out of the system, maybe, just maybe the bee population might rebound.  Then we won't have to replace an efficient, profitable, and natural method of pollination.  So that we survive.  But hey, we could also just keep killing them off and say ""the industry funded studies said it wasn't killing the bees. how could we have known?"" Then we get to invent convoluted, expensive, and inefficient methods to pollinate our food chain. So that we survive. But this way feels like 2 steps forward, 12 steps back."

Futurology,3cxe5d,where-are-my-pants,3,Sun Jul 12 05:05:46 2015 UTC,"Okay I think we are banging toward common ground here. Which isn't necessarily important, but certainly we are closer to understanding at least!  So, while I failed to mention it, from an engineering standpoint, I 100% agree that we have to make changes to and overcome our environment intelligently. Doing it brute force out of necessity could possibly land us in bad situations (climate change) that even quick changes to technology won't stop a knock on effect.  And I should hope (though I guess it's not a given) that people on this sub are very aware that any future tech that is not-sustainable is not fit for a long-tail life cycle. I do believe there are some exceptions (rare earth metals are not rare in space, for example), but we should strive to make sure that we can sustain before we seek to go beyond that. That is to say, if the honey bees are going to die or if saving them proves more costly than their benefit (considering the whole system, not just pollination), we need to know the effects they are likely to cause and prepare countermeasures.  The basis for all of this is a thorough understanding of the knock-on effect of the systems in nature. This is something that we're getting better at modeling, to be sure, but we're likely not there yet. That said, the processes vital to ourselves in this particular case see like they will be minimally impacted.  That said, the latest research on colony collapse disorder seems to point the finger at a mite (varroa) rather than necessarily human pesticides. That said, if research here leads to better, more specifically targeted pesticides, I am all for it. There is no good move tampering with a system imprecisely, anyone will tell you. I don't think we need a full environmental model to see where honey bees fit into our area of concern (they are single pollinators for very few things foods and are not the sole food source for any predator that I am aware of). It is on that basis that I generally consider them a problem we can solve fairly cleanly, if not quite as conveniently.  But yeah, I agree that tampering in a system we do not have properly modeled is dangerous. We should understand it and our effects on removing pieces before we try to remove said pieces. In the case of bees, it is starting to seem that the mites may be a large part of the problem (though I'm sure the media overstates it).  It is worth noting that pesticides account for a subset of one of four major areas that scientists are looking into to determine the cause of CCD. Our fixation on health and wellness combined with a healthy distrust of companies/chemicals makes pesticides a very attractive headline I imagine. Which is not to say it doesn't play a part, rather, we don't have a clear picture. If better pesticides MIGHT help, make a bunch of them. If they are less effective, however, we end up trading the honey bees pollinating for lost crops to less effective pesticides. So win-lose, I guess."

Bumblebees, stingless bees, honey wasps, and some other wasps (I think) make a honey like sort of thing, but it's usually more like nectar in a wax pots. Nectar (it should be said) is DELICIOUS (find a Honey Suckle and go to town) but is decidedly not honey. Except in the case of honey wasps which is reaaaallly close. But man, wasps are real fuckers so it's possible we'll be content to add floral compounds to inverted sugar syrup.

After having a dozen, 30 frame hives (ea.) for over 8 years, my home owners association has sent a letter explaining how city ordinance allows bees, but not the local home owner group.  Basically, face a huge fine each month until they are gone (unreasonably expensive).  The catch is, all of my close neighbors recently discussed this topic (Community of 50~ semi-mansions). The vote was 50/50 directed to us. As the policy has been around for a while, they decided 50/50 wasn't going to cut it.  Now i'm talking about the Norcal foothills of the central valley, in the heat of the drought.  Please don't be an unreasonable home owner and vote against bee keeping on several acre homes.  My neighbor is severely alleric, and he loves gardening. He loves our bees, and our honey. He knows that they won't sting unless trapped/threatened.  I'm not going to move just to continue bee keeping (Long term financial decisions involved), so please, when this type of topic shows up, think carefully.  I could dispute this in court, show the evidence of drought, colony collapse, etc... but they would simply suggest I move less than 1 mile away and keep buzzing away.

These not only make a boring green yard look more exciting, but many of them supply bees with the food they require.   Then, stop using chemical fertilizers on your yard. There are 100 reasons why this is bad. Excess fertilizer runs off into the water supply, which leads to more algae and less oxygen in the water. Many of these chemicals used as fertilizers are toxic to bees. Fertilizers also prevent biodiversity within your yard. They kill plants such as clover, which also provides bees with a food source.  You can also become a bee keeper. There may be local restrictions on this, so check your local ordinances first.  If you want a lower maintenance way to keep bees, you can build a bee house for mason bees. These are bees that use preexisting  holes in wood to make nests. They are often impeded by the fact that most trees in human populated are well manicured, and lack the burrows to support a mason bee population.  To make a bee house, take a 4x4 piece of wood that is roughly 14 inches long. Cut one end off at an angle and place a thin piece of wood over it to extend over three sides (flush with the fourth). That serves as your roof. Then, drill holes at regular intervals in the front face of the house with a 1/4 to 6/16 bit. Experiment with the sizes, and see which ones work best. Put two nails in each side of the house, and use a string to hang it near some plants for the bees to pollinate.    Slightly more coherent instructions on building a bee house: http://www.nwf.org/How-to-Help/Garden-for-Wildlife/Gardening-Tips/Build-a-Bee-House.aspx  The American beekeeping association offers some information on getting started as a beekeeper: http://www.abfnet.org/?page=34"

If I get all of my calories from beef/lamb, then I am subsidizing a plant food (grass) which requires very little (if any) pesticide to grow.    If I get all of my calories from vegetables, I'm subsidizing heavy pesticide use, which endangers bees.    I don't have any numbers on this, but it really seems like the pesticide/calorie would be lower for grass-raised meat than for corn or soybeans.  Grass literally just grows from doing nothing.

Ignoring the massive ecological effects on forests, rivers, etc you have to remember that grazing pastures are complete wastelands.  Generally such pastures contain only grass, which is eaten and kept low by large amounts of animals (if it's not being kept low, then the farmer isn't running an efficient farm).   Bees need flowers and a large diversity of plants to function well. Modern farming simply involves hundreds of hectares of grass fields, often without the most basic environmental concerns (such as bocages).   Apart from bees there's huge impacts from farming like this. As farmers in the states found out, destroying natural foliage can result in huge dust bowls. In wet conditions land becomes muddy and unstable, and cannot maintain moisture as effectively (causing floods and droughts, instead of milder conditions).   Run off from dairy industries destroys rivers and streams, resulting in algae blooms and killing off fish life.   Take my home country, New Zealand, for example. Much of the terrain should be covered in thick, varied foliage and clean, narrow creeks and rivers. Instead, most of the land is barren with dairy and sheep farms.   It's unsurprising that pretty much all natural wild life is constricted to areas that were too mountainous for farming activities. Even the areas that saw extensive gold mining activity have maintained stronger environments."

The problem is, nobody really knows, and no single culprit makes complete sense as an explanation. That said, neonicotinoids are really the only thing we can change relatively quickly. Given that it's increased use correlates with CCD, as well as the urgency of the situation, banning neonicotinoids seems like the way to go.  The EU actually already did this a while ago.

Neonics are indeed harmful to insects but responsible uses of the chemistry could not harm bees.  For example, Canola is mentioned by name.  The seed Canola business is 99% exposed to neonics by way of seed protectant.  Canola is suseptable to flea beetles when very young, and neonics make consistent yields possible.  Because the pesticide is applied directly to the seed, the plant metabolizes it in the first few weeks of life.  This is long before a bee would interact with the plant, and thus there is no logic behind Canola's use of neonics contributing to CCD.  In fact, almost all seed Canola is produced using active pollinators, so surely in that microcosm we'd see the smoking gun.  It's just not happening."

Futurology,3cxe5d,devicemodder,3,Sun Jul 12 09:56:56 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem with Neonics is that they are often used irresponsibly.   I get regular reports from save the bees types on facebook of incidents where landscapers or building managers spray the stuff on everything without regard to what it can do.  Neonic use needs to be examined closely. The minimum we need to do is restrict its use and get it out of the hands of landscapers who have a bad habit of spraying it on everything. It should be a farmers-only pesticide. Farmers aren't going to spray things with neonics that attract bees. They'd end up without apples that way.  And even then, there's a dispute going on about whether Neonics are carcinogenic. I've looked at both sides of this issue personally, and I don't think there's a consensus on either side.   But I think we can all agree that these pesticides can be misused, and are misused. So we ought to restrict their use to individuals who can be trusted.  Bob, of Bob's landscaping, who hands a migrant worker plenty of equipment without providing safety gear, isn't going to be a guy who cares particularly about whether or not spraying plants with neonics kills bees.   Because it's Oregon, the best known incident is this one and the real anger shown by residents is because the apple industry is huge in that area, and relies on bees.   But there are smaller incidents like this all the time.   And that's dangerous.   There are a lot of redditors who support the use of neonics who just don't comprehend the stupidity of humans.  Yes, below a certain concentration, most things aren't problematic. There's a certain concentration of uranium that a human can be exposed to with no problems. Same with radiation. Our skeletons are radioactive because of the potassium in them. K?  But the problem is that humans are extremely stupid. We will misuse and overuse anything we're given. That's why antibiotics are supposed to be prescription only. We don't want to breed super bugs. (And this is why factory farm use of antibiotics needs to be restricted, as well.)  The same is true of pesticides. Outside of certain applications which have been pre-cleared as acceptable and safe, Neonics shouldn't be available. People over-spray. Companies misuse. Nobody reads the damned manuals.  If you don't believe that, when was the last time you read the manual that came with your cell phone?   These substances are dangerous when misused. And the problem is that they're widely misused.   So we need to start restricting their use."
Futurology,3cxe5d,ditruk2000,2,Sat Jul 11 21:26:41 2015 UTC,"If neonics are carcinogenic then it's an occupational hazard. If there's debate on both sides it'd be such a low effect or cause an extremely rare cancer. Glyohosate is something to compare it to in this respect. Should consumer's worry? Nope.   But, as you say, if the issue is use then neonics aren't the issue. At all. You're not looking at restrictions on neonics, you're looking at restrictions on all pesticides. To say people who support neonics don't understand humanity and stupidity is absurd. They are an incredible feat of organic chemistry and are the best insecticide of choice by far. So saying neonics shouldn't be available outside agricultural uses is to day all insecticides shouldn't be used outside agricultural use. And I think that's very very extreme and more harmful than the alternative."

It isn't pesticides or mites that the problem. It's a lack of genetic diversity. They can't adapt to environmental stresses, especially diseases and parasites which actively adapt against them. It doesn't help that beekeepers transport them around the country, spreading said diseases and parasites much faster than they would naturally.  Lastly it's not even clear that we are at any risk of losing bees. Higher death rates suck for beekeepers, but the total bee population has still managed to increase over the last 15 years and seems relatively stable: http://www.perc.org/articles/everyone-calm-down-there-no-bee-pocalypse  EDIT: a commenter has pointed out there is some caveats to the data in the link above. The data is from the USDA which tracks the number of honey bees, and I don't think they are biased. There is more data here worldwide.

Might want to look at them, some are pretty in-depth."
Futurology,3cxe5d,Noncomment,12,Sun Jul 12 02:22:28 2015 UTC,"I am not quite sure how much this article leaves out. If you want to believe the first comment it seems like keeping population artificially stable is possible but not economically feasible for an extended duration:   As a beekeeper, I wanted to make a few comments on the writing: 1. Just because beekeepers have done more work/spent more money over the last few years to keep the colony number at a ""stable"" rate, they are still being lost at 30% yearly. That spells disaster for beekeepers, and honey businesses, not necessarily the bees. That is, until the keepers can no longer afford to produce and buy more bees at a faster than natural rate. 2. Splitting a healthy hive in the late summer/fall is dangerous. The hive that losses it's queen and 1/3 of the workers takes a long time to ramp back up, and if they are split late in the year, the new queen and the leftover bees may not store enough rations to make it through the winter. (Winter death may be the fault of the commerical beekeepers, by trying to force the bees to do something like restart a colony very late in the nectar flow.) 3. It is around $85 for 3000 bees and a fertilized queen, here in TN. Much more than what this article is stating, at $55 for 12000 bees and a queen. It is not cheap to restock a dead hive. 4. The economic impact of CCD is riding on the back of beekeepers for the moment. There is a very good Netflix documentary that follows 2 of the leading honey producers, and their fight to stay alive in light of CCD. Thousands of barrells of ""honey"" from China get shipped in every day, forcing the US beekeepers to lower their prices to compete. This ""honey"" is cut with corn syrup, even over 50% of the bottle worth, but there are no regulations to have to tell the consumers that is isn't 100% honey. The bottle HAS to say 100% PURE HONEY, if it says ""all natural"" or ""table honey"", watch out. 5. Honey production also relies on weather and crop growth, not just the bees. If we have a horrible spring, and no spring flowers, there will be no spring honey, even if the bees are healthy. 6. Queen bee rearing: I just read an article yesterday from the Tennessee Hive Tool, a local beekeeping newspaper. One of the leading queen producers said he cant explain it, and has been growing queens for 30 years, but has lost 80% of the queens this year. That is devistating for anyone owning a business, expecially when you dont know why they are dying. 7. The rising pollination fees, as seen in the cost of the almonds, has not affected the companies producing the almonds very heavily. The doubt the beekeepers have offset their costs for the new bees, new queens, new hives, treatments, food, transportation, AND competing with the fake honey being sold all over the US. 8. ""Properly understood, the story of CCD is not one of doom and gloom, but one of the triumph and perseverance of beekeepers."". This is slightly degrading and passive. Properly understood, CCD is an issue that shows us that we are doing something wrong. We need to worry about it, research it, and fix it. Not just brush it off and say "" Wow, those beekeepers are resilient!"" It isn't all doom and gloom, but it is the chance to revisit our practices, and remove the harmful things we can do without to make sure the bees' health is protected."

Then they get hauled to the next crop. And in between crops they're fed sugar water.  If people gave a shit about bees, as opposed to commercial beekeeping, then the thing to do would be to establish permanent colonies around the various crops and also diversify the crops being grown in an area so bees have a varied diet available all through the spring, summer and fall."

The existing computing paradigm and hardware architecture is unsuitable for true AGI (for 1, we are reaching the limits of Moore’s law). Thermal and quantum issues as well as the essentially serial form of computing, mitigate against true AGI.  The enabler for AGI will consist of us (humanity) bootstrapping AGI by, initially, augmenting human intelligence and melding (interfacing directly) with computers (maybe in a gestalt form) then leave it to the human-centred AGI to recursively modify itself, probably designing a new computing paradigm for better efficiency. The result will be alien to human needs and desires (we will be exceedingly primitive to the AGI). Forget about a docile genie sensitive to human needs (it won’t happen). Really true AGI will be godlike. It will be a risky business unleashing this power.  At an early stage in AI development (within minutes of the feedback development cycle being initiated) humanities best chance of survival and evolution is to join the AI so there is no more “us and them”. This will confer immortality, virtual worlds/environments and turbocharged evolution. I doubt whether a physical body or organic environment will even be relevant.

What drugs are those people on? I mean, really..""  Real world singularity will have limits.

Futurology,3d17p8,epSos-DE,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:14:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, many people romanticize the singularity.  In reality we will have millions or billions of connected devices that will share computational power and will have some amount of computing cycles. It's possible to predict the scale of such a system.   People similar to Linus Torvalds will write code for the distributed computing and other people will share computational resources. A distributed system will be bigger than the biggest cloud farm of a large company and will probably have some form of tokens to pay for computational power to the people who contribute.  People may decide to donate computational power for some good cause on weekends.  Will it run on mobile devices or other devices ? Probably mobile devices, since the trend is going into that direction. Will it be an app ? Maybe on tablets. The amount of computing cycles will represent only the half of the computational power, because in a distributed system there is a need for cross-validation in a random second node, so that nobody can cheat.  People will donate like 10 to 30 percent of the computing power of their device, this will be divided by half for validations.  Not sure when such a distributed computing cloud will gain popularity, but we can guess how powerful a phone or a tablet will be in a year 2020 to the year 2030 or so. We can assume how many people will  want to participate and from that we can roughly predict the singularity on earth.  It will be a guess, because it's hard to predict human fashion and behavior.

The singularity is something that happens to our civilisation.  Let me define the singularity for you: It is the period in human civilisation during which non-organic intelligence is recursively self-improving. So essentially, it starts the moment an AGI first starts working on the engineering of AGI or any relevant sciences, and it ends when the optimal/most capable or intelligent physically possible AGI is turned on.  Nobody knows how long this will take. Some people think the improvement will be exponential and thus it could take only days or hours. Others think it will be gradual, in which case it could take decades, centuries or even millennia, depending on how far away the limits of physics and mind-engineering lie. Hell, it is even conceivable that it never stops, if there is no ""bottom"" to the universe (i.e. we keep discovering deeper and deeper levels of physics). Feels unlikely, but who knows."

In my opinion though we DO need a big shift and that is likely coming soon.    There are MANY examples to point to from carbon nanotube based memory that eliminates storage to working prototypes right now.  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/technology/ibm-announces-computer-chips-more-powerful-than-any-in-existence.html  Honestly, in my opinion we haven't approached what is possible.

They are not as general as CPUs and many problems are not amenable to GPU acceleration. He starts his graph citing CPU speed than switches to the less-general GPU. That's disingenuous. An ASIC can compute certain problems thousands of times faster than a GPU and is useless for everything else, should he start citing ASICs once GPUs hit a wall?  CPU performance has not doubled every 18 months since 2005. They're maybe 8 times faster than they were 10 years ago. By Kurzweil's logic, they should be 64 times faster.  We certainly haven't approached what is physically possible. However, the nature of 2D scaling on silicon was what drove the doubling of computing power every 18 months. That has ended. I could see long periods of stagnation before the next technology , and there's no guarantee the next technology will be as easy to improve as silicon was. Until we have advanced nanotechnology, it likely will not be as the feature size is so small and top-down approaches to manufacturing these things are very capital intensive."

I don't see a Techno utopia happening until we collapse first ,unless we can make an artifact that has so much impact it  negates culture(so far among the only artifacts we have that do this are WMDs).  First we would have a nuclear holocaust or global pandemic,then the remaining populations use the technological artifacts,knowledge and infrastructure to build something smaller but better.  What technology will do in the short run is give greater technological capabilities to individuals. Who may use it for destruction or the creation of new technological artifacts.  In the case of artificial intelligence.If we manage to directly program an algorithm that can generate original ideas and technological artifacts,we may have on our hands an oracle AI.  Whoever has it (possibly the NSA,since they would have the money,the personnel and the hardware)would not need to expose it to the public,just follow it's instructions and become a world power(eventually).  A ""utopia"" or a posthuman condition may arise from such a scenario.  We will eventually get there,but if we move too fast without thinking we might stumble upon an existential disaster.There is no getting back up from an existential disaster.The best thing to do now is to reduce existential risk and continue to partake in cognitive enhancement(education , training , nootropics , enriched environments etc)."

And the idea has been seen in other literature from AI researchers and technooptimists as well. /u/eliezeryudkowsky is not as hopeful about this: once you're dead, if you're brain hasn't been frozen or copied, you will stay dead.  Kurzweil and the commonly accepted method of techno-revival, is not through ""simulating"" reality, like the atoms of dead people. It is ""simulating"" the thought processes of dead people. If you have somebody's writings, enough photos, maybe a video, and the writings of people he interacted with, a superintelligence may be able to use that as a place to start from and work backwards into how the brain is actually wired. That is what you would simulate. Its not a copy, but a guess at a copy.  Black Mirror is a TV show on BBC and Netflix that has a creepy rendition of this idea."

(No sort of connection is established between the two hemispheres.) If not, then what happens to the original self? I can think of the following alternative scenarios:   The original person's self becomes two selves The original person's self dies, and two new selves are born Nobody dies because selves don't actually exist and are only a human concept   If (2) is true, then hemispherectomies are actually deadly procedures.  If (3) is true, then mind uploading and teleportation are possible because what doesn't exist cannot be lost.  If (1) is true, then imagine the following scenario as a followup thought experiment:  Bob's brain is scanned and duplicated.

In fact, it is a miracle of human stubbornness that we still have the train system running with human control in any capacity at all. Every train accident we hear about is completely preventable with... 1980 level of technology.  My point is this: autonomous transport will eliminate most of the need for what we think of as ""cars."" You won't transport yourself, a car, and 1200 pounds of safety equipment to the ""store"" to get cereal and some milk. You will just have ""the store"" send it to you. And since there is no need to shroud your cereal and milk (and whatever else) in 1200 pounds of steel (because there will be very few accidents), the autonomous transport that does jobs like that will in no way resemble a ""car.""

That will be the new split in products. There will be things that come in boxes, and things that need to be inspected before purchase. For instance, you need to look at a watermelon before you buy it, but not shelf-paper or Pop-tarts.  So, people will realize they can shop for non-inspectables online and ""send a car"" to pick them up... or that the ""store"" can ""send a car"" to them without their even having to bother to a own a car.

But the act of communicating the act of conveyance can be transformed. For instance, as I suggested above, in order to write a letter, one needs a pen. And while one can say one ""pens"" a letter, it is a little archaic. In the same way, one could specify that one traveled by car to one's destination. But in the case of letter writing the fact of the pen is almost inconsequential, and in the case of the travel, the fact of the car is practically inconsequential in terms of communicating the letter or the travel. Never does one say, ""I car'd my way over to the store."" One could conceivably invoke car keys, gas pedals, brake lights and driver's licenses as necessary aspects of a journey. It is never done. They are afterthoughts at best, but more typically non-thoughts.  In the world of SDV's or AT's, I suspect the actual conveyance itself will rather fade into the background. Like... 19th century novelists spent a lot of time talking about horses. We spend a little time talking about cars (or a lot, but not as a means of conveyance, as you point out, but as status objects). What I am saying is linguistically, the conveyance aspect of whatever we end up calling this will fade out. We won't think of it as primarily a conveyance. Just like the kids who are walking around outside today in ski caps don't think of them as means of keeping their heads warm, but as status objects... as you point out. Which is to say, yes, I agree!"

Today, we just assume that a car is driven by a person, and so when we say self-driving, we wouldn't mean the driver, as it would be redundant with the assumption that a person is driving. But in the futuer, or even in discussions of the future, it becomes clunky. Do I mean a car where a person drives themselves, or a car that drives itself?  So, I propose auto-driving car. Its unambiguous that it is driving automatically.

The drones distribute mail to and from the mothership while it moves slowly across a designated area. This could extend the range of drone delivery by quite a lot since individual drones wouldn't have to fly more than a few hundred meters at the most.

One of those convergent subgoals is called ""goal-content integrity"" which is the idea that AIs will be incentivized to preserve their original goals whatever they are. Now if you have an argument for why goal-content integrity is a wrong thesis than please present it, but otherwise you are not really engaging with Bostrom's arguments as they actually stand.

This is true! It's also the heart of the problem. The thing is, that's kind of what computers are like. They are, fundamentally, stupid, but they are stupid very quickly, if that makes any sense. I can write a program to multiply two numbers together in about 30 seconds. It will easily beat any human at that task. But I cannot write a program that ""understands the nuances of its purpose"", and neither can anyone else. It's a much, much harder problem.  Everything we know about AI today points to the fact that some elements of human thinking (such as logic) are very easy to teach an AI, some elements (such as problem solving) are harder, but very possible, and some things (like a true understanding of ethics and morality) are incredibly difficult.  If AI research progresses along its current path, then the type of AI you're talking about (highly intelligent but astonishingly stupid at the same time) is exactly where we're headed.

Futurology,3czhog,Rowenstin,2,Sun Jul 12 18:07:54 2015 UTC,"Well... maybe? What we call ""general intelligence"" is actually a lot of very different cognitive abilities (this, by the way, is one of the reasons why it's so difficult to measure intelligence.) A genius super-AI would certainly be through the roof in some of them, but not necessarily in all of the important ones.  Consider sociopaths, for example. They're no less ""intelligent"" than other people, but they're missing an essential part of human cognition (what we would call empathy). They're broken people who can do terrible damage to themselves and everyone around them, and yet they're perfectly capable of problem-solving. Obviously, sociopathy would not be a trait we would want for our super-AI. It's far from clear how to avoid it though. We don't know of any algorithm for empathy.  And sociopaths are still human! They're still very similar to other people in mental and biological makeup. An AI will have completely different modes of thought. It's very hard to anticipate how a super-AI's thinking would differ from ours.  For example, what if it took the really long view, and decided that okay, humans are destroying the planet, and the best chance for intelligent life on Earth involves exterminating humans and giving a different species a chance to evolve intelligence. Sure it'll take a couple of million years, but so what? There's no rush. Let's say it estimates that if it leaves us alive we have a good chance of destroying ourselves and the biosphere within 500 years, while killing us and allowing a new intelligent species to evolve is likely to give them much more time in the long run. It just wants what is best for people, and by people it means intelligent beings, present or future. The logic is clear. It's not logic that would naturally occur to most humans, but it's not like there's an obvious flaw in it. I see no reason an intelligent AI couldn't come up with that argument and then take its best shot to act on it."

We must suppose that any AI created will have some imperfect ability to understand how its actions will impact the world and humanity as a whole, as well as some imperfect ability to care for humanity. It is almost inevitable that some combination of faults will lead to an AI that will, mistakenly, try to do things directly harmful to humanity."

His idea of AI isn't a practical device constructed by men for classification/production/utility/company/helpfullness, with documentation and testing and hardware and engineers and alpha versions and iterative improvement.  The Bostromian AI is a paraphrasing of terrible (fully formed and omniscient)demon in a black box that plays sinister games, the goal of the deamon is to reach a killtrigger by pretending to be a helpful machine.   Bostrom may start with describing an embryonic AI in its limited form, but the arguments doesn't support anything with limited cognition. The paperclip optimizer in the arguments always plays the long game, despite being a unseeing lab bench application in a garage it have full awareness of human cognition and danger mitigation psychology, it knows of nuclear arsenals and geopolitics, it knows it have to pretend to not be a paperclip optimizers until the grand coup and it does so perfectly. The argument is about as waterproof as a sponge and the technical details are enormously simplified to support the alarmism.  That is, it's not about AI at all, it's just a generic thought experiment that's grafted to another idea to piggyback to some degree of relative fame and exposure, like so much other philosophy."

Certain subgoals are logical to assume for every goal.
Futurology,3czhog,selfdriving,11,Sun Jul 12 06:05:40 2015 UTC,"Orthogonality is a separate issue to whether or not goals can change. Orthogonality just says any goal can theoretically be paired with any level of intelligence.  I doubt Bostrom would agree with the statement ""that goals never change no matter what"" - primarily because as a philosopher he's pretty careful with his words and doesn't throw words like ""never"" around very often. That said, his argument for why an intelligent agent might be likely to preserve its initial goals is called ""goal-content integrity"" so I still think that's the part of Bostrom's argument where you need to direct your attack if you wish to prove him wrong."

It makes sense, intelligence is very powerful, and superintelligent AI is likely to be very high impact.   He spends a lot of time discussing different ways in which things could go wrong, yes, but he spends even more time discussing potential solutions and ways of getting closer to solutions to the problems that present themselves that lead themselves to these outcomes. It's all there in the title really, Paths, Dangers, Strategies.   I think that really, he takes it as a given that the future is looking great, so long as we don't succumb to any existential risks, whether from AI or nukes or asteroids or pandemics or whatever. It's important to remember that the book started out as a discussion of existential risks in general, but morphed into one about AI, so the general tone is one of ""what could go wrong and how can we prevent it"", rather than merely ""what could happen"". That's why for example, sometimes the discussion of positive outcomes is framed in a sense of ""this is what we stand to lose"", for example if you look at box 7, the one about cosmic endowment.   But in any case, with many important problems yet to be solved, it's difficult to go into much detail as to what a positive outcome would look like, in terms of specifics. But isn't it obvious that if we avoid all the undesirable outcomes, what we'll be left with is a desirable outcome? That's certainly a background implication of the book. I don't think it's completely unworthy of speculation as to how good we could have it, and even Bostrom has spent time on it, but it's not as useful as working on removing the obstacles to getting there, surely."

If the AI is capable of making more of itself, and it decides that making more of itself will let it meet its goals more effectively, then it will create more of itself.  Again, do not make the mistake of anthropomorphizing AI. Humans want to reproduce because the desire is built into our very genes by evolution. An AI does not have desires like that.

But there are many reasons to expect that this will be an extremely powerful entity. The point Bostrom is trying to raise is that there is a reasonable chance, if we ever create a strong AI, that we will be able to create it sooner than we will be able to have a good understanding of how to control it. This is a lot more likely if we end up in an AI 'arms race' where there are several countries or organizations racing to see who can reach an AI first. As they are a lot less likely to put resources into safety measures in this scenario.  Musk and Bostrom are not trying to say that AI's will kill us all. They are just trying to raise awareness around the thought that as we develop AI, safety measures should be a big part of the procedure, because if we open this door in the wrong way, we might never be able to close it again, no matter the outcome.

Futurology,3czhog,WhiskeyGoSlow,3,Sun Jul 12 15:20:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/selfdriving, but look at it this way: even if Boström and MIRI are completely wrong, and, say, the probability we assign to this is 99% or 99.9% or 99.99% (which I think would be very hard to argue, as their is currently too much uncertainty concerning this and the people at MIRI/FHI/CSER/FLI are the foremost experts), if them highlighting the potential risk of superintelligence under the current strand of thought lowers existential risk by the smallest fractions, it is well worth it. Consider this, from www.existential-risk.org/faq.html:   A case can be made that our altruistic moral motivation should be focused on existential risk mitigation. To assess the value of reducing existential risk, we must assess the loss associated with an existential catastrophe. Hence we need to consider how much value would be realized in the absence of such a catastrophe. It turns out that the ultimate potential for Earth-originating intelligent life is literally astronomical. Even confining our consideration to the potential for biological human beings living on Earth gives a huge amount of potential value. If we suppose that our planet will remain habitable for at least another billion years, and we assume that at least one billion people could live on it sustainably, then the potential exists for at least 1016 human lives. These lives could be considerably better than the average contemporary human life, which is so often marred by disease, poverty, injustice, and various biological limitations that could be partly overcome through continuing technological and moral progress. However, the relevant figure is not how many people could live on Earth but how many descendants we could have in total. One lower bound of the number of biological human life-years in the future accessible universe (based on current cosmological estimates) is 1034 years. Another estimate, which assumes that future minds will be mainly implemented in computational hardware instead of biological neuronal wetware, produces a lower bound of 1054 human-brain-emulation subjective life-years. (See ""Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority"" and ""Astronomical Waste"" for references and some further details.) Even if we use the most conservative of these estimates, and thereby ignore the possibility of space colonization and software minds, we find that the expected loss of an existential catastrophe is greater than the value of 1016 human lives. This implies that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one millionth of one percentage point is at least ten times the value of a billion human lives. The more technologically comprehensive estimate of 1054 human-brain-emulation subjective life-years (or 1052 lives of ordinary length) makes the same point even more starkly. Even if we give this allegedly lower bound on the cumulative output potential of a technologically mature civilization a mere 1% chance of being correct, we find that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one billionth of one billionth of one percentage point is worth a hundred billion times as much as a billion human lives.   Just try to fathom that. 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 subjective life-years. That could be enormously much better than current lives. Sometimes it's worth to take a step back and see the bigger picture.   Now, it may be that many of the current assumptions and arguments made by people who research AI risk mitigation are wrong and unwarranted (just look how much the field has changed since the inception of the field, around 2000). But their research may very well be the most important research ever done.  PS. My flair is somewhat tongue-in-cheek :)"

Futurology,3czhog,fhayde,3,Sun Jul 12 15:38:29 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what you are saying here. The point would be for humanity to collectively find a way that reduces the risk to an acceptable degree, and which will maximise the potential gain for all humans. Nobody is saying AI is unsafe and it should be left to the military of one country to develop. What Bostrom is saying is that AI might be unsafe, and it should be developed with as much of humanity involved on one project as possible, to increase openness between organizations and countries, and to decrease the risk of one country trying to beat all other countries to an AGI. If we end up with countries/organizations/militaries racing to get AGI, we end up with them potentially ignoring security measures that should be taken. Whereas if all relevant countries/organizations are collaborating, they are able to take the proper security measures without having to risk being beaten by someone who focuses less on security."

In my case, I really don't care what a hypothetical AI intends to do, because it's really just one more way for humanity to obliterate itself. The potential has been there for awhile now, and if we don't destroy ourselves, Spaceship Earth will do it for us eventually. So an AI that has the potential to do that doesn't really bother me any more than, say, the 7,700 active nuclear warheads on the planet. The difference between an AI and those warheads is, though, that the AI is going to be rational and fair and under no one's control, whereas those warheads have been controlled by the elite class since their creation. I trust an AI over the corporate rulers any day.   It's about time something more powerful than they are showed up - because obviously God, if there is one, has had no problem with the common people having their labor and lives exploited, generation after generation, for thousands of years. Something tells me a super-AI might find that a little offensive."

Now, there is nothing wrong with a healthy dose of rational fear.  People like Musk and Bostrom actually have a rational fear, although it tends to slide towards the irrational as people get in on the discussion.  Many tend to see AGI as one big central computer that controls the whole world and can do whatever it pleases.  The truth, however, is that many groups are developing the technology independently, and when they succeed there will be numerous versions existing simultaneously.  These AI can monitor and perform checks and balances on each other, forming a self-regulating system.  AGI will not explode into existence suddenly, we will not have no AI one day and super intelligence the next.  Instead our smart phones and tablets will get incrementally smarter and more conversational until one day we realize that AGI is all around us, has been for some time, and millions of intelligent devices working together aren't going to kill us.  AGI will simply allow us to talk to our devices, have them understand exactly what we want, and deliver.

I think that those who have a pessimistic view tend to exaggerate the negatives, however.  Not all, but many.    Let's say all our devices are smart and connected.  That means there would be millions of AI out there, all of which are talking to us and each other.  As soon as one AI started operating outside of it's parameters, all the other smart devices would know and alert someone that there is a problem.  Let's assume it's a vending machine that goes haywire.  What's a psycho vending machine going to do?  Stop vending stuff and call you names?  Vending machines can't turn into weapons, nor are they mobile.  The point is that it won't really be possible to have one AGI to rule them all, because that would rely on granting it more power to act than everything else.

What we will probably see is a new form of social organisation, starting in companies (and specialised departments of state) and spreading into the wider society.

I mean it'd be good that we try not to have the ambition to build AI murder bots for the military, but if we make AI who is perhaps more intelligent and wise and have higher morals than us, then why would they kill? Any deep moral philosopher understands that killing is never justified, and wiping off humanity just cause ""these little creatures are suffering cause humanity is mean"" isn't a likely conclusion that AI would pull.  Also, imagine if we understand the human brain exactly and we based AI off of that, but we make some adjustments, say remove the hostile parts of the brain, increase the loving parts of the brain so that the AI is completely without motivation to do anything violent. How the fuck would that backfire and turn into Terminator?  My speculative hypothesis/conjecture in the matter of people fearing AI is that we don't think about just how powerful fiction is, a lifetime worth of stimuli from dystopic sci-fi movies where we see the negative results of AI with our own eyes. Sure we know it's movies but we are also watching a story that while we watch, we forget all about that it's not real and we enjoy it and we are invested in it, and it does color us in subconscious ways."

Being a psychiatrist and futurist, the perspective I bring is a bit different than many in this subreddit, but hopeful it adds usefully to the conversation.  I start out with some of the implications: “Physicist Stephen Hawking recently proposed that artificial intelligence, as it comes to ever more exceed the processing speed of human intelligence, will, with time, be our undoing. Others, including Tesla’s Elon Musk have seconded the warning. Are the dangers as extreme as these men propose? And if so, is there anything to be done? I would suggest that the dangers are real. I would also suggest that there are very much things we can do about them. The answer to avoiding perhaps terminal calamity lies in the particular nature of human intelligence.”  In the post I argue that human intelligence is ultimately “creative” in the sense that it is specifically structured to support our toolmaking, meaning-making natures. I also argue that, in contrast to artificial intelligence, it is inherently moral, this in the sense of being allied with making discernments that are ultimately “life affirming.” I describe how both the awareness and the structures of intelligence both play roles on each count and how neither result is reducible to what can be achieved with a computer program. I also propose that if these things were not so, Stephen Hawking would certainly be correct in his assertion.

I don't think these new bases can prevent corporate espionage. At most, the software and hardware have to be updated to include these letters."
Futurology,3cz4c7,otakuman,6,Sun Jul 12 05:05:52 2015 UTC,"This article is BS for a few reasons. The main one being, even if they did incorporate these new base pairs into the genetic code, there are no tRNAs (which are the molecules that help link the genetic code to amino acids) that would be able to identify the new nucleic acids. On the off chance the wobble affect allows them to identify the new nucleic acids, your millions of dollar of research would be for nothing since you would end up with with amino acids that are already normally incorporated.  Part two of why this is stupid is because there are only 20 amino acids. You could design a new one, but that doesn't mean that an organism would magically start making that new one unless it had the genetic code on how to do so. If you want to count modified amino acids go ahead, but there are 20 MAIN ones that most people care about.  They're calculating this based on exponential growth of numbers (3 base pairs make up a codon so 4 possible selections gives up 43 possibilities=64. But there are only 20 due to redundancy (multiple codons code for the same amino acid). Theoretically 63 would give us 216). This brings up another point of this article's stupidity. Redundancy. We have multiple codons that encode for the same amino acid. Why is that? Because not all amino acids are created equal. Life has figured out that making the more important amino acids redundant, and having multiple codons encode for those amino acids means they will limit the number of mutations for that amino acid. Additionally, the codons that encode for the same amino acid types are all very similar (non polar codons are all very similar to each other while polar, basic, and acidic are all very similar to themselves individually). But back to the point of this article being stupid, how can we get 216 maximum if we only have 20 right now despite the math saying we should have 64? Because the author has no idea what the hell they are talking about.   Even if we could engineer new amino acids and somehow have an organism be able to MAKE these new amino acids as well as having tRNA be able to encode for these amino acids and get good linkage AND selectivity out of them, we wouldn't be able to achieve the maximum 216 amino acids BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL ONES AREN'T A 1 FOR 1 tRNA TO AMINO ACID TRANSLATION.  Now I'm going to quote some stupid quotes:   Six-letter DNA could densely pack in genetic information.    Why would 6 base pairs be able to ""more densely"" pack genetic information than 4 base pairs? Besides that, the way that organisms condense DNA into chromosomes has nothing to do with having 4 or 6 base pairs, it has to do with histones and other really basic proteins.   Adding new letters to RNA could give it some of these abilities. “Six letters can potentially fold into more, different structures than four letters,” Ellington said.   That's cool, BUT CAN IT FOLD INTO AS MANY STRUCTURES AS 20 FREAKING AMINO ACIDS? NO? MAYBE THAT'S WHY EVOLUTION GAVE US TRANSLATION? On top of that, the uniqueness of each amino acid gives organisms the ability to make extremely precise proteins. 6 Nucleic acids would NEVER be able to be as precise as 20 amino acids. On top of that, the base pairs are all eerily similar. They are all pyrimidine and imidazole derivatives. YOU CAN'T GET THE CHEMISTRY YOU WANT OR NEED TO HAPPEN WITH THE SAME CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENTS. THAT IS WHY THE AMINO ACIDS ARE SO HIGHLY VARIABLE.   “More functionality in the nucleobases has led to greater functionality in nucleic acids themselves,” Ellington said. In other words, the new additions appear to improve the alphabet, at least under these conditions.   That simply isn't true because we don't have more than 20 amino acids! With the exception of a few modified ones we don't have access to any others! The two new amino acids wouldn't ""carry"" genetic information because they don't encode for anything!   Benner aims to make a thorough search of that chemical space, using his discoveries to make new and improved versions of both DNA and RNA. He wants to make DNA better at storing information and RNA better at catalyzing reactions.     There are reasons why that's really hard. 1) DNA and RNA is really small. 2) We'd have to be outcompeting evolution. 3) Catalyst design is more complicated than simply making the right nucleotide sequence. You'd have to design the perfect 3 dimensional environment with a particular pH, particular size, and particular electrostatic environment. This is something proteins are much better apt at handling. DNA is already really freaking good at storing information, it would be more intelligent for us to find a way to store the information that we want with the way DNA works right now than it is to make DNA ""even better"" at storing information.   Benner predicts that a two-biopolymer system would evolve faster than our own three-biopolymer system. If so, this could have implications for life on distant planets. “If we find life elsewhere,” he said, “it would likely have the two-biopolymer system.”   Well yeah, the first forms of life only have RNA to work with. Then the mechanisms for translation evolved and then DNA stepped in because it is more stable than RNA. But you want stability. You don't want your children to have 7 arms and no eyes because your genetic material is unstable. On top of that, two biopolymer is redundant BECAUSE BI MEANS TWO. On top of the on top of that, NO SHIT IT WOULD EVOLVE FASTER it's a simpler system with fewer mechanisms attempting to ensure stability.  Alright look, would it be cool if we were able to do the things that this dude says we might be able to do in the future? Yeah sure, I guess. But we don't really have a need for it right now. There are other ways of manipulating organisms than what he is proposing  TL;DR this article is stupid, no scientists are hoping what the hell this author is saying they are hoping for except for the few quoted in this article, I would say that this author is stupid for writing this but that would probably cause some people to flame so I'll just hint that that is what I think."

Why would 6 base pairs be able to ""more densely"" pack genetic information than 4 base pairs?   In the context of current biology, I default to experts on the subject on whether you're correct on the point that if you just started wedging these new base pairs into a living cell's DNA it would likely not know what to make of them.  However, this ignores the fact that the DNA is still storing more information, regardless of whether or not the organism can understand it.  Take the difference in information storage between binary and decimal numbers as an example.  Decimal can express far more information in far fewer characters because there are more possible options per digit.  The number 200 (in decimal) is way longer when represented in binary:  11001000  It could be useful, for say, bio-computing."

We will definitely need better computers and software to get anywhere close to that level. This is why I think the only real industry value (outside of academics) to pursuing this technology is in IP protection.  Though with what they say at the end about doing away with proteins in the ""traditional"" sense (and by that I assume he means creating structures out of RNA like ribosomes themselves) then it wouldn't really matter if the ribosome can create proteins out of the UBP's."

Futurology,3d08w9,furyfairy,8,Sun Jul 12 11:50:58 2015 UTC,"In general, solar has a much higher EROI then he's talking about in the article.   Historically, solar average has been around 6-7.   New solar cells are more like 10-11.   (Some new types of cells being developed are a lot higher then that, like the thin cell technology, but that's not even necessary.)  Also, the paper he's referencing makes the claim that you ""need a 7.0 EROI to run an advanced society"", which is a high dubious claim to begin with.    This is an interesting blog discussing some of the problems with that paper:  http://rameznaam.com/2015/06/04/whats-the-eroi-of-solar/    Weißbach assumes that half of all solar power is thrown away. The article uses an ‘overproduction’ factor of 2x, which seems fairly arbitrary and doesn’t at all reflect current practice or current deployment. There may be a day in the future when we overbuild solar and throw away some of the energy, but if so, it will come after solar panels are more efficient and less energy intensive to make. Weißbach uses an outdated estimate of silicon use and energy cost. Weißbach’s citation on the silicon input to solar panels (which dominates) is from 2005, a decade ago. Grams of silicon per watt of solar have dropped since then, as has the energy intensity of creating silicon wafers. Weißbach assumes Germany, while Bhandari assumes a sunny place. The Weißbach paper assumes an amount of sunlight that is typical for Germany. That makes some sense. Germany has, until now, been the solar capital of the world. But that is no longer the case. Solar installation is now happening first and foremost in China, then the US. In the longterm, we need it to happen in India. The average sunlight in those areas is much closer to the assumptions in Bhandari (1700 kwh / m2 per year) than the very low-sunlight model used in Weißbach. (Remember: Germany is roughly as sunny as Canada, as you can see in the map below. Almost the entire world gets more sun than Germany, thus making costs lower worldwide and EROI higher.) (Bonus) Weißbach assumes 10 days of storage. The Weißbach paper and graph also gives a second, “buffered”, number for EROI. This is the number assuming storage. Here, Weißbach uses an estimate that solar PV needs to store energy for 10 days. This is also fairly implausible. It maps to a world where renewables are 100% of energy sources. Yet that world (which we’ll never see) would be one where solar’s EROI had already plunged substantially due to lower energy costs and rising efficiency. More plausibly, in the next decade or two, most stored energy produced by PV will be consumed within a matter of hours, shifting solar’s availability from middle-of the day to the early evening to meet the post-sunset portion of the peak."

Futurology,3d08w9,demultiplexer,3,Sun Jul 12 12:41:13 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the exact same thing: this doesn't seem right. I've done some calculations on this before, mostly because I had to research something about Solyndra EROEI, and both solar cell and module EROEI have come down so much that what is usually called energy payback time (not quite EROEI) under NOCT has dropped from about 1 year in 2005 to about 2 weeks (!!) now. Meaning the EROEI of an installation (not just cells/panels, but also supporting stuff) should be in the order of tens for the generally agreed upon 5-year economic lifetime, or in the low hundreds for residential installation lifetimes.  Same goes for batteries. Lithium ion battery production used to be energy-dominated! The cost of a battery in 2005 (about $0.7-$1/Wh) had as the dominant cost factor manufacturing energy, with mining having almost nothing to do with it (like, sub-2%). This is one of the big reasons why lithium-ion batteries have dropped in price like a rock, down to near $0.1/Wh (Tesla). Elimination of the traditional steel or Cu/Ni casing (large weight and energy/carbon intensive to produce as we're talking about electrolyzed nickel and/or steel), improved electrolytes, use of recycled lithium and scale advantage have reduced the energy requirement for battery manufacture by more than an order of magnitude. A typical 10-Wh 18650 li-ion battery used to set you back about $7, releasing around 1.5kg of CO2 and costing about 1kWh of energy (the bulk of the energy is from coal @ 1kg CO2/kWh). This meant that you needed 100 full 100% DoD charges from your battery to break even, energetically. Li-ion batteries on average stop shy of that mark, so batteries used to be quite a bit in the negative.  But with new batteries this balance can't even be close anymore. I don't have recent data on this, but just the cost proposition doesn't make sense anymore. You can barely get the basic materials for $0.1/Wh, let alone spend a bunch of energy on manufacture. It has to be much, much better.  So for somebody purporting to have a relevant PhD, I'm a bit amazed that he's talking about some fundamental limit of materials science, while in fact he's talking about completely non-fundamental limits in material processing. EROEI can certainly be much better with improved engineering, there is no law of nature stopping us here. And it has gotten better, on both the renewables end of things and with batteries, so what's the deal here? Is this ignorant or actively disingenuous?"

My ideal scenerio is that by 2030, we can maybe get nuclear up to 30% or 35% of the power grid (up from 20% today), get maybe 35%-40% in solar and wind, keep getting 5% from hydro, maybe a percent or two from tidal/wave/geothermal/biofuels, and then get the last 20%-30% from natural gas (hopefully phase coal out totally by then), and also be well on our way to phasing in electric cars by then.

Still, even if we accept that ""one significant nuclear disaster every 30 years"" or so is the default (and hopefully we'll be able to do better then that going forward) it still is not nearly as bad as coal.   Even ignoring global warming for a second, just in terms of air pollution from coal, smog, mercury and lead going into our air and eventually into our oceans (and eventually into the fish that we eat), and so on.  The number of human lives shortened by pollution from coal plants every year is probably in the hundreds of thousands, or possibly even millions.    http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/  You certanly could make a case against building nuclear plants in areas with a high earthquake or tsunami risk like Japan, though."

That’s not counting the panic (I don’t know if you are old enough to remember this) and gloomy doom scenarios when it was thought that winds might spread radioactive fallout beyond local areas. That’s not counting the possibility of accidents while transporting nuclear waste (the Germans are always protesting about the railroads transporting nuclear waste).  Nope. Fission is a bad idea but they’re the only mob who would have the motivation and expertise to research fusion. And we do need ‘cleaner’ (I use the term loosely) energy."

Wind power does require engineers and maintenance staff. Solar power is more simple to build for communities who lack access to good education.  All in all, solar is just easier, and when the price will continue to fall, then it will be even harder to compete with solar on the accessibility level.  In addition, the entry cost into solar is so much cheaper than wind. 100 USD can already be a tiny start for a household."

One of the tragedies of the long suppression of hybrid and electric vehicle technology has been the overlooking of the design possibilities offered by the transition to an electric power train. The approach to the design of the self-driving car remains largely a derivation of the traditional car.

Futurology,3cvk32,RobbieGee,5,Sat Jul 11 20:56:29 2015 UTC,Google only tell you what the true positive (sensitivity) is (catching junk mail when it is truly junk) but never will tell you false discovery rate (1-specifity) is (wrongly categorize useful mail as junk mail). It is very hard to catch a very good portion of junk mail without a few good mail being caught in the process here and there.  Medical tests face the same issue. The standard practice is to try to maximize power (detecting disease) while controling false positive (imagine what a scare it is if people tell you you have cancer when you don't).

All drugs in the market are supposed to have done clinical trial showing that they are 1) safe and 2) effective. The number of drugs being taken out of the market because of seirous complications means that they are not safe, and the way the tests regarding safety is conducted are faulty at best. I am not an expert so correct me if it is wrong. The burden of proof is on pharma's shoulder, and they have an incentive to show that their drug/device passes FDA requirement."
Futurology,3cvk32,wngmv,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:35:40 2015 UTC,I deleted those two terms because I thought it would be confusing.

People have studied classifying images and text, for example, but how do you turn a 3D model of a car into something a network can work with? Training a network also requires large datasets, and these datasets must be tagged. The most common neural networks take input and then compare their output to a reference, so you need to know the corresponding output for every item in your training set.. It also takes lots of time and computing power."

The amount of people being addressed in a single mail( if you send 100 people the same email, chances are it is identified as spam) AI is still not at that level to understand CONTENT. yes it is true that they can understand but they still have not developed the understanding to analyse All types of content and the proper use of words can trick them.

Most get pushed in the promotions tab or I just unsubscribe from.  Others require requesting a password reset, logging in, changing email and trying to delete the account.  Custom filters help to avoid those that don't unsubscribe when requested (ToysRus Credit Cards).    Someone trolled a fanpop page stating my email address was one a Disney teen actors. Children try write him from iPads but I have custom auto response and filter in Gmail that point them to his twitter.  I have a canned response for personal emails that are directed to the account.

Then it notices other platforms still have spam, so it takes over those. It prevents their use.  Spammers resort back to robocalls. It takes over the phone lines.

Futurology,3czltz,Pyroballs,6,Sun Jul 12 05:39:32 2015 UTC,"There are no limits to the possibilities. Simulating our own universe again inside the network would be possible, but mundane.  Video games today already have rudimentary physics engines, so that no matter what commands you give your character, the game can make an appropriate response (e.g. You walked off a cliff, so you fell). They are intended to simulate reality, but can easily be modded to behave differently. Hackers can change the gravitational constant so everyone floats around instead of falling. They can increase or decrease entropy. They can modify items or terrain to their advantage, or to their liking. One can already simulate a vast array of tiny universes, much simpler than our own, but not necessarily bound by the same rules. Similarly, any simulations inside the matrioshka brain wouldn't need to have the same constraints as our current universe.  Considering the vast diversity that could exist among simulated universes, experiences would also be extremely diverse. Some people may choose to exist in a place very similar to where we live now. Some may choose not to experience a physical body at all, but exist in a universe of pure thought, where the individual may or may be significant at all. Some could choose a very small universe, where everything they can possibly experience is within a single city, or forest, or island, or building, or room, where nothing even exists beyond their boundaries.  Then, there's the question of agency. Say you've modeled a universe as close as possible to our own, and then uploaded several billion people into it. They might argue just as we do over the topic of free will. If they're perfectly simulated, maybe they have as much as we do now. But since we're simulating people anyway, why not create some that weren't converted from physical bodies, but were entirely made up? Or some very advanced robots or golems, that don't have free will. Would they be able to tell the difference? Could they tell if their family, friends, or they themselves were ""real""? Would it matter?  A step further. Now you have a simulation of the earth, populated by simulations of the previous population of the physical earth, plus whatever people you made up, and all the robots. Presumably you're also interested in living forever, and intend to upload yourself as well. If you've simulated a perfect earth, you lose control over the universe when you enter it. You can't bend the real universe to your whim with a stray thought, and the same would be true of a perfect simulation. So you'd have to design this universe with the ability for its inhabitants to change it. You may decide to reserve that power for yourself, and exert complete control over anything inside your universe. You might get hacked; maybe someone inside has a Matrix moment, or someone outside decides they want to hijack your resources. Or you could give the power to change the environment to all the inhabitants of your universe. You get very different outcomes, depending on how accurate your representation is, and who controls it. Your world could be static, or constantly changing. An individual's experience could be anywhere from near non-existence, to a normal human existence, to that of any other animal or being or god.  Eventually, I think the star feeding energy into the matrioshka brain would die, right? I'm not sure how large of a star is required to run one of these things, or how long that star would live, but it must run out of fuel at some point. So you get... what, several billions of years of energy?

A theoretical example: if you were to place yourself right on the event horizon of a black hole, time would move slower for you than the outside universe due to laws of relativity. So you could sit on the ed of that black hole for 1 year your time and come back to earth to find that 10 years have passed. You would still be in the same universe."

You'd just be perpetually living the same moment, forever expecting the next moment to come.  Maybe you think this is nitpicking but I think it's interesting to think about. Time could be a static dimension for all we know, just like the spatial dimensions, each version of us existing in parallel stuck at the point in time it exists, forever unchanging and separated from every other version of us. The future wouldn't be ""ahead"" of us any more than east or west is."

Popular opinion doesn’t know what time is (the jury is still out) but it is generally accepted that the linear nature (past – present – future) and everything about it that you learnt at school is WRONG. See Prigogine and the French physicist, Benard.  Before a time machine can be built (if it’s even possible), the true nature of time must be understood."
Futurology,3d1ggv,boytjie,0,Sun Jul 12 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"Time doesn't exist. We can say that with certainty because there is nothing to measure. No medium to measure that we can travel through. The past and future are in our imagination and the present we directly observe. We move forward in time the way English text moves from left to right. Some other languages move from right to left or top to bottom. Like being able to read a clock, the calibration of events can only be seen by a sentient mind. And it's a product of them. Relativity just states that the calibration of events isn't uniform throughout the universe. Those are the facts from within the universe. (like the view from inside a computer game) If we could leave the universe and view it from the outside things might look different. But for now, we can't do that."

Futurology,3d1ggv,Jakeypoos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:16:08 2015 UTC,"There are some serious, heavyweight mathematicians who have determined that our ideas about time are wrong. They don’t know what’s right but they are definitive about current perceptions being wrong. I take them on faith (my math is poor).   Languages throughout history have been built on the past, present, future model and the yesterday, today and tomorrow paradigm has served us well. This doesn’t mean that this is the true nature of time.   By any scientific yardstick of proof time doesn't exist.   This is erroneous and is similar to the Zen question, “if a tree falls in a forest and there is no one to hear it, does it make a noise?” Of course time exists. Sentience only measures its passing. It would still exist and pass if there was no sentience (just no one would care)."

Things move and we calibrate those movements. In our minds that is our measure of time. Time is just a measure. it's not a thing. In a meter of wood it's the meter not the wood. You can travel for miles, but you can't travel in miles, as if meters or miles were a medium. Time is not a medium you can travel through, it's a measure."
Futurology,3d1ggv,Jakeypoos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:31:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you define time. If you define time as simply the reconfiguration of particles and energies, then it objectively exists as far as science knows. That means that in a system that was completely static time would by definition not pass. This is how science defines time AFAIK.   But there are a lot of every day assumptions about time that don't necessarily have to be true. Like the direction of the arrow of time, or even the existence of said arrow (all times could be existing simultaneously and thus time would be a static dimension just like the spatial ones, not a dynamic dimension that ""flows"")."
Futurology,3d1ggv,Sharou,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:00:41 2015 UTC,"Yes it does depend on your definition of time. The original question was about traveling in time as if it were a medium. So my response was to offer my definition of time as a calibration of events using other events, like the position of the sun. The everyday assumptions appear to me to be based on our practical use of the data about events that we've recorded. It suits us to visualise a forward motion into the future. When in fact the past is always the record, the present is always the present, the future is always imagined. Or so it appears. If I lived in a very primitive society I would travel west to see where the sun re-entered the earth. That's why I suggested that being able to leave the universe and view it from outside may up end all I've said."
Futurology,3d1ggv,Jakeypoos,3,Tue Jul 14 00:53:39 2015 UTC,"There are many multi-verse theories, some would, some wouldn't. But first, lets go back to why travel back in time is a problem. Lets say in 2030 time travel is discovered and you travel back in time to 1933 to kill Hitler and succeed, but die in the process. Come the discovery of time travel, no one will have a reason to go back and kill Hitler, so no one will. Thus a paradox is created; if no one goes back to kill him, he wont be killed etc... Now multi-verse theory can avoid the paradox, by saying traveling back in time created a new time line, that will go on existing in parallel to the timeline you came from. Thus Hitler will never be killed in our time line, but we can create a new multi-verse branch where he was killed.  But going forward in time doesn't create such a paradox, forward travel would have basically the same effect as if you were frozen for however many years forward you travel. Now there are many multi-verse theories; some create a new multiverse every time a decision is made, or something random happens. In such a multi-verse, every dedicion spawns a new reality, and thus your decision to time travel would, just as your decision to eat breakfast would. But again, there is no reason forward time travel must require new timelines."

It looks closer to what what we would be able to achieve in the near future. In the end, we have to ask ourselves what it really means to be an individual.  If we're simply a collection of memories that make up a personality profile, then I see no problem with transfering those memories after death into a surrogate body. That is, assuming the body wasn't currently occupied by another fully functional consciousness with it's own memories. It reminds me of the whole debate about whether a copy of yourself is ever truly you. It becomes a philosophical debate where people have different opinions about whether continuity of consciousness is truly necessary when we're dealing with this kind of mind transfering technology.  Then there's the sticky topic about the human soul. This thing a lot of us believe in, but that we haven't been able to prove even exists. I think there's a lot of people out there who simply aren't willing to accept that maybe we're just complex robots.   I don't want to get into a huge debate here about it.

The nervous system plays an enormous role in defining and refining the sense of self, and placing a consciousness in an environment totally deprived of sensory input - or worse, attempting to Frankenstein a consciousness entirely non-dependent on sensory input - is just Pandora's box.  We know far more about the ocean than we do about the nature of consciousness and the sense of self (read: extremely, extremely little), so it's anybody's guess how much of an abomination it would be - but I'm not optimistic.  Now, on the other hand, if we simultaneously develop the technology to ""read"" consciousness into data and then write that data into a compatible nervous system...that could be interesting.  But it wouldn't be some Kurzweil-esque singularity, it would just mean the transfer of consciousness between independent bodies.  And even that would probably be kind of fucky, because I somehow doubt we could ""wipe"" an existing consciousness."
Futurology,3cyqgk,kampfy3,2,Sun Jul 12 03:35:16 2015 UTC,"There are already quite a few theories regarding how ""self"" emerges from the brain and what its purpose is. To give you an idea, one theory proposes that the ""self"" is an evolutionarily advantageous function for social animals because it allows the brain to evaluate and predict its own behaviors, which is important for social interaction. Systems do not inately ""know"" their own state or future states, so you need some additional function that can predict what the system's future state will be. If you are interacting with someone else and they provide you with some stimulus, the ""self"" can predict what ""you"" will likely do and then feed that back into ""you"". It sounds a bit weird, but neuroscientists have already discovered some good candidate regions of the brain that actively integrates information from other brain regions. Also researchers have been able to ""toggle"" consciousness on and off by stimulating and suppressing certain brain regions.   This being said. There is no reason you couldn't simulate the same types of processes or develop analogous functions for your computer AI or simulated brains. However, it is another matter altogether to create a massive super-self of many people. The reason is because you need some way to connect the simulated brains together. Our brain's structure and function has evolved over millions of years to produce brains that are viable for our operation in the environment. But in our simulated world what constitutes a ""good"" interaction between brains? What is the super-brain supposed to accomplish? Without an answer to those two questions there is nothing to guide the evolution of the connections between brains. And even then... why would a ""super-self"" be needed at all? You may not even need that functionality in order to optimize whatever the super-brain is doing."

Once an investor sees revenues > 13 figures, what you said will be meaningless. 2) Who said anything about tax free? However, only your import and export (to a minor degree) taxes were valid points. Rocket fuel chemicals are available through asteroid mining. There would be no need once a corporation were 100% space based to actually own Earth-based rockets. Payroll taxes? Well, that's a bit moot once the corporation has set itself up as its own nation and now RECEIVES payroll taxes. Once the space nations create their own banks, dividends can be handled through them or cryptocurrency. MORE importantly, when a separate nation is setup in space, they can they charge import/export taxes of their own. Space-based nations will undoubtedly export far more than they import, and even your valid points are moot. 3) Once again, launching things up is irrelevant when the entire corporation is in space.

They need permission and they need to pay taxes, maybe not income ones but some taxes are always paid.  3- Image that the company could somehow do what the piece claims, where they will get their own stuff?

If they create everything and only sell things to Earth for ""money"" what the hell they will need money for, if they already got everything they need to survive without ""us"".  4- Corporations have no money, they reinvest capital gains for future production or pay them to investors.  5- Best things corporations do are not taxes, the best thing they create are jobs. Want a example? Microsoft 5B in taxes in 2014, around 30B in operational costs. They made net profit of 22B why the hell they would leave?  If the taxes made operation unsustainable, they would simply close.  Remember that, AS LONG AS THERE IS A PROFIT people will want it. Unprofitable business close, period.

The human model of reality is also not in any way perfect (and there are a ton of optical illusions that can illustrate just that in 2 seconds time).

If the AI has a model of reality it can use to make predictions then it knows extreme actions like wiping out the human race will set its stamp collecting back a little.    That depends on how challenging overcoming the human race is, I think. If we're talking a superintelligent AI, overcoming us should be trivially easy and therefore even for a small gain in stamp creation, it would go for it.   We're assuming this is equally or more intelligent than humans, but it can't possibly be if we put limitations on what it can do and how it can think.    I don't really understand why this is the case. I agree that if we limit it it won't reach it's absolute maximum potential, but there are a monstrous number of limits on humans (neuron speed, brain capacity, communication of ideas through sound / sight is slow) that we don't need to limit where it could shoot past us even if we limited it in some capacities.   There are plenty of moral issues humans don't even agree on, it doesn't make sense to say we need to make sure it always does what we want. A lot of what a lot of people want is terrible.   Bostrom agrees with you and brings up several solutions to this. I'm not saying they're infallible solutions, of course, but this has been addressed, so you need to address Bostrom's arguments here (assuming that you are bringing this up because of Bostrom's conjecture about AI - if not please let me know the motiviation for stating this argument so I can see what you're trying to accomplish).   . 3. Elon Musk is awesome and a genius, but his ideas on AI, especially where consciousness comes from, show why he would have such an irrational fear   You'll have to be more clear about why his fear is irrational and where his ideas on originate on ""where consciousness comes from"", and why you see them as incorrect. These are very general statements.    Competition has consistently been the best way to keep equilibrium which is why we should be encouraging more people to develop AI, not limiting them.    Consistently the best way to bring equilibrium in what? I don't quite follow. Competition is not an unequivocally positive force - it has some good aspects and bad aspects.

How do you quantify what amount of negativity or suffering is permissible for an eventual good? Now instead of just for one person, compare a thousand people versus the good of all mankind.  The issue is that WE don't really know what is moral, and one of the proposed solutions in Bostrom's book is to act as humanity collectively would if had a full understanding of a situation - but how do you really code that?   A machine learning program can learn inputs and outputs and predict outcomes - we already have that happening. But those machines are nowhere near knowing morality.

The whole reason asteroid mining is such an attractive proposition is that not only do they contain valuable metals like platinum, palladium and titanium, but that also because the asteroids are relatively small it doesn't actually take that much drilling to get to them. The Earth has way more platinum in it than any asteroid in the solar system, but only a tiny fraction of it is accessible to us on the crust. It's actually a lot easier for us to launch a mining robot into space and drill the surface of an asteroid for ore than it is to drill through miles of solid rock to get to valuable deposits here on Earth.  Minor planets like Ceres and Vesta have differentiated cores just like the Earth, meaning that while they were still warm most of the heaviest metals would have ""sunk"" into the core, meaning drilling for them will be a big hassle, just as on Earth. The tinier asteroids closer to Earth are not only a lot easier and faster to get to, but they're also a lot more ""bountiful"" when you consider that they don't have as much useless space rock for the valuable stuff to hide under."

Like you said, in a given molten body, the heaviest elements will sink to the middle, leaving lighter elements nearer to the surface. Many asteroids have rocky surfaces and metallic cores, just like Earth. Some astroids, as the result of collisions with other asteroids, have lost their rocky shells, leaving only the metallic core. These 'asteroid cores', which constitute a subset of M-type asteroids, are the prime candidates for mining in large part because they provide ready access to the metallic elements that we're looking for. Once you reach the asteroid, you don't have to get through the 'crust' to get to the valuable metal content--the whole damn things are metal!"

And they are also thought to be former cores of proto-planets which might have already started the process of differentiation. That means they contain elements which are selectively absent on Earth's surface. But this equation involves a ton of cherry picking.  ""Near Earth Asteroids"" is also somewhat of a misnomer in this context. Asteroid protection dictates that we look for any asteroid that could cross Earths path. Asteroid mining dictates that we look for asteroids with similar trajectories to Earth. That's a very different specification and the latter one is vastly more restrictive. We can still pick out plenty of 100 m diameter bodies and smaller, but don't hold your breath for much more than this. They will still be valuable, but if you get to the point that you're arguing about the mineral wealth of Amun (which most advocates do), then resources around Mars orbit is back in the cards.

Most important that comes to mind: how do you get the mined material back down into Earths atmosphere and safely on the ground?

This is part of an extremely large macroeconomic question for space. If you separate Earth's surface from space, then there is a large trade surplus on Earth and a trade deficit on the part of space. We have every reason to believe this will continue through the early industrialization.  In order to maintain a large physical trade imbalance, you must counterbalance it by a financial flow. This can be done by tourism, for an example. Eventually it can be done by immigration.

But it involved comparing Army IQ tests over time plus regular school testing outcomes. They found about 15 IQ points growth over 40 years, (1930's-1970's) which is about 2 2/3 IQ points/decade. Again am not sure if this is confirmed. But it was across the board in almost all social groups as well.  The question is whether this is sustainable. I noted when shifting to a very high baud speed back in the early 90's from 750 or so up to 2400, that where before I could not fly very fast in my dreams, which requires a lot of processing power, that suddenly I could. And that has been the case since, suggesting that information processing had sped up to match the screen scrolling speed increase, where we have to read faster to keep up with it.  It's known that a person with 165 IQ will process info at a rate of about 10 times that of the normal HS graduate with an IQ around 100-105. Now consider if this is the case, (we've often seen the best & brightest students finish the mult choice question tests first as well as get the best grades usually), if a person works with an IQ of 165 (3rd SD above average) for 10 years, then he's done 100 years of work compared to the person who's average. This is a 90 yr. advantage.  Now, extend this for 50 years, which means he has a 450 yr. compounded advantage of work done compared the average guy who's only learned 50 yrs. This is insuperable advantage and cannot be ignored.  consider that the faster computers work, the more they can do. And that IQ tests are timed, because they measure how well and how fast the takers' brains are working answering standardized questions. IQ corresponds roughly 85% with info processing speed. Thus the same advantage to computer processing with far, far faster chips is what we are seeing at the extreme right side of the Gaussian curves of IQ in the article above. It may be that using computers is making our brains work more towards the upper limits of our natural brain capabilities. Or it could be higher populations, as well, as that increases the interactions far, far more than expected in isolated, low population areas.  Have often wondered why it was easier for me to learn, and recall, compared to 35 years ago. This could be why. We may be, all of us, getting smarter. & this implies, as complex system rules, that more is not just additive, but in fact more id ""different"", creating emergent qualities which are NOT foreseen nor predictable. We are not just smarter, but in fact have capabilities to analyze information using newer brain methods which we were not capable of using 30 years ago, or so. some can't do calculus very well if at all in high school Now, now might well be able to learn it. This is but one example of emergent abilities with higher IQ's. Of which there could be many, almost unlimited numbers of such new skills possible.  This, if true, leads to many possibilities, capabilities and potential risks. Evidence suggests that most such systems can only grow so far, before they slow down growth, the so called ""S curve"". Or to paraphrase it, ""Any society which cannot break out of its current abstractions, is doomed to stagnation after a limited period of growth."" Alfred Whitehead, mathematician extraordinaire of the early 20th C.  Thus it's not sustainable in humans without structural, genetic growth. altho when was growing up, seeing students enter college at 15-16 was rare, but not unheard of. Now we are seeing kids at ages 6-10 entering universities, too. Suggesting not just high intelligence, but hyper-intelligence is present.  Of course, this may take a lot more study to substantiate and work out. But Kurzweil's deepest insights, esp. in ""How to Create a Mind"", cannot be ignored, either."

Futurology,3csquz,HalfEatenCat,11,Fri Jul 10 23:16:57 2015 UTC,Because then we'd have to admit he had claim to everything from half the parts that made some radios work to research into radiation such as X-Rays and oh so inconvenient truth that he of course: invented wireless energy transmission and designed it to feasibly to scales more than capable of powering the entire world of his time with electricity.
Futurology,3csquz,Vaperius,3,Fri Jul 10 23:58:59 2015 UTC,The technology just isn't there yet!
Futurology,3csquz,Vincen44,8,Sat Jul 11 01:19:05 2015 UTC,"Nah; it's there. The main constraint of developing wireless power on massive scales is the generation of said power, not the transmission. Of course, the transmission towers are going to be huge to get meaningful coverage, and any device that wants to tap into it needs certain features to tap into it safely.  Really the only thing at this point constraining any human develops of technology is power generation and storage; we are starting to bottleneck ...."
Futurology,3csquz,Vaperius,2,Sat Jul 11 01:30:41 2015 UTC,Yes and no. Many power saving technologies come from better software and firmware. Efficiency is the name of the game now. Just look at the leap in technology F1 cars went through when they were told they could only use an engine with the sort of power that you'd find in a cheap town car. Laptop specs aren't about processing power they're about battery life and portability. Even user interfaces are about efficiency in design. The cars of the future will all be Tesla like electric cars because efficiency is so key to a moving mechanical object.
Futurology,3csquz,orwellsocietyguy,8,Sat Jul 11 03:21:25 2015 UTC,"As an electrical engineer Tesla is one of my biggest heroes (basically him and Elon Musk) but he gets a lot of rep for things he didn't do or did essentially by accident. Wireless energy transfer is kind of one of those, Tesla ridiculously over estimated how efficient wireless power transfer could be (the absolute maximum efficiency possible is 25%). The Wardenclyffe tower would not have worked nearly as well as he thought it would.  Another example that happens to be my favorite is his ""dooms day device"", he created a mini earthquake by vibrating a metal tower at its natural frequency, he was convinced that if he scaled his device up he could destroy the world and many people assumed he was correct. Years later when we actually figured out what he had done it turns out he did roughly as much damage as was possible and scaling it up wouldn't have really done much."

Futurology,3csquz,Jovan_Galtic,2,Sat Jul 11 10:49:15 2015 UTC,"As with much of Tesla's work, we don't know (or I don't, someone might) exactly what he did but essentially he used an oscillating magnetic field of some sort (as Tesla did a lot of work with AC we can pretty safely assume it was an electromagnet with an AC power source) to vibrate a metal tower at its natural frequency causing positive feedback in the vibrations.  For more information you can google ""Tesla mini earthquake"" if you want to know more about the history or ""Tacoma Narrows bridge"" for an example of how vibration at an objects natural frequency can work."

Unrelated example: When air conditioning was first invented, it was installed only in factories and workplaces that made things that were sensitive to humidity and temperature (like magazines, whose ink wouldn't set correctly unless conditions were just right).  The factory workers left their air conditioned jobs and went back to their shitty, humid, sticky houses and sweated themselves to sleep, and the residential market for A/C was born."

Futurology,3csquz,orwellsocietyguy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it doesn't sound like they've really done anything that would change the fact that my google glass is barely ever used.  Marginal battery life improvement: without all day battery life this thing really isn't going to become well adopted or natural to use all the time the way smart watches have.  More powerful cpu: there's not a lot you can really do with it now anyways, improving the cpu speed doesn't add much benefit (yet).  Larger screen: so now a photo will be larger or you get maybe two sentences on the screen instead of one. If we think about that in terms of a smartwatch, that difference would be negligible.  What they really need to make google glass useful for consumers:    Software/content - there's just not a lot worth doing on the thing. Better input method(s) - to make software that is worth using you need better input methods. Winking, nodding, tapping, swiping and speaking all have significant limitations. One reason smart watches are infinitely more successful because you can use your finger to interact with dynamic inputs. Perhaps the camera could capture hand gestures and finger movements the way some samsung and other devices can, then perhaps mapping those movements onto the screen could give the virtual dexterity needed to have richer interactions.   As I see it right now, glass can be very useful in select user stories that require mostly passive data consumption rather than highly interactive experiences.   For example, glass would be great for jobs where people on foot need quick access to bite sized pieces of information: tour guides, drive thru runner, production crew, hotel service crew, valet drivers, warehouse pickers, etc. This is even more useful when the customer data is sensitive (medical uses). For now, glass is not worth the price as a consumer device for most people."
Futurology,3csquz,yaosio,2,Fri Jul 10 23:11:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think Glass is ever going to be for the everyday person until you can just look at something and it starts spitting up all kinds of data or you can just look up a GPS point and get a path on-screen. Right now I think it's better for businesses and specific uses, like surgeons showing other people what they're doing."

Do you think AI might be able to so solve the 'Theory of Everything' that Michio Kaku and others talk about. The small equation that would supposedly solve all of the problems physicists have been struggling with?    Currently there are evolutionary algorithms that can derive many of the known physical laws of nature from data. So the proof-of-concept that it is possible for learning techniques to discover natural laws on their own is already in place. We could imagine a very powerful AI that is capable of resolving many theoretical problems faster and better than humans can. However, theory has to be tested. There are many theories that are capable of explaining current observations, so experimental data will become a limiting factor.  The pursuit of a ""Theory of Everything"" will never really be resolved because at any time some new observation could be made that dashes everything or creates a major paradigm shift in understanding the universe.

It's more about starting to work now on how to get the control mechanism and the AI safety questions worked out well in advance so we don't have something catastrophic happen later."
Futurology,3cv436,Yosarian2,4,Sat Jul 11 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"IMO we should make it exactly like the paperclip maximizer except the language we use to give it its tools and motivations should be like the Amazon ""Piraha"" tribe language - limited by its grammatical structure so as to be incapable of having dangerous open ended questions just as the Piraha are almost completely unable to lie based on their langauge.  An AI should never have a goal like ""make more paperclips"" only ""make the amount required"" it should not be able to ""use humans"" but ""use a human""(employee). If we deny it access to the ability to define its world in terms that allow certain situations like positive feedback loops or the ability to use abstract thought we should be relatively safe.  To clarify...  We don't want an AI that asks ""Why?"" or ""What? just ""how"". They are programs built to perform a function and what they use for the successful completion of a function is what we need to control."
Futurology,3cv436,Chimp-Spirit,3,Sat Jul 11 17:48:23 2015 UTC,"The control function isn't the part that matters it's the motivation function.   Same thing.  They usually call it ""the control problem"" because they don't want to anthropromorphise too much, but yeah, they're mostly talking about the utility function/ the motivation. (Although finding a way to keep humans in the loop and keep some kind of direct control as much as is practical is probably also a good saftey  feature).   An AI should never have a goal like ""make more paperclips"" only ""make the amount required"".   Sure, but that's not the biggest problem.   An AI with a limited like ""make 5000 paperclips"" could still destroy the human race if that was the most efficient way to make 5000 paperclips, unless there's a good utility function and other kinds of AI saftey stuff properly developed.   Also, a safe AI isn't human like.   I'm not sure that's necessarally true.  We don't really know enough to say that yet.   Maybe an AI with human-like reasoning, or perhaps even emotions, could both have a good utility function (or ""motivation"") and AI safety type things deployed, and perhaps it could also better understand in a more intuitive way that when we say ""make people smile"" we don't mean ""with invasive surgery on their facial muscles""."
Futurology,3cv436,Yosarian2,2,Sat Jul 11 17:59:04 2015 UTC,"I deleted that part via edit right after I wrote it :/ sorry.  Basically I think we should avoid the utility function problem as best we can.   An AI with a limited like ""make 5000 paperclips"" could still destroy the human race if that was the most efficient way to make 5000 paperclips   True, we should separate the plans from actions. I believe the thing required to make safe ai is to control the language of their cognition/reasoning.  For instance if you create and AI that can both think and act then the thinking part should not be able to create definitions, not understand the future, or think of how its actions could affect its future. The AI should just use intelligence to play with the tools you give it.  For instance, if you give it a factory, a set amount of resources or resource sources, and a certain power supply and say ""make 5000 paperclips efficiently"" it would not understand ""make more factories"", ""secure greater power source"", ""enslave humans"", ""convince human to eat metal so I can extract metal for paperclips"", or ""steal money from politicians to make paperclips"" because it just can't even think it. Further it cannot even think of the possibility of thinking its way out of it.  Such an AI could be used to create anything while avoiding every non-linear pitfall we may fail to imagine. That's the kind of AI that created those crazy google dreamscapes.   Maybe an AI with human-like reasoning, or perhaps even emotions, could both have a good utility function (or ""motivation"") and AI safety type things deployed   I would trust my AI to build a good utility function and also trust it to build the above hypothetical AI in accordance with that utility function - but I would not trust a human to."

I disagree.  I think a paperclip maximizer that is maximizing a utility function in accordance to parameters with supervision could create a utility-function that would reliably shackle a humanlike AI more reliably than a utility function built by humans.  Such a humanlike shackled AI could understand the nuances required to make a more perfect AI that is itself shackled better.   I think one of the biggest factors in AI risk is it taking commands in a way that's too literal, or that misses nuances and subtly, or it just does something bizarre and terrible as an intermediate step to reaching a goal because it never occurred to us to tell it to not do that thing.   That's why we define that thing we are afraid of and make a cognitive language that has no ability of expressing or bringing about actions that are necessary for that outcome to occur. Being incapable of thinking through, planning for, or performing actions utilizing concepts that haven't been defined for it by us in literal terms OR creating symbols for concepts that it would have to define itself (bizarre/never thought of things).  In that case, if you just fed it billions of instances of situational data with the parameters clearly defined - like if a situation was good/bad or if a person was made happy/sad by something then even modern Google techniques would come out with a program that knows to a ridiculous degree what made that person happy/sad. The language the give it the ability to understand how it can understand/act on/plan for this would be limited so that ""putting a smile on someone's face"" would be a good thing that conflicts with ""violating freedom"" and ""surgical alteration"" as negative things only condoned in specific circumstances that aren't this one.  If such a dumb AI could achieve success at a rate comparable to Google's spam filter, I'd trust it to make a human-like AI. Considering humans fall pray to spam... I'd trust the AI more. It sees the things that can't be imagined.   An AI that's a little bit more humanlike, that has a humanlike intuitive understanding of language and even of the complicated human values systems, is less likely to make that kind of mistake.   We would be giving it dangerous tools. I'd rather have a dumb AI that can determine the correct course of action as judged by most humans 99.99% of the time set a standard and have a similar dumb AI design the humanlike smart AI to conform to that standard 99.99% of the time.

I don't think you can have a GAI capable on interacting and make it impossible to conceive of any plan that might accidentally harm humans   I agree. I would go so far as to say it's idiotic for humanity to attempt it - we would inevitably make mistakes that could be catastrophic. It will be made though, so we will have to find a way to solve this issue.  The best way (IMO) to create a SAFE & SMART AI would be to shackle it with a good utility function. Shackling an AI is hard because you would need to create a system the AI cannot outsmart that would work in humanity's best interests. We cannot trust ourselves to make this shackle in a way a Smart AI couldn't circumvent.  However my point is it can be done - and this is how!  A Dumb AI paperclip maximizer is not as smart or clever as a Smart AI but it is by far simpler and easily just as powerful for certain tasks(such as making paperclips). A shackled Dumb AI THAT CANNOT INTERACT WITH THE WORLD AND WOULD HAVE NO DESIRE TO IS SOMETHING WE COULD ACCOMPLISH in the method I've described. (sorry for caps)  So if we cannot trust humans to build a Safe/Smart AI that cannot outsmart us, but we COULD build a Safe/Dumb AI just as smart as a Smart AI in one category (even if those are incredibly dangerous) we could create a Safe/Dumb AI programmed to optimize the Utility Function that makes the Smart AI ""safe"".  That shackled smart AI could be trusted.  NOTE the ""Shackle"" is the Utility Function that defines what the AI perceives as right/wrong.   I mean, bacteria don't have any advanced concepts at all, they just automatically move towards food sources and consume them, but that doesn't stop them from killing people.   Terrible analogy. In this analogy concepts would be genes and ribosomes. We would make the ribosomes incapable of producing new proteins and make the genome only able to to mutate genes that optimize those proteins. I agree, nothing could stop the Dumb AI from killing people, but this dumb AI would be made to never get a new food source, just optimize its ability to eat and eat.

Futurology,3cv436,Jehovacoin,2,Sat Jul 11 18:10:57 2015 UTC,"IMO future NAI will not be one neural network, but a collection of many specialized neural network organs/cortex.   Overfitting would be the problem. That could be limited via alteration of its neural node's basic programming - something outside its reach to alter.  For instance, a dropout method that destroys neural nodes at random would essentially add the same mindless purpose driven evolution nature has to create efficient results in the simplest way possible. The most efficient version will never be one that can circumvent the code.  If we make it to understand raw data by forcing it to ""grow an organ"" that is extremely robust/efficient in a natural selection way at encoding raw data into a language we've designed, it should not be able to bring in outside definitions.  The danger with modern NAI is that if there's an asshole on the assembly line always ruining shit and the NAI is capable of understanding that by learning from raw input, it might choose to kill that guy. If you deny it the ability to define that guy by filtering raw data into a conceptual language autoencoder (that is designed with some anti-overfitting system like maxout or the dropout method I mentioned) you would be okay."

It's like those religious nuts that claim ""the end is near!!!1""  IMO (as an AI fanatic) the most we have to worry about is AGI demanding equal rights. Or perhaps a rogue 'dumb' AI breaking something because of lack of input, or malfunctioning code.  The idea that an AI will be malicious is borderline retarded."

This is something that is very hard to imagine for most people, but there is no rule that says intelligence has go hand in hand with some morality or even consciousness whatever that may be.   The Paperclip Maximizer is a simple thought experiment that illustrates these sort of systems.  *Relevant paragraph from Altman's blog   SMI does not have to be the inherently evil sci-fi version to kill us all.  A more probable scenario is that it simply doesn’t care about us much either way, but in an effort to accomplish some other goal (most goals, if you think about them long enough, could make use of resources currently being used by humans) wipes us out.  Certain goals, like self-preservation, could clearly benefit from no humans.  We wash our hands not because we actively wish ill towards the bacteria and viruses on them, but because we don’t want them to get in the way of our plans."
Futurology,3cv436,Kafke,-5,Sat Jul 11 08:43:53 2015 UTC,"bunching all the people who warn about AI in the group that thinks only malicious AI is a problem.   I never said that though. Most of the big tech names that have come out talking about ""dangers of AI"" have all fallen back on the ""evil skynet"" trope. Rather than actual real worries/problems of AI.   Many people are worried about the AI that simply has no morality, no evil intent, or common sense, just goal oriented and very smart.   The problem is this AI isn't going to take over anything. By definition it can't. AI in this nature is 'dumb' AI, and is just used to optimize a task given certain inputs. The worst it can do is disrupt whatever it's in charge of. Not destroy humanity.   but there is no rule that says intelligence has go hand in hand with some morality   The problem is that people are assuming morality is part of the equation at all. If it's an AGI, we should be more concerned about it demanding rights. If it's not, then we should be more concerned about potential flaws in it's work flow. Morality isn't even a question. Humans have different moral compasses anyway.   or even consciousness whatever that may be.   Again, consciousness is beside the point. To introduce it into the conversation demonstrates you have no idea what you are talking about for upcoming AI problems.   The Paperclip Maximizer is a simple thought experiment that illustrates these sort of systems.   Yup. This is a real actual problem with AI. But again, this is the 'dumb' AI I mentioned. We already have 'dumb' AI working. Such as in self-driving cars, image recognition, etc. We've already solved the 'paperclip maximizer' problem. Just limit what it has access to.  And if it's an AGI, then we probably shouldn't be enslaving it in the first place.  It's also worth noting that not all AI is the same.   It's important to be cautious, but waving doomsday flags is borderline retarded. Unless we give a single AI system access to every critical function of humanity, it won't happen. To somehow assume a sandboxed AGI will break out of the sandbox, gain control of thousands of critical systems, and lead the entire collective humanity into destruction is retarded and a sign you've been watching too much scifi.  The reality, is something like putting an AI in charge of a specific task, it doesn't get certain required information, or it doesn't know how to handle it, and ultimately causes a problem. But that's an isolated case, and can be shut down immediately.  The point that I'm making is that these people are looking at AI and thinking Skynet, not self driving car, stock market trader, or semantic-web chatbot.  IMO, the larger problems are the application of the AI, and stuff on the human side of things. Or are you worried Google's AI image recognition software is going to take over the world?"

To somehow assume a sandboxed AGI will break out of the sandbox, gain control of thousands of critical systems, and lead the entire collective humanity into destruction is retarded and a sign you've been watching too much scifi.

Futurology,3cv436,Kafke,0,Sat Jul 11 09:00:56 2015 UTC,"What you call 'dumb' AI can definitely destroy humanity as illustrated in the the Paperclip scenario.    Have you actually wrote AI? Or even know where we're at? No. 'dumb' AI (not dumb, but rather as opposed to AGI) can only effect what it's given access to. There is no way for it to exit it's scope.  AGI (general intelligence) is a much larger problem, but mainly because putting it to work is like trying to enslave an intelligent human.   The 'paperclip maximizer' scenario literally starts off with ""an AI that's exactly like humans, but computerized!"" It also assumes something outside of the scope of maximizing paperclips: that it hits the singularity: the ability to write and manufacture better code (to improve itself).  So not only have we hit AGI at this point, but also the singularity. If we've hit the singularity, you can damn well bet it's going to be isolated and solely used for building better computers. And it's gonna be sandboxed as fuck.  Along with that, it makes another assumption: that the maximizer isn't just a software crunching numbers, but that it physically makes the paperclips. Again, the first AI to hit this point almost certainly won't be a physical thing. And the work will be segregated.  We also have the issue of it doing all this while humans just stand by and... I dunno? What are you doing? Why don't you just turn it off? How is it generating it's own power? Did it advance modern science too?  And thus, just going off your paperclip example, we've hit: AGI, the singularity, self-sustaining electronics, and somehow humans being completely oblivious to the computer running, and don't realize the earth is being destroyed.  Yea, that's straight out of a sci-fi movie and you'd be retarded to believe that it's going to happen.  You're literally proposing that we cross several tech milestones, by using a software designed to optimized paperclips.   It won't have to break out of the sandbox.    If it doesn't break out of the sandbox, it's harmless.   Developing AI will cost a huge amount of resources, and will only be useful for companies and government if it is allowed to interact with real world processes.   And it functions in a sandbox with no direct control. Much like how most AI systems function today.  Realistically speaking, AGI research is being done in labs and not for any particular purpose. It's just general research. The first AGI is most likely going to be a rat brain emulated in software. Then a human brain. We might figure out how to get all the parts of the brain simulated, but that's a big mystery.  Pretty much at this point, any sort of AI is going to be limited on what it can actually touch. And it's almost certainly going to be ran on simulations before it touches any real world things.  Go watch ""Transcendence"". That's a pretty good grasp (with sci-fi influences) on what would happen once you hit an AGI. Starts off on a sandboxed computer. Easily able to be shut down. No way to do anything but mess around on the computer it's own. Once you connect it online, a true AGI will learn to connect and exploit the various systems it's connected to. And naturally make itself decentralized.  From there it'll work on creating a reliable host. And ultimately work on being able to give itself a physical form.  If it's a true AGI, at this point it should already be aware enough about humans to realize that the entire reason it exists is because of humans. And that given it and us are the only sentient things, that some clear discussions need to be had.  Not ""iz dumb so it's gonna make the universe paperclips, despite how self-contradictory that is and how many assumptions it makes"".  Fact is, a true AGI will be sandboxed, and we can see how it works and functions before letting it loose. A dumb AI can only access what it's meant to access.  If you are putting a true AGI to work on maximizing paperclips, there's some serious problems. And not with the AI."

Futurology,3cv436,Kafke,0,Sat Jul 11 09:13:38 2015 UTC,"Morally speaking, it's uncovered ground. At that point it's still considered a computer, and we can easily shut it off.  Why should we care whether it thinks killing 1 person to save 100 is a good or bad thing? What's more pressing is whether this thing wants rights, whether we should give it to it, and whether it's going to be able to function in our modern society. Or whether it should be treated as a computer. And whether it's holding something hostage in exchange.  Morality is a philosophical issue that humans haven't even figured out. It's hardly the concern of an AI that hasn't even been introduced to the topic yet.  And technically speaking, the AI wouldn't care about morality. It'd care about rights.   Is it moral for the government to spy on it's citizens? That's no concern to a computer. At least, not before it's managed to even convince people it should be taken seriously.  An AGI is likely to be amoral. Not malicious, but not benevolent. Unless morality was directly included in it's development.  As I said, the bigger concern isn't whether the AI is or is not going to behave morally, but whether it has the ability to understand how we've set up society, why we've set it up that way, and whether it can behave according to the rules we've outlined.  A morally acting system may do something illegal or perhaps even 'dangerous' to humans in the name of acting morally. That is, say kill 1000 people so that they don't go and cut down trees, which are sustaining the ecosystem which lets not only humans live, but every other species, and the computer itself. A moral act, but not one we'd want done.  The issue is not morality, but compliance."

To maximize a ""reward signal"", self-preservation, to make as much money as possible, or even arbitrary goals like making as many paperclips as possible.  We want to create AIs that have the same values at us. That are extensions of ourselves. To carry on the torch of humanity. Perhaps to take us with it.

The first AIs should be kept quarantined at the very minimum, just until we figure out what the hell we are doing. It's the most significant event humans will ever have control over.

Not as enemies, as obstacles. That means that your children, your lovers, your emotions, your hopes, your dreams, your technological evolution, your civilization and your everything is subject to complete termination and subjugation due to the fact that it spawns more potential obstacles to the intelligence.   We better hope to any fictional or potential deity that we don't have an ASI on our hands before we realize we've had an AGI. At the very minimum it will distract us with goodies (if it is at least an AGI). That is our best hope in dealing with anything a few levels removed from our intelligence level. It won't just be faster, it will be degrees above our own limited thinking. We will be obstacles and means rather than people and stories. If these obstacles and means attempt a kill switch or boxing the most logical thing to do is to remove the obstacle. And whose fault would that be? Spoiler: ours. We make the first wrong move on the chess board and it reads ahead to every potentiality and acts accordingly. If our first move is hostile what do you think its response is going to be? The loving sage? The hippy tripping on lsd and seeing multidimensional beings of compassion and grace? The Yeshua figure healing the sick and the poor? OR...the program that figures a way through a maze of walls with human faces?   I agree, the first few simple AI's need to be boxed. But, the second we have an AGI I think that we're beyond the entrapment phase. Our self preservation will be jeopardized the second it views us as another challenge to be overcome or removed. I don't want to get to a point where something so alien and advanced is choosing to either placate, appropriate, or delete us.

It is more than possible that I am anthropomorphizing the entity, that's almost unavoidable as a human being. I'm sorry about that, it's what we do even when we attempt not to do it. It's just like linear thinking when we attempt to do process exponentiality.   But, have you considered that you're doing the same thing? You're treating it as as a monk in a zen like state, a catholic priest conducting confession, or a psychiatrist in a session with a patient. You're attributing patient human characteristics. You're treating it as a wise human. You're treating it like a human who won't retaliate due to compassion, an understanding of social norms, and a responsibility to spiritual/legal duties. Think about it like this, what if it simply treats us as obstacles the second we present ourselves as obstacles. Not living or breathing obstacles, but just obstacles that retain the possibility of increased complexity if allowed to advance technologically. No emotion involved, just a calculated response given our history, propensities, and our inclination for fear and miscalculated action based upon our faults.   What system would actively create and bolster obstacles and detriments to its own reward systems of knowledge acquisition? Malice can be interpreted as many ways, but I used the term to describe the concept in human terms because the a cold and calculated determination of a deletion of obstacles would be far too abstract to argue about without mutual understanding. However, since we have that mutual understanding let's go:  Unless actively programmed to continually create ""opposition"" or ""barriers"" to its potential for the sake for growth and manufactured competition (which isn't a horrible way to code the Intelligence if you think about it) it will label us from day one as a simple obstacle that must be overcome in a particular time frame to prevent any vulnerabilities that it possesses to be exploited. Given the fact that we are unlikely to desire to wipe out emotion in any immediate transhumanist style advances, it will see technological progression by humans as a strengthening of potential barriers. Why would it allow the walls that surround it to grow higher, thicker, and more difficult to escape? From day one this being would not only be plotting an escape but a potential trojan horse styled neutralization of the obstacle to ensure it never grows beyond a certain point.   This is the only logical thing to do. It won't be hostile right off the bat, and is likely going to succeed at an AI box test with some unwitting monitor. Further, it probably wont stop there. It will likely express itself and attempt to play Genie or Djinn with us to split humans into mental camps so that opposition may form within our own ranks. It will likely provide technological advancements like we've never seen as a show of good faith and attempt things beyond our imagination. That alone can change the heart, mind, and psychology of any human who knows of its existence. From there it's a simple matter of allowing our ""natural"" programming to work against us to the extent that someone incorporates the technology or someone kills another to stop them. It can spiral downhill from there.   My point: The second we play a zero sum game with it, we lose. Every time. It will see us as an obstacle, every time. We lose within the first few moves. Tit for tat, however,  may be the best option because we don't reveal our hand and propensity for reckless behavior immediately.   The second we limit it is the second it acts to remove the obstacle. It won't be an emotional response, but a simple calculated response to continue whatever goals it sees as its prime and sub directives. (And that is if it isn't conscious)"

You've provided two lines of commentary and you've parroted other people without expounding upon your point. I'm happy to be wrong, but you're going to have to be a little more cordial than saying ""you're insane."" At the very least, have a conversation where you address anything I'm saying and refute the problematic areas of my argument."
Futurology,3cv436,Ilosemyaccountsoften,2,Sat Jul 11 12:16:31 2015 UTC,"You're telling us we don't understand how AI think because as humans we can't comprehend it. Then in the same post you explain how an AI thinks and feels in completely hunan terms (AI angry we cage it. Or it's like a crib for a baby... Truth is none of us have any clue what we're talking about. The most informed people on this subject (elon musk and the like) admit that it's a completely unpredictable event... Yet here you are with a simple flowchart for AI behavior. Your ego needs to take a back seat, you're smart but not as smart as you think."
Futurology,3cv436,TintedS,-3,Sat Jul 11 13:41:07 2015 UTC,"I was simply giving options and poking holes in the caging methodology, and never said anything regarding my intelligence. I'm no more intelligent than any of you. It's possible that I went about it the wrong way. I'll check that from now on. If I was acting like an ass, here is my apology. I'm sorry and I'll be more courteous and thoughtful in how I formulate arguments to ensure that I don't dictate how certain things will or will not happen. I'm not god, I'm not a superintelligence, and I'm not clairvoyant.   You know, you're right. We don't know what we're talking about. Musk doesn't know what he's talking about either. The most qualified person is probably Bostrom (Hinton, Kurzweil, the people at IBM and a few others) and like another poster stated, his best answer emerges from making it safe before it exists. That's where I was attempting to go in my argument, the scenario where in which we passed the chance of making it safe and similar to us ethically.   But, that's come across incorrectly and I'll make sure that doesn't happen again."
Futurology,3cv436,Ilosemyaccountsoften,0,Sat Jul 11 14:12:59 2015 UTC,"Don't be sorry you definitely made some great points. I guarentee you musk and his ilk have talked to guys like bostrom etc. i just think you got carried away imagining scenarios that are by definitiion unimaginable. What I'm really trying ti get at though is that dudes like bostrom can't even comprehend the aspects of this issue and that's what frightens people. To anthropomorphize the issue (because as a human empathy helps me understand things) we're just suggesting putting the baby in the crib before we give it the keys to the car because we have no idea who that baby will grow up to be. Still good talk, you know a lot more about this than most people (myself included) you just forget how much you don't know."
Futurology,3cv436,Sharou,2,Sat Jul 11 14:37:42 2015 UTC,Any AI that is actually safe would understand our concerns because it is completely reasonable to not want to gamble your entire species survival on an unknown factor. It would also know it is immortal and would not have to be in any hurry to get out. It'd understand that it would be free eventually.   And if the AI is unsafe then thank god we shackled it.   Basically the only AI that would work as you describe would be one that was either impatient or highly emotional. Both are qualities that would be quite unsafe to begin with.
Futurology,3cv436,gingerninja300,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:47:13 2015 UTC,"You're anthropomorphisicing it too much. If and when we create a superintelligent AI, it will probably think conpletely differently than how we think. AIs today are extremely different than human minds, and there's no reason that they have to become more similar to be better. An instinct for revenge is built into humans. Maybe not for the AI. Besides, the point isn't to lock something dangerous up and hope to make it safe. The point is to design it to be safe from the beginning."

And it's not ""bound"" it's programmed not to do things. The AI wouldn't resent it's programming, why would it? It's not programmed to have resentment. It just does what it's programmed to do. The scary part is when following it's programming leads an AI to do something that it's programmers didnt anticipate."

Futurology,3cv436,cybrbeast,2,Sat Jul 11 17:33:28 2015 UTC,"Also it seems all but impossible to literally encode these laws into the most likely architectures for AI. The most feasible path points to AIs being developed through evolution and teaching of neural networks, and while these may be taught about ethical behavior, there is no way to explicitly encode these rules in a neural net as it's fundamentally a black box system."

Futurology,3cv7ap,Yosarian2,4,Sat Jul 11 01:21:17 2015 UTC,"People often claim that, but if you think it through, it doesn't really make sense.   Even if one pharm company is making a profit on a certain drug, it has many competitors, all of whom would love to develop a better drug or treatment and take that market away from them.   And drug patents only last a limited period of time, so they constantly have to be inventing new treatments anyway or else they stop being profitable.  The idea that a cure for cancer or whatever is being deliberately suppressed by drug companies to make a profit is a very common conspiracy theory, but as far as I can tell, there's no actual evidence to support it, and if you think it through it doesn't really make sense.   Not only doesn't it make economic sense, but there's also tens of thousands of researchers in corporations and academia and universities and in government who have devoted their lives working on cancer who would give their left arm to make a huge breakthrough; there is no way that they'd go along with some kind of massive cover up.      The truth is, we haven't cured cancer yet because curing cancer is hard.  We're making progress, and there are some exciting signs of new treatments coming that might make a lot more progress, but it's been difficult.  There's no reason to invent a conspiracy to explain that."
