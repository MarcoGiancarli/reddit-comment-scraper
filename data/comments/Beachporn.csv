Beachporn,3775uz,xxsheepdoggxx,1 point,Mon May 25 15:29:05 2015 UTC,Ya we were there in July and I guess the spring is the best if you are looking for blue skies. The silver haze in the air wasn't the best for photography. Railay and Koh Yao weren't very crowded and that was really the main reason for those 2 locations in the south. Koh Yao wasnt spectacular to look at but the views of Phang Nga National Park were impressive and we were some of the only tourists on the island which was very nice. Railay is for sure one of the more spectacular places I have ever seen. Not much to do unless you are a rock climber but absolutely amazing to just relax and enjoy the scenery!

My understanding is that there is no power grid for Tulum and properties must be self sufficient in this regard.  As a consequence, it's not practical for large scale hotels/resorts.  I also imagine this will change eventually :("
Beachporn,34uhsq,food_monster,2,Tue May 5 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"It's grown tremendously. The beach road is packed with tourists and water trucks.

Beachporn,34orsh,11GTStang,1 point,Sun May 3 19:50:18 2015 UTC,Thank you! I love it when beaches aren't full of people so I'll definitely go out of my way for that
Beachporn,34orsh,maegan0apple,2,Sun May 3 20:17:40 2015 UTC,"Orient beach is cool to see, but all the cruise ships stop there and mullet bay. Of course Maho beach has the people looking to catch some airplane jet wash. You should check out Maho and orient while you are there, but just to check off the list.   West of Maho is cupecoy. Usually pretty quiet and you can watch the planes come in. Park across from the mall and there is a little pathway that leads to it. Anse Marcel was really high end and didn't feel like a typical Caribbean beach. Very French and wealthy. Pinel Island is another hot spot. Take the ferry over and bring cash to rent chairs and an umbrella.   But out of all the beaches we chilled at, happy bay was our consistent favorite. I think there may have been a beach bar there, but we never saw anyone working it.  If you have the chance, a day trip to Anguilla is an absolute must. I've never seen better beaches than what they have. Meade Bay holds the number one spot in my book.   Here is my own album of st Maarten/Anguilla.  https://www.flickr.com/gp/gtstanger94/4zA31B"
Beachporn,34orsh,11GTStang,2,Sun May 3 20:36:42 2015 UTC,Your pictures are gorgeous! Anguilla does look really awesome.  Was it pricy to take a day trip over there?  Also what time of year were you there?
Beachporn,34orsh,maegan0apple,1 point,Sun May 3 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  We went in July. It is $30 round trip I believe for the ferry from Marigot. The day before, I emailed andys car rental right next to the ferry terminal in Anguilla and had a car waiting that day. The rental was $60 for the day. You need a car on the island to see everything you want to see. It's basically flat and there are tons of beaches."
Beachporn,34orsh,11GTStang,2,Sun May 3 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"We looked into it and we'll be going over there for a day, already got the car rental set up.  We'll probably at least go to Meads Bay and Shoal Bay East.  Your pics inspired me, plus it's right there and I can add another place to my list of places I've been :)"
Beachporn,34orsh,maegan0apple,2,Fri May 8 19:58:42 2015 UTC,"Fantastic!!! Glad I helped in some way! The terrain is so different from the mountainous terrain of SXM. Use your map and explore all the beaches. They are all pretty quiet and empty when we were there. Shoal Bay West is where we started and then trekked all the way back east. It's an easy island to get around and the people are quite friendly! Feel free to get lost!  Also check out Blanchards on Meads bay. I have the menu on that Flickr link and it aimed to please. Plus the beaches chairs out front make for some good photos :)   http://blanchardsrestaurant.com/  Sandy island was ok. I believe it was about $40pp? For a boat to go out there. The crew was kinda bored when they picked us up and gave us a tour of the area. Took us to Happy Bay and some cool cliffs. If you don't have time, I don't think you're missing out on a whole lot.   Let me know if you have any questions on either island!"

Beachporn,2xu428,pcpBandit,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"from your perspective maybe. but I would hate it if every photographer edited their photos from the original picture just to have it look nicer, the purpose of these subreddits is to capture the world in its beauty, and part of the beauty is us, having the horizon slanted just shows that a person took this, and using a computer to fix it isn't fair. just enjoy what others bring us."
Beachporn,2xu428,NjStacker22,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:48:00 2015 UTC,"I don't need a slanted horizon to prove that someone took it.... someone always takes the photo unless there is some new robot out there snapping pics that I don't know about. Also, ""fixing"" photos using a computer is part of the process for 99% of photographers. It's processing and it's been done for many many years.  I do enjoy the photo as is... but IMO the horizon should be straightened out. We can agree to disagree on this one."
Beachporn,2xu428,pcpBandit,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:31:16 2015 UTC,"nah, robot overlords could have totally taken a better picture, so i'm gonna flat out say youre wrong there. also look at the palm tree :P its coming straight out of the ground. the ground is level, by straightening the horizon youre actually making the palm tree come from a different angel than straight up.

Beachporn,1jilj8,clbro,1 point,Thu Aug 1 19:57:22 2013 UTC,"Haha, holy crap.  I stayed at the house on top of the point in the background.  My wife and I snorkeled around that cay, found a big lobster and an eel, very cool!  Reasonably priced too at like $1200 for the week I think.  Had a problem with the house where the water had a minor electrical current so you would get zapped when you washed your hands but other than that it was excellent.  Here's a view from the deck and Here's the cay from another angle"
