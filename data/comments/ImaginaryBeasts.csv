There's also a download button, which gives you the highest rez version of the image.  Favoriting an artwork on DA makes it's popularity go higher, making easier to see in searches. It also notifies the artist that ""hey, I like this, keep it up"".  There's also the watch system, and it's how I get like 90% of the artwork I post around the network. Every time an artist I watch makes something, I'm notified."
