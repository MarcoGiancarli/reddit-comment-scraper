LandCruisers,3dt38g,bigbuddysam,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:00 2015 UTC,no I dont. I removed both rows of seats from the back so my dogs have more room. My front seats driver side both have small rips on the drivers side passenger sides are like new. The sun roof on the black one dont open top is racked from the roll over. I just replaced the condenser and the receiver dyer for the A/C on the green one yesterday. A/C on both works as they should. I love how these trucks drive. I do my own maintenance and have no issues other than NO.1 oxygen sensor went out on the green one a while back. both still have original exhaust on them.I find them very easy to work on and I bought the factory service manual for them. I only own Toyotas my wife drives a Tundra and a MR2.  I only use synthetic oil in them. happy trails.
LandCruisers,3dt38g,brakasha,3,Tue Jul 21 11:29:37 2015 UTC,"They're asking way too much, but being that it's a dealership, that makes sense. Does the center differential lock engage when you put it in 4 lo? Does it disengage quickly when you set it back to 4 hi? I had the same problem with the diff locks, and it's likely that the solenoid on the transfer case is stuck.  Pull it out, exercise it manually, run a current through it (a 9volt and some small alligator clamps works perfectly) and pop it back in. Fixed the problem immediately for me and both diff locks engaged after that.  My 96 had 220k (replacement engine only had 125k on it) when I bought it, has factory lockers, no rust, and similarly very well taken care of with a car fax a mile long. 5200 bucks.  Is there a lift kit on the thing? I feel like U joints shouldn't go out unless you've got non-stock drive train geometry without the proper corrective measures (adjustable control arms, castor correction, etc)."
LandCruisers,3dt38g,brakasha,2,Sun Jul 19 14:54:17 2015 UTC,"Center diff lock seemed to work well. Light on, light off. There wasn't any loose surfaces nearby so I didn't really try anything out beyond that.   Yeah, I intend on beating them up on that price a bit.   There was no lift kit. No signs of abuse or real off road use either. It's rockin Michelin ltx ms tires. They couldn't have possibly meant birfield joints, could they?"
LandCruisers,3dt38g,PrimeNumber2,4,Sun Jul 19 15:42:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't even think about that. They may well have meant those.  Another thing you should look into: an OBD2-port plugin scanner. I have an ultra gauge, but there are a lot of other products similar. You can program it to read out basically anything there's a sensor for. I have mine reading block temperature, intake temperature, MPGs, among others. I mainly use it to monitor temperature. Recently did a whole bunch of cooling system work (pump, hoses, radiator, fan clutch rebuild, return to Toyota red coolant, etc) and the average temperature has gone down 15 degrees. You should never have to run at more than 190, and never ever over 200. Overheating is one of the only causes of damage to your engine, either directly or indirectly (warping causing slow long-term damage or busting a cylinder/valve causing immediate destruction). So look into a cooling system overhaul. Pesky heater hose, other cracking hoses/old clamps, radiator, pump, fan clutch etc all cost me less than $500 to do myself and my truck is so much happier."
LandCruisers,3dt38g,brakasha,2,Sun Jul 19 16:41:42 2015 UTC,"You should never have to run at more than 190, and never ever over 200.   Funny, IIRC Toyota lists operating range on these motors as 190F-195F. In general this is a perfectly safe range, and you might see more depending on condition. For example, my wife's black 97 with all new Brass Radiator, Aisin Fan Clutch runnning 15 cst fluid, new water pump, hoses and HG will run in between 190-200 in Houston and will run hotter than that in the mountains. I don't really worry about that too much. I absolutely don't like running it over 200, but it doesn't make me as nervous as most of 'Mud, who are by in large the most dedicated bunch of enthusiasts I have ever heard about, but over engineer and over analyze everything.   I chock the fact that I cant get sub-190F temperatures up to the fact that its black and just gets hot as shit. I am pretty sure that's good for another couple degrees. But even if we see an catastrophic failure, I'm ok.... the wife is really into the Cummins 5.9."

LandCruisers,3dt38g,brakasha,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:40 2015 UTC,"Look at the carpets and seats. I think they only came in leather after 95?  Holes in the carpet can't easily be fixed, and if any of the seats are ripped or cracked through, it pretty much needs replaced at 500 bucks without shipping or labor.  Invest in a set of Husky or Weathertech floor/cargo liners. I'm loving mine. Check all buttons, both on the doors and seats as well as console. Do the seat belt tensioners retract the belts or do they flop around and get caught in the door once you unclip?Does the A/C work?  Does the antenna control still extend/retract the antenna?  Did you ever manage to get those lockers to engage, by the way? These are all things that should bring their price down."
LandCruisers,3dt38g,bigbuddysam,2,Mon Jul 20 22:06:41 2015 UTC,"The front did, rear did not. Stay flashing after putting it through some turns on a loose surface. I dunno, nothing sounds bad, it might need more exercising than the front did maybe?  The drivers seat is seam split right where you'd expect. The others are good, the carpet is good. The front and back movement on both power seats seems jammed, like one of the rails is hung up. Up and down is good. Windows are good, a bit slow, and the right window has a slight forward tilt as it goes down, but straightens up as it hits the top. All the buttons seem to work, the antenna works, the ac seems weak but present. To be fair it was in excess of 95 degrees and I only really ran it for about 15 minutes.   The ugliest thing are all those wood laminate bits are faded and peeling, and the door handles are not really attached to the door anymore.  Not the ones to open it, but the hand holds on the door. It looks good until you pull them.   I think it's seen a hell of a lot of sunlight, not surprising being down in Florida. Apart from the rear diff thing though, I wish it was as nice aesthetically as it is mechanically. Very clean underneath, no leaks that I can see. It was parked in its current location for a few days and nothing. No excess grease anywhere. Fluids all look good, oil looks new, coolant is bright. It was green so I guess they switched to prestone. Other fluids all looked good. Engine compartment and undercarriage are clean and generally rust free.   It drives well. I'm pretty keen on this stuff because I'm particular. 2nd start and power buttons work as advertised. Engine is smooth and sounds like a typical healthy ohc engine when you're under the hood.   I don't really know where my expectations should be at on the interior condition and I'm not exactly spoiled for choice. The dealer hasn't really touched it so it's not been cleaned. It's definitely not trashed, just worn and old."
LandCruisers,3dsd2g,iCylon,3,Sun Jul 19 00:10:04 2015 UTC,Any 80 series will last you like a champ. They're unbelievably reliable. The only drawback to the 80 is the mileage sucks. If that's not an issue you could make a good argument that it's the best truck you could pick.
LandCruisers,3dsd2g,Monsterpiece42,2,Sun Jul 19 00:28:42 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/Nha76xh
LandCruisers,3dsd2g,dolomite592,2,Sun Jul 19 00:11:47 2015 UTC,The price seems decent for the mileage. I'd recommend having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a shop you trust. These trucks are reliable if their maintenance is kept up. But when things need fixed they can be costly. At that mileage you're looking at a front axle rebuild and possibly head gasket replacement in the near(ish) future. But those mileage aren't set in stone. Just know what you're buying!

(I know Tor personally and he's a good guy, so I support him, but if you are on a budget then why not make them yourself).   Check the classifieds second on Ih8mud. People part out 60-series all the time and you could buy good used interior parts. I found a bunch of parts on there for my old 60-series and now 40-series. Craigslist was a good options too. Look for vehicles with bad frames/engines and buy them out for the interior parts.  When I owned one I wanted to swap out the rear carpet for horse stall liner, it takes more abuse and cleans up better. Wagon gear makes some very nice looking ABS panels to replace the stock ones in the cargo area too but they are really spendy."
LandCruisers,3cfhio,irish1185,2,Tue Jul 7 19:53:18 2015 UTC,"Seconded.  You can pick up some HDPE or some ABS panels, using your existing panels as a template, and make new ones pretty cheap.  I am seriously considering bedlining the entire rear cargo tub and then dropping in a new marine carpet for the cargo area with mass-loaded vinyl glued to the bottom of it.  You can take the carpet out when you want/need and it can be removed and cleaned with a hose.   Check out ManuChao on the IH8MUD forum.  He has done a bunch of stuff to his truck on the cheap and it doesn't look bad."

LandCruisers,3cbk87,RichardLillard1,2,Sat Jul 11 02:49:07 2015 UTC,I've heard that too but I am of the opinion along with others that the inspection plug on the knuckles is useless for adding grease since it doesn't actually get into the joint. The only way to grease them is to take them out and pack them which is a filthy job.
LandCruisers,3cbk87,PippyLongSausage,2,Sat Jul 11 13:59:45 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing until I started hanging out with the guy that goes by Tools R Us on mud.   Essentially you use the inspection plug to check the level and keep it at around 2/3 full of grease. The knuckle packs itself as you drive, turn, etc.   When I first bought the truck, he added half a tube to each side, you could see the level and a couple weeks later it had actually gone down, without leaking out of the truck. Put more in and the level stayed about where it should."

Pictures of the undercarriage do not show the frame in any kind of detail. I suspect that this truck has a lot of hidden or improperly repaired rust and would not buy it.

LandCruisers,3aj1s6,PM_ME_UR_HTTPD_CONF,2,Sat Jun 20 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"You could not possibly go better than a BJ74 for a compact 4WD, especially with that budget. The only other thing I would go for at that budget would be a HDJ78R turbo-diesel troopy, but that is not an option in North America.  I have a BJ73 with the 3B diesel - the BJ74 has the 13B-T direct-injection turbo-diesel and is very liveable in the city. My 3B is marginal at best with its 66kW & 215Nm, but the 13B-T with its 96kW and 295Nm would be very, very nice.  Those Japanese LCs will be in much better nick than my used and abused aussie outback-basher 73, and will be much better equipped. I've followed Land Cruisers Direct on Facebook for a few years now, and you could not go wrong with them - the quality of their work is outstanding. You will have no trouble with them hiding rust or dodgy drivetrain/engines.  Even though HZJ73s are available in NA now because they are 25 years old, I think a BJ74 will be a better unit for almost every need because of its turbo engine. The 1HZ, while a very good engine (it has to be to still be in production today, 25 years later), is a bit lethargic and doesn't have the perkiness of the 13B-T.  The bad points:   single 90L fuel tank can be limiting, but 80L aux tanks and 125L replacement main tanks are available FRP top means awkward to fit roof rack, will need a custom-made unit 13B-T (and 3B to a lesser extent) is not as well equipped in the spares availability department compared to its 6-cylinder brothers the 2H & 12H-T Brakes can be considered lousy by modern standards, but i'm sure LCs Direct can advise potential modifications if it is an issue for you No footrest & footwells are quite small by modern standards. When you jump in, don't be put off by how small the footwell feels - once you start driving it you get used to it easily and it is a better layout than most 4WDs of a similar era Standard sealed-beams are shocking beyond all recognition, on both low-beam and high-beam. 24V system can be difficult   The good points:   It's cool 13B-T is nice for city and hill driving H55F is a very good gearbox with a nice feel (not as nice as the later turbo-diesel/petrol H150F but still very good) steering is light and reasonably direct for a recirculating ball system Is compact and its light steering makes easy work of it's turning circle You will have an irremovable smile every time you jump in Clutch is much nicer, much nicer, than a Land Rover or even Nissan or similar era Seats are soft and comfortable Dashboard is immensely practical, although he may want to get a Doug's Tub 13B-T is quieter and smoother than the 3B everything   Give us a shout with any questions :)"

LandCruisers,39mh42,BadgerFlame,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:32:15 2015 UTC,I nearly bought one in perth for $4000 and was talked out of it :(
LandCruisers,39mh42,pierpstain,2,Fri Jun 12 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"That price seems reasonable based on the description, but the guy isn't doing himself a lot of favors by only having one crappy picture in his listing, and being snarky about peoples' requests for more pics and info.  Only way to know for sure is to go look at it.  Bring a magnet, research the common rust areas, and spend a lot of time going through it.  The first question is whether you want a project rig.  Second question is whether you're willing to learn how to do body repair.  If you don't want to do the body repair yourself, it's going to be extremely expensive to pay somebody else to do it.  I personally think the ~$8-12k rigs, which usually have rust issues just like this one, are the most expensive rigs to buy (ignoring the Conours correct rigs of course).  If you want to fix it up and get completely rid of rust, repaint it, replace all of the rubber seals, etc you're talking maybe $10k-$15k of parts and TONS of time and effort.  Way more if you pay a professional.  At the end of it, you'll be left with a rig that isn't worth what you put into it.  If you want to buy a 40 because you want a nice rig, then I'd pass and just buy a restored one.  If you want to buy a 40 because you want the experience of fixing it up and the enjoyment you get out of that process is worth paying the premium, then go for it.  The third possibility is that you just want to drive it as is and enjoy it despite its rough condition.  Perfectly acceptable approach, and as long as you don't let it deteriorate further, you won't have any depreciation when it's time to sell someday (if anything its value will increase).  tl;dr.  If you ultimately want a restored/refreshed rig, pass- too much money and effort.  If you want to drive it as-is, the price is reasonable."

The 1FZ-FE seen in later models is more economical, but they are both pretty poor. 1HD-T/FT or, if the budget is limited, 1HZ is the way to go, but in NA you're practically confined to petrol only.  If he has service records for the last 10 years, it has no chassis rust and limited/none body rust and the engine sounds sweet after a cold start, get out the checkbook."

If you are going to spend any time on trails and can afford to be patient, hold out for the 1FZ-FE with factory lockers. I paid 5200 for my 96 with lockers (also came with 5 brand new 33"" BFG ATs, so you could probably find the same for 4500ish) that had 200k on the body and 125k on the engine. After the usual mods (pesky heater hose swap, water pump replaced, new radiator, disabled EGR, among others all done myself for a total of about $700) it's running beautifully. Lockers work, all electronics work, and it had zero rust, even coming from Northern PA. The PO said the only reason he had to swap the engine was because his wife was driving, towing a boat on an incline without using the power/towing setting. He struck me as a bit simple, though, so I would expect it was more likely consistent idiotic abuse."
LandCruisers,38mhdi,brakasha,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:29:58 2015 UTC,"Also I might add it seems that this one has not seen offroad action according to the owner. It has not been abused in that respect. Then again I don't know if you can really abuse these-lol  My old taco did not have lockers and I never got stuck (10 years of wheeling), we went though rivers,  over rocks, went up mountains and crossed deserts with it.  How necessary are factory lockers, my understand is I can swap in a locker fairly easy. I am correct in that assumption?"
LandCruisers,38mhdi,brakasha,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:03:49 2015 UTC,"You would have to go with aftermarket air lockers most likely, and you're looking at 2500 for both axles + compressor.

LandCruisers,38mhdi,Quatermain,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:25:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with the folks saying to hold out for a 94+.  The 3FE isn't a bad engine, but it is almost a tractor engine.  Its not great on the freeway. It can have trouble keeping up with traffic in terms of acceleration (merging onto busy freeways) and top speed.  The 1FZ is a much more modern engine with better gas mileage and a lot more power, and it is still great off road.  Also tends to be easier to get parts for the 1FZ these days.    I'd check out the ih8mud.com forums and ask if anyone knows of a good one up for sale."

LandCruisers,38mhdi,BiasedBIOS,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"Tidy. The truss on the front is a waste of space unless you only want to hang antennas/lights on it. Check the 4WD system for full operation - pay attention to centre diff locking time. My understanding of American prices for LCs is that this is a tad high considering the P/S & A/C issues, but someone closer to you will be able to chime in. Obviously you will need to do all the usual checks that would apply to any medium-mileage LC - rust, gearbox, cold-start engine.  I'm not sure why people are turning you off the 3F-E on claims of low power, its got heaps unless you are trying to sit on 80mph+ up a hill. Then again I daily-drive a 68kW 3B diesel. I would lean towards thinking the 3F-E is more robust & long-lived, but the 1FZ-FE is probably less likely to have as many miles of wear under it as a general rule."

Although a buddy of mine used to run 35s on his 100, so yes that would have been a huge help.   But check out ~3:30 in the video. Even with a solid axle front, I would have put a tire on that rock.

LandCruisers,3883vc,Jordanis,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:32:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's that for bigger tires, too. I've gotten as high as 16.5 for stretches of driving across town late at night, not really going faster than 45 and catching green lights.   To a certain extent, it's a Land Cruiser, so I get there when I get there and that makes a nice excuse for hyper-mpg'ing an 80 (probably the single most redundant statement I've ever made)."

LandCruisers,3883vc,mytoysgoboom,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:06:09 2015 UTC,I've been tracking the eBay prices as I'm looking to drop don to an 80 from my 100. The price have been insane. $16k issue understandable for a relatively modded truck with a rebuilt engine.   Guy by me was selling an 80 fully modded and with an engine swap to a diesel for $26k and it was listed for easily 8 months.   Check the ih8mud forums for more realistic pricing.
LandCruisers,3883vc,deprivedchild,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:42:57 2015 UTC,"I'm curioua, but why are you going from a 100 to an 80? I know 80s are a lot cheaper, but I feel drawn more to a 100 for the IFS (More comfort for long range) and for being a bit more modern."
LandCruisers,3883vc,mytoysgoboom,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:38:58 2015 UTC,"i like the 100 but it's harder for me to work on.  I learned how to wrench (DIY) from my dad while we restored my first LC, a 1987 60 series. I've also been looking at doing some of the mods I want, and the 100 series is just harder to work with for someone with only moderate mechanic skills.    as far as the more modern, what are you looking for?  my has a nav system with a screen, but i never use it except for the radio.  the nav itself doesn't work consistently.  If I remember right, there was a known error with a software update that caused issues with the older systems.  plus, I'd rather use my iphone anyways.  i never use the cd changer bc I have a $40 bluetooth radio transmitter that I use for music with my iphone.    it also depends what you're going to do with it long term.  Realistically, I would be fine keeping the 100 as I won't do any really hardcore offroading or crawling.  My long term goal is to set whatever I end up with as a overlanding rig of sorts, so I can go camping/exploring more easily with my family.    but if you think you want to do some serious offroading, the solid axle front on the 80 may be beneficial.    all that being said, i just happen to really love the look of the 80s.  frankly, if my wife would let me, i'd buy another 60.  four on the floor and 2wd/4wd selectability was nice.  and those are my favorite in terms of look."
LandCruisers,3883vc,Dan_Quixote,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"A question about the V8.  One of the things that interests me in the 80 is the bulletproof I6.  I understand the V8 will have more power, etc. but is it as reliable, easy to work on/easy to get parts for?"
LandCruisers,3883vc,frequentpooper,3,Wed Jun 3 00:52:04 2015 UTC,"I haven't owned the Toyota I6, so I can't make a relative comparison. But the V8 (2UZ-FE) is known to be extremely reliable. I haven't had to do any work on it yet besides minor routine maintenance - everything seems reasonably accessible otherwise. Some parts can be a little more difficult to find at the typical local parts stores than the average car but definitely not ""difficult"". Napa or Rock Auto always have what I've needed.   I've seen both the 80 and 100 take incredible abuse in terrible conditions in several 3rd world countries. In fact, in Bolivia with the nastiest conditions for a vehicle that I've ever seen, 80s and 100s are standard issue. No other modern truck can take the abuse that the Andes and Salar de Uyuni can dish out.  It's awe-inspiring in ways that just can't be appreciated in the developed world."

LandCruisers,383iof,greenvilledoc,2,Mon Jun 1 16:22:24 2015 UTC,Have a mechanic look it over and give you an idea what will need attention right away and what can wait. Look around online at parts you might need. You will end up spending more repairs and upgrades but it's money well spent.  They can be kind of money pits but you can also save money buy learning to work on it yourself.
LandCruisers,383iof,obsd97,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:49:03 2015 UTC,"Most of them leak, it's not a big deal. Typically the valve cover, oil pump, and front crank seal.   Keep an eye on oil consumption, don't trust the oil light because those are known to crap out.   I bought mine with all three leaks and drove it a ton before addressing them. Switching to a slightly thicker oil helps a lot, too. I run 15W-50 in Arizona, as do a ton of others.   The trucks are damn-near bulletproof so take the time to educate yourself on what works and doesn't, then go from there. A lot of guys in the cruiser community will preach about baseline and making sure you pour assloads of money into the truck before it's ""ready"" and I don't buy this. Baseline is a road in Mesa, AZ, but not something I sidelined the rig for before driving it every day.   As I mentioned on mud earlier today, I bought the truck, gassed up, threw four used tires on it and drove it back to Phoenix in July. Didn't like how warm the AC was, so I got the fan clutch oil changed out and continued driving it, wheeling it a ton before doing a lot of the ""base lining"" that everyone does and/or talks about.   There's a large list of things to look over, but take the time to learn about the vehicle and get to know it before you start throwing your credit card at it. You'd be surprised with how much, or even how little it needs.   Could go on and on, but I'm on my phone, so if you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer when I'm not at work and typing on the tiny keyboard."

Park it up, record it for six months, and when you watch it back at speed you can see the rust actually creep up the bodywork from the ground up!  Exaggerating, but rust is a huge issue for them (all Landcruisers, really). But if you're from a drier climate, it's all good! They're slow, clunky, parts get harder to get. All part of the charm."

LandCruisers,374hme,IvanLyon,3,Sun May 24 20:40:59 2015 UTC,"no problem there, then! Not sure about the Beetle, I had an early 80s 1303S and that wasn't that bad to source, huge VW resources here though. I'd imagine sourcing FJ parts are easier over there than here as you have a good few of them on the road still. I never had a 50 or a 60, mine was a 70 series and it was getting harder to find parts, for sure(and that's with them still being produced in Japan, it was the import costs that were hitting me). But with the internet it's never going to be impossible, just time consuming and potentially pricey. Body panels have fibreglass replacements and they're easy to find, engine and transmission stuff could be a bit harder. The forums will be the place to go. TLOC.co.uk and Landcruiserclub were always good. TLOC is good for information even if it's UK based.  edit: forgot to say, none of this would stop me getting one. I have to stop myself from buying hugely overpriced rustbucket FJ40s over here on a weekly basis, and it's getting harder to resist.

LandCruisers,374hme,admiral_drake,3,Mon May 25 04:16:48 2015 UTC,Cruiser lean. Suspension always leans to one side or ther. Have not seen a single level cruiser that is older than an 80 series. Even with a lift they still lean.   Headlights on 40's and 55's are affected by rpm so a better alternator and a separate harness to the battery for the lights helps keep the lights bright. Round eyes upgrade is worth it's weight in gold.   With the F and 2F oil leaks are common. Cruisers just continuously change oil.   Seal between the tcase and transmission tends to go bad. Causing oil to be pumped from the trans into the transfer case. Couple of work arounds out there.
LandCruisers,374hme,admiral_drake,1 point,Mon May 25 17:41:10 2015 UTC,Second everything here.  I am continually irritated by the lean especially after new springs and shocks.  2F oil leaks are demons.

They have access to double the power by pushing the engine to 5-8k rpms, whereas a F or 2F redline at like 4 and shouldn't go over 3 for any long period of time. They're tough, but just cautioning against expecting lots of SUV power or having better gas mileage since they don't have the power. Pretty torquey though."

LandCruisers,36xn6o,lemon_tea,3,Sat May 23 15:21:36 2015 UTC,"Rust...everywhere.  Tap the body panels all the way around.  You are looking for a change in sound that indicates there is bondo rather than metal under the paint.  Check the gutters for rust spots in the gutter channels.    For nearly $8k, I might expect something more than the truck, unless its in utterly perfect condition.  Troll Hole carb?  H55f?    Check for leaks at the rear axle hubs, front knuckles, transmission, xfer case, and differentials and at the hub locks.  The hub locks and the knuckles will leak, and the seals break down, and rebuilding these is a standard service item, but it shouldn't be excessive unless the maintenance has bee poor or infrequent..  Check that the prop shaft zerks have been kept fed with grease (should be grease on the underbody in line with the plane of spin for all zerks on the front and rear prop shafts).  Make sure it shifts easily into and out of 4wd and 4wd low.  Drive it forward and reverse in 4wd and 4wd low.  Take 4wd up to about 40 mph with the hubs locked and pay attention to noise and vibration.  Check wear on steering components.  Is the steering box or pump leaking?  How do the connecting rods look?  Steering dampener?  Brakes on these tricks suck bad enough with everything in working order.  Take the truck up to 40mph and slam on the brakes like you were about to hit an orphan in a crosswalk.    If you can, pull the plugs and check compression on the motor.  Inspect plugs.  Now look down, does the axle have some old oil evident just below the oil filter?  This is an indication of oil changes being done and isn't a bad thing.  Now, go to the ih8mud forum and read through their checklists as well.  You'll want to familiarize yourself with the forum as I'm sure you'll be returning to it.  :)"

LandCruisers,36xn6o,lemon_tea,2,Sat May 23 18:57:49 2015 UTC,1FZ. And the reason they resist rust is because much of the body is galvanized. Doors are up to the windows.   Look for rust on an 80 starting with the tow hitch and rear bumper/crossmember.
LandCruisers,36xn6o,Fattswindstorm,2,Mon May 25 09:03:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the correction on the engine model number.   Also didn't know the galvanization went only as high as the windows.   Seems odd but seems to work as the trucks rust a hell of a lot less.

LandCruisers,36xn6o,RichardLillard1,2,Mon May 25 08:59:43 2015 UTC,check the knuckles - if they are leaking/caked with gunk they will eventually need to be rebuilt.  check the transfer case for leaks - the skid plate usually collects a good amount so if it is full and the rest is clean they likely wiped it down.  If they have run a hose from the transmission to the transfer that means the seal between the two is not working.  Rust on the bottom of panels is common but not much a problem in my book but look out for any rot in the frame and along the roof and gutters as that can be difficult to deal with.   Motor is 2F - mine has 283k and still going strong :)

LandCruisers,35uhw1,troubadorky,2,Wed May 13 16:49:07 2015 UTC,"Slee Off Road and Ih8mud.com are the 2 authorities on 80/100 series Land Cruisers. Lots of articles and posts on this subject.  I have a 2006 LX which is lifted 2.5 inches. You will need new coil springs for the rear (OME), new torsion bars for the front (OME or Ironman), a diff drop kit to ease the angle of the CV joints (Slee) and you should probably replace the shocks while you are down there as well.  BTW I'm assuming you are doing the lift in order to fit larger tires? You can easily fit 33's with no lift. For 35's you will want the 2.5 lift to avoid rubbing issues. See this FAQ post"
LandCruisers,35uhw1,sonofurbo,2,Wed May 13 20:32:22 2015 UTC,"Already have the larger tires, hard turns cause some rubbing, so yes looking to get that fixed. Thank you for your help!"
LandCruisers,35uhw1,RichardLillard1,1 point,Wed May 13 21:13:40 2015 UTC,My buddy ran the OME lift on his 100 with 35s. Said his biggest complaint was that he never went back to the stock torsion bars and cranked them. Felt that the ride would have been better than the OME ones.   But he has an 80 now and that alone will provide some good entertainment at 100s in the Hills this year.

LandCruisers,35okjo,RichardLillard1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:55:54 2015 UTC,"The 105 only went up to a GXL in Australia. The rear aircon (to the very best of my knowledge) never came in them. Pretty sure its a 100 series VX and Sahara thing. I know it can be done after market, but involves a lot of air-con re-piping and a rear blower/control panel etc. Not a cheap or easy exercise. I just tell my rear passengers to get over it lol. The 105 series would have been the best car toyota ever made, had they included a turbo diesel version with sahara extras.

Did you give your brakes time to cool? Air pressure changes about 2 psi over that elevation difference yet your brake line operates in the hundreds to maybe 1500 psi, so I wouldn't expect high altitude to be the problem in and of itself."
LandCruisers,350pax,Dan_Quixote,1 point,Wed May 6 04:58:40 2015 UTC,"The issue probably started when I was ascending. The brakes were cold.

LandCruisers,350pax,dchymko,3,Wed May 6 04:09:05 2015 UTC,"These brake systems rely on vacuum as a power boost. I'm trying to think of exactly how that would be affected by altitude. In gas engines it comes from the intake, in diesels is a vacuum pump at the back of the alternator."
LandCruisers,350pax,Dodobo,5,Wed May 6 06:34:41 2015 UTC,Perhaps a vac leak is keeping the booster from boosting

LandCruisers,34yyh5,irish1185,1 point,Tue May 5 20:09:14 2015 UTC,"The big thing for me on this one would be the frame condition. Where are you located? With that many miles there are chances its been exposed to some serious road salt (depending on your location). If the frame is good, for that price i'd say go for it. Seats, radio, and other parts are cheap and plentiful for the FJ80 so you should be able the find those. There are also quite a few engine swaps that are common in the 80 as well. You have the better engine of that series in the later 95-97 models so you would have that going for you as well."

LandCruisers,34suo0,Dodobo,2,Mon May 4 08:07:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, it's not necessarily due to volume I think. I mean it will cut out due to loud bass but even at reasonable volumes, going over a speed bump will cause it to cut out"
LandCruisers,34suo0,Dodobo,2,Mon May 4 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm..  I'd start with the speakers and make sure they have solid connections and then check for any bare wire that might be touching metal and grounding out when you hit a bump. On my '84 the rubber grommets that guide wires into the doors for the speakers were trashed and my speaker wires were rubbed bare.  If not that, then it sounds like you may need to investigate the rat's nest of wires behind the head unit."
LandCruisers,34suo0,admiral_drake,1 point,Mon May 4 18:07:52 2015 UTC,"I'd just run new wire, it could be anywhere along the run, under dash, inside doors, eaten by mice, insulation rubbed raw on grommet areas, poor splice to the head unit plug wires, bad crimps.

I'm real close to Moab (3.5 hours) and was down there 4 times last year.  I've been down once already and am going back next weekend with my brothers.  I don't crawl though, I like to run trails but I'd rather see neat stuff then bounce around on the rocks.  I won't run trails that have a decent chance of body damage, I get that there is always the chance but I just don't want to trash my rig.  If I end up getting one of these I don't really see myself doing lift right off or going crazy with mods.  My current JK has only 2.5"" lift and is running 255/75/17 BFG MTs. Its got gears and a rear locker that I had installed and I just found a full width ARB front bumper a month ago after looking for a long time. I bought some used 35s last year to see how I liked them and ended up selling them since I didn't get that much benefit out of them.

Both solid engines and not uncommon.  I'm by now means an expert though.  I'd check over at ih8mud.com to see what people say about having trouble with parts.

It really is a great system but is prone to (very limited) reliability issues when old if not properly maintained, and can cost a boatload to repair if it fails. Most end up replacing the AHC system with a conventional suspension when they fail.  AHC does a miracle of weight leveling - it increases the height of your front and rear depending on the weight distribution in the truck - put a big heavy load in the rear and it will automatically attempt to level the truck.

While it is a generally reliable engine, there are in fact things you should take a look at on it, most notably the water pump/timing belt/heater hose tee's.  As for the cruiser itself, some have had issues with their steering racks but if you aren't noticing any problems you should be good to go provided you don't abuse yours too much.  A great resource for these UZJ100's is ih8mud.com, a community for Land Cruisers.  Congrats on the purchase! It's a great vehicle"

LandCruisers,3082k4,Odonay,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"All of the rotors? Just as a forewarning, the front rotors are harder to replace than the rear ones, for the front, you have to remove the entire hub to actually unbolt the rotors (it's a great design, but a PITA to service). Regardless, replacing them wouldn't be a bad idea, you'd have the peace of mind knowing your braking system was at least in decent shape (provided the brake lines/pump/fluid is fine).  Also, if you're willing/mechanically inclined, don't be afraid of doing some of the easier service work yourself. Stuff like changing the oil/other fluids is pretty easy.   Another thing (I hate to add to your list) is the starter/starter contacts... If for whatever reason you're pulling off the valve covers/top of the engine in general it wouldn't be a bad idea to either replace the starter or replace the starter contacts."
LandCruisers,3082k4,T_Riley,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:15:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information. The seller said the starter was replaced in 2011, so should be good in that department.  I used to do a good portion of my own auto servicing, but I'm currently without a garage -- no good place to work at the moment.  Brakes appear all good but for the rotors. Evidently a shop made a mess of resurfacing them several years ago. Two shops advised replacing them, so I'm doing it. It's not going to be cheap, but as you say, it'll give peace of mind.  Thanks again for the guidance."

LandCruisers,2xw3vj,dopplegangme,6,Wed Mar 4 09:19:34 2015 UTC,"They are interchangeable with slight modification, If you take the top off you cannot just have the ambulance doors so you need to make/buy something that fits the gap. Prices are a little on the rise I would say but many good solid vehicles can be had for 8-10(especially depending on location), Only superb resto vehicles go for the 100k+ Benches I do no believe ever came with the 40, I've heard of people pulling them from vans and whatnot, you can also get them @CCOT. I would let kids ride in my car, I would not let them ride in my car often unless I had a cage installed."
LandCruisers,2xw3vj,MightyBundleofSticks,4,Wed Mar 4 11:36:08 2015 UTC,"Answered already I would say LCs are on sort of a bubble right now, you can get decent examples for ~10k but It seems that many are over priced for the number of cruisers out there restored or otherwise. No benches, I believe you can use a fold n' tumble bench out of a TJ jeep, samurai or others"
LandCruisers,2xw3vj,trommsdorff,2,Wed Mar 4 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"the ih8mud faq has all the info you listed. doors can interchange, but the difficulty oh the modification is very high.  the ambulance doors are taller and must be shortened. all fjs came with rear seats, the early fst came with a bench along the tailgate others are on the wheel wells."
LandCruisers,2xw3vj,pedwards,2,Wed Mar 4 15:45:22 2015 UTC,"As stated below there are different doors/gates depending on the years. The early 40's had a split gate that the top section folded in half. Then they had a clam shell style with a tail gate. After that was the Ambulence doors. There are also two different sets of ambulance doors. The 1975-1978 and the 1979-1983. The latter has a different profile to where they connect to the body. Its not overly noticeable, but one is more rounded than the other. I have a filler panel from CCOT on my 1978 when the top is off (which is all the time since I haven't had a chance to rebuild it yet).  Prices seem to be leveling out. In the last 5 years they have gone up considerably, but they are more stabilized and are gaining like all classics right now. I agree that you can get a solid one for $7-10k. I bought mine at $4k and have about $6k into the rebuild.  There were factory benches, but they are rare. There are plenty of aftermarket options to fill that need along with full cages to cover the entire family. The Latin American version of the FJ also came with a split bench that people have added. I have a set of earlier jump seats (68-73ish) that are doubles. So I can seat 6 in my 40, not that I want to since its a little cramped back there.    Where are you located? There are local clubs around that have monthly meetings (ie an excuse to come drool over cruisers and talk about them). This would be a good way to see all the options in person and talk to fellow cruiser lovers."

LandCruisers,2xw3vj,chevykid1979,2,Thu Mar 5 03:15:25 2015 UTC,They are debating the time and location right now. Usually around 6:30. You did join the cruiserhead group for the info or shoot me a message next week.
LandCruisers,2xw3vj,OldManFJ,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:39:34 2015 UTC,I am also from the Seattle area and I Just bought a fj62

LandCruisers,2xi5ya,chinpokeman,3,Sat Feb 28 23:25:04 2015 UTC,There are 8 bolts holes from the 3rd rows seats that i took out.

LandCruisers,2xde7b,Kingcrowing,7,Fri Feb 27 17:37:50 2015 UTC,"I used to own a '88 FJ60. Loved it.   $15k? Granted it's got 150,000 on it but I'm thinking it's worth less than $10K. I see 'em on CL all the time for $5k-$8k  The pro's and con's of diesel are well-known. If you want an engine that runs forever and live in the cold, perhaps you'll like it. I like my vehicles to be a quiet as possible.  A quick glance on Portland's CL yielded this beauty in Vanc, WA."
LandCruisers,2xde7b,trav15t,3,Fri Feb 27 18:37:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed that it seems quite a bit high.  Also, just fyi, Portland, Maine. Not Oregon."
LandCruisers,2xde7b,FJ_60,2,Fri Feb 27 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah this one is close to me, OR is a bit far...  Price does seem high but I don't see any other Diesel 5-speeds for sale anywhere in my area or on eBay/Hemmings. It's also on eBay for $8k but hasn't hit the reserve."
LandCruisers,2xde7b,Lolux,2,Fri Feb 27 19:53:30 2015 UTC,"You won't like that motor much. Better to buy a gasser and throw a better diesel motor in it. I just bought a bj60 and the motor leaves a lot to be desired . Great trucks, but the motors just aren't that great in the power department."
LandCruisers,2xde7b,pedwards,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:25:54 2015 UTC,"$15k is totally justified in the american market. the diesel version of this truck is great, but was never sold in america."
LandCruisers,2xde7b,SLOdown,3,Sat Feb 28 15:41:59 2015 UTC,"I've always wanted one of these, and seeing one with a diesel and a 5-speed is kind of perfect for me. Price is obviously a bit high, but I've never seen one for sale before and it appears to be in good condition."
LandCruisers,2xde7b,MGTS,2,Fri Feb 27 17:38:42 2015 UTC,That is a bit of a rare rig for the US. The 2H motor and 5 spa was uncommon and the high roof model even more so. That is what is driving the price up. That being said the 2H leaves a lot to be desired in terms of power unless you put a turbo on it. Cruiser diesels prior to those available in the 80 series were more tractor engine than car/truck freeway cruising engines. As mentioned a nice fj60 with say a 6bt or 4bt Cummins swap and a 5 spd would provide a more street friendly rig at a lower cost.   Really nice looking rig and rare that it isn't rusted out. It's worth whatever someone is willing to pay. It is a rare rig for the US for sure.

LandCruisers,2xbfqy,scr709,1 point,Fri Feb 27 06:31:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have bad timing with her! She's actually a sweetheart!"
LandCruisers,2xbs64,dopplegangme,3,Fri Feb 27 06:21:53 2015 UTC,"Good choice. Love the fj40. My pick would be disc brakes, steering mods, engine, (check axels) and lift. Great thing is everything is interchangeable up to modern 75 series. Brakes can come from a hzj75. Original steering is ordinary (front cone arrangement) but reasonably easy to up date to a power steering box with the unit near the front shocky. Engine can be almost anything, chev is common. Just check you have the fine spline axels as the older (pre 75?) axels are weak. Lift can simply be a bit of body lift, but new spring would be preference. Get some fat 31, 33, or 35's under her. Spring over is expensive and needs lots of mods. Check rust in the chassis in the low point just in front on the rear wheels."
LandCruisers,2xbs64,tofa1917,2,Fri Feb 27 11:04:36 2015 UTC,"You can learn to work on an fj40, very simple and easy. Some things might take a while if your doing them the first time. You should know they don't come with P/S option until 79' at least in the states, so turning can be quite adventurous sometimes. All you need to learn to work on it is the FSM and  http://forum.ih8mud.com/forums/40-55-series-tech.8/"
LandCruisers,2xbs64,MightyBundleofSticks,2,Fri Feb 27 15:10:04 2015 UTC,"As far as it being forgiving to work on, yes absolutely.   The main thing that will be hard to do yourself is body work. The mechanical side  is relatively simple. Large engine bay means easy to Tinker. I have some guides I can shoot your way if you remind me, I'm on mobile right now.   What's your price range and where are you looking? It could take you several months to a year to find a solid one."
LandCruisers,2xbs64,crowbahr,2,Fri Feb 27 17:13:39 2015 UTC,"I'm in seattle, Priceline around 10k.  I looked hard a few years ago but wasn't ready to pills the trigger. I'm ready now, but I'm also patient and understand it may take some time."
LandCruisers,2xbs64,crowbahr,2,Fri Feb 27 19:37:55 2015 UTC,"For 10K I wouldn't settle for anything before '74, probably not before '76. You don't want the headache of the F engine, the 2F has all the advantages but none of the issues (like, for example, unfiltered oil making it to the engine because of their strange dual filter system that didn't always work). Late '76 was when they started adding disk brakes (I think front and back but maybe only front). You should be very aware of any rust being in the Pacific Northwest, anything you can see there's probably 4x as much in the crannies and cracks. Even with that in mind bodywork will probably be at least 4 grand if you want it in rust free shape.   You can do anything mechanically by yourself with enough patience. Rebuild the engine? Sure, no problem. The seals and parts might run you $200 but you can do it all yourself. Carburetor acting up? Rebuild it yourself. Electrical system wonky? Replace the alternator or the cables, no problem. The wiring diagram is simple and clear.   Those warnings given,  it is a lovely vehicle and extremely fun to drive. I love mine to the moon and back. Even when things go pear shaped and I've gotta work on it myself it's still absolutely worth my time."
LandCruisers,2xbs64,crowbahr,2,Fri Feb 27 20:26:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I knew about the F and 2F engine difference but did not know the significance of it as you pointed out.    When you say 4k for rust free, is this cosmetic rust we are talking or structural that will limit the life of the vehicle?"
LandCruisers,2xbs64,dontclickthatohjeez,1 point,Fri Feb 27 21:28:23 2015 UTC,"We're talking the kind of rust that gets between the body panels and eats from the inside out. The frame will have rust no matter what but that's not that terribly difficult to handle.   The panels are made of steel, and not thick steel at that. You'll have deteriorated lifespan on those panels if the rust is left in those nooks and crannies. You probably wont have the engine brackets rusting out with the little bit of work you can do on it, nor should you really worry about the leaf springs or frame that much. It's going to be mainly the cosmetics... but that's at least half the value of your vehicle.  You can always just have it repainted and seal things in but it's better to pull it to pieces and get into those nooks and stop the rust at the source."
LandCruisers,2xbs64,RichardLillard1,2,Fri Feb 27 22:22:35 2015 UTC,I'm also lurking on this sub for the same reason. Very little mechanical experience but I really would like to learn. I'm a year or two away from making a purchase though... till then I'll lurk and learn. Cheers and good luck!
LandCruisers,2xbs64,RichardLillard1,2,Fri Feb 27 20:02:00 2015 UTC,"I hang out a lot with Tools R Us and Inkpot from ih8mud. If I were going to build a 40, I would do what they did to Claudia's.   http://forum.ih8mud.com/threads/the-dsrtrdr-is-getting-some-tlc.749124/"
LandCruisers,2xbs64,chain_drive,1 point,Sun Mar 1 14:37:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for linking that.  Is it common to have to do that sort of welding and metal cutting?  I am not sure if I stated or not, but I have next to no mechanical experience, let alone approaching body work."
LandCruisers,2x2gc1,hairylittlehobbit,2,Wed Feb 25 02:46:26 2015 UTC,You should ditch the running boards and put a lift on it. Nice truck.

LandCruisers,2wq40i,gkanai,3,Sun Feb 22 03:15:16 2015 UTC,"Outback is the Japan importer for ARB/OME. This 76 is lifted 2 inches and has 315 ATs on the stock wheels. I was worried that the OME suspension would be stiff but it was really comfortable- probably because the bumper, winch and drawers add weight to offset the stiffer suspension."
LandCruisers,2wq40i,hassonater,3,Sun Feb 22 03:17:05 2015 UTC,I don't understand why Toyota won't produce the 70 series in left hand drive... Dream truck right there.
LandCruisers,2wq40i,Melburnian,3,Sun Feb 22 03:42:25 2015 UTC,"Toyota have other models for markets where LHD is standard. For instance in the US there is the Tacoma, 4Runner, Tundra, Sequoia, FJC, and then the Lexus models. Profitability for the US-built models (Tacoma, Tundra, Sequoia) is probably much higher than for the import models too."
LandCruisers,2wq40i,frequentpooper,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:51:38 2015 UTC,"Realistically it wouldn't sell in the USA, even if it met emissions and safety standards (which it has no chance of doing)."

LandCruisers,2wgeb6,batt_marton,5,Thu Feb 19 18:28:28 2015 UTC,Would do illegal things for this. I love my FJ40 but a 45 diesel would be awesome.
LandCruisers,2wgeb6,irish1185,2,Thu Feb 19 22:25:07 2015 UTC,"Looking at it it might not be a 45, seems like the bed was just chopped off and put on.   At least, I don't remember 45's having that big gap."
LandCruisers,2wgeb6,crowbahr,2,Fri Feb 20 17:08:06 2015 UTC,It might just be the angle on it too. I think the bed might be rounded to fit the gap and its just taken at an angle where you see into the curve of the bed lip. http://www.joetlc.com/images/CIMG1744.JPG  Either way that is one nice looking FJ4x.
