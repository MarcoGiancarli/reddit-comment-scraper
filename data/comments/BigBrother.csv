BigBrother,3e3dzp,limerences,11,Tue Jul 21 17:26:41 2015 UTC,I just want to be able to see Austin's reaction to this season when he finds out. RAWRRR!
BigBrother,3e3dzp,CaitlynnJenner,33,Tue Jul 21 17:47:52 2015 UTC,"As creepy as Austin's obsession is, I love the fact that Liz is being smart and is playing him like a fiddle to her advantage."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,v-r-s,16,Tue Jul 21 19:09:48 2015 UTC,"I hate saying it, but I love how this season is like the anti BB16, with the girls playing the guys this time, instead of being the ones dragged along and used."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Hey_Man_Nice_Shot,13,Tue Jul 21 20:05:34 2015 UTC,I would be mortified if I had to live with someone I don't like and he kept touching me.   Personally my temper would probably ruin my chance at winning because I'd blow up at him.
BigBrother,3e3dzp,FieryFemme,20,Tue Jul 21 19:11:15 2015 UTC,"it's amazing how bad Austin's self awareness is, when he walked in on Jeff w Liz she showed more flirty body language with him in those 5 seconds than she has the entire game with Austin"
BigBrother,3e3dzp,chasingdasun,7,Tue Jul 21 19:23:08 2015 UTC,"lol its funny how with Jeff, Austin was saying ""he makes her uncomfortable!"" yes, Austin, Jeff makes Liz uncomfortable..."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Hey_Man_Nice_Shot,6,Tue Jul 21 20:06:29 2015 UTC,"He's completely delusional. After he walked in on Liz and Jeff he also told someone in the kitchen, maybe Vanessa, that Jeff is in there attacking her."

BigBrother,3e3dzp,onafarawaybeach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"He's also said (paraphrasing):   ""Jeff kept following Liz around and wouldn't leave her alone and, I wanted to break his neck"" ""When Liz describes her type of guy, she's describing me - not Jeff"" ""Liz and I had a connection but she didn't want to be a homewrecker because I had a girlfriend"" ""I keep having anxiety dreams about Jeff"" - described two dreams, one about Jeff taking off with Liz to go to the dentist and Austin frantically having to find them, and another where Jeff was trying to get Liz drunk at the wrap party ""Liz would never go for Jeff - unless there was alcohol involved""   He is so subconsciously afraid of Jeff, and what we all saw, that Liz was really into Jeff and had actual chemistry with him."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,chaz_batch,9,Tue Jul 21 20:31:07 2015 UTC,"It was great yesterday when Austin was waiting for her to come back into the house and he kept saying how much he missed her and wondered if she feels the same way. Then cut to a few hours later and he asks her if she was excited to come back into the house and if she was missing anything while she was away, and she just quickly said ""no"". He even responded by asking again if there was anything she was looking forward to, and she said not really. You could tell he was expecting some sort of ""I couldn't wait to see you"" and/or ""I missed you"", but nope, no amount of fishing for those lines/thoughts helped. You could tell it stung."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Jiggernauts,2,Tue Jul 21 19:45:36 2015 UTC,"That was the worst fishing expedition, such low self-esteem."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,chaz_batch,19,Tue Jul 21 20:33:56 2015 UTC,"I was cringing so hard when he started stroking her arm.    Liz was laying on the edge of the bed, practically crawling off and he was rubbing her arm up and down!"
BigBrother,3e3dzp,chefbsba,6,Tue Jul 21 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"The entire night was him either stroking her hair or arm with his paws like a lion towards prey, except a lion does it with more grace ... it was 1000% cringier than anything Steve has done, or probably will do in the house."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,chaz_batch,6,Tue Jul 21 19:12:21 2015 UTC,Live feed watchers: Is Liz completely uninterested in Austin?
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Muscularpants,17,Tue Jul 21 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"hes such a creep. i dont know how he doesnt pick up on her body language, isnt he always the one screaming ""SOCIAL CUES"" at steve??"
BigBrother,3e3dzp,zaloch,10,Tue Jul 21 19:03:37 2015 UTC,She kinda looks like Scarlet Johansen.
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Rereoc,7,Tue Jul 21 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"Sounds a bit like her, too."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,any_fuzzy_animal,4,Tue Jul 21 19:46:16 2015 UTC,Yeah seriously
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Rereoc,11,Tue Jul 21 20:03:56 2015 UTC,I'm cringing.
BigBrother,3e3dzp,talizorahNR,4,Tue Jul 21 17:52:13 2015 UTC,Liz is pretty hot. Can't blame him.
BigBrother,3e3dzp,lazydumbass,3,Tue Jul 21 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"Beastmode cowboy was like Pepe Le Pew. He never got any positive feedback but this lack drove him even more mad with obsessive lust. Austin actually does get positive feedback though  it's obviously not at the same level and he is quite worried about what she actually thinks about him. Whereas the former was a case of delusion, this is probably more of a case of obsession.   Austin can't be alone and he needs a love object to exist normally, to focus his desire on.   There are so many parallels from last season though that I'm sure it's planned. You had a conservative, straight white undercover cop with a highly unfair advantage vs. a liberal lesbian professional poker player with a highly unfair advantage (her intelligence). You had beastmode, a right wing sexist man that idealized his love object to the point of absurdity and frequently went over the line vs. a left wing feminist who is visibly disturbed by sexism who is obsessed with his own love object (that goes right to the line of acceptability). There's even an obvious Victoria this season.  If it parallels last season then Vanessa should easily win."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,onafarawaybeach,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:22:42 2015 UTC,Hotter than thickums anyway.
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Aqua-Tech,4,Tue Jul 21 20:13:24 2015 UTC,"Liz is the one they referred to as ""thickums"" actually, but it's just kind of an unfortunate identifier because they're both tiny."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,talizorahNR,7,Tue Jul 21 20:21:56 2015 UTC,I don't get all the Austin hate... Yeah he can be clingy but she's leading him on and playing him.... Even Vanessa was telling him how much she(Liz) likes him. He truly thinks she's into him... It's not like beast mode cowboy where he was told over and over again to back off.
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Sean_Ivity,6,Tue Jul 21 19:27:56 2015 UTC,I don't get it either man. She's leading him on and somehow he's the bad guy.
BigBrother,3e3dzp,PatientZeroo,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"It's part of the game. Plus, he really needs to take the hint."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,mehimagoat,5,Tue Jul 21 19:55:48 2015 UTC,He's got a girlfriend at home.
BigBrother,3e3dzp,TylerPerryComo,0,Tue Jul 21 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"Which he has said she doesn't even believe in him and his dreams to wrestle, and he entered the house with them on rocky terms because she didn't want him to go on the show and told him she probably wouldn't wait. And he was playing it up at first because he didn't want a showmance going into the game.. Unless he was lying about that then people should relax a little."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Sean_Ivity,4,Tue Jul 21 19:34:34 2015 UTC,"I mean he's actively trying to cheat on her, he's not about to say ""oh yeah I love her more than anything"""
BigBrother,3e3dzp,TylerPerryComo,3,Tue Jul 21 19:37:03 2015 UTC,I honestly could be mistaking but didn't he break up with her via the live feeds? I can't watch the live feeds all that much so I might miss stuff but from what I see it looks like he's being led on by a pretty girl and everyone is blaming him...
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Sean_Ivity,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he basically did. I saw it on flashback where he said something like ""we both knew that something could happen in here"", that sort of thing.  He's not being led on though. Liz does like him but he is obsessed with her so it's asymmetric. I expanded more here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBrother/comments/3e3dzp/liz_and_austins_relationship_summed_up_in_one/ctbamv3"
BigBrother,3e3dzp,onafarawaybeach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"She says she's leading him on, but her body language says something totally different.  She was also leading Jeff on, but her body language was much more genuine"
BigBrother,3e3dzp,m1a2c2kali,9,Tue Jul 21 19:32:45 2015 UTC,You mean like when when she won hoh and jumped on him right after? She flirts with him all the time too... She knows what she's doing and she's said it.
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Sean_Ivity,4,Tue Jul 21 19:39:54 2015 UTC,"They're still friends though, they are allowed contact, it's when it gets intimate that it gets cringy"
BigBrother,3e3dzp,m1a2c2kali,5,Tue Jul 21 19:52:52 2015 UTC,"One thing I can say in defense of him is he doesn't see it through the cameras perspective like we do, so when hes spooning her like in this picture and she has a ""ugh"" look on her face... he cant see that kind of stuff, the subtle stuff that we pick up on because were looking at it from multiple different angles from afar. Shes flirty with him too his face and rolls her eyes when he cant see and we expect him to be True Detective about this, lol. Like I said, I can't watch the live feeds as much as some so maybe im not seeing where shes pushing him away or telling him to stop and whatnot."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Sean_Ivity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:24 2015 UTC,"I think that's a fair assessment, and it's understandable for Austin to develop some feelings for Liz, it's just that he takes it too far, imo at least. The rubbing and cuddle arm when it's not reciprocated is sort of a red flag. I could see someone trying it once to see response but he continues to do it over and over again"
BigBrother,3e3dzp,m1a2c2kali,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:14:55 2015 UTC,"You would think he would pick up on it, He also doesn't seem like the sharpest tool in the shed, lol."

BigBrother,3e3dzp,Sean_Ivity,5,Tue Jul 21 20:08:15 2015 UTC,You guys talk so much shit about him but none about her for leading him on. It's as much fault hers as it is his.
BigBrother,3e3dzp,PatientZeroo,6,Tue Jul 21 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"This is worse than Caleb/Amber because Amber made it clear she wasn't interested, yet Liz is reeling him in. This house screws with your emotions and what's happening to Austin isn't a surprise given the situation"
BigBrother,3e3dzp,oshizzles,4,Tue Jul 21 19:40:53 2015 UTC,"When it's a girl it's ""leading him on"". When it's a guy it's ""using"".   If Liz is using him for game, all the more power to her. Guys do it to girls countless times in BB no one bats an eye about it, if Liz wants to play that game (or Shelli or anyone else) I say go for it. All part of the game. Everyone's calling him Caleb (I mean, he's creepy sure) but to be fair to Liz she hasn't complained about anything Austin is doing, so again, I see nothing wrong with it. Its not like she's flirting with him and then going around talking about how he's creeping her out or making her uncomfortable. We're just projecting that from pictures."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Hey_Man_Nice_Shot,6,Tue Jul 21 20:10:23 2015 UTC,It's a game and she's using him. More power to her. We saw what happened with Amber last season.
BigBrother,3e3dzp,TylerPerryComo,9,Tue Jul 21 19:39:49 2015 UTC,"And she can use him, that's fine. But don't talk shit about him like he keeps coming after her when she hasn't done anything to even try and stop it. If she would have shut it down in the beginning I highly doubt he would have keep coming after her like Caleb did Amber."
BigBrother,3e3dzp,PatientZeroo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"He's no Caleb, I mean I have to at least give him the benefit of the doubt that if Liz told him point-blank (and the period) to back off that he would respect that, until proven otherwise. Right?"
BigBrother,3e3dzp,Hey_Man_Nice_Shot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:34 2015 UTC,No idea why Liz is so close to Austin. Its really hurt her social game. I mean on some level its Austin's fault too because he's clearly fallen for her hard but on another level she is really leading him on a lot. This is like an even more amped up Caleb/Amber pairing
BigBrother,3e2r1r,Rokiss1,37,Tue Jul 21 14:43:19 2015 UTC,"Becky made a pizza for her last night / early this morning. She said ""they said she could have food"" or something of the sort when Steve asked about it, but as they did with almost anything related to Audrey last night, they cut away almost immediately.  If she has to take some meds that require her to eat something more substantial than slop and gravy then that's just how it has to be.   edit: James made her an omelette this morning, if anybody cares."
BigBrother,3e2r1r,selkath,20,Tue Jul 21 15:28:01 2015 UTC,"If the meds she is taking require actual food, then there is nothing production can do as the side effects can be horrible. There is a certified registered nurse on staff at all times and he/she made the call to suspend those food restriction rules."
BigBrother,3e2r1r,jordguitar,24,Tue Jul 21 16:50:11 2015 UTC,But slop is actual food. Eating slop with your meds would have the same effect as eating pizza.
BigBrother,3e2r1r,YourWaterloo,7,Tue Jul 21 17:06:39 2015 UTC,You have to get it down your throat first to get that qualification. It is much easier to give them normal food which you will have no problem eating.
BigBrother,3e2r1r,jordguitar,23,Tue Jul 21 17:12:14 2015 UTC,"Sure, but then it comes back to accommodation for comfort rather than medical necessity."

BigBrother,3e2r1r,YourWaterloo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:41 2015 UTC,"Literally everyone in here is guessing. We have no idea what kind of medication she's taken, if any, or whether it requires anything substantial in her stomach besides slop and sponge cake."
BigBrother,3e2r1r,DoesntGetYourJoke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:55 2015 UTC,"This actually isn't necessarily true. I don't work with or know psych meds very well but in many cases SOLID foods are required with meds for the sake of slowing digestion. Eating oatmeal/soup/slop just wont suffice in some cases. I could very well see a doctor saying that the food restriction needs to stop.  I hate when people break the rules too, but when the girl is in the DR for 5.5 hours after hallucinations and panic attacks...it is pretty clear she isn't just looking for an excuse to eat pizza."
BigBrother,3e2r1r,Thereian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:45 2015 UTC,"Oatmeal is full of fibre, and they specifically talk on the feeds about how slow it is to digest. I'd understand if they were on an actually liquid diet, but I really don't think that's the case here."
BigBrother,3e2r1r,YourWaterloo,0,Tue Jul 21 20:52:13 2015 UTC,I hadn't thought of that. Who knows what she takes. I am admittedly very ignorant about trans issues but if she takes hormones on a light stomach I imagine it could wreak havoc on her emotions.
BigBrother,3e2r1r,magikalmuffins,14,Tue Jul 21 17:00:22 2015 UTC,"Speaking from personal experience, taking HRT pills on an empty stomach can cause an upset stomach and some slight dizziness. It wouldn't cause any strong emotional damage."
BigBrother,3e2r1r,dalith911,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:52 2015 UTC,Thank you for the info. This is likely a ploy I guess. Smart play really. I would keep her thinking she had alienated so many how could she win?
BigBrother,3e2r1r,magikalmuffins,10,Tue Jul 21 17:24:19 2015 UTC,"Then she should get her shit together and eat some fucking slop before taking her pills.  The food doesn't have to taste good before she takes her pills, it just has to be in her stomach."
BigBrother,3e2r1r,the_eric,15,Tue Jul 21 19:11:25 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to say that I'm glad she stayed, but she seemed to only show symptoms of not being able to really handle the house in a proper manner once it became clear she was everyone's target this week.  Maybe she has a medical issue for real, but the timing to me seems most important.  Really makes me respect people like Devin who was basically in the same situation and took it like a champ. You could tell towards the end of Devin's stay in the house he learned what he did wrong, and I  feel like he'd do much better a second time around. Somewhat similar to Jesse BB10, who played a much better game in BB11."

BigBrother,3e2r1r,jasonporter,29,Tue Jul 21 15:01:39 2015 UTC,Because I'm sure she's threatening to self evict and it's the only thing production can do to keep her in the game. I'm sure they came to an agreement on what she can and cannot do before her inevitable eviction. Dealing with angry feeders is less of an issue to them than figuring out how to deal with the repercussions of a self-eviction and an impending live show.
BigBrother,3e2r1r,osburnn,8,Tue Jul 21 16:06:11 2015 UTC,Why did they ever get rid of PB&J for this?
BigBrother,3e2r1r,any_fuzzy_animal,6,Tue Jul 21 18:16:42 2015 UTC,im guessing because its more nutritious and less tasty
BigBrother,3e2r1r,eatyourcabbage,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"I'm certain I read this a long time ago - that PB&J just doesn't have enough nutrients for CBS to responsibly (and legally) keep the houseguests from suffering from malnutrition, but they needed something that would be a punishment, so slop was born."

If they're okay with letting HGs disrespect the supposed sanctity of their silly show, then I'm okay with it, too.  As long as I'm entertained, it's whatever. I imagine BB feels about the same."

BigBrother,3e2r1r,richp1180,0,Tue Jul 21 19:05:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think she is ""boo-fucking-hoo"" about losing.

BigBrother,3e2r1r,piggyme,8,Tue Jul 21 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"People are simply expressing their opinion about what they want, and if that want can be summed up in the word ""fairness"" or ""justice"" then stating ""BB is not fair"" doesn't negate those opinions.

BigBrother,3e2r1r,trojanlaker,11,Tue Jul 21 19:25:40 2015 UTC,"Nope. BB will have nothing to use for Thursday's live show if she selfevicts and more importantly, JMac - who is America's darling - will be in danger of being unrightfully booted off too soon.

BigBrother,3e2r1r,thesecondattempt,15,Tue Jul 21 15:34:53 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't boot him. There just wouldn't be any eviction Thursday as Audrey leaving would be that eviction.

Maybe they could (should) do that again. I'm sure with cameras on the houseguests 24/7 they could find 40 or so minutes worth of footage and put together a quality episode - like they did for the first 15 seasons of BB."

BigBrother,3e2r1r,Minia15,10,Tue Jul 21 16:21:29 2015 UTC,Precedent says. There was no further eviction on Chima's week.
BigBrother,3e2r1r,specialopts51,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:30 2015 UTC,"They could, but that would ruin a scheduled double eviction, not to mention it would be a very tight episode on Thursday to air all of this.   Plus when Chima got expelled, they just finished Michele's HoH reign as Chima was the original target. While in Audrey's case it's self-eviction, it would be way more easier to just wrap up Shelli's HoH reign. If Audrey wasn't on the block and self evicts, then maybe. But because she is I think it's a high chance there won't be an eviction."

BigBrother,3e2r1r,Peebf,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:34 2015 UTC,"Her insanity alone could easily fill a 10 minute segment.

BigBrother,3e2r1r,richp1180,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:12 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure she asked to return and production told Sue no. Edit: they may have asked the contestants as well but overall it was still a no and would never happen

BigBrother,3e2r1r,Jotchee,3,Tue Jul 21 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. We don't, and don't need to know her medical history. They definitely are giving her different meds to make her relax, and BB is making the call with their medical staff to allow her to eat real food."

BigBrother,3e2r1r,Wiizel1337,4,Tue Jul 21 19:03:14 2015 UTC,"I think the problem that some of us are having with Audrey is that we saw something very similar from her the last time she found herself in trouble: completely shutting down and getting people to feel sorry for her and bring her food. It's possible that she may have a legitimate, serious reaction to high-stress situations, but it also raises the question of whether she's playing the sympathy card as a strategy (which her DR sessions from last time suggest she might). If it is a strategy, then she shouldn't be allowed to use it to influence production. I do feel bad for her if it's real, but she can't have honestly expected to play this game without having to encounter any socially-anxious situations.  Also, I keep seeing people say stuff like, ""So what? This won't be the first time a HN broke the rule when they knew they were going home."" That's not what happened here. Production made an exception to the rule to allow her to eat regular food. Whether it was the right or wrong thing to do, we should at least be clear that production bending the rule is something different than if she herself had decided that she's going to break the rule on her own."

BigBrother,3e2r1r,xXTheGrapenatorXx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:41 2015 UTC,It's not being a have-not that people are upset about. It's the fact that she can get special treatment. We don't want her to be on slop becuase we don't like her. We want her to be on slop becuase that is the rule and many people before her have had to do it.
BigBrother,3e2r1r,newbynewfie,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:37:30 2015 UTC,"We don't know if BB will punish Audrey for breaking HN rules yet. They haven't been consistent about that stuff in the past, so it's hard to predict. It probably depends on if they want to put a segment about her ""disrespecting the holy integrity of the game"" on the Thursday show.  I think they just want Audrey to do her exit interview and media stuff afterwards, rather than self-evicting and disassociating with the show, so they're going to placate her until then. And if she's negotiating with them on that level, and scoring special treatment, then more power to her."

Thus far, Shelli has proven to be the way better HoH competitor than Clay. She's won 2/3 HoH comps she's played in, and remained HoH twice now.

BigBrother,3e3ggj,crazygoalie39,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:23:31 2015 UTC,agreed. she gives off a crazy fake vibe to me but i think we're in the minority
BigBrother,3e3y8d,Rereoc,4,Tue Jul 21 19:43:48 2015 UTC,production gave them to them
BigBrother,3e3y8d,Rokiss1,2,Tue Jul 21 19:47:35 2015 UTC,I understand that. What I don't is understand is that they aren't allowed white clothing because of the way is reflects or something. So why are these white clothes different
BigBrother,3e3y8d,Rokiss1,2,Tue Jul 21 20:03:34 2015 UTC,fewer scenes for them to make sure the reflection isn't distracting. Plus you're not supposed to wear white after labor day.
BigBrother,3e3y8d,chaz_batch,3,Tue Jul 21 20:06:07 2015 UTC,"They arent white, they are cream colored but appear white on camera."

BigBrother,3e083j,fatherofthesun,34,Mon Jul 20 23:58:53 2015 UTC,The question of the century. Either a tamagotchi or a gameboy pocket with pokemon red (90s week).
BigBrother,3e083j,genniside538,74,Mon Jul 20 23:52:34 2015 UTC,It's time for America's Vote!  Who should Audrey pick as her starter Pokemon?  Text 1 for Bulbasaur  Text 2 for Charmander  And text 3 for Squirtle
BigBrother,3e083j,trinitymonkey,20,Tue Jul 21 00:41:43 2015 UTC,"For the average Pokemon player: I've texted 2 for Charmander. Harder the first two gyms, sets you up for success the rest of the game.  For Audrey, who likes to come out and play as strong as possible only to realize that her strategy fails miserably in the think of the game: I've texted 1 for Bulbasaur. Good luck Audrey.  Don't know who's going to protect you in the Final/Elite Four."
BigBrother,3e083j,helarco,2,Tue Jul 21 00:43:43 2015 UTC,Good luck Audrey. Don't know who's going to protect you in the Final/Elite Four.   Audrey doesn't seem like the type of player who would stick with her starter pokemon...loyalty isn't really her thing.
BigBrother,3e083j,sentrifice,4,Tue Jul 21 13:47:18 2015 UTC,4 for Pikachu.  Pokemon Yellow all the way!

BigBrother,3e083j,strangerkindness,2,Tue Jul 21 00:45:47 2015 UTC,I think all medicines are held by the producers and then its dispensed out in the DR at the correct times (mornings usually).
BigBrother,3e083j,popandvodka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:01:05 2015 UTC,She said she was taking estrogen so that could be what it is

BigBrother,3e083j,ajoariz,14,Tue Jul 21 06:40:10 2015 UTC,"Part of me wanted her not to come back. But honestly I am glad she's back so she doesn't potentially mess up Liz, Jason, or Johnny Mac's game. I wonder what they had to do to convince her to stay."
BigBrother,3e083j,dawnhu,25,Mon Jul 20 23:26:16 2015 UTC,Maybe they reminded her of the 3 grand she would lose walking out.
BigBrother,3e083j,kecker,7,Mon Jul 20 23:52:55 2015 UTC,i think that is the ticket
BigBrother,3e083j,kecker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:19 2015 UTC,Sure they did but she is not the regular person looking to self evict.
BigBrother,3e083j,kecker,8,Mon Jul 20 23:55:58 2015 UTC,there was a therapist in there talking to her too
BigBrother,3e083j,TheQuassitworsh,6,Tue Jul 21 01:55:06 2015 UTC,"The contact that they signed stipulates an amount per week that they will earn as houseguests and what they will make in Jury House. It also says that production can agree to make additional financial agreements at their sole discretion. If Audrey self-evicts, it really screws Big Brother because they have a live show to produce on Thursday. I assume that they threatened her with forfeiting her stipend and also offered her more to stay until Thursday."
BigBrother,3e083j,cordkiller,2,Tue Jul 21 04:55:25 2015 UTC,"but she now might mess up Jmac's game-people in the house might now vote for her to stay out of sympathy...Pretend that they are both campaining-Jmac willing to go on the block for Shelli and Clay  any week other than this week might get him a feeling guilty vote from Shelli and her crew, but mental instability/sympathy might sway Shelli more on Audreys side-dang it don't want to see jmac go home yet.."
BigBrother,3e083j,TheQuassitworsh,5,Tue Jul 21 06:36:33 2015 UTC,"No I think everyone is in agreement that she's a hot mess and the best thing for her, is for her to go home.  It's obvious she can't handle the pressure cooker that is the BB House and it would be an act of mercy to evict her ASAP."
BigBrother,3e083j,cordkiller,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:40 2015 UTC,yeah if she hadn't come back it could have harmed someone else.  I wanted her to not come back to fuck with production for all their bullshit. Now they don't have to talk about any of this.   If she'd left they'd have had to do a declaration.  Plus Aud might be the kind of person to spill a lot of details.
BigBrother,3e083j,kecker,2,Mon Jul 20 23:53:59 2015 UTC,"Actually they kind of do have to talk about it.  She skipped the POV ceremony.  Which with fancy editing they probably could have worked around, except that she was the replacement nomination so....well, it's hard to hide that."
BigBrother,3e083j,limerences,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:15 2015 UTC,"Less intense press interest. They can gloss over it and not deal with anything substantive.  For instance ""Audrey missed the POV ceremony because of a health issue""  vs  Whatever they would have had to say about why she ended up leaving the show and game permanently."
BigBrother,3e083j,limerences,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:29 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  Probably the way it'll be handled.
BigBrother,3e083j,limerences,6,Tue Jul 21 15:20:58 2015 UTC,What happened to Audrey? I keep hearing everyone on this sub talking about her but I don't even know what happened with her.
BigBrother,3e083j,_disguised_toast_,12,Tue Jul 21 01:27:11 2015 UTC,she holed up in DR for 5 hrs delayed veto ceremony when it started she was a no- show but was nominated anyway
BigBrother,3e083j,RegularGuy815,2,Tue Jul 21 01:56:11 2015 UTC,Any reason for that? She seems to be experiencing a lot of anxiety problems.
BigBrother,3e083j,chaz_batch,7,Tue Jul 21 02:04:45 2015 UTC,I understand she is really upset because she knew she was a backdoor target
BigBrother,3e083j,cordkiller,3,Tue Jul 21 02:10:39 2015 UTC,"She had a breakdown earlier where she was in the DR for 4 hours.  Then this most recent 5 hour stint.  In between fish, houseguests seem to be aware that she was having some sort of chemical or hormonal imbalance issues which was causing her to hear voices and have hallucinations."
BigBrother,3e083j,SoButtscrewed,0,Tue Jul 21 13:05:51 2015 UTC,I wanted her to not come back   Implying she ever left the house.. Where are you getting this information from?
BigBrother,3e083j,brightbase,3,Tue Jul 21 14:49:31 2015 UTC,I am implying no such thing.  Coming back into the house part of the complex where they film the show.
BigBrother,3e083j,SoButtscrewed,0,Tue Jul 21 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it's really confusing the way you worded that post.    yeah if she hadn't come back it could have harmed someone else.   Like this.. Where else would she have gone? She has to go back into the house where they film the show."
BigBrother,3e083j,brightbase,3,Tue Jul 21 15:07:33 2015 UTC,Are you clear about what I am saying yet?  She could have been taken to a health care or mental health facility.
BigBrother,3e083j,SoButtscrewed,0,Tue Jul 21 15:08:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, didn't know they allowed that. I figured you're out of the game if you have to leave for something like that."
BigBrother,3e083j,brightbase,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:33 2015 UTC,No it's actually happened.  One season within moments of each other one player had a severe allergic reaction and then another passed out from not consuming enough calories as a have not. Both were taken to a health care facility. Both returned to play some more.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69zMpy96G6w

Since it was not game related at all, there was no time for it on the week it happened.

BigBrother,3dzslf,cruncheweesy,14,Tue Jul 21 03:14:45 2015 UTC,they have a habit of altering the timeline and making it seem like events happened after they actually did. for example the audrey/day fight in the have not room happened before jace's eviction but wasn't aired until after. since jeff was already evicted they erased him from the clip so it could fit into the timeline of it happening after his eviction.  i did think it's funny though that you can see his legs under the covers and in a couple different angles you could see his body but his head was cropped out.
BigBrother,3dzslf,Megatron_Griffin,11,Tue Jul 21 00:42:29 2015 UTC,They should've erased that musical number they did...

BigBrother,3dzjd3,FieryFemme,23,Mon Jul 20 20:20:27 2015 UTC,Just a personal anecdote about The Backstreet Boys. I used to work at a pop radio station in a large market and we had them come and interview for the show I was producing. They were such a delight! They came in with the  best attitudes and were just total bros (not the Jace kind). AJ was answering the request line and chatting with fans who didn't believe it was really him.. They hungout with  staff members way after the interview was over. You could tell that they were generally awesome and chill dudes and not just as a persona.  10/10 would interview/hangout/party with the BSB!

But I don't know how they would do that with Big Brother. UnReal's plot focuses in the interaction between production and the contestants, and how they manipulate it to look good on tv.

BigBrother,3e145u,Grungemaster,4,Tue Jul 21 06:03:41 2015 UTC,"This is a series of parodies and impersonations he does about the houseguests each season. He did a short recap of his season and has done seasons 15, 16, and 17 in an episode format. The humor is largely dependent on if you get the references and inside jokes. I can see how it would just look weird without the right context."

BigBrother,3e0cgf,AllAmericanScoutTeam,47,Mon Jul 20 23:54:09 2015 UTC,"The short answer: Frankie from last year. TERRIBLE on the feeds. Terrible on the show, but less terrible due to the edit production gave him."
BigBrother,3e0cgf,fatherofthesun,5,Mon Jul 20 23:54:46 2015 UTC,I'll have to go back and watch last years. I could barely stand him on the episodes so I'm curious to see how he was on the live feeds
BigBrother,3e0cgf,19midgets,10,Mon Jul 20 23:56:06 2015 UTC,"This was actually answered a couple of days ago. Don't worry, I got you covered"
BigBrother,3e0cgf,genniside538,5,Tue Jul 21 00:54:31 2015 UTC,"You should check out how Frankie treated Nicole after Hayden's double-eviction where she was blindsided. He was vicious. He called her stupid. Told her everything that happened to her was her own fault for being a dumb bitch. And he wouldn't let it go. And she wasn't doing anything besides trying to hangout and act normal after her game was blown up. It was wicked pathetic on his part because he was bullying her solely because she was alone in that moment in time. It became very evident after this, that Frankie is a misogynist. He hates women for getting the attention he wants from men, and you can see it in his HOH noms and the names he throws out for evictions:  Sold out Joey  Turned the house against Britney  Started all the lies about Amber  Pushed Zach to blow up on Amber  Bullies Nicole  and he turns on Christine"
BigBrother,3e0cgf,YoBannannaGirl,3,Tue Jul 21 13:57:26 2015 UTC,"This is why you have to keep things in perspective when you watch the live feeds then the episodes. They aren't going to show you every horrible thing a houseguest does in the house. They are going to give houseguest you hate a ""nice"" edit. People complained all the time hoe Frankie was Productions Pet, and how nice of an edit he was getting, yet you, and many other non-feed watchers still found him annoying. They don't show everything, and it will seem like too much is being left out, but the editors still usually show someone's true character, even if it is a slightly watered down version."
BigBrother,3e0cgf,gladius75,21,Tue Jul 21 05:13:01 2015 UTC,The moment that caused me to keep buying the feeds every year was when Chima had a meltdown over Jeff's special power. She went ballistic and got herself evicted. Watching that play out that night during my free trial was pretty awesome.
BigBrother,3e0cgf,bmputz,17,Tue Jul 21 01:22:36 2015 UTC,I watched the feeds that night for the first time and it was amazing. With Lydia and crew sitting around  the table crying like someone died. I was laughing so hard. It is just a game.

I liked her in most of the episodes, up until the last few, although I absolutely couldn't stand Shane. Why is it that most people here seem to hate her? I've seen lots of people call her a pathological liar and crazy, but she never appeared this way on the show. Any explanation?"

BigBrother,3e0cgf,Chexoh,16,Tue Jul 21 15:40:37 2015 UTC,Frankie Grande got such a good edit compared to his true character. He's a huge example of this.
BigBrother,3e0cgf,2muchtaurine,4,Tue Jul 21 00:48:12 2015 UTC,I agree 100% with last post. Frankie WOW! Didn't realize is until Jason this year was throwing shots at him. Then I found a video on YouTube to sum it up. And the best was watching Frankies face when he was not even in top 3 for being americas favourite.
BigBrother,3e0cgf,Chexoh,7,Tue Jul 21 08:08:36 2015 UTC,Frankie's complete shock and devastation at not being top 3 was the single greatest moment of season 16 for me. Absolutely hysterical.

BigBrother,3e0cgf,CadillacOn22s,6,Tue Jul 21 02:59:59 2015 UTC,The only one I can think of was the competition from BB15 where a jury member got to re-enter the house and in this video you can see someone either pushing Helen down or signalling her to jump off by tapping on her foot. I think it's the latter. They don't show comps on the live feeds anymore though.  Edit: Forgot to put video link.
BigBrother,3e0cgf,I_cant_speel,10,Tue Jul 21 03:30:35 2015 UTC,They still show the HoH endurance comps on the feeds.

BigBrother,3e3hb2,Rokiss1,3,Tue Jul 21 17:53:09 2015 UTC,BBleak has been getting bombarded with a lot of people being particularly nasty and has been blocking a lot of people. You probably were accidentally blocked in the most of that.
BigBrother,3e3hb2,Ihatey,3,Tue Jul 21 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is a prime example of the state of America right now though. You don't agree and validate my opinion? You're hateful, intolerant, insensitive, ignorant, etc. This isn't me taking a side on any issues, BB related or otherwise, it's just an observation. Though I do agree, Audrey is definitely not being bullied and certainly not being treated any worse than any other contestants on the history of this show. Sometimes those screaming tolerance the loudest are the least tolerant."

BigBrother,3e3hb2,branhoo88,3,Tue Jul 21 19:43:12 2015 UTC,"BBleak is terrible relative to other live feed update twitter pages. They just happen to have the most followers because they were one of the first to start doing live feed twitter updates. They're extremely biased against certain players and tend to word quote tweets in a way that makes the contestant look bad. They did this a lot more in BB15 but they still do it nonetheless.  For example: https://twitter.com/BigBrotherLeak/status/623319319787773952  They will post this and only this to try and make Austin and Liz look bad, while another BB site (like Jokers updates) will post full chat logs of the conversation. So I only really look at Jokers now even though the updates aren't as frequent as they used to be."
BigBrother,3e3hb2,CoronIsland,3,Tue Jul 21 20:24:10 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong, but anyone can block you on Twitter if they choose to.   But yes, you're certainly entitled to your opinion, and I'm sure many others feel the same way."
BigBrother,3dznlu,LuongosSoulPatch,111,Mon Jul 20 20:47:51 2015 UTC,"Yesterday Audrey was outed for like the 6th time as a liar. All started with an argument that started with Clay in the backyard. Eventually moved up into HOH with Clay, Shelli and Vanessa.  Audrey then outed their alliance with Austin/Liz/Vanessa to James and Jackie (No one believes her). James told Clay about it and the house had a meeting without Audrey to say that they would band together to evict her in a backdoor this week, but still be nice to her.  Audrey had a full on breakdown last night in Vanessa's bed (as a have not) and spent like 3 hours in the DR.  This morning they pushed back the veto meeting due to ""sound issues"", but it's likely because Audrey has been in DR for like 4 hours. Speculation that she's trying to self evict. That's where we are now.  Edit: Thanks for the gold homie /u/LuongosSoulPatch P.S. Go Caps"

BigBrother,3dznlu,xohl,4,Tue Jul 21 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, I'm trans.  Still don't think the ""panic attack"" was real. It was either stress from knowing she's going on the block and she made a huge deal of it or fake because she was wrapping herself in blankets and when you have a panic attack it feels like you're suffocating, so wrapping herself in blankets would send her into absolute panic, no one would do that if they were having a panic attack."

Panic attacks are different for everyone, first of all. But I don't mean I think she was having a panic attack, i meant more like a depressive episode. Like yesterday, for me, absolutely nothing actually bad was happening but I couldn't pick what to eat and I ended up curling up on my bed and crying because i was like ""i'm so worthless i can't even make myself a damn meal i'm so terrible yada yada yada"" and being in such a bad position in the house and being so honestly terribad at playing the game when she was so confident before could've triggered a bad day mental-health-wise."

BigBrother,3e0ij5,NotThatHillary-,12,Tue Jul 21 14:57:24 2015 UTC,YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT PRODUCTION
BigBrother,3e0ij5,hammy1227,7,Tue Jul 21 04:44:45 2015 UTC,"pre-show sequester is in a hotel. every houseguest has a handler, they aren't allowed to leave the room without that handler. iirc they're allowed an hour of gym time every day, otherwise they have to hang out in their room the whole time. they're given old movies/past seasons of bb to watch and thats about it. a lot of hgs become close with their handlers in that time since it's basically the only interaction they get. it's also common for hgs to see other hgs around but they aren't allowed to talk/even make eye contact with them."
BigBrother,3e1to6,Chexoh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:33:31 2015 UTC,Is it a work VPN? Does it have a firewall? Is the live feed region locked to a different region than the VPN?
BigBrother,3e1to6,AndyH13,0,Tue Jul 21 16:10:37 2015 UTC,That I don't know :( I wish I knew all of that. Its just a basic VPN connected to my browser extensions. Have you seen this before?
BigBrother,3e1to6,AndyH13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen it before, those are just some basic issues that might cause it (it may be completely unrelated). Why can't you turn the VPN off?"
BigBrother,3e1to6,chaos36,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:30 2015 UTC,"I don't have live feeds, so am only guessing here.  Is your VPN server in another country that live feeds are blocked in?  For instance, does the VPN give you an IP address that makes it appear as if you are in Asia?  That is just a guess though.  If do, do you have access to any of the VPN settings or account, maybe pick a server in a different country?  You said out is connected to your browser settings....can you use a different browser?"
BigBrother,3e0swa,SwaggyLord17,16,Tue Jul 21 02:07:56 2015 UTC,Because people are human. The more you lie the more suspicious you are that other people are lying. They say the best indicator that your partner is cheating on you is if they accuse YOU of cheating on THEM. it's human nature.
BigBrother,3e0swa,maxdrive,12,Tue Jul 21 03:06:03 2015 UTC,I don't think they have a huge issue about lying. I think its more of an excuse to make liars seem like a target. Its just a strategy to focus attention on someone else by blowing shit out of proportion constantly.
BigBrother,3e0swa,synergyschnitzel,3,Tue Jul 21 04:20:18 2015 UTC,"For the most part I agree with this. Like for instance, when Austin blew up Jeff for his lying, it gave Vanessa the perfect reason to put him on the block and send him home. Naturally, she had to make it seem like she was extremely upset about it."
BigBrother,3e0swa,Dk-devilkid,11,Tue Jul 21 06:29:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like this season in particular they're being overly sensitive on this. Everyone seems so offended by every game-move other ppl are doing (if they aren't ""in"" on it)."

BigBrother,3e0swa,Novh,5,Tue Jul 21 03:22:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, this season has been pretty sensitive when it comes to lying. I felt like Vanessa was about to rip Audrey to shreds when she found out all these ""lies"" that were spread about her. Then she started saying it was really telling of her personality. Really? Now you are saying someone is a bad person because they lied in a game where lying is (sometimes) a key strategy? And its not like Vanessa herself hasn't lied before. I don't know, I just feel like everyone in this cast takes everything so personal. Just my two cents though."
BigBrother,3e0swa,Angel_Echelon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:01:08 2015 UTC,Completely agree
BigBrother,3e0swa,newbynewfie,5,Tue Jul 21 13:37:16 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. And on the same note, I hate it when a house guest doesn't vote with the house, then the whole house loses their shit because someone didn't vote the way they thought they should. Hey guess what, your target was still evicted, get over it.   For the past couple of seasons every eviction was unanimous (or almost), and it kind of sucked. I'm glad people are starting to actually vote the way they want to, instead of the way the HOH wants them to."
BigBrother,3e0swa,predpilot85,2,Tue Jul 21 06:55:04 2015 UTC,"It's because being lied to is an easy reason to target the person that lied to you. Everyone knows that everyone lies, but if you catch someone lying to you, you have 'empirical' evidence you can point to for why you can't trust them.  Then it's also played up even more if you're looking for an excuse to nominate someone (like we saw with Vanessa and Jeff). She didn't want it to look like her alliance was attacking the other side and didn't want to be seen as a strategist, so she was able to use the excuse of Jeff having lied to her to try to cover up the other reasons."
BigBrother,3e0swa,AvidStrategy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:52 2015 UTC,"Audrey is just a really really bad liar. If someone kept pulling the same shit over and over and getting caught and horribly trying to back track, I'd probably flip at them too lol"

BigBrother,3dy36i,DoesntGetYourJoke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:57 2015 UTC,How was she trying to screw them by saying Audrey was the target though? Thats whats raising Shelli's suspicion and I don't really get it.

Back when Austin confronted Jeff in the bathroom to artificially create that argument, and he goes ""You throwin me under the bus bro??

Jackie brought it up in the house meeting  how phony and calculated that confrontation was last night and everyone just laughed it off."
BigBrother,3dy36i,bookworm0901,4,Tue Jul 21 01:55:33 2015 UTC,"I think at that time, no one knew that Austin and Clay were in an alliance together which may be why no one figured it out."

BigBrother,3dy86z,Pangs,21,Mon Jul 20 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"You all simply underestimate the tingles Jeff created when he smooched her under the covers. Liz voted with her heart, not her brain, get over it."
BigBrother,3dy86z,ClassicClassicOOf,5,Mon Jul 20 17:46:38 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.   But also, based on her DR of that vote and what I've heard Becky say to Shelli, was that LIZ preferred Jeff to stay because she liked him more than Austin. She enjoyed his company and during Jeff's time on the block he kept pulling her aside and saying he liked her and would protect her. I think she thought Jeff would help her game out more than James. Which is true. It was somewhat strategy and somewhat personal.   It was a good move on her part if she actually helped flip the house. Plus, the only person that thinks it was Liz that voted is Becky who kind of convinced Shelli  or at least put the seeds in her head. But most of the SS alliance think Becky was that vote."
BigBrother,3dy86z,phd_trand,3,Mon Jul 20 18:56:07 2015 UTC,Jeff never kissed her. He has been asked post eviction and said it was just cuddle/tickle sessions
BigBrother,3dy86z,chasingdasun,4,Mon Jul 20 18:48:41 2015 UTC,oh please. they never kissed. these two girls know how to flirt and work guys over to get what they want. liz learned early on that she could work jeff easily and saw the advantage of having another puppet on a string. neither twin wants any of the HGs. they love the attention and worship NOT the guys giving it to them.

Jeff is the type of guy who can tell a party-girl like Liz what she wants to hear, all the way into his bed.... Then dump her afterwards with no remorse.  Jeff is the type of guy you don't trust around your girlfriend. In a moment of weakness, he'll take whatever he can get with no regard for others.  I do not carry myself this way, but have been around enough ""players"" to spot it in others. He DEFINITELY stole a kiss under those covers."
BigBrother,3dy86z,ClassicClassicOOf,6,Mon Jul 20 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"well to give you some insight, i grew up in the miami party scene and worked in it for years as well. i've seen the twins in action before, and i've known literally hundreds of girls like them. the twins (more-so liz) are working the greatest power they know and have no intention of hooking up with any of those guys. look at jeff and austin as two club promoters that can hook them up with free entry and alcohol. you have one that is sexist and wants to bang you but he's also kind of funny and he won't fall in love with you. you have another that not only wants to bang you, but has a girlfriend and is showing signs of catching feelings and touches you lovingly all the time. now, you might keep flirting with both promoters because you want to make sure you always have the hook up no matter what night it is. you may even flirt with the no-commitment one more than the other because you know it's safe and you like the attention. but the mistake that a LOT of miami guys make (well, guys all over the world if we're being honest) is assuming that the girl in this equation is interested in anything more than what the guy can do for them."

BigBrother,3dy86z,SubmittedToDigg,8,Mon Jul 20 16:40:19 2015 UTC,I don't. I think it's just very clear that no one in the house likes her. Without SS's protection she'd have been gone easily.

BigBrother,3dy86z,Joemoose13,3,Mon Jul 20 16:14:50 2015 UTC,"Not really. Yes she said she had a better connection with Jeff but who votes based on that? Of the two nominees, Jeff was the biggest threat to her game. He was actively trying to find solid evidence of a twin twist to out Liz and Julia. So even though she liked to flirt with him, it was a bad move.   However, if she knew her vote wouldn't make a difference and he would still go home but it would cause chaos in the house, then it was a good, strategic move."
BigBrother,3dy86z,bookworm0901,11,Mon Jul 20 16:36:41 2015 UTC,"Think about it from her perspective, though. For her ""better connection"" refers to knowing what they're thinking. Jeff is incredibly obvious about what he's thinking, and generally revealed it all to Liz (purposely or not) while she didn't have anything close to that with James. She doesn't know if James is out to get her or not, and she can't control James the way she can control Jeff. She didn't flirt with Jeff because it was fun and stuff, she's flirting with all these guys because it gives her control over them and it makes them want to keep her in the house longer because they think they're going to get laid. Jeff and Austin aren't so much allies to her than tools that she's holding on to by the penis. When she says she didn't have as much of a connection with James, she means that she couldn't control him with flirtation the way she could control Jeff."

BigBrother,3dy86z,Emma__I,8,Mon Jul 20 22:22:57 2015 UTC,"I was surprised she told Julia the truth. If Julia thought Liz voted to evict Jeff, Liz wouldn't have to worry about Julia accidentally telling the truth about the odd vote."

BigBrother,3dy86z,richp1180,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:51:07 2015 UTC,"I thought this was a bad move as well.  I was (pleasantly) surprised that Liz already started playing as an individual by voting against James, but she sort of ruined it when she felt like she needed to share with Julia. They need to remember that when they both enter the house they will be playing as two separate players, regardless of them playing as one player for so long."
BigBrother,3dy86z,Emma__I,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:18 2015 UTC,"being twins, i'm sure julia is used to covering up for liz's lapse in judgement by now. this probably isn't the first time she's seen her make a bad decision that could affect both of them."
BigBrother,3dy86z,chasingdasun,5,Mon Jul 20 22:15:44 2015 UTC,"even though it seems pretty clear that Liz had no strategy behind voting against James besides for her own personal game, it played out to be a pretty good game move.   ha yep I'm surprised Liz didn't lie in the DR and just say 'I wanted to create another distraction for the house'. But it ended up being a good move bc Austin would never push or suspect her and it could be the little thing that unites sixth sense for one more week till her sister comes in  Also while Liz and the Twins have been somewhat calm and smart players in the house, the vote was a direct reaction to Liz not liking Austin thinking he can control her so I really want both twins in the house, it could get fun"
BigBrother,3dy86z,arthur1064,6,Mon Jul 20 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"Liz definitively showed that she had a head that thinks about her game before the alliance! She would backstab anyone for the win, way funnier to watch than alliances that stick together."

BigBrother,3dy86z,SBLK,11,Mon Jul 20 19:38:54 2015 UTC,"I have a big problem with dumb gameplay as a result of somebody not understanding the game. Liz's vote was absolutely the result of her being a recruit, not really understanding the game, and not thinking at all about what her vote would do.  Now, had she said, ""I voted for James to create some paranoia...,"" I would give her props, but that wasn't the case. She voted for James because she, ""liked Jeff more than James."" This is why fans of the show hate recruits. It isn't hard to find a set of somewhat attractive twins that have actually watched the show (before a one week cram session before they enter), but producers find it necessary to give someone who is clearly just a fame-seeker the chance that tens of thousands of people apply for year after year and would die for."
BigBrother,3dy86z,YourWaterloo,19,Mon Jul 20 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"Really? Most fans of the show seem to hate people just ""voting with the house"", so I'd think they'd appreciate someone going a bit rogue and voting for who they actually want to stay.  Personally I love it. I mean, it's obviously not a game-winning move, but I'd rather this sort of thing than a house full of boring superfans who are terrified of making waves."
BigBrother,3dy86z,leaveitintherearview,3,Mon Jul 20 17:32:23 2015 UTC,The point is that it was a thoughtless move that made no sense and could have gotten her in trouble but instead she got lucky with the result. It's not the same scenario as what you're saying. Op is upset because Liz doesn't even understand the fundamentals of the game and isn't smart enough to pick up on them apparently. She got lucky the vote didn't backfire.
BigBrother,3dy86z,Pangs,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the move was thoughtless.  Just that it wasn't a good thought and very short-sighted.

BigBrother,3dy86z,leaveitintherearview,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:47:24 2015 UTC,"When big brother fans are discussing their contempt for unanimous votes it has to do with the frustration that there is a lack of fighting on one side. One side controlling the rest, much like the sixth sense is running the show now. That bores people.   They aren't talking about wanting rogue votes that don't make any sense within their own alliance. Liz' vote was literally retarded. Had it succeeded in keeping Jeff somehow, she would have blown up her alliance and fucked her entire game up. They likely woulda had many discussions to see who didn't vote Jeff out and narrow Liz down as the culprit. That would have fucked her game up completely. In Liz' case specifically. Her alliance holds her game changing secret.   So people are interested in a battle, two sides fighting, not someone within their own alliance making a thoughtless play that would fuck up her game had it actually worked.   Basically people are interested in people fighting to keep their allies/friends in the house instead of going with the controlling interest. Not the people who are in the controlling alliance to make weird votes that could fuck their own game up.  You seem to understand that people find unanimous votes boring, but you don't seem to understand why. We like ballsy and smart game play. Not random dumb game play."
BigBrother,3dy86z,YourWaterloo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:03:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's what some fans want, but a lot of others just want some chaos! Myself included. It's why people liked Zach so much last year - he made weird, nonsensical, hilarious moves, the fallout of which was super entertaining. He's short-lived reign as HoH was glorious, not because of the gameplay but because it stressed the rest of the house out so much. I don't give a shit whether the move ends up hurting Liz or not (although I don't think Jeff staying would have hurt her). I have no investment in the outcome of these people's games, I have an investment of the level of entertainment on the feeds. Literally, because I paid for them."

I think that from the widespread embrace of characters like Zach it's obvious that I don't stand alone. I was just trying to offer a different perspective from ""all fans hate bad gameplay"". By no means do you have to be one of the fans that enjoy chaos!"
BigBrother,3dy86z,SBLK,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"My comment, which is perfectly depicted by Liz's vote, can essentially be boiled down to, 'I hate bad gameplay by undeserving HG's that do not understand the game.'  I understand the need for a little chaos, but if you extrapolate out the idea of dumb gameplay for need of chaos, you are left with a game that makes no sense and might as well be The Kardashians. You say that this is what 'many fans' want. I disagree. I highly doubt anyone would watch BB if it was just a bunch of mindless HG's doing shit to cause chaos.  /u/leaveintherearview was right - I don't like unanimous decisions either, but they are oftentimes the result of the state of the game, and because everyone is doing the 'smart' thing for their game. That doesn't mean we want people to just start playing dumb and doing stupid shit to blow up their own game. Liz's vote would have been great had it not been the exact OPPOSITE of what was good for her game, or she had any excuse for it other than, ""Ohhh I like him..."""
BigBrother,3dy86z,YourWaterloo,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:54 2015 UTC,"This is a pointless argument - neither of us can speak for what the fans as a whole like best. It's clear that some like foolish chaos based on their love of houseguests like Zach, and it's also clear that some like players that stick with very logical gameplay. Claiming to know the fan consensus is just silly.  So all in all, it's nice that there are options :)"

If it was just that she liked Jeff more than maybe ----- but the important thing was Jeff liked her more than James did. Its a powerful tool as if Jeff were to have any game effecting decisions (VETO, HoH, etc..) he would be much more likely to use them in a way that doesn't hurt liz even if she isn't in his alliance.    She's not talking about and as such there is no backlash for her. Too often somebody votes against there alliance, and then goes on a witchhunt and implicates themself."

BigBrother,3e1g0j,PNW_thanksforasking,7,Tue Jul 21 05:41:47 2015 UTC,"lol I can only imagine..  He'd probably would have to work harder this season, dealing with strategists (Vanessa, Jeff, Shelli), comp beasts (Becky, Johnny Mac), dynamic personalities (Audrey, Day, Jason, Austin, Jace), and wishy-washy people (Steve, Jackie) in order to at least make jury.  Last season were full of goats and obvious pre-jury targets that he was handed the win.  He wouldn't survive in this season."

BigBrother,3e1g0j,cereal18,10,Tue Jul 21 15:01:31 2015 UTC,Derrick would be in the final 3 with Clay and Jackie instead of Cody and Victoria

BigBrother,3dy0fj,Sanity0004,31,Mon Jul 20 13:41:11 2015 UTC,I'd guess Donnie Wahlberg fell through.  Early 90's boy band star and easy CBS cross promotion with Blue Bloods.

BigBrother,3dy0fj,Thlowe,11,Mon Jul 20 15:51:40 2015 UTC,The BB Twitter did specifically mention Kid from Kid n Play to appear on the show last Thursday and nothing came of it.
BigBrother,3dy0fj,SPilgrim7,10,Mon Jul 20 17:43:13 2015 UTC,"It does seem weird that there was just absolutely no mention of it, or the fact that the takeovers were done. I think maybe production already has their hands full trying to fit all the gameplay/strategy into the limited time they have so they just dropped them, but that doesn't explain why they have yet to mention it..."
BigBrother,3dy0fj,SBLK,12,Mon Jul 20 16:32:06 2015 UTC,"Hands full? No offense, but this show runs like a well-oiled machine as far as what to expect each episode.

BigBrother,3e2nx6,Aqua-Tech,6,Tue Jul 21 14:18:24 2015 UTC,"Agree with this post. Audrey is literally nothing right now. No one is going to take her word for anything, and at best she can be swayed to be a single vote on someone's side. She isn't going to win competitions and can't make any major game moves. Voting to evict her over someone like JMac (as much as I love him) is playing with your heart and emotions, something most people look down on in this subreddit."
BigBrother,3e2nx6,Gurnlei,3,Tue Jul 21 15:50:28 2015 UTC,"The reason they'd vote to evict her is because she's bringing too much drama and chaos to the house. Yeah, it makes for good TV, but Audrey is becoming unbearable to work and live with. If this were the business world, she'd be fired for her attitude and her inability to work with anyone."
BigBrother,3e2nx6,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,5,Tue Jul 21 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"Of course all of that is right, but in BB preserving the major targets keeps heat off you. As unbearable as it is, I'd still evict the comp threat and keep the person everyone hates around as long as I could. As long as Audrey is in the house she is everyone's major target."
BigBrother,3e2nx6,Rokiss1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:31 2015 UTC,So youre the kind of HG that would have voted out caleb when he was on the block next to devin
BigBrother,3e2nx6,Rokiss1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:16 2015 UTC,"Well, attempt to rally things that way, yes. If you meet resistance it may be beneficial to vote with the house. Every situation is different, though, I don't think past precident is tmreally that important when you're in the house and have a decision to make. Keeping Audrey is good BB strategy, regardless of how awful she is."
BigBrother,3e2nx6,hieress,0,Tue Jul 21 14:55:55 2015 UTC,"Not if shes throwing anyone she gets close to under the bus... like she did with Day, Jason, Vanessa, Clay, Shelli.. She can do more damage to their games with every additional week she stays"
BigBrother,3e2nx6,Peebf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:59 2015 UTC,"Those people should be smart enough now not to give her any ammunition. Honestly, this is BB 101 to me. A vote to evict Audrey is an emotional knee-jerk reaction IMO. The longer she is in the house the safer everyone else is statistically."
BigBrother,3e2nx6,Rokiss1,2,Tue Jul 21 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"Except everyone very clearly wants her out of the house. This is more in line with the HOH putting her on the block, but if you consistently refuse to send a person like Audrey home it doesn't look good on you. Take it beyond BB101 - sometimes you have to yield to the wishes of the house in the name of self preservation."
BigBrother,3e2nx6,Rokiss1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:18 2015 UTC,"The house should know Keeping Audrey is beneficial to them. Some already do and have made that clear. I'm not saying I'd be the lone dessentor, but I would definitely be pushing the idea to people I'm close with as it is the best move for everyone really."
BigBrother,3e2nx6,Narninian,0,Tue Jul 21 15:25:54 2015 UTC,Except the houseguests aren't emotionless money hungry androids and have crescended beyond pure game-related annoyance to very base-level concern and/or irritation. Clay and Jason are fed up with her on a personal level and the rest of the HGs know that spending another week in the House would prove disastrous for Audrey's mental health. She's not cut out for the game. Both the smartest and the most respectful thing to do is just cut out the dead weight and move forward.
BigBrother,3e2nx6,HowDo_I_TurnThisOn,0,Tue Jul 21 15:31:32 2015 UTC,"Look, I like Johnny Mac, and I'm rooting for him, but he's a comp threat and eveyone likes him. He is obviously in a much better position than Audrey to eventually win this game. He is a more dangerous player. A vote to evict Audrey is emotional, knee jerk, and just because they don't like her. Poor BB players vote emotionally. You so what's best for your game, not what's best for the house and not what will make life easier/less drama-filled/what is easiest.  I guess it takes a certain type of person to get past the fact that you may not like someone and realize keeping them around is beneficial to you. Those are the kinds of players who win BB."
BigBrother,3e1riw,dawnhu,3,Tue Jul 21 08:02:41 2015 UTC,Truth is no one really knows.  Even the house guests are kinda confused.  Right now the plan is Audrey.  Anything can happen over the next few days.

BBUS has been getting longer and longer so they can schedule the evitions more accordingly and even have time to bring someone back where BBCan tries to bring people back at the expense of having a triple eviction as we saw last season.

Steve also has the SOS Alliance with Vanessa, though I'm not sure how loyal either actually are to that one.  Steve was also part of an alliance with Liz/Julia, Austin and Vanessa called Freaks and Geeks I think, but that one hasn't really gone anywhere either, Steve still seems to be left out in the cold.  Beyond that, it really doesn't seem like the rest have made solid alliances.    As much as some people might see the powerhouse alliance this year as obnoxious, to be fair, they've won their power and used it to take out numbers that have been quite vocal about coming after them.  Most of the other outsiders seem pretty unconcerned about their positions in the house and really don't seem to be working hard to do anything about it.  The main alliance has also done a pretty good job of making the people not in their alliance feel like they just might be if they play their cards right.  Wait for a week when one of the outsiders wins HOH and I think we'll really see who will align where.   As much as I really like the ""Sixth Sense"" it would be interesting to actually see the others in an episode.  (Does Becky exist besides shots of her just sitting?)"

BigBrother,3dycnp,PrettySneaky71,19,Mon Jul 20 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"Simple lesson really: snitches get stitches.   The alliance you make week 1 rarely lasts for the entire game, unless you're the Brigade and have a Rachel/Brendon in the house to divert attention. While making these deals might grant you safety in the short-term, you don't want to spend the early game telling Susie what Tiffany has been saying about her. Especially if Tiffany never said that shit about Susie. Eventually, you'll find yourself in a room with Susie and Tiffany, and you've got to burn a bridge and say one of the girls was lying.   Control the flow of information, keep secrets to yourself, and most of all don't think that houseguests won't compare notes because they will. Andy won because he controlled the flow of information, giving it to Amanda and then letting her blow up, increasing the target on her & McCrae's backs.   Audrey was far too sloppy, and like Ronnie before her, once the ""Audrey said that about me, why she said this about you!"" conversation happens your ship is sunk. Information is power, and the best thing to do in the prejury game is build up a facade of being a trustworthy individual, that way when you do eventually decide to lie to save your own skin or throw another under the bus, you're still the boy crying wolf for the first time and the village is coming to your aid."

BigBrother,3dycnp,Narninian,4,Mon Jul 20 15:43:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying that she's batshit crazy, but it wasn't her plan to reveal that right at the start. CBS played a role in that in order to gain publicity after it got leaked. For all we know, CBS leaked it so they could reveal it early.  I just feel like she came into the house doing things she specifically said she wasn't going to do early on in the game. Is part of that her being crazy? Sure, but I think some of it was because she was already feeling combative.  She comes from a place where she excludes herself because of some social anxiety that was no doubt brought on by her feelings that led to her realizing she was transgender. You could see in her pre-interviews that she had a certain energy. She wanted to be somewhere with a fresh start. Then CBS hit her with a bomb and made her reveal something right away that put her right back in the heart of her anxiety. Something triggered that anxiety to make her feel like she was alone and needed to fight early on in the game, which ultimately led to her downfall."
BigBrother,3dycnp,JanuaryHos,2,Mon Jul 20 15:51:24 2015 UTC,"Revealing the first night was the best for her game, imo, and Im pretty sure it was her decision and not CBSs (although they were in the loop)."
BigBrother,3dycnp,Narninian,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:07 2015 UTC,"CBS did it for her own good. Once the public knew the houseguests needed to know in order to protect Audrey. Unfortunately, if any houseguest got flirty with her with the audience knowing but not the houseguests, the public would have destroyed her. It's wrong, but that's how society is right now.  As far as CBS leaking that information - it's certainly plausible. It's also entirely plausible that TMZ delves into the background of everyone as soon as the list of names comes out to try and find a story."

BigBrother,3dw7c8,CharlieCanyon,2,Mon Jul 20 04:28:28 2015 UTC,Why did they do it?
BigBrother,3dw7c8,NapsAndNetflix,2,Mon Jul 20 09:30:09 2015 UTC,Because they had to do the fan voting of players and some of the players that were up for being picked were on the current season that was airing. Literally on finale night of that season they also revealed who was picked by the fans and they left that day.
BigBrother,3dw7c8,sanz85,0,Mon Jul 20 11:04:45 2015 UTC,seriously? the S30 people didn't even go home? that's brutal.

BigBrother,3dw5hu,dracomalfo990,-11,Mon Jul 20 12:57:28 2015 UTC,But I think CBS needs to do something to save the season and make sure it doesn't go the way of BB16. If it keeps this way one alliance is going to run through the house. They need to give America the takeover for a couple weeks and let america be HoH. Get rid of two of Clay/Shelli/Vanessa and even things up a little bit
BigBrother,3dw5hu,mbradycf,2,Mon Jul 20 13:29:02 2015 UTC,you should watch BB Australia or UK
BigBrother,3dw5hu,DoesntGetYourJoke,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:44:28 2015 UTC,"What in the world are you talking about?   If one alliance runs roughshod through the house the whole summer, that's the other HG's problem, not America's I liked season 16. I always root for an alliance I like to stay together to the end. See also: the Brigade. America is never going to be HOH wtf are you on?"
BigBrother,3dw5hu,dracomalfo990,-6,Mon Jul 20 13:35:00 2015 UTC,"It's our problem because first and foremost we want to see an interesting product. I could give two shits ""how well someone is playing"" (a metric that is completely bullshit anyways due to the amount of luck involved in the game) if the show is not interesting. That's fine but Season 16 is universally reviled in the BigBrother community to the point that people even rank it below the disastrous Season 9 which everyone wants to forget. I and probably most BB fans don't care about ""watching an alliance make it to the end"", that is completely boring to me. I root for maximum amount of drama. BB12 was a pretty bad season that was saved by Britany. No even talks about the Brigade anymore whereas Britany has already been back on the show (and is likely a shoe-in for AllStars 2). The best seasons are where two alliances are going back and forth against each other in relatively even fight (See Season 6, 11, 13, 14) Canada was HoH in BB Canada, it is not far fetched to believe that they will have America as an HoH for a week esp since they have pretty much made America the DeFacto HoH in the past with things like Jeff's Coup De'etat and America's Player in season 8. This takeover twist is deliberately designed leave that door open"
BigBrother,3dw5hu,DoesntGetYourJoke,4,Mon Jul 20 13:45:06 2015 UTC,"FYI, the reason you're getting downvoted is for presenting your subjective opinions as fact. You're allowed to think whatever you want but when you tell me I shouldn't have enjoyed Season 16, or The Brigade, basically my response is just fuck off with that shit. Suggesting BB/CBS step in to break up the existing alliance and evict good players in no way makes the game more interesting. I will always be interested in watching the all-time masterminds like Derrick last year. If you want LOL DRAMA then go watch The Real World or Bad Girls Club some shit where there's no point but to get drunk and scream at each other.  Lastly, RE #3....  That said, you did successfully convince me America might at some point be HOH this season. It fits with the takeover theme. Doesn't mean that they would turn the house upside down or anything though."
BigBrother,3dw5hu,dracomalfo990,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:21:11 2015 UTC,"Meh we're on a BB subreddit on a throwaway account, who cares about the downvotes. You seem to be having a hard time following what I am saying, just because you have an opinion does not mean that it supersedes widely held conventional wisdom about a piece of entertainment. I think that the Star Wars prequels are better than the originals, it does not suddenly mean that what I think about the prequel overrides the conventional wisdom on the topic. Feel free to enjoy whatever you want, far from me to be telling you what you should and what you shouldn’t, some people enjoy the Serbian Film and think it is a great work of art, who am I to judge. But please get out of here before telling me that Season 16 was entertaining. I turned that shit of week 4 and never looked back. Absolute trash programming, I would have been more entertained watching paint dry in my yard rather than the constant unanimous votes, sheepish behaviour by the housemates. I don't care about watching ""masterminds"", it's 60% luck anyways, getting lucky with a terrible cast, good for him. If you want to watch strategy- watch a REAL strategy game like chess not what is essentially a glorified soap opera. Be real with yourself, you are watching a glorified soap opera where even the best players largely have their fate determined by luck and things beyond their control"

Do they show the truth about their golden TG ticket or do they portray her as the poor TG girl who got bullied?   Personally, I think Audrey is a batshit psychopath (I know...she's entertaining to us feedsters) who plays up the sympathy card excellently. Hell, she's already got half of you convinced. I wouldn't be surprised if she was the type of person in the outside world who always threatened to hurt herself if things didn't go her way.   She's not stupid. She knows she'll get more sympathy and popularity if she leaves on her own accord rather than be evicted by a group of her peers. Sad...she needs to suck it up, act like an adult, and take her medicine (maybe literally too)."
BigBrother,3dw5hu,THEsolid85,6,Mon Jul 20 11:09:50 2015 UTC,Do you even watch the episodes? She has been portrayed accurately to real life thus far.
BigBrother,3dw5hu,friendzone_ho,2,Mon Jul 20 11:05:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I do. Did I say anything about how she's currently being portrayed? Did you read what I wrote? I wondered about this situation...and it's a honest question and discussion.

They can't now pretend as if she's the poor bullied girl who doesn't deserve it, everyone watching already knows she's a manipulative liar who brings it on herself."
BigBrother,3dw5hu,Ihatey,14,Mon Jul 20 13:49:17 2015 UTC,Production has been editing people pretty well except Jeff. They showed how Audrey was pretty honestly. If she self evicts they will more than likely show what happened. I don't think Audrey is a psychopath. I honestly think that's a bit dramatic. She's just trying to save her game. If I was her if I got nominated there wouldn't be a chance in hell that I would spend anymore time in that house I would just self evict. You want to know why? They are going to talk mad shit about her and they are going to isolate her.
BigBrother,3dw5hu,ritoky,7,Mon Jul 20 17:42:56 2015 UTC,"I would be very upset if she both elected to or was allowed to self evict. She will just look like the person who takes their ball and leaves if the game isn't going their way or the person who argues balls and strikes with the ump and no on really cares for that person. And of course they are going to talk shit about her and isolate her, it is a direct response to both the game she has played and the person she has chosen to portray herself as in the house; and to be frank they probably should. It is not necessarily the humane thing to do but they aren't playing humanity, they're playing a social deception game for half a mill.  To put it shortly, she dug the hole with her choices from the moment she entered the house and not making her endure the consequences of her actions without a very good reason would be a joke. It's not like this is survivor where there's exposure to hunger and outdoors and infection....she's in a comfortable house for 72 extra hours."

I wasn't trying to be dramatic with the psychopath talk, but she is a bit psycho in the way she's handled people from Day 1, including the people she's been closest to. Either she believes the lies she tells people, or she thinks she can get away with it (my thought is on the latter), and either way is crazy in my book.  I don't agree she should go home. It's a game. It's a bed she made and many more before her had to lay in it in the exact same situation."
BigBrother,3dw5hu,Ihatey,2,Mon Jul 20 11:27:37 2015 UTC,"I meant she was trying to save her game now. She came into the house thinking she could be a master manipulator and she failed. It's not crazy it's game play. I think if she truly isn't stable enough to stay in the house and handle how she's going to be treated she needs to self evict. This is a game, but it's a very stressful game that some people can't handle.

BigBrother,3dvvah,lilacbear,11,Mon Jul 20 00:59:33 2015 UTC,Aannnd Courtney Love is currently filing her suing cbs papers
BigBrother,3dvvah,CaitlynnJenner,2,Mon Jul 20 00:59:00 2015 UTC,"Hahah, I was thinking the same thing. I was like, I hope they bought the rights to use the name Nirvana! But probably not."
BigBrother,3dvvah,ButNevertheless,2,Mon Jul 20 06:11:42 2015 UTC,Nirvana was a word before it was a band name.. would she really have the grounds to sue?
BigBrother,3dvvah,CaitlynnJenner,3,Mon Jul 20 07:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, at least in Courtney Love crackmind head. They used their song titles in the comp. But I think since her daughter gave her a loan from her trust fund, she doesn't have the rights anymore? Courtney was super upset when the Muppets sung Smell Like Teen Spirit. She's crazy and can be really vengeful."
BigBrother,3dvvah,ButNevertheless,4,Mon Jul 20 07:58:42 2015 UTC,"Nirvana fan, so I know totally know her craziness haha but singing is much different than song titles, I would assume? Especially impressed if she does make a big deal out of it since Nirvana was a word first and Teen Spirit was a deodorant first."
BigBrother,3dvvah,the_cucumber,3,Mon Jul 20 08:12:07 2015 UTC,Teen Spirit was a deodorant first.    Holy shit it all makes sense now
BigBrother,3dvvah,ButNevertheless,2,Mon Jul 20 11:16:28 2015 UTC,"Kathleen Hanna, the lead singer of the group Bikini Kill, gave Cobain the idea for the title when she spray painted ""Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit"" on his bedroom wall after a night of drinking and spraying graffiti around the Seattle area. In his pre-Courtney Love days, Cobain went out with Bikini Kill lead singer Tobi Vail, but she dumped him. Vail wore Teen Spirit deodorant, and Hanna was implying that Cobain was marked with her scent.  Cobain didn't know it when he wrote the song, but Teen Spirit is a brand of deodorant marketed to young girls. Kurt thought Hanna was complimenting him on his rebellious spirit, as someone who could inspire youth. Sales of Teen Spirit deodorant shot up when this became a hit, even though it is never mentioned in the lyrics.   tl;dr: Kurt was trying to make a joke song, essentially, making fun of mainstream. Someone then wrote on a wall ""Kurt smells like Teen Spirit"". Thinking that meant something good and not a deodorant, he used it for his song title.  It's an interesting story if you want to read more. Source"

BigBrother,3dvvah,isnotcreative,5,Mon Jul 20 00:57:30 2015 UTC,That was the joke of it. But they dumped mud but to smell like teen spirit would be smelling like a popular deodorant. That's where Kurt Cobain got the name from
BigBrother,3dvvah,PonderingAgain,3,Mon Jul 20 00:59:47 2015 UTC,"That's where Kurt Cobain got the name from   Only indirectly. He didn't know Teen Spirit was the name of a deodorant until way after the song was titled and recorded. A girl whom he was friends with wrote ""Kurt smells like teen spirit"" on one of the walls in whatever place he was living at the time. He thought it was a creative phrase and like it without realizing the more mundane meaning and that he was being simply being teased."

BigBrother,3dwopj,giraffeinred,51,Mon Jul 20 03:58:34 2015 UTC,"Shelli won't kiss him on camera, but it doesn't stop Clay from giving it a shot at least once a day. There was definitely a connection to begin with, but I'm not sure about its lasting power. That said, they are definitely bonded in a strategic relationship."
BigBrother,3dwopj,CharlieCanyon,16,Mon Jul 20 04:13:14 2015 UTC,So Clay is basically Danielle and Shelli is Shane.
BigBrother,3dwopj,skizmcniz,12,Mon Jul 20 08:37:04 2015 UTC,"No, because Shelli wants Clay too, she just doesn't want millions of people to see it all."
BigBrother,3dwopj,erod550,5,Mon Jul 20 15:42:50 2015 UTC,"I also wonder if most of that is strategic, like she wants to down play the showmance. I mean, they're obviously aligned, but the bond isn't as strong if they're not hooking up right? Shelli's a smart girl, I wouldn't be surprised if that was part of the reason for holding back on the showmance. Or, maybe just so she won't get distracted from gameplay. (like Dan Gheesling was saying, 500k vs. Showmance, take the 500k) and that's why she's shutting Clay down."
BigBrother,3dwopj,Hey_Man_Nice_Shot,3,Mon Jul 20 15:56:51 2015 UTC,"Yea I think downplaying it is what she's trying to do, but at this point it's already too late for that anyway. No one in the entire house is going to believe that either of them would ever vote for the other to leave at this point. So they already have all the negatives of being in a showmance without the fun part of getting to make out in the BB house."
BigBrother,3dwopj,erod550,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:41 2015 UTC,what does this mean? i watched bb14 but not live feeds and I hardly even remember the shane/danielle relationship.
BigBrother,3dwopj,revibe11,8,Mon Jul 20 13:03:41 2015 UTC,"Danielle was way into Shane, but he didn't really reciprocate, but used her to his advantage"
BigBrother,3dwopj,minnick27,2,Mon Jul 20 13:21:05 2015 UTC,"Danielle was super into Shane and acted like a lost puppy around him. She was constantly trying to kiss him, or get him to be affectionate with her.  Sometimes he'd reciprocate, which would only lead Danielle on, leaving her thinking there was something there when there wasn't."
BigBrother,3dwopj,skizmcniz,34,Mon Jul 20 15:31:40 2015 UTC,"They are definitely into each other, but Shelli doesn't want it on national TV"
BigBrother,3dwopj,cvelz,15,Mon Jul 20 04:13:45 2015 UTC,they're at the very least good friends and intense allies. they still flirt a lot but not nearly like they did the first week or two.
BigBrother,3dwopj,awake4o4,34,Mon Jul 20 07:08:21 2015 UTC,"Unpopular Opinion - They both seem like really good, kind-hearted people but it feels like they're an old married couple already. Like the kind of couple that gets stuck in a rut never has sex... and it's only been how long?"
BigBrother,3dwopj,trojanlaker,15,Mon Jul 20 06:54:37 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's just their personalities don't bring about a very ""exciting"" looking relationship. And like others have mentioned Shelli doesn't want to do something for everyone to see which is totally understandable"
BigBrother,3dwopj,veebs7,33,Mon Jul 20 08:20:47 2015 UTC,Ya she does have her dog at home watching her that she has to think about. She needs to be a good role model for the dog and I respect that.
BigBrother,3dwopj,xoxo52,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, completely understandable and I would probably do the same if I was in Shelli's shoes. I'm also making broad assumptions by watching a show and online feeds so I may be way off. If they're happy together that's all that matters."
BigBrother,3dwopj,trojanlaker,0,Mon Jul 20 21:52:08 2015 UTC,They are the type to work out and then discuss how many calories they just burned afterwards.  Totally fun couple.
BigBrother,3dwopj,PeteBennet,-6,Mon Jul 20 19:52:24 2015 UTC,I am very far from being someone who goes on SRS but Clay is condescending to everyone (particularly women) and acts like a white knight to Shelli.

But as others have said, Shelli doesn't want to kiss yet (she wants it to be a special moment), and doesn't feel the need to broadcast every stage of their relationship."
BigBrother,3dwopj,Firate,2,Mon Jul 20 12:26:02 2015 UTC,It's definitely a real connection. They're constantly saying little embarrassing baby talk things to each other and just being the goofy people you are when you're falling for the other person.

Audrey included that the Jeff thing was planned. It eventually got around the house, so the Shelli decided to clear the air .   Audrey was in the have not room sleep. I think Audrey woke up later but stayed in the Have Not room. Shelli initiated the group discussion.    I used all names because I figured pronouns would get confusing"

BigBrother,3du4cf,MephistoSchreck,22,Sun Jul 19 20:10:27 2015 UTC,Jun and Dani know how to tell the truth. < 3
BigBrother,3du4cf,lassidoggy,25,Sun Jul 19 15:20:00 2015 UTC,Dani honestly doesn't have much room to talk. She became obsessed with Nick in her season and then went on to marry a different one from her second time around.     Not that Austin isn't acting crazy but she has zero room to talk because that was her in season 8.
BigBrother,3du4cf,BlackSparkle13,4,Sun Jul 19 15:43:33 2015 UTC,What ever happened to that nick?
BigBrother,3du4cf,Kee369,5,Sun Jul 19 19:50:43 2015 UTC,I don't know. Last I heard after him and Dani failed he dated Jen from his season (the one Dani liked to yell at because Nick liked her and not Jen...) but beyond that...no clue.

BigBrother,3dwu2r,zyzbro,9,Mon Jul 20 09:03:38 2015 UTC,Austin pretty much admitted he has  a hole in his heart and Liz is possibly there to fill it.  I don't really see how after that edit his girlfriend would still be around..

People enjoyed the Caleb/Amber storyline last year and are trying to project something similar, or don't find Austin attractive so they think any of his advances are creepy. The bottom line is Liz has admitted to encouraging the behavior, so there is nothing wrong with Austin making moves on her, as far as he knows the feelings are reciprocated."

He has a wide array of interests from engineering, to Big Brother, to music, to his religion, to baseball.

BigBrother,3dxs33,cronidollars,2,Mon Jul 20 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"He may say that, but he's wrong.   Look at the numerous 1 on 1 conversations he's had, and you'll see that he has no issue with them.    Look at the awful conversation Jace and he had where Jace tries to intimidate him into keeping him. If Steve couldn't pick up on nonverbal cues, that would have either no effect, or taken a lot more work."
BigBrother,3dxs33,discipula_vitae,5,Mon Jul 20 21:07:08 2015 UTC,If winning big brother was all about solving math problems then yea he is the smartest person in the house. Unfortunately it's more about social situations and athletic competitions which I don't think are his strong suites
BigBrother,3dxs33,johnlockeswheelchair,4,Mon Jul 20 12:41:20 2015 UTC,It was really awkward during the house meeting last night when everyone else was sitting in a chair/sofa/bed and Steve was sitting/squatting on the floor.  I think it paints a picture of Steve's social game.  He kind of just fits in where he can but refuses to actively insert himself into the social game/alliances of the house.
BigBrother,3dxs33,jtbricker,4,Mon Jul 20 13:21:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think he ""refuses"" to be active in the social game, I really think he CAN'T. I'm extremely introvert, just like him and people who aren't just don't understand how difficult it is to actively take part in a conversation, especially with many people and/or people who are ""intimidating"" one way or another... I genuinely think he tries but is having a difficult time fitting in. And I'm not saying it's anyone's fault, but when the other houseguests constantly shut him down whenever he's trying to interact with them, it's not helping..."

Steve is definitely not playing the best game from a social aspect but I feel like deep down he knows what he's doing game wise. For example, in last nights episode he was talking about throwing the HOH. I had my theories in my head that he was doing that for his personal game and he confirmed it. I think Steve has a game plan that he's trying to execute and I think he really can do well despite his social game. I just think he's fooling us in a way and has everything planned out his way."
BigBrother,3dxs33,Midaech,7,Mon Jul 20 19:21:44 2015 UTC,"People assume Steve is smart just because he's awkward and looks like a nerd.

He doesn't even have a vocabulary. I don't think he's actually very bright.  Contrast that with Ian, who was awkward and looked like a nerd... but also had lots of book smarts and actually knew things like, you know, basic common words.  You could tell Ian was smart.  Steve is not.  Steve is a dork who plays the trombone."

They didn't show it on the episode, but Shelli told JMac not to throw it and try his best.  If Shelli didn't give him permission, I think he would have thrown it like always. He easily could have told Clay no when Clay asked him to throw it and didn't. As for Steve, again I don't think people thought he threw the comp, and those who did thought it was a shitty move, not a mastermind move. It was either Clay or Austin that pointed out that Steve knew how many dancers were wearing certain types of pants, and had he added them up, he would have known the answer was seven. I've said it several times, I don't think Steve is that smart.. just odd.       And do people really care that much about being right that they delete their incorrect assumptions?  That sounds like a silly waste of time."

BigBrother,3dwn98,ForgottenPhenom,15,Mon Jul 20 14:21:18 2015 UTC,"Oh lord, Season 15 was such a shitshow. We didn't really care for Elissa at first(if I remember correctly), we liked Amanda and Mccrae at the very beginning because they were more normal and real, same with Andy. He was great.   BUT as the season grew on, everyone absolutely hated Aaryn, they called her Aryan, for obvious reasons. She was the absolute devil but halfway through and on she kinda sorta pulled back her racist ways and redeemed herself with SOME of the reddit community.  Amanda we grew to absolutely hate for the most part, she never shut up and would make everything a big deal. All Mccrae would do was say ""whatever"" and agree with people so we grew tired of him.  Reddit despised Andy as time went on, thought he was a ""rat"" and we hate how he framed Elissa(who 90% of us were rooting to win) in the double eviction .   Judd became pissy as the season grew and we were leaning more towards the dislike side.  Jessie was a complete non factor except halfway through the season we hated everyone left besides pretty much her, kinda Judd, and Elissa, so we were rooting for Jessie a lot!!   Gina Marie was a complete idiot that people found hard to sympathize with because of all her comments.   Helen we all found to be annoying as hell with her HOH tirades and literally Janelle speeches.   And everyone else was kinda a non factor.  TLDR: We hated Andy, Amanda, Mccrae, Aaryn, Gina Marie, Helen. This sub loved Elissa and grew to love Jessie, and Judd was a fan favorite with his one-liners. But everyone was really team Elissa"
BigBrother,3dwn98,lilacbear,19,Mon Jul 20 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"This sub loved Elissa?  That was my first season to watch but that is shocking to me, she was terrible."
BigBrother,3dwn98,UtopianComplex,8,Mon Jul 20 04:34:57 2015 UTC,"America sololy loved her because of Rachel. She kept getting MVP to basically backdoor strong players, so she was seen as somewhat decent player. IMO if she wasn't Rachel's sister and given the MVP power that basically saved her week one, she would've been out and seen as a weak player. Also the cast pretty much sucked with all the racist drama so there also wasnt much to pick from on that season."

BigBrother,3dwn98,jenh6,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:43:18 2015 UTC,"Elissa was my favorite from BB15. How was she terrible? She managed to play her cards right and EVEN tried to save Amanda--who had bullied her relentlessly. Additionally, she was extremely athletic; she won the power of OTEV.  Was she terrible because you didn't like her? Probably."
BigBrother,3dwn98,Dishonoreduser,6,Mon Jul 20 07:19:17 2015 UTC,"Me not liking her was exactly why she was terrible. I didn't mean to imply anything else. If you want specifics:   Her voice was annoying,she had trashy taste, she broke down and almost quit. She was always crying and seemed to think agree deserved extra respect because she was a mom. She whined the entire show. Every time she got mvp her celebratory squeal was grating.   I really liked Helen and andy, and kind of liked Amanda, McCray. Everyone else was a dud for me.  It was my first and I didn't watch religiously, but I am surprised."
BigBrother,3dwn98,UtopianComplex,-2,Mon Jul 20 08:17:03 2015 UTC,"People mainly started liking her because of the Amanda bullying iirc, but really there wasn't many likeable people that season"

Once Elissa and Amanda were out (I think many were rooting for one of them, some for the hero, some for the anti-hero), most the sub (except for Andy fans) were rooting for who they disliked least, and many turned towards GM. It's been a while, but that's kind of how I remember it."
BigBrother,3dwn98,YoBannannaGirl,11,Mon Jul 20 06:46:51 2015 UTC,"90% of us rooting for Elissa to win is a gross exaggeration.

In her first interview when she said that her biggest threat would be all the girls who were jealous of her, I immediately thought ""oh here we go"" because that sort of attitude on its own is rather annoying. Yet I don't agree with your need to slut shame her for her gameplay. She talks about being flirty with guys to get an advantage in the game, from what I've seen she's clear about her intentions in DR sessions. I feel as if you don't like her as a person so you're discrediting her gameplay and saying everything she's doing is simply because she's desperate and craves attention. I think it has to do more with her gameplay than simply wanting every guy to like her. Maybe just lay off, I would use whatever I could to get further in the game also, she just happens to feel as if her looks and flirty personality will help her in the game so she's using that."

BigBrother,3dw3s1,Meepenator3,13,Mon Jul 20 00:47:17 2015 UTC,Well... it's getting a bit interesting right now.  The plan is to take off Jason and backdoor Audrey. But Audrey found it out and is stirring shit as usual.
BigBrother,3dw3s1,tonyiptony,12,Mon Jul 20 00:53:26 2015 UTC,My question is why take off Jason? Why not take down Jmac and have 2 people you want gone up?
BigBrother,3dw3s1,diary_room,16,Mon Jul 20 01:04:59 2015 UTC,"If you leave Jason up, there's a better chance for a divided vote.  If you put someone liked up next to your target, there's less chance of sympathy and house flipping wrecking your plans.  Consider last week's closer than expected vote."
BigBrother,3dw3s1,ecspike,7,Mon Jul 20 01:10:58 2015 UTC,"but there's still a chance of a flip. Although Jmac isn't really in their alliance, he's definitely been a major asset to their success. Why risk losing him in any way, shape, or form?  Also, you'll have the people wanting to keep Audrey because she's a bigger target (i.e.: Austin)"
BigBrother,3dw3s1,Parvite,3,Mon Jul 20 01:15:53 2015 UTC,They are gonna mess around and then it's curtains for one of them when/if she gets HOH. TBH they should have taken her out in Week 2 instead of Day.
BigBrother,3dw3s1,ronscot,5,Mon Jul 20 05:29:20 2015 UTC,THANK GOD JASON IS AMAZING I NEED HIM!
BigBrother,3dw3s1,branhoo88,8,Mon Jul 20 02:54:44 2015 UTC,"Audrey has a scorched earth policy happening now.  There is no way she is not being put up and not going home, but because of the boneheaded decision to put her up, maybe the dynamics will change for the rest of them lined up to go right after her."
BigBrother,3dw3s1,brick-face,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:08:32 2015 UTC,I think its smarter to get jason out now. Audrey seems to easy to get out in any other week
BigBrother,3dw3s1,Aqua-Tech,6,Mon Jul 20 13:15:12 2015 UTC,And this is how she will never leave!
BigBrother,3dw3s1,Aqua-Tech,2,Mon Jul 20 13:22:19 2015 UTC,"Sure she will.....but why target the person who the whole house hates? That person will be a target for weeks on end. This is basic BB strategy. You let major targets hang around in order to consolidate power, it works even better sun the person everyone wants out thinks you're their only friend and protecting them."
BigBrother,3dyspt,JunittaCadillac,6,Mon Jul 20 17:10:30 2015 UTC,I don't believe she's a recruit. Yeah she said it but I think I've heard about 5 former hg who met her a Big Brother related events.   She sounds like a fan pretending to be a recruit.

Most of the HGs don't realize a big alliance has formed (they are starting to, though) and its not a bad strategy to lay low. I saw on live feeds a reference to being ""Megged"". If you are put up next to meg, you are the one going home because she's so well liked. That is not a bad place to be in the house, she just ended up on the wrong side (not in power, not part of the 6th sense)."
BigBrother,3dyspt,bookworm0901,9,Mon Jul 20 17:29:17 2015 UTC,"Eh. Shes done nothing strategic at all and ive seen nothing that leads me to believe she will.

BigBrother,3dyspt,BarrySandusky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:32:14 2015 UTC,i totally respect your view however i believe that sometimes strategy doesnt need to be a very elaborate game plan. She's done an excellent job making social connections which is clearly paying off because people always want to talk to her about game and non game stuff. She's playing an underdog game
BigBrother,3dyspt,average_HOH,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:40 2015 UTC,yeah but I tought she would be a smart player. She has a good social game but thats because of her personality not because of her game skills
BigBrother,3dyspt,ZombieDonShula,3,Mon Jul 20 17:43:45 2015 UTC,"Really? In her pregame interviews she seems very bubbly, cute and self-aware but that doesn't translate into gamebot.

BigBrother,3duyr6,piggyme,13,Mon Jul 20 02:32:15 2015 UTC,if becky and jackie make final 2 then Rob Cesternino is a genius as he's said for YEARS the best big brother strategy is to sleep until after jury.  At least Jackie has articulated that this is her strategy on the feeds - If both follow his strategy and get to the final he has to get some credit!  I just wish people would stop saying she's a floated - thats not what floater means Rachel!!!!
BigBrother,3duyr6,cgbrannigan,11,Sun Jul 19 20:07:56 2015 UTC,But he also picked Day to win and loved Jace.   He's all over the board.
BigBrother,3duyr6,Golden_Grahams,10,Sun Jul 19 20:50:18 2015 UTC,He also picked Andy to win BB15. He's just having an off year on picks.
BigBrother,3duyr6,Emloaf,3,Mon Jul 20 00:10:02 2015 UTC,I think he might have picked Ian too.
BigBrother,3duyr6,suppadelicious,5,Mon Jul 20 00:38:01 2015 UTC,Nicole picked Ian (and is leading for survivor winners too!). Team Nicole!
BigBrother,3duyr6,juluj,2,Mon Jul 20 01:14:01 2015 UTC,"That was 2 years ago.   I think the bigger issue is that if someone makes hundreds of predictions they're  bound to get a few right. Not necessarily because they know the game, just because statistically it's bound to happen."
BigBrother,3duyr6,Golden_Grahams,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:57:18 2015 UTC,Just because you made bad picks pre-season doesn't mean you don't know the game. The pre-show interviews don't really show off how a person will play. I think staying out of the spotlight the first few weeks is a sound plan.
BigBrother,3duyr6,Narninian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed but the point is when you make tons of predictions, you have just as good a chance getting a few right whether you know the game or not."
BigBrother,3duyr6,Golden_Grahams,2,Mon Jul 20 18:00:30 2015 UTC,yip!
BigBrother,3duyr6,cgbrannigan,6,Sun Jul 19 21:07:17 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, while it massively depends on what happens from here on out, Becky would win as it stands, Becky has an HOH and a BOTB, close allies in John and Jackie (yes I know they aren't official alliances they are defacto alliances in every since of the word).   Also am I the only one who thinks Becky is a great spot, I mean on earth would anyone target Becky? I don't even see her going home as pawn of a failed backdoor, I don't think anyone is using her as a pawn (or at least one to lose BOTB, since she beast boded the first one apparently), and why on earth would you bother putting the effort to backdoor her when they are like 3 other people everyone else in the house has priority to target over her."
BigBrother,3duyr6,weso123,3,Sun Jul 19 19:23:39 2015 UTC,I could see Becky getting evicted once one alliance devours the other. In terms of the floaters - I would think she is more dangerous at competitions than John or Steve. At least at this point.
BigBrother,3duyr6,EdDantes21,14,Sun Jul 19 20:01:53 2015 UTC,"I think there's a difference between being a floater and being completely unaware of the game around you. For the most part, I'd say Becky is a floater while Jackie is the latter.    But I've said this before - people get upset at players like Jackie and Victoria, but what do you expect from recruits?"
BigBrother,3duyr6,EdDantes21,12,Sun Jul 19 19:07:43 2015 UTC,Jackie is way more in the game the Becky. Becky still talks about the inside outside alliance. She never talks game with anyone at all. She says her and Jackie are working together but she doesn't talk game with her. What? She was talking to Jmac and forgot a secret he told her about the game and she didn't really care where you could tell Jmac was pissed she didn't care.
BigBrother,3duyr6,ChuckEJesus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:40:46 2015 UTC,Any chance you know the timestamp for the Becky/JMac conversation?
BigBrother,3duyr6,okapiis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:12:59 2015 UTC,it was somewhere right after the BOB comp. They were in bed together]

BigBrother,3duyr6,okapiis,18,Mon Jul 20 01:30:52 2015 UTC,Jackie seems much more aware than Becky.
BigBrother,3duyr6,stinkmeaner92,8,Sun Jul 19 20:35:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed. By the way Jackie spoke to Jeff before his eviction, you can tell how aware she is. I am thinking she has game, she's just not showing it yet."
BigBrother,3duyr6,distractedtears,6,Mon Jul 20 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"If you genuinely think Jackie is unaware, you obviously haven't listened to her talk at all."
BigBrother,3duyr6,SlightlyAmbiguous,-6,Mon Jul 20 04:31:12 2015 UTC,Becky hasnt been in the dr for almost 2 weeks now most people don consider her a player since really she doesnt do ANYTHING thus being in this post
BigBrother,3duyr6,GuyNoirPI,9,Sun Jul 19 19:11:41 2015 UTC,Andy tweeted that he would go throughout periods of time with no DR time.
BigBrother,3duyr6,EdDantes21,3,Sun Jul 19 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"True. If you rewatch the first few episodes of 15 - he's barely a blip on the radar. I'm not even saying that Becky is playing the Andy game because I think Andy was more involved - but she's not the same level of a Victoria or Jackie, either."
BigBrother,3duyr6,Wood_Ape,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"She isn't EVER on the feeds, either, though. Hell, Becky and Johnny Mac might as well not even be in the house. They are absent until JM has to play the pawn."
BigBrother,3duyr6,EdDantes21,5,Mon Jul 20 01:25:14 2015 UTC,"She won an HOH. She's actually in a relatively good spot. She's not a mastermind or playing an amazing social game but nobody is really gunning for her. Hence ""floater""."
BigBrother,3duyr6,helarco,0,Sun Jul 19 19:14:01 2015 UTC,"LMAO even as HoH she still didn't know what was happening or what the real plan was, thus proving she knows nothing about what's going on around."
BigBrother,3duyr6,EdDantes21,-10,Sun Jul 19 19:18:26 2015 UTC,she didnt even win the hoh shelli did even if she did win bob shelli would still have dictated her moves and the house thinks she voted for jeff to stay
BigBrother,3duyr6,mirandaBBfan,8,Sun Jul 19 19:19:35 2015 UTC,She definitely did win the HOH. I get that you're saying she lost BOB - but how is that her fault? Shelli would not have dictated her moves. Becky wanted Audrey backdoored and said it throughout the week in the DR and thought that was the plan. I get that you don't like her/don't find her interesting but you're kind of twisting the narrative at this point.
BigBrother,3duyr6,tweefilteredfungus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:49:13 2015 UTC,depends how their gameplay turns out...
BigBrother,3duyr6,SoButtscrewed,2,Sun Jul 19 20:23:30 2015 UTC,Jackie's speech would start with how she came out playing the game strong by being a pawn in the first week
BigBrother,3duyr6,JeremyTheMVP,3,Mon Jul 20 01:45:22 2015 UTC,Becky looks like the average female in her late 20's. Not quite sure what Big Brother casting was expecting from her. Maybe sometimes they intentionally recruit people to be floaters. Not everybody in the game can be a superstar.
BigBrother,3duyr6,jennymaecry,2,Sun Jul 19 19:30:18 2015 UTC,"I don't watch the feeds, has Steve done anything?"

BigBrother,3duyr6,ChuckEJesus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"It would hugely depend on the road to the f2. Their gameplay so far would have very little impact on the votes.   That being said: I feel like Jackie would be able to mention in her speech that separating herself from Jeff and staying under the radar was part of her strategy, and Becky would just say I respect all of you and please vote for me."
BigBrother,3duyr6,suppadelicious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:53 2015 UTC,If I was Becky mymain point against her is that this is her second chance. She was already on the amazing race and got a second chance with Big Brother. She also had an advantage of having an ally before she even entered the house.

BigBrother,3dvxee,D64015,3,Mon Jul 20 00:11:39 2015 UTC,I've seen people in the past cut their own hair. Never have heard of them getting hair cuts otherwise. I think guys tend to do it themselves or some other house guests will do it if they're lucky. Girls probably just deal with it or cut their own.
BigBrother,3dvxee,Rae7796,2,Sun Jul 19 23:57:32 2015 UTC,I watched a bit of live feeds last week on the day of eviction while they were all cleaning and getting ready and Clay cut James' hair.
BigBrother,3dvxee,bookworm0901,2,Mon Jul 20 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"I've seen the guys getting their hair cut. Most girls deal with it, maybe do root touch ups. Most girls I know (including myself) don't cut their hair every month. Since it's long it's easier to go a couple months and hide the fact it needs a cut. I haven't cut my hair since like April haha. Most of my friends at school only cut their hair when they go back home to their hair dressers at Christmas, spring break, end of the year, etc."

BigBrother,3du644,TexasWithADollarsign,3,Mon Jul 20 19:31:01 2015 UTC,"I mean, that's his character in wrestling.  A lot of wrestlers will have played some gimmick for so long that it really becomes a part of them.  Triple H is basically called Hunter by most people (outside of legal formalities and business things) despite it not being his real name, but his character's name, Hunter Hearst Helmsley.  Why not bring his character into a TV show that is all about characters anyways?  It raises the chance he would get on TV because it's unique."

BigBrother,3du644,SillyRabbit2121,9,Mon Jul 20 10:02:16 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting observation and one that I agree with, to an extent. Judas seems like a projection of Austin's need for attention.  Validation issues aside, I really like how he hosted that show. I think Clay mentioned something on the feeds a while back about how he was jealous of Austin because his enunciates his words, and I agree. He also comes across as very astute and intelligent in that video. It's a shame we barely see that side of him on the show/on the feeds."
BigBrother,3du644,sophia_e_92,18,Sun Jul 19 17:50:50 2015 UTC,"Y'know, Austin gets shit on a lot for playing emotionally and being creepy - and I get it, he's being weird - but consider the environment. It's widely acknowledged that being in the Big Brother house basically drives everyone crazy. Your personality will show unless you're Derrick or Will.    I'd like to say that I wouldn't bother with a showmance or let my feelings get in the way in the Big Brother house, but you really don't know until you're in there."

BigBrother,3dykq5,Pnoman98,7,Mon Jul 20 16:14:36 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in his game. I feel like he understands right now that nobody will vote him out and that Shelli and Clay owe him some protection. He'll have an opportunity to use it to his advantage but I feel like only one opportunity. He'd be a perfect candidate to backdoor Clay or Shelli down the road but he'll have to pick his time right. Once he fires a shot he'll become an instant target. If he builds a strong alliance base outside of Clay and Shelli he'll be able to do some damage.   edit: ""do"""
BigBrother,3dykq5,specialopts51,4,Mon Jul 20 16:32:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. He's in a very good spot. Even if the Sixth Sense wins week after week, I don't think they'll want to evict John until he's the only outsider left. Even then, Clay and Shelli may have an alliance with him at that point and choose to go after Austin and the twins instead. He might become the Andy of this season. (Albeit way more likeable)"
BigBrother,3dykq5,jukakis01,6,Mon Jul 20 17:45:47 2015 UTC,"Becoming the Andy of the season entails every single one of those house guests feeding him info, and him having an uncanny ability to teleport into different rooms in a mere matter of seconds.   He could totally use Clay/Shelli like Andy used Amanda though, if he works it right."
BigBrother,3dykq5,piggyme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:21:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I meant. I don't think he can get people to feed him info. He's not that good. However, I do think he could use Clay/Shelli as a shield for a while and then turn on them when he finds something better."
BigBrother,3dykq5,jukakis01,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:24 2015 UTC,"I think he is gonna easily make the final five and has a good chance at final four.   The 6 sense is unlikely to target him and likely to protect him, so long as no one else in the alliance is at risk. The other houseguests are not even looking in his direction.   So I expect him to last longer then the 6 sense alliance does. And when it does break up, he will likely team up with clay/shelly against the other members, or form another alliance to target clay/shelly. That should take him into the final five because I see him as the last target in whatever alliance be gets in.   After that it's a matter of who wins what, with him having a better then 50/50 chance of not being the prime target of anyone going into the final five. After that, he could get in trouble unless he has a strong alliance with someone because his veto wins and likability will make it so people will consider not taking him to the finals."

BigBrother,3dwkbv,skin87,3,Mon Jul 20 14:40:18 2015 UTC,I mean they show the picture so it's kind of unnecessary. After it's revealed they say their name too.
BigBrother,3dwkbv,TheDriver89,3,Mon Jul 20 04:45:52 2015 UTC,"My guess would be you can't screw the timing up.  You wouldn't want the name said before the picture appears (is is more suspenseful to the see the picture instead of hearing the name plus that way you don't accidentally flub a name which is particularly important this season with all the j's).  There maybe a delay of when the key turns and when the picture pops up.  Then at the end the say ""I have nominated you X and Y.  X blah blah blah. Y blah blah blah.  Good luck."""

BigBrother,3dumey,rickiracoon,9,Sun Jul 19 18:31:27 2015 UTC,"It's like a bunch of ORG. The lower-level ones are kinda fun, but the problem is that the system gives everyone the full 5 minutes to vote each round, so when people sign up for a game and then go do something else, it lags like crazy.   The higher-level ones are extremely cliquey and require premade skype alliances. Joining them is like being in MTV's The Challenge: the people who have been around forever keep themselves safe and vote out all the newbies.   There's also this thing where you can upgrade your avatar by buying it fancy hair, outfits, accessories, etc. People make their own and then spam you incessantly to ""like"" it. Simply joining a game puts at least 6-7 private messages in your inbox of people you've never met telling you to upvote their pair of sunglasses or whatever.   It's good in theory but frustrating in practice."

Jeff (Fan Fav) said what he said and now works for CBS Shelly (against fan fav) made a game move and voted Jeff out. Fans called her job trying to get her fired and sent death threats.  Jeff did something bad yet nothing happened to him and he actually got a job now with the company. Shelly just played the game, however it was against a ""fan fav"" so she got death threats.

BigBrother,3dv3ld,CharlieCanyon,3,Sun Jul 19 20:48:52 2015 UTC,"I watched BB4 last year, and was surprised when Alison told other houseguests that Nathan might be gay and they called him a fruitcake. Why did they even air that? Unless they were trying to justify the house flipping on him, as if that were a good reason.    I've only been watching the feeds for three years. I'd love to hear the perspective of someone who could speak to the atmosphere at the time."
BigBrother,3dv3ld,v-r-s,2,Sun Jul 19 20:08:16 2015 UTC,Calling him a fruitcake was just out of humor. I call myself fruity all the time and Alison was implying it the same way I do it towards myself.

I don't believe in policing people's language and definitely don't shy away from using words that might be seen as derogatory in less progressive circles.

Right before she said she would cut ties with him.   **Edit: For the record, I'm still a big Alison fan lol   But that was in poor taste.**"
BigBrother,3dv3ld,UnanimousBB16,6,Sun Jul 19 20:20:10 2015 UTC,Alison was not joking whatsoever. The way she did him was very disgusting. There was nothing but malice in that scene.

It's amazing how much things have changed. People would have been calling for Alison's expulsion from the game over those comments. I can't think of any other examples but I know there have been a few comments that have caught my attention. It's just crazy how different the world was and tv was when the internet was less of a thing.

If there was NO girlfriend outside the house, his behavior would STILL be disturbing and I think people are losing sight of that. People seem to focus on whatever his girlfriend said before he entered the house.  That's between them. Who cares.  But IN the house, when he tells a woman HE feels dirty because she slept in the same bed as another man, well screw him. He has serious power and control issues with females.  He's trying to control Liz to take care of his own childish feelings.  I would tell him to piss off."

BigBrother,3dtla8,ilizibith1,5,Sun Jul 19 20:22:57 2015 UTC,"Austin has not seen or spoken to anyone outside of the house in a month now. That is a really intense situation to be in. He has no idea whether or not his girlfriend is banging a different guy every night. By the time he gets out, she could have a new serious boyfriend. He has no way of knowing. In the meantime, he has made a strong emotional connection to someone he is basically locked in a cage with.   If his girlfriend said she's not waiting for him, it seems to me that their relationship is not exclusive and possibly non existent and therefore he is in no way disrespecting her or their agreement."
BigBrother,3dtla8,Takan_Oasis,6,Sun Jul 19 10:46:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think ""my girlfriend could be banging any guy right now"" would be a good excuse to start chasing after every female in the house.

BigBrother,3dtla8,Takan_Oasis,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:03:04 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people are giving him the benefit of the doubt due to the overreaction people had to Christine x Cody last year. This sub was bashing her like no tomorrow only to have her bf reveal it barely affected him. Regardless of if he's being scummy or not, it's probably best to wait until post-season to cast judgment so the whole story can be told."
BigBrother,3dtla8,discipula_vitae,24,Sun Jul 19 11:59:17 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about?  Christine was married and her husband tweeted multiple times about how hurt he was, but wanted to wait until she got out of the house to talk about it."
BigBrother,3dtla8,branhoo88,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he waited to act maturely and it didn't end up being the relationship ending thing everyone thought it should have been. Obviously he was hurt, but it put the viewers in their place with how overreactive they were."
BigBrother,3dtla8,fatherofthesun,12,Sun Jul 19 13:41:26 2015 UTC,He specifically said the people hounding him about it were 100x worse than anything he saw in the house.

BigBrother,3dsgj0,TGal227,45,Sun Jul 19 00:43:57 2015 UTC,"I understand Austin not getting her letter. The girlfriend letter probably wouldn't be given on the first win, but it is strange they cut the feeds when he talks about her. Maybe she did withdraw her consent and just not tell someone or there was a misunderstanding between the girlfriend and CBS. I don't think they would cut the feeds just to make her look bad.  It would be a perfectly normal reaction based on Austins behavior. And, if all this is true, Austin is a jerk."
BigBrother,3dsgj0,YoBannannaGirl,45,Sun Jul 19 01:05:20 2015 UTC,Hard to trust anyone with a phone battery under 20 percent
BigBrother,3dsgj0,trojanlaker,33,Sun Jul 19 08:32:21 2015 UTC,if his gf signed a waiver then they wouldn't cut to fish whenever he speaks about her  I am not a big Austin fan but there are two side to the story. Austin said his gf did not support him going on the show and was about to break up with him anyways.
BigBrother,3dsgj0,mirandaBBfan,9,Sun Jul 19 01:11:49 2015 UTC,Maybe she didn't support him going into the house because she knew he'd do whatever he needed to further his career..
BigBrother,3dsgj0,sabatoa,22,Sun Jul 19 04:14:07 2015 UTC,What has production done to maker her look bad? The only things said about her have come from Austin's mouth.

BigBrother,3dsgj0,SoButtscrewed,17,Sun Jul 19 20:35:00 2015 UTC,"It's easy to say ""screw Austin"" and silly stuff like that.  We don't know the truth of their relationship.  Maybe it had already run its course in his eyes or any number of possibilities.  It's one thing to comment on their personality, it's another to pretend we know their personal relationships."
BigBrother,3dsgj0,Blackknighl,12,Sun Jul 19 20:51:41 2015 UTC,"He should not have went on all of his pre season interviews saying how in love he is with her, and how he would not do anything to break their devotion and bond in the house."
BigBrother,3dsgj0,UnanimousBB16,16,Sun Jul 19 06:20:41 2015 UTC,"If it had 'already run it's course in his eyes' I think the polite thing would have do to have broken up with her as most people do when they lose interest in a relationship.  Not go on TV and humiliate her by harassing another attractive female, as though his GF back home is disposable."
BigBrother,3dsgj0,SoButtscrewed,2,Sun Jul 19 11:08:52 2015 UTC,"Her face book says ""listed in a relationship with Austin"" which means, his does too. So take that as you will."

BigBrother,3dsgj0,gb1993,5,Sun Jul 19 09:10:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna judge, just like I didn't judge the Christine/Cody thing. This is people personal lives we're talking about and I don't know (and never will pry enough to know) what their relationship is/was like and how that will affect them outside the house. That's between them. Some people's judgemental comments deserve to be in a TMZ sub rather than this one. I understand this type of stuff comes with constantly being recorded for 3 montgs straight isolated in a house, but I've never been one to involve myself in peoples lives outside of the game."
BigBrother,3dsgj0,TheLadyPliza,4,Mon Jul 20 01:43:20 2015 UTC,There's a TMZ sub?  Gotta go.....
BigBrother,3dsgj0,theohux13,12,Sun Jul 19 11:21:53 2015 UTC,"Austin has talked on the feeds about his girlfriend situation, and it sounds pretty complicated. He said that she straight up told him she might not be there for him when he gets out, so he probably decided to let whatever happens happen.   Let's not pretend we all know about what's actually happening."
BigBrother,3dsgj0,wildhockey64,-9,Sun Jul 19 17:15:03 2015 UTC,And I'm assuming this is the reason why she 'won't be there for him' so... I think she still has every right to feel pretty hurt and betrayed.   Austin's an ass and mopes about how he thinks with his heart. False. He clearly thinks with his manhood
BigBrother,3dsgj0,SoButtscrewed,3,Sun Jul 19 00:46:45 2015 UTC,"No, she said she might not be there because she hates the entertainment industry and didn't want him to go on the show. He's said that while he wishes it would work, their relationship is difficult at times because they want completely different things in life."
BigBrother,3dsgj0,wildhockey64,-2,Sun Jul 19 07:25:10 2015 UTC,"That's not an excuse for him to behave the way he has.   I think her ""I may not be here when you get back"" can be interpreted many different ways- not just her saying ""Let's end this,"".  Sure, you can give him the benefit of the doubt, and maybe he construed it as ""This is a free pass to do what I want in our relationship,"", that isn't always what it means- usually the opposite. As in- 'I'm not going to be here if you give me a reason not to be'."
BigBrother,3dsgj0,SoButtscrewed,5,Sun Jul 19 09:18:14 2015 UTC,"The guy has already said he's doing BB only for his career, and he's intentionally playing certain things up.  The easiest way to get airtime on Grodner's BB is to even have the hint of a showmance, and he's doing that also now.  While I sympathize with the GF, she must have known what he and the show would do."
BigBrother,3dsgj0,chaz_batch,2,Sun Jul 19 15:00:51 2015 UTC,I doubt he's getting fake mad about the whole Liz/Jeff thing. Guy is just insecure.

BigBrother,3dsgj0,TheKyleThatSucks,11,Mon Jul 20 12:32:06 2015 UTC,"Well he's been fawning over and hitting on another woman the entire time he's been on the show.

BigBrother,3dsgj0,pistachiopaul,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:55:39 2015 UTC,Because he's freaking out over a person he hasn't even known that long. When he has a girlfriend already.  Big jerk move to do that.
BigBrother,3dsgj0,Forrea,2,Sun Jul 19 04:37:37 2015 UTC,She says in her info thing that she is a twin. Does this mean Austin's girlfriend could also be a twin?!
BigBrother,3dsgj0,YoBannannaGirl,9,Sun Jul 19 04:53:18 2015 UTC,"His girlfriend isn't a twin, but she has sisters who are twins."
BigBrother,3dsgj0,YoBannannaGirl,5,Mon Jul 20 12:31:24 2015 UTC,"I saw she was 19, and figured it unlikely, but Austin sure seems to have a lot of twins in his life :)"

BigBrother,3dsgj0,SoButtscrewed,3,Sun Jul 19 00:58:50 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming that the ""production is trying to make her look bad"" is coming from what Austin is saying about her. About their relationship, about it being open, etc.  I can imagine in that position that if production is letting austin say these things and they may not actually be true- that is where she is getting the 'production is making me look bad' from."

If it later comes down to the big movers (Shelli, Clay, Van, Austin, Jason, etc.) and him, the big movers will fight each other and Steve will be home free.  I don't see this happening, but it's an interesting thought."

BigBrother,3dsao2,GoatTit,4,Sun Jul 19 00:54:37 2015 UTC,They are pretty loud though.
BigBrother,3dsao2,crabald,6,Sun Jul 19 02:08:26 2015 UTC,I think if you get it up high enough it would be really hard to see (the stadium lights are so bright you cant see past them) and most likely nobody would think thats what the noise is. Then once high enough over the backyard just cut the power so it drops right into the backyard. You wont be getting it back regardless so who cares if it gets broken. The only thing that will need to be figured out is the timing (based on the message and who is back there) and the best way to attach the message so it gets the point across asap before production tries to shut it down.
BigBrother,3dsao2,GoatTit,3,Sun Jul 19 02:26:16 2015 UTC,"But that would be extremely dangerous if anyone's in the yard at that time, because pieces might fly off when it lands, and they'd probably lock the HGs inside otherwise.

If someone gets hurt, then it could very well be assault, if that's what you're trying to say.   It's dangerous to walk down a sidewalk because a car might lose control and hit you, or blow a tire as it is about to pass you and throw tire pieces your way.   That driver is potentially endangering your wellbeing, that does not mean it is a crime."

A jury of 13 is obviously not possible at this point, and the next most likely number is 7, but production knows that people enjoy seeing the jury life so they'll want to start it sooner.  The only way I could imagine jury not having 9 people is if they decided to make it 8 or 10 with ""America's choice"" being the tie breaker if needed, which would be neat and entirely possible. But don't hold your breath for anything but 9 jurors."

BigBrother,3dx7om,GoTurnMeOn,7,Mon Jul 20 08:14:11 2015 UTC,Common sense answer: they are sequestered; that's why they switch every few days.
BigBrother,3dx7om,Funwithaduck,4,Mon Jul 20 09:22:12 2015 UTC,"No one knows.    I assume that they're sequestered similarly to how the HG's are sequestered before the season starts.    Probably put up in a hotel somewhere with no access to TV, internet or cellphones.     I'd imagine they'd give them something to do like books to read or old movies / tv shows to watch.    It would be kind of unfair if they got to watch old seasons of BB though, since they shouldn't be given the advantage of watching the strategy of previous seasons now that this season has started."
BigBrother,3dx7om,SillyRabbit2121,2,Mon Jul 20 10:19:03 2015 UTC,"Last week Liz said they get to watch movies. Austin said she should get some horror movies but that might be too scary by herself. Liz replied she liked horror movies, then it cut to fish I think.   No time stamp but it was when they were laying in the hoh bed before she switched out with Julia."

His interactions with Liz are so painful and the way he was yesterday makes it seem like he's doing it all for viewer attention.  In case you didn't see it, Liz was gone in the house for only about 6-8 hours and Austin was moping around in the HOH , whining about how much he missed her and waiting until Monday to see her again seems like an eternity, bla-bla-bla .... all to get an ""awww"" from Shelli, it was so, so, so, ridiculous...   I'm willing to bet when she returns on Monday he will get all emotional, maybe even start to cry."

BigBrother,3dqj91,GoombaBB,5,Sun Jul 19 02:10:30 2015 UTC,But it would be good for Vanessa and Shelli's game to get rid of one of the ADC members over Audrey. I think it's likely that ADC will still target Vanessa next week (especially Jackie and Meg because they're probably still sour over Jeff). Audrey has no alliance members and may still work with Vanessa and Shelli if she wins HOH next week. I see no virtually no benefit for them to kick Audrey out over Jason.

Possible options: shut the fuck up and stop making predictions, eat your shoe, eat a bag of dicks, delete your reddit account, etc.  If there are no stakes for your prediction other than ""I told you so"" then I'd suggest you just shut the fuck up right now because I don't care."
BigBrother,3dqj91,okcoooli,10,Sun Jul 19 02:39:14 2015 UTC,Have you been watching the feeds?  Vanessa is leading the charge to get Audrey evicted.
BigBrother,3dqj91,Outburstz,-2,Sun Jul 19 02:06:09 2015 UTC,I'll believe it when I see it but from everything I've seen Van is going to keep noms the same and boot Jason out he door

BigBrother,3dqj91,Unknownrealm,9,Sun Jul 19 01:54:55 2015 UTC,2 hour veto tho. What type of comp is this endurance? Lol
BigBrother,3dqj91,v-r-s,6,Sun Jul 19 01:51:02 2015 UTC,Most likely one where they take turns individually as those tend to last a long time. Sorta along the lines of the Trampoline veto from BB15 or the Furniture veto from BBCAN3.
BigBrother,3dqj91,weso123,8,Sun Jul 19 01:54:39 2015 UTC,Unlikely unless they want to save Grodner faves PoVs are never endurance.
BigBrother,3dqj91,Unknownrealm,4,Sun Jul 19 01:53:40 2015 UTC,Yea I know was being sarcastic
BigBrother,3dqj91,mirjohns,9,Sun Jul 19 01:55:00 2015 UTC,Might have extras in it. The foam party took something like three hours and Austin said on feeds that it was because it took so long to coordinate all the extras.

BigBrother,3dqj91,AshamedFan,11,Sun Jul 19 01:41:44 2015 UTC,Hoping that James accidentally wins POV so we can watch him struggle with who to use it on
BigBrother,3dqj91,malevolentblob,11,Sun Jul 19 01:40:59 2015 UTC,"And only James would accidentally win a comp., lol."
BigBrother,3dqj91,DoesntGetYourJoke,5,Sun Jul 19 01:43:45 2015 UTC,"Why are the comps secret/unaired on the live feed? Can someone explain the logic? This is my first year watching the live stream so I still have some noob questions.   Edit: I would still watch the show anyway for diary bits and important conversations I missed and to see how they edited everything. Plus one of the three is the live eviction and HOH so why wouldn't you watch that one. I signed up expecting to see the comps live, just a little disappointed is all."
BigBrother,3dqj91,mja9678,8,Sun Jul 19 01:38:53 2015 UTC,"Besides the ""no one would watch"" reason, usually they spend a considerable amount of time going over the rules before hand. I'd imagine they also probably bring out cameramen to get some of the shots, the hose sometimes has to go over their lines more than once as well if they weren't delivered well enough the first time."
BigBrother,3dqj91,mirandaBBfan,5,Sun Jul 19 01:42:34 2015 UTC,Then I would literally never watch the episodes
BigBrother,3dqj91,TraverseTown,8,Sun Jul 19 01:41:03 2015 UTC,"The comps do not play out as straightforwardly as they do on the TV show. They often receive help or directions from production staff, which they don't want you to see.   However, if there is an on-going comp that began on the live show (often endurance or physical comp) they will show that on the live feeds after the conclusion of the show."

BigBrother,3dqj91,Hjkl94,6,Sun Jul 19 01:39:57 2015 UTC,So there's a reason to watch the show
BigBrother,3dqj91,tweefilteredfungus,8,Sun Jul 19 01:39:48 2015 UTC,Because otherwise no feeders would watch the episodes

BigBrother,3dqj91,Unknownrealm,5,Sun Jul 19 01:37:40 2015 UTC,What kind of comp do you guys think it is. Pretty long as of now probably not the counting one
BigBrother,3dqj91,TraverseTown,3,Sun Jul 19 01:36:13 2015 UTC,Something with punishments for sure. Guarantee the reason there haven't been Have Nots for the week yet is because they are going to give someone 24hr solitary confinement in the Have Not room.
BigBrother,3dqj91,alectronic,4,Sun Jul 19 01:31:55 2015 UTC,seems early for OTEV
BigBrother,3dqj91,Unknownrealm,2,Sun Jul 19 01:38:40 2015 UTC,Yea I deffinetly don't think its Otev. Maybe it's the one we're you run with the ball back and forth like a 100 times but I don't think it would take this long

BigBrother,3dqj91,intransit-,20,Sun Jul 19 01:19:35 2015 UTC,I wish there was some kinda text alert that we could sign up for so we would know when live feeds are back from comps. Everytime I look to see if they're back (I mute the sound) I always get super excited and than realize its still a jeff interview
BigBrother,3dqj91,NimbleMick,3,Sun Jul 19 01:31:54 2015 UTC,"I have the BB Buddy app.  It sends me notifications about noms, comp winners, and evictions. It's usually pretty quick as well.  Like within minutes of the feeds coming back."
BigBrother,3dqj91,TraverseTown,3,Sun Jul 19 01:14:14 2015 UTC,"There are some of those BB Twitter update accounts. During comps I would turn on notifications for those account on my mobile device and I'd get a pop-up notification alert on my phone, usually they tweet as soon as the feeds come back."
BigBrother,3dqj91,DoesntGetYourJoke,2,Sun Jul 19 01:35:47 2015 UTC,How do you turn on notifications for a single account?
BigBrother,3dqj91,TraverseTown,2,Sun Jul 19 01:20:05 2015 UTC,"On my iPhone Twitter app, you go to the profile you want to turn them on for, click the settings (gear) near their twitter handle and click ""turn on notifications""."

Is this true at all? Also what evidence did they give for coming to that conclusion?"
BigBrother,3dqj91,D64015,7,Sun Jul 19 01:18:43 2015 UTC,Austin told Jackie she was a pawn and then told James he was probably going up to do damage control with the other-side which makes his alliance upset.
BigBrother,3dqj91,ContagiousOptimism,3,Sun Jul 19 01:13:11 2015 UTC,But how does that lead to thinking he is working with Audrey?

BigBrother,3dqj91,harrisonscruff,13,Sun Jul 19 01:14:12 2015 UTC,It's kind of annoying how Shelli has decided she wants Jason to stay after putting him in this position. She should have never won HoH.
BigBrother,3dqj91,brightbase,21,Sun Jul 19 01:10:24 2015 UTC,Well she's allowed to change her mind. I'm sure Jason is happy that she decided to flip.
BigBrother,3dqj91,harrisonscruff,4,Sun Jul 19 01:01:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but either way if he ends up staying on the block there's a good chance he could go home. It's just annoying knowing this whole situation could've been avoided."
BigBrother,3dqj91,brightbase,4,Sun Jul 19 01:09:02 2015 UTC,"I think Jason would of went up anyways. They can't nominate Audrey straight up because she would have two chances to get off the block with the BOTB and veto. So either way, Shelli had to put someone up as a pawn."
BigBrother,3dqj91,harrisonscruff,2,Sun Jul 19 01:13:25 2015 UTC,"There's no guarantee he'd be up there with Audrey though. or that he'd even be safe if he was up there with Audrey. Shelli's mind is constantly changing, and a lot can happen in the next few days. It makes sense for Shelli to target Jason, but I just want her to make up her mind and stop flip-flopping because it's making this so much more stressful. lol  Also, the main reason Jason was put up was because of Clay."

I'm just gonna call her ass ""Grandma Question Mark"" ..... 🍷   I mean, I have absolutely no problem with her making game comments (which still come off as a bit bitter), but no need to make personal comments like that."
BigBrother,3dqj91,MrBigShot247,7,Sun Jul 19 01:41:44 2015 UTC,It's just a tad bit different when that typical live feeder was evicted literally 2 weeks ago and she constantly shits on the people that took her out fair and square.  How is that not obvious?

BigBrother,3dqj91,paultower,-2,Sun Jul 19 00:40:57 2015 UTC,They call her bitter AND salty. Mutual exclusivity. They can't even make up their minds.
BigBrother,3dqj91,MrBigShot247,6,Sun Jul 19 00:34:18 2015 UTC,"No, I'm pretty confident someone and something can be both bitter and salty with both literal meanings and slang meanings."

BigBrother,3dqj91,Johnnybombadil,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:30:05 2015 UTC,lol all these redditers so mad at Day I'm just wondering why yall following her on twitter if you don't like her that doesn't make sense
BigBrother,3dqj91,Outburstz,13,Sun Jul 19 00:40:03 2015 UTC,I find her bitterness very petty now that she's out but I liked her in the game because she was interesting. You see a lot of her bitter comments with the hashtag 'BB17' so I don't follow her and I'd assume a lot of others don't either.
BigBrother,3dqj91,Outburstz,-3,Sun Jul 19 00:31:51 2015 UTC,"Why does she have to like everyone in the house if she doesn't she is stating her opinion on what is going on in the house. Just because she was in there doesn't have to change that.  There are people that don't like Clay and Shellie Audrey or this 6th sense alliance.

BigBrother,3dra4a,ZeroCiipheR,26,Sat Jul 18 18:18:34 2015 UTC,"I'm also a Las Vegas based poker player and in the past Vanessa has always taken losing worse and harder than most other professional poker players. She could be emotionally volatile but she also may just be a sore loser of sorts.  I think back to how upset she got after the Austin veto loss to Johnny Mac, she doesn't seem great at handling things not going her way."
BigBrother,3dra4a,mbradycf,14,Sat Jul 18 19:20:33 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, she was pissed because Austin threw it, and she could tell he threw it. When she confronted him about it, he lied, to her face. The one guy she was trying to build a strong alliance with lied to her face. She had every right to be pissed for a bit."
BigBrother,3dra4a,SaraCastic,6,Sun Jul 19 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"This is a good point, I think most people would get emotional after being lied to, however I think she is capable of handling that situation better than she did.   Also as a side note it's hard to blame Austin for throwing that competition, it's a pretty rough spot to be the person who will directly keep Audrey off the block by keeping noms the same."
BigBrother,3dra4a,mbradycf,4,Sun Jul 19 01:45:57 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what it seems like.  When she's in control and something doesn't go her way, she goes ballistic.  When she's not in control she seems to be more stable  - other than her emotional first week."
BigBrother,3dra4a,chaz_batch,16,Sat Jul 18 20:18:47 2015 UTC,She is WAY too intense when she talks to people. If I was in that house I would feel uncomfortable around her and would probably want to target her.
BigBrother,3dra4a,magnog777,8,Sat Jul 18 19:38:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's a mix. She's consciously making emotional appeals to persuade people, but her actual emotions are being fucked with as much as everyone else's just from being in that madhouse."
BigBrother,3dra4a,Jotchee,2,Sat Jul 18 19:00:00 2015 UTC,Sure but I think being able to properly manage these emotions is part of having a good game. I like the idea of using emotional appeal to your advantage as long as you keep yourself in check/control.
BigBrother,3dra4a,BobbyOnTheRadio,11,Sat Jul 18 20:11:24 2015 UTC,"I think that's the question everyone has right now. The general consensus from unbiased people is that it is too early to tell for sure. She's either playing far too emotionally and not strategically at all (take calling Clay out for being a triplet for example), or she's a very good actor and is acting emotional for strategic reasons.  I think the only way to know for sure is to wait for more DR sessions from Vanessa. As much as we try to analyze the live feeds, there is always that possibility that the person is putting on a face for the house. DRs give you a baseline to compare her house behavior against. If she can explain her strategy logically and explain the emotions as game play, then good for her. If she can't, then I don't understand how she dotes herself on winning millions and studying game theory because her strategy has a major flaw.  (Then again, DRs are also susceptible to manipulation. Just look at Austin. He goes in to the DR and acts like he's the strategic master of the house but we all know from the live feeds that that is not the case.)"

And her super self centeredness is what makes her hilarious. Add to that that she is so clueless and lost but thinks she is doing good is funny. Her one liners weather they were intended to be funny or not are some of my favorite moments in big brother. She's an airhead but one that makes you feel for her and then instantly change your mind when she does something stupid. I love her though.

BigBrother,3dq05u,BadLuckGoodGenes,15,Sat Jul 18 09:10:30 2015 UTC,"As an Australian, I have to say that the production team on BBAU may be better (I especially like the fact that BB is one person who talks to them way more often than that of BBUS). The only downside to BBAU is that it requires NO strategical or physical skill to win. When it comes to nominations and eliminations, each player gets 5 points to use on two different players (4+1 or 3+2) at each nomination (occasionally there is a competition in which the housemates are spilt up into two groups and the losing group will all go up for nomination). The players (usually ~5) with the most nomination points are all up for nomination and the home viewers ring in and voting for who to save. Player with the least votes to stay is eliminated (lowest two are eliminated on double eviction nights). This means the winner is always the fan favourite (for example, Brittney Haynes would have won BBUS12 winner and Dan Gheesling wouldn't have even won if evictions were like BBAU). In BBAU, players are forbidden to speak about anything involving nominations outside the nomination room. There is also NO live feeds and the show is becoming more and more like a soap opera with a tinge of social experiment aspect (other than living in a house with 14 other housemates without electronics and communication to the outside world, it is basically a soap opera). Last years season had this blonde bimbo who was continuously saved by the viewers/voters just because she had tits and big ass, acted stupid and was funny to laugh at. I understand that that is what a large number of people love to watch, but I personally prefer watching Big Brother for strategical moves as well as the drama. On BBAU, there would never be players like Dr. Will or Dan who not only entertain the viewers, but do it in amazing ways. But I guess it is good for players who love watching people stuck inside a house for 3 months gossiping and having some laughs. A large part of BBAU is also relationships. There is also a relationship or two which are massive in the house (not only do they take up a large number of screen time, but also a massive factor in choosing the winner; One guy was fan favourite all season because he was funny af, yet when an intruder came into the house who he was crushing on, all he did was hang out with her for the rest of the season laying around, chatting and making out. It totally lost him the title).  TL:DR - Big Brother Australia is basically a soap opera and only requires houseguests to be funny and good looking. No strategic ability is needed, as there are NO HOH or Veto Comps and home viewers decide who stays and who goes by voting (via SMS). Only positives are that BB himself actually speaks with the HG much more and the food competitions are neat (which BBUS used to have and NEED to re-add)."
BigBrother,3dq05u,CaptaineAli,7,Sat Jul 18 13:16:04 2015 UTC,Don't talk shit about Skye.
BigBrother,3dq05u,libidinousgoat,8,Sat Jul 18 14:25:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but she was terrible. Literally all she would do was flop her ass around and was such an airhead. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate her because she is blonde, but she tried way to hard to use her body and her personality was over the top. At some stages you could tell she was being fake."

BigBrother,3dq05u,coconut311oil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:39:28 2015 UTC,"I also disliked Layla. And I don't see much difference between Skye and her. They both acted like bimbos and flaunted themselves around to get votes.   As for last seasons contestants, from day one I knew that Lawson, Ryan or Jake would have won. As soon as the other two got into relationships, I knew Ryan had it in the bag. Sportsbet was paying $4 for him to win ~2 weeks before the final and I won a few hundred dollars, it was extremely obvious what was going to happen. Similar thing with 2012 as well. Ben's only competition was Josh imo and he got evicted because he got boring once he started dating Ava. I just feel the American version is way better due to the aspect that they need to verse each other in competitions and they choose who stays and who goes, not viewers."
BigBrother,3dq05u,CaptaineAli,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:29:05 2015 UTC,"I guess the bimbo stuff doesn't bother me. It's the victim mentality from Layla that grated on me.  With Jake and Ryan, I thought one of them would win as well. Lawson had a chance until the Cat stuff got out of hand. So much cringe from all that lol. During Ben's season, I did not see him winning for the first half or so, and he grew on me, like I'm sure he did with so many other people. As for Josh, that guy was really likeable. I wish I were as easy-going as him."
BigBrother,3dq05u,coconut311oil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:10:56 2015 UTC,"Josh was the front runner to win his season. If he hadn't changed so much when he met Ava, he would have won it (although he left the house due to a relative passing away, so maybe not...), If BBAU was like BBUS, I would seriously consider applying for it down the line (as I'm only 18 & I feel I'd have more chances at around 22ish)."
BigBrother,3dq05u,CaptaineAli,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:56:56 2015 UTC,"Skye was kind of strategic in the house, when she saw people have conversations that could potentially air, she would sit close by and sing commercial music or strip naked to ensure production wouldn't air it"
BigBrother,3dq05u,pawnstache,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:28:04 2015 UTC,"Being strategic on BBUS = Dr. Will or Derrick manipulating the crap out of every other houseguest.   Being strategic on BBAU = taking up most of the screen time and trying your best to stop others get their time.  It just goes to show you how the show is. I'd take watching Derrick and Chill Town over Skye, Travis, Ryan or anyone from previous BBAU seasons. But I guess that is just my opinion. I know there are funny and good-looking people out there in the world, but thats not what I want to watch, I prefer strategising and competing like in BBUS. And this is coming from an Australian who only started watching BBUS 2 years ago."
BigBrother,3dq05u,CaptaineAli,3,Sun Jul 19 14:37:14 2015 UTC,"What irks me the most is that as something (BBAU, BBUK, etc.) that depends on public perception to influence the ""game"", it's arguably more important to have live feeds than BBUS. It's funny that you mention Skye using her body, though, considering she would allegedly strip down in order to prevent the conversations she wanted from going on tv.   One guy was fan favourite all season because he was funny af, yet  when an intruder came into the house who he was crushing on, all he did was hang out with her for the rest of the season laying around, chatting and making out. It totally lost him the title).   Last year? I don't remember, who're you talking about?"
BigBrother,3dq05u,pletar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"Oh my bad, I was referring to Josh from a previous season (who got with Ava and his personality died, then he was eliminated). But it sort of happened last season as well, with Lawson and Jake. They were both extremely funny and were front runners for the title, but lost because they got involved with girls (Lawson's cheating on his girlfriend from the outside lost it for him and as with Jake, who was hilarious in the first few weeks but lost his fans after falling for Skye than making out with to Lisa; since so many people liked Skye he lost the votes from her fans).   Similar things happened with Layla and Sam from previous seasons too, once he joined the house, all she did was lay around with him and lost some votes for not being one of the outgoing and talkative people in the house. I disliked her either way, and i think she shouldn't of gone as far as she did (I think she was final two?), so I guess some people may have liked the romantic/dating drama, but in most instances it just makes the interesting person lay around and get more boring and lose votes."
BigBrother,3dq05u,CaptaineAli,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:39:11 2015 UTC,That is how I feel about Big Brother UK too. Its okay to watch I you like drama more then game play. For example the Celeb BBUK season with Prez Hilton but it can get old really fast because you know what person is going to go all the time. That is usually the person that is hated in the house or the person that is boring.

With BBAU, I even bet on the winner with and won a few hundred dollars because it was extremely obvious who was going to win (i bet 2 weeks prior to finale night). I would LOVE BBAU to add HOH, Vetos and nominations and evictions purely from the housemates themselves. It would be way more interesting and I think there is a good amount of money in it too, if it was to happen."

An 'under the radar' player will play a similar game on the surface but will clue viewers in via the DR and the feeds.   They will consciously choose to flip between sides of the house and have rationale for their choice.  They will tell us that they are staying under the radar and give examples.
BigBrother,3dpfb7,diary_room,19,Sat Jul 18 05:08:55 2015 UTC,"I second this. Floaters are just physically present and breezing in the game. ""Under the radar"" place themselves in a position where they wouldn't be viewed as a good choice for an HOH to target due to it being a ""waste of an HOH reign"".

You can probably blame Rachel for that, whose definition was practically ""someone that Rachel Reilly didn't like."""
BigBrother,3dpfb7,ndralcasid,6,Sat Jul 18 07:06:56 2015 UTC,Can we just agree that Rachel is the worst person to happen to BB ever cause she took every word in the game that is used for anyone to mean anyone she didn't like.

Also Rachel was someone who was really entertaining in the fact she was easy to ""love to hate"". She also did have some funny lines as well. I don't mind her for the entertainment factor.

BigBrother,3dpfb7,PankaPanka,11,Sat Jul 18 18:07:40 2015 UTC,"I find it annoying how many people misinterpret the term floater because of Rachel. Before Rachel, floating was a legitimate strategy which involved having no real alliance, but ""floating"" between alliances and giving your loyalty to whoever is in power. The most successful examples are probably Jun and Andy. However now many people think that anyone who isn't playing the game to be a floater. For example, many say that Jocasta or Victoria were floaters because they weren't playing a strong strategic/physical game but they didnt have enough self awareness to be considered floaters and they were both loyal to a certain group."
BigBrother,3dpfb7,TvP1999,9,Sat Jul 18 10:19:01 2015 UTC,"Very very short answer: BB16 has a perfect example. Victoria was a floater, and Derrick played under the radar"

In the jury house you have a lot more chances to compare notes and gameplay with each other so yeah they probably realized that Derrick really was more involved in the game than they thought, but at that point all it really did was secure the fact that he played a really smooth game."
BigBrother,3dpfb7,lannyd28,9,Sat Jul 18 23:09:20 2015 UTC,"Why are Jackie and Becky considered floaters but Johnny Mac is not for some reason?   Except he is a floater, with no real strong ties to any particular alliance. Considering he's being put up constantly and asked to throw stuff, I wouldn't exactly say he's flying under the radar, there's simply bigger fish to fry.  The terms aren't mutually exclusive."
BigBrother,3dpfb7,HeliusAurelius,2,Sat Jul 18 05:09:28 2015 UTC,I agree. He is definitely not under the radar. Everyone realizes by now that he's a competition threat.
BigBrother,3dpfb7,BobbyOnTheRadio,13,Sat Jul 18 18:10:45 2015 UTC,You can be an UTR player and be in an alliance and be loyal to it.  You aren't floating but you're under the radar.  A floater has either no or a lot of alliances they have no loyalty to.  Jun was a floater in BB4 and completely aware of how she was playing.  Whereas Jack was flying UTR but he was clearly loyal to non Exes and more specifically Erika.  Just because you're UTR or a floater doesn't mean you're a bad player. Jun still flew UTR in S4 while pulling string and Ali was floating she was the loudest HG in that season.   Why are Jackie and Becky considered floaters but Johnny Mac is not for some reason?   They all are considered floaters and they're flying UTR.
BigBrother,3dpfb7,MasterofMarionettes,3,Sat Jul 18 05:33:23 2015 UTC,To me a floater is someone who is not actively tied down in any strong loyalities or alliances.  They go pretty much where ever the current takes them.  They're always willing to throw their vote to whoever is most popular/powerful to survive.  Someone who is playing UTR could actually have alliances and loyalties but they are still trying to not make waves so they avoid taking a leardship role and basically just nod their head and smile with the rest of the decsions everyone is making.  They don't really talk game unless they absolutely have to.  Their strategy is more intentional.
BigBrother,3dpfb7,HouseFareye,3,Sat Jul 18 06:07:30 2015 UTC,I think this would be a helpful glossary:  coaster - plays with little effort  coattail rider - follows someone else's orders  double dealer - has conflicting alliances  flipper - defects from one alliance to another  floater - lacks permanent alliances  rat - routinely leaks secrets  UTR - deliberately avoids attention
BigBrother,3dpfb7,StarfishSupreme,5,Sat Jul 18 21:40:23 2015 UTC,Personally I think it's what happens later. If Becky comes in with five weeks left and is a comp beast and starts strategizing and becomes social and getting out her opponents she's utr. But if she continues on her path until she's evicted she's a floater
BigBrother,3dpfb7,square_root_of_jason,7,Sat Jul 18 06:26:54 2015 UTC,"I always viewed floaters as  People who go from one alliance to another,vote with the house,etc.  Under-the-radar is not speaking about game whatsoever,cue everyone in on what there doing,etc."
BigBrother,3dpfb7,Misunderestimated12,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:31:19 2015 UTC,"I think your definition of under the radar is wrong. The very term under the radar implies that they are making moves that should register on someone's radar, but aren't being registered. People who are under the radar are actively making moves, alliances, etc. but the other HGs aren't taking note of just how powerful they are."
BigBrother,3dpfb7,BobbyOnTheRadio,4,Sat Jul 18 08:42:57 2015 UTC,"A floater would be Jackie, Jocasta or Victoria. Somebody who has no clue what's going on. Someone staying under the radar would be Andy, Jun, etc. Someone who's actual strategy involves not being caught up in everything. Floating used to mean something completely different until Rachel came along."
BigBrother,3dpfb7,Zack_Shikari,4,Sat Jul 18 18:14:11 2015 UTC,I thought Jun invented the floater
BigBrother,3dpfb7,Jonazq,3,Sat Jul 18 05:43:41 2015 UTC,Floating used to mean something completely different until Rachel came along.
BigBrother,3dpfb7,Zack_Shikari,3,Sat Jul 18 07:12:30 2015 UTC,Johnny Mac was a strange example to use... He has won three competitions in three weeks.   Was season 14's Frank a floater because his social game sucked?
BigBrother,3dpfb7,Urban_Forest,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:34:48 2015 UTC,"Frank didn't have a poor social game, he was just on the wrong side of the house most of the time."
BigBrother,3dpfb7,RossSpecter,3,Sat Jul 18 05:55:32 2015 UTC,Rachel screwed up everyone's definition of the term. Floaters move back and forth to power regardless of alliance. (clay/Sheeli/Audrey) Under the radar stay away from the drama and wait for others to ruin their own game (Becky/John/Venessa)
BigBrother,3dpfb7,Letmeseeyourprops,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"I would not put Shelli in the floater category. For more than two weeks, she has consistently told Clay they need to pick a side. She has clearly picked the Vanessa/Austin side of the house and that won't change until James, Meg, Jason, and Jackie are out OR until someone goes after her and Clay. Additionally, she has continued to make big moves that went against the house's wishes with her HOHs."
BigBrother,3dpfb7,BobbyOnTheRadio,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:08:41 2015 UTC,She picked the James/Jason side week one when they were in power them week 3 Vanessa is in power and BOOM  lets do the Vanessa/Austin thing. Until someone like Meg gets HOH and they don't turn on people I'll stick with the floater claim.
BigBrother,3dpfb7,Letmeseeyourprops,2,Sat Jul 18 18:16:06 2015 UTC,"Week one she was with James/Jason because of Clay. Week 2 she went against the wishes of James and Jason and evicted their closest ally Da'Vonne. That is when she realized her personal game plan more closely resembled Austin and Vanessa's and that is when she switched sides. Week three, she again helped deliver a fatal blow to the James, Jason, Meg side by evicting Jeff. Week four, she's again favoring Austin and Vanessa and targeting floaters or the other side of the house. If you don't think her allegiance is clearly to Austin, Liz, and Vanessa, you're insane.  Just because she wasn't with Austin and Vanessa the first week doesn't mean she's a floater. If you remember, Vanessa wasn't even with Austin until week 2."
BigBrother,3dpfb7,BobbyOnTheRadio,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:18:09 2015 UTC,I don't think her allegiance is to anyone but clay and rightfully so.
BigBrother,3dpfb7,Letmeseeyourprops,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:28:02 2015 UTC,"Her allegiance is definitely to Clay. But you can't deny that she's picked the Vanessa/Austin side of the house and she's sticking to it. You could make the argument that Clay hasn't, but Shelli most definitely has."

BigBrother,3dpfb7,white_trash_hero,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:29:04 2015 UTC,"Floaters tend to kiss ass to whoever is in power each week, which is why they're not seen as very loyal and aren't considered trustworthy."
BigBrother,3dpfb7,cruncheweesy,2,Sat Jul 18 20:51:10 2015 UTC,"A Floater is a person that goes right to whoever is in power at the time, regardless of the alliance they are in or the person in power is in and says/does whatever they want to save their own game regardless of their alliance and who they ""throw under the bus"" (I hate that saying now!). A Floater can win HOH, they just don't need to float to the power that time as they are the power, but still can float to people they think is in power to tell them what to do. A floater can win Veto, they will float to whoever is in power to figure out how the power wants the veto used.  Sadly now Rachels Definition of a floater is what people THINK is the definition. Her definition of a floater is whoever was against her and never won comps.   People are confusing floaters with people that are just ""there"" such as people like Victoria. Floating is part of a strategy and she had none.  Daniele Donato talks about floaters a little bit as well in this interview here at the 4:30 mark"
BigBrother,3dpfb7,GoatTit,0,Sat Jul 18 21:13:38 2015 UTC,Often Floaters have no real alliances...they may think they do...but they're rarely involved in serious strategy/decision making.  A floater making it to the end like say Victoria- thought she was an Under the radar player...but to the jury...she was a floater
BigBrother,3dpfb7,HallandOates1,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:26:49 2015 UTC,Playing under the radar does not mean not making alliances and having no game talks... under the radar players DO make alliances/connections and have some quiet game talk. See: Derrick.  Floaters and under the radar players are very clearly different to me.
BigBrother,3dpfb7,mirandaBBfan,-3,Sat Jul 18 07:08:24 2015 UTC,"Tldr;  Under radar means they've caused a tussle so far it's only Audrey.  Floaters would be jmac, becky, steve, jackie..

You can't do what Canadians do and buy an AMEX gift card at a shop (since ours are UK cards), so you really don't have many options.  In my case, I sent an American friend some money and they set up an account for me with their details and card.

BigBrother,3dp0j2,jennymaecry,13,Sat Jul 18 14:36:38 2015 UTC,Catching up on last night. How does Steve not know who Kurt Cobain is
BigBrother,3dp0j2,RumGuy,-8,Sat Jul 18 13:58:47 2015 UTC,Dude is a certified idiot that can't read
BigBrother,3dp0j2,HiSoArshavin,5,Sat Jul 18 13:40:52 2015 UTC,"Umm actually he was a roomate of a close friend of mines at Cornell University, wihic is an Ivy league school before he transferred. Im sure he reads just fine. he just id super into Computer science and engineering, and those fields dont require any social acumen"
BigBrother,3dp0j2,RumGuy,-10,Sat Jul 18 14:07:03 2015 UTC,"Cool story. As long as we're being full of shit to each other, Steve was also my cousin Andy Bernard's frat bro at Cornell University and he told me straight up that he couldn't read"
BigBrother,3dp0j2,HiSoArshavin,4,Sat Jul 18 15:18:10 2015 UTC,Except my story is true...and yours isn.   Not to mention the fact that anybody at an Ivy League school is likely to be a better reader than 90% of of students their age.... but whatever
BigBrother,3dp0j2,RumGuy,-6,Sat Jul 18 15:40:49 2015 UTC,90% of the time statistics are made up on the spot

BigBrother,3dp0j2,HiSoArshavin,4,Sat Jul 18 15:48:47 2015 UTC,haha dont be a troll...  Just look at the SAT Verbal/ ACT Reading Comprehension scores for all of the IVy league schools and and look at the percentiles....nothing is being made up other than your ignorance concerning the matter
BigBrother,3dp0j2,tr0nllam,17,Sat Jul 18 17:17:16 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure a unfrozen caveman would have more pop culture knowledge than Steve.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,MrBigShot247,8,Sat Jul 18 15:57:18 2015 UTC,You guys are overestimating Audrey's credibility in the house
BigBrother,3dp0j2,chargingmoose,19,Sat Jul 18 13:46:15 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on the nights events: Shlay, Vanessa, Austin, Liz/Julia all made the mistake of trusting Audrey with even the smallest amount of information and are now realizing they are screwed if they backdoor Audrey. This is where Shlay's alliances with Austin and Vanessa will fall apart. They know in the long run Vanessa is not afraid to backdoor them. So now if they strike first at Austin it'll leave Vanessa on an island. Then Shlay has the ability to strengthen a relationship with the rest of the house by saving Jason or JMac. This would be a good move for Shlay.  I just hate that it means Audrey would stay in the house at least another week..."
BigBrother,3dp0j2,The-Red-Comet,6,Sat Jul 18 13:28:13 2015 UTC,So why does Shelli not want Jason to go?  Who does she think he would target if Audrey left?
BigBrother,3dp0j2,gritner91,12,Sat Jul 18 13:20:27 2015 UTC,He said his targets are Austin Audrey and Stevd to her. 2 people she would love to have out and 1 she wouldn't really care if he left.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,3st3ph3n3,10,Sat Jul 18 13:15:42 2015 UTC,"If they backdoor Audrey she will expose Sleeper Cell to the rest of the house and make Shelli/Clay huge targets for next week. While they haven't kept her totally in the loop, I think she knows enough to destroy their game."
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Flatfishh,3,Sat Jul 18 13:32:15 2015 UTC,"They have already discussed this and agreed to downplay it if she reveals it. Audrey made so many alliances in that first week that any alliances she has have no credibility. Austin mentioned ""cloud town"" and they can just play it off as a similar situation and that it is now defunct."
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Emma__I,3,Sat Jul 18 13:09:57 2015 UTC,i think they said they don't care if audrey exposes them because audrey lies so much and no one would believe her.

BigBrother,3dp0j2,tweefilteredfungus,8,Sat Jul 18 10:47:55 2015 UTC,Shelli's losing patience with Audrey and fair enough to be honest.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,tweefilteredfungus,4,Sat Jul 18 10:44:26 2015 UTC,I'm going to be so sad for Jason re. his employment status if he gets evicted this week.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,harrisonscruff,5,Sat Jul 18 10:43:03 2015 UTC,Audrey has become more annoying than entertaining at this point. We're just going to keep seeing this same conversation over and over again.

BigBrother,3dp0j2,investhrow,6,Sat Jul 18 10:35:57 2015 UTC,it must be exhausting having to emotionally babysit Audrey all the time. I wouldn't do it. I would have just let her feel like shit.

BigBrother,3dp0j2,ritoky,9,Sat Jul 18 10:32:31 2015 UTC,Shelli would have been better served tonight taking a page from Zach from last season. Just go to sleep. She has done nothing good for her game by staying awake while at wits end tonight.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,tweefilteredfungus,3,Sat Jul 18 10:32:22 2015 UTC,Whoever said that Shelli plays like Dawn played in Caramoan was spot on.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Zero_Heart,0,Sat Jul 18 10:25:24 2015 UTC,Dawn played a terrible game that basically handed the game over to Cochran. I don't feel many can win against Shelli at this point.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,phone101,2,Sat Jul 18 10:28:39 2015 UTC,Dawn played an incredibly cutthroat game and really only lost because the jury couldn't accept that a motherly figure could play that kind of game and just voted for Cochran because they thought he was running things.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,tweefilteredfungus,3,Sat Jul 18 10:24:16 2015 UTC,"I should've been more clear - I don't think Shelli's necessarily playing a game that will parallel Dawn's exact game in Caramoan, but that she's playing in a similar way to Dawn. Being the mother figure, not wanting to backstab people, making good game relationships founded on friendship, worrying about other people's feelings etc."
BigBrother,3dp0j2,genniside538,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:21:11 2015 UTC,Dawn was kind of blood thirsty in Caramoan. I see Shelli as the SP Dawn BUT with Caramoan Dawn's power position.

BigBrother,3dp0j2,Carnauba,3,Sat Jul 18 15:49:39 2015 UTC,"Anyone know what this ""Jason thing"" is that Audrey is referring to?"
BigBrother,3dp0j2,JudasKandinsky,8,Sat Jul 18 10:29:11 2015 UTC,Shelli accidentally told Jason that Jeff and Audrey said that Jason was targeting Clay/Shelli. Audrey was upset because this made Jason think that Audrey was responsible for him being nominated. Audrey thought that the slip-up was a calculated move by Shelli to place the target on her. Something like that.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Zero_Heart,9,Sat Jul 18 14:51:04 2015 UTC,It seems every week Jackie says she will start playing next week.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,DizzyedUpGirl,3,Sat Jul 18 10:20:26 2015 UTC,"But no, really, next week."
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Hostik,10,Sat Jul 18 10:10:02 2015 UTC,and win HoH and punish the infidels or whatever
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Zero_Heart,6,Sat Jul 18 10:14:52 2015 UTC,I know it's not true but shouldn't they think there aren't have-nots because no one failed the parties from last week?
BigBrother,3dp0j2,chaz_batch,5,Sat Jul 18 10:09:57 2015 UTC,They believe have-nots will be punishments in the veto competition
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Phase_Six,4,Sat Jul 18 10:15:49 2015 UTC,Audrey and Steve in the same conversation is almost too much awkwardness for my brain to process.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Zero_Heart,13,Sat Jul 18 10:11:10 2015 UTC,If they believe America's player can't tell anyone they should just have everyone round up and say 'I am America's player' and if someone gets taken out then they know it was them and if no one is then there is none.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,EchelonHD,3,Sat Jul 18 10:03:47 2015 UTC,Great outside of the box thinking! But using production as a strategy is against the rules.  I think they would either let America's player slide or interrupt the entire session on the intercom.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Hostik,6,Sat Jul 18 10:09:50 2015 UTC,"what if America's Player is not a moron and says it with everyone, and then in DR rationally explain that it was the only logical way of protecting the secret."
BigBrother,3dp0j2,JudasKandinsky,49,Sat Jul 18 10:02:16 2015 UTC,Jackie: It's weird that there aren't any huge alliances... unless there are and I'm not a part of it.

BigBrother,3dp0j2,Substance59,4,Sat Jul 18 11:11:58 2015 UTC,2:45 cam 1/2 - is steve playing clay/shelli about lying about his vote to keep jeff?
BigBrother,3dp0j2,scruubb,14,Sat Jul 18 10:07:10 2015 UTC,Stefan voted to evict James. Steve had no idea.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,DizzyedUpGirl,3,Sat Jul 18 09:52:55 2015 UTC,Maybe. Maybe he's trying to throw Liz UTB. Maybe he doesn't know he voted Jeff. We'll find out Sunday.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Zero_Heart,4,Sat Jul 18 14:37:18 2015 UTC,We aren't voting on anything of value.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,bulnreinhart,6,Sat Jul 18 09:47:27 2015 UTC,So what happens if meg wins pov and saves jason?
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Hostik,-1,Sat Jul 18 10:19:04 2015 UTC,"but that would be bad for Meg's game, so far she's not anyone's radar, but this way the majority of the house will get angry at her. I'm sure she'll not sacrifice her game, even for Jason."
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Zero_Heart,2,Sat Jul 18 10:00:50 2015 UTC,They are saying Audrey but I think Becky would probably go home.

BigBrother,3dp0j2,Carnauba,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:36:41 2015 UTC,last night Meg had the time wrong by two hours as well...maybe they're clock is screwed up lol
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Cdtco,5,Sat Jul 18 10:25:40 2015 UTC,Oh-hoh-hoh. BBCAN3 set the clock back and forth on purpose. Maybe they're starting to follow suit to keep in line with all of the craziness so far this season.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Carnauba,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:31:03 2015 UTC,Its 3:12 and they said it's 3:00 so they're just bad at keeping track it seems

BigBrother,3dp0j2,bbbebee,-1,Sat Jul 18 09:25:46 2015 UTC,I think Steve is cool and attractive. Maybe people just really should be more upfront with him and tell him what to do and what not to do.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Hostik,3,Sat Jul 18 09:28:15 2015 UTC,maybe he should come with a manual
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Cdtco,3,Sat Jul 18 10:17:03 2015 UTC,Does Audrey ever NOT put her glasses above her forehead? I see them there more often than not.
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Zero_Heart,8,Sat Jul 18 09:15:36 2015 UTC,"Part of me wants to see them backdoor Audrey only to have Jason win HOH and end up putting Shelli and Clay up somehow. They're being a little too naive to believe Jason won't come after them, Especially since everyone is looking for reasons this season and he has multiple reasons for Shelli to go up even as a pawn, Not to mention he told Shelli straight up that he wants everyone to be on the block at some point so no one can say they were never nominated."
BigBrother,3dp0j2,scruubb,3,Sat Jul 18 09:15:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think they are opposed to going on the block. I think they are opposed to being backdoored. I mean, it's part of the game to go on the block. If they know that, and Jason is upfront with his reasoning and plans, I wouldn't be concerned. It sure as hell beats Audrey throwing their names out under the radar."
BigBrother,3dp0j2,Zero_Heart,3,Sat Jul 18 09:24:59 2015 UTC,"What makes you think Jason wouldn't target Shelli though? She took out Day, Put him on the block, Part of a power couple, won two HOHs, and is just a good player that he knows isn't playing with him. Despite not being able to trust Audrey they can trust that no one else trusts her either and that she wouldn't target them and probably get out Becky which would actually be useful."
BigBrother,3dp0j2,scruubb,3,Sat Jul 18 09:10:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of that is true. But if the plan goes as anticipated by putting up Audrey, Shay would use this as an olive branch. Jason doesn't seem to hold a grudge against Shelli, moreso blaming Audrey. I think it would be smart for Shelli to make a deal with him before she puts up Audrey--similar to the deal Jason made with Vanessa. He promised her the next time he won HOH (regardless of week), he wouldn't go after her. I don't have a problem with him targeting her down the line, but it just wouldn't be smart to go after someone who could be a potential ally when in his mind, there are still bigger fish on the other side. Only time will tell, but it'll take some smart dealing from Shelli as well."
BigBrother,3dp0j2,chaz_batch,4,Sat Jul 18 09:04:39 2015 UTC,I'd love to see Jason win it and put up Liz and then go on a Vanessa type inquest to find out who all knew the actual twins... He'd be like... Bitch don't tell me you dint know about no twins!!
BigBrother,3dp0j2,scruubb,6,Sat Jul 18 09:09:32 2015 UTC,"Damn, I don't think I've ever seen Audrey shower downstairs. This is a first"
BigBrother,3dp0j2,mirandaBBfan,6,Sat Jul 18 09:16:53 2015 UTC,it's because she rarely showers
BigBrother,3dnyyl,histronic,127,Fri Jul 17 20:39:20 2015 UTC,"I think she's somewhat flattered that a guy in there is openly hitting on her, even if she's not interested in him. Look at how giddy and excited she is telling Clay. Deep down James is making her feel like like ""just one of the girls"", so I think that's why she's okay with it."
BigBrother,3dnyyl,Kmart_Elvis,43,Fri Jul 17 21:44:26 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love Audrey as a person, I would love to get to know her better. At least from what I've seen so far from the feeds. However when it comes to her gameplay, it could use a little work IMO."
BigBrother,3dnyyl,Angel_Echelon,17,Fri Jul 17 23:03:24 2015 UTC,"I love her game play, she is evil dick meets chaos. I think she has a good chance at winning actually. People don't want to take her out now as ""there are bigger fish to fry"" after a jury starts she will become the victory/GM who will get dragged to the end as everyone will think that at F2 they can beat her for $500,000. If she delivers a speech outlining all the chaos she caused the entire time as a ""game player"" who knows.  Plus the drama she stirs up is feed gold."
BigBrother,3dnyyl,BBRB,8,Sat Jul 18 00:52:31 2015 UTC,"True, I agree she will make it to the end, but I was at the edge of my seat today when she was ""arguing"" with Shelli. I'm also glad you didn't say people are too scared to evict her because she is transgender, I'm very tired of reading that over and over again."
BigBrother,3dnyyl,Angel_Echelon,6,Sat Jul 18 01:05:10 2015 UTC,"And totally untrue. It's Vanessa's excuse for when she was trying to get out Jeff. Somehow, people took a lie Vanessa told and extrapolated it to be a true thing everyone thinks."
BigBrother,3dnyyl,Benislav,-1,Sat Jul 18 09:35:36 2015 UTC,Yes that's tiered I agree.
BigBrother,3dnyyl,BBRB,2,Sat Jul 18 02:40:33 2015 UTC,No way she makes F2 unless she starts winning some comps.
BigBrother,3dnyyl,smokebreak,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"This is true. She could go this week for that reason.   However, let's say it's her and JMac on the block. When will the house have a chance to get JMac out again? He could win the game. Audry has no chance of winning and will be the target again next week. So why vote out her, when voting out JMac buys you another week in the house?"
BigBrother,3dnyyl,BBRB,3,Sat Jul 18 23:38:01 2015 UTC,"Yes I think if the weeks play out as they are currently, and Audrey keeps escaping, she's gonna end up winning. While not exactly the same, and she's no Dr. Will, it's a similar kind of game to Dr. Will's season 2 game."
BigBrother,3dnyyl,SawRub,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:20:22 2015 UTC,I haven't been able to watch much feeds in the past week and half. How much much shit is she actually stirring up? I don't expect her to be able to cause as much Chaos as she did in week one.
BigBrother,3dnyyl,Cremdian,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:43:09 2015 UTC,Basically every Monday after POV is played she goes on a Crey Crey rampage. usually turning on the people who protected her the week before. But generally every conversation she has she is spreading rumors or working hard to build mistrust in the house.
BigBrother,3dnyyl,BBRB,8,Sat Jul 18 23:35:03 2015 UTC,"Good for her, she needs something to make her happy and tone down her crazy"

BigBrother,3dnyyl,Zralok,5,Sat Jul 18 02:15:07 2015 UTC,"But it wasn't in a game way. It was a ""I can't believe he was hitting on me"" way. Like, you can imagine her having that same reaction even outside of the house."
BigBrother,3dnyyl,BaltimoreAubrey,19,Sat Jul 18 04:36:52 2015 UTC,"I think she also said ""I'll flirt with him if I have to"" so this is a nice diversion for Audrey.  At the very least, it might get her to leave Clay and Shelli alone more if she is busy elsewhere."
BigBrother,3dnyyl,ronscot,30,Fri Jul 17 21:57:22 2015 UTC,I'm more amazed that Austin is actually wearing clothes in this video.

BigBrother,3dnyyl,Colts1984,15,Fri Jul 17 22:55:45 2015 UTC,No. It's weird that he asks if she squirts whilst hitting on her. lol
BigBrother,3dnyyl,zipsgirl4life,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:31:21 2015 UTC,Did he really? Didn't see that. That is weird
BigBrother,3dnyyl,Colts1984,17,Sat Jul 18 00:38:39 2015 UTC,He did not ask that. That was the Audrey filter at work.
BigBrother,3dnyyl,Midaech,9,Sat Jul 18 01:00:19 2015 UTC,"He didn't use the word squirt. He asked what it's like when she climaxes. And, yes, that's a weird way to hit on someone. Edit to Add: I don't actually think he was hitting on her necessarily. I think he's genuinely curious ... But his awkward responses to her answers to his awkward questions may have come across as hitting on her ... Like, ""OK, cool ... Cool. Good to know,"" sort of reads like he's filing this away for the first time they have sex."
BigBrother,3dnyyl,zipsgirl4life,9,Sat Jul 18 01:11:37 2015 UTC,100%. she makes it sound like he was borderline vulgar. his language was clinical. he never said 'cum' either. audrey is consciously twisting his demeanor to make her story seem more plausible.
BigBrother,3dnyyl,picolas,4,Sat Jul 18 01:58:34 2015 UTC,"He didn't say it in those exact words, he asked if she climaxes the same as a biological woman."
BigBrother,3dnyyl,MedukaXHomora,4,Sat Jul 18 00:42:19 2015 UTC,"Yea to be fair, he obviously doesn't know much about people like Audrey and I cannot blame him for wanting to know before trying to get with her. But you are right, he shouldn't be asking them at the same time. Maybe find out first and ask/hit on her a few days later."
BigBrother,3dnyyl,CaptaineAli,2,Sat Jul 18 01:00:49 2015 UTC,I could understand how (unfortunately) Audrey might find it unusual for guys to hit on her.

BigBrother,3dnyyl,CaitlynnJenner,-57,Fri Jul 17 23:25:39 2015 UTC,I think its weird for a straight guy to like a guy with a mutilated penis.
BigBrother,3dnyyl,GurkleGurkle,10,Fri Jul 17 22:07:39 2015 UTC,She is a beautiful woman full of courage. I guess you must hate that with your mindset she is always going to be a better person than you.
BigBrother,3dnyyl,CaitlynnJenner,-40,Fri Jul 17 22:59:14 2015 UTC,I don't have a problem with Audrey. I'm just not gonna pretend he's a woman because he chopped up his penis.  Tofu that emulates meat is still tofu.
BigBrother,3dnyyl,GurkleGurkle,10,Fri Jul 17 23:23:54 2015 UTC,She was a woman even before she had sex reassignment surgery :)
BigBrother,3dnyyl,CanadianWizardess,-25,Fri Jul 17 23:45:23 2015 UTC,I was under the assumption he went from a guy to a pretend woman. He actually went from a woman with an accidental penis to a woman with a fake vagina?  To put it as simple as possible.
BigBrother,3dnyyl,GurkleGurkle,5,Sat Jul 18 00:27:11 2015 UTC,She has always been a woman. She was born a woman. Random fact: Didn't you know that all embryos actually begin as women?

For example, I would find it entirely inappropriate to ask to ask a trans co-worker or a trans person at a party about the surgical details of their transition (as you wouldn't ask a co-worker or person at a party about their genitals). Laverne Cox has compellingly spoken about keeping the focus on the trans experience.   That said, I don't think this is inappropriate (though it's uncomfortable at times). He's curious, he knows Audrey well, and the houseguests have ample time to discuss personal details. Audrey drew the line where she didn't want to speak, which she had every right to do."

You are 100% correct in that this is a new thing and people are going to be interested and want to learn more about it.  This woman went on a reality tv game show and used her ""transgender"" angle as her gimmick.  She completely opened herself up to this and is obviously handling this like an adult.  I find it incredibly respectable.   We live in a world where a SC country boy is able to have a genuine conversation with someone who is transgender.  Why the hell are people bothered by this?    Doesn't it come off as weird?"
BigBrother,3dnks7,Ninjabackwards,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:25:44 2015 UTC,It is an extremely common complaint within the transgender community that people focus FAR too much on genitalia when asking questions about the transgender experience. It's understandable that that is what people are curious about but you have to put yourselves in the shoes of a trans person who has to constantly answer questions about what their vag looks like. Come on. Think about it.   Obviously this situation is different because they are roommates and close friends but you have to understand where the sensitivity comes from.

BigBrother,3dnks7,ronscot,3,Fri Jul 17 21:45:56 2015 UTC,She did not HAVE to go on the show.  They could have found someone else who was transgender and willing to be open about it.  Where are you even getting this idea she was forced into it?  I would love a source on this.

Audrey's just like any other person in the sense that invasive climax questions are awkward and hard to answer on a live stream.

BigBrother,3dq7vc,edmc2,8,Sat Jul 18 11:26:30 2015 UTC,"It used to be like that with the Silver veto. But for the past ten years it's been a golden veto, so neither X or Y can be nominated. There's also a diamond veto but I can't remember what that does.  Edit: the diamond power of veto allows the veto holder to name the replacement nominee."
BigBrother,3dq7vc,millennialist,14,Sat Jul 18 13:00:47 2015 UTC,"Diamond POV allows the winner to make the renomination, not the HOH. So you could be nominated, win DPOV, then put whoever you want in your place (except, of course, the HOH).  Personally, I love this twist and think it should make a comeback every once in a while."
BigBrother,3dq7vc,Firate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:06:54 2015 UTC,"Yea me too, the only thing is, it is a massive game changer. It can be used to make a massive competitor go home. Even with HOH safe, there are multiple other players who could be nominated which could still leave 2 major players on the block."
BigBrother,3dq7vc,CaptaineAli,5,Sat Jul 18 13:21:15 2015 UTC,"It can be used to make a massive competitor go home.   Well BB12 Matt used his DPOV on Kathy, so that's not always the case lol.   Even with HOH safe, there are multiple other players who could be nominated which could still leave 2 major players on the block.   Yes, but this is the same as any other regular POV, it just depends on whether or not the HOH wants to make a big move.  And btw, when I say I like the DPOV, I'm saying there should be special weeks where they play for DPOV instead of regular POV, not having DPOV be an additional/hidden power like Matt's was BB12."
BigBrother,3dq7vc,Firate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:24:36 2015 UTC,"Well BB12 Matt used his DPOV on Kathy, so that's not always the case lol.   Oh of course not, but it easily could be used to get rid of someone really strong. Of course I would like to see it back in the game, but it should only appear once a season, twice at the max. And if it appears in final 6, it is a little too overpowered.   And btw, when I say I like the DPOV, I'm saying there should be special weeks where they play for DPOV instead of regular POV, not having DPOV be an additional/hidden power like Matt's was BB12.   I honestly don't mind which, I'd love to see it brought back into BB and it would be nice either way. I think it is a little better having it instead of a regular POV, but I also love additional/hidden powers (but not for DPOV, surely there is something else which that can be for). But yea, I agree with you."
BigBrother,3dq7vc,CaptaineAli,2,Sat Jul 18 15:38:36 2015 UTC,Diamond POV allows you to remove someone from the block and select the replacement nominee (the HOH and the normal POV winner are immune).
BigBrother,3dq7vc,XPeaceChill,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:06:23 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that a player could not be put up after using the silver veto. The nominees could veto each other they just couldn't take themselves off the block. Back then everyone played in the pov, and it was almost never used."
BigBrother,3dq7vc,GoGoPoweRanger,2,Sat Jul 18 14:10:41 2015 UTC,"As others have said, POV winner is immune from nomination.  However, the only time this would be possible would be in the final 4, If A is HOH, B & C are nominated, and D wins POV. If D were to use the POV, they would be the only possible renomination."
BigBrother,3dq7vc,Firate,2,Sat Jul 18 13:05:51 2015 UTC,"No, in BB5 Cowboy won veto at F4 and used it on Diane (or Drew, I don't remember) and since the veto winner cannot be nominated Nakomis who was on the block was instantly evicted.  Only time veto winner isn't safe is if they're on the block and they don't use it (lol Marcellus) or use it on the other nominee."
BigBrother,3dq7vc,ILikeToBurnThings_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"I mean, at that point in the F4 if the person not on the block wins POV, they can just vote out whoever they want anyway, they don't need to use it on someone and have the other automatically go home. But yes, in that case with all 3 safe, Nakomis had to leave."
BigBrother,3dq7vc,Firate,2,Sat Jul 18 21:39:00 2015 UTC,I was just stating that there is no way for someone who isn't nominated and wins veto cannot be named a replacement under any circumstances.
BigBrother,3dq7vc,ILikeToBurnThings_,2,Sat Jul 18 22:29:25 2015 UTC,"This has happened before in BB8, Danielle Donato saves her dad, gets put up as the replacement nominee. Dick sends home Jameka."
BigBrother,3dq7vc,fatherofthesun,2,Sat Jul 18 15:09:27 2015 UTC,"Dani wasn't the replacement nom because she was on the block anyway. She and Dick were nominated together, but when she won POV she essentially gave the sole eviction vote to her dad."
BigBrother,3dq7vc,Firate,0,Sat Jul 18 21:36:11 2015 UTC,Incorrect.  Danielle was already nominated. The PoV winner can never be a renom.
BigBrother,3dq7vc,GoTurnMeOn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:47:59 2015 UTC,"Then what happens when D wins POV? Is it not possible to use it, or does the non-vetoed person automatically go home?"
BigBrother,3dq7vc,hookyboysb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:42:32 2015 UTC,D becomes the sole vote. It would be redundant for them to use the veto and leave just one person on the block so rather they tell them to name the player they are evicting.  Refer to BBUS Seasons 5 and 16 and BBCAN season 1.
BigBrother,3dq7vc,GoTurnMeOn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:34:03 2015 UTC,You're safe if you win the veto I think...

BigBrother,3dq7vc,pisaradotme,0,Sat Jul 18 11:37:15 2015 UTC,"They are almost 100% correct.   The PoV winner can absolutely never be a renom. In the final four, if they are not already a nominee (Danielle BB8) or the HoH, the PoV winner always becomes the sole vote."

BigBrother,3du7o7,RightWingersSuck,37,Sun Jul 19 14:52:48 2015 UTC,"So I am going to start off by  say this, if you want an actual meaningful conversation, don't insult people's intelligence and then say you are going to get downvoted.   Not every Johnny Mac fan out there believes that he is a ""super genius"". People like Johnny Mac because he is funny, quirky, and not an obvious recruit. Maybe he doesn't know the game but I still enjoy watching him. I haven't thought of him a good player since the second nominations of him volunteering to go up on the block and throw the botb.   Just.... be careful how you word things or people will just tell themselves that ""RightWingersSuck is just a troll, just move on""."
BigBrother,3du7o7,edog123100,9,Sun Jul 19 16:08:36 2015 UTC,He's been this way for a long time.
BigBrother,3du7o7,Geeraff,7,Sun Jul 19 18:05:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think Johnny Mac's got a good social game, which is a huge part of BB. No one hates him (like Jason mentioned on the feeds) though Audrey has tried to throw him under the bus. He keeps volunteering to be nominated, so that comes across as loyal to the other players, and it might benefit him in the long run. Also, RightWingersSuck, if you're going to insult a group of people, at least try to make it factual. Not all BB fans are American."
BigBrother,3du7o7,sophia_e_92,16,Sun Jul 19 18:22:03 2015 UTC,"In an atmosphere of supermodel and athlete recruits, the viewers like to see an everyman do well.  Forget the quirky voice and mannerisms, John is your average white dude from middle America.  He's a white-collar guy who works hard, is a fan of the game and is different enough to be entertaining without being too abrasive.  He had solid pre-season interviews and has saved himself from danger without attracting much attention.  In a sense, John is the kind of player most people from the sub would be.  The voice and stuff give people something to fixate on but I truly think that he's simply one of the more relatabale houseguests for those of us who aren't prototypical sorority girls or amateur athletes."
BigBrother,3du7o7,diary_room,-27,Sun Jul 19 15:14:56 2015 UTC,Prove he is a fan of the game.
BigBrother,3du7o7,diary_room,10,Sun Jul 19 15:16:09 2015 UTC,He said as much in his pre-season interviews so I can only take him at his word.  Certainly he hasn't made any Jeff-level slip ups where it seems apparent that he doesn't understand how it's played.    Him being a fan is a tiny part of my statement and by no means the point.  People like him and don't care if he's not a master strategist or competition beast because they can relate to him.  Then they take it to the extreme level of fandom that BB fans are known for.
BigBrother,3du7o7,diary_room,-19,Sun Jul 19 15:18:16 2015 UTC,Clay said this too. Do you take him at face value?
BigBrother,3du7o7,diary_room,10,Sun Jul 19 15:22:03 2015 UTC,Sure do.  Being a fan of the game isn't a jury pass.  You have to take that knowledge and actually turn it into some gameplay.  Clay seems to know the mechanics of the game just as well so either he likes the show or understood enough of the sequester preview to call himself a fan and not fuck up things like the basic rules.    Is it really that hard to understand that people like John for reasons that exclude not only his voice and off-kilter personality but also his gameplay?
BigBrother,3du7o7,fry9guy,-18,Sun Jul 19 15:27:49 2015 UTC,"Okay. Well if your definition includes people who watched a lot of the episodes in the last 4 months because they might make it  on the show then, I would agree Jmac could be a fan on that basis.  I just use a different definition of fan."
BigBrother,3du7o7,kykylele,5,Sun Jul 19 15:46:01 2015 UTC,I'm cool with that.  I think my point has very little to do with the fact that he's a fan and stands without it.

BigBrother,3du7o7,Jotchee,-27,Sun Jul 19 17:07:53 2015 UTC,You've posted the only reasonable comment in this thread.
BigBrother,3du7o7,shadowdra126,20,Sun Jul 19 15:26:08 2015 UTC,"I think OP's making the very dramatic mistake of mixing an adoration for the player with adoration for his game. Most of us who really dig Johnny Mac and who like to be a part of the hype (because it's fun!) do not assert he is playing the best game. We tend to want to see him get far because it means we get more of him, and SOMETIMES that is translated into fantasies of how much potential he has, but Johnny's fan base is not, in any sense, a product of his amazing game play. OP is deluding him/herself in making that claim.  In the Big Brother house, there is a lot of pressure to evaluate players based on skill and so when people like OP post abrasive ""JMac sucks"" kinds of comments, of course people are going to rush to defend his honor. Post a comment along the lines of ""you know, I understand why everyone loves JMac so much, but as a player I don't think he's very good"" and you'll be met with much less hostility.  So, OP, while you claim it is us who are butthurt, I assert it's YOU who is severely butthurt. You made this thread looking for a fight, you found one, and now you're mad you're outnumbered."

And sometimes (at least for me) its a breath of fresh air to see a nice, funny guy, who doesn't need the money on a show purely for the experience and because they are a fan. But keep in mind he is on the block every week because he isn't in the sixth sense alliance and those people go up every week. Much like Jason or Meg. Does Austin or Audrey not being up at all make them a batter player? Not necessarily. Plus it's still early so to say that JMac is a good or bad player remains to be seen. It depends on how he does post jury."

BigBrother,3du7o7,shadowdra126,-6,Sun Jul 19 17:48:55 2015 UTC,because comp wins and losses only matter in a context. And his context is shit.

BigBrother,3dnysr,GoTurnMeOn,3,Fri Jul 17 20:50:26 2015 UTC,wait what? how? i watched bbcan3 and whenever someone was evicted they'd walk right out  at least it looked like that… if that's true how would that work? it's live right?
BigBrother,3dnysr,PoopStuckOnMeFur,10,Sat Jul 18 01:16:16 2015 UTC,It's taped at around 4 EST and airs around 8 EST.  The house is like a 3 minute walk from the studio.    You can tell they are not the same doors to the outside because as the HG leaves through the door there is a pause and a cut to Arisa standing outside announcing the evicted HG. BBUS you physically see them walk out of one door and opening the second (seeing the first door close in the background)
BigBrother,3dnysr,CharlieCanyon,2,Sat Jul 18 07:09:24 2015 UTC,It's not shown but the houseguests have to do a bit of walking to get from the house to the Global Studio where the stage is.

If you made it past the stage doors you'd in a hallway, or the back of the set."
BigBrother,3dnysr,bfaithr,32,Fri Jul 17 21:41:38 2015 UTC,"We have literally seen them walk out, it's right there on every eviction night. You can see when they walk out one door directly from the house, down a short 5ft or so hallway, and out of a second door to where Julie is.   But those doors could be triggered to unlock for the next person who opens them and relock upon closing again. It would suck to get stuck in that tiny hallway.  Even if you did get stuck in the tiny hallway though, the house guests could definitely hear you yelling through the final door there. A trespass charge would not even land you much time in jail, could probably get it all probated and not do any actual jail time (other than between the arrest and being bailed out)."

They would also give them the run down about rules, regulations and make them sign papers etc...  I am only guessing this based on the fact that it is considered a ""production"" feature and that most of the houseguests saw each other there prior to entering the house. I wonder how many people are actually sent to California for the production process. Would it be just the 16 entering the house or more people in which they cross off (as the audition tapes wouldn't have been enough to determine if the people are what they want)."

BigBrother,3dp915,DizzyedUpGirl,14,Sat Jul 18 10:11:28 2015 UTC,It was current HOH hate. In a few days Shelli will get it again and Vanessa will be forgotten.
BigBrother,3dp915,Zero_Heart,5,Sat Jul 18 03:53:18 2015 UTC,Shelli is in the perfect position to evict Audrey at this point and get an entire house on her side.
BigBrother,3dp915,Josh32887,2,Sat Jul 18 05:24:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I do believe that evicting Audrey over Jason or Meg may lead Vanessa, Austin, and Liz to call her loyalty into question. Vanessa and Austin want Audrey to go, but they would much rather someone from the other side of the house go first. My point is that I don't think evicting Audrey is as safe for Shelli as it would have been for anyone else in the house. Her and Clay are still trying to prove their loyalty to Vanessa, Austin, and Liz. The best way to do that is to get James, Jason, or Meg out."
BigBrother,3dp915,BobbyOnTheRadio,6,Sat Jul 18 18:34:24 2015 UTC,"She didn't run with the house n evict Audrey, she took the stronger player out. People need to shut up and let the arrows fly on eachother."

BigBrother,3dp915,modernvamps,2,Sat Jul 18 04:15:17 2015 UTC,I think Vanessa is my favorite player this year. One of the few with a brain and no obnoxious quirks.
BigBrother,3dn36s,bookworm0901,79,Fri Jul 17 16:43:16 2015 UTC,"I mean, I think the real defense for Austin is that Liz is sort of leading him on.  She does flirt with him a lot and she never says no or gives him any signals to tell him that what he's doing isn't welcome.    So it's creepy to us because we know Liz is stabbing him in the back and maybe doesn't even like him, but he has NO way to know.  Even Vanessa doesn't know, Liz convinced Vanessa that she was in to Austin, causing Vanessa to tell Austin the same.  Everyone's telling him it's a GO, so what do we expect?"
BigBrother,3dn36s,NikKnack,38,Fri Jul 17 17:12:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have a point about Liz leading him on. He's probably 90% sure that she's into him based on the flirting. But I think what rubs people the wrong way about Austin's behaviour towards Liz is how possessive and aggressive he is. He acts like Liz is a tree that he's peed on; no other male can encroach on his ""territory."" I feel bad for him that Liz is toying with his emotions, but I guess she's using it as a game tactic. Her other alternative would be to shut him down, and if she did, he might blow up her game. Either way, it's a shitty situation for everyone involved."
BigBrother,3dn36s,sophia_e_92,17,Fri Jul 17 17:34:18 2015 UTC,"Vanessa offered to tell him to cool it, before it got to where it is now, several days ago.  Liz told her not to, because she really did sort of like him and that it was growing.    So then Vanessa went to Austin and told him... yeah dude I guess Liz really does like you.  And then things intensified.   Liz could have shut it down but at every turn she fans the flames."
BigBrother,3dn36s,NikKnack,12,Fri Jul 17 17:51:38 2015 UTC,"Liz is allowed to change her mind though. I think when Vanessa asked she was maybe considering it. At that point Austin wasn't being as aggressive. After that convo with Vanessa though Austin has come on VERY strong.  I really could see myself in Liz's position, being sorta kind of interested and then completely losing interest romantically after the way he has acted lately."
BigBrother,3dn36s,histronic,2,Fri Jul 17 20:05:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see what you mean. It doesn't help that she's telling Vanessa that she's starting to like Austin. Do you think Liz will ever shut it down, though? Anyways, I agree with you. Liz is playing Austin dirty. But I think it's his approach that irks people. The feeling of ownership towards Liz, aka ""No one comes between me and my twins."" I wish Liz was never in the house, because Austin had a lot of potential in this game. I loved his preseason interviews and he sounded very promising, but his thing for Liz is blindsiding his game."
BigBrother,3dn36s,sophia_e_92,6,Fri Jul 17 18:06:41 2015 UTC,"He acts like Liz is a tree that he's peed on; no other male can encroach on his ""territory.""   In all fairness most guys at least feel this way when it comes to someone they're ""with"".  Edit: haha I love the downvotes; nothing I said was inaccurate. It's actually documented in a lot of studies. But yeah let's downvote what you don't like versus things that are inaccurate. Oh well."
BigBrother,3dn36s,BinaryIdiot,8,Fri Jul 17 18:49:22 2015 UTC,"But Austin isn't with Liz. Maybe he is in his mind, but they aren't an exclusive couple. Just two people flirting. So he shouldn't even be jealous of the other guys because Liz is not his girlfriend."
BigBrother,3dn36s,sophia_e_92,3,Fri Jul 17 19:13:38 2015 UTC,"So he shouldn't even be jealous of the other guys because Liz is not his girlfriend.   Yeah flirting has implications of intent; guys don't like other guys with girls that like them. I know they're not ""together""-ish."
BigBrother,3dn36s,BinaryIdiot,5,Fri Jul 17 19:15:58 2015 UTC,"If someone's single, flirting with anyone is fair game. It's a douchey thing to do, but it's still fair game. They don't ""belong"" to anyone so they are free to flirt with who they want. Until a relationship has been acknowledged and solidified, intent means practically nothing. It's like calling dibs on someone because they flirt with you. Unless you're both on the same page about the relationship, there is no romantic relationship."
BigBrother,3dn36s,sophia_e_92,2,Fri Jul 17 19:20:26 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree and these are all points that do not disagree with my original statement. You're talking social interactions where I simply stated how the feelings were different. You don't always act on feelings, right? Same kind of thing.  It's just science and social pressures."
BigBrother,3dn36s,BinaryIdiot,9,Fri Jul 17 19:22:57 2015 UTC,In all fairness most guys act or at least feel this way when it comes to someone they're with.   I think you mean most teenage guys. As grown ass woman I would not tolerate that macho jealous bullshit.
BigBrother,3dn36s,PlaidPanda,9,Fri Jul 17 18:59:45 2015 UTC,"YES x10000. Macho jealous bullshit is a huge red flag. I used to put up with that crap when I was an insecure teenager, but not anymore."
BigBrother,3dn36s,sophia_e_92,2,Fri Jul 17 19:15:24 2015 UTC,I think you mean most teenage guys. As grown ass woman I would not tolerate that macho jealous bullshit.   Nope; it's ingrained in our evolution. When a males thinks a female is interested he will do what he can to ward off external interference (other males or otherwise). There are countless studies about how this works and it's something not easily overcome by all.  People seem to think that I am saying the behavior is okay which is not true; I just wanted to make sure people were informed this is simple biology and evolutionary pressures. This was a good study though there are countless more: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513801000782
BigBrother,3dn36s,BinaryIdiot,2,Fri Jul 17 19:21:14 2015 UTC,Then add the tension from being in the same house 24/7 with the same people who you are pitted against. All together it is a recipe for disaster for them.

BigBrother,3dn36s,LoLThatsjustretarded,5,Sat Jul 18 03:58:19 2015 UTC,"100% agree. I mean he is chill with Julia because Julia plays no games and does not  leads him on while Liz does . Obviously if he was super creepy he would of been hitting on both twins , but the only reason he is hitting on Liz is because she is leading him on. As a man, if a hot chick leads you on, you take a chance because the alternate reality of learning if a girl liked you and you being too stupid to realize it is so much worse."

BigBrother,3dn36s,Hostik,21,Sat Jul 18 09:52:15 2015 UTC,"I think he would of said that either way. He has said.. ""No one comes in between me and my twins"" ALL week in the house.

BigBrother,3dn36s,d3phext,17,Fri Jul 17 17:06:26 2015 UTC,"I'm already sick of people saying the ""my twins"" DR shows some creepy levels of possessiveness. It does not - it's a fucking joke, a throwback to Brenchel, a twisted quote. It's meant to be funny based on the familiarity of Rachel's famous goodbye message, and that's fucking it. Was it a misogynistic ownership thing when Rachel said it? Fuck no, it's a manner of speech. That's why nobody got PC on her about it then. May as well bust on anyone who says ""my wife"", but that's just dumb; there is no inference there that the speaker regards her as no better than property.    If you wanna say his other actions in the house are creepy, you're certainly entitled to that - if you ignore that Liz isn't exactly rejecting him. But if you fall back on the DR quote to reach that conclusion AND you know its origins, then you fail at critical reasoning."

BigBrother,3dn36s,chaz_batch,4,Fri Jul 17 21:29:35 2015 UTC,"He has a ""White Knight"" syndrome , with his studying medieval literature / poetry , claiming Jeff was ""harassing"" Liz and he had to protect her... that Steve was being inappropriate, etc.  ...  Everything about him screams he is the skinny, gangly, dorky guy in high school who is doing everything he can to 'get chicks'.......   From thinking, ""hey chicks love freaky guys, i'll grow out my hair and get tattoos.......   When that doesn't work to thinking, ""hey chicks love poetry, I'll learn that""......

Particularly Day's impersonation (""I'll cut you"" / ""baby Oprah""), and the notion of there being a male voice in Audrey's head (presumably because she's transgendered) would be cause for scandal.  Not sure what make of that, but the thought struck me while I was watching.  Edit: if you disagree with me, that's cool--I'd love to hear your side of it."

BigBrother,3dkl05,limerences,16,Fri Jul 17 05:50:47 2015 UTC,This is pretty much why:  But first!
BigBrother,3dkl05,ismileicrazy,13,Fri Jul 17 09:00:36 2015 UTC,Because she has a sort of robotic style to her.  For some parts of the show basically an android is hosting the show with the same programming week to week.
BigBrother,3dkl05,shrike3000,7,Fri Jul 17 06:26:26 2015 UTC,"""Chen was widely criticized in the media for her heavily scripted, wooden delivery in her interaction with the studio audience and in the interviews on the live programs, earning her the nickname ""Chenbot."" She has indicated in two separate interviews, that she takes no personal offense to the term, adding that it may derive from her ""precise on-air style"" which comes from ""a desire to be objective""."

BigBrother,3dmiw9,Munsonise,8,Sat Jul 18 02:13:54 2015 UTC,What a depressing day
BigBrother,3dmiw9,Naxek,2,Sat Jul 18 02:12:33 2015 UTC,I don't understand this outcome.
BigBrother,3dmiw9,SpideySenses3000,-2,Sat Jul 18 02:11:34 2015 UTC,James and Jackie won BOTB. Johnny Mac and Jason did not and are still on the block. Shelli is HOH.

BigBrother,3dmiw9,SpideySenses3000,-10,Sat Jul 18 02:11:01 2015 UTC,going to be an AMAZING WEEK OF FEEDS.  Paranoid Shelli. Jason scrambling for the first time OTB. Johnny Mac possibly FORCED to campaign. Potential Audrey/Austin backdoors.  WOOT! BEST CASE SCENARIO!

BigBrother,3dmiw9,MasterofMarionettes,3,Sat Jul 18 02:13:39 2015 UTC,If more comes out about Austin he could be clipped.  Audrey I dont think she'll clip but Audrey gets crazier.  And they still think Becky is the hinky vote.  One of those 3 would be my guess.
BigBrother,3dmiw9,chachacha54512,7,Sat Jul 18 02:11:45 2015 UTC,Possibly Audrey. Best case scenario (for me) would be Austin.

But the rabid obsessed Johnny fan boys are confusing given he's done absolutely nothing to warrant it. This has nothing to do with Johnny Mac the PERSON/GAME PLAYER and ALL to do with his crazed fans (not all of them).
BigBrother,3dmiw9,ronscot,2,Sat Jul 18 02:01:21 2015 UTC,"Well, they think he's cute and charming- I don't they put it forth it's because of his gameplay."

Your comments... they're not intentionally abrasive to the current consensus, and yet they're just awkward/off-putting enough that the combo of ""unpopular opinion"" & ""words not well chosen"" makes it feel ""negative"", and thus the downvotes.  There are unpopular opinions posted in these threads, but they have a different ""feel"" to them than yours do, and they get upvoted (though not much more than a dozen points).  I know you don't care about karma/points, and for that I'm glad, because we need dissenting opinions.  So if you're interested in being involved in the conversation instead of downvoted until your comments are auto-hidden, slightly adjust the tone."

Its really the best way to watch the feeds anyhow as you can use quad and switch the audio off for cam 1/2 or 3/4.

A = 4 points, B = 3 points, C = 2 points D = 1 point E/F = 0 points. The weighted average of all grades you receive using this point system is your Grade Point Average (GPA)."
BigBrother,3dmqdw,Dreeeder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:00:30 2015 UTC,"Doesn't have to be nothing but A's in high school. Many schools have weighted GPAs for AP and dual credit (college class taken at a HS). Basically every grade gets bumped up one point, with A's going to 5 points. This means you could have a few B's but still end up with a GPA of 4."
BigBrother,3dmqdw,hookyboysb,3,Sat Jul 18 06:12:34 2015 UTC,"But what classes did he take in high school?  That is more telling to me than GPA most of the time.  You could take the bare minimum and get all A's in that, but, to me, that's not as impressive as someone taking Dual Credit / AP classes that may get A's and B's, and the small handful of B's in the required class to make their GPA like 3.7.  To me, that GPA is more impressive because he took the harder classes.  AP / Dual Credit classes are usually weighted, but even then, they have a lot higher work load than the bare min that you need.  It's more impressive if someone got a B in Calculus in High School than someone getting an A in Algebra II.   GPA only tells part of the story."

BigBrother,3dmqdw,hookyboysb,-1,Sat Jul 18 06:14:04 2015 UTC,I made my judgement by listening to him discuss his education and career plans and listening to him talk on live feeds for hours a day.

BigBrother,3dmqdw,takev9393,4,Fri Jul 17 16:14:36 2015 UTC,He looks like Channing Tatum
BigBrother,3dmqdw,notswift,2,Fri Jul 17 17:59:50 2015 UTC,Well he definitely got hotter with age

BigBrother,3dmqdw,beatwithbiblebelt,-6,Sat Jul 18 05:22:15 2015 UTC,he looks like such a meathead asshole.
BigBrother,3dmqdw,Jonazq,-9,Fri Jul 17 21:02:06 2015 UTC,And davone looks like a burglar
BigBrother,3dmqdw,Toponlap,9,Fri Jul 17 21:53:00 2015 UTC,now that's just racist
BigBrother,3dmqdw,piggyme,2,Fri Jul 17 23:36:12 2015 UTC,The racist comment was showing just how offensive the above comment should've been. I don't think he was actually trying to be racist.
BigBrother,3dmqdw,seaslug1,2,Sat Jul 18 03:12:18 2015 UTC,Look at Toponlap's posts. Clearly racist.
BigBrother,3dmqdw,Jonazq,-4,Sat Jul 18 15:42:55 2015 UTC,But the meathead comment is ok?
BigBrother,3dmqdw,Toponlap,5,Sat Jul 18 03:19:22 2015 UTC,Good Lord. The person made a very obvious racist statement (that angered several people) to show how prejudice the original meathead comment was. The meathead comment was not ok.
BigBrother,3dmqdw,seaslug1,2,Sat Jul 18 04:05:14 2015 UTC,"but the meathead comment was fine, right?  /s"

BigBrother,3dn4yr,iam_foundorange,4,Fri Jul 17 16:56:46 2015 UTC,Have you tried out the bbviewer? I find it much better when watching feeds on my computer.
BigBrother,3dn4yr,ExcessiveIrritation,2,Fri Jul 17 17:04:04 2015 UTC,"Omg no! I love this, thanks. :)"
BigBrother,3dn4yr,danidevon,2,Fri Jul 17 18:09:11 2015 UTC,So...whatcha composing? Instrumentation?
BigBrother,3dn4yr,danidevon,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:00 2015 UTC,This is a revision for a chamber orchestra piece that I wrote in 2012! Summers are a great for revisions ;)  https://soundcloud.com/brandonrumsey/spellbound-2012-1
BigBrother,3dn4yr,DaftPodunk,2,Fri Jul 17 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"Nice! I liked it. Haunting at times and then more lively and agitated at other times. Much better than anything I could write. I passed Choral Comp and Arranging, but I was never meant to write. I was definitely meant to perform and teach. Kudos to you!"
BigBrother,3dn4yr,wolfwv,2,Fri Jul 17 20:59:36 2015 UTC,I recently got out of the marching percussion arranging business. Finale has always been janky with percussion and I am glad to be rid of it! The MIDI keyboard helped though.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,lauriea776,98,Fri Jul 17 02:34:36 2015 UTC,I thought the exact same thing! Like they already have a new person doing the takeover every week but now they have random dancers (which was also a waste of air time)...they are totally messing with the authentic big brother experience. Although..didn't they bring in outsiders in season 2 too?
BigBrother,3dkwn6,herrokitty91,69,Fri Jul 17 02:38:09 2015 UTC,This season is being produced BADLY.  Lucky for them the HG's are interesting.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,deanresin_,31,Fri Jul 17 07:06:19 2015 UTC,"Yup, the twists are lame but the cast is amazing."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,barn_yard,3,Fri Jul 17 10:55:58 2015 UTC,Second this. Too many twists and too much of a deviation from past seasons.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,IVXXMMXIII,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:45:47 2015 UTC,No it's not at all.  It's an interesting diversion and they're really changing things up.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,courtFTW,8,Fri Jul 17 18:34:24 2015 UTC,Nice try Julie Chen.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,UnapologeticalyAlive,2,Fri Jul 17 19:04:56 2015 UTC,Not really...that was a dumb comment I felt I needed to respond to.  The season is being produced badly because outsiders are being brought in to assist with competitions?  No.  That makes zero sense.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,courtFTW,8,Fri Jul 17 19:09:04 2015 UTC,"In All Stars they brought in HG's from seasons past for a luxury comp.  In Season 9 Eric & Jessica came back to host a comp.  In Season 10, they brought in 1 HG from each season to compete against the house in a food comp.  In Season 12 Jessie came in the house for Pandora's Box, Jeff & Jordan. Jeff & Jordan came in to host a comp.  In Season 13 David Hasselhoff hosted a comp, and Jessie was also in Pandora's Box.  In Season 14 Jessie came in the house.  In Season 15 Britney Haynes announced she was pregnant.  In Season 16 Kathy Griffin came in to the house, as well as Jeff, Jordan, and their whole family."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,Fricktator,5,Fri Jul 17 13:55:43 2015 UTC,"In Season 7 (All-Stars) there were ""gnomes"" played by actors who hit the contestants with a pie to the face when they got a question wrong during a HOH comp."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,zipsgirl4life,2,Fri Jul 17 14:05:41 2015 UTC,Lets not forget in season 2 they bring in Survivor castways in the house for a full day
BigBrother,3dkwn6,legend_of_link12,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:10:29 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure in Season 11 Dan hosted a comp.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,bobbyc31,0,Sat Jul 18 13:36:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  I think a couple of celebrities or former house guests is different from whole groups of ""actors""/dancers."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,Acidrain77,6,Fri Jul 17 17:02:17 2015 UTC,Maybe it's actually helping with the conformity and reminding the HG they are individuals and can vote how they please. I'd imagine having totally isolation people would feel more pressure to vote with the power.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,DeepSeededHate,9,Fri Jul 17 11:31:56 2015 UTC,I don't get it. There is not much of a difference between Seeing Julie once or twice a week or seeing Julie + 1 other person for a takeover on camera. Then like you said they have only two times brought in people. Yall are exaggerating hard! The thing to is though that we forget how much down time time these guys spend just sitting around seeing no one. The episodes make it feel like things go faster. I'm sure the shock is still big for them.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,jenh6,16,Fri Jul 17 07:12:04 2015 UTC,"Twice so far. The foam party too. And when the intro always starts with ""x number of houseguests in total confinement, cut off from the outside world"" it ruins it. When a guest like NPH or David Hassolohoff comes in, its a big deal. Its not a big deal if people keep coming in. Plus as was commented above it wasted airtime. There is so much exciting gameplay that could be put in but is not."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,Dishonoreduser,2,Fri Jul 17 07:46:36 2015 UTC,"In Big Brother 9, they brought in outsiders to help with a houseguest emergency. It's on youtube if you'd like to watch."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,fiver420,51,Fri Jul 17 12:56:18 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand it to be honest. I'm trying to look at it from a production angle but I don't understand why they feel it necessary to ruin the ""complete isolation from the outside world"" dynamic for the comps this season.  I get that they don't want to re-use competitions from past seasons all that much however the foam party could have been done with mannequins which they would have had to drag back with them instead of real people, and this HOH could have just been pictures, or videos of from the dance parties that they had this week.  I'm hoping this is the last time they do it, although I am a little bit of a purist when it comes to the isolation part of BB, I don't even like it when they can see the audience sometimes through the door on eviction night."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,LinZ14,7,Fri Jul 17 03:39:27 2015 UTC,"I like both of your ideas for competitions way better. Sure, asking questions on footage from the prior week isn't new by any means, but there is nothing wrong with that. Both fans and players alike expect to see those types of competitions, and I love that it gives and edge to houseguests that also happen to be fans. Their original idea just made me feel like I was watching a generic version of my favorite show."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,pisaradotme,6,Fri Jul 17 13:27:18 2015 UTC,The problem with memory tasks is Liz is at a disadvantage.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,UnapologeticalyAlive,3,Fri Jul 17 14:19:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  I was thinking the same thing about mannequins and video.  The claustrophobic isolation they experience as demonstrated by the genuine excitement toward the end of the game when house guests hear people outside or see an airplane or catch a glimpse of production are some of the highlights of the season to me.  Toward the end, the final few house guests do things just to provoke Big Brother to talk to them."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,mung_tyson,2,Fri Jul 17 13:28:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I got a kick out of Spencer and Andy sitting in the back yard talking about the planes. And nothing but the planes. For hours. (seriously)
BigBrother,3dkwn6,xDaaniella,34,Fri Jul 17 19:08:59 2015 UTC,Well there was a wedding last season...
BigBrother,3dkwn6,gizmoman49,65,Fri Jul 17 03:09:18 2015 UTC,"And don't forget Caleb, Frankie and Christine actually left the house for a day to go watch football!"
BigBrother,3dkwn6,Polamolecules,31,Fri Jul 17 04:49:42 2015 UTC,And 2 seasons before that Shane and Danielle got the meet the US Women's Gymnastics team. And in Season 4 Jun and Allison went on a blimp ride over LA. And in Season 2 the Survivor cast entered the house.  People entering or going on a trip away from the house is nothing new.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,Jah-Eazy,7,Fri Jul 17 05:37:54 2015 UTC,And season 8 Dani Donato and Amber got to appear on that game show with Drew Carey!
BigBrother,3dkwn6,Kari_Renea,3,Fri Jul 17 15:14:00 2015 UTC,Well that one is a bit more typical
BigBrother,3dkwn6,KevinMCombes,-1,Fri Jul 17 07:38:20 2015 UTC,"Leaving the house as a comp win prize, to me, is a whole different deal than bringing random groups of people into the house."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,ladyluck11,14,Fri Jul 17 13:32:57 2015 UTC,In the past they have never had outsiders like they have  this season.  They have brought past house guests or special guests in but never had them as game props.  Not sure how I feel about it.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,missoctober12,11,Fri Jul 17 04:57:21 2015 UTC,"The authentic Big Brother experience is basically dead and gone. The show hasn't been the ""social experiment"" it was launched as since Shapiro left. But I don't really mind.  None of these extras are speaking or bringing any information to the HGs, so I don't think it's that bad. It's weird to see, but ultimately not that big of a deal. I have taken to calling this season the ""Summer of Extras""."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,lrnrae,2,Fri Jul 17 13:42:18 2015 UTC,"""Summer of Extras""  I like that!  Hahahaha!"
BigBrother,3dkwn6,lrnrae,5,Fri Jul 17 15:02:20 2015 UTC,It's different but I don't mind it. I was surprised they brought them in the for the foam party and then again for the dancers.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,Narninian,3,Fri Jul 17 05:54:17 2015 UTC,"I was surprised by this too! Especially randoms vs. vets/""celebs""/Zingbot - I can't recall any recent comps that have involved outsiders (other than beings the hosts) That being said, they also have more comps to try and be ""original"" than past seasons (other than bb16) - that extra BoB every week must dip in the creative pool a bit deeper. PLUS they cannot do normal memory comps because of Liz/Julia. They have to do this weird half ass remember what you just saw thing, which I guess is good for the bb ""recruits"", but the super fans in there (Jason, Steve etc.) that are trying to study things are probably like wtf lol"
BigBrother,3dkwn6,mr420happy,3,Fri Jul 17 14:27:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like they are spending too much episode time on comps, and during yesterday's episode too much time on house guest questions.  I feel like they are wasting air time.  I want them to show more strategizing and what the what the house guests do outside of the live show.  I realize I follow the live feeds, but I don't like the spoilers."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,Vroxilla,3,Fri Jul 17 14:37:57 2015 UTC,I think they had to fill time after the house guests did so poorly on the comp.  They were supposed to do two dances and all the house guests were out within a few questions.  Last year's house guests would have still been out there.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,FakeColours,2,Fri Jul 17 15:00:04 2015 UTC,Very true about last night's episode.  Other episodes though are riddled with comps and fillers - like chugging a drink to win a cruise.  I feel like there are so many more useless moments in this season than past seasons.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,Rare_Pepe_Poster,4,Fri Jul 17 15:12:01 2015 UTC,"Chugging a drink to win a cruise was the most ridiculous ""comp"" I've ever seen on the show.  Fail."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,Dishonoreduser,3,Fri Jul 17 15:12:59 2015 UTC,Meg clearly skillfully chose the correct cup to chug.
BigBrother,3dkwn6,eye_eat_baybees,3,Fri Jul 17 15:23:34 2015 UTC,"""Okay everyone, choose a cup""   nobody moves, they just drink the cup in front of them."
BigBrother,3dkwn6,diary_room,2,Fri Jul 17 16:51:07 2015 UTC,"BB17 is doing better than BBCan3's eviction episodes 10 minute recaps, followed by not showing the HoH comps. That was brutal."
