Yet if you ask Americans if they like socialism or the far left, you won't get very many positive responses. As for the source, well, you'll notice that I'm not exactly restricting myself, since the mainstream media has very much tempered their criticism of Clinton.  As for the broader point that Clinton is misreading the mood, I think they're correct. People are fed up. On the left, that means they think the government should get serious about helping people and stop screwing around. On the right, that means they think all the baloney, red tape, and regulatory overreach in government should be cut out. In both cases, more accountable government is wanted. Clinton promises corruption and nickle-and-dime tax cuts. Not what anybody wants."

The real problem for the Clinton's is that it is just one more unpleasant reminder of how filthily they campaigned in 2008.  ""(CNN) — In what appear to be the New York senator’s most blunt comments to date regarding a racial division in the Democratic presidential race, Hillary Clinton suggested Wednesday that “White Americans” are increasingly turning away from Barack Obama’s candidacy.  “I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on,” Clinton said in an interview with USA TODAY.  Clinton cited an Associated Press poll “that found how Senator Obama’s support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me.”  “There’s a pattern emerging here,” she said.  Exit polls from Tuesday’s primaries in Indiana and North Carolina show Clinton won about 60 percent of the white vote in both states. That percentage is down from the Ohio primary on March 4, in which Clinton won upwards of 65 percent of the white vote. Meanwhile, Clinton garnered 63 percent of the white vote in Pennsylvania on April 22.  Speaking with the paper, Clinton rejected the notion her comments were racially divisive in any way.  “These are the people you have to win if you’re a Democrat in sufficient numbers to actually win the election,” she said. “Everybody knows that.”  Obama spokesman Bill Burton called Clinton’s statements “not true and frankly disappointing.”""  ""The third-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives and one of the country’s most influential African-American leaders sharply criticized former President Bill Clinton this afternoon for what he called Mr. Clinton’s “bizarre” conduct during the Democratic primary campaign.  Representative James E. Clyburn, an undeclared superdelegate from South Carolina who is the Democratic whip in the House, said that “black people are incensed over all of this,” referring to statements that Mr. Clinton had made in the course of the heated race between his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Senator Barack Obama."""

AnybodyButHillary,3be174,Lord_Forrester,2,Sun Jun 28 09:44:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I just posted an argument for why Hillary is likely unelectable in the general, though that could change if the Republicans drop the ball. What I forgot to include in that argument is that in winning the primary, it's likely that she'll alienate a lot of would-be supporters if she ends up employing the same sort of scorched earth tactics she did in 2008 once it started to look like she might lose, thus killing the enthusiasm of her base. We've seen this in the past where a tough primary battle weakened a candidate for the general election. Even a not-so-tough primary battle can lead to a general election loss if the enthusiasm isn't there to motivate voters as we saw with John Kerry in 2004. A proper argument here would talk specifically about swing states I suppose.  But speaking of the primary, you may have a point that it's hers to lose. Hillary's immense lead in resources, polling, elite support, and name recognition would all-but-guarantee any other candidate the nomination. A scenario in which Hillary loses the primary would probably have to involve a combination of three factors: 1) The polling begins to reflect her general unelectability more than it does now. 2) Gaffes/scandals, which are pretty common for her, especially considering that she tends to use lots of surrogates but doesn't keep them on a short enough leash not to get into hot water, and 3) her opposing Dem candidates start looking significantly more electable than her in the polling.  Now as for what happens if she wins the whole thing and runs for re-election? Well, I'm having trouble envisioning her as a popular president, but maybe I'm just biased there."
