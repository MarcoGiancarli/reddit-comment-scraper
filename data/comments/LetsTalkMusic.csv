LetsTalkMusic,3e0heb,washuffitzi,6,Tue Jul 21 00:34:26 2015 UTC,"His singles were fun when they were coming out, but I now, for me, it's mostly just boring rock reggae. At the time when he was popular I didn't listen to reggae, dance hall or dub, but a few years later I got really into those genres and his work never really held up after that. I became a reggae snob.  While I think it was good to have a popular Hasidic musician, I think he kind of gained a lot of his popularity due to novelty value. It seemed like everything he produced when he was popular had his face all over it.   I also think a big factor to his popularity was the gap left by all the disappearance of the late 90s/early 00's California rock reggae... and honestly he did a better job with it than groups like Sublime or 311. I think a lot of that has to do with authenticity; Matisyahu, as a Hasidic Jew, had much more of a connection to roots reggae since the genre focuses so heavily on religious faith and the old testament. I kind of hate bringing up authenticity but I think it's kind of important when talking about reggae, since its origins are so steeped in Jamaican culture and faith.    Reggae rock just kind of gets to me in this weird way. I think for me it feels too watered down and divorced from the source. This is all weird because I love a lot of heavily dub influenced electronic music. I guess it has a lot to do with respecting your influences and really studying them. Artists like Skream or Kode9 seem to do that much more than a 311 or Sublime. Back on topic: Matusyahu feels much more familiar with reggae than earlier popular rock reggae.  wow that was much more than I was thinking I would type about an artist who I had a passing interest in.    TLDR; I think Mtisyahu is better than his Reggae rock predecessors but, with familiarity of his influences I don't think his work is that good."
LetsTalkMusic,3e0heb,le_friendzone,2,Tue Jul 21 10:52:41 2015 UTC,"You said my thoughts better than I was able to. I went the same way with reggae - was introduced to the genre by the pop reggae-rock of the '00s then moved more into roots reggae and kinda lost respect for the reggae-rock genre because of the comparative lack of authenticity.   I respect Matis for doing his best to maintain his authenticity. I think his movement away from Hasidism was genuine, and rather than keep that persona (which would have probably been the right business move) he stayed true to himself and made that shift publicly."
LetsTalkMusic,3e0heb,FFIXMaster,4,Tue Jul 21 13:14:35 2015 UTC,"I got turned onto Matisyahu by a couple friends of mine right around the time No Place to Be came out (January 2007ish), and his stuff blew me away; I was never that into reggae but I really loved his sound and lyricism so I picked up his discog at the time and listened to it a lot for a while.  But as time went on and he wasn't doing anything new his stuff started falling off my playlists, and I stopped thinking about him; I managed to completely miss the release of Light some two and a half years after I'd started listening to him.    I had heard he'd put the Hasidic Judaism behind him, and saw him perform on some TV show maybe two years ago and thought he'd lost a lot of the flair he had, and it didn't really make me interested in looking up any of his newer stuff."
LetsTalkMusic,3e0heb,prodigyrun,2,Tue Jul 21 07:19:42 2015 UTC,"This sounds like an extremely normal story for Matis fans. This is the exact sentiment I had along with everyone I was with at the show; everyone lost interest in him gradually, and nobody listened to anything that was released after Light, so by the time he abandoned Hasidism nobody seemed to care anymore."
LetsTalkMusic,3e0heb,prodigyrun,2,Tue Jul 21 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"Never seen him live, but really liked his last album. I love that positive tip. His lyricism isn't always great, but he's talented nonetheless and even though some of the wording and some of the messages get a little cliche, it still serves its purpose. Puts me on the proper plain with a good beat to nod to. Not great, but pretty damn good."
LetsTalkMusic,3e0heb,SherrickM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:04:52 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear from a newer fan (or at least someone who is a fan of his newer stuff). I agree that even if it's not gold, it is still enjoyable enough to listen to, which is why I'd see him again even though I'm kinda disappointed by his new sound.  Out of curiosity, how much Matis have you heard prior to his last album? Just wondering if you followed his musical progression or if you started listening with that release."
LetsTalkMusic,3e0heb,iEatBluePlayDoh,2,Tue Jul 21 13:22:42 2015 UTC,"I was never a giant fan, but I've enjoyed him. I've had his discog for a few years before listening to the latest, so it's not like I've followed him step by step but...I've had a little time to let his earlier work sink in I guess. I think a lot of artists go through this arc. I'm sure at some point he'll ""go back to his roots."""
LetsTalkMusic,3e0heb,giantcity212,2,Tue Jul 21 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"A few years ago, I think he denounced a lot of the more strict parts of his religion and shaved his head. The material now is definitely different, as many artists do, he tried to evolve or change a bit, but he went in the wrong direction, I think.    To be fair, he's just a relatively young guy probably still trying to figure himself out."

LetsTalkMusic,3dzyj4,Silviuz,8,Mon Jul 20 22:05:50 2015 UTC,"That's a really bizarre concept, and I can't really see it catching on.  I think the essential ""music as stock"" concept could catch on, there's several sites that do that for movies.  Those use real money and the market reacts to the performance of the movie though, so it's entirely different.  I don't think it would translate well to music, but I think someone could figure it out.   I guess one problem I have with this concept is that it rewards you for having bland, homogenous tastes in music.  Like, if I get rewarded if the ""stock price"" goes up, I'm not going to invest in the  obscuro free improv groups I listen to, I'm going to invest in that marketable synth-pop-indie-folk band with an attractive singer.    Is a service like this good or bad for music?   In the end, it's neither, because this won't become popular.  Maybe I'll eat my words and this will be huge, but as of right now I doubt it."
LetsTalkMusic,3dzyj4,crustinXbeiber,2,Tue Jul 21 00:23:36 2015 UTC,"Hi Silviuz, Great that you are covering and questioning Tradiio concept. I am one of the cofounders of this project and I agree that we need to change some parts of the concept for it to work really well. We don't want to make it an obsession about rewards (we will remove that word soon) or coins. We want to change Tradiio to a plataform for helping emerging artists. From obscure to more popular music.  The way it should work in my opinion is a game where if you support/discover more artists the more recognition you get. But really what I would love is to hear your opinions and ideas. Crustin what kind of sites for movies do you know that work with real money? That question of investing in what I like or investing in what's gonna be popular it's really up to you the way you want to support this artist or another.  I support artists I want to see careers grow. Tell me what you think."
LetsTalkMusic,3dzyj4,andremoniz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:58:57 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thanks for responding to my post. It's cool that someone working for the actual site is weighing in on the conversation.   A few ideas I have that in my opinion, can make the service better.   Only have challenges/missions that require listening to minutes of music and not whole songs. This is because of genres like metal, jazz, and classical that like to put out 10+ minute songs, leaving those genres at a severe disadvantage.  I think inside of the main genres you guys have , there should be sub genres (e.g. hard rock, psychedelic rock, and progressive rock under the rock genre). This way artists can label their music to be more specific, and more easily reach audiences that are fans of that kind of music.  I don't know how soon something like this would be possible, but having some kind of desktop app similar to what spotify has would be far more convenient in my opinion. I just like having my music streaming in a completely different window separate from my web browser.    Those are my points. Thanks for reading, and thanks for taking the time to reply to people's posts on the internet."
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,cyrilspaceman,16,Sat Jul 18 15:47:05 2015 UTC,"I enjoy playing with a looping pedal, myself.  Ed Sheeran, Kimbra, and KT Tunstall are some popular artists who use them regularly.  I think it adds a fun effect live, and gives an energy that you can't really get by yourself.    I don't think there's necessarily something that loop artists can do that a band can't, or vice versa.  It's just a different sound; a different way to get a full sound.  For the artist who is having trouble finding reliable bandmates, it is awesome.  For the artist traveling on the road by him- or herself, it is awesome.  Will it replace bands as we know them?  Not a chance.  Here's a guy I saw a few years ago doing some of my favorite loop pedal work."
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,MightyTuba,5,Sat Jul 18 15:56:28 2015 UTC,This KT Tunstall performance (Jools Holland) made me go out and buy a loop pedal. Made me appreciate her performance even more when I realised it wasn't quite so simple.

It's amazing how skilled he is being only ~20. His new album, Arizona, has a Nine Inch Nails vibe to it. I've seen him a few times and just seeing everything live and his footwork to hit everything is just incredible. Definitely check him out if you get the chance!"
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,_voiddd,15,Sat Jul 18 15:58:28 2015 UTC,It's really hard to do progression in a song. looping a verse and a chorus is really long and hard to build up. it's fun to play with and make your own goofy shit but i really don't like it for solo-band performances.
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,MJawn,42,Sat Jul 18 20:50:14 2015 UTC,Just saw Ed Sheeran in concert. I've never seen a solo loop pedal musician live before and I was really impressed. A one man band for 2+ hours is no joke. I actually don't think he gets the credit he deserves in this respect. Just known for being a teen sensation with mushy love songs.
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,_the_jellybean_,17,Sat Jul 18 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"I saw him in concert last year and was really disappointed that he didn't have a band on stage. That was until he came on and started playing.  When I saw there were just two mics and a pedalboard in front of him I thought it was a massive cop-out not having a band. But holy crap, he was fantastic.  There was never a lull and it was never awkward when he recorded his loop parts. He was really involved with the crowd and it was a fantastic performance."
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,teasizzle,11,Sat Jul 18 20:59:54 2015 UTC,"My impression on him that he's John Mayer 2.0, where on paper he's really good and in no way anything to fault him for what he does because music needs that guy, but in practice there's nothing to get excited about or to discuss in length."

LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,belbivfreeordie,6,Sat Jul 18 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"Here's some other pretty cool bands/musicians that use loop pedals to great effect:  Kishi Bashi uses them for his vocals and violin, really sometimes twee, sometimes dream indie pop. Live on KEXP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtmQpRpzOZw  Colleeen uses them with her viola de gamba a lot, especially on the latest album Captain of None. Very ambient, dreamy music, strong dub influence. Here is her live on KEXP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-eaqAQczhc  Zoe Keating does kind of contemporary classical type stuff. She plays the cello and exclusively does stuff with the cello and loop pedals. It's not very groundbreaking or anything, but it's very pretty and I like how she uses all these sounds the cello is able to make and then layering them on top of eachother with the loop pedal. Live on ABC Radio National (australia) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G96AMzt1xJQ"
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,alcopops,11,Sun Jul 19 09:17:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think loop pedals let you expand what you can do by yourself musically. I was introduced to it by discovering Imogen Heap. And then later on, discovering Kimbra and all the cool work she does.  Lastly, through, Kimbra, I discovered an artist by name of Kishi Bashi who does some amazingly beautiful and brilliant solo work.    Like this https://youtu.be/tXMyAN03L5w"
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,i-ride-dragons,4,Sat Jul 18 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"Kishi Bashi is probably the best musician of this medium (solo loop petal art).

LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,Ensivion,15,Mon Jul 20 07:14:48 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna be honest, I think it's played out at this point.  It's kind of corny and not really that impressive at this point.  There's hundreds of bedroom loop pedal prodigies putting shit on youtube, and it's kind of worn out it's novelty for me at this point, much like that percussive acoustic guitar style  I do like Andrew Bird, I think he has the songwriting chops to back it up.  And Reggie Watts  is funny, even if I'm not impressed by the loop pedal stuff."
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,crustinXbeiber,4,Sat Jul 18 18:00:19 2015 UTC,"Regarding percussive acoustic guitars, that was my thinking too until I saw this, then I realized that realistically it could go anywhere if done correctly, especially if someone started mounting some midi triggers and someone brought in a kick drum."
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,MLein97,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:21:34 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not that impressed by that I guess.  The artist I linked to, Jon Gomm, I think is the best in the style and is way more successful, in my opinion, at integrating the beats into the song like that guy is doing.   I think midi triggers could make the style more interesting, but in my opinion that would probably sound way different then any of the current acts that I know of."
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,crustinXbeiber,3,Sun Jul 19 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that loopers are played out just yet. Every group has its copycats, but you can make some really great music with some vocal diversity. Percussive guitar has gotten to me though, mainly because everything feels a bit the same due to having to use compressors and the like to level out all the sounds."
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,chancellorjay,2,Sat Jul 18 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think loopers in general are played out, a lot of great acts use loopers pretty successfully (Minus The Bear and Dirty Beaches come to mind), but I think using it for a one man band act is kind of corny.  Not like I hate every band that does that, I just think it's a fairly unoriginal idea at this point that has more limitations than advantages.   Like, I saw this artist getting buzz in guitar circles awhile ago, which annoyed me because this is such a derivitave song and style.  Like, I like the song, but it seems to me like every time one of these looper acts gets famous everyone acts like they're a creative genius for being able to figure out how to do that, and it's not really that hard.   I'm probably getting a little ranty and offensive to fans of these acts, but it just seems to me like these kind of acts are popular with people who appreciate novelty more than originality or talent.   EDIT: I do have a soft spot for Casey Driessen even though his fanbase and style are a textbook example of what I'm talking about."
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,crustinXbeiber,2,Sun Jul 19 18:22:52 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean lol. I'm noticing more and more that one-man bands always tend to go for some kind of psychadelic jam somewhere in their songs that kinda kills the buzz. Dub FX is an example of this, even though I actually really like everything else about the song.  That Casey link was pretty good, though! I think it had more to do with his technical skills than relying utterly on effects."

I personally like this performance of HOMESHAKE, though I don't know if it counts like's looping (since it's a presetted loop), but it is a one man band, at least in this performance. As far as I know he's normally accompanied by a band. But yeah, check them out, their album -In The Shower- has been stuck in my head lately."

I had no idea what sort of music to expect, but the combination of beatboxing and guitar looping just blew me away, and I stayed the whole show.  That was actually my first encounter with Loop pedals and I really like how he explained the basics of it at the start of the show so people could understand what was going.  So here are a few songs:  Cherry Blossom Girl - beatbox + acoustic guitar looping  Kids - beatbox + electric guitar looping  Fugue In DnB Minor - beatbox looping"
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,Taman182,2,Sat Jul 18 22:38:26 2015 UTC,"I've been doing the loop thing lately and there are pros and cons. It is hard to get the magic you get when you're really all on point as a band. That's a special thing that takes tons of work and an intimate connection.  As has been mentioned about Sheeran, I try to keep the performance moving and keep people engaged while I'm making the loops. I do the chorus/verse thing by putting a beat on one channel, then I record the chorus loops on the other and bring them in and out. I like lots of stops and starts, too, so that's a cool aspect.  I think it differs very greatly from performers that have pre-programmed tracks and it's because it's so spontaneous and slightly different every time.  Reggie Watts is out of this world, both with his looper, and just as an entertainer. He oozes charisma and toys with you. His musicianship is mighty but it seems effortless. I have the biggest music boner for Reggie right now."
LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,MountainHigh31,2,Sun Jul 19 03:52:50 2015 UTC,"By far the best live looping musician I've heard of is Beardyman, he's a skilled musician and beatboxer who uses an elaborate looping setup with keyboards and tons of electronic effects.

There are so many factors to consider, as far as sound goes, as well as people being able to communicate with each other and work well.    I've seen as many terrible bands as I have solo performers and the big thing that was lacking was energy.    My favorite looping musician is Mylets- his shit is insane and I think he really makes it work as far as songwriting goes and performing and making things build and using form- as opposed to just looping."

LetsTalkMusic,3dqtag,alabrasa301,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know who else here is in college but the only reason I irrationally dislike loop pedals is because it seems that if someone uses it in a singer-songwriter competition, regardless of how well it's used or how bad the song is the performer is often lauded over the other singer songwriters who may actually may be performing better songs without it.  It's dumb I know, but I think for those who use it well, it's a fantastic way to display their talent as a recording artist. There isn't anything necessarily lost using a loop pedal, it's simply just another way to present a certain soundscape. It's just difficult to make a very interesting song with only using a loop pedal because it doesn't make much room for chord changes, mood changes, and so on.   So in terms of musicality, I disagree with the other comment saying you can expand what one person can do musically. Playing over a loop is limiting. But this doesn't mean it's bad at all. If done well, using a loop pedal can create some fun layers. But it's hard to create a long, interesting and moving piece with one."

Spector's albums with Cohen and Ramones sound much different than his early work cos' of them being stereo.   Music that is popular today is always stereo, very loud with all the sound frequencies clear and present. With a Spector production style you'd lose precious loudness and wouldn't be able to compete with more louder artists."
LetsTalkMusic,3dr3cj,goodmarksss,5,Sat Jul 18 17:48:06 2015 UTC,"That's true, and I know that once stereo was developed it took over, and for obvious reasons, but there are examples I used that were recorded in that style well after the transition from mono to stereo. Ok Computer and My Bloody Valentine's Loveless are all stereo albums. So the process would still work, and does. I'm wondering why it's not incorporated more. If it's simply not something that's relevant anymore then that's fine, I just don't understand why. It's such a rich recording style."

LetsTalkMusic,3dr3cj,goodmarksss,8,Sat Jul 18 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"Well I'm sure that there's people that still record their music in a more ambient/""roomy"" style, but it's harder to sell that music to the public these days.  People are used to hearing very loud, bright and clear music with a bit of digital reverb. If you present them with less processed, less loud sound, mic'd up from a distance in a room, they'll view it as less ""pro"" sounding than the very easy to get bright/loud/digital sound.  Spector recorded live, with all the session musicians playing in the same room, 3 pianos playing at the same time. If you were to record that way today (if you ever get the budget to pay for all the session musicians) people would view your end product as amateur. You'd have a ""muddy"", non-modern, non-bright sound that can't compete in the current musical climate.   Spector didn't have this problem in his prime cos' there was no digital or stereo recording back then, music in general was less loud than today so his technique didn't suffer so much from the lack of loudness or clarity compared to more standard production styles.   Kevin Shields had financial backing from a label that enabled him to experiment to get the Loveless sound. Recording budgets have plummeted, I doubt any current artist would get the money to record an album similar to Loveless/Spector, the labels know that kind of stuff doesn't sell so they won't waste their money on you.  Anyway, I think most artists should first and foremost focus on creating good songs and then look at possible recording techniques that they'd use to record their album. Kevin Shields/Beach Boys have great songs that sound good even when they're played on just an acoustic guitar, they don't need studio tricks to bring a song to life."

There's way more music available these days and it's seeming that there are more ambivalent, casual fans who might like a band because it's on Pandora in the background.  I do think it's a relic of the old pre-social web though. You don't need a fan site if you have FB groups, Wiki pages, subreddits...there's no need to create a brand new site when the same community can be found elsewhere."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnhwa,Nissl,5,Sat Jul 18 00:10:56 2015 UTC,"The numbers do in fact bear out that hardcore single-band fans are turning into casual grazers, particularly if they have a streaming subscription."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnhwa,rodsarethrown,3,Fri Jul 17 19:42:53 2015 UTC,"I find your point that the increased availability of music being correlated with increased ambivalence and casual listening to be interesting.  This and the availability of pre-existing platforms (such as facebook, reddit, and wikis) probably play into the non-existence of fan-made websites.    I agree that these communities have moved to current websites, and that there is no much of a reason for someone to go through the effort of creating a stand alone website, but I find that the format of these websites (especially FB and Reddit) do not promote the preservation of archival information in the way that the old pre-social websites did. Wiki sites are better for this if the band is lucky enough to have a well maintained one."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnhwa,HamburgerDude,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"Archival is definitely a struggle. Reddit has a time limit on when you can vote and comment on posts, and you can only find old stuff by searching for keywords (if the sub doesn't have a tagging feature that is). And there's definitely a cultural threshold for having a Wiki page... which doesn't help when it's SO difficult to rise above the local club circuit for most groups.  But in terms of ambivalence, it's everywhere. A lot of my friends aren't super into music - and granted, you can't be ""into"" everything - but it's beyond aggravating to hear the same Pandora playlists on quietly in the background all the time. It just bums me out."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,kminsk,15,Fri Jul 17 19:38:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said.  It's sad that he's declined in quality, but rap fans will always remember the classic albums and tapes he put out, he was definitely representative of a particular era in rap, and also popular music in general.  Obviously I don't know this, but I suspect the drug abuse and health issues have contributed to his decline.  It's hard to give it 100% if you feel like shit, you know?   I also think his modern output is slightly underrated.  Like, Rich as Fuck is a great song, and he's put out some great features, like Yuck, for example.  The non singles are mostly pretty bad, but he still has a spark of that old talent.   I think he still has the potential to make another classic album, but  I think he'd have to step outside his comfort zone and work with more forward thinking producers.  That's kind of one of his issues IMO, every beat he raps over sounds like a beat he'd rap over, unlike artists like Pusha T, Kanye, and Gucci who always get forward thinking producers."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,crustinXbeiber,3,Fri Jul 17 20:32:14 2015 UTC,"Yeahh man Rich as Fuck is great, although a big part of that is the beat.  Yeah I agree about stepping out of his comfort zone. Although, every time I've heard him on a new beat in the past few years he's seemed like the old man trying to keep up. But idk if that's all on him or maybe the result of a forced collaboration? Idk. I also think he has the potential for a classic album, but I think it's in the executive producer. I think he needs someone with a strong vision, help him focus his talent. I'd love to see a Kanye exec-produced album."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,d-bone01,6,Fri Jul 17 21:19:05 2015 UTC,I'd really like to believe his legacy will live on in one way or another. For every youtube link that goes down hopefully a couple more will pop up in it's place. Wayne's music was pretty definitive for kids my age during our high school years (2006-2008) and that's coming from someone who was a diehard metal head in high school.
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,JeweliusCaesar,2,Fri Jul 17 22:05:29 2015 UTC,"You're right. You can contribute part of his decline to fickle/disloyal fans who have a ""what have you done for me lately"" mindset. They haven't hesitated at all to toss Wayne aside in favor of Young Thug.  Also, everybody has runs and the public can experience burnout on certain artists."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,liquidswordzman,4,Fri Jul 17 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"His run from 2005/6ish to a little while after Tha Carter III dropped was truly mind boggling. Hard to believe any artist, regardless of genre, could put out that much quality work in such a short time period. Perhaps it continued for awhile longer, but for me, a lot of that spirit and effort seemed to take a turn for the worse in my book and he fell outta my favor. That said, I would hope that someday those accomplishments are fully recognized. As you pointed out tho, a lot of his best work may prove difficult for the average person to get ahold of down the line. Definitely feeling some sadness when it comes to that, as those mixtapes and such meant a lot to me back in the day."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,Bone_Dogg,10,Sat Jul 18 06:11:36 2015 UTC,"I have to be the dissenter here, if for no other reason than one hasn't shown up yet. Lil Wayne will always be one of the most polarizing figures in rap, with legions of fans and haters alike. I don't know if that's just the nature of the game, or just the nature of him. But here's what I'll say. Lil Wayne is the worst popular rapper of all time. He's not good, and while it would be petty to say I have enjoyed his struggles, I have very much welcomed the reprieve from hearing his name on a daily basis."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,SUN-BAT-HER,7,Sat Jul 18 06:20:07 2015 UTC,Can you go more in depth about why you think he isn't a good rapper? Like do you think his rhymes are cheesy/lame or something?
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,crustinXbeiber,3,Sat Jul 18 14:56:10 2015 UTC,"Lil Wayne will always be one of the most polarizing figures in rap, with legions of fans and haters alike   I hate to be so blunt about this, but the difference between Lil Wayne and any other rapper that people hate (except Kanye is in this category too), is that people who hate him almost invariably don't know anything about rap.   There's a reason so many rappers have Lil Wayne on their lists of best rappers of all time, and it's not because he's ""the worst popular rapper of all time.""  I mean, you can not like Lil Wayne because of his lyrical content or squeaky voice or choice in production or whatever, but he's objectively a good rapper."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,zabblepants,3,Sat Jul 18 17:56:15 2015 UTC,"Your last point is about how I feel about Lil Wayne. I thing his lyrics are pretty good, and I definitely recognize his influence on rap music and pop music over the years. After all, all of the rappers that I listen to like Lil Wayne. I just can't get past his voice. I respect him as an artist, but I just don't like how he sounds, and that's okay. I don't have anything against him like so many people seem to.  He seems to get a lot of undeserved shit."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,rbace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:30:43 2015 UTC,"There is nothing objective about what you think is good or not. I agree with the poster, he is the worst rapper that has ever been considered good."

Francis Bacon, for example, was objectively a talented painter, but made ugly, non commercial paintings.  You're confusing stuff you don't like with being bad.  Like I can't stand Eminem, but I would never be arrogant enough to call him a bad rapper just because I hate his voice and the stuff he raps about.  It's absurd to disagree with the vast majority of people who know what they're talking about just because of a personal preference.   Again, find me anybody who knows anything about rap who thinks Lil Wayne is a bad rapper.  There are a ton of rappers who think he's the one of the best rappers of all time, and it's bizarre  to think you know more about rap than people who do it for a living."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,rbace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:45 2015 UTC,a technically skilled artist is not equal to a good artist. I would argue that Lil Wayne is not a particularly technically skilled rapper either. Whether you think it's good or not is as subjective as can be.
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,Starch,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:23 2015 UTC,"This post is reminding me that I have a documentary on Wayne (""The Carter"" - 2009) that I have not yet watched.  I'm coming from a perspective of someone who missed the boat on Lil Wayne. I remember when he became huge, and the stories about his gifted ability at such a young age, the guitar playing on stage, the skinny jeans and skateboarding (which was really far out at the time, for a young black rapper).   I became more aware of him musically in the last few years. It seems like he (created?) developed and perfected a certain style that was so hugely influential, but then as an artist where do you go from there? I've seen this in other artists in others genres: take James Holden, who almost literally created an entire genre of electronic music back in the 2000s, but then had other artists come after and eclipse him. For me, influence is one of the biggest measuring points of any creative person. I think Lil Wayne scores very high with this. The Beatles did it with rock & roll, but also evolved into a much different sounding act in the later years. I think if Wayne is guilty of anything, it's that he was unable to evolve, and that may be due more to the stagnant nature of hip-hop/pop music than his own talent. For example, the new album by Future, DS2, sounds stale in 2015 but people are still paying attention.  Wayne never really seems to 'sell out' in a way that other successful artists have. He still seems focused on putting out new music. Even if he retires at some point from recording, he may have a successful career in the future as a Dr. Dre-like figure, or just sticking with running a record label."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,frenchhornhero,2,Sat Jul 18 20:02:27 2015 UTC,"Tha Carter III changed rap music for me. I love that album from top to bottom, and I absolutely agree that his seemingly lazy style is curious and unique. I don't know if he'll ever get the respect he deserves, but Wayne is one of the greatest rappers ever. Period."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,bunzthefarmer,3,Sat Jul 18 00:53:30 2015 UTC,"Most influential rapper of all time?  Not sure I can stand by that YET, but he is talented as fuck and still has so much to offer the world of music.  To have a genius of music still working and producing in the world is amazing -- can you imagine if we still had Pac or BIG blessing the mic?  I think about that every day and the possibilities of true legends being able to carry on their legacy for decades...  Weezy not proven yet??"
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,Miguelito-Loveless,2,Sat Jul 18 03:30:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ""the most influential rapper of all time"" comment was perhaps the most off base thing OP wrote.  Most of the things that Weezy is given credit for predate him by 20 years or so.  If you want to find the most influential rapper of all time you need to go back to the 90s (at least) but probably the you need to go back to the 70s or 80s.  Any rapper from this century simply didn't have the chance to influence early rappers while a rapper from the 70s or 80s could have influenced nearly everyone (and still be influencing people)."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,crustinXbeiber,6,Sat Jul 18 17:50:53 2015 UTC,"Rakim is undoubtedly the most influential rapper of all time.  I don't think there is anyone who can come close to him on that.  He basically invented two of the most important things for an MC.  The first was flow.  He didn't exactly ""invent"" flow but he revolutionized it.  No one was as smooth as Rakim, and before he came around, rappers would just kind of talk in rhythm to the beat.  Rakim then came and showed people how to flow smoothly with the beat.  The second thing was arguably more influential.  The internal rhyme scheme.  Before Rakim MC's would just rhyme words at the ends of lines.  ""There was a cat, it had a hat"".  He came around and showed everyone how to make everything sound a lot better with his internal rhyme schemes.  He would rhyme multiple syllables in every line, not just the last word.  He was truly revolutionary."
LetsTalkMusic,3dnqv9,Octodab,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:18:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's possible to really have a clear cut single most influential artist of all time, in any genre.  Lil Wayne is inarguably among the most influential rappers though, anyone who argues that he wasn't influential at all (which I see from time to time) is ignorant."
LetsTalkMusic,3doedw,TDKshorty,5,Fri Jul 17 22:43:53 2015 UTC,"I went through a pretty intense Islands phase during college where it was by far my most listened to band.  I got hooked with the song ""Volcanoes"" which is still one of my favorite songs of all time. I actually prefer their more focused songwriting to the proggier stuff, but that's probably just a personal taste. I just think Thornburg is a really fantastic writer of melodies and the simpler tracks seem to service those melodies better.    His new album under the Nick Diamonds moniker is excellent. A continuation of the Vapours sound in a sense."
LetsTalkMusic,3doedw,HaikoopedMyPants,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:46:33 2015 UTC,"I saw Islands play in 2008 and to be honest I was a little bit underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, it was a great show, but like you I am a huge fan of Return to the Sea. They didn't play much from it, and what they did play (Swans and Volcanoes) sounded like another band covering Islands. Maybe it's because I'm not a big fan of Arms Way, maybe it's because Jamie had left the band and Nick was at his strangest/most orchestral, but I left having enjoyed it little more than a band I'd never heard of (which, at a festival, can still be a hell of a lot).  This was disappointing for me. Two of my favourite bands in high school were The Unicorns and Death From Above 1979, and earlier that day I'd seen (and smoked up with) Seb Grainger from DFA. He absolutely killed it. High energy, small crowd, absolutely awesome show. After that, Islands really let me down.  I wish I'd seen them again because I loved Vapours. I think I just picked the worst time in their career to see them play.  And like I said, it was still a spectacular gig. It was awesome. But for some reason I still can't place I was let down."
LetsTalkMusic,3doedw,weavves,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"That's funny, because my girlfriend loves the band too, to the extent that I listen to them all the time and they're generally good and catchy, so she was excited to see them and they played her favorite song, Hallways, and it was actually the worst song of the set, it didn't have the energy that the rest of the songs did, and it was pretty sloppy, but that was the only miss in the entire show.    They played Swans, and I'm not sure about Volcanoes, but they killed it at the show I was at, so I recommend checking them out. Live music is such an organic thing; it's living and breathing and constantly changing so it's easy for a band to play a bad show- it's like going to work; most days you rock your shit, but there are some days where you just can't do your job at all, no matter how hard you try- and music isn't above that."
LetsTalkMusic,3doedw,dreamshoes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:58:31 2015 UTC,"Very pleased to see this here! Islands is one of my all-time favorites, and I feel they never get enough love. Oddly, though, I find Return to the Sea to be my least favorite. It ranks below the Unicorns' record for me as well. Not that it isn't great, but Nick Thorburn had yet to reign in his whimsy, not to mention his penchant for pitchy, over-overdubbed vocals.  Arm's Way though... I heard Islands had a new record so I listened to the headphone samples at a record store and was immediately hooked. I had gotten massively into the Beatles only a year or so prior, and the combination of melodicism and artistry on that album blew me away.  From then on, they've been one of my favorites, even when subsequent albums took huge stylistic turns. It just makes me love Nick's song-writing more. Vapours is loaded with great tunes (hearing them play E.O.L. at a show in 2014 was an unexpected treat), A Sleep and A Forgetting is just beautiful end-to-end, and came at a time when I desperately needed it (uncannily so), and Ski Mask was like an In Rainbows-esque distillation of all their previous sounds.  It was cool seeing Nick get some recognition recently with the Serial podcast, and I will also double down on another commenter's recommendation of the new ""Nick Diamonds"" record, City of Quartz. As per usual, it's packed with great tunes.  Fun Fact: Nick Thorburn has said that he only likes a half-dozen of his own songs. He particularly hates ""Rough Gem,"" their breakout song, and if you search for it, you can find a hilarious audio recording of him ""retiring"" the song at a live show, via a ridiculous rendition in the vocal style of Antony."
LetsTalkMusic,3doedw,Clumpy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:39:03 2015 UTC,"While I do place Return To The Sea as my favorite record of all time- I must say that I've had several obsessions over all of their records and I think that's one thing that makes them better, because there's been several instances of just listening to a single record of theirs for months on end. I've done that several times with all of their records and they all came at a time when I needed them most and I think stylistically- the music I make fits in somewhere between Arm's Way and A Sleep & A Forgetting, mainly because I love prog and I love stripped down, sparse danceable music.    I have listened to his latest release a bit (I loved In The Attic, or whatever it was called) and it's great so far- it reminds me of John Carpenters movies, The Thing and Big Trouble In Little China, like it could be the soundtrack to those movies... I'm not sure why haha.    I saw them live last year with about 50 other people, which is a shame because they deserve to be playing to hundreds of people, but it also made it better because it was so intimate. Nick was smoking a jay outside the venue and we made eye contact and he told me ""Stay in school"" which I thought was funny and during the show they just went off... he was hanging from the rafters and throwing water on everyone and he took some guys beer and drink it and he was in the crowd during ""Can't Feel My Face"" where he proceeded to try and take off my shirt, haha.  Just total punk rock."

I would add that I love O Maria, the slow droning piano and strings, his almost bored voice, it feels like a sad song in an old bar. Through and through this album is such a Beck album. The high points of tropicalia, the lyricism of the whole album, every track has a particular feel to it. Good times."

I  think the lyrics are more approachable than a lot of his other albums. Even the line you mentioned, which is a bit abstract, makes sense when you piece it together. It might just be me but with a lot of his other albums (though certainly not all) I have no idea what he's singing about. This album has a lot of dark lyrics and some of the best of apocalyptic imagery he's made. There's a definite vibe, a theme, throughout. It's one of my favorites (its pretty hard to really rank Beck albums for me, Ive had multiple different favorites at a different times and the mood I'm in kind of determines which album I listen to ) though given the understated music, as you mentioned, it may have less replay value for me. I'll have to listen to it again to test this though. I'd add static to the exception to this as well."
LetsTalkMusic,3do926,chesterfieldkingz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:44:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts on Mutations.  I confess that in the past I've pretentiously scoffed at lyrics as being a superficial musical element suited only to pop/rock.  I've excepted more ""artful"" uses of lyricism when used exclusively as a free-form rhythmic device, (e.g. tape music, My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, or the stream of consciousness spoken-word verse of Karl Hyde).  But the case you make for Mutations clearly vanquishes my stubborn predilection for so-called art music.  The record's melancholy lyricism is one of its greatest strengths."

I gotta admit I thought for awhile this album was pretentious and poorly conceived but it always seemed like their was something more to it that I was missing, so I kept it on my phone. Then one night while I was walking and bored of all my other music so I popped it on and it finally clicked and now it just keeps getting better each listen."
LetsTalkMusic,3do926,acqu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:50:19 2015 UTC,"I've always considered Mutations my favorite Beck album, though if I were being totally honest, it would probably be Midnite Vultures. In any case, I've always been drawn to his ""M"" albums, definitely Modern Guilt, which along with these two make up my clear top 3, and to a lesser extent Morning Phase which is in the mix for #4.  Mutations always just had a subtle draw to me. I wouldn't say there is a standout track, it is just a cohesive album that delivers. It's interesting you focus on the lyrics, I guess I've never really thought of them as the strongest part of the album. Not that they are bad at all, but that it is the cohesion of the lyrics, music, and performance from start to finish that makes the album. In any case, glad to see there are others out there enjoying this one."
LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,Doormatt_z,57,Fri Jul 17 05:26:29 2015 UTC,"me after seeing all these extremely positive reviews (this will probably apply to the new Beach House too)  I've tried. Though I think they're incredibly over-rated even before this album, I otherwise like Tame Impala. This one though... I get the appeal, but it's clearly so much worse than Lonerism yet treated like some kind of landmark achievement despite not being much more than a retro pop album (as opposed to a retro-psych album) that I feel like a slightly lesser known artist would get much more shit for or at least indifference. They say ""meticulous production"", I hear VERY LOUD KEYBOARDS AND VERY LOUD SYNTHBASS but there's a f l a n g e r, so it's 3D-ish or something; at the very least it doesn't sound any more meticulous than his past work.  Let it Happen starts out great, but almost none of the rest of the album shows anywhere near that same degree of creativity; either because it lapses into generic Tears for Fears-like territory, because he didn't seem to write much more than one stanza and gets lost trying to write a chorus (Eventually), or because the breakup songs to Melody Prochet get rather old (with Cause I'm a Man having really embarrassingly bad lyrics). Possibly a bigger problem is that Kevin's voice feels very weak throughout; I almost feel like you could keep almost everything else the same, but if the music had a better, more powerful vocalist, it would work so much better than his thin, nasally tones which have worked in the past, but not this time around.  It's an alright album, but definitely not the instant classic it's made out to be. My nominee for the album most likely to have a quick turnabout in critical consensus. I'm mostly annoyed by the self-backpatting going on.  edit: wording."
LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,feedthecollapse,8,Fri Jul 17 09:49:10 2015 UTC,"I think you've summed it up the best with this   despite not being much more than a retro pop album (as opposed to a retro-psych album)   While I actually really enjoyed some songs and specific moments on this record (I'm a sucker for simpler, melodic music), I sort of wish this was not a Tame Impala record, and maybe a KP side project. It's just not the Tame Impala I'm used to. I especially like what you said about it not being very meticulous, which is very true. Lonnerism probably had more attention to detail than Currents. I was listening to Melody's Echo Chamber last night for the first time, and I could actually sort of hear a bridge between the Lonnerism and the Currents sound. Despite all this, I thought the album was a very good pop style record. Not a classic or a favorite of 2015, but it's still good imo"
LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,ReallyNotBilly,12,Fri Jul 17 13:00:12 2015 UTC,I feel like a Kevin Parker Side project would be just as meaningless as a Trent Reznor side project.

LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,alabrasa301,5,Fri Jul 17 13:56:36 2015 UTC,I guess what I mean is that this album would probably be more accepted if it didn't have the Tame Impala name on it.

Especially since ""Man"" was released as a standalone single, it seemed to reinforce a narrative I'm really tired of hearing. Even at the pop song level it adds to a collective rhetorical idea that frames men as unable to control their own bad behavior and does them more harm than good."

The whole album feels very phoned in to me and very uninspired. It commits the worst crime of a follow up to me - it's just lame and boring not attempting anything new but is just a faint echo of what came before. If much rather them fail at trying something a little new. It's a very forgettable release for me. But maybe it's just my mood. I've been digging harder stuff of late and the current indie scene consistently fails in that regard.

I really can't sugar coat much, I think this is an average project. this is my opinion. All the loops and uninteresting filler just puts me to sleep every time I listen to it. There are just so many more albums of this nature that I would rather listen to..Depeche Mode, Passion Pit, Simple Minds, Kraftwerk, Future Islands, Fever Ray, Grimes, CHVRCHES, Shamir, LCD Soundsystem, NIN's first album, just to name a few.   I liked a few tracks and the production was fantastic. Not crazy about the sequencing or melodies though. I don't mind the change in essence. I much prefer Lonerism by a long shot. I'm sorry guys I tried. I don't like it."

LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,certainsomebody,8,Fri Jul 17 14:27:02 2015 UTC,Violator is a masterpiece. I also love Delta Machine and Music for the Masses

LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,TrixieGrace,20,Fri Jul 17 17:56:50 2015 UTC,"Having been listening to it for basically the last 2 weeks, I can definitely say that I believe it's a fantastic album. It's very different from Kevin's previous works but I feel its better for it. Lonerism (which is also brilliant) to me felt like the obvious extension or path to take from Innerspeaker. Not that it makes the album worse (it certainly does not) but I got more of a wow factor when I first listened to Currents after having listened and been exposed to Innerspeaker+Lonerism for a few years.  I feel like the cleaner mixing and sound of both vocals and instruments benefits the album. My only complaint is that I didn't get a ""Holy Shit!"" moment from the drums on the record. 'Mind Mischief' from Lonerism comes to mind as a song with phenomenal drumming and I feel that there isn't anything on Currents that matches that. Not that the drumming is bad, just that I was spoilt by Kevin's previous work on drums.  Overall I'm loving the album and I find myself constantly always wanting to go back to listen to it when I'm listening to something else that isn't 'Currents'."
LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,VHSMasterRace,2,Fri Jul 17 08:00:22 2015 UTC,"To me, that holy shit moment from the drums comes with Nangs. It's so groovy and perfect"
LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,papalvo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:41:17 2015 UTC,"I'm actually a little bit of a newcomer to Tame Impala. I've heard Lonerism maybe twice, but to be honest, it wasn't memorable enough for me to know what to expect on this album. That groovy melody in Nangs told me this was going to be a very good experience, and Eventually confirmed it. It felt so womb-like."
LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,hatewrecked2,6,Sun Jul 19 08:41:57 2015 UTC,"Only part of the review I did. Overall I was pretty disappointed. Anyway:   The hooks on this record were essential because “Currents” is much more of a pop album than a psychedelic rock record. Tracks like “The Moment” and “The Less I know the Better” feature catchy choruses to match the synth work that lays the very foundation of the record and result in great tracks. A funky electric bass grooves through these tracks like an adhesive holding everything together when it wants to burst in many different exciting directions. However, on the second half of the record the tracks begin to lose their steam. “Currents” goes through a lot of different tones and sound compressions, yet the tracks still seem to end up being predictable. They crescendo through ballad phases where Kevin Parker sings about isolation, relationships, and self-actualization before implementing a larger dynamic range with a deep bass synth to create such an effect. Riddled throughout this record are shorter instrumental tracks. I see this as a risky move because it makes creating a cohesive project more challenging, but it has been done successfully before (see Pet Sounds). I think Parker does a really good job weaving these short instrumentals together. Most of these tracks are lush and could have been stand out tracks if they were fleshed out a bit more.  This album is riddled with moments worthy of praise but one thing became very obvious as the album carried on.  I couldn’t help but be struck by the idea that Kevin Parker seems to struggle to write a truly catchy pop hook. This was compensated for with heavy vocal effects in order to create a dense sound that comes off as cheesy 80s pop music a lot of the time. “Lonerism” was a the perfect medium between the sounds that bookend Tame Impala’s discography. The heavy distorted vocal effects compliment music that is swirling with psychedelic guitar and melody, but on “Currents” Kevin Parker seems to go for his best impression of Beach House which payed off some of the time, but not all of it."
LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,haveyouheardthatnew,10,Fri Jul 17 15:00:17 2015 UTC,"I disliked this album after listening on my shitty headphones on NPR all week.  I thought it was just OK and Pitchfork is smoking something.  After listening to it today on decent speakers, I can say I was completely wrong.  The bass makes this album.  I think it might be near the top of my personal AOTY list.   It really is a natural progression from Lonerism.  It sounds completely different, but there is no mistake it's the same artist, which I think makes for a perfect ""transition"" album.  Maybe I'm giving Parker too much credit, but I think the simple lyrics are what works for the album.  It's almost like he purposefully wrote an album of simple breakup song lyrics as a juxtaposition of the busy music.  The lyrics seem kind of weak, but still genuine and purposeful."
LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,mycleverusername,11,Fri Jul 17 13:56:30 2015 UTC,"Meh, they are pretentious, but they were right about Alt-J.  Took me until they put out their second album to realize Pitchfork was on the right side of history for that review of An Awesome Wave.    Don't get me wrong, An Awesome Wave is one of my favorite albums, but I totally understand that review and don't hold it against them.  As for Tool, they probably never had any business reviewing them anyways.  It's not really Pitchfork's ""thing"" and it's not like their albums are crossover classics."
LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,mycleverusername,4,Fri Jul 17 14:24:17 2015 UTC,What did the deleted comment say? Interested about your Alt-J comment - I really liked An Awesome Wave but didn't give the new album a go.
LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,werrrrrd,3,Fri Jul 17 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"It said something like ""pitchfork was always smoking something. Look at how they treated Alt J and Tool."""
LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,mycleverusername,10,Tue Jul 21 23:35:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't get the full album experience until it streamed on NPR earlier this week. I loved Let It Happen from the first time I heard it and it has yet to lose it's impact after dozens of listens. it's clearly the stand-out of the album and an incredible opener. it's also a bit of a deceptive opener since the rest of the album is not what anyone was expecting. It sounded more like what I thought the entire album would sound like, but doesn't...still sort of psychedelic in a grandiose fashion, but hey....I can dance to this!  what followed was so different, but it all feels so natural. I was sold on my first listen. it flowed nicely, I loved the synths, it was a good headphone listen, I was surprised by how confessional it was and I immediately wanted to listen to it again and get to know it better.  it reminds me a bit of the last Daft Punk album. people were expecting something much different, were mildly shell-shocked and then seemed to embrace the experience. I'm wondering if that might be the case with Currents since I can't really pick apart anything regarding the quality of the album; it's just not what I was used to from Tame Impala. I think that makes the album more interesting for me, personally. It'll be interesting to see how it sounds in 3-4 months."
LetsTalkMusic,3dle6u,RSTROMME,4,Wed Jul 22 00:00:26 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest here and say Lonerism was is one of my favorite albums and has tons of replay value to me. I thought it was emotional, instrumentally sound, and the underlying theme of loneliness/depression/alienation really appealed to me. Although the lyrics were a tad bland, I felt like they were raw and real. The only real downside on it was the opening track Gotta Be Above It for me, but that track even conveyed a certain message. ""gotta be above it, gotta be above it, gotta be above it"" had a sense of paranoia and self checking I related with.  I waited to listen because I was honestly scared for this release. How could they top their last album or even come close to it? The singles seemed weak and I was legitimately bummed.  I'm listening for the first time now on some nice headphones and have a couple thoughts.  The production is pretty tight and well done. Ethereal and poppy, not a bad thing in my book, but don't mesh nearly as well this time around. This time around the simple lyrics don't hold much ground for me and it seems like the tracks were produced almost independently. Yes, they have similar themes but they just don't keep you in the album like they did Lonerism. Theres a punch to the album but it seems much more artificial. Songs like Eventually seem out of place with their over the top instrumentals and no vocal emotion. Kevin Parker just doesn't seem nearly as real on this one to me. It seems like Tame Impala just sat down and said ""lets just make another album, but this time lets make it pop/punch"" and then they came up with some basslines, a couple lyrical focal points, and then threw their classic synth on it. Could you say this for Lonerism to an extent? Probably... but did it feel like that? I would argue no.  My main qualms after one time through:   Maybe I've missed it my first run through the album but where the heck are the drums? Why go this deep into a pop sound, make the production more clean, and then not improve upon the lyrics? Some of the tracks really are nothing special. Songs like Love/Paranoia seem to have a deep meaning to KP but I don't think the instrumentals match.   I'd give this thing probably 6.5/10. It hurts me to type, but I can almost guarantee this wont be in my rotation in 2 months. I'm pretty bad on articulating my thoughts on music, but I'm trying to get better. I'm going to give it at least 4 spins before I fully decide but its not looking fantastic so far. Anyone disagree?"
LetsTalkMusic,3dmvi0,BeelzebozoNoGo,2,Fri Jul 17 15:44:17 2015 UTC,"I just listened to the album a few days ago and the riffs are still lingering in my mind as well as the gnarly album art. Upon first listening to ""Bridgburner"", the title track, I knew I was going to dig the fast and fuzzy riffs but the vocals did not do it for me at all. I can definitely listen to them because of the awesome music, but Brodsky just sounds like something I'd hear from a butt rock band. I know its not quite that bad, but I just can't shake it."
LetsTalkMusic,3dmvi0,Yollaj,2,Fri Jul 17 17:33:33 2015 UTC,What sort of vocals do you think would better pair with the music?
LetsTalkMusic,3dmvi0,Yollaj,2,Fri Jul 17 17:37:37 2015 UTC,"Something definitely more gritty, along the lines of Uncle Acid & The Deadbeats, Windhand, or even the Melvins. The bands musical power is amazing, and I think a raspy and sludgy vocalist who doesn't use nu metal-ish vocal progressions could really fit well."

LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,colt_horton,35,Thu Jul 16 23:30:39 2015 UTC,"All I have to say is that AnCo completely revitalized this genre. By using samplers, they were (and still are) free to make any sounds they feel like and bring them over to the live setting, something the Beatles were never able to do due to technological constraints and other reasons. I love Tame Impala too, but Animal Collective really gets that psychedelic sweet spot, man."
LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,GirTheRobot,6,Fri Jul 17 04:55:57 2015 UTC,"Ok I love psychedelic music, but I have no idea where to start with Animal Collective. I love Spacemen 3 and people always tell me to check out AnCo, but I really don't know what to listen to. Any recommendations?"
LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,Jackmorgan888,7,Fri Jul 17 12:13:11 2015 UTC,"Man, you are in for a treat. Here is a great flowchart that could be useful. As it says the most accessible way to jump in to AnCo's discography is probably Merriweather Post Pavilion. It's their poppiest record and their most accessible. I'd suggest 'In the Flowers' and 'My Girls' from that one. From there you can move onto some more of their popular releases like Strawberry Jam, Sung Tongs and Feels. Once you have a feel for them also make sure to check out some of the member's solo stuff! Panda Bear's Person Pitch and Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper are both fantastic. One of my favourite tracks of his is 'Tropic of Cancer'. It's like the orchestral pop of The Beach Boys with a sweet electronic twist. Avey Tare also has some great (and some very strange) stuff. Avey Tare's Slasher Flicks' Enter the Slasher House is quite enjoyable. 'Little Fang' off of that is great! If you like all of that don't be afraid to dig into some of their weirder releases like Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished. I can't personally say that I 'get' all of their work, especially the earlier, more experimental stuff but I think I'm getting there! Anyway, I just hope this can be of some assistance! Happy listening!"

LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,AlvinRowYourBoat,2,Fri Jul 17 12:37:22 2015 UTC,"I love Person Pitch, but I wouldn't really describe that album as psychedelic. I think Strawberry Jam is a better place to start, Peacebone is an opening song that really hits you."

LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,lukeuidswords,11,Fri Jul 17 09:41:36 2015 UTC,"Psychedelic bands often used new recording techniques and effects, drawing on non-Western sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.   The Beatles were definitely one of the first to use Indian influences in pop music. I consider them the first popular psychedelic group, with tracks like Love You To, Tomorrow Never Knows, and Within You Without You. It was obviously due to George's interest in Indian culture and religion that drew the group to make tracks like that. I haven't seen newer groups use that kind of sound for psychedelic music, so it'd be interesting to hear modern psychedelic music with indian influence that has that sort of droning that Love You To has."

LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,Miguelito-Loveless,15,Fri Jul 17 05:12:05 2015 UTC,"I just didnt like the soul-less mainstream commercialism that came out of music in the age of Bush(Not that its much different today). I did not identify with the mainstream music of that day(still don't)    Just remember that the vast majority of psychedelic music from the 70s was not on mainstream radio.  Do a quick search for Billboard data from a particular year in the 70s, and I think you will find a lot of music that you would describe as soulless and crappy. for example  From Captain & Tennille to Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes, the radio hits of that era didn't over lap terribly well with psychedelia in particular or even classic rock in general.    So the modern era (or Bush era) isn't that much different from any golden era of music.  I just had to write that because   I grew up believing that this new age brought in the death of music (well good music).   Now I am off to find out what the hell Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes is all about.  My curiosity has been peaked."
LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,Thismessishers,8,Fri Jul 17 03:48:47 2015 UTC,I grew up believing that this new age brought in the death of music (well good music).    People have likely been claiming this since the dawn of music and they've always been dead wrong.

LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,FarArdenlol,8,Wed Jul 22 02:24:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's really unfair to say this 'new age' has brought a death to music. I also think the sub-genre of new psychedelic is an interesting one because the initial emergence of ""psychedelic"" music seemed to be a greater statement about western youths and their desire to strip away the normative chains - especially in reference to war, freedom and conceptions of the socially functioning individual.   With modern psychdelia, I don't really know what it's trying to say - but it's fucking fun.  I love Animal Collective, Black Moth Super Rainbow (ugh! my fave, esp. the early stuff), Unknown Mortal Orchestra, anything Ty Segall has his hands in (Fuzz, White Fence, King Tuff, etc.), but I think what's more interesting is incredibly small acts doing new psychedelic - like Homebody or Each Other or Joel Jerome or whatever (I just deleted a bunch::::). I could go on and on and on. But, my basic point is what the new psychedelic feeling feels like - it's liquid and carefree and good to feel to. It's a dismissal of woe, rather than a celebration or a call to something. And, I think maybe that's great."
LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,Cilicia,11,Fri Jul 17 05:43:33 2015 UTC,"Most of my favorite rock songs are psychedelic. A good example of modern psychedelic band are probably Temples. Pond and Tame Impala do have some psychedelic gems as well though.  But I have yet to find a modern band with cohesive psychedelic album and not just few psychedelic influenced tracks per album and the rest is blended with psych-pop, indie rock or whatever.  I always liked more psychedelic influenced songs by Doors, Beatles, Velvet Underground, also by Pink Floyd with my favorite psychedelic rock song. Also Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun.  I would gladly check out any psychedelic rock bands recommendations, since I'm not well versed in modern rock bands at all and generally mostly listen to older groups.   Anyone knows any Bowie's psychedelic songs ? I've checked Zappa's more psychedelic influenced albums but they were always more experimental than psychedelic for my tastes.  Already planning to check Mountain Goats album, Smash Mouth, Toro Y Moi earlier work, Vic Chesnutt, Colour Haze, etc. But always open for more recommendations."
LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,Womar23,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:57:53 2015 UTC,"Smash Mouth? Not hating, but are you in the right thread?  As for Bowie, his psychedelic stuff was early in his career. Hunky Dory is a classic, it mixes Folk, psychedelic, and pop music. Before it, you have The Man That Sold The World. It's more rock, less folk, but in my opinion doesn't match the quality of Hunky Dory. Someone else will have to fill me in on his first two albums, but the song Space Oddity is a classic from that era.   Edit: Also, his later work definitely has psychedelic moments. Check out the song Ashes To Ashes, or ""A New Career In Town"""
LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,crustinXbeiber,12,Fri Jul 17 01:16:25 2015 UTC,"Bowie's album Heathen is pretty psychedelic but in a more modern-sounding way, a good mix of atmospherics and pop. Heathen (The Rays) is a good example of the style. Even though it's from 2002, it's up there as one of my favorite Bowie albums."

I find this statement sort of strange, there was never really a psychedelic sound, per se.  60's psychedelia included everything from Can style jazz-freakiness to The Incredible String Band's english/world folk to avant garde groups like The United States of America to proto-punk like The Red Krayola.  It was always a varied movement drawing from a variety of influences.   The genre seems to have more to do with a willingness to engage with experimentation and drug culture than any actual sound."
LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,AdamasMustache,2,Fri Jul 17 00:09:27 2015 UTC,"Beatles had Revolver which was like 90% psychedelic project. Doors had The Doors, Strange Days, Waiting For The Sun and Soft Parade (even Morrison Hotel) which almost fully consisted of psychedelic tracks. But generally bands weren't doing full psychedelic inspired albums, it was mostly just a couple of tracks in that fashion on each project. Pink Floyd did this, imo.  I mean, I can't really agree with that statement that psychedelia is not a sound as well. A song like White Rabbit or Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds definitely represents a certain sound. I don't really know how to put it into words, it just sounds psychedelic. You could compare e.g. Yesterday with Tomorrow Never Comes or I'm a Walrus with Girl, and you will clearly be able to tell which two are psychedelic.  Also I tried to link Closing My Eyes by Fleetwood Mac but seems like song's not available on YouTube or Spotify and it's one of the greatest psychedelic tracks I've heard.

From my point of view it evolved and I like what it evolved into and I'm not into the current revival of old sounds because I got into the '80s psych revival when that was happening (Plasticland, United States of Existence, Slickee Boys etc.) and also got into all the garage psych from the '60s as well as a fair bit of stuff like 13th Floor Elevators at the same time.    So I don't believe music is dead and the latest resurgence is the saviour. There's so much great new stuff out there. There is shit too but always has been."
LetsTalkMusic,3dkboj,Ov3rpowered,2,Fri Jul 17 19:43:17 2015 UTC,"I don't listen to the genre anymore because I felt like I've listened to so much nothing new could surprise me, but still I really really enjoy The Brian Jonestown Massacre. They're a bit hit and miss but the guy's (Anton Newcombe) dedication to music is incredible. He was basically the Jesus of 90's California neopsych revival. The list of musicians who once were in his band is at least 100 names long, some of which are now famous, like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's Peter Hayes (other associated acts are for example Lovetones, Out Crowd, Joel Gion, Spindrift, Black Ryder and many others).   They range from shoegazy psych (Methodrone), Rolling Stones-y rock (Take it From the Man!), Beatles-y eastern influenced psych (Their Satanic Majesties Second Request), electronically influenced psych (Aufheben), country/folky songs (Bringing It All Back Home - Again) or even some post-punky influences (Bravery, Repetition and Noise). Their discography is huge. Anton even made an ""imaginary soundtrack"" for a non existent 60's New French Wave movie, called Musique de film Imaginé. They managed to put out their arguably best three albums all in a single year while high on drugs. There is a documentary about them and their friends from The Dandy Warhols called DIG!, where you can clearly see what kind of life they lived. These days they reunited in a pretty stable lineup and are very fun to see live. Their sound is a bit rough at the edges, but their music feels very genuine and authentic. I think that the man was somehow born too late, because in the 60's he would have been a full blown rockstar.  Other interesting stuff: Dead Meadow, Black Angels, Psychic Ills, Dead Ghosts, Dolly Rocker Movement, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard etc."

I agree, sometimes Psychedelia becomes very monotonous at times, I do like to switch out genres every now and then.

They shot footage of several years and when Dandies started to be really popular the directors agenda was to make Dandies seem successful and hip while BJM like a bunch of creative but ultimately hopeless junkies. In some interviews with both bands they both say that it was manipulative and they'd never do it again. What's interesting is that when you look at the situation today, I would even say that BJM is doing better - definitely artistically, but as far as popularity goes they are probably a bit ahead as well."

It fits in well with the one man team (marketing wise) of Tame Impala.

Things like Echo & The Bunnymen, The Stone Roses, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Butthole Surfers, The Church, The Three O'clock, The Dukes of Stratosphear, Galaxie 500, My Bloody Valentine, The Screaming Trees, and Spacemen 3.  Some of the modern bands people have been touting honestly don't have a lot of staying power for me; Levitation Room is a good example of something that quickly got stale for me as well as stuff like The Mystic Braves or The Blank Tapes. Finding modern acts who are actually doing interesting stuff with the genre is a bit rare and it seems like there is a big swath of bands putting out low quality revivalist psych that after first listen becomes old quickly. There's also a lot of garage stuff being put out that sounds so similar because of how lofi it is that it makes it hard for me to feel any identity or individuality from such bands.   There are however a fair share of talented bands too. I'm not very fond of the new Tame impala album but Innerspeaker and Lonerism will always have a place in my collection. Temples' debut was so fucking rad when I first heard it, I've probably replayed it too much though as it's started to become a bit boring very recently for me though I am looking forward to their second album which is in the works. Pond also has just been getting better with every release and while I am not a fan of their early stuff their latest album is fantastic. King Gizzard may be my favorite psych band currently though just because of the range they cover in their music, jumping between acid garage and Dead Head jam band, while Unknown Mortal Orchestra is great for providing a niche I didn't even know needed filling.   Mostly though, as I've expended the pool of good modern bands to discover, I've mostly been looking towards the next wave of bands which have yet to prove themselves but show promise, bands like Sunflower Bean, Fever The Ghost, Stardeath and White Dwarfs, and The Murlocs. Morgan Delt is also an interesting up and comer with a sophomore album due out from subpop I believe, though I feel like the music he had made so far requires drugs to truly sound their best, so I am slightly hopeful that he will make something a little more accessible with his new stuff although it is doubtful."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,POCK3TBOOKrocks,13,Thu Jul 16 22:07:40 2015 UTC,"In any argument or debate, you must have a definition for the terms you are using.   Is ""pop"" for you popular music? Some popular artists are adored by critics (Kanye, Taylor Swift, Beyonce).  Is ""pop"" a specific term for describing music with highly accessible sounds, as some charts (billboard, bugs, etc)) like using as a genre?  I don't think I've seen anyone say pop is not art. If the drawings I've made in art class in first grade is ""art"", the arguing over whether pop music is art is pointless. Pure semantics. Critics are there to judge if something is ""good"" or ""original"", although opinions may vary regarding this."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,lejialus,6,Thu Jul 16 23:21:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, opinions do go into something. And by ""pop,"" I'm really talking about the catchy, dancey music you hear on the charts nowadays. Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Rihanna, Ariana Grande, Meghan Trainor, Nicki Minaj, etc.  And yes, I have seen people call pop music ""not art."" I saw another thread on this same subreddit where someone was discussing this very thing."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,lejialus,3,Fri Jul 17 11:43:59 2015 UTC,"Meh music will be music. I often use the label ""good"" and ""bad"" to describe some music, but my opinions often differ from those of others. But I think the language we choose to judge music with are conventions set not to judge with absolute objective knowledge, but rather to project our subjective view of the world onto others.  Some people just say something is ""not art"" if they don't like it. I think that's fine. Art has such an ambiguous definition anyways. There is a lot of music I like that others might dismiss. That seems fine to me. If no one had any criteria for listening to music , we might as well just all listen to ambient noise."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,nmitchell076,12,Fri Jul 17 22:12:27 2015 UTC,"""It will not remembered in 50 years!"" - I honestly don't even understand this one. In 50 years, anyone could listen to today's music just as much as we can listen to music from 50 years ago. Thus, we'll remember it. So... saying that music will ""not be remembered"" doesn't even make any sense in itself.   Precisely what portion of the music that was written in 1965 is still ""remembered"" today. Some is, but I'd say probably the vast majority of it is forgotten. You seem to be (perhaps deliberately?) misunderstanding what people are saying here. The argument isn't that people 50 years from now won't be able to access the music of today, but rather that no one, or not a sizeable portion of the population, will want to. If your going to critique this point, at least critique it for what it actually says.   You seem to hold this position: it's music, people like it, therefore it is good. As though what the public at large likes is a wholly grassroots effort. I don't think that's entirely true. People like what they are exposed to in pleasurable circumstances. Expose people enough to it, and they will like it. This is known in the psychology literature as the ""mere exposure effect."" It is a fair hypothesis, therefore, to say that the music that is popular is popular merely because people hear it a lot, rather than having any bearing whatsoever on the actual quality of the music itself.   I'm a lover of pop. But it's a stretch to say that if people like it, it must be inherently good. People may actually just like  anything that is played on top 40s radio, simply because they are exposed to that sound and become used to it. So we cannot really use that as a measure of quality. If we wanted to use listener responses, I think we would need to control for exposure. But even then, it'd be tricky to get anything that even remotely close to accurate quality assessment.   I'm not even sure what this post is ultimately arguing. But let me ask you this: what do good and bad mean when applied to music at all? You say we can't say pop music is bad. What are the criteria for saying something is good? Or bad for that matter. Are good and bad useless concepts? Then what even is artistic criticism?"
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,nmitchell076,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:53:06 2015 UTC,"""Good"" and ""bad"" are both subjective factors. The idea that any music is supposedly ""good"" or ""bad"" exists in the minds of those who listen to it. Just because everyone likes a type of music doesn't ultimately decide it's ""good."" It's good by their standards. But if you don't like it, then it's bad by your standards. That's perfectly fine."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,nmitchell076,6,Fri Jul 17 11:41:58 2015 UTC,"Okay. Is quality different from these judgments? If so, what factors would go into that judgment? I, for instance, recognize that Bach is quality music, even though I don't particularly like it. So it must be a different kind of judgment from good and bad.   Can we say we like music even though we recognize it isn't particularly high quality? And that we don't like some music even though we recognize that it is well-crafted? I think there are instances of both of these things occurring in our evaluation of art."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,nmitchell076,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:45:15 2015 UTC,"To me, quality is a factor of how the music was created. The factors that go into judgment are: Personal opinions and preferences and experiences. That's all you really need to judge music. Quality does not necessarily have to go into judging music, but it can if you really want it to."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,nmitchell076,3,Fri Jul 17 20:53:08 2015 UTC,"Well, now we have an answer. You submit that one can say that music is well-crafted or not. So why don't we just take this stereotype:   It's all autotuned and not their real voices!... It's made by a computer, not by an instrument! It sounds the same! It's manufactured! It will not be remembered in 50 years!   And take them to be saying not ""this music is bad,"" but rather ""this music is not well-crafted."" What would you say to that?"
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,RymeswithOrange,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:18:28 2015 UTC,"If someone believes music is not well-crafted and uses that as a reason to not like pop music, that's, once again, their opinion. I explained in the main part of my post why I think all those statements are false. If, however, you are still too stubborn to agree and want to dismiss what I say and keep to your opinions, I don't have a problem with that. But keep it to yourself."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,Uneje,6,Fri Jul 17 22:39:29 2015 UTC,"Well you didn't keep your opinions to yourself, so why should anyone else?   And for the record, you didn't prove that a lot of those were wrong. You mainly said ""so what?"" For instance, in your response, you did not argue that people are wrong to say that this music isn't produced by a computer.  In fact, you said that it is, but you just said people like it.   Well, one could say ""yeah, well who cares if they like it? Music made by computers isn't as well-crafted as music made by humans."" We've already ascertained that people can like things that are not well-crafted, and dislike things that are well-crafted. So, the naysayer would retort, these people don't like bad music, but they like music that isn't well-crafted.   I should add that I am sympathetic to your main points. I am a huge fan of pop music. But I'm trying to inhabit the mindset of someone who wouldn't just accept your points at face value for the sake of discussion. I really don't think this argument of yours would convince someone who didn't already agree with your starting positions. They would just say ""yeah, well they just like music that is not well-crafted."" And, really, that isn't a step forward. Because those people are still on their high horses, except now they have the ability to say ""I'm better than you because I like music that's well-crafted and you don't."" For the argument to work, we would need to work that through. Otherwise, you're just preaching to people who already agree with you, and not really making a real argument."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,nmitchell076,0,Fri Jul 17 22:49:50 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind I am not a debater. I can give you reasons for why I like something and why everyone should have open opinions, but beyond that, I can really say nothing more.  Those opinions others have I think people should keep to themselves because they are very insulting to those who do like it. Mine are more open and allow everyone's thoughts to be accepted. I know that makes it look like my opinions are better than others, but what I'm really trying to say is that people should be more open to other peoples' thoughts and not judge them because their opinions differ from theirs.  As for the ""it isn't well-crafted"" thing... like I said, that's up to someone's interpretations for judging music. I don't put it in mine, but I know many people do. If someone who doesn't like pop music can tell me in a good, clear way why that is a valid argument and be open to the opposing opinion's views instead of blindly shutting them down, that would make me happy. Simply saying ""it isn't well-crafted"" is a poor argument and needs to be backed up with more proof.  I've already given you plenty of evidence for my point of view. I'd like to hear the point of view for the opposing opinion, and see what they have to say. Then, I can tell you my response to them for the sake of a discussion."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,nmitchell076,2,Fri Jul 17 22:57:53 2015 UTC,"Well I think we would need to decide on some agreed upon manner of telling whether a song is well-crafted or not. And also debate the connection between opinions and sentiments. Perhaps we could invite David Hume to the discussion? (see my other point), that really, it's the analysis of someone who is adept at pushing beyond the details of a song, well-practiced in the art of criticism, has a fine ability to make comparisons and analyze, has a mind free from all prejudices, and has the good sense to synthesize everything into a meaningful analysis that can tell us what works of art are well crafted and what are not?   In short, I think discussing Hume's argument (probably in the comment thread where I initially summarized it) would probably be the next best step for this debate."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,Uneje,5,Fri Jul 17 23:06:20 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of skill goes into writing music that is very catchy. I don't believe all pop music is good but I do respect a lot of it. Also pop vocalists tend to be very talented. Is it art? I'd say so, pop music is still music and music is art."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,Miguelito-Loveless,6,Fri Jul 17 02:57:01 2015 UTC,"Pop music on the radio is 1% of the pop music produced, it is very diverse. I think that answers you ""manufactured"" claim. Radio pop may be, but a lot of it isn't (just like any other genre ever). As for whether it's art, of course it is. Some is terrible art, some is horrible. Like anything else."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,nmitchell076,-1,Thu Jul 16 23:07:51 2015 UTC,"""Some is terrible art, some is horrible. Like anything else.""   That's subjective, and up to someone's opinions. No one person's view on whether something is ""horrible"" or ""terrible"" lives as the normal for everyone."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,nmitchell076,2,Fri Jul 17 11:45:08 2015 UTC,"I wonder how you would deal with someone who retorted, ""well, some people's opinions are simply more correct on these matters than others""   (not saying I believe this, but just wondering how you'd respond to that argument)."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,nmitchell076,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:08:57 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'd say: That's not true! Art is not a governed thing! It's called entertainment! How we rate entertainment our society has decided is subjective--meaning it is someone's opinion. The idea of not liking or liking someone is up to someone's own thoughts and interpretations, and no one is wrong for liking anything. I'm sure I could find at least ONE person who likes the song ""Friday"" by Rebecca Black... if I really tried to look for them."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,Miguelito-Loveless,2,Fri Jul 17 20:44:52 2015 UTC,"This is a classic problem in aesthetics, addressed most directly by David Hume. Hume distinguishes between ""Sentiments"" and ""Opinions"" (or ""Judgments""). I'll quote his explanation:   Among a thousand different opinions which different men may entertain of the same subject, there is one, and but one, that is just and true; and the only difficulty is to fix and ascertain it. On the contrary, a thousand different sentiments, excited by the same object, are all right: Because no sentiment represents what is really in the object. It only marks a certain formity or relation between the object and the organs or faculties of the mind; and if that conformity did not really exist, the sentiment could never possibly have being.   (Hume, ""On the Standard of Taste"").   So Hume recognizes that it would be absurd to claim that certain sentiments are unfounded or invalid: your reactions are your reactions. But he argues that this is a different thing from accurately judging how good an artwork is. Only someone with a correctly cultivated sense of taste can really pass judgment on the quality of an artwork.   That's really all that's relevant to move the conversation forward, but as an addendum, I'll list the qualities that Hume says an accurate judge of quality would have:  1) ""Delicacy of Imagination"" - A judge should be able to go beyond the obvious to see the subtle qualities of a work.   2) A judge should be well-practiced in criticism itself, and should ideally even have experience making art him/herself.   3) A judge should be adept at making  comparisons among the different parts of a work and among different works.   4) ""Disinterestedness"" - A judge should free his or her mind from all the prejudices that he or she can, and should consider the art for itself, separate from any practical utility.   5) ""Good sense"" - A judge should be able to synthesize all of the various qualities of a work into a meaningful analysis.   Only a judge with these five qualities actually has the ability to rightly judge whether a work is good or bad. If anyone disagrees with this judgment, they are wrong. However, someone who has the wrong opinion can still be correct as far as their sentiments are concerned (since sentiments, by their very nature, cannot be wrong)."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,scan919,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:38:02 2015 UTC,Yes I was trying to say that I think some of it is terrible & some of it is great. But I kinda doubt many people would say there are no horrible pop songs.
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,Uneje,3,Fri Jul 17 17:01:47 2015 UTC,"This is not the best place to go to find people willing to argue that popular music isn't music or that it doesn't have artistic merit.  I see nothing controversial in the claims you are making.   I will go a little further to mention that some pop is more lasting than others.  Songs like West End Girls, The Girl from Ipanema, Take On Me, Strangers in the Night, Mad World, etc. are pop and timeless.  Some pop songs manage to be THE perfect song for a month or two, and then are completely and utterly forgotten.  I would argue that both types of songs are quite worthy of artistic merit. It is no easy feat to craft a pop song that will be remembered 30 years later, and that should be obvious to most.  However, every year hundreds (thousands?) of songs are released with the hope that they find that magic that makes them the song of the summer.  All but a few of those fail to make an impression on anyone.  Even creating an ephemeral hit is quite a challenge.  Lastly, what about the pop that fails to win the public's heart?  Is that artless garbage?  Not in my opinion.  As an example, I am a huge fan Saint Etienne & Swing out Sister.  Both groups released a lot of music but spent precious little time on the charts. The songwriting and craftsmanship on their non-hits is great to my ears.    So live an let live.  Some people like pop and not metal.  Some like metal and not pop.  Some people like country and not funk. Differences in taste do not dictate the boundaries of what is/isn't art."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,nmitchell076,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:01:47 2015 UTC,"Once again, the thing I don't understand is saying ""It will not be remembered."" In 10 years, 20 years, even 50 years from now, you could easily listen to the song that's #1 on the Billboard charts right now. Obviously listening to it helps you remember it, even if you are listening to it years in the future. So therefore, saying that music will ""not be remembered"" is entirely wrong."
LetsTalkMusic,3dk16q,nmitchell076,4,Fri Jul 17 11:36:43 2015 UTC,"Again, you entirely misunderstand what people mean by this. They are saying not that we somehow won't have access to it in 50 years, but that no one will want to listen to it in 50 years."

If your ""no one will want to listen to it"" argument is valid, are you saying that if a song only gets one view on YouTube or one stream on Spotify for a whole year, that means that only one person wanted to remember it?

One could say that this music is not bad, it just doesn't have proper exposure to audiences (for marketing reasons that have nothing to do with the way the piece of music sounds). That isn't the case with the pop music you're discussing. This point says that this music was popular once, but no one wants to listen to it now. The reason why is because it's not very good music."

Let's go back to 1985 and pick 2 songs off the year end Billboard Hot 100.  Night Ranger's Sentimental Street & Starship's We Built This City.  The latter is clearly remembered by people who lived through the 80s.  It is most likely a staple of 80s radio playlists.  The former is a song that an 80s radio station probably would not play unless it was requested.  Certainly the members of Night Ranger and their biggest fans remember Sentimental Street, but for the rest of us, it is a forgotten song.  Again, from the same charts, we have Madonna's Like a Virgin and Madonna's Dress You Up.  The latter is a forgotten song, the former is not.  I am a Madonna fan, and until looking at the 1985 Billboard charts, I had completely forgotten about Dress You Up. Sure it was in my memory somewhere (else I wouldn't recognize it when I heard it) but I could recall it.  There is a difference between recall memory and recognition memory.  Most of us have really good recognition memory but most of us have problems recalling many of the things that we can recognize."

Another reason I don't respect a lot of pop music is the fact that their voice has been edited and fine tuned, I don't have a problem with them using this, it just doesn't ring well with my ear."

For instance, I probably won't listen to the Amboy Dukes or Damn Yankees because Ted Nugent's ideas are detestable, I think it would take this type of extreme to turn me off of an artist. The egotist Kanye-isms are nowhere near what is necessary to not listen to an artist for me.  I think the idea of wide idolatry for artists are saved for ones who only have their image as an asset. If we are critical of Swift or Knowles or One Direction, I think you'll find the music is secondary to the image because the music is a flimsy placeholder for a sellable icon. The type of artist we are going to talk about in twenty or fifty years is going to have merit in their music, the people who are selling an image will go the way of Tiffany or the Bay City Rollers or New Edition."

I also agree it's totally an image thing but I don't think it's only the top mainstream artists who use their image to sell records but there are also groups like Odd Future and Ghost whose image makes less mainstream audiences fall in love with them. I'm sure that's up for debate though.  But for the One Direction especially, their music is secondary to their image. In my experience, the girls who are one direction fans really talk about their looks more than their music."

I'm admittedly not totally familiar with all of either's catalogue, but I'm under the impression that Burzum is largely instrumental (and therefore Varg's nuttery doesn't bleed over into the music) while Nugent has plenty of crass bullshit in his music; even a decent track like Stranglehold has some really misogynistic lyrics."

For example in the case of Kanye he knows that he has to make damn near perfection with his albums or he's going to get ridicule and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was his way of getting fans to love him again after the MTV incident. There hasn't been like that from Ted Nugent personally that has been able to fight my preconceived notations that could make me switch from yes I like Stranglehold to yes I'll back and pledge my time to this dude.   In a sense Kanye knows that he's being possibly controversial to his potential fans, Ted Nugent doesn't, which is where the issue lies because it's much easier to identify with someone who is self aware of their actions than someone who isn't."

LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,OhJohnNo,2,Thu Jul 16 22:18:45 2015 UTC,"The type of artist we are going to talk about in twenty or fifty years is going to have merit in their music, the people who are selling an image will go the way of Tiffany or the Bay City Rollers or New Edition.   Or, alternatively, they are going to go the way of Elvis Presley - basically the Beyoncé of his day, except genderswapped: his primary talent was his singing voice, with all his songs being written for him and his image being a huge part of his success. He is still remembered as a byword for rock and roll, and it's been almost 60 years.  If an image particularly resonates, it will last a long time. Myths outlast men, after all, and we'll just have to wait and see how history treats Beyoncé. I view Taylor Swift as more along the lines of Elton John: a very inoffensive, but ultimately pretty talented singer-songwriter/popstar who has found tremendous success and will probably remain popular for several decades."
LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,fr0gz0r,3,Thu Jul 16 22:44:35 2015 UTC,Whoa - did you just call out Beyonce?  And compare her to Tiffany and the Bay City Rollers?  Whaaaaat?
LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,wildistherewind,21,Thu Jul 16 14:44:16 2015 UTC,"Beyoncé has the best PR team out there because they've been able to convince the listening public that her music is a lot more than it is. I think her music is cloying, it always has been from Destiny's Child, and her voice gets weaker and thinner with every album (though not at the degree of Jay-Z, who'll sound like wind moving through an obstructed pipe by the end of the decade).  All the fair-weather feminism & vegan challenge stuff doesn't change the fact that she makes completely forgettable music and has a subpar voice."
LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,fr0gz0r,2,Thu Jul 16 14:55:40 2015 UTC,"I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.  I could understand not thinking she's great, but she's certainly not a weak singer and she's hardly comparable to the one hit wonders you listed.    If not Beyonce, who do you think is a worthy modern pop R&B singer?"
LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,wildistherewind,4,Thu Jul 16 15:10:18 2015 UTC,"I don't rate many modern pop R&B singers, I think there is a genre-wide problem with looks being more important than ability. When I think of a good singer, I think of folks who have an almost supernatural control of their voice: people like Whitney Houston or Joni Mitchell or Björk or Amalia Rodrigues who sound emotive and effortless.  One R&B album I listen to a lot is Brownstone's From The Bottom Up, which came out at a time when major labels were releasing anything that might be the next En Vogue, SWV, Jade, whatever. Brownstone's singers have a very gospel tonality to their voice, clear and rich. The second half of this song is the vocal equivalent of opening up a sports car on the Autobahn.  Brownstone ""Don't Cry For Me"": http://youtube.com/watch?v=7ch5wYZCxsY"
LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,fr0gz0r,7,Thu Jul 16 15:35:35 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  You listed some fine singers, but the only one that's really similar stylistically is Whitney Houston.  Hell, half the singers you listed are dead already!  Why comment on a genre you are disinterested in?  From a technical perspective, Beyonce is an excellent singer with a big vocal range and a lot of power.  It's not really debatable.  You don't have to like her music, but her chops are unimpeachable.  If you're going to pick on pop music for being centered on looks rather than talent, she's surely one of the worst pop stars to target because she's a skillful singer (regardless of whether you like her music)."
LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,AnxiousReginald,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:56:32 2015 UTC,"If we are critical of Swift or Knowles or One Direction, I think you'll find the music is secondary to the image because the music is a flimsy placeholder for a sellable icon.   Even if we were to reduce popular music to mere commodity (setting aside the fact that less popular music (""indie,"" etc.) is likewise a commodity, and hence the distinction between the two is not at all unambiguous), it still wouldn't follow that the music is somehow secondary, given that such artists spend ludicrous amounts of money on songwriters and producers. If the artist is no more than a commodity, and the music really doesn't matter, we must conclude that Beyonce, Taylor Swift, etc., and their people are exceptionally bad business people who grossly overspend on unnecessary things (i.e., their music), yet are somehow still extremely successful. This seems tremendously unlikely."
LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,strangenchanted,13,Thu Jul 16 20:53:06 2015 UTC,"This seems to be more about celebrity and sociology than music. As for wanting musicians to be model citizens... there have been a few threads about that, and I believe most commenters here don't really want it.  Role models? Youth will always look up to someone and model themselves after them. Sometimes it's a great thinker or an inspiring historical figure. But let's face it, usually it's a celebrity, and quite often a musician. Why a musician? Coz they're sexy (on multiple levels), cool, and create relatable works of art. Their music speaks to their fans, and may be viewed as expressing what's in their hearts.  The adulation of a musician is, in some ways, similar to infatuation... which as we know, often leads the object of affection to be viewed in idealistic fashion, rather than as a real person. If the idol then changes in a way that doesn't fit one's ""correct"" image of the idol, that can lead to disillusionment."

LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,MLein97,3,Thu Jul 16 15:07:12 2015 UTC,what I found funny from the Glastonbury performance is that the stupid petition calling for his exit only added fuel to his fire. All those haters signing that petition only made that performance more and more anticipated and gather more and more people interested in the show.

You have to be enough of an asshole to believe that what you make is amazing and that everyone should hear it. My younger self tried to hold musicians to a higher ideal but my older self just ""intrigued by the drum"", as the Wu would say.  As an aside related to holding musicians to a higher ideal, fuck all that ""sellout"" talk. Most of us work 40hrs a week for a job we hate yet you're going to act all high and mighty when someone wants to get paid to make music??"
LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,BrianNowhere,7,Thu Jul 16 13:37:10 2015 UTC,"I hate that ""sellout"" shit. I think in many cases when it comes to music you need to be competitive and you can't make friends with everybody in most cases. I recall an interview with Snoop Dogg where he was talking about how he had to let go of friends in the beginning of his career because they were preventing him from getting to the top."
LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,SalishSailor,5,Thu Jul 16 13:41:30 2015 UTC,"Personaly selling out makes perfect sense once you look at it from a fan perspective. The band goes from playing a great show in a 500 person room where you can actually see the band to one that is on a stage too big for their act where the band turns something that was once beautiful and spontaneous into something that is rehearsed and controlled and at a higher ticket price. Or a local act that you used to be able to see once a month you now get to see once every 3 years in the next town over.   Personally I think a way to alleviate this issue is for the band to do what Led Zeppelin did where they would do reprisal tours in the UK of the sort of venues (like colleges) they played early on as a thank you to their fans when they were warming up for stadium tours and did more spontaneous free form sets.   Edit: Then on the album front maybe trying something similar to hip hops mixtape were its a rawer looser release, like the home/ cheap studio demo, self produced, early take, rough mix version of the album. Possibly new material or just the first 10 songs chronologically that came out of the pop album's writing period."
LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,SalishSailor,5,Thu Jul 16 18:38:35 2015 UTC,"I didn't hate Metallica for the Napster thing per se, my problem was that the image of rich, spoiled white ex-tennis player bitching about lost royalties completely shattered the image of a hard rocking metal band who wore jean-jacket vests over leather jackets and played for the adrenaline. They were supposed to be above it and when they proved they were just another corporation, their music completely lost it's appeal. I knew it was fake. Just a ruse to fool all of us young 'burn outs' to buy their record.   Fans of music like theirs are devoted like no other kind of fan is. They buy the t-shirts and other merch & partly make the band part of their own image. They deserved to lose those fans by being whiny little rich bitches.   People who don't understand why ""selling out"" is a bad thing probably don't remember a time when selling your music to a car commercial would have meant abandonment by the fan base.  Music was more special before selling out became the norm and the fans knew commercialization was a threat. 20 years later the battle is lost, commercialization won and music is the lesser for it. People today just don't seem to realize what we once had and lost."
LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,wobbabab,2,Thu Jul 16 15:25:29 2015 UTC,"I like Metallica, but didn't really care one way or the other about their stance on Napster. I'd say, at the very least, they stuck to their guns where other artists didn't say anything at all.  The part that I think is ironic is their rise to fame was due, in part, to tape trading in heavy metal circles. When your an artist that has benefitted from sharing music, it's hard to take you seriously when you are suddenly against it because now you're rich."
LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,Rooster_Ties,3,Thu Jul 16 16:52:28 2015 UTC,"I've been a huge Metallica fan all my life and I see what you're saying but I think maybe we have to put things into perspective.  In the 90s, Metal was completely struggling and it was showing in the kind of poor output the big four were putting out imo.  Metallica was the biggest Metal band at the time and I think the napster thing was expected to make them lose fans but we have to put this in the eyes of the artist.  This was something completely new for one of the biggest bands in the world. Leaks weren't a thing at all and Napster leaked one of their songs. They didn't like the possibility of the direction music piracy could possibly go to and now, metal bands are paying for that.  Metal bands are struggling artists because everyone pirates music now. I'm sure this is what Metallica was worried about in the long run and it's happening right now."

LetsTalkMusic,3di1x7,wildistherewind,4,Thu Jul 16 20:09:59 2015 UTC,"I've observed this seems to be particularly true in American culture.   Except maybe the designated ""bad guy"" celebrities, there seem to be only two states a public figure can occupy - angelic superhuman, or disgraced failure.    In reality, people are not Pure Good or Pure Bad, but occupy a position on some spectrum.  They may accomplish something amazing, like perform phenomenally in the olympics, create amazing new music, or invent a world-changing widget, but still have character flaws that don't take away from what they did accomplish.  Maybe it's the scandal-driven media that fuels this, but people seem generally willing to totally discard any accomplishments the moment a character flaw appears.  For some behaviours, a public shaming is definitely called for, but a lot of times the scandal is something relatively minor that shatters the image of the celebrity as some pure angelic being of light."

With Lennon, his scandals weren't enough to completely break the good image he had built up, so they were largely swept under the rug and forgotten about. In my experience most people not born in that era don't know about that side of Lennon's history."

As little as 10 or 15 years ago, I'm sure I would have been absolutely dumbstruck if I'd ever had the chance to talk to anyone like David Gilmour, Robert Smith, David Bowie, or Pete Townshend.  But as I delve deeper into their catalogs (often liking their more recent material a lot more, rather than what got them famous from the first halves of their careers) -- I feel ('feel' being the operative word) like I've gotten to know a side of them that's closer to who and how they really are today (or have been over the more recent decades).  Now whether I could actually hold a decent conversation with anyone, if given the actual chance, is anybody's guess (a coin flip, at best).  If anything, though, I think I'm starting to have an appreciation for how flippin' hard it much be to be famous, and to have everyone wanting a piece of them all the time in public.  As a result, I'd like to think that I could approach them on a more real level -- though don't necessarily think I could/would -- but I'd like to think I could.  It must be impossible to exist in this world if you had a hundred fucking fans all starry-eyed at every turn -- or even at best, a world of people around you just staring all the damn time.  I've talked to probably 100 semi-known jazz musicians over the years, and that's different of course - because it's a much smaller world they exist and work in.  But in the rock and pop world, it must be bloody awful to be famous.  I'm half serious."

LetsTalkMusic,3djp39,nowlan101,3,Thu Jul 16 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"disconnect between Paul McCartney the man, and Paul McCartney the musician.   Let's use Tom Waits as an example since a fair number of people here like him (though there are some that think he is a talentless hack who ripps of Don van Vliet for a living...), he has a good legacy, his music has changed, and he has changed.  Waits is very much interested in theater/film and therefore works hard to create a persona to go with his music. He does this differently than Bowie, or Gaga, but I think he is coming from a similar place.  Waits has spent a lot of time creating characters that are drunks and 3 times losers.  While he may have been a drunk (I certainly don't know how much I have heard about his life and how much is theater), the 3 time loser character he has been known to portray is not a reflection of his personal life.  I would expect that his social life changed drastically as a result of getting married (just because marriage sometimes has that effect).  Sonically, marriage did coincide with a change in his music, but I am not so sure that that the pre-Brennan/post-Brennan lyrics reflected his pre-Brennan/post-Brennan personal life.  For Tom a disconnect between the man and the character is needed in order that he can bring acting into his music.   Is the connection to an artist based on the amount we can personally relate with them?   For me, the answer is no.  Among my favorite artists are Prince, Towa Tei, Tom Waits, Ástor Piazzolla, and David Bowie.  I must admit that I cannot in any way personally relate to the lives they have led."
LetsTalkMusic,3djp39,Miguelito-Loveless,2,Thu Jul 16 21:54:54 2015 UTC,"I think an interesting example of this would be artists who are either totally or partially anonymous.  The only acts coming to mind are Spark Master Tape and Lil Ugly Mane (who's name and past bands is known, but not much else), who both use anonymity to create characters that are kind of, extremely violent drug pushers.  Sort of like an amped up version of regular trap lyrical topics, but without the pretense that it's a hyperbolic description of the artists own life.   I agree with /u/AnxiousReginald though, there aren't any artists (or celebrities in general) who aren't either playing a character or have their real personality distorted by the medium.   It's hard enough to really know people in real life, you know?"
LetsTalkMusic,3djp39,crustinXbeiber,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:30:17 2015 UTC,"I think that even when we think we know who an artist is personally we don't actually possess any such knowledge. What we know is mostly a creation or image of the artist, not the artist herself. Lots of folks feel as though they have some intimate connection with Kurt Cobain, but their notion of who Cobain was has been ""created"" from scraps they've found in his lyrics and the little bit that's documented about his personal life. It is mostly an illusion, though not necessarily a bad one. Obviously, someone who was close to Cobain personally is going to have a much different idea of who he was than a fan would.   There is this common idea that music is ""self expression,"" and while that perhaps describes the creative process of some (though even there I have extreme doubts), I really don't think the listener can ever actually know anything about the ""self"" doing the ""expressing."" Even when the music is autobiographical to some extent, the image of the self that's created is just that -- a creation, a fiction, etc. -- with certain elements foregrounded, others relegated to the background, and lots and lots left out entirely.   I agree that there is something ""pure"" about music when much is unknown or ignored about the circumstances of its creation. I think in such cases you are forced to make sense on the music on its own terms, without reference to any external factors. It is sorta natural to ask of some music what sort of person the artist is, but generally such questions have very little to do with the music itself."

LetsTalkMusic,3di7r3,crustinXbeiber,2,Thu Jul 16 15:24:37 2015 UTC,Yeah if it was $400ish it would definitely be worth it IMO. It's definitely a huge step in the right direction though.

I really don't think there is a market anymore for people who want exclusive, streaming-free music players hence I don't think there's any hope for people who want something like an X5 for cheaper.  The absurdity of my existence is that I got a 16gb Sony Walkman for when I'm out and about because of my paranoia of causing my X5 any harm. Losing my iPod classic was a significant loss and I don't want to feel what I felt that day ever again, so I have to use it in very controlled situations.  There are advantages though to having players with less space. I'm a guy who has a lot of trouble dismissing albums I don't care for that much on the off chance that I'll come around to it, so having that smaller player forces me to face some hard truths that my former iPod or current X5 never would."

It makes me feel a little uncomfortable but I can't quite put my finger on why. It's not intruding because they aren't friends with him and he won't see any of their messages. I have no problem when a musician dies and people talk about them, but their child? I feel a little bit like people are using it as an opportunity to own this person in a way, to suggest that his music means so much to them, and they somehow have an insight into what he's going through. Maybe I'm way off.  It's probably meant in the most supportive way, but it just doesn't sit quite right with me."

You do get it right, though, when a few people get out of hand with comments such as ""Oh, this means his next album's gonna be even better, sadder than The Boatman's Call"" or ""He should probably make a cover of Clapton's tune now""...

The movie was great, I highly recommend it for people interested in the motivation for art and the importance of experience and memory.  Watching the movie has seemed to set off a chain reaction though. The next movie I watched was Wim Wenders' Wings Of Desire, also great, but has an appearance from Nick Cave whose music plays a central role in two scenes. Okay, strange coincidence. Just now I had my MP3 player on shuffle and one of the three Nick Cave songs I have on there came up; I did the math and there is a 146:1 chance for that to happen in any given week.

LetsTalkMusic,3ddrjn,logblobo,11,Wed Jul 15 14:02:35 2015 UTC,"Summer Fiction - Himalaya  Catchy songs are simultaneously euphoric and irritating. What ruins a catchy song over time? Is it the oversaturation it receives? Is it our disillusionment with it? Or could it be our attempts to recreate it? -- Humming it, reciting the lyrics, no matter how uncomfortable (I’m looking at you, Ariel Pink.) Bill Ricchini of Summer Fiction apparently understands the weariness of easy-listening; yet, he was apparently never encumbered by it. The Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks tunes he previously hummed have been beautifully translated through his own re-imagining on Summer Fiction’s albums.  Similar to his eponymous album, Himalaya wastes no time ambling into your ears. On and On may be a vague callback to Mikal Cronan’s Shout it Out and Justice’s On’n’on, but it’s a blatant tribute to orgasmic softcore 60’s rock at its most abrasive. Although Dirty Blonde and Genevieve feature textbook progression, compliments of Brian Wilson and Harry Nilsson, Ricchini contrasts their more romantic efforts with a continually worn and realistic view of the world. Furthermore, instrumental tracks on the album’s second half are more eclectic than reverent. Cathedral either foreshadows mystic developments to come from Ricchini or thematically concludes a surprisingly dark album (seriously, Dirty Blonde is basically about a homicidal woman).   The restraint Ricchini institutes allows his beautiful melodies to flow unabated, preventing Himalaya from feeling like a husk-like amalgamation of catchy songs. Instead, it’s not only one of my favorite albums of the year, but it has the potential to be a staple of my melodic pop inventory for years, without oversaturation or shameful lyric recitals (people think I want raped, castrated, and made gay thanks to Ariel Pink.)  ofMontreal - Skeletal Lamping  After finding this album for a reasonable price, I finally revisited Skeletal Lamping, and it's basically convinced me that any price would be reasonable for it.  Wicked Wisdom seemingly explores the societal notion that celebrity or eccentricity equates to knowledge. Kevin Barnes’ stacked harmonies are more whimsical than ever. It’s a testament to his performance that the dynamic howl of Barnes’ vocals distinguish themselves among the unclassifiable instrumentation’s permutating landscape.   It’s fitting that Skeletal Lamping candidly portrays Barnes’ supposed experience rather than his innate person. The sonic bed-spread is more of a mall-massage-chair, which incites its own experience for the listener -- bumping and insatiably metamorphic, ofMontreal’s tracks are an impressively effective moving sidewalk for Barnes’ lyrics. Only The Gay Parade rivals Skeletal Lamping’s union of lyricism and music. The aptly named Gallery Piece extends a wired telephone cup to the prior themes of entitlement, corrosive celebrity, and self-awareness with a flashing neon marquee sign of vanity and eroticism in a delightfully bombastic effort. Perhaps the best illustration of Barnes’ wit is Women’s Studies Victims.   “They had painted her face   like a man's mistake,  like a man's mistake,  gangbanging”   Reverberating through this lucidly animated bad trip is an ironic indictment of elitism, observational judgement, and political communication. Brief dialogue throughout the song - partially spoken by an uncharacteristically lethargic Barnes - is clever, while not sacrificing (possibly) forced perspective on the story’s narrator as a “no clue” unassuming individual.   Stories like this are contained throughout the album, and some transcend the Gay Parade’s wit and unity. While Hissing Fauna... may be my favorite ofMontreal album, its cohesion and ever-adapting sound make Skeletal Lamping an undeniably great album. Also, “you’ve got so much in common with my big cock creator” is one of my favorite lyrics.  Django Django - Django Django  2012 was a weird year. I was convinced Joe Biden should recruit Ralph Nader onto a ticket and siege the White House after his debate with Paul Ryan. I was shunned for saying Jeremy Lin wasn’t going to be the next Tony Parker. Those unpopular opinions made me look like Karen in Veep compared to the general reception when I nearly sold a family heirloom to buy Django Django.   Born Under Saturn was pretty disappointing. Frankly, I couldn’t remember why I bought it. It must’ve been a dash of intrigue and a dump truck full of nostalgia. After ambivalently listening to Born Under Saturn, I needed to remind myself why I risked the scorn of my mother for a CD, so I started playing Django Django again and stopped playing much of anything else. Retrospectively, I can appreciate the album more objectively.   Django Django sounds like somebody stopped in Cairo en route to a Tibetan monk’s house party and squandered their inheritance on outrageous nightly hotel fees and 2-3 Kardashian closets worth of street-market scarves. Yep, just like that. This eponymous album frames Django Django as a half-assed 60’s political warrior-dove. In an attempt to disembark from society and its culture, they became enamored with it.   Unlike the hellaciously boring Genesis in the Bible, the genesis of Django Django provides listeners with two of the most contagiously ambitious psych-pop songs I’ve ever heard with Hail Bop and Default. The same fusion in society that enchanted Django Django enchants listeners with a steadily paced 9 minutes that imbues the ears with bouncy synth-strokes and warm sitar strums.   Waveform is the band’s thesis statement, however. Lyrically and aesthetically, it describes the impossibilities of recreating nature from a phenomenological perspective, which contrasts beautifully with the Hindu Sonic the Hedgehog ambience that drives the song, and thusly the album. Every stanza contrasts the ponderings of humanity with the resolution of nature. The breadth of Waveform is quickly replaced by the specificity of WOR. Its oft-treaded theme is cursorily apparent, but it sounds more like the soundtrack to a Quentin Tarantino rendition of Escape from Alcatraz.   As a whole, Django Django contains the endless activity of Goat (band) while flaunting the refinement of Wonderwall Music. It utilizes modulated sounds to convey a natural message while simultaneously utilizing organic sitars and assorted sounds to present the perspective of humanity. Frankly, it’s worth selling dozens of family heirlooms.  Mojave 3 - Excuses for Travellers  The reason I play Excuses for Travellers is to not listen to it. With two exceptions, I’ve only listened to this album while attempting to sleep -- and it works better than Ambein and Melatonin, for better or worse. While Excuses for Travellers is irrefutably pretty and quaint, it’s mostly uninteresting. Hearing the ride cymbal in Trying To Reach You almost jolts me awake. “What variety!” I say to the Ambien walrus. “What unprecedented variety!”  Excuses for Travellers makes Hereafter look like the adventure film its trailer portrayed it as. When Neil Halstead finally attempts to awaken his appropriately melancholy listeners, he does it with possibly the least nuanced song on the album, Anyday Will Be Fine. I’m horrid at math, but that’s why I didn’t pursue engineering. Neil, it’s okay to be mediocre at something. Just don’t try to prove people otherwise when it’s true.  For all intents and purposes, Excuses for Travellers succeeds. It succeeds by doing exactly what they wanted to. They just really wanted me to get a good night’s sleep."
LetsTalkMusic,3ddrjn,feedthecollapse,3,Wed Jul 15 14:31:58 2015 UTC,"Mojave 3's debut is the only album by them one really needs.

It makes this fan happy to hear that it's found a place in your heart as well!  It's also worth noting that Barnes stated the album was a continuation of the Georgie Fruit alter-ego he adapted in the last half of Hissing Fauna. Listening to the songs from the perspective of Barnes viewing his other self, his unexplored side, brought a new light to the lyrics and made the album a much more powerful listening experience for me."

They didn't really change their sound much, but who says that's always a bad thing? I enjoyed the first album, but it was never one of my all-time favourites. Guess I was just ready to like them more once the second album came around."
LetsTalkMusic,3ddrjn,ReallyNotBilly,7,Thu Jul 16 01:44:53 2015 UTC,"Only got a few albums in this past week  Mac Demarco - Another One: Not really impressed with Mac's new album. I found most songs to be a little too repetitive (although most of his can be) and some stuff just seemed like it could have used a little more time. The title track, The Way You'd Love Her and Without Me were the best tracks imo. This album was super hyped up and I just feel it doesn't live up to 2 and Salad Days, which were both great. I'll definitely come back to it at some point.  Mac Demarco - Another One  Tame Impala - Currents: This record is quite the departure from Lonnerism. KP kind of lost the super psychedelic sound the previous two records had and added more of a pop/disco feel. There are definitely still elements of Tame's earlier work, but I feel there's more new than old. Way more synth, distinct lack of guitar, and what sounds to be synthetic or triggered drums, giving more of an electronic vibe. The vocals get put at the forefront with the majority of the album being sung in falsetto, which I actually really enjoy. Kevin is definitely a master at writing melodies and this just further proves it. Top tracks for me are The Moment, Eventually, Less I Know. The last track sort of disappointed me and left me a litte underwhelmed because it doesn't really go anywhere at the end. It just fades, which is not the right way to end an album like this. All in all, not my favorite Tame album, but the inner pop fan in me likes this album enough to say that it's some of my favorite work Kevin Parker has put together.  Tame Impala - Let it Happen  American Football - American Football: Finally got around to giving this a listen. I was shown AF because of my interest in bands like Oshwa, Chon and Giraffes? Giraffes! I really dig the math element in their sound. I'm a huge prog fan so I love rhythmically complex music. It's definitely some of the most interesting music I've heard. It's so lush and soft, but still drives at the same time. I love the guitar playing, especially the ending of Stay Home that has a repeating pattern in 7/8, it almost sounds like something Steve Reich would have composed. I really enjoy the vibe of this record and it's definitely a favorite now.  American Football - Never Meant   Bill Bruford - Feels Good to Me: Bruford has always been one of my favorite drummers, and has played on some of my favorite recordings (Red, Close to the Edge, Starless and Bible Black, Apart and yet A Part) but I've never ventured into his solo catalogue. If you like King Crimson, UK or any late 70's jazz/fusion, you should really check out this album. There's incredible playing and demonstrations of technical ability in tracks like Beelzebub and If You Can't Stand the Heat... but at the same time, Bill shows his softer side and his ability to write beautiful melodies and chord progressions (see Seems like a Lifetime). Also, having Alan Holdsworth on the record doesn't hurt.  Bruford - Beelzebub  I just got a lot more music to listen to (Weezer, Antlers, Animal Collective, RtJ2, Hella, Godspeed You, Omar Rodriguez Lopez) so I'll be busy for the next while as well."
LetsTalkMusic,3ddrjn,NYCRose,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:31:40 2015 UTC,"American Football is definitely an amazing album, and especially when you hear it around sunset on a summer night. I absolutely agree with you on the soft vibes."

He started playing drums for a band with his brother and a couple friends called Cap'n Jazzwhen he was 8 years old, I believe.  After that he went on to be in: Their/Theyre/There on drums. Joan of Arc on drums. And his solo project Owen as well as having played on various solo records. The guy is very talented."

There are so many different ways you can experience this album and just about all of them are great ways to experience it. Listening to it in the summer as you watch the sun rise, listening to it on a flight somewhere and one of my personal favorites; listening to it on a cold night with only the warmth of your SO. (I like my cliches like I like my coffee. Situational.)  Did you ever give their EP a listen? It's only a small handful of songs but they're still awesome. The One With the Tambourine is a presonal favorite and might be my favorite American Football song."
LetsTalkMusic,3ddrjn,HejAnton,7,Thu Jul 16 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"3x3 for this past week.  Stars Of The Lid - And The Refinement Of Their Decline  While I do believe that the 2-hour playtime is a bit too long, I still love this album and The Tired Sounds an equal amount. It's blissful and packed with a certain calm that I can't seem to get enough of.   I do find that it gets a bit homogenous after a while, and the sweet pads that seem to be in every single song gets a bit tiring but outside of that, I can't complain. Some of the best ambient I've ever heard. Very excited for the reissue coming this August, hoping to pick up both this one and The Tired Sounds.  The Feelies - Crazy Rhytm  Been meaning to hear it for a while now but first gave it a shot this week. Why didn't anyone tell me how great this is?  Post-punk meets jangle pop in a spectacular fashion. Fun, charming songs that also pick a punch. Been revisiting this one a lot throughout the week and it's quickly shaping up to become a favorite of mine. Highly recommend this one.  Destroyer - Poison Season  Enjoyed this one a lot aswell. I think I prefer both Destroyer's Rubies and Kaputt to this one even though I'll probably consider this one an equal if I spend some more time with it. Atmosphere is as ridiculously attractive as on previous records and I love the heavy focus on saxophone which fits Bejar's vocals as well as before. I don't think it reinvents anything that Destroyer has released before but I like their previous stuff and I enjoy this one for the same reasons. I would link to Bangkok which is my favorite track but I can't find a link.   The rest...  Depression Cherry - It's the same as before. If you're into their previous stuff you'll enjoy this one aswell. Some great tracks on here however.  Enter The Wu-Tang - You all know it. Can It Be All So Simple is the best track and ODB was the best part of the clan.  In The Flat Field - Didn't care for this one. Maybe I didn't pay enough attention?  Brother, Sister - A lot better than I expected it to be!  Magnifique - I've come to realize that Ratatat is a band that I just don't care for anymore.  Currents - I really thought this was going to suck after seeing the general consensus of it but I actually liked the direction they're taking their music even if I think Lonerism was better."
LetsTalkMusic,3ddrjn,Mikep98,2,Wed Jul 15 16:59:43 2015 UTC,Can you tell me more about why you don't like Ratatat any more? Is it just because of the new album? I really enjoyed it and love their older stuff too.
LetsTalkMusic,3ddrjn,HejAnton,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"I've only heard a couple of songs which I found decent. Found Magnifique to be forgetable through and through.

LetsTalkMusic,3ddrjn,wildistherewind,10,Wed Jul 15 23:42:58 2015 UTC,"5X5  Last fm profile, add me if you wish.   Been checking out a lot of music that’s been recently added to my library. I’ve revisited some of my favorites as well though. Any questions, comments or recs are encouraged!   Mac Miller - Faces: Definitely one of my favorite hip-hop tapes of the past year, been listening to it off and on since it came out. The production gives off such an eerie, psychedelic vibe and Mac’s storytelling has definitely improved since his early career. It’s very lengthy and I get bored of the middle stretch, but I enjoy about 70% of it. Overall, it’s a solid mixtape and by far my favorite release from Mac.   Mac Miller - Rain (feat Vince Staples)  Earl Sweatshirt - I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside: is another one of my recent favorites in hip-hop. Earl is really great at capturing that dark, moody atmosphere. Really think this album has been kind of overlooked with all of the great releases in the past few months. I find myself coming back to this more and more over time. Plus, if I’m in a shitty mood, I can throw this album on and feel better about everything going on in my life.   Common - Be: Finally gave this a listen thanks to the HHH Essential Albums Discussion from this past week. Been missing out on this… only song I’d heard before was “The Food” which is just classic. I think this is some of Kanye’s best production, and I love the way Common works over his beats. That being said, I‘m still not a huge fan of Common, he just seems kind of boring to me for some reason. Enjoyed this album, but it really just left me wishing Kanye had stuck with his soul-influenced production. Going to be revisiting this later though.  Common - Be (Intro)  Common - The Food (feat Kanye West)  Sufjan Stevens - Illinois: After checking out Carrie and Lowell earlier this year, I finally decided to check this out. I’ve never been a huge folk guy but it really enjoyed this. Absolutely loved the first stretch from the opening track to Chicago. Great album and I can see why it gets talked about so often.   Sufjan Stevens - Chicago  Mac DeMarco - Another One: Honestly, this was a bit disappointing, especially considering how much I loved 2 and Salad Days. I was a little bored by this project, it was pretty mediocre. Gonna revisit this again later.   Mac DeMarco - The Way You’d Love Her  Also been going exploring some more jazz. Tried some of the classics, such as A Love Supreme, Maiden Voyage, Monk’s Dream and Mingus Ah Um. Favorite of the four has to be A Love Supreme, it’s fantastic.   John Coltrane - A Love Supreme, Pt 1: Acknowledgement  Herbie Hancock is slowly becoming one of my favorites, so I’ve been checking out his some of his material and anything with a similar funk vibe, such as Thrust, Man-Child and Future Shock. If you think you haven’t heard Hancock, I guarantee you’ve at least heard Rockit, which also has one of the strangest music videos I’ve seen.   Anyway, that’s all I’ve got time for."
LetsTalkMusic,3ddrjn,lilmeatwad,6,Wed Jul 15 14:16:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with your assessment of Be and of Common. The production on the album is great (it's worth mentioning the two non-Kanye productions are from J Dilla), but Common just doesn't sound all that exciting. His style is too monotonous for me, it doesn't feel especially authoritative.

Beautiful, beautiful stuff. I especially love the great guitar work by the maestro Steve Howe on all three of those albums. Fragile remains my favorite album by them, partly due to the sheer cohesiveness of the album brought due to Rick Wakeman's fantastic keyboard performance.  Along with this, I've been listening to The Cure also!  Disintegration is an amazing album!   Lovesong   Fascination Street  I particularly love the extended intro segments on almost every song on the above album - especially the great bass segment on Fascination Street."

LetsTalkMusic,3ddrjn,pike360,3,Wed Jul 15 19:38:57 2015 UTC,"Been on a kick of ""retro"" Doom Metal lately.  Fuzz - Fuzz  The only album released by the Ty Segall collaboration, but it's already my second favorite release by him. The album is Ty Segall's take on 70s Heavy Metal, it's a very unique one. Taking inspiration from Black Sabbath, the Stooges, Hawkwind, Grand Funk Railroad, Steppenwolf, and Jimi Hendrix, and mixing it with his trademark Garage Rock, Ty creates one of the most unique Stoner Rock experiences in recent memory. Some Standout tracks for me are Sleigh Ride, a fast, almost Protopunk-ish jam, HazeMaze, a lumbering and bluesy Doom track, Loose Sutures, a long, Hawkind style Jam, and Raise, a Southern Rock boogie. This is a kickass album that I would suggest all fans of Stoner Rock, 70s Hard Rock, and Ty Segall should listen to it.  Witch - Witch  This is a Jay Mascis side-project, and it's a far more conventional Doom Metal band. It features everything you could want from a good Doom Metal record though: crunchy riffs, wailing vocals, spooky lyrics, and thick bass. Favorite off this album is Rip Van Winkle because that riff is so catchy. It's not genre changing, but it's very solid Stoner Doom all around.  The Sword - High Country  New track by the band from their forthcoming album of the same name. From what it sounds like, they're abandoning their Stoner Metal sound, and instead going with a Southern Rock type sound, which I'm perfectly fine with. The track is catchy and short, and it gets me excited for the new release."

Everything about this record is unrivaled musical perfection to me. The way that Brian Wilson arranged everything, and layered sounds, and created new musical recording concepts is mind-blowing to me.   I also have gotten to the point where I will spend the entire day listening exclusively to the vocal, and instrumental backing tracks on the Pet Sounds 30th Anniversary Collection box set. The quality of the song writing and musicianship really stands out more with just the instrumentals, and the Beach Boys iconic vocal harmonies are at their best. Hearing Wilson's maddeningly complicated left hand piano work is some of the most fun I've had listening to music. And wondering how he combined bass lines, and just the utter complexity of how this was put together is overwhelming, but fascinating.   Spiritualized- Let it Come Down  I'm in the majority that Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space is their best album, I think that Let it Come Down is in their top 3. Just below Pure Phase. But Let it Come Down does a lot of different things that neither of those records to. Save for Broken Heart on Ladies and Gentlemen there aren't as many broad sweeping tracks with as much crammed into is as the majority of Let it Come Down does. They used over 100 musicians to create this, and a choir. Jason Pierce does this to perfection and paints a heartbreaking picture of the struggle of drug addiction.   I will say that while the music isn't as good as Ladies and Gentlemen the lyrics are absolutely fantastic- specifically Out of Sight and Don't Just Do Something. There is a lot of play on words type lyrics in this record that fit Pierce's heartache, addiction, and love. I had never listened to this record sober until last week. It's just as good. But there is something to be said for- Taking drugs to make music to take drugs."

Their sound is giant so I can see them totally being a studio type band whose sound doesn't translate to live performances. However, the War on Drugs has a very layered sound that I've heard people say wasn't done well live. However, I saw them at the Range Peel in Asheville, The Georgia Theatre in Athens, and at Amos's South End in Charlotte. Their sound was fine in Asheville and Athens, but terrible in Charlotte. They were totally victims of the venue, and Spiritualized might be victims of the way the sonic vibrations bounce in a venue. Who knows, but they are definitely a bucket list band."

I saw Spiritualized live at Primavera and I completely enjoyed the performance but they performed a lot of their gospel songs. My advice would be to listen to some of their more recent albums (really just listen to all their stuff) and you'll be able to appreciate the show some more.  As for watching live performances on Youtube, I've found that most of the time, it doesn't properly capture the energy and atmosphere of the show. One of the best examples I can think of this is Death Grips. I saw them when they toured with Nine Inch Nails and I wanted to see some more live performances and they were nothing like what I saw.

To me it's the most perfect album ever created. The love songs are beautifully crafted, well written. The music is so interesting, the usage of typical rock instrumentation mixed with more traditionally classical instrumentation with some off the wall stuff like a bike horn.   To be inside Brian's brain while he was recording this album, hell, even to be a fly on the wall in the studio would be amazing, if not scary."

If you're not familiar with Snarky Puppy, though, don't start with Sylva. Start here.   Snarky Puppy - Gretel  Ratatat's imminent record has been described as ""effortless"" and I think that's what excites me about this song, and my first couple listens through Magnifique as a whole. The grooves are easy, but the songs seem as inventive as ever and the production sparkles. This is just plain old feel-good tunes for me.  Ratatat - Cream On Chrome  Hiatus Kaiyote's Choose Your Weapon is, in my mind, an instant classic. Like a prime cut of R&B steak, perfectly marbled with jazz and grilled to perfection over a sexy, smoldering bed of neo-soul/hip-hop coals.

But other than that, I can't really say they brought much more to the table than that. I didn't really connect with any of the songs, and the 8-bit sound effects scattered here and there didn't do too much for me either. After hearing Tawk Tomahawk, I was very much impressed and hungry for more from the group. But in all honesty, this new album didn't cut it for me. Imo, though"
LetsTalkMusic,3ddrjn,feedthecollapse,2,Sat Jul 18 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"3x3  last.fm profile, add me  Home, Like No Place Is There  My all-time favorite album. Lyrically brilliant, and striking melodically. It's pretty basic (revival) emo, but done better than the likes of Whenever, If Ever. I'm super biased, since I strongly relate to feelings conveyed on the album, but to me it's one of the best albums of the 10's.  Dendron  Spiderland  Kliché, and classic post-rock. The spoken-word parts, coupled with the lyricism, creates and eerily dark atmosphere. The last couple of minutes are the best ending to an album I've heard (along with Home, Like No Place Is There), and gives me goosebumbs every time. Also, the storytelling is amazing.  Good Morning, Captain  Whirlpool  One of my favorite shoegaze albums that I recently became obsessed with again. The pinnacle of my personal favorite genre.  Pearl  Untrue  I always thought dub-step was shit tbh. This album is amazing! The vibe is weirdly sad, even though it's all sampled AFAIK. Very minimalistic, but clearly conveys a feeling of longing and sadness. Amazing slowcore.  Archangel  American Radass (Ths Is Important)  Stereotypical emo. I'm suppossed to hate them, but their sound is nice and easy to enjoy. I won't go into depth with it since I mostly just carelessly listen to it when I relax.  Aww, C'mon Guys  Era  Shoegaze/dream pop I recently discovered. Strongly recommend to anyone in love with shoegaze!

Not the most glamorous aspect of publishing, but you never know when your song is a hit in Hungary and being streamed on some tiny site a million times a day.

Unfortunately it is still a whirlwind of confusion when trying to nail down which agencies collect from where. I went through it recently for my own music and I naively figured ASCAP would handle everything.   I got accepted to Pandora and for some reason, I also need a Sound Exchange account to claim royalties from them. It would have been nice as a welcome package to know how to pick up my pennies. Instead it was discovered by accident discussing the issue with another musician.  I also recently spoke with someone in Jackson hole Wyoming who runs a local radio show.  She mentioned that she had been playing my music for the past year or so and people seemed to love it. I only found this out after sending her a thank you email for buying the album on Bandcamp.

LetsTalkMusic,3dab2x,wexfun,15,Tue Jul 14 18:53:29 2015 UTC,"It is hard to form a ""Super Group"" in a time when going platinum is almost unheard of.  If you were to ask even the hippest kids ""who are the members of Monsters of Folk"", you MIGHT get 2 names.  That wasnt so back in the days of Cream.  I know you are trying to keep this ""Indie Rock-centric"", but that is the rub....it isnt as possible to pull off in the Indie Rock era.  Middle Brother is a band with a member from Deer Tick, Dawes, and Delta Spirit.  It is a pretty good band and, I think, it is better than the average Dawes or Delta Spirit song...while it is as good as the average Deer Tick song.  With that said...how can I consider them a Super Group if I dont know anybody who owns a Delta Spirit album?  How many rock fans didnt know who Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, and Jack Bruce were when Cream formed?  TONS....but TONS did.  If you look at a band like Ugly Casanova, they are still ""indie rock""....they are an OUTSTANDING ""super group""....and I love everything they do.  That said, do you know John Orth from Holopaw and Tim Rutili from Califone?  They are great, but they cant be a super group in my eyes (again) because they are almost unknown besides Isaac Brock from Modest Mouse.  Lastly, I will point to Mad Season...a group comprised of men from the ""grunge"" era.  Their album was a critical success, was loved by fans, and had members of Alice in Chains (RIP Layne) and Pearl Jam near their respective groups' glory days.   I think this album sold well for the time, and it sounds as if they are currently working on new material (with Mark Lanegan from the Screaming Trees) as we speak.  Their first/only album was a ""must own"", but I hardly ever hear them brought up...even back when they were ""popular"".  To me, it isnt about how old they are or whether they are past their prime, I just see the dynamic of the super group as flawed...especially (as you say) it is after their popularity has hit and there are individual expectations going into the band.  If I am a big Modest Mouse fan and Ugly Casanova doesnt sound like Modest Mouse, would I be disappointed?  A fix to this seems to be the first Traveling Wilburys album.  You can turn that on and hear exactly what I mean.  A song like ""Handle With Care"" has all of the parties involved and singing different lines (a la ""Highwayman"" by The Highwaymen) which works for that song.  The rest of the album seems to make the concept of the band work though.  You will hear a song that sounds like a Tom Petty song (with excellent backing singers/musicians), but then the next song will sound like a Roy Orbison song...or a Bob Dylan song (with excellent backing singers/musicians).  In doing this, you are giving the Roy Orbison fans that followed him over to The Wilburys a reason to buy the album.  It isnt just Roy getting a line and singing backup....and that's the same for the rest of The Wilburys on that album.  I think THAT is the key to a Super Group.  You have to be able to taste the individual flavors that drew you to the dish to begin with...they cant be watered down."

LetsTalkMusic,3dab2x,zach84,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:38:37 2015 UTC,"Individually, they are deserving of a Mount Rushmore-ish place and are certainly certainly some of the founding fathers of what we know as music.    I actually just went through the whole Highwaymen album earlier this year for the first time.  It wasnt as good as I thought it would be, but how bad can it be with all of that talent?  Overall, it is a great ""Super Group"" album in my opinion, but it isnt ""better than the sum of its parts"" at all.  Luckily, those guys turn(ed) up in each other's songs from time to time, so it isnt too hard to find Cash doing a Kristofferson song or a collaboration between Waylon and Willie.  All of these guys sang and wrote so many songs that The Highwaymen is just an official coming-together that had been going on unofficially for years.    I am very glad that it happened and that it got put on tape for posterity, I just wish I could have picked their track list!"
LetsTalkMusic,3dab2x,BellyFullOfSwans,7,Fri Jul 17 09:10:06 2015 UTC,"I think for a large part, many supergroups are formed by musicians past their creative peaks, which leads to not as great music being produced. When the travelling wilburys started, all the musicians in it were at least a good decade to even further past their critical, and popular peaks, and it does somewhat show in their material. Maybe it is stupid to call a band like this a supergroup, but to me the intention of the title is to say this is a group of established musicians coming together to make something, but does not reference the material they are actually making. Maybe there is so much hype around the term supergroup because it is something that the media can play up, but also because two of the bands first given this term, Cream and CSNY, were very successful so the expectation is that others will be as well."

In fact, when I look across the board, that seems to be the common thread between every supergroup - they're all old.   But still with that I come back to it being about the money. Maybe even more so now. I can't stand when people past their prime continue to release terrible albums. I realize it's pretty idealistic to think that anyone would just up and quit making music because they're old, but rarely do they contribute much. I know there are exceptions to this, too."
LetsTalkMusic,3dab2x,BestGurl,6,Tue Jul 14 20:16:46 2015 UTC,"There's so many nonsense comments in here. Most supergroups have nothing to do with making money. Plenty of supergroups make far less money than the solo artists making them up make.   Comments about forming supergroups when modern artists don't sell Platinum makes no sense.  Supergroups are just groups featuring members of other bands. The ""super"" had nothing to do with sales.  There's plenty of modern ""supergroups"" that people can pick apart. These aren't a thing of tv past by any means: The New Pornographers, Broken Social Scene, Wild Flag, Broken Bells, Postal Service, Velvet Revolver, Them Crooked Vultures, The Dead Weather, Atoms for Peace, The Damned Things, Jack U, Dog Blood, FFS  Super never had anything to do with the members being very recognizable. The term itself though is pointless. By its definition almost every single classic era jazz album was made by a ""supergroup."""
LetsTalkMusic,3dab2x,YourphobiaMyfetish,3,Wed Jul 15 02:55:49 2015 UTC,"Recently, there has been a group of bands who are based around the Blue Swan record label, which is a label centered around progressive and technical post-hardcore. It was started by Will Swan, the guitarist of Dance Gavin Dance, and signed bands like Stolas, Hail the Sun, Adventurer, etc. Bands that previously very few people knew of, but have since gained popularity.  Well, the guitarist of Stolas started a side project that ended up gaining members from the other bands (DGD, A Lot Like Birds, Hail the Sun) and formed what many people consider a super group. But that doesn't make sense to me because Dance Gavin Dance are much more popular than any of the other 4 members' bands (283k facebook followers compared to 55k, 20k, and 15k).  There's also other projects such as Sufferer, with member froms A Lot Like Birds, I the Mighty, Hail the Sun, and some other band. The idea was the write songs about a guy suffering from several mental disorders, with these disorders personified by the vocalists.  Do these and the other groups mentioned in this post constitute as super groups or would they be considered more as side projects with members of different bands? I'm leaning toward the latter. These groups aren't really super to anyone aside from people who are big into the respective scenes of the groups (folk and post-hardcore respectively)."
LetsTalkMusic,3dab2x,TheyCallMeElGuapo,2,Tue Jul 14 22:15:25 2015 UTC,"I'm always interested in supergroups, but very few really stick with me. Cream is an obvious example of a great supergroup, and I really enjoyed Broken Bells's self-titled album, as well as Ugly Casanova's one release. I think both of the latter albums are great examples of frontmen getting away from their main band's sound, while on the other hand I think certain supergroups, like Chickenfoot and Audioslave are horrible. As much I loved Rage and Soundgarden growing up, I just can't listen to much of Audioslave's output, regardless of Tom Morello's guitar playing. Chickenfoot is a completely different story, I think Chad Smith is a great drummer, but can't stand Sammy Hagar or Joe Satriani and found everything I heard from them to be wildly uninteresting.     As a big Ty Segall and Mogwai fan I'm definitely going to check out their new supergroups, but I'm not expecting anything too mind-blowing."
LetsTalkMusic,3dab2x,Miguelito-Loveless,2,Tue Jul 14 22:15:33 2015 UTC,"Note the difference between the frequency that rappers and producers cross pollinate verses the rarity of such cross pollinations/supergroups in rock.   Why do rappers bring in guests rappers while rockers rarely bring in guest guitarists or vocalists? For one, hip hop fans like it, while rock fans are rather skeptical.  OP and a number in this thread have indicated fairly negative feelings about supergroups in general (cash grab, letdown, pathetic grasp at relevance from bands past their prime, etc.).  I think artist blending (a term I coined to capture rock supergroups, guest rappers, and rap collectives/supergroups) is a good way for artists to increase exposure.  Even if the callabo isn't great, it still is a way for artist X to be exposed to the fans of artist Y.  Rock tends to avoid artist blending, and I think that means more limited exposure.  As for criticisms that super groups aren't super.  My take on it is that super in this context doesn't mean great or fantastic.  It merely means transcending a single group.  Why don't supergroups create better material? Well, regular groups don't consistently produce great material all the time, so it might be too much to ask of supergroups to continually hit it out of the park.  Queen + David Bowie is one example that supergroups can do good.  Also, the New Pornographers.  But I will admit that plenty of pairings have been less interesting.    However, rockers don't form supergroups that often and therefore no one has put a lot of effort into figuring out how to make them work. What is the best way to collaborate on songwriting?  X writes one song and Y writes the next, or X+Y write both songs?  Should the artists seek out new producers and engineers, or use the producer and engineer from either one band or the other?"

I do think that supergroups are often are underwhelming though; maybe it's unreasonably high expectations, but it's rarely ever a meeting of minds as much as it is either a clash of egos jockying to be heard or said meetings of minds just turns into a typical band where one or more members just turns into a generic sideman rather than having noticeable input.  Supergroups are technically still a thing, but it doesn't get quite as much attention due to bandmember sharing in indie circles being a very common thing."

I'd argue that their first album was extremely compelling.  Their second album, less so.  Perhaps much of this success was due to the seemingly disparate musical styles of James Mercer and Danger Mouse, but the writing was excellent on that album.  I find it difficult to listen to much of The Shins, but can listen to Broken Bells easily."

I hadn't considered them a supergroup before, but I guess they do fit the criteria. And that would be a great example of one that worked out well."
LetsTalkMusic,3dab2x,post_rock0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:21:22 2015 UTC,"I think supergroups have lost relevance in the modern era.  In the past, we had a lot more musicians who were renown for their technical ability and unique playing style.  Like a jazz group, it was easier for these kind of players to get together and jam on a few standards to create something new and interesting.  We don't see that so much anymore.  The idea of a guitar hero or its equivalent has fallen out of style.  The focus now seems to be more about songwriters.  If you take a songwriter with average guitar playing ability, and team him up with an average drummer and a bass player who has the basics down, it doesn't amount to much, regardless of how famous they all are.  You really need each member bringing something special to the table for the supergroup to sound different than just the primary songwriter's typical music."
