homestead,3e141g,Dragonstache,4,Tue Jul 21 03:42:53 2015 UTC,You don't have to be that far out in the sticks to homestead. Get some land 30 minutes outside of where you end up working and homestead on your off time.
homestead,3e141g,This_is_Hank,2,Tue Jul 21 04:43:53 2015 UTC,"It depends upon what you want to grow and what zone you live in. I'm in zone 8, so I can grow heartier greens through the winter, like spinach and Brussels sprouts. While it could be reasonable for crop rotation, through you may want to consider a cover crop which requires little maintenance to preserve the soil, it might not be the best thing for your job prospects. What are you planning on doing? Generally, technicians like phlebotomists and pharmacy techs, as well as hourly workers, like nurse anaesthetists, have greater flexibility for work schedule because they aren't salaried most of the time. But I can't see anyone allowing you to take off for 6 months without being replaced. If you've found such flexible work and earn enough in ~3 months to cover your overhead for the year, I don't see why you wouldn't be able to."

There's always something to do on a homestead! He and I both work part time all year, and we make it work.   Depending on what you want to do with your homestead, and the flexibility of your job, you could conceivably work year round and still have a large garden, maybe some chickens...

If your building your hobby farm start acquiring tools for your desire build.  Should have your assortment of hand tools and garden tools.  Spade, metal rake, hoe, hand shovel, trimmers. Check out estate sales and garage sales ""always tons this time of year"" If its of scale I suggest a rotor tiller especially if its not bin previously used to farm. Finding one that's not running and fixing it is one of the options you have with time so look for a good brand used one.  Chain saw might be of use depending on how much land is cleared.  Giving the scale of smaller operations its rare you need new equipment as it won't be used to scale and engine hours it was designed for so don't fear buying old agriculture equipment its built to last."

Unless your fiancee is Japanese... in which case, that'd make things much easier.  On one hand, as conservative as Japanese society is, they are a little more into new & novel building techniques than many other countries.  IIRC, Michael Reynolds has built some Earthship homes there.  On the other hand, their permitting process is not to be taken lightly.

Then there's the organized crime factor - the local Yakuza might have their hands in the local construction scene and will need their palms greased as well.  I'd also be extremely wary about building so close to a rock quarry in a nation so prone to earthquakes as Japan is.  You will need a surveying service who can tell you where it'll be structurally sound to build.  Odds are, this will be a necessary part of the permitting process.  Expect to spend quite a bit on this alone.  I don't want to discourage you or be a downer, but you have a steep uphill battle ahead of you.  If you have a local expat group, try to see if anyone there has gone through something similar.  Source: My wife is half-Japanese.  EDIT: just proofreading"
homestead,3dshur,BoondhaG,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:53:40 2015 UTC,"Renting is a very big problem in Japan for foreigners.  Buying isn't -- you don't even need to be a permanent resident to buy property in Japan.  In fact, Chinese people are buying up desirable property all over the place.  I personally went through most of the process about two years ago, buying a used house in the area.  I backed out of the deal last minute for personal reasons, but it was a surprisingly straight-forward, simple process.  Yakuza influence in most of Japan is minimal; especially places as rural as the ones I'm looking at.  In my rather small prefecture, there're like two streets in two cities where they dominate business.  There might be fingers in construction here or there, but that is more for government contracted work than a family getting a house built, IMO.    Other than those two points, yeah.  I wonder what building on a rock quarry entails.  Clearly there is dirt/grass there, but it looks like the whole property was carved directly out of the mountain.  I will definitely be getting a survey, but I might go back tomorrow with a shovel and take a peek.  Finally, there are different building codes depending on where you want to build.  Strict in the city, relatively lax in the outer limits, and Wild West in the deep countryside.  This area is the latter, and there is very very little that you can't do.  For almost exactly this reason, you can find some really cool housing like what you mentioned!"
homestead,3dshur,XxionxX,3,Sun Jul 19 13:44:36 2015 UTC,"Alright lets work this out. $80,000 for the property. Lets call that $90 after fees.  I don't know much about Japan so I'll just give you American prices, it can't be dramatically different. $150k - 90k = $60k left. $6,000 for the well. $2,000 for the well house pump and setup. $6,000 for the septic. Now you are left with $60k - 6k - 6k - 2k or $46k.   Don't forget power! Another $10k or you could go solar, about the same price.  For all three of these you'll need a big backhoe (priced in) so if you do them all at once, it'll save you costs on the backhoe.  Bonus, if you can level your build pad, put in your road, and also build your privacy berms and maybe a pond that'd be a huge plus.  So you have $36k left and still don't have a house to live in yet. You want to do Cob, Straw bale, etc. Sounds good, but I would put them on hold for now and just build a Tiny house (hoping that things will be ok as far as local regulation.).  I would build a 12x16 tiny house cabin (not a trailer) with two overhangs and a bedroom loft first. Then I would build my main house over the next 3-5 years. The tiny house would not be in the same location as the primary house, and would be a temporary building to live in for up to 5 years to gain the skills and materials to build the primary house. Then afterwords it be converted into a guest house.   If you build the house yourself using temporary techniques (no concrete foundation, PEX plumbing, DYI wiring, propane heating) its really easy and can be done in a few months for about $10-12k.  I'd spend the rest on fencing and top soil, or better yet I'd buy a few tons of alfalfa and barley seed for fodder and get some live stock to start building up the soil for the farm .  Also make sure there is a Internet connection so you can keep us up to date on your progress."

homestead,3dnmlv,XIsaaq,4,Fri Jul 17 19:07:09 2015 UTC,"The first thing you need to do is buy a lot.  The foundation requirement is almost entirely dependent on your soil, your topography, and what's under it.  Then you can plan where you want your house, driveway, garage, barn, utility lines, etc.  You will have to get the utility companies to put in connection.  Learn the local laws too.    I likely know less than you, but I suggest that you build a small building first.  Basically a little cabin with electricity, a bathroom(maybe even with shower/water heater), a sleeping place, and a storage shed or workshop.  It could become your garage or just a retreat from the chaos of the house.    For one thing, it would make the construction of your actual house much easier logistically and comfortably.  No one wants to use a lawn john for 2 years or waste precious hours running back and forth.    Second, it will give you experience doing most of the things you will need to build your house.    Third, it will tell you how fast you work and a good idea of what it will take to make the house you want.  The last thing you want to do is to run out of time/money/patience when it's halfway done."

Lots of the work you'd do to frame a straw-bale house is pretty similar to conventional timber framing, although you might go with wider separation between the vertical members than is usual, to make fitting the straw bales easier.  Have a look at the difference between ""stick framing"" and ""timber framing"" on google.  Straw bale builds tend to be closer to the latter in terms of the sizes/spacing of timber used."

The same size and spacing of joists (large pieces of wood that are under the subfloor and hold it all up) will be required for the second floor, as the first."

homestead,3dojh3,Kodomachine,3,Fri Jul 17 23:27:55 2015 UTC,"That seems high for a 24hp tractor, even with all the additional items.  I purchased a brand new Kubota MX5100 with Front end loader, bush hog, root rake with hydraulic grip and box blade for $30K in 2014 @ 0% interest.  Mine is 52 horsepower, fuel efficient and a beast for what I use it for.  I wanted the backhoe attachment but after much research I determined that it's a lot of money for something that is a bit of a pain to take on and off.  Isn't really that powerful.   I'm not sure what you will be using yours for but that is probably a $8K of your price.    A backhoe on a 24hp would be pretty much useless unless you are digging trenches in completely rock free environment.  You are probably better off saving the money and buying a slightly bigger tractor and outsourcing the backhoe work or renting a backhoe for longer periods of time.  I'm looking for a used backhoe or track hoe but I just paid a guy with a large track hoe $100/hr to dig another huge pond for me.  That is very, very reasonable when you figure his time, fuel, wear and tear on a $100+K piece of equipment.  Good luck in whatever you choose.     That's my 2 cents.  :)   I love my Kubota btw."

Another plus, the ride on can pull a small swiveling dump cart - it's fucking awesome.

Besides, you still have debt to pay off and the government will hunt you down for that eventually.   If you would like more education, check out WWOOFing and volunteer on organic farms in exchange for a place to stay.  I found a place for a whole growing season once.  You might be able to do some small work off someone's farm, live for essentially free, and get lots of practice on someone else's dollar.  Also, you might find (with more experience, maybe) that you can use part of someone else's farm, stay on it, and pay only a little profit if you sell produce or goods. I think it would be wise to start smaller than on your own in a patch of woods.  I;ve found directories (i'm not in the US) for older farmers seeking young ""apprentices"" or owners of unused land hoping someone will work it, and training programs, conferences, and farm tours or exchanges.  The more you can immerse yourself in people doing the same thing, the more resources you will have, and this sort of people I have found are very willing to share."

homestead,3dipl3,Dekonite,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:56:25 2015 UTC,I dont know a lot about meat goats. I assume the nutritional requirements are similar and they're just putting it to muscle and fat instead of in the pail. You can keep 4 pretty happily on 1-2 square bales a week. You can also build a round bale feeder pretty easily. Just elevate it on something and wrap it with woven wire somewhere dry. A round bale would likely keep four goats fat and happy for the whole winter.

I have permanent set up I put them in when I cant get them to fresh brush. Inside it there is a round bale that my friend gave me. They haven't ate but 1/20th of it since May. They also have green grass to graze on while they're in there. So I wasn't sure how much hay they need when they don't have anywhere to graze.  How late into the year can they typically graze before everything dies.

homestead,3datu6,RoyalBlueMoose,4,Wed Jul 15 10:57:11 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind I'd like to give you a little bit of guidance.   I've owned and repaired a lot of vehicles, more than half of them have been trucks or suvs build on truck frames. I'm also a future homesteader and have done a lot of research regarding the best truck for the job.  First, I'd say that you are doing well by looking at an inexpensive truck. Whatever you buy is going to get more than normal wear and tear and it makes no sense to buy something newer and expensive. Truck technology hasn't come very far in the last 20 years in areas that matter. Sure, they're more comfortable, get marginally better fuel economy, make more horsepower, and are a bit safer in a crash, but at the end of the day, a $3000 1/2 ton truck from the 90's in good condition will accomplish all of the tasks of a new $50,000 1/2 ton truck with a significantly lower investment.    Older trucks are also significantly easier and cheaper to repair. They are pretty basic and there is a lot of room (on a full size) to access the components that need replaced or repaired. I am not someone who would suggest you seek out a truck from the 80's so that you will have a carburetor that's easier to repair than a fuel injection system. Trucks from the 90's were superior to the 80's in a lot of ways and the advantages of fuel injection outweigh the disadvantages heavily on a vehicle you don't plan to modify.   I am going to logically proceed through what is essentially a mental flow chart for making this decision.  First question. What type of truck do you need? Do you need a small truck(s10, ranger), mid size(dakota), or full size(ram, silverado, f-150)?  The answer in my opinion 98% of the time is full size. Here is why. That 2wd dakota you are looking at has only 2 perceived advantages over a full size truck. 1. It gets better fuel economy. 2. It's smaller and easier to park. In the real world these are both useless qualities. That mid size truck gets only marginally better fuel mileage than a full size ram with 4wd. Why? because fuel economy has always been a secondary concern with trucks. The priority is the accomplishment of work and that requires torque which requires fuel. Plain and simple, a full size truck will do a LOT more work than a small truck and only cost you marginally more in fuel. Let the commuters worry about fuel economy, there is work to be done on the homestead. Also, parking size should not be an issue. You're a homesteader so you don't live in New York City...you likely will not be parallel parking it often.   Now that we have established that we want a full size truck, what brand should we pursue? Chevy? Dodge? Ford? Toyota?  The answer is whichever one you can afford in the best condition. I personally purchased a 2001 Dodge Ram 1500 4x4 with the Off-Road group that will eventually be my farm truck. Is it the absolute best truck? No, but it was in great condition at a very good price. The condition part is the most important here. I see people get all worked up about how reliable chevy trucks are and they buy an old clapped out silverado that gives them a bunch of problems. The fact of the matter is, in the used market, condition is everything. Find something you like with 4wd with as low of miles as possible, but more importantly, I want you to find something with a stellar service record and that still looks new. You want something that was taken care of, not worked like a dog for 15 years and not maintained.   Next we have to decide on options. There is no real wrong answer here, but I prefer an extended cab. Short or long bed is fine. If you need more hauling, use a trailer. The extended cab is nice for keeping tools and equipment that you would rather not get wet or covered in snow, or what have you.   Next is the engine and transmission. I suggest you skip the base v6 options and get at least the entry v8. For chevy in the 90's this is the 305, dodge had the 318, and ford had the 302. These will likely be sufficient for your tasks, but will return the exact same economy as the larger versions (350, 360, 351) while putting out less horsepower and torque and will likely cost the same in the used market. If there are two trucks side by side for the same money with different engines, take the larger one.   When it comes to transmissions things get muddy. Old automatic transmissions from ALL BRANDS are pretty terrible. You'll hear about dodge's having transmission problems and that's a fair stereotype (the problem was often caused by transmission shops assuming the transmissions used the same fluid as the other brands when in fact they required ATF+4 specifically but you can't verify the correct fluid was used anyway so it's irrelevant) but the other brands are just as bad in the used market. People simply don't maintain their vehicles and as a result the automatic transmissions tend to fail. The most durable auto's in the 90's appear to be found in the fords. Manual transmissions are easier to rebuild, tend to last longer, and are cheaper to replace, but are nowhere near as convenient for hitching up a trailer, driving on hills, off roading (manual is better, not easier here), etc. Manuals were hard to find in the 90's in trucks so plan on having an auto and plan on replacing it at some point. Buy a re-manufactured transmission from a reputable business(jasper, ETE, etc), maintain it, and you'll be good forever. Don't waste your time and money with rebuilds.  Another consideration is axle choice. In the 90's GM used an independent front suspension system which road nice but was crap, dodge used a solid front axle (dana 44) that was durable but liked to leak a lot, and ford I believe used a twin traction beam setup. The solid axle rides more firm but articulates over rocks and crap on the road better than independent and is more durable. Let me put it this way, it's common practice to swap a solid axle into a 90's gm truck, but I've never once seen someone convert from a solid axle to independent suspension on a truck.   Lastly, 4wd vs 2wd. Just buy a 4wd truck. Will you need it? Maybe, maybe not. Will you be pissed if you have a 2wd and get stuck at the back of your property because most 2wd trucks have open differentials which means only 1 wheel gets the power from the engine and it's the wheel with the least grip? Yep. I used to have a 1991 2wd silverado and I once got stuck in a flat parking lot that had already been plowed. I happened to park with one of my rear tires on an ice patch and when I went to leave all the torque was sent to that wheel and it just spun. The other rear wheel got no power whatsoever and I ended up having to pull the truck out with a tow rope....by hand. Good luck pulling that off on the homestead.   So you've established that you want a full size truck with a v8 and 4wd for under X number of dollars. If you're willing to spend the money to buy something newer than the 90's I suggest that you do, but there is really no sense in spending more than $5000 on a truck. $5000 in my state will buy you a nice dodge, a decent chevy, or a very rough ford or toyota. This may vary where you live. Pricing and demand is all based on consumer perception, not on how good or bad the product is.  Lastly, I'd suggest buying from an individual not a dealer (unless they have a killer deal). The individual is more likely to know the service history and will likely be willing to settle on a lower selling price. You must understand going in that this truck you buy may break down on the way home...and it doesn't matter where you bought it. There are no guarantees. Don't fall into the dealer security trap.  TL:DR: Buy the best condition v8 full size truck you can find in your area. Spend no more than $5000. Learn to fix the damn thing."
homestead,3datu6,Msmith68w,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:13:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for the great info. I have been shopping around a bit more to see what I can find. I've found a couple larger trucks and plan on test driving them too. I really don't want to go over $2000.   The enticing thing about this Dakota is its enough truck for what I want now. Who knows later on though right? Plus it has low mileage and its previous owner was a golf course so I imagine it didn't see too many hard miles.
homestead,3datu6,Msmith68w,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:17:12 2015 UTC,"I would seriously suggest you try to come up with a little more money. It has been my experience that $2000 vehicles have a lot of immediate problems that need to be fixed while $4000-$5000 vehicles don't typically need repair at all for a while. I once test drove a blazer that I thought drove fairly nice but had a somewhat rough body. Bought it for $1800 and the transmission failed on the way home. The dakota may not have seen hard miles, but it very well could have seen a lot of easy miles and no maintenance and if it's giving the owner issues that explains why it's priced so cheaply.  The dakota is enough truck right now but I would seriously look at 4x4. If you can pull the vin number off the dakota you can look and see if it at least has a limited slip differential in the back. If it does, then you could maybe get by. Open diff is garbage though."

Even if it only lasts a year, you wont have hardly any money tied up in it, so you can buy another junker if/when the time comes.      90s Silverado/Sierra, or an S-10/Sonoma with the 4.3 V6 are good substitutes."

I wanted to be able to ride it with friends so I got a 'race' model instead of the farm '4x4' style. A quad is more lightweight and doesn't have a problem with the hills but it has a problem carrying a 15gal tank to spray stuff or water stuff. It has a problem carrying it because there isn't a good place to put the tank. I have to use 3 straps to keep it mostly in place and be extra careful when taking off too fast and/or going up a hill. If i had a 4x4 model, there would be a sweet 'platform' on the front and rear to hold the tank with ease. /shrug If I needed to haul the tank around the property more than I do, i'd get something different but I don't so I have the best of both worlds.

Supoosesly not too hard of a fix, but still, that was after the windows stopped working, the stereo died, ac died, lol. Shit. And I'm no motor head.  How well does that someone making the offer like you? That's how good the truck will be. I hate to be a pessimist. A Dodge Dakota hmshould have a nice big bed and if it's running it'll probably keep running till it doesn't.   Say it lasts 6 months. Buy two 1k trucks per year for eleven years and you've spent the 22k you'd have spent on a truck that would a lasted you eleven years.  It's completely out of mine with my ethics governing consumption though. I assume the low price of junkers reflects planned obsolescence and overproduction more than the actual environmental cost of production.  Consider aJapanese truck.

Basic brewing is sugar + yeast = alcohol. The sugar source will be the easiest; either have an orchard or hives. The hard part of it all will be obtaining wild yeast. Its a slow process. But instead of delving straight into medieval methods of brewing, I think you should start off with modern brewing techniques, identify what you can produce in a medieval fashion and what you want to produce, then adapt your technique to a technology that you deem to be medieval."
homestead,3d69ra,BennyAndMaybeTheJets,3,Mon Jul 13 23:27:48 2015 UTC,From what I remember they didn't  even know they needed yeast until like the 1500's. They just knew the had to do certain things which ended up contaminating it with yeast.
homestead,3d69ra,cavedildo,3,Tue Jul 14 13:10:44 2015 UTC,"From the Wikipedia page for the German Purity Law (circa 1487):  ""No yeast was mentioned in the original text. It was not until the 19th century that Louis Pasteur discovered the role of microorganisms in fermentation; previously, yeast was not known to be an ingredient of beer. Brewers generally took some sediment from the previous fermentation and added it to the next, the sediment generally containing the necessary organisms to perform fermentation. If none were available, they would set up several vats, relying on natural airborne yeast to inoculate the brew."""
homestead,3d69ra,butlertd,3,Tue Jul 14 13:55:57 2015 UTC,"Don't confuse Pasteur's discovery of yeasts as a microorganism with people knowing that they needed yeast.  Adding some of the sediment from a previous batch IS adding yeast.  They knew things went better if they did that, particularly if the previous batch had turned out well.  And yes, if they didn't  have that, they relied on random factors and hoped for the best.    For grapes and apples, anyway, most of the time that turns out just fine.  But that really depends on the state of the fruit at the time of the crush.  Healthy, fresh fruit juice with a good sugar/acid balance is an enviromnent that strongly favors yeasts - they take over the fermentation, and basically overrun everything else.  Unsound fruit, i.e. decaying, moldy, etc, doesn't have that advantage.  By the Dark Ages, people who made wine, brewed, etc knew this, and were usually able to produce something reasonable.  The thing to keep in mind is that a crush/mash is an ecosystem that starts out containing every microorganism that was present in the air, plus whatever you add.  The trick is to control environmental factors so that you favor the microorganisms you want to thrive, and disadvantage the others.  If you start out with fresh grapes and observe basic sanitation, nature is on your side.  That's mostly true for apples as well.  For grain mashes, that's not AS true, but is still true enough.  I've read in many places that people would leave a porridge out, and it would naturally ferment into something drinkable.  That might happen one time in a million.  For a decent beer, the grains in a mash need to first be germinated, i.e. malted, to allow the natural enzymes in the grain to start converting starches into sugars.  After that happens, the malted grains can be boiled to extract the sugar, and treated pretty much like a grape must after that.  I'm not saying there's no fermentable sugar in unmalted grain - obviously, if that were true, we'd have no bread.  But there's a difference between having enough sugar to make a little CO2 to make bread rise, and having enough to produce a beer that's drinkable and that won't spoil in a day. Medieval brewers certainly knew about malting and brewing - these arts had been developed much earlier.  On the topic of mead, I have to say that honey by itself ISN'T the best environment for brewing.  That's why honey was often mixed with the juice of various fruits, both to add the naturally occuring yeasts that were present on the skins, as well as to supply acidity to favor the growth of desirable yeasts rather than bacteria/mold."

Turns out that's where the dormant yeast settled.   The open vessel was thought to help the angels bless the batch. Some monks put the elevated the vessels to ahe attic to get the batches closer to heaven. That caused only certain types of yeast to enter the batch. Thus, the lambic ale."
homestead,3d69ra,rhill2073,2,Tue Jul 14 03:44:24 2015 UTC,It is important to realize though that it was fermented in open air in buildings that did a LOT of brewing and had many containers of beer around by people who might as well have bathed in it they drank so much. Your yeast profile in the air is not the same as it was then. You can absolutely wild ferment. It still works. But they weren't exactly starting from nothing when it came to yeast cultures back then.

homestead,3d69ra,not_whiney,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:09:20 2015 UTC,"Ive read a bit about it, maybe the ways they thought they were preventing a foul batch were religious, but the methods that actually prevented the unwanted microbes were usually an integral part of the process that were taken for granted. For instance adding fruit skins to the batch will attract certain bacteria that will frequently out compete the undesirable microbes, thereby making a very tasty brew.  There are many other methods as well, one of which is using human saliva as a main ingredient in the recipe. The saliva contains innumerable desirable microorganisms that put a quick stop to any nasty activity in the wort"
homestead,3d69ra,zalazalaza,0,Tue Jul 14 12:10:17 2015 UTC,"Uhm. No. Unwashed fruit skins have both good and bad bacteria. Your mouth has both good and bad bacteria.   Bacteria are not ""attracted"" to fruit skins, the skins are contaminated with them or not. The reason that brewers are super pickey about cleanliness and sterilization is that it is how you prevent contamination.   I also don't think you realize that food borne illnesses and diarrhea were quite often the leading causes of deaths during this time frame. You have a romanticized and overly rosy idea of how things were during that time frame. They did not own the land they farmed and may not have even got tho farm the same strip of land from one year to the next. Farmers did not do metal working, that was work for blacksmiths who were members of a guild and protective of their technology. You didn't pop off to the pub to have a pint at the end of the day. The reason so much ""beer"" was consumed was most of it was just boiled grains that got left out and fermented on there own. The only reason they were not more contaminated was they had to boil them to soften the grains. In many areas leavened bread was no even available to the poor and farmers. It was made by bakers, not just people. Bakers were taught as apprentices how to make bread and baked goods.  Peas, some tubers, and grains were the main foods. Meat was rare for the poor. No Potatoes, Tomatoes, yams, most peppers, or any of the squashes were to be had. Fava was the only old world bean in England. Hunting lands were mostly owned by the nobles or the king and could not be hunted on. There was no refrigeration so you ate it when it was slaughtered, sold it to be eaten, or could cure it. Except salt was a major commodity during this time so even curing meats was a luxury unless you lived very close to the sea.   The average pheasant ate a dark, crumbly bread made from rye and barley, generally they could not afford wheat. Maybe soem hard cheeses and bread for lunch. And then the most common food item pottage or porridge.  Boiled oats and grains with whatever else you might have boiled into it. Dinner might be peas porridge, in a pot, and be several days old. Ie you just add some water and reboil it each day.  Fruit would have been limited and only available around the harvest time. They did not have canning, freezing, or even basic cold storage. So they would dry it and try and ferment it into wines. because it was the only choice they had. And why ferment it? Because it was going to do that whether they wanted it to or not. They would just hope it made wine and not something else."
homestead,3d69ra,not_whiney,2,Wed Jul 15 02:29:44 2015 UTC,"I have no clue what you are referring to as far as romanticizing said lifestyle. Also, the reason the fruit skin has the bacteria on it when added is that the bacteria are attracted to it.  You should just read a bit about wild fermentation and you would know that the process makes safe food stuffs. In the past 150 years or so, there have been a total of 0 deaths due to this process, which should not be confused w/ canning and the botulism problem.  I get my information from books written by experts on the subject, a subject frequently summed up in so many words as you have uttered in a medieval history class.  For a more informed perspective, I recommend 2 books for starters.

homestead,3d69ra,zalazalaza,0,Wed Jul 15 02:55:40 2015 UTC,"Do you think bacteria choose where to hang out? Fruit has bacteria on it. Period. Why do you keep saying attracted? Bacteria either drift in air currents or are spread by contact with contaminated surfaces.   I know you can ferment this way. I know it can be relatively safe. I don't know where you get your Stat from about 0 deaths. But sure. But then again I have read quite a bit about the political, cultural, and agricultural history of Europe and the dark ages. Romantacizing them is any time you believe they were anything but short brutal lives for most of the peasants during that time.   Conditions were horrible and even the rich would manage to starve some years. It was not a Tolkien-esk Shire. It was nothing like that. And if they had the choice to live in those conditions or modern conditions they would live I  modern ones."

I suppose attracted could be the wrong word, though it is the one I have read most when referring to the process of harnessing natural microbes to ones advantage.  Needless to say , things are not simply created with bacteria already in place ready to go, and the bacteria that thrive on a piece of fruit, in the air in your home , or say on a birch tree etc..... can be pretty consistently tracked and used, it isn't just a random guess when you through apples skins into a bread sponge that it will make the bread rise and produce sourdough it is a consistent effect."

At best some trial and error when into things, but most of the Brewers were fairly secretive about how they did what they did. So we're the bakers.

homestead,3d69ra,zalazalaza,2,Thu Jul 16 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"In general, it was better than just blind hope.  The Dark Ages in England are generally considered to begin around 450AD, with the departure of the Romans, and to end in 1066 with the Norman Conquest.  While viticulture was never extensive in England, there was some - mostly in monasteries, and more after the warming cycle began in about 900AD.  The Dark Ages were ""dark"" because trade had become difficult after the Romans left, which caused communities to have to become more self-contained and self-sufficient.  You need to get the technological context right here:  The Romans left behind a good understanding of winemaking, viticulture, brewing, etc.   Glassblowing and coopering were well-known arts.  The use of sulphur (as I pointed out below) to sterilize and preserve was PROBABLY understood.  (Records aren't entirely clear.)    The important point here is to not confuse the Dark Ages with the Stone Age.  There was a decent basic technological context that allowed for producing decent wines and brews much of the time.  As I pointed out earlier, it was not much different than the methods we used when I was a kid in NYC back in the Mid-20th Century (yes, I'm that old...), and was certainly no different than what was practiced in my family's home town in Italy before they immigrated to the USA in the early part of the 20th Century.  Yet they (and we) produced decent, drinkable wine most of the time.  Dark Ages communities in England were of a number of different types.  You had monasteries and larger estates, where there were specialists who did the brewing/cider-making/winemaking, usually trained to do this from childhood.  These places generally produced a decent product.  While they did pray for the success of the brew/wine, they also practiced some degree of sanitation, reasonable storage, and learned from year to year. The abbots and lords didn't drink swill.    I'm not sure how historically accurate the OP's notion of a small, totally self-sufficient community, in which each member did everything, is.  It seems that it would have been rare for the same person to be doing bow-making, hunting, building, agriculture, cooking, brewing/winemaking, ..., and not to leave out fighting, since those were pretty lawless times.  (Which is why people banded together into larger communities...)   The image I'm getting seems to be more consistent with the romanticized notion of an American pioneer, ""Little House on the Prairie"" sort of thing..."

While it's true that medieval brewers and winemakers didn't have access to all the chemicals and test equipment we have today, it doesn't follow that they didn't learn from mistakes, and that they didn't produce pretty decent beer, wine, cider, etc.  BTW - the first glass bottles were produced about 1500 BC, and the art of glassblowing was pretty commonplace by the Dark Ages.  As was the art of coopering.  They had both bottles and barrels in the Dark Ages.  There are records of the use of yeast to leaven bread and to ferment alcoholic beverages going back to the ancient Egyptians.  It was common for bakers to use the sediment produced in wine or beer making for bread as well, and both brewers/winemakers and bakers would save some of the yeast from older batches to start new ones.  They would keep records of how good/bad the old batch was, and would select, over time, for the yeasts that produced the best results.  The original yeasts for brewing were basically what was collected on the skins of grapes or apples, or what was collected in a mash.  This isn't very different from the way we used to make wine back in New York City when I was a kid.  My neighborhood was full of Italian immigrants (my family, for example), and many of the old-timers would make wine in their basements every fall.  I used to make it with my uncle and grandfather.  We never added any yeast - we just used what was on the skins of the grapes (which were brought in from California, by rail).   Every few years a batch would go bad, but the kind of bad was usually that it would turn to vinegar the following summer, mostly if you hadn't sulphured it, and the place where you stored it wasn't cool enough.  (Basements in NYC basements made pretty decent wine cellars...) There are written records of burning sulphur to produce SO2 to keep wine from turning bad going back to the 1400s, but it's claimed that the Romans did this - so it was probably known in the Dark Ages as well.  Only once in thirty years of making wine did I ever have a batch go 'skunky'.  Mostly, we produced ""Dago Red"", which was pretty strong (a blend of Zinfandel, Alicante-Bouchet and Muscat grapes from California's Central Valley), not very subtle, but entirely drinkable.    You seem to be confusing living a medieval lifestyle with living the life of a medieval hermit.  In the Dark Ages, people still lived in communities.  While estates had to be fairly self-sufficient because of the suppression of trade, there was still a great deal of specialization among the residents within the estate.  The brewer/winemaster/whatever was fairly well trained, and the craft developed year after year and generation after generation."

The last time I cooked them and added wine yeast and sugar and it ended up tasting skunky and weirdly smoky!? I don't get it. Point is, I agree, simple isn't  always bad.

homestead,3d69ra,Terrapinterrarium,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:26:23 2015 UTC,"In general, you should NEVER cook an entire batch of fruit juice when you're making wine.  It won't clear, and it will also take on an unpleasant, caramelized flavor.  In the part of Italy that my family is from, they make a type of wine called ""Vino Cotto"", (cooked wine).  To make this, a small part of the must is cooked down to concentrate the sugar in it, and that part is allowed to cool, then added back into the main body of must as it ferments.  The reason they do this is that the region is mountainous, the summers are short-ish, so the grapes don't develop a really high sugar content.  Using this concentrated syrop raises the sugar content of the must in order to raise the alcohol content of the wine.  You can accomplish the same thing by adding sugar.  It's never necessary to do both.  Vino Cotto generally does not become completely clear, and has a very characteristic ""cooked"" tasts - probably what you're describing as ""smoky"".  I can't even imagine how awful a wine made after cooking ALL the juice would be.  The best way to control the yeast in a wine/brew is to stun the wild yeasts in it with sulphur dioxide, usually done by adding some potassium metabisulphate (meta) to the must/wort right at the beginning.  You want to add just enough to ""stun"" the wild yeasts, not so much as to make the must totally sterile (which would create an environment just as hostile to the desired yeasts as to the wild ones.)  There's a formula, basically a certain number of grams per gallon....    Half a day or so after hitting the must with the meta, you add your yeast starter (that you made from the same pressing, with commercial yeast added), and take advantage of the fact that your starter gave the selected yeasts a head start over the ones that you ""stunned"".    This process of sulphering to stun the wild yeasts, then adding a starter made with selected yeasts is how wine was made in the finest wineries for many centuries."

A digital thermometer is more accurate than guesstimating the temperature so you run less chance of off flavors or failing to sanitize the wort.   Like everyone else has said, the process is still the same."
homestead,3d69ra,Shayla06,2,Tue Jul 14 00:37:21 2015 UTC,"Vikings used to take whole bee hives, bees and all, and drop them into a pot of boiling water on a fire. The heat killed the bees that fermented with the honey and wax to make a mead that's very natural and healthy, if a little dirty looking and gross to some. You can, of course, strain it as much as you want. After it has boiled for a while (I'd probably go 30 minutes to be safe, but 15 is usual, I think), they left it sitting out. Natural yeast in the air would begin eating the honey and ferment the liquid into mead. =)"
homestead,3d69ra,dpad26,2,Mon Jul 13 22:46:41 2015 UTC,"that's pretty incredible, i never heard about the whole hive thing.  seems like a good way to destroy your source of honey though."

You can capture wild yeast, and you can brew in unsealed containers, but you're going to get levels of contamination which will make your brew kind of nasty. Once and a while you'll hit on a real nice batch, but mostly you'll be drinking stuff that has an aftertaste that makes you go... ""hmm.""  I've made plenty of cider using wild yeast. Let's put it this way: it's not nasty enough that I wouldn't drink it if I didn't have anything else to drink. It's better than nothing. But if I have to choose between buying yeast every few years and keeping some sealable buckets in order, versus drinking something that tastes like it was brewed with a wet gym sock, I'll tend to choose the former, sustainability be damned. :)"

Someone figured it out along the way that if you left sugar out, it would turn into fun.  Since you are homesteading, you could also grow your own hops.

homestead,3d69ra,dino_silone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"Most old school ciders and wines were made by crushing the fruit and letting it ferment.  There is enough wild yeast on the fruit skin to usually ferment the juice. A friend makes homemade unpasteurized apple cider in the fall, and after 3 days on a camping trip without refrigeration, it had a nice yeasty kick.  You can also look at yeast harvesting methods to cultivate wild yeasts in your area (they're everywhere).  As far as containers, Ceramic crocks/demijohns were commonly used.  You'd use a blowoff tube of some sort, then cork it."
homestead,3d69ra,wildebeest,0,Tue Jul 14 20:54:13 2015 UTC,"I've brewed open fermented cider a few times, but it takes significantly longer to ferment, upwards of a year, and there's a lot more opportunity for undesirables to creep in.   I'd recommend just getting yourself a few packs of dried yeast, a basic carboy and one-way valve. Your beer will be 20x better and take 1/4 of the time."

For details, hang out at  /r/permaculture for awhile, where hilltop property is considered a Type 1 error, meaning you avoid at all costs.

Honestly if you want to homestead there, check each property for where you think your garden/fields/pasture is going to be and get soil samples. Know before you start. Bad soil is hard to recover from.  Lowland can also be a pain if they are too low. Make sure that it is not a flood prone area and does not turn into a creek when it rains."

What about location? How easy is the land to access? Where are you located? Is offloading the property in 10 years something that concerns you? Is this a second property for you? What are your plans for the land? Does one of these support those plans better than another (good soil, older forest, streams, rivers, on a lake, whatever)? Will there be annual property taxes on top of the cost of land?  Also, I'm sure many in this sub would feel beauty is in the eye of the beholder as far as property so describing it as such isn't meaningful to anyone but you."

With a bit of deep thought  and foresight, it's not too tough to see how the appeal of ""getting away"" and living a ""simpler"" life could wear thin once the reality of day-to-day struggles sets in.  Those who mistake the ""simple"" life to mean ""easy"" life are in for a rude awakening.  I suppose in some ways it may be exchanging one set of problems for another.  The difference is that for many it's easier to accept the problems of a world otherwise surrounded with an overload of creature comforts not found in the ""off the grid"" world.  For me, it's mostly the idea that as a single person I'd be fully reliant on my own physical health to just stay alive.  All that work you're talking about having to do..all the driving..all the tinkering.. all require the physical ability to do it.  To not be too sick, too sore, or too just physically incapable. And I'm healthy now.  But that can change at any time and we're all getting older. But break a bone or fall seriously ill for a week or 2 and suddenly you can't load wood into the fire, feed animals, harvest resources, tinker with finicky systems, etc etc.   I suppose that's why plenty dabble in that sort of lifestyle while they are still young and spry.  Or you have a family that supports each other.  Anyway, sorry to hear about your issues. Does sound shitty.

Dry leaves work too, or wood chips.  When the drum gets full enough, lift off the seat. Clamp on the lid to seal it. Hang your block and tackle (or chain block) from the hook in the roof, attach your lifting clamp. Hoist the drum out of the hole onto your hand truck. Move it to storage.

homestead,3d0dpi,possompants,4,Mon Jul 13 03:12:24 2015 UTC,"I have only noticed a small uptick personally. Part of it is that I live in suburbia hell, and everyone here thinks it's better to have a perfectly manicured lawn than be growing food for themselves.  People in this neighborhood look at us weird because I've circumvented the covenants against rain barrels buy building an underground rainwater collection system that stores 1000 gallons, planted apple trees and now we're building raised garden beds for next spring. In a couple years, I may put some in the front yard as well if we're still here. I'd rather find 10 acres, but I don't think that'll happen with the property prices now. I know in the lower income areas of the city, there's been a huge upswing in gardens and such, but I guess people here think they're immune to financial trouble. Doesn't make sense to me."
homestead,3d0dpi,LostMyPasswordAgain2,4,Mon Jul 13 05:46:19 2015 UTC,"The other issue is that the amount of renters in cities has increased dramatically while the availability of vacant rental properties has plummeted. So you have people who rent houses and really want to set up rainwater collection and raised beds, but the landlord prevents them from doing so (because that would ruin the precious lawn! what are you, a hippie?) and few people are desperate enough to risk homelessness just to have a vegetable garden."
homestead,3d0dpi,shroom_throwaway9722,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:15:20 2015 UTC,"Fair points, but all of our neighborhood is occupied by the owners. They're all just consumerist whores, to put it nicely - Most of them spend more money taking care of their manicured lawns than anything else in their yard, and they never actually spend time them. One guy across the street refuses to put trees in his yard because he'd get leaves in the yard in the fall. He also pays a chemical company to come spray his whole lawn with 2-4-D every few weeks, because anything other than Kentucky blue grass in the middle of the midwest is crazy, apparently. All of them are this way, except for our one next door neighbor who generally thinks the same way I do - we both put pasture grass in our yards, let it grow long and didn't put in a sprinkler system. We're both putting gardens in, but I'm assuming they'll think that's weird of us to do as well."

For sanitizing, I use cheap vodka in a clearly marked spray bottle.

homestead,3d2nd9,Sanginite,2,Mon Jul 13 01:04:50 2015 UTC,"I've looked into it for my place and here's what we ended up with:   take an appropriate length of 6"" schedule 40 PVC pipe (in our case it was about 30' long). You're going to stick this in your pond in a way that one end is at the deepest part of the pond and one end is up on the bank. This pipe will house the pump.   You're going to need to cut intake slots in the pipe for the water to get in. The bottom of our pond is muck for a few feet so we cut our slots about 3 feet up from the bottom. The slots are 12"" long, spaced 1"" apart around the pipe, cut with a skill saw. These help to filter out gunk, whilst still allowing enough water in.   you're going to wire up your submersible pump (high flow, low pressure) and attach an adjustable rubber brace to the water line just above the pump to keep the pump from banging the walls of the pipe when you turn it on. You're going to lower all this into the pipe so that it's sitting just above the slits you've cut.   On the solar side, you'll have to figure out how much power you need to run the pump for however many hours/day you need to run it. You get panels and batteries to meet those needs, you stick them in the most ideal spot on the property and you run a cable from there to an electric box with a breaker (which is your on off switch for the pump) and another cable from there to the pump. If you don't want to manually turn it on then you can use a float switch or a timer.  you put a filter somewhere near the cistern where it can be easily serviced."
homestead,3d2nd9,lick_spoons,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:57:20 2015 UTC,I am doing something similar. I am irrigating my blueberries from my pond. I only have about a 15' rise. I easily go 500' though. With solar you are going to need an inverter. I haven't found any DC pumps that have enough preasure. Cheap sump pumps seem to work for my setup. I have dirty pond water any they are designed to deal with that. You will have to ask the store i if it will handle 30'  because that is a lot of preassure. On the inverter side buy a modified sign wave. It's only a motor so you don't need clean AC and the modified sign wave inverters are a 1/3 the price of a true signwave. Ebay has many. Cobra has a decent 1500 watt one. My solar array is 300watt and I only use a 1/2 dead car battery as a buffer. I stop my irrigation when the sun goes down.
homestead,3d0dz1,habi12,3,Sun Jul 12 13:03:14 2015 UTC,Brush goats! Tie them up like dogs with collars and dog chain to large blocks or trees and make sure they got they got plenty of water in a 5 gallon bucket and feed them 50 lb bag of sweet feed from the co-op. Give them enough chain to get about 10 to 20 feet into the brush and let 'em go. In no time at all they will have all the brush and weeds from as high as they can reach into the trees gone. Take 'em back to the sale barn where you bought 'em and PROFIT!
homestead,3d0dz1,tim03aw,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:25:35 2015 UTC,How much do brush goats cost and about how long do you think they'd clear the brush away? Goats are funny.
homestead,3d0dz1,tim03aw,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:10:06 2015 UTC,"Well...here in Mississippi...if you find a local farmer or someone on craigslist...you can get one for around $30-$50. If you do have to go to the sale barn...they typically do wind up being on the high side. Generally two or three of them can make a clearing in about 2 to 4 months. There are alot of ""if's"" with this statement...but you get the general idea. If the sale of the goats don't go as planned...here in Mississippi...we have been known to milk them if they are in season or eat them! My grandma used to cook goat meat and it was rather tasty after a hard days word around the house or in the field. I have seen where a fella has a business using goats to clear off rough terrain for Google!"
homestead,3d0dz1,jelliknight,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:49:36 2015 UTC,"From a childhood experience - goats left in one spot will probably end up ring barking the trees. If you want to kill the trees that's one way to do it, if not keep a good eye on when their food starts to run low and move them."
homestead,3d0dz1,not_whiney,2,Fri Jul 17 05:51:06 2015 UTC,"It looks from the picture that you have neighbors and are in some form of neighborhood/subdivision. If you are - Read your by-laws, and talk to the association.   If you are not in a homeowners association - talk to your neighbors very circumspectly. You have to realize that by law and custom you moved in after the neighborhood was there. So if there are rules about livestock and gardens/agriculture you are on the down slope looking up. (ie since they were there first, you are changing use, not the other way around. If it was originally a farm and they built up around you, maybe you get grandfathered, maybe not. But in this case you got no shot.) The land use rules would apply here and most are based on basically ""Do the neighbors give a shit?"" Almost all communities have rules on agriculture and livestock outside of Ag zoned areas. There is vast disparity to how they are enforced. More often than not, rules are enforced because of complaints by neighbors.    Bottom line - Make sure your neighbors are okay with what ever you decide to do.   Plan, plan, plan, plan. Contact your land grant university extension. Virginia has at least 3 different areas as far as farming goes. Coastal, Mountains, or upper flats. Where you are located will govern what you should plant.   Basic recommendations:  Small orchard can be supported. Use you extension to find out what best varieties are for your area. Fruit trees take several years to get to production. If you mess this up it takes years to recover. Right variety, in the right soil prep, in the right location gives years of fruit. Plan it out and make sure you use the best tress you can buy. Paying 20 bucks extra for a tree from a reputable orchard is worth the investment when you look at 20-25 year production. (Yes, Lowes has them on sale. No, they are not worth it.)  Raised beds - built in type. These are great for kitchen crops and ready use stuff like herbs, tomatoes, bell peppers, greens. If you want larger quantities - a garden with raised beds works really well.  (Not actually built though, just raised beds.) that way you can grow more crop oriented stuff if you want, potatoes, storage onions, beans for drying or canning. etc. Maybe a couple rows of sweet corn.     The woods. If it is actually any kind of hardwood or decent trees you can clear the brush out and keep the larger trees themselves. Keep the stuff near the edges anyway as a windblock/privacy line. If it is all scrub stuff and pine you could clear it once you get that far. However realize this - Once you clear it - it is gone. So plan, plan, plan. If you have no over-riding reason to clear it now. Don't it can be kept until you are ready to do something more with it.   Perennial beds. I recommend raised beds for simple control and ease of segregation. You can put in simple 4x8 foot raised beds using 2x12s and make a bed for asparagus, one for strawberries, one for rhubarb, etc. Each of these has different soil and fertilizer requirements so having separate beds will make for easier amendments etc. I recommend filling with a mix of topsoil and used mushroom compose. Great for raised beds.  Virginia has some what of a winter depending on the location. Consider investing in a hoophouse/high tunnel for extension of seasons. You could grow year round almost anywhere in Virginia with one. Johnny's seeds has some great products for these that you can do yourself and add on over time. It could allow you do quit a lot.  Animals - if you can get way with it because of zoning or no restrictions, then laying chickens is the easiest place to start. A coop can be built pretty cheaply and they can be secure fairly easily. You have woods near buy so opossum and raccoon are a concern. I would recommend that if you do chickens and want to not get complaints- NO ROOSTER. Also give the neighbors some eggs every once in a while. Give them some produce once in a while as well. Friendly neighbors generally don't call the zoning/animal wlefar people.   Dairy goats can be done on that land easily. Smallish breeds would be good for you. Some of the dwarf types would give reasonable milk within the capability of your land with very little supplementation.   Rabbits - they can be raised for meat and are relatively quiet and nuisance free as far as a food source. And can be processed at home if you want a supply of meat. They are easy to raise, have a good feed to meat ratio. Many can't get past the cute factor though.  For all the animals -  ""Storey's Guide to Raising...Blank"" are great starting points.  Hints   A. weeding a half acre of garden is a lot of work. A LOT. Start small and plan your way up. Figure out what you are willing to do and then do that. Then readjust what you are actually willing to do and fix your plan.    B. Use the right tool for the job. Using manual labor or the most basic of tools because it is more natural is BS. What is natural is getting the most output for a given input. It takes me 2 hours or more to till a 1 acre plot with a 5 foot tiller on a tractor. How long would it take to turn by hand with a shovel. (Rent if you can't buy.) You will be overwhelmed with a half acres of crops all by hand.  C. Do soil samples. go online and find a nearby sample lab that gives recommendations and contact them and get soil samples. I use these guys Midwest lab. They are great, fast and provide clear recommendations for gardens on what yo need amendment wise. Once you get farther in you can customize your sampling to what you are doing, but a sample is like 20$ with general garden recommendations -well worth the cost.  D. Pick a spot that seems reasonable and put in a decent sized compost pile. Put everything in it. Yard clippings, food waste, etc. If it rots, it goes in. Start now and get it going. They sell an inoculate for compost. It is a pile starter. It contains a wide spectrum of beneficial microbes and fungus spores. It gets you going faster. Also go get a couple shovels of the humus from the woods and put that in the pile when you start it. It will have many of the same things in a local variety.  E. The first crop you will grow is advice and recommendations and helpful BS from everywhere. Ignore all of it unless it makes good, sound sense and comes from someplace you trust. Get a good relationship with the Extension Service and the local Master Gardeners. Take all advice at face value and look it up. People want to be helpful but what solves issues for me in IL will not solve issues for coastal VA or upstate Idaho. Anecdotal evidence is usually unreliable unless backed with science. My grandpa always put mustard on flea bites.  -Uh thanks, (google search: Flea bite treatment, Mustard)   Good luck and if you want more advice for the compost, don't hesitate to ask."
homestead,3d0dz1,not_whiney,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:34:14 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks! I can't wait to get in the house. It's twice as big as our rental and we would literally never have to move again until we retire. (6 bedrooms 3.5 baths got it for a great price). I'm currently expecting   a baby so whatever I can do outside before I get really big is what will happen by the end of this year. I'll have a 4-5 month old by spring so whatever I can do in between feedings and naps! We're both vegans, so I'm excited to have enough room to grow a substantial crop. It'd be my dream to grow everything we eat. Also, I've always wanted to compost our leftover fruits and veggies. Do you have any suggestions for books I can read? Something that has a schedule to follow? Also, any suggestions in keeping the racoons out of the compost?"
homestead,3d0dz1,nonewjobs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:50:10 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the raccoon in the compost unless they become aggressive.   Books on every kind of system out there are available. But the problem is they all assume one thing ""you live and grow under the exact same conditions as them."" You don't so it won't work. Storey and the Rodale press people have some great books to start with.  make sure what they recommend fits your beliefs, soil, weather, etc.  Get with the extension service they have help on everything from basic gardening classes up to farming 1,000 acres. If nothing else they can put you in touch with local growers, CSA's, master gardeners, and clubs.  Something to get over early, you can never grow everything you eat without substantial land and the proper environmental conditions. That is unless you are willing to limit your diet significantly. Make plans to grow what you can grow where you live as much as possible, but understand you will still be buying food. It is good to grow your own, but recognize when certain foods you want will be cheaper to just buy rather than the time, equipment, and input it takes to grow your own. And even then you may not be able to produce as good a quality as a professional grower.  If you decide to go fully organic realize that you will have problems getting adequate organic fertilizer without animal sources. Also you don't have enough land for true crop rotation which is essential in the long term to limit soil/insect/disease issues. Three are plenty of stories out there of growing for several years under an organic system and then it crashing in a bad way due to long term misconceptions. These are decisions you will have to make - be realistic. You will be disappointed at how things turn out when you are not aware of the realities of growing and producing food."
homestead,3d0dz1,nonewjobs,2,Sun Jul 12 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"the FIRST thing I would do is to get a handle on that wooded area. Find out what there is to know about it.

SECOND thing I would do is get 3 garden beds ready: one for perennial herbs, both medicinal and culinary, one for annual herbs, and one plot for a perennial vegetable such as asparagus.  those were just the first things that came to mind..."
homestead,3d0dz1,RaleighDAD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:31:12 2015 UTC,You don't think September would be too late to start the garden beds? Or would I begin spring of next year?
homestead,3d0dz1,wagemage,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"You could always plant a green manure cover crop. Get the beds tilled/dug however you're going to do it, then let the cover crop establish before the snowfall, then turn it under in the spring when it's growing again.  Leguminous cover crops would be a good choice here since they fix nitrogen at the root zone. Or consider a mix of deep-rooting and leguminous, like say fava beans and peas.  Commonly used legume cover crops include: (from http://www.sare.org/Learning-Center/Books/Managing-Cover-Crops-Profitably-3rd-Edition/Text-Version/Legume-Cover-Crops)   Winter annuals, such as crimson clover, hairy vetch, field peas, subterranean clover and many others  Perennials like red clover, white clover and some medics  Biennials such as sweetclover  Summer annuals (in colder climates, the winter annuals are often grown in the summer)   Legume cover crops are used to:   Fix atmospheric nitrogen (N) for use by subsequent crops  Reduce or prevent erosion  Produce biomass and add organic matter to the soil  Attract beneficial insects   This will give you active decomposition in the spring right in the soil, will improve tilth and water holding capacity, and your plants will thank you for it.  Also, September is the perfect time to plant garlic and onions to overwinter. Even though you don't have prepared beds you could still plant these and most likely have decent success assuming that your soil is decent with a good pH. Spinach would do well here too, as well as carrots, etc.  Another approach to starting beds in September would be Lasagna Gardening. Google it up, it's a pretty easy method if you have access to a decent range of compostable materials. This method gets criticized because it makes a ""hot"" garden bed, but if you were letting it cook up over winter, it would be settled down enough in spring to allow the more tender food to be planted."

However, the hogs will try to dig up the roots and the roots will extend to about the same size a the tree's canopy.  You can give the hogs nose rings to keep them from rooting.  My first year, I tried both the ""humane"" nose rings and the septum nose rings.  The humane ones wouldn't stay on and one of the septum ones became infected.  I never went back to nose rings after that.  I built them a shade using a tin roof, 4x4 legs and 4x4 skids.  I used dado type joints at the legs and bolted it all together.  The hogs loved it and it gave them a good scratching post.  The next shades I built using some pipe and welded it all together.  Both worked well.  Also, try to avoid the industry standard pink hogs, they sunburn too easy.  Get good hybrid spotted hogs, and make sure they have a mud hole to chill out in and coat themselves with mud for sunscreen and insect protection.  I live in southern U.S., and it gets mighty hot here for outdoor hogs.  They love to play in the sprinklers in mid-day if you have a way to get water there easy.  Hogs are a blast to have around!

homestead,3d21ux,ascii122,2,Mon Jul 13 02:00:00 2015 UTC,we had pigs when I was a kid and had a lot of trouble with them rooting under the fences.  We had a lot of old tin roofing from an old building we took down so we lined the bottom of the fence with that and it helped a lot to keep them from getting out.  Pigs are smart.. only other critter that is better at getting past a fence is a Goat or an Elk
homestead,3d21ux,onthefarmga,2,Mon Jul 13 08:13:43 2015 UTC,"We bought a pregnant Tamworth sow a few months ago and last night she had 12 piglets.  The pig area on our place right now is about 130' X 50' and it's all done in 48"" wire field fence connected to t-posts and trees.  We also have electric lines inside at about 8"" and 18"".  I'm sure the sow could bust out if she really wanted to but after the first half hour she touched the electric lines a couple of times and stays away.  Also, she has everything she needs in there (lots of rotten logs and tree roots to grub up).  We want her to clear that lot before moving her and the piglets on to another.  Back to the fence question, the field fence and electric combo is great for us but we already had the electric anyway so it didn't cost much to put that in."

The pig that jumped the fence was a sow who had her pigs weaned so that was a part of it.  The sow went over a 3 foot wooden fence inside the barn.  I use 4x4 posts with a hog panel and then run a 2x6 along the top for the outside fencing.

She's convinced ALL goats are tricky to fence. My goat is friendly (was bottle fed) and a very simple electric fence with plastic posts works for her and the sheep. If she does get out she just wanders onto the porch (usually after eating some of my roses).. thankfully she rarely gets out.

I know it will work when I need it to, is not loaded with chemicals, doesn't have a monthly fee that I am forced to pay. I know t is more expensive initially, but in the long run I think it is a lot better."
homestead,3csxn5,gittenlucky,2,Fri Jul 10 21:00:19 2015 UTC,"Here is the issue: you usually don't get to pick. If anything, very, very rarely do you get to pick.   Either you live in a rural setting without a sewer system or you you don't. Rarely do you get a chance to actually pick. If they build up enough around you to require a sewer due to the concentration of homes, you will be put on the sewer whether you have septic or not.   You may want well water because of evil chemicals, but again you may not have much choice. In many areas you can not have a well if population is above a certain amount. Again human occupation density will preclude the use of a well whether you want it or not.   As to the safety. Most water systems are tested regularly by the provider and have to meet federal and state guidelines. Your well is tested way less frequently. In most palces it is only tested when you pay to have it tested. For us they will only test when there is a permit to do work on the well for the home or when the house sells. And then actually it is usually sampled for less than what municipal systems test for. SO realistically if you have a rural well, you are on your own for what you are actually drinking. Man made contaminates or natural ones.  The cost? It depends. In many areas the water system provides water that is pretty decent compared to what you get from a well. Our well water is high in iron and high in sulfur. Does it cost less? Maybe, maybe not. I don't get a sewer and water bill. But I pay electric for the well that I never see as a ""water"" portion of my electric bill. I have a water softener that has an expected lifetime that I had to buy. I regularly have to purchase salt to put in it. The water can be pretty sulfur heavy most of the time so we get 5 gal bottles to put in the cooler to drink. (Not necessary, but worth the extra cost just for the taste.) Most highly mineralized well water is hard on plumbing. Particularly water heaters. So we have to replace the element and a sacrificial anode more frequently and the whole heater will not last as long as on city water. Oh and the electric for the water softener too.    The septic has to pumped every 3-5 years depending on use and age. If it goes bad it will cost thousands of dollars to get a permit and decommission the old waste field properly and build a new one. Also since we have had too much rain lately the ground is saturated and the field can only take so much water and backs up. When it floods my neighbors 2 properties over has their field and tank overflow and nice septic runoff covers 2 properties as the water moves through to the drainage ditches/culverts.   Is it cheaper? The house I lived in with city water never had issues with the sewer. And we were only responsible for the line from the house to the street.  But again it pretty much is moot point except for a very small percentage of the country. Even if you have a choice now, soon enough you will not have one. Once an area develops past a certain point wells and septic are just feasible not from a public safety and health standpoint. And then you will have to go on city water and sewer whether you want to or not."

homestead,3ct0ol,seanthenry,2,Fri Jul 10 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"Lol, true.  I have currently a fiberglass handled axe, and have had and used many other fiberglass handles on sledges. The reason I don't like using them is because I do a lot of my wood splitting in weather where I can't do much else. So that means it's raining, the dead of winter, something like that. Fiberglass handles are slippery as hell when you have mittens on and you get snow on them, and almost as bad if they're wet either from sweat or rain or melted snow. I could put a rubber cover over it to make it less slippery, but at that fiberglass handles are already bulky and thicker than what I feel comfortable holding when I'm wearing mittens or something.   Wood is just so much easier for me to use."

The advice I got was to buy the smallest saw that will handle what you need, because you pick it up hundreds of times in a session and you want something that won't wear you out. Being tired is the #1 danger with chainsaws.   The ms250 is probably the most popular up here. Learn to sharpen your own chain and you are good to go."

My suggestion would be to get the saw you like, and have both a 16 and 20 inch bar and chain sets. You'll use the 16 95% of the time, but once in a while the 20 will be just what you need.   oh, and find a stihl dealer to get your bar and chain from.

(edit. the motor's size dictates what bars it can handle. You can swap bars on a saw.) You don't need a 20"" unless you'll regularly be downing 4 foot trees or are going to make boards.  My 59cc Stihl can barely handle a 20"" bar and needs to cool regularly when making boards/beams. A 59cc is a good size if you are going to be sawing 4 cords a year, though.(edit. if you'll be doing less, look for something smaller... they get heavy and if all I'm doing is clearing, I'll grab my smaller saw.)  I try to stick with a 16"" bar on any saw. It is safer and you get more power. I only throw on my 20"" when making beams.  edit. also, a 59cc is sold/seen as the largest saw a homeowner would need. Go larger if you're milling, go a little smaller for weight's sake, if you're not cutting many cords per year. Don't go too small, if you're buying for life."

homestead,3cr2fg,ascii122,2,Fri Jul 10 20:39:19 2015 UTC,Stihl is the only way to go. Go with an ms290 farm boss with a 20 inch bar to start. Make sure it is 3/8 chain.
homestead,3cr2fg,onthefarmga,2,Fri Jul 10 14:26:49 2015 UTC,"I do like the Stihl. I've had 042, 036, and now have the MS361.  Also have a smaller Husky.    The ONE thing I'd say is regardless of brand (Husky's and Stihls are the only saws I've seen used by loggers here in Oregon -- and there are camps for both.  Kind of like Chevy vs Ford) is get really good gas.  If you can find a source for non-ethonol super use that and use that ONLY.  If you start putting ethonol gas in your saw you are asking for trouble.  Non-ethonol mixed gas can stay stable for months, while regular ethonol can go bad in a matter of weeks, especially in damp environments.  You can find non-ethonol around boats -- most marinas will have a source since the last thing a boater wants is ethonol in their gas.  Or if there are any professional tree cutters around ask them where they get their gas.  Also get them (or someone) to teach you how to sharpen your chain.  LIke cortijoman says a sharp chain makes a smaller saw cut better than a dull chain on a big saw.  So good gas, sharp chain + pretty much any saw is a good start.  Good luck."

homestead,3cr2fg,cortijoman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:54:44 2015 UTC,"I know that chainsaws are expensive or less than perfect. The problem with chainsaws isn't the cutting but the starting in my opinion and that's cold or warm. Most of the chainsaws I dealt with have had some starting issues and I always swear I buy a better one until I see the price and the limited amount of time I'm going to use it. I have an old McCulloch, Poulan Wild Thing, Poulan Pro 20"" and on my last cutting I used a Poulan  14"" as well as Shindaiwa 14"" from friends. Within the last month I cut 6 pine trees, 2 maples and an old apple trees with some major trimming of old pines and cedars. I used my Poulan Pro that I probably bought in 2008 and had no problems. From the stump grinding I know that I cut 220 inches on the base so some trees were well over 30 in diameter and 50 feet tall. I just let the chainsaw to do pulling and don't try to force it. Make sure to sharpen your chainsaw every so often as it goes fast.  Would I want to buy a newer and bigger, of course, but am I going to use it to it fullest, probably not. I did notice that the newer Poulan Pro have returned to the old style with priming bulb and all. Poulan is actually owned by Husqvarna so while it's not the same, it's still have shared similarities.  I have to admit having the Shindaiwa or the smaller 14 inch chainsaw was nice when climbing and less tiring in the long run.  Since you are using it only occasionally for chopping down some felled trees, don't overspend  but make sure to use better gasoline, good chains, and more sharpenings.  and don't forget to wear protective clothes, helmet as it might save you one time."

It's only a really big problem if you're in a place that gets enough rain that your soil is pretty soft. If you're in the american southwest, the water from your septic field is probably soaking in pretty fast and you don't get enough rain to worry about any problems. If you're in the east, where there is plenty of rain to keep things at least damp most of the year, you'll probably get compaction of the soil. The worst case is that things get compacted so much that your field cannot keep up with your septic tank and it backs up into your house.  Do a trial run. See if there are any changes after a few weeks, a month, a few months. If everything is fine through your wettest season, you're fine.  If you have standing water, eliminate it: the animals will drink it and get sick."
homestead,3cnbow,superspeck,3,Thu Jul 9 13:04:44 2015 UTC,"Another factor is the age of the leach field. If the leach field is old, it won't drain well. Even in the American south on limestone and sand soils. ;)"
homestead,3cnbow,Emergency_Ward,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:55:37 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you! Neat fact about the sheep's foot :) in summer it's super dry with light, occasional rain but the ground is very hard everywhere. In winter it's frozen, and fall & spring are probably the most risky but I think standing water doesn't really happen in the field and it's not too mushy, plus I could just be extra mindful of rotating their grazing. Thank you for the suggestion, that is helpful!"
homestead,3cnbow,BillyDa59,5,Thu Jul 9 22:02:01 2015 UTC,"The issues is not pathogens, generally, but the compacting effect goat hooves have on your soil above the lines.  If they get too compacted, or defoliated, your septic will not function correctly, and the solution is expensive- digging the damn thing up. Maybe if you rotate through superfast and infrequently you'd be ok, but I would absolutely never count on the leach field for prolonged grazing."
homestead,3cnbow,seanthenry,2,Thu Jul 9 11:55:28 2015 UTC,Could you explain a little more why septic systems need vegetation over them?
homestead,3cnbow,Emergency_Ward,2,Thu Jul 9 14:02:26 2015 UTC,The leach field needs vegetation to aerate the soil prevent standing water and reduce erosion.
homestead,3cnbow,Oatroot,2,Thu Jul 9 15:10:20 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, which is amateur at best, the soil bacteria works to break down the ""effluent"", and the vegetation keeps the bacteria in high concentration and good working order."

homestead,3cnbow,nanofarm,2,Thu Jul 9 22:02:49 2015 UTC,Something to keep in mind in most states becoming a licensed dairy is a 100k-250k sort of investment even for a micro-dairy. I know a few who have looked into it and some who have gone through the entire process.   Newbies will do better with full sized goats not minis. Minis have more birthing issues and are harder to milk.   Most goat owners I know (including us) allow goats to graze over the septic field. It has the richest grass. As long as you have no standing water issues it's not a concern.
homestead,3cnbow,dirtbooksun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:54:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input! I've been doing a lot of research/classes/farm volunteering & interning and while there will be some major expenses, we're going as slow and DIY as we have to so I think based off of what I've learned we'll be a heck of a lot below the 100k mark. I hope to have a larger dairy in about 10 years and a microdairy in 2-3 while I grow my herd, build the facilities, and do the unavoidable revisions upon revisions to be compliant to regulatory standards!  In my defense I'm also not a total goat newbie, I've been volunteering with them for a few years and have my tiny herd of two LaMancha/Nigerian Dwarf Goat crosses from a great local Grade A raw milk dairy. I'll probably stick to purebred LaManchas and Nigerian Dwarf Goats after this because I'd like to be able to breed in greater consistency in traits, so my post would have been more accurate if I'd mentioned it would eventually be a small but mixed herd. I've got kids from a few great high-production, high-quality creameries lined up for next year so I can get the butterfat percentages and taste I'm looking for with helpful milkers and decent production! The biggest herd I can probably have on my lot is around 10 goats so it will REALLY be micro for the first few years.  Awesome to hear that you let your goats graze on the drain field grass. I'll go ahead and try it out with mine, too."
homestead,3cnbow,bigattichouse,2,Thu Jul 9 22:22:11 2015 UTC,"Goats are browsers, not grazers.  While nice grass is awesome, they would much prefer the brush.  Grass will cause parasite problems and dewormers can cause problems with with holding periods etc.  if it was me, I would plant blackberries or something over the leach field to provide browse and protect the soil from compaction."
homestead,3cnbow,epiphanette,2,Thu Jul 9 20:50:21 2015 UTC,"Sure, I understand that goats are browsers (mine are especially fond of the elm and pine branches I chop down for them! Also I am aware that pine can induce abortions in pregnant does). They do also love chomping the seed heads off the grass down there when I take them on a lead, and it's surrounded by a ring of trees they could munch on and dotted with brush and thicker weeds. I'm currently keeping them on a dirt dry lot which I can always use in rotation to help reduce the parasite loads.  Haha you must not be from the wet part of the US Pacific Northwest though, it's like a running joke how bad the blackberries are! I'm in the drier part now though so they're easier to control here. Thanks for your input!"
homestead,3cnbow,TheWiredWorld,2,Thu Jul 9 22:29:14 2015 UTC,"Blackberries are the reason why my parents got goats in the 70s so we know!  It is a common misconception I see when people are new to goats to think they need pasture so I wanted to speak up and hopefully ease your mind.  Goats will kill blackberries, no problem.  I lease out my dry does for this purpose and they do very well.  Because they are such an invasive weed and like the wet feet and fertility the leach field would provide they would basically be free fodder.  Even cheaper than planting pasture.  If they were allowed to establish in to a thicket over the pipes, that would protect against compaction.  That was my first thought, and I just threw it in for you to consider.  Another idea is locust, purple or black, coppiced.  I have a locust and blackberry thicket where my wash machine discharges.  All free plants from suckers.  Threw on some clover and alfalfa seeds, comfrey, goji in the shade etc.  no maintenance, no cost.  I Usually chuck in sunflower and Franken squash seeds as well, the goats love the gourd Seeds.   Edit to add that the pine thing is new to me, asked my mom and she hasn't hears of it either.  My goats eat lots of line and walnut as well and we haven't had any abortions.  Going on ten yrs now."
homestead,3cmgqk,Backyardmeat,2,Thu Jul 9 01:29:35 2015 UTC,"Nice process! I'm wondering though, how do you build a fire that's smokey and not hot so you don't pump heat into your cold smoker? Also, what's the desired end result of cold smoking? Is it just the addition of flavor, or does it dry and preserve the meat? Seems like 4 hours isn't a terribly long time to cure a large chunk of meat like that. Would a smaller smoker be more efficient at getting more smoke into the meat if it has less volume the smoke need to fill? Seems like yours has a lot of empty airspace inside."
homestead,3cmgqk,InformationHorder,3,Thu Jul 9 01:45:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I tamp down the stove so it just smolders and the smoke goes through 12 feet of duct. The heat rises along the way and the duct has no insulation qualities so the smoke enters the shed at 5-20 degrees warmer than the out side air (depending on the outside temp). The reason I cold smoke is so the bacon is so it's raw and will fry up and not be dried out. Also if you smoke it till it's done, it becomes way to smoky. It was cured for 5 days prior to the smoking process. I think on the size, it doesn't really matter, as long as you have air space all around the meat, and when it's going you can't even see the back wall the smoke is so thick. The only reason mine is this size, is that at times I will have up to 16 bellies and 40 hams going at once....thanks again for checking it out!"
homestead,3cmgqk,InformationHorder,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:07:01 2015 UTC,"Tamp down the stove? You mean, close up the air vents to choke the fire? I'm asking because I'm not good at fire. I can start one, but can't control one for the purpose of maintaining a specific temperature or smoke. (RIP every batch of pork ribs i tried to smoke on my BBQ) How does the curing process work? Soak it in brine?"
homestead,3cmgqk,ascii122,2,Sat Jul 11 13:40:49 2015 UTC,"Yes on the fire, get a good bed of coals add more wood and close off almost all the air. The cure is a dry rub that is a mix of sugar, brown sugar, salt and pink curing salt. Rub, wrap and flip over every day for 5 days"

homestead,3ckt91,quackerback,6,Wed Jul 8 18:10:27 2015 UTC,"From what I understand this technique is called ""gleying"". A layer of manure and other green waste plays host to anaerobic bacteria which ultimately produce a water proof seal."
homestead,3ckt91,the_arcatan,3,Wed Jul 8 20:21:40 2015 UTC,"Would you be able to use chicken manure instead of free ranging ducks?  If you already have chickens and are worried about the pond drying up before it gets a good seal, would saving up some chicken manure and ""seeding"" the pond also work with the ""gleying"" process?"
homestead,3ckt91,funke75,3,Wed Jul 8 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the chickens should be allowed access to the future pond site because of their propensity to dig and scratch. Their manure however should work.  From what I've seen online you'll need to hand pack it and then smother it with wet cardboard, leaves, or water. The key is to have a wet layer and keep it wet for the anaerobic process.   I can't verify it but I came across sheep being used to run the canals of Britain for this purpose. The impact of their hooves plus manure seems to have worked.    I'd recommend doing individual research on gleying. It's an old process."
homestead,3ckt91,the_arcatan,3,Wed Jul 8 22:23:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, I wouldn't want the chickens near the actual water, I was thinking more of scattering their droppings over the pond when I clean out there coop."
homestead,3ckt91,funke75,2,Wed Jul 8 23:57:27 2015 UTC,"You could cause a massive ammonium spike doing that. I don't know enough about ponds to tell you what would happen to the ecosystem but my initial mindset says not to risk it. Ammonium is a necessary component in a healthy system but at controllable levels by the bacteria and not in large dumps. You could theoretically crash the system  I think the staggered dispersal from the ducks would need to be simulated by ""shit sprinkling"". So maybe multiple times a day of small doses. Really, it sounds better for gleying, to get the initial layer going with large amounts of manure and then it should just take care of itself."
homestead,3ckt91,the_arcatan,2,Thu Jul 9 18:17:18 2015 UTC,So do you think putting out manure (caw patties?) in a currently dried out depression right before a raining season would be a good way to kick off the gleying process?  I'm just kind of hesitant to use ducks are they need constant standing water and I'd be afraid that what ever I get for a pond the first year may dry out before a layer builds up.
homestead,3ckt91,funke75,2,Thu Jul 9 19:38:38 2015 UTC,"I understand that the compost layer needs to be wet and stay wet preventing oxygen from infiltrating the system.  As for gleying I've never actually done this process, my experience is with self contained filterless freshwater tanks. So I use a very different method for keeping my water in, glass, but keep the biological systems running in much the same manner as ponds (live substrate, heavily planted, balanced biological load -aka fish).   Sorry I can't really be more help on the actual sealing method. There are resources online that deal with how to gley a pond.  *edit: replaced ""actually"" with ""actual"""

This gives a natural appearance and is far more robust than a traditional rubber liner, it is however expensive.  From what I understood of the article the author was using the clay without a liner which must surely be very difficult to get to work."

If it's a long term water storage for human or garden use then aren't you just going to end up storing a ton of unusable contaminated water? Or does it become safe to use after a while so long as you keep the animals out of it once it seals? I know regular ponds and surface water end up with a bunch of biological materials in it and are filterable and useable as anything, but anything that's primarily animal effluent of any kind can't be good, can it?"
homestead,3ckt91,lajaw,3,Thu Jul 9 01:33:53 2015 UTC,when you add fish and plants to your pond you get an excellent ecosystem and you can balance things out

There are also smaller skid steers that can get into areas too small for tractors. I'm sure things will still grow but not as well as if they had clear space for roots. What about making a plan to clear 1-2 feet a day. In three years it would be gone and you would get immediate benefit from the area you have cleared. Adding as much organic matter back into the ground during this time will also be of great benefit.

homestead,3cg0ro,umaijcp,6,Wed Jul 8 15:24:34 2015 UTC,"I had a somewhat similar situation, but in Japan so on a smaller scale. The yard was used for hanging laundry, so it had layers of gravel, sand, and pavers on top of some serious native clay (i could make bowls with this stuff.) I built a sieve about 2'x3' with 1/2 inch square mesh, and as I planted each area I just dug down to the clay and sifted the soil, moving the stone to a pile in the back. arranged it so the good soil was in the center, and sandy soil on one side, and the edges, where the fruit trees (and grape) were planned was mostly clay.  I pH tested each area and mostly was fine except the blueberry patch needed some help.   Potatoes do well in the sandy soil,  trees like the clay. For the vegetables, I used whatever was loamy and added whatever organic I could.   When I started, I was mostly worried about the clay, but the sandy soil is more of a hassle. It holds no water and to get anything to survive the hottest days I needed to add a lot of organic about a foot or so deep when planting. I got bags of dehydrated potting soil on closeout - it is like sawdust, but with fertilizer to replace the nitrogen the raw organic will consume. I also have a compost, a tight garbage bin with cut out bottom for vegetable composting, and I mulch everything with sawdust at the end of winter to keep adding organic.   It is working well, but the sifting sure was a lot of work."

homestead,3cg0ro,greeleyborn,6,Wed Jul 8 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"Quite honestly, if I were you, I would just build on top of it. Just start slamming the yard with mulch and composted cow manure. The asphalt shouldn't be a problem if it's that far down -- in fact, you might expose your yard to more hydrocarbon residue by trying to haul it out. And the concrete pieces, ironically enough, might actually raise your soil pH (a good thing in most places).  The trees are the only potential problem. It really depends on how degraded the asphalt layer is. Tree roots will ""find a way"" if there are gaps, but there has to be enough of them."
homestead,3cg0ro,nuttierthansquirrels,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:20:57 2015 UTC,"The hydrocarbon residue is a concern, but I think the asphalt itself is too degraded to stand up to tree roots,  once well established. Thanks for the response!"
homestead,3cg0ro,tubehand,3,Wed Jul 8 15:26:16 2015 UTC,"The hydrocarbon residue is a concern   This is why you need the mulch. The mulch will create the right environment for fungi. The mycelium of most fungi excrete enzymes that break down toxins including hydrocarbons into simple sugars that they and other microorganisms can use. They also break down the minerals in the rocks and sand to make them availible to plants.  So what you need is a combination of fungus and deep rooted plants. Edible weeds like dandelion, chickory and comfrey are great. Cereal grains like barley or rye are also great at this. They send their roots down deep and then, you chop off the plants and leave the roots down there. The fungus in the top layer of mulch moves down the now dead roots and excretes enzymes that break down the surrounding sand/rocks/asphalt and makes them bio-availible for it self and others. The result is that you get a lot of organic material injected down deep into the system that the next generation of plants can use."

I'll go through all my 250+ subscriptions and post them up and my opinion of them. The links I'll provide are going to be their Youtube Videos section, in order from most popular.  Ashden Awards A UK based foundation that is mainly helping 3rd world countries and communities with irrigation systems (Low cost treadle pumps) solar power, and biogas. An interesting channel with some great content from other countries. I'm subscribed to them, but don't follow them religiously. Although I might need to change that since they're still putting up videos.  Buckrun11. A prepper, homesteader, hunter/trapper, DIYer and shooter. Has a wide variety of videos from reloading (making bullets and shotgun cartridges) to gardening, having fun on the shooting range, to making things in his workshop/woodshop/forge. Not too many subscribers or views on his videos, but I can tell just looking at a few of them they are some good quality ones. I haven't seen all of his videos but I can probably tell he puts out some great content. He is still putting up regular content too.  QueticoChrist Not quite a homesteader but more of a DIYer. He makes some great woodworking videos, and most of his crafts are made by hand. Even made a foot powered lathe which everyone loved. I haven't seen all of his videos, but woodworking is an interest of mine, especially by hand. He is still putting up regular content too.  Farm Hand's Companion These videos go along with their blog but Its awesome to see the amount of work that's done. Most of the work is done by hand with little to no power tools. The videos are very well put together, even though they lack any dialogue. It's not very often they update, but when they do it's worth a watch.   The Fresh P She is the sister of the well known ""Homesteading"" youtuber ""Wranglerstar"" She has a lot of good videos on food and about food, as well as beekeeping. Still updates regularly, I personally haven't seen too much of her videos, but the variety looks nice.  Greenhorn Gardening A series I subbed to so I can look back on later. If I remember correctly, there is some great information in these vids, as well as fishing. Most vids are filmed in the POV take (Gopro on head). Haven't seen all of them but there's a good amount of content. He stopped uploading videos about a year ago though.  Green Power Science Exactly what the name suggests, mainly videos on solar power and how to use that combined with steam or heating/cooling. Interesting videos that is still updated every few weeks.  Jaimie Mantzel One of my favorite youtube vloggers, who I check every day for an update. He has a huge variety of videos, not quite How To, more like ""This is how I live, come watch!"" He built a off the grid geodesic dome in Vermont from the ground up that had 4 floors (Including one made from an old trampoline) Made a workshop from an old aircraft hangar he bought (and insulated it with free styrofoam boxes) as well as his Giant Robot Project he is mainly known for. He currently lives in Panama (I think) and made multiple boats by hand (SOLAR POWERED BOAT! )including a giant houseboat. He updates every few weeks and I can't wait to see more from him. He's the type of person whose videos I would want my young kids/newphews/family watching. A very inspirational guy who has done some fantastic things by himself.   My last and another one of my favorites is Way out West. A blow in Blog. It is an older couple who live in Ireland (Western coast?) who have a farm and upload videos, how to's, and a look into their little homestead. The husband is a professional beekeeper who has A book or two out on the way he beekeeps. They have lots of variety on their videos and its cool to see all the inventions/DIY projects the husband does in his workshop. They upload a couple times a month and their videos are well edited and are great on quality.  Then there's WranglerStar Which a lot of people know about. Now I still check what type of video he regularly uploads, but depending on the length and the title, determines whether I'd watch it. I'm not going to watch a 15 minute video on how to sharpen a chainsaw.  I kinda have a thing against Wranglerstar nowadays, when I first found him I really liked his videos and watched as many as I could, but I found that he can be quite preachy (either in lifestyle, opinions, or religion) and some of his video have the ""Clickbait"" titles or thumbnails (Coyote attack specifically). If you're already a youtube partner, I don't think you need to include clickbait titles in your videos. Some of his youtube series are too long and unnecessary (E.G. Build a treehouse) for the amount of things actually done in the videos. I do love how he is a volunteer Wilderness firefighter, and those videos shine a light on a not too well known lifestyle/job. However, when he uploads something like this where he helps remove a large fir tree from someones front yard. I just think this guy is an idiot who could have EASILY gotten himself killed or seriously hurt. I don't believe he was a professional who does that thing regularly, and they should have hired someone to do that job. Or, just removed more of the damn limbs from the top of the tree.  Sorry for wall of text, but I've been working on this for quite a few hours now. I do love a good youtube channel."

House and outbuildings were a disaster, lot of haphazard stuff that showed things were not getting done.  I could believe this if it was a 30 acre farm in full production, but it was about 1 acre of actual land in use.  Random stuff was just everywhere.  The rabbit workshop was terrible.  No real plan or useful information.  We then had to drive to another person's place to see an animal harvested.  (A retired couple owned the place and had larger gardens, more chickens and more horses than Jenna).  Even my wife stopped following the blog after going there.  She now knew what was really going on.  Jenna also mentioned that she had done a lot of swimming that summer and looked forward to spending the majority of the next day at the river.  With the amount of work that needed to be done, there should have been no swimming that summer.  In the end, she uses the blog so other people can support her dream of not working in an office.  She had a blog post about her truck being repossessed and I'm pretty sure her house was near foreclosure."

It is a large co-operative that serves our whole valley and has an outpost in every town in the area. There is no real big mystique to it. If you've ever been a member of a food co-op (like a hippie grocery store), it's similar to that: people buy in as members to a central organization that supplies their needs. Of course, smaller granges do exist in far-flung agricultural communities and I imagine they do the same thing, just on a smaller scale: warehouse feed and supplies and provide them at decent prices to their members."

homestead,3c538h,desert6flower66,14,Sat Jul 4 21:36:32 2015 UTC,"What does homesteading mean to you? To me, it's being energy, food, and water/ waste independant. You can achieve a measure of self-sufficiency regardless of where you are. There is plenty of advice out there for small grow operations for apartments, windowsill boxes and sprout cultivars and the like. Rainwater harvesting isnt very expensive. If you have a kitchen you can learn to can or otherwise preserve food. The formula is simple, make more money than you spend and try to make that money work for you. I've had a lot of mostly crappy or mediocre jobs, from mechanics assistant to being in the Navy to small business owner, but regardless of source or amount of income, that formula must remain the same. If it does not, you need to take a hard look at your budget and either find somewhere to cut or find a way to earn extra income outside of your primary source of employment. You can look up wwoof in your area, look into community gardens, see if anyone needs a hand at a farmers market, do whatever you're inclined to. Ive been saving and investing, generally, since I was 15, so about 13 years. But it's not necessary to save that long, homesteading wasn't really a goal for me until about 6 years ago. Depending upon property value (and how much it's inflated), 20% of principle down is generally rule of thumb for property loans. There are also a lot of small and organic farm subsidies and grants you can apply for, if you want to go that route. Also, remember, density often improves living efficiency, so the more people you can get on your bandwagon, the easier it will be on your wallet. While they weren't initially apart of my plan, most of my immediate family ended up moving in with me due to the economy at the time. The work is far easier with 6 adults tackling them, and, overall, overhead has decreased which is easier on everyone's wallet. As for choosing a property, I had a pretty long list of deciding factors, in no particular order: average annual rainfall above 30"", the plant hardiness zone was a factor, particularly avoiding extreme winters to extend growing seasons. I wanted to avoid counties that were worse than average for unemployment and government assistance, as well as counties at risk for tornadoes, floods and hurricanes. I took population density into consideration, as well the distance to mid-sized cities and other amenities like fire service and emergency medical services. Then the properties I found faced further scrutiny. Primary and secondary water sources were a concern, as well as its content. I had groundwater tested to avoid toxins. The zoning of the area is also important, as well as other bodies that make regulations like HOAs and Covenants. I wanted to avoid surrounding developmental land since they often change zoning as they expand. The soil was important, I had it tested for radon as well as content of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus content. Property, local, and county tax was also something I looked into. And finally, neighbors and local culture was a big concern. I wanted to be within biking distance of a smaller community center and fairly close to a large city with a decent economy that weathered the recession well. I wasn't particularly concerned about any structures, since I would have to heavily modify any existing house anyway. All in all, it took about 9 months, but I finally settled on 5 acres in East Texas for about $50,000. If you don't have such stringent requirements, you could probably find a better deal if you look. That was a deal at the time due to the Recession. It really depends on your other goals, as well. Homesteading isn't an all or nothing endeavor, everyone has their own particular flavor. Look around YouTube for inspiration, there are people doing amazing things in their backyards in the middle of suburbia."

homestead,3c538h,reddit-junkie,4,Sun Jul 5 13:51:50 2015 UTC,"The first part isn't particularly difficult once you have the criteria, all you have to do is look up national county maps for things like presidential and governor declared emergencies, annual rainfall, etc and overlay them. I can't recall exactly, but I ended up with counties is Georgia, S. Carolina, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico. There will be a few odd places, like Jackson county Florida and the like, but usually those are anomalies due to very low or non-existent populations. You should end up with around a hundred or so counties nationwide, from there it's just personal preference and how much money and time you're willing to spend. I chose mostly Colorado and Texas to focus on because the particular counties were a bit more progressive leaning than others. Just personal preference. Other than that, I can't recall anything more specific, I don't have my list of potential properties anymore."
homestead,3c538h,realeyes_realize_,20,Sun Jul 5 15:22:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, saving money comes down to two basic things: spend as little as possible, make as much as possible.    For the first one, question all of the things you spend money on and ask yourself it it's worth it.  Cellphone, car, Netflix, etc.  Are there alternatives?  Is the cost of whatever it is worth delaying your savings goals?  Is there anything you can do to reduce necessary costs like utilities, groceries or rent?  One resource I like to get a good perspective on stuff like this is Mr. Money Mustache.  Also, are you tracking your spending with a spreadsheet or Mint or something similar?  If you've never budgeted before, it's amazing how easily your money can slip away a little at a time....  On the other one, are you working the most effective job you could be? In other words, are you earning the most money you can for the least time and costs?  (Costs include commuting, tools, clothes, etc.)  Can you get a better job?  Can you supplement with part time work, selling stuff, freelancing, etc?    Most importantly, make a spreadsheet in Excel or Google Docs, and plot out your monthly spending and income with major budget categories like ""groceries"", ""utilities"", ""eating out"", ""shopping"", ""rent"", etc., and calculate your projected savings for each month.  You can also generalize for a ""typical monthly spending"" and then figure out how much you can save each month.  I like to do detailed spreadsheets for 3 years out, and a more general one for ten to twenty years out (since I don't have as much detail for my life plans that far out) to test different scenarios.   From there, pick an example piece of land, and then decide how much you need to save to buy that.  Personally I'd go for a minimum of a 20% down payment.  Then figure out how long it will take for you to save that, and make any changes to your life you need to in order to get there in a reasonable time frame.    And yeah...working on saving for years is tough, but worth it."

We lived in an uber cheap rented trailer ($550/mo) with no room for just the two of us, no insulation (so we burned a LOT of wood all winter) and the pipes froze constantly.  Very rarely ate out, and when we did it wasn't anything fancy.    Worked as much as we could, and kept saving.  Now that we own the land (completely vacant), we moved to a much more expensive place, but right by our land (so we put a LOT more work into it now), and with such amenities as a washer/dryer that allows us both to get more lucrative jobs that involve a lot more time away.

Cabarrus county is better, but the price of land is a bit high and the laws and taxes are going the way of Meck.  Union, Gaston, and Lincoln counties are all very cheap, low taxes, and favorable laws.  I live in Gaston county.  Bonus points if you can find unincorporated land.

Visit the county courthouse and get a list, research and when you choose one visit the county and buy it for taxes. The taxes usually have to be paid by you for 3 years but the catch is that if it is in an estate or similar situation and someone from the family wants it back they will be able to buy it back by repaying your money + 44% interest so at least you're only out time and not money. Might be worth checking in to if you are not in too big of a rush. If after 3 years no one else claims it and you have paid all taxes, its yours!"

How long that takes depends on how quickly they pick up steam and start selling more.  If you're looking for a good pasture pig that (supposedly) won't root up your entire pasture I think they're a fantastic investment regardless of whether the market drops or not.  Guinea hogs are supposed to be fantastic medium sized hogs and their prices aren't as outrageous but they do root.

I don't know if that is a good or bad thing when it comes to the butchering issue--  I'm farm raised, but new to Swine.  Do you know of any other full sized Heritage breeds that are known more for grazing and less rooting, that have a decent temperament for a first timer?"

They are super friendly, were really easy to train to our electric fence, and are great around our young kids.

homestead,3bzyqm,capnpirate,3,Fri Jul 3 14:57:57 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm a beginner in gardening myself so take my advice with a pinch of salt ;P   1) I guess it depends a lot on the used pesti- and herbicides to make a decision. Do you still have contact to the old landlord so you could ask him what he used?  2) I wouldn't toss the compost out to cure in winter, but that's just my personal opinion. How cold does it get where you live?  3) I would try to just mix the store-bought soil with your new compost :) I don't think it would be much use to recycle the (probably expensive) soil in the composter.  4) I don't think it should be an issue to pour the fermented liquids over the compost (I guess it would actually speed up the composting process), but I wouldn't pour it directly over the beds.  5) You can add ash to compost as far as I know, but I've heard that it shouldn't be too much. I would rather use the cuttings from the trees and bushes from your landlord for your compost compost than burn them and use the ash afterwards. I don't think most pesti- and herbicides would be rendered harmless by burning the cuttings, but here I might be wrong."
homestead,3bzyqm,florinchen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:26:29 2015 UTC,"Yep! I can ask the landlord when he last applied pesticide and wait 3 years from then to use in our compost. We're using nematodes to handle pests, now.  It gets pretty damn cold, mid Atlantic area, but rarely below 0.  Thanks a ton for the feedback! I really appreciate it!"
homestead,3bzyqm,spudmonkey,3,Sat Jul 4 01:30:33 2015 UTC,"I am not an expert by any stretch of the imagination so take this for what it is worth.  Pesticides and herbicides: This is hard to say and really depends on what was used on them. Both of these are usually surface applications which means that they should wash off the plants in short order.  I would guess a few months should be sufficient to wash them off.  However, because they can persist in the soil, the USDA requires a three year wait after last application of certain things before a farm can get certified as organic.  Also, in theory, all herbicides and pesticides sold in the US should break down in the environment.  Essentially, I would not worry about this point too much.  You MIGHT get some residual pesticides in your crops, but if you go buy them at the market you almost certainly WILL get some.  Compost and store bought: there is no need to re-compost your store bought soil.  Just slap your compost on top and work it in a bit.  Wood (and other vegetable) ash: Ash tends to be really alkaline (it has a lot of calcium carbonate and potash in it). Compost tends to be acidic, especially when the bacteria are really doing their thing. So a little bit added to the compost is probably beneficial.  If your soil is acidic you can even spread it on your yard (in moderation). My brother empties his BBQ pit ash in alternating areas of his yard, it messes things up for a year then seems to work into the soil and benefit his grass.   Fermented liquids: are slightly acidic but should not be any problem. Be warned though that the milk kefir liquid will still contain protein and fats which may get stinky. I really don't think it would be a problem in reasonable amounts (a quart here, a quart there).  Curing: If I finish a batch of compost during winter I just pitch it in the curing bin.  All curing really does is allow some additional breakdown to happen and normalize the pH a bit. Also different kinds of bacteria that were not living in the pile while it was hot will fix some nitrogen for you.  If you live somewhere where it gets stupid cold curing will take longer, but it will still happen. Remember, composting is really just letting things rot, which they will do with no help at all. We just help the process along a bit, you really can't mess it up too badly."

homestead,3bvgol,loveshercoffee,6,Thu Jul 2 14:05:50 2015 UTC,"Canning milk is not recommended.   The problem is that as a low-acid food with a pH of between 6.5 and 6.7, it would have to be pressure canned to eliminate the risk of botulism. Heating milk to 240 degrees F, changes it completely, denaturing the proteins, causing serious separation and leaving an undesirable taste and appearance.  Freezing, on the other hand, does work but causes the fats to separate slightly. If you shake it up, it's almost as good as fresh.  The best ways to preserve milk are to make cheeses and butter that can be stored for a long time.  Eggs too, can be frozen. Though if you have your own hens, the eggs will keep for weeks if kept cool, dark and dry without being washed."
homestead,3bvgol,croufa,5,Thu Jul 2 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I came here to say this. Anyone who doesn't pressure can low-acid food is asking for illness, and endangering others... also canned milk is gross.  Now, you could can sweetened condensed milk with enough sugar to make it safe. Freezing works well too. We had goats and would freeze bags of their milk. The flavor would be ""goatier"" after thawing, but not bad for cooking with, making cheese, or soap. One thing we'd make with the milk was panir. It's a type of cheese that has a high protein content and has the texture of chicken or harder tofu... good in Indian dishes and stirfry. Panir freezes pretty well too. Panir and ricotta are both ridiculously easy to make. We'd pull out a couple bags of milk to make fresh ricotta or panir on a regular basis... warm ricotta with basil and salt with some bread is so amazing.  Milk can also be cultured to make kefir... fermented milk. You still have to refrigerate it, but it will keep in the fridge for over a month. I like to buy the sweat, flavored kefir in the store... it's like drinkable yogurt.  The whole point of cheese was intended to be a stable form of milk that could be stored longer without refrigeration. Lots of cheese sits on shelves and ages with safe mold skins and waxes coating it. So I'm not sure why this person is trying to preserve cheese... should just buy small waxed wheels of cheese if they're concerned about refrigeration."

The whole milk seems to do better than low-fat and tastes almost as good a fresh to me.   Of course, I used to live on a cattle ranch and had access to REAL fresh milk, so as far as I'm concerned, all store-bought milk tastes a little funny.

Like for these oranges, I used a couple different recipes I found on various blogs, and I used a combo of the two to make my syrup and stuff, but carried on with canning procedure as outlined in my booklet. That's ok right?   Like for the tomatoes, I'm planning on canning them peeled and halved with citric acid.

homestead,3bt28e,BeamTeam,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:10:57 2015 UTC,"Dometic (who I believe bought Servel many years ago) still makes stand alone propane fridges for off-grid situations. Like you said, they also make propane/electric fridges for RV's. I've used one of their stand alone models (model # RGE-400 or 800 i believe) and it works great. It's seen daily use since bought it new about 3 years ago.  I have no experience with a fridge that old, but I have used a couple old Dometics from the '70s, and my understanding is that as long as they're working, they're safe. You want to make sure it's not leaking propane, but that's a pretty easy thing to smell for. If it's working then it still has all the ammonia in it that actually does the cooling.   Servels were supposed to be excellent fridges, and that thing looks like it was built like a tank! Be careful attaching the propane line, because you can over-torque the male fitting and crimp the line going in to the fridge."

Mrs. Wranglerstar loves a tool called a Japanese Hori Hori Garden Landscaping Digging Tool With Stainless Steel Blade & Sheath. You can locate it on their webstore or amazon.  Another thing to consider is how are you growing these. Are you growing direct sew into the ground or are you growing in a raised bed. I would imagine if you have raised beds 3' high you could pull Dikon radish out pretty easy.

Daikon radishes are easier to pull than horseradish or the doragi, which have large splits and branches.   Doragi root looks a bit like ginseng.    I have some raised beds and some sown directly to the topsoil.   I have more trouble with the latter but even the beds give me trouble, in part due to the depth of the root and the density of the plants (bellflowers are spreading perennials and you harvest off the side usually, unless you want the whole bed)."

I decided to expand a bit and bring some to the farmers market. I was amazed at how much my local community was excited and embraced my hobby.   Organic soaps are pretty pricey here in Hawaii. They can run  $8 and up bar at a health food store.   They are organic coconut oil base melt and pour soaps with micah colorants and locally made essential oils.   I have teamed up with a goat farm to trade soaps for organic milk to add to some of my soaps. I also trade with a woman growing organic vanilla bean orchids for her extracts. The sustainably harvested Hawaiian sandalwood comes from a friends farm. He gathers fallen old branches and carves canes out of them. He saves me some of the shavings for the soaps.   Surprisingly in just a few months I am now selling my soaps in a local art gallery, massage studios, a yoga shop, a salon and a gift store. Those aside from my weekly farmers market booth have all helped me create a nice side business.

That's how I got started initially. Then I made a few batches and got hooked. From there I started buying a few fancier soap molds online.   But anything made of moderately hard silicone will work just fine. The more depth to the mold, the longer it needs to dry and cure. The silicone cupcake molds take approx 4 hours to properly cure.   The basic supplies I started out with were:   Silicone mold, a 1 quart glass Pyrex measuring/pouring container to melt the soap in, plastic wrap, and if you can find one I highly recommend a hand powered mixer/whisker like this   http://i.imgur.com/VGf0cvt.png  I found this at a chef supply store for $6. But it really helps mix the soap, essential oils and colorants evenly. You push down on the handle and the whisker spins.   The only other tool you'll need is a spray bottle with rubbing alcohol. That gets spritzed on the top of the soap once it's poured into the mold to eliminate air bubbles."

LOL  http://imgur.com/U4sf60K  I used 1/4 cup coconut oil to 1 pound of the base, then added vanilla fragrance, brown sugar, and oats. The vanilla smells a little off, and it started to harden while I was pouring it, so the shape isn't smooth and perfect, but I'm going to use it for myself anyway!  Thanks for sharing this with us!

homestead,3bovmd,TheHenwife,2,Wed Jul 1 03:47:35 2015 UTC,I have yet to make my own molds. I'd love to learn. Have you done this type of carving before? Perhaps you might have a resource on learning or a video related? I'd be most greatful.   I do order specific molds that fit with a Hawaii type theme or are a good match for floral scents. Primarily silicone molds.   I get a lot of feed back from folks that are using these for decorations as they don't want to use them. But once they do use the soaps they are hooked and come back for more or even call me to ship them some if they were on vacation and purchased them.

I was just playing around, really, because it was my mother in law who was doing the serious soap making while I was messing up her hard work with a knife.  I don't know if this is helpful or even relevant, but you might do well to expand into lotion bars. Compared to soap, they are super simple, just a coconut oil base with fragrances, really. You could probably get away with using your same silicone molds, although the more three-dimensional ones might break off.  Whatever you do, I hope you're successful. Although it looks like you will be no matter what I think :)"
homestead,3bovmd,FoodFarmer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:07:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for that info. Out of curiosity were the molds carved out of wood and then cast in silicone? Or like a wax cast for jewelry?   I'm curious as my SO carves wood and seashells and I have been thinking about how I might make soap molds out of these.   I will certainly look into lotion bars. Sounds similar to what I'm doing currently.   I'd like to get an oil extracting machine to start harvesting macadamia nut and avocado oils from our farm and incorporating those as well.

homestead,3bpe6p,frugalNOTcheap,4,Wed Jul 1 02:11:14 2015 UTC,"I teach people and dogs to herd livestock.   Are border collies really the best at it?   In most subs I put this more tactfully towards the upright breeds, but to be blunt, yes, border collies are the best at it -- provided it's a border collie from working stockdog lines, and not show dog or pet lines. Upright breeds like your german shepherds and cattle dogs absolutely CAN do it, they're just harder to train and it's harder to find working lines. German Shepherds can be cool, but they're either very good (thoughtful and protective toward the stock) or very bad (trying to kill one and eat it and confused about what your problem is with that).   So does it come natural for the dogs or does it take a lot of training?    The answer is yes. Lol.   Dogs already have every tool they'll ever use to herd, but it takes a lot of training to get them to learn how to apply those tools reliably. Some dogs are more ""natural"" than others, and those dogs are faster and easier to train. What the other commenters are referring to with ""it had no training but would go gather the stock"" is a natural instinct where the dog goes around the stock opposite (balance) to the handler and just has a good ""feel"" for that. However if you can't actually direct your dog when and how to do that, you're gonna have a bad time.  What you need most in any working dog is ""drive,"" which is how much the dog wants to do it. You can't make them want it. You learn the fetch (bring the stock to the handler) first, and later, the drive (push the stock away from the hander).   Herding has relatively few commands: Stop (lie down), flank counter-clockwise around the stock (away to me), clockwise (come by), walk up, and ""quit what you're doing and come to me"" (that'll do). However, it's one of those things that takes a minute to learn and a lifetime to master. You cannot expect to jump in with an inexperienced dog and just herd regardless of what nice balance you may have seen from ""untrained"" dogs; it won't go well and you will have a frustrated handler, confused dog, and stressed out stock.  A note about goats:  Goats are more challenging to herd than are sheep and cattle. They do a lot more staring back at a dog, which can be disconcerting to the dog, which expects that the stock will move when the dog makes eye contact. They also think vertically as well as horizontally, so you need a dog which can cope with what to do when the goats jump up on picnic tables, boulders, feeders, cows, horses, passers by. Goats also split up more than sheep do, and they challenge dogs more (not moving, putting their heads down, sometimes butting). You need a very strong, confident, smart, ballsy dog to work goats. You should never put a puppy or inexperienced dog on goats, unless said goats are ""dog broke"" (very used to being worked by dogs, and chill about it).   But I really want to use a dog to herd goats.  Dogs are great tools for herding! They can get stock off terrain where people, horses, and ATVs can't, which is the chief reason (historically and in modern times) for using them. But it will be very time consuming to train one up yourself. You can always get a dog which is already fully or partially trained, too, but it will cost more and you still have to account for some practice time while you the handler figure stuff out.  Edited to add: Border collies are totally useless for protecting your homestead, by the way. My BCs, while hard-hitting sonsabitches at work, are kind of like ""Ummm there's a noise out there, you should go check it out."" Upright breeds like cattle dogs, shepherds, even Aussies, have a lot more protection bred in. You sacrifice strict herding ethic in those dogs for a more general ""farm dog"" which is going to keep an eye on things and bark at strangers as well as move stock. If you can't get a separate dog for protection and work and need an all-in-one, I'd probably go working cattle dog."
homestead,3bpe6p,obsessedwithmydog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:19:59 2015 UTC,Oh wow you have been very helpful. I think a herding dog may not be for me as Im leaning towards goats. Right now I only have 2 and my fiancee and I can herd them but I would like to ramp up our herd over the years.
homestead,3bpe6p,obsessedwithmydog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:50:14 2015 UTC,"Obviously, I love herding, and working dogs. :) I wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from getting their feet wet in it. But it's definitely something to approach with long-term goals in mind, and requires its own 'over the years' training related to but separate from learning general herd care and stockmanship. Since you don't need to herd a ton of goats right away, you can always seek out a local herding instructor in your area and ask to watch some lessons or events to see if it's something you might like to add to your life.  Either way, good luck, and happy goat-tending!"
homestead,3bpe6p,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:32:59 2015 UTC,"Do you think a young cattle dog would work with goats?  We've had cattle dogs, never herding, but they've always been very confident and assertive dogs even as puppies. It depends on the puppy of course, but I've definitely had some who were confident and sassy young.   But you're right, finding one with herding instincts is hard. They're  kept much more as pets."
homestead,3bpe6p,obsessedwithmydog,2,Thu Jul 2 04:51:54 2015 UTC,"I would never put a young or inexperienced dog of any breed on any stock that isn't dog broke. If a dog's early herding experiences teach it ""these things will fight you"" then you run the risk of creating a dog that is shy, quits, or otherwise takes one look at the angry stomping goat and wants to peace out. Beginner dogs also can't ""catch"" (gather) wild stock running all over the place, which causes the dog stress and frustration, not to mention upsets the stock. Cattle dogs are tough little shits but it's too much to ask of a pup and isn't best practice for success.   The biggest problem I have training cattle dogs is that they pair their smarts with extreme stubbornness, so it can be tricky to get through to them. Like you're trying to teach them to flank around the stock and the ACD just stands there refusing to budge like ""nope, if I can't run straight at them, I WON'T MOVE AT ALL."" I have seen some trained up nice that work beautifully though, and that's always a pleasure."
homestead,3bpe6p,Epona142,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:56:32 2015 UTC,"Cool! Nice to see an experienced trainer on here. I'll have to tag you. I have been working dogs my entire life, but am learning as I go when it comes to herding training.   Not doing too bad either - our border collie is doing really well on goats, especially at finding them, rounding them up, and bringing them back to me. (We graze/browse them on about fifty acres between milkings)  Working on closer work and becoming more reliable - having lots of fun. Everything you describe about goats is on point. They are tough on dogs! I am also currently working a trio of new Livestock Guardian pups, but boy are they easy, their instincts are installed right on point :)  Anyways, enough jabbering lol. I'm the local goat expert who hangs out on /r/goats so I can be verbose about stock and working them."
homestead,3bpe6p,obsessedwithmydog,2,Tue Jul 7 00:55:50 2015 UTC,"Good job! Props to your BC, rounding up those wily goats! Close work (like in and out of sort pens or other small areas) is all about calm stock and handler supervision until the dog gets it. Reliability is all practice, practice practice, as I'm sure you've figured out already, lol. If you have 50 acres and a lot of your work is ""go find them and bring them,"" you should consider putting the dog on whistles if he/she isn't already! It'll save your voice on windy days!  I adore goats. I wanted dairy goats for ages, and then became allergic to milk. Sob sob. :( Goat milk is better on me than cow's milk but still creates problems. I'm still considering getting some goats for brush clearing. The sheep do okay but goats are better."

We have a second dog that is much better with closer work, but gets far too mouthy and needs to be reminded. He looks like a Border Collie in a German Shepherd Dog body, odd fellow but a good dog.  Yup, most of the time I just point out and say ""Go find 'em!"" then it's ""Take 'em home!"" and it's great. We've only just now started to work on direction, and of course, that close work.  I actually detest milk, it smells awful, tastes worst, and upsets up stomach. But LOVE soap and cheese, and we make cheese here.   And of course, I love the goats themselves above all. :)"

homestead,3bpe6p,Robert__Loblaw,3,Tue Jul 7 16:24:19 2015 UTC,"I've seen a border collie do it pretty much naturally.  I dont really have much experience other than him.  He had no training but would just kind of see what you were trying to do with the animals and help.  He'd put horses, cattle, and alpacas into pens when he saw that you were trying to herd them."
homestead,3bpe6p,DreamArcher,2,Wed Jul 1 03:39:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The question should be, ""how to get them to stop herding?"" They've even been know to herd children. Although I'm not sure you want your kids nipped so I wouldn't try it."
homestead,3bpe6p,CochinBrahmaLover,2,Wed Jul 1 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"We had a cattle dog when I was younger. She definitely tried to herd me, and had we had livestock I'm sure would've herded them. But we didn't get our first livestock until she was 2-3 and it was only chickens, so I we sort of trained it out of her."
homestead,3bpe6p,BDA_shortie,3,Thu Jul 2 04:46:14 2015 UTC,"My in-laws used to raise border collies. By the time they were ready to leave their momma, they knew how to herd. Their parents taught them pretty well. They sold for a little over $100.   Definitely go with a rancher that raises dogs for herding. Personally, I love border collies as ranch dogs. But several other breeds work well. It depends on what your needs are and the space you have."
homestead,3bpe6p,ascii122,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:25:01 2015 UTC,I have around 13 acres for the dogs to roam. Call me paranoid but I wouldnt mind having a collie and a German shepherd. Id like the shepherd for security reasons. I live in a low crime area but I don't want to be that 0.0001% that gets targeted by a serial killer.
homestead,3bpe6p,ascii122,3,Wed Jul 1 13:01:52 2015 UTC,great answers.  My experience with goats is that they don't take well to being herded.  Growing up we had around 20 goats that were 'free range' and moved them around a lot.  One female would typically be the 'lead goat' and the rest would follow her.  So the trick is to figure out which is the lead goat and then train her to do what you want.  Goats are plenty smart and can even respond to whistles.  Some of our neighbors use goats to help manage sheep -- also a goat can kick a coyotes arse if needed and they'll move a flock to higher ground during storms etc (sheep being so stupid).  So I dono about using the dog to move the goats.. it's more likely the goat will kick the dog :)  edit: this does not apply to herds with males among them.  Billy goats change the whole equation
homestead,3bpe6p,CochinBrahmaLover,2,Wed Jul 1 19:04:16 2015 UTC,I think Ill just keep moving the goats myself. Right now Im at 2 but one day I could see myself with 30-50. But with two my fiancee and I can herd them pretty well. Or I can move them with treats. I just thought if I had more this would get to be too much for humans.
homestead,3bpe6p,ascii122,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:06:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you could do it with dogs.  But as you may have observed, goats have a certain personality :)  They don't act like cattle or sheep -- this is why they are so resistant to predators.  A small dog can run a sheep till it drops dead, while a goat will just look at it like it's nuts and stomp it.  Our best lead goat was amazing -- you could clang a pan and she'd bring the herd in from who knows where and get them in the pen for milking.  She even learned how to open gates (which was a problem).  Goats are cool."
homestead,3bpe6p,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:19:16 2015 UTC,Maybe I should get sheep. I hear they're better at clearing brush anyways
homestead,3bpe6p,ascii122,2,Wed Jul 1 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"No. Goats are better with brush. All of our sheep have eaten brush,but nothing compared to the goats. The goats run by and grab mouthfuls of everything, whereas the sheep would nibble on things and opt for the grasses."
homestead,3bpe6p,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:55:33 2015 UTC,"yeah .. sheep are not good for land clearing.  A goat can eat pretty much anything (and will so watch out).  I don't know who told you this but maybe they were selling sheep.  Also mature goat is much better eating than mature sheep.. lamb is great, but if you are going full cycle an old goat makes a much better meal than an old mutton sheep :)"

Tip 1) Long-term, I would recommend slowing building raised beds to better firm up the planting area and to better control for weeds and needed nutrients.    Tip 2) If you haven't started one yet, I would build a simple compost bin.  Shoot even just letting your yard waste build up in a corner and slowly break down would help amend your soil."

The hoops are just pvc conduit, the beds are 16x2x1. The biggest expense I remember was the plastic. You have to use greenhouse plastic or the sun will ruin it in a year. It was 70$  I also used a product called wiggle wire that made installation really simple. To keep the plastic from tearing I used cut up tire tubes from small airplanes on all the corners.

I've been looking into a few books such as this one and this one as well  An area to live isn't so much good or bad, but what you make of it. Id you want cheap property. I would look into the less densely populated states and check if they have jobs which you meet the qualifications for within that area and go from there. Look into csa farms also  Also, i know you're not asking for help on this particularly thing, but look into holistic alternative medicine. There's a reason why it's stuck around so long and i can honestly tell you from experience that it helps A LOT.  Anyway op, i hope this helps you out in your journey. You already have an idea, now its9 time to hatch out a plan :) good luck!"
homestead,3bka2l,Expectationslowered,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:45:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your reply and hopeful attitude. I will for sure check out those books.    My wife has had lyme disease for around 10 years now and it's been pretty painful for our entire family. We have cut down fast food to once a week (that was a big change) and we've been eating more fruits/veg/gmo free stuff. But we still have a lot of processed food we need to cut out. I will learn more about holistic alternative medicine, but I'm having a lot of problems figuring out truth vs. fake.  I know attempting homesteading is hard work, but I fully believe the twice a week trips to the grocery store and target/walmart are actually more expensive and harder then the work involved with unplugging. Plus it's not sustainable. Spending $500 a week on food and household crap is just crazy and it's only going up and up. Even with a ~150k salary. I would rather make less and spend less and do more for ourselves. As it is now,  I am working to work and not really living, and my wife is getting pulled down by the toxic society we are stuck in."
homestead,3bka2l,Expectationslowered,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:46:20 2015 UTC,"I agree so much with your sentiments op.    The people that I've gotten medicinal help from sell this. they used to have a seller locater (still might) to find someone close to your area. The seller is responsible for distributing the medicine according to your symptoms and according to how they have learned properly treat a patient. The medicine can be a bit pricey, but it worked for me and others i know. Only my experience, but if anyone else knows of any other sources, please chime into the convo  Keeping a clean diet is hard work op. I try to keep simple rules : no foods with white sugars and artificial dyes (or anything artificial for that matter). Once you eliminate those, it becomes fairly easy to adjust to the rest.  Biggest thing is that when you cook your own food, you know exactly what goes in it. Try simple things like pastas and homemade asian food with lots of veggies. Have a basket of fruit around for the kids to snack on. Also, get your kids involved if you can, they really love it. They learn actual life skills, use their brain, get creative and it's always nice having extra helping hands.  Stay positive op, wish you and your family the best!"

Recently we started a container garden and started everything from seed which was very rewarding just started to get some eggplant, cucumbers, tomatos showing fruit.    Going on Landwatch and landandfarm are good ways to prospecting new places.  Finding out what the price range is, for us we have a better understanding of our expectations and also our budget/needs.  Learning the skills slowly is a way to figure out what you want, and knowing what you want to grow and how to grow it helps you decide on the space and climate you need/want to move to.  Our kids are still young so we have a few years to save up and get them a little older so they can help and be independent.

Deet and Picaridin are also effective repellents.  EDIT: Permethrin is very toxic to non-mammalian species (Insects, fish, reptiles and amphibians particularly) and cats.  In humans & dogs it breaks down fairly quickly and it has a very low skin absorption rate. It's used in many cheap flea & tick products for dogs and spreads via the skin oils.  If you soak a pair of pants and a long sleeve shirt in it, let it dry, and wash it the toxicity for you is very low but it will stop ticks and mosquitoes in their tracks. I would not apply it wet to your skin.  The military treats lots of standard issue clothes with permethrin to protect the troops from insect carried diseases.  They've been treating pretty much every battle uniform for the last 2-3 years, and have been using it on at least some of them for 20+ years."

homestead,3betc8,weeniewater,3,Sun Jun 28 15:59:05 2015 UTC,"I live in zone 5 with apples, pears, sour cherries, and paw paws. I just planted a new Montmorecy cherry this spring that is already putting on new growth. I got it from Raintree Nursery. I've had problems with cedar/apple rust in the past which the local extension office helped me diagnose. I searched online for a variety of apple that was not as susceptible. No problems with the pears. I don't like the gritty texture of Barlett, so I went with Warren and Ubileen. When choosing varieties, consider which need to pollinated by another variety, when they bloom, when they are ready for harvest, what diseases/pests they are susceptible to, and what plant climate zone it grows in. Consider what you plan to do with the fruit. If you want to make applesauce, pick a soft apple. If you want to store over winter, pick a variety that will last longer. Some fruit bruises easily and doesn't store as well. I bake pies so I went with sour cherries.   Beware of cherries around herbivores. The leaves and bark have been known to make them sick or miscarry. Do some research on this if you plan to have goats, sheep, cows, horses, etc.   I don't prune my trees. I plant flowering bulbs underneath like iris and daffodils. This prevents the grass from growing near the trees. Grass competes heavily with trees especially in the first few years. Also in the first year or two, you want to pick off the blooms so it won't set fruit. You want the energy to go into root development instead. It may take four or five years to see the first fruit. During harvest, let chickens or pigs eat any fallen fruit. This prevents mice or other vermin from taking up residence and destroys on any worms, insects, pests that would produce a life cycle.    You can get trees in different heights based on the root stock. Consider the space you have and how you want to harvest to pick between standard size, semi-dwarf, or dwarf. You can also get multiple varieties grafted onto one plant. This branch produces one kind of fruit while the other branch produces a different variety or different kind of fruit all together. These will cost more. Will it produce enough to meet your needs?   The local extension office can also test your soil for pH and nutrients. You may need to adjust your soil before you plant by adding lime or some kinds of fertilizers. It's much easier to adjust your soil  before you plant rather than after.   If you want peaches, plant on the south side of your house where it will get more sun/heat. If you had a stone wall, that would be even better. The sun would warm the wall which would radiate the heat to the tree. Create a micro-climate for your peach.   Good luck!"

homestead,3betc8,ThisNerdyGuy,2,Sun Jun 28 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"Your state university will have an extension service that will have volumes of easy-to-read information for you that is specific to your area....as in your climate, your soils, your area's specific pests.  This is where I go first and foremost.  Second, your county will have an extension agent that can provide (usually) in the field expertise on what something is or what is causing it, etc.  I dont bug mine all the time BUT....if I happen to run across him then I dont mind hitting him up with a question, it is his job.  The advice I would give you about how my cherries (not so hot), peaches ( fantastic) and pears (fantastic) are doing here in W. Texas would be of little value because its like a different world....a hot dry its amazing anything can live here kind of world :P  In general though I would recommend NOT planting a tree you did not know the size of (which is determined by the rootstock)...unless you like surprises that can be expensive to correct or just living with whatever.  (Honestly its not hard to have to ""suffer"" through a tree that literally tries to feed you with fruit whatever you end up with)  Secondly, Fruit trees require a certain number of chilling hours or they wont bear fruit, may not go dormant at the right time, etc.  Consult your local extension service, or a knowledgeably nursery, or maybe you have a neighbor that has a fruit tree and knows what variety it is, in order to determine what variety of what trees you should aim for.  I wouldnt plant a variety and just leave it to the lottery to decide if I planted on that is going to meet its chill requirements.  Last, Some varieties require pollinators, some do not.  Again, this is good to know BEFORE you plant.  Ive had good luck with both local and online nurseries.  For online: I got some excellent cherry trees from Burgess.  I got some excellent peach and plum trees from Stark  Brothers.  I got some pretty good (but stupid cheap) plum trees from SummerStone (others have not been so lucky).  Dave's garden has a pretty comprehensive user-submitted review of different places.  Summerstone in particular seems to have a bad rep but in just my experience, everything I got was alive and was cheap as hell.  I got two peach trees from Walmart that were on sale and have already made excellent peaches even though they are only 2 years old (to me, I have no idea how long they had them).  NOW, I have no idea if they are semi-dwarf or standard and I know nothing of their rootstock or even what variety they are.  I dont really recommend this but to be honest it worked quite well for me.  I think... in general....the nurseries that are propagating these trees arent propagating shitty trees so if you find a tree then its probably a good tree.  And in general, any tree is better than no tree and the only better time than to plant a tree besides today was yesterday.  tldr, its hard to go wrong planting a fruit tree.  Sure, a little preparation can help alleviate most problems but dont let ""perfect"" deprive you of your fruit."
homestead,3betc8,CaptSnap,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:24:52 2015 UTC,My cherries are doing well. Still haven't produced but they're still young. Healthy and shooting up well. I need to prune them and take some greenwood cuttings for propagation before the shoots harden off though.   I don't have pears but my neighbor has a mature tree. It's doing fine aside from the squirrels who destroy the crop before it's harvestable.   If you want a great book on raising fruit trees in cold climates you might want to take a look at The Holistic Orchard. It's a wealth of information from a grower in New Hampshire (5b).   As far as nursery stock goes I hear nothing but good things about Oikos tree crops. I'm in Canada so it's too expensive to buy from them because of biocertification costs but they're very well regarded and from your bioregion.

They seem to be doing OK so far but it hasn't been very long.    Most of my research has piggybacked on the literature available for apples.  Preparing the soil (pH adjustment, fertilizer application, tilling etc) and selecting the proper rootstocks has been the first step.  The varieties I am interested in are perry pears, and there isn't much information available on those....but I'm in the pacific NW so pretty much everything will grow in this climate.    My general advice is to choose different fruit.  Apples varieties and rootstocks for cold weather are pretty well documented.  Pears and peaches in particular are finicky about climate.    Stick to apples, there is quite a bit of diversity there and you will probably have more success with disease resistance and overall productivity."
homestead,3betc8,LuckyPoire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:22:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I plan on doing apples as well. There's just so much info on apples and so many people growing apples in Wisconsin that I figured I would just figure that stuff out later. I also know that pears and cherries work out well in my region of the state.  The peaches are where info drops off. No one is really doing it commercially. I'm sure there's a reason why, but I've been seen some varieties that claim to be hardy to up to zone 3 so I thought I'd give it a try."
homestead,3betc8,LuckyPoire,2,Mon Jun 29 13:11:19 2015 UTC,"You obviously like a challenge.  Good Luck.   With regard to pears - Almost everything you learn about apples can be applied there.  Except that pears need a bit more sun, are more susceptible to frost damage in the spring, and a full range of dwarfing rootstocks are not available (avoid the quince and go with the fire blight resistant OHxF series instead).  On the plus side pears don't mind being in wet soil as long as there is good air drainage.  Edit:  This is the nursery I use.  http://www.raintreenursery.com/  They are really good.  Download their catalog or go to the ""Growing Info"" link which contains good information on pollination compatibility, rootstocks, harvest information and recommendation for your region.  They ship all over the country too, I've bough about 300 trees from them so far and things are going well."

I got them from Starkbros, although they have mixed reviews they are working out ok for me. They let you sort by zone, so you can see which would do well in colder weather.  I planted my apples the most north and the peach the most south so hopefully they will block each other.   Everything I've read suggests to plant when they are dormant, so fall or early spring. What is nice about fall planting is it means they will produce sooner."

Right now my horses are actually boarded at a nice facility, so I'm talking about past and future right now. I usually use an open, relatively flat field for my dressage work (lining the corners with poles so I have a dressage ring — you don't need a true fence for dressage since that's not what you show in and the horse can just step over it; you just need a guideline so you're straight; letters also needed). I know a grand prix rider who's home dressage arena is just a step above what I school in. She's doing one tempis down the centerline and canter pirouettes on mostly grass. When I haul to a trainer's, I get to work in an actual arena with mirrors and such. My horses don't notice the difference (well one of them doesn't, the other really thinks she's a sexy beast and spends a lot of time nickering to her reflection)  Make sure it's high and well-draining, and that the footing is even. That's all you really need imo. And of course, if you want to get fancy about it, you can. But like the saying ""most riders need $20,000 in lessons on a $5,000 horse, not $5,000 in lessons on $20,000 horse,"" most riders can deal with a cheap arena and apply the money for hauling into their trainers :)  But again, I'm an eventer and I've only showed up to first level in dressage, and I know there are some dressage riders who are VERY finicky about footing and wouldn't dream of letting precious poopykins step hoof on anything other than the perfectly manufactured arena with 6 feet of improvements."

Try to keep the ground dry in there and replace the hay if it gets wet. Don't put the shed in a fishbowl on the pasture. You can even use a trees as a basis for a shed. A hoof pick to make sure rocks and mud aren't stuck in there is good. They are a few bucks on Amazon.  Look up the ratio for his size but some food grade Diatemaceous Earth mixed in a little feed can keep the parasites and worms stay away. It's super cheap at a buck a pound and avalaible on Amazon.   Some folks might tell you he needs the same access to care as a champion show horse but donkeys are normally pretty sturdy as long as their pasture is healthy.

But if you take five minutes to try and teach them what you want with a treat, they'll grasp it instantly and your life will be 100x easier. Always bribe & reward, never punish.  Has been said in here but they need proper farrier care. This is one area where you'll want to teach them to pick up their feet nicely. Nothing worse than trying to fight a stubborn donk to trim its feet. Lots of them get neglected for that very reason. They'll need a trim about every other month, often a little less often in the winter. If you have a rocky pasture and the donk moves around a lot, they might do a bit of self-trimming. If your pasture is soft & muddy, they'll need to be trimmed more often. If you can keep them moving by putting out various hay nets in different areas instead of one feeder, and even put in some pea gravel or rocks to vary the ground a bit, all the better.  They also get bit the fuck up with flies. Make sure you fly spray.  Make sure the fence is safe & solid - holes and barbed wire are inviting an escape or a maimed animal. Get them a buddy. They are not solitary animals. Have the vet out at least twice a year unless/until you feel really well equipped to handle things yourself.

homestead,3bamf7,urbn,12,Sat Jun 27 22:32:20 2015 UTC,"I work on my property with poison oak all the time and have had some really bad rashes before.  The best way I've found to clean off exposure as well as treat a rash is Fels Naptha (99 cents in the laundry isle).  After working out side wash your hands, face, etc with it.  Grate up some and add it to the washing machine to wash your clothes.  if you start to get a rash, lather some on the spot and let it dry.  It pulls the oil out of your skin and stops the rash from getting worse or spreading.  Also since it dries your skin out, it keeps it from itching.  Every person reacts to poison oak/ivy differently, but Fels seems to work great for a lot of people... it's actually what the boy scouts use too."
homestead,3bamf7,drink_or_die,5,Sat Jun 27 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yup.  That shit is nasty.  That's me after a multi-day backpacking trip.  My eyes swelled shut because I removed my contact lenses at night and replaced them in the morning without thoroughly washing my hands.  I did wash my hands in the stream, just not nearly well enough to remove all the urushiol.  That was the most miserable I've been in my entire life - rash covered 90% of my body and the steroids (topical cream as well as pills) my doctor prescribed did zilch.  Since then, I've been more careful about washing and the few minor reactions I've had have been isolated to my hips.  I suspect this is due to the way I pull my pants down to go to the bathroom - there was still residual urushiol under my thumbnails and it was transferred to my hips."
homestead,3bamf7,mydoingthisright,5,Sat Jun 27 15:06:17 2015 UTC,"Ouch!  That is my nightmare, getting it in my eyes or breathing it in.  I talked to an ER nurse around here and there are a large number of people every year that breathe in smoke from burn piles.  They end up in the ER with IVs and steroids.  Anytime I burn brush piles now, I carry a full faced chemical/gas mask I got at a military surplus store that I can throw on if the wind shifts.  IMO poison oak is worse than ivy/sumac because it takes many different shapes/forms depending on if it's growing in the sun or up a tree  or in the shade, etc.  It is not an easy plant to identify unless you've spent a lot of time around it.  If you can still get small rashes and not break out into huge blisters/boils then that is a good sign that you really aren't super sensitive at least.    I always carry a bar of Fels Naptha when I go backpacking.  I can spot poison oak about 25 yards away now, but someone in my group always ends up walking through it."
homestead,3bamf7,drink_or_die,3,Sat Jun 27 15:47:08 2015 UTC,I've been doing lots of brush clearing lately and had a couple really bad incidents. I looked online and found someone who recommended to rub oil into your skin ahead of time. The idea is that the oil saturates your skin so that the urushiol cannot be absorbed. Since then I've been coating myself in coconut oil and washing afterwards and haven't had any outbreaks.   If you like coconut smell that's a nice side benefit.
homestead,3bamf7,lukewarmmizer,5,Sat Jun 27 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"There is actually a lotion specifically for this, you put it on like sunblock and it protects your skin.  Be very careful though, you still need to be extremely careful about washing your clothes.  Depending on your washing machine/detergent/water temperature, etc you may not be getting all the oil out of your clothes when you wash them.  You also need to be careful about taking off your clothes after working, and making sure they dont contaminate your carpet/house/etc."

People who are exposed to urushiol oil repeatedly may become more sensitive, reacting to lower and lower concentrations. However, people become less sensitive to urushiol oil as they get older.   It appears that we are both right.  Age and exposure work in opposite fashions.  Your own Princeton source corroborates the assertion that /u/lukewarmmizer and I made that repeated exposure increases sensitivity.   sensitive individuals (about 85% of the population) will develop a rash within 48 hours. However, because sensitivity to the allergen develops with exposure – you are not born with it   Functionally, this works for increasing sensitivity with age for people who are routinely exposed."

OR the process they use does not allow doing one off pieces of bacon that they can guarantee came form that pig and don't want to get sued. When we have done pigs we were specifically told that if we wanted the bacon  and hams cured and smoked they would not guarantee the ham/bacon we received was from the pig that when into the processor. For the way we eat that is fine. We do the bacon ourselves so just tell them to give us the belly as a whole piece and I do the curing and smoking myself.

We can also bone out the loin and cut it into boneless chops or smoke it for canadian bacon. You will get a tenderloin (1-2 pounds of very tender meat) and we do the extra work to get the baby back ribs also.   Bacon:   One slab, 6 or more pounds. (Which brings up a good point. If it is a very small pig in the first place, like 120 hanging, it ain't worth it to smoke the bacon. I've done my fair share of bitching while trying to slice bacon that is small/flimsy) You will also get a rack of spare ribs.   Shoulder:   Smoked or fresh. Usually cut in half or left whole. I'd go with 1/2. If you need the whole thing, just roast both halves at once. OPTIONS!  My shop does something interesting with shoulders. Most of our customers prefer bacon and sausage, so we'll take the meatiest part of the shoulder, cut it off the bone, then smoke and slice it for ""canadian"" bacon. We will then bone out the rest of the shoulder for sausage.   Boston Butt:   Whole, makes an awesome roast for pulled pork, or cut into country style spare ribs. Once again, we will do the same thing with that cut as we do with the shoulder as of canadian bacon and sausage.   Head:   Usually boned out for sausage or can be given to the customer for their own uses (Head Cheese mainly). Some customers will ask for just the jowls, and we have smoked a few jowls for jowl bacon.  Hopefully this helps you when you talk to your butcher. Admittedly, some of the thing I wrote will get you cross-eyed looks, but the main, not shop specific, things will be done by most any competent butcher. If not, find a different butcher."

homestead,3b4ltp,Gump1147,7,Fri Jun 26 01:45:52 2015 UTC,"Hang on a second.  Maybe the pig is smaller.  I bought a 90lb pig.  I got a good deal but the farmer told me it'd be too small for curing bacon.  I got some nice hams but no bacon.  I was a bit bummed but if they gave me 3 inch strips of bacon, they'd hear from me.  It's probably too small for curing.  Or maybe he's/she's a douchebag.  Hard to stay in business if you're douchy."

homestead,3b4ltp,kanakari,5,Fri Jun 26 01:10:38 2015 UTC,"Ask for the primals and cut it up yourself. Sounds like they will disappoint you any other way. I would definitely recommend at least getting the uncured belly and curing it yourself, as it will taste much better than a commercial process."
homestead,3b4ltp,werevole,4,Fri Jun 26 03:27:42 2015 UTC,"I'm going to venture a guess that this is a twist on the cost of processing meat or game paid with a share of the meat (the extra time, labour and materials involved would most certainly drive up the overall cost of processing on the 1/2 pig considerably.  Remember too, that when not in a factory setting with pressure injectors and special equipment that mimics the process in the fastest possible way this process could take anywhere from several days to a week or more depending on the method used.) combined with a fixed cost (and effort) to cure and smoke bacon that in many ways may be unchangeable whether one slab or many slabs are done at once (and possibly even impossible below a certain level as the heat of the smoking may not be regulated enough without enough mass to absorb it or the curing agents are packaged in batch quantities).  Another possibility is that the butcher in question does not have the equipment or facilities for the curing and smoking and subcontracts it elsewhere where a minimum threshold of order size or cost must be met (again, perhaps paid for in share of the meat)."
homestead,3b4ltp,terrafarma,3,Fri Jun 26 02:33:26 2015 UTC,"I raise pigs, and everything you are being told is untrue. My first recommendation to you would be to find a different farmer to get a pig from, if they're blowing smoke on this, who knows what else they might be dishonest about. If that's not an option, ask to get the belly back fresh and uncut. You can cure your own bacon quite easily, there's lots of resources and recipes on the internet. You don't necessarily even have to have a smoker or a meat slicer, but they'll help if you do have access to them."
homestead,3b4ltp,lutey,2,Fri Jun 26 01:50:58 2015 UTC,If they can't cure bacon get them to give you sliced pork belly and then cute it yourself or just fry it and eat it. I got a whole pig last year and went 1/2 bacon 1/2 sliced pork belly.

If your guy isn't giving you bacon it is because he is either keeping it for himself, for a seperate sale, or is just too lazy to make bacon and wants to grind it. The belly also tells a lot about the pig, mainly in the amount of fat it has. Pork belly shouldn't be lean and fat free unless the pigs aren't being fed well."

homestead,3ayv7q,bikemandan,2,Thu Jun 25 16:20:51 2015 UTC,"Calcium, especially from egg shells, take a long time (at least a year) to become plant available in soil. I've even experimented with nearly powder-ground shells and still have found this to be true.   Generally speaking if your plants are already in the ground it is quite difficult to add fertility. Perhaps your best bet might be compost tea/deep soil drench?"
homestead,3ayv7q,CaptainCompost,2,Wed Jun 24 16:50:33 2015 UTC,"What kind of soil are they in and what does it look like? Are they in a container or in the ground? You need to find the right admixture of n-p-k (nitrogen- phosphorous- potassium) that will work well with the sun-soil-plant-water combination you have. The best way I know of that doesn't require digging the plant up, which is particularly hard in the ground, is a compost/ mulch combination. Compost is really any type of ""processed"" plant matter, you can start composting with table scraps. I would avoid adding animal products to it, like egg shells, because it prolongs and complicates the process. The rule of thumb is 2 parts carbon rich woody material, stems and wood chips and whatnot, to 1 part leafy nitrogen rich material, leaves, grass clippings, vegetable table scraps. You can speed up the process with manure or compost additives. Turn every 3 months to aerate. If the pile begins to smell, the mixture is off, add more carbon rich material. You can also try a coffee ground, tea grounds, or epsom salt drench drench for a quicker solution. Of course, the mineral content may not be the problem, as there are other factors that should be taken into consideration. Soil ph and type, quality and length of sun exposure, diseases and bugs, even water content can be a factor."

While the vines are growing, nitrogen will be helpful, but once they start producing fruit, nitrogen is not the best for tomatoes.  Manure tea would be a good source of organic nitrogen, but be careful with which manure.  Chicken manure is ""hotter"" than cow manure, too much of either will burn your tomatoes.  Also, apply it to the base of the plant not on the leaves.  Good Luck."

I'd do it a little differently though (and feel free to tell me if I'm a dumbass for doing it this way). Instead of the sticks, I'd use corrugated aluminum, or just normal sheet aluminum. Then, I'd poke holes at intervals along the side of the aluminum.   Kinda like an aeroponics set up, you could plant things at like a 45 degree angle sticking out of the side, in between spots where you plant straight down into the soil. This would help you maximize growing space, and the plants wouldn't block each other's sun, but I don't know what kind of spacing you would need to make sure everything isn't too crowded.

homestead,3ate4z,isaidputontheglasses,3,Tue Jun 23 22:14:26 2015 UTC,Our neighbors had two steer on an acre of our land when we first bought it and it was a swamp and they had to buy a bale of hay a week just to keep them fed.
homestead,3ate4z,TheIcelander,3,Tue Jun 23 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"The article it goes with assumes half an acre for a cow, kept indoors for autumn and winter. I think they just tried to liven the picture up. The pigs are on an eighth acre grass area rotating with the crops but also the cow. Just not both on the same area simultaneously."
homestead,3ate4z,BadgerDancer,3,Wed Jun 24 02:30:12 2015 UTC,"Even a half acre for a cow isn't enough. Pigs will root and their waste will burn the ground. Really, it is a bad setup if the purpose of homesteading is to create everything you need from the land. Is it doable? Absolutely, but you'll have to supplement food from off site sources (hay, grain, etc...) for the animals and expect dirt/mud lots."
homestead,3ate4z,spotpig,2,Tue Jun 23 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"We are raising two guinea hogs and I can't wait til they're in the freezer. We will never do pigs again.  I like that they graze and get kitchen scraps but they ruin all ground they're on.. and the results, for my family, isn't worth it. I'd rather focus on other critters.   We have a la Mancha goat and a lamb on maybe 1/8 or 1/4 acre and it still grows up. They don't graze that hard for us.   I think our land is best used for growing food and not animals since we know have about 2.5 acres."

Not sure why so many negative comments. The grass is the wrong color, and it's not a practical layout? Yes, but it give you the correct visualization of size and you can pick out the parts you're interested in and use them for planning. I do a lot of design with google earth by adding building and 3D trees where there are none and the biggest problem is visualizing distances and size. This diagram is great for that even if it's not practical."

homestead,3ate4z,SevenTwoThree,-1,Tue Jun 23 15:51:43 2015 UTC,"I've always found this image extremely problematic.  For one, those pigs will destroy that land, and to a slightly lesser degree, so will the cows.  Depicting those areas as grassy is just plain lying.  The amount set aside as fallow is too low, unless they are very heavily fertilizing.  That could be defrayed by rotating the cow/pig pens, but the setup shown is definitely not doing that.  The house appears massive, which would make this a helluva lot more than a 1 acre homestead.  At least 4 acres.  To that end, you need 2 acres of land to feed a calf for a year in most places (very green places can get away with a bit less).  So unless you're bringing in a massive amount of hay, that's a 5 acre paddock just for those cows.  Honestly, this image is something that is doable if you are independently wealthy and spending a fortune maintaining it."

I am a meateater, and the one who will butcher.  I was willing to butcher back when I was veggie- but I wasn't sure I would really be able to do it.  I've since gone deer hunting, as a test to myself.  I can kill and butcher an animal.  Now I have to see if I can do the same for an animal I personally raised.  I think I can.  If you find you can't do it (dear God, don't name them!) hopefully you can find a market like Craigslist where you can sell the boys and unproductive ladies."
homestead,3auoqp,Emergency_Ward,5,Tue Jun 23 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"When my wife and I met, she was 2 years removed from being a vegetarian. She had come to the conclusion that she just liked meat, but never felt comfortable with where it came from.  Now, she's still not happy with industrial meat production, but she will happily eat anything we grow and I butcher. She does get sad knowing that a rooster was just in the coop this morning, which is why we all make a concerted effort not to let our animals become our pets and to remember that we're feeding our family, not running an animal sanctuary."
homestead,3auoqp,OtisB,3,Tue Jun 23 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"I was a strict vegetarian for 15 years. Only in the past 5 years have I begun occasionally eating eggs from our chickens and fish we catch. Rarely, but I do sometimes eat squid and opihi/limpets.   Everyone else in my household eats meat. We raise rabbits, chickens and hunt wild pig on our land. I help with taking care of the animals, hunting the pig and cooking the various meat.   I have never had the craving or desire to eat meat. I'm doubting that will ever change.   I appreciate the rabbits and the chickens for their ability to assist me in gardening using their droppings. The chickens help with the insect issues as well. But I have no particularly special attachment to any of them."

homestead,3auoqp,dirtbooksun,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yes I went vegetarian for a time while researching plant-based diets for heart disease patients in nursing school. I was more committed after watching Forks Over Knives and learning more about commercial meat production in the US. In the end I craved meat and when I started raising my own food, a lot of my issues were resolved because I know the meat is healthy and that my animals have a good life. Being a vegetarian never came natural to me though, so YMMV. I've raised meat rabbits for years now, but I hope to one day add goats, beef cattle, and more.   As someone who used to try to find good homes for all my extras, it will not be possible, just like it won't be with your extra males. Health problems will also pop up intermittently when you raise animals that require you to cull the extras, too. My husband and I used to both have a very, very hard time ending a life, but we have both accepted that we give our animals a wonderful existence and this is one of the many ways they give back to us. It helps if nothing goes to waste as well- we keep furs to tan, meat and bones for us and the dogs, some organs go to the dogs, and the rest goes to the compost pile. We are thankful for our animals, but also enjoy delicious roast rabbit.   If you think the biggest issue will be slaughter day, you make be able to work out a barter system with someone for their services. I purchase culls from another rabbit breeder that doesn't want to do the deed, but in return we get extra meat and furs as well. Not to mention sometimes their culls are nicer than anything we have and they said we can use them in our breeding program. Best of luck!"

When I raised goats and chickens, we usually did the deed with a small prayer, not a religious kind, but just to thank our livestock before they became soup."

There's a water tank above the stove, connected to the kitchen sink, it doesn't heat up much, but it's not well-cold water either. They heat up water and occasionally cook on this stove to save gas.     They also have a stove exactly like this, but in better condition. It's tall, up to the ceiling, and keeps warmth well. Half of it and it's ""mouth"" is in the living room, one quarter of it in the back room and one quarter in the bedroom. They heat it up every other day usually, every day when it's really cold.

homestead,3ar9fc,noys,8,Tue Jun 23 00:19:36 2015 UTC,"They get help with the potato field in the back from a relative with a bigger tractor who is a small-scale commercial farmer, in exchange they let him plant some of their fields they don't need. They sometimes used to hire some of the local drunks to chop the wood, when they got older. That was before they got a wood chopping machine, now they're fine again, grandpa can still operate a chainsaw and takes down trees at age 84.     Daily maintenance is watering, weeding and walking through the potatoes to collect Colorado beetles by hand, it's a nuisance. They collect as much rainwater as they can. They still have time to go berry picking and mushrooming a lot in the summer. If it's a good blueberry year, grandma goes out every day, sometimes two times a day, picking a gallon almost every time she goes out. Grandpa doesn't have the patience, he likes to hunt for chanterelles. They make jams from berries or store them fresh in their freezer chest. They're like busy bees, although they're health is making them scale back a bit."

homestead,3ar9fc,Fricktitious,2,Tue Jun 23 07:39:03 2015 UTC,How do they water that garden? I have family who have a similarly sized garden but it is located next to a mini aqueduct and they can choose to let water into their field or let it pass with little doors. I have a similar space I'd love to plant a large garden but it is quite a ways from any free flowing water and I don't want to try until I figure out this dilemma. I hand water my much smaller garden.
homestead,3ar9fc,salumi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:46:05 2015 UTC,"They hand water the greenhouse and cucumbers from rainwater, They catch it off about half of the roofs of all buildings but if it's a dry year, the garden's just not as lush, they've had years when they've had some crops just dry out because there isn't enough rain, sometimes they've taken the little tractor down to a canal and filled up the drums with water there. Now they can go to the municipal pump at a cemetary, less than a mile away that's connected to a deep well, they have a shallow well and on dry years have to monitor the water level and use fresh water sparingly."

homestead,3atvlf,TrentonMaple,6,Tue Jun 23 13:49:26 2015 UTC,"One adult cow will probably turn that pasture into a dirt lot. Depending on the quality of pasture, it usually is closer to 3 acres per animal unit. You will end up feeding hay almost year round. Is it possible, yes. Is it economical, probably not. A goat(s), meat or milking, would clean that up nicely. I'd mow and then rotational graze the 1.2 acres until the goat has cleared it up. Then reevaluate. Probably not want you were wanting to hear, and strictly my opinion. Hope it works out great for you."
homestead,3atvlf,king_ranger,3,Tue Jun 23 14:48:39 2015 UTC,Why not dairy goats? You could keep 3 nigerian dwarfs on an acre and get a lot of milk from those ladies.
homestead,3atvlf,dakitchenmagician,2,Thu Jun 25 01:04:48 2015 UTC,"I've considered that.  We have some experience with goats, but we vastly prefer the taste of cow milk over goat milk.  My wife grew up on goat milk and she despises any hint of ""goaty-ness""."
homestead,3atvlf,falk225,2,Thu Jun 25 14:13:03 2015 UTC,"I do think that regular mowing helps pasture revert from tall weeds like goldenrod or iron weed back to grasses and clover. I can tell you that my neighbor started brushhogging his field 3 times a year and in just one year it has substantially reverted back to grass before my very own eyes.  I dont' know anything about cows, but I have about 1/2 acre of pasture, grass and clover, that we rotationally graze geese through. Geese can be mostly pasture fed and require little additional feed. I think they are a great substitute for cows or goats on small acreage. You can use much cheaper fencing, they are less likely to escape, and they are more easily scalable. By that I mean if you find 1 cow is too much you can't really dial it back to .85 cows. However it just takes a couple hours in the oven to bring your goose flock to an appropriate size."
homestead,3atvlf,OtisB,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:11:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not a cow expert, but I think that if you were going to use 1.2 acres for a cow, you'd have to isolate the cow from the land for a fair part of the year. If that means she doesn't go to pasture until may to let the grasses grow up some, or she has to come off pasture in july so as not to overgraze during the dry season. You can always buy hay for those periods of the year - including winter. I'm not sure that you'd be much ahead unless you find someone to possibly trade milk for hay - or maybe a calf for hay."
homestead,3ap5eo,rockfarm,5,Mon Jun 22 10:50:25 2015 UTC,"Well driller here, this is a basic overview, but its important to remember that there are a lot of details that can play into your well situation that are not mentioned here. For example,  you often find dug wells on old farmsteads, and I have worked on a number of them. My biggest concern about a dug well is the cover. A thitsty mouse can squeeze through a very small hole and then drown trying to get a drink. The question then comes to how many varmit remains do you want in your drinking water. I personally would never use a dug well as a drinking water source but thats because I have seen and heard of too many things. Worst being dead calves and goats floating or sewers overflowing into wells. I do understand some areas are water poor and dug wells are the best options for reservoir but do consider water purification and test occasionally as mentioned in the article. I will also answer basic questions if ppl have any."
homestead,3ap5eo,kellerumd,3,Mon Jun 22 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"I have one. Are people of your trade knowledgeable enough to know all things about a new well (where, how deep, safe, legal?) or do I need to hire some kind of geological engineering firm? Maybe you are an engineer also?"
homestead,3ap5eo,DreamArcher,5,Mon Jun 22 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"So in my state, Minnesota,  we are licensed by the department of health and they maintain a list of all wells drilled since the 80s which includes depth, water production and basic info about pump and pitiless that were installed. Each new well is also inspected by the state to verify its legal and our license is on the line if it isn't. Because of this we can inspect a well and tell you if it is legal based on the training required by the state and our ongoing interactions with inspectors.  Well drillers will often know a general depth for your area based on experience.  If you have concerns about your well drillers, find out who regulates them and talk to them but as long as your state has licensing requirements and you pick a licensed driller they should be able to answer questions."
homestead,3ap5eo,kellerumd,3,Mon Jun 22 16:16:04 2015 UTC,Cool. Thanks for the info.
homestead,3ap5eo,DreamArcher,2,Mon Jun 22 16:21:50 2015 UTC,"I lucked out on my dug well on my one property. The well is not very deep but the water quality is  superb! We have it tested 2 times a year and comes back with perfect results. It has no flavor or scent to it. I did install a sediment filter system plus a UV light.  Now on my second property the one we live on, the well is drilled. In my opinion too deep. The water tastes a bit like sulfur and has a earthy scent to it. It's also much harder. We have a UV installed as well as an Iron filter, 2 stage sediment and a water softener.  We are thinking of getting an R.O. installed under the kitchen sink. Just for drinking purposes.  Question I have  Now I have a (underground) spring fed pond. Are there ways to bring the spring to life a bit? This was used to provide the cattle on the farm with drinking water. I would like to have the spring feed water to the pond again.  Tips are welcome..."
homestead,3ap5eo,Ebethron,2,Mon Jun 22 16:45:50 2015 UTC,I would never recommend to anyone to mess with a spring fed pond because I dont know how far dnr would crawl up your ass for that. In MN they would consider that tampering with natural ecosystems or something. Talk to your local soil and water office or whatever your equivalent is about the pond. They may allow you to dig it out with a long stick track hoe but with the water issues some states have it may be a contested issue.  Deeper wells can have more hardness in them but in my experience shallower wells have more contamination. Not all of coarse. It sounds like you more than have it under control with add on water treatment.  What we tell people is that we will find water but we won't guarantee the quality of the water. No sure fire way to predict it.
homestead,3ap5eo,kellerumd,2,Mon Jun 22 20:20:11 2015 UTC,"Question: My house was built in the late 1700s and there is a very deep hand dug well right next to the house. Sometime ago they drilled a new well through the bottom of the hand dug well. The hand dug well always has at least 8 or 10 feet of water in the bottom and we have seen the occasional rat (I assume) corpse floating in it.   Any chance the water in the hand dug well is affecting the water being pumped up through the drilled well? I am not sure how deep the drilled well goes, but water analysis when we bought checked out just fine."
homestead,3ap5eo,maatismoot,2,Mon Jun 22 20:07:55 2015 UTC,"It can but it depends on the quality of work your driller did. So the well in the middle was either drilled in or pounded down. Either way they should have filled any space around the outside of the hole with grout, cement, or drill cuttings depending on your state requirements. They may have also cased the well meaning a pipe inside of a pipe to prevent leeching. This should prevent the top aquifer from leeching into the bottom aquifer.  In MN they usually frown on intermixing aquifers. Whether they did this or did a quality job of this is for you to investigate either by asking them or asking the people who license them.  Depending how deep the hand dug is you could always fill it in around the pipe and eliminate this issue. Again, there may be guidelines about this. For example in MN we would have to use a non permeable clay. But if it is a deep hand dug well I dont know how much it would cost.  In my area we would charge $150 for a water test performed by a lab. The lab would test for arsenic,  chloroform bacteria and nitrates.  Your state prices and testing requirements may differ."

homestead,3amo2i,nanofarm,2,Mon Jun 22 03:49:03 2015 UTC,"Could be a bunch of reasons. Lack of pollination, the trees not overlapping their times properly, too heavy a crop from the previous year, insects causing disease, lack of drainage in your clay soil is getting to them, etc. You'll have to really inspect the trees to figure it out. Turning clay won't actually help drainage, you'd have to add something coarse in there like mulch. Clay is stupidly tiny soil particles, so it compacts very easily and doesn't drain well unless you're on a slope or something. However, some fruit drop is natural, especially if the trees aren't being regularly pruned.  http://www.starkbros.com/growing-guide/article/shedding-light-on-fruit-drop/  http://extension.psu.edu/plants/gardening/fact-sheets/home-orchard-production/why-is-there-no-fruit-on-my-tree  http://www.plantanswers.com/garden_column/april3/april3.htm  Hope this helps."

I'm not sure what the biological cause is, but it doesn't seem to have an impact on harvest. We have little green immature apples falling left and right here, it's just what they do.  But you need to research (a) what is typical for the particular type of trees you're talking about, e.g., what is true for an apple will not necessarily be true for a persimmon, and (b) what is typical for your region."
homestead,3amo2i,mcapello,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:34:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone. Researching your recommendations, I think it may be partially a lack of pollinators in the city here and my lack of thinning. In general trees here are under-fertilized and thus susceptible to disease, but ours definitely seem more robust and hopefully disease resistant than last year. Does clay soil promote ABOVE ground rot/disease at all?"

homestead,3akmp1,joelkarl1,4,Sun Jun 21 12:48:50 2015 UTC,"It depends how they are raised. I have two ducks that are entirely free range in the river. Their eggs have a dark red yolk and taste way too wild or fishy for me. My wife, however, loves them.  I also have 16 ducks that forage about in the day time, but don't have to get all their nutrition in the wild because we feed them organic layer mash in the evening to get them to come back to their coop. (This also helps fatten them up for slaughter time.) These eggs have a dark orange yolk and can taste almost identical to chicken eggs. Although, I can still usually detect a note of that wild flavor.  Overall, duck eggs are prized for their creaminess and high moisture content that lends itself well to baking.  Would you believe the local health food store wants $7.50 for their cheapest dozen of duck eggs?  I highly recommend trying them!"

Well, we're not certified, but their feed is certified organic and local. You get the gist...  It sucks. Ducks are better suited for the environment here being native to the states. They are also more cost effective for me because I have 4 ponds and a large length of river for them to forage from making the need for grain next to nothing about 9 months out of the year. 16 ducks share half of a large coffee can of layer mash once per day.  If you think about it, they are kind of more environmentally friendly than chickens (if they have a proper habitat) because less grain transportation is involved. At least IMO."

I would also add something like insecticidal soap or neem oil for your plants. neem oil needs to be mixed but insecticidal soap you can buy premixed. You just spray it on the leaves (both are organic) and it kills the bugs and leaves behind a residue that keeps the plants away."

homestead,3agxnc,bigattichouse,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:12:39 2015 UTC,Not an apples-apples comparison (lithium ion vs nickel iron). Tesla is 10kWh for $3500. This NiFe is 9.6kWh for $7760 (12v800Ah). You have to consider usable capacity also. Lithium can be discharged nearly completely while I believe NiFe cannot (lead acid should only be discharged about 50%)  Edit: I see now they also do lithium. They have an 8.4kWh bank for $4978 (12v700Ah)
homestead,3agxnc,bikemandan,3,Sat Jun 20 03:30:26 2015 UTC,"The NiFe's can be discharged to 95%, I think, according to one of their pdf's. For double the price it seems you get over double the life cycles out of em though.  Also, from Tesla's site:  Models 10 kWh $3,500 For backup applications  7 kWh $3,000 For daily cycle applications Warranty- 10 years Power- 2.0 kW continuous, 3.3 kW peak   What does all that mean? You can only run 2.0kW of drain at any given time, or surge to 3.3? Also, their 10kW model says something about being a ""weekly cycle"", versus their 7kW model being a daily cycle. What does this mean?"
homestead,3agxnc,realeyes_realize_,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:50:07 2015 UTC,Daily cycling is for shifting power demand across the day and night. Most commonly would be used for buying power at night and using it during the day to lower the utility bill. Weekly is more for power packup/blackout purposes but also could be used to store power for shady days on a solar system.
homestead,3agxnc,farmerjane,2,Sat Jun 20 07:07:34 2015 UTC,"That's it.

homestead,3agxnc,realeyes_realize_,3,Sat Jun 20 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"Considering Tesla's agenda is to push renewable energy, I would imagine off grid application isn't going to void the warranty, so long as a professional does the installation.

That is, daily cycling for the use of charging an electric car (one of theirs, presumably) at a lower than peak rate to decrease their mpg equivalent, the distance able to be traveled per charge per dollar equivalent of gas. They are competing with gasoline powered vehicles, not off the grid or backup home electrical systems. While you can use them for auxiliary power for home use,  that is a secondary application, not their primary function."

homestead,3agxnc,DeftNerd,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:28:20 2015 UTC,"The nickel-iron battery has a coulombic efficiency of less than 65%, while a lithium-ion battery has a coulombic efficiency of greater than 95%. This means for every 1 unit of energy you put into a nickel-iron battery, you get less than 0.65 units out, while you would get greater than 0.95 units in a lithium-ion battery.   A nickel-iron power system therefore needs 46% more input power to output the same energy as a lithium-ion power system. A 100kW solar panel system would need to be ~150kW if you were using nickel-iron batteries.  Furthermore, a nickel-iron battery discharges 10-15% in 24 hours, while a lithium-ion battery discharges 5%. This further increases your system size and therefore cost. What do you do if you have no sun for a couple days?"

The one thing that could swing them into favor in my opinion is the lifespan. From what I've read, NiFe batteries have life spans that can span generations without significant deterioration of capacity where Lithium might only be good for 5 or 10 years until it's capacity is significantly diminished.   Any thoughts on this?  If you look at the big picture of a system that you intend to have entirely off-grid for 50 years, having a power bank that has lower maintenance and little deterioration might be better even though it's significantly less efficient.   Personally, I wish home-sized vacuum flywheel technology was available to be tossed into the options too!"

But they cool down in the rain and the goats don't mind. And they are marvelously warm for babies in the winter.   Last year we ordered 40 of them - they arrived as pictured in isaid's example. We use the metal cages for hay feeders. So double purpose. We used them during kidding season (I made wire doors so that the mom and babies could get a couple days of privacy before being moved to a communal pen with a few other mamas until the babes are old enough to be ""at large"") and I was extremely pleased.  The young goats also greatly enjoy stomping on them and jumping on and off, if you have a large breed. There's video on my youtube of the manchas having a blast.

homestead,3agqmk,rockfarm,5,Sat Jun 20 00:52:22 2015 UTC,"What's this list doing in r/homestead?  Anyway, it bugs me because it glosses over some important issues. One is ""the dose makes the poison"". It's probably true in a straightforward way for, for example, heavy metals. But in the case of some molecules (hormones and endocrine disrupters, at the very least), the relationship between dose and response is not necessarily linear because hormones are effective in extremely small concentrations, because they often do different things in different concentrations, because they often have strong effects only during short developmental windows, and because they are often involved in complex regulatory mechanisms. In some cases, a smaller dose might actually produce a more extreme response because the larger dose triggers an inhibitory response. In some cases, exposure to an endocrine disruptor doesn't produce effects until the second generation, which makes it hard to figure out the toxicity in the first place. It's actually really complicated.  I'm also bothered by the claim that a natural and synthetic version of the same chemical are necessarily the same. The truth is, it depends on the chemical and the process by which it's synthesized. Biological molecules are often 'handed', which is to say that a mirror image of the molecule is not the same as the original molecule (this is called chirality). When a molecule is created naturally--say, as part of a biochemical process inside a cell--all instances of that molecule will have the same chirality. But when a molecule is synthesized in a lab, there's going to be a 50-50 mix between the two mirror images. AND the two molecules are generally not going to do the same thing in the body. Some of the time the mirror image doesn't do anything. Some of the time it's going to do something bad. There are processes to sort the two out (and I think drug makers are required to do this for drugs now) but much of the time, if the extra version is thought to be inert it will get mixed in to the final product. I'm pretty sure over-the-counter vitamins are still like this, and artificial flavors probably are too. There have definitely been a few cases where the mirror image turned out to be evil--I'm pretty sure this is part of what happened with DES in the mid-20th century [edit: remembered wrong. This is definitely what happened with thalidomide. And maybe also DES. Sorry, I'm tying to remember long ago examples from biochem). AND I have no idea what rules may exist about controlling for chirality in a substance not intended to be used as a drug. Like, what if people tried to synthesize some natural pest-resistant hormone secreted by a plant and turn it into pesticide or bug spray? (I totally made this example up, but it seems plausible to me) It wouldn't be intended for human consumption, but it would end up in the food chain anyway. I'm not saying the resulting product would be automatically bad--but the mix would probably contain 50% enantiomer, which would make it definitely not the same as the 'natural' chemical you might get in some more expensive plant extract preparation. And potentially it could be more dangerous.  Tl;dr: actually, it's complicated. Also, hormones. chirality in drugs link, discusses thalidomide"
homestead,3agqmk,DevonianAge,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:32:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know what it's doing on /r/homestead either.   Addressing your points, enantiomers are different chemicals that are typically distinguishable by a variety of methods.  They can usually be separated and in the case of hormones and peptides the natural versions (containing L amino acids) can be synthesized with 100% efficiency by using an industrial microbe as the factory.    I think that the misconception the author was addressing was the notion that structurally identical molecules are distinguishable according to the way they were created (naturally, transgenically, synthetically etc).  That isn't the case, molecules with identical structure are equivalent in every way...as far as science can tell.    I think it's a matter of being precise in our terminology.  You bring up a good point...that in the past we distinguished chemicals by their chemical and structural formulas  without always making note of their chirality/3D structure.  Now we know better.   But the differences between ""natural"" and (some of the) ""artificial"" chemicals in those cases was something particular/concrete about the structure itself.  In others words, in the synthetic 50/50 mixture half of the molecules were equivalent to their natural counterparts despite being prepared artificially.  If the synthetic product had been purified completely or prepared more carefully there would truly have been no difference.    The question is, will we someday discover another aspect or quality of biomolecules 3D structure and chemical properties that distinguishes ""natural"" from ""synthetic"".....maybe, but I think not."
homestead,3agqmk,LuckyPoire,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:51:29 2015 UTC,"Clearly you're more recently versed in this stuff than me, but I think you basically backed up my point. And I tend to agree that there are probably no other properties distinguishing 'natural' from 'synthetic' besides chirality.  On a practical/consumer level, I think it's important to consider the possibility that, when purification of a mixture is not required, manufacturers probably aren't going to do it (unless it's extremely cheap, which I'm pretty sure it's not--unless that's changed since I got out of school, which is possible). So, in that context (and I think that's the context the article was addressing), I think it's fair to say that 'natural' and 'synthetic' chemicals could be different, unless purification is much more widespread that I thought.  It's true that if the manufacturing process itself is biological (as in industrial microbes), this wouldn't be a problem. I have no idea how widespread that process is, do you?"
homestead,3agqmk,DevonianAge,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:21:30 2015 UTC,"I think we are basically splitting hairs.    If we are being as specific as possible, we can say for example - ""natural"" L-alanine is equivalent to synthetic (or transgenic) L-alanine.    If we are speaking of chemicals in more general terms we could say, ""natural"" alanine MAY OR MAY NOT not be functionally equivalent to ""synthetic"" alanine.  It would depend on further analysis of the chiral structure of the synthetic alanine.    Regarding use of industrial microbes for production of biological molecules...I would suspect this is near universal.  Anything that can be genetically encoded (DNA, RNA, peptides) can easily be produced via fermentation using E. coli, yeast or other animal tissue cells.  Aside from that, any molecule or substance that is a product of a (natural or designed) metabolic pathway can be manufactured in a similar way.    We can control and harness transcription, translation and metabolism on a cellular level to produce many chemicals (biological and otherwise) that would otherwise be very difficult to synthesize from their elemental components in a test tube.   Edit:  Further reading on the subject...doesn't really say how widespread the practice is, but I think it's very widespread.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharming_(genetics)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology  https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Metabolic_engineering"

homestead,3a7sa8,OtisB,3,Wed Jun 17 22:09:40 2015 UTC,Super detailed and seems easy enough to actually implement exactly as it's explained. A very good read!
homestead,3a7sa8,InformationHorder,5,Thu Jun 18 01:50:41 2015 UTC,"It has inspired me to go out and shorten the weeds that have popped up in my back yard and give it to the birds whole. If they don't eat it, it becomes another layer for their deep bedding.  I don't make enough kitchen scraps to keep my birds fed... sigh I'm so alone :("
homestead,3a7sa8,kayakyakr,3,Thu Jun 18 05:08:48 2015 UTC,"I wish we had more kitchen scraps too, and there's 6 of us in my house. The variety of kitchen leftovers is really good for the chickens. But, the variety of the various ""weeds"" that grow about our property is almost as good. I don't even know the names of half of the things that I feed my birds, but they gobble it up and seem to be healthy and happy. In the last 3 years of feeding using variations of this method, we have not lost a single bird to illness."

homestead,3a7jjt,rockfarm,3,Wed Jun 17 21:06:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, but splitting it up over several years allows you to take it in smaller chunks against earnings. Issue to remember is that you have to be a business. It also doesn't allow to take the full amount if it pushes you into a loss. for most starting out small farm type businesses, you will be loosing money the first year or two. You also don't want to take too many losses and end up with a loss in year 3 and end up reclassified as a ""hobby"" rather than a business. I would think most homestead type farm startups are going to be loosing money the first year, not posting the kind of profit that would cover taking a new tractor fully as a duduction."
homestead,3a6nez,belousugar,5,Wed Jun 17 17:21:20 2015 UTC,Are they all the same species? Do all the buckets contain soil from the same source? Have you watered them all the same? Did you germinate first or just plant the seeds? Are they all getting the same amount of sunlight? Do you have a cat?

homestead,3a6nez,4ray,2,Thu Jun 18 13:46:46 2015 UTC,"Wait, maybe I misunderstood your situation. Are you saying the two mature tomato plants in the picture were germinated from seed at the same time as the others? The vigor concept can still apply, but this is WAY beyond that. Im not even sure how those seedlings could possibly still be alive after 2 months on a roof. Something isnt adding up.  What USDA hardiness zone are you in? Latitude? Seed cultivar (variety)? What was the garunteed analysis of soil nutrients (should have been listed on the bag or from the soil supplier for N-P-K)?"
homestead,3a6nez,4ray,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:05:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're all from the same variety, same seed packet. I live in Somerville, MA which is 6a, just outside of Boston.

homestead,3a6nez,4ray,5,Thu Jun 18 14:50:59 2015 UTC,"Get rid of the wood.   If you add wood chips to soil and try to grow seeds in that, next to nothing will grow until the wood is rotted away.  I don't know if it's a toxin from the tree,  nitrogen being sucked up as the wood rots, or both.  If you get fresh soil with no wood, you can take cuttings from the strong plants and root them easily."
homestead,3a6nez,4ray,2,Thu Jun 18 02:28:41 2015 UTC,"I didn't put any wood chips in there, just organic soil. Is there a type of soil you can buy without any traces of wood in it?

homestead,3a6nez,delelles,0,Thu Jun 18 19:38:13 2015 UTC,In that case it's odd.  Possibly seed-borne disease?  I've put seeds in cheap soil made with improperly composted yard waste and they came up and opened but stayed that way for weeks without getting any bigger.

The plastic may leech chemicals, especially since they're sitting in the sun and coming in contact with soil and water.

homestead,3a6uj1,Stoic_Statesman,3,Wed Jun 17 18:10:02 2015 UTC,"FWIW I'm an architect. The main benefit of concrete is that it's structural properties are a given. When you start adding stone and layering stuff up you loose the ability to know how strong the foundation is. For three floors you would probably only need a 24"" wide by 12"" thick foundation with 2 #4 rebar, but it depends on the soil bearing capacities of your location. Sand is going to be a lot less structurally supportive than bedrock for example. Depth is also a concern with the freeze/thaw cycle. There's a possibility of  making your own concrete by by hauling portland cement to the site and mixing it with sand and stone found on site."
homestead,3a6uj1,App1eEater,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:29:08 2015 UTC,"To expand on this, do not pour concrete on the ground. You need to prep the site first. The only exception being bedrock.   Dig down a ways (below local frost line), then do a layer of rock. Top it with gravel, making sure to level and pack after every few inches you add. Aim for 100% compaction. Then you can build forms and pour concrete.   It's labour intensive but not expensive if you do if all yourself, including hauling material.   Source: I do this for a living."
homestead,3a6uj1,SevenTwoThree,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:21:54 2015 UTC,"Having had concrete work done around our place a few times, this prep work seems like a huge portion of the job, but pays off huge down the road.  Especially if it gets really cold or is soft (sand)."

Beet greens are, depending on the specific variety, some of the best greens you can get out of anything that's not lettuce, including spinach.  Some are a little more bitter, but they're GREENS.  EAT THEM.  If you don't like them raw, learn to cook them.  Here's a hint:  Bacon fat, onions, cider vinegar, salt.    Also, don't pickle beets?  Eff that.  Canning and not having anything that's not tomatoes turn to mush isn't that hard, and doing a fermentation-based pickle will almost definitely turn out awesome.  Stop blog-spamming nonsense."

We feel very passionate about food sovereignty, self sufficiency and community sustainability. We work in various ways with our local community to support and assist, volunteer and teach.   It's been a dream of ours to purchase this new piece of land outside of our homestead, in what others consider an ""impoverished area"", and transform it with the community.   Having a learning space where those interested can come and learn at little to no cost seems like a huge step in the right direction.   We were first incredibly inspired by Ron Finley and his TED talk. From there we changed a large portion of our business model to a pay it forward format.   Then we watched this 16 minute video by the Urban Farming Guys   http://youtu.be/T-vyjyK6_kg  We started to think outside of the box and wanted to do something similar on a smaller scale relative to our location.   Edit x 2 to add a sentence and another one too."

homestead,3a3vj2,Catabisis,3,Wed Jun 17 04:41:51 2015 UTC,"That's a great question and a thought we have pondered. Especially since their is a lot of waste that can easily be transformed into usable building materials.   Living on an island we must be aware of consumption, waste and sustainability.   We are leaning towards yurts as we know they can be constructed as both non permitted and permitted. And they can be moved easier than firm foundational houses.   But the area our newest land purchased is in is quite off grid and non permitted structures are not such a red flag. No county water, limited access to electric hookup, no internet, no sewage, no garbage pickup, etc.   Have you assisted in earthship construction before?"

A lot of folks that are members of our local farmers market are looking soon and now for assistance for the upcoming busy season.
homestead,3a3vj2,Colonel_Pusstache,2,Wed Jun 17 05:20:28 2015 UTC,"Ah! It's great that you're looking to be a WWOOF host farm. It really gets younger generations excited about farming/homesteading. I recently just stopped wwoofing /harvesting for a more lucrative job so I can start a homestead in the next few years and hopefully host volunteers. If you do host, I'm sure you'll have plenty of volunteers flock to such a beautiful place ya have.   Side note: I noticed your using fox farms for things waiting to be transplanted. I don't know if it's available much in Hawaii but if you can find bails of peat moss (most of what fox farms bags are) and mix it 50/50 with compost you'll manage to save quite a bit for the same results. A 3.8 cu ft bail that expands to 8 cu ft costs about 10 bucks on the mainland."

What is the minimum for utilities and for cheapest rent to live safely in a given neighborhood? Thank you for your time responding and for sharing your beautiful pic. The camera did a great job
homestead,3a3vj2,gunch,2,Wed Jun 17 09:25:11 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of variables in rent prices based on location. Each island is unique. As is each area of the islands. Rent can be very expensive in the cities and much less in the jungles if living off grid in a shack style house. And in some areas rent isn't that bad. Here's a link to Craigslist for the Big Island to give you some examples.  https://honolulu.craigslist.org/search/big/apa  Electric rates are some of the highest in the nation. Many folks try to get solar and in some areas generate wind electric by turbines on roofs for a bit more power.   Food costs are outrageously high as is gas. So those things need to be taken into account also.   There is a very large Filipino population here. Many of the foods grown here are from the Philippines. There is an amazing mix of cultures here. For some it's hard to understand the local way of living, for others it just feels like home."

I'm trying to teach my children about gardening and growing your own food with raised bed I have built in the backyard.

Teaching your children about gardening is one of the best actions you can take IMO. The impact it has is beyond measure.   That's a large part of what got me to where I am today. Growing up on a homestead learning to garden. It truly inspired me at a very young age.   Keep doing what your doing! If you're in the U.S. I will happily mail you a large selection of organic heirloom seeds for your specific climate zone. I'd like to support your gardens and your children's interest in it too.

homestead,3a3vj2,RESERVA42,5,Wed Jun 17 01:29:32 2015 UTC,Fine.  I'll be the one to ask.  How much did it cost?
homestead,3a3vj2,RESERVA42,10,Wed Jun 17 03:20:47 2015 UTC,That's a good question.   My SO's great-grandfather was a paniolo (Hawaiian Cowboy) for the ranch that all of this areas land belongs to. This is pre statehood days in Hawaii. He worked for many many years as an exchange for this land. He was offered the land in work trade as he was a respected cowboy and dependable worker.   Our family is one of only a few that own land outright in our area. Nowadays leasehold is the only option for land (not ownership of said land) in our area.   Just as an example. And it's not the most exact example. A 5 acre lot across from us just sold fee simple for 2.5 million with three houses. 1 permitted and 2 nonconforming. Not the best example of land costs because the wife of the property owner is a very renowned real estate agent and has high end clients willing to pay top dollar for smaller lots.   Another lot sold in our area for almost a million fee simple for 3 acres and a house.   We are located in a prime coffee growing region. So the land cost goes up considerably because of that factor alone.   Rarely does land go up for sale around here because families treasure the land for many generations.   Edit-spelling.

It must be properly prepared for eating however. We use this method with baking soda as a neutralizer as well as soaking.   http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187661961400014X  White sap that irritates skin you're mentioning reminds me more of plants in the Euphorbia species.

The question becomes do you need to raise a lot of money off of this land or just enough produce for you and your family.  Luckily, you have a nice long growing season.   Things I would do......  Grow lots and lots of garlic.  It is a easy crop and you could work with local restaurants and sell them your crop.  Chicken Coops, once it is up and running you could develop an old school system of delivering fresh eggs to people in Rich subdivisions once a week.  Blueberries.....  Freeze them, Jam them, Pie them.  Meat Chickens...  Offer to sell to the same people you deliver eggs to.    Those are just a few ideas....

homestead,39u60z,momosinthedojo,2,Sun Jun 14 22:48:03 2015 UTC,The land is predominantly pasture. Approximately one acre is wooded.
homestead,39u60z,momosinthedojo,5,Sun Jun 14 23:21:48 2015 UTC,Cool.    Off the top of my head I'd look into a miniature breed jersey on the pasture for milk. Maybe turkeys and/or pigs in the wooded area depending on what infrastructure is available to process and store meat. Rabbits and chickens would be part of my 'standard deployment' regardless of the acreage or infrastructure.    Generally speaking I'd probably focus on fruit and nut trees and perennial vegetables.  Probably mulch the hell out of it even if its in Georgia.  Probably a beehive even just for pollination.  Beyond that it's depend on the specifics.  I'd keep the livestock small.  Even a mini breed cow would be too much IMO for one person.  Any particular aspects of the land that stick out to you?  How many people are planned to be on the acreage?  Permanently or seasonally?
homestead,39u60z,onthefarmga,2,Sun Jun 14 23:43:16 2015 UTC,"All excellent suggestions.  Myself, my wife, and several children, two of which are capable of work and two of which are capable of helping. This would be our home, so I am hoping it would be permanent!"
homestead,39u60z,momosinthedojo,3,Mon Jun 15 02:45:30 2015 UTC,"Many hands make for light work.  Might be worth asking the older kids what they'd like to be involved with.  If I was in your position I suppose I'd go slow, start the work in zones zero and one (the house itself and its immediate vicinity).  I've heard and seen quite a number of people bite off more than they can chew and have to ultimately scale back or abandon their property altogether.  That's the part that I think most on.  I've heard Joel Salatin give advice to people before and what sticks out to me is to avoid debt.  To me that means go slow.  I'd rather buy a smaller property free and clear than borrow money for a larger one.  I'd also mention that in my mind a homestead is different from a farm.  The difference to me is that a homestead is an operation focused on tightly linking on-site production with on-site consumption.  A farm is a scaled up operation meant for selling products to market.  Not that I wouldn't sell my surplus but its not my primary concern.  I always think of Ralph Borsodi saying they gave up the family cow because it threatened to put his family in the dairy business.  That's how I think about it too."

homestead,39u60z,broscientologist,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:50:16 2015 UTC,"We have 7 acres somewhat south of where you are (near Athens).  The best use we've made so far as we work our way into homesteading has been a Jersey milk cow and a Tamworth hog.  We went with a full size jersey.  Miniatures can be very expensive.  We use every bit of milk because of the hog.  She gets a couple gallons every day and we use the rest for drinking, cheese, yogurt, cream cheese, etc...  We read that a lot of people think a full size jersey makes too much milk, but we've found there's never any left after we distribute it around.  The dog has gotten used to a bowl every time we milk.  She doesn't eat much dog food anymore which is a bonus.  When our cow has her next calf, the calf will get half of the milk so we'll probably run short. Other than that, chickens and a nice big garden are the most productive.  Our land is more forest than pasture and we are thinking of clearing another couple of acres so we can grow more forage for the cows and horses.  Hay is  probably our biggest food expense for the animals.  We are expecting our first piglets in about a month and are hoping to sell most of them to cover a lot of our overall farm costs."
homestead,39u60z,m4gpi,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:50:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks for sharing your setup.  I would clarify that the advantage I see in miniatures is that they require less pasture.  To me that is important.  Less pasture means less mortgage."

homestead,39u60z,rcrracer,2,Sun Jun 14 23:22:18 2015 UTC,"Hey there, potential neighbor! To add to the making-$$ discussion, GA has a ""cottage kitchen"" law: you can sell certain home-produced foodstuffs without a business license, if you are into that. Jams, pickles, fruit pies, some cakes, dried fruit... Basically not meat or dairy products. You can do farmers markets and sell direct to individuals, but not to stores or restaurants. You have to pay an annual fee (100$, I think?) and follow some easy rules. I assume this covers roadside fruit stands as well, but I could be wrong. Just FYI."

homestead,39t8mw,preclusion,8,Sun Jun 14 22:34:34 2015 UTC,"I had a huge infestation of Earwigs the first year I was building a large garden in the backyard of a rental. I mean huge.   There would be clumps of hundreds of them at a time under certain areas of the garden. I was using a method of sheet composting involving laying down cardboard, compost and hay/straw.  Anyway, I wouldn't have minded them but when I explored the garden at night I would find 10-20 of them at a time on a single plant. Left to thier own my entire garden would be decimated in a week.  There are a few different problems that you need to solve:   They're destroying your plants and you need them to stop immediately.    Use diatomaceous earth liberally around the base of each plant they're attacking. Insects hate this stuff and it will actually kill them if they're overexposed to it. It has to be thick and you need to reapply pretty much every night for weeks until they're under control.    You want to curb the growth of thier population.    You can do this by limiting their food sources and places to hide. Check out the links for more info on this.    Find a long term solution that doesn't require much if any maintenance.    This is where you want to start planting things that will attract their predators. Toads, lizards and birds will eat earwigs. There is also a particular parasitic fly that will help a lot, again, more info in one of the links.      The most important thing is to not get overwhelmed and actually try and have compassion for the creatures themselves. This way you're able to look at the situation for what it is and not that you're failing in some way. The conditions just happened to be right for them to move in and start breeding, you now have to change the conditions.   I don't have that garden anymore but I can tell you that year two I barely saw the damage from them and year three they were completely reduced to a manageable level.   Good luck with your garden!

Every day the pot will become full of earwigs. Dispose of the earwigs every day. The population eventually gets lowered.

Some other things I'd suggest include making cheese/ kefir/ yogurt/ kombucha, sewing, if you drink alcohol then winemaking and home brewing, homemade body care products and soap, pottery is another useful skill for many applications, growing mushrooms, beekeeping (some cities do allow it), fiber making and spinning gathering materials either from plants or animal, weaving, crotchet, hunting and wild food foraging/ gathering, seed saving, rain water catchment if allowed in your specific area, upcycling everything you can, wild crafted medicines and salves/growing and learning medicinal properties of plants, planting more native species on your property/creating gardens to attract and assist native pollinators, fishing, making bread, create a home based business doing something you enjoy for a bit of extra income or have a booth at your local farmers market."

We started off on a half acre in a city and caught the homesteading bug with raised bed gardens, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and old pear tree that was already there.  We started raising quail and then even had 3 laying hens in a chicken tractor.  Totally against the city rules but the neighbors were intrigued and loved what we were doing so no one ever complained.  We caught the homesteading bug so bad we moved out to the country and bought a place on 10 acres.  We've been here for over three years and I still always think about how much more we could have done on that half acre especially if we paid off the mortgage and bought ourselves some free time."

This worked great on one of my larger ones. My only concern would be the curvature of a barrel.   For just a hose you can get a barbed fitting that is barbed on one side and threaded on the other. Then get a spigot that threads to it. Use some Teflon tape for the threads and some plumbers putty around the barbs. This worked great on one of my smaller ones."

homestead,39q9sg,uliarliarpantsonfire,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:47:38 2015 UTC,"You can try taking her out of the nest and putting her with the flock a few times, making sure to take any eggs under her. If that doesn't work on a sunny warm day take and give her a cool bath. Just put her in a little tub of cold water and dip water over her chest, back, and belly. Cold tap water is what you want not ice water or anything like that. Don't blow dry her or anything just dry her a little with a towel and let her warm up in the sun. If that doesn't work you can try a wire cage with no nesting material. My Gran used to put a bag of frozen peas under her broodies. The idea behind all these is that the hens are responding to the warmer weather thinking aha it's time to make chicks, you want to cool her off and get her out of the hot nest box. I hope that helps."

homestead,39o9hk,Terminal-Psychosis,3,Sat Jun 13 08:40:05 2015 UTC,"I think they broke through their sac before they were mature enough so he expected them to dry out and die inside their sac due to not being able to break through and breath/escape the shell. So he helped them break through and allow them to breath so they could get stronger and then break out themselves.  He said that the egg shell sac thing will actually ""shrink wrap"" and ""cement"" itself to the duckling if they don't break through early enough.  I have no clue, just speculation."
homestead,39o9hk,d03boy,2,Sat Jun 13 14:12:58 2015 UTC,"Right on, that makes a lot of sense."
homestead,39o9hk,Terminal-Psychosis,2,Sat Jun 13 14:25:43 2015 UTC,"The humidity in the incubator was too low and the temperature was too high during the incubation period (though only by a tenth of a degree Celsius). This caused the ducklings to develop faster than they should have and outgrow their shells before they could turn around to get to the air sack. They pipped a hole to breathe and let the moisture out of the shells, which, due to the low humidity in the incubator (even after he adjusted it) dried the membrane around them and trapped them. He lost a whole bunch of them (nearly a hundred, I think!) prior to this because he didn't realize what was wrong. He actively freed this set of ducklings to keep them from dying. Mat loves his ducks!"

homestead,39o9hk,CreateBread,2,Sat Jun 13 14:22:55 2015 UTC,"While I'm not happy a bunch of ducklings died, honestly... I kind of agree with you. I don't think he should have put another set into the incubator the other day. He should just raise what he has and save up for next year. I mean, he still has some 300 ducklings, even if all the new eggs in the hatcher fail besides the ones he helped hatch. Hopefully posting this helped get some attention!"
homestead,39o9hk,CreateBread,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:58:06 2015 UTC,"He apparently overturned the eggs which caused positioning problems for the ducklings, had the temperature wrong, way off with humidity, and relying on the channel and the fans/private companies to carry a hefty portion of TDA's weight are a few of the problems this season.

homestead,39lg4b,RaeSor,2,Fri Jun 12 15:40:36 2015 UTC,My first thought is late blight. Your pictures lead me to believe it could be another virus in addition to late blight.   Some things to consider.   Do not compost any part of this plant. If you do remove it then throw it away. Blight and other virus will remain in the soil for a long time. Remove all fallen leaves and plant parts as well.   You will want to disinfect the tomato cage for future use also.   Clean your scissors/pruning shears diligently with a cotton ball dipped in rubbing alcohol to prevent spreading the disease/virus/fungal infection.

Also, it seems kind of odd that no other plants are affected, and I looked pretty thoroughly. If this is some kind of fungus or virus I'll be keeping my fingers crossed that it doesn't spread.    I'm in a new-to-me garden (we moved here last fall and the previous tenants had a big garden that I'm now planting in) so who knows what's in the soil.  It's been one problem after another with pests (Colorado potato beetle, June beetles, squash bugs, etc) so I guess now I can add 'unknown tomato fungus' to the list.  I'm trying to be as proactive as possible in preventing the problems I can this year, and keeping them from being a continuing issue next year."

Once I hit that, the water starts seeping into the hole. If I dig it wider and deeper past the 4 feet, that's how much water is stored. You can line a hand-dug well with fieldstone. Use the same principles as an archway, where the weight of the stones only pushes them tighter together.  When digging a well big enough that you have to stand in it,, always use something to keep the dirt from covering you if it collapses. You can get one of those galvanized culverts instead of stones."

homestead,39ke0u,UltimateShipThe2nd,2,Fri Jun 12 10:43:07 2015 UTC,"Dowsing:       Dowsing is a type of divination employed in attempts to locate ground water, buried metals or ores, gemstones, oil, gravesites,  and many other objects and materials without the use of scientific apparatus. Dowsing is considered a pseudoscience, and there is no scientific evidence that it is any more effective than random chance.    Dowsing is also known as divining (especially in reference to interpretation of results),  doodlebugging __ (particularly in the United States, in searching for petroleum ) or (when searching specifically for water) __water finding, water witching (in the United States) or water dowsing.  A Y- or L-shaped twig or rod, called a dowsing rod, divining rod (Latin: virgula divina or baculus divinatorius), a ""vining rod"" or witching rod is sometimes used during dowsing, although some dowsers use other equipment or no equipment at all.

homestead,39g5pi,nanofarm,11,Thu Jun 11 21:26:55 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry, fire is one of my biggest fears.  Someone else mentioned reptile heat and I wanted to second it.  Reptile uv makes a infrared heat projector that is very safe.  Coupled with a seed starting heat mat under it provides plenty of warmth and is very safe.  We also use 55g drums cut on half for heat boxes, cut a lamp sized hole in the top and suspend the lamp with wire so it can'tossibly fall in.  Cut a doorway and the chicks can go in and out.  This holds the heat in so you can use a lower watt bulbs.    These make Great Warming huts for goat kids, quarantines etc.  I got the idea from another homesteader and wanted to pass it on...hope you don't mind."

homestead,39g5pi,magpie-birdie,0,Fri Jun 12 04:30:33 2015 UTC,"oh yes, lets ignore the lessons here and get on with the personal attacks, what a good way to do things.  Yes the poor bloke feels shitty because of the losses, but wallowing in self pity and throwing a pity party wont help things in any way.  The best that can happen now is to work out how to prevent this from ever happening again.  OP didnt just lose some birds in this, it also looks like they've lost a decent amount of equipment in the fire.  So the lessons MIGHT be:     Remove extraneous equipment from the area   Use a thermal cut out and relay to shut off the lights at a certain temp   Use some form of monitoring if possible (smoke detector etc. won't help the birds but might have reduced collateral damage.)   Homesteading is brutal, the lessons are harsh and only rarely do you get a second chance. It's a DAMN expensive lesson, one which self recrimination and pity will do nothing but make harder to learn."

homestead,39g5pi,lordofthefart,5,Fri Jun 12 03:16:46 2015 UTC,"So sorry this happened to you, at least the barn is not a total loss. Though that's probably cold comfort right now...any farmer who has ever lost an animal knows what you're going thru.  If you go this route again, here is our fire-proof set up: we use metal stock tanks and all heat lamps are triple wired for safety. That means they're clamped, then I use electric fencing wire or metal clothes hangers to set up 2 'backup' hangers. (Usually to a pipe or something else that's fixed above the tanks.) Typically one length gets slipped thru the vent holes of the shade and then is twisted up around the pipe while the other length is wound around the ceramic connector on the back side of the shade, then up and around the pipe as well. Washed construction sand makes an excellent bedding material and the chicks will eat it for grit; it helps prevent pasty butt as an added bonus. Is it more expensive to start up than a cardboard box or kiddie pool? Maybe, but I'm terrified of fire because we keep our brooders in the garage. Also, you can clamp a bit of 1/8"" hardware cloth to the front of the lamp with stainless steel clothespins - this will help with floating feathers (that can also catch fire).  So sorry for your loss. When animals die its tough but know you're not the first, nor the last farmer to have learned through loss. Homesteading is a much more visceral experience than that of our urban counterparts - the highs are sweeter and the hurts really sting, because we are right up close to the dirty business of birth and death and all of the chaos in between."

homestead,39ht80,moonpurr,2,Thu Jun 11 21:46:48 2015 UTC,"Cotton is a heavy feeder, but it won't scorch the earth or anything. It's just a plant that needs a lot of nutrients, like corn. I don't know anyone having monetary success with just growing plants unless they're doing something like running a small strictly organic cotton farm and selling to specialty fiber mills. I do know one group that does hand dyeing with indigo. As you're noting, the hard part isn't growing the plant, it's the processing, and how much money can possibly be made from it. If you can handspin, dye, and market yourself well I've heard there's possibly some money to be made from animal fibers, but even then it takes time to build up a business.  If you're in the US, look up what your extension service has to say on it. Something like this - http://cotton.ces.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/HowCottonGrows.pdf  or this  http://extension.psu.edu/plants  They exist to help people grow plants, raise animals, and become more self-sufficient. They do research to figure out what works best in your area (or wherever you plan on being), so I highly recommend checking them out. You can also contact them at the county level and ask questions. If you tell them you're interested in starting a small textile business they're a good starting point for suggestions and area connections. Hope this helps and good luck."

The bigger apples we planted started producing 3 to 5 years ago, the smaller ones still have not.   i live in Vermont, and the soil we planted on was not amazing.  your location may have better results, but most apple tree variants will take around 5 years to produce, assuming you plant the tree in its second year.      waiting a year to plant an orchard is far less of an issue than waiting a month to plant veggies.  :)"

homestead,39g9zu,iffygibson,3,Thu Jun 11 15:00:23 2015 UTC,"I would suggest easing into it slowly, yes, so you can find what works for you and what doesn't. Homesteading is a set of activities and a mindset of more self-responsibility and self-sufficiency, and thus not really tied to any particular plot of land. You can begin becoming self-sufficient where you are now, and then transfer and expand once you get to where you are going. Interestingly enough, during the Soviet and Argentinian collapses, due to food uncertainty, a large percent of the population either took up community gardening projects or more rural homesteading out of necessity. Good luck."

I can tell you, there are 3 kinds of iron that to the untrained eye would all materialize the same way. Each have dramatically different ways they can be treated. Hence why water treatment is not something you can crowdsource the knowledge on.   Source: I used to be one of those professionals that would come out and test.

homestead,39fx9b,joelkarl1,2,Thu Jun 11 15:44:45 2015 UTC,"Great idea.  You'll probably need to chlorinate the well from it sitting, and the bacteria levels will be artificially high from being able to fester down there.  After the well test, I'm guessing from probably the inspector or local municipality, you'll still need to contact a residential water treatment company.   Think about it this way, if you take a city water bill for 12 months a year and then for 10 years, you're spending a lot of money to get that city water that's already treated. With a well, you have a high upfront cost to treat it yourself, be your own water plant, but then no water usage bills for life."

It does work for the taste and will prevent the galvanic corrosion we would otherwise get in the copper pipes. Expensive to set up but pretty low cost to maintain.

homestead,39fx9b,superkoop,2,Thu Jun 11 19:14:29 2015 UTC,"Do be judicious about using treatment systems.  If you have hard water such that it's a genuine problem, then deal with that.  But you'll also likely have other well tests as well, and people are going to want to sell you shit to deal with every little result. In particular, you'll likely be told that the presence of any amount of bacteria in your well constitutes a desperate, immediate health threat that requires remediation.  It's just not true.    Germophobia is a billion dollar business in the US; Americans are only too happy to pay for untold gallons of chlorine to bleach the bejeezus out of everything.  Just use common sense.  If you bought the house from people who drank the water and didn't die from dysentery or grow a tail, you need to ask yourself whether there's a real problem, or just a marketing opportunity.  You know what they don't test wells for?  Pesticides.  Industrial pollutants.  Here's a rule of thumb for well tests:  If no one manufactures it (and so can't be held liable for it), and someone can sell you a treatment for it, it's A SERIOUS HEALTH THREAT.  If someone manufactures it (and could be held liable for its presence in groundwater) and there are no marketable products to remove it, then no one gives a shit about testing for it."

homestead,39di2u,TheBlackHive,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:51:34 2015 UTC,"Well it depends, were those the pesticides they were testing for? Chemical determination tests are usually very specific to a single chemical. ""Pesticide"" is a very wide category.  My understanding is that something can be labeled organic while still using certain pesticides, most of which are actually older and more dangerous than modern pesticides.  It also depends, I'm sure, on where the organic food in the video was sourced from. If it's locally-grown small-farm organic, it's probably not had any chemicals used on it. If it's mass-produced organic, it may have."
homestead,39di2u,lowbread,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:47:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, agreed."
homestead,39di2u,elongated_smiley,5,Thu Jun 11 06:20:29 2015 UTC,"I'm personally surprised so many pesticides were present at all. So yeah, it does surprise me. And whether or not the pesticides are toxic to me, I would rather not ingest them until I know for certain their long term effects. Considering how little we understand of epigenetics and whatsuch, I can see no harm in reducing consumption of products with unknown effects."
homestead,39di2u,xconde,2,Thu Jun 11 07:33:19 2015 UTC,It might be referring to the common misconception that pesticides can be just washed off by washing fruits and vegetables.  Note: I'm at work so I have not watched the video yet.
homestead,39di2u,wwfl,5,Thu Jun 11 06:38:33 2015 UTC,I'd be more concerned if we ingested the pesticides and didn't pass them...

homestead,39di2u,mortenlu,14,Thu Jun 11 15:46:08 2015 UTC,"While I favor organic farming for the improved overall environmental impact, as far as I know large amounts of pesticides are still used on organic crops. They are different, naturally derived pesticides, but they are poisons nonetheless. Also, because of the limitations on which pesticides they can use, organic foods often have to be treated with larger amounts simply because those that they can use are less effective.  This idea that organic foods are pesticide free is a fantasy, it's just not true. I strongly suspect that what they did here is only test for synthetic pesticides, rather then all pesticides, and so are guilty of cherry picking data.  This video is a targeted advertisement for a business, it's goal is to coddle and placate people, to tell them what they want to hear, and then to associate the business with that pleasant feeling so you will want to give them money."
homestead,39di2u,AfrikaCorps,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:02:31 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I know a lot of certified organic products are kissing cousins with their non organic counterparts. Look at something like spinach from a giant organic farm in California. The benefits of that organic practice is negligible when considering the overall practice involved in bringing the product to a supermarket in Northern Alberta.  Regardless, the video is sharp and spreads information that might not otherwise be spread. I never would have thought that a family would ingest so many pesticides, especially in a european country. Whether or not those pesticides are harmful to their metabolic processes is up in the air, but this information is still relevant for anyone wanting to avoid consumption of those specific substances"
homestead,39di2u,mortenlu,0,Thu Jun 11 07:26:44 2015 UTC,"Can I ask why you favor organic farming? It has lower efficiency and uses much more land to produce the same amount of food as conventional farming. We need to make MUCH more food in the future with growing populations and economics, and we need to limit land use. That does not go hand in hand with organic food.  Also, what is the improved overall environmental impact you reefer to? Are the organic pesticides less harmful to the environment?   I am not very knowledgeable about these issues and would love to hear your take on it."

homestead,39di2u,mortenlu,-2,Thu Jun 11 16:58:52 2015 UTC,"If organic practices proves better, just implement it into conventional farming. What's the problem?

homestead,39di2u,mortenlu,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:56:31 2015 UTC,"You just ignored what I said. Lots of the restrictions with organic farming is counter productive to that goal, as you can't use all the tools in modern agriculture to maximize yield. To feed a world, that means you need to destroy more wildlife. The same does not apply to solar power.   I know there are lots of things that can be done better in conventional agriculture (and with every other human endeavour) with regards to environment, but how is limiting technology the way to it? It's completely asinine!"
homestead,39di2u,AfrikaCorps,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:39:17 2015 UTC,"limiting technology the way to it? It's completely asinine!    I feel you have literally no idea what unsustainable means, here's a hint, you can't feed a world unsustainably, conventional agriculture cannot feed the world forever the same way fossil fuels cannot run transportation forever.  That's like saying ditching combustion engines is limiting technology.  Organic farms and garden actually have higher yield, you can garden enough food in 1/10 of an acre for a family, that's higher than anyt other conventional farming method, why isn't it more widespread? It's work heavy.  Why is ""work heavy"" not a problem in 20 years? Automation."

I don't for a second agree with your premise (that conventional farming is like oil), but I don't need to, to agrue it."
homestead,39di2u,arthurpete,2,Fri Jun 12 03:53:40 2015 UTC,"You are framing the argument as if organic is simply a naturalistic fallacy.

homestead,39di2u,mortenlu,0,Thu Jun 11 19:50:43 2015 UTC,"There are many organic standards that all differ from one another. Though I don't think it's wrong to say that the naturalistic fallacy is a key part that most of them pretty much adhere to (there are exception where synthetics are allowed, but usually very few and only certain circumstances). The idea might have been to preserve ecological balance and conserve biodiversity, but the whole idea now has turned into catering to the naturalistic consumer with no regard to what is actually best for the environment.  Can you tell me what other key points are there in organic farming that most of the standards do?"

I mean seriously, you give me shit for admitting that I am not knowledgeable about a subject, but you won't even respond to the fundamental point of my argument against organic farming. I know I should not have been presenting my argument in absolutes (on the other subreddits), but it was done in frustration over shit like that disingenuous video, presenting organic farming as this great thing.

homestead,39di2u,crackedchinacup,7,Mon Jun 15 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"First, tell us why we need to make ""MUCH"" more food when currently the U.S. wastes 40% of all the food we grow, which amounts to roughly $165 billion. Seems like efficiency is lacking in the conventional model.   Second, sustainable farming does not use the non renewable inputs that conventional farming uses. Creating all this nitrogen to fertilize conventional crops is energy intensive and requires  non renewable natural gas to do so. This natural gas also requires some questionable extraction methods that has its own host of environmental impacts.  Thirdly, conventional agriculture and its excess nutrient load is responsible for a whole other set of problems. Excess nutrient runoff impacts water quality downstream. Loads of phosphate and nitrogen create awesome environments for algae and when algae flourish then dissolved oxygen in the water drops creating a state of hypoxia...a situation where plants and animals are impacted. Drinking water supplies are disrupted and local economic activities that rely on a healthy ecosystem are impacted. The Dead Zone in the Gulf is glaring example.  I can go on but these are just a few points that you can chew on. Also, you claim you aren't knowledgeable about the subject but your post history indicates that you are clearly against organic farming.

That doesn't mean that I don't have huge holes in my knowledge about chemistry, environmental science and farming. I'll be the first to change my opinion if I am presented with solid arguments and evidence. I never studied any of it and much of what I do know could be fallacious. I have only been into researching and debating this on and off for a few years. The poor arguments from the organic proponents is probably the main reason for my opposition to it, so please believe me when I say I want to hear good arguments against my position.  So: Why do you assume that ""we"" means the US? Our environment spans the whole globe and the largest changes in population and economic growth will happen in Asia and Africa.  How is food waste in any way exclusive to conventional farming? This happens everywhere in every stage. Production, processing, retail and by the consumers, and it happens for many different reasons. Surely reducing waste would have a positive effect on the environment, but how is it relevant to the discussion?   About nutrient pollution, this was a subject that I was ignorant about. Though the issue seems very serious, it is very hard to assess the scope of the problem from reading about it.

homestead,39ayqw,biophile6,3,Thu Jun 11 18:06:12 2015 UTC,"Here is info from a Mexican Kiva loan doing just that, for a Systema Biobolsa. See below and http://www.kiva.org/lend/885644.  Miguel is a Mexican farmer who owns a few cows and hogs. He sells his cows' milk and fattens hogs to sell their meat, while also cultivating corn on a field close to his house, with which he feeds his animals. He used to pile the manure up outside his farm, where it was emitting greenhouse gases and contaminating underground water sources. Through the purchase of the biodigester, Miguel will be able to treat his cows' and hogs' waste and take advantage of it to produce his own biogas and organic fertilizer.  His household will no longer rely on smoke-producing wood nor costly LP gas to supply the family with energy to cook and heat water. Furthermore, the bacteria inside the biodigester produce nutrient-rich organic fertilizer, which Miguel will apply on his field to increase the yield of his corn in a sustainable way. As he produces more corn and saves money by displacing fossil fuels, wood, and chemical fertilizers, Miguel will be able to buy additional animals to increase his milk and meat production, while protecting the environment. This loan represents 24% of the full cost of the biodigester. The remaining part is being covered by a government subsidy.  Sistema Biobolsa is a distributor of small-scale, affordable biodigester systems that transform livestock waste into organic fertilizer for crops and biogas for cooking, heat and electricity. The company also provides farmers with education and financial assistance to help them use biodigesters to save money and improve their quality of life. Sistema Biobolsa’s loan program began in early 2011, built on the fact that economic savings made possible by biodigesters could be used to pay back loans. However, because the company’s core business is not microfinance -- and because its partnership with Kiva is unique and unprecedented -- Kiva is unable to assign it a risk rating."

homestead,39ay5y,moonpurr,5,Wed Jun 10 14:54:40 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that undiluted clove oil can not only burn skin but have a numbing effect. Always use a carrier oil.

It's a fantastic combination that smells good and works for quite awhile if I'm not sweating profusely in the Hawaiian sun. I do reapply every 6 hours as needed."

homestead,39ay5y,moonpurr,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:27:17 2015 UTC,"I do mostly wing it.   Jajoba oil is a good carrier for sensitive skin and is a good match for the human pH. Coconut and olive oil are as well. I find that both of those increase my suntan working outside and jojoba isn't as intense. I also find jojoba to feel better on my skin, like it can breathe better.   In order from most to least is essential oils of geranium, lemongrass, rosemary, wintergreen, clove and cinnamon.   I'm not a personal fan of wintergreen but it's effective in bug repellant. You can tweak the overall recipe to add more of that if desired.   Cinnamon and clove are listed as essential oils that have high potential for skin rashes and possibly burning skin if undiluted.   Clove oil is fantastic for numbing tooth pain and teeth related issues. I personally dilute it if used for anything.   On another side note there are a few essential oils not recommended for pregnant women and some cautioned for those breastfeeding.   http://www.thankyourbody.com/essential-oils-pregnancy-nursing/  Essential oils are amazingly powerful for many applications. If using on a person I always recommend the skin patch test. An example being that I personally get contact dermatitis to even small diluted amounts of tea tree oil.   Also notable that some folks with tree nut allergies have had negative reactions to macadamia nut oil, almond oil, and some but lesser in argon and shea nut oil used as carriers or even added ingredients in skin care products."

Be prepared to have a few underripe things picked, and some plants trampled, but it's all worth it.  If you can find a job near where you want to live, go for that.

You can learn just as much by doing for yourself, or if you live in a or near a rural area look for seasonal work where you can learn and get paid at the same time.  If you don't live near a rural area just start by getting your hands dirty. Grow something, even if it's just in a pot. Practice making cheese, maybe get some chickens.

By the time we retire them, we will have held back a few breeder females to replace them, and purchased or traded one of our males for a new stud.    In the meantime, I see that plenty of Silver Fox breeders do well selling retired breeders as pets or for show (those that are show quality), seeing as they are still a very rare breed.  I'm not sure if tough, ancient rabbit meat would be very palatable, especially if we are used to eating the good stuff."

I'd imagine after a year or so would be a good time to slow cook them to make them palatable, sort of like an old hard hen in the chicken world.  Is there any benefit to keeping a breeding doe alive for 5 years? I haven't read anything about doing it this way. I would think they slow down on reproducing or at bare minimum start producing kits with some birth defects from malnutrition.  I know with my goats, it is ideal to give them a break from kidding in order to replenish their nutrients. This is why I try to keep more than one doe."

homestead,396a8r,ndt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:59:27 2015 UTC,"Understandable, but after a certain point they become too much of a hindrance. I myself don't generally like the idea of hunting for things that I will not eat however coyotes and raccoons can be such a big menace that I hate them.  Raccoons are also a pain in the ass. They're smart too, which makes trapping them and relocating them harder. We once put a can of tuna in a trap and checked it the next day. Tuna was gone, no raccoon. Found the can near an irrigation ditch about 20 feet away. We reckon that one raccoon held the lid to the trap open while the other one grabbed the can. They had gotten into the chicken coup once and killed about 20 chickens. Somehow got in but wasn't able to get out. Little bastard died red handed.  Coyote hunting is scary if you try to call them in. The first time I went coyote hunting we had a coyote caller that was literally the sound of a jack rabbit in distress.  Using the caller to attract them you could hear a pack of them get closer and closer as their calls were getting louder and louder but they never showed themselves. It may have been for the best... I swear it sounded like there was ten of them and there were only 3 of us... haha. We suspected and had evidence coyotes got to one of our white geese on the property and after that it was game-on."

homestead,396a8r,I_COULD_say,7,Wed Jun 10 02:51:40 2015 UTC,"Well, you got to look at the source.  The Humane Society, an organization that is explicitly anti-hunting says.   These killing programs don't work and are inhumane. Better solutions exist.   A top agricultural university (UC Davis) says:   While coyote removal often results in a void that is quickly filled by coyotes moving in from surrounding areas, this does not mean that coyote removal is ineffective in reducing or stopping damage. Coyotes moving in to fill a void may have different travel patterns and preferences for prey, thus reducing conflicts with humans, pets, or livestock. Recent research, as well as decades of practical field experience, suggests that removal of dominant coyote pairs at the beginning of breeding season may substantially reduce predation on livestock for up to a year. Removal of coyotes from a population may result in more resources being available to remaining coyotes, thus increasing litter sizes and pup survival. However, coyote removal does not result in higher coyote populations over the long term, as numbers are largely regulated by food availability.   Source: Coyote  Now you might not think removing the coyotes is acceptable and that's fine, but to go so far as to say it does not work when done correctly flies in the face of the evidence.  Who are you going to believe?"
homestead,396a8r,xPersistentx,2,Wed Jun 10 08:16:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting this.  On one of the hunting facebook groups I follow a discussion broke out regarding hunting coyotes and one of the members who has a lot of wisdom and who I highly regard mentioned that studies had shown that hunting them grows their population in the long run and since it came from them I believed it.  Anyways thanks because now that I see the source it's definitely making me question it and I'll have to do more research.

The joy was that the bobcat who moved in once the coy's were gone killed all our ducks twice as fast, and forget about hunting the thing unless you want to take two weeks off from work.  Motion controlled noise alarms... move them around occasionally.  If you catch them in the act, shoot over their head, or some bird shot in the butt, they'll learn.  Let the chickens out after 9 or 10 in the morning, lock up at dusk. This worked for the foxes, eliminates 90% of our predation problems. They don't seem to come out until after dark, but seem to hunt into the morning... letting them out too early can cause problems around here.

homestead,396sf2,dakitchenmagician,3,Tue Jun 9 18:51:53 2015 UTC,I read that you should have at least two beehives so if one doesn't get through the winter you can split the other one.

(I've got a mini-aquaponics setup in my apartment with goldfish).   I'm still probably 10 years from being able to afford it though.

These homes will horseshoe out from a caretaker house. This is where the two old couples in the family and the adult fully disabled family member can live, independently, yet with 24/hr care. Additional tiny houses will be for family visiting and/or living there. The tiny houses would not have full kitchens, would have full baths. The caretaker home would have a full kitchen.   It would be awesome if maybe the family area was down a hill or around those trees....in other words, let's make it super easy for me and mine to get to the older family, but not so easy that I can see them ;)  I want a greenhouse, large outside garden, orchard, chickens, barn, and a livestock field.   Gonna need a spot for the outside toys, so a long pool house with the pool on one side and sports field on the other. To one end will be a dirt R/C track. The pool house will have a tall roof, with a large loft for sleeping and a roof deck. Oh, can't forget about the husband's garage....I promised him a lift and room for a few cars.

My specialty in this case is fruit horticulture and winemaking.  I have enough land to grow a couple thousand fruit trees, and I've already gotten started with about 250 in the ground.  Making wine from the fruit allows me to add value via additional effort and skill and condenses all of my hard work into something that is portable and desireable in the marketplace.  I love my farm, and perhaps I have delusions that others could also love it too...to that end I hope to operate an inn or event center on the property.  It's large, with a great view and in close proximity to some major population centers...yet it's also rural and feels secluded.    So I guess my homestead is a mixture of farm, manufacturing and service industry.  Not everything we consume comes directly from the land, but we generate value and wealth directly from the land...and that (hopefully) can be enough to completely sustain us.   Edit:  Some nuts and bolts because you guys seem to like specifics.    Pacific Northwest, maritime climate.  Elevation at about 300-400 feet facing south over a very fertile river valley, with mountains in the distance.  Almost 40 acres - 22 protected woodland/wetland with about 1000 feet of perennial creek frontage (fish bearing stream).  The other 16-18 acres is pasture with a few additional scattered old growth maple and cedar.  The soil is gravelly loam, sandy and well drained in terms of air and moisture.  We have owned the property for going on six months but I already have 1/3 of an acre deer-fenced for a fruit tree nursery.  I have 75 two year budded apple, pear, quince and cherry trees.  I also planted 150 additional apple and pear rootstocks and grafted over to cider and perry-pear varieties.  The neighbor runs cattle on the (presently) surplus acreage.  We'll break ground on a barn and cider house sometime next year."
homestead,396m0e,---annon---,3,Tue Jun 9 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"short answer: realtor.ca  long answer: Years of investigation into what type of area we wanted to live in, what kinds of plants would grow there, zoning regulations, soil conditions, etc.  We considered several different areas of the western half of the country, from coast to mountain valleys to plains.  Along with all of this went years of work on a career path that wouldn't leave us reliant on the homestead to produce enough income to pay the mortgage.  Once we had our finances coming close to being in order and our research had narrowed our search down to a target area, we watched land prices and sales for a year or so, seeing what was coming up for how much.  We networked and talked to people in those areas, or who knew more about the area.  Places that looked nice turned out to have water issues (wells pumping up from the declining aquifer, for example) which would have been expensive complications if we hadn't found them.  We narrowed things down to a smaller area, then spent a couple of years heading up on long weekends and vacations.  We met people in town, chatted, got to know other homesteaders at the farmer's market, met local business owners and city council members (at the folk music festival, of all places).  With that networking, we found out what areas had which soil conditions, what grew well where, and what the local market was like.  At that point we shopped for a local realtor in our target area who set us up a list of relevant properties that come up in our price range.  We contacted a second realtor to help sell our city home, contacted the banks to verify funding, and started the (fairly standard) process of buying and selling homes."

homestead,396m0e,_Bellis_perennis_,2,Fri Jun 12 21:10:27 2015 UTC,"No problem - I needed a lot of convincing.  I grew up on a homestead that pretty much failed - once the kids moved out my parents sold it and moved back to the city.  I hated the work in the garden, and that there was nothing to do as a kid other than read and, when I was older, bike over to a friend's house.  However, I've lived in the city for 15 years now, including some of the larger cities in my country.  I've had a chance to travel for work, and see other large cities.  I'd rather raise my kids in a place where they can see the stars on a clear night.  And that was one of the impetuses - I grew up in an area where, on a clear night, you could see the entire milky way.  I want that for my kids.  Another was the resilience, and the food security - our grocery bill is going up constantly and by the time my kids are teenagers, I want to be able to grow most of our food.  Now that I've learned more about aquaponics and permaculture systems, and I understand how they work in principle, I'm eager to put them into practice.  I'm a DIY electronics guy and am really looking forward to building kit to help us out - it's a new and interesting challenge."

She knew it was a search for a long term property, but that we were serious about buying and not just wasting time. She was very understanding. You have to be honest with both yourself and the realtor. If a property is off, tell them why. Be specific. That way they can help you out.

I had it happen last month when I got something for a guy's starting bid; he made up a bogus issue he ""forgot to include in the listing"" and ""didn't feel right selling it to me"" despite me saying it wasn't an issue.

I think the biggest issue is that it might be a scam to get earnest money when you back out because of the state of the property etc. It'd you're only losing a few hundred $$, then must likely you're not going to take it to court or fight it as that costs more than the loss.

homestead,390f2e,ranchyranch,56,Mon Jun 8 09:50:26 2015 UTC,"Bought 20 acres in the south west USA for $250/acre in a relatively isolated and remote area. There is a town of about 500-600 about a 25-30 minute drive that has all the basics (hardware store, post office, small grocery store, gas station, etc) and a larger (but still small town, like 7,000 people I think) an hour or so in another direction.  Even though there is no local utility services for power or water. Even though there is zero cell phone signal... there IS a fiber internet line that runs near the property!!! There is a networking POP building for the local ISP not even 1/4th mile away and their buried fiber line borders the property and the local ISP has confirmed a stupid low install fee. Because I work from home the internet availability is the only thing that is making this worthwhile for me.  So, right now there is nothing. Just a couple wild burros (http://i.imgur.com/VkFSRSU.jpg) living on the property and some normal desert brush.  Later this year I'll be having a small 10X20 cabin delivered that I will (roughly) finish out. I'll be applying a thick radiant barrier paint to the exterior to reflect that awful heat, will be insulating the interior and doing a rough interior finish. Not gonna be fancy because it's just gonna be me, a cat, and a dog. It's a temporary shelter.  200 sq/ft itself isn't very large but this home is temporary. It will have an outdoor bathroom and shower so most the space will be dedicated to an office, sleeping and storage. Most the cooking will be done outside as well as I don't want to heat the house up with a propane stove to cook a steak or eggs. This is a temporary home base until I can finish a earthbag home elsewhere on the property. The earthbag home will be larger, but still modest in size. (About 600 sq/ft)  There is no shortage of sun in this region and it's rated very highly for it's solar efficiency and will be powered via solar though will be supplemented (lightly) by the presence of a small wind turbine just for some night time charging when capable.  Water isn't that bad of an issue in all reality. Most folks in the region simply collect the rain water. On the roof of a 200sq/ft cabin I could expect to collect over 1,000 gallons a year (give or take) based on the average rainfall of the area and factoring in loss of efficiency. This isn't very much in the grand scheme of things and plan on installing (at minimum) two 1,500 gallon tanks for water catchment. One I will pay to have filled with nearby well water (too deep to drill in my area and the water is salty/not that good anyhow) and the other will be left to collect rainfall. The total that I can harvest will increase significantly once the earthbag house is completed with it's larger roof/catchment area.  Proper homesteading of the land will actually be a bit limited but (I am planning on raising some animals eventually) the big thing I want to do is have a raised bed greenhouse. Have had success in the past growing in the desert everything from tomatoes to corn, spinach to lettuce in a different region and look forward to growing some good food  there as well.  Anyhow, I'm excited to be moving forward with this. If you would have asked me when I was 18 years old, where I'd be when I was 25 I'd have told you I'd be doing something similar to this. That was always the idea. Having just turned 27, I didn't meet the 'deadline' (so to speak) but am going to be turning 28 on my homestead, so that's pretty cool.  I work for a large-ish IT company from home and manage some of my own projects on the side so this is possible due to the internet access that is available to me (partly due to luck) as otherwise I would be limited to very costly, slow and unstable satelite internet which would likely result in me being unable to effectively do my work from home.

homestead,390f2e,farmerjane,26,Mon Jun 8 10:16:42 2015 UTC,"..you'll be needing more water, even only for your own consumption.  There are often water delivery companies who can bring by thousands of gallons. I wouldnt suggest getting 1000 at a time for drinking, as it starts to taste funny after a while - it picks up taste from the air and container.  Even with 3000 gallons you'll have an incredibly difficult time -- Arizona averages 100 gallons per person per day. Trying to live on 10 gallons of water a day is going to be difficult, even if you get creative with recycling. But good luck, I'm interested in how you accomplish this! Another piece of advice - skip the wind turbine. Desert areas often do not get enough wind to make it worthwhile.  Most turbines want to start at 10-15mph to produce a tiny amount of energy.  In many desert areas the wind is far lower - ~6mph or less, with spikes during storms to 100mph or so. Trouble is, the light weight turbines get destroyed in the higher winds.  Instead, I suggest investing in more batteries, a few additional solar panels (which you can manually rotate to face the sun) or even a small generator."
homestead,390f2e,rcrracer,6,Mon Jun 8 12:29:53 2015 UTC,"Good tips on the water, though I'll have a pretty thorough (but suprisingly basic) filtration system setup and will test and treat the water as needed. A good video on the filtration method I plan on copying is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKayMx-edQ  Very good video, thorough and detailed.  The idea is that I'll originally fill a 1,500 gallon tank with purchased water and get the other one setup for rain fall catchment. Even if I start to get low, water isn't a giant concern as it's both cheap and available in surplus by neighbors. Lurking the mailing list for the locale (yes, Yahoo mailing list...) and tuning into some Facebook chatter from those in the area many have a surplus of water and have been giving water to free for those who can come and pump it out.  Another thing is that I can go into town and get free 20 gallons of water per day/visit and pay something like $0.05/gallon after that. I also buy bottled water as drinking water because I hate the environment (apparently) so hauled in water and catchment will be for cooking/cleaning and recycled for grey water for use elsewhere.  I mean, I work from home. I won't need to shower each day anyhow. Can get clean enough in a short 5 minute shower which would be the largest consumption of water. Water for cooking, general cleaning (hand washing, to wet the tooth brush, cat/dog bowl, etc) won't be that large.  Water is certainly something to plan accordingly out there but not in short supply or hard to come by. It may not rain a lot but people do a good job at capturing what they can and those lucky enough to have wells (you gotta drill stupid deep) are usually happy to share. There is also a water business in town selling water and have trucks equipped to haul it to you as well.  Regarding the wind turbine: I'm still not sold on the idea of even having one. The idea appeals to me simply for the learning aspect of playing with wind power and to trickle charge the bank at night... not so much for it's high energy output or anything. Though I am really sort of going to be over building the solar system simply because I don't want to ever have a period of 'not enough' power. A 'home generator' will also be tied in, still doing research on those though. I want to be able to switch to generator power with relative ease if needed, though the idea is to overbuild and under utilize the array and bank just for the sake of having the power surplus and to have it when I want it for power hungry days where I may be video or photo editing on the power hungry desktop workstation versus the 'light workstation' that uses 1/3rd less power.   Lots of things to consider for sure."

homestead,390f2e,Spunelli,8,Tue Jun 9 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"Seconded on the water. Even small adjustments to the landscape like furrows, swales, ditches and ponds can make a huge difference in how much water stays on the premises in the earth. Regarding rainwater catchment, consider having a few outdoor structures like an outdoor kitchen, workshop space, whatever and having them all function as rainwater collection. Maximizing as much surface area as you can while still using a minimal footprint. Water is probably the most vital & limiting factor in creating a homestead where you are -- if I were there, that would probably be my first priority."
homestead,390f2e,toxicityj,2,Mon Jun 8 16:32:40 2015 UTC,"That's the plan. Most people in the area tend to have large roofs over there actually houses which does a couple things. The big thing it does is provide good shade to the house underneath which keeps it cool but also gives a big catchment area.  There is a dry stream on the property and when it rains it does fill with water and holds water for a period afterwards too. (See: Wild burros living on property). According to the animal tracks and poop on the property it's safe to assume that coyotes, rabbits and deer have been passing through or drinking there as well."
homestead,390f2e,farfaraway,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:23:00 2015 UTC,"Also use your solar array as water catchment. Since space isn't an issue, you can have your panels on a metal frame sitting on the ground and not on the roof of your house. Could easily get another 400sqft of surface for water to run off of with those. Having the panels lower down also makes it easier for you to occasionally wipe the dust off them to maintain efficiency."

I would love to have a greenhouse but we have a tiny yard where we live currently.  We keep our garden covered with sunscreen material so the sun doesn't burn our plants. My husband has a few hydroponic set-ups and they grow wonderfully.   He is an herbalist and when we go on herb walks it's amazing the amount of native plants we collect and turn into medicine.  I'm not very familiar with Earthbag construction but if you can I would dig down 2 or 3 feet for your floor. I know the groung is hard but even that small amount will help so much to keep the house cool in the summer and warm in the winter. We have tile set right on the slab and it is nice in summer and in winter I put down rugs. Have a long overhang on your roof. Our roof overhangs about 4-6 feet and it really helps keep the heat out and we still get a ton of natural light through our windows.    I've seen some really neat bicycle powered washing machines and gas powered wringer washers. I would love to have my own wringer washer even with our soon to be 6 person family. You can wash so much laundry using such a small amount of water. Beware of leaving clothes on the line all day,  I have seen the sun start to considerably fade clothing after as short as 4-6 hours which is great for your whites.   I would consider building a solar oven. I often cook with my normal kitchen appliances outside.

You should get a 350 gallon truck water tank like this: http://www.plastic-mart.com/db_images/pm/ace/truck/350_gallon_pickup_truck_water_tank_pu0350-62.jpg And every time you go into town fill it up and when you get back dump it into your main tank. I have a well and use about 40-50 gallons a day very nicely. But with my misters on (you'll want misters) you'll want another 40-50 gallons a day. You can shade cloth and run misters and be in heaven outside during the day.  Bedsheets work as shade cloths and catch the extra mist from the mister, and then evaporate through the white cloths for extra and for keeping the mist out of my face.  Also if you do computer work from home you can get your power usage down to very little. An Intel NUC i5 takes about 15watts. A LCD monitor takes about 25w.  I bought a Sears minifridge that uses 45watts. And right now I am running an air conditioner that uses 450watts.   My entire budget is about 400-500 watts. You could easily do that with some of those Sun Electric 435watt panels right off the bat. Could be used to charge your wireless power tools. Get an 1000w inverter for the truck for backup and/or running water pumps."
homestead,390f2e,masterm,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:11:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Actually my laptop + second monitor system that includes external nice speakers run me at about 35 watts. Lets call it 40 watts.  I work for 9 hours a day, M-F. This is a set schedule. Let's say I have the laptop on for 12 hours a day. 9 for work, 3 for whatever. This is probably higher than what my actual usage will be.  12X40 = 480 watt-hours max. That alone isn't very much at all.  Actually, the system I am -hoping- to build will be between 700-1,000 watts of panels. Lets say I only have 600 watts of panels outside, get 5 good hours of sunlight a day that's a max output of 3,000 watts. I'm using the lower end of numbers here for wiggle room obviously. That is more than enough to power my internet needs. Things like a router and other small equipment won't use much energy. I literally watch maybe two hours of TV a month. I've got a 32"" LED TV that uses comically little power. A small window AC unit honestly doesn't take that much either. LED lighting, like 4 watts a bulb.  I'm honestly planning on overbuilding the solar system because I don't want to ever be in a position where power is a major concern of mine. I want to know that I have adequate electricity to power the devices I must have use to do my job which is relatively limited, even if it's cloudy for 10 days straight and the panels don't produce much. To do that, I'll have a big ol' battery bank, AKA the money pit.  Small chest coolers/freezers are very effecient and many models can run on propane. I'm still looking into what I'll use for food storage but the general consensus is that it won't be a major hurdle. I do know I'll be opting in for the chest-style setups as they retain the cold much better."

I know that is a difficult thought, but keeping cats in the desert is hard.  The coyotes think they're delicious, and they can't be confined as easily as small livestock, like chickens. When I lived in suburban west TX, cats that roamed at night tended to go missing, and my friend who lives in (very) rural NM has stopped getting cats because every one she has had over a period of years has disappeared, and it broke her heart. She brought them in every night, her SO's an expert shot, and she always has 2-3 cat friendly big dogs, but she still had horrible luck. Something to think about."

homestead,390f2e,Bigfrostynugs,2,Mon Jun 8 17:31:40 2015 UTC,Haha. I actually recently bought a cat harness and leash. She won't go outside. When I go out the front door she stands on her hind legs and looks out the screen door for me but as soon as I start walking back towards the door she runs away from it. If I hold it open for five minutes she'll just stand at the edge of the house/door and sniff the air but won't go outside.  The harness didn't fit and she hated me for trying to get it on her. I wanted to introduce her to grass and bugs and stuff but it's probably best she doesn't go outside here. I'm still living in town and my yard is maybe 40 feet by 80 feet of grass or something and bordered by a city street and an alley with idiots driving fast through it.

homestead,393jhe,Wriiight,7,Tue Jun 9 00:22:24 2015 UTC,"My partner and I have been homesteading in Detroit for about three years now, and I wouldn't do life any differently!   Cards played well, the cost to buy in is relatively low, there's space to grow your own food, the community is extremely welcoming and supportive of such endeavors, and you get to live in a city with an incomparable music and art scene. There are challenges to being in the city as well, but writing off Detroit generally at this point is just lazy. What people seem to point to as a ""lack of city services"" in some neighborhoods honestly just means that it feels like living in the country, which is sort of the charm for some anyway. (City services have improved drastically in the last 3 years and continue to do so, to boot.) Homesteading in the city is also a good stepping stone, I think. It's been an excellent place for us to learn how to be effective homesteaders, where we can still have the luxury of buying groceries if we need to and riding our bikes to see a band play or to an outdoor movie night."

homestead,38wnwx,rufil-dixon,5,Sun Jun 7 13:45:00 2015 UTC,"What a great list. I'd have to say that I disagree with numbers 3 and 4 but the rest of it is really solid advice.   Number 3: The hydrogen peroxide the author is using, and any hydrogen peroxide sold for topical use at the drug store, has impurities that can do great harm to your soil. Additionally, using hydrogen peroxide is a short cut that isn't really helpful so much as  less harmful. Hydrogen peroxide will kill all of the good bacteria and fungus that you work so hard to encourage. Oxidation=death. It's better to out compete the bad microbes by adding and encouraging the good microbes. If a fungal problem does get out of control, then hydrogen peroxide like this (Hazardous material. Read precautions on label carefully) can be very useful to return your soil to a neutral state from which you can reapply beneficial microbes.  Number 4: Many seeds do much better if never transplanted. Peas, beans, and corn especially. Plants grown directly from seed in the ground may start slower but in 12 weeks will have caught up to or even surpassed the growth of transplanted seeds. There are many seeds that do better if started indoors early(nightshades, brassicas, aliums), but very few that appreciate being sprouted in paper towels and then planted. Radicles (the first root that pops out of a seed) are extremely fragile and any damage done early on will result in a weaker plant and reduced harvest. The cost of seed for a small to medium garden is very low and can often be split between friends or neighbors. Sure, use last years seed if you must, but don't try to use seeds that are any older than that. Rather than try for 100% germination rate from last years seed, just plant extra seeds in each space and thin them as they grow larger. You almost never see a farmer plant last years seed, because it is not economical. Rather than hold on to extra seeds each year, donate them to a school garden or community garden.  With all of that said, I should reiterate that this is a great list full of really helpful tips."

homestead,38xj0f,realeyes_realize_,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"Solar tracker:       A solar tracker is a device that orients a payload toward the sun. Payloads can be solar panels, parabolic troughs, fresnel reflectors, mirrors or lenses.  For flat-panel photovoltaic systems, trackers are used to minimize the angle of incidence between the incoming sunlight and a photovoltaic panel. This increases the amount of energy produced from a fixed amount of installed power generating capacity. In standard photovoltaic applications, it was predicted in 2008-2009 that trackers could be used in at least 85% of commercial installations greater than one megawatt from 2009 to 2012.   However, as of April 2014, there is not any data to support these predictions.  In concentrator photovoltaics (CPV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) applications, trackers are used to enable the optical components in the CPV and CSP systems. The optics in concentrated solar applications accept the direct component of sunlight light and therefore must be oriented appropriately to collect energy. Tracking systems are found in all concentrator applications because such systems do not produce energy unless pointed at the sun.

If you're setting them up on the ground and not the roof it shouldn't be hard to rearrange them. Maybe you should buy them, wait until you're forecast for a week of sunny days, then try a different arrangement each day and track the results? Then report back!"
homestead,38xj0f,jelliknight,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:52:38 2015 UTC,"It's almost always sunny where these are going. The idea is that one or two will face more or less direct East at an angle that will capture that sweet morning light as soon as it comes up over the horizon. The same for the west facing ones, minus for the setting sun.  I still want the bulk to be facing south but the majority of my usage comes at night. I work from home but I still have a 'set schedule' that I must abide by Monday - Friday which leaves me working from around midnight to 9AM. The East facing panels is to start re-charging the batteries as early as possible.   I'm still trying to work out the exact details and power needs to build out the system."
homestead,38xj0f,InformationHorder,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:29:15 2015 UTC,"The only way I could see pointing them any other direction but solar south having any impact is if you want to optimize power output during different times of day. For example, if you use more power in the morning or towards the evening due to when you're actually home you might benefit a little from a slight SE or SW adjustment to maximize your output to match your consumption times ($/KwH from the grid goes up after 3pm to reflect this). But if you're already on full batteries, then you're better off charging them as efficiently as possible throughout the day with a solar south arrangement and saving them for nighttime use.  There comes a point where you can aim your array right at the sun all you want, but once the sun starts going down and angle of insolation goes down with it, you're not getting much return on the effort. For example, the two arrays you have angled due east and west in the second picture are being wasted for most of the day, and aren't doing you much good at their own peak.   According to the graph in this wiki article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_tracker you can be up to 45 degrees off and still only be losing 30% efficiency. But beyond that it goes up logarithmically. So those two you want to dedicate to being 90 degrees away form the sun for about 80% of the available daylight hours are operating at a huge inefficiency for 80% of the day, and then only working marginally well for 20%."
homestead,38xj0f,idratherbgardening,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:50:39 2015 UTC,"Are you planning on micro-inverters?  If not, I thought all panels need to be facing in the same direction for best output.

homestead,38xj0f,cortijoman,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:40:44 2015 UTC,I would point them all due south.  Solar trackers are more expensive and will break down and have maintenance issues. Rather than spend money on solar trackers just get more panels. You should only have different sets of panels pointing in different directions if each group has its own charge controller. Then you have to spend more money on charge controllers. So just spend all your money on panels pointing south and maybe a little more on batteries so that the energy collected at the peak time of the day pointing directly south is stored properly.

Mostly city people who decided to try their hand at homesteading near or just before retirement age -- people in their 50s and 60s. As you can imagine, they did not tend to be very successful at it... though perhaps not for the reasons you'd think. In my experience -- and it isn't a huge sample size, maybe a half-dozen or so people -- late-blooming homesteaders were not hampered by their age or inexperience, but for their inability to learn, or perhaps the desire to take risks. I've observed a tendency in older people to approach new tasks too cautiously -- again, not in the physical burdens they take on, but the scale and seriousness of their homesteading endeavors. That's just a personal observation.  Basically, short of severe physical handicaps, there is nothing outside of you that will put you in a ""junior league"" -- not age, or experience.

Oaken logs, if dry and old, Keep away the winter's cold; Poplar gives a bitter smoke, Fills your eyes and makes you choke; Elm-wood burns like churchyard mould, E'en the very flames are cold; It is by the Irish said; Hawthorn bakes the sweetest bread, Apple-wood will scent the room, Pear-wood smells like flowers in bloom; But ash-wood wet and ash-wood dry A King may warm his slippers by."

homestead,38j4u3,ethidda,11,Thu Jun 4 20:21:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, pine does not directly contribute to excess creosote build-up as long as it's aged, just like hardwood.  It burns hot and fast and is good to mix in with hardwood.  Potential for over-heating if burned alone.  I'm not sure where its reputation for creosote came from. It is not efficient in terms of work required to heat your house, but if you need to get rid of it, it will do the trick. Avoid rotting wood.  Some cedars can give off fumes you wouldn't want to inhale, so not great for indoor or outdoor use."
homestead,38j4u3,I-be-pop-now,12,Thu Jun 4 20:29:22 2015 UTC,"I burn pine almost exclusively.  6+ cords a year.  Why pine?  Because it's what's prevalent and easy to get to in my area.  Would I rather burn a harder wood?  Absolutely and when I can find larch or locust etc I take it, but it doesn't make sense to expend hours of time and energy looking for better quality wood when I can have all the pine I could ever want and it's literally right in front of me."
homestead,38j4u3,MrBungles,9,Thu Jun 4 16:27:04 2015 UTC,"Pound for pound, all DRIED wood produces the same amount of heat. Cord for cord the same amount of creosote. If you heat your home with only pine it burns FAST and hot and doesn't weigh a lot. So you have to reload your stove a lot more and since it burns hot and fast it's kinda difficult to control. And you'll go through 3 times the volume. Since you put 3 times the cords through, guess what? 3 times the creosote. No big deal. Just sweep the chimney every year. Higher temp burning helps with creosote too.  People love oak because dried it's very heavy and burns very slow so it lasts a long time in the stove. Ash you can burn basically as soon as you cut down the live tree. It's medium heavy and very very easy to split by hand.   I burn everything I find. Overnight and when I'm at work I try and only burn hardwood. When I'm home I burn any pine or softer woods. When I have the fire very hot while I'm home I burn white wood like tulip poplar. It smokes terribly unless the fire is nice and hot."

I hate to disagree with /u/I-be-pop-now, but try to avoid pines and resinous woods, as they create more creosote.  Anecdotal proof:  I have lived in houses with wood heat for my entire 32 years.  every year that there was pine in the woodpile, we noticed significantly more buildup when we swept the chimney in the spring.   that said, if you have dead-fall that you need to clear away anyways, burn it all.  Any wood will produce more heat than no wood.  burn  the pine too, just know that it creates additional buildup."

My brother came in the room and said, panicked, ""mom, there's something wrong with my face."" Only one side of his face would move. He had a Bell's palsy. We took him to the hospital and they ran a bunch of tests. They gave him a spinal tap. The diagnosis was lymes meningitis. The lymes disease had caused him to Have meningitis. He was in the hospital for at least a week. Maybe more. I can't remember. Fortunately he's fine.  The other story is about my mom'a cousin. He wasn't as lucky as my brother. My mom told me that he had been feeling really sick and had been going to the doctor. They couldn't figure out what was wrong with him either. He was feeling really achy and didn't have any energy. He was suspicious that it was lymes but the doctor was sure that it wasn't and wouldn't test him. This went on for a while. I don't know how long but judging from the consequences it must've been a long time. Eventually he got text ex for lymes and he was positive. He'd been right the entire time. Unfortunately it was to late. The damage was permanent. He had no energy anymore. He's in his early fifties and otherwise healthy but he has the energy of somebody in their 70s.  Lymes disease is a real threat and if you think you have it get tested. It's rare, so I think doctors brush it off but don't let them, because it will fuck you up."
homestead,38gm82,Flatfooting,5,Thu Jun 4 05:44:55 2015 UTC,We have some doctors in my area who insist there is no lyme disease around here. I knew someone who died of its complications who had never been out of the area. :( I don't know why they are so resistant about taking it seriously.
homestead,38gm82,wibblebeast,2,Thu Jun 4 12:54:04 2015 UTC,"This is really sad, but reenforces the notion that you must get a second opinion if your doctor refuses to simply test for something.  Hell, testing for lyme's is just a check on the blood test form from the doctor.  Why the hell wouldn't he just check it?  Also, there are a lot of places that specialize in lyme's.  If you feel like you have it and your doctor won't test, just go to a place that specializes in it."

And given the huge differences considering the sources in estimated numbers of unreported or misdiagnosed, it almost seems like a conspiracy. There isn't even a single test accurate enough to be sure of a result, be it positive or negative.

Alfalfa meal can come with weed seeds, so a plan is required.  It's best applied and incorporated in fall. Because of it's perfect ratio, 2-1-2, you really can't apply too much.

Since Cuba was blockaded in the 90s, there has been a complete stop of petrol, one of the main components necessary to produce artificial fertilizers. The blockade has also stopped the import of pesticides, which we are finding out more and more are the main reasons for lower brain barriers in bees that allow the mites to enter into their brain and destroy the colony."

homestead,388504,buddythebear,6,Tue Jun 2 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"I think this is a wrong analysis of the situation. Organic farming is what saved the Cuban people during the US led blockade. Like most agri businesses after world war 2, the country became dependent on chemicals and petro-fertilizers. Without the infrastructure in place to produce organic fertilizers, the calorie intake of the Cuban people dropped extremely low. It was the organicoponicos of Cuba that saved the people. I don't think you can pick out a under developed country that doesn't have these same problems that also has access to the world wide market of synthesized pesticides and fertilizers. As far as food price, the food market in Cuba is the only real free market for food in the world. The government doesn't heavily subsidize food the same way the US and other developed countries does, so the high food price is the real market price. For a country that had to completely revamp their agriculture system in twenty years, I'd say they have done a great job, and the flourishing of organic farming should be praised and not dismissed."

I think it is also worth reconsidering the fallacy expressed against agriculture that there is no discovery for price implying all farmers are subsidized when in reality only a small concentration of the owners receive these benefits so we can have cheap corn by-products. http://www.uspirg.org/sites/pirg/files/reports/Apples_to_Twinkies_2013_USPIRG.pdf  I can't speak of any personal experience with the industry in America but the broad strokes used to paint the world of the 21st century does not represent the economy we have in Canada.  If anything we are exploited by Foodland Ontario more so than them adding anything productive or helping the process at all.
homestead,388504,emfyo,3,Wed Jun 3 01:37:18 2015 UTC,"I do think that Urban farming in Detroit, and other cities, is something that should be praised. These individuals are taking control of their food source and able to ensure that they do not starve. Yes this movement has sprouted from poverty, but I think that shows how important a movement like this is.   As for the subsidizes that are given to farmers, yes there is a large proportion that is given to corn producers and not vegetable and fruit producers in the form of a direct subsidy. That being said, most Americans (I really can only speak to America and Cuba as these are the forms I have studies in depth) eat very poorly as they can not afford the high price of fresh produce. Even without a direct subsidy, most farmers receive a subsidy in the form on a tax break at the end of the year and as cheap water that is heavily subsidized in the US. Yes, it is the corn farmers, and thus meat and junk food producers that receive the largest subsidizes but all farmers in the US receive subsidizes that are built into our infrastructure. As for Cuba, most of what they are given by the government is education on how to farm in a sustainable way.   You will have to explain more to me about the exploitation of Foodland Ontario as I am intrigued by what they are doing in Canada.   I still think that we shouldn't criticize Cuba for the implementation of their permaculture techniques. They have developed a system that allowed for mass production of food on little to no synthesized fertilizers or pesticides. There might be flaws in the system, but that is everywhere. What they do have is access to fresh produce which has a much higher nutrient percentage than most food produced in the rest of the world that was picked long before it was ripe, flash frozen, and delivered to consumers as empty calories."
homestead,388504,LlhamaLhama,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:37:15 2015 UTC,"Organic is not synonymous with permaculture.  Up until a certain point all farming was done organically and that did not prevent practices harmful to the environment and short shortsightedness from exhausting the land, as well as limitations in the primitive technology that allow for sustainability today.   This is purely an argument of rhetoric based off my subjective view as I have not analysed any data from Cuba so I hope I am not speaking out of turn.  I want to also address the last statement you made.  While I'm skeptical of the claim made of the quality of Cuban produce I must contest this widespread claim that ""food produced in the rest of the world that was picked long before it was ripe, flash frozen, and delivered to consumers as empty calories."" as it is both a bleak and false perception of the market we have in North America at least.   While modern processing (i.e curing and refrigeration) now allow for certain crops like apples or potatoes to be stored for long periods of time, in general, conventional produce is not flash frozen in shipping.  I can't think of many if any products that would be in the produce area of your super market that fall into this category as most would qualify as fresh produce all of which retain their full nutritional value, certainly not something to consider 'empty calories.'   Food produced in the rest of the world that was is picked long before it was ripe   Yes, some foods ripen after they are harvested, such as bananas or peaches and a variety of other fruits and vegetables."

homestead,388rrg,blackbutters,2,Thu Jun 4 21:54:47 2015 UTC,"Aloha, thanks for the reply.   It's surprising that more folks in Southern California are not growing Macadamia nuts. Started by seed they can take 5-7 years before nut production. They average 30' high and about 15' wide here at maturity.   We have over 40 Mac nut trees. They are spread about over our acreage and not in a grove or orchard. We primarily grow them for evergreen shade canopy for our coffee and other understory plants/trees. We also use the husks and nuts for soil building. A lot get fed to wild pigs. Quite a lot get hand harvested and used in candies and cookies sold at my aunties shop and the farmers market.   The market fell for Mac nut prices and now they are not as hot of a commodity as they once were. The labor involved to hand pick a burlap sack full is quite intense and the average is $10 a large sack.   Many farmers here opt to hire someone to harvest nuts off of the ground for them. Others hang hammock nets to catch them. At times we have let folks come and gather the nuts for a cheap price per bag they take.   We do hand harvest from the ground. We have a Mac nut husker that we can run them through and then hand crack the shells. It's quite a lot of work honestly.   The trees themselves are fairly low maintenance. They get pruned as needed. The leaf litter texture is similar to a holly bush. Hard, very prickly and dry. Expect a fair amount of leaf litter. The nuts sprout quite easily here and the saplings get pulled annualy. The leaves are great for compost, lasagna gardening/sheet mulching, soil building and mulching. Just prickly.   I'm more interested at this point in buying an oil extracting machine and making macadamia nut oil.   A lot of folks use the husks for compost, soil building and mulching. The rotten nuts or those eaten by worms are also fantastic in compost piles.   And a few words of caution, rats adore Mac nuts and nesting in the trees. Some folks have very bad allergies to the blooming Mac nut flowers.   The avocados have yet to produce a worthwhile tree that's pleasantly edible as far as wild sprouted.   We have over 20 mature producing avocado trees that were planted intentionally for food crops. Roughly 10 that are pollinators and get pruned very hard once every 5 years. About 8 that wild sprouted and were left to produce. All of those 8 produce more avocados than you'd imagine. Again, a lot of that is used for soil building and a shade canopy for coffee. When we need to bait wild pigs or when we have had the pigs kept in a pen, there's a lot of avocados.   When it comes to avocados I'd recommend buying a mature grafted tree. Waiting over 6 years to get a watery, stringy and round avocado is a huge waste of water, time, space and care.   I highly recommend the Kahalu'u butter avocado. They are huge, creamy and one tree after maturity is a fantastic resource as a side business selling to local culinary enthusiasts, chefs, CSA's, farmers markets and even health food stores.   Research some of the plants I mentioned in my original comment to see if they'd produce in your zone and elevation. As well as looking at water requirements. If anything interests you I'd be happy to save seeds and mail some to you as they ripen. I cannot mail fleshy seeds or even avocado pits. Aloha!"

I get mine from the GarlicStore.com  if I don't have enough leftover from last years crop or if I want to do something different.  The can point you to the best variety for your zone.

I think garlic in the grow tent should work out fine (right now, the only thing in there is three cannabis plants and a sweet potato I am trying to grow slips from).  I tried some earlier herbs, but they have all since died before ever getting too large... and I think that is mostly because of the extremely small pots I've been trying to grow everything in (since my largest pots were prioritized for my cannabis)."

Use good potting soil and mix a little fish emulsion when you water the plants and they should do well."
homestead,383eps,middlegray,10,Fri Jun 5 00:15:00 2015 UTC,You didn't say how much space you had our what your climate is like but as a general recommendation :  Goji berry.  Raspberry. Honey berry.  Japanese wineberry  Rhubarb Gooseberry.  Currants.  Lingonberry.  Hardy kiwi.  Corn Asparagus. Walking onion Welsh onions.  Strawberries( wild & alpine) Saffron.  Jerusalem Artichoke.  Globe Artichokes.  Mooli Radish  That should keep you going- I didn't list many herbs but they'd be good too.
homestead,383eps,manwithgills,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:25:24 2015 UTC,Currants and gooseberries might require a permit depending on the area.  (Especially near commercial pine forests where white pine blister rust could pose a serious threat..)
homestead,383eps,urbn,8,Tue Jun 2 13:28:18 2015 UTC,"We can only work on the planting every couple weeks for a day or two because of remote location. Just wondering if there is anything thing else that is easy that people would suggest.   Have you looked into food forests at all?  The idea being that you plant layers of plants (7 in total, I believe) to mimic the natural forests found in your climate.  You choose the plants to take care of each other.  A self-sustaining ecosystem, if you will.  I've seen people have very prolific food forests with ~2x month maintenance, and some people will only do a big maintenance day a few times a year and still have enough to feed themselves."
homestead,383eps,fidelitypdx,7,Tue Jun 2 01:08:44 2015 UTC,How about pole beans? Asparagus will come up year after year. I would also plant rhubarb.

homestead,383eps,5steelBI,5,Tue Jun 2 03:37:15 2015 UTC,"Berries. Lots and lots of berries. Then, trees. Trees require a bit of pruning but are overall very low maintenance.   I also like Kale and Lettuce. If you give them a large patch they'll go to seed and volunteer next year just fine.   In general, you should look for self-sufficient systems such as the ""food forest"" concepts advocated by permaculture schools of production. Individual crops always need maintenance, but you can build up an area to provide a relatively sustainable low-maintenance food production zone if you plan correctly."

homestead,383eps,kibitzello,3,Mon Jun 1 19:15:59 2015 UTC,"Corn, actually. Especially if you plant the squash around the stalks, to keep the critters off. Rhubarb, asparagus, berries, beans. Potatoes, if you get a hardy type. I can never keep my hands off the potatoes, and wind up eating all the fingerlings and having nothing for stew in the fall.   Is the area fenced? If not, you might want to section off a smaller fenced area for the more attractive plantings. I used to plant some deer treats 100 feet away from my fenced garden. They're lazy, and won't jump a fence if they don't have to."
homestead,383eps,Eight43,3,Mon Jun 1 22:45:13 2015 UTC,"Radish are super easy and will help the soil. Heck, you don't even have to pick em if you don't want to, just let them grow up big and then either rot or seed.  Lots of people use radish instead of clover or winter rye as a cover crop, partially because radish is such a good N fixer, and partially because they help break up the top layer of dirt, making it super easy to plant whatever you want in their wake.  Most radish take 45 days to grow to harvest size. I have three radish I let go to seed since I liked how quick they grew and the size of the root. Two months in and the seeds are almost ready to pick."

homestead,383eps,gingerjuice,2,Tue Jun 2 01:13:51 2015 UTC,"Turnips are super easy and don't require lots of attention.  A few weeks after planting, thin them to 4-6 inches apart.  A few weeks after that, you can harvest some green if you like turnip greens (don't worry, it won't hurt the root development).  Then a few weeks later, harvest your turnips :)  You do need to make sure they when you plant, you have a good bed with nice loose soil and plenty of organic matter (compost), but if you plant them in good dirt they really don't take any work."

homestead,38342k,Piles_Hussein,3,Mon Jun 1 21:28:56 2015 UTC,"This tool is for measuring and marking the mortises and tenons.   All measurements are done from one side of the timbers as timbers are never exact in size.   With a tool like this placed on the reference face of the wood (generally the outside edge)  you then measure in say 2"" from the face on the tool,  mark a line,  then another line 2"" further on.   Now you have a 2"" guide for the mortise.   The intersecting lines are generally drawn with a speed square.   Without this tool you have to measure and mark with a tape or square,  then turn the square to the marks and draw the lines.  Overall it's just easier with the tool.   I'll post a few pictures in an a few minutes.   Sorry I'm more of a visual person when explaining.   Edit 1:  Recommend this book also.  http://www.amazon.com/Timber-Frame-Construction-Post-Beam/dp/0882663658  Edit 2:   The tools I used were a 1.5"" framing chisel, a 3 3/8"" slick (chisel), a corner chisel.  A speed square and/or L square.  The tool above.  A 10"" circular saw.  Hand saw.  I had a chain mortiser as well.. which is so very very very nice to have access too.  Otherwise you have to use a drill to hog out the mortises first, then clean up with the chisels.    Chain Mortiser: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=U0dfPdIQJv4#t=388 (note in this video the red triangles.  This is the reference face for the measurements.)

I also planted some red clover - red because its more cold hardy than other varieties and its lower to the ground. So i can walk through it and not feel like i need to check for ticks.  Edit: Don't make the mistake i made the first time. I lost 10 lbs of seed the first go-round. I didn't own a lawn roller, and spread seed when there was supposed to be 3 days of consistent rain. The forecast changed and i couldn't get water out there. The seed baked and turned to dust after  a few days of hot sun.  I seeded again after i figured out a way to get water to that section of the yard - (its 400ft from my house), used a lawn roller after seeding and the germination is now through the roof. its about an inch tall at the moment - can't wait to see the first flowers."

homestead,383jjd,gratefuldiver,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:39:53 2015 UTC,"I have used American meadows many times.  The quality of the seed is great but you really must:   thoroughly remove existing vegetation keep the area moist the first two weeks   If you can get water to the site and have a few portable sprinklers keeping the ground moist is not that difficult.  However, depending on whats growing there now, removing existing vegetation can be more difficult.  Depending on how you feed about glyphosate (RoundUp) you have two options to remove existing vegetation.     The glyphosate option works like this:   Spray as directed Wait one week Remove dead vegetation Water area thoroughly Wait two weeks (or until you get good weed germination) Respray as directed Repeat steps 4 - 6 until you get very little weed germination.  Takes me 3 passes but I have a crazy weed soil seed bank. Sow wildflowers and keep moist first two weeks.   My preferred all natural option works like this:   Cover area in 3 mil black plastic Wait at least 8 weeks Remove plastic and remove dead vegetation Water area thoroughly Wait two weeks (or until you get good weed germination) Burn weed seedlings with weed burner Repeat steps 4 - 6 until you get very little weed germination. Sow wildflowers and keep moist first two weeks.   The natural option takes longer and is more expensive but on the plus side no worrying about glyphosate running off and hurting the frogs and you never feel as much like Godzilla as when using a weed burner."

Related species in the genus Myrciaria, often referred to by the same common name, are native to Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Peru and Bolivia. The tree is grown for its purplish-black, white-pulped fruits; they can be eaten raw or be used to make jellies and drinks (plain juice or wine). Other common names include Brazilian Grape Tree, Jaboticaba, Jabotica, Jabuticabeira, Guaperu, Guapuru, Hivapuru, Sabará and Yvapurũ (Guarani).

homestead,37r0j1,metricoclock,3,Fri May 29 20:42:33 2015 UTC,"Get the book Trailersteading by Anna Hess.  It's a great resource about the benefits of downfalls of buying a trailer or mobile home and fixing it up to meet your needs.  Seriously it's well worth the $6 for the book.  I'd have said getting a trailer was a bad idea until I read this book and realized how many benefits there are to getting a trailer/mobile home.  While a trailer may or may not be the right solution for your situation, but a lot of people are quick to naysay buying a cheap trailer/MH just because it sounds low class/like a bad investment/whatever fill-in-your-prejudice-here.  There really are a lot of upsides to going the trailer/MH route.  Anyways, get the book and see how you feel about it after you've read it and considered what Hess (who lives in a trailer she and her husband got cheap and had moved to their land) and her friends and family who went with the trailer-route have to say about whether they think it was ultimately the right decision for each of them and their own situations.  Your decision, ether way, will be much more educated than just ""well a bunch of people on Reddit said I should/shouldn't without knowing my exact situation"".  Also, you can check out Hess' blog http://www.waldeneffect.org/ where she writes about the homestead she and her husband have been running for 9 years in the VA mountains.  You can use the search function to find articles she's specifically written about modifying and repairing their trailer over the last decade.  Good luck!"

As to deadly methods, you'll have to be very selective in your neighborhood.  Bodygripping traps, and poisons are out due to the potential of getting non-target animals like the neighbors cat or dog.  Shooting won't work either due to safety.  That leaves you with live traps.  You shouldn't relocate a raccoon if you trap one (and it's likely illegal as they are a rabies vector animal).  So, with the live trap, you have 2 choices for how to kill it.  1) fill a garbage can full of water, dump the cage with the raccoon in it and use rocks or bricks to keep it submerged and wait.  2) put the cage in a box or bag and connect it via a hose (dryer vent works) to the exhaust of your vehicle.

I hiked up the sides of the yurt (mine was homemade, and small, so this was easy to do) in a couple of places and got a decent convection air current running up through the roof vent. It was still warm, but quite liveable. It was, however, a much drier area than the US Southeast, so I can't speak to how well that would work in more humid areas."

homestead,37i9dc,isaidputontheglasses,4,Wed May 27 20:53:03 2015 UTC,"So, As a yankee I grew up with my dads attitude - ""Stick the seed in the ground, it'll grow""  still holds true for me. and while i've gotten a lot more complex with my gardening - I've simplified my composting/soil attitudes as well in the same way.  Some folks keep an eye on the chemical ""recipe"" of a compost/soil - and I've no doubt they're on to something for folks that love the science of things.  me, however, I'd rather plant veggies and harvest veggies.  so... i'd put your stuff into two different piles - ""Mostly Ready"" and ""Needs work"" - needs work is the brush, shavings, sand, gravel worms, ash and hay/straw.  if you intend to make dirt out  of  these, they need to be broken down and mixed.   Your ""Mostly Ready"" pile is the dirts, clay, manures, and sand (again).  you'd probably be fine to just mix these up in a big ole pile, let them sit fora week, mix them again, sit, mix, and depending on some outside factors you'll be ready w/in a little while.  I've had luck balancing sands with clays , and regular dirt never hurt no garden bed.   Some folks mulch with straw.  My dad used to spread wood ash around the lawn, but here's a quick link to a university in maine about it's use on farms. (and another just to cover some more ground..  I personally, though, have no practical adult experience with wood ash - oh, wait... I do about a fire a year in my duplex - that just goes straight to the compost - and my compost does fine.  Earthworms are great anywhere.  both piles would benefit from them.   The gravel's the trickiest thing you've got, because all that really is is ""rocks"" so your main focus is on mixing them up over large enough compost/dirt mix that they aren't really concentrated at all.  They serve no purpose I know.  Oh, and before I go, I wanted to mention my buddy who was the single most awesome plant-grower I've ever met.   Taught me about peeing in my compost and all sorts of stuff.  His compost could break down things in a few days, easy.  Anyhow, he had a story about living in the city, and he only had  a 1' by 3' ""garden bed"" of dirt to grow in - he dug that  thing 3' outstraight down, next to the foundation of the building ""crammed it chuck full of horse manure"" and proceded to grow some fantastic sunflowers.  Nothing else, he said.  Hope this helps some, good luck!"

homestead,37i9dc,sunpoprain,2,Wed May 27 20:59:33 2015 UTC,Yes you can use those things in lasagna/sheet mulching garden beds. I would leave out the Georgia clay as it may create drainage issues.   Here's a helpful website that will give you the basic idea  http://organicgardening.about.com/od/startinganorganicgarden/a/lasagnagarden.htm  My raised bed gardens are lasagna/sheet mulch layers.

I've seen gravity fed ones that drop water into a barrel w/ big rocks (fist sized), then outputs to another barrell with nugget sized, then on and on till it's been sifted through sand.  that was some solid water.  I think my point here is that instead ofmixing it with dirt and trying to spread it out, you might find some better luck with a specific purpose/project.    Still - Good Luck!"

homestead,37istx,Phriday,2,Wed May 27 23:01:22 2015 UTC,"First, where are you located? Geography plays an important part to finding the right solution.   If possible, don't water at all. Time your planting with the onset of your rainy season, if you have one, and let Mother Nature establish the plants. Without human intervention, most plants will root deeply and become fairly drought tolerant.   This won't work for everything... Blueberries will probably require a bit of extra moisture to produce well. But if you're ok with a lighter harvest from each plant, you make be able to escape watering.   Also consider heavily mulching the plants, which will minimize water requirements. See the Garden of Eden video for details.   I successfully planted an orchard a couple years back mid-winter and have never watered them, despite unusually dry conditions in our area. Sure, I lost a couple trees, but they weren't a high enough quality to survive on their own. The remaining trees and shrubs are doing great and already fruiting heavily.  Good luck!"

Some vendors give credit for things we send back to them but generally if it can't be donated (almost everything can be), it is either sent for rendering or composting. We throw out so little.

You have to sit around for anywhere from 2-5 hours and then they give you one or 2 kitchen sided garbage bags depending on the size of your family.  Inside the room there are volunteers storting out the rotten and moldy items and the rest get put on tables. You can pick out whatever you want.

Plus, more private food going into shelters means less public money spent on homeless/poor support.

homestead,37c2yw,dickwhistle,2,Thu May 28 12:16:06 2015 UTC,"That's right, there would be costs associated. But private charities would take that cost out of the public sector outright, and in a public shelter situation, it's still cheaper in the long run than simple disposal. Even if the state had to buy entirely new trucks, it wouldn't have to pay for wages because the drivers would be volunteers.   Serious question: are you even reading my posts? Because I agree with you 100%. Government has no right to tell anyone what to do with their property. I stated that from the very beginning. All I'm saying is that this particular bit of legislation would lower the tax burden, and I stand by that statement. I've never claimed that that justifies it."

homestead,37c2yw,AtticusWeiss,1 point,Tue May 26 16:44:16 2015 UTC,"How much would that really cost though? An extra 8 minimum wage hours per week? Maybe? Now take that cost and spread it across every item in the store as a sales price increase. You're looking at a fraction of a cent per item.   And, it's not like the store owner could gripe that they could not remain competitive because every other store has to do this as well.  I actually frequent a well known health food store chain location bi-weekly to pick up spare produce for my livestock. I won't lie to you. My family actually eats some of it too!  Believe it or not, the produce manager thanks me each time telling me ""it does his heart good"" not to see it go to waste. He also donates as much of it as he can to the food banks. He literally has so much that I pick up the extra that the food banks cannot take in.  I also have another story for you:  When I used to live in the city, my family was ALWAYS broke. I used to dumpster dive behind bakeries for bread. The bakeries started to lock the dumpsters. How much would it have cost the bakery to NOT lock the dumpster? Not much I bet. How much to drive all that bread (about 2-4 garbage bags full per night) to the food bank 6 miles across town? Again, probably not that much."

Now they are protected from that liability, but will have to pay for the infrastructure to produce this food and make it available.  Which will drive up food costs.  Which will mean more people have to rely on free food than be able to purchase it, which will reduce food sales, which will drive up costs ...

homestead,37erel,Spunelli,4,Wed May 27 16:34:52 2015 UTC,"I would look at other perennials to plant for food. I have been doing the homesteading thing in different forms from growing up in Alaska before statehood and no power. To the newest apartment/urban homesteading. I have done it while in the army and that was the hardest through all the different deployments and PCS moves. It more fell to my family to do most of the work.   I have a different definition of homesteading where we have a goal to produce 80% of our food. Most of my life My family have been able to be over 50%. Homesteading is about frugality and experience. In your situation I would look at game birds or dove/pidgin adding to your property. Ground is not a homestead but it makes it simpler to grow food and lead a more independent life. Homesteading is different for every one so set goals that you are conformable and move foreword and become more independent. An example is I drive old diesel vehicle that are more than 15 yeas old and am able to fix them in my sleep. I have 2 with 1.5 million miles on them and still on the road. I personally collect ants and other bugs for food and also raise them because for me it is simpler and less work resources like time and feeding. This is more than many homesteaders are willing to do. So go to where you feel conformable.   I also have built my own homes, I am a machinist and developed my fabricating skills but I also have had more time at this than many to develop skills. I am now converting all my machine tools to treadle power and other methods of human power. This is a more advanced skill set but it shows the expanses of what homesteading is.  Your situation is probably that you have a good career and it is more of a place that you will build and grow into more of what people would look at as a traditional homestead. It seem that you have a realistic goal and time to improve what you have. Being debt free most of my life has been another way that has kept me able to do the homesteading during the hard times in the army."

I ask since the other two vinegars would be sticky if you used them as a cleaning agent, and I like to use the ""concentrated"" cleaning vinegar around the house. Yah sure it's still dirt cheap enough to just buy it, but this is just a gee-whiz type of question. Can you control how concentrated homemade vinegar is, or is it assumed whatever you make is 100% which needs to be cut with water to make it not be straight up acid?"

That would get you near 100 percent so then you would cut it with water. That's probably way more work, time, and cost than it's worth unless you're planning on making huge quantities.  You could maybe try fermenting sugar water, but I don't think it would work well due to the lack of nutrients for the bacteria and yeasts in the solution."

Its really just a fancy SMART goal system with more numbers but I've found it really useful for projecting time investment required to do something. It may seem particularly anal, but with a little research it will give you realistic numbers to aim for and, if done thoroughly, will provide you with a step by step guide to get there. I use it to determine potential return on time investment for any project I'm working on. Since you can't do everything, especially if you are working as well, I find it helpful to use this to determine the greatest return I can get from whatever project. For example, I was potentially planning on trying out soap making this year since I've collected a lot of ash over the winter. After crunching the numbers and researching prices, I figured that it would be more cost effective and a better investment on my time if I just bought melt and pour soap loaves already made, nothing fancy, fragrance free. After talking to the soap artisan, I even got a discount for providing the lye myself. All in all, the more details the better. You won't regret it. Cheers and good luck."

We have a house now, with about an acre, which is nowhere near enough to homestead, at least not without disturbing the neighbors. We both have the dream of homesteading, and actually running an orchard/micro-farm for profit as a third income (both will be teachers by this point, I'm still finishing school).  I really think we will transition to that once we are settled into our careers.  Really, the free time in the summer to allow for these endeavors is why I decided to follow her into specifically school teaching (I was going to be working with teens either way).   Have you ever considered zoning out this dream sheet?  As in in typical permaculture zoning (zone 1 is closest to house, zone 5 is furthest away.  Things closest to the house require the most daily attention, and vice versa).  Literally draw, with colored pencils even!, your ideal dream sheet homestead.  The reason I ask is because looking at the various things on the list, they seem disjointed, like a collection of things that just sound good.  Many of those items work together, but many would have to be permanently sidelined in order to achieve a few.  We currently have a garden, three active compost bins, 8 chickens, and am working on a hydroponic greenhouse in our backyard... It takes a lot of attention.

Livestock and pets are not the same thing.  Animals aren't free.  Goats require food, shelter, and vet care at a minimum to ensure they're healthy and happy.  You also have to find (i.e. pay) someone to watch them when you are out of town.    If you aren't deriving value from them and they are costing you money, then yes, there is a problem with that.  I own a small farm, we have goats and I really enjoy them.  However, it's a farm, they have to pay their way, each spring we sell a few newborns to pay for feed for the rest of the herd and milk the females which we make cheese with or trade with other folks who like raw goatmilk.

Even though I went to the doctor and was put on meds about a week after the bullseye formed (and stayed on those drugs for months until I no longer tested positive) the disease created a lot of memory problems.  I recently moved to Tennessee and thought the risk of tick-borne diseases dropped significantly so I haven't been wearing bug spray while hiking or checking for ticks.  I will now.  I don't want to run the risk of getting another disease like Lyme disease again.

homestead,378ngm,frostfromfire,6,Thu May 28 16:03:41 2015 UTC,"Years ago, a friend who was working for the National Forrest Service introduced me to permethrin.  It was what they issued to the guys in the field and it really works.  I used to buy it under the trade names of Permanone and Duranon, but it’s become more common now under several different names.  One caveat, a can that I bought from Walmart was a total dud.  I used to keep a pair of treated shoes and socks on hand for outside work away from the house.  Duct tape is also handy for disposing of ticks.  It can be a real lifesaver when you hit a nest of nymphs or “seed ticks”.  A female tick will deposit a clump of a hundred or so eggs on a blade of grass.  When the nymphs hatch out they stay in the clump until an animal brushes it, then they swarm all over that animal, or you, as the case may be.  I carried a chunk of broom stick with a couple of feet of duct tape wrapped around it."

homestead,36xcja,Dire88,9,Fri May 22 22:09:26 2015 UTC,"If it was just the eye itself that was infected I'd recommend oral and/or topical antibiotics and regular flushing/cleaning of the infected area with saline water. You could give that a try. This post mentions some antibiotics that can be purchased in the US.  http://www.backyardchickens.com/t/477018/bad-eye-infection  However, flailing on its back and having problems walking is a red flag to me, the eye infection may be a symptom of a more serious condition. My immediate concern would be quarantining the gosling away from the other birds, as well as other animals, and humans. Unless you're willing (and financially able) to pay for a visit to the vet, I would take the gosling to a waterfowl or wildlife center or so they can perform tests and assume responsibility for its care (or euthanasia, if necessary).  Just in my experience raising animals, lurching, flailing, falling over, and losing balance is usually a symptom of a more serious underlying condition. And usually, those animals have passed away rather than getting better, while sometimes infecting others.  Generally, if it was just the gosling's eye infection causing imbalance, he would be walking in circles or bumping into things rather than falling over/on their back.  Another red flag is the adult found dead but not eaten. I would bring the adult to the wildlife center as well, just in case. Better safe than sorry. The wildlife center can dispose of it safely."

If you're buying a used pallet, you don't know where it has been and could have soaked up any number of chemicals while sitting on a factory floor.  Pallets have lots of uses for any number of other projects.  But for me the best policy is to not take a chance on any wood that could have been  contaminated in its travels around the country or world.  If you're going to use wood  around your food, just bite the bullet and pay for regular, clean, lumber for contact with food. Cedar is always a good choice since it's very weather & rot resistant and durable in outdoor applications so it'll last a good long while."

homestead,36ocob,into_the_stream,2,Thu May 21 03:15:48 2015 UTC,"Regardless of legal ramifications, generally I feel like a good rule of thumb is ""try not to be a dick"". If the river is commonly used by boaters, and you have a contraption that impedes traffic, then take it down when it's not in use. Also, when using it, make sure it is clearly visible so anyone boating has time to stop.  My husband was kayaking on a familiar river at a good clip.

They're very specific, with a materials list, etc. Their photo gallery section even has photos of my coop that I sent them. I used the same plans to build coops that are half the length of the plans here, too.   If you're building an a-frame coop, it's extremely helpful to have a miter saw. It's difficult to cut angles perfectly without one, and a-frame coops have some odd angles.

homestead,36l06m,omnimoogle,3,Wed May 20 04:02:40 2015 UTC,"Bleach kills bacteria. It is not a surfactant like soap.  Does the fertilizer leach into the plastic?  Also, most 'safe' plastics leach toxic chemicals into the water. They are considered safe due to the amount that leaches over the average time the water will be in the bottle. When you start storing water, those chemicals have the time to reach higher levels. One is also consuming these chemicals at a higher rate than the studies would suggest.  Lots of people do it, but storing potable water in plastic is questionable. I do not know of any major studies that have looked into this."
homestead,36l06m,xPersistentx,3,Wed May 20 11:26:21 2015 UTC,Buy some used food grade barrels instead. Pretty sure if anything besides food was stored in them they can't ever be resold for water/food.

homestead,36l06m,DreamArcher,2,Wed May 20 16:18:11 2015 UTC,Probably not a good idea. It can leach into the plastic and then back out into the water over time.
homestead,36l06m,IronSlanginRed,2,Wed May 20 05:28:46 2015 UTC,"Most fertilizers are water soluble salts.  This means that they probably won't penetrate the plastic much if at all because plastic such as the type used in these tanks are hydrophobic, meaning they repel water and anything that easily dissolves in water.  Watch how water beads up on plastic from a milk jug.   I highly doubt any of the fertilizers penetrated the plastic.  Washing the tank out with hot soapy water once or twice and then rinsing and draining about 10 times with clean water is probably all you need to do to make this safe for holding drinking water.    If the tank held pesticides or herbicides that would be a different story since most of those are oil like which would penetrate and stick to most plastics. (put some cooking oil on a plastic jug and see what happens.)"
homestead,36l06m,gnarlykarly,2,Wed May 20 14:38:09 2015 UTC,"You don't want to use non food-grade plastic to store potable water.  Not only could there be the issue in this case of fertilizer leaching out into your water because they are used, but even brand-new non-food-grade plastics leach the plastic chemicals into water at a much higher rate than normal.

homestead,36l8oh,BernatDonnie,2,Wed May 20 05:22:02 2015 UTC,Can anyone explain what this deep bed method is?
homestead,36l8oh,xPersistentx,2,Wed May 20 11:15:27 2015 UTC,"A random google comes up with a much better explanation than I can muster right now:   The 'deep bed' method, developed in California and championed by the late self sufficiency guru, John Seymour, involves digging deep beds of very loose soil. These beds, once dug, are then never walked on; the loose soil allows for a good downwards movement of water through the soil, rapid downwards movement of air through the soil and allows the roots to grow downwards instead of outwards; thereby creating bigger plants and importantly allowing closer planting. Increased yields of up to fourfold have been achieved through the deep bed method.  Until someone gave me 'The New Self Sufficient Gardener', by John Seymour, I hadn't heard of it either. My garden is rather small, so I figured it might be worth a shot."
homestead,36l8oh,Rocksteady2R,2,Wed May 20 12:35:17 2015 UTC,"a)  not a lot of experience with this intentionally, but I've grown in some non-compacted beds, which is what this kind of sounds like.  b)  I know you can stunt carrot growth by compacting soil too much.  c)  I know you can stunt upward plant growth by compacting soil too much.  d)  so making your beds ""loose"" makes sense - it's why we turn over/till soil anyways.  e)  what I just read generally suggested digging your soil down 18-24 inches, which is definitely deeper than I normally go (12-16), but if you're in a raised bed that shouldn't be a problem.  I'd also expect this to be a significant labor increase, because to do that efficiently, you'd have to remove the dirt from the bed, make sure it's broken up, and move it back in again.  so yeah, definitely doable.  and very likely useful for root veggies and water heavy plants.  I say that, because this reminds me of the older, desert dwelling Indian methods for growing corn where you dig a deep hole, fill it back in2/3's - 3/4 full, plant your seed.  once the plant is about a 1' tall, fill in the rest of the hole in order to keep that moisture in and keep the base rootball  protected from the heat/sun...   Good Luck!"
homestead,36l8oh,OtisB,1 point,Wed May 20 13:18:28 2015 UTC,"This is really similar to what I do, but I've never heard of John Seymour.  We have beds with borders. All beds are double dug to a depth of at least 12 inches, some are deeper. They are never walked on, and after initial digging are never tilled. Mixing is done with a rake or fork. Plants are cut off and the roots left in the ground.  This lasts about 3 years until they compact again. At first I thought this was due to heavy soil and I was about to re-dig, but after adding a LOT of compost, I still see compaction to the point where I can't dig down with my hands. Some compaction is a natural result of rain and snowmelt and just plain old gravity. I don't see this as a problem, because it's not EXCESSIVE compaction. Therefore, I leave it be. And since, I've found that my larger plants still grow nice roots right through the part that seemed compacted to me. Lesson: just because I can't dig through it with my fingers doesn't mean it's ""compacted"" as far as plants are concerned.  So, my take after doing this for 4 years is that if yield is the concern, for most people there is no advantage to this over standard garden tilling and planting. The only exception would be for those who have soils that are already heavily compacted, deep digging will fix that problem. If you insist on walking on it all the time, well then you'll have to deep dig it again in a year or so. Most people who till or plow every year do so because they have to undo the damage they made trampling all over the soil with their feet and equipment. But, if you're looking for this to be a silver bullet to increase yields, you'll be disappointed.  Last summer, in a brand new bed, I double dug the whole thing except a 3 foot long section at the end of it. I planted the whole bed into roma tomatoes. The 3 foot section had been dug do a depth of about 4 inches with a shovel. Below that it was VERY compacted. I bent the tines on my potato fork trying to dig it, so I just left it. The plants that grew in that section did not have any noticeably different yield than those in the rest of the bed. The whole bed had the same sun exposure and was watered with soaker hose.  I still do this because I think it's the ""right"" way to garden, and because it reduces my input in time and energy (no tilling, not much digging), all I do in the spring is rake it off and maybe pop it loose with a fork and it's ready to plant. And, I can tell you that 4 years after first digging, I can still tell where the bottom of the double dug soil is when I shove a pitchfork into it.   Practical tips - keep your beds narrow so you can jump over them and reach across them. Mine are 4x25 feet. If I had it to do over I would do 3.5x12 feet. Constantly walking around the other side to plant or harvest gets old.  Mulch a lot. You don't get to till weeds under, so you can't let them take hold. You have to be really on top of this part. Any weed that goes to seed will be 100x worse next year.  This is very labor intensive compared to traditional tilling and planting. But I do think that it's better, because I don't spend a penny on gas or expensive tools to garden. I have 1600 sq feet of beds, and the only tools I use are a shovel, a fork, a rake, a hoe, and my hands."

The ability to pick and choose and not have to do anything or be a part of a larger system. It means you can live without having to do so on anyone else's terms, and you know what needs to be done without someone else stepping in to help you.  Sometimes that means sacrificing entirely, sure. There just aren't enough hours in the day to make everything a reality. But you can cut most of the strings that people have attached to you."

If you fall back on the grocery store when your crops are insufficient or don't come in, you are relying on someone else.  I think his main point is that we need to get past our own hubris so we can recognize the labors of those around us that we still rely on.

homestead,36emtg,autotldr,1 point,Tue May 19 02:15:47 2015 UTC,"True, you can't ever be self reliant, but you can set yourself up for success should the need arise. I'm no prepper, and this is going to sound prepper-y, but my goal in life is to attain a modicum of self reliance so that theoretically I could expand my self-production of goods to get myself and my family to the point of not starving or freezing to death in the winter. Humans have done it since we first banged two rocks together, but here's the important point of the article:   No one ever had to do it alone. Sure, you could hole up in a cave and hunt deer for a living, but what kind of life is that? There's a difference between survival and living. And with a community, looking to the Amish for example shows how much you really can get done with a couple of families working together.   You'll always be dependent on someone else to make modern life comfortable. But if you make smart choices in what you chose to consume, you can minimize what you'll need to be comfortable. The best example I can think of is how everything is meant to be disposable in the consumer age we live in. I can buy the cheap shitty made in China tool, or I can hunt down a working antique item of known durability and learn to take care of it. If you consume only what you need, and spend the time to find those items that you'll only need to buy once (and cry once if it's more expensive to get the bullet proof one), you'll reduce your needs and your own resource drain on your community. I'm using this as an excuse to find and buy some really good antique tools that I hope will last well past my grand-children's lifetime.   What I hope to see someday, in this age where people are beginning to realize the need and feasibility for renewable energy sources, and where the technical feasibility is finally starting to arrive in full force with companies like Tesla, that this mindset finds it way back to our consumer products again. I want companies to make me stuff that I only need to buy once every decade or two, not every 3-5 years. If we're worried about our natural resources and energy supply, some conservationist thinking needs to be applied to our rampant consumer consumption as well."

That's pretty laughable.  Clothes are one of the easiest things to provide for yourself - you just need to want to.  Nobody wants to, and so nobody does.  It's simply more efficient for some people to provide cotton and some other people to turn it into shirts.  Then a grape farmer can trade grapes for clothes and cheese and whatever they desire.  They aren't reliant on the people that make clothes.  That is simply the more efficient way of doing it - it creates more wealth with less work for everyone.  Promoting efficiency is fine.

Without them, you do not have the good or service you're seeking. I could stop there, but...  2) Not only that but you rely on a state to enforce the contract executed through that trade (to prevent fraud and theft, for example) and to otherwise defend your right to that property.  You need the state.  3) That state is financed by more than just your tax money, and therefore you rely on all other tax payers to enforce the contract you entered into.   4) Through this trade, you gain efficiencies that allow you to accomplish more with less in the future.  This means your antecedent personal individual accomplishments are directly dependent on trade.  You could not have achieved certain subsequent, seemingly personal accomplishments, without initial trade.  5) Therefore, if you're trading with somebody, you're ""needing help from other people"" in at least 4 ways (but more, probably) to a greater degree than if you didn't enter into the trade.  You are, by definition, less self-reliant.   Why? What's your definition of self-reliant?"
homestead,36emtg,Kryten_2X4B_523P,2,Tue May 19 05:26:23 2015 UTC,"I can see his position. A person being self-reliant because they are able to trade their labor for other labor, and thus continue to survive. In this model of looking at it, it's not whether you can do everything all by yourself, but rather can you continue to sustain yourself with your own resources + whatever resources you're able to get using only the resources you yourself have gotten/have available as trading chips .  I think you're both right, but that you (Kryten) are a little more right. Especially because you cop to self reliance being a spectrum when you said...    less self-reliant.    ..rather than being an on/off yes/no kind of deal.  Geofferic, (I think?) is thinking more of the result: am I able to get by given the resources I've got?   Requires viewing the people willing to trade for you as resources which you can use. ...you know. That thing that humans have been doing since we became tribal as a species."

Like everyone here says, a garden will not grow in the middle of the woods. A lot of times, grass doesn't even grow in the woods. There's not enough sunlight. You'd be better off living on the edge of the woods when it comes to gardening.  I don't know if you deer hunt or not, but it isn't easy. The good news is that if you get one, then it'll feed you for a long time. The bad news is that it is common to go on a 3 day or more hunting trip and never even get a shot at a deer. I'd hate to depend on that for survival. Squirrel hunting is a lot easier, but they are so small that you just about need one squirrel per person per meal. That's a lot of squirrel.  The spring water would be awesome. I don't know where you can find a place like that, but having a place like that would be amazing. The vast majority of the time, you will either have to dig a well or depend on lake or creek water and risk Giardia, though. If you have a nice spot in the woods with a natural spring like that and enough land to even have a chance with hunting and growing food and gathering firewood for heat, then that land is extremely valuable.  I live on 40 acres on the edge of the woods. The land is split with one other relative but between us we have about 22 acres of woods, 5 1/2 acres of a small lake, Probably 11 or so that is an open field, and the rest that is a small cleared out area where my house is. The lake is stocked, we are raising chickens for eggs, we have ducks for eggs and just for looks, I have a wood stove, I am putting in fruit trees/vines/bushes, I am putting in a large garden, and I've started composting. I am trying to head in the direction that you suggest, but I am not even close. Everything I've mentioned takes years to get going. Wood for the stove has to be cut, carried, split, and seasoned for a year or two, and you need a ridiculous amount of it if it is your only heating source (it isn't for me). The fruit trees had to be planted and then need to grow for a few years before they start to yield. The chickens and ducks have to be full grown before they start laying. I either need several raised beds or else a large plowed area before I can have a garden that is more than just your typical small home garden. I also need a way to water it because carrying water to the other side of a 20 acre field isn't a realistic solution. The compost bin needs to be filled and then needs time to actually decompose. Then the house itself also needs work because the fact is that it had to be a fixer-upper for me to even have a chance at affording a place like this.  My point here is that it's a lot of work to even begin heading in the direction that you suggest. I like it, but it certainly doesn't happen over night. If you just move out to a cabin in the woods and expect everything to work out, then you will either starve, freeze, or move back to civilization within a year."

I expect a great deal of my diet to come from fish, but I know some days you can be out there for 8 hours or more and get nothing, and some days you can catch over a dozen in just a few casts... so, if you're the fishing type, how often are you fishing and how much do you find yourself consuming?"
homestead,36fi20,animuseternal,2,Tue May 19 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"I bought the place early last summer and only moved in at the beginning of September, so I'm not really supporting myself on the land yet. I have been spending most of my time working hard on getting the fruit trees and garden set up since those will need some time to get established but will be great once they are. I've also been building a large chicken coop and learning to take care of chickens, ducks, and guineas since I prefer a sure thing like eggs over an iffy thing like wild game or fish. We now have 20 chickens, 9 ducks, and 2 guineas but none of them are laying yet. They should start laying sometime towards the middle or end of summer.  The fish have so far been limited to fish fries with the family, but it is rare to fish more than a few minutes without catching something. Whether that something is a keeper or not is hit or miss, but the fish are biting, especially this time of year. My dad caught 25 crappie keepers in a day a while back while throwing back several more because they weren't big enough, but you can fish for an hour or two and easily catch 4 or 5 and a lot more than that if it's a good day. The pond is mostly crappie, but we have caught a few bluegill, sunfish (I don't know a ton about types of fish, but it's basically a bluegill that is orange instead of blue), and bass, and we've caught one catfish but haven't really been catfishing yet. The thing with depending on the fish is that the pond freezes over in winter, so keep that in mind.  For us the whole fish, wild game, and home grown food stuff is supplemental to save money, insulate us in case of a food shortage or even just us being low on money and unable to afford much food, and a fun hobby. I have a day job and we buy groceries, and I don't really expect us to be 100% self sufficient anytime soon. What I hope to do though is to add more every year until at some point we are at least mostly self sufficient. If I were planning on catching fish to survive, then I'd probably do a trot line or try jugging or something as opposed to just fishing with a fishing pole.  As far as hunting goes, I am not that experienced of a deer hunter but I am a very experienced small game hunter, especially squirrels. I can go out in the morning and am disappointed if I only get a couple squirrels. The problem is that, like I said, it takes a lot of squirrels to feed a family. Plus I have to go to work, and I try and keep it legal by only hunting in season. We eat several squirrels in season, though, and if my family was going hungry, then I have no doubt that I could walk out my back door and come back later that morning with a few squirrels. I am also planning on improving my deer hunting skills and learning how to turkey hunt. There are deer tracks all over the woods, so I know we have some. Deer hunting is just so boring compared to other types of hunting, so I never really did much of it growing up. You're just sitting in the woods on a November or December morning freezing and hoping that a deer walks by. Sometimes they walk by, and sometimes they don't.  On my to-do list is to start raising rabbits. They eat grass clippings, fruit, and vegetables, and they really do breed like rabbits. You get a couple and before long you have a whole group of them. You might want to look into that as a dependable food source. Ducks are really easy too. We don't even feed ours anymore because they can feed themselves from the pond. Their eggs are edible just like chicken eggs. Chickens are easy, but we still buy feed from the store for them. I'm not real sure right now what the alternative to that is.  Sorry I wasn't able to give you an exact answer. I'm hoping that in a year or two I will have a better answer."
homestead,36fi20,derrick81787,2,Tue May 19 20:05:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, ice fishing isn't so bad. Just cut a hole, rig an 1/8oz spoon and dangle it with intermittent twitching. But you're correct. Fishing for food is going to be more productive with traps and long lines with several baited hooks (for catfish) than just a rod and reel.  We used to keep chickens, ducks, and geese when I was little, so I'm planning on keeping them too, but I'm hoping that a solid garden and regular fishing trips can keep us fed year-round (I imagine the great fishing days will lead to a lot of fish needing to be either frozen or smoked to preserve'em). Squirrel is likely to be a regular entree on the menu too, but I think there's enough trout in the nearby waters that if we're really hurting, catching at least one in a day is relatively assured.  Thanks a lot!"
homestead,36fi20,animuseternal,3,Tue May 19 20:24:28 2015 UTC,"We freeze our fish and squirrel. I have canned squirrel in a pressure canner before too, but that basically limits you to using it in a soup or stew because the meat is literally fall off the bone tender.  I'm trying to make myself work hard for the first year or two on things that will have a long term payoff like fruit trees and building the chicken coop and stuff with the actual house that needs fixed. After that, I'm hoping for a lifetime of enjoying the garden, hunting, fishing, and raising animals and living off of those things. It seems like there's always more to do so we'll see, but that's the plan.  Anyway, good luck with your plan, and I hope it all works out."
homestead,36fi20,derrick81787,1 point,Tue May 19 20:58:06 2015 UTC,I really want to hear about how you go with this. My partner and I are just starting to put our plan together to buy a block of land and starting trying different techniques and building a shipping container home that is completely renewable energy. Not going to be in the middle of nowhere (we both work in the city) but our jobs mean we don't have to always be in the office.   What was your driving motivation to do this? and how old are you if you don't mind me asking?
homestead,36fi20,Paul_is_a_kent,1 point,Wed May 27 07:36:53 2015 UTC,"I have always wanted to live out in the country, and so has my dad. He grew up in the country sort of on a farm (more like so poor that they had to raise their own animals to eat, but same general idea) and only moved to town as an adult. For years, my dad's hobby was basically going on nice drives through the country and looking into any land he saw that happened to have a for sale sign on it.  One day during one of his drives he found 40 acres for sale (had it surveyed post purchase and it was actually 43) with woods and a large pond/lake that was about a 10 minute drive from where he works and about a 20 minute drive from where I work. It was too much for either of us to be able to afford, but we could handle it if we both went in on it and if we could talk the seller down slightly. We decided we wanted the place based on the land. The house was in such bad shape that it actually almost changed our minds once we got a Realtor to take us inside. Nobody had lived there in quite a while. We decided to get it anyway, though.  My wife and I (well, a contractor) gutted the house. We basically kept nothing except the foundation, exterior walls, and roof. It was rewired, re-plumbed, re-insulated, the roof re-shingled, got a new septic system, and everything. My parents built themselves a house off in the middle of the woods, closer to the pond.  My dad and I have always loved hunting and fishing and just being outside. Additionally, I like gardening and having fruit trees and the like. He liked raising chickens and ducks as a kid. I had never done that before, but I like it now that we have them.  I'm in my late 20's, and he is in his mid 50's. We basically wanted an outdoor lifestyle, and I can't speak for him but I wanted to be a little more self sufficient as well. He's looking to retire in a few years, and he is probably imagining spending a lot of time outside. I made a career decision a few years ago that basically involved trading a higher salary for substantially more time off and hopefully an earlier retirement, so I'm kind of looking to do the same thing.  It's a lot of work, but it's work that I enjoy doing for the most part. It's also a little slow going to get started, especially since I don't have a lot of extra money to just buy a bunch of stuff at once. That said, we've owned the place right at almost a year now, and it's already starting to look good."
homestead,36fi20,derrick81787,1 point,Wed May 27 19:54:23 2015 UTC,Its an old gold mining town inthe middle of the woods it was a very prospering town. Alot of spring water and many places grass grows. you enter the area at 6300 and when you get to where i would be you're right below the snow lines poison oak grows in spots. Ive lived out there during the winter in a Tee Pee and a wood stove. Grew tomatoes one plant during the season harvested about 50 fruit. Wild grapes grow all over and strive in the environment. There are even crab apple trees still out there. Goose  berrys wild strawberries black berrys and rasberrys grow even figs. Rainbow trout is abundant and so is black tail deer. You can sit in your camp and drink coffee and watch 10-20 graze 45 feet from you quail and grouse are there like crazy and a plethora of grey squirrel. There are wild herbs still all over indian onions and indian soap root mountain sage mint soooo. much of the natural plant life still exists and the animal life. I lived out there for a year investigating and planning.
homestead,36fi20,derrick81787,2,Tue May 19 18:41:48 2015 UTC,"Well, it sounds like you've planned it out a little better than I had first thought. I'd still think about all these things if I were you, though. Wild grapes and wild blackberries also grow on my land. The blackberries are nice treats for a couple weeks out of the year, but again I'd just hate to have to depend on them. The wild grape vines barely seem to have any grapes on them, but that might just be a problem with mine. I don't know.  I'm not saying don't do it. Just plan it out and realize that a lot of things take time to get started. There will probably be a transition period, so I wouldn't expect to just move out there and be able to live off the land right away. One thing I recommend doing is just planting as many fruit trees as you can. I haven't been at my current place for long, but I had fruit trees at my previous place and once they are established they require only a little maintenance and give you fruit basically forever. I don't understand why everybody doesn't have fruit trees."
homestead,36fi20,kibitzello,1 point,Tue May 19 20:19:17 2015 UTC,The production of the grapes are probably due to the nutrients in the soil. the replie i gave to the guy above was aimed at both of your comments.

On the way out after summer an old timer who had been living there for 12yrs and been in thoses woods for 26 an old viet nam vet asked if I could stay at his camp for the winter and help him cutting and splitting wood as well as a hole bunch more. I learned a heck of alot from him and other old timers even learned how to metal detect from one of the most prominent detectorist in the US out there. Learnd a ton about placer and load mining learned alot about the land. Ran around the woods out there like it was my back and front yard because it was. My adventure lasted a year, 2 months just me and my dog me and the old man about 5 months the other 4 various camps and 1 helping an old lady on her goat farm.

homestead,36fi20,xPersistentx,1 point,Tue May 19 18:24:56 2015 UTC,"/u/derrick81787 made a lot of good points. I just want to add a few. I have a nice homestead on 15 acres on the edge of the woods. I spend a lot of time in the woods hunting, cutting wood, foraging, and raising pigs.   You can definitely clear land for a garden. Soil is often very good in old, untouched forest. You'll have to clear an area much larger than the actual garden space, though, to let in light throughout the day. Plus, you'll need some jurassic park-style fencing. If you think it's hard to keep deer and groundhogs and other animals out of a garden in your yard, imagine how hard that would be in the woods.   One thing you'll want to be wary of is the effect being ""in the woods"" has on buildings. A log and stone home out in a field will cure and keep for a good while. In the woods, it stays wetter longer. Leaves pile up on your roof. Wood rots. Stone gets moss and crap in it. It's going to be damp and humid and kinda shitty unless you take some pretty strong steps to mitigate all that.  On a positive note, you can raise pigs! They are naturally forest-dwelling animals. They will root up all sorts of shit to eat and will be in hog heaven when acorns and walnuts and hickory nuts start to fall from the trees. But again, you'll need some heavy fencing to keep them where you want them.   It's obviously doable, but it's also really goddamn hard. However, if you were to do it, I think you'd find that after a few years, you would have beaten the woods back considerably from all around your living area. Since that's the inevitable case, why not start that way? Clear a full acre of woods on the level for your building site. That will give you room for gardens and fruit trees and whatnot and will let your house dry out."

As far as the berrys being out there i can tend to the bushes and increase output  gardening would come down to terraces. There are fields out there where i could terrace rice or wheat easily and keep it flooded the way necessary.  There are species of plants not native to the area but have flourished since introduced by the miners such as maple trees.  There is a lot out there that dissipates so much of the walls you'll mention that they become little bumps."

I practiced a lot of my outdoors skills there too, plus gardening. There are several legal hurdles in the US you will have to deal with first.    Do you own the land? You can't just build a house on state or federal land, you risk being thrown off the land, and getting a heavy fine.  Once you own the land, can you actually build on it?  Would you WANT to build on it? You will have a lot more costs shipping materials deep in the woods far from any place the materials are sold.  Do you have minor children? In some states you are not permitted to have minor children in a house without modern running water, electricity and heat. That is, if social services pays you a visit due to neighbor complaints your children are being neglected.    Practicalities:    It's easier to be somewhat near a city to get extra supplies and food. Travel costs can really break you. If you have a bad crop year (and you will) what's your backup plan for food?  Do you truly understand how to make and purify water so it's safe for drinking? Way out in the woods the water could be contaminated with all kinds of runoff from mines, logging (more about paper processing) and other industry, and boiling the water does NOT make it safe to drink. What's your plan to deal with the chemical poisons in your water?  You need sun for most edible plants. You can harvest wild plants, but do you actually know the difference between wild carrot, and that other thing that will actually kill you?  Wild animals love tender, young garden seedlings. How will you fight them off? Groundhogs are particularly persistent animals and can dig under your fence, unless you put your fence 2ft underground. Deer are known to jump over 6ft high fences, so a 8-9ft fence is recommended against deer. That's more expense."

I wouldn't define attempting to make a profit as ""treachery"" just because it's based on selling the labor and capitol investments needed to grow food vs any other commodity.  Anymore than I think it's treacherous to grow your own, and deny the employees of grocery stores and trucking companies and factory farms the income provided by your purchases.

homestead,36cqxx,ruat_caelum,3,Mon May 18 16:57:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in a nutshell. My ex was pretty much a ""I specialize in a field that pays me enough to pay others to grow food"" person.   I, on the other hand, love to garden. And I see the growing trend of more and more people wanting to grow their own food or have a garden- nearly all my friends do have at least a small garden. Some have chickens and bees as well.   But- this is a cyclical trend. I know that my great grandmother had a ""victory garden"" and that my grandmother bucked the trend by living a life full of travel and not even growing so much as a house plant.   My ex, btw, did believe in buying from the local farmers and ranchers. And so we ate very well.   But- I know that it isn't true for the majority of people. I work in social services and see consistently that people are sorely undereducated on nutrition and how to cook. They go to McDonald's because they can get dollar burger and fries. The meal tastes good and is easy and only costs about $14 for a family of 4. If they are broke, they want something simple and packaged. Mac and Cheese. Hamburger Helper. Frozen pizza or burritos. I met a girl that didn't know that apples come in green, a girl that thought eggs were man-made, and a boy who had never, to his knowledge, eaten a vegetable.   And a lot of people are apartment dwellers with no outside space or they live somewhere where gardening would just not work at the unit (a duplex with a strip of grass and then concrete or a house that is shared by multiple families for example).   I would like to see the trend continue to go up, but several community gardens that were here last year are gone this year due to lack of interest."

Being wealthy and successful enough not to need to grow your own was ""in"" for my parents."

It extols the wonders of solar shingles and hammers it home with pictograms showing us how much it will cost and how much we'll save every month, but wait there's more, here's how much you'll save over time!  Zowie!  Now I'll be generous and ignore that the first pictogram is for the average install, not specific to solar shingles, and my reservations over the lifespan of the product to not only continue to produce adequate power but also to serve as a weathertight barrier despite all the repeated cycles of expansion and contraction and possibly degrading further due to overheating, but when we get to the last pictogram we're sent into a tailspin of muck.  My first guess was they simply were a bit off with calculating cost vs. savings to get how many years of payback (in Alaska according to what they say the average cost is vs. what I'd save each month I came up with 24+ years not 17 even before wondering if the second and third pictogram were simply based upon not having an electric bill vs. potential energy gain from the available sunlight from a fixed collector, not to mention seasonal differences those not in the south have as an added bonus), so I read the description, aha! I must have forgotten cost of electricity (obviously I didn't because that's the savings in the second and third pictogram), except read further, they say Arizona and Louisiana where electricity costs are low the payback time is long, yet those two states are in the grouping that is the shortest payback time.  Something's just not right here (and what's up with the 5 states they didn't calculate a payback time?), and while the concept is great, and affordability is welcome and needed, I just think more sunshine is being pumped up skirts than on solar collectors with this one."

During WW2 it was studied and shown that rabbits produce the most meat for the least space, time spend on care, and input (feed).   Chickens are a close second. You can feed them, they produce eggs, and when they are too old, you eat them. But chickens can be a little complicated for a beginner, as you have to give them enough calcium to produce their egg shells. And they don't lay in the winter very much.   But insects beat all for using less water, less food, and less space.  Excluding western culture, most of the world eats insects regularly."

Please buy Dr. Bronner's biodegradable soap if you're going to be consistently showering outside with no proper drainage.   It is all-purpose and can be used for washing your hands, washing your hair, even brushing your teeth, washing your dishes, etc. It's the only soap I take backpacking. You'll find it takes a little bit of getting used to, it doesn't foam up like a bar of soap, but you can buy just huge bottles of it at any Wholefoods or store like that. It is highly concentrated so a few drops goes a long way.  https://www.drbronner.com/"

They get eggs and no responsibility and they don't have to work about cutting grass. You could get a tractor and move it over every day. Your going to have a huge garden and so much stuff to toss to the birds. Keep updating the progress. Would love to see it all Come about.

homestead,3625cw,mostlyfriendly,3,Fri May 15 14:10:21 2015 UTC,"A coup is a stationary housing for chicken. A tractor is a wood framed and gate covered box you put them in during the day so they can peck and eat bugs in the grass. You move it everyday day after a week, day  ones spot has had time to break down the poop and fertilize the grass and let bugs come back.   I wonder if you could do that since it's not a coop.😈"

Anything broken down that small is being developed. Anything being developed is pretty much too late for the farmer/homesteader.  When someone says ""I can get farmland around me for X an acre"", they're talking about the price per acre on chunks of property that are much greater than one acre.

Their names usually become the color of the ring - Pinkie, Greenie, Blue, Brownie, etc.   The spiral rings are easier to put on than the other kinds, and your hens won't outgrow them. It still usually takes two people to get them on - one to hold the bird, one to put the ring on - but I've done it alone before.   Sometimes the rings get old and break off, but by then I know the hen's name - even though I have about 50 hens. I recognize my gals. ;-)  The size 9 rings work on both my hens and guinea hens:  http://www.strombergschickens.com/product/2535/spiral-bands  There are 10 different colors. If I happen to have more than 10 hens of the same breed, I'll double them up. For instance, me hen, Julia, has one orange and one white on the same ankle.

The author feeds them earthworms he raises on kitchen scraps.    What I've learned from fish breeding:    Herbivores are cheaper and easier if you're growing your own food. Use the largest containers or ponds you can afford for the grow out tank.  The water will be more stable and the fish will grow faster. Keep them at their ideal temperature/pH/salinity/etc. and keep the Ammonia and Nitrites zero and Nitrates as low as possible.  Floating, fast-growing live plants work great for this, or you can run your water through a hydroponics setup. Get a large filter that is easy to clean and repair.  You can make your own with a strong pump, a plastic container, and filter media. If your system has plants, filter the water with carbon before adding it to the tank (to remove chlorine and heavy metals) but don't have carbon in your filter, because it removes things plants need to thrive. Combination of live food and flakes for fry makes them grow faster.  Research the preferences of your particular fish at certain live stages.  You can grow all of these: Infusoria, Brine Shrimp, Vinegar Eels, Daphnia (super easy and removes algae from the water) Triops, Earthworms, Fruit Flies, Mealworms, etc.  Lots of fish like kitchen scraps.  Look up what's healthy for them."

homestead,35vvrv,PM_me_your_homelab,1 point,Thu May 14 19:16:01 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting idea, but if you want to heat your house during winter time, the heap should be as big as possible, so the volume to surface ratio is as big as possible to prevent the temperature from dropping to a point, where composting stops, Especially, since you are permanently removing heat from the pile, to heat your house or whatever.  If the composting stops, you would either have to pump hot water through the pile or wait for spring/summer, when it gets warm enough to start again by itself. If you're using this system to heat your house, both solutions are pretty inconvenient."
homestead,35vvrv,be_relevant_or_dont,1 point,Thu May 14 20:25:20 2015 UTC,"As the pipes are in a horizontal layer and fixed to some sort of metall grid, they are easiest to take out, if you remove all of the compost on top of them. To simplify this work, and to avoid damaging the tubes, you can fill  those net-like bags, used for potatoes, with chipped wood and put one layer on top of the tubes. When it's time to use the compost, you can just take away the bags instead of risking to damage the pipes with a shovel or  a digger.  In about 10 days I will be able to look at such a system in real life. It is used to heat greenhouses. I'm looking forward to that quite a lot.  But I agree, it's a quite complex system and trying this at home without a backup heating system would be pretty daring.  Jean Pain, the guy who developed this system also produced methane, by filling a container with halfly decomposed wood and burying it in the mound. the warmth from the compostating keeps the methane production alive. He used the methane to power his car. Here is a 15 min video about him - it's german with english subtitles."

homestead,35wngh,captain_craptain,4,Thu May 14 18:06:17 2015 UTC,Think of your septic as a giant poop compost bin. Don't put anything inorganic down the drain. No feminine products for sure. Use your garbage disposal but infrequently. The bacteria in a septic aren't the exact same as a compost pile so will take longer to break it down. You'd be better off using the strainer and throwing food scraps in the compost than putting it thru the disposal.   As for the bath products...it's kind of up to you. The closer to completely organic you can keep it the longer you will be able to go between pumpings (about $300/4years). Getting your septic pumped is done to remove whatever inorganics were added that precipitated out of the water and sank to the bottom as sludge.

homestead,35wngh,yetifaerie,2,Thu May 14 16:38:55 2015 UTC,"I make a lot of the cleaning products we use around the house. It's better for the environment, better for our skin and air quality, and WAY cheaper. I make batches of things. I find that if I make a x4 batch of laundry detergent, I can use it in my High Efficiency washer for months. It doesn't take long to make a lot. It's a chore to make the cleaning solutions, but then, so is shopping. Here's a list of cleaning products we use A LOT:  -baking soda  -washing soda  -distilled vinegar ((warning: do not use on marble, as it will corrode))  -isopropyl alcohol  -kosher salt  -Dr. Bronner's Castile liquid soap  -Dr. Bronner's Castile bar soap  -essential oil for fragrance  Here's how I use them:  Washing Soda  Don't buy this in the stores, you can make it for the cost of baking soda. Spread baking soda out on a sheet pan and bake at 400F in your oven. How long this takes depends on how thick you spread out the soda. Here's the article I used. Stirring the pan while cooking helps the process, I've found.  Dishwasher detergent  Mix together:  1c washing soda (cleaner)  1c baking soda (cuts grease)  1c salt (water softener)  OPTIONAL: 10 drops lemon/orange oil  Laundry Detergent  1 4.5oz bar soap (castile is best, fels naphtha is okay)  1c borax  1c washing soda  Dr. Bronner's is my preferred brand for bar soap. Grind with box grater (takes a while!) or use shredder blade on food processor. Process further with the s-blade and add borax and washing soda for ultimate homogenity. A few drops of essential oil go a long way. Smelly ones are okay, if a different smell is desired. I like to use Dr. Bronner's citrus flavor bar soap.  Shampoo  1 part Dr. Bronner's Castile Soap (any flavor)  1 part water  10-20 drops vitamin E oil  feel free to switch the oil for another. Other good substitutes include: tea tree oil, jojoba oil. A note: Don't be shy with the oil. It should be about 5-10% of the total volume of the shampoo. This recipe needs to be shaken when used, but works well as body wash, too.   Window cleaner  ((disclaimer: I haven't used this recipe yet, so I'm not sure how well it works))  1/4 cup white vinegar (apple cider vinegar will work as well)  1/4 cup isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol  1 Tbsp cornstarch   2 cups water  8-10 drops essential oil of choice (optional. Lemon, orange, or another citrus would be my choice here, but lavender or others would be nice as well.)  Put everything into a squirt bottle and shake well before every use. The cornstarch will settle and possibly block the nozzle. Why cornstarch? On a microscopic level, glass is not perfectly smooth. When you spray water on it, the water molecules get caught in the pits on the glass surface. Water also clings to itself through hydrogen bonding – the hydrogen atoms from two molecules cling together. Water stuck in the glass + water stuck to more water = streaking. Cornstarch (or dish soap or oil-even a couple drops of essential oil) disrupts the hydrogen bonding, thus preventing streaks!"
homestead,35wngh,yetifaerie,2,Sat May 16 19:43:40 2015 UTC,"For toilet bowls, floors, tubs, and other porcelain surfaces, I use a paste made with Dr. Bronner's liquid castile soap and baking soda. For extra heavy duty scrubbing power, I add some kosher salt. I'd give proportions, but it changes on what you're using it for. This doesn't keep well, as the soda settles on the bottom and is impossible to remix. I'd start with something like 1/4 c liquid soap, 1/4 cup baking soda. Adjust to your preferences."
homestead,35wngh,BoogerTom,1 point,Sat May 16 19:47:00 2015 UTC,More important to know how it's sized--make sure it's made to handle the number of people who will be using it. An oversized septic tank will handle whatever you can throw at it (within reason)...an undersized tank will choke at the least provocation.
homestead,35wngh,werevole,1 point,Thu May 14 04:34:31 2015 UTC,"Grease and oils are best to be avoided if at all possible and practical, since they don't break down well and too much will form into a floating layer of sludge (and since a septic is a combination of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that inhibits the air breathing variety) and can eventually clog up a leachfield (so can undigestible fibres and plastics like microbeads).  The ph balance for the same reason should be as close to neutral as possible, so avoid highly acidic or basic items and cleaners when possible (which also means you don't really want to be freshening your drains with baking soda regularly unless you have a co-dweller that won't stop pouring pickle juice down the drains, and remember, if you are on city water that is chlorinated, it may well be closer to 8 than 7 on the ph scale).  Really limit anti-bacterial products, bacteria can't do their job well if they're being killed off and under constant attack.  Toilet paper, well, of course less is better, and some people even resort to not putting any down the drain as paper products degrade much slower than the subject for which they are used.  Marine and RV paper will break down the fastest (put some in a jar of water and shake it and it almost immediately turns into a slurry) but it's expensive and may not be strong enough for some users without using it in excess.  On the other end of the spectrum, many top brands known for softness may have cotton fibres in them that resist degrading.  Really try to strike a balance that makes the most sense.    People can go to extremes with septic tanks, either making life miserable by watching every drop that goes into it, or by neglecting and abusing it.  As long as one keeps harsh things out of it and does their best to limit or leave out non-water soluble and non-biodegradable materials, it should give you many years of service."

homestead,35wngh,nuttierthansquirrels,1 point,Thu May 14 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"I have a few basic questions about your tank. Do you know where your tank is? Do you have an above grade access? Does it have an aerator? Do you know where your drain field is and empties? Do you have clean-outs?  I live in Missouri and have had septic tanks for most of my life.  My mom is nuts about cleaning and would effectively kill everything in our septic tank.  Dad found a product called Rid-X that is a culture to help your tank digestion.  Rid-X definitely helps.  We only use Angel Soft toilet paper.  For us, we have found that this has the best balance of strength and ability to break down. The house we currently live in, we knew it had a septic tank, but didn't know exactly where it was.  Thankfully, one of the former home owners now lives on his family farm close by, and came and located it for us.  Apparently our house originally had a metal tank that fell in when the former owner was mowing the grass.  He then put in a concrete tank.  I have known of other homes/cabins than only had a 55 gallon steel drum, and one that had an old oil tank.  Our old house had above grade access and an aerator.  Unless the motor for the aerator is outside of the tank, the environment in the tank will corrode and destroy it before long.  They are a waste of money in my opinion.  Where your drain field empties may stay wet, so be careful driving around that area.  The drain field is also a place that you do not want to drive over, you may crush the field or pipes and create problems.  Having clogs in your line is usually more a matter of when, not if.  If you have clean-outs, you want to make sure they are protected when mowing/driving. We had our tank pumped out a few years ago.  This is the second time I have had this done, and both times they wanted the entire lid removed from the tank (just FYI.)  I have access to excavation equipment, so it wasn't a big deal for me.  When we had ours pumped out, it was purple inside.  I was told this was from the phosphates in laundry detergent.  We tried some other things, including making our own detergent, but our daughter has very sensitive skin and it became easier to just buy All Free.  I know we will have to pump out the tank again, but that's life.  At our former house and my parents, roots were the worst problem.  Drought years are the worst, but even the roots of grass will grow into your tank and where the pipes go in and out.  If these pipe openings are not sealed with concrete, you will eventually have problems with roots.  Last, I will leave you with a bit of advice an elderly plumber and neighbor of mine gave me; if you need to jump start the cultures in your septic tank, find opossum or armadillo road kill, preferably a couple of days old, and chuck that in your tank.  Their digestive cultures are supposed to be the best for septic tanks.  I haven't tried it, just putting it out there."
homestead,35wngh,crankypants15,1 point,Thu May 14 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"Nothing that kills the bacteria that is supposed to decompose your waste. Some cleaners are just a base solution, but occasional use will hardly have an effect on something as large as a septic tank. If you wash your bathroom religiously every week, then you may not want to use even those.  Some countries think it's ok to put toilet paper down there, some don't. There is no consensus on the toilet paper issue, except not putting toilet paper in there increases the time between pumping out the septic tank.  Generally only human waste should go in there.  No paper towels, no feminine products, no bleach.  Technically, Soap is not ok. It is known to kill bacteria, even if it doesn't say ""anti-bacterial"". Also, no anti-bacterial soap.    As a person who grew up with a septic tank, we put all kinds of cleaners down into the septic tank and never had problems. We pumped it about once every 10 years. But if you are super concerned, like your septic tank is under-sized, I listed things you should avoid.

homestead,35x57x,whopayinyou,4,Thu May 14 14:17:26 2015 UTC,You usually use the anti freeze in a closed loop and then use a heat exchanger to heat your water
homestead,35x57x,framerotblues,2,Thu May 14 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly right.   If you don't use a closed loop, where does the input water come from? Then you'll definitely need a strong pump to push it where it needs to go. A system that isn't closed loop can't be pressurized to raise the boiling point, and it cant use a pressure relief valve because any expansion of the water will just push back to the source (which is probably a vented water tank, I'm going to guess). Worst case scenario:  As soon as you open your hot water valve on a sunny day, your pressure will drop, and the water will boil and turn to steam, which will not help the longevity of your solar collector or provide you with the hot water you want."

When a muscovie mates with another breed of duck, that offspring is sterile.      When Muscovies and common ducks are allowed to mate naturally, the fertility rate is usually very low. It is a common practice today to use artificial insemination to increase the fertility. Whatever the method of mating, the offspring are sterile and cannot be used for breeding.  These sterile hybrids are called mule (Muscovy male x common female) or hinny (common male x Muscovy female) ducks. In some cases special names are assigned to hybrids by commercial breeders. For example, one hybrid produced by crossing Muscovy males with Pekin females is called ""Moulard"". Such names may identify the commercial breeder and the particular strain of Muscovy and common duck used to produce the hybrid. In Taiwan, the hybrid produced by crossing a White Muscovy male with a Kaiya (Pekin x Tsaiya) female is called simply, the ""Mule Duck"". Mule Ducks are popular among the people of Taiwan because of their taste and high proportion of lean meat.   http://www.duckhealth.com/dmstduck.html"

It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling.   A similar standard, MINERGIE-P, is used in Switzerland.  The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard. Passive design is not an attachment or supplement to architectural design, but a design process that is integrated with architectural design.  Although it is mostly applied to new buildings, it has also been used for refurbishments.

That being said, since the unemployment rate for architects is hovering around 14%, it would be really easy to make a deal with a independent architect, but it still won't be cheap. All in all, personally I would opt for a prefab house. Most of them are configurable and there are a few that I've seen that are net zero or even net plus, which is a house that produces more energy than it uses and thus usually makes it possible to potentially sell energy back to your provider.

homestead,35soqn,Yanrogue,5,Wed May 13 04:32:14 2015 UTC,"Firstly, congratulations on the new property! I am no expert, so as always take advice from the internet with a grain of salt. As for making a freshwater pond off the creek, it is definitely possible but you would need to factor multiple things in, such as the strength of water flow and if there would be a possibility of the creek (and pond) running dry easily if water is redirected. In a few cases I have seen people opt to dig a separate pond in a location of their choosing instead, as changing the way a river or creek runs can be difficult.  Hunting on personal property depends entirely on local law for your area, but normally is no issue, especially with how much land you have at your disposal. For example, in my state I can hunt anywhere, anytime provided my shots would not risk hitting a building or person on an adjoining property, and providing I have the proper permits of course. My state offers free deer permits for hunting on your own land as well.  Now I am partial to fruit trees and others that serve a particular purpose, like sugar maples, but I can understand not wanting to fill up tons of areas with fruit bearing trees. We grow peach, cherry, apple, pear, plum, and pecan trees here on my farm with no problems and get great enjoyment from it. Another great place to go is a local nursery or local conservation office and see if there is a list of native trees to your area that are already established in your climate, then research and pick favorites from there. These would be trees you would see all year long for many years to come, and to me there is nothing more beautiful than an array of vibrant red, yellow and orange in autumn."

homestead,35soqn,necrosxiaoban,1 point,Wed May 13 13:43:14 2015 UTC,"What you can and can't do when it cones to water varies considerably depending on where you want to do it. First and foremost check to see if there are any kind of development restrictions. If the creek is part of a larger watershed there may be restrictions in place to ensure quality of drinking water as well as minimizing impact to the local ecology. From there you would want to consult a soils expert who can give you some idea of if the area will support putting a pond in. When deepening a creek one of the bigger concerns is the soils/clays may be overly prone to erosion which could see your pond washing out in a few years.   Hunting regulations usually specify a minimum distance from roadways and residences, and can vary from 50 ft minimum setback to 1000+ ft. You almost certainly will have room on 90 acres, but again determine the local regulations.  If you're intending to hunt on the land consider planting trees which will attract the sort of wildlife you intend to hunt. Nut trees like walnuts and oaks are certainly good for that, but you may want to consider seed and berry producing species as well. Your wildlife commission can be a great resource for determining what is good/useful for that sort of thing as well. Also, with 90+ acres you may have opportunities to enroll part or all of your land in a wildlife conservation management program that can provide grants and tax breaks/credits for doing nothing but allowing desirable species of plants and trees to grow.  Programs for this exist on a state and federal level."

homestead,35s5zg,Retired63,2,Wed May 13 02:13:23 2015 UTC,I had looked that up but I still don't like how the pens are discreet units.  It seems like they'd be stomping down a lot more fresh grass in that set-up especially since there is a central water tank in each pen.  It makes the compaction more uneven.  The advantage of my idea is that the water would be in each stall so the cow doesn't need to go anywhere from the fresh grass.
homestead,35s5zg,whereismysideoffun,6,Wed May 13 02:23:00 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't discount pasture rotation so quickly. You get the most out of the land while actually building top soil. Perhaps read a book on it instead of a short online search. Grass Fed Cattle is a really good one in deeply explaining the concepts.   If you have cows on quality pasture they will obey boundaries. A friend who does rotation well uses one strand of tape 2' off the ground (not even electric) and his cows have never went outside of the tape. He moves them a small amount every day, so they always have good forage. It's really easy to take care of.   You barn idea is a high dollar investment. From the pastured cows that i have been around, I would suggest that the fence to barn thought process won't play out. They aren't going to move something that takes coordinated effort to move. The fence situation is created by lack of pasture. Read up on rotation. You can get more money out of selling grass fed beef and you'll be building up soil and healthier plants for browsing. Your land will improve if done correctly."
homestead,35s5zg,vtdscglfr,1 point,Wed May 13 03:07:39 2015 UTC,"My idea is a different approach to rotational grazing.  The difference is that the pen itself is moving.  It's not really an actual barn but it would have some shade over each stall.  Also during the winter there would be windbreaks on it.  It's not really a ""pasture"" at this point.  It's more like a feed lot only instead of a stationary feed bunk the cows push on it when they want more grass.  As far as materials goes I have access to scrap steel to make this stuff."

homestead,35s5zg,jelliknight,3,Wed May 13 16:05:02 2015 UTC,Why would you want to keep them in a feed lot type setting instead of letting them be cows on pasture?
homestead,35s5zg,nothingbutt,1 point,Wed May 13 03:59:39 2015 UTC,"Your plan essentially is just rotational grazing, but with extra difficulty. In rotational grazing the pen itself still moves, it's just that it's a simple fence, not a giant mobile barn.  Your idea to try to automate it somehow so you don't have to physically move the fence each day is fair enough. There are already a few people trying to make a similar thing on a smaller scale by basically frankensteining a chicken tractor and a roomba together. However, using the cows themselves to push it presents a few problems in getting several of them to push at the same time to move it if it's heavy, or if it's light in keeping them from continuing on and moving it as far as they like (essentially no different to just free ranging them anyway). You could possibly make it work with cows by putting the whole fence on some kind of wheels and motors but it's probably much cheaper and easier to just move the fence regularly."
homestead,35s5zg,AsksAboutCheese,1 point,Thu May 21 05:02:11 2015 UTC,"You can make whatever division you want with rotational grazing. You make a rectangle/division and have the fence set for a days feed. Next day you move it back another day. So maybe you get 5 days out of your rectangle/division and then on to the next.  I came here to post rotational grazing too. I worked on a farm that did it and it worked great. Even better is if you follow up the cow rotation with a chicken coop so they can scratch the cow pies apart.  Although I read your follow up so maybe we're not thinking of the same thing. But the farm I was on definitely converted some alfalfa fields that were previously baled to rotational grazing. I think some that were previously corn too. Of course, they did crop rotation too so everything was always changing over the years."

When the animals are kept on the move through pastures then any one pasture is tilled by hoof and, not compacted, with due time to rest between grazing. Also, manure does not need a management plan, as it is evenly and lightly distributed enough to fertilize, not damage, the field. You increase soil mass, not reduce it. It is a management plan to increase a pasture's productivity, and, reduce effort and inputs, at the same time.  Your plan sounds like more effort, some localized compaction and outputs and inputs still need to be managed. Just seems like an awful lot, so that the cows could get at a few extra blades of grass."
homestead,35s5zg,IronSlanginRed,1 point,Wed May 13 11:37:08 2015 UTC,"I was going to make the same statement regarding how the rotation is more like using a tiller than a compactor on the soil/manure, but you beat me to it!

The price is pretty low, but that reflects that the house is over 100 years old(but renovated to modern standards) and it's in the middle of the Swedish forest. I don't care tho, I would pay extra to have it in the middle of the forest, but it works out to less(city folk dun kno shit)."

It was widely adopted as a high-energy food by Europeans involved in the fur trade and later by Arctic and Antarctic explorers, such as Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen.  The specific ingredients used were usually whatever was available; the meat was often bison, moose, elk, or deer. Fruits such as cranberries and saskatoon berries were sometimes added.

If you restrict feed they act more like other standard breeds, but lack the crazy fast growth. No matter what, they don't forage as well as other varieties I've kept. A tractor full of cornish cross birds does very little damage to the ground compared to just a couple reds, wyandottes, leghorns, etc. 2 years ago a tractor with 25 Cornish X birds @ 6 weeks old did less digging than the same size tractor with just 3 wyandottes in it. After 2 full days, there was still clover and dandelions under the cornish X's feet. Cornish X birds just don't dig or forage much, even if they're hungry. IMO, they don't do well in tractors anyway, since they can't take advantage of the biggest reason for putting them in a tractor - foraging.  If you're using a standard meat variety like red rangers, they are every bit as active as layers IMO, and do very well in a tractor."

To get them to the tractor, I used mealworms and they would follow me to the tractor...go in...and I would shut the door behind them.  Now, they can be let out of the coop/run and left to their own devices because I've taught them the property lines.  (Again using mealworms.)  Every once in a while they go to the neighbors but I whistle and call them back.  (Whistle is associated with mealworms.)  It takes a bit of training, but once its done, they know what to do.  As for overnight, they will want to roost in their coop...so will probably just naturally go back to it if they know where it is.  Mine do.  Also, my farmer told me if I just leave food at the center of the property, they won't stray too far away from the food, but I didn't try that method as my chickens are more like pets to me and I don't want them to be hurt by our local wildlife (hawks, fox, etc.)  Good luck."

Currently, not many countries are known for using the cover crop method.  Cover crops are of interest in sustainable agriculture as many of them improve the sustainability of agroecosystem attributes and may also indirectly improve qualities of neighboring natural ecosystems. Farmers choose to grow and manage specific cover crop types based on their own needs and goals, influenced by the biological, environmental, social, cultural, and economic factors of the food system in which farmers operate (Snapp et al. 2005).

This is understandable, given that the crop was 4 feet tall in places. If you're looking for a cover crop that will produce a mountain of material to turn into the soil, rye will do the job.

homestead,35mqk1,schmizzl44,3,Mon May 11 20:17:10 2015 UTC,"Even using a tiller or disk can only cut so much up. They are really designed to break up earth. With long stemmed, tough grasses or vine like stuff it just wraps up the tiller or aligns with disks and doesn't get mixed in.   I have a 5 foot wide tiller and rye that tall would clog it up and bog me down. I plant a mix of annual rye, red clover, and a pasture radish that has a 3-4 foot tap root to get deep in the soil and pull up nutrients. The rye and the radish winter kill. The clover comes back but doesn't get to bad for the tiller. I get some of the rye back if I plant the mix early enough for the rye to seed before winter.  A moldboard plow actually turns the soil profile over. It cut a section off and folds it over so the top ends up down and the lower portion of the soil ends up on the top. You don't usually need to plow every year. Disking or different harrows can usually get you a good seed bed. And honestly plowing is going away on a lot of the farms since it is pretty harsh on the soil composition and overall health. Deep ripping and discing works pretty well and doesn't do the same level of soil damage."

Imo the people who survive are people who have previously trained skills like farmers, hunters, military, the peppers, and the naturally resourceful. That makes a lot of the skills offered by survival books repetitive.  But forgive me, I took the question as a question of entertainment and based my answer on rebuilding a society motivated by creative thinkers. My choices in books wouldn't mean much in the days, months, or likely years after the fall other than to entertain me around the campfire but instead they would be the building blocks for the following generations.

These bucks are much wilder than I expected. When I went to the farm that I got them from; they were much tamer. They came right up to me and let me pet them. I guess the shock of relocating has them scared. They have seemed to settle down some already in the 3 days I've had them.  Right now I can't touch them without herding them into a corner and tackling them (which I havent done yet because Im trying to get them to like me). I really don't want to have to do that everyday in order to get them out of the chicken run. Do you think its possible I can tame them?
homestead,35lf4o,schoogy,2,Mon May 11 21:53:30 2015 UTC,Wow.  Apparently I've just been lucky so far that I haven't had jumpers.  :-)
homestead,35lf4o,crazycritter87,2,Tue May 12 20:58:09 2015 UTC,"Thing about goats is that they don't do a lot of graceful ""leaping"" the way deer do.  Deer launch themselves from the ground to ridiculous heights.  Goats, however, are climbers.  They need to get their front feet up on something and then heave themselves over it.  So you can sometimes get away with a little less height if there's nothing substantial enough for them to use to ""climb"" over.  Just something to think about with your design... don't make something tall enough that they can't leap over it, but that they could nevertheless climb over."
homestead,35lf4o,flower71,2,Mon May 11 16:11:49 2015 UTC,Can they climb cattle panels?
homestead,35lf4o,patron_vectras,3,Mon May 11 18:25:30 2015 UTC,"It depends highly on the goat. Goats are smart and if they think something is better on the other side, they will figure out a way to get there. I haven't had a goat climb my gate (combo cattle panel over tube gate), but that is not saying that they couldn't. I have had good luck with cattle panels and I have friends who have built out small loafing pens with them, so they do work.  Goats are really awesome, but they can be assholes. I have had some super sweet goats that wouldn't even leave the pen when the gate was left open, but as I described before I have had a buck that no matter what obstacle I put in his way he would go through it or over it."
homestead,35lf4o,lordofthefart,2,Mon May 11 20:28:29 2015 UTC,"Lol, not graceful leapers, HA. I had a buck who could clear a 6ft fence without even breaking his slow walk stride. F*er looked pretty graceful going over that damn fence. But, I will say he was a very big boy, 6ft tall standing on his back legs and probably over 185lbs. I needed deer fence to contain him and it was still an issue. Goats are also very strong and when they are determined to get through something they will get through it.   That is why I suggested making it look difficult to get through or over, they won't realize they can actually escape pretty easily. Once they figure out that they can escape, they will, and they will keep escaping until you make it too difficult."
homestead,35lf4o,fotoman,2,Mon May 11 20:23:12 2015 UTC,"They also jump off things and try to side kick other goats/ppl. Goats are ninjas.

homestead,35lf4o,XxionxX,1 point,Mon May 11 16:31:55 2015 UTC,Also look on premeir at hotwire. They are meant to be moved every couple months rather than every day like a chicken tractor but they have the same rotational concept.
homestead,35lf4o,XxionxX,1 point,Mon May 11 16:52:44 2015 UTC,"I've never seen those before; I think they'd work as well as a set of carabiners.  The problem we'd have is, if the goats notice that one part of the fence join has a gap, they'll start leaning and leaning on the whole join.    If there's any place with enough space between connectors for them to get their head through, they'll keep leaning with their whole body weight until they stretch the cattle panels enough to get their shoulders through, etc...  That's why these screw hinges worked so well, there were no gaps between connectors for the goats to start working on.  I haven't had much luck with hotwires yet, because it gets so dry here in the summer - can be bone dry 4' down by July.  I've had trouble keeping enough moisture for the fence to ground.  We're trying again this year in one of our pens though, see how it goes.  We've got the ground rod located near their water trough, so I'm hoping that spot will stay a little moister."
homestead,35lf4o,rycee,5,Wed May 13 15:47:21 2015 UTC,"Nope, rope & a stake won't work; it will inevitably lead to escape and/or injury.  Your best bet is temporary electric fence.  You'll need stakes, wire, and a charger.  I don't recommend the plastic/wire twine... that stuff is crap and a nightmare to deal with.  Just plain wire. The charger needs to be solar or plugged in somewhere, of course.  It's not an easy thing to do, unfortunately, or at least I haven't figured out a way yet.  You need goats with a good disposition, you should check for toxic plants in the area to be cleared, keep them safe from predators (and that includes humans who might steal or torment them), etc.  Honestly, when I have an area outside our pasture that I want our goats to eat down, I just take a couple at a time and stay with them, shepherd-like.  But I'm doing it partly for the goats' sake (nutritous plants, and a change of scenery), and I have no ambitions right now of REALLY clearning large spots of invasive shrubs.  Maybe someday.  If someone invents a goat-tractor. :-)"
homestead,35lf4o,arbivark,2,Mon May 11 14:01:17 2015 UTC,"The part about finding goats with good disposition is the most important part, imo. If you have goats you don't trust you will need to skip the less expensive options."

homestead,35lf4o,Cb1976,3,Mon May 11 16:59:45 2015 UTC,There are plenty of people doing such things. You have to maintain them in a small space and move the whole thing every few days. Most folks use electric fencing. If they are stuck to a small area they will eat a wider range of forage.

Do folks leave them in these temporary pens overnight? I was thinking of moving them in at night to a permanent shelter. If I put up a make shift shelter in the pen maybe they could handle staying out all night with good weather?   Most folks use electric fencing.   I use electric mesh net fencing for my chickens but it is a pain to set up if the area is overgrown. You have to clear out the perimeter before you set the fence or else it will short out or have lots of sag.

You could get some nutrition out of them if you boil, juice, and use the pulp in a muffin recipe or stew. You can also eat the greens!

homestead,35gali,isaidputontheglasses,11,Sun May 10 01:53:17 2015 UTC,"What? how did you get this far and are just now asking these questions. You need to look before leaping. Here is some ""opinions"". but then again you asked for them.  a. You live in a plant hardiness zone. That will tell you generally what you can grow, most plants have on the seed package, or the labels what zones they grow in in. Fruit trees will also have this info on them. If the company does not give hardiness zones or similar information for perennial plants, probably not worth buying from.   b. Find your last frost date once you have that, this is a great help. For beginners this will get you started. Use page 2 and 3 they work pretty well. You enter the frost free date and it gives 10 day planting and harvesting windows.  c. Now since you have access to a computer to be on here asking for others to tell you how to do this. If you don't have one, get a Google account. Then make a Google calendar. Take the work sheet you made up with dates to plant your crops and make a calendar notice for each one. I recommend a window either 1 week or ten days for each crop. Then you can look at the weather when each is coming up and pick the right day to get it in before the rain, etc.  For harvest dates use the ""days to maturity"" or ""days to harvest"" on the seed pack to schedule on your google calendar for the week before and after. Count out from the day you actually planted, not when you scheduled planting. Once you plant a specific seed, delete the scheduled window to plant and make the harvest item and a ""Planted blank seed"" item. Make all the notes about what you did as far as fertilizer, cultivation etc in the notes section of this item.  Here is how you adjust to your specific area. The seeds ""time to maturity"" is for a specific place. Unless your neighbor is the seed farm, it will be different. It may be earlier or later depending on location, weather patterns, soil etc. Make notes about what you did are far as planting method and fertilizer use for the planted appointment. Anything you specifically notice about the crop, you go back and enter that info in the appointment notes. Next year you will adjust the harvest dates to the average of your actual date and the seed packet date. Every year you add a date to the average and will in 3-4 years have days to harvest for your specific property.  Last part on this: Harvest quantity. Make sure you record the amount you are harvesting of each crop. ""Five bushels of cucumbers for pickles."" The next year you go to plant you can look and say shit one row of cukes gave 5 bushels, I only need 3 and can then cut down on the number of for feet of that crop. Or increase as needed.  This last is important if you are doing freezing or canning oat harvest. You can have set up harvest and canning times to get various crops in and processed. It helps to know that we are harvesting cukes and making 50 quarts of dills in the second week of July. That way you can have jars, salt, etc ready and harvest and can all in one day. (one scheduled day)  d. Livestock. You need to pick a kidding/calving date. There are some dates that are generally used for each animal type in your area. I recommend your extension service or call around to local breeders/producers and ask them if they are willing to talk about it and get the dates they use. Generally you take the kidding date you want minus the gestational time for the animal, and voila Date night! make a Google calender notice for that week for your girls to get introduced to a gentleman friend.  e. Chickens. Meat chickens will generally meet with a tragic accident based on age and weight. It is based on breed and is sort of variable based on what you feed. Buy quality, meat bird, high protein feed, shorter time than if they have to free range. Same thing though. You should have researched a Weeks to process for your breed and feeding system for your birds. Same thing here, date the chicks were hatched gets a calendar item. In the notes put the hatching method, how many were lost and why, anything else related. Then add weeks to process and make a date for the ""accident"" to occur. That way you can invite your friends to help you. They won't, but hey you can always ask. No one wants to pluck a chicken more than once. Worthwhile expense if you regularly do meat chickens I would recommend you try and find (or hell start) some form of cooperative for bird processing. Ducks, chickens, and turkeys are done pretty similarly. SO you could have some other people who are also raising and processing their own go to someones property with birds and then have a little processing day. Everybody helps, it goes faster and you share resources. ( one person have a plucker, someone else has the vacuum bag sealer, etc.)  f. Library. You need to have one, especially if your public does not have a good selection of this material. ""Storey's guide to...."" they have a very good selection of well written and easy to understand books. They are pretty straight forward and cover regular and organic methods usually. If you want old school, really Luddite stuff, then look up Foxfire Very good source of ""traditional"" methods and systems. These are not scientific and are only as reliable as they people they interviewed for their stories and such. It is a great source for old school ways, and should be taken with a grain of salt.   Those I think answer the questions you asked. I don't know how much that will actually help. But research, research, research. When ever you put in a search on google add: extension. That will give you results from the land grant college farm extension services. Best place for good answers on this stuff. Check into the classes they offer as well. Master gardener is a great one that most have available for no cost or a very small fee. And the information is invaluable.  Edited for some English."

homestead,35gali,ThisNerdyGuy,1 point,Sun May 10 20:04:22 2015 UTC,"This is a great response. I want to go a little further and say that I have done some research for each and everything I add to the farmstead. Unfortunately, it inevitably ends up that I didn't research enough.  i.e. Cornish cross cannot be free ranged without a higher likelihood of broken legs before maturity and the meat will be tough/terrible.  i.e. No matter what breed of goat you get it can still be a poor milker if it is not from a good lineage.  I guess I want to know if anyone has a book out that outlines a proven system and calendar of events down to the smallest detail?  One thing I need to know is how many chickens and ducks do I breed to feed a family of four and when do I harvest them?  I honestly just want to copy someone else with a proven system exactly at this point. :)"
homestead,35gali,not_whiney,1 point,Mon May 11 03:26:55 2015 UTC,"There is no one else to copy with a proven system that is based around your land, needs, family size, etc. The whole thing about this is it is not a single solution.   General rules:  A. Buy the best quality seed, breed stock, feeder animals, perennials, trees, etc that you think you can afford. (Actually buy the next one better than you think you can afford)  B. Plan for the worst, hope for the best.   C. Share your extra==Harvest way more than what you think you could use, give the part you don't can't use to freinds, neighbors, family, and people who need it.   D. Plan for the worst, hope the best.   E. Lastly is a journey not a destination. Do what works for you. If it is too much, back down a notch. Get the vegetables under control. Then add chickens, then add a dairy goat when it is time. If you try to do too much, and get ahead of what you can plan, you are unable to see the big picture and figure out where you need to go.   The only person who create a system that works for you, is actually you. This is why there are so many lost and disenfranchised out there. They try to emulate someones else ""system"" but don't have the same land, temperament, ability, and other help. And honestly a lot of the systems being touted are misrepresenting how much work really goes into them, or how well they actually work."
homestead,35gali,not_whiney,1 point,Mon May 11 22:59:07 2015 UTC,"I just feel like, if I were transported 100 years ago and had to rely predominately on my own homestead, I would starve. Well, at least as it stands now.  I read all these books and they seem to just gloss over major details and, like you mentioned, the work involved. I don't mind the work. I just fit in all I can.  It's just such a shame most of us don't come from homesteading families. I think this knowledge is best learned by passing it down generation to generation. At least then it is based on your family size, location, and general ability.  I don't know. Maybe I'm getting sullen. I just wish I had a loose frame work to go on. Most authors spend most of their time flapping their gums about how peaceful and liberating homesteading is in order to fill pages of a book, but put very minimal explanation into the nuts and bolts of the operation side of things.  Joel Salatin is pretty straight forward, but he really outlines how to do a farming operation that often includes more investment and product than a typical family needs. I don't really need 900 chickens right now, but I could use a steady stream of roots, fruits, various meat, veggies, and dairy. An actual diet so to speak."
homestead,35gali,not_whiney,2,Tue May 12 02:04:42 2015 UTC,"The problem here is what you are talking about no longer exists as a ""thing"". What we forget about in the nostalgic look though the way back machine is that, well, it sucked mostly. The reason they grew almost everything they ate was due to a lack of choice. Not due to a need to grow it themselves.   The pioneers did what they had to do to survive and make a living. Most were leaving worse conditions or were trying to improve their life is some way. (ie own land, practice their religion, flea prosecution or debt etc.)Thsi idea that things are better when you rely only on your own 2 hands to provide for you is not really the way it was. They would have loved to have a grocery store. They would of loved a tractor. They didn't hand turn gardens because they thought it was better, they hand turned because they couldn't afford a draft horse and a plow. They used a draft horse and a plow until they could by a steam engine. and ran that until it died and they could buy a tractor.   If you want to have the personal satisfaction of working very hard for what you have, great. But most of the ""systems"" out there are either how to build a small, medium, or large commercial growing farm or how to live like they lived in 1850.   The system you are looking for needs to come from you and your family. This just isn't a cookie cutter project where you can just copy someone else.   We want to some day get to where the farm is paying for at least our food bills. ie We grow, produce, raise the majority of the food we eat. But we plan on selling a good bit of produce and eggs because we will not raise all of our food. We are realistic about that. And honestly I can get a lot of the things I want way cheaper and probably better quality from someone else. You have to be realistic in what you can and can't do. I would recommend you cut back to where you can manage and then take an account of your family and then restart a piece at a time. It is too easy to get over worked if you A. try and do EVERYTHING, and B. If you believe the hype of a lot of people's BS.  Keep records: How many chickens would you need to raise? Well how many did you eat last year? How much milk? How much did you drink? Chickens can be processed and frozen so really if you know how many you will eat in the year, you get that many. Plus some for loses and giving. It all depends on you and your family."

For animals, try old homesteading guides and traditions. From what I have read most animals are harvested in the fall so you don't have to feed them all winter. Keep your breeders and other production animals, cull the rest. But your best bet might be to ask your neighbors, if they keep animals. Or find the nearest place where people do, and ask them.  And if you need the social support in your local area, you could look into. http://www.nationalgrange.org/.  Not all are interested, but it could be a valuable resource for meeting farmers in your area.

homestead,35g53n,omnicat,9,Sun May 10 00:56:36 2015 UTC,"Hawaii here. We are on strictly rain water catchment. We have a few cisterns with 35,000 gallon max for home use. Other catchment for garden use.   We are very fortunate that Hawaii encourages rain water catchment and have no legality issues.   Many of us in rural areas simply cannot get county water piped in.   There are county fill stations in rural areas that provide water for free in times of drought. We have a large 300 gallon water buffalo tank that we use for those periods of drought and hauling water as needed."
homestead,35g53n,moonpurr,3,Sun May 10 06:32:47 2015 UTC,Is the rain ever questionable in its quality? Do you ever have a sample tested just for kicks?   It's nice to hear that the local government is pro water harvesting. It's kind of crazy to think that anyone would be opposed to such a basic and beneficial thing. I guess it depends on your proximity to private water interests and wether or not they've rigged local laws.  Is the local emergency tank rain fed or piped?
homestead,35g53n,DieCommieScum,4,Sun May 10 14:48:11 2015 UTC,"Most rain catchment systems I've seen use heavy filtration. The rain water itself is clean, but the air it passes through or the roof it lands on may not be. You can cut down on the filtration required if the system is rigged to discard the first few minutes of drops via a ""First Flush"" config. http://www.harvesth2o.com/first_flush.shtml"
homestead,35g53n,moonpurr,5,Sun May 10 15:42:36 2015 UTC,We do use heavy filtration. This year we will be having a sample tested only because of the particulate matter in the atmosphere due to the volcano being very active.   The vog (volcanic smog) has been very thick this year.   Each state has their specific laws and regulations regarding rain water catchment and usage. We are fortunate to live in a state that encourages it.   The local county source is piped in.

Here in Australia, if you live outside the big cities tank water is your drinking water and mains water is supplemental. If you live anywhere in the country it's pretty much 100% tank water, bore water is usually not good enough to drink or even shower with.  It's just so strange to see people worried about and filtering rain water, when I grew up drinking it constantly and it's thought of as the purest water you can get. I don't think we filtered ours at all, and I don't think we ever cleaned out the tank in 18 years. We never had a problem with the water going bad."

homestead,35g53n,DieCommieScum,3,Sun May 10 01:06:04 2015 UTC,"Careful with sandpoints. If you are on septic (or your neighbors) you could just be recycling water.  When we bought our place the last owner had swapped the sulfur-iron deep well in the aquifer to a sand point at 18-22 feet. The sample we had taken from the well for the sale had the highest E. Coli number the lab had ever seen in ""potable water"" sample. The septic was draining and the sand/gravel formation that he had well in was the same sand gravel formation the drain field/tank was over. The water did not have iron in it, but was pretty foul. They had not been living in the house (they bought as an investment that did not pan out) and the previous owner did not drink the water. We found out after well was replaced and system sterilized and we moved in that the guy who had swapped the well not only did not drink the water out of the well, but that they only used it to bath and were boiling it before bathing over a wood fire since they did not have electricity hooked up for the hot water heater."

homestead,35e5yh,Terminal-Psychosis,10,Sat May 9 22:28:59 2015 UTC,"According to this thread, the general consensus was that they put too much feed into just building their frame. I had actually planned on getting them for meat and fur because I know someone with blue Flemish giant/chinchilla rabbit mixes.  Before anyone freaks out, the fur would have just been a byproduct and not the main reason for keeping them. I'm not just gonna throw away a pelt that could be used.  This poor feed-to-meat thing might be a deal breaker. Then again, I was just gonna feed them weeds and grass, etc. :/"
homestead,35e5yh,Terminal-Psychosis,3,Sun May 10 01:01:16 2015 UTC,"That is fascinating! Thanks for the info Mr. Glasses.  I suppose a balance of size would be more efficient then. There go my plans for breeding a horse size rabbit. Though your idea of just feeding them weeds n grass anyway might be the key.  On the fur thing, I'd say absolutely no reason not to use it too! The meat is delicious, and the fur is so soft n comfy. May as well!  Wish you much luck and fun with your future rabbit keeping. Thanks again for the insight."

Though to be serious Flemish Giants usually are around 15 pounds, which is as big as my largest Silver Fox doe. She is in a huge wooden floored hutch but you can totally keep them on wire. So as far as weight goes they are a good meat breed, you will just get a slightly higher ratio of bone, which isnt really a problem if you have a dog."

homestead,356sfo,ccharbon,9,Thu May 7 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"You can do it, but do not use the kitchen sink water, or water from the dishwasher. It will get nasty fairly quickly if you attempt to store it.   your bathroom sinks, bathtub, shower and laundry water will all work. The water will need to pass through a filter to catch hair and other bits. Whatever tank you're storing it in should be completely purged every day into the garden. If you do not empty it completely every day, it will build ever increasing colonies of stinky things.  In addition to this, you may want to put an aquarium or pond bubbler into the tank to add oxygen. Many of the stinky bacteria are anaerobic, and many of the bacteria which will benefit your garden are aerobic (oxygen loving). So the bubbler will help make sure your water does stink, and does good things for your garden.   Also you'll want to be sure to use eco friendly soaps if you're purging the system into your garden.  There are many great books and youtube vids out there... good luck!"

homestead,356sfo,gak001,2,Thu May 7 23:12:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, so when you flush, the faucet automatically starts flowing. I would've thought you have water in the tank, flush, tank empties to bowl, then you turn the water on, which pours into tank. Then whenever it fills up, the leftovers run into bowl or something. Unless different models work differently."

homestead,35746c,iufan,10,Thu May 7 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"Not along chain link, the weeds tend to burn back pretty quick so you don't really have to keep a flame on it. I've used it against a metal gate and never worried much, I wouldn't imagine there would be a problem unless it's coated in something plastic. I've been using the same tank on a 2 acre lot (maybe half of which ever needs weeding) every couple weeks and I don't remember the last time I had the tank filled.  Usage would probably be about the same as a good sized 4 burner grill maybe? it has a pilot light and you just kinda blast it intermittently. I've never been particularly sparing with it and it still seems to last.  My dad uses chemicals at his place, I'd say they both work for a bout the same duration, though the torch takes care of bigger weeds a bit faster.  And walking around with a flame thrower is comparably more fun than squirting green liquid all over the place."

If you can't find 20% try contacting a chemical supply company and ask for glacial acetic acid (100%), and dilute it to 20% yourself. Only do this if you are comfortable with chemistry, and have all the proper safety gear (respirator mask, nitrile gloves [latex gloves are no good acid will get through in this case], and eye protection) glacial acetic acid is pretty nasty stuff if you don't know what you're doing.

I use wood to line the bottom and top, so they won't push out, and did the lining with crushed shells so my dogs wouldn't dig in.  I don't have nearly an acre, but my three goats are happy. I spend much more in timothy and orchard hay, though, because there isn't anything green where the goats are. Goats are loud, no joke. When they see you and want your attention, they get your attention. When its morning food time, you're going to feed them. When its afternoon food time, you won't be late. Or else. Also, my doe does this super annoying cry when she goes into heat that starts at like 5am and goes until 10am. Its not everyday, but its rather annoying. I paid $75 for a doe and a whether pair, because you need to have at least three goats. I have never kept a buck because they are disgusting little creatures, but from what I know, they need to be separated from your doe when you're not breeding them, as they can be pretty rough with her and the kids. I don't have any experience keeping bucks, but you can find more information on the mini goat forum called The Goat Spot (google). I would plan on getting something like a shed, mine stay in an old converted wooden shed.  Diet wise, my goats eat strictly timothy and orchard hay. Sometimes they get alfalfa. No grain, especially because whethers can have urinary issues. They're favorite treats are- apples, cucumbers, peppers, strawberry tops (not the actually berry, lol), acorns, oak tree branches, XMAS trees, watermelon, and cantaloupe. I buy himalayan salt blocks for them to lick, and always keep out fresh minerals. I trim my goats feet, its very easy and there are a lot of hot to videos you can refer to.

homestead,354pkb,jelliknight,2,Thu May 7 13:10:29 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right.  I think some 'urban homesteaders' either don't know what they're getting into or just don't care about their neighbors at all. People really need to consider things like noise level, and proper fencing. If they just don't care if their screaming goat wakes the neighbors when it's reasonable to expect quiet that's a real jerk move. Regularly ruining a neighbors sleep is a great way to get a neighbor war going. Very similar to the typical terrible neighbor with the dog barking all the time. Be considerate of close neighbors."

homestead,354pkb,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Thu May 7 09:35:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. Go to r/goats.  Also: if you want milk, don't forget that milk requires breeding, which means making babies.  On an acre, minus space for the garden and chickens, you're going to have a hard time having more than three goats (two is bare minimum - never keep a single goat alone). So you've got your two or three goats, you get them pregnant, and now you'll have to find someone to buy the kids either as pets or (more likely) meat.  You have to be OK with that, and you have an obligation to make sure you sell them to someone who will either keep them responsibly or slaughter them humanely.  Don't make those babies without being responsible for their fate.    A percentage of the hay you feed them will go to waste.  And it composts VERY slowly.  It's not viable for use as garden compost.  Do you have a place where you can truck away the waste hay?  Honestly, goats are tremendously hard work, ESPECIALLY if you want them for milk.  They're willful, complicated parasite magnets.  And while backyard chickens and gardens can be a sustainable alternative to buying those products, I'm not sure the math works out for backyard goats - at such a small scale, the financial and environmental costs of the inputs (feed, medicine, tools, fencing, etc) may not justify the output.  Just something to think about if sustainability is part of your motivation for homesteading."
homestead,354pkb,diyrob,1 point,Thu May 7 14:00:47 2015 UTC,"The best way to deal with fencing is have tame goats. When my goat escapes she doesn't try to run away, tho she will eat my roses. We use plastic stakes and electric eire to keep in a la Mancha doe and a growing lamb. The fencing is great because it's portable.    Don't limit yourself to dwarf goats.  Many full size goats are not that much larger."
homestead,354mqd,ArchangelleCumBlast,7,Thu May 7 01:47:41 2015 UTC,"As for processing, it depends quite a bit on what animals you're dealing with. Chickens are scalded and plucked before gutting. Deer and cattle are gutted and then skinned while hogs are scalded and then scraped to remove the hair but leave the skin intact.   Some animals have useful internal organs. Beef tongue, liver and heart are all very tasty. Then entire head of a pig can be used. Many people like chicken livers, gizzards and hearts.  Chickens can be cooked or frozen whole or cut into fryer parts. Larger animals are usually halved or quartered. Sometimes they're aged for a bit before breaking them down into things like steaks and roasts or hams and such.   The breaking down into usuable cuts is a little more technical than all the other steps. For large animals it depends on what cuts you actually like and will use. In the case of most large animals, the small pieces you trim off, the cuts you don't care for and the extra fat get set aside to grind into hamburger or sausage. There is very little fat on wild game and what there is of it is often discarded or set aside for candle/soap making as it is not terribly tasty. Pigs have lots of fat which is essential in making sausage, but they also have what is called ""leaf fat"" found around the kidneys that can be rendered into perfectly clean, white lard to use for cooking.   YouTube is a great resource for learning about processing and butchering meat.   As for money - it doesn't really matter whether you're entirely self-sufficient or not, you're generally going to need money for taxes, insurance and things like that. Too, there are always going to be other things you simply cannot reasonably make for yourself. Most people have jobs - some work online, some are self employed and lots of homesteaders commute into town to a regular job. Still, some people transition into small farming operations and are able to sell products they grow or gain from their animals for additional income."
homestead,354mqd,loveshercoffee,5,Thu May 7 03:01:12 2015 UTC,"""Processing"" is the word I was looking for! (tried searching ""how to clean a carcass"" and ""how to make meat from a carcass"") That should tell you how little I know about this :)  I never even considered taxes and whatnot. I also never thought about selling the (possibly literal) fruits of your labor. I suppose you'd sell them at like a farmer's market."
homestead,354mqd,loveshercoffee,2,Thu May 7 03:43:19 2015 UTC,"Farmer's markets for certain are a good outlet for selling on a scale far below commercial production but a good bit more than just a back yard garden.  You have to be mindful of some of the food laws and restrictions, though. The sales of some foods like milk or dairy products and in come cases, eggs are tightly regulated. Most places have what are called, cottage food laws that set out the rules for what you can and can't sell without inspections, licenses and commercial facilities.   Though the laws vary from state to state, generally, fresh fruits and vegetables and herbs aren't going to be a problem. Some states allow the sale of fresh eggs but milk or other dairy are extremely contentious (or, as in my state, outright banned.) These laws too, set out guidelines for selling some other kinds of homemade goods; home canned high-acid foods like jarred fruits, jams, jellies and salsas are usually okay, as are non-hazardous baked goods like cookies, cakes, fruit pies and breads.  I know very little about the sale of animals so if that's the direction you want to go, you're going to have to do a bit of research. Selling live animals may not have too many hurdles but the sale of meat has all levels of legal entanglements that may or may not be something you'd want to consider. That's not even considering the logistics of dealing with animals that weigh hundreds of pounds, which many (if not most) people prefer not to do themselves.  Depending on where you live, chickens may be something you can have right away. My city allows them so I have a small flock which I keep mostly for eggs. They're very cheap and easy to care for and are something you can slaughter by yourself without any special equipment. They're kind of the gateway drug to homesteading. It's a small commitment to kind of give you a taste of what it's like to keep animals for a purpose other than as companions."
homestead,354mqd,loveshercoffee,3,Thu May 7 12:37:30 2015 UTC,"With canning, isn't there a risk of botulism from improper canning? Seems like there'd be certain rules about that, but I don't really know anything about it. As far as keeping chickens, no way my landlord (I live in an apartment) would be cool with it! Though my dad does keep chickens in a coop underneath some stairs at his house, and they seemed like relatively uncomplicated animals. At the very least, there always were good eggs in his fridge. I think I'd like to have chickens if I get a place of my own. However, I thought that egg-bearing chickens are bred for large eggs and subsequently don't give much in the way of meat. Are there actually egg-breeds and meat-breeds, or am I wrong about that?"
homestead,354mqd,germanbini,3,Thu May 7 13:12:15 2015 UTC,"All very good questions!  High-acid canned foods aren't considered dangerous because botulism doesn't survive in an acid environment. That's why jams, jellies, fruits and salsas are allowed. I don't think any states allow the sale of home-canned meats or vegetable products (except pickles) without a commercial license. If you're interested in this kind of thing, /r/Canning is a great resource. I also admin on a Facebook group for learning how to safely can foods at home so PM me if you want to check that out, too.  If you're raising chickens exclusively for meat, there are ones that are very good for this called the Cornish Cross. These are the ones like you get at the grocery store. The only thing is that they really suffer from health issues if you don't slaughter them right away. They are a 2nd generation cross, so they aren't something you can just raise and breed more of easily.   While there are also extremely good laying hens, both regular breeds and crosses, there are also what are called dual-purpose breeds. They're really big chickens that both have an adequate amount of meat at a young age and are prolific layers. They're good ones to keep for both uses and because they're heritage breeds, if you keep a rooster you can keep replenishing your flock on your own. The benefit is that when you do that, you can eat the roosters from each hatch (since about half of them will be boys) and still get a decent amount of meat from a young, tender bird for the cost you put into raising it to slaughter age."
homestead,354mqd,h1ppie,3,Thu May 7 13:34:03 2015 UTC,"Very good and detailed answer by Loveshercoffee!  I would also add that (most) modern (Americans who are separated from the food chain) people aren't aware that meat usually needs a ""resting period"" before you freeze it or cook it.  Leaving to sit in the fridge a while helps the meat get past the stage of rigor mortis and allows the enzymes (useful bacteria) to start breaking down the fiber into something that will be more tender.  For example, with chickens, aging them for two or three days in the fridge after cleaning (scalding plucking gutting) them.  I find it makes the meat more tender.  PS IMHO Rabbits are even easier to butcher than chicken - the meat is similar, no plucking, and you have a nice fur to make something out of!"
homestead,354mqd,germanbini,3,Thu May 7 07:38:16 2015 UTC,"good info.  just one nit to pick, enzymes are generally a type of protein that accelerate a chemical reaction.  they are not alive like bacteria, but they can be destroyed by heat/cooking."

homestead,354mqd,MrBungles,2,Thu May 7 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"I think most people here, and in general, who consider themselves homesteaders most likely have a job.  I know very few people who could pay a mortgage and bills and provide everything they need just from homesteading.  Having a job doesn't mean you're not a homesteader, just that you are not 100% self-sufficient.  Which, in reality, may be a goal that is realistically out of reach.  My idea of homesteading is to be as self-sufficient as possible, but I also want to be able to travel, go to concerts, etc."
homestead,354mqd,WingedDefeat,2,Thu May 7 11:50:49 2015 UTC,"I slaughter and butcher my own hog every year.  It really isn't that difficult.  Will you be a master butcher and proficient in every aspect of the process right away? No, it's a learning experience.  It's a skill that you have to master as you go.    It will take you longer than a professional, the results won't be quite so pretty, and you may have some more waste but every time you do it you will get better and eventually you'll be a pretty competent butcher.  My advice is to start small if you've never killed something much less butchered an animal.  It is far less intimidating to start cutting up a chicken or a goat since your time and money investment is considerably smaller.  Also I'd suggest buying an animal that is already at slaughter weight.  This will get you through the slaughter part of the equation without any of the emotional baggage that can come with raising something from a ""cute and fuzzy"" to ""food walking""."
homestead,3530o9,animuseternal,5,Wed May 6 18:01:48 2015 UTC,"googling is a good idea. Use the internet to check MLS listings, craigslist, and lots of land auction sites.  Down payment depends on the seller, but if you have 25% you're probably close.  Use a mortgage calculator to find your payment based on loan amount. Google that, there's tons of them.  1 acre isn't going to be enough to be completely self sustaining. 3 probably not, unless you're damn good at it. I'd start with 5 and that assumes you don't need to grow wood for heat. You'll need almost 5-10 acres of good forest to have a sustainable wood supply for heat, depending on winter temps. We live on 1.5 acres, but we also have access to and use the 11 acres my family owns, and we get most of our wood from neighbors' land.  What's cheaper is going to be a case by case thing. Once you narrow down location, lot size, other factors, then you can get down to a short list and do a direct cost comparison. There's no general answer for that last question. Just remember, cabin kits don't include everything, things like septic, rural water (if you want that) electrical hookups, all cost money."
homestead,3530o9,OtisB,1 point,Wed May 6 19:21:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the response!   if you have 25% you're probably close.   I have nowhere near this amount, unless you count my 401k, which I'm not entirely sure I want to withdraw yet. Just wondering how much I should expect to be saving up for the down payment and how tightly I have to live.  If I'm looking to buy a pre-existing cabin, I think I should expect somewhere between $125,000 to $225,000, for a cabin with a handful of acres.  If I buy a plot of land, I think I can get sizeable acreage for $15,000-$20,000, then however much the kit costs, then however much all the logistical stuff costs.  Every so often, I can find a listing for a pre-existing cabin that's under $100k in a somewhat decent location.  But.. basically, can I infer from your advice that before I start seriously looking into making a purchase, I should have a minimum of $25,000 in my savings account, and probably safer bet to have $40,000-50,000? ...that... will take a couple of decades, I think.  For whatever reason, I expected a small cabin in the woods would be a lot cheaper. I mean, it's not the $1.5 million that a small house in this area goes for, but I kinda figured it'd be around the same cost value as a Gibson Les Paul and a Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier together (about 8 grand)."
homestead,3530o9,OtisB,6,Wed May 6 19:43:18 2015 UTC,"Lol, well, it costs a bit more than that.  I can't tell you if any of this is useful to you, but this is what I did.  I found a 1.5 acre plot that I knew was in foreclosure. I contacted the bank and we bought the lot directly from them. It had an unlivable trailer house on it at the time. Then I built a basement and found a cheap house to move onto the property. This took me about 2 years to complete. I had the 23,000 to buy the lot, the rest was done on a construction loan which eventually became a mortgage. All told I put 90k into the project. But, I live in south dakota, and to be honest, land prices are way higher here than they are out there. If I did the same project today (instead of in 2004) I would probably pay closer to 50k for the lot alone, because it's zoned correctly and it already had full utility service.  The reason I explain this is so that you know that some roundabout ways work too. I have a construction background so I was able to do a lot of work myself, this saved many thousands of dollars.  Lots of people want to live in the woods, and any livable house on an acreage for a good price is going to look good to them too.  So, what's a sizeable acrage? Is it zoned correctly for you to build a house on? Does it have utilities nearby or are you going to have to pay a fortune to get them there?   Let's say you can buy 10 acres for 20,000. Let's assume that you can get financing for it, and just borrow that amount. Assume you don't need running water, electricity, etc. Can you get an old camper and move it there? You could live 2 people in that for a year before you built a house. There's other ideas too, if you're imaginative. How much cash can you save living there for a year, instead of paying rent in the city? Enough to start building a house the next year?   I don't know that you need to have that much money on hand. If you want to buy a place that's all built and just there, yeah you probably do, or at least be able to borrow it through other means.  Also, I'd really rather have a nice clean classic 50 than that new fangled stuff.  :)"
homestead,3530o9,kennerly,2,Wed May 6 20:09:17 2015 UTC,"I want a very small place, with few amenities. All of that sounds really good, except:   How much cash can you save living there for a year, instead of paying rent in the city?    None. How would I work? The places I want to live are at least six hours from where I live now and my company is not likely to be keen on me living out in the woods and trying to do my work from a random Starbucks.  This is why the plan has always been to save up while I'm here, pay everything off, and then move out there. But that plan looks less and less realistic the more I've been crunching the numbers. I have $50,000 in student loans to pay back; I pay $2400 a month in rent (not including the $395 a month I pay in parking between my apartment and work).  This is all very frustrating to me. I come from a working class family, and I'm not sure what the point of getting an education and a middle-class job was if I can't save any money. :-/ I thought the whole point was so that we could make enough money to become landowners, but it looks to me that the only way to do that is to keep working until you're near-death.  Anyway, thanks for the advice and tips. I will have to put some more thought into this and develop a more concrete plan."

homestead,3530o9,Wriiight,1 point,Thu May 7 01:24:01 2015 UTC,"Good question here! If I were you, I'd go talk to whatever small mortgage company is in the area you plan to move town and just chat about your situation. I've found the local guys are more helpful than big banks for at least initial advice."
homestead,3530o9,Wriiight,2,Thu May 7 03:38:36 2015 UTC,"You'd certainly get no argument from me for buying something ready built.  If one is in a rental situation, one has limited time or skills, or the property is at a distance, it may even be the cheaper alternative.  Even a simple shell gives one instant shelter that can be made liveable and functional with just a little effort.    I wouldn't, though, discard the idea of properties with homes on them simply because the home is not the vision you had in mind.  There can be some very real advantages on some of those properties, such as maybe a vastly lower price due to a run-down or neglected residence; an overall cost savings by not having to put in a well, septic, electric, phone, and land clearing; the property is already zoned for the purpose or grandfathered in; the possibility the home could be sold to a purchaser that will move it elsewhere or the materials by deconstructing it can be reused (including salvaging worthwhile elements and donating the rest of the structure for fire dept. practise); as a rental for income to put towards the expenses; or simply because it's much easier to obtain financing or at a lower rate.    As for sustainability, there are dozens of books that outline how it can be done (maybe not on all levels) from 1/4 of an acre up to about 20.  I'd really suggest reading though as many as you could find and formulate an idea of what you feel capable of managing, what is practical and realistic for you, and what actually interests you and would give you the best benefits or returns.    While it seems to be a common thing with me to always stress flexibility, it does warrant saying it over and over.  It's rare that one is going to find their dream complete and wrapped up in one neat package.  Focus on the main goals and fill in the rest with as much as possible.  One way to do this is start three lists, one of needs, which are the non-negotiable must haves; next are wants, those things that lacking a few isn't a deal-breaker, but it's likely that a minimum number of them must be present; and desires, not necessary, great to have, maybe something that's more enjoyable than practical, isn't something important enough to be an item on a property search list (most times it's something you could put in or do yourself later should the opportunity arise).  You can actually even do this in reverse to identify the things you absolutely need to, want to or should avoid.    Next step, lower your expectations (though, also keep in mind, a bargain is only a bargain if it fits), go look at what is available and let your mind wander on what you can do with it (by the way, that's an old realtor trick, show a bunch of properties that are lacking in features and then hit them with ones that hit the right buttons, it's kind of reverse of what happens on a car lot, where it seems the opposite happens, even after seeing just what they came in for, most times it's something different that they drive off in, or wind up with something similar for somewhere else and that leads in to.....); how the property makes you feel.  Sometimes that happens simply because the time is right (yes, there are times the stars have to all align the right way, and even if nothing has changed, like fruit, there is a time that it's simply not there, it's sour, could be picked with hesitation since it may or may not ripen, past it's peak and degrading fast, or when it's ripe to be plucked.)  When I first stepped out of the truck on the property I bought I knew right there and then it was the one.  It was somewhat smaller than I had targeted, it was priced more than I had intended, the lot was narrower than I would have chosen, but it had the essential elements I required, a number of things I wanted to have, and a few bonus items or features.  The main thing, though, it felt like where I wanted to be and call home, and as I'm approaching 12 years with the property, I have no intentions of going any place else or wish I would have looked longer or at more properties."

You learn a lot when you get away and just explore and you might find some areas that you really like that are off the radar an less expensive.  If you are early in the process, start practicing just using different search tools.  Set up alerts so that when something that is along your desired price and size comes along you can start seeing how much people are paying for different features, price per sq foot, price per acre etc.  Keep everything broad at this point.  Even Craigslist is worth setting up some automatic searches.  Don't get frustrated, many of us have been in your position at one time.

homestead,3530o9,thomas533,3,Thu May 7 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"Ex-Real Estate Agent here....  If you are not sure how to look for land, then I would highly suggest getting a real estate agent. Most listings you find on-line are going to already be listed in a Multiple Listing Service and as such already have the agent fees worked in. And even if you negotiatte the price down with the justification that you, working without an agent, shouldn't have to pay that fee, the contract the seller signed already has that payment worked in. Any price adjustment you negotiate, you can get with an agent involved too. That being the case, you are making a lot more work for your self by not having an agent.  A good agent will do all this foot work for you. They look at properties all day and if the right one pops up, they will email it to you. A good rural land agent will know the local building and land regulations. They will steer you clear of any encumbrances or easements. They can help you deal with water rights issues, wetlands, critical systems ordinances that would effect your plans for the property. And best of all, they will hear about pieces of land that aren't yet for sale, and they can connect you and the seller before it goes on the market.  Avoid any agent that wants you to sign an exclusive agreement. It is perfectly fine for you to use multiple agents and expect them to work to win your business. Anyone who tries to lock you into a buyers contract is not going to work hard for you.   If I were you, I'd figure out what agents have a lot of land listings in the areas that I want to buy in and call them and ask if they work with buyers too. If they don't ask them for agent recommendations.   As for your specific land questions: How much land you need all depennds on what you want to do. If you want to be entirely self sufficent with crops and meat (and growing the feed for those animals) you need 40-80 acres. If you are alright with buying the feed for those animals, you can get by with 3-10 acres. If you just want to grow your own produce and plan on buying most of your meat off the farm (excepting for chickens, rabbits, or maybe a few goats) 3 acres or less is fine. In fact, there are lots of us that live in urban/suburban areas with less than an acre that have chickens, goats, bees, etc. as well as large gardens. Really, the most I think one or two people could manage gardening by hand is 1/4 to 1/2 acre. And that is enough to grow all the produce you need for the year."
homestead,3530o9,eye_can_do_that,2,Thu May 7 16:42:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. This is very useful.  How much money should I have saved up before I even approach an agent, then?  Our plan was to fish/trap/hunt a good deal of our protein, garden much of the vegetables, and probably go into town on a certain schedule to buy large sacks of rice for grain."
homestead,3530o9,priamos,4,Wed May 6 20:27:08 2015 UTC,"I'm going to provide a counter argument to the real estate agent, which is that I had one and he was absolutely useless, and in fact tried to screw us over by telling us at the last minute there was a mystery ""interested buyer"" who was bidding way higher. We called his bluff and walked away, he came begging back at our previous price. He also had no clue about homesteading, and was incapable of evaluating whether a property was useful for homesteading or not - fortunately we could do that ourselves. Also, 1/4 to 1/2 acre isn't much, especially if you want to be growing at least some of your own fruits. Trees take up space.  If you're considering being in the mountains of Virginia - which is a good idea incidentally - why not look for a tech job in Virginia? You'll save money compared to where you're living now, and you can start learning about how to grow in Virginia, which is a very different game than growing in the Bay area. If you can work it right and buy a property where you can get proper internet access, you could work remotely and do well for yourself. We're on the very outer edge of our provider's map, but we manage to get high speed internet out here, even if we have to have a special... uh thing for cell phones to actually get reception.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulles_Technology_Corridor  Another option you might consider is the Triangle in NC for career stuff - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Triangle  It sounds like you are horribly underpaid and living in a place that is ridiculously expensive, so I'd first work on that, and maybe pick up some skills on the side.

Sounds like you got stuck with a bad one becasue you didn't do a good job of interviewing them. And to be perfectly blunt, an argument that consists of ""I fucked up this way"" is not much of an argument. A cautionary tale, sure. But a good real estate agent is like a good CPA.

homestead,3530o9,PotatoPasted,1 point,Thu May 7 15:56:25 2015 UTC,"If you are buying raw land, most banks won't give you a mortgage for that. A lot of land owners are willing to owner financing, where they carry the loan though. Expect to put down 25% and pay 5%-10% interest on a 10 year loan. How much you need entirely depends on what you are buying though. 5 acres an hour from the city might cost the same as 40 acres four hours away. But you might be able to get broadband internet access on the 5 acres where as the 40 acres only has dial-up availible. So if you are considering being able to telecommute to a job, that might be a consideration.   Around where I live, 5 acres near most towns goes for between $30k-$40k. I'm hoping to put down at least 50%."

You take in a lot of extra calories, but you're gonna have a lot more time to develop and maintain your musculature. I have a set of gymnastics rings hanging inside my home and winter is the best time to train.  When spring rolls around and you need to carry a lot of stuff here and there (barrels for gardening, soil, etc) or doing a lot of hard work, you don't want to be in a state of conditioned laziness from months of winter rest. Rather, you'll want to have strength, vitality, stamina so that all that hard work is significantly less hard.  At the same time, this is a good period to study and develop new skills, plan out new experiments for the following season, and doing what maintenance is necessary from the inside."

Bacteria and viruses/ virii. 3. Volatile Organic Compounds and other organic matter.        For most of the initial roof debris and bird poop, I suggest installing a rain water diverter or roof washer on a standard gutter. This diverts e first ten gallons or so of rain out of your system, so all the water that gets collected is relatively free of debris. I would also recommend a pre-filter for your rain barrel as well was before you place it in you filter system of choice. For the filter system itself, I would suggest a Berkey or ProPur countertop drip filter. They remove water additives, VOCs, pesticides, particulates, and pharmaceuticals from the water by carbon block adsorption/ silver-impregnated ceramic combination filtration. They both are NSF/ANSI certified by Standards 42 (chlorine, taste, odor, and particulates), 53 (Cryptosporidium, Giardia, lead, VOCs and MTBE), and 61 (no leeching of toxins into water). It has an absolute 0.2 micron filter, which may not be effective against certain viruses, but with rainwater that should be of little concern. Sawyer has a bucket system that is rated at 0.1 microns and a few reverse osmosis systems are rated even smaller, but I've never tried them. The berkey can be stored at any temperature if its dry. Storing below freezing when wet will damage the ceramic filter, but that is a problem with most filters. Also, storing water for a length of time is problematic if you don't chemically treat it, if that's what you are thinking of doing. If price is a concern, and you are not supporting several people, I would probably just invest in the prefilters and combine it with a bladder drip backpacking filter like the sawyer mini."

In this case a good portion of the video is how to get a tape measure around a pig that doesn't want to be measured.  Once you've got that figured out, this is what you need to know from this video:  Measure around the pig behind the shoulders. Call this A. Measure along the back of the pig from ears to tail.

homestead,34v1mf,Dannleece,5,Wed May 6 17:10:07 2015 UTC,The term for this condition is called dampening off. The seedlings are staying to moist and a fungal issue has harmed the plants. They look like they are stretching for more light as well.   Provide more light and try using a small fan on low speed to keep them drier and assist in stronger growth.   Here's a very helpful link on correcting dampening off.   http://gardening.about.com/od/gardenproblems/qt/Damping-Off.htm
homestead,34v1mf,ladyerwyn,2,Tue May 5 04:17:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds spot on. Root issues. Looks like way overwatered. Seedlings shouldn't be watered more than about once a week or when your medium starts to dry on top to about an inch  down. Also, young roots are fragile. Try not to transplant to soon to avoid shocking the root system."

homestead,34r6mx,Backyardmeat,2,Fri May 8 04:20:34 2015 UTC,"Laying eggs all year round is hard on their bodies, even if you supplement their feed. They are not created to lay non stop, their bodies need breaks. When they first stop laying from decreased light, I gave them a couple month break, then 2 months on and another break before the days get longer and they start to lay naturally. One year I had so many eggs stored before they stopped laying that I only had them lay one month in winter.  With that said, chickens (red junglefowl mostly) are omnivores, related to pheasants (good source of natural diet information). During egg laying they need lots of insect protein and high calcium grit. They can get that from snail shells as well. I raised meal worms, gardening worms for some of my insect protein for the girls. I also gave them fish heads and carcasses from filleting, and my deer carcasses during hunting season.  I got fish heads and carcasses from the fish shop in town during winter.   They looked like a bunch of velociraptors on the deer carcasses. :) Best eggs you ever had."

homestead,34o4wt,Surlytaco,8,Sat May 2 23:26:34 2015 UTC,"1st thought: Holy shit! that's a good well to be pushing that much water.  2nd: You said bored well. At 100 years old, I was wondering what the casement is. Is it sided with rock or cement? Either way the casement probably has a ton of cracks in it being that old. This allows groundwater and sediments to filter in from the sides. A properly cased well will allow water to only come in from underneath. This would cut down on sediment quite a bit.  So yeah, my non-expert opinion is to have the well dug out and recased. The water line is already there and I presume that the pump is in the house. I would have a well company look it over. A dig and casement shouldn't cost all that much. No more than 4k or so on the high end."
homestead,34o4wt,Digipete,6,Sun May 3 00:21:33 2015 UTC,They can recase without digging it out. Basically they run a sleeve down the inside of the concrete or rock well. It works pretty good.

homestead,34o4wt,Digipete,3,Sun May 3 05:18:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for correcting me. Tad drunk last night.  And yes, that is pretty well exactly what a proper well is. A quick read that will explain quite a bit is the wiki article on aquifers.  In my local area (Western Maine) we have kind of an odd situation. We have lots of tiny underground 'streams and rivers' feeding a large underground 'lake' if you will.  If you don't live over the 'lake' you have to find one of the 'streams and rivers' to put your well. This is one of those things that are quite tricky to do. Anybody with a dug well is getting pretty well ground water. The only way to hit the aquifer is to drill to it. It is well known that if you don't find water after 170', stop, move over 10' or 15' and try again. I know of 2 people that ignored that rule. One drilled 850' for a pretty well dry hole (less than 1/2 gallon a minute), and another drilled 965' for the same. In both cases they moved 10 feet and tried again.  This part is conspiratorial, and naysayers would disagree and say I'm being an idiot, but a friend of mine does dousing. He has a GOOD reputation around here of finding the absolute best spots on a given property to drill. I was with him one day when he doused his own property. You could visibly see the welding rods he was using come to attention over a certain spot. They twitched lazily at points here and there, but at one location they JUMPED.  He drilled to 50', hit a pressurized underground river, and now has a well that even in the driest of summers has water coming out of the top of it.  Personally, I wouldn't even try to locate a spot without him on board. Honestly? He could just be obscenely lucky but, well...(Cue X-Files theme) I WANT TO BELIEVE"
homestead,34o4wt,kennerly,2,Sun May 3 12:40:51 2015 UTC,"A well is basically just a hole in the ground that is dug below the water table.  The water table is the surface where the water pressure head is equal to the atmospheric pressure.  So depending on where your aquifer is and the porosity and permeability of the aquifer that determines where your water table will be, which determines how much water there will be in your well and how fast it will replenish.  In a deep well the water level may rise above the actual water table due to pressure in the aquifer.    You should think of the water table as more of an underground lake than a stream."

In about four or five years they were about $300 to $500 for a decent one. This is because thousands of companies suddenly stopped making VCRs and switched over to DVD players.   In this case we already know the factory that will be producing the product is going to be huge when finished, and Elon made it clear he's going to be building more such factories. Eventually these batteries will be considerably cheaper as the initial sales will have payed for the cost to develop the product as well as the cost to build said factories.

I fitted 2 x 220Ah 12V deep cycle batteries from Fullriver for about (from memory) $1800 (smart charger not included) that gave me 5.2KWh. (5 years ago) Now that seems like it's not too bad as a comparison as the sticker price on the 10KWh unit from Tesla comes in at ~$AU4458  When you look at the $/Wh comparison you start to see the difference. Tesla Battery: $AU 0.45/Wh (10KWh Standby power unit) and $AU0.54/Wh for the 7KWh unit intended for domestic use Sealed lead-acid deep cycle: $AU0.35/Wh    With that in mind I doubt my lead-acid deep cycle will last another 5 years, then there is the shitty formfactor of the lead-acid not to mention the weight and need for ventilation.  Li-Po batteries are more stable over time and harder to abuse than a sealed lead-acid deep cycle battery.  I hope some of that helps.  Edit: Shit my math was wrong on the $/Wh calc..."

homestead,34kw2k,KamaKaZzie,1 point,Sat May 2 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're far more tolerant of abuse (charge/discharge) but their energy density (Volumetric) is crap compared to Li-Po NiFe: 30Wh/L Li-Po: 250-730Wh/L  There is also the issue of self discharge. NiFe: 20%-30%/month Li-Po: Per Month    Loss Temp    8% 21 °C   15% 40 °C   31% 60 °C    If your Li-Po pack is at 60 °C you have bigger issues to deal with than self discharge loss   The charge cycle times also point toward the Li-Po batteries as being a better choice (7 hour full cycle charge time for NiFe).  As far as expected life of cell discharge/charge cycles go the NiFe battery kicks major ass, another upside is their minimal environmental impact.  Edit: found some prices for the NIFe cells in Aust... ""OUCH"" is all I can say...  For a 400Ah@12V setup I'd need 20 x 200Ah@1.2V batteries at $AU148 each or 10 x 500Ah@1.2V Batteries (for 500Ah) at $AU321"
homestead,34kw2k,InformationHorder,1 point,Sat May 2 19:28:27 2015 UTC,"Right, but if you're powering a house with it combined with a renewable like Solar you're still better off with the NiFe's. 20-30% discharge in a month seems irrelevant since you're always charging at least a little bit, even on a cloudy day, and all it takes is one sunny day to be at full power again, even in the winter. This is probably a much bigger deal if you live somewhere really far north and have long winters. The NiFe's are a ""buy once, cry once"" sort of option, especially for a house. And 20 of the ones you need is still just under $AU3000, which is STILL cheaper than the Tesla's $3500. Seems like the only advantage the Tesla has, based on what you said, is energy density and charge speed so it doesn't take up a whole room's worth of space in the house with battery."

The 7KWh unit is for daily use with frequent discharge/charge cycles.  The bug advantage with Li=Po over NiFe is their ability to use short charge periods, say a 3 hour break in the weather.

But by the numbers, it really is one of the most sustainable means of raising meat. Reproduction rate is insane, something like 300lbs of meat from one female over the course of a year. Plus growing their feed is fairly easy, especially in comparison to other farm animals. You don't need acres of land and heavy machinery dedicated to a mono-crop.  Raising them yourself you have complete control over their diet, their quality of life, and ultimately how they are put down in the end."

homestead,34ia52,pyromunky,7,Fri May 1 16:08:54 2015 UTC,"Averages of meat production change drastically depending on situations. My does average around 8 kits per litter, but usually only five survive to butchering. Each doe can have a litter every three months if you rebreed them after their last litter is a month old, but it seems nicer to give them more time so every four months is more reasonable. Factor in that failed breedings, miscarriages and mothers just fucking up are a common and annoying reality and you can expect just three successful litters a year. I would butcher at around five pounds or more. So you would get at least 75 pounds of meat a year but you could easily get more through a few methods: Providing extra light during winter, rebreeding the doe sooner, Providing higher protein food than I do (I feed my does hay and forage quite a bit, and the pellets are only %16 protein) and limiting the space your rabbits have to exercise.

homestead,34ia52,TotesMessenger,4,Sun May 3 00:10:23 2015 UTC,"300lbs is pretty unbelievable. People who get around 100lbs a meat a year have some pretty serious setups including lights that are on all the time, climate control, and some serious amounts of feed. I find it quickly gets into the territory of what I wanted to get away from when I got rabbits. That is, large factory settings with animals removed from their natural environment.  We average about 6 kits making it to slaughter for us. They dress to about 1.5-2lbs a rabbit. I am in the hot south and I give everyone a break in the summer. It is just too hot here to carry around 6-10 rabbits in your belly. Usually we work in 3 breedings a year. That comes out to be 27-36lbs of meat a rabbit."

They are also higher maintenance than any other livestock I have experienced (with the only exception being horses).  Rabbits also produce an immense amount of dander and shed fine hairs that float about. As someone with a mild sensitivity to it, it did not add to the enjoyment of keeping them.  The only plus is that when it comes time to harvest them you don't mind at all since they were such a PITA.

homestead,34bjab,Yanrogue,14,Wed Apr 29 20:56:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good idea if you like the area. Here's some of my thoughts on it.  There's always branches and crap laying around from the loggers. Rent a chopper and use the chips as mulch focusing on areas where run off will tear thru your property. Buy some straw bales and use them to break up points where water will pick up speed.  If you're interested in permaculture at all, now would be a good time to lay in swales and ponds. Geoff Lawton has some basic videos that changed my views on water storage and movement, and how I looked at property.  Figure out where you might want to place your house and plant trees that you'll want when you do build.  Consider planting the entire rest of the property with a fast growing hybrid that paper plants use for pulp. By the time you're ready to build the trees will be mature and you can sell them to recoup some of your investment."
homestead,34bjab,stuckit,5,Thu Apr 30 01:11:34 2015 UTC,One thing to consider is what was previously grown and harvested there and for how long.    If it was mainly pine trees for timber the soil could be fairly acidic I believe.   Some plants you put in will do well perhaps blueberry but others may struggle.  But sounds like you would have enough time to amend it.   Are you usually nearby to do maintenance or travel around.

homestead,34bjab,Bigfrostynugs,5,Thu Apr 30 17:03:15 2015 UTC,"to prevent erosion and build soil, cover as much of it as you can with mulch. If they left behind all the tree branches, turn them into wood chips and spread them around. Find out who does the tree trimming and wood chipping along the roads and offer them beer to come dump their loads at your place.   Hay/straw works too. I've had a pretty easy time finding free straw that has gone slightly moldy.   Cover crops also do a great job of protecting and building soil. Buckwheat and Hairy Vetch bulk up quickly and are excellent living mulch. Mow them down and leave them where they fall. Instant mulch.   It's a heck of a lot cheaper easier to protect and keep the soil that's been building up for thousands of years than it is to make new soil if yours washes/blows away."

homestead,348u8o,Titan_Lucy,3,Wed Apr 29 05:26:05 2015 UTC,"Root veggies can be left in the ground for a long time before harvesting, or you can put them into a makeshift root cellar. Just put some soil in a tote (rubbermaid bin of whatever size), throw your roots in, then cover with more soil. If you keep it cool and dark, the veg will stay dormant.  Beans and broccoli I would suggest canning. Tomatoes as well, although you will need to process them a bit more before they're ready to be canned. Think pasta sauce, or soups.  Chives can be dried, just bunch them up, hang them upside down somewhere warm, and in a few weeks they'll be dried. Chop them and put in a glass bottle (we just reuse old glass spice jars) with a bit of rice in the bottom to collect moisture.  Freezing things breaks up the cell walls, making stuff mushy when you reheat them. Best to only do that with stuff you don't mind having a weird consistency. Things like lettuce we just eat as much as we can, then give any surplus to neighbors, coworkers, or anyone else."

The term probiotic is currently used to name ingested microorganisms associated with beneficial effects to humans and other animals.  Introduction of the concept is generally attributed to Nobel Prize recipient Élie Metchnikoff, who in 1907 suggested that ""the dependence of the intestinal microbes on the food makes it possible to adopt measures to modify the flora in our bodies and to replace the harmful microbes by useful microbes"".  A significant expansion of the potential market for probiotics has led to higher requirements for scientific substantiation of putative beneficial effects conferred by the microorganisms.  Studies on the medical benefits of probiotics have yet to reveal a cause-effect relationship, and their medical effectiveness has yet to be conclusively proven for most of the studies conducted thus far.

I think you might be making your theoretical future more difficult by being vegan. I'm not suggesting you start keeping pigs and eat ham every day for the rest of your life, but you're missing out on a really great protein, calorie, and vitamin source: eggs. Chickens are easy to take care of and you can make their lives as good as any pet Labrador. Their eggs are unfertilized. Their manure is extremely useful. From where I stand I see no moral or ethical quandary with keeping some animals who would otherwise be in a stock pot or a factory farm as happy and healthy as you can, and enjoying what they give you in return. Then again, I'm not vegan, so what the fuck do I know.  Mountains: Look at the Ozarks. The winters in the Rockies can be harsh."

Growing up my family had free-range chickens that we kept for eggs. I want to do the same thing. They are freaking awesome and insect control, fertilization, and of course (unfertilized) farm-fresh eggs.  I'm vegan now because I'm incredibly suspicious of ""Free-Range, Organic Eggs"" that are mass produced. In the end I don't see myself ever actually eating the chicken but rather processing it post-natural death for further revitalization and nutrients for the land and any other co-existing animals. I'm 10000% on board for eating unfertilized eggs as a staple of nutrients and protein.   Thank you so much!  I'll focus looking at land around the Ozarks more now.

homestead,3447r1,caretotry_theseagain,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:27:57 2015 UTC,"I just finished buying land and building a home on it with the purpose of becoming self-sufficient.  When searching for land, I found a lot of nice lots that I initially stuck my nose up at because they had a mobile home on it.  Looking back, I realize this could have been a great opportunity.  Say you find a great place with a crummy, old mobile on it.  You can get by living in said mobile while you build a new, better home for yourself.  Likewise, the crummier the mobile, the more leverage you have in lowering the price.  A lot of people simply sell their lots with the assumption the mobile home will be removed and the buyer will have to pay for removal and disposal.  Another nice thing about such a setup is that chances are, there's already a well and septic for the mobile.  You can use these for your new home and save quite a bit of money.  Even if you don't use the grid being supplied to the mobile home, any contractors hired in building your new place will use the power in construction.  Plus it can be a bridge between now and your 5 year goal of being off grid.    Just wanted to throw that out there since no matter where you look, chances are there will be pieces of nice property with lower price tags because of a crummy mobile home."

The people with kids that we knew that did meat rabbits typically sold them and kind of removed themselves from the meat aspect of it. Butchering your own pets is a difficult thing to do, much less for a kid.    The approach I would take is getting them into 4H or something similar, and focusing on breeding and raising a meat breed of rabbit. Dont plan on actually butchering any of your own for a while. After a few litters, it should be easy for them to see the breeding pair as the ""pets"" and the kits as the meat. I would keep that separation. Always have your breeding pairs be ""pets"" with no plans to butcher."

homestead,33wed4,C5tWm77t5hMJC7m78845,2,Sun Apr 26 07:10:43 2015 UTC,"Seattle here.  Aluminum. If you are feeling fancy,  do aluminum seamless. They have a bender thingy in a big box truck and make it to length. Less seams equals less leaks. it's really awesome.  The galvanised ones suck, they rust away really fast. Zinc isn't really super great if you are gonna drink the water either.  The plastic kind are kinda cool, but they get brittle in winter and they can probably leach stuff like bisphanol A, since it's usually a PVC derivative. Plastics also tend to break down under UV.  I just have a hard time justifying anything but aluminum because it's so darn inert to the elements, and it's not that hard on humans. We have aluminum pots and pans.  I did find a paper on Google Scholar which looked at roof composition and looked at the pollutants coming off the roof classified by roofing material type. it was interesting but definitely consider plenty of filters if you are gonna drink it or use it directly where it might get ingested.  A lot of people put a nylon stocking over the outlet pipe above the rain barrel as a prefilled,  as around here we have issues with fir tree needles clogging stuff.  I'm still building mine, but i use a bronze raw water (old, used on a boat) intake strainer on the output of the outside barrels. The outside barrels are at the downspouts have removable tops for cleaning. They are old black HPDE pickle barrels.  I have two freeze resistant spigots I've run through the house and into the basement. One is for a vent line, which just needs to be higher than the barrels, and the other is a strained fill line.  In the basement, I have several classic blue HDPE double bung water barrels, which used to hold soy sauce. Before the strained fill line goes in, I will run it through a particle filter and then a UV steriliser (Trojan brand, from amazon). I don't wanna run it all the time, so I might ""make water"" in batches, on an automated timer where it turns on once a day and takes water from outside and puts it into the basement barrels.  Down in the basement there is then a centripetal pump with a pressure bladder. I used a harbor freight shallow well pump, but a little marine washdown pump like a shurflo or jabsco with the pressure switch would probably work better. The HF one also says ""not for potable water"" on the box. Not sure why. There is also a check valve just past the output of the pump so it doesn't back flow.  I have city water at this house this is installed at, so it has two more check valves and normal ball valves so I can switch between the two.  In the cold season, I can use just basement water if the stuff freezes, and most of the sensitive stuff is inside and warm. The bronze strainer is outside because it's messy."

It will be filtered once before entering the storage tank to reduce in-tank maintenance of the water and will filter through 3 filters of different sizes leaving the tank (100 mesh, 500 mesh and then 1,000 mesh) before a large charcoal  filter. I'm sure I will do regular testing of the water due to my own paranoia as well, haha.  The roofing will be standard treated metal roofing. I will need to look more into the material to see if anything bad will be leached."

Don't know what kind of area/climate you live in, but bees love clover and dandelions.   If you're asking how many hives you can keep as a maximum on a particular acreage, that also depends on your region/climate, but most hobby beekeepers in most areas won't run into that wall.

Sometimes vets will just give info over the phone for free, or an antibiotic which is like $10 for a bottle. I took one of my chickens to the vet because a lot of mine had the same symptoms, so the cost for that one chicken helped the whole flock. If you've raised chickens from the time they're chicks to laying eggs, at least for me, the cost of the one time visit to the vet is less than the cost to buy and raise another chicken until the new chicken starts to lay (and less of an opportunity loss because if the chicken dies or stops laying because it's sick, you'll either have to go without its eggs or buy eggs to replace it. If it's alive but not laying, you still have to feed an unproductive chicken). So, in some ways it's not cost effective to take it to the vet, but I think it's up to the individual owner."

homestead,33ob27,TheSilverDuke,7,Fri Apr 24 23:21:55 2015 UTC,Take the eggs and enjoy them. Laying eggs is a natural process and does not cause malnourishment. Give them a proper diet and they will be fine. Under normal circumstances a hen should not be eating her own eggs to get nutrients.  Provide them a nice place to lay (like a nest box or a basket)and take the eggs frequently so the nests do not get overly full.
homestead,33ob27,chipsnguac,3,Fri Apr 24 05:25:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying. Ive heard that even though its a natural process to lay eggs, when we take their eggs continuously their mother instinct kicks in and they lay eggs again, and that this process can apparently be stressful if we keep making it happen over and over again, but Im not sure. Thats why Im asking here"
homestead,33ob27,xPersistentx,14,Fri Apr 24 06:00:32 2015 UTC,"Ive heard that even though its a natural process to lay eggs...   The problem, is there is nothing 'natural' about domesticated birds. Many birds do not go 'broody' and you'll end up with piles of eggs gathering around the yard under random things like your porch or under a bush, and then you'll be dealing with some of the most disgusting smells you've ever smelt. And literally, good layers will lay hundreds of eggs in a year.  If she does go broody, and lays on the egg pile, then with no rooster to have fertilized the eggs, she'll sit there for 3 to 4 weeks, limiting her food and water all for a pile rotting eggs.  Modern chicken feed, called 'layer' feed, combined with a handful of oyster shell, gives them everything they need to stay healthy. They get the chance to eat all they want.  You are best off to collect the eggs and use them. If you do not want eggs, find a feed that is not for 'layers', do not keep a rooster, and you'll find they should stop laying."

Anyway, I understand what you're saying, but like /u/xPersistentx said, domestication has meant years of breeding certain characteristics into birds, including laying tons of eggs (if the hens are layers). Some people would argue that we shouldn't domesticate animals at all, and these may be the same people who say you shouldn't take eggs from hens."

homestead,33ob27,jonpint,2,Sat Apr 25 05:52:31 2015 UTC,"As someone who eats a mostly vegan diet, but also has chickens as pets, I've questioned the ethics behind eating their eggs as well. But to add some insight to your question, very few of my chickens have ""gone broody"" and most have no desire to sit on or eat any of their eggs. So why not enjoy them yourself?   My first chickens were rescues. Since then, I've also purchased several from a local breeder and facilitated a hatch from the fertilized eggs I gathered myself from the backyard. I love chickens now! They are amazing pets and a constant source of amusement for me. The eggs are just an added bonus :)   Although I suspect my opinion may be unpopular here, I do not feel as if the only reason to have chickens is to consume their eggs. If eating them bothers you, I would still collect their eggs instead of leaving them to rot around your yard or under a hen whose health will suffer trying to hatch infertile eggs. Give them to your neighbors or scramble them up for your hens."

The challenge you will find is getting sawdust for your toilet cover material. Fortunately we have several Amish saw mills near and they let me go and get sawdust about anytime I want for free. If you can get sawdust then composting humanure is very easy. Plus if you have ground like I do, then you can use all the help you can get in building your soil.   That said, if you are required to have a septic system then you will have to get it fixed. Also could you rent a backhoe, dig the hole, then have a concrete company come out and drop the tank in the ground for you? If so you may want to go that route.

For instance, I live in a apartment building a few miles outside a small town and its septic tank was installed in the 1950's. Drain pipes are all clay tile. Still in good working order. Septic tanks do need to be pumped out every few years. Last time this tank was pumped (it's a 5000 gallon tank) it cost the landlord $900. He has it pumped every 8 years or so. The building is a ten unit. I can't imagine what could go wrong with the tank. The leach field sometimes can develop problems because it can become silted up and no longer drain properly leading to a messy smelly swamp at the end of the line as nasty liquid bubbles up to the surface. If you are handy enough though, you could rent a backhoe, and dig your own new drain field and have truck loads of gravel brought in etc. Something to consider."

homestead,33f9ig,divesail,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:46:04 2015 UTC,It also depends on how hard the soil is. And how far they have to move it to the truck.  Also how wet/heavy it is. Operator skill is important too. Make sure everything is out of the way.  Tight places slow the work down.
homestead,33f9ig,tinydisaster,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:57:19 2015 UTC,"They probably start the clock when they show up. Probably takes 1 hr to load and unload. That leaves 3 hours of  bucket time.  if the operator needs to be careful, then they will work at reduced efficancy. Manoeuvre around things, close to a house or tree or something, etc.  I'm guestimating, but let's say that the bucket holds 1/10th of a cubic yard, and it takes 30 seconds to dig and dump and return. (They should be faster but size of machine, blah blah blah). So that's about 2 cubic yards per 10 minutes. Or 12 per hour.  If it's like a trench, they might have a trenching bucket.  If it's a hole for like a septic tank, then it's probably a wider bucket.  The soil conditions, if they hit a rock.. blah blah blah.  Wolfram alpha can convert dimentional space to cubic yards. A 10 foot by 10 foot by 10 foot hole is about 37 cubic yards. That's about 3 hours at the above rate. Probably a small machine for that task.  You can see a proper excavator below, at a similar 86 dollar rate, the buckets are 3x and up bigger. At which point, even with the small bucket, it would be like an hour.  http://www.chucksbackhoe.com/equipment.html"
homestead,33f9ig,rcrracer,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:31:47 2015 UTC,One problem with using just an excavator is moving whatever they are excavating.  Sometimes a backhoe loader is a better option.  Sometimes an excavator along with a bulldozer is the way to go.
homestead,33f9ig,hedspase,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:10:59 2015 UTC,"An option might be purchasing a used backhoe/loader from craigslist.  I bought a 25 yr old massey furgeson construction version for $4000 5 yrs ago, and have moved a lot of dirt including raising a 50' x 50' area by 2' to put a shed on, and digging a 20' x 20' x 10' basement for my house.  It's also great for pulling stumps, and the loader is used for hundreds of other things."
homestead,33f9ig,amrfixit,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"If the operator is experienced he can move a LOT of dirt. As it has been stated conditions are a big factor. Are you sure you need an excavator? Could the work be done with a bulldozer? I would plan to have a second job ready, even a small one, if he finishing in less than four hours then you get that Koi pond you always wanted. I had a guy come out with an excavator and in less than two hours he had dug a hole big enough to bury a mobile home and cover it up. Good luck."
homestead,33chh7,frugalNOTcheap,3,Tue Apr 21 12:17:39 2015 UTC,"Speaker wire is copper while the conductive wire in the fence is probably galvanized or zinc coated. A current running through dissimilar metals will eventually cause corrosion.  Instead, find some coated, galvanized fence hook up wire. Patriot and Zareba make some specifically for this purpose: hooking up electric fences to energizers.  http://www.zarebasystems.com/store/electric-fence-wire/01404-92  If you have a Tractor Supply Company store or a local farm supply store nearby, they will have this and some alligator clips or crimp connectors on-hand."
homestead,33chh7,tolmeda,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:23:22 2015 UTC,I talked to the fence manufacturer and they told me something similar. I took your advice and got a similar wire at a local farm store.
homestead,33chh7,mcapello,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:13:08 2015 UTC,"I use Premier 1 chargers and netting, and I've found they always have great customer support. Their chargers aren't cheap. If I were contemplating a change like this, I'd call them to make sure there weren't going to be any unintended consequences to changing the length of the wire."
homestead,33bsp3,Lil_Psychobuddy,9,Tue Apr 21 06:12:49 2015 UTC,The Ozarks - Southern Missouri. Acreage is cheap and the land is arable.
homestead,33bsp3,repeater75,3,Tue Apr 21 12:28:47 2015 UTC,The Ozarks are beautiful.
homestead,33bsp3,stusic,7,Tue Apr 21 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"I'll cast votes for Texas and Missouri, basically the only states left without a mandatory statewide building code.  This means that enforcement is done at the county level, and in a lot of rural areas that means no enforced building codes.  If you can self finance, that makes DIY construction very possible (often banks will require inspections & permits, etc).    I hear good things about the ozark portions of Missourri, but am more familiar with central/west Texas.  East Texas is far more arable (rainfall), but the population density of other parts of Texas is very low."
homestead,33bsp3,mikkelibob,7,Tue Apr 21 14:13:45 2015 UTC,"I would say Alaska.  You can buy undeveloped land directly from the State, or through second party, or through several other routes.   In many areas, there are no property taxes and there is no state income tax.   I am a Realtor up here so ask or PM if you have any questions!"
homestead,33bsp3,907Pilot,6,Tue Apr 21 08:18:05 2015 UTC,I find the prospect of trying to make a living off the land in Alaska more or less terrifying. What's good about being a homesteader in Alaska?
homestead,33bsp3,WingedDefeat,10,Tue Apr 21 09:38:23 2015 UTC,"If the global warming worst case scenario happens, you'll be sitting pretty in Alaska with a much longer growing season."
homestead,33bsp3,gizram84,5,Tue Apr 21 14:16:07 2015 UTC,"no taxes for starters, great growing season for your hardy vegetables (you can can them for preserving), no building code in many places so you dont have to have a general contractor build your home, abundant wildlife to hunt for essentially free meat, subsistance fishing (you can catch enough red salmon during dipnetting season to feed a family for a year). I could go on and on"
homestead,33bsp3,907Pilot,3,Tue Apr 21 15:32:38 2015 UTC,"I've looked at Alaska before, but I've never seen the government sell more than 8 acres at a time. And I've heard a lot about land being ""inaccessible"" but I'm no stranger to driving through deep mud or snow so as long as I can operate a vehicle in the area I can get anywhere."
homestead,33bsp3,907Pilot,4,Tue Apr 21 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"There are several big parcels available right now through government land auction.   ""inaccessible"" just means that it's more adventure to get there! It usually means aircraft, boat, or snowmachine only. Those are the cheapest ones to purchase. The work that you do on the raw land is what increases it's value."
homestead,33bsp3,WingedDefeat,2,Tue Apr 21 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"What about light tracked vehicles, like an armorless M2 Halftrack? (It was converted to a flatbed before I got it, so it weighs about 2tons.)"
homestead,33bsp3,WingedDefeat,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:44:10 2015 UTC,"As awesome as those are, I don't think they're designed to deal with such an incredible amount of snow. Plus you'd probably have to either convert it to gasoline or install tank and line heaters to cope with the cold."
homestead,33bsp3,WingedDefeat,4,Tue Apr 21 21:32:11 2015 UTC,"Its already running gasoline, though I'd probably need an engine defroster. And as far as snow goes, you said tundra, so I assumed muddy/melty permafrost.  Yes, for snow deeper than 2 feet I'd definitely need to make some modifications, but I was assuming snowmobiles and 4 wheelers in the snowy season."
homestead,33bsp3,Emergency_Ward,2,Tue Apr 21 22:05:50 2015 UTC,"Someone apparently really doesn't like the idea of you driving a half track around Alaska, since you seem to be getting downvoted a lot."

homestead,33axd2,thesploo,2,Tue Apr 21 14:28:31 2015 UTC,I just flipped the container upside down. The bottom is clear so I made the lid the base and used a year that fit in the lid to hold the soil. Problem solved.
homestead,33axd2,natashska,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"an old storm window, a piece of plexiglass, plastic wrap for food, pretty much anything clear that will close the top up and trap moisture in. You could also cut the center of the tote lid out and caulk one of the above in the center if the piece you have laying around wont quite cover the top."
