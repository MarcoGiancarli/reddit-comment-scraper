bassfishing,3e1naq,MrShapinHead,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:29:00 2015 UTC,"Great catch! It's awesome you've taken up fishing. I can't think I a better way to take me out of the minute to minute rush of the week.  Quick note on holding the fish though. Especially as they get bigger try to keep it supported on it belly too. If you're not super careful, their jaw could become dislocated if pulled too hard. So it's better to always play it safe and support the fish in multiple places: the jaw firmly but not pulling and the belly.  Again, I'm psyched that you're fishing and I can't wait to see more catches!"
bassfishing,3e1naq,Nc772,2,Tue Jul 21 12:28:04 2015 UTC,"Vertical is fine it won't hurt the fish. It's when you attempt to hold the fish horizontal by only the jaw is where its potentially dangerous. Look at how every pro angler holds fish up after the weigh ins. It's vertical.  Only thing I would criticize in the pic is lose the lip ""pinch"" and hold the entire lower jaw with all four fingers tucked under the length of the jaw. Picture for reference.   http://images.flwfishing.com/images/00/01/49/000149380_original_1024x1024.jpg"
bassfishing,3e1naq,MrShapinHead,0,Tue Jul 21 12:37:40 2015 UTC,"Vertical is fine, but better with 2 hands. Rule is if you see the lower lip jut at an angle like that"
bassfishing,3e1naq,Jeffrey8magee,3,Tue Jul 21 13:47:46 2015 UTC,Only if the fish is like 6+lbs. vertical is completely fine with that fish he caught.
bassfishing,3e1naq,inkw3ll,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:23 2015 UTC,"Holding it with two hands is always preferred of course.    But it's perfectly fine to hold Bass vertically for a few moments as long as you're supporting the jaw by tucking your fingers under the lower jaw's membrane for additional support.  If you hold a Big Bass (3lbs or more) vertically by pinching the middle part of the lower jaw with a couple finger tips, you're running the risk of breaking it.  Remember, the left and right lower jaw forms together in the middle of it's lower lip.  If you pinch it in the middle with no jaw support or body support, it may break.  Especially when they begin to flail.  Smaller Bass you don't have to worry so much while holding vertically.  But holding any Bass horizontally by the jaw alone is a huge no no.  Respect the fish."
bassfishing,3e1naq,Nc772,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:13 2015 UTC,I always hold bass to avoid the whole lower jaw protruding out like that. I've also had many bite down on my hand while holding them like I described which tells me it's not hurting anything and they still have full mobility. Out of water fish care is key I'm with you 100%
bassfishing,3e4p0a,zeek0us,3,Tue Jul 21 22:54:22 2015 UTC,"I'd buy a bag of zoom trick worms, two shaky heads, a box of 1/4oz or 3/8oz bullet weights and a pack of 4/0 wide gap hooks. Then either tie on a shaky head with a worm or tie a Texas rig with a worm, then drag either slowly through the hydrilla and stop in any gaps. If fishing a shaky head, stop in any gap with slightly slack line and just jiggle from slack to barely tight, just enough to shake the lure but not enough to pull it towards you; then continue dragging slowly through the plants until the next gap, a hit on a shaky head is usually either a thump or sudden inability to feel the lure on the line. When you feel anything that may be a hit, send the hook home, hooksets  are free and when you hook a fish, think about what that felt like and look for that feeling. If you're using a Texas rig, drag it until it's into the opening, then pause for a second before lifting the rod tip so as to make the worm lift off the bottom and glide into the foliage ahead of it. Then drag again, a bite on this will feel the same as on a shaky head. Remember, both these lures are pretty much weed less and setting the hook anytime you feel something different can't hurt you,  it'll just teach you what a strike feels like."

I think ill break out the Xrap over the deeper parts of the lakes where there is less weeds. I absolutely LOVE XRaps. Thats the first thing to go on in the spring amd ill use it for two months then switch to weedless soft plastics and frogs when the veg gets thick. I love the Xrap 08 in perch color but aslo like the orange and hot steel colors. Ill try this guys method of very fast retrieve. Is it a bunch of swift twitches and burses or normal xrap cadence super fast?

That said, today I fished the afternoon to sunset and got skunked, my friend fished from sunrise till about 10:30 and also got skunked. Yesterday we both got around 7-10 each in 2.5hrs before sunset. I fish a lot of weedy ponds in Illinois. Topwater bite has not been that great with the exception of a few great days. I know it's been said a hundred times, but in hot summer weather nothing beats a deadsticked wacky senko or a texas rigged plastic dropped right next to the cover the fish are sitting on. I look for holes or irregular spots in the weedlines and put the plastic right in there. Hope that helps."

I went in CT yesterday at the hardest part of the day and caught 10 bass in 101* heat index. I was using livetarget feild mouse in a thick salad of vegitation or ribbit frogs. We also used keitech swimbaits. If theres fish in their they will eat these new keitechs O swear its like cheating. 90% of my nass this year are from them and they are great for beginers. We all have our bad days but thats when you learn a different technique. Just keep at it and constantly move and cover as much water as you can.

bassfishing,3dqdgk,fingered_a_butthole,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:06:04 2015 UTC,this was my first time using them. but this guy grabbed on after only 3 or 4 casts. I'm sold! gonna pick up some different colors today. do you have any suggestions on rigging?
bassfishing,3dqdgk,Sean_Slayer,3,Sat Jul 18 16:15:21 2015 UTC,I always rig them the way you mentioned in your other comment.  It's the only way I have been catching big ones so far this year.
bassfishing,3dqdgk,labiaflabia,3,Sat Jul 18 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"Texas rig it with no weight. Killer set up and a lot more weedless. This is my go to shallow water bait in the spring/summer. I usually use yum dingers in watermelon red, and sometimes dye the tail."
bassfishing,3dqdgk,underpants5000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:30:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I normally just use t-rigs, never weightless though.  I've been messing around with different rigging. I was very excited to have such success with weightless."
bassfishing,3dqdgk,QualityChild,2,Sat Jul 18 17:59:43 2015 UTC,I only use weight w senkos on real windy days.  Not a pro tho
bassfishing,3dqdgk,underpants5000,2,Sat Jul 18 21:55:11 2015 UTC,"Black with blue flake 4"" is my go to. I use that 1st at any new lake. They usually always produces nice fish. Yum makes some as well for only $3 my buddy just pulled a 5 1/2 pounder out of this local lake with one the other day!"
bassfishing,3dqdgk,Jeffrey8magee,2,Sat Jul 18 21:34:55 2015 UTC,I went out Thursday and they were biting so well we tried all the dumb shit in our boxes and every color size and shape caught fish. It was awesome. Senkos are dynamite in dark green Always
bassfishing,3dqdgk,Jeffrey8magee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:53:35 2015 UTC,Caught at 6:15am on a private secluded pond. Water was the clearest I've seen in this area. Caught on a pumpkin seed senko. He ripped my last one right off! This is the first time I've used a wacky rig. I used a 1/0 mustad on 4lb test mono. Just hooked it through the middle with the hook exposed. Any tips?
bassfishing,3dsebc,GuardianOfYourGalaxy,4,Sun Jul 19 00:22:26 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by set up? What line you should use?  A good all-purpose line is 12 pound test monofilament. You can do pretty much everything short of flipping heavy cover with the stuff, although as the saying goes, jack of all trades but master of none.   If you're fishing dirtier and shallower water, you can up it to 15-17 pound mono, since you won't want to dig into the bottom with your crankbaits and whatnot. I think the 12 will get you through most clearer water situations.   Hope this was the answer you were looking for."
bassfishing,3dsebc,I_am_the_lamb,0,Sun Jul 19 02:34:15 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I was wondering about! Thanks.
bassfishing,3dsebc,evilgorillamask,4,Sun Jul 19 04:00:34 2015 UTC,40-50 lb braid
bassfishing,3dsebc,evilgorillamask,2,Sun Jul 19 02:49:46 2015 UTC,To whoever downvoted this : you're a fucking noob. 40 lb braid is the equivalent of 8-10 lb mono...which he already has equipped on his spinning setup. The braid will let him fish frogs and jigs more efficiently.
bassfishing,3dsebc,ree4,0,Sun Jul 19 12:01:22 2015 UTC,i agree the braid would be more efficient for topwater fishing but when using jigs the fluoro takes the crown since it is nearly invisible.
bassfishing,3dsebc,evilgorillamask,0,Mon Jul 20 03:56:10 2015 UTC,Yeah fluoros great if you want more memory than a slinky
bassfishing,3dsebc,ree4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:58:01 2015 UTC,"Meh, different brands provide different results.  I use to diss fluoro until I tried P-Lines option, still a bit of memory but nothing like what I have experienced with a few of the other competing brands."
bassfishing,3dsebc,evilgorillamask,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:04:22 2015 UTC,To each his own of course..but the invisibility thing is pure marketing bs. The difference between fluoro and mono is negligible..and the stretch factor actually points to mono being more dependable.  http://www.bigindianabass.com/big_indiana_bass/the-truth-about-fluorocarbon.html
bassfishing,3dsebc,Eyemarten,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:25:50 2015 UTC,Fluoro tends to sink right to the bottom and creates snagging issues. In my experience at least...
bassfishing,3dsebc,badbetacells,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:10:55 2015 UTC,"10 lb mono on the spinning rod and 12 lb mono on the caster. That is pretty basic, but it will get most any job done. Big fish and heavier baits."
bassfishing,3dsebc,ree4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:43:58 2015 UTC,"I use the Pro Max as my go-to setup for jigs and I actually just changed up from 40lb braid to 12 lb P-Line Fluorocarbon.  If you do more topwater fishing the 40 lb braid may be more ideal, however I prefer a line that sinks when I am using jigs.  I also prefer that tiny bit of stretch fluoro gives you."

bassfishing,3dns6m,colinwehrle,4,Fri Jul 17 19:48:26 2015 UTC,I would have had a god damn heart attack when it hit the lure right in front of me like that.
bassfishing,3dns6m,PC_Mustard_Race83,4,Fri Jul 17 20:00:01 2015 UTC,Those are my favorite kinds of hits. Right when your about to pick your lure up out the water a bass smashes it
bassfishing,3dns6m,vdubgti18t,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:55:13 2015 UTC,"its always channel cats that hit bass lures; had a good 10 lber hit a chatterbait.  Thought for sure I had a state record bass until I saw the long body/tail.  They are fun to catch though, so can't complain!"
bassfishing,3dns6m,indoobitably,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"Ha I had the same thing happen not long ago, but with a chain pickerel.  Set the hook and saw the fish flash sideways in the water.  I saw how long it was and thought I had a monster bass, at least 2ft long.  Then I reeled it in wondering how in the hell it felt so light.  Was still a cool catch though, like you said."
bassfishing,3dns6m,PC_Mustard_Race83,0,Fri Jul 17 20:36:19 2015 UTC,Right before he hit i had several nice size bass follow it to shore - i really thought i had one of them until I saw the body.

I put like 1/4 oz of lead (crimp weights) maybe 4-12"" above it so the worm will suspend off the bottom near wherever the fish are holding. I use very very light rod twitching to make the worm dance lightly. Senko's are my favorite for this."

bassfishing,3dlplu,ZanzibarSlutmouth,3,Fri Jul 17 17:13:49 2015 UTC,I firmly believe that less fished ponds draw substantially more bites. A golf course seems a primo scenario for a pond to be unfished.

Throw it out there and let it sink to the bottom. Let it sit for 5-10 seconds then reel in a couple cranks and let it sit again. Repeat until the worn is out of the strike zone then throw to again any repeaet. I use a 5"" worn with a size 1 or 1/0 octopus circle"

bassfishing,3dgird,setthehook,2,Thu Jul 16 14:02:23 2015 UTC,"Senkos are all I'm catching them on right now. They are so versatile, it's crazy. I'll have to try this I ring ring. I've tried the heavy line thru the eye, that really does help."
bassfishing,3dgird,guacamole956,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:07:54 2015 UTC,Do you know of any Senko alternatives? I know zoom or yum makes one that is 1/4 the cost but not as heavy. I'm going to try those this weekend. Hopefully they can't tell the difference!

bassfishing,3dfy9x,zxcless,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:36:37 2015 UTC,Are you talking about the long tag end?
bassfishing,3dfy9x,GoldJaguar,2,Thu Jul 16 12:19:42 2015 UTC,"That, and it doesn't look like a name brand knot. Kind of looks like they just tied it off until it was tight, no routine or anything."
bassfishing,3dfy9x,zxcless,2,Thu Jul 16 12:24:44 2015 UTC,A long tag end is better than a short one. Start throwing heavy swimbaits and you'll be purposely leaving tags longer than your thumbnail. And there is absolutely no fucking way you can tell whether that's a legit knot there or not. Name brand?  Stop posing.
bassfishing,3dfy9x,evilgorillamask,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:59:51 2015 UTC,"that's not a heavy swim bait  zoom in, brand name knots are symmetrical/uniform, his is not   You're so cool."

bassfishing,3dfy9x,GoldJaguar,2,Thu Jul 16 13:04:08 2015 UTC,"I always use my net when fishing with crankbaits. Had a close call as I was going to lip a fish a few years ago, she shook loose as I was about to lip her, and the crankbait went whipping around my hand. Thankfully it didn't stick in, but that made me realize how this happens to people. Net 'em all on a crank ever since.   Side note, if you're interested in getting a net, get something like the Ego Slider with the PVC coated mesh net. It's fairly deep and still very flexible, unlike most rubber nets, but you still get the advantage of a ""rubber"" net that your hooks can't get stuck in."

bassfishing,3de9yv,UnitedPuppySlayer,2,Wed Jul 15 16:41:36 2015 UTC,"Most of my baits that I use I'm doing my best to imitate sunfish. Whether I'm punching, throwing a frog, spinnerbaits, crankbaits. I'm excited for this bait, but it being livetarget (with or without a trokar hook) it's going to be spendy. I'm guessing probably around $15, but wouldn't really be surprised if it's more. I'd actually be more surprised if it's less."
bassfishing,3de9yv,Atomic_Ten,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:43:37 2015 UTC,"It's actually only $13 which admittedly is a little more than I like to spend on a frog, but its only a buck and half more than the comparably sized Spro King Daddy frog and considering there's nothing else like on the market at the moment, I'll probably be shelling out a few extra bucks to pick up a couple."

bassfishing,3de9yv,evilgorillamask,2,Wed Jul 15 16:46:58 2015 UTC,Good for you my man. Senkos are basically like using live bait. Despicable.
bassfishing,3de9yv,erikmonbillsfon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:37:35 2015 UTC,One of my friends just casts out a senko and drops his rod and there will be so much slack out even if he got hit on the fall he wouldnt know it. Then as the boat drifts his line is now going threw all of our casting lanes. Every time I try and tell him fishing is about learning new things. This year was my first fish off a hollow belly (livetargetfeildmouse) so now i have that added to my arsenal.

bassfishing,3de9yv,erikmonbillsfon,0,Sun Jul 19 11:39:53 2015 UTC,Most states will say its illegal to use a sunfish as bait either for catfish or Bass. Truth is its banned cause its deadly.  Step 1: Catch a sunfish  Step  2:  rig with 1/0   2/0  circle hook couple feet under a bobber Step 3: wait and watch rhe bigfest bass in the pond come and slam that bluegill  This bait is the one im most excited for this year. ICAST has released a couple details. It will have super sharp lazer trokar hooks which i feel like is a first with a hollow belly. Also the paint job looks so sexy. Every frog out there has a white belly. If its an overcast cloudy day the white frog belly gets lost in the white clouds. Bass will see the purple and orange bluegill colors alot easier IMO. Im so excited as there are no shad where i am in CT so the main forage is bluegill and perch. If they offer those two colors Ima have to buy them even at the 13.50$ price tag.
bassfishing,3de9yv,UnitedPuppySlayer,5,Wed Jul 15 16:44:08 2015 UTC,You need to look harder if you think every frog out there has a white belly. But I do agree about the washing out of a white bellied frog in the clouds.
bassfishing,3de9yv,erikmonbillsfon,0,Wed Jul 15 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"Ok so 'almost' every frog everyone has a white, yellow, or black belly. I buy the green sienna frog by Live Target for the coloring of green tan and brown but the bottom is white. One good one is the Spro in Amazon color. Its orange yellow red and green. Gives the fish something new and a sharp contrast to the green lillypads and green slop. But i like the killer gill color yet the bottom is still white so why should i buy it if i already have alot of white belly frogs."

bassfishing,3de6sl,MartyFromNC,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:26:34 2015 UTC,"My game plan would be to find where wind will push bait to shallow water adjacent to deep structure first thing in the mornings  No wind and/or no bait=no fish. We're fishing similar conditions in texas and have to go down to 20 or 25 feet to find em. Once the sun is up, i'd graph all the structure that looks good and try to find a good school. I'd throw at it until they decided to turn on. If that didnt work, it'd be down to the deepest brushpiles i could find with a shakey head or drop shot."

bassfishing,3de3l0,Albino_Echidna,2,Wed Jul 15 15:35:55 2015 UTC,Shimano shimano shimano. Best spinning reels hands down. I would go with the best one you can afford in a 2000 series. The 1000 is smaller than you think.

bassfishing,3dbvl3,BukBasher,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:04:53 2015 UTC,MTB   What is that?  Edit: Mystery Tackle Box. How much stuff comes in it?
bassfishing,3dbvl3,Dreadbane,2,Wed Jul 15 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"You usually get about $25 worth of stuff in the box. Often it will be something like one $12 hardbait and some plastics and terminal tackle, or a couple of $6 or $8 hardbaits with some plastics and hooks and scents or something.   Since I have received a couple of questions about MTB, let me explain a little bit more.  Month to month, it's about $15 a box. If you sign up for a year I think it comes up to about $12 a box. I already have a really good base of all of the lures I need/want, so for me this system is perfect! Every month it's like christmas when I get a new box in the mail.   You ALWAYS get more than $20 worth of gear. Sometimes you won't use it all though, like I got some fishing line that I didn't need in one box. But overall I am quite satisfied.   I've received crankbaits, topwaters, jerkbaits, spoons, jigs, chatterbaits, plastic worms of all kinds, soft body swimbaits, craws, drop shot hooks, EWGs, offset wormhooks, hell I even received a ""hoo rag"" to cover your neck/face (great for the sun or the mosquitos), soap to clean away fish smell, scents.   Seriously, if you are at a point where you think have a decent collection of tackle that covers all of your immediate needs, I highly recommend a service like Mystery Tackle Box or Lucky Tackle Box (which I haven't tried but seems to be pretty good as well). It's just a great way to discover new baits and it really does prevent me from going to the fishing section of every store I visit to buy something new.  edit: MTB also offer boxes for panfish or walleye now as well and I think they will be adding more options soon"

Yamamoto have been working better for me lately as I can T-Rig them and let them drop slower.  My most successful lure lately though, have been those black and silver shad you see in the top right, which is why I got more.  This time of year the hatch is out, the fish are finally coming out of the post spawn fluke and starting to get active again, but are hitting smaller lures as they're used to seeing the small shad in the water.  I just toss a shad with a jig head on and bounce it off the bottom and it's been working great for me this last week."

bassfishing,3dcnnu,Thementalrapist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:11:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, possibly.  I think some lures are out there to catch the angler and not the fish."
bassfishing,3dcnnu,vdubgti18t,2,Wed Jul 15 15:44:44 2015 UTC,"I think it will be good in the heat of the summer, all bass will eat bluegill, but not all bass feed on frogs, especially if they aren't an abundant food source. For those that think it's the same as using a frog it's not. When you're getting top water bites it's usually a reaction strike, this bait is designed to not only get a reaction strike but also mimic a dying food source bass are familiar with."
bassfishing,3dcnnu,rballa19,2,Fri Jul 17 01:53:35 2015 UTC,"Idk how I feel about it. It pretty much the exact same thing as a hollowbody frog.  The only difference I see is instead of the two ""legs"" a hollowbody frog  has been replaced with a tail. Could help with short strikes"

bassfishing,3dc9ku,greenmen88,3,Wed Jul 15 03:38:50 2015 UTC,There's a lot to be said for quality hooks. With the Texas rig make sure you're giving them a good hook set and reeling up slack before setting to really drive the hook out of the plastic and into the bass. If that isn't an issue I'd get a new pack of quality hooks and see if that makes the difference
bassfishing,3dc9ku,skrewflanders,2,Wed Jul 15 05:05:24 2015 UTC,"Get you some flipping hooks. The straight shank helps drive in the hook, especially in a kayak with almost no leverage on the fish"

bassfishing,3dc9ku,badbetacells,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:16:38 2015 UTC,Really? I thought the snell knot was only good for set baits like when you're catfishing... that's the only knot I use when targeting big blues and flatheads. I'll give it a try this evening
bassfishing,3dc9ku,anakusis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"I am a strong believer in using quality hooks. Flipping requires a lot of plastic for the hook to penetrate and a pretty forceful hook set. If you are not using thicker, super-line, or actual flipping hooks you could be bending the hook making you miss other fish. Pay attention to this next time you are out if you don't buy more hooks. If you can feel the fish or see your line wiggling...let the bass have it a little longer...reel up and set hard! Sometimes the bass may just short strike things; however, this is less likely because the bait is coming very close to them without a lot of movement on their part. I do not know anything about kayak fishing and I hate (can't) set the hook sitting down."

I used to use braid, and switched to spyder wire and immediately could cast my lighter lures.  Also, you may have to mess around with your break and spool tensioner when you change between lures."
bassfishing,3dbx1i,eightblackkidz,2,Wed Jul 15 02:03:36 2015 UTC,"Very true. Additionally, it would be very economical to change lines!"

bassfishing,3dbx1i,eightblackkidz,2,Wed Jul 15 02:07:08 2015 UTC,"Yea mono usually doesn't act like braid when casting.  I'd really mess around with your break and spool tensioner on your reel when casting and changing lures.  A good rule of thumb I use when changing lures is messing with the break and spool tensioner until the lure will slowly fall when you press the release button.  If all else fails, you should probably look into a new reel not rod for better all around success.  Best of luck !"
bassfishing,3dbx1i,badbetacells,2,Wed Jul 15 02:14:05 2015 UTC,"For bass fishing in general and considering the actual varying weights of lures it is hard to have one all around rod IMO. I think having one bait caster and one spinning rod with you is best. If you are shore fishing it really isn't that much more to carry. I don't know anything about those Duckett rods, but I would add a spinning rod to your collection."
bassfishing,3dbx1i,TheSuperFluke,2,Wed Jul 15 02:13:35 2015 UTC,"A Duckett Ghost is a very good one. I really like mine, even though I don't use it a whole lot anymore.

bassfishing,3dbs39,SlavKO72,2,Wed Jul 15 01:17:42 2015 UTC,"Some of the slow bite is just good ole' summer bass fishing. I think punching the weeds with a heavy Texas rig would work well if you are in a boat. If you fish from shore, I would use a weightless worm or a Carolina rig to keep the bait above the weeds. I am not sure how grassy ""tons of grass"" is, but if you are good with crank-baits...try ripping a rattle-trap if there is some water movement/wind."
bassfishing,3dbs39,badbetacells,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:20:12 2015 UTC,Thx. Grass goes from shoreline to avg 4 foot out. Within 2in of surface to as deep as I can tell. Obviously some pockets.  Also lots of random roads of grass in the middle of the lake.

As for the hollow body frog the fish could be to small. OR what big bass do is slap the frog to stun it and then come back and smash the frog. So if you get a hit/bit try to watch the frog and or reel up the slack until you feel the weight of the fish and set the hook.

bassfishing,3d7kz0,aggiebq13,2,Tue Jul 14 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"I generally only use braid for flipping or fishing heavy stuff. The handling of good quality fluorocarbon beats it for applications where I'm making a lot of casts or where my risk of getting hung is low. That being said, lighter braid is not a bad choice for fishing generic texas rigs. You'll have better sensitivity, no memory, and if they happen to dive off in the thick stuff, you can lean on it to get em out. Its something to try for sure. If you're getting excessive backlash off of some memory though, you might need to adjust your reel or make sure that the weight of the bait you're thowing matches what your rod is rated to handle comfortably.  As far as using a leader, I wouldnt worry about it unless you're in very very clear water, using a very small finesse technique, or if it boosts your confidence."

bassfishing,3d2cyz,aggiebq13,0,Mon Jul 13 14:49:07 2015 UTC,It looks a little malnourished
bassfishing,3d2cyz,Bmont35,-2,Mon Jul 13 00:19:27 2015 UTC,"What can happen when you have a fish with a frame that big, but is skinny, is that the fish has eaten discarded plastics. Its kind of like a lap band for bass since they cant digest the plastics. The reason i say this is because his other fish appears healthy. Just a theory though."
bassfishing,3d0vlc,Augie19,2,Sun Jul 12 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"Caught this morning around 9:00 am. Slow moving bend in the river, water was pretty murky so I was using a white 3/8 oz spinnerbait. About 2 seconds after my lure hit the water this beauty blew up on it. Put up a good 2-3 minute fight. God I love smallies"
bassfishing,3d1tja,KrombopulosMichael,2,Sun Jul 12 20:55:46 2015 UTC,"I fish mostly wacky rigged but it sounds like you might be retrieving it too quickly if I am understanding you correctly. After the initial drop I normally twitch it a couple times and let it sink again while taking up any additional slack. Then twitch again, let sink, bring in slack, etc. I usually only repeat that a few times before just reeling it all the way back in since I would say 90% of my bites are on initial drop or after first twitch.   I am no expert by any means so I am hoping some other will chime in. I would be interested to hear how others use them."
bassfishing,3d1tja,HomerOfWind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:34:50 2015 UTC,It is kinda weedy where we are and Wacky rigs seem to bring up a lot of weeds. Also do you have any problems with fish not striking your hook?
bassfishing,3d1tja,HomerOfWind,2,Sun Jul 12 21:39:19 2015 UTC,I do get a decent amount of bites that are gone when I go to set the hook but I also bring in a decent amount of fish on the senko so I'll live with it.  Are you sure you are setting the end of the hook in the senko properly when rigging? I could see how putting the end of the hook too deep into the senko might cause some hook set issues.
bassfishing,3d1tja,hurtsdonut_,2,Sun Jul 12 21:54:50 2015 UTC,You are probably setting the hook to quickly. Real down when you feel the bite as in drop your rod tip and real in the slack. Then slam it home.

bassfishing,3cv8nv,d0nt_eat_that,6,Sat Jul 11 01:33:24 2015 UTC,I have never used them. If I want to add noise to a soft plastic I just put a bead between the worm and and weight on the line. Creates a nice click when you jig it around.

bassfishing,3cv8nv,ROGUE_KID,2,Sat Jul 11 02:13:48 2015 UTC,I've never even seen those but I feel like they would be pretty deadly on a drop shot trick worm. Does the buoyancy of the air in them make them weightless?  Or do they sink?  That may take away from the action of the plastic.
bassfishing,3cv8nv,Silver90500,2,Sat Jul 11 03:44:53 2015 UTC,They are  pretty small and low profile when added into the plastics and barely effect them. All they do is add a slight rattle to make the bate easier to find for the fish. Pick them up to add that slight edge!

bassfishing,3cuinp,eeeaaagle,2,Fri Jul 10 21:56:04 2015 UTC,"Well, a bass is a bass, so they will strike pretty much the same baits. I fish the Potomac here and there, as well as the Youghiogheny River lake, and the fish fight much harder than lake fish. Fish love currents, so see if you can locate faster moving water. If you're on a boat, please be careful with this, and never drop anchor in fast moving water, it can create very dangerous situations, very quick.   But with that being said, look for cover, down trees, docks if the river has them, etc. Fish will relate to cover, whether it's a river or lake. If the river is turbid and looks like chocolate milk, darker baits will work well."
bassfishing,3cuinp,TheSuperFluke,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:14:45 2015 UTC,"River fishing is more difficult to me due to being in current. A pretty basic rule to keep in mind is look for current in lakes and look for still areas if it is a quick moving river. If the water is clear and rapid, fish a brightly colored lure about mid-depth and retrieve quickly. If the water is tannic and slower, fish lures that make noise or soft plastics slow."

Ive caught the smallest bass off 5/0 EWG hook. I have no idea why people use the tiny straight shank hooks then wonder why it goes down their mouth. Once i switched to 3/0 and up on all my frogs swimbaits and worms i have never hurt a fish. Try it i promise ive caught 8 inch bass all the time in CT with big hooks and all safely released

bassfishing,3crhhp,macfanboi,2,Fri Jul 10 15:01:49 2015 UTC,I go in the gills to. Just be careful of the gill plates. A single knick can cause them to bleed to death
bassfishing,3crhhp,Bassman5802,2,Fri Jul 10 10:42:43 2015 UTC,"Generally if the hook as been swallowed, I will cut the hook as much as possible, if possible, then give the fish the hook. It doesn't guarantee the fishes survival, but it gives it a much better chance of making it. Giving the fish the hook is much better than gutting it. But I mean actually swallowing the hook, not just deep in its mouth.  One tip for deep hooks is to go in from the gills. Take your needle nose pliers, and enter in through the gills. Typically can give you a better angle to get the hook. I think Lake Fork Guy on youtube has a video about that, but it may be someone else."
bassfishing,3crhhp,TheSuperFluke,2,Fri Jul 10 04:57:06 2015 UTC,Wow thanks alot. I hadn't considered going in from the gills.
bassfishing,3crhhp,Honeynutz21,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:24:03 2015 UTC,"As long as the line is still attached then hope is not lost.  I've had fish take the hook to where you can't even see the eyelet! All you need is to pull gently on the line and then the hook will pop up out of the throat and then you just go through the gills with needle nose pliers.  As long as the line is attached still, there is no reason to leave a hook in if you know how to get it out properly.

bassfishing,3crhhp,badbetacells,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:36:16 2015 UTC,"There are many arguments to be made for leaving it or removing it. My rule of thumb is if the point or barb is visible you should try to get it out; however, if the fish starts to bleed...cut it loose."
bassfishing,3crhhp,blatherdrift,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:13:22 2015 UTC,don't remove it. the fish has a better chance with the hook left alone.

bassfishing,3clstr,arkr,2,Thu Jul 9 01:11:01 2015 UTC,It is really going to depend what type of body of water you are fishing. A rough estimate of lake size/tidal or non tidal/ weedy or rocky lake or any other descriptions you can give would be helpful. Also it would help to know what you have tried.  Between shallow and deep there are likely some fish somewhere you have been fishing... with water temps in the 70's the fish shouldn't be too stressed so I would suspect maybe a major change in lure/presentation would help.
bassfishing,3clstr,arkr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:16:00 2015 UTC,"I'm fishing a 2800 acre reservoir. The bottom has some rock, mud, sand, etc... but it is primarily a muddy bottom. The depth where I fish gets to about 35 feet in the creek channel. Here's a crappy map: http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/Portals/wildlife/Maps/Lake%20Maps/PDFs/hooverreservoir1.pdf  I have mainly been fishing senkos (wacky and Texas), swimming jigs, and crankbaits. The bass I've caught have been on wacky senkos and a crankbait. I've thrown spinners and some topwater lures, but haven't even had a bite there. I have also been using Navionics for a better contour map, but am having trouble finding any really great structure to fish.  Honestly, I haven't been able to find a single school of bass. I'm typically a crappie guy and am just getting serious about bass, so I could be doing a lot wrong. I hope that's enough info to give you an idea of what I'm doing."
bassfishing,3clstr,Bassman5802,2,Thu Jul 9 04:08:15 2015 UTC,"I do like your set up, you can cover a lot of water with those three baits.   I'm not sure what the water clarity is like, but if the water is heavily stained you may want to try a chatterbait (aka bladed swim jig) instead of the standard swimjig. I know sometimes rain can really muddy up the water and that can make a visual bait like a swimjig less effective. I like to put a small swimbait tail on the bait of my chatterbaits, or a twin tail grub. I generally fish dark colors, like green pumpkin or black, along with a lighter color trailer. This bait can cover a fair amount of water and trigger sluggish fish to react.  Whenever fish get really thrown off around me I will search for visible shoreline structure (even just working a shoreline or a weedline) and finesse fish it (offshore works too, but is much more difficult to find). One of my favorite ways to do this is to deadstick a senko. Essentially you are going to throw the senko as tight to the structure as possible and let it sit there for about 10-15 seconds. Then twitch it, let it sit another 5 seconds and reel it in. It can be an incredibly boring technique, but certain days it can be very effective. It doesn't always have to be great structure to hold fish, things like small trees and docks can be very effective fish attractants.   Good Luck and let me know how you do!"

bassfishing,3ci5mh,tehbeast87,4,Wed Jul 8 02:27:14 2015 UTC,"Theres a ton of decent, cheap combos out there. What you wanna keep in mind though is that the cheaper you go,the chances of things going wrong go up quite a bit. I'd reccommend staying in the $100 range for combos.  For me, a 7', medium-heavy, fast to moderate fast action rod is what i consider an all around stick.  You can go cheap on soft plastics, spinnerbaits and buzzbaits, sinkers, swivels, tackle bag & boxes, and tools. For your hard baits, don't scrape the bottom of the barrel. Not saying you have to go buy megabass and lucky craft, but your bargain bin hardbaits often lead to frustration. BUY QUALITY HOOKS AND LINE. You can have a $1000 combo and throw a $400 Roman-Made swimbait, but if your hooks and line suck, it won't matter because your fish is gonna come off. I never understood guys driving around in $10,000+ boats, using $300 rod and reel combos using cheap ass hooks and line."
bassfishing,3ci5mh,aggiebq13,3,Wed Jul 8 03:25:37 2015 UTC,"A wise old man once said something along the lines of ""fancy fishing lures catch more fisherman than fish"".  Don't get caught up in all the fancy stuff, man.  I have a $50  Abu Garcia Walmart combo rod and reel that works awesome. Get you a few crank baits, a couple different  plastics (my personal favorite are Yamamoto), and some quality bait hooks and you're off to the races."
bassfishing,3ci5mh,slownlow86,2,Wed Jul 8 02:39:14 2015 UTC,"Are you going to be fishing from shore mostly? If so, I'd recommend a 7', medium power, fast action spinning rod (3/16-5/8 oz lures). This can cover most techniques outside of heavy cover applications. Spinning rods almost always cast farther than casting for the same lure, which is important if you are fishing from shore.   If you have some experience with spinning reels already, I'd recommend 20 lb Power Pro braided line as your main line. This line can last for years and behaves well on a spinning reel. It will allow you to fish in some areas where typical light mono/fluorocarbon line would be problematic. You can tie on mono or fluorocarbon leaders as necessary as well. If you are new to spinning reels then you might want to start with a manageable mono line like McCoy Mean Green (8#).  The nice part about starting with a medium/fast spinning rod is that it will always be useful (e.g. finesse techniques), even if you acquire more bass gear down the line."
bassfishing,3ci5mh,dunicus,2,Wed Jul 8 13:26:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with u/dunicus.  Go with a spinning rod combo and switch the line to the latest Power Pro braided.. called something like super smooth.  It's at least $20 for 150 yards, well worth the money as it lasts a long time. I use 20 lb too, and love the line.. not found anything that casts as well as it.    Like u/slownlow86, all but one of my rods are inexpensive Ugly Stick combos by Shakespeare, they range from 6"" - 7"".  Over the years I have switched the reels as they go bad, again with inexpensive ones $30 Mitchell & Abu Garcia from Walmart.  The one thing I make sure of is that there is no backlash on the reel.  When you stop reeling the reel locks and will not turn backwards AT ALL.  Cheaper reels with move a little bit backward, really cheap reels will make like half a turn backwards before they stop.    A decent Ugly Stick Combo (The GX2 is the latest version of what I have) + New Power Pro line will probably set you back $80 bucks or so.  You should have plenty left for baits.  With the 7"" version you will have a very versatile set-up.  Able to cast a mile and be fished many different ways.    You can't go wrong with plastics, they're the #1 fished bait.  I use offset wide gap hooks for all of my plastics which include - Zoom Bullfrogs - Yamasenkos in Green Pumpkin, Baby Bass, & Green Pumkin/Watermelon - 4"" Salted Green Flipping Tubes - Various Junebug (It's the color) Worms & Lizards.  The Senko style of worm is my most fished lure.  You can swim it on top, swim it in the middle, bounce off the bottom, or barely drag it across the bottom.  I also fish crank-baits, most all are Rapala.. which are probably the only premium lure I'll buy.. that and Gary Yamamoto Senkos.  I prefer suspended crank-baits.  The easiest way to switch baits quickly is to tie on a good snap swivel.  Don't buy the cheap ones if you're going to use them. With a snap swivel you can switch from a hook to a lure in a matter of seconds.  But, they're a weak link and I've had many fail on me over the years.  Now I almost NEVER use them, after you hook a nice bass and lose it to a broken swivel you might do the same... takes a few more seconds to tie a good knot, which is always the better route.      Good luck and keep your line tight!  If you do you could end up catching one of these.. the first is typical for our pond around 4lbs.. the second is my PB, unfortunately I didn't have the scale or tape measure with me.. that croc is 10.5"" long, so I believe it was over 24""!   http://imgur.com/a/58ZSb"

Pretty common in the kayaking world."
bassfishing,3cfvz4,Toadeeza,3,Tue Jul 7 18:06:06 2015 UTC,I doubt they're easier on the fish than using your hands.  The surface area on which the fish is hanging is far greater when using your hands - therefore the load is spread over more of the jaw. You are far more likely to snap a 6lb+ fish's jaw when using what amounts to a plastic vice grip.  I concede that a jaw dislocation is just as likely when using your hands as opposed to the tool but I'm referring to bone breakage in the middle of the jaw under the tool contact point.

Spinning reels are great for finesse because you're generally casting very light things with very thin line, finesse is more like dropshot rigs, weightless small plastics,  1/8oz or smaller jigs,  and anything that is presented with a very light line that requires high sensitivity.  I generally fish with a 6'9"" or 7' Medium Light with a fast action (not extra fast)."

I would cast parallel with the shore, a few feet off the shore.  3. white/cartruse spinner bait.   Also, when you say ""pitching and flipping"", are you referring to the casting methods? if so, I guess those would be appropriate if you have tulies (cat tails) or need very precise casts at shorter distances.

bassfishing,3byak0,cremestick,2,Fri Jul 3 18:28:09 2015 UTC,Try culprit fire and ice color or hot tomato they are crazy looking but actually work. When reeling in a big fish that wants to jump always keep tension side to side horizontily and never keep your rod tip too high or it will jump. When it jumps it can do a head shake and then spit the hook on a slack line. Some times its better to almost zig zag the fish around and let it tire out and never let it get its chin up.

Rod setup was a 6' MH, 6.3:1 black max spooled with 12 lb. test mono.   Overcast skies and a full moon (along with more snags on the bottom than I'd like to remember) led to me waking the spinnerbait over 2'-3' of dirty water.   I'd like to say this is my PB but I caught a few just as big last summer and didn't have a scale, so officially it's my best."

bassfishing,3bz4qr,mulletsaurus,5,Fri Jul 3 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"If you have magnetic brakes I would recommend starting with them up pretty high and casting, then slowly backing off one notch as you get the hang of it. That helped me quite a bit when i started out.   If you don't have them or have already tried that, try releasing super early while casting super lightly. Then slowly build up how much you're putting into the cast.   Those two things definitely helped me out with my first bait casters, good luck!"
bassfishing,3bz4qr,arkr,3,Fri Jul 3 11:30:44 2015 UTC,"I had this issue for months, maybe you're doing the same thing I was doing. (this will be hard for me to explain but I'll try) The key for me was that when I was casting overhand I was trying to keep the reel ""facing up"" the whole time. The key (for me) is turning it 90 degrees while you cast over hand to where the opposite side of the handle is facing away from you. I hope that makes sense and maybe it'll help."

bassfishing,3bz4qr,naul_pewman,2,Fri Jul 3 17:12:43 2015 UTC,I just started using a baitcaster a couple weeks ago.  Took it out a couple times and had trouble doing an overhand cast.  What helped me is to release it when the pole is pointed directly up at the sky.
bassfishing,3bz4qr,innitbruvs,2,Sat Jul 4 23:46:12 2015 UTC,"-Always remember to cast up and not out.  -Tighten the knob on the side of the reel (usually on the right side) to where when you push the button and hold the rod out in front of you the bait very slowly falls.  -Keep your thumb feathering the spool of line.  -Don't try to throw it as hard as you can, usually you can use the leverage of the rod to get you out just as far, similar to a trebuchet.  -Don't get frustrated, I've been using baitcasters my entire life and have had some absolutely insane bird's nest.

bassfishing,3by0sv,evilgorillamask,3,Fri Jul 3 22:44:03 2015 UTC,"Low light conditions right below the surface, fishing it at the speed it swims the widest. If you keep getting followers give it a twitch or a quick reel and it should turn around then die and most fish will inhale it on that. That being said it's a bigger bait so don't get discouraged if you don't catch them like you do on a senko or a soft swimbait like a skinny dipper."

If possible try casting parallel to the bank instead of perpendicular to it for maximum time in the strike zone. Try casting into various depths until you start to get bites. With the frog, try to get it into the reeds without snagging or as close as possible. Also a Texas rigged worm is almost a guaranteed bite in summer.

They will hit the wacky on the fall a lot of the time so keep your line slack and let it sink before u move it. I recommend here senkos and mighty worm. Where u live depends on presentation. Match the hatch! Fish each spot shallow and deep in a fan pattern or back and forth
bassfishing,3brr87,eyememine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:01:11 2015 UTC,Find anything that fish can hide under. Cover from algae/lilys/shade/hanging tree. Punch deep into cover or frog that shit

Also never try to catch a flying topwater. it will stick in your hand. I had to take my brother to the hospital once with a torpedo stuck to 2 fingers.

bassfishing,3br7ki,bigbuzz55,2,Wed Jul 1 16:34:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're being downvoted. Topwater lures are my favorite, but I generally use poppers as opposed to lures with props. What're your thoughts on that?"
bassfishing,3br7ki,Piscator629,2,Wed Jul 1 19:17:15 2015 UTC,Here in Michigan we have a freshwater invasive species from Europe called alewives. They are a member of the Herring family. They are the reason salmon were heavily planted here in the 70's as a control measure as there were no natural predators and they died on the beaches by the millions.  What this has to do with the question is when alewives spawn in late june/july they do it in a frantic group whirl near the surface which is targeted by the now conditioned local predators. the props on the lures give a very similar sound to these mating balls. The devil's Horse is similar in size to an alewive. The native fish have been conditioned to think of this sound as a dinner bell.  My brother and i used this technique to catch fish when other guys could not buy a bite because all the fish are literally stuffed to the gills with alewives.

When the is close to the boat  there's a lot of  force being put on the spool and maybe you're drag isn't set the whole way up. Tighten drag if possible or try thumbing the spool in that situation.

For me, the two critical failures that happen are a) the  spinner blade flying off and b) the wire breaking at the R bend.  I consider the R bend failure due to the operator (me lifting the fish into the boat by my rod).  On the other hand, the butt joint failure is a design flaw that could easily be corrected by a manufacturing change."
bassfishing,3bjik1,Albino_Echidna,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"I've had maybe 4 spinnerbaits fail, out of hundreds. And all 4 broke the hook off the body (and all 4 were strike king brand).

bassfishing,3bikyn,KidReynolds,3,Mon Jun 29 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"Fishing from a boat can be different/difficult if you've never done it before. I grew up on bass boats, so shore fishing for me is difficult.  Without fish finder, you mainly want to pay attention to the winds. If the wind has been blowing west for the last, say, 5 days, go to a bank where the west winds would have pushed bait fish in. Also look for points and rocky banks such as rip rap. Rocky banks tend to hold small mouth, and can also hold large mouth. I caught a nice LM on a large rock flat. Obviously there's other ways of finding fish, but fishing with the wind is a tried and true method.  Boat fishing takes time to get used to. Especially if it's a pontoon, you can't get in close and maneuver into dock spaces like you can with bass boats. But, be persistent, the fish will come."

I went to Dicks sporting goods and bought:  A rod and reel combo. It was on sale for 34.99. They always have some sort of sale. I dont know the brand. Its a ""medium"" rod. (Look on the pole above the spool, itll say the words light, or medium, or heavy, or medium heavy, etc.).    youll need some line. Braided line. They have a billion different brands. powerpro seems to be the most popular. 15 # test or higher. Dicks only had 15 on sale so I got that. Hasnt been a problem yet. I think jt was $13.00   It works just fine.  Dont spend real money on a rod yet.   Bait:  - hollowbody topwater frog. Dicks carries one brand, so I bought that. If you can, buy two. Get one with a light color belly and one with a dark color belly. The color on top of the frog is mostly invisible to the fish, since the thing floats. 5-7 bucks each, but are mostly indestructable. You wont lose em.    worms. 10"" worm with 4/0 offset worm hooks. Youtube how to texas rig a worm. Color.... who the fuck knows. Just guess. (Try to buy one lighter one darker imo) 5 bucks for 5 worms is about standard. They last a long ass time. Dont buy too many, seriously I have worms fucking everywhere, its almost annoying.  so I spent roughly 35 for the rod/reel, 13 for the line, 15 in frogs, and 10 in worms, and 5 in worm hooks...    Knots -  One knot. Palomar knot. Stupid simple, super strong, works for everything.   Been rockin and rolling since."

bassfishing,3biha5,evilgorillamask,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:50:28 2015 UTC,Why?
bassfishing,3biha5,blarghusmaximus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:47:05 2015 UTC,15# braid is insanely small/thin. Most people don't go less than 40-50# braid for frog fishing.
bassfishing,3biha5,evilgorillamask,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah problembis that you wouldnt tie a worm on to 50# braid, and I want the option. If I snap off the 15# i guess ill go to 35#"
bassfishing,3biha5,blarghusmaximus,2,Mon Jun 29 17:28:28 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't you? 50# braid is the equivalent of 8-12# mono depending on the brand you're using. In 20 years of bass fishing I've learned that when the bite is on, it's ON, and lure colors/line size don't make half the difference we think they do."
bassfishing,3biha5,evilgorillamask,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:55:48 2015 UTC,Palomar knot is a good know but I would recomend learning the improved clinch knot instead. If you end up wanting to try other types of lines like fluorocarbon you'll run into trouble because it is a dense brittle line that can break itself with a Palomar.  That being said they are both simple knots so you could just try them both out and decide for yourself.
bassfishing,3biha5,BukBasher,2,Tue Jun 30 02:25:24 2015 UTC,"Where you start is all about budget. You can start with a $40 combo or you can start with a $200 reel and $200 rod. And it can go up from there.  Personally, I say start with a spinning reel. They're easy to use and just have a good natural feel to them. Start with a 6'6"" medium-heavy fast action rod. Solid for multi-use.  Learn the basics of fishing. Learn whats a bite, whats rock, whats mud. Learn your knots. Learn your bait types and rigs. Then when you have that stuff down, go out and get your first baitcast setup.   From that point it's just experience and time (and more money, hah. It can be an expensive hobby!)"

I also opted for a spinning reel vs. baitcaster as there is a wider margin for error around ending up with a ""birds nest"" with a baitcasting reel.  I usually use around 8-10lb test."

bassfishing,3bd0xi,skrewflanders,2,Sun Jun 28 01:40:03 2015 UTC,I found most of the tackle to be novelties.  Stuff Id never use or that was on closeout already.  I gave away or threw out most of it.  Out of 6 months the only 2 baits I actually used and had success with were a sebile crank bait and a spinnerbait.  It's not a bad idea if you have money to burn but if not then your better off spending on baits to that are conducive to your fishing style
bassfishing,3bd0xi,MRDEUCE,2,Sun Jun 28 14:38:39 2015 UTC,I didnt like it and didnt renew my subscription. The idea is cool but the boxes never really give you much thats usable. mostly hooks or plastics.

Tons of variety at a really good price,  but I ultimately canceled it because I wound up with way more than I really needed. Still have a dozen or so bags of soft plastic that I haven't had time to try yet.   Do it for six months to a year,  then cancel it. Good value, but you won't need it for longer."
bassfishing,3bd0xi,thocan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:26:45 2015 UTC,It helped me get into fishing. I had no real experience buying bass lures and was always overwhelmed. It gave me a lot of options and different things to try that I had never tried before and find ones that I liked and had success using.

If you're fishing spinning tackle I'd go with 12-20lb braid for the main line with a 3-5ft 8-10lb fluoro leader. Fluoro's going to help getting the weightless stuff down because it sinks. Mono and braid don't. Fluoro and braid are both low-stretch/no-stretch so you'll have improved sensitivity.  The medium rod is soft enough to negate the need for stretch/shock absorbency in the line.   If you're using a casting rod stick with 10-12lb fluoro dependent on water clarity."

A side from a few Zoom Brush Hogs and other random plastics, i get most of my plastics from them. The Swimming Craw has excellent colors, movement and durability. They are basically the same style craw as the Net Bait Paca craws that everyone loves, just not as big. The only other difference is that the BBB Swimming Craw has a half, solid plastic pour on the tail end, unlike the Net Bait that is completely hollow throughout the whole body. I think it makes the plastic stay on the jig better, while the hollow head end allows for durability (the plastic compresses  easier, thus it doesn't get ripped up as easily)."

Possibly find a livewell additive to help keep your fish alive (dead fish penalties can screw you pretty bad. Make sure you're aerating (if you have an aerator and are using additives) or recirculating. Put them on auto so you don't have to worry about it. Keep the lid shut as much as possible, but check on your fish every now and again. You also might want to invest in cull clips so that you can locate your smallest fish to cull quickly. If you have a split well, keep your big kicker by himself in one side so that it doesnt get cramped."

Both are made by Johnson outdoors and have a lot of the same features. Your best bet is going to be to paddle both and see what you like. Most shops have demo days."

bassfishing,3awtkv,Bobbagonuggetesh,2,Wed Jun 24 23:44:45 2015 UTC,are 3d printers that common?? cant say ive ever had that suggested. maybe a more common phrase in a few years...

bassfishing,3awtkv,_bmc_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:53:21 2015 UTC,"On my boat, below the back seat, I drilled a small hole through the deck and ran a bolt up from underneath with a 1.5"" washer on each side and two nuts on top.  I used a bolt that would thread into the 6"" yellow, floating gopro handle.  So now the handle threads on and off and my camera is under the seat where it's out of the sun/rain.

Would have loved to see her in late august when she's had a chance to fatten up.   The fly rod is great. I fish public water so the bass tend to have seen every plastic; every crankbait and spinner in the book. They can't resist a woolie bugger though.

bassfishing,3athxx,eacansuckmyass,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:28:50 2015 UTC,Use this picture to help measure the length compared to the rod. There are some size estimates that can be found online using length. These aren't extremely accurate though.

Never in my life did i think there was anything in this pond over 2 pounds until i pulled this 4.2 lb Largemouth out of there today. Was using a green and red specked senko bobbing along the bottom.

bassfishing,3asifc,thebearcredentials,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:54:21 2015 UTC,"Well, growing up I was taught to NEVER eat bass. It just isn't option... BUT, right now, the lake I live on has an overabundance of smaller 14 to 16 inch bass. The city actually wants people to keep their limit of those small ones every once in a while to keep the population down so the other bass can grow bigger.  I have to say, this might be my only exception! Haven't eaten one yet, but I've heard they are delicious as well."
bassfishing,3asifc,jakejg46,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:48:32 2015 UTC,"I like they way it tastes. 14 to 16 is a respectable size for a keeper in my opinion.   I think the eating them thing is regional. I was raised in Memphis, TN and my folks raised me eating bass, crappie, and catfish. My friends were the same way.  I have a couple of friends from Iowa, they won't any fish except a walleye.   I'm not going to keep a lunker, I imagine the larger fish aren't as tasty and I want to ensure someone else can experience that fight. All of that said, the various wildlife agencies set the limits for a reason. They aren't going to let a species get fished out and they are going to set the laws so the lakes and rivers stay sustainable."
bassfishing,3asifc,dirtymunke,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:59:49 2015 UTC,"I've been bass fishing 20+ years and I have never eaten a bass. I haven eaten a caught fish before, but I only do it in rare cases. I'm strictly catch and release, but I don't care if people keep them. What does bother me is the people who keep everything the catch. From the 60 pound catfish to the 2oz bluegill. I've seen people come into the docks with coolers full of shit they've caught. Everything from a sunfish to a turtle. And chances are they never harvested it all."
bassfishing,3asifc,TheSuperFluke,3,Tue Jun 23 14:02:20 2015 UTC,"Yea I hate that too.  I was raised on one basic principle, if you keep you BETTER eat or use it, don't waste life for sport or for nothing.  Based on that, if it's not something I want to clean and cook and eat myself, then I don't keep it."
bassfishing,3asifc,rballa19,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:51:53 2015 UTC,"I'm from a small town in Louisiana and I was brought up eating whatever we caught, bass, perch, white perch(crappie), catfish, etc. Pretty much any bass over about 10"" got kept and ate. It's just the way my family was, and unfortunately a lot of the people I know are still like this. They don't understand when I throw back the big ones, they think it should be the other way around.  Now I keep a lot of bass every year, I prefer the taste to any other freshwater fish, even crappie. But when I want fish to eat I go to Toledo Bend where they have a really healthy population and a minimum length of 14"". I usually don't keep anything over 3 pounds anymore.   In the river near where I live I don't keep anything anymore. It doesn't have near the population of bass as Toledo. Unfortunately most of the people around here still keep everything."

They're the sport, in my eyes. Let someone else catch the big boys. Hogs aren't exactly everywhere. Leave em be. #2, they just don't taste that great from what I've heard.  Edit: Its worth noting that I release 99% of my sand/white bass over the year. Usually one weekend in the spring we decide to keep, clean and freeze two days of catches for a couple good meals over the next 12 months."
bassfishing,3asifc,buddhapimping,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:30:35 2015 UTC,"Not a big fan of most freshwater fish bar Walleye, too muddy tasting without extra preparation. I prefer the saltwater fish taste. Fried bass is okay but nothing special, +3lb don't have all that much flavor anyways.  Ethically I would feel bad eating the bigger fish around because that thing is going to be a source of enjoyment for many other people. Good points made about fishery management and the need to cull smaller 'average' sized fish. It all depends on the specific fishery."

bassfishing,3asifc,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:45:48 2015 UTC,"Water quality has alot to do with it for me.  Northern WI gin clear lakes produce some tasty fish in the 14 to 16 inch category.  We usually sneak them in to the pile of crappies, sunnies and rock bass. Rock bass are tasty! (kind of a pain to clean) their closest relatives are the sunfish family and make good eats."

bassfishing,3ar0z7,Bmont35,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:32:57 2015 UTC,I would buy color for the clarity of water you have at your lake/pond. If you buy one plastic in a certain color and it doesn't catch fish what I do is buy a different plastic in a different color and see if they will bite that
bassfishing,3ar0z7,TheSuperFluke,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:52:53 2015 UTC,ok thanks for the input i'll try a couple things out and see what happens

bassfishing,3ant1q,No_too_serious,2,Mon Jun 22 02:33:36 2015 UTC,Thats a huge part of it. Gerald Swindle said the difference between a good jig fisherman and a bad jig fisherman is that the good jig angler believes in it.

bassfishing,3ant1q,HRxPaperStacks,2,Mon Jun 22 03:35:29 2015 UTC,Patience is key to jigging. It's not a lure that will catch tons of fish but the quality of fish is usually better.

bassfishing,3ap6vr,ace1395,2,Mon Jun 22 11:10:38 2015 UTC,You can handle it. First thing thread the line down the eyes of your rod and into the eye of the reel. Next if you don't have a line spool holder have a friend hold the spool for you across the room. I slide a pencil through the holes of the spool of line. You want to make sure the spool is horizontal and the line is rolling off THE TOP of the spool not the bottom. Use your index finger and thumb just above the eye of the reel to keep tension on the spool so it's not too loose going on your reel. It doesn't have to be super tight just make sure it's not going on your spool loose. Fill your reel spool about 3/4 of the way full and that's it! Goodluck! I tried to break it down best I could for you!  Oh also most important rule!! Make sure ceiling fan is Off if doing this inside your home....RIP to my 7' carrot stick :(  not one of my brightest moments.
bassfishing,3ap6vr,BreadfruitSweg,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:16:33 2015 UTC,Thanks I really appreciate that. But the room I'll be doing it in doesn't have a ceiling fan. I won't have to worry about that haha. I'm sure that was a real bummer....

bassfishing,3anytj,BreadfruitSweg,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:15:26 2015 UTC,"Koppers Live target bluegill squarebill.  Seriously, it's a ""will go for swimming for,"" kind of bait. Not only because they work, but because they're $16. Bumps through wood awesome, rips through grass great, and are robust as hell.  I've caught hundreds of bass on mine (my favorite search bait) and more than ten 30""+ muskie/northern.  Although there is some serious hook rash, the rest of the paint is well intact. Even after encounters with such toothy critters.  I upgraded my hooks to 2x but other than that there are no complaints."

I hooked up, droped the rod tip, reeled like hell, and lost the fish in the weeds.  This has happened to me a few times.  In those situations, from now on, I am going to try to keep the fish in about 2 feet of water when weeds are present."
bassfishing,3alryc,AVeryMadFish,3,Sun Jun 21 15:57:02 2015 UTC,You'll learn to feel when they are about to jump. I usually dip my rod down into the water when I feel them coming up fast. I rarely lose any that way.
bassfishing,3alryc,gen3stang,2,Sun Jun 21 19:31:30 2015 UTC,Some fish will still jump using this method if they decide to jump going straight up provides a lot of slack to throw the bait so remember to sweep to the side instead.

bassfishing,3alryc,mcflyfly,2,Sun Jun 21 14:02:09 2015 UTC,"It happens, I lost a nice one yesterday. Usually this is caused by the hook not being set well enough, which is easy to do when fishing with soft plastics weightless. Often if they take it on the fall you can't feel the bite and set the hook to late. Just be very vigilant and keep an eye on your line for direction changes etc. Sometimes you can see it before you feel it."

bassfishing,3ajwcv,TheReddition,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:39:06 2015 UTC,"If you're not sure, you can always feel the tongue. Spots will have a little rough patch on their tongues that largemouth do not have."
bassfishing,3ajwcv,Toadeeza,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:51:11 2015 UTC,"That's a spot. The dorsal fin is the clincher - largemouths have a separated dorsal fin; spots and smallies don't completely split the dorsal fin.  Also, as already said, you can easily spot a dark raised rough area on the tongue. It feels a bit like very stiff velcro."
bassfishing,3ajwcv,aggiebq13,4,Sun Jun 21 10:59:18 2015 UTC,"I think its a spot.  The spots, while faint, are still pretty visible in definable rows, it doesnt look like the jaw will extend past the eye, and the two parts of the dorsal fin are bridged together pretty well."

bassfishing,3ainf3,Eyemarten,2,Sat Jun 20 21:41:23 2015 UTC,"on point, but I think one ounce may be overkill for pads, since once you get past the pad on the surface there's not really any other obstacles to warrant all that weight. save the one oz's for duckweed, hydrilla and other vegetative mats with heavier root systems. plus it won't fall so fast and they can see it flutter down. also op, let a swim bait or fluke fall in those holes if you can't get bit on top, or happen to miss a surface strike in that area. last thing...popular opinion says to use superheavy braid like 80 pound or whatever when fishing in the pads, but the thinner the diameter, the better it slices through stems when you are fighting a fish. I wouldn't go below 30 lb test though. sorry for the long reply I'm just really passionate about fishing the pads."

bassfishing,3ainf3,d6s,6,Sat Jun 20 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"I made it out there yesterday. Had an absolute blast.  The owner said as far as he knows that pond hasn't been fished in about 15 years and it showed.  I tried a few top waters, sproh frogs and some weightless horny toads and nothing, soon as I started punching all hell broke loose lol. I used a Alabama Craw Vilecraw, 3/8 tungsten(pegged) 50lb braid on my baitcaster.  In 2 hours I pulled about 12 nice fish. Even the wife got into it. Spooled up some braid on a spinning reel and she got about 4 in an hour.  Pretty nice size fish. Biggest was 7lbs 4 oz, smallest was 2lbs 6oz."
bassfishing,3ainf3,Nc772,3,Sun Jun 21 16:05:03 2015 UTC,"Punchbait. If the bass don't want to come up for a frog bait you need to get the bait down to them. Use a 4/0 g lock style hook a bullet weight somewhere around 3/8-1/2 ounce and a bobber stop in front of the weight to keep it against the hook. Basically a Texas rig where the weight cannot move away from the hook. Pair with a craw like creature or your favorite creature soft plastic lure and pitch it into and between the pads. Look for small openings in the pads and go for them first. Twice the bait a half dozen times on a slack line so it doesn't move but simply flutters in the same spot to entice a bite. Take your time and be thorough and hit as many spots as you can and if the bass are there it will pay off for you. When the suns high the bass are going to be a little lethargic and not wont to come up for a top water.  For more on this technic find YouTube videos on punching and flipping mats, pads and heavy cover."

bassfishing,3agoxh,generic_ahole,2,Sat Jun 20 02:56:01 2015 UTC,Depending on what you mean by tip. Is the top eyelet missing? Or did the blank break between the first and second eyelet?  The top eyelet is just glued on and any respectable bait shop can help you find and install a replacement in 10 minutes for about $5.  If the blank broke...  well...  the blank broke. and you can try and do the same. Or get a new rod.

I just hearing it chugging along and then it just gets smashed!   Seriously though, if you can catch them on a top water at night, it is the most intense way to catch a bass."

bassfishing,3aeizn,BayouBoogie,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:58:03 2015 UTC,"Jitterbug or big black worms. They will most likely move in shallow by vegetation or well lit docks and feed on blue gill. I love a black top water lure or if you go the spinnerbait style I would throw a black chatterbait instead. Get you a 13.5"" worm and you can have some fun around docks."
