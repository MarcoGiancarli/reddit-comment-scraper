The phrase 'became the skin of Numidium' isn't literal, but the Dwemer did undergo some sort of process (we shorthand it to soul stacking, but the actual metaphysics involved are unknown as far as I know) that involved them becoming inextricably linked with Numidium. However, the price was that the souls of individual Dwemer no longer exist. Only one is known to have survived, Yagrum Balgrum.  As to why they did it, based on their philosophy, it seems that they were either trying to remove themselves from the universe, or force the universe to behave as they wanted.

It retains all of its brilliant lore and great characters, but has modified some of its gameplay aspects to befit the MMO genre. It doesn't ""play"" the same as a regular Elder Scrolls game, but it certainly feels the same, in my opinion.   Also, while it is certainly an MMO game, there is a very strong PvE aspect to the game which makes it well-suited for solo adventures. Given that it is no longer subscription-required, I would recommend it for that alone."

ElderScrolls,3e0s3l,MightyDebo,3,Tue Jul 21 02:32:01 2015 UTC,"Zenimax is responsible for the MMO. As Todd said at E3, they work on the new game once the previous is finished. They're already working on TESVI."

ElderScrolls,3e0s3l,IAmTheCatOfCats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:59:10 2015 UTC,"See, while I agree on your predicted release date (2019, that is. 2020 is too long. It puts us in Half Life 3 territory.) I disagree with that logic.  If the logic is that they are ""holding it back"" so that ESO performs better, on what logic exactly do you feel ESO will be ""Performing better"" in 2020? How can it be a system of ""We're holding it back because ESO needs to be in a stronger position when we release it, so here is a concrete date we can release it on.""  If they are waiting on ESO to finish it's uphill battle, we aren't waiting until 2020. We're waiting indefinitely.   Which seems quite unlikely. Main title ES and FO games are the geese that shit money. They aren't going to seal that anus up because maybe ESO will be doing better at some point in the future.   As for ""taking away players"" that system collapses when subscription fees go out the door. Hell, it's barely a thing with subscription fees.  People are capable of playing more than one game and all that. What exactly is the logic here? ""Gee, I sure would love to have bought Oblivion, but I already play WoW.""   I mean, they put Fallout 4 out while ESO is trying to rebound with Tamriel Unlimited. What's the rationale, here? ES players only play ES and will never touch games that aren't ES, therefore they can only loose players to ESVI so FO4 won't take any players at all?   Then consider this. Suppose the game is done and ready to ship in... Oh. Let's say 2018. You figure they're just going to keep it in the vault and let it age 2 years because they don't want Not-Subscribers of ESO to buy it? Or is the attitude that they can predict when the time has come that they can release it without ESO being threatened, so ESVI will just conveniently be ready exactly when that happens? Or when ESO will begin to fade into obsolescence?   TL:DR I agree with your date, but not your logic behind it.  My guess? ESVI will come out when it is ready. My guess is that that's going to be early 2019 at the latest. 2018 if we're lucky."
ElderScrolls,3e0s3l,Rictal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:38 2015 UTC,"My logic isn't that it'll be performing better in 2020, It's that so long as there isn't a new Elder Scrolls game ESO will be performing better than if there wasn't a new Elder Scrolls game. I'm not saying they'll purposely delay the game, but they can definitely feel more freedom to take their time.  Of course people can play more than one game, but MMOs aren't like any old game. If we assume for instance that the next ES will be roughly the same length of FO4 (400 hours supposedly), that's long enough to take you out of an MMO for at least a few weeks. By the time you get back to the MMO the game can feel strange, new raid and dungeon content could be out and you could have fallen behind. Then you get fed up and just give up for on the game until you feel like you can come back in at the start of an expansion or whenever.  No, the game doesn't have to rely on subscriptions, it's a B2P after all. However the game does have to put some effort into retaining a playerbase that will buy from the ingame store. Micro-transactions are how games with a F2P model thrive.  As for Fallout, why does Blizzard release Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2 but not Warcraft 4. The answer lies in the fanbase for those series. Of course there is going to be more overlap between Warcraft and World of Warcraft than there is between Diablo 3 and Warcraft. Alot of players will enjoy both series. In Bethesda terms, ES and FO overlap in fans less than ES and ESO. Of course people are going to be pulled away by a new release by Bethesda, but I'm sure plenty of people were pulled away when the Witcher 3 came out. Just a theory though."

I'm not so sure of that. That would presume it was the darling of the fanbase, rather than a ""Meh. Could be okay, I guess.""  I think it is safe to say that a good chunk of the ES fanbase skipped over ESO and is still just waiting for ESVI. ESO is it's own creature, as is it's niche fanbase.   that's long enough to take you out of an MMO for at least a few weeks.   If you are the sort of person who obsessively compulsively plays a single game. I personally played the shit out of Guild Wars 1 and Oblivion simultaneously.  You've bought the game. They've made the money. I don't imagine they care if you shove the case up your ass and let it stew their for a few years, let alone how it impacts the rest of your video game playing habbits.    By the time you get back to the MMO the game can feel strange.   And? We expect them to seal up the anus of the goose that shits money so that the poor ESO fans (Whom I would argue are a minority of the fanbase) don't need to suffer the horrible state of an MMO feeling strange?  They are a business. Not a babysitter.    No, the game doesn't have to rely on subscriptions, it's a B2P after all. However the game does have to put some effort into retaining a playerbase that will buy from the ingame store.    Quick question. Which do you think would make Zenimax more money.  Whatever they are left making through micro-transactions in 2018, or a new ES title?  My guess is a New ES title.  This is why I question your logic. It seems to presume that Bethesda is going to go ""Fuck that big fish that literally shits money. Let's focus all of our attention on this wee little baby fish.""   As for Fallout, why does Blizzard release Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2 but not Warcraft 4. The answer lies in the fanbase for those series. Of course there is going to be more overlap between Warcraft and World of Warcraft than there is between Diablo 3 and Warcraft.   WoW is in a league of it's own.  See - Every Big Name MMO that proves to be lackluster and generally meh-ish being proclaimed the ""WoW Killer"" only to turn out to be generally meh.  I imagine they aren't making Warcraft 4 because WoW is still literally shitting money onto them.  ESO never possessed this power for Zenimax.  Main titles do.  So a more proper comparison would be suggesting that Blizzard was going to shut down the WoW servers for a few years (I.E. The Goose that shits money.) in order to create Warcraft 4 (I.E. ""Meh. That sounds cool, I guess."") because they want WoW players to ""Focus"" on Warcraft 4.  TL:DR I still agree with your date, but it's because that's more or less how long it's going to take to make the game. Not some asinine nonsense about bending over backwards to coddle the fraction of the greater ES fanbase that makes up ESO players."

That being said, I guess its safe to presume that we won't have any news until we're closer to launch (Bethesda's style) and that nothing will come next year, since I don't believe we'll hear official statements about TES VI until Fallout fulfills its DLCs cycle."

Beyond 2019 and we are topping the Half Life 3 wait.   People do realize just how long a 2019+ wait will make it, right?   Frankly, my guess is a 2018 announcement, early 2019 release. Or, if they operate on a system more like what they are doing with FO4, Early/Mid 2018 announcement, late 2019 release."
ElderScrolls,3e0s3l,boostedb1mmer,0,Tue Jul 21 21:31:06 2015 UTC,my guess would be announced in 2017 or 2018 mid year with a pre-holiday launch if they keep up with recent patterns.  definately wont be announced next year though that would be too soon after fo4 and would divide attention too much and while yes people can play more than 1 game at a time i dont think the majority of the playerbase would be playing 2 large scale rpg titles potentially at the same time.
ElderScrolls,3e0s3l,boostedb1mmer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:09 2015 UTC,My guess is November/December of 2016 with announcement at that years E3. Why? Fallout 4. It's no secret that TES and FP piggyback HEAVILY off of each other and are usually developed along side each other. FO4 this November and TES next Christmas season.

Dwemer in their former glory, Chimer still around, the Tribunal rising and suddenly all those events which turned Tamriel into what we know and love.   On the other hand, the dwemer mystery is something I believe should stay untouched. It's one of those things that should never be explained...   In a game like this, I would rather be a passerby, an observer not the hero. In a nutshell, I doubt we'll ever see such a game, but whatever... It's something nice to imagine."
ElderScrolls,3dybwt,vinniesp,6,Mon Jul 20 17:07:10 2015 UTC,"This has been brought up in every ""TES VI"" thread, and I feel like the topic has been exhausted at this point. The Dwemer have always been a mysterious race who dissapeared and left all their treasures behind in all the Elder Scrolls games (Or at least since Mrorrowind, I haven't yet played Arena and Daggerfall). Why would they choose to solve that mystery now? If you take away the mystery behind the Dwemer you take away what makes them special. It would ruin them and they would no longer be able to use them in the same way in future Elder Scrolls instalments."
ElderScrolls,3dybwt,ON3i11,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:37:22 2015 UTC,Doubt it. It would be based on the Thalmor vs Imperials. Set in Valenwood/Elsywere/Summeret Isle.
ElderScrolls,3dybwt,ForIAmTalon,9,Mon Jul 20 15:31:57 2015 UTC,"That's a shallow interpretation. The old ""I bet ESVI is going to be about me and the faction I chose in the civil war  popping the evil Thalmors in the face."" It is a more subtle way of expecting the next installment to be ""Elder Scrolls VI - Skyrim 2""  My guess is that it's going to be about what it's always about. A lovecraftian monster who wants to destroy the world rising from the depths of time and space and you are the chosen one hero who can stop them.  The squabbles of mortals (You know. Imperial/Stormcloak vs. Thalmor) are typically relegated to ""Silly earthly concerns that must be put aside to stop the Lovecraftian Horror."" in ES games.  I highly doubt they are going to make that the focus of a game just because Civil War fans really want it.  It just seems lame.  The Nerevarine foretold by Azura in the days when the Gods of Tribunal were merely wo/men comes. Many fall but one remains. Stop Dagoth Ur from completing Akulakhan and creating his mad vision of Tamriel.  The Hero, foretold by Uriel's dream, the agent of Akatosh, sent at the closing days of the Third Era, when the Dragon Fires go dark, to prevent a Daedric conspiracy contemporary to Tiber Septim, from allowing Dagon to enter the world of Mortals and make it his own.  The Last Dragonborn, foretold by Alduin's Wall, comes when the Towers have all fallen and Alduin returns to devour the world and trigger another cycle of creation, to prevent this from occuring.  THE IMPERIALS BEAT UP THE STUPID THALMOR.  No offense, but IMO, this idea for ESVI (I see it all over the place) is just to Skyrim what ""I bet ESV is going to be about you being the even more secret illegitimate child of Uriel Septim who reunites the Empire and becomes the Emperor!"""
ElderScrolls,3dybwt,ThalmorInquisitor,2,Mon Jul 20 15:36:20 2015 UTC,"Much as I love the Thalmor because of their robes and evil, I agree, the next game is unlikely to be about them, although it will reference what happens of their plans, most likely."

The one reference from which I now see all this ""skin"" talk comes from is from the Skeleton Man's Interviews which is an out-of-game developer text. As the developers have already stated, the canonicity of such statements is not always on-level. But even if we take the interviews as being of the same canonicity as in-game books, the statement in question comes from Xal, Maruhkati. The Maruhkati are - to put it bluntly - insane fanatics. As well they weren't present for the creation of the Numidium. They don't know what happened. They are just a bunch of fanatics who - like a group of insane religious fanatics - assert their beliefs with an utmost and unwavering confidence that hides an utter lack of supporting evidence.   But EVEN IF we take Xal's word as true, the Marukhati speak metaphorically. It's not clear what was meant by ""sacrificed so many of their golden souls to create Anumidum's metal body."" Some people conclude Kagrenac transformed the Dwemer souls into the metal body. However it is equally possible he only sacrificed some of the Dwemer people into the body. Or that they were Dwemer who died during the construction of the Numidium. Or that they were the Dwemer warriors who protected the Numidium during the Second Battle of Red Mountain.    But EVEN IF we take all that for granted, the Dwemer did not become Numidium's ""skin."" They became his body."

We don't ""know"" anything for sure, their disappearance remains one of the greatest mysteries of nirn. We know they were tampering with the heart of lorkhan, as well as at least 1 elder scroll, inventing a Lexicon to decipher it.   There is no information to suggest that it was solely the heart of lorkhan that caused every single dwarf in existence to vanish. We know it was sudden because the falmer went to war with the dwemmer only to find empty suits of armour, and if it was the heart of lorkhan that took their souls, then there would at least be bodies left behind.

I think that there's some potential there for a great story and conflict.  5) ""Better AI."" I feel like the AI is pretty good already but there's always room for improvement. I think Bethesda has this field covered, especially with more processing power offered by the newest consoles.  6) ""Don't become leader of everything.""

I might actually want to wear something other than armor for a change.  Meaningful quests with recognized accomplishments. Include options for completion in a Dishonored sort of way: each choice has a unique set of moral consequence including global environmental changes according to gameplay style. A true economy and the opportunity to build and invest. Buying, selling, land lording properties or even running a functional farm or mill for example. Meaningful relationships between followers and spouses. Make marriage an option for any NPC (excluding what may interfere with questlines). Adopt and train any animal or creature.

Thus, it will be set in either the Summorset Isles, Elsewyr, or Valenwood- or maybe (hopefully) all of the above."
ElderScrolls,3dt6uc,AtriusII,3,Sun Jul 19 17:34:33 2015 UTC,"I would really enjoy dynamic quests. If they did this with the mainish story lines it would make it much more fun when you go through your quest dialog picking what you will say and how it will effect you later on.  I dont think they should delv into new races just yet(although they could do that with the variety of the Bosmer and Khajits) because I really hope the next game will address the building tension between the empire countries and the Thalmor. If they decide to make the result of built-up tension just a historical event in the next game then they should take this game to introduce new races from different continents. I think jumping into races without first letting us get familiar with them would be wrong. Well, not wrong but it wouldn't sit well with me.  Another thing I would want is better economy over all. I would love to play as a merchant but their vanilla systems are really bad. We have mods for this now but they take a long time to address this well enough for it to make a real difference. Besides that, everything you said would cover most of my wishes for the next game. I will think of more but mods are seriously screwing with my thoughts right now.  Edit: Jeezus I missed a ton of mistakes!  Edit2: They can also make combat a bit more Dark Soul like. Not with all the rolling but more to do with the weapons themselves. Make the weapon weight matter. Combine that with the option to dual-wield or wield two handed weapons with a single hand and they could make it much more fun to fight especially after you master that weapon class where your proficiency improves. They could make this work quite easily but I dont know if they would really want that in this type of series."

ElderScrolls,3dt6uc,InsaneKangaroo,0,Mon Jul 20 00:36:50 2015 UTC,"1) Location: I think it would be cool to have it in another place other that is not in Tamriel, Like Atmora (Where the Nords came from) or Akivir. 2) Main Story: Have no idea, but it should have cause and effect like the Witcher. For Instance If i kill a farmer then the whole town might say things like "" I miss ...."" 3) Combat System: Needs improvements like different strikes when you learn something in the skill tree, example the uppercut with two-handed from ESO. 4) New Races: Going back to the Akivir idea you can have tha Tang Mo or the Ice Demon things. If not being able to play as the Chimer or other ancient races would be cool. 5) Character Depth: Making different jobs cooler. Like a blacksmith might have a miner go to him every once in a while so they can restock. Make them have feelings like if your steal a necklace from a jeweler then either have them charge double the price or not sell anything to you for a while for what you did. Have families have rivalries like have one family steal the others cow or have one family burn ones house down.  6) Quests: Having more choices like having an assination to do and you have to choose between two people. Example, if i killed the leader of the Companions then all of the Companions would go into hiding, but if if choose to kill the leader of the Dark Brotherhood then the Companions would go out and offer their services to keep the cities safe. 7) Having them do reasonable things would be good like having them go under shelter when its raining. Simple things like that would make the game more interesting.  Character Customization: I like ESO about how you can have different visuals for the Armour and hoe you your changed the material you made it stronger. I thought that was a good idea because it allowed you to have some cool armour sets. (the xivkyn armour looks fully sick) Other then that being able to add little things to your armour such as a potion belt."

If you are below level 5(?), you are flat out told by your CO to join a guild and get some training before you start working for him. He even gives you a fist full of coins to buy your first few levels of weapon training.  It really can't be that hard to understand, and I've given this talk before. Your chance to hit is based on the difference between your skill with the weapon you're using, and your opponent's block skill + their skill with whatever type of armor they're wearing on the rough area you're trying to hit. Just like real life.  If any of you were to just pick up a broadsword and start swinging at someone who's been properly trained in melee combat, and trained how to dodge, maneuver, and properly deflect blows in whatever they're wearing, you won't put a scratch on them. They may parry a few times out of pity, but that's about it. So too in the game.  TLDR;    Acquire money, find trainer, train primary weapon skill to level 35 - 40. You'll hit enough to breeze through the first dungeon.  Don't whine about how missing your ""perfectly aimed attacks"" breaks immersion, it's just your opponent dodging your sloppy novice flailing."
ElderScrolls,3dt05j,LynxOfTheWastes,8,Sun Jul 19 09:08:38 2015 UTC,"The whole sneaky bow character thing isn't really there in morrowind.   Combat really isn't bad though.

ElderScrolls,3dt05j,ducksaws,4,Sun Jul 19 06:22:52 2015 UTC,"But it is though. My Bosmer archer was a force to be reckoned with straight off of the boat. Coupled with Steed this was probably my least frustrating low-level character in 10+ years of playing Morrowind.    I've pretty much done everything I've ever wanted to do in Morrowind and wanted to play a new game for nostalgic reasons, but after years of playing Oblivion and Skyrim, didn't want to deal with a lot of missed attacks or slow walk speed until I could level up a few times or exploit magic items.    With attribute, class, sign, and skill abonuses, a Bosmer Archer definitely does the trick.    It's a good build for those new to Morrowind or new to old-school CRPGs.    For those of us who discovered Morrowind back in the day, your low-level character missing attack rolls and getting clobbered was pretty much a standard and expected part of the CRPG experience.    For those who are new to dice roll CRPGs, I'm sure it's a odd and confusing experience. Personally, I find Morrowind to be a great bridge between CRPGs like Baldur's Gate and Fallout and the newer FPS-RPG games like Oblivion, FO3, and Skyrim.    But yeah. A sneaky Bosmer archer is a great build for those playing the TES series backwards in time."
ElderScrolls,3dt05j,shiftplusone,-11,Sun Jul 19 14:58:04 2015 UTC,"It's kinda hard to deal with being a weakling when the first questline is, essentially, ""join a guild, kill people."" If you ask me, that's lazy game design. Insane difficulty does not make a good game."
ElderScrolls,3dt05j,MyrMindservant,9,Sun Jul 19 07:36:42 2015 UTC,"First questline? It is not first or necessary in any way. You are told to get familiar with the world, level up a bit, do some job for locals, etc. You don't have to join any guilds, much less kill any people.  You can simply explore the world, travel to other cities and do any quests you want. Besides Fighters Guild, which I assume you were talking about, there are many other factions to join: Mages Guild, Thieves Guild, Imperial Legion, Imperial Cult, Tribunal Temple, Great Houses, etc. And there is a good amount of quests that you can get from random people, rather than factions. Quests in some other factions, like Mages Guild or Thieves Guild, involve much less fighting/killing than the ones you get in Fighters Guild.  Also, there is no ""insane difficulty"" in Morrowind. In fact, the game is not difficult at all. It just has some learning curve, you have to get familiar with the way things work and use your brain.  Chance to hit primarily depends on your skill level with the weapon you are using and fatigue. You should try to only use weapons your character is skilled with. If you selected any weapon types as your major skills during the character creation, then use those. Otherwise you can pay for training, or use magic, or even make a new better character. In the last case you can also pick the Warrior birthsign, which increases your chance to hit.  You can check this introductory comment for some other information useful to new players.  On a side note, Accurate Attack is a ""cheat mod"", and a rather poorly made one too. It makes all weapon skills pointless, as well as multiple magic effects. You said that you didn't want to cheat, so you can consider yourself lucky that it didn't work. I would advice you to remove it, if only to avoid possible glitches. Then you can either play normally or restart the game with a better made character. Btw, if you want to be a Marksman, then that fine, but it shouldn't be your only way to deal with enemies. Get some other weapon skill for close range fights, or Destruction for some offensive magic."
ElderScrolls,3dt05j,kaiden333,3,Sun Jul 19 09:27:02 2015 UTC,"Keep your fatigue up (full if you can) when you attack. It affects accuracy.  Use a weapon which you have a major skill in, and if you can summon a weapon. Summoned weapons give you a bonus in their skill. Be willing to train your bow skill with trainers.

ElderScrolls,3dpxp4,awesomeness243,34,Sat Jul 18 08:28:33 2015 UTC,"I'll simplify it a bit, to make it eaeier to understand.    First things first, it's not an acronym. It's ""Royalty"" in the Ehlnofey language, which has no lowercase.  Think of it as enlightenment. You realize your place in the universe. In the TES universe, everything is the concoction of a godhead (essentially the ""dream"" of an entity).  You realize that you are a part of the dream, that everything is the exact same as you, that all are you and you are all.   Now, most people who try to achieve CHIM do something called ""zero sum."" Once they realize they are a part of the ""dream"", they no longer feel they have an identity and they just disappear retroactively (this means throughout all time; past, present, and future).   Only 2 people have managed to not zero-sum: Vivec and Talos. The way they do this is by still keeping the idea that they are an individual. Think of it like this: when someone zero sums, their thought process is I AM (+1) and I AM NOT (-1). The numbers combined result in 0, so they cease to exist. However, if you retain your idea of self, you essentially exert your will as say that +1 and -1 must make 1. Your ability to realize you are part of the ""dream"", yet keeping your idea of self, gives you a shit ton of power. Think of it like lucid dreaming.   However, this power is limited by one factor: Love. In order for it to work, you must have altruistic selfishness (because you love yourself, but you are part of everything and everything is a part of you).    Alright, that's the basics for CHIM, but there's another concept that accompanies it. This concept is called Amaranth. This is when a person who achieved CHIM (Only mortals can, FYI)  ""dreams"" a new ""dream"". AFAIK, there is no Amaranth in the current ""dream."" It is unknown if TES takes place in the original ""dream"", or who the original ""dreamer"" the TES ""dream"" is. Some people think it's Anu, some think someone we don't know about, or he'll, it could even be Nazeem.  I know these concepts can be very offputting, but don't worry, you grow used to it and you come to love it. I can answer some more questions to the best of my (limited) knowledge."

ElderScrolls,3dpxp4,MightyDebo,5,Sat Jul 18 14:57:21 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it is a true thing. I'm not super into Elder Scrolls anymore, but there were in-game books that mentioned CHIM, especially (iirc, in a roundabout and metaphoric way) the 36 Lessons of Vivec."
ElderScrolls,3dpxp4,Putnam3145,3,Sat Jul 18 17:28:51 2015 UTC,"Some books that imply/mention it are the 36 Lessons of Vivec. Warning, these are one hell of a read and you're not supposed to understand it through and through. Another series of books that mention it are Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes.   Also, Heimskr mentions it, as he quoted Talos.   ""I breathe now, in royalty, and reshape this land which is mine. I do this for you, Red Legions, for I love you.""   Aye, love. Love! Even as man, great Talos cherished us   Notice how it said royalty? Ehlnofex for royalty is CHIM."
ElderScrolls,3dpxp4,Latenius,3,Sat Jul 18 20:05:22 2015 UTC,"36 lessons of vivec, sermon 12:   'I told you,' Vivec said, 'I am meant to be the teacher of the king of the earth. AE ALTADOON GHARTOK PADHOME.' With these magic words, the King of Rape added another: 'CHIM,' which is the secret syllable of royalty.   Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes, book 3:   CHIM. Those who know it can reshape the land. Witness the home of the Red King Once Jungled.   From the Many Headed Talos (not in Skyrim, but quoted in it):   ""And after the throne of Alinor did finally break at the feet of Men, and news of it came to the Dragon Emperor in Cyrodiil, he gathered his captains and spoke to them, saying:  ""'You have suffered for me to win this throne, and I see how you hate jungle. Let me show you the power of Talos Stormcrown, born of the North, where my breath is long winter. I breathe now, in royalty, and reshape this land which is mine. I do this for you, Red Legions, for I love you.'""   Black Books 1: Waking Dreams   The eyes, once bleached by falling stars of utmost revelation, will forever see the faint insight drawn by the overwhelming question, as only the True Enquiry shapes the edge of thought. The rest is vulgar fiction, attempts to impose order on the consensus mantlings of an uncaring godhead. First,   And then Online has a quest known as The Waking Dreamer, which gives an award called ""Discourse Amaranthine"".  The concept of CHIM is also closely tied with the concept of the Wheel and somewhat tied with the Towers. The Book of the Dragonborn:   When misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world When the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped When the thrice-blessed fail and the Red Tower trembles When the Dragonborn Ruler loses his throne, and the White Tower falls When the Snow Tower lies sundered, kingless, bleeding The World-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Dragonborn."

It's kind of ridiculous how apparently all of the previous TES games' events culminated in ""The World-Eater waking"" which in actuality, in Skyrim, was really lame. All of the games before had a much more epic feel to them."
ElderScrolls,3dpxp4,Rosario_Di_Spada,2,Sun Jul 19 01:45:57 2015 UTC,"Not quite. The prophecy is not complete- the Snow tower is not destroyed (the keystone has not been removed) The Thalmor are trying to destroy mundus so that all mer-kind can go back to being eternal spirits (something like that). And as in skyrim, you destroy Alduin but don't take his soul (which is the only way to kill a dragon permanently) so it is quite possible that you are not actually the last dragonborn and that Alduin will come back and fuck shit up with his final form"

ElderScrolls,3dliv3,Dracugo,3,Sat Jul 18 16:40:21 2015 UTC,"Well it was called ""Arena"" because it was originally a game where you went around battling people in an Arena.

Numidium was involved in Tiber Septim's attack on Alinor and became trapped in a time warp.

Numidium (And thus the Dwarves) will reappear and proceed to fuck shit up all over Tamriel and continue it's war against the forces ot the Third Aldmeri Dominion (The Thalmor you know). It is going to erase the Altmer from existence. A group of Dunmer and Khajiit are going to try to escape in a boat and when Numidium tries to attack them the mother fucking Nerevarine will reappear piloting mother fucking Akulakhan and fight it.  The Dunmer and Khajiit escape to the god damned moons and settle there, but the Nerevarine is unable to beat Numidium and it follows them there. Herein a Dunmer named Jubal Lun-Sul will stop Landfall by creating ""New Men"" with Vivec (Who presumably reappears having vanished like a god damned boss at the Trial of Vivec)  TL:DR - The Dwarves are coming back. There are no breaks on the Landfall train. The only way to escape Landfall is by ""Knowing Love"" and CHIMing the fuck out."

ElderScrolls,3ddlqe,TESnewbie,4,Wed Jul 15 13:09:17 2015 UTC,"I'd really skip over I and II, simply because they're so old and clunky and the information they provide in the lore isn't substantial.  That said, start with III, play it to your heart's content. It may feel a bit clunky, but if you play an easymode character, you'll be fine. Morrowind's appeal comes from its atmosphere and story, not it's combat.  Then play IV, and depending on how much you loved III, be a little disappointed. Oblivion is considered the worst of the main 3 games, but it is by no means bad.  Then play V, the all famous one. Its a good game and adds some great lore on ancient Nord history. There's a reason it got so popular.  Think of all the funding TESV brought Bethesda, and think of how good it'll make TESVI."
ElderScrolls,3ddlqe,MightyDebo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:12:30 2015 UTC,I'm with Mighty on this one. Skip over Arena and Daggerfall. Maybe you will love them or it could turn you away and keep you only playing Skyrim. They really are very dated.  I would say make sure you mod Morrowind. MGSO is a must for me and I heavily recommend it to you. There are a lot of bugs it fixes and makes the world much prettier. Playing Morrowind straight up vanilla really shows the age of it.

It was rectified in the lore, though. Tiber Septim and his troops were having trouble with the Cyrodiilic jungle, so out of his love for his soldiers he CHIM'ed it away."
ElderScrolls,3ddlqe,MightyDebo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:17:20 2015 UTC,I heard the real reason was that they wanted to piggyback off of the popularity of the Lord of the Rings films which were still new at the time and in order to do that they changed Cyrodiil from a jungle to a temperate forest.

ElderScrolls,3ddlqe,popeisdope,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"Know that you'll want to change the controls of Arena and Daggerfall. The way to control the first two games is by moving the cursor to the sides and top/bottom of the screen for movement. Very confusing IMO. In daggerfall, the setting is something like a ""view player"" checkbox. It locks the cursor/reticle/crosshairs to the centre of the screen and makes the mouse control look movement."

But Elder Scrolls has every combination of male and female with each race. Granted they usually have one VA for each gendered race, but that's still tacking on a ton mor work for each type of character."
ElderScrolls,3d594t,MagicScotsman,17,Mon Jul 13 17:37:00 2015 UTC,I think having a voice in Bethesda games will ruin the atmosphere of having a truly unique character.No matter how different your male character looks compared to my male character we will have the same voice
ElderScrolls,3d594t,SirDerpsAlot23,11,Mon Jul 13 17:08:47 2015 UTC,"Saints Row IV has 3 female voices and 4 male voices, with the option to vary the pitch from very high to very low. The in-game dialogue varies with each voice, including cutscenes and story content. That would be a much more monumental task for an Elder Scrolls game, but it would be pretty impressive if they pulled it off. At least the upside would be that we could finally have a proper Bard class.  Edit: They could also work some kind of option in where you voice your own character, and just have the game respond to a robust selection of voice commands. They've already laid some groundwork in this direction with the Kinect voice commands for Shouts in Skyrim."

ElderScrolls,3d594t,EonBlueAegis,5,Mon Jul 13 17:25:37 2015 UTC,"i think bethesda wants to make a stark differentiation between fallout and elder scrolls, and voice acting in fallout was part of that."
ElderScrolls,3d594t,gargamak,7,Mon Jul 13 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"Fallout is more about telling a story to the player, even if the story has different branching off points based on player decisions.   The Elder Scrolls is more about the player creating their own story based on the setting of the game world.  So a voice acted player character could only really make sense in a TES game if there were a plethora of voice options to chose from, including none/mute.  That's my take, anyway."

You only get what we get in the real world - conflicting stories, biased accounts, history made by the winners. It makes the world seem real, rather than all accounts of history being there for irrefutable exposition.  What appeals to me most, though, is how on the surface it seems fairly tame and almost generic, but once you start digging deeper into the lore you find that almost nothing is the same as the real world, and Nirn follows a different set of rules entirely, and all of those obscure points of lore paint Nirn as somewhere completely alien, like the heavenly bodies, planes of Oblivion, the stars and sun and the sky in general and CHIM. It has its own metaphysics but you have to be willing to look for them, and I think that's great."

Connection with nature, lots of hunting, subjugation under the foot of others, stuff that my ancestors were involved with. But it's the way that it all went about, the why and how of it, that interested me beyond a simple reskin of my ancestors. I've always played archers/alchemists in games, so the background of a Bosmer with a mother from the homeland and an Imperial father made sense to me. So, while I would never harm the flora of the homeland, I would most certainly use the resources in other nations, more out of honoring my mother than actually believing in the Pact."

Even if you don't really want to craft, you should start researching traits right away. In blacksmithing, clothier, and woodworking, you can add traits to your armor and weapons but only if you have ""researched"" that specific trait for that specific type of armor or weapon. The more traits you have researched for an item, the longer it will take to research the next trait. Traits are important for set crafting. As you will find out, sets give extra bonuses. You can't craft sets just anywhere, though. Each set crafting station has it's own unique location and you need to know a certain amount of traits on an item to craft a set piece.   TLDR: research traits from day 1"

ElderScrolls,3cyz7i,Moonburn,7,Sun Jul 12 03:12:12 2015 UTC,"Depends on your defintion of RPG. Furthermore ESO is an MMO, like WoW. I seriously doubt you'll enjoy it. Even as far as TES games are concerned, Skyrim is an outlier. Some people believe Skyrim has gone too far from the ""roots"" of the RPG genre, and most older TES fans still prefer Morrowind. Arguably Morrowind had its own ""problems,"" but Skyrim is viewed by some as a bastardization of the genre. One that went too far to appeal to the masses, which it did a great job at, but strayed too far from classic TES games.   Also, the term RPG is fairly vague in nature. Pokemon is essentially an RPG. So are games like Planetside 2. There are even people who would argue that Skyrim isn't an RPG at all, and that games like Final Fantasy are the only true RPGs. It varies person to person. You've likely played other games people would describe as an RPG,  but those elements were hidden behind other layers of gameplay."

I may have considered it to be a very light RPG when it first launched, but it has strayed too far from its roots over the years. You may still get people who do proper RP on some of the RP servers, but the game no longer explicitly supports that style of play."

ElderScrolls,3cxfd4,aschesklave,14,Sat Jul 11 17:11:10 2015 UTC,"Shivering Isles is probably the single greatest DLC in any Elder Scrolls game. It's pretty awesome. The most visually interesting of any of the landmass DLCs, plenty of good quest lines, characters, items, new dungeons, all the goodness you hope for in a DLC.   It's the only DLC in any of the Elder Scrolls games that I'd consider a must-play ( I think that's pretty high praise considering I think Oblivion is the weakest of the recent 3 TES games). Tribunal was cool, Dragonborn was as well, but Shivering Isles pretty much set the bar for what I expect from an Elder Scrolls expansion."
ElderScrolls,3cxfd4,noplzstop,3,Sat Jul 11 17:16:38 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind me asking, what were Tribunal and Bloodmoon like as well?"
ElderScrolls,3cxfd4,noplzstop,7,Sat Jul 11 17:21:31 2015 UTC,"Tribunal was basically the final chapter of the main story of Morrowind, regarding the Tribunal of Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec (the three god-kings of the Dunmer temple, just play Morrowind if you haven't because it's hard to explain and it's no fun spoiling it :P), and it takes place in the capitol city of Morrowind, Almalexia.   It basically just adds one huge huge city, some high-level quests and items, and some merchants with a ton of money, and it's meant to be played after you finish the main quest. Story-wise, it's a great way to end Morrowind, but I've always preferred the DLC that adds more substantial landmasses. I'd almost say it's a must-play, definitely is if you're into the story of Morrowind, but aside from the questlines and new city there's not a whole ton of other content.   Bloodmoon does add a landmass, the island of Solstheim (which you may remember if you've played Skyrim's Dragonborn DLC), but before Red Mountain erupted so it's basically just a snowy tundra. Some good quests, there's a city you help build in steps as part of one questline, some cool high-level items and magic, but I didn't find the story as compelling as Tribunal and the world wasn't as visually interesting as the rest of the game, being a pretty standard snowy environment like Skyrim's but less detailed.   Both of them are worth playing, and they're worth having for Morrowind at least in part because some awesome mods like Tamriel Rebuilt that depend on some of the assets they add, but they're not as good as Shivering Isles is."

ElderScrolls,3cscek,Calypse27,7,Fri Jul 10 14:29:42 2015 UTC,"Once I had put 250+ hours into Skyrim, and was just bored looking for new stuff to do, I went into my house in Solitude. Proceeded to take the bowl that was on the table and drop all my gems (ruby, emerald, topaz, diamond) into it one by one. There were hundreds of them, it made my Xbox really hot and the gems were glitching through the bowl and flying around the room by the end.  Also, in that great hall in Whiterun I used to take baskets and cauldrons and place them on people's heads and watch them walk around. It was hilarious.

For example: if 75% of all players are hoarders and 25% admit it then 2/3 of the haorders are liars.   Also supposed to reference the porn/masturbation survey joke."

ElderScrolls,3ctaci,Remigus,8,Fri Jul 10 16:28:14 2015 UTC,"The Dwemer already developed explosives.  You actually use them during a quest in Tribunal to blast away some rubble in a Dwemer ruin.  As far as guns being introduced, I don't think it would make sense lore-wise or in terms of preserving the feel of The Elder Scrolls games to have modern people start trying to manufacture guns, especially when people can already shoot fireballs and lightning from their hands, as has been mentioned.  That being said, if a game happened to include a prototype Dwemer firearm as an incomprehensible, artifact-like unique weapon, I would totally be down for that.  The Dwemer's preference for technology over magic, established use of explosives, and tendency to tinker with developing new and unexpected things would make such a weapon perfectly appropriate to me.  And if there is a humorous scene where some mages study it only to remain unimpressed by its capabilities and decide that attempting to replicate it is a waste of time, I would also be super amused.  EDIT: It would also be cool if the capabilities of the Dwemer firearm were similar to those of early real-world firearms.  Maybe it would reload slowly and do significant damage but not enough to put it on par with the strongest bows DPS-wise, but it would have the unique effect of increased armor penetration.  This would make it excellent for defeating heavy armor with an initial volley, allowing it to fill a unique role from bows without replacing them as the primary ranged weapon against the majority of opponents who aren't covered head-to-toe in ebony."
ElderScrolls,3ctaci,PowerStacheOfTheYear,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:12:05 2015 UTC,"I like your thoughts on the subject. Though given the application for leveling the playing field between mages and nonmagical infantry, I think the Empire would be quick to adopt the dwemer tech in a support role. I'd imagine they either find a large cache of them, or manufacturing them is simple so slow and complicated that they can't get many of them out."
ElderScrolls,3ctaci,PowerStacheOfTheYear,3,Fri Jul 10 18:02:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't figure they would think it was completely worthless to replicate, I just think that replicating Dwemer technology would take so much effort that it ultimately wouldn't be worth the overwhelming effort.  After all, the Dwemer weren't just smarter or more advanced than the other races, they actually focused their research down entirely different avenues of study than the other races, so replicating their discoveries would basically mean reinventing the wheel."
ElderScrolls,3ctaci,PowerStacheOfTheYear,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:35:23 2015 UTC,"If they had their backs up against the wall vs the Thalmor, I think it's possible they'd pull out all the stops."
ElderScrolls,3ctaci,Pedestrian101_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:57:05 2015 UTC,"I just think there are easier ways they could go.  People have developed a rudimentary understanding of steam animunculi and learned how to control them in certain situation.  Building on that knowledge to gain an army of Dwemer automatons would likely be easier than exploring entirely new areas of engineering, and it would probably be more effective too.  Not to mention that necromancy is a proven art and pretty much the ultimate last resort for anyone willing to go that far."
ElderScrolls,3ctaci,Pedestrian101_,5,Sat Jul 11 01:11:43 2015 UTC,"I believe it goes that the use of Magic and it's availability to almost all citizens of Tamriel, caused a technological stale-mate. Meaning there is no need for technological advancement and therefore there isn't any, maybe if the Dwemer were still around they'd continue to shun the gods and further develop technology and create gunpowder or a magic alternative maybe. Also, I don't believe lore ever mentions the use or the existence of gunpowder or cannons."
ElderScrolls,3ctaci,eMeLDi,2,Fri Jul 10 16:46:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think magic is quite as ubiquitous to the regular person as you think. Otherwise I'd imagine there would be many more mages, and magic wouldn't be looked at by the average person as this arcane, barely understandable thing. Plus the Thalmor being noted for having an exceptionally large number of mages."
ElderScrolls,3ctaci,eMeLDi,2,Fri Jul 10 18:07:00 2015 UTC,"That's sort of what I mean, the Thalmor - and by extension the Aldmeri Dominion - have huge numbers of Mages and thus in their society, technological advancement is nil. Maybe Magic isn't available to everyone in Tamriel but but just by it existing means developing and researching certain technologies is just pointless and not necessary."
ElderScrolls,3ctaci,Rosario_Di_Spada,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"It's nessesary to the people outside of the Thalmor who otherwise have very little magical influence in their day to day lives. Tech may stagnate in the Dominion because they don't need it, but other societies in which magic isn't an integral part may look for new solutions. The heavy focus on the study of Dwemer technology already gestures toward a desire to come up with practical, nonmagical solutions to problems."
ElderScrolls,3ctaci,ThalmorInquisitor,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:13:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on the era. In the Third Era, Magic was widely available to citizens of the Empire through the Mages Guild. That was their whole conflict with the Telvanni in Morrowind. Telvanni viewed Magic internally believing it was the private realm of a Wizard Elite whereas the Mages Guild believed it should be freely accessible.  The Schism in the Mages Guild put an end to this attitude and magical study became more about politics and wooing the Emperor, as I understand it.  As for numbers of mages, I view it as being sort of like Science. Not everybody has the brain/mental discipline/resources to properly learn lots of Scientific shit.   Likewise, not everybody has the mental capacity or the resources to learn Magic. This doesn't mean it isn't widely available.    , and magic wouldn't be looked at by the average person as this arcane, barely understandable thing.    Continuing with the Science parallel...  Look at how average joe shmoe treats scientific concepts like Global Warming. FFS. Every year some people declare that it can't be real because Winter happens.  As for Gunpowder, I believe the implication is that it exists in the world, it's just not heavily used because magic is deemed more effective. Gunpowder can hurl a canon ball at a wall. A mage can use a levitation charm to fly your soldiers over a wall. (Levitation Magic is still implied to exist in game, it's just not as widely available. It's used in the defense of the Imperial City, to fly a bunch of Legionnaires at Umbriel in Lord of Souls)  As for guns themselves... As I understand it, in history, many people viewed bows and crossbows as more effective than early guns due to better accuracy."
ElderScrolls,3ctaci,eMeLDi,3,Sun Jul 12 17:39:12 2015 UTC,There is a rifle mod for Skyrim that I absolutely love.  I played an Orcish smith who invented rifles based on some old Dwemer schematics.   He ran around the countryside subduing the wilds with the only boomstick in the world.  Very fun.

The Empire during Skyrim is composed of only Cyrodil, Skyrim (which is warring to separate), and parts of High Rock and Hammerfell (Hammerfell officially not a part of the Empire due to a treaty the Empire made with the Aldmeri Dominion). Morrowind, what parts of Black Marsh were Imperial, Elsweyr, the elven provinces, and most of hammerfell and High Rock have all left the Empire by 4E due to the war between the EMpire and Aldmeri Dominion. On top of that, regardless of the actions the player takes, the Empire will be without an Emperor and a clear successor by the end of Skyrim, as well as either down a province, or in the process of trying to put down what little resistance remains (both of which are extremely expensive and taxing on an already weak empire).

ElderScrolls,3cn8o6,Strawberrycocoa,4,Thu Jul 9 19:06:15 2015 UTC,"I theorized about the possible akaviri invasion in TES6 for quite some time. Tamriel is torn by war and both sides are weak. Sounds to me like a perfect oportunity for another invasion. Wouldn't be the first time.  That would also give a chance to implement story about a Nerevarine who is said to be in Akavir. Maybe as a side quest or dlc. Maybe he became mad akaviri king worshipped by locals or secluded mystic.  This invasion would almost certainly happen in the east and south. Chance to revisit Morrowind, Skyrim, perhaps even Cyrdiil and Argonia. Maybe I'm goung too far now."

ElderScrolls,3cn8o6,srini10000,2,Thu Jul 9 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"It could be that after the civil war, the Dominion decides to take their chance and attack, and maybe while they do that...The Akaviri invade...causing the dominion to cease their attack to deal with the Akaviri crisis.

ElderScrolls,3cn8o6,RazielandKain,2,Fri Jul 10 17:25:42 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for either Elsweyr or Black Marsh or maybe both because of the lack of content we've had for the Khajiit and Argonians.

So I disabled it with mods and or just didn't use it at all in Oblivion and Skyrim. I enjoy running back and forth for quests even if it's to the other side of the map. It gives me a  chance to level up my character as I mostly play with hardcore / survivalist orientated mods where level progression is really slow.   On my current Oblivion build I am 5 hours in using Fcom convergence as my gameplay overhaul, and I am only level 2.  Back on topic, what I have done in both Oblivion and Skyrim though is add ""immersive"" traveling mods, like mages guild teleportation to other cities in Oblivion without being from the mages guild, and Carriages in major towns for Skyrim."

Think about it like, if someone was doing a survey on gamers and violent tendencies, and a lot of people are defensive about the topic.

ElderScrolls,3cjgu0,TimmannenMr,-1,Wed Jul 8 11:41:03 2015 UTC,I was inspired by that other survey to make my own. For science.
ElderScrolls,3ci7sj,Daniel_Kay,12,Wed Jul 8 02:45:20 2015 UTC,"My breakdown.  The Plot  I agree with most of what you're saying however, the pact between dragons and the empire didn't happen until the age of Tiber Septim. The reign of dragons as described in Skyrim happened during the Merethic Era.   Setting  What you have to remember is the intention of the developers. Skyrim was meant to be a harsher more ""frozen"" landscape. And also The Reach? Whitehold? Falkreath? The Rift? Eastmarch? Black Reach? It was like the devs said. Only Oblivion was supposed to have a bit of everything. Complaining that Skyrim is all grey rocks is like complaining that Morrowind is all brown swamps.   Combat  The Elder Scrolls series (and Fallout I might add) was never strong when it came to it's combat. The reason it's always forgiven is because of the SCALE of the game world. And anyway not many first person RPGs get melee combat ""right"". Dark Messiah is the only one I could think of.  The Argonians  Well of course there aren't many Argonians in Skyrim. Blackmarsh is a province away. Plus the Nords are already Xenopobic when it comes other races. It's the same reason that most of the population in Morrowind was Dunmer. Giving Skyrim a large Argonian population would have been forced and would not have fit the lore.  Gameplay   Yeah it would've been nice if Bethesda added crawl spaces and ladders. However full wall climbing would have taken way to much energy to develop. The reason for enclosed cities is of course hardware/Software limitations.   Inventory  I agree it's one of the many issues with sharing a game with a console.   Immersion   Ok I'm a bit lost about what you mean here exactly. Are you talking about them forcefully switching your camera from first to third person or are you talking about ""gameplay"" immersion. Gameplay wise , I would say the immersion has improved in its own way. It was Oblivion when they first added Radiant AI.    Lore  First off, the Ayleids and the Dwemer are two totally different races. Now the only book I could think of that described the Cyrodiil was A Pocket Guide to the Empire from Arena. I think it was a good decision to make Cyrodill the way it was. Best save the Jungle location for Elsweyr.   And to be honest if that's the only major gripe with the lore then they have been sticking to it pretty well. I certainly wouldn't say ""lore is pretty much gone"".   Edit: A few words."

ElderScrolls,3ci7sj,twisterrk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:52:15 2015 UTC,Yeah the clip doesn't really do the AI justice.  He was probably playing on easy.

ElderScrolls,3ci7sj,Victorioso21,2,Wed Jul 8 20:17:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, sorry for the generalization. With specific regards to your wishes for a combat system, have you seen a game that does it like that? Different damages for body zones, different animations if you're not as skilled with weapon? (Is that what you mean/what you want to see different when you describe the arrows in the lion skull with low damage?)    edit: I re-read and remembered that the lion reference was an Oblivion anecdote, but my question still works I think"
ElderScrolls,3ci7sj,lee61,2,Wed Jul 8 21:29:59 2015 UTC,"Sadly not, there aren't really a lot of games that do first person close combat well. Dark Messiah as mentioned elsewhere here is one that did a quite good attempt at it.  With the arrows the lions skull, that was something in Oblivion, I was level 20 but hadn't level archery up to that point which was only at level 5. But by that point the level scaling had already pushed the lions HP up so far that my bow and arrow did nothing against it.  You don't necessarily even need that many new animations for being unskilled with a weapon, what you can do is have different effects (the animation beind played slightly slower or faster), different amounts of stamina being used, maybe slightly different sound effects and the impact of the weapon having different results (glancing off, bouncing off, non bouncing slam or penetrating)  With locational damage you often get the mistake of people thinking ""then you just aim for the head for an instant kill"" but it's not that easy, the skull can take much more than you'd think. But imagine this, stab someone in the side and he's more hunched over there and the side he was stabbed in less effective, meaning if you hit him in the side he holds his weapon in the hits will be weaker and slower. Cripple someones leg and he won't be able to run or jump.  They did attempt it with New Vegas but didn't really do a good job at it. Get a ""Enemies head has been crippled"" message, which means they just stand there for a second and shake their heads as if they only have a headache. The system was simply inconsequential and ended up in bullet sponges o matter what you did.  Gameplay realism is a bit of a pet topic of mine, especially how it got a REALLY bad rep from simply being done so damn poorly over and over again."
ElderScrolls,3ci7sj,lee61,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:11:54 2015 UTC,"Some of the suggestions to combat you mentioned were implemented as perks in Skyrim.   Also crippling an enemies head reduced the perception by 4 and lowered the accuracy. The locational damage system had it's consequences.       Having realism is fine, as long as it doesn't become too tedious and detract from the overall experience.   Edit: I would like to say however that they could've did something different with the way archery works. Instead of ""low archery skill means low damage"" they could have replaced it with ""low archery skill means low accuracy and slightly lower damage"" and have damage be based more on stamina and draw time. Just a thought."
ElderScrolls,3ci7sj,orangemofo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:02:02 2015 UTC,"Yea, also archery could have done with low skill means you use up more stamina to hold the arrow at full draw and you shake more. Plus your strength could have mattered in it limiting what maximum draw weight of a bow you can use effectively. Not meaning ""your skill is too low, you can't use that bow"" but if you're too weak you can't get a full draw out of a heavy bow meaning it won't be at its full strength and accuracy. A ""weaker"" bow you can full draw is actually ""stronger"" for the user than a heavier bow you can only half draw."
ElderScrolls,3ci7sj,Arkalis,2,Wed Jul 8 23:22:21 2015 UTC,"Dark Messiah had locational damage (if I remember correctly).    Arx Fatalis magic system was interesting. It's purely skill and memorization based. Magic was god tier in this game if you went full mage. The only real limit was how fast you could cast (there were a ton of spells to remember, even hidden ones). However I don't think this system would've worked well in a game like Elder Scrolls. It would be interesting if it did happen  however.   The archery in Mount in Blade would be a good replacement to the archery in the Elder scrolls series. Mostly having a low skill in archery doesn't just mean low damage but also inaccurate shots. A novice archer wont have the same accuracy as a master."
ElderScrolls,3ci7sj,lee61,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:39:24 2015 UTC,"Yea those are good systems.  The magic system in Arx Fatalis was really interesting but yea it would be a bit too clunky so to say. One thing I'd suggest is having spell crafting be rune based, but you don't really do it in the heat of combat, you prepare spells and then only need time to ""activate"" a spell, afterwards it can be casted and ""charged"". Your magic skills would determine how many runes you can effectively use in a spell, how fast you can activate it and how far you can charge it.  Also for combat and archery, armor could really COUNT for a change, being able to fully absorb certain attacks but that coming at the price of costing stamina. A hit with a sword for example not being able to penetrate certain armors but the power of the hit still transfers costing the target stamina and reducing stability risking to trip it. For that the ""poise"" system from Dark Souls could be looked into, every hit reduces you poise value a bit, when it hits 0 you stagger or can be knocked down.  Generally here's something from Dark Souls I'd carry over, the ""two keys per hand"" system allowing you to alternate between attacks. Different than DS I wouldn't do it as stiff and without uninterruptable attacks. Like that you can make your attack less based on your body movements but on which button your press, whether you tap it (rapid attacks), time you taps (chained attack) or hold it (charged attack) and how you combine your button presses.  It's a bit long to explain here maybe, that pose about Skyrim is FAR from the only thing I have written up over the years, i have tons of suggestions, gaming ideas, possible systems and such all saved up in text files."
ElderScrolls,3ci7sj,ThatGuy743,2,Wed Jul 8 23:14:45 2015 UTC,"I think you're mostly right. For the game to continue as an RPG there needs to be much better lore and storytelling than there was in Skyrim, but I think there is a main point you are missing. Skyrim is a sandbox for the most part, where you can adventure through caves and bandit strongholds and play as you please. Assassin, mage, warrior or any mixture of the playstyles gives the player many options for combat.  This was something done well in Skyrim in regards to the casual gamer in the general public. These gamers are probably clueless to the story and basically focusing on how badass their character looks and how much gold they can find, or even exploring the various locations.   These players are the vast majority of Skyrim customers. For bethesda to focus on the hardcore RPG audience would not be very profitable. This is a hard truth."
ElderScrolls,3ci7sj,lee61,2,Wed Jul 8 19:49:27 2015 UTC,"I only started playing this franchise with Skyrim, and tried playing the other games (except Daggerfall). While I couldn't just get into them by the controls and graphics (yeah it may be superficial but I really tried to overlook them) this document really made me understand why are there so many TES fans pissed with Skyrim.  I thought it was nostalgia or hating on the new popular game that brought a huge audience of new players but this really seems to justify it in an eloquent manner. Previously I tried to find reason on the comments bashing Skyrim but now I finally get it.  Such a shame I never got into it, but maybe I'll give the games another try sometime."

ElderScrolls,3ce6qr,DasUberRedditor,55,Tue Jul 7 05:30:24 2015 UTC,"I believe UESP came first and was very information based and pretty thorough. The newer ES wiki had a more modern set up with more photos and gained popularity during Skyrim's reign. The trends continued but ultimately UESP is ""better"", because the community is much more thorough and the added activity from Skyrim's popularity led them to clean up the design and add more photos, etc. ES wiki, unfortunately, is prone to misinformation and incorrect entries/edits by frivolous users"
ElderScrolls,3ce6qr,lepigpen,34,Tue Jul 7 07:20:44 2015 UTC,"Apparently  UESP turned 20 this year! Another thing I have against elder scrolls wiki is that it only came about because of skyrim, kind of like the so many people whose first game was skyrim and think the next game will be skyrim 2."

ElderScrolls,3ce6qr,Dooflatchie,7,Tue Jul 7 14:47:49 2015 UTC,This.  Skyrim was a great game and took the series to new heights of popularity.  The money it made will ensure the series goes on.  We should all be glad it brought in so many new fans.
ElderScrolls,3ce6qr,ANUSTART942,4,Tue Jul 7 22:51:25 2015 UTC,"I can't even pick a favorite definitive TES game. I love them all for different reasons, but if I was to introduce someone to the series, it would probably be Skyrim. It's more streamlined, better gameplay in my opinion than the others, and honestly the one I end up playing most often.   They're all just such brilliant games and by reinventing the wheel every time a new one comes out it ensures that no one game can be 100% better than the others."

Simply compare Boethiah's calling on Teswiki to the UESP version.  UESP also has higher quality lore compared to the Teswiki.  Of course, keep in mind that if you want good lore, you should look at the Imperial Library.  Also keep in mind that the UESP tends to get more reliable information quicker.  Back about two years ago, Teswiki only had barebones descriptions of quests that were shitty on the level of unfair.co for secret world, while UESP had entire logs and states pulled from the editor."
ElderScrolls,3ce6qr,toxictaliban111,3,Tue Jul 7 14:17:31 2015 UTC,"Both Boethiah's Calling pages are pretty similar.

Warcraft III modding lead to Dota, which led to HoN, League of Legends, Smite, Dota 2 and the entirety of the Moba genre.  Blizzard also basically started eSports in Korea with StarCraft: Brood Wars.  I'm guessing you only play games on consoles because there's no excuse for not knowing who Blizzard are if you play on PC, even if you don't play MMORPGs they're still responsible for the biggest MMORPG since 2005 and the biggest RTS games ever as well as amazing single-player RPGs such as Diablo II.

ElderScrolls,3c98y9,Ged_UK,3,Mon Jul 6 12:59:47 2015 UTC,"I game exclusively on PC (I have an xbox in the loft and a dead 360 props up my monitor). I don't play online games much, Elite Dangerous is the only one currently. I know of Blizzard from WoW. I've heard of some of those but have no interest in playing them; card games like that have no interest for me, so why would I be interested in the myriad of iterations?   Edited out the unnecessarily aggressive comment."
ElderScrolls,3c98y9,bloodstainer,3,Mon Jul 6 13:25:23 2015 UTC,"All those Warcraft games are strategy games. Blizzard had the Warcraft and Starcraft series, which are both RTS games, and Diablo was made by them too, which is a roguelike RPG. Hearthstone is the only card game out of the lot of them, and WoW is a MMORPG that I thiink has nothing to do with cards. MOBAs, as they were mods of strategy games, are very much like strategy games."
ElderScrolls,3c98y9,Renxasis,3,Mon Jul 6 13:40:22 2015 UTC,"I think the name warcraft put me off those, to be honest. War tactics don't appeal much."
ElderScrolls,3c98y9,Ged_UK,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:26:01 2015 UTC,Hearthstone is set in the Warcraft universe and they used Wow as their main marketing tool to get it out to players. Sure they may not seem like they're going hand-in-hand but every single wow-player who played at the time of Hearthstone's release knew about the game and it grew very big during closed-beta.
ElderScrolls,3c98y9,Renxasis,4,Mon Jul 6 16:12:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is trying to be a dick...it's just hard to believe that you've been gaming for 30 years yet you only recognize Blizzard from WoW.  It's odd, especially for someone who games exclusively on PC."
ElderScrolls,3c98y9,bloodstainer,2,Mon Jul 6 14:00:49 2015 UTC,"Well only if you read lots of gaming press and forums, otherwise you don't hear much about them. I tend to play RPGs and FPS, but the offline ones.   I was just trying to think what the earliest games I played were, and as a result downloaded an iPhone version of Repton which I first played on the BBC B around 1985."

The big names they have made are Warcraft, Diablo, and Starcraft.  Diablo 2 is a hack n slash RPG and was in the top 20 best selling games of the year all the way up until 2010...10 years after it's release. If you walked into any walmart or target and checked the PC section you would have seen this.  South Korea has entire television channels dedicated to broadcasting nothing but Starcraft game coverage.     I just have a very hard time believing that you just haven't heard of them.  It's like not hearing about Ubisoft or EA.  Even if you don't follow gaming to any degree the company is massive and far reaching enough that it should at least show up on your radar occasionally."

The way I see it is the Silver Hand are a bunch of rich-kid brutes (near bandit like) with too much time on their hands and prejudice in their hearts, whilst the Dawnguard are dedicated Vampire Hunters who lost much of their lives to the misdeeds of Vampires and dropped everything to combat an immediate threat."
ElderScrolls,3c5cds,Dovahzyzz,4,Sun Jul 5 02:23:29 2015 UTC,I remember reading about the Silver Hand lore on reddit and apparantly there was unused dialouge that suggested that the Silver Hands broke off from the Companions when they decided to become werewolves.That doesn't answer the question but it gives yousome thing to think about.

ElderScrolls,3c5cds,takahashia16,2,Mon Jul 6 18:57:35 2015 UTC,"I always saw the Silver Hand as almost like a group of entitled religious zealots; burning the heretics (the impure werewolves) and so there would be a natural crossover of hatred / prejudice between the S.H and the Dawnguard since vampires are as perverse as werewolves.  That said, the Dawnguard seems to be less about hate and more about vengeance given its members comprise a lot of folks that have had close encounters, lost family members and the like and I don't see that meshing well with the fanaticism I tend to associate with the Silver Hand."
ElderScrolls,3c5cds,salvadorbard,2,Mon Jul 6 18:13:49 2015 UTC,"I don't really know about the Silver Hand even if your not a werewolf they still attack you. I think their more like bandits who like to hunt werewolfs for fun.  And as far as vampires joining forces with anyone but other vampires (in very rare cases) is laughable. Vampires are the children of domination the only time they'll pall up with you is if you are useful to them or you've proven yourself their better. like the dova, the will to power is in their very blood. hence lord harkon, the count of skingrad and other such high ranking folk"

ElderScrolls,3c51u2,SnS-Rinkuru,7,Sat Jul 4 21:23:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on what it is you enjoy in games, and ESO. There are graphic overhauls for Morrowind and Oblivion to make them look considerably better. Morrowind is my favourite game, if it isn't the biggest of the 3 (excluding Arena and Daggerfall) it feels like it is. A couple reasons for this though would be downfalls to some gamers, first there is no fast travel, instead there are services that can be paid for, boat rides, silt striders and teleportation between mages guilds. There is also no voice acting beyond simple greetings, all dialogue is written text, which allows for more information do be given by all NPC's, this I believe allows for a more immersive world, there is more Lore available to be learned within the game. Morrowind is a very good game if you want to adventure and explore at your own pace.  If you want just to learn more of the Lore, the main quests of Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim would be a good place to start, they are all massive games and would take thousands of hours to finish all together. But the main quests do pack the majority of the Lore that is in the games."
ElderScrolls,3c51u2,latuspod,3,Sat Jul 4 22:06:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  Fast travel is always nice but given the date of the games I won't be hurt.  As far as graphics go, my comp is very low end. I have to run ESO at low settings and it runs fairly well.  I'm mostly here for the experience not the graphics, even though they can be nice.  I've never actually played Morrowind but I've heard it's probably the best. Got maybe halfway through Oblivion and came real close to finishing Skyrim before newer games took over."
ElderScrolls,3c51u2,mhoner,2,Sat Jul 4 22:17:22 2015 UTC,"You say you won't be hurt now, but when you're playing Morrowind in your quest requires you to run to the opposite end of the continent, there will be a bit of pain.   I had to keep a list by my desk but showed all the different transportation points and where they went.  Do not get me wrong, it's an awesome game and I would highly recommend it. Just prepare yourself. Make sure you have a padded seat."
ElderScrolls,3c51u2,rct3fan24,3,Sat Jul 4 23:04:45 2015 UTC,"Really? I didn't have that problem. The silt striders and mages guild teleportation guys were usually able to get me where I needed to go. There were times when I needed to make a big trek, specifically from Maar Gan to the Urshilaku camp but that's part of the fun on the game.  Before travelling I did have to check the map to see if I was going to the right place, but that wasn't really a problem."
ElderScrolls,3c51u2,rct3fan24,3,Sun Jul 5 01:43:50 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a story experience, but not necessarily looking for smooth gameplay experience, play Morrowind, like... now. Right now. Unlike ESO, Skyrim, and Oblivion, it doesn't hold your hand. You really need to get invested in the world, ask people about where you can find things, and know what you're doing. It doesn't give you any quest markers, so you'll be checking your journal and map often.  Morrowind was actually the first Elder Scrolls game I completed the main quest in. I had Skyrim for several months before I installed my dad's copy of Morrowind, I never really got into it. After I played Morrowind I was finally able to get into the later TES games, because I was invested into its lore from then on. I didn't really care before I played Morrowind."
ElderScrolls,3c51u2,mishugashu,2,Sun Jul 5 01:52:39 2015 UTC,"TBH, Arena and Daggerfall aren't very rich in story. There's a main quest (which, admittedly, has a pretty decent plot, but nothing fantastic) and then everything else is either procedurally generated or random.  Morrowind is where it starts to get rich in lore and story. All in all, I still love all the games and Daggerfall is probably my favourite TES game of all time. It's pretty dated now, though, so it might be hard to get into as a modern gamer."
ElderScrolls,3c51u2,salvadorbard,2,Sun Jul 5 02:09:57 2015 UTC,"For story experience it's Morrowind all the way. Oblivion and Skyrim were both great games but something about Morrowind's gritty, atmospheric narrative was so intense and immersive that it felt much more like you and you alone were making a huge difference in the foreign land. Moreover, it doesn't have so much of the level scaling which if anything adds more realism because it's perfectly possible for a brand new character to run into places WAY beyond their level and get mulched for it. This I presume is what led to the level scaling in subsequent games but I like it - it's challenging to not know whether something disproportionately difficult is around the corner (much like I imagine real adventuring would be). I haven't played it for years now but every time I think of it it makes me want to pick up a controller and see Vivec or Sadrith Mora again..."
ElderScrolls,3c51u2,sheakauffman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:21:59 2015 UTC,of course their worth playing. But put any thought of ESO being canon behind you. It vilates so much lore it isn't even funny!

ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,topitsky,13,Sat Jul 4 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"One feature looks like it will certainly be in, as that seems to be the case with Fallout 4.  Interiors and exteriors are one space.  Doors are not dimensional portals to isolated universes.  I can look outside through a window and shoot at bad guys.  No loading screens just because I walked inside some shack somewhere.  Funny thing is nobody seemed to pay any attention to this game changing feature with the FO4 announcement.  It was all ""Holy wow weapon customization!"" and ""Gee whiz settlement building!""  That's all well and good but look at those windows! I can see through them! I could lob a grenade through them!  I could probably climb through one of them if I wanted! Woo!

ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,eightbitbeard,3,Sun Jul 5 03:30:46 2015 UTC,"that would be a nice mechanic but the problem then lies how would mechanics like Vampirism, and Lycanthropy work? Cause I swear to god if they make another game where vampires aren't wrecked to shit by the sun them I'm done."
ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,continous,3,Sun Jul 5 05:21:58 2015 UTC,It's likely using a form of chunk loading.
ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,continous,2,Sun Jul 5 05:53:14 2015 UTC,"hm.. unfamiliar with that but if I'm reading you right its sort of an invisible cell load? which is fine but it still leaves the question your in a courtyard cell and it's 'day' in the game, will the dev's create a type of sunlight scale? or will they go cheap again like in skyrim and eso and say vampires just take ""negatives"" instead of actuall death like in oblivion and especially morrowind which makes being a vampire a true struggle."
ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,continous,2,Sun Jul 5 05:56:59 2015 UTC,"Idk how they implement vampire damage as I tended to avoid vampirism and lycanthropy in Skyrim; however, I find it very unlikely that they'll not improve on it."
ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,Haplo12345,3,Sun Jul 5 06:00:04 2015 UTC,"understandable. Essentially vampirism is a fun RP element that makes your character ""immortal"" and adds some nice abilities like night vision and stat boosts the stronger your hunger is. However in morrowind and oblivion it had the apropriate penalties as well, the sun would kill you right quick so you'd need to take a pit stop in the near by cave and do some dungeon diving till the sun goes down.  And in morrowind and to a lesser extent oblivion your character was shunned and attacked by the populace. Morrowind actually made questing impossible when a vampire as no one would talk to you and guards would attack on sight, but oblivion reduced this with a bit of lore to back it up. People wouldn't recognize your unlife until your hunger was at stage 4 then people would just scream at you to get away... it was rather amusing actually but guards wouldn't attack your. plus you could go out in the sun (with heavy penalties) if you were fully fed. this mechanic was mainly so you could do your shopping and the like.  but skyrim made a right mess of the mechanics, you took no damage from sun and you could only feed from the sleeping which is a serious problem if there aren't any beggars sleeping outside to snack on. that combined with people attacking you on your max hunger it was almost impossible to feed thus it was quite broken. This was fixed finally in dawnguard when you could do a death feed move on low health enemies but it also removed the social aspect so you could waltz in max hunger and no one would bat an eye.  All of it was verry un immersive to say the least. especially when vampires are supposed to be hunted like dogs by every ""civilized"" society except for the more nefarious groups like the brotherhood, and thieves guild, and possibly the college I forgot whether or not. but you get what I'm getting at  Day walking vampires just don't work.  Ps. Lycanthropy was mostly fine because the companions explain that their breed was made when the hag ravens used magic that let them retain their sanity while under the moon"
ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,Noise964,3,Sun Jul 5 06:14:44 2015 UTC,"I actually found it super fascinating and theorized a couple of things, the biggest one being that they may be using a newer form of chunk loading. No longer the uGrids, or at least an updated version of this. That way they can load interior cells differently than exterior cells while also having them in the same instance. This is of course speculation, but it could definitely be akin to their method."
ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,TheBlackSun8,3,Sun Jul 5 05:54:43 2015 UTC,"If true, that's the biggest news in the Elder Scrolls series since Morrowind because it changes everything about how the world is structured."

ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,HogarthHues,2,Sat Jul 4 23:17:18 2015 UTC,Combat still needs a lot of work. It's nearly impossible to do a power attack or fire off a slow moving projectile spell in a large battle and not have a companion or friendly NPC get in the way. Friendly NPCs need an AI that deliberately avoids blocking your line of sight. Or something like in Mount and Blade where your attack animation cancels when a friendly gets in the way.  Companions are more of a hassle than they're worth and the inability to give orders to summoned creatures means they're just meat shields for the most part.  Also it's way too easy to accidentally steal stuff (calm down buddy it's just a spoon I'll put it back).
ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,openvjayjay,2,Sun Jul 5 22:57:20 2015 UTC,"I'd like better designed factions, emphasise a little more on making them feel like a faction rather than a mini storyline.  More weapon variation, stuff like Halberds, Morning Stars, spears, pitchforks! Go crazy. Also magic needs more to it, and bring back spellcrafting.  A great story, easier said than done but great characters bring a story to life and a lot of effort should be put into making characters on the same quality level as Vivec."
ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,bbgun09,2,Mon Jul 6 07:12:48 2015 UTC,My #1 most wanted feature would be to make magic damage scale according to skill and not simply reduce mana. That's by far my biggest sticking point with Skyrim.
ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,lumpy999,4,Mon Jul 6 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"Like many have said, they need to bring back a lot of the things that made Morrowind such a unique game.    First, they should try to re-implement many of the old mechanics like classes, birth signs, spellmaking, and the like.  These features really made your character feel unique, and brought some of the classic high fantasy roleplay of games like Dungeons and Dragons to the TES world.    Some of the features from Morrowind that stuck in my mind were how the world building flowed so well with mechanics.  For instance, the various Great Houses of Morrowind had varying rules and regulations that would very much affect how you had to behave in their respective settlements.  The Telvanni accepted theft since, to them, if one could get away with stealing something one clearly deserved whatever they stole.  There was so much variety in the world, everywhere you went there were new groups to learn about.  It wasn't so samey like skyrim tended to be.   Skyrim had variation, but it was mostly visual.  Their were few differences between holds, and many of the people treated you the same regardless of where you came from or what you did.  Laws in cities controlled by different factions were the same (aside from the Talos worship bit).    I'd also like to see some completely new features as well.  They should learn from Obsidian, and implement a ""hardcore"" mode that forces the player to account for hunger, thirst, and fatigue.  They could also add the mechanic from NV where faction related clothing can be used as disguises or even be something that could get you killed.  A few ideas I had myself would be some more options for speechcraft as a skill.  It's always been a skill that was quite lacking in the TES games.  Maybe some perks that allow players to unlock certain dialogue options or short cuts in quests via seduction, charm, intimidation, flattery, and the like?  Perhaps players with high level speechcraft could have high dispositions with others, even strangers?    Whatever they do, I'm sure it'll come out good, but I hope they at least try to return to their roots with TES6."
ElderScrolls,3c4hj0,Hosslium,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:54:43 2015 UTC,I would love to see better AI they seem to getting rather boring with little to no speech context with most of the AI out there. I'm a huge fan of lore and they seem to stripping that out a bit (given if you followed through all the games lore before hand it would be hard to continue). Also more skill lines and perks that are more one way. I do like how ESO uses different magic types deal different damage to different foes for once so that is quite nice however most of the perks are quite useless (like having 5 active spells that are just defense -_- with same stats!!). I would love if they also did a interface and graphic major rehaul where the damn pauldrons don't phase through my damn shoulders! And maybe bring back some newer classes(races) like the Ancient Elves and maybe do a daedric play through as evil and see it through their eyes.

""big bad demon monster bad, Big scary black spiky time travel dragon bad!""  I would hope for another alien world like Morrowind as well perhaps Summerset but irregardless they need to hire some decent writers and get a good story again.  I loved trying to decide my own truth regarding the Tribunal and my predecessor and much of the world helped me shape that choice. Also who could forget some of the ingenious ways the did quests? I loved the Tribunal temple quest where you had to carefully read a book and an inscription to figure out you must drown yourself.

ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,MrTimmannen,2,Thu Jul 2 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"Like as to say their origin is their demise, and their demise is their origin? Seems overtly paradoxical in nature, and they'd have to have an origination somewhere else, as they are a unique species of Mer."

What does Divayth say? He's an ""interesting case"". That's it. None of his daughter/clone/wives have anything to say on the matter. Neither does the warden.  Now, I'm sure Divayth knows one way or the other -- he's been around since before the Battle of Red Mountain, so he's likely actually interacted with living Dwemer. But he doesn't say. He just lets Yagrum say, and lets the Nerevarine think what he or she wants to."

I bet you don't believe in the Dreamer, either. Lol"
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Capt0bv10u5,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:35:22 2015 UTC,"Which physical characteristics? His spider-legs? Corprus-bloated body? He has pointy ears, but so do all mer.  You could make a better argument by pointing out his apparent familiarity with Kagrenac's work, knowledge of the otherwise-dead dwemer language, etc. On the other hand, he has had a few thousand years to work on his backstory.  Look, if dwemer could travel to different planes of existence, then surely there were more off-world than just Yagrum. So why is he the only one left? Either many dwemer survived and decided to never investigate their homeland, or none survived and Yagrum decided to claim the title.  Now, I'm not at all anti-Yagrum. I just think that TES3 is a game that encourages critical reading, and we should apply that to all aspects of its lore, including Yagrum's story."

ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Capt0bv10u5,6,Thu Jul 2 18:05:55 2015 UTC,I have a theory that the Dwemer are still here and right in front of us. I always speculated that when the experiment went wrong their bodies are what disappeared and their souls got stuck in all the constructs.   There are all these books and comments taking about how people are so surprised that the constructs still function after all these years. Maybe they attack everything that enters the Dwemer cities because they're defending their home and it's not just some security protocol. They may not posses a higher intelligence anymore but the basic functions are still there.   Plus you always see the Blind bros fighting with them or getting killed by them. Maybe the war is still going on and we're just too oblivious to notice.
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Eerbud,3,Thu Jul 2 18:52:29 2015 UTC,I've seen this theory presented before as well. It kind of runs alongside the numidium idea.
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Capt0bv10u5,2,Thu Jul 2 19:25:54 2015 UTC,"they win against the nords, but then relations with the chimer fail once again. Then they had a big battle at red mountain, and since they are loosing, the dwemer use the heart of lorkhan before properly completing all the preparations and whatnot. They end up becoming the skin of the numindium and all vanish. And yes Yagrum Bagarn survives by being in an outer realm. oooh"
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,MrTimmannen,3,Thu Jul 2 17:33:55 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to ever post one theory alone on the Dwemer threads wherever I go. There are far too many and far too little evidence. Granted, this is entirely by design, so good job Bethesda. Lol"
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Capt0bv10u5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:36:16 2015 UTC,no i just filled in the blank spots. (well except for the skin of the numindium part i guess)
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,MrTimmannen,2,Thu Jul 2 17:44:17 2015 UTC,"It's a very common theory, and one of my favorites in all honesty. Though, if I were to narrow down which theories I most agree with, it would rank a little lower than some.  My all time favorite is that they pissed off the gods and are being held captive in a plane of existence all their own. The issue with that theory is that if they were to ever be released they would be soooooo pissed. They were battle-ravaged at the time and would be all cooped up stewing over it all, becoming more and more aggressive and agitated as time progressed. They'd most likely try to kill everyone if they were to be released.   It would make it for a good game, but I stand by my point that we'll never see them again."
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Capt0bv10u5,0,Thu Jul 2 17:52:29 2015 UTC,oh yeah? and what gods would that be?
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,MrTimmannen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:56:01 2015 UTC,"Generally accepted to be the Devines, but nothing says they couldn't have pissed off the Deadra with their antics, they were kind of in their territory at Red Mountain. Some of the people in this camp tend to think it might have been the dreamer that they angered and he decided to stop dreaming about them."
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Capt0bv10u5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:58:29 2015 UTC,"yeah it would almost have to be the last options, because i don't think the divines are anywhere near powerful enough and neither are daedra lords. Also I think this theory is weaker then other theories"
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,MrTimmannen,2,Thu Jul 2 18:00:24 2015 UTC,"As I said, I hold no one, I just enjoy the debate (so long as it's healthy and constructive). I also think you might underestimate the power that the Devines and Deadra hold. Especially when you consider how long ago it happened, much of their power comes from worshippers and the faith therein. At that point more people followed key Deadra. And if you pissed of a Deadra on his home turf, he might take offense."
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Capt0bv10u5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:02:58 2015 UTC,especially the Divines are really weak after creating nirn and whatnot. And i don't think daedra lords have THAT mutch power outside their realm
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,MrTimmannen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:07:30 2015 UTC,"They would only need enough to pull the Dwemer into their realm, then they can do whatever they want to them. For all we know, the whole time were walking around the Shivering Isles we were walking on what Sheogorath turned the Dwemer into.  The Heart itself could've been a catalyst for the power required. And of course when you consider the Heart of Lorkhan, it points to a particular god entity being angry at the misuse."
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Capt0bv10u5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:10:50 2015 UTC,Now one thing about the dissapearence theories is the ash piles they leave behind. Any theories on the ashpiles.
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,MrTimmannen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:13:39 2015 UTC,"The ash isn't guaranteed to be from their bodies. The amount of energy expelled could have decimated their clothing and armor, it could just be a side effect like when we smell ozone after certain events. It could be the bodies were destroyed and the souls were trapped somewhere. Or in the event of the back in time theory, the soul was transported to their counterparts in the past."
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Capt0bv10u5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:22:37 2015 UTC,"but the ash isn't the only thing they leave behind. If their spiritual forms are trapped or whatever, then what are the ghosts about?"

ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Capt0bv10u5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:16:33 2015 UTC,dwemer ghosts foundin some ruins.  Most are hostile but one of them is an important part of the tribunal main quest
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,MrTimmannen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:20:09 2015 UTC,"Ooh, been a long time since I've done that quest. I can't recall the ghosts or the quests very well. So I'll speculate with limited knowledge on this part: could the ghosts be from before the events at Red Mountain?"
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Capt0bv10u5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:29:43 2015 UTC,I... Don't acctually know. It might be possible. Especially considering that most ruins don't have them.
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,MrTimmannen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:35:50 2015 UTC,"That's kind of my thought. The majority of ruins are void of spectral life, it's all automatons, bandits, and, in the case of Skyrim, the Falmer.    The ash piles can be explained away in various ways, but the ghosts are either pre-numidium or they debunk every theory that doesn't have them all just dead with no other sidebars."
ElderScrolls,3bvqj2,Capt0bv10u5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:40:26 2015 UTC,"I mean you should really add in the battle of red mountain in there, it is a very important part of the whole story"

They were okay but nothing like the others.   That being said Skyrim is still my #1 game of all time (and yes, I've played Morrowind and Oblivion, a lot).

ElderScrolls,3buonq,kittenTakeover,0,Thu Jul 2 16:08:19 2015 UTC,They can't improve in a vacuum without feedback. 5 years is too long. Massive amounts of play testing and modding followed by judicious implementation of player suggestions is what's needed. The major strides over the last two games have all come from player feedback.
ElderScrolls,3buonq,NickMotionless,14,Thu Jul 2 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"I don't see why people are thinking it will come out so much later.  Arena: 1994 Daggerfall: 1996 Morrowind: 2002 Oblivion: 2006 Skyrim: 2011  2, 6, 4, 5. It's already been 4 years since Skyrim was released. With the way that Bethesda does Elder Scrolls games, I expected it to be announced at E3 this year and released on the 5th year (2016).  But, they didn't. Which most likely means that they'll announce it next year at E3, which will be 5 years after Skyrim and will probably be released either late next year or in 2017. Either of which are likely.  There's no way that you'll be waiting past Q1 2018. It'd be ridiculous. Bethesda is a company that has to make money to please their investors. Forcing their most iconic and profitable IP to take a backseat for 7+ years is a stupid business decision and will piss off investors. I'm sure that Bethesda is already working on Elder Scrolls VI right now, but we won't see anything on it for quite a while.  Like I said, though. I wouldn't think we'll be waiting longer than 1-2 more years. 2019 would be ridiculous. 8 years for a single Elder Scrolls title is just ridiculous compared to their usual timely releases."

I wouldn't call a wait that long rediculous for these games, but it's definitely not ideal. Bethesda does a lot more other then just TES/Fallout and they do not work on Fallout and TES simaltaneously, one is always more predominant.  If we look at a different lineage; fallout 3 2008, skyrim 2011, fallout 4 2015... TESVI 2018/19  I hope that helps you see my reasoning behind this theory  I feel like 2017 is the absolute earliest it will be announced"
ElderScrolls,3buonq,ralidra,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:53:00 2015 UTC,"True, but TES has provided them with more fan hype than fallout. TES includes three GOTY awards back to back while the fallout series has only given them one. Also, the lore behind the Elder Scrolls is really intensive so it's fans end up being bigger fans of the franchise than normal. It usually results in the fans being more prone to buying merch.  TL;DR TES fans are bigger fans so they'll buy more merch. Bad business decision to withold those fans of their game."
ElderScrolls,3buonq,SargeantSasquatch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:57:46 2015 UTC,"Whilst i do agree with you comment, i b3lieve fallout fans are buying more content and merch than ever with the release of fallout 4, including myself.   You have to remember theyve released 5 tes games and 1 fallout game. This next fallout will NO DOUBT bring more GOTY awards, and prove they need to support it as much, if not more, then they did skyrim.  And i believe they both have quite dirivitive lores, tes's being more worldly based and fallouts being more narrative based.  I would also like to point out i am a much larger TES fan than fallout..

You do realize that that would make the ES wait top the current Half-Life wait, yes?  We'd literally be waiting longer than people have for Half Life 2 - Episode 3.

ElderScrolls,3buonq,healer56,6,Fri Jul 3 16:38:02 2015 UTC,"Todd said they were already putting together ideas and bits of work for FO4 before Skyrim was even done.

ElderScrolls,3buonq,SargeantSasquatch,4,Fri Jul 3 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. I don't know what's with all the predictions around 2018 and 2019. Between Morrowind and Oblivion there were 4 years, another 5 for Skyrim. Let's presume they take their time and need 6 years to make the new one, that's 2017. And take in account:  In the Making of Oblivion they said the development started immediately after releasing Morrowind.  In the Making of Skyrim they said the development started immediately after releasing Oblivion.  In the E3 they said the development of FO4 started immediately after releasing FO3.  Do you really think they are waiting to finish FO4 before starting work on TES:VI? Come on, it's probably half finished already. I think we'll play it in late 2016/mid 2017."
ElderScrolls,3buonq,lodvib,2,Thu Jul 2 09:21:53 2015 UTC,"There's no way that you'll be waiting past Q1 2018.   I disagree.  My money is on a release during holiday season, 2018.  Bethesda Game Studios has one development team, and historically when they release a major title, they split off a small part of the team to work on patches and DLC for the new release, while the majority of the team switches over to the new project.  That means they probably haven't even started work on TES VI yet.  They will likely begin doing that this fall, so 2018 seems like a reasonable estimate."
ElderScrolls,3buonq,SargeantSasquatch,2,Thu Jul 2 23:22:40 2015 UTC,"While I agree on the date, I have to challenge...   That means they probably haven't even started work on TES VI yet.   Oh I'm guessing they have.   We do realize that work on FO4 started before Skyrim released, yes? They stated that they were working on two games, one had just started, one was just about ready.  We should also bear in mind last years batshit hiring spree.   My guess is that ESVI is in early development, and that we'll get a 2018 release.  People saying 2017 are high. People saying 2020 are equally as high."

ElderScrolls,3buonq,SargeantSasquatch,0,Fri Jul 3 16:35:20 2015 UTC,"I'd guess exactly 2018 myself.  That'd put the exact same time between ES games as there was between FO games.  Seriously.

ElderScrolls,3buonq,CSGOWasp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"It's not a matter of Bethesda's quality. It's a matter of logic.  Take Half Life 3 (Incidentally, a 2019 release would make the ES wait match the current wait between HL2 - Ep2 and HL3 (Or more properly, HL2 - Ep 3)  I've heard theories that it can never come out or it will destroy Valve.  People have been waiting so long and the hype keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.  Thus the game will never meet the hype expectations and will be a disappointment no matter how good it is because it will never be what people have spent seven to eight years imagining it will be.  Let's face it. Elder Scrolls is a big name game. It's a dangerous thing to put too much time between big names.  Me, I'm guessing 2018.  That would put the exact same time between ESV and ESVI as there was between FO3 and FO4.   Seven years.  I think a lot of people object because they imagine they don't start work on ESVI until they finish work on the last FO4 DLC.  They forget that planning of the next game typically starts the second the previous one hits the shelves (Work on FO4 started shortly before Skyrim was released. Read up on it. They said they had two games in the works. One was just starting, the other was just about ready.)   They also forget that last year they went on a batshit crazy hiring spree and essentially hired a new development team."

ElderScrolls,3buonq,WhenisHL3,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:24:13 2015 UTC,I definitely think they will top skyrim. I just hope that they take their time making the game.

ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,betterthanriku,4,Wed Jul 1 02:00:10 2015 UTC,The Elder Scrolls series typically doesn't continue the plot of a previous instalment.
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,Contagious_Cure,6,Wed Jul 1 03:53:26 2015 UTC,I'm thinking they're willing to make an exception considering the build up towards another Great War.
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,takahashia16,2,Wed Jul 1 13:37:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure another Great War will happen. The first Aldmeri Dominion collapsed on its own. The Second was conquered by Tiber Septim and the current Dominion is ruled by the Thalmor which up until the Oblivion Crisis was a minor political faction that was commonly disregarded as racist elven supremacists.  If Bethesda draws its lore from real history, extreme right wing factions typically rise by uniting people under a common perceived threat (in the Elder Scroll's case it's men vs mer) but eventually fail when their internal problems catch up to them."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,Contagious_Cure,2,Sun Jul 5 05:36:55 2015 UTC,"No, but the broader political machinations - like the weakening of the Empire, the loss of territory or whatnot - does get hinted at. It wouldn't be weird to see something about the Dominion, because they have a place in the world, now."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,Mikeahya,2,Sun Jul 5 02:20:20 2015 UTC,"Well. There's the side the Dominion wants you to see; strong, united, absolute authority, and there's the side they don't want you to see. If you read some of their intelligence reports and talk to that Wood Elf Imperial Legate at one of the imperial camps, you find out the Thalmor have re-education camps for fellow High Elves that don't accept their style of government and that there were ethnic cleansings in Valenwood. Thing' probably aren't as peachy as the Thalmor would advertise, but then again, no one shows their weaknesses to their enemies."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,Contagious_Cure,2,Sun Jul 5 05:31:41 2015 UTC,Which would be an awesome setting. It'd be somewhere between Dunmeri Vvardenfell and Nazi Germany in the 30s.

TES games were all pretty close in time except Skyrim, so I don't think it'd be completely unprecedented to follow up with the Thalmor -especially considering how cool their plot is, and the threat they might be to Tamriel. The Psijic Order seemed just mysterious enough to not be finished during the College questline, so I could see them (and maybe the Eye, though I think that's a little too much continuity for a TES game!) playing a role. TESVI: Artaeum? Nah, too hard to pronounce.  But Hammerfell could be cool as well. They repelled the Thalmor successfully, right? If the next game does involve the Thalmor (which it very well might not) that could come into play somehow.  I love speculation about the next game at this stage, because there are so many possibilities."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,thoroq,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:18:47 2015 UTC,"My guess is that it will take place in the aldmeri dominion post great war, with the thalmor embassy already taken down. This will give us 3 provinces, elsweyr, valenwood, and the summerset isles, which has a lot of potential with current gen consoles and such. Being post great war will allow for more racial diversity. Also Bethesda has a bit of a prisoner fetish, so you could be a war prisoner."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,Avantrest,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:34:03 2015 UTC,"I really hope that they will work on a magic-focused game focused in the Summerset Isles. Bethesda could really milk the ideas of 'magical' cities (floating cities, etc.).  Magic in Skyrim was thought out very poorly."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,obeseclown,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:54:41 2015 UTC,"Are there floating cities in Summerset? IMO Valenwood would be fucking awesome with the treetop cities, but there's little to no ethnic diversity so it might feel a little bland."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,obeseclown,3,Fri Jul 3 16:01:39 2015 UTC,"I understand your point about ehtnic diversity, but Skyrim wasn't necessarily the most diverse province, either. Probably 65% of the NPC's were Nords. However, Bethesda still squeezed in Argonians, Bretons, Orcs, and High Elves."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,obeseclown,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"I know, I kind of wished there was more ethnic diversity in Skyrim, which I hope for with TES6 (though everything's rumour at this point). The only place that felt realistic was Markarth with many Bretons (I mean, to be honest, they did have their land taken away)."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,Atvelonis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:45:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, diversity would be a huge plus for me. Bethesda just might be able to make it work in Hammerfell if they included Orsinium, but even if TES6 is set there, Orsinium would probably be an expansion pack. A worthwhile one, but DLC nonetheless."

ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,KaiserNarr,0,Fri Jul 3 20:22:57 2015 UTC,"Elder Scrolls games are usually a good distance apart from each other chronologically, so I find it unlikely that the next one will have anything to do with Skyrim. All the same, I think it actually might take place in the Summerset Isles. Excluding the island of Auridon in ESO, it hasn't been visited in any recent Elder Scrolls game. And after two consecutive main series games in human provinces I think it is time for a switch to somewhere Elven."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,Roger_Moore007,7,Wed Jul 1 04:43:26 2015 UTC,"Elder Scrolls games are usually a good distance apart from each other chronologically   Why do people keep saying this? The first four games took place over a period of 30 years, with as little as four years between Morrowind and Oblivion. Does everybody think Uriel VII is really old or something? He's in every game except Skyrim."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,nomanhasblindedme,5,Wed Jul 1 08:51:21 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people say that either. Skyrim is the only Bethesda game that jumped a great deal of time after the previous game.
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,PieFlava,2,Thu Jul 2 03:11:05 2015 UTC,While I don't disagree with you about close together the games were. Uriel WAS in fact very old he was in his 80's when he was killed. To that note a spry old geezer too.
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,PieFlava,2,Fri Jul 3 01:37:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I meant like reeeeeeaaaally old, like 100's/1000's of years old."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,PieFlava,0,Fri Jul 3 03:46:58 2015 UTC,I dont understand why everyone thinks bethesda will decide on one place. Why not all of Tamriel? We know it's possible. Maybe even as far as Akaviri DLC
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,Johnny-raven,0,Sun Jul 19 05:40:17 2015 UTC,"I guarantee it won't be all of Tamriel for one reason: Density. Skyrim, Oblivion, and Morrowind all had tons of locations. Bethesda was able to do this because they focused on one province. These games let the player explore a tiny portion of Tamriel to its fullest extent. If we were to get a game set in the entire continent, the amount of content would be half of what we could get on one province."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,obeseclown,0,Sun Jul 19 14:12:24 2015 UTC,"What about using ideas that Slightly Mad has been using? one example, No Man's Sky only loads that which you can see. Anything else is removed from memory but without the world being random. Also, there has been World of Warcraft for ages, that isnt anything new. And lastly, are we forgetting ESO? We know its possible, and would still be lore friendly as a fifth era game (probably when it will take place) would probably be centered around Landfall. As we all know, Landfall greatly affects all of Nirn, not a single province of a single country."
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,Johnny-raven,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:28:44 2015 UTC,What is Landfall?
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,obeseclown,0,Mon Jul 20 00:38:43 2015 UTC,"Basically, the last of the Dwemer sacrificed themselves to create Numidium (a giant Dwemer Centurion that almost counts as a God). Numidium will return in the 5th era with the intention of destroying Nirn and the dwemer will return to Tamriel with him. This event is called landfall. More prophecy says some things about certain races like Khajiit escaping to the moon and other crazy things which yiu can read here http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Numidium I really home this will be the premise of TES: VI"
ElderScrolls,3bpcvn,Johnny-raven,-2,Mon Jul 20 04:31:19 2015 UTC,I think it will take place take place in a human dominated continent because Bethesda would not want to alienate new-comers to the series by throwing them into a land filled with elves or cat/lizard people

ElderScrolls,3bpkmy,Atvelonis,2,Wed Jul 1 04:02:32 2015 UTC,"No idea why it was $69.99 instead of $59.99, might just be because it's new for consoles, not sure.  The $99.99 version is the Imperial Edition, where you are able to play as an Imperial (a race exclusive to those who have the edition) in any of the alliances, and you receive a mount early on. You also get some vanity items such as a pet mudcrab, and a special ""blessing"" between yourself and another player (of your choice) which gives you experience boosts and such.  It affects gameplay to a reasonable extent but it isn't a huge advantage so if you don't want to pay the extra money for it it's not like you'll be underequipped or anything, you'll be fine."

We hope you give them the same support and feedback you've given us for so long.   So... As already pointed out, this was posted over a year ago, but does this mean that they will not produce additional TES titles for single players? Similar to what Blizzard has done with Warcraft, no new titles after WC3 since WoW came out. Or was this just a rallying cry to shower ZOS with lots of love and money (preferably ours)?"

Do something different that makes me feel like I'm in the Elder Scrolls world.  Keep pumping out imaginative, interesting cards, and boy, there'd better be a lot of cards!  I hope that they don't make this a giant money grab.  I feel Hearthstone is incredibly overpriced, so I don't spend anything.  I want Legends to be priced in such a way that I don't feel ripped off.  I WANT to give them my money, but I want to get my money's worth!  Hope the developers aren't afraid to nerf clearly overpowered cards and occasionally buff underpowered cards.  Keep things fresh and keep it moving!  The developers can't be afraid to admit when they messed up and have to fix something.  Anyhow, I'm looking forward to Elder Scroll Legends.

I started playing from Morrowind and one of the things I loved was the amazing amount of books found throughout the game.   Damnit, there better be a ""Lusty Argonian Maid"" card in there or I shall RAGE!!!! j/k :D  As far as the mechanics, that's what's going to make the game stand itself apart from Hearthstone. It can't just be an overt copy of Hearthstone....Perhaps playing ""Lorkhan, The Missing God"" against a ""Vivec, Warrior Poet"" will open up some sort of action mini game within a match.   I'm sure they got some creative cats over there and I'm betting we won't be disappointed. :)"

You start off in a cultist jail and they try to offer you their lord and it turns you into a new sub species.     It could give new powers and it would open up new interactions with the world.  Would you consider your new form a gift or curse? Would you like to get cured or embrace it? Will you spread your new form to others?  If Hircine and Molag Bal can do such a thing why can't others?

ElderScrolls,3baxg7,braden26,12,Sat Jun 27 19:34:26 2015 UTC,I'm hoping they reverse the changes to magic that they made in skyrim. Also hoping for changes to how the level scaling works. I like to rush specials but that doesn't work in skyrim.  Also maybe Orc strongholds having a better role? it would be cool if you could unite them or something.
ElderScrolls,3baxg7,DoopSlayer,12,Sat Jun 27 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"Skyrim had new guilds. You had the companions, Dawnguard, College of Winterhold. I for one would like to see an already established guild be fleshed and and explored rather than introduced. Maybe delve further into the Morag Tong or join the Twin Lamps.  I'm tired of introductory stuff. I want some meaningful quest lines. I think the last quest line in an Elder Scrolls game that actually felt like I was part of the Guild I joined was Oblivions Dark Brotherhood."
ElderScrolls,3baxg7,Lonedrags,10,Sat Jun 27 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"The Companions and College of Winterhold were effectively the Fighters and Mage guilds, just with different names though."
ElderScrolls,3baxg7,hanguitarsolo,5,Sun Jun 28 00:58:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The CoW and Companions are guilds designed specifically for mages and fighters respectively, but they don't really resemble THE Mages Guild and Fighters Guild. The College is a small teaching institution, whereas the Mages Guild was more a huge organisation that attracted and focused on research and a place for mages to come together and discuss magical topics. The Companions were a mead hall with some hunters and mercenaries, really. Sure the Fighters Guild were just mercenaries too, but they were structured and widespread, and concentrated on contracts, whereas the Companions were more just a group of Nords who did odd jobs."
ElderScrolls,3baxg7,gingerdeer,3,Sun Jun 28 18:17:41 2015 UTC,They are games based around a magic medieval fantasy world. Not like they can create Aviation club. Only so much they have to work with.

ElderScrolls,3baxg7,mrmiffmiff,2,Wed Jul 1 06:15:24 2015 UTC,I have to agree. The dark brotherhood in oblivion was so vile and it was fleshed out in their characters. Standing around telling stories of blood and gore as art while most of them being rather nice people very fulfilled by their occupation of murder. They had so much character and purpose while the brotherhood in skyrim was nothing but some fumbling mercenaries shunning the ways of sithis and the tenants.
ElderScrolls,3baxg7,pike184,3,Mon Jun 29 23:31:48 2015 UTC,"Yes! The guild lines in skyrim were so pathetic, especially compared to past games. I think the quests in general could use a bit more variety as half of them involved dredging through yet another dungeon which basically what you do when you're not questing either. As for a new guild I always thought a merchant/crafting guild would be cool, but Bethesda would need to overhaul that entire system to make it work. But, I digress.

ElderScrolls,3baxg7,Tufto,2,Sun Jun 28 16:16:34 2015 UTC,"1) Better writing. Seriously, while Skyrim was a great game, the plots of the main quest and most sidequests were awful. Somewhat immersion-killing.  2) More interesting side-quests. Dungeon crawling gets very boring very quickly. There needs to be a greater variety of quest types beyond ""go to dungeon, kill, return object"" or variants thereof. There are few really good sidequests as a result.  3) More decision-making. Alternative endings, restrictions based on race, that kind of thing. Walking into the middle of Windhelm when all Argonians are supposedly banned from entering the city grated my teeth. What race you play should be a little more than just a skin. I don't think that too much differentiation of bonuses should really be a thing, though, as each race should be chosen because of how cool you think the look or lore is, not because you're trying to create the optimum build. But locking quests or changing how they play out or changing the opinions some characters have of you would be good.  3) Possibly a better combat system. Not as vital though; I'm reasonably happy with how the mechanics work, it's just they're functioning in a moderately dull world."
ElderScrolls,3baxg7,litemeonfire,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:08:26 2015 UTC,Dude. I agree with all of what you have said. I think they need to give you more options in dialogue like in witcher 3.

ElderScrolls,3baxg7,MarshManOriginal,4,Sat Jun 27 17:29:41 2015 UTC,"You are missing out.  It's like this.  I've never been able to play Dark Souls. It's just... So fucking apathetic. Like, I get that it's more of a Dungeon Crawl style RPG. Not an Intrigue RPG. It's the perfect RPG for people who trawl image boards and use the term ""Normies"" unironically.   Go through dungeon. Kill monsters. Obtain loot. Equip loot. Go through harder dungeon. Kill monsters. Obtain loot. Equip loot.   But good lord. I have not seen an NPC in dark souls who isn't some hunched up little shit who speaks in freaking mutters. The knight guy with the sun on his tabard isn't hunched up, but he still fucking mumbles every god damn line.   I'm sure I'm missing out on a lot.  Morrowind is exactly the opposite. The combat is a fucking nightmare because they tried to mesh old school dice roll systems with modern hack and slash and it came out shit on both fronts.   But most of the characters are vibrant. All of the main plot characters. That's where I'd like to really see them improve. Further that. Stumble into a random apartment where Khajiit assassin is hiding? He doesn't let you leave (Or tries to stop you) to keep his secret from getting out, he's not just like ""Dur, get outta here, punk.""  It's why I can't get into Dark Souls. I prefer social RPGs. I could give less than a shit about stats and gear.  I'm sure I'm missing out, but good fuck, I have never encoutnered a more apathetic world than the one in Dark Souls.  Don't care if that's somehow connected to the plot. If you cook me a steak that tastes like shit and say ""No man, no, it's supposed to taste like shit."" I'm not going to eat it.  As a function, the sociability of Dark Souls is just fucking nightmarish."
ElderScrolls,3baxg7,MarshManOriginal,3,Sat Jun 27 20:05:12 2015 UTC,"See, Dark sousl has a huge world and story and a lot of lore, and it's all really good. And there are many NPCs, and most don't just utter random bullshit. A lot have their own stories and character to them. It's just not shoved into your face. You have to go out of your way to find it. There's a story to it, and there's so much going on in the background and so much that has happened in and to the world. And you can find every bit of it if you take the time to look and pay attention.  Sorry, but you're wrong. I couldn't compare it to morrowind having not played it, but it's one of the best of any RPGs I've played.  And even still, my point that TES would benefit from dark souls style combat. Maybe a bit more forgiving, but that style is the right way to go."
ElderScrolls,3baxg7,MarshManOriginal,0,Sat Jun 27 20:41:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but you're wrong.   Have to disagree.  My point is that looking at something, disliking a feature, and not playing it at all means you are missing out.  First impressions of Morrowind Combat is that it's shit, don't play game.  First impressions of Dark Souls is that it is Socially Awkward - The Video Game, don't play game. Seriously, everyone I know who is big on Dark Souls is the sort of gamer I'm talking about. I think there's one guy who isn't, and he just loves everything. Loves TES just as much as Dark Souls.  Morrowind's Combat get's better once your skills are higher.   Dark Souls characters get better, apparently.  See how I'm missing out?  Apply the same principle to Morrowind. If there's one thing you can't criticize Morrowind for, it's the depth of the world and the lore. I mean, look at CHIM for fucks sake.  To go on completely unaware the story/lore/world because you don't like the combat is just like my knowing fuck all about dark souls because all I see in it is that it's basically a game for obsessive basement dwellers who are afraid of social interaction and view RPGs as a formulaic system to be broken.    And even still, my point that TES would benefit from dark souls style combat.    I'd prefer Mount and Blade.  From what I've seen, Dark Souls just involves wildly swinging a sword through the air. The physics are just a lot better than in Skyrim/Oblivion."
ElderScrolls,3baxg7,MarshManOriginal,2,Sat Jun 27 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"Except you're comparing apples and oranges.  The combat in morrowind is terrible. That's a fact. So I didn't play it.  Is the story good? possibly. I haven't played it. I'm not saying it isn't.  However, when you say that dark souls doesn't have any kind of story to ti or anything, then you are actually wrong.  And this isn't even relevant to my point in the first place.    Dark Souls just involves wildly swinging a sword through the air.   The fuck does that even mean? like, at all? Any game with a aword is going to be just swinging a sword around. That's the point of a sword. You swing swords. What it has over skyrim, or any TES game for that matter, is an element of player skill. You can beat the entire game without taking damage. If you're good enough, you can completely avoid it. You can take on very powerful enemies and bosses without levelling up once. It'll take a long time, but it's very possible. Essentially, you can play the game and not get hit by your own skill. No TES game has that. Just swing your sword and hope you're doing more damage than they are to you."
ElderScrolls,3baxg7,BurpingMexican,0,Sat Jun 27 21:11:27 2015 UTC,"The combat in morrowind is terrible. That's a fact. So   Not once you get your skills up. Easy combat is just not shoved into your face. You have to go out of your way to properly develop your skills. Combat is wonderful if you take the time to understand what skills and attributes do what and advance them accordingly.   However, when you say that dark souls doesn't have any kind of story to ti or anything, then you are actually wrong.   See. Here's the thing. You can swear up and down that a shack in the woods is really a mansion if you look at it the right way, but all I'm seeing is a shack in the woods.  Dark Souls fans keep telling me this, but whenever I see them play, all I see is them trawling through dungeons in standard ""Kill enemies, loot, kill harder enemies, loot again."" and talking to hunched up, mumbly little shits.   You can beat the entire game without taking damage. If you're good enough, you can completely avoid it. You can take on very powerful enemies and bosses without levelling up once. It'll take a long time, but it's very possible. Essentially, you can play the game and not get hit by your own skill.   So basically it's exactly what I'm describing?  A game for people who view RPGs as a system to be worked.   The fuck does that even mean? like, at all?   It means that the combat, from what I've seen, is just flailing a sword in the air. I don't care if it's super advanced flailing with this omg so uber system you can work so you never get hit, it's still just flailing.  Compare and contrast with Mount and Blade where direction of attack is probably the most important feature.  Block left when someone swings down and you are getting hit. You have to block up or your parry is useless. Apply the same in reverse when on the attack.  I'd much prefer this sort of direction in Elder Scrolls combat, more than better flailing."

This could probably be observed by searching through khajiit houses in the games and look for any quantity of vegetables.  Moon sugar in general is also a spiritual tool for khajiit, so there's a greater connection with it anyway."

But if you dig deep into the lore you can see that none of the main species of the game connect directly with any reality out here.    Humans are the best example:   Humans are descendants of huge men that eventually became the nords and then spread out to become most of the other human races. The Giants that you see wandering around skyrim most closely resemble the original ""humans"" that arrived on skyrim. In this way, we can see that the devs are presenting us with humans that physically look like us, but their origins might as well make them a different species.

ElderScrolls,3b484l,StabbyDMcStabberson,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:32:11 2015 UTC,Thanks.  It just seems like Morrowind has more issues with crashing.  I have over 100 mods and an ENB with Skyrim and it took of course a while to get it working properly with load order etc.    Morrowind just seems like a different beast.  Ill keep trying.  Any though on needing Wyre Bash?  Some video online said I will need that.  Also do I need a script extender in general like SKSE with Skyrim?
ElderScrolls,3b484l,macbone,2,Thu Jun 25 22:46:58 2015 UTC,"The version for Morrowind is called Wrye Mash, and yes, it's good at repairing references and fixing saves.  You should also get MLOX, which sorts your load order for you and tells you if you're missing dependent plugins.  Some mods do require MGSE, but they should say so.  If you haven't downloaded the Morrowind Code Patch, make sure you get it, too."
ElderScrolls,3b484l,ducksaws,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:09:41 2015 UTC,"I never needed wrye bash for morrowind... I don't think. You don't need a script extender unless a mod specifically says it needs it.  Just follow instructions for each mod and don't get more than one mod for each thing.

ElderScrolls,3b484l,Saeta44,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:49:32 2015 UTC,"My immediate thought with crashing like that is that you may require Morrowind Graphics Enhancer for a few of your mods. Do you have this? It includes Morrowind Script Enhancer, which allows modders to change quite a bit to the game and will definitely crash the game if a mod calls upon a function that does not exist in vanilla Morrowind."

That being said, it definitely looks like a Redguard light chest piece, but a female  version. The male versions start having twisted robe portions at cotton, but the female versions keep this appearance in your link. The front bit protecting the crotch begins to have that particular pattern at cotton or silk (forget which). However, none have the trench coat part that extends down like that.

My impression is that the PVE content should be playable with that kind of ping. PVP not so much.

ElderScrolls,3at70b,Calypse27,3,Tue Jun 23 12:22:30 2015 UTC,This is the first game of Elder Scrolls series. Called Arena and its release date is March 1994. I suggest that you can play at least once. Also you can try Daggerfall. In the Elder Scrolls official you can download them. Its totally legal. ;)  The Elder Scrolls: Arena  The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall
ElderScrolls,3at70b,Calypse27,2,Tue Jun 23 12:29:18 2015 UTC,"Yea I've watched videos of them, people that have played them never really have anything good to say. They say that Morrowind and on were a lot better."
ElderScrolls,3at70b,noplzstop,4,Tue Jun 23 13:53:08 2015 UTC,"Of course, Morrowind is milestone for Elder Scrolls game series; graphics, technical system, and more. But you can try it. Trust me."
ElderScrolls,3at70b,robot_cousin,2,Tue Jun 23 14:17:20 2015 UTC,Yea I think I would jump straight to Daggerfall
ElderScrolls,3at70b,Zyr47,4,Tue Jun 23 14:56:29 2015 UTC,"Even after playing the last 3 Elder Scrolls games to death, Daggerfall was overwhelming to me. Making a character was an ordeal, there are so many skills and then there's a whole dice roll thing and a bunch of other stuff not in later games. Getting out of the first dungeon was a huge ordeal, partly because its huge and full of enemies that aren't easy at level 1, but also because I didn't know what the exit looked like (a stone archway plastered on a wall somewhere).  But once I got into it, it's actually been really cool. Definitely hasn't aged super well, but there's a whole lot of ambition. You can buy a wagon, houses in dozens of cities, take out loans at banks, buy a ship, join any number of guilds, temples, and knightly orders, and even the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild (if you can figure out how...)  Sometimes it's too ambitious for its own good, though. Dungeons are insanely huge, and navigating them fully can take hours. The randomized nature of the quests mean you could be looking for your quest target in a dungeon for minutes, hours, or in-game weeks, which can mean failing a quest as most of them have time limits. Sometimes, the dungeon is arranged in such a way that reaching the quest target is impossible, or hidden behind a switch puzzle or hidden door so obscure you'd never figure it out. It's frustrating exploring a dungeon for hours and never finding the quest target.  There are tens of thousands of towns, but they pretty much all feel the same. Some are big, some are small, some have walls around the city and gates that shut at night (a good opportunity to use the climbing skill since you have to climb or levitate over to get in). The hugeness of the world (roughly twice the size of Great Britain) means that walking between locations takes hours IRL (walking just two pixels over on the map took me about 20 minutes), and it's estimated that walking across the entire map would take two weeks of continuous walking, though I don't think anyone has ever actually done it. This makes fast travel mandatory, and that kinda takes away from the scale of the game when you never really experience it first-hand.   Still, it's huge, incredibly deep (even compared to Morrowind) and there's a lot to enjoy still. I'd recommend trying it out, I mean, it's free."
ElderScrolls,3at70b,Calypse27,3,Wed Jun 24 16:28:27 2015 UTC,"ES2: Daggerfall is one of my all-time favourite games, and yes, a lot of that is looking through daedric-tinted eyewear. Still, parts of it hold up."
ElderScrolls,3at70b,Zyr47,5,Wed Jun 24 01:31:40 2015 UTC,"I liked Arena, it's just hard as fuck and the class balance is out the window. But it certainly has a charm to it that just hits that role playing sweet spot."
ElderScrolls,3at70b,mishugashu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:37:41 2015 UTC,Next rainy Sunday I'll get really stoned and keep that in mind ;)  What do you mean by class balance? No Magic utility? I'm guessing pretty much same thing goes for Daggerfall?
ElderScrolls,3at70b,Calypse27,3,Tue Jun 23 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"The Stealth/Theif/Acrobat type classes are totaly shit. It's the Legendary mode of the game basicaly. One of the pure magic classes can be OP but I don't remember which I think it was Sorcerer, the rest are not mana efficient enough to get good spells out often. Also spell casting with the controls as they are is super hard.   I play a Knight. If you wanna get a feel for the game I suggest either playing a Knight or a High Elf. Either combination works but paralysis will get you killed in this game 10/10 times and those two things (Knight or High Elf) have a natural immunity to paralysis.  Also it functions on the old rpg system which means Armor -5 is typically better than Armor -2. It reads in how much damage it's taking away from what's hitting you. Though weapons I believe still function as +5 is better than +2. It's been a while since I played though so you'll just have to use common sense based on the metal types. The UESP wiki is pretty good for figuring it out."
ElderScrolls,3at70b,Calypse27,3,Tue Jun 23 15:03:17 2015 UTC,"Daggerfall is by far my most favourite TES game. Of course, I bought it release day in 1995 and played it well over 3000 hours before Morrowind was even announced.  I even went back to it earlier this year and it's still fun, but I can see how modern gamers wouldn't like it. It's pretty freaking dated. Not just graphically, but gameplay-wise as well.

ElderScrolls,3auxva,Duruza,5,Tue Jun 23 20:20:37 2015 UTC,"Take a look at their Morrowind article:   ""Although the Tribunal was a great influence in politics, Morrowind currently is ruled by King Hlaalu Helseth, from the city of Blacklight."" - Morrowind most certainly isn't ruled ""currently"" be Helseth, nor did he ever rule from Blacklight ""House Hlaalu is the smallest and weakest of the five clans, clinging to Great House status in their ancient capital of Narsis (...)In the Fourth Era House Hlaalu lost its position as a great house"" - this mixes up bits of from the times of Tiber Septim with what we know from Dragonborn ""Redoran towns and strongholds, such as Ald'ruhn, generally have distinctive buildings made from the shells of Emperor Crabs, large creatures who are long extinct."" - as far as we know, Skar was an unique case. ""House Redoran warriors wore a unique heavy plate armor called Bonemold Armor.""  - this makes it seem like no other House used bonemold... ""In Vvardenfell, some of their cities were built in the mountainous regions of Morrowind, near Spoons, where the Ghostgate currently resides."" ""There were also two variants of the chest piece, which included a pauldron armor and guard armor."" some of the town blurbs mention destruction in the Red Year, some don't. the religion part describes the Temple as it was under the Tribunal, with only a token mention of the Reclamations, still has daedra worshippers as the enemy of the Temple and mentions killing people who would consider themselves to be a part of the Nerevarine prophecies as a thing - despite the prophecy already being fulfilled. the Demographics section doesn't take the Red Year into account the ""Appearances"" part makes it seem that we visited Morrowind in Dawnguard...   And I only checked a part of their Tamriel article devoted to the other lands:   To the west of Tamriel lies the sunken continent of Yokuda, from which the people that are now called the Redguards came to take over Hammerfell, in the year 808 of the First Era. The people who became the modern-day Redguards came to Tamriel because the island was completely destroyed, but the cause of it is still being debated. - so, was Yokuda an island or continent? Also, it wasn't completely destroyed. Akavir is home to four major groups: Kamal, Tsaesci, Tang Mo, and Ka Po' Tun. It was once home to the Akaviri, a race of Man and, most notably, the dragons, but the Tsaesci drove the Dragons and Men to extinction, and it is unknown what happened to the Akaviri. - if the ""Akaviri"" were the only race of Man on the continent, how could men be driven to extintion while the fate of the Akaviri is unknown?"

ElderScrolls,3asa9z,TheJiggersUp,7,Wed Jun 24 14:26:01 2015 UTC,"Spend those skill points! It's actually really cheap and easy to respec later if you need to but I wouldn't stress out about it early on the game. When you do decide to respec there's a shrine in the capital of your faction that charges an amount of gold per skill point (it's been awhile so I don't remember how much, it's no more than 100 gold each) But you should just play around with anything you find interesting.   If you decide you don't like a weapon style after awhile you can just switch to something else and even if you respec and decide you want to use it again later you can put points back the way they were before without having to start from the beginning again.  You earn skill points every time you level your character or pvp rank and for every three sky shards you get. Also, you get them the first time you complete a group dungeon and against group bosses in the big public delves. There's over 300 skill points you can get by end game. That's more than enough to just play around with whatever looks interesting.  Every skill can be morphed once and there's 2 options. Sometimes those options can make the ability cost stamina instead of magic and they do various other things. If you don't like your morphs there's a cheaper morph respec shrine next to the other respec shrine I mentioned earlier.  Just a tip, wear at least 1 piece of each type of armor while leveling up. That way you level them all up and later if you want to switch from light to medium you won't need to level up that armor, you'll have it already.  I can help you with any other questions you may have. I've been playing since the game went on sale and have 3 VR14 so feel free to ask."

ElderScrolls,3asa9z,snuggl,2,Tue Jun 23 11:20:36 2015 UTC,They automatically unlock. You can have 1 skill in your bar and it'll level whatever class its in.  Once you get to level 15 you can have a 2nd weapon you can switch to. If you're running around with a destro staff but you feel like you want to run a bow build later you can equip a bow to the 2nd bar and switch to it whenever you turn in a quest. The exp from quest completion will Level up all the abilities you have on that bar. You don't have to use an ability to level it up. If it's on the bar it'll get xp.
ElderScrolls,3asa9z,swollenhubris,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:33:40 2015 UTC,"Dont worry at all about it, just place them whereever, level up as many skills you can and then respec to something viable once you are done leveling the basic levels."

The events happened exactly how the players experienced them or they did not if others want to tell a different story - the main quests being the exceptions. Everything else is open for interpretation.   The Thieves Guild helped you escaped Cidna Mine? Why couldn't tell? You could have been a member of the guild before you got arrested, or maybe a prisoner who was a member helped you escaped and that is why you joined. And who's to say the guild master had to be the LDB - and the Harbinger and the Listener and the Arch-Mage - and not some other person?   Some players joined and some did not. Neither would be wrong within the confines of their story - for as long as the hero does not become Empress or High King that is. The Hero of Daggerfall died, the Neveraine is somewhere, the Hero of Kvatch is supposedly Sheogorath, and the LDB will likely be in Apocrypha.   I refuse to believe that every single Khajiit in Morrowind, Skyrim and Cyrodiil were all born under the same exact cycle of the moons, but I am forced to due to what seems to be conflicting game and lore mechanics.

They are basically just house cats, though it's rumored that they can cast spells. Breeds Pictured  Plus stuff like this and this could happen.   Heck, some of them are basically just Elves with fur-like patterns almost like tattoos on their skin (Ohmes) Or light fur and tails (Ohmes-Rhat). As I understand it, they are just supposed to be sort of rare. An Ohmes Khajiit appears in Infernal City/Lord of Souls. Pretty awesome character.   Her whole family is half the reason I am so eager to see Elswyr. They are just these magnificent pseudo-bandit nomads who offer the protagonists ""Protection"" while they are passing through Northern Elswyr, except it is legitimate protection, not just mob style protection. I seem to recall it being legit like ""Are you forcing us to pay you?"" ""No. But if you don't, you'll probably die. You shouldn't travel alone in these parts.""  Then there is the fact that the Ohmes elf-like Khajiit rides her Sensche brother and when Attrebus asks about this he is told not to be too pushy because it is a sensitive subject.  Then there is the whole fighting style. It talks about them using lances from their mounts.  So yeah. I like the idea of being ambushed by a bunch of lance wielding elf-like and ordinary khajiit riding their giant tiger siblings who are all a part of a nomadic caravan that is led by their house-cat parents.

Your Elsweyr is another person's Valenwood or Black Marsh.  To address your point, though - the world building that Bethesda did with the Elder Scrolls series can lead to dashed expectations. But they also do it to make sure there's always something they can do in future games. Dishonored did this as well, if you played that game. If you read some of the books scattered around Dunwall, they'll mention the other island nations across the world. But that's not part of the game, so why mention it?  I believe they do it because they know they want to make more games in the series, but they don't want people to think they're ""making stuff up."" Gamers tend to be highly suspect of lore content that was not in early versions of the series.  That's the best reason I can think of, and as a game designer I would 100% do the same thing they did for these exact reasons."

ElderScrolls,3alpjm,YouCantTakeThisName,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:40:23 2015 UTC,"That could be interesting, although I'm not sure they could base an entire game off of events just after an extremely important event. I just don't think you could really rival the game that took place a few years before on the timeline.  A few years before a major event would probably be similarly disappointing. I mean, I would love to see Cyrodiil a few years before the Oblivion Crisis or Skyrim a few years before the Civil War, but they would have to end the game before the actual event occurred... which would be kind of anticlimactic.  So I do see what you're getting at but I don't think Bethesda is ever going to go for it."
ElderScrolls,3akv50,Zarphos,10,Sun Jun 21 04:50:59 2015 UTC,"Morrowind moves VERY VERY slowly. Don't expect to be able to kill everything at first. You'll be lucky to kill anything. One of the glories of Morrowind is the way the questline slowly unfolds before you. Both the world and your way of seeing it open like a flower. Don't force it.  Questlines: Main, Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, Thieves Guild. (Note, NO Dark Brotherhood questline.) Morag Tong. One of three Great House factions; House Hlaalu (thief), House Redoran (fighter), House Telvanni (mage). Interestingly, some factions actively work against each other, so while it's possible to join and advance in multiple factions, it might take some tricky juggling to keep everyone happy in them."
ElderScrolls,3akv50,TekaLynn212,8,Sun Jun 21 07:31:03 2015 UTC,"Here is an introduction that I wrote previously.  Morrowind is generally a slower game than latter parts of the TES series, it has the same spirit as relatively old-school RPGs of 1995-2005. You start off fairly weak and won't be able to defeat some enemies at the beginning, not until you level up a bit and get better equipment. The game won't hold your hand and guide you through everything, it also won't prevent you from making mistakes. You will have to read, think for yourself and make decisions that matter.  Do not try to just run through he main questline right from the start. Join some guilds, do side quests, explore and level up a bit. Exploring the world in Morrowind is very rewarding, there is little to no autoleveling so things you can find and encounter will be very diverse.  The lore is very detailed and well integrated into the game. But you won't get spoon-feed with it, you will have to look for things yourself. Read books and pay attention to what other characters are saying.  A bit about mechanics: Fatigue is very important because it affect almost everything you do. Your chances to land a hit during combat and to evade an incoming attack, chance to successfully cast a spell, chances to successfully pick locks and to sneak around, even how well you can barter with NPCs. Try to always enter a fight with a full or near full fatigue.  You can miss your attacks during combat. Chance to hit depends on your skill level with the weapon you are using, your fatigue, agility and luck attributes. Weapon skill and fatigue have the largest impact. Try to only use weapon type your character is skilled with until you get stronger. Getting at least one weapon type into your primary skills during character creation is usually a good idea.  If you want to play as a mage, then also check these two relevant comments.  If you got the game with Tribunal and Bloodmoon expansions, installing them right away is usually a good idea (they are required by many mods). But they introduce some irritating issues that can lessen your enjoyment/immersion, so you will have to either disable them before starting a new game or use mods to fix those issues. You can disable them from the Data Files option in the autorun/launcher menu. Enabling them at a later point, when you are ready to play their content, should not cause any issues. If you chose the mod route, then the mods you need are Delayed Dark Brotherhood Attack and Illy's Solstheim Rumor Fix.  If you want more information/tips, then you can also check comments in the following threads: http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/2nuzq6/just_started_morrowindsome_tips/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/2neh62/thinking_about_getting_morrowind_tips_for_a_new/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/2lhe4j/wish_me_luck/  Regarding mods: Morrowind Code Patch is very useful, almost a necessity. Morrowind Patch Project is also quite useful. It fixes a lot of bugs and oversights, but most of them are fairly minor, so I wouldn't call it crucial. Delayed Dark Brotherhood Attack and Illy's Solstheim Rumor Fix are fixing some problems that are introduced into the game with the expansions.  Before installing any graphics mods you should start the game and play for a bit to see if you are fine with its base look. If yes, then I would suggest playing without such mods during your first playthrough. Although, even in this case you still may want to get Morrowind Graphics Extender XE to add support for widescreen resolutions into the game. If you do want to mod graphics after all, then you can get Morrowind Overhaul (aka MGSO). It is a compilation of various mods and tools packaged together. In this case you should probably also check this page for some additional information.  Regarding weapon miss chance and randomness: I would strongly advise you to not use the mod that prevents your attacks from missing. It makes a whole bunch of skills, spells and game mechanics useless. And it's not like those attacks are missing simply because of bad luck, there is a complex and well thought out mechanics behind it.  Btw, the same is also true for other dice roll type mechanics in the game. There is an element of randomness in many cases, but it is only one of many influences. Results mostly depend on a behind the scene calculation that takes several factors into the account and determines if you succeed or not.  And lastly, here is one comment by another user that I very much agree with:     Mods aren't my area of expertise, but as for playing the game, just enjoy it. Create a character that you like, because you're going to be spending a LOT of time on him/her. Don't abuse bugs or unfair game mechanics because it will make the experience feel cheap and you'll get bored quickly. The journey is better than the destination, so just have fun. You don't have to rush the main quest! Join guilds, join a great house, do quests, and basically anything you want. This game is amazing and has stood the test of time, so absorb the experience and have fun with it! That's what games are for, after all."
ElderScrolls,3akv50,MyrMindservant,2,Sun Jun 21 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, that was informative. Thanks! I do have the expansions, but I wanna try without those ""fixes""."
ElderScrolls,3akv50,MyrMindservant,3,Sun Jun 21 16:44:51 2015 UTC,"They are not ""fixes"", they provide objective improvements.  Delayed Dark Brotherhood Attack is a fix for Tribunal. With the expansion installed and activated there is a high chance that assassins would attack you during sleep. It will continue to happen again and again every time you try to rest until you initiate the Tribunal storyline. Those attacks will start right from the beginning. This is bad from both story and gameplay perspectives. Tribunal is a continuation of the main game's storyline and you are not supposed to play it before you finish Morrowind at least once. Form the gameplay point of view, these attacks will either make your life hell or ruin the balance of early stages of the game. What Delayed Dark Brotherhood Attack does is postpones those attacks until you have progressed the game significantly enough. This is something that should have been done by developers themselves, but they didn't bother to add proper checks to their script.  Illy's Solstheim Rumor Fix is a fix for Bloodmoon. Just like with the first expansion, developers have added a trail that should lead you to the new content but they didn't bother to limit it properly. In this case almost every single NPC in the game will talk about Solstheim, location of Bloodmoon expansion. It makes no sense whatsoever and ruins immersion. Solstheim Rumor Fix deals with this by limiting relevant conversation to the NPCs that could realistically know that information."
ElderScrolls,3akv50,MyrMindservant,3,Sun Jun 21 21:25:59 2015 UTC,"I see what you meant about the assassins. Go to sleep in the Southwall corner club. ""You are awoken by a loud noise"" go out the door, assassin. Kill him, got to sleep. ""You are awoken by a loud noise"" another assassin. I'm kind of glad, though. because selling their armor gave me enough $$$ to get a full set of chitin armor."
ElderScrolls,3akv50,ProfessionalWingman,2,Mon Jun 22 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"And that is exactly what I meant by ""ruin the balance of early stages of the game"". Their armor is way too good and sells for way too much money compared to how early and easily you can get it. This ruins your natural early game progression by giving you lots of stuff without you putting sufficient effort into it."

You can tell, however, that you aren't supposed to be there as textures become pretty low res and obvious.  That being said, I haven't really gone ""mountain climbing"" in a very long time, so I can't say for certain the places I used to go up are even still accessible.  It's nowhere near what any of the other games are, though.  Low res textures with non-detailed peaks don't happen an any other TES game."

Imagine if Fallout Shelter was announced and released without the announcement for Fallout 4... yeah, it'd be a total train wreck.  Fallout Shelter is probably among (in my opinion) the top 5 most in-depth iOS games I could think of off the top of my head (I'm not big on mobile gaming in general, though).  I'm rather optimistic about Legends. The trailer was really stupid and told absolutely ZERO things about the game, but who knows? I have faith that Dire Wolf Digital will do a decent job, and that Bethesda knows what they're doing as far as management goes.  I want TES 6 just as much as anyone else, but a little wait can't hurt anyone :)"

Here we are:  Oblivion Character Overhaul v2  Yeah, if you don't want to be terrified by the horrible potato faces in this game, definitely go for this mod. Instead of everyone having round, crappy looking faces regardless of their race, it adds custom head models and textures, dependent on race. For example, Dunmer have pointier features to make them look like actual Dark Elves.  Before and after pics!  DarNified UI  So, the vanilla UI in Oblivion is complete and utter shit, I don't think anyone disagrees. This mod makes it more friendly for PC users, letting you see more of what you're carrying at a time, and also allowing you to edit your HUD, placing things where you want to. It's pretty cool.  Combat Stance Reanimation  This mod is a little bit underrated, I think. Some of the player animations in Oblivion aren't very good, or are kind of awkward. This just fixes that, makes your character look a little more confident, I guess.  Anyways, why only 4 mods?"
ElderScrolls,3ahbh1,rct3fan24,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"I just want to keep mods to a minimum, because the more I look at mods, the more mods I end up throwing in there, and it can get laggy and weird sometimes.  The last time I played, for example, I had like 25 mods running. I might do more than 4, but probably not more than 10.  I added OCO, and I put OBSE and DUI on there by default, because as you mentioned, the default UI sucks and DarN is a god. I don't count his UI as a mod because it's how it should have been. (His version for Skyrim is even better)  I'll check out Combat Stance. I'm going to add Oblivion Reloaded also, because it totally smooths everything out and makes the game a hell of a lot prettier for basically no cost."

Second, your idea of publishing an unfinished game and selling expansions later to fill the gaps is really stupid, they are not Ubisoft or EA games.  Third, multiplayer TES? Sorry, but if you want a multiplayer TES game go play ESO or wait for modders to make mp mods. (One is being made for Skyrim at the moment.)  And ESO (And TES:L if I recall correctly) aren't made by Bethesda Game Studios.   The idea that they keep updating the game is good ofcourse. But that's already happening. Skyrim was buggy and left a lot out because they had to have the 11.11.11 release date. They just didn't have more time.  But releasing a TES game and NOT letting you in a major guild, which has been part of the game since ever, before you pay another €10? I think that would create more hate than love."

ElderScrolls,3al8tp,xTyrantRavex,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:38:06 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that you're making it sound more like an EA/Activision published game than anything else.   Content from Skyrim was panned, sure, but still with 100's of hours of gameplay in the form of questing and exploration to delve into. Sure, the DLC wasn't always the greatest (I do enjoy the Dragonborn DLC a lot, though), but it added a whole new area to explore with what I think was a particularly interesting and fun main quest line.   To try to model Bethesda Game Studio's games after the Bungie model with Destiny is cash grabbing (though you can argue that Activision is primarily the one to blame). Destiny had a lack of storytelling for a great story that was hidden in the Grimoire cards, which are a fantastic read but OUTSIDE of the game. That's their first mistake. The areas you can go to end up becoming quite dull when you're doing the same patrol missions over and over. There's no variety, and no really substance to what you're trying to do for the Tower. Vanilla Destiny felt very shallow. I have poured many days into it, admittedly. It's a very addicting game in the swing of things. However, it lacked so much content that /r/destinythegame made it the center of attention numerous times, especially with the newest DLC on the way.  On top of that, to say that Bethesda should follow suit, cut content from their games, and release it as DLC is a HUGE mistake. Will people buy it? Unfortunately, yes, but I can guarantee that they would lose a good chunk of their fan base."

What did you like about Skyrim in comparison to those other games?  Morrowind is much less of an action game than Skyrim, and more of a dice-rolling RPG. Is that something that appeals to you?"
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,jmelesky,7,Thu Jun 18 19:22:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, OP didn't give us enough information. Has OP played other old games that require more patience? I would say MW would appeal more to fans of tabletop D&D style games from years ago than to fans of fast paced action-RPGs. The only difference is that you get a visual / digital representation of the world you're playing in, and Bethesda is your dungeon master.  To enjoy the game you have to get used to the fact that at level 1 you'll only land a dagger attack on that scrib once out of ten stabs. You'll be walking around quite a lot, and will have to make good use of the map. You have to dig deeper into conversations with NPCs as almost nobody will simply point you to an objective and say ""go there."" There are books - worth of written dialog versus quick snippets of voiced dialog.  If OP has the patience, MW is one of the most rewarding gaming experiences anyone can come across. With slight mods, the visuals can be updated a bit, and some of the little annoyances can be smoothed out, but if anyone needs heavy modding to enjoy the game, then it's just not for them. And honestly, to me that's no biggie. I absolutely love the game, but some people have difference tastes and that's okay. Either way, I find MW is either ""love it"" for people with the patience who don't mind the now-dated graphics and gameplay mechanics, or ""hate it"" for people who like a smoother gameplay experience. It's hard to find someone in the ""middle ground"" in terms of liking MW."

ElderScrolls,3abgpd,ScottyBeans,12,Thu Jun 18 19:53:48 2015 UTC,"As far as the lore is concerned, it's got a lot of good material. Game mechanics are a product of their time and do not necessarily hold up today. For instance, when you swing a sword and the model goes through the enemy, yet the game registers a miss. That makes combat feel ephemeral. Other aspects like the magic and enchanting were much more complex and comprehensive than in Oblivion or Skyrim, which is usually seen as a good thing. The factions were much better than in Skyrim (No welcome to orientation...Archmage type stuff)."
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,fumkypunpkin_,27,Thu Jun 18 19:23:46 2015 UTC,"Morrowind is beautiful. Not graphically but in an aesthetic quality that will also let Skyrim transcend limits of graphics. Its landscapes are unique and alien while maintaining a realism that keeps you hooked.   The culture of the locals is a complex mix of Chinese, Nomadic, Some American and African cultures. With the geography of the region affecting it also. The people are xenophobic and always give you the impression that you will never be accepted, that you will always be a wanderer.    The factions are cruel and selfish, they have grown cynical along its people. The gods are present but mostly are apathetic, making you feel alone in a crowd of people.   Yet there is hope in the music, some of the people and in the sunshine that comes when you clear an Ashstorm.    It is a great experience with deep alchemy, magic and lore. Although the combat is shit until level 6, from then on its ok."

It's a game you have to jump into feet first. Doesn't explain a lot or have quest markers. You have to pay attention to dialogue and directions.  It's not a game you can just play through. I really like the change of pace from game I been recently playing.   So yay.
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,UnionizedChemist,8,Thu Jun 18 20:50:42 2015 UTC,The biggest hurdle for ppl and morrowind is you have to READ A LOT AND KEEP IN MIND EVEYTHING YOU READ. It quest giver A tell your to go to location B to find npc C you need to keep in mind the places name and the person's name and the directions on how to get there. Every part of the map has its own lore and you need to stay informed or you literally won't be able to find your objective  But this all adds to the feel of the game. Its a big time investment. But it's worth it if that appeals to you and you from mind clunky combat.

Morrowind does not have good combat, there is no fast travel and it is much more complex but because the game is much more complex, the factions are much more deep and there is a lack of hand holding the game is in many ways more immersive.  You feel confused about names and places, you can spend an hour looking for some place you need to go because the directions were vague, the people you meet have strange foreign customs but as you play you start to get it, you feel like you grow with your character.    It's not for everyone but I pick it up again every once and a while and enjoy the depth of it.  If you like the political intrigue, factions and story of skyrim play morrowind.  If you enjoy the combat and walking around like a badass, don't, you'll be disappointed."

It's just a huge open world Jurassic Park. Not so appealing..  Edit 2: I'm kind of conflicted because I play Morrowind and love it, but also bash it."

ElderScrolls,3abgpd,Mr_Flippers,2,Tue Jun 23 00:01:18 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend it, particularly at Summer Sale pricing.  I never played any Elder Scrolls game before starting recently with Morrowind. It is an old game, but it also has some very clever features you probably never knew you missed in every other game that doesn't have them. It is dated, but still a very good game, with a depth that is rarely seen in modern titles. And it is just as much a classic within the ES series, and among RPGs generally, as when it was released."
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,waktivist,2,Thu Jun 18 20:59:03 2015 UTC,"If you like lore and some more context to a few things like the dragonborn expansion, then it might be worth it. If you're going for gameplay? It's broken and kinda clunky, not even taking the old graphics into account."
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,comkiller,7,Thu Jun 18 21:17:13 2015 UTC,"Honest opinion from a 32-year-old full-time working married life-long gamer who started on Elder Scrolls with Skyrim:  Nay.  It is really tough to go back to those old graphics, super slow pacing, antiquated combat, reading a lot of text (rather than spoken dialogue), little guidance or waypoints, etc.   That being said, I completely respect the quality of storytelling in this game. If I had played this on PC when it was released, I would have loved it. It was a bench mark game, to be sure. If you had the time and patience to put up with the things I've mentioned above, then go for it.  But by today's standards, there are much better games out there to spend your life's hours with."
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,Toast_One_Seven,3,Thu Jun 18 23:36:45 2015 UTC,"This is an important factor.

However, if you have the time and energy to be immersed in it then it's an absolute yay. Unfortunately, OP didn't give us any background info"
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,Mr_Flippers,5,Fri Jun 19 04:47:05 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly play Oblivion before you play Morrowind. I don't think you'll appreciate Morrowind just jumping into a game from 13 years ago. It's fairly clunky (by today's standards). But most of that clunkiness is due to the fact that it's more of a roll-playing (yeah, I mean roll-playing.... not role-playing) game, D&D style. There's all sorts of dice rolling under the covers. And Oblivion is a pretty good harmony between Skyrim's action adventure style, and Morrowind's old fashioned RPG goodness.  But, Morrowind still fucking rocks. As does Daggerfall. I've played both this year and enjoyed myself entirely in both. It's been a couple years since I've played Oblivion, but I loved that too. They're still all amazing games. I'd skip Arena, though."
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,mishugashu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:49:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe if started on Skyrim only, but I think Oblivion should be skipped and just go on with Morrowind. No point in ""regressing"" twice with tons of hours put into two games."

For example, when hitting someone with a spell or attack, it doesnt matter if you actually are aiming at them or not, because if your weapon skill isnt leveled enough, youll actually miss them. A lot too.  Also no minimap or organised quest log. So you must read every single journal entry and quest you get and actually take directions which can often be confusing and tedious.  Dont get me wrong i loved the game and its a huge part of my childhood. but if you started at skyrim id maybe go to oblivion first."
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,JoEyyB,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:05:32 2015 UTC,"Morrowind has a lot more chance factor when it comes to conversation with NPCs. There's also a LOT more options for skills, weapons and armors. There are no ""level up perks.""  On the plus side, the quests are a ton of fun and many of the NPCs are quite entertaining. You could create your own scrolls as well as items and spells. There are spells that are not in Oblivion and Skyrim.  I'd give it a few hours to try it out."
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,ZE_LUMIS,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:23:45 2015 UTC,"It's quite different than Skyrim. Almost different in every way. Morrowind is very classic RPG, while Skyrim is action RPG. Morrowind has a much harder learning curve compared to Skyrim. You won't be told how to do much at the start, you'll have to talk to people, and experiment.    I first played Morrowind about 2 years ago and it's now my all time favorite game, so I love to see people giving it a go.    I say try it, especially if it's on sale. Get lost in that huge, alien world. If you give it some patience and keep an open mind, you will get one of the best, most lovingly made RPG games of all time."

ElderScrolls,3abgpd,MarshManOriginal,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:02:43 2015 UTC,"Well, the general thought is that it's still a great game and has aged well. Except, that always comes from people who played it around the time it came out.  Honestly, it has aged pretty poorly. Graphically, it looks like shit. But usually you can get over that. However, the main problem is the combat. If you try and attack, but your skill isn't high enough, you'll just miss. It's infuriating since you can't hit anything early on, not even the really weak worm enemies. SO it takes ages to actually fight anything, and more often than not you'll die just because you can't actually hit.  You're basically railroaded until you manage to grind up your skill in a weapon, which is horrible.  Honestly, unless you find a lot of good mods to fix the broken combat, avoid it."
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,jmelesky,2,Fri Jun 19 01:14:07 2015 UTC,"Except, that always comes from people who played it around the time it came out.   There seem to be a bunch of people in this comment stream who played MW only after Skyrim, so I'm not sure you're right, there.   It's infuriating since you can't hit anything early on, not even the really weak worm enemies   If you've set a weapon skill as one of your class skills, and you're using a weapon from that group, you should hit low-level enemies more often than not. Maybe you were running around and your fatigue was low? If your fatigue is low, you can't do anything well."
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,MarshManOriginal,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:03:58 2015 UTC,"Except even if you do that, it's still impossible to hit anything with that weapon.  It's just an overall terrible mechanic."
ElderScrolls,3abgpd,jmelesky,2,Fri Jun 19 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"Except even if you do that, it's still impossible to hit anything with that weapon   Well, let's stat this out, then. A redguard warrior with the warrior birthsign, using an iron longsword.   Long blades skill: 30 (major class skill) + 15 (redguard bonus) = 45 Agility: 40 (redguard) Luck: 40 (redguard) Fortify Attack: 10 (warrior birthsign) fatigue percentage: 1.0 (assuming you're ready for the fight)   Chance to hit: (Weapon Skill + (Agility / 5) + (Luck / 10)) * (0.75 + 0.5 * Fatigue Percentage) + Fortify Attack Magnitude  (45 + (40 / 5) + (40 / 10)) * (0.75 + 0.5 * 1.0) + 10 = 57 * 1.25 + 10 = 81.25  So your base chance to hit is 81.25. You could get this higher by choosing a class that gives you a higher agility or luck, but this is pretty high for a purpose-built but not optimized starting character.  Now actually hitting it is modified by the kwama forager's evasion:  ((Agility / 5) + (Luck / 10)) * (0.75 + 0.5 * Fatigue Percentage)  Agility and Luck default to 40.  ((40 / 5) + (40 / 10)) * (0.75 + 0.5 * 1.0) = 12 * 1.25 = 16  So your final likelihood of hitting is: 81.25 - 16, or 65.25.  In other words, if you're not fatigued, and you're using an appropriate weapon, you should hit low-level enemies more often than not."

But in general oblivion was just lazy. They didn't even craft their own dungeons for fuck's sake. Leveling didn't mean shit either because they'd just spawn shit that was your level.

ElderScrolls,3abgpd,prowlinghazard,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:14:27 2015 UTC,"Morrowind is very different from Skyrim. The game focuses a lot more on the leveling system and how you level up your character and what attributes you take. What level your skills are at is very important.  Attacks have a chance to miss, spells have a chance to fail based on armor. Health and Magika don't regenerate naturally, you have to rest.   The differences between Morrowind and Skyrim could fill volumes. At this point the game feels fairly dated and the gameplay wouldn't appeal to today's ""instant gratification"" players. The game requires patience, planning, and more of a sense of adventure and discovery than Skyrim. The game is less about ""go here and do the thing"" and more about immersing yourself in the game. It's less combat oriented and more story/dialogue/immersion oriented.   For $10 you can do worse, but with the steam sale you can do a whole lot better too. I'd say if you were looking to play Morrowind, go ahead and pick up Oblivion and then install the Moroblivion mod. Some dudes remade Morrowind in the Oblivion engine. Oblivion is a decent middle ground between Skyrim and Morrowind and is probably my favorite of the series. I generally don't recommend someone who's only played Skyrim to get Morrowind. They just won't have the patience for it."

ElderScrolls,3abgpd,_Ralchire,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:25:36 2015 UTC,"I enjoy all three of the recent games since Morrowind, but Morrowind, in my opinion, is not as much of a ""video game"" when compared to Oblivion or Skyrim. I started with Skyrim as well and worked my way backwards, so maybe I'm some sort of filthy casual or something.  Let me explain. Morrowind's gameplay is the least appealing aspect for me. Combat is wonky, quest directions are often vague, and there are cliff racers. Imagine dragons from Skyrim but less powerful and 100 times more common to stumble upon while you're adventuring. It's more of a ""hardcore"" game, and by that I mean it's not very user-friendly. There's no fast travel aside from silt strider ports (which I actually find to be a good thing), no quest markers, and no health/magicka regen (you have to rest for it to be restored).  I'm not a graphics-oriented gamer (running a dated rig as is) so the only bad thing I can say about Morrowind's graphics are the character models. Not only are their faces super ugly, the bodies themselves are cut into segments so that each limb is a different object. Often, you'll get meshes clipping through each other. There are some mods to fix this, and I find it is almost necessary to have when you create your character. For someone who needs good graphics, there are some mods to fix that as well.  That said, Morrowind's narrative is excellent. The lore is very closely tied to its story; the first half of the main quest is all about finding out the backstory on certain areas and reporting that info to your quest giver. You get to learn about the rich world and eventually become a really awesome hero. It's not like Skyrim, though, where you're born with it. No, you have to BECOME the hero.  If you took an interest in the Dwemer in Skyrim, you'll be happy to know that there are even more tidbits of information about the Dwemer in Morrowind. Granted, these tidbits often conflict with one another and in the end it doesn't settle much, but there are some cool things about them anyway. I mean, there are Dwemer ghosts and Dwemer statues! You'll know what they look like!  Without spoiling anything, you'll be able to learn of a complex religious conflict rooted in mystery and treachery. You'll crumble the very gods of this land and bring them to mortality once again. You'll learn of the three Great Houses of Morrowind and how they relate to one another; what makes each different and what makes each right and/or wrong. Morrowind delivers narrative much better than Skyrim did. Then again, LOTS of reading and not really any significant voice acting--NPCs say random junk, sure, but dialog is just a wall of text at times."

It's still unlikely that Bethesda will ever remaster any of their older TES games, but Shadowkey was definitely the most fun out of the three ""Travels"" mobile games (it was also the longest of the three, despite still being a short game).  Shadowkey would probably also be the most relevant one, considering the fascinating concept that is Shadow Magic, which has a chance of returning in a TES based in Hammerfell.

Witcher 3 has been fun so far.   I see you don't mention Skyrim? Also ESO is surprisingly detailed, but MMOs are a different story.   Final Fantasies are fun.   Dragon Age or Mass Effect were both pretty fun. (I recommend starting with 2 or beyond though, the first in each series were kind of stale.)  Star Ocean was pretty cool.   None of these games really compare to TES, but they will definitely entertain you! The closest are probably Skyrim or Fallout (since they are the same maker)."
ElderScrolls,3aakhi,kangaesugi,3,Thu Jun 18 16:38:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel like the original Dragon Age was the high point of the series. Mechanically speaking it was an awkward game, but I preferred the dialogue system before it went Fantasy Mass Effect (i love Mass Effect, but it feels like they're converging too much rather than being different series) and there seems to be much less ""dark fantasy"" stuff nowadays.  Granted still play both series, and ESO if you're down with multiplayer."
ElderScrolls,3aakhi,Calypse27,2,Thu Jun 18 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, the first one was it's own game. I have yet to play the new one, and even though I did like the 2nd one better from a combat point of view, the choices and story didn't feel as organic as the first. The first one had me stuck at quite a few places though, just like the first Mass Effect."

ElderScrolls,3aakhi,theVril,8,Thu Jun 18 16:24:10 2015 UTC,"I know it's Sci fi and not fantasy... But mass effect! Seriously! The thought put behind it - histories of various species and cultures, the different races, the way biotics (equivalent of ""magic"" in the fantasy setting) work, etc - rival some of the deepest Sci fi series around, including star wars and star trek.   The degree of freedom is narrowed in terms of your character and his / her journey (the quests and the order you complete them). However, your choices during these quests or with other characters in the world, and the decisions you make in terms of even seemingly small choices and dialog trees resonate throughout the game world so much more strongly than in any TES game. Your decisions shape the world in much more meaningful ways that even persist game to game.   Even if you're not big on Sci fi, if you appreciate the breadth of the lore offered in TES you'll love ME. Any rpg fan will love how the game recognizes your role in the universe more than just ""you're the hero of kvatch!"" in one sentence, then ""keep your hands to yourself sneak thief!"" in the next. Okay well those two lines are from different games but you get the idea."

I dont see most of the fans' problems with it."
ElderScrolls,3a8w4t,Dooflatchie,-3,Thu Jun 18 14:11:18 2015 UTC,"Well here are my problems with it if you're curious.    For one, it's not very Elder Scrollsy- there's no real freedom beyond the creation of your character.  You go from zone to zone and quest to quest in a predetermined manner rather than as you like.  Two, the world doesn't feel alive.  NPCs are very static and stand around in the same places day and night.  Not only that but you can't really interact with them in any meaningful way.  Three, you have no way of playing your character the way you want like in real ES games.  You can't be an evil villain or a pacifist or anything like that.  Hell, you can't even be a necromancer.  The story is a mess.  Everyone you meet is ""The Chosen One"" just like you.  The alliances make no sense (Argonians and Dark Elves working together), the half-assed plot that is basically Oblivion's story but with a different Prince.  Finally, the way they charged a sub for PC players for the game which was unfinished.  We basically paid to beta-test it, which is shameful.  And now that it has gone buy-to-play, the updates are almost assuredly going to revolve around releasing items for their crown store."
ElderScrolls,3a8w4t,jmelesky,5,Thu Jun 18 14:30:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of people seem to have the misconception that ESO is skyrim with other people. There are a lot more aspect in an MMO that you have to consider that wouldn't even be there in the first place if you were making skyrim with other people including the fact that a level 50 player could be doing quests in the starting area. The NPCs don't feel alive because if they implemented RadiantAI, the game would be laggy as hell. Its the fact that another couple thousand people playing with you at the same time on the same server, even if there are different instances, would take a lot of processing power from the part of your computer, the internet connection and the servers. I can barely run it on medium graphics and i like to think i have a pretty decent computer. Again, I have to bring my argument from the first one, its an MMO, there has to be sacrifices made for the enjoyment of large groups compared to your enjoyment, and i have to say that they have done it pretty well. You can't be a necromancer, but that makes sense lore-wise as why would anyone help a possible follower of Mannimarco and the Worm Cult. Maybe they will add it later, they said there is still content coming. I haven't played the story to the end, so I cant exactly judge on that, but from what i've seen from both of the games' plots, in Oblivion, you are chosen randomly, in ESO, you don't have a soul, so you have a legitimate reason to help the Prophet and his friends. It also helps that no necromancers can kill you, and since your antagonist IS a necromancer, that would help immensely. The different alliances make sense from a lore perspective. The alliance with the dark elves and argonians is VERY unstable, if you were to read any books, you would see that some argonians are straight up protesting it. But the smarter ones realize that it has to be done to keep from even more races from enslaving them. All of the other alliances make sense as they existed before. They chargED, its in the past. They realized that they had made a mistake and changed it to b2p. Have you seen the E3 video? They are planning an immense amount for this game, and I would prefer for them to keep updating this than to wait another 4 years for a single player TES game. There are going to be updates to the Crown Store, BUT they are also going to release a lot of new things, and its not like its going to be b2w, its just appearance - accessories."
ElderScrolls,3a8w4t,Bellotor,2,Thu Jun 18 15:17:26 2015 UTC,"I can barely run it on medium graphics and i like to think i have a pretty decent computer.   Same :/   It's sooooo pretty with ""ultra-high"" level graphics. It's just too laggy for me."
ElderScrolls,3a8w4t,dumppee,2,Fri Jun 19 04:13:22 2015 UTC,"Correct.  People expected a multiplayer Elder Scrolls game.  Not Dark Age of Camelot 2.  Not unreasonable and there's no reason it couldn't have been just that.  They decided to make another run-of-the-mill MMO instead of something special and new. I don't think either of us are qualified to comment on the technical aspect of what could and could not be done.  I do know that I have played other MMOs where the NPCs and cities felt much more organic. The Elder Scrolls has been about freedom first and foremost.  They took a lot of aspects of freedom and choice away not because they had to, but because they wanted to.  It was a design choice meant to keep things in line with the other stale MMOs on the market.  Period. I've played the story to the end.  Daedra prince invades Tamriel and uses rifts/portals/etc in order to launch the invasion.  It's been done.  Period. Yes, they charged.  For an incomplete product.  And now that they're ready to roll out a (somewhat) complete product they've stopped charging.  That means that in the past, people were paying more for less.  Awful."
ElderScrolls,3a8w4t,CharlieLove,2,Thu Jun 18 15:42:57 2015 UTC,"There is a perfectly understandable reason. Bethesda need to expand to new mediums of entertainment. For example, if the would have just made it Skyrim with other people, and I was a major MMO player, I wouldn't even take a second glance at the game. But they made ESO, so I, the MMO loving person would, of course, check it out. If I were to like it, I would probably get into the other TES games. This not only expands their abilities so that people can see that they can produce more that a single-player rpg, but also increases their popularity. Exactly. If they don't feel organic in every MMO, and its apparently ""another run-of-the-mill MMO"" according to you, then why would you expect organic NPCs and cities? You even say it in your previous point, ""I don't think either of us are qualified to comment on the technical aspect of what could and could not be done"". You make the statement like you work in Bethesda and know what they are doing.  Well you clearly haven't payed any attention to the story because if you did, you would realize that molag bal is trying to combine the two worlds (Coldharbour and Nirn) together, so that the destruction he inflicts on Coldharbor would affect Nirn and over time, destroy it. Since they are trying to be a run-of-the-mill MMO, then of course they would have had to implement subscriptions. But then they realized that they were asking for two much since the people playing would probably consist of 50% elder scrolls fans, who are used to paying once, and playing the game forever, so they made the game buy-to-play."

So I helped it do well, but I also know that it's definitely not good.  So, I'm very much not at all excited for TESL.  Also, what does a fantasy card game (that doesn't make sense in world in the slightest) have to do with TES?  Like, TES is not some generic fantasy property that one company owns that they use to compete with another.  Like, TES only exists as a fantasy property because of a few very good, specific games.  Warcraft is a cross-genre property, starting as strategy, branching out.  It has always been cartoony.  TES is TES because it's TES, and using it for this purpose - it's not even original!  The idea of a fantasy card game is a cheap cash-in on someone else's idea.  ESO, btw, has not done ""extremely well"".  In any event, TES is a specific franchise, not some generic property to be whored out.  By whoring it out, they're making me lose interest in it.    I mean, when TES6, 5-7 years from now, comes out, is it going to be another original TES game, or is it going to just copy from Witcher 5?  Is it just going to be another cash-in on someone else's idea by apply this patina of a fantasy realm on top of it?  TESL is honestly a joke, and furthermore an insult to fans."
ElderScrolls,3a8w4t,Mr_Mimiseku,0,Sun Jun 21 05:20:44 2015 UTC,"ESO makes me exited for TESL because they did a good job expanding to a new medium with ESO and I think that they will do a good job for TESL  I have to repeat this to everyone by now, but before you say ""Eww, ESO sucks"", at least try to make an attempt at explaining WHY. If you want my opinion on why ESO is a good game, go to this thread on the exact same page.  Why would it try to make sense in the world? It is a seperate card game from the games, and they probably won't be adding it to the next TES game. They do not compete with other companies, they tryy to get a bigger followinf of fans for their games, like any company that hopes to be profitable should.  TES exists because in EVERY game, you can see the amount of love and enthusiasm has been put into producing it. Don't try to tell me that they haven't put effort into ESO, because then you have not played any part of the game.  Do you seriously think that Hearthstone is the first card game to do what it did? I do not play any of the WoW games, but I love Hearthstone. Hearthstone copied it from another card game, and that game copied from another, and it goes back to the original, physical cards e.g. blackjack. If they manage to make it work well  and put a lot of effort into TESL, which Bethesda has been known to do with all of their games, then they will make an amazing card game, just like Blizzard before them.  Where does it say that TES is a specific franchise. Bethesda are exploring new mediums to get a bigger fanbase to play their games. And how exactly does whoring out make you disinterested in the games, when you could just stick to playing the single-player rpgs, that, I will admit, are better than ESO, but at least ESO tries to do somehting new as opposed to making another single-player rpg. People would love it, but without new things, eventually, people will get tired of it.  The TES game revolutionized the RPG, and I would say that most RPG games today are going along the formula of Skyrim, and I think Bethesda isn't blind, and will eventually make another single-player rpg, but is that so bad? This will be the, what? 10th game in the franchise? And people will still buy it and love it, just like they did with Skyrim, and the previous games.  And how is TESL and insult to the fans? Its just a card game. Would you rather wait those 5-7 years for ESVI, or prefer updates to ESO and TESL?"
ElderScrolls,3a8w4t,JingleJangleJin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:51:52 2015 UTC,"I read your other thread.  ESO was expected to be a multiplayer Skyrim in a certain sense: that it feels like an Elder Scrolls game.  A characteristic of Elder Scrolls game is near complete freedom in a world that keeps on going with you there or not.  ESO is almost the opposite of that.  They have tried to superficially make ESO appear to be different with legendary armor forges you can discover and concessions to free roaming like skipping starter islands - but still, you mostly go through the sequences one at a time, hearing the story in a linear theme-park fashion, leveling up until you're ready for the next zone.  It's not a bad MMO!  But, it's not incredibly unique - though it's a little unique.  But it's a bad Elder Scrolls game.  It's not enough ""Elder Scrolls"" to make Elder Scrolls players that don't like MMO's to play an MMO.  What it and Legends are doing is creating a larger and more influential TES fancies that is comprised of MMO fans.  This means a TES6 that caters to this type of player, potentially, which means that the ""old"" TES formula which we so adore may be dying.  That's why we're upset.  Maybe someone will come up with a suitable replacement.  Even so, consider games like Witcher, which are compared to ""Skyrim"" but nothing like it.  There's just a certain freedom and depth to Skyrim that don't exist in Witcher and Dragon Age.  A grit.  I don't know.  I don't want TES to become Warcraft Beta.  It's made money because of the format, not the property.  They need to figure that out."
ElderScrolls,3a8w4t,SargeantSasquatch,2,Sun Jun 21 08:02:59 2015 UTC,"You bring up some good points, at least more than any other person on this thread, but I do have some problems:   For a franchise like WoW, there are, as far as I know, 3 types of people. People that play the MMO, people that play Hearthstone, and people that play both. I have a feeling that that is what Bethesda is trying to do. Zenimax could cater towards the MMO-Cardgame crowd of TES fans, while Bethesda Game Studios caters towards the people who like the single-player RPGs and the quality of Bethesda's work. I am, for example, a fan of both. I don't know how much people had the same experience, but I had never played an MMO for more than 6 hours total before. Maybe because its the fact that I am more of a lore-junkie than a gamer, but I am really enjoying the main story, the Alliance story, which many would consider as the main story, with the actual main story being the sub-plot every 5 levels. I have spent 180 hours in ESO, but then again, its nothing compared to Skyrim's 220 hours, which also happend to be my first TES game.   Other than that, I really think you make some good points, but I will still be exited about TESL, because my love for this franchise that basically changed my life is too great to be opposed by one possibly-shitty game."
ElderScrolls,3a8w4t,veRxy,2,Sun Jun 21 08:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's business.  There's some demand out there for Hearthstone like games and a lot of people respect TES's fantasy universe.

ElderScrolls,3a8w4t,veRxy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:29:39 2015 UTC,If five years is too long and requires a reboot then you have bigger problems. Fallout 4 is the first game BGS has made since Skyrim but in 2011. Coming out one day short of TESV's four year anniversary. And that began working on F4 when F3 shipped in 2008. So that's what seven years? Tes would never need a reboot because minus small references. None of the relate in so over arch plot.

ElderScrolls,3ab7b3,Onurubu,7,Thu Jun 18 18:07:10 2015 UTC,"What is african pygmes  I dobt think bosmer were inspired by any real world culture. They are the elves from the tales of old.  Orcs can be barbarians, not necessarily mongols, any barbarian tribe, I  ofter see them as german barbarians.  Argonians africans? They are more like mayans or incas.  In the story of the floating city mentions black marsh as having pyramids like the ones found in the great Tenoch.  Havent played TESO though"
ElderScrolls,3ab7b3,lepperandfriends,0,Thu Jun 18 18:20:30 2015 UTC,"Well. I also thought that Orcs can be any barbarian tribe, I picked the mongols purely out of preference. To inform you african pygmies are a ethnic group in africa. They in touch with nature, and live mostly off the land. Bosmer are also very in touch with nature and live off the land. The most unusual thing about the pygmies is that they are unusually short. Their average height is around 140 cm.The bosmer are also the shortest race i the elder scrolls and that is why i picked them.  This next reason applies to both the argonians and bosmer. I chose african because both of these groups face heavy discrimination and are looked down upon. They were both enslaved in the past and taken away by more advanced races. They are still not trusted and a lot of crimes are penned upon them because of prejudice. The argonians are africans for the exact same reason as bosmers. Living close to nature and the discrimination and slavery. They are normal africansand not pygmies though because of their height.  I hope i got my point across better now   Edit spelling"
ElderScrolls,3ab7b3,_Ralchire,2,Thu Jun 18 18:32:21 2015 UTC,"Breton was the name given to the Celts living in Britain . Perhaps with some French influences (petty political strife, French names, skilled chefs and cooks), you'd get the the Bretons of TES.  The Altmer would probably be the Nazis (not exactly a race... Aryans?)  Orcs aren't nomadic, so probably not Mongolian. Perhaps they're like Celts in a way (civilized, but in a different way than the romans thought of the word), but I'd say they're pretty heavily influenced by Germanic tribes.  Argonians are clearly Aztecs/Incas/Mayas, as their structures, sigils, and art style clearly shows in ESO.  Bosmer are probably closer to a perversion of the Native Americans. They place a lot of emphasis on hunting and using all that you can of an animal (and, in this case, your fallen opponent). Perhaps Plains indians in that regard, but living in forests. I can see where you're coming from with the African inspiration, though, with all the cannibalism and such."
ElderScrolls,3ab7b3,zane411,2,Fri Jun 19 22:25:58 2015 UTC,Ok. Those are all sound theories. The only one I disagree with is the altmer. Everybody says they are nazis. They are not performing genocide or even doing explicit evil. They are English because. They live on an island completely separate from the main continent. They believe in the same religion as most of the other races (divines) but slightly differently. This is how England was Christian but Anglican and not catholic I the 16th centur. This slight religious deviation causes a lot of conflict such as the Great War. And like England went to war with the other catholic nations.
ElderScrolls,3ab7b3,zane411,3,Sun Jun 21 13:43:39 2015 UTC,"Bretons - French   More closely related to Celtics. The Breton people in real life were displaced people from Cornwall and Wales, who moved to reside in a fairly small region of france.    Bosmer - African Pygmies   More inspired by the generalized idea of cannibal savages in the jungles, very 'pulp' era inspired   Argonian - African   I really have no idea where you're getting that. They're from a swamp, africa isn't a swamp. Do you mean the slavery thing? lots of races have been slaves. They're more like weird podpeople or something, there's really no precedent for lizardfolk ruled by crazy mindtrees."
ElderScrolls,3ab7b3,zane411,-4,Thu Jun 18 22:24:06 2015 UTC,Well. The bretons could be right from your point of view. I thought of them as french since they are thought to be the most sophisticated and classy race. Their names are also very French sounding. The Bosmer and Argonians I put both as Africans. The area where they live doesnt deterimne the kind of culture they display. They both live very close to nature and live in tune with the animals around them. They both rely heavily on the nature thats why i compared them to african. There is still a lot of racism directed to both races and they are both prejudiced and discriminated against in cities. And both were forced to work in the past. So thats why I said they are both africans. The reason why i specified Pygmies for the bosmer is because of them being the shortest race in ES. And the pygmies are one of the shortest ethnic groups in the world.  Edit spelling
ElderScrolls,3ab7b3,Stereosexual,3,Fri Jun 19 09:32:01 2015 UTC,"A lot of Cannibal Tribal stuff is associated with Amazonian tribes, and I've always had that vibe for the Bosmer."

I basically know every single piece of ES lore and I never heard of that before. Anyway. There are also african cannibalsitic tribes. I actually would have put them as Aztec or Mayan if it wasnt for their height and because of that i am still stickingwith pygmies

To me, classes and levels have no place in a roleplaying game. However, I'm all for having a set of stronger skills at character creation, to represent your past. Attributes also make a lot of sense. In my ideal world, all skills would contribute to character progress, attributes would rise organically as you get better with associated skills, and some perks would be the reward for a quest (to seek some master of the art and gain their trust or whatever, preferably with a skill requisite to start the quest) while some would be gained naturally much like in Oblivion."
ElderScrolls,3a89k1,Octogaunt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:53:52 2015 UTC,"To me, classes represent some past experience of the player character in the skills the class covers. What's more important to me than classes, though, is some encouragement to find a type of weapon or skill you prefer, and get comfortable with the advantages they provide over the other skills/weapons. That means more skills and weapons, more tactical applications to the various weapons, and more incentive to raise certain skills through the perk system I described above. The game doesn't really need classes if it has these, but its still my personal preference. As for attributes, I go to some detail about that in the link I provided, but in short I do agree that they should make a return."

However in my opinion they diminished the importance of magic too much and made it very difficult to play a pure caster. So if you want to get ""into it"", don't play a pure caster and you'll be alright. Really wish they would've kept the Daggerfall's magic system in it."
ElderScrolls,3a63hn,cyro_666,6,Wed Jun 17 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"It's more complicated, less forgiving, and the combat is dull-looking and takes getting used to if you're not accustomed to skill-based hit percentage, but it's got so much more depth and challenge to it as well. Modded, it still looks good and you can tweak gameplay elements to your taste, but it is much slower-paced than Skyrim or Oblivion. You walk slower at the start. and running uses fatigue (and how much fatigue you have affects your chances of success at most every skill so you don't want it to be drained all the time), so the pace of the game is slower. There's no instant fast travel, there's no quest markers, so it's harder to find your quest target and it takes longer to get to them, but I find it rewarding and it really makes the world feel big. Even though it's slightly smaller than Oblivion or Skyrim, it feels bigger because you can't instantly warp to any point on the map. The world doesn't level with you, so you'll sometimes wind up fighting enemies that are way too powerful for you, but I like that about the game. Oblivion and Skyrim kind of feel like the whole world is designed around you, catering to your whims, where Morrowind feels like it doesn't care if you live or die.  It's old, kinda clunky at times, and unforgiving, but it's also huge, deep, and fascinating to explore. I think it's the best PC game of all time, so I'm obviously biased, but I think you should give it a shot."

Pretty much essential.  MGE XE : Enables distant land, better lighting/shading, visual effects like bloom and sunrays, all around better graphics. Doesn't affect textures or models, just the game's renderer.  And if you get the GOTY edition or any of them that come with the Tribunal expansion, Delayed Dark Brotherhood Attack. The expansion starts with you randomly getting attacked in your sleep, and if you have it activated with the game when you start, it can happen at level one. Since that expansion is meant for after the main quest (or at least a good ways through it), the assassin is pretty powerful and is usually a lot to handle for a new player, so this mod just makes sure it doesn't happen until you're a decent way through the main quest. Just prevents some frustrating deaths when you're just trying to heal.  This one isn't a mod, more a save-cleaning and repairing utility, but Wrye Mash is a great tool to have if you're modding, it'll let you repair save files to remove old scripts and other mod remnants and fix bugs. Great tool once you learn how to use it, but you don't really need to get it right at the start. Just remember if you ever break your game from modding, it fixes a lot of problems easily.  Other than those ones, it just depends on your tastes and how much time you want to spend modding the game. There's a ton of great mods out there, but a lot of people prefer a more vanilla experience so I'd just look around the links on the sidebar and see what works for you."
ElderScrolls,3a63hn,lame_corprus,2,Wed Jun 17 15:52:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendations. Probably wouldnt be able to handle the overhaul
ElderScrolls,3a63hn,Calypse27,2,Wed Jun 17 16:01:08 2015 UTC,I think it's worth it to experience vanilla in all its beauty regardless. There's a certain mystery to playing with a shorter view distance etc.
ElderScrolls,3a63hn,Calypse27,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:48:22 2015 UTC,Morrowind Overhaul (they were on 3.0 when I played a year or so ago) is a good place to start.
ElderScrolls,3a63hn,Calypse27,2,Wed Jun 17 15:32:47 2015 UTC,"I just played through it last year, it is still great! I have a large amount of nostalgia from my earlier gaming days though.    Lots of reading for sure.  It is also more free form, no quest markers, you have to read your journal to figure out where to go, take queues from landmarks, etc.  The combat is basically a dice roll, so the advice ""save often"" is even more true. It can be clunky and infuriating at first, but you'll get used to it. (Magic operates a bit differently, you'll have to experiment with this on your own.) I will say it did not age well, doesn't stop me from loving it though. The spells, clothes, and armor enchants are definitely more traditional RPG than the other games. Less forgiving. Oh you spent 2 hours walking to a location only to get diseased without a potion to cure it, sorry! Reload and try again! No fast travel but there are Siltstriders (giant bugs that fly from town to town) along with boats and Mage's Guild teleportation system. Here is a detailed map that came in handy for me. Also a BIG piece of advice I offer is research what character build you want. The leveling is like Oblivion so your major and minor stats make you progress, while you get multipliers for whatever skills you leveled in that time (regardless if they're major/minor/neither). You don't have to do this but you can get +5 to skills instead of +1 and it really helps to optimize your character.   It takes a bit to get used to but is still a fantastic game. I would definitely get the GOTY edition as it adds a quest menu in your journal which helps you find details on quests.   Feel free to message me or comment on this with any other questions, even when you're (hopefully) playing through! :D  edit: A few more bullets."

It's a complete graphical overhaul, it does stress your comp though, so it might take some tweaking.   Yea you can be an Orc, if you prefer Orc Warrior or whatever I would look up some builds online or try a few before you roll with it. The most important decision is character creation."

ElderScrolls,3a2zxv,darthmarticus,4,Wed Jun 17 00:43:30 2015 UTC,Skywind is just putting morrowind into skyrims engine if I'm not mistaken. Not taking every aspect like its spells and combat system.

ElderScrolls,3a2zxv,Sehtriom,5,Wed Jun 17 03:18:25 2015 UTC,"I'd rather they just work on getting the next game out as soon as possible.  I think what made Morrowind such a great game was how complex it was and how ""weird"" of a place Morrowind was.  I'd love to see those attributes in the next game, but unfortunately, I think they're moving in the direction of making games more ""streamlined"" and ""accessible"" for a wider audience."
ElderScrolls,3a2zxv,shadowfox06,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:17:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree they are making things that way. Although all the customization of upcoming games will probably overwhelm me a bit... But I think that the streamlining could be applied to Morrowind. Change the combat system and then up the graphics and I guarantee the mainstream would love it (I still would say no arrows to objectives...). But I guess my thing is nothing has felt like the ""weirdness"" that was Morrowind. If they did for the next one, I guess I would be content with that."
ElderScrolls,3a2zxv,Idimmu_Xul,3,Wed Jun 17 03:22:09 2015 UTC,I think they should make another Adventures game.

Like i dont really care if its a morrowind remake,  but Bethesda needs to get back to their roots and build a truly open RPG.  I think they got caught up in action type combat,  and making sure your character cannot become truly op . . . Like consider how much more amazing magic was in Morrowind.  I think its because they left you with unlimited possibilities, they didn't care if u just levitated above a battle and spammed atronochs and spells. (edit: AND SPELLCRAFTING WAS SO OP but amazing!)  They also didn't care about making the game fair. You could wander off into an extremely difficult environment basically right after you get off the prison ship! Nothing was stopping you from heading to the Ghost Gate and punching some Daedra. It was TRULY open, none of this ""enemies match your level"" bullshit.  ONE MORE THING (i know this is kinda just a rant) : BUT COME ON,  HOW COOL WAS IT THAT ALL THE LOOT WAS HAND PLACED? (or at least a lot of it)...  Real motivation to explore and discover everything you could think of! Maybe eliminating fast travel played a hand in making exploring fun,  as well.   Thx for a place to rant yo"
ElderScrolls,3a2zxv,Idimmu_Xul,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:32:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said, and I just thought of something I've been trying to put in words for a good year or so...   back to their roots and build a truly open RPG.   Bethesda are making the world larger and putting more emphasis on ""open world experience"" than ever, but in a way I have a feeling that they are doing exactly the opposite. The newer TES games feel a bit railroady to me.  In Morrowind, you could talk about dozens of topics with anyone, through Oblivion and Skyrim the characters got limited context/character-based lines (although voiced) and in upcoming FO4 we see the 4-line conversation wheel. I know it's an early demo but I'm a bit worried about the series."
ElderScrolls,3a2zxv,Idimmu_Xul,2,Sat Jun 20 15:33:57 2015 UTC,"Bethesda definitely needs to make a Morrowind remake. Not only would tbey profit greatly from it, but also it would not take them nearly as long to make and entirely new game. It would be a win win for both the fans and the company."
ElderScrolls,3a2zxv,menta-na,6,Wed Jun 17 02:48:13 2015 UTC,"People need to understand that old games are awesome but remakes of them will never grant the same feeling you get as when you first played the original.

ElderScrolls,3a2zxv,drogvokun,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:27:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah honestly, just making updated textures and models,  and polishing up the slightly nonsensical combat would definitely make the game feel fresh and new. Maybe more voice acting, little stuff like that to make it feel more modern.   All they really would have to do is rerelease it with minor updates and people will buy it, even new fans from TES 4/5 and TES:O may be curious about the development of the series."
ElderScrolls,3a2zxv,Pishwi,2,Wed Jun 17 09:44:39 2015 UTC,"Very true,  i just mean they SHOULD maybe strip down what theyre doing now,  as far as graphics etc,  in favor of a more lush environment.   Just my 2 cents though, i feel like parts of skyrim are gorgeous, but then like the factions and quests for them seem kinda lacking.   Although, maybe im victim to nostalgia, because a lot of faction quests in Morrowind were just ""fetch this relic from this place.""  Idk my bad, just rambling late at night on reddit"
ElderScrolls,3a2zxv,kangaesugi,2,Wed Jun 17 11:54:18 2015 UTC,Daggerfall and Arena first. Morrowind is far closer to modern than those two.

Fallout 4 was just announced + We've been waiting for it for a long time = No surprise that they would put the Elder Scrolls aside and work on new IPs.  But getting at the underlying sentiment, of ""I want Elder Scrolls now!"" vs. ""Fallout had to wait a long time so expect a wait.""  They managed to announce Skyrim two years after FO3.   I'm anticipating something similar here.  My guess is a 2017 announcement, 2018 release.   This would, incidentally, put as at an identical wait time  as the one between Fallout Games. Seven years.  Five if you count New Vegas.  As for new IPs, he listed Fallout Shelter as other things they might do. So I'm just expecting a lot more Elder Scrolls Legends and Fallout Shelter type stuff between main releases.  I still figure we're going to settle into a FO - ES - FO - ES - FO schedule. We'll just get filler between."

ElderScrolls,3a5ao4,kangaesugi,3,Wed Jun 17 12:36:27 2015 UTC,"I think they should just stick with fallout and tes. I know it would be boring, but these two series are a gold mine.  Or, if they wanna do a new ip no matter what, I think they should make tes 6 before going for it."
ElderScrolls,3a5ao4,CHawk15,3,Wed Jun 17 12:58:45 2015 UTC,"Provided they're willing to spend the necessary money to do it (which, granted, is no sure thing), what's the downside in expanding? They wouldn't be neglecting The Elder Scrolls or Fallout at all in that scenario."
ElderScrolls,3a5ao4,ThatGuy743,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:21:32 2015 UTC,If it's boring for them then I'd support them working on new things. If they keep working just on TES and Fallout despite being burned out with it then everyone will notice a considerable drop in quality.

ElderScrolls,3a5ao4,ErrantTitan,3,Wed Jun 17 18:53:42 2015 UTC,"So... why haven't IGN or Gamespot figured this out yet? Seems to be fake to me, or at least stretching the truth.  He never said ""new ip"". He said they were working on new things. Then he refered to Fallout Shelter. New things doesn't mean new ip. He could also be refering to the new Elder Scrolls card game.  I highly doubt Bethesda would stop making their best selling franchise, which is the same one which put Bethesda on the map. Skyrim sold 20 million copies and ES6 could easily sell more."

ElderScrolls,3a5ao4,Retrogamer82,2,Wed Jun 17 22:01:23 2015 UTC,"Not surprised. Whether they're working on it or not, they aren't going to say anything now as they don't want to distract attention away from Fallout 4 and ESO. Considering ESO still needs time to gain some traction and Fallout 4 will likely have expansions through 2016, I wouldn't expect to hear anything official until E3 2017 at the earliest. E3 2018 is my bet at this point.  Even if ESO and Fallout 4 aren't direct competitors to the TES: 6, they're all similar enough that they could cannibalize each others sales and/or player base. I'm sure there will be a sufficient gap between Fallout 4 and TES: 6, but I'm really curious to see how they'll handle having TES: 6 and ESO going side by side. Maybe some exclusive offerings or free Crowns in ESO if you buy TES: 6?"
ElderScrolls,3a5ao4,tajebimba,2,Wed Jun 17 17:11:00 2015 UTC,"Guys. Seriously. Relax.  He presented Fallout Shelter as an example of ""Them doing other things.""  Given that his quote is incredibly vague and lists a promotional cell-phone game as ""Other things"" they'd like to do, I think OP is really reading into this.  I take it to mean we are going to see a lot more Elder Scrolls Online/Elder Scrolls Legends type games between main titles.  ES/FO Main Titles cause Bethesda to shit money. They are slowly making their franchises household names and I suspect that the next ES release is going to rocket it right up there with the franchises that have become symbolic of video games.   They aren't going to kill that to experiment and make random new IPs.  I'm fortified in this belief due to Fallout Shelter being presented as an example of them ""Doing something else"".  Just expect a crap ton more ESO/ESL"

Playing Morrowind after Skyrim is like going from lazy fan fiction to an actual IP. Now that elder scrolls had its coming out party to the broey AAA customer base, I think they'll be more confident getting real nerdy with the story.   -More attempts to force you to play with companions, which is probably my least favorite thing to do in Skyrim.   -Possibly an attempt at some form of native multiplayer, but not likely  -a shit ton of DLC"

Even if it doesn't happen, I think TES6 is likely to do it. It seemed to me that the pullback was viewed (by Bethesda and Valve) as a problem with doing it in an established modding scene.  They may make some changes, and honestly if they can alleviate certain issues it will just be a thing, so until we read any new terms I wouldn't have a reaction."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,zenthr,2,Tue Jun 16 13:58:15 2015 UTC,Oh we all know  this is bound to happen. There's too much profit to be had to not do it. They just have to find an efficient way to get it to the consumer that will outlast the outrage it will inevitably and rightfully spawn.
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Blunderbar,4,Tue Jun 16 14:41:08 2015 UTC,"I see alot of potential with the weapon and armor customization.  Imagine the different sword and armor combinations you could make. Sword hilt with two Saber teeth, handle out of gold ingot, and the blade out of crystal."

ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Contagious_Cure,12,Wed Jun 17 06:21:03 2015 UTC,Let's discuss what features from F4 should be in Tes 6 I for one hope they will also have a Voice Actor for the main Char in Tes VI This improves the immersion in dialogs sooooo much!   Also the building part looks neat. I want to create my own stronghold!  And containers where you can see the content not just as a pop-up menu!
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Metalcandle,30,Tue Jun 16 05:51:35 2015 UTC,i disagree about the voice actor... i think it'd take away from RP and doing your own thing
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,bytor_2112,11,Tue Jun 16 12:31:34 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. In fallout the canon is a lot different IMO, I don't have a problem with it because i feel it still does the role playing and immersion justice. In elder scrolls however the decisions you make and way you portray yourself are left ambiguous in subsequent games to almost extremes, like how in daggerfell all ending are canon at like the same time.  I feel that having a set character can easily work in fallout but I think would really harm the elder scrolls due to how the games lore and canon has been setup"
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,rawisshawn,3,Tue Jun 16 14:23:00 2015 UTC,"yeah -- plus, if Fallout and TES are reskinned versions of each other, why play both? I want them to be great on their own and each with their own benefits and quirks"
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,bytor_2112,5,Tue Jun 16 15:54:36 2015 UTC,It didn't affect Mass Effect for me. I think it can be done right.
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,MealyDucard,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:55:01 2015 UTC,"I can see no change there - the game gives you the possible answers already in skyrim. The only difference is that you will also hear them instead of only read them.   I can see that there will be not so many voices to choose from (and thererfore identify with), but I think it will make the own character feel more alive and in touch with his environment. It's like having a door just swing open or seeing your character lean forward and push the door with his hand to swing open."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Metalcandle,5,Tue Jun 16 13:05:50 2015 UTC,"My only problem is that there are multiple races that clearly have accents and dialects specific to that race. That's A LOT of voice acting, double it for having female characters. I wouldn't mind hearing a voice, but I see why people wouldn't and I'd be fine with silence too. Plus for example, not every Dunmer sounds the same. If I make an old Mage type character I would expect him to sound different than a younger fighter-type. And that's just for the one race. You'd have to have at least 3 or more voices for each race really. Otherwise replay value wouldn't be as immersive."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,GoHomeLydia,9,Tue Jun 16 15:51:52 2015 UTC,I buliding part is what i was mostly focused on and i gotta say that it would be one of the best things for TES 6.
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Blunderbar,6,Tue Jun 16 06:19:29 2015 UTC,"You'd need:  male human Male elf Male khajiit voice  Male argonian voice   And all the female counterparts of those MINIMUM, for all lines the character speaks.   I don't think Bethesda's gonna do that, and I honestly don't want them to try because I fear they might simplify it and take away options like a gender or a race or something."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Metalcandle,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:21:16 2015 UTC,"Some years ago fully npc-voiced rpgs were also seen as not necessary - imagine the uproar TES VI has some Text-only NPCs.  I think for the Player Character voice this will also happen sooner then later - maybe not TES VI, but in some years most People will see it as a standard to be met, as most other rpgs , from what I can see, currently go in this direction."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Blunderbar,3,Tue Jun 16 13:31:38 2015 UTC,"I honestly find Morrowind's text to be less hammy, intrusive, and just plain ""skip-worthy"" than Skyrim's/Oblivion's dialogue. I find myself reading the subtitle and skipping through the voice, because it's a waste of time and the voice over is usually terrible anyway. Honestly the singular sentences delivered terribly by the same four voice actors can't hold a candle to the specialized, lore driven paragraphs and snippets from characters I've encountered in Morrowind. Just requires a bit more reading."

ElderScrolls,3a01fl,redeXcs,2,Tue Jun 16 15:34:19 2015 UTC,Voice actor in a TES game? Never. That'd be terrible.
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Rikiaz,7,Wed Jun 17 03:18:26 2015 UTC,I just hope they leave the voiced main character out. It's not a huge deal in Fallout but it would ruin TES for me.
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,American_quack,2,Tue Jun 16 16:03:35 2015 UTC,Agree.
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Contagious_Cure,2,Tue Jun 16 16:59:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure if building will be in TES6. I think we'll still have to buy homes but we'll have more control in how they're decorated and upgraded. Remember that FO universe is a post-apocalyptic world and rebuilding the world fits in thematically with that game, not as much for ES IMO. That said I'm hoping that the creation engine will be more user friendly (and crash less) so castle mods or city mods are easier to do."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,KingSmoke,3,Wed Jun 17 04:40:26 2015 UTC,"Towns and cities are realistically sized and populated like in the Witcher 3 so that the fucking capital city is bigger than 12 houses (looking at you, Solitude) Better crafting system Better combat mechanics  Build your own stronghold, even if given a specific plot of land with restricted dimensions Hopefully a much better main story arc like in Morrowind Horse riding like in the Witcher 3 More believable faction storylines and having npcs respect you for being the leader of one (less ""Do you go the Cloud District often?"") More diversity in landscape and architecture. Skyrim was notoriously bland after a while Perhaps 2 continents instead of one would truly make it a next-level TES installation"

I'd rather like it the elder scrolls style with unique NPC's and a fully enterable world."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,KingSmoke,7,Tue Jun 16 14:14:42 2015 UTC,Morrowind achieved this just fine with Balmora and Vivec City. Then we see a downsizing in Oblivion followed by a HUGE downsize in Skyrim. It feels lazy.
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,PunxsatownyPhil,2,Tue Jun 16 14:18:40 2015 UTC,Not to mention Ald'ruhn!
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Retrogamer82,2,Tue Jun 16 14:33:37 2015 UTC,"It most definitely is not laziness. You gotta understand the tech. You want npcs living their life or just standing around 24 hours a day like in Morrowind?  That being said, I'm stoked to see BGS grow this area of gaming tech and look forward to cities the size of Vivec with NPCs living their life."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Lemon_Tree,4,Tue Jun 16 17:34:38 2015 UTC,"idk, it's more realistic that you wouldn't be able to know/meet everyone in a big city, and that you wouldn't enter every house. It's choice vs. realism (being able to simulate the feeling of being in a big city, most people are just faceless crowds, most buildings are just backdrop)."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,lady_blue_shanghai,3,Tue Jun 16 19:11:07 2015 UTC,"Plot: As the Thalmor launch a full-scale assault on the races of man, the Dwemer reappear as their disappearance with the Numidium was in fact a dragon break that launched them centuries into the future.  Mechanics: I honestly don't know; I just hope that the game isn't overly gimped to comply with consoles, and we can actually get some decently sized towns that aren't bound by the ""representing 10% of the size they're supposed to be by lore standards"" and a larger body of voice actors. I'd really rather prefer to see an expansion/refinement of current game mechanics instead of the implementation of new ones.  Edit: I'd also like to see the lore actually serving a real purpose in TES6, as it did in Morrowind, rather than simply existing somewhat in the periphery as we've seen in Skyrim. That's not at all to say in any way that Skyrim ignored lore, but that it was entirely possible to go through a massive majority of the game via typical hack n' slash/fantasy tropes, and miss out on all Tamriel has to offer, because there's no real incentive to for many players. I'd like to see a genuine commitment to immersing the player in the world, where you learn about the cultures and the influences that motivate groups or individuals to behave in certain ways. I'm not saying force everyone into this, that if you don't give two fucks about TES lore, you're not bound by it, but that the developers should attempt to create stronger incentives for players to become more engaged in the world, beyond the role of some generic world-savior.  I want my actions to feel like they actually matter, instead of being railroaded into a pre-scripted chain of events."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,HansMannibus,3,Tue Jun 16 08:43:59 2015 UTC,You have a great idea for a plot. Living in a war torn land where the Thalmor and Dwemer are the opposing forces with everyone caught in the middle would be amazing.  edit: just saw that you were getting downvoted. Not sure why lol. Reddit is a strange place.
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,lady_blue_shanghai,3,Tue Jun 16 16:11:20 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to bet a sizable chunk of money that it's because of the comment about consoles.

ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Hoo7on,-2,Tue Jun 16 18:08:39 2015 UTC,"Judging from how it looks? I'll guess that TES6 will be at least a year or two behind in graphics. Fallout has not impressed me on the graphics front so far.  Of course, we don't play Bethesda games for the graphics. Skyrim was a nice looking game and I loved the style, but it didn't stack up with other games in 2011. I definitely don't want them to sacrifice anything for more graphical quality, since that isn't what TES is about. But it would be nice to have a really deep game that we're used to, but also have a graphics engine that really pushes the boundaries and really immerses you in the world."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Pickleburp,2,Tue Jun 16 14:03:36 2015 UTC,"it didn't stack up with other games in 2011   Can you give an example? I'm not saying Skyrim was perfect, but I thought they did a fantastic job with it. It up- and down-scales well, and is still very nice looking at lower resolutions.   I'm curious to see what games were that much better (in a ""maybe I missed something"" way)."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Hoo7on,2,Tue Jun 16 17:54:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I said 2011 but I was thinking more about Halo Reach, which was released in 2010, but still looked better (in my opinion).  That's kind of why I added the caveat that we don't play for the graphics because TES games are way different and much larger than an FPS. And I'm also speaking about consoles, I'm sure it looked much better on PC even without mods."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Pickleburp,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:42:48 2015 UTC,"It would depend on the PC - for some reason my ATI card is fine with HD textures but the shaders needed tweaking to hit 60fps.  Halo Reach was a nice-looking game, I'll admit that. I still haven't played through the whole thing (I beat the first two Halos but I'm not a huge fan of the series, they're great games just not my forte), but the graphics all together are really great, yes. Plus, who can argue with having Firefly cast members in your squad?"

ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Th3DeathDog,15,Tue Jun 16 08:03:22 2015 UTC,"I think your missing the entire purpose of an elders scrolls game.  Your supposed to create your own character and back story and play the game as if you were that charter.  This makes the game more personal for each person, ensuring everyone has a unique experience, and forces the game more replay value.  It's called "" role-playing"" and if you haven't heard of it, its kinda an essential part of a ROLE-PLAYING game.  Welcome to a real RPG and not a gage that through in a leveling system, maybe a couple player choices here and there, and possibly turn-based combat and think that those think it makes it a RPG.  If you want to be told a story, read a book or possibly watch a movie, so far they have been able to trek a story better than any video game had.  If you want to experience your own story instead of being told someone else's story, play a RPG, and I mean a real RPG, like Skyrim, not something like Final Fantasy or Pokemon."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,YouCantTakeThisName,2,Tue Jun 16 12:46:07 2015 UTC,"Some people do still prefer a silent protagonist, though. (Silent most of the time but makes grunting & yelling noises when fighting, actual words when ""Shouting"", and of course pained noises when damaged)  It certainly would be interesting to have a fully-voiced protagonist, I grant you that.  If that were the case, I'd also like multiple voice options for each Race/Sex combination."
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Kamthebest,2,Tue Jun 16 12:13:44 2015 UTC,Maybe a mute/spoken option?
ElderScrolls,3a01fl,Blunderbar,0,Tue Jun 16 12:31:26 2015 UTC,Then all the story/dialogue written around your character speaking wouldn't work for silent characters. It has to be one or the other.

It plays really well on the controller.  The ability to just have some good old fashion mmo fun on the couch is amazing.   The first couple areas were super crowded, which is a good sign of the community size at the moment, I do think this game will appeal to people who have maybe never dabbled in the mmorpg genre before and the community might have some fresh faces ( as opposed to most new PC mmos are filled with veterans just rushing towards endgame ).  Game did perform a bit clunky in the main town and on the first couple quests, due to the amount of people, but now that I have progressed a little further than that it is seeming to run pretty well.   I recommended the game to two of my friends who played mmos before and I would recommend it to you if you are at all interested. The community may or may not last long, and honestly it's ""just another mmo"" albeit it seems pretty polished and quite immersive.   If you're interested and have the funds. I would say the game will give you at least your money's worth and with the new community you may make a friend or two !  Month or two from now, maybe not.  Time will see how the community adopts it, I definitely think that it plays quite well on the controller so I'll be optimistic on it !"

ElderScrolls,39vdfp,ZophieWinters,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:29:49 2015 UTC,"Bet you they don't really have much to show.  They may have been showing the idea just to get a response, and if it's a mostly positive one they may put more time and money into it than if it was kind meh."
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,TheSkoomaCat,31,Mon Jun 15 22:36:22 2015 UTC,"Looks rather meh.  To be honest, this wasn't the E3 for Elder Scrolls fans.    Tonight was about Fallout, (which is cool, don't get me wrong!)  All the stuff with the voiced player characters and next level crafting looks great, and one can hope they will be incorporated into Elder Scrolls 6."
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,HoboSnacks,3,Mon Jun 15 03:52:44 2015 UTC,That's how I partly looked at fallout and at other new games: I'd love to see this or that applied in the elder scrolls universe!  But Fallout looks real good and it's got me strongly considering an xbox one

ElderScrolls,39vdfp,Neglectful_Stranger,-2,Mon Jun 15 04:55:26 2015 UTC,It was the most popular online-based card game system.  With Bethesda.net it is pretty clear they are ripping off Blizzard.
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,Pickleburp,2,Mon Jun 15 17:24:48 2015 UTC,"With Bethesda.net it is pretty clear they are ripping off Blizzard.   But it's not. None of us have seen the game. All we know is it's an online card game that's free to play and Elder Scrolls themed.  Also, before Hearthstone, Magic: The Gathering was online and had application versions on mobile, consoles, and PC."

ElderScrolls,39vdfp,nallen104,2,Mon Jun 15 14:42:27 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but I kind of doubt they would feature art from a race not seen in games yet."
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,nallen104,13,Mon Jun 15 19:42:04 2015 UTC,"No offense, but I sense another Hearthstone"
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,Silnroz,7,Mon Jun 15 20:28:44 2015 UTC,That's pretty much what I'm thinking. What would be wrong with that though? I like Hearthstone.
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,Mutatedkitty,6,Mon Jun 15 03:23:55 2015 UTC,"I expected more from Bethesda. First they make an mmo, now a card game. Idk, it seems they are trying to follow in the footsteps of Blizzard :("
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,nallen104,16,Mon Jun 15 03:25:07 2015 UTC,They've been developing Fallout 4 since 2011. Anyone who expected TESVI after the fallout reveal earlier this month is a moron.
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,Silnroz,5,Mon Jun 15 03:29:00 2015 UTC,"I mean...I don't think anyone wanted Elder Scrolls 6, I think they just... don't want 2 hearthstones"
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,nallen104,2,Mon Jun 15 04:02:00 2015 UTC,"Never said I wanted TESVI.... Just said I can't believe they making a card game and I expected more (fwi, I don't literally mean I expected they reveal more things, I simply meant I thought they were better than that)"
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,Zonvolt,16,Mon Jun 15 18:26:17 2015 UTC,You say that like Legends is somehow a bad thing. It's not. it's a small side project that won't be taking anything away from any major release.
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,n60storm4,-7,Mon Jun 15 04:09:16 2015 UTC,I mean we have Hearthstone already. But I suppose I see your point
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,ThatGuy743,11,Mon Jun 15 04:11:41 2015 UTC,It doesn't hurt to have competition for hearthstone
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,Toasterman1990,9,Mon Jun 15 04:15:35 2015 UTC,Just because we have Dragon Age doesn't mean we don't need Skyrim.

ElderScrolls,39vdfp,lepablo,3,Mon Jun 15 13:06:47 2015 UTC,Well I think they're kind of focusing on Fallout 4 right now. Maybe that isn't your thing idk. I think it's great that they're doing more with the awesome lore they've created. And I'm sure they'll shift their focus more toward the next Elder Scrolls game after Fallout is out.
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,Toasterman1990,11,Tue Jun 16 15:11:14 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who is pretty excited about this?  I wasn't expecting anything for TES (besides some news about ESO) since they won't be making a TES VI anytime soon (because of Fallout 4 and ESO, mostly ESO as they just released it on consoles and don't want players to quit that game for TES VI now). There won't be much development time for an actual TES RPG lost since it's not made by the same studio and card games tend to be easier to develop anyways. This is just an extra, and since I like card games and I like TES I'm pumped.  Don't expect another TES RPG anytime soon. Enjoy your time with Mods in Skyrim or ESO."
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,ThatGuy743,5,Mon Jun 15 03:33:42 2015 UTC,You are definitely not the only one. A TES themed card game sounds awesome! Would be great if we got at least some more lore with it too.
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,uGGo7,3,Mon Jun 15 10:21:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, and they show us a fucking  Maormer in the teaser :D"
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,Sup_Guyz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:52:14 2015 UTC,"Yes this is definitely exiting I just hope it isn't a brain dead version of magic like hearth is, and actually has some depth to it."

ElderScrolls,39vdfp,ben5292001,5,Tue Jun 16 15:12:31 2015 UTC,I hope this game will be packed with lore. Makes it more interesting to play.
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,Tag_ross,3,Mon Jun 15 13:15:43 2015 UTC,Because we all know how well Elder Scrolls games with Legend in the title go.
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,RebelSoul23,3,Mon Jun 15 12:19:02 2015 UTC,Don't hate on Battlespire!
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,MilesTheHunter,3,Mon Jun 15 10:36:52 2015 UTC,"I wasn't being sarcastic, it's my favorite game ever, especially when it works."
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,n60storm4,3,Mon Jun 15 15:06:11 2015 UTC,"My hopes for this game have risen since I realize who is working on the development team. That being at very least one pro Magic: the Gathering player with several others I think. But only one that I can confirm for sure.  This helps the hype for the game for me, since I am a big fan of M:tG and I know that LSV (The developer I know for sure is on the project) enjoys many of the same things I enjoy about magic, the main one being Value.  Note: When i say developer I don't mean any thing to do with software but rather to do with developing the cards themselves. As in deciding on power level of cards and the like."
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,CyanPancake,2,Mon Jun 15 15:25:53 2015 UTC,"I am curious about this one.  I do like card games (and have recently been looking for a new one to play, to be honest), but I don't really know how I feel about TES being turned into one.    I have a hell of a lot of faith in Bethesda, though.  I don't think they'll screw it up, but that doesn't mean it will be the next big game either."
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,sphotavada,2,Mon Jun 15 23:17:59 2015 UTC,What I'll enjoy best for this is the competition it will bring to hearthstone.
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,YoloYoungberry,2,Mon Jun 15 03:55:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's a smart move for Bethesda. The digital card game industry is fairly new,  but I see it growing into something huge. Everybody's gonna jump on the DCG bandwagon. Kudos to Bethesda for doing it this early."
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,CrazyMinxi,2,Mon Jun 15 05:18:01 2015 UTC,They mentioned PC & iPad specifically...should we not expect iPhone support?

I've never been huge into card games, but the amount of Hearthstone I played before realizing I'd need to spend a bunch of money on packs to get any further was really fun, and I'd really love to see how they incorporate characters from the lore we've never seen and characters from the games."
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,wdmshmo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:47:06 2015 UTC,I like how they announced it with a video of Pete instead of him announcing it live.

ElderScrolls,39vdfp,Akrash,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:51:11 2015 UTC,"A game like this wouldn't take very large of a team (when comparing to an MMO or large scale RPG like Skyrim or Fallout)  Give it time, there will be another TES game before long, and it'll be just what we hoped for."

ElderScrolls,39vdfp,trollolol101,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:27:14 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Fallout will have a wicked modding community.   I think it's safe to say they will.  I'm pretty stoked about all the stuff that's already in the game.  There's sooo much modding potential for it.  The only reason I say a few years is because this game looks massive; so much so that I highly doubt they've been working a new TES game along side it.  The brunt of the work they've done on the game may have been in the updated Creation engine, so it's quite possible that it won't take a couple years if they use the same engine, but we're probably looking at one year minimum I'd think."
ElderScrolls,39vdfp,trollolol101,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:03:02 2015 UTC,"I wish that I were more educated on the way these people make games. They're definitely not a small studio who would be struggling with a single game, but they could be just large enough to handle all of these projects. However even with dedicated teams for each release, I'd expect a large portion of the people involved to shuffle from project to project. Seems like they've been expanding for a few years now."

I would rather they didn't have any news for TES if all they had was a F2P mobile game. I wasn't expecting TES VI of course, however this just seems like a cash-in to me. At least it doesn't take away from a main game but I can't say I'm not disappointed- I really hope TES (as a series) doesn't start to get milked by this kind of stuff."

ElderScrolls,39vli5,_Ralchire,0,Mon Jun 15 08:19:40 2015 UTC,"That's just the most widely-accepted speculation with the most evidence. It is not, however, a solid established fact. Others are free to have their own headcanon about the matter. That's the great thing about the Elder Scrolls and it makes it feel more realistic IMO."
ElderScrolls,39vli5,KiboshWasabi,2,Wed Jun 17 02:40:24 2015 UTC,Yeah but we're not talking headcanon now are we? We're talking probably plotlines for TES;6. /r/teslore is for headcanon.
ElderScrolls,39vli5,_Ralchire,2,Wed Jun 17 10:13:02 2015 UTC,"There is no set canon for the bit about the Dwemer being the skin of the Numidium--that's your headcanon, albeit a very popular one. It's got evidence to back it up but, as another commenter pointed out, the disappearance of the Dwemer is intentionally left ambiguous and will likely never be officially answered."
ElderScrolls,39vli5,KiboshWasabi,0,Wed Jun 17 21:29:23 2015 UTC,"We're still not talking about headcanon, not sure why you keep bringing it up. Try to stay on topic. That being the probable plotline of TES:VI. Is it your opinion that it will involve the return of the Dwemer? Is that what your trying to get at?"
ElderScrolls,39vli5,_Ralchire,2,Wed Jun 17 23:22:37 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I'm simply saying that there is no established explanation for the disappearance of the Dwemer, even though you claim that they became the skin of the Numidium (that's your headcanon and it should stay in your head until someone asks for it)."

I saw a ton of it after we met the last noncorrupted Falmer in Dawnguard, but I think in the end if just will never happen. It's too great of a mystery, and it stirs so much controversy over what really happened. This is one of those things we'll always wonder about, and get a few vague clues here and there, but will never have any truly concrete evidence on.  Bethesda knows this can't be answered because there are too many camps of thought on how it should be done. I'm sure that even within their team there's differing opinions ... strong ones, at that."

Ever since reading ""A Dance in Fire"" I have been absolutely mesmerized with Valenwood.  The humans cultures are a bit boring to me, I love the uniqueness of the elven cultures and Bosmer are as unique as they come.  Plus, walking tree cities!!!  However I strongly suspect next game will be in Summerset, which is fine with me too.  To be honest I don't care all that much where the next game is set, I would love to play in any province.  I hope I can see them all in my lifetime/before the franchise dies."
ElderScrolls,39tune,Isaac_The_Khajiit,6,Mon Jun 15 01:24:01 2015 UTC,"I found that, to me, the most immersion limiting factor of Skyrim (alongside NPC behavior and dialog) is the scale of the province.  It seems you can take an easy stroll from one hold to another without breaking a sweat. More laughable is the fact that major cities such as Solitude or Whiterun each have populations of about 50. Outside of Dragonsreach, Whiterun feels more like a village than a hold's capital.  To clarify, I'm not advocating a 1:1 scale similar to what Bethesda has done with Daggerfall as it makes gameplay miserable. I don't exactly know what the scale is in Skyrim (also it varies locally - Riverwood is roughly the same size as in reality or a couple times smaller while Solitude is hundreds times smaller), let's assume it's 1:100. I would like to see a TES game with a scale of 1:10 that would only feature two large cities, like one hold (subprovince), but be the same size as Skyrim.  Though now mostly outdated, Vvardenfell, as presented in Morrowind, felt more geographically varied and larger than Skyrim in many ways. One of the places I'd be interested to see is Torval along with some of the Valenwood borderlands.  That said that is what I wish TES 6 to be, not what it will be. My money is on Bethesda featuring entire Valenwood."

Hammerfell could serve in stark contrast to Skyrim's snowy tundras and coniferous forests by showing us hot deserts and marshy woodlands. Plus, we don't get enough desert areas in modern RPGs.  On the other hand, I've always wanted a game set on the Sommerset Isles dealing with a Sload invasion. Imagine a game set in a tropical paradise where the main questline is to either help fight a race of bipedal slugpeople, or join them and help this slimy, salt-fearing race take back their old land with their undead armies. Also, I think Sommerset could work for similar reasons to what I said above.  I also like the Valenwood/Elsweyr setting for the same reasons as everyone else. Personally, I don't think a game where the primary NPC race are cat people would sell very well to the public. Sure ES and RPG fans would buy it; to the casual gamer, however, it would not be as interesting or desirable as Skyrim was. So I think adding Valenwood on was a genius idea! It not only gives us a varied map geographically and politically, but we can feasibly play in Elsweyr."

In other words, the 2 novels help fill in the gaps of the Fourth Era, with the main story starting from 4E40 (exactly 40 years after the end of the Oblivion Crisis).  The books tend to mention events that have happened at least as early as 4E10.  One of the main characters in the novels is a member of the Mede Dynasty, which rules the Third Empire since earlier in the Fourth Era."
ElderScrolls,39tm3c,YouCantTakeThisName,4,Sun Jun 14 18:22:29 2015 UTC,They are a short ride but fun especially for a summer novel if you don't read all that much. The books give you a bit of perceptive on what went on between Oblivion and Skyrim with a bit of information about the Black Marsh and Argonians as a whole. If you are a fan of the Elder Scrolls I would say that the books are short enough that they are worth the read.

ElderScrolls,39vjg9,XDgooXD,9,Mon Jun 15 03:42:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be upset about them not announcing TES VI at E3 2015.  That only means Bethesda is not ready to announce it yet.  It remains most likely that TES VI has been in development since 2011, and there remains sufficient evidence from the days of Fallout 3 that Bethesda's team(s) can work on TES games alongside Fallout games.  All we have to go on now is that Fallout 4 was started up sometime in 2009, while Skyrim was still in development.  Afterwards, ""Redguard"" was trademarked, and Fallout 4 might've been focused on more at this time while DLC was being developed for Skyrim.  Which brings me back to the point [that I established in another article] of any DLC developed for Fallout 4 not affecting any further work being done on TES VI.  (Edit): Since TES VI wasn't revealed at this year's E3?  Wait until next year, in 2016, and see if they're going to announce their newest single-player TES then."
ElderScrolls,39vjg9,YouCantTakeThisName,10,Mon Jun 15 04:01:09 2015 UTC,"they do work on them at the same time. TES VI will have been in pre-production the entire time fallout 4 was being made, and as soon as it releases they're going to go into full swing making TES VI. its how their development cycle has worked for 10 years now.  Edit: just to clarify, that doesn't mean that we're going to see another elder scrolls soon. bethesda only have 1 team so while they have a small number of people working pre-production they're not actually going to put TES VI into full production until fallout 4 is finished. don't expect one for another 3 or so years."
ElderScrolls,39vjg9,thatguythatdidstuff,3,Mon Jun 15 07:24:55 2015 UTC,"What remains to be seen now, however, is when exactly development of TES VI started.

ElderScrolls,39vjg9,YouCantTakeThisName,5,Mon Jun 15 10:13:26 2015 UTC,"i think you misunderstand. bethesda is 1 studio, with 1 team. pre-production only needs a handful of people and they have years to plan out the next game. full development of TES VI will not begin until fallout 4 is out, however by now they probably have pretty much everything written and planned out for it. we won't see another TES for like 3 years"
ElderScrolls,39vjg9,thatguythatdidstuff,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:07:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not misunderstanding, I assure you.  I know that BGS is just 1 studio.  Full development has not yet started, indeed.  Development in some respect most definitely is still going on, even beyond concepts and planning/writing at this point, for TES VI.  That is how it's been with Bethesda for every TES directly developed by them.  They've started on every TES immediately after the previous one's release, and continue regardless of what other projects the studio works on (evidenced by Fallout 3).  Working on multiple projects hasn't stopped this one studio."

Personally, because it's been almost 4 years already since Skyrim was released, I doubt that TES VI will take until 2018 to be released.  I've always been of the opinion that, because each subsequent game in the main series took a little longer to finish each time, TES VI will spend 6 years total in development (at least; from 2011 to 2017).  (ADDENDUM):  I thought there was a small chance of TES VI being teased at this year's E3, but I wasn't betting on it.  Now I'm thinking that it's all the more likely to be announced at E3 2016, partly due to Bethesda's past habit of announcing their TES games a little less than a year before releasing them."
ElderScrolls,39vjg9,YouCantTakeThisName,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:11:15 2015 UTC,"but 6 years in development would mean it would spend 2 years being physically made, and I don't know about you but that seems way too short, we'd end up getting a very small game."

ElderScrolls,39vjg9,YouCantTakeThisName,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:28:50 2015 UTC,"i really don't understand how this is so impossible for you to understand so im going to explain its simply.  theres two major stages of development, pre production and full development.   pre-production - a very small team of people in charge of researching, writing the scripts, the plots, the characters etc, getting the planning out of the way for physical development to begin.  full development - doesn't need explaining, the game is made.  bethesda work on two projects at a time. they have a handful of people doing pre-production on their next project while 95% of their team make their current one.   skyrim was in pre-production since oblivions release, the entire way through fallout 3s full development. it had a full development time of 3 years and a total production time of about 5/6 years.   fallout 4 was in pre-production the entire way through skyrims development and full production didn't begin until 2011, putting it at a total production time of 7 years.  TES VI will have been in pre-production all the way through fallout 4's delopment and won't start to be physically made until fallout 4 is released.   this is why I said 2 years, you said it will be released in 2017, which I hope for all our sakes as fans isn't true, because that is not a large amount of time for bethesda considering most of their games take double that time on average.   expect late 2018 at the very least, anything else is setting yourself up for disappointment"

Primarily...let's see, what would I like to see in it?   Wind & Sand Destruction Spells Shadow Magic (returned from TES Travels: Shadowkey, and expanded upon) Sword-Singing (Hammerfell's answer to Skyrim's ""Shouts"") Alik'r Desert = Toughest region in the game (all of the most difficult leveled enemies to be found in this harsh desert; and environmental ""death-traps"" in the form of sand-storms, red mist, etc). Nahfahlaar, a unique Red Dragon (and the only Dragon encounter in a Hammerfell-based TES).  When encountered, you could attempt to recruit him as an ally...or fight him in a unique Super-Boss battle (complete with an attack-pattern that sets him apart from all other Dragons you fight in Skyrim)."

ElderScrolls,39tsdl,_Ralchire,2,Sun Jun 14 18:40:21 2015 UTC,"Good points! I really want it set in Hammerfell. So many positives.   Human majority (I know, Morrowind blah blah blah, but historically Bethesda has seemed to prefer human provinces--maybe because it sells or maybe because they're easier) Really compelling narrative (assuming it takes place shortly after Skyrim) about the Aldmeri Dominion vs. Redguards, as well as the internal conflict of the Forebears and the Crowns. Whatever the mage's guild replacement would be, you'd have to operate in secret like in Oblivion's Thieves Guild. Drive the Aldmeri Dominion out of Hammerfell or at least try to not let them murder everybody. Or something. I'd really like to see the Redguard architecture and cities and such (I realize you can see them in ESO but... still). Palm trees would be cool as well.   I have two ideas for the player's role in the world.   My preferred option would be that the player is the seventh Shezarrine, an incarnation of Lorkhan/Shezarr. You'll see in the list of the Shezarrines that 6 are listed, each representing a letter of the word LORKHA. The N is missing. The player should be the N. A second option, and one more culturally relevant to Hammerfell, is that the player is the avatar of HoonDing, the Yokudan Make Way God, who is well-known for incarnating when the Yokudan people needed his help. Cyrus was one of these incarnates, but it's still a perfect setting for the Make Way God to make a way for his people."

The biggest sale day is always the last day. But there might also be a sale before then. You just have to keep an eye out. Check it everyday. It is a game that goes on sale a lot. So it will most likely be on sale sometime during the remaining sale days so you don't have to worry.

So untill all the DLC for Fallout 4 is done (1-2) years, I don't expect much in the way of the games engine to be worked on, only stuff like concepts and story. Once they gety a few more years (say in the 3-4 range), they might have something worth showing to the public.   Its been pretty consistent with all their releases. Show a trailer, demo game play a few weeks later at E3 and release in 6 months to a year. Add two years of DLC support then move onto next game."

It can be easy or hard, it can be modded or not, you can play as pretty much anything you want to, etc.  TES is also more light-hearted, but can be as serious as you'd like it to be.  The Witcher 3 has a little bit more challenging combat, can be modded but most of the mods are just SweetFX or some kind of cheat at this point, and you have to play as Geralt (which isn't bad at all from a story-telling point of view).  TW3 is very serious at points (though it definitely has it's funny moments).  Not everyone will go for that.  Besides, TW3 really earned the Mature rating; for TES, it is just kind of a formality.

Witcher 3 is the first RPG that felt like somewhat realistic-sized towns and villages spaced out in logical ways. However, this is harder to do when you make every single building enterable versus just having a lot of permanently locked doors in a big city."
ElderScrolls,39hv91,ifrit1100,13,Thu Jun 11 21:39:38 2015 UTC,Also ES environments are fully lootable which I imagine hinder town size in terms of game size and processing?
ElderScrolls,39hv91,SiliconSynapsed,8,Thu Jun 11 23:42:07 2015 UTC,"That's never been an issue in the past because exterior and interior cells are loaded separately, so you're never wasting processing on large, fully dynamic interior spaces when you're walking around a big town.  The real reason towns have been small in the past is, as Brobear said, TES doesn't like to take the easy way out of making some buildings mysteriously ""locked"".  So because they (thankfully) build these completely consistent worlds, it would just take too much level design effort to give the same attention to detail to a town of, say, Novigrad's size."
ElderScrolls,39hv91,TheBlackSun8,3,Fri Jun 12 02:38:46 2015 UTC,"Don't also forget that you would need to have people to inhabit said buildings and having more actors would be a significant increase in processing, especially with all the radiant stuff."

Boats  Belethor attacking his loyal customer who's much more powerful than him, just because he accidentally took his bowl. This needs to go.   Fralia Graymane attacking a warrior who is far more powerful than even the guards. Civilians attacking dragons and vampires even though they have literally no chance of survival. This also needs to go.  Have your actions affect the world around you a bit more.   Dragonborn - ""I killed the Alduin! I saved all of Skyrim and Tamriel!""  Citizens of Skyrim - ""Yeah we don't give a flying f*ck so we're going to treat you like a normal person and ask you if you've been to the cloud district very often, even though you clearly have because you're Dragonborn, Archmage, Harbinger, Thieves Guild Master, Listener, Thane of all holds and I'm just being a stupid NPC, 'cause Bethesda"".

Give nobles and merchants and citizens of bigger centres a higher chance of recognizing you if you've earned it. Let equipment affect the weighting, so legendary gear makes you more conspicuous than rags. Separate notoriety from obvious signs of non-specific badassery (giant flaming sword, glowing staff, pristine armour, etc) or potential victimhood (rags, beat up weapons, etc), so they might not recognize you but they react to something about you.

A few ways Skyrim did this was guards making new comments about your past achievements, changing that tree in White Run, and changing who controlled forts and cities in the civil war. However, I think there should be more lasting consequences that show up over time instead of just after the main quest. As is, the quest system feels more like a modular rinse-repeat without your choices mattering much once you get ""quest completed.""  I've also noticed in Witcher 3 that secondary quests branch off the main quest storyline where you can rush off after the main quest or follow-up on loose ends that arose in one of its stages. Something like this happened in Skyrim where if you got your elf contact safely out of the Thalmor embassy, you would find him later in Winterhold needing help getting out of the province. I would love to see way more of that. That's really good stuff when it comes to questing and makes a huge difference."

I usually don't ride horses much in games since I feel distanced from the environment more, but I've been using the horse a lot in this one.  I usually turn the map off, but I think the markers for plants and loot become really helpful as environments get more detailed and there's more tall grass. I could never use tall grass mods on Skyrim since I could never find bodies to loot after killing them."

I'd like to see the next ES VI incorporate the following aspects of Witcher 3: Weight of items and overburdening - things seem to weigh a reasonable amount in Witcher 3 and overburdening is rarely a serious problem. Fast travel:  It's possible in Witcher 3, but not ubiquitous (i.e. you have to use signposts, which aren't everywhere). Potions: Once you've brewed one, you'll always have a few on hand and can replenish them by resting (meditation). Gaining XP from solving quests: most quests in Skyrim were rewarded with disappointing loot and no XP / perk points.  Witcher 3 grants tons of XP for every solved quest.  I wish Witcher 3 would incorporate the following things from Skyrim, however: Houses - a place to store your loot, especially since a lot of items you collect in Witcher 3 are awesome but can't be used right away and are just adding to your weight burden.  I've not played enough through Witcher yet, so perhaps this comes later, but so far I can't seem to store my stuff anywhere. Repeatable quests: Since your primary method of gaining XP is via quests, it'd be really nice if monster slaying quests would repeat here and there with minor variances - kind of like Skyrim's  radiant quest technique.  Aren't these monsters breeding or immigrating?"

Witcher 3 grants tons of XP for every solved quest.   Giving XP for quests is not an Elder Scrolls thing. The core concept is ""the more you practice, the more you're better at it"". That's all.

They are quite different things.  I don't think ES really ""fits"" being an MMO, but that's just me."
ElderScrolls,39igjm,Mande1baum,7,Fri Jun 12 04:48:15 2015 UTC,"Despite all the flak he got for it (mostly by rabid/ear muffed fanbois), Angry Joe's review really resonated with me.   As an RPG, the questing is grossly linear/generic, a complete deviation from what has set the ES series apart for years. AJ mentions things like static environments, fetch and kill x quests, backtracking, level/gear barriers, etc. As an RPG, replayability is almost non-existent or at least heavily de-incentivized. Another huge appeal of ES games has been being able to make a number of wildly different characters, some who only do certain guilds, align with certain factions, even bother with the main story, find all the OP items in game or deliberately restrict items for a more aesthetic/realistic/challenging experience. As an RPG, most of the game is themepark without any illusion of sandbox or emergent experiences outside of world PvP. As an MMO, social/party aspects were completely lacking. From how quests were shared, bad instancing, individual objectives (which you compete for with other players and party members, hence non cooperative), difficulty scaling with number of players, different levels, if someone already completed the quest, boss spawn/camping (especially at launch), etc. Some of these have been improved, but it ends up being people playing a single player around others rather than with. As an MMO, did not have the quality/content to warrant a $15 subscription on top of box price. Compared to other MMO's like WoW, GW2, FF, Rift, etc it feel short in so many ways before adding in a higher price tag. Add on the day 1 locked race and P2W horse (many have different feelings on this, but imo being able to save tons of gold at launch through cash is a huge competitive edge, hence P2W. We're not talking a skin or like WoW where the training is the expensive part and the mount itself is affordable). Obviously sub was partially dropped, but set a huge precedence on how Zenimax would squeeze out the franchise/this game. As an MMO, can't speak for the end game or party dynamics, but I've heard about a lot of issues with class balance. Do recall lots of grief regarding the post ""max level but not really"" Veteran grind, which I think has been overhauled a couple times now. Again, ties in with replayability (why make a new character/class when you've already been forced to do all the quests for all 3 factions and still have it take forever?)   So for many, it failed as a generic RPG, let alone the higher expectations for an ES game and failed as a MMO or at least a multiplayer game. Add other nitpicks like lore, aesthetics, etc and even more   disinterest is formed."
ElderScrolls,39igjm,TheSpaceWhale,2,Fri Jun 12 06:04:26 2015 UTC,"A lot of these are good critiques (particularly the linear zones--this decision is especially perplexing given that they made half the game level-adjusting). But I don't understand the complaints about it being a ""theme park"" and ""static environments, fetch and kill x quests, backtracking."" Every Elder Scrolls game is like this. Go to a town or dungeon, talk to somebody, get a quest, fetch a thing is 90% of Skyrim. What's the differerence between a theme park and a sandbox here?"
ElderScrolls,39igjm,Mande1baum,2,Fri Jun 12 15:27:46 2015 UTC,"Sure.  Static is mostly to describe your typical ""mobs standing around waiting for you to engage them in nice respawning packets"". There's little life to the scene. Complete a quest and they are still standing around waiting for the next adventurer. Especially when it comes to the instanced quests. I think Angry Joe highlighted in his video here, where something dramatic and epic is supposed to be happening (daedra laying siege to the city), but none of that scale or urgency is conveyed through the actual gameplay. Instead npcs locked in never ending 1v1 combat, throwing the same animation at each other.  Sandbox vs Themepark mostly showed itself in public dungeons. Multiple times I'd happen upon a dungeon, go in, find nothing (sometimes other players swinging at invisible enemies), later find out that I needed a quest first, go back and now there is stuff to do. There's nothing emergent about that experience. Just the feeling that if the game didn't blatantly tell you to be there, you had no reason to be there, so you ignore them. A sandbox lets you explore at your own pace and find your own incentives (discovery, find a boss/hidden quest, loot, xp). You can have sandbox elements even within a themepark game, something the ES has excelled at in the past. It's my understanding that higher level zones improve on this, but I never got to see it. Compare to GW2 where you can happen upon things constantly and get caught up in the environment and the scale is felt much more heavily.  I know there are differences between what can be done in a single player game vs MMO, but I think games like GW2 has shown that the WoW system is dated and not the only way and hardly the best."
ElderScrolls,39igjm,TheSpaceWhale,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:52:50 2015 UTC,"Again, these seem pretty similar to any single-player game. Mobs in Skyrim stand around until you aggro them; the battle for Whiterun is pretty much you rushing in while everyone else engages in minor skirmishes. I agree ESO handles quests less fluidly (as you said you can't find the quest goal to get the quest) but this seems like kind of a minor quibble compared to the smack in the face people treat it as. I've done a lot of exploring on my own pace and found lots of unexpected things; skyshards, crafting stations, waystones, dolmens, etc.  I agree it's not as dynamic as a mainseries game, but it plays like a pretty good translation for a server environment IMO. I haven't played GW2 though; how exactly did they fix these problems?"

More patrols, some dialogue as they stand, if aggro range is larger (attack their friend 10 meters away they'll react), more ways to approach/deal with situation (stealth, booby traps, but not Skyrim's real forte). It's an immersion factor, which I felt in Skyrim but not ESO.   battle for Whiterun   Idk if you watched about a minute or so of the section I highlighted from AJ video, but if you can't distinguish the level of scale, significance, or urgency, I'm not sure what me talking about specifics will accomplish. Again, it's an argument of how immersive it is.  Immersion and intensity are why I enjoy video games. ESO just doesn't scratch that itch for me, or when it does, it's too little, too infrequently to compensate.   how exactly did GW2 fix these problems?   Big one is everything is a public quest. No pre-requisites, quest states, parties required. Within in a zone there are multiple quest chains that are constantly progressing. I think an example is best explanation.   Public event timer or trigger occurs. A major centaur attack on a helpless outpost/town. Nearby players are notified of the attack and encouraged to help. Sometimes through NPC's who run up and request help from the player. The difficulty of the quest scales with the number of players participating (more mobs, more damage/hp, better skills used by mobs). Players assist by reviving npcs, putting out fires, and obviously killing centaurs. Everyone works towards a shared ""completion meter"" of sorts. Your contributions are rewarded with xp, gold, and ""karma"" (a currency used to purchase quest rewards from npcs when you need them rather than constantly being handed gear you don't want/can't use). Eventually the players/npcs (who are actually very helpful, can be revived etc) drive off the attack. There's a brief downtime before an npc captain begins talking publicly about initiating a counter attack to avoid future attacks. A new quest begins for players to join an attack on the centaur hideout. Objectives involve killing centaurs, burning buildings, reviving players/npcs downed during the fight. After the players ravage the centaur encampment, a boss fight may trigger causing the centaur chieftain to come out and challenge the players. He'll have some boss mechanics and require moderate levels of teamwork. After the boss dies, players can find a chest inside his tent with higher tier loot. After this event, a few centaurs may linger around slowly growing in numbers until the event trigger or timer goes off again restarting the quest chain.   Few notable things about this whole mechanic/approach.   This is the most basic example and seen frequently in the starter zones. Higher level zones have more complex/difficult public quest events that require more player interaction. Players can happen upon and join the quest chain at any point. They could find it at the beginning seeing it all play out or just come in at the boss fight at the end unaware of what led to this point. Players almost never have to speak with an npc to start or complete the quest. You can go on your way to the next event without having to backtrack. You may get a mail letter saying ""thanks"". There are usually tons of npc dialogue and actions that tie the events together. Maybe some kids were throwing rocks at the centaurs instigating the attack. Listening to the captain discussing the counter attack, etc. It's very easy to miss and ignore, but for those who want a more immersive experience it's there. Sometimes you have to listen to know how to trigger the next phase (telling the captain you'd lead the counter attack for example). For those who just want to smack centaurs, they can get that experience unimpeded as well. Players are always working together. As long as you were there and helped, you'll get full credit most of the time. This instills a huge sense of cooperation and friendliness in the community. There are failure conditions as well. If the players failed to defend the town, there may be a quest chain to rebuild/restore buildings and heal the injured. If players fail to take the centaur camp, maybe they'll send another raid party on the town. Some quests move back and forth like this while others may branch or simply break when failed. These repeat making it very easy to help out a friend explore and experience the game. Down-leveling keeps it from being too trivial as well.   The whole thing just creates a very organic gaming experience. The game doesn't care if you help with the centaur attack. There's immersion, scale, and urgency. It's gonna happen with or without you, and there may be visible consequences to the world for that. It's a social experience as well. Think dolmans everywhere/all the time but tied to actual quests and not just a mob wave spawner.  While that is a very visual and obvious quest line, others are much more subtle. Some require playing detective by the players to unlock or find. Jumping puzzles, hidden paths, etc that lead to boss fights and phat loot. Puzzles that require participation from multiple players to even complete. Even with Wiki's, it's easy to feel like you've happened upon something truly hidden and missed by 95% of the players.  For example there's a key in one zone that rarely spawns on the ground in multiple locations. The first person to pick it up is only told the key must be powered up before used via the text on the key (no quest or markers). It doesn't tell you where or how to power it up. Through some exploration (or asking around), the player may notice some hidden charging pylons scattered around that require a lot of jumping and tackling difficult monsters. Upon charging up the key with the 4 pylons, you may find the place where the key is put in. This spawns access to a big boss fight that anyone nearby can participate in. Players may have even decided to help the key holder to trigger this rare event.  Other quests ramp into insane levels. Every starter zone has a huge world boss that players must trigger/spawn through a sequence of actions. It requires dozens to bring down and rewards high level gear. Higher level players can participate as they are scaled down to fit the content (though still too strong imo, which trivializes the content/experience for others).  In addition to these public events, there are stationary quest objectives (called hearts) that act mostly as compasses for players looking for something to do and often intersect the public events. There's also a single story quest line that is instanced off to you and maybe a party, but those take a back seat to public questing/exploration. Not to mention small jumping puzzles (called vistas), skill challenges (rewards similar to skyshards), and discovering points of interest which goes towards zone completion (and more phat rewards if you get 100%)."

I gave you like a baker's dozen solid critiques of flaws in the game. Maybe explain if any of the above down match your own experiences, maybe the above don't factor into a game's quality for you, and maybe most importantly point out the elements of the game you do like that I didn't touch on that offset the game's flaws.  Simply saying ""I like it"" is not conducive for discussion. Think critically about why it's fun. Compare it to what it could be, don't just settle for what is. Better, try to think critically about A LOT of things in life (why do I like this person? why don't I like this restaurant?). It may surprise you how tastes/opinions change when you think about them. Just saying ""I like it"" makes you seem not self aware and nonchalant or detached.  Just saying ""I like it"" seems like a very lowbrow response, which further agitates some as it's indicative of the target audience for the game (and so many other aspects of society, especially in entertainment and joy). ESO wasn't designed to move MMO's or video games further or employ the best design currently available, but merely capitalize on the lowest denominator. It's sad when The Hobbit and Transformers top movie sales and get any praise when they are riddled with poor film making choices.  I'm ranting and you shouldn't take it too personally. While I dislike ESO for the reasons I mentioned before, I'll still gladly discuss the merits of the game with an open mind. But deep down this is the cause for my disdain of it as it is reflective of a bad direction for both developer and consumer, and that's less of a conducive discussion. In the end it's just a game, but doesn't mean we should just settle. /rant"

For many, individually any of the above can be deal breakers, as a collective it looks like a fuster cluck.  Also can be heavily influenced by expectations based upon previous game experience. Have you played other MMO's (I especially feel GW2 is more ES than ESO)? How many ES/Fallout games? Other RPG's like Witcher 3?

ElderScrolls,39igjm,Diagorias,4,Fri Jun 12 06:19:03 2015 UTC,"Its basically a shitty generic MMO with an elder scrolls skin tacked on. The game lacks the depth and atmosphere of an actual elder scrolls game. Its pretty obvious that it wasn't made by bethesda, and zenimax tried really hard to emulate their success which utterly failed.  If they had made it co op skyrim people would have loved it. But as of now it's basically the black sheep of the elder scrolls franchise. Its existence is a demerit to elder scrolls.   Frankly it's just a low effort game made by a no name developer meant for the sole purpose of banking on the good will customers had towards an established franchise.

I got the sense that if someone approached it purely as they would any other MMO, it would be an enjoyable game.  I wanted to try it because I have been a big fan of the single player games for a long time, and coming at it from that perspective I found that it didn't really appeal to me.  So many of the things that make TES games my favorite series were absent.  I just didn't feel like I was playing an Elder Scrolls game.  I felt like you could have given it any other fantasy MMO name and renamed all the locations in the game world, and the experience would not have changed at all.  I'm not much of an MMO player, so although I had a fair amount of fun playing the betas, I didn't enjoy it enough to buy it and certainly not enough to pay a subscription fee.  I just didn't think that it would hold my interest for very long."

I like the levelling of skill trees. You don't play an mmo for a polished single player experience. It's meant for multiple people. You expect the level of polish from skyrim along with the mechanics of an MMO and it just doesn't work. They don't meld together. Of course sacrifices have to be made for this to work. You say it's ""generic and low effort"" and I simply don't see that. It's a pretty game for an mmo, the combat isn't just some stupid ""click and your toon auto attacks until they're dead"" tripe, it's actually more action orientated. You need to dodge, you need to strike. It's not some stupid roll of the dice that decides if they miss. You want to be a 2h sword wielder who specializes in heavy armor and is capable of spellcasting? You can. You want to be a thief who specializes in dual wielding and uses a bow? Go for it. You want to be a shield and sword user who just happens to dabble in mild  Sorcery? Stealth? Bow? Do it, it's your choice you make what you want.

There's also ""On Self"" which is self explanatory.  I actually like magic the best in Oblivion out of all the games. You don't have to put away two-handed weapons like bows to use it, but you can only use one spell at a time. (Dual wielding magic in Skyrim was freaking cool TBH.)  My character was a Dunmer... mage thief person? I don't know, she was kind of an all-round weapon user, 1H sword+shield, bow, destruction magic, with an emphasis on light armor and sneakiness.

Which is especially strange to me now because I just started playing Morrowind recently, and summoning up a bound spear and smacking dudes around is my primary form of combat there. Despite the wonky combat system where you miss all the time, I actually find that more enjoyable than the magic or stealth in Morrowind.  That seems oddly backwards, doesn't it? The more action-y combat system is comparatively less enjoyable than the frustrating ""swing-and-a-miss"" left click spam?  I'm not really sure why that is."
ElderScrolls,39hrwx,jmelesky,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:38:10 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about that a bit, since the topic first came up. I can only speak for myself, here, but it may be similar for you.  In Oblivion and Skyrim, you're dodging and weaving, and whenever you swing and you have a graphical collision, you hit (to varying degrees of success based entirely on stats).  In Arena and Daggerfall, you're doing some dodging and weaving, but you're also using the mouse to control whether you're swinging or slashing or thrusting or whatever. Despite that more elaborate situation, whether you hit is partially randomly determined.  Morrowind is like Arena/Daggerfall, except for two things: 1- the game is 3d, so it's a bit easier to tell when you graphically connect, and 2- you can set ""always use best attack"" and skip the mouse-swinging.  For me, Morrowind's combat (with ""best attack"") is most comfortable of all of those. I think the reason might be: it's closest to a non-action RPG. Colliding graphics rolls the dice. The monsters and npcs aren't fast or graceful, so the act of colliding is trivial. The rest is what it would be in turn-based combat.."

ElderScrolls,39fh2u,Blunderbar,6,Thu Jun 11 11:05:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with the idea of easing in. Oblivion has Skyrim's ""better"" combat (IE none of the dice roll misses from MW) but has MW's leveling mechanics. Turn off map markers that tell you exactly where to go next (not entirely possible for all missions but it's the way to go) to get a more MW style feel. The story and lore are all there and Cyrodil is a diverse enough world to get a big lore fix in. Some of the quests are very very memorable.   I'm currently playing through Morrowind for the first dedicated time in maybe a decade, and I'm super into it, but it takes the right frame of mind. Skyrim (and to a lesser extent Oblivion) puts you in a game with some optional lore scattered about. Morrowind puts you in a strange world packed to the brim with lore and stories around every corner. There is no ""marker"" telling you to ""go here and do this"" in the traditional sense (I mean sometimes there is, but it took a whole expansion pack for them to even give you that); you are incentivized to explore the world and pick apart its intricacies, and by becoming engrossed in the world, you then know what you ""should do"" next.  It looks kind of like soup, and the combat is very dice roll based, but it doesn't hold your hand at all, which means the ceiling for experimentation and experience is much higher than oblivion or Skyrim in my opinion. Very few games approach the depth and lure of Morrowind. Play it sometime.  But oblivion might be a good bet first if you liked Skyrim. It's basically more Skyrim in a different world. Just more soupy textures, blank faces, and Captain Picard."

ElderScrolls,39fh2u,All_Fanastical_Image,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:24:49 2015 UTC,I am currently finishing Oblivion (minimally modded; playing it first time) after finishing Skyrim (lightly modded also). It does not feel completely different than Skyrim. Apart from the tedious leveling system everything feels familiar. So I recommend you jump into Oblivion next.
ElderScrolls,39fh2u,MrTentacleGuy17,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:09:05 2015 UTC,Oblivion I would say after Skyrim then Morrowind and Daggerfall which I have been playing along with Oblivion and ESO . It's fun but you need to save often

My advice to anyone who has the same problem, kept emailing them until you get a response lol Nah you just have to be patient haha  Also, the usual CSO's aren't able to deal with this, you need to be referred onto a specialist. The one who dealt with me was RJ S. (Ronald) and he practically solved the problem straight away, so maybe you could just ask straight out that you get referred onto him.  Lastly, you need to keep your ESO account linked to the PSN account otherwise they won't be able to permanently unlink them.  Hope this helps someone!  Have an awesome day everybody _^"
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,AnakinGabriel,90,Wed Jun 10 17:14:02 2015 UTC,"I believe it had a lot to do with the amount of investment that you had to put into being in the world.  It's not like Skyrim, which is just ""go to map marker, kill things, return"", but instead, you had to learn about the culture of the land you were in (which was completely unlike anything else most people had ever experienced), you had to pay close attention to what people were telling you, you had to read and understand, etc.  In order to really be able to play the game, you had to get in there deep, the way that most games don't do these days.  The whole adage about it being the journey, not the destination?  That game is a very long journey.  Take, for example, one of the quests where you have to go talk to some ashlander tribes.  You don't just fast travel to some map marker and exhaust some dialog options, you have to go on a journey to get there, try to understand what they want, who they are, their history, etc., and then you have to make the journey back.  It actually feels like an adventure, and that you're in a foreign land."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,fnordx,39,Wed Jun 10 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"This right here.  You had to get deeply invested in the lore, geography, and politics to even know what you were meant to do next.    I'm not one of those players who never use quick travel in Oblivion or Skyrim.  I'll use it whenever I feel like it.  That said, back in Morrowind when you didn't have that option, you really took on the journey in a personal way.  Without map markers, you needed to look over the notes, remember what people said.  Fart around, get lost, fuck up.  There is plenty of lore available in Skyrim, but it is more on the periphery and you don't need to really absorb much of it in order to play through the quests.  Whereas in Morrowind, when you meet certain characters near the end of the main quest, they have been built up so much that it's kind of a holy shit moment.  You've read books about them, talked to hundreds of NPCs about them, etc.  Morrowind definitely has it's flaws.  But the story in it is quite excellent, and the way the game forces you to take the time to internalize it is what makes many Elder Scrolls fans call it their favourite."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,HoboSnacks,13,Wed Jun 10 19:00:25 2015 UTC,About the map/journal. Sometimes people lied or were wrong. That always got me. Like the place you were supposed to find was sometimes a little ways off from where the directions took you.
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,defythegods,10,Wed Jun 10 20:49:35 2015 UTC,"Fart around, get lost, fuck up.   The very first time I played Morrowind, I accidentally found (somewhat early) the Kogoruhn ruins and the Ordenator gear from the dead guy. I also explored a bit of the ruins themlsevs, though most monsters were still too strong for me. It was incredible, nevertheless."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Tekidek,8,Wed Jun 10 21:38:56 2015 UTC,"Or, and I'm just throwing it out here, making wildly unsafe jump potions and hurling yourself across the map. So much more satisfying than fast travel."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,mentilsoup,3,Thu Jun 11 00:15:07 2015 UTC,Enchant a ring with a single point of feather fall and there's no such thing as a dangerous jump. Unless it's into lava.

ElderScrolls,39bi1a,wdmshmo,7,Mon Jun 15 10:36:30 2015 UTC,"I agree. When I discuss this topic I always mention that Skyrim tries more to be just a plain video game, while Morrowind, though lacking in the qualities Skyrim has, really sucks you in and really tries to be part of the world it takes place in."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,rct3fan24,5,Wed Jun 10 22:06:42 2015 UTC,So we need a mix of the two games?
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,-Q24-,6,Wed Jun 10 22:40:46 2015 UTC,"That would be great, actually. Graphics and smoothness of Skyrim + immersiveness of Morrowind."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,rct3fan24,5,Wed Jun 10 22:42:37 2015 UTC,Maybe we will get that in The Elder Scrolls VI
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,-Q24-,15,Wed Jun 10 23:05:12 2015 UTC,"I hope so, but the simplifying of skyrim's formula made it a lot more accessible to a much broader audience which therefore means that it will sell better. Skyrim's replay value is actually fairly low because there is basically no opportunity cost. You can become the master of every skill and top of every guild with a single character. Want to be a part of the college of winterhold? You need to cast three spells. The rest can be done with regular weapons, but at the end of it all you are still the archmage.   Morrowind was much different. Once you joined a guild, you could only advance if you had a minimum value of a couple skills that pertained to that guild. If you wanted to advance in the mages guild, you needed to have minimum skill levels in magical skills to be given the next mission. Being in certain guilds also changes how people deal with you (being a part of the thieves guild will make the imperial legion dislike you, etc.) There are many details that Morrowind has which are absent from skyrim, and I feel like skyrim was not better off for removing them from the fomula."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Brawler215,5,Thu Jun 11 01:02:51 2015 UTC,Well there is the Skywind project in the works that is a mix of these two things. They haven't released an update on it in a while but it should be pretty incredible when it is eventually released
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,BasedGodIsJesus,2,Thu Jun 11 01:14:00 2015 UTC,"I dunno, that's not really what I had in mind. The Skywind project is cool, though.  If I'm not mistaken, Skywind is going to be Morrowind's world and story in the style of Skyrim. What I'm looking for is something like Skyrim in the style of Morrowind."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,rct3fan24,2,Thu Jun 11 01:42:44 2015 UTC,I get that. I remember reading though that you'll be able to turn of your map markers and fast travel though so that should make it a bit more of an authentic morrowind experience

ElderScrolls,39bi1a,BasedGodIsJesus,5,Thu Jun 11 17:24:58 2015 UTC,"I have very fond memories of talking to characters with the map next to me trying to figure out where to go. I remember one of the main quests, you had to find some ruins to the north of the map. I got so lost I spent a couple days wandering around the area before finally finding it.   I remember creating a custom spell, walking into a town or building and killing everyone with a single blast."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Madcatz7,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:29:49 2015 UTC,"Oh man, back in the days when you played with an actual paper map to reference. It was so arcane and imprecise, but there were also subtle details that helped you figure out where you were and what you were looking for."

There is nostalgia also, as Morrowind was the first TES game on consoles, but it also didn't dumb itself down at any point, and was beautiful for that. Could I play it today? Hell no. Would they be wise to make another with the same systems? Not financially speaking. But I do think my daughter is experiencing a worse world than I because this won't be a thing she's into at the age I found it."

ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Rosario_Di_Spada,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:56:42 2015 UTC,Well the lack of fast travel kind of forced you to take a journal between every objective.

I always loved playing the game as a low level character and taking on a quest that was on the other side of the island. By the time I'd get to the quest location/a town near it, I'd feel like a grizzled veteran, with banged up armor and weapons from all the random creatures I'd found on the way and the locations I'd explored, and I would be a few levels higher than when the journey started, and boy does leveling make you feel like your character has gotten more powerful each time. I miss the days when more games were like that..."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,predalienmack,21,Thu Jun 11 06:46:02 2015 UTC,"It's a lot more immersive even without graphics and voice acting. Skyrim at least had some character to it with thalmor and nord conflict, talos worship, and dark elf quarter going on, and the story behind the forsworn.   But everywhere you went in Morrowind there were cultural differences you had to understand, so that was cool.   It wasn't just ""nords vs elves"" it was ""imperial influence versus dark elves' sense of cultural independence and then those dark elves versus the other dark elves who accept imperial rule and then elves who like or dislike the tribunal and then Ashlanders who do their own thing"". It was really hard to sum up why exactly this faction might hate that faction, which makes it interesting to learn about.   As opposed to ""mean elves took our land Skyrim belongs to the nords!"""

ElderScrolls,39bi1a,thebeef24,10,Tue Jun 16 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"Without quest markers you really had to pay attention to the world around you.  ""I need you to get me this artifact.  It's in a cave.

ElderScrolls,39bi1a,hircine1,3,Wed Jun 10 21:14:43 2015 UTC,Trying to find a particular dwemer ruin for a quest for 3 hours was the the most fun I ever had in a game as I came across a few sidequests along the way too. It really felt like an accomplishment when I finally found the ruin. A little frustrating but better than boring quest markers and fast travel. Games for everyone are such a dull adventure half way through.
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,krillarbran,6,Fri Jun 12 02:14:07 2015 UTC,"well, give yourself time, but the story of the main story line is probably one of the best i have ever seen..."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,dfritsch86,8,Wed Jun 10 18:03:22 2015 UTC,"I loved it because the game didn't really set many limits on itself. Players could get creative with spells, potions, and equipment to ascend to new levels of greatness. Though the fast travel is horrible I once drank 50 speed potions I had crafted and after attempting to walk a single step found myself at the other side of the world. Its a true RPG environment as all characters main or otherwise can be murdered and you can live however you please. Go find yourself a house, murder that person and claim it as your own, then fill with lanterns. There's a lot more than meets the eye with Morrowind. Skyrim now takes the cake for me but that's mainly due to the mod community."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Perrykgreene,4,Wed Jun 10 19:04:45 2015 UTC,"The immersion was fantastic! The world was alien! Most has already been said but forcing you to take long journeys was great. There was a lot of down time but in that day, this was more common in games. I think at least with TES6 if they go for Argonia, they'll return to their roots with the alien landscape thing at least, which I'm looking forward to. Also note that in the first version of morrowind, you couldn't even see your enemies health! It was added later in a patch."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,amazzy,3,Wed Jun 10 20:45:30 2015 UTC,Part of the reason why people praise it so much has a lot to do with nostaligia. Otherwise it was very good RPG for its time.

ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Kinganubis2,5,Wed Jun 10 17:27:25 2015 UTC,"No fast travel or arrow pointing you where to go, is a big one for me. You had to think. Like, I remember having this JPEG saved in my Mods folder that had a flow chart that mapped out the boat system and which ones you needed to take in order to get to a specific town or area. Same with the Silt Strider. It just made the map feel realistic and much bigger, with out the allure of just clicking the icon on the map.  That mixed with the culture that people have been saying, as well as, the fact that almost every single city was super unique, make a WONDERFUL adventure. I cannot tell you how much I loved having to try and find things. Caldera, for example. I used to go and raid that plantation for the expensive gear early on and you had to use a sense of direction to find anything. Easily 10/10, best Elder Scrolls game yet."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Dooflatchie,2,Wed Jun 17 11:34:26 2015 UTC,Because it's the first Elder Scrolls game that most people played and they look back on it fondly.
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Pishwi,2,Thu Jun 11 02:34:36 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that there was no fast travel (barring silt striders and boats) really gave you a sense of how vast it was. I can't remember if there were quest markers or not, but often you had to go out and find things on your own, and there were certainly wrong choices to be made as well as right. Everything, when done right, gave you a sense of achievement. Even killing a rat.  On top of that, it had the best environments by far in my opinion, and Skyrim did well to replicate that in Dragonborn"
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Raze321,2,Wed Jun 10 18:33:16 2015 UTC,"There were no quest markers, you just had to be good at following directions"
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,thebeef24,2,Wed Jun 10 20:36:02 2015 UTC,"You could also use recall spells and scrolls. I like that it required forethought, and with the enchanting and spellcrafting systems those abilities weren't isolated to just mages. It was a big moment when I realized all my brutish warrior had to do was invest his piles of adventuring money into crafting rings of mark and recall, and another with 100 points of unlock for good measure."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,LeMAD,3,Thu Jun 11 00:57:09 2015 UTC,"The game has aged a lot now. It used to be my favorite game, but I'm unable to play nowadays because the mechanics feel outdated.  But 10+ years ago? It was revolutionary. It had the best graphics I'd ever seen, the world they have created is still awesome by modern standards (and much better than Oblivion), it had a good story, and it was pretty much to first modern open world RPG.  Of course Skyrim is better in every aspects now."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,ON3i11,6,Tue Jun 16 14:13:23 2015 UTC,"Of course Skyrim is better in every aspects now.   Except quests. Oh and armour customization, and weapon selection."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,LeMAD,-1,Wed Jun 10 18:51:05 2015 UTC,"The quests in Morrowind are just terrible. That's one of the things I couldn't stand in my last playthrough. You are constantly running around and using quick travel do to useless fetch quests between cities. Especially in guilds.  There are some fetch quests in Skyrim, but it's more seemless and more rewarding.  As for armor and weapons, it's more cosmetic than anything, considering how weak Morrowind's combat system is."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,gingerdeer,4,Thu Jun 11 00:39:41 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. Skyrim's quests are 'hey, I have lost X in Y draugr ruin', or 'I have x problem, to solve it, go to Y draugr ruin'. They completely lack the depth that quests from Morrowind and Oblivion have. The fetch quests in Morrowind are typically early guild quests, which makes sense, because you're not important enough to do anything else. The guild quests in Skyrim? You do a couple of quests and then bam, you're the new leader.  Couple that with the handcrafted dungeons and carefully placed loot, Morrowind feels like a world worth exploring. As for Oblivion, the quests in that are at least unique and quirky. I enjoy almost all the quests in that game, as they all feel unique."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,LeMAD,-2,Thu Jun 11 01:31:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know when was it the last time you played Morrowind, but I finished it (again) last year and it wasn't fun. Quests and dungeons in particular were terrible. By modern standards, Skyrim is the only one out of the 3 that still feels fun exploring, because the dungeons are much more interesting that in the first 2. The outside world of Morrowind is still pretty gret though.  As for Oblivion, the game was just a failure. I tried really hard to like it when it came out, but it was worse than Morrowind in every category but combat, and combat was still pretty weak. The game looks awful, the levelling system is broken, dungeons are all the same, the outside world is always the same, etc.  The story is a bit better than Skyrim maybe, but that's not the point of TES, or videos games in general. (I still haven't played a game with a legitimatly good story)."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,gingerdeer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:21:33 2015 UTC,"The last time I played Morrowind? checks Steam about four days ago. Been working on a new Nerevarine, trying to decide if she fits my canon better than my oldest one. I also played Oblivion last month and had an absolute ball with a couple of characters, Katah, a CoC who went into a spiral of depression after certain events at the end of the main quest, and a daedric researcher who collected all the artifacts, then went off to become Duchess of Mania. These two games allow for a world where you can make characters that react to their environment, and develop into characters with their own minds. I struggled throughout my many hours in Skyrim to find a character who truly felt changed by the events or quests of the game. They were lifeless, and so were my characters.  Skyrim has become my least favourite TES game, below MW, Oblivion and ESO, for those exact reasons.  But if you think that stories aren't the point of video games, then we differ fundamentally, and will have to agree to disagree. For me, gameplay has always been secondary to story. I recently played ME1 and 2, and despite hating the gameplay (I'm awful at shooters, especially third person), they became some of my favourite games for their stories. Likewise, the Bioshock series is one of my favourites, but I'm awful at them and don't really enjoy the combat.  There is one thing that I have to say is wrong about what you said, though. The dungeons in Morrowind are not terrible, they are the best in the series. Why? Because unlike Skyrim and Oblivion, whose dungeons feel endless and are full with randomised loot, Morrowind dungeons are handcrafted. They are not huge, because they were made as places that actually once had a function, and so weren't needed to be massive, unlike all the endless caves in Oblivion. And the fact that I can wander into any old place and perhaps find one of the best items in the game, forgotten to time? THAT is what makes exploring so good in that game. Hell, my most recent playthrough I just happened to come across both the Ice Blade of the Monarch and Chrysamere on a journey, two of the best weapons in the game. That same journey in Oblivion and Skyrim would have netted me a Steel Sword of Flames or a Ring of Fire Resistance, randomly generated garbage."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,ON3i11,-1,Sun Jun 14 14:58:34 2015 UTC,"Well TBH I haven't gotten that far into Morrowind.  I feel like Oblivion has much better quests then Skyrim, and I figured Morrowind's quests would have been even more in depth then Oblivion, but I guess not."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,LeMAD,2,Mon Jun 15 00:32:24 2015 UTC,"It's not that Oblivion had better quests than Skyrim, it's just that Skyrim wasn't an improvement over Oblivion in that category. Same for the story in general. It just never have been a strenght of the series.  And while the quests and story were the main weakness of Skyrim, it could be considered to main strenght of Oblivion, as so much was wrong with other aspects of that game."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,drekstorm,5,Thu Jun 11 01:47:26 2015 UTC,and much better than Oblivion   The karma nostalgia mob is gonna get you even though you are right.
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Lirael,7,Thu Jun 11 02:08:02 2015 UTC,"I find that really funny because when Oblivion first came out I just remember all the crying about how it wasn't as good as Morrowind, wahh bloo bloo potato faces, boo hoo so shallow, etc.  And of course now people compare Skyrim unfavorably to Oblivion using a lot of the same arguments. You have to laugh."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,drekstorm,3,Wed Jun 10 21:19:46 2015 UTC,Very true. The smaller number of skills as a good move for Oblivion so that all skills have a little more weight and feel different. The way the used level scaling and random generation was step back though.
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Lirael,5,Wed Jun 10 23:19:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think each of the TES games has areas in which they excel and the odd misstep/step backwards. I like the three of them very well and I think they each have their charms, the circle of criticism just makes me chuckle. I have no doubt that there will be a legion of Skyrim purists making the same arguments when the next TES comes out."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,drekstorm,2,Wed Jun 10 23:30:06 2015 UTC,Sure they will. I just do not understand the major fanboyism over Oblivion. It is a fantastic game but it seemed to me when I played it upon realease to be the worst of the series. I think mostly cause its flaws were more obvious than due to it being objectively bad.
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Lirael,2,Wed Jun 10 23:38:48 2015 UTC,"It definitely had its problems, but it was still a very fun game with a lot to offer even before the modders sank their teeth into it fully. I think Skyrim fared better on release because most of its janky flaws were completely hilarious where Oblivion's were legitimately irritating. Oblivion took a hammering over nickel and diming people for crappy DLC early on, too. I can see how it left some people with a bad taste in their mouth at the time.   All that said, I do still see it as the weakest of the three and like you, I'm not sure why the fanboyism."

Morrowind is my favorite game of the series because it isn't a take your hand and follow this and that, you get to learn and move around the land doing what ever whenever - Also I thought it had more fun loot to find and secret treasures, and just some of the magic that you get to use is so much more fun than the simple magic you get to use in newer games.  I could go on forever, Morrowind is the best."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,thebeef24,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:51:07 2015 UTC,"OP, I hope you'll take one thing from these responses: don't use a guide. Don't look stuff up when you're stumped. Just play it.   Other than that, here's my two cents. The game graphics weren't amazing when it came out, either. The world was unique and could be pretty sometimes. The characters were butt ugly. Neither has changed. I was already into the modding scene then from other games, so the first thing I sought out was a face overhaul. The mechanics were a little clunky then, too. Maybe we were more used to clunky mechanics, but that didn't mean we weren't frustrated sometimes with the combat system. I can promise that the swishing gets better as you level and eventually goes away with skill. This game was never really about the combat, though, and I think some of us found a kind of pleasure in finding exploits to get around annoying features. Actually, I think exploits and taking advantage of the mechanics of the game world are a huge part of Elder Scrolls. After all, look at the bucket trick in Skyrim. In Morrowind. For instance, I leveled my combat skill quickly by smacking on a guy in a house in Balmora, then waiting until he healed to do it again. I got sick of cliff racers, so I sought out the master crossbow trainer in the wilderness and spent my hard-earned cash on getting enough skill to hit every time. Not an exploit, but an unorthodox solution, and this game allowed and I think encouraged unorthodox solutions. I used to run into tombs that were too high level and loot the containers while dodging enemies, and thanks to the unleveled looting system I found gear strong enough so eventually I could stand and fight instead. I also used my adventuring money to make godlike enchantments that let me unlock everything, teleport, and levitate. Those were so overpowered but I felt like I earned them, both by paying for them and for the wits to come up with them on my own. I've played other games that are better in many ways, but this was by far the most rewarding."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,DrewZee-DC,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"These days it's mostly nostalgia, but when this game first came out it was easily the best RPG of it's time. The lore is fantastic, since the game really makes you learn about the people and places you travel to. The graphics have not aged well, and the mechanics can feel outdated and annoying, especially in combat.   Still, it's a pretty good game, even by todays standards."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,krillarbran,2,Tue Jun 16 14:34:02 2015 UTC,"Installing morrowind overhaul 3.0 mod compilation will solve the dated graphics issue, but the game mechanics and physics it does not. The overhaul really gives the game a feeling of freshness if you plan to play again."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,awesomejim123,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:49:56 2015 UTC,"Nostalgia, I think. I played Skyrim first, followed by Oblivion and Morrowind, and I'd rank them Skyrim > Morrowind > Oblivion.  People will commonly say it's more immersive due to no fast travel, no quest markers, but in my opinion those are nothing more than annoyances. I can get emotionally invested in and immersed into Skyrim within 10 minutes of starting, something that all ES games are able to accomplish. The outdated mechanics and lack of commonplace features are not factors in this, but rather the look and feel of the hand crafted world, or the scores of options and freedom you have. All ES games are fantastic."
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,Superioupie,2,Fri Jun 12 02:20:07 2015 UTC,"Skyrim had absolutely NO emotional hold on me. In fact I thought the whole premise of the game & the plot was silly & childish. The game has zero replayability, as you can become master of every single guild playing as the same character. I can be arch mage with a magic skill of an orc blacksmith. every quest was ""go to dungeon A & find book B & kill hoards of draugr."" so repetitive & monotonous. aside for graphics, Skyrim had everything wrong IMO."

ElderScrolls,39bi1a,rct3fan24,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:24:00 2015 UTC,"Many reasons have already been listed here, one reason for me is that not having voice actors means they could have as much dialogue as they wanted, and they took advantage of that. Some sections of the game were like excerpts from a really good novel. That kind of writing is still present in skyrim and oblivion in the books you can read, so it's a good thing that they haven't abandoned that value in any sense"
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,BanjoStory,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:34:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the problem with Oblivion and Skyrim regarding voice acting is that it limits what the NPC can say. You only get like 3 or 4 dialogue options when talking to any random NPC, but in Morrowind, most people you could ask basically ANYTHING, and they'll give you an answer, even if that answer is basically just ""Shove off."""
ElderScrolls,39bi1a,predalienmack,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:54:39 2015 UTC,"For me, it's the environment. I had never been in a more engrossing world. From the landscape, to the characters, to the flora, to the monsters... All of it was so alien. The world felt huge, too. It felt like I could explore forever and never run out of new things to find.  To this day, I've never actually beaten the main storyline. I've got probably 2000+ hours across countless characters and I don't think I've ever even been close.  I still recommend that people play it with oy bugfix mods first. The character models are ugly as shit, but you lose a lot of the wonder of that world when you increase the draw distance. The fog is one of the best uses of hardware limitation, ever."

The music, overall look of the world, the plants, ash storms, the different landscapes of the various regions of the world, the changing opinions towards the PC based on what factions you were a part of, etc. all lent weight to this aspect of the game and really helped me as a player immerse myself in the world."

ElderScrolls,39cgbc,Contagious_Cure,5,Fri Jun 12 09:49:51 2015 UTC,North would be similar to Morrowind. West would be similar to Cyrodiil. The East is a coastline (perhaps with ruined landing sites from the past Akaviri invasions?). The middle ranging from swamps and marshes to dense poisonous forests. I think there's room for a lot of variety in landscapes. Not sure why everyone thinks it would be boring.
ElderScrolls,39cgbc,lumpy999,3,Thu Jun 11 04:54:57 2015 UTC,I think they could make Argonia quite relatable.  They should have it  feature a bit of Morrowind and Cyrodill during anti Argonian campaign.  Throughout the game you can witness many atrocities and get to understand all three sides as to why they're fighting.
ElderScrolls,39cgbc,YouCantTakeThisName,3,Thu Jun 11 01:20:31 2015 UTC,"I have no doubts that a TES set in Black Marsh/Argonia would give us a different ""alien"" feel to their culture and world.  It would (should) be on the same level of wonder and amazement as Morrowind, but on a different level of bizarre than Morrowind (after all, Argonia isn't filled with ash-storms and desolate-looking landscapes).  Also:  If you ask me, I think the next TES should focus more on the world itself, like Morrowind did, specifically on the interesting society of the Saxhleel and Hist...instead of being relatively more player-centric like Oblivion and Skyrim were."
ElderScrolls,39cgbc,-Q24-,2,Thu Jun 11 13:11:25 2015 UTC,I think yes it has a lot of potential and it will be good it they play it right. Also I prefer Argonians and Khajits to Dunmer.
ElderScrolls,39cgbc,Ornaren,2,Wed Jun 10 22:48:29 2015 UTC,"""we've been taught to look down on the Argonians and Khajiit (not to mention they look like animals), versus the Dunmer who evoke a noble elvish presence""  Really? It was the opposite for me. Morrowind showed me most of the elves being huge bigoted assholes, while making me sympathetic to the plight of the Argonians. I mean, they held them as slaves and saw them as dirt. Would be kinda strange to see that as something to the Dunmer's credit.  Anyway, I'd be thrilled to have a game set in Black Marsh. Argonians don't get enough love in the games, and they seem pretty easy to identity with for me, if that even matters. Definitely more-so than the Dunmer."
ElderScrolls,39cgbc,Saeta44,2,Thu Jun 11 19:07:07 2015 UTC,"With the Hist involved, yes, it could be a very interesting and unique game.  Sentient trees, far more than meets the eye. They are a remnant of a previous world, like the Dreugh."

But, the backstory of their religious beliefs is very deep and complicated, that's what makes it interesting.  Morrowind is inspiring because of the otherworldly setting and attention to detail.  Cyrodil and Skyrim could have been that way too if enough care had been taken.  (There's a reason everyone loves Blackreach.)  Argonians and Khajiit both have their own unique culture that can be MUCH richer than ""lol thieves"" if Bethesda cares to explore it in depth."

Oblivion is great too but doesn't have a ton of spread lore into other games that I am aware of. It does have a lot of odd quirks and might have somethings that are down right irritating to some people. It is a great game. Kinda like that great uncle at a family reunion that tickled you till you were 15. You love him and is a great guy inspire of how he irritated you. To be honest the game's biggest flaw is the level up system. It was mostly what Morrowind did but they also implemented a level scaling mechanism so that monsters can still challenge the player as they level up. I would recommend that you look up a level up guide for the game before playing or you could get really frustrated later. Oblivion's setting is a fantasy euro landscape built on top of a lost Elven society.   Skyrim is the most modern of all of them and has a very free form level system that removed classes and attributes so that you can have your character progress as you choose to. The setting is pretty much Vikings versus dragons. A lot of people cite its writing as a great weakness of the game.  Morrowind is great, but it is kinda old now. The graphics while they were passable at the time look pretty bad now. That can be modded out. However the combat though it looks live action uses dice rolls to hit.which can be bad. Especially because you miss fairly often early in the game. There are also no modern fast travel systems and no quest or objective markers. Morrowind's strongest point however is probably its setting. The setting is pretty alien (with flora and fauna that do not exist else where in the game world)and there are many cultures in it, two different religions and many people say its story is great.  Really pick a game that seems appealing start playing. These games can be pretty immersive if you let them be."
ElderScrolls,39dmg7,drekstorm,4,Thu Jun 11 03:18:11 2015 UTC,You should start with oldest and work your way up.  It's a lot easier to go from old graphics to new graphics than it is to do the reverse.

ElderScrolls,397y4v,Illsonmedia,3,Tue Jun 9 22:18:52 2015 UTC,Oblivion is my favorite. I have tons of time put into games 3-5 but Morrowind is too tedious for me now and Skyrim doesn't seem to draw me in. The NPCs in skyrim don't feel like they have lives. They feel like they are there to service the player which I dislike. I also didn't enjoy the main storyline or many of the major side quests. I love the multiple outcome side quests of oblivion and how unique and alive the NPCs feel. I also feel like Oblivion holds your hand just the right amount. It is my favorite by far despite growing up on morrowind primarily.
ElderScrolls,397y4v,SC2_Bench,3,Wed Jun 10 14:48:24 2015 UTC,"I still love Oblivion. The main quest line wasn't too cheesy like skyrim. The land seemed endless & beautiful.

ElderScrolls,392t8h,vhisic,3,Tue Jun 9 03:11:11 2015 UTC,It's still $60 or $80 depending on which version you purchase.
ElderScrolls,392t8h,mishugashu,2,Mon Jun 8 23:15:07 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying, though, is that it doesn't matter if you spend 2 hours playing in a week or 50. If you buy it now, you can play now.

ElderScrolls,392t8h,Capt0bv10u5,3,Mon Jun 8 23:34:24 2015 UTC,Opportunity cost. There could be other more enjoyable things to spend that money on now and wait until I get paid later in the year or next year to buy it.

ElderScrolls,392t8h,NickMotionless,2,Tue Jun 9 12:05:08 2015 UTC,"That's true, if you're not set on the game. But that's a highly subjective thing, and I wouldn't take the word of strangers on it, personally.  I can only give you my experience and thoughts and let you decide: I bought the game pre-order (against my better judgement after playing the beta) and played maybe a week or two. The MMO is fairly generic, and it seemed like the higher levels were just about PvP, which I am not really too fond of. The one thing I did like about it is the sheer amount of lore they put into pretty much every facet of the game. If you love lore, you'll definitely enjoy yourself. If you're looking for a comprehensive and outstanding MMO, or even a multiplayer Skyrim/Oblivion/Morrowind/whatever, it's probably not your style. Just my two cents on the game by itself, not even factoring in opportunity cost.  I've been playing mostly Final Fantasy XIV lately, and I don't regret it at all. I'm fully engrossed in the game, and there's fixing to be an expansion release. Unfortunately, for you, it's subscription based.  All in all, if I wasn't hooked on FFXIV, I would probably pick up Witcher 3. I'm already past the ""buy it"" barrier on ESO and it's not even worth my time. Personally."

ElderScrolls,392t8h,Dooflatchie,3,Tue Jun 9 01:11:55 2015 UTC,"As somebody who has played numerous MMORPGs across the years I'll give you my honest opinion on The Elder Scrolls Online in a brief amount of space.   The Game has a pretty well written storyline as far as solo questing goes, but party questing is a huge let down because the quests get almost their whole entertainment value out of exposition, so get ready to listen to a lot of talking - questing in a party is lame because teamwork is essentially nonexistant. The Dungeon content works in groups of four and is reasonably challenging and fun, and not overly lengthy but prepare for some wipes that will make the dungeon longer. The reason to prepare for wipes is because the freedom the game gives players leads to a lot of people having terrible builds that aren't very powerful.' The grandscale world PvP is pretty intense and fun but horribly imbalanced, you basically have to look up a successful build on the internet to be competitive so it pretty much rips the fun out of the skill system   MY answer to your question (tl;dr): Buy it if you are REALLY into story mode solo content, and by story mode I mean little to no action and all talking. The PvP is fun but not worth the rest."
ElderScrolls,392t8h,Siggins,3,Tue Jun 9 05:41:52 2015 UTC,"Buy it if you are REALLY into story mode solo content, and by story mode I mean little to no action and all talking.   So it's a Bioware game, lol"
ElderScrolls,392t8h,YouCantTakeThisName,2,Mon Jun 8 21:56:57 2015 UTC,"If you want to treat it as a single-player Elder Scrolls game, you can.  Most of the content can be completed solo.  If you want to just log on and do a few quests every night, that's totally possible.  Keep in mind that this game, in many people's opinions, is inferior to the single player Elder Scrolls games."

Its not like anyone is forcing you to buy them, they're clearly popular since they get purchased, and it doesn't take away much development time or resources since its often newer teams that do it rather than main Dev teams. Admittedly it would be better if more rereleases were like Windwaker HD than some of the ones that are literally just upscaled but its fine"
ElderScrolls,391h7f,TheStradivarius,0,Tue Jun 9 14:06:37 2015 UTC,It's not about been forced to buy them. I wouldn't anyway because I'm a PC gamer and we don't get these rereleases. The problem with this crap is that developers waste their time on redoing their old games instead of making completely new ones just because people bought new consoles and still want to play their old games. Want to play Oblivion? Don't sell your PS 3 or buy a PC.
ElderScrolls,391h7f,Otaku_swag94,2,Tue Jun 9 15:09:06 2015 UTC,"Lots of HD remasters are done by different teams, and they don't waste much time since very little is usually changed. They can be good as a revenue source that actually frees up resources for developers and there's obviously demand for them.  Now I do agree that Oblivion doesn't need a remaster since its on PC, but many remasters are of console exclusive games."

ElderScrolls,38wyx3,drekstorm,50,Sun Jun 7 15:28:44 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from, but I disagree slightly. I believe the Skyrim DB quest line is cheapened but for a different reason. Yes, in Oblivion, we see the emperor get assassinated. But, we see very significant consequences of his death. In Skyrim, however, once the DB assassinates the emperor, business in Skyrim continues as usual. There is no consequence or sense that such an event as death of an emperor has taken place. I mean yes, you'll hear a few townspeople mention it, but that's it. That's my problem with the quest.   May the Night Mother wrap you in her cold, loving embrace."
ElderScrolls,38wyx3,Teekei-Na,13,Sun Jun 7 15:40:40 2015 UTC,You would think that after having their emperor assassinated they'd put out the biggest manhunt possible and pack Skyrim with soldiers. This gives me an idea for a mod!

The Empire has no reason to go broadcasting that the emperor was assassinated, particularly not given the political environment.  Besides that, Uriel Septim (and particularly his death) was important to the fate of all Tamriel. Titus Mede II was a powerful man but not nearly as important. Unlike the last of the Septims, the current emperors are replaceable."
ElderScrolls,38wyx3,STRiPESandShades,21,Sun Jun 7 22:48:07 2015 UTC,"That the Septim dynasty was wiped out is the big deal. Nobody cares that one guy from the unloved Mede dynasty, who hardly rule over anything but Cyrodiil, got killed."
ElderScrolls,38wyx3,Khepresh,14,Sun Jun 7 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"I always felt that the quest experience in Skyrim as a whole felt somewhat cheapened by the 'fallen on hard times' plot/cliche.  Thieves' Guild? Fallen on hard times, barely existing these days.  Companions? Famed axe broken and lost, tainted with lycanthropy, Harbinger busy dying.  College of Winterhold? Existant and going strong, but everyone hates them.  I definitely miss being a part of a Guild that is whole and not rife with problems I have to fix."
ElderScrolls,38wyx3,lordpieman,10,Mon Jun 8 02:19:55 2015 UTC,"I understand what they were going for, but... to me, it felt less like I was helping to restore each guild to glory, and more like I was the only competent person amongst a bunch of total losers.  I think Skyrim suffered greatly from all the content that got cut out to release on time.  The additional Civil War content & mechanics, and especially the time travel plot that was scrapped for the College of Winterhold.  You can do so much in Skyrim, but it all ultimately feels hollow with no consequences or impact at the end of each quest."
ElderScrolls,38wyx3,Khepresh,5,Mon Jun 8 07:13:21 2015 UTC,"Time travel plot? I never knew about this. God, the College of Winterhold questline felt so empty.  ""Hey look a huge orb""  ""Go grab these books from this castle""  ""Go talk to this guy underground""  ""And whoopdie doo, Aren's dead""  ""Congrats, you are now the Arch Mage of the fabled bloody college of Winterhold""  It was really way too rushed, and a time travel plot would've been great, plus it would've made a lot of sense. When you first see the Phsijic Order in Saarthal the man you speak to tells you: ""A great disaster is going to happen which you must prevent."" And then you can't."
ElderScrolls,38wyx3,lordpieman,3,Mon Jun 8 15:50:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you originally were going to go back in time to see/prevent the cataclysm.  By preventing it from happening, then returning to the present, the city of Winterhold would be ""rebuilt"" (that is, it's never destroyed in the first place), which would have actually added some impact to your actions and really justified you becoming Arch Mage.  I mean, who want's to be Arch Mage of a run-down magic school, in a largely empty & ruined town, where everybody hates you?  I'm really sad that so much content got cut from the game.  :/"

Sure now that the Dragonborn is with them they're still technically more powerful by the end of the arch, but aside from the PC if anything they've been made weaker. tl;dr: Point of story is to make the DB stronger. They were weaker by the end. Lame"

ElderScrolls,38vqvs,Lord_Wibblington,2,Sun Jun 7 12:07:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's a great Elder Scrolls MMO. It doesn't have quite the freedom and interactability of a main ES game, but it's pretty close. Most of the constraints are due to the nature of the genre and IMO good design choices--main Elder Scrolls games have a lot of systems that are quite frankly broken and very exploitable. ESO is constrained for good reason--multiplayer games need to be balanced.  I don't think you need to like MMOs to like it. The game does a good job hybridizing in freedom and role-playing opportunities from the main series, and it plays a lot more like a lot of single player RPGs than other MMOs. That said, it doesn't offer quite the same depth. Broader and shallower.  Ignore the haters--they nail the lore and setting as good as any ES games. No idea where that criticism came from except diehard fans upset someone other than Bethesda was developing the lore (as if that's a first for TES). I mostly play for lore and exploration and it pays off in spades.  I'd really recommend giving it a go. Worst case you'll be disappointed. Best case you'll love it as some new Elder Scrolls to tide you over until 6 comes along. That's certainly been my experience."

This is a fact.  Zenimax media Inc is 25% owned by Providence equity.  The board of directors overall are not really a part of the gaming industry    I do recall that one of the board members is Movie producer Jerry Bruckheimer.   So when ever I hear people talking about Bethesda like they are independent or that Todd Howard owns it it irks me.  For example Bethesda had nothing to do with the decision making on paid mods with valve.  That was done by board members.  They also set release dates and budgets for games.  Bethesda has no say in this.   At least toward it's board of directors.  Robert Altman  the chairmen was the original bug head when Bethesda was just a small gaming and publishing company.  The company's Board of Directors consists of 8 individuals:  Robert A. Altman (Chairman & CEO) Ernest Del (President) Jerry Bruckheimer (Jerry Bruckheimer Films) Michael Dominguez (Managing Director, Providence Equity Partners Inc.) Leslie Moonves (President & CEO, CBS Corporation) Cal Ripken, Jr (President & CEO, Ripken Baseball, Inc.) Harry E. Sloan (Chairman, Silver Eagle Acquisition Corp; former Chairman and CEO of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer).[22] Robert S. Trump (President, Trump Management, Inc.; brother of Donald Trump)[23] Note: Todd Hollenshead, the Former President of id Software, is not listed in the ZeniMax Board of Directors on the official ZeniMax website nor do the recent filings mention him, but Hollenshead was a ZeniMax Board member according to a 2009 filing by ZeniMax. It is unknown what period he was a Director.[24]  Other board members in the past included Mark Schneider, the former Chairman and CEO of United Pan-Europe Communications, Inc., as well as Christopher Weaver.[25][26]  So you have Donald trumps brother to thank for our awesome games as well.

ElderScrolls,38p8k7,LynxOfTheWastes,10,Fri Jun 5 18:34:35 2015 UTC,"Firstly, disregard anyone who tells you to ignore a game because it's old, or ""hasn't aged well"". They're not real gamers.  That being out of the way, you should definitely play Oblivion. Play it a couple times in vanilla as a warrior, thief/assassin/cheeki breeki, and mage. Go through the related factions, do a couple side quests, then the main quest. Even without mods, Oblivion outshines Skyrim just with the quality of it's factions and side quests.  Once you get into Oblivion modding, that's when things get even more fun. Skyrims' modding community is primarily in the US and UK, although there are exceptions. Oblivion's community was equal parts US, Japan, Russia, and Germany. One of the basic requirements for advanced modding is a several gigabyte large Japanese compilation of races. Deadly Reflex v5 is the most used combat mod, and makes Skyrim's combat look like the weapons are made of rubber. Midas Magic is several times better in Oblivion, featuring everything from a spell that heals you continuously while standing still, to tossing a nuke at your enemies. OCO v2 also makes Oblivion's potato headed characters looks better than in any other Elder Scrolls game, or Bethesda's two Fallouts."
ElderScrolls,38p8k7,LynxOfTheWastes,3,Fri Jun 5 20:44:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you this is the most helpful comment I got. but I only see Deadly Reflex 6.0, do they differ much?"
ElderScrolls,38p8k7,LynxOfTheWastes,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:59:31 2015 UTC,"V6 is buggy because of it's changes to the first person camera. If you search for deadly reflex on the nexus, you should find an omod ready v5."
ElderScrolls,38p8k7,YouCantTakeThisName,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:11:15 2015 UTC,Are there kill moves or Is there a mod that adds them or a mod like Violens for skyrim
ElderScrolls,38p8k7,justkirk,3,Sat Jun 6 10:48:46 2015 UTC,"Not quite. It's not like in skyrim where you have a chance to do a special animation whenever you kill something. You can cut people's heads or hands off, or cut them in half at the waist with bladed weapons. You can crush their heads with blunt weapons. You can also stab people when they're on the ground, or instantly kill them while asleep. There's also a complicated stealth kill system where you can cut people's throats from behind while sneaking, but you need a high sneak and blade to be successful. You can also do an ambush attack by doing the same thing as throat cutting but from a distance. It has a higher success rate with low skills, but alerts everyone in the area. There are also finishing moves that have a chance to proc at any time based on your skill and the targets health. These only work on NPCs. Spells also give a special visual effect if you overkill with them. Fire burns them to a crisp, frost encases them in ice, and shock melts the skin and armor. This works on NPCs and mobs. You can also choose to have timed blocking, which makes blocking useful only 8f you raise your shield right when attacked. Damage and item hp values can also be increased/decreased. Everything is adjustable. More complicated things on install, less complicated when you make a new character and with an item in your menu."

ElderScrolls,38p8k7,YouCantTakeThisName,2,Fri Jun 5 19:54:45 2015 UTC,"It seems like you're already pretty set on playing it on PC, so I'll recommend some lore-friendly mods to you, to make it a slightly nicer experience.  First of all, I'm surprised no one has mentioned DarNified UI. The UI in vanilla Oblivion is a complete pile of arse. This mod makes it easier to navigate. It's similar to SkyUI in Skyrim.  Second, you should get Oblivion Character Overhaul v2. OCO has been mentioned already, but it's so nice.  Lastly, this one is called Combat Stance Reanimation. This just improves character animations when weapons are drawn. The default animations are just really silly."
ElderScrolls,38p8k7,YouCantTakeThisName,2,Fri Jun 5 22:04:19 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it is indeed better to play the PC version of Oblivion.  The reason, however, isn't because of Mods (though there are plenty of excellent Mods).  It's because the PC version (on Steam) should have the easiest access to all of the official Plug-Ins/DLC.  There's more than just the ""Knights of the Nine"" and ""Shivering Isles"" expansions.  I do believe there's one where you can obtain Mehrunes' Razor in a quest, and at least two others with special player-homes."

The quest line is incredibly fun in my opinion, the new weapons and armour, gorgeous landscape to explore with so many more unique fortresses and dungeons.  I love the layout of the towns.  I wish there were more of a variety of enemies, but I feel that was just a part of the way Oblivion was.  I loved collecting the items along the way and having them displayed in the castle.  The intro of when you are first beginning your journey in the SI was very captivating.  Maybe it's because Oblivion is my favorite game, but I loved everything about that game and its DLC's."
ElderScrolls,38pirs,sa-steve-va,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:49:18 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm curious to know what you found fun about it? For me, one of things I value about TES quests is that many of them have multiple paths to completion. I felt like that was lacking here.  I agree that the introductory cutscene was both well done and visually exciting. That didn't hold up, though. Soon I was in a pseudo-medieval castle getting quests from the local king."
ElderScrolls,38pirs,Capt0bv10u5,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:52:58 2015 UTC,"I think part of your problem is hype. It was so oversold that it couldn't possibly live up to what you had come to expect.  Beyond that, I have to agree on certain points about how ""crazy"" is portrayed in video games (among other media). However, Shivering Isles wasn't about all the crazy, it was about two forms in particular ... those so named in opposing regions. More to the point about opposition, the whole quest about the duality of Sheogorath. The two regions were in conflict to one another, the two deadric guards he used, the two options in everything you did from the test dungeon quest to the fight between the two deadra types.  The ultimate point wasn't to show off a crazy god, but a conflicted and opposing god. And moreover to solve that duality within him by assuming his mantle and allowing him to move past the punishment issued to him.  At least that's how I read it."
ElderScrolls,38pirs,BoardroomBimmy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:15:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you. Sheogorath is funny as fuck, & the plotline is very interesting. It has to do with the permanent transformation of jiggylag into sheogorath."

ElderScrolls,38s9un,Atvelonis,4,Sat Jun 6 20:22:03 2015 UTC,"Despite ESO not being anywhere as good as the main series, it certainly isn't a bad game. At least, it's nowhere near as bad as it was upon launch. ZeniMax has introduced a number of new features (the Justice System in Update 6 for example is a lot of fun) and has fixed a LOT of bugs, actually making the game playable.  Truth be told I can have fun with any Elder Scrolls game—to me, the games in the series are eternal. Can't get enough of them, ever. If you haven't played Morrowind or even Daggerfall or Arena you should definitely give them a shot, they're quite enjoyable games in my opinion, even if slightly dated. If you want to totally immerse yourself in the series, do some reading on lore. Like, legitimately study books and texts. It's actually pretty fun.  Also—another Elder Scrolls game is undoubtedly coming (they have to get to Landfall eventually, heh). The longest wait between games was around six years, between Daggerfall (1996) and Morrowind (2002). I know that may sound like a long time, but take into account that four of those have already passed since Skyrim (2011). But until 2017-ish comes around, have some fun with the games already here. I know I will be. :)"
ElderScrolls,38s9un,YouCantTakeThisName,5,Sat Jun 6 18:34:54 2015 UTC,"Assuming it's even true that TES VI will take ""another decade"" to be released? (Which I highly doubt).

ElderScrolls,38s9un,fossilfern,3,Sat Jun 6 21:51:19 2015 UTC,"Factor in the fact that Fallout 3 started development in 2004 and was finished in 2008, concurrent with the development cycles of 2 Elder Scrolls games, and it's more likely than you think.  Skyrim experienced a delay in its development, which is what ultimately caused it to be released in November 2011.  Fallout 4 was in development since, at the latest, April 2013.  (Heck, even Morrowind back then experienced a short delay)  Following Bethesda's development patterns for TES games, development of TES VI has definitely started back in late 2011 immediately after the release of Skyrim.  This would come as no surprise to veterans of that series."

I may be going against the grain here but I really feel Skyrim is the weakest out of the Elder Scrolls series, it's not a bad game but it ain't amazing either.   After Oblivion, FO3 and Skyrim the Role Playing element of Bethesdas RPGs seem to be taking a back seat in favour of just walking about and looting caves, with the occasional side story which can be engaging but that side story/mission seems to be one small part in an otherwise sort of hollow game.

ElderScrolls,38l777,KyBones,18,Thu Jun 4 23:12:19 2015 UTC,"I think the high elves are pretty interesting. The Thalmor are the super nationalistic, militant arm of the Dominion, but you can't say all Altmer are like that. They live in a very culturally protective nation and are incredibly proud of being among the earliest, possibly the first civilization in Tamriel.   And history is written for the citizens of the Summerset Isles by a group interested in maintaining their image. So, if you grow up in the Dominion, you hear about how your blood has such rich history, and how the other elven races used to defer to the high elven king, and you see how everyone you know is at least somewhat adept with magical proficiency, and stories about Humans especially have screwed things up for so long, hell, Lorkhan cost your people their divinity, and Trinimac was corrupted into Malacath. It's not hard to feel a bit superior and like the other races are hopeless barbarians."
ElderScrolls,38l777,ObsidiusAnhedonist,2,Fri Jun 5 00:05:36 2015 UTC,"Most Altmer are not proficient with magic and most of those are who proficient with magic are not Altmer despite what the game stats seem to imply [lore vs gameplay].   Irrelevant but relevant stuff  Whilst the boring magic is of Aldmeri origin, a great deal of magical prowess is not found amongst the Altmer (or Dunmer, more on that below).    The Redguards' sword-singing, sand magic, and 'holy magic' are their developments. Redguard - obvious from concept art - Azra Nightwielder first developed shadow magic and staff enchantments. Redguard mistrust of magic could be argued as an exaggeration, contradicting Trayvond's statements, although he was specific about Illusion and Conjuration, which is not even most magic. Stros M'Kai had a Mages Guild and a Crown king was close friends with a mage (events of Redguard).Tthe Mages Guild was in various Hammerfell towns in Daggerfall, and mages in Hammerfell are not rare. Numerous guild mages in High Rock are Redguard (events of ESO), and that should not be a surprise if they are raised in High Rock, which is not unlikely. Some Wyress are Redguard (ESO), and keep in mind the in-game worlds are scaled down. Sentinel also happens to be a haven for necromancy, which suggests mages are trusted enough to not be ran out of the kingdom, probably because Sentinel is a Forebear kingdom and Forebears worship Julianos, a patron of mages, and thus would be more tolerant of magic. The Nedes developed their odd star magic without elven influence, and ESO added some good lore on them. Imperials had a division of skilled battlemages along with an advanced training facility. They also advanced Conjuration further than elves. The Nibenese are known for their culture of magic, the Tharns being the most famous, or infamous. The human dominated Arcane University also replaced the Crystal Tower as the center of magical learning.  Nord Thu'ums...well, we know how powerful those are and their dragon priests had access to magics not known to elves. Tsun also spoke of the Nords once respect for magic, the lack of which is more to do with the Thalmor and the Oblivion Crisis, although most people grew to distrust magic after that and magic as a whole is decreasing in Tamriel - metaphysical reasons.   All that crap aside, all Tamrielians are capable of being proficient with magic (understand the words of Supermundus) but most do not bother, although it be logical if they used it for some things.   And according to a Dunmer, human lands are saturated with magic:   Again, sir, don't think we have wizard shops on every corner, like you Westers. Of course, these days you find guilds in most of the large towns, but that's you Westers setting up in Morrowind -- not the Dunmer way. Any magic not Temple magic is thought a bit funny, at best, and black and evil at worst. All the houses have their mages, of course, and each village will have a hedgewizard or two, but not respectable-like. And conjurers and necromancers and such, well, we put them right up on poles where they belong. Of course, now, the Telvanni wizards, they're different -- like the Altmeri sorcerors, private in their towers and private in their affairs. Don't know much about them, and don't want to, sir. You don't want to meddle with them. That's all I know.   Yet players think elves are the go to races for magic."
ElderScrolls,38l777,YouCantTakeThisName,15,Mon Jun 8 12:24:51 2015 UTC,I would certainly love the opportunity to play as a character on their side.  All purely for the purpose of experiencing their perspective.
ElderScrolls,38l777,zenthr,4,Thu Jun 4 23:18:00 2015 UTC,"I hate them because I see them as religious oppressors, but I guess here is a fair place to ask, ""Aren't they actually right?"" The cosmology of TES is still weird to me, and every once in a while I end up in TESLore by googling for something, and here is my current understanding:   Talos, by definition, can never be an Aedra, as he was not involved in the creation of Mundus. This isn't particularly important, because he might still be divine, my problem is with the ""might"". The Aedra are dying due to the creation of Mundus. They have virtually no power in Aetherius. This again is similar to the above statement, just showing that Talos, if he is anything anymore, he is different from the Aedra. The Aedra are not powerless within Mundus, though, as seen in Oblivion. Akatosh easily has the power to drive back Mehrunes Dagon. The above two statements seem at odds, but the clarification I've had is that the Aedra have vast powers in Mundus, granted back to them by the mortal worship.   Hence, we have a problem with the maybe-is-divine Talos. There is nothing intrinsically evil about Daedra (see Meridia). The problem why Daedra are reviled is that their worship would weaken the only defense Mundus has from those Daedra that are malevolent- that defense is the Divines (read: Aedra).  Talos worship won't destroy the world in of itself, but what precedence does it set? Suppose instead there were literally thousands of ""maybe-divine"" beings worshiped alongside the Aedra- the Aedra lose their source of power to protect Mundus, and eventually the Daedric Princes are able to successfully invade on a scale Mehrunes Dagon attempted in Oblivion.  (Edited some syntax, probably still sloppy.)"
ElderScrolls,38l777,QuixoticTendencies,2,Fri Jun 5 12:24:10 2015 UTC,"Daedra are definitely not reviled because their worship takes mythopoeic power that could be siphoned off to the protection of the Mundus. They are reviled because people think the Daedra are evil (and for the most part, they are, caveat mortal definitions). There's nothing subtle or reasoned behind it.  Also, Talos doesn't weaken the protections, he strengthens them. When he enacted the enantiomorph and ascended, he became like unto Ada-Mantia. He is a second Convention. That is the whole reason the Thalmor are out to destroy him. They wish to undo the Conventions, both the original and the new, so they may cast aside their mortal prisons and become et'Ada again."
ElderScrolls,38l777,KommandCBZhi,4,Fri Jun 5 16:42:17 2015 UTC,"Speaking from the role play perspective of my Bosmer, the current iteration of the Dominion is a barely disguised Altmer hegemony. Granted, the Altmer have lead all previous Dominions, but are definitely more authoritarian and racist in this current Dominion. So, I support the idea of a Dominion uniting the Altmer, Bosmer, and Khajit, but not the current incarnation of the Dominion."
ElderScrolls,38l777,Seanl7497,6,Fri Jun 5 15:42:55 2015 UTC,"The Thalmor are as close as you can come to the Nazis. The Nazis were the direct inspiration for the Aldmeri Dominion. Taking over a nation with propaganda and slandering anyone that speaks against them. Joining with people of a similar heritage and taking near full control of their government. Putting forward messages of racial superiority and nationalistic militarization. Starting a war out of nowhere that was fast and very one sided. Obviously they ended up losing in a very different way than nazi Germany did in the TES universe. Even besides all of that, the Thalmor are just overall a very unlikable people. In Skyrim we watched as they would just pull people off the streets and torture them, they would manipulate politics behind closed doors, and they were unpleasant to you even if you were a high elf. They lied about fixing the oblivion crisis and killed anyone who said otherwise. The lies about bringing back the two moons after they were gone for two years. They started a war and costed thousands of not millions of lives just because an empire was ruling lands that they didn't own. Summerset, Valenwood, and Elsweyr all had already seceded and the empire had yet to do anything. They purge the ""racially unpure"" wood elves in Valenwood, use oppression, fear and lies to install their own regime everywhere they go and will do anything to keep it in power. I really don't see how anybody could like the Thalmor, they take all the worst qualities of the High Elves and then put them to the extremes."
ElderScrolls,38l777,ObsidiusAnhedonist,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:20:37 2015 UTC,"They purge the ""racially unpure"" wood elves in Valenwood   They purged political dissidents, which could have very well been targeting the Blades - people who engaged in terrorist attacks in their land - who were hiding in Valenwood.   The only mention of slaughtering people because of race is in Rising Threat, and it questions if that was their motive:   Then the first of many pogroms descended on Summerset Isle. They slaughtered any who were not ""of the blood of the Aldmer"". A fine excuse to purge the dissidents, as well - the Thalmor have never been ones to waste such an opportunity.   ""Not of the blood of Aldmer"" is vague. Do they mean people with no Altmer parents or those without two Altmer parents? A half-elf (which do exist in the lore) would fit their criteria and their creed. Half an elf is better than no elf, right?  And the Nazi comparisons are superficial. The Nazis were not the only people to create a narrative to justify mass murder. The Israelites, Turkish, and Hutu have done it. The Thalmor go deeper in their hatred of humans than the Nazis' hatred of non-Germans.   Humans - chiefly the Imperials and Nords - are not innocent in this affair.   The Imperials massacred the Ayleids who helped the Nedes get their freedom and view Pelinal Whitestrake - an aspect of Lorkhan - as a hero, a being who slaughtered elves by the scores just because.   The Nords did not simply get revenge on the Falmer who sacked Saarthal. They went on killing sprees targeting those that had nothing to do with it and forced them to build Windhelm, and then killed them afterwards. They invaded Morrowind and then sought to reconquer it as if they were theirs to rule. The first time they saw Bretons they killed them because of their inability to distinguish Bretons from elves.   To make matters worse, Imperials and Nords hold Lorkhan - the deceiver - in a positive light and placed Talos in his stead. Not only where they tricked out of divinity to experience the curse of mortality but relics of the Ehlnofey are sustaining it with that Talos worship. The only way to return to godhood is not only reserve creation but to ensure humans can never be a possibility, and to erase them from memory of having existed.  Do humans deserve it? Deserve got nothing to do with it. To the Thalmor, it is only right humans are wiped from existence."

That is why I hate the Thalmor so much, they are such a big smudge on such a great race. It's like how the later Alessians went on mass murder campaigns against the Elves. It's a big smudge on the Imperials history. I know the high elves have always had a semblance of that racial superiority as shown by how few people are aloud into Summerset with a diplomat from the Reman'd being the first to visit Alinor. It just makes me sad to see all the worst qualities of the people I love being the defining characteristics of their ruling party. The biggest thing to remember is that just like how the Nazis first conquered Germany, the third Aldmeri dominon first conquered Summerset. Summerset was in the middle of its own revolutions where the young High elves were getting sick and tired of all the traditions and strict social classes. The province had been unstable for awhile, and once it fell apart during the oblivion crisis, they seized the opportunity and took over. They went from a group laughed at by the High elves and became the ruling party of the Summerset Isles. The Thalmor are just as oppressive to the High elves as they are to the wood elves."

ElderScrolls,38l777,ObsidiusAnhedonist,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:47:07 2015 UTC,I provided plenty of lore to undo the myth of Altmer leaning magic proficiency in another comment.
ElderScrolls,38l777,Teekei-Na,2,Mon Jun 8 14:09:57 2015 UTC,"I do, & here's why:  (disclaimer: I know most of my lore from playing the ES since Morrowind & shoddy Casts series, I'm not claiming to know everything & have every fact straight. This is just the jist of it.)  The High elves were among the first to settle in tamriel, along with the beast races. The nords migrated from Atmora, & the Redguards from Akaviir & so on. The high elves used to be reffered to as the Aldmer. That was before the other 2 Mer races, Bosmer, & Dunmer evolved from the Aldmer, which is when they became known as the Altmer. Now the Aldmer lived a quiet & very highly evolved existence. They were very diplomatic (& still are today) as well & artistic & peaceful. Now after the imperials & other human races came to be, the Altmer ignored their presence on the mainland of tamriel. The races of men were almost constantly at war, which was really beneath the Altmer who were so highly sophisticated. Ignoring the imperials as they dominated the continent of tamriel was there first & biggest mistake. By the time the high elves acknowledged Tiber Septim & his empire as a threat, it was too late.  The imperials conquered the summerset isles, & commanded allegiance from the altmer. Also, the Imperials forced the altmer to worship talos, as a god. This was highly controversial because the Altmer would never dream of worshipping a man-god. Too little too late, the altmer were now under the command of the imperial legion. This lasted for many many years.   The thalmor are basically a political party of extremists who are revolting against the imperial legion, no different than the stormcloaks. They are just pissed about the events that unfolded in the past & are now commanding that the empire does NOT worship Talos as a god, the same way the Legion forced them to do so against their will in the past.   I think the Thalmor are just a misunderstood & misrepresented group of high elves trying to get theirs."

TES lore has such great uniqe and interesting(and not euro-inspired, which is rare in this kind of high fantasy worlds) bits, and its sad that since Morrowind the series is underusing those and keeps coming back to its more mundane and formulaic stories and worlds. So I would like an Elsweyr game more than anything, as khajit culture is really fascinating, alien and sometimes hilarious and there are really great options for interesting world building, and also I think desert settings are underused in video games and also in fantasy. But im definitely up for a Hammerfell, Black Marsh,  Summerset or Valenwood games, as long as they could pull those off interestingly enough without, say, changing the bosmer culture into generic post-tolkein elfs and valenwood's jungles into generic european forests."

And while the beast races don't get much love it seems, I feel like setting the game in Elsweyr and or Black Marsh probably would give us the most geographic diversity.  Not to mention I feel like the non-beast races would still get good representation.  What with the elves always sticking their noses into the Khajiit and Argonian's business all of the time.  And the fact that they could stick the very southern portion of Cyrodil in there and voila now you have the humans there as well.    Hammerfell would be sweet but there is a lot of empty space.  It would be super cool trekking through the desert and randomly stumbling onto half-buried ruins, but you could get that experience in Elsweyr as well.   Summerset Isles and Valenwood... how do you justify non-elves? Unless the Empire retakes control from the Aldmiri Dominion and militarily occupies their homelands   I heard that Fallout 4's map (rumor) is 3 times the size of Skyrim which, if true lends itself nicely to a two province game.  A High Rock/ Hammerfell to me would be as equally awesome as an Elsweyr/ Black Marsh or Elsweyr/ Valenwood game.  I also factor in traditional RPG/ fantasy tropes. Which typically has adventures starting somewhere wooded and somewhat safe then moving on to plains, mountains, deserts, marshes. ect. with progressively harder enemies.  I think of games like the Legend of Zelda, old Final Fantasy's or Dragon Quest's.  I know TES is a western RPG and those are JRPG's but It is an undeniable theme in fantasy games/ stories. And I think an Elsweyr/ Black Marsh game would lend its self perfectly to that type of game.  Well that's my spiel. Agree? Disagree? I'm an idiot?"
ElderScrolls,38jmjp,Gabanre_Veric,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:46:41 2015 UTC,"A smart Bethesda would have a Hammerfell game to further the Thalmor storyline, then an Elsweyr game where you can join the Thalmor or the resistance, and canon leads to the Thalmor being overthrown or at least severely weakened, allowing a game in Valenwood.  Or you could go for Elsweyr-Hammerfell-Valenwood so you don't have two bordering and similar provinces in a row. That also gives time for Valenwood to be rebuilt and recover from Thalmor influences."

We've been exploring single-province settings since the 3rd game in the main series, so it is most likely that TES VI will allow us to roam & quest in another single Province which has yet to be fully fleshed-out and explored. :D  (EDIT): To be fair, though... TESIII: Morrowind didn't even allow us to explore the entirety of Morrowind.  You can only explore the large island of Vvardenfell and the city of Mournhold.  Solstheim arguably counts, but that island didn't officially become part of Morrowind until the early 4th Era."

More humans; more temperate forests; more mountains; more medieval European architecture. IMO Daggerfall was a great representation of it because they were able to pull off the aesthetic of it very well given the limited graphical capabilities. If you want a second, more fleshed out visit, maybe try ESO? They nailed the High Rock feel from Daggerfall pretty well."
ElderScrolls,38jmjp,TheSpaceWhale,2,Thu Jun 4 22:03:35 2015 UTC,My top hope for a new ES is  Summerset Isles as I enjoy the more fantasy elements of ES.

They could make the game heavily political and that would be quite neat.
ElderScrolls,38jmjp,lumpy999,2,Thu Jun 4 22:19:56 2015 UTC,"Most people seem to believe that there won't be an Elder Scrolls set in High Rock because they think TESII: Daggerfall was set in all of High Rock.  Correction: ""Daggerfall"" was set in the ILIAC BAY REGION, which was southern High Rock and north-western Hammerfell combined.  Not very large parts of either Province.  It just so happens that this region also contains the eponymous city of Daggerfall.  That being said, TESII does not cover the entirety of High Rock.  Not even the region known now as the ""Western Reach"" in eastern High Rock.  It's also of note (as someone else here in the comments-section said) that TESII is dated, is not in high-detail, and has mainly randomly-generated environments...largely not hand-crafted, unlike the worlds of the 3 more recent single-player games in the series.  High Rock is just as likely to be the setting of the next TES, especially because it is both a human-dominated Province AND because the eastern side of High Rock shares borders with Skyrim, connected by the ""Reach"" region. (The way that the single-player games have been going since TESIII: Morrowind, it's most likely that Bethesda's next Province choice will be one that borders Skyrim...either High Rock or Hammerfell)"

Amidst that tension, perhaps some crazy shit happens, like the Sload returning and getting revenge for Cyrus killing N'Gasta, trying to use revive the art of Sword-Singing to destroy the province, and the hero has to help stop it whilst navigating through the possible political climate.  Yet, High Rock is home to the Adamantine Tower. It would be a neat place for the Thalmor to 'check out' if Bethesda is going in MK's direction."
ElderScrolls,38jmjp,ShytMcShytty,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:57:04 2015 UTC,I think High Rock would be too similar to Skyrim and Cyrodiil. I might be wrong but I've always pictured it as just fields and not much else
ElderScrolls,38jmjp,Pishwi,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:56:37 2015 UTC,I think Elsewhyr would be a very unique and interesting setting plus all the different types of khajiit we could see and also the culture too
ElderScrolls,38jmjp,All_Fanastical_Image,-1,Thu Jun 18 18:35:03 2015 UTC,"i would always see people on facebook saying they want Black Marsh as the next setting, but it's near non-inhabitable by non-Argonians, so unless it's a squeal to Adventures:Redguard (like it was supposed to be) in the sense you have to play as a specific race (which is not what people want) it probably wont happen"

ElderScrolls,38hdz9,Moonburn,20,Thu Jun 4 14:35:46 2015 UTC,"Daggerfall is kind of cheating though. It uses randomly generated placement of assets that it reuses, so in the end everything starts looking the same no matter where you go. It is no better than most space sims, where the map can be arbitrarily large and it doesn't matter because you are only keeping track of the distance between objects.  I think there should be a distinction made between handcrafted worlds like GTA and later TES titles, and randomly generated worlds like Daggerfall."
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,thebeef24,17,Thu Jun 4 08:55:26 2015 UTC,"I think there certainly is a distinction, but the size of Daggerfall at least gives us an idea (maybe) of the true world scale in Elder Scrolls. It also feels kind of aspirational. I, for one, wouldn't mind a larger world that's handcrafted but with  more landscape between ruins, etc. It would make discovering things more rewarding."
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,skwelcher,7,Thu Jun 4 12:02:39 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. There doesn't need to be a ruin or cave to explore every 500 feet. One thing I've noticed since I've seen some of the Daggerfall Unity stuff with the increased view distance is that the scale just seems so much larger, like it's a believable province province of an empire. The mountains in Skyrim kind of help give the illusion of size, but everything still feels really close together."
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,thebeef24,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"There's a game in the works called Frontiers that explicitly references Daggerfall as an influence. It definitely appears to be an exploration/survival-first world. I haven't checked on the status in a while, but I'm looking forward to it."
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,Chazzey_dude,3,Fri Jun 5 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"True. A handcrafted world would be better, but would require a fortune to make the size of Daggerfall. There's definitely a distinction but it's impressive all the same."
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,-Unparalleled-,3,Thu Jun 4 14:37:31 2015 UTC,"What would be interesting is procedurally generated worlds with specific points of interest at fixed locations. Difficult with an open world of that high graphical quality, mind. It's not like in minecraft where everything is just blocks."
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,vhisic,2,Thu Jun 4 18:59:06 2015 UTC,"Minecraft made it easy, since semi-randomly making a world is 1000x easier when it's made in uniform blocks. It was is pretty genius design I will admit.  If I was to draw up a quick idea...  It would be more expensive, but having a set number of tile types (similar to Minecraft) as well as having some way to change them into set shapes. Shapes to form rolling hills, sharp mountains, plateaus, deep canyons, dense jungles, towns, dungeons, etc. It would require a lot of scripting/coding, money, and time but if a game was to do something like this to make a large (maybe not daggerfall sized lol), beautiful, and interactive map it would be amazing! And of course having fixed POI set around certain biomes.  And if any aspiring developers want to use these ideas feel free, I just want it to happen!"
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,mishugashu,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:39:04 2015 UTC,"It could have like 5 or so variants of things like hills, planes, valleys, etc that are just told where to be so there could be a big map that still feels varying. They could even have different values to govern things like grass, forest, snow etc on top of them.  So it could have something like this:    Hill1, grass1 hill2, grass2 valley1 forest1 valley2 forest2    Hill3, grassforest1 valley3, forest3 valley4, grassforest2 hill2, grass3   Valley5 grassforest2 valley4 grassforest3 hill4 grass1 mountain1 grassrock1"
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,shinjiryu,3,Mon Jul 13 08:20:45 2015 UTC,You also need to keep in mind daggerfall is 20 years old. To create a game of this scale or even to the scale of gta as a fully pre designed world you are talking about mountains of floopy disks and computer that couldnt even install half of it at a time.
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,SimpleFactor,3,Thu Jun 4 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"'procedurally generated' is the term you're looking for. It's not random; it's very specific in what it can and can't do while generating. And unlike those space sims, it is static (same placement between different playthroughs), as well. It was only generated once.  But, yeah, it's definitely not hand crafted. At all."
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,StabbyDMcStabberson,3,Thu Jun 4 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"There is an article somewhere, and it's only due to the fact that Daggerfall's in-game world, when converted to ""real-world"" measurement, is the largest game world. The article linked below claims the size of Daggerfall's map, but sadly doesn't give any comparisons: http://www.hexapolis.com/2014/11/05/10-biggest-open-world-video-games-terms-map-size/"
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,mishugashu,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:13:35 2015 UTC,"Its size is extremely impressive, but how would anyone even go about walking across it in game? It would take weeks! Impressive yes, but just way to impractical."
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,ShytMcShytty,3,Thu Jun 4 13:46:14 2015 UTC,We used fast travel for everything.  It wasn't like Skyrim where you had to discover a place before fast traveling to it.
ElderScrolls,38hdz9,ShytMcShytty,3,Thu Jun 4 16:15:30 2015 UTC,"Fast travel is definitely essential in Daggerfall, but they did it right, I think. It takes gold, it calculates the distance and takes x amount of days, getting a horse/ship cuts down on relevant travel time, etc.  Unlike the future titles in the series, which I consider fast travel cheap and never use it, I think Daggerfall keeps fast travel and keeps the immersion as well."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,fredfredb3rg,31,Wed Jun 3 21:27:41 2015 UTC,3-4 years. In an interview (I think it was relatively recent) Bethesda said that they have a 4 year development cycle. I think that the only reason that Fallout 3 was an exception was because it was a new IP they acquired.
ElderScrolls,38fgei,Madkat124,13,Wed Jun 3 21:46:46 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right. 2002 for Morrowind, 2007 for Oblivion, 2011 for Skyrim, 2016 for Fallout 4, so... 2020 for TES VI?"
ElderScrolls,38fgei,noplzstop,28,Wed Jun 3 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't believe it if they waited 9 years to make a sequel to a game as successful as Skyrim. Still, I guess it'd be possible glares at the  Half-Life series"
ElderScrolls,38fgei,dallonweekes,18,Thu Jun 4 02:45:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, honestly, they may have totally different teams working on the games, maybe they have one in the works for a year or two from now."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,noplzstop,10,Thu Jun 4 02:58:28 2015 UTC,"From what I remember reading about their development cycle during Skyrim's development, they have one team that works on all the games, but part of the team will jump to the next game when the current one is done and the rest of the team will migrate over eventually after DLCs and stuff are finished."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,GM93,3,Thu Jun 4 03:43:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, gotcha. With how the Fallout 4 trailer looked, hopefully they've got part of that team working on a new engine. I think it looks good, but it's not going to stand in 2 years if TESVI is still running on the same engine as Skyrim.   I know it's probably wishful thinking but I'm hoping for one that allows for transparent windows."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,noplzstop,8,Thu Jun 4 05:23:39 2015 UTC,I hope so. I don't see them revealing it at E3 though when The Elder Scrolls Online releases this month for consoles.
ElderScrolls,38fgei,dallonweekes,4,Thu Jun 4 02:59:44 2015 UTC,They're still doing that? I heard it was awful and since then I haven't heard any console people talk about it
ElderScrolls,38fgei,7V3N,4,Thu Jun 4 17:30:44 2015 UTC,"Its seems to be relatively popular with the console players seeing as they get a completely finished product + no sub fee from the start + 6 updates that occured in the span of more than a year. Its gonna come out in less than 5 days, so we'll see about how popular it is then."

ElderScrolls,38fgei,7V3N,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:23:23 2015 UTC,Most everything on the internet about it nowadays is positive. Most of the complaints were about its buggy launch and subscription fee. I haven't seen anything negative in a few months from people who have actually played it.
ElderScrolls,38fgei,dallonweekes,0,Fri Jun 5 04:39:40 2015 UTC,And they wouldn't deal with 2 AAA titles at one e3

ElderScrolls,38fgei,Madkat124,3,Wed Jun 3 22:01:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, Oblivion was 2006."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,fuckdirectv,2,Wed Jun 3 22:34:20 2015 UTC,"As games get larger and more detailed, and graphical fidelity improves, games take longer to produce. I haven't seen any indication that this trend is going to change."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,Emberwake,6,Thu Jun 4 07:40:12 2015 UTC,Probably this year for Fallout though. So that would mean a year earlier for the next TES.
ElderScrolls,38fgei,katmetgun,6,Wed Jun 3 22:51:04 2015 UTC,"You forgot fallout 3 - 2008, and oblivion was 2006. I don't think fallout 4 will be a 2016 release either. It's more likely to be October 2015, and with that, I'd say that TES VI will be Oct/Nov 2018."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,Kraizee_,2,Thu Jun 4 07:15:20 2015 UTC,"Thats still very long... I can't (or dont want to) believe they will leave TES series for so long. Yes, we have ESO but it's not a game from the main series ( i mean, it doesn't have a number, its more like a spin off or something)."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,Roku-ro,2,Thu Jun 4 16:53:45 2015 UTC,"With 5 years between Oblivion and Skyrim, and 7 years between Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, assuming it's a 2015 release, unless TESVI is given to another studio to develop, we aren't likely to see TESVI till 2018/2019. Note that games that aren't sequels to the main series have been given to other studios. New Vegas was developed by Obsidian Entertainment, and ESO was developed by ZeniMax Online Studios.  I don't ever want a world where we have a TES/fallout game every year. I also don't think the modding scenes would ever get as big if we didn't have development cycles this long."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,Kraizee_,2,Thu Jun 4 23:21:28 2015 UTC,Skyrim came out in 2011   I know this probably gets said a lot in this community but holy fuck it's been 4 years?! I still haven't done so much in the game!!
ElderScrolls,38fgei,goobhd,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:06:47 2015 UTC,I do believe there to be some measure of concurrent development happening.

ElderScrolls,38fgei,sa-steve-va,2,Thu Jun 4 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"New Vegas was made by Obsidian Entertainment, though, which means it shouldn't be included in Bethesda Game Studios' repertoire. I think Oblivion and FO3 were created in conjunction with each other to some degree, which can be done when design and development departments pass the games off between each other. I have no idea why the graphics department apparently didn't immediately get to work on FO4 after finishing up on Skyrim, though. DLC may be the reason, though."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,VexonCross,16,Fri Jun 5 13:07:18 2015 UTC,Best case.. fall 2017. Worst Case.. 2020. My guess.. fall 2019.  I think their schedule looks like:  FO4 - fall '15  FO: Oregon Trail (by Obsidian) - fall '17  TESVI - fall 2019
ElderScrolls,38fgei,Retrogamer82,12,Thu Jun 4 03:18:03 2015 UTC,TES VI in 2017 is my guess.
ElderScrolls,38fgei,Estiui,9,Wed Jun 3 23:10:50 2015 UTC,"2 years past FO4's release, maybe? I dunno. Kills me too, but there's always the older ones.   Oh, and Daggerfall Tools for Unity, there's a tech demo that lets you turn into a laser-equipped jet and fly around, that's kinda fun.  Mod Showcase 1 at this link"
ElderScrolls,38fgei,noplzstop,5,Wed Jun 3 21:30:04 2015 UTC,I think (or at least hoping) that they'll make a new engine for the next TES game so it might push it back an extra year or two from their normal schedule.
ElderScrolls,38fgei,neerk,0,Thu Jun 4 04:22:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will. I think Morrowind and Oblivion used the same engine, as did Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, so that means Skyrim and TESVI will use the same engine and so will Fallout 4 and Fallout: New Mexico."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,cptnhook,2,Thu Jun 4 04:52:51 2015 UTC,Skyrim uses a modified Morrowind engine.
ElderScrolls,38fgei,MorsTactica,3,Thu Jun 4 14:40:57 2015 UTC,"Creation, right? I doubt we'll be seeing that much of an upgrade from Fallout 4 to TESVI since Bethesda works on a four year schedule."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,cptnhook,2,Thu Jun 4 15:17:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The Pipboy still exists and the Killcams are literally VATS in Skyrim. I just hope they modified it up to x64, if they did that the modding community can do a lot more."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,MorsTactica,5,Thu Jun 4 15:32:27 2015 UTC,I say late 2016. I bet they've both been in development. They'll stagger releases so as not to compete with themselves. Let Fallout ride the Holiday season out and than start teasing TES6.
ElderScrolls,38fgei,KiboshWasabi,3,Thu Jun 4 10:15:54 2015 UTC,I also suspect they've both been in development.  I think we'll also get a hint based on whether or not they developed a new engine for Fallout 4.  If not I suspect they might want to develop one for TES VI in which case I'd expect the wait to be longer...but who knows.

ElderScrolls,38fgei,AVestedInterest,14,Thu Jun 4 01:01:07 2015 UTC,"Your pattern is missing a few things...   Oblivion was 2006, not 2007.  New Vegas was developed by Obsidian, not Bethesda Game Studios (the only studio to develop a numbered The Elder Scrolls game).  Considering that these games are developed by a single team, we can't reasonably expect a 1 year turnaround time.  If we want substantial differences between games (total redesigns of major systems), we can't reasonably expect two years either.  3 years is within the realm of possibility if the tech remains largely unchanged (as was the case between Oblivion -> Fallout 3 -> Skyrim).  4 years would be my guess if they go for a major overhaul.  But since Fallout 4 is coming out with the new generation of consoles, I expect it will reflect a new iteration of tech that will remain largely unchanged for TES VI.  So... 3 to 4 years sounds about right."
ElderScrolls,38fgei,SiliconSynapsed,11,Thu Jun 4 01:48:16 2015 UTC,I have been thoroughly schooled.
ElderScrolls,38fgei,AVestedInterest,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"The announcement of Fallout 4 doesn't hamper the chances of  TES VI also being announced at E3.  We've got 10 days to go before E3 now, and those same 10 days in which more games by Bethesda could be announced.  I don't suppose anyone else here knows that, back then, Fallout 3 started development unhindered when The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was still in development?  Does anyone here even know that The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim started development back in 2006? (When Fallout 3 was 2 years into development)  The point here being that there was nothing stopping Bethesda from starting TES VI's development back in 2011 in the first place.  The fact that Bethesda was working on Fallout 4 as well could easily be supported by the fact that they were looking to hire new people on their team a few years back.  The Elder Scrolls Online is definitely not going to be in the way, considering two things:  1.)  ZeniMax Online Studios is the developer, not Bethesda, which has been working on TESO since 2007.  2.)  The console versions of Tamriel Unlimited will be released on the 9th, 5 days before E3.  If there's going to be ANY TESO news at E3, it won't last longer than a couple of minutes, just calling attention to the fact that TESO:TU just released on consoles."

Plot twist: What if they end up announcing a new IP in 2019? That would put TESVI at least out until 2023 maybe (Unless they adjust the way they work) Does that make you wanna downvote me more?

ElderScrolls,38dj15,jonnytheman,0,Wed Jun 3 15:59:29 2015 UTC,Skyrim was not on a new engine
ElderScrolls,38dj15,NoOneKnowsMeIhope,4,Wed Jun 3 20:27:45 2015 UTC,I thought it was? Isn't Skyrim on Creation while the older games were on Gamebryo?
ElderScrolls,38dj15,leftshoe18,0,Wed Jun 3 20:29:38 2015 UTC,That is indeed the case but the 'creation engine' is simple a modified version of the Gamebryo engine

I mean Skyrim came out only a year after Fallout: New Vegas, so maybe the Elder Scrolls team is working on something huge that can be out in a year or two.  Hopefully with a more updated engine than what we're seeing on Fallout 4"
ElderScrolls,38dj15,atsu333,2,Wed Jun 3 21:28:26 2015 UTC,"Bethesda Softworks is the publisher of both series.  Bethesda Game Works is the developer of Morrowind, Fallout 3, Oblivion, Skyrim.   The only reason we had NV and Skyrim so close is because NV was developed by Obsidian Entertainment. It seems like BGW is developing Fallout 4, so unless the next elder scrolls is being developed by someone else, it'll be a long long wait for ES6 more likely around 2 years wait judging from their history."
ElderScrolls,38dj15,Kraizee_,0,Wed Jun 3 21:52:59 2015 UTC,Except for the fact that Fallout 3 was developed alongside both Oblivion and Skyrim.

But I will say I'm a little sad cause part of me was holding out some small hope that TESVI would be next. I'm a relative newcomer to TES games, but I FREAKING love the games, lore, all of it. So I was hoping that with my recent arrival to the TES world I wouldn't have to wait too terribly long for the next one like long time fans have been...oh well. I guess this gives me time to give Fallout a try"
ElderScrolls,38dj15,radioladio1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:41:58 2015 UTC,"It's fair this way. Fallout got two games, one by Bethesda. Then ES got two games, one by Bethesda. I sense a pattern. Fallout is amazing regardless so I can't complain."

Bethesda's staff have always been extremely secretive about info, usually until less than a year from when their games are planned to be released.  Therefore, I'm calling this ""SandraReed"" a liar.

ElderScrolls,38beaj,Zereta,6,Wed Jun 3 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"I have seen articles on that website before and other websites like it linked to pre-hyping video games.  Basically, they are this unknown little website that runs off of a ton of ads.  They are able to live off the ads and with the anonymity they write articles about ""confirmed"" rumors about games such as Fallout 4, Elder Scrolls Redguard, Elder Scrolls Argonia, Mass Effect 4, etc. in hopes of catching the announcement early.  This allows them to be the ""first"" to have declared it and potentially get a bunch of new followers.  There is no downside because people will either buy into the rumor and link to the website, or not buy into it, but at least they got that page view."
ElderScrolls,38beaj,TheStradivarius,2,Wed Jun 3 06:29:08 2015 UTC,Elder Scrolls: Argonia does sound like it could be neat.

ElderScrolls,38beaj,TheStradivarius,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:37:52 2015 UTC,But I want to believe.  Don't take this away from me.  It's totally possible to set a role playing game with unlimited main character possibilities in a region that actively expels all non-aragonians.  Don't bring logic into this.
ElderScrolls,38beaj,OneFootOnTheGas,3,Wed Jun 3 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"Then stop. Argonia was a complete hoax, and a bad one at that. There was not a single shred of truth in all the articles that spoke about it.   And it's not about logic or Black Marsh's hostility towards non-Argonians, I'm sure if Bethesda wanted to, they would have easily overcome this. Every piece of information about Argonia comes from crappy clickbait sites."
ElderScrolls,38beaj,Pishwi,2,Wed Jun 3 17:18:16 2015 UTC,"I think you missed my sarcasm.  I realize Argonia was a complete hoax.

ElderScrolls,38beaj,Zereta,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:21:46 2015 UTC,I think Argonia would be the best choice for the next game. That's just my opinion though

ElderScrolls,38beaj,YouCantTakeThisName,3,Wed Jun 3 16:11:22 2015 UTC,I know! It's exciting. However I think we're more likely to hear the announcement of Fallout 4 than TES:VI
ElderScrolls,38beaj,ThatGuy743,5,Wed Jun 3 17:06:03 2015 UTC,They won't announce ES6 at E3

ElderScrolls,38beaj,ThatGuy743,2,Thu Jun 4 15:30:47 2015 UTC,It makes no sense for them to do it. Bethesda would've just started to make ES6 because they've been working on Fallout 4. They also wouldn't want to show both Elder Scrolls and Fallout.
ElderScrolls,38beaj,YouCantTakeThisName,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:02:10 2015 UTC,"Try explaining the fact that Bethesda worked on The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3 alongside each other, then.  It's already confirmed by Todd Howard that Oblivion was in development since 2002 until it was finished in 2006.  Skyrim started development immediately afterwards in 2006, until it was released in 2011.  ^ All while Fallout 3 was in development by the same Studio, starting in 2004 (while Oblivion was still being worked on) and ending in 2008 (while Skyrim was still being worked on).  (EDIT) - Nothing nonsensical about it, though I'm not saying it's guaranteed that TES VI will be announced at E3 this year.  It is still likely.  Not to mention that it has (so far) been 5 months shy of 4 years since TESV: Skyrim was released back in November 2011.  Since it is incredibly likely that TES VI has been in development as of late 2011, we're already much closer to an announcement, even if it's not at E3."

ElderScrolls,388e3z,imspike,2,Wed Jun 3 14:53:42 2015 UTC,Yeah they have probably started laying the ground work for tes6 already. I guess the new engine is at least getting ready (looked like fallout 4 will use a better version of Skyrims to me)

ElderScrolls,388e3z,MeshesAreConfusing,13,Thu Jun 4 01:36:54 2015 UTC,I dont know. It is not that I do not like Fallout. I think it is a great game and I enjoy playing it. But then I think that we will probably have to wait 5 years for the next TES game because of it and I am sad. I always thought that you could see a bit more love for their game in the TES series. Probably because it is their own IP.  I would be quite interested in them making a completely new IP though. The postapocalyptic stuff is a bit too bland for my taste. It is just.... Ruins and wasteland.
ElderScrolls,388e3z,SageWaterDragon,17,Tue Jun 2 16:56:42 2015 UTC,Well their last major game was Skyrim. If they made another TES it would really piss off the FO fans.

ElderScrolls,388e3z,Zombiepriest,-3,Wed Jun 3 05:21:35 2015 UTC,I'm still kinda sad they converted Fallout into what's basically a post apocalyptic Elder Scrolls. Not that it's a bad game or anything - far from it in fact. But I miss the unique flair of the original games' writing and design. FO3 was mostly just WACKY! ZANY! ALIENS! TEDDY BEARS! AWOOOOOO and incredibly shallow writing  I'd rather see another Obsidian Fallout (without the horrible Gamebryo engine and maybe even with a decent QA effort)

ElderScrolls,388e3z,Zombiepriest,4,Tue Jun 2 23:31:32 2015 UTC,Plus the originals were quite a bit more wacky than 3. You could find the fucking whale from Hitchhiker's in a random encounter.

ElderScrolls,388e3z,Faerillis,4,Wed Jun 3 12:53:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with those saying that this should be no surprise. Elder Scrolls fans have gotten TESV and ESO (however much some may not like it, Bethesda regards ESO as a TES game). The last Fallout made by Bethesda was Fallout 3. How can TES fans be disappointed and say Bethesda should be releasing TESVI? I'm an Elder Scrolls fan before I'm a Fallot fan, but I highly respect the Fallout fan base. So TES fans think the massive Fallout fan base should be slighted after waiting so long, in favor of TES fans? In my honest opinion, I'm seeing many TES fans that have been coming off quite selfishly on this issue..."
ElderScrolls,388e3z,TheMadTemplar,0,Tue Jun 2 22:09:25 2015 UTC,"Bethesda doesn't regard ESO as a TES game.

ElderScrolls,388e3z,Faerillis,6,Tue Jun 2 22:18:40 2015 UTC,"The game is canon. Has been confirmed as such by Bethesda.   And the name choice isn't to differentiate between TES and ESO, but for simplicity's sake. Elder Scrolls Online rolls off the tongue more smoothly than The Elder Scrolls Online.  Then they went and screwed the name by adding Tamriel Unlimited."
ElderScrolls,388e3z,TheMadTemplar,-7,Wed Jun 3 00:00:56 2015 UTC,"Canon-irrelevant not non-canon. Nothing that happens in ESO has any impact on anything else, nor could it. That period of history is all but unknown and very much inconsequential. Molag Bal's attempted invasion? All but unknown and very much inconsequential — nothing that happens in ESO will ever impact anything in any other Elder Scrolls game.  You're saying adding The makes something flow less smoothly off the tongue? No. The is incredible common and were it included it would simply be called TES Online when spoken instead of ESO. The only reason to exclude that is if you don't want it being considered a TES game."

I hate the fact that I sometimes get refered to as 'the one from the college' while it is much more relevant for a guard that I am actually the hero who killed Alduin. Or the Companion leader, as I am a fighter and only dabbled in magic a little and guards are fighters too, they will appreciate me as a companion more than as the archmage."

You can have characters make remarks (or even have full dialog trees) about any piece of clothing, perks (an approximation of level for that skill), and faction rank (based off of quest status), and basically any other game state.  The only problem is that increases the amount of dialog they'd have to write and record by about 100x."

The problem with being a AAA game is you have this feeling like.you need to pander to all the players. This is where Oblivion slid from Morrowind and Skyrim from Oblivion.   Certain mechanics can be improved and introduced, graphics can be ramped up all day long, but if you don't have that immersion that makes you feel like you've done something it starts to lose that true RPG feel. At times Skyrim feels more like an Action/Adventure game with Role Playing elements.   So in short, I agree. Lol"
ElderScrolls,384zrl,Capt0bv10u5,3,Tue Jun 2 13:09:41 2015 UTC,"This is where Oblivion slid from Morrowind and Skyrim from Oblivion.   I'm sortof of the opinion that Skyrim was better than Oblivion. I recognize the opposite feelings (no Murder Mystery quests, etc.). But Skyrim took Oblivion's main strengths over Morrowind and perfected those points while leaving a lot of the weaknesses. Now, I think that it wasn't the right path to go down (and I'm nitpicking a pair of games that I've logged hundred of hours in), but I think Skyrim does succeed at that path better than Oblivion."

Both of them really bothered me.  The stat thing probably bothers me more than most people because one thing I loved about Morrowind was being able to let my character progress naturally.  It's a lot more immersive to simply play your character how you want and let them level up based on your natural playstyle with them.  Planning out character advancements in other games is fine–it's a perfectly legitimate facet of gameplay–but I play TES for the immersion, and keeping track of skill progressions to make sure I have decent stats at level up kills a bit of that."

The DB line in Skyrim I thought was done well, though not as much fun as Oblivion was. The lack of the Fighter's Guild was not missed by me as I think the Companions were far superior, and definitely fit the ideals of Skyrim much neater.  All of that said, I felt like the core story of Oblivion flowed better than in Skyrim. In my first playthrough I was done way too quickly. On subsequent plays of the game I have a better feel of when the story is moving too quickly, but it still feels like they're railroading you through certain parts."

I have no problem with piggy backing onto a great trend, I just don't like it when they want me to believe it was their idea. I think Bethesda and Zenimax have done a great job treading the line between pandering to the newer players and holding true to the spirit of the franchise.

Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, and AC Unity actually had very good hotkey systems that would work very well in a game like Elder Scrolls. Skyrim had a hotkey systems that was in many ways a step back from the wheel in Oblivion. The aforementioned AC games used to use a similar wheel, and then upgraded to a quick d-pad based switching system. These systems allowed a lot more utility, and much faster response times than a wheel, or Skyrim's paltry 2 hotkeys. With 4 buttons on a d-pad, you can have a total of 4 lists/categories of items to scroll through uni-directionally, like Unity, or have 2 axises that can be scrolled through in either direction, like in Black Flag. Now, add to that the element of allowing the player to edit that setup however they see fit, choosing what items/weapons/spells to allocate to each axis or direction, and you would open up a whole world of accessibility to players who prefer playing on a gamepad."

ElderScrolls,384zrl,drekstorm,2,Wed Jun 3 06:13:47 2015 UTC,Point 7 is something no one's really mentioned as far as I know. But it's true; the whole Skyrim storyline felt like it was just about the protagonist rushing here only to rush there and so on until the game ends
ElderScrolls,384zrl,Pishwi,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:46:13 2015 UTC,I never felt much urgency in Obivion's story though I probably should have because you have a demonic god trying to invade the world and the emperor was just murdered.

ElderScrolls,384zrl,YouCantTakeThisName,2,Sun Jun 7 15:00:45 2015 UTC,"Regarding #1, I agree. Consuming food is neat, but it's not like I suffer any penalties for not eating food. And I can only speak for Skyrim, but it's weird that lack of sleep didn't really slow you down either (it was handy for leveling quicker, but once you maxed out resting bonuses became useless).  Regarding #7, I would have really liked that. And in fact I had that thought recently about the Thieves Guild specifically. It seems if I really wanted to expand the Guild's influence, I could've found new hideouts in all the other cities and then recruited from the local population so that the Guild could actually have a physical presence in each city.  Related to that, it would've been nice if all the guild factions had some way to communicate with you remotely, e.g. messenger pigeons or something. I got so sick of running a job for Delvin all the way in Markarth, running all the way back, then getting told I need to go to Markarth for a job. Really, you wanker? You couldn't have told me you wanted that job done too while I was already over there?"

If TES VI is set in Hammerfell, they can implement Wind & Sand Spells: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Dragonborn:Wind_and_Sand_(book)  As for #5, I always thought that Bethesda should've hired the people who did the ""Interesting NPCs"" Mod for Skyrim."

The justice system does seem like a huge step toward adding the TES freedom and immersion to ESO, though.  I didn't think it was a bad game when I played, but that was definitely something that I felt missing.  I actually wanted to do that weekend, but I've been too busy and wouldn't have really had time to play it.

I reckon you're judging the game from reviews dated April 2014. ESO is different from other ES games in that it is an MMO, and so it is a living, changing game (well, at least as long as ZeniMax deems it to be). The game has changed a lot over the past year.

ElderScrolls,380z4n,goremote,11,Tue Jun 2 11:11:24 2015 UTC,"ESO, though interesting in its world build, is simply a collection of waypoints at the end of the day -- it's very obvious where anything that's not just textured landscape is, and even tiny details are purely cosmetic. Dungeon layouts are frequently reused, and even points of interest are rarely interesting for more than a couple minutes of sightseeing.  Skyrim, on the other hand, is massively explorable with the added potential of mods for further ""what-if"" mode goodness. The hours you'll dump into Skyrim will be much more immersive than those spent in ESO (despite the fact that ESO is one of the more immersive MMOs out there)."
ElderScrolls,380z4n,Roku-ro,6,Mon Jun 1 02:03:01 2015 UTC,"I don't agree at all, theres a lot to explore in ESO, so many places to see, books to read, NPCs to talk to, stories to discover."
ElderScrolls,380z4n,goremote,3,Mon Jun 1 08:59:31 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to see and do in ESO in an objective sense, but each zone is too isolated for my liking - each quest hub's story is constricted to that region, making each zone feel isolated itself. In Skyrim, however, you might be given a quest in Winterhold that takes you to a cave just north of Falkreath, or a crazed Argonian in Riften might send you to a cave half a map away to replace a stolen Dwemer artifact. Also, to me, having other players present in my explorations takes away from my immersion. I guess it's a subjective matter at the end of the day, but to me, Skyrim has the edge for exploration."
ElderScrolls,380z4n,Roku-ro,3,Mon Jun 1 09:18:01 2015 UTC,"You're right about the first part, as for the second, to me, its the opposite, other people around makes this world more alive and real.

ElderScrolls,380z4n,QuixoticTendencies,2,Mon Jun 1 18:30:51 2015 UTC,"Skyrim is the better of the two nearly all respects. While there is indeed much to explore in ESO, as big as the world is, zones are leveled. You can't make a Dunmer and expect to visit Mournhold, which is very close to the starting area, mind you, right away without dying several dozen times and having to rez. Leveling takes a long time as well, so you can't expect to speed through the zones and explore at your leisure.  ESO is a beautiful game, and vestiges, albeit slight ones, of the depth of the single-player titles remain in its design, but it's not a true TES experience by any stretch. Also, you'll probably find the character customization lacking. While it's true that all four (yes, you read that right, there's only four) classes have access to the same secondary (read: weapon and profession) skill lines, which afford a good deal of personalized playstyle tweaking, you're still confined to one set of heavily limiting class skill lines. You won't be shadowstepping on any character but a nightblade. You won't be summoning Daedra on any character but a sorcerer, etc. By all means shell out for ESO if you've the money to spare, but don't expect a very immersive experience, and definitely don't go in thinking the lore is well-integrated, or even well thought-out."

Meanwhile time is wasted, you get stressed and annoyed, and you actually dislike the product (and Walmart) even more than before. No thank you.  If websites don't want people to use adblockers than they better get with the program and start showing reasonable, static ads.

If a user doesn't engage in these ads, they're violating the social contract and circumventing the fair value exchange of free content on a website. Is this theft?

The Imperial Library on the other hand isn't a wiki, it's basically a collection of all books in the entire series along with several developer texts.

You can sink many, many hours into this game. The lore is largely intact, and the developers have attempted to make the story feel like an elder scrolls story. One thing it has over the other titles is the sheer amount of content, and the fact that there is no end in sight for continuing your character's story. The game has a strong mechanical and involving framework expressed in class buildology and crafting.  Keep in mind, however, that much of what makes the original titles compelling, and made The Elder Scrolls titles what they were is compromised to make the game fit into an mmo context. Immersion is sacrificed for mechanics. Zone maps are over-crowded with enemy-spawns. Freedom to explore is heavily regulated. People in wedding dresses because lol.

ElderScrolls,37z8hs,SwedishSanta,5,Sun May 31 17:35:15 2015 UTC,I dont think its a TES reference maybe just a coincidence.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,thecheeseisinme,44,Sat May 30 02:25:41 2015 UTC,"In Skyrim, it's probably just part of the Lore. In Oblivion, I'm like 90% sure they just ran out of VO budget."
ElderScrolls,37srhs,Madkat124,14,Sat May 30 03:33:56 2015 UTC,Especially considering that a small teaser for Oblivion showed a Dunmer NPC in ambient conversation using the same voice actor from Morrowind.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,Vahras,2,Sat May 30 05:53:58 2015 UTC,Was it really the same actor? It didn't sound like it
ElderScrolls,37srhs,TimmannenMr,8,Sat May 30 09:14:17 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/pjbx6-KQoRg?t=45s  Only in the E3 demo.

ElderScrolls,37srhs,CSGOWasp,3,Sat May 30 15:59:38 2015 UTC,I know. I just rememberd him sounding differently from the morrowind one. I guess not
ElderScrolls,37srhs,TimmannenMr,15,Sat May 30 10:59:01 2015 UTC,"Well at least they gave them somewhat of a signature dialect in Skyrim to make them stand out a bit. That overly broad Cockney stuff.  They obviously sounded like everyone else in Oblivion because they hadn't any money left after hiring Picard. You could handwave it though and consider all of the Cyrodiil Dunmers assimilated, cosmopolitan city elves, as it were."
ElderScrolls,37srhs,Slevin_Kedavra,1 point,Sat May 30 09:22:33 2015 UTC,It probably wasn't so much that they were strapped for cash as much as it was Bethesda's first fully VO'd game.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,ThrillerBOB,4,Sat Jun 13 23:00:07 2015 UTC,Yeah it always bugged me that all mer use the same 2 voice actors in Oblivion. The female voice sounds fitting for Dunmer but out of place for the others while the male voice sounds like an Altmer.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,ginja_ninja,12,Sat May 30 15:53:02 2015 UTC,Ash from the Red Year scoured away the throat cancer.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,ilmrynorlion,29,Sat May 30 03:04:07 2015 UTC,"Here's my personal theory (which I hope you find more interesting than the boring, out of game explanation of ""they reused voice actors""):   It's environmental, not inherited. It takes years to build up in their lungs enough to sound that way, which explains why the natives sound that way but the other race immigrants don't. At the same time, it improves rapidly when you move away from the ash, so when Dunmer lived away from Morrowind they sound fine.   It's not a foolproof explanation. There are non-Dunmer who lived in Morrowind for decades and sounded fine. But it's the best explanation I've got."
ElderScrolls,37srhs,IndorilMiara,9,Sat May 30 03:35:02 2015 UTC,I think Cyrodil had a huge moon sugar problem that was swept under the rug and that is why so many people were so smiley and jovial for no apparent reason.

ElderScrolls,37srhs,Logofascinated,16,Sat May 30 20:06:58 2015 UTC,"All the male Dunmer in Morrowind were voiced by one guy - Jeff Baker - and only he had the ability to do That Voice.   He did one character in Dawnguard (Skyrim DLC) in that way, but apparently didn't feel able to sustain the voice enough to do more than that without straining his vocal chords.  I can empathise. I'm able to produce a similar kind of deep, gravelly voice, which is a neat party trick but I can't keep it up for long. It really does feel like it's doing damage if I push it.  EDIT: The Dawnguard character is Jiub, in the Soul Cairn."
ElderScrolls,37srhs,Retrogamer82,9,Sat May 30 09:30:59 2015 UTC,And to add to that if anyone didn't know. Its the same Juib that wakes you up on the prisoner ship at the beginning of Morrowind. He went on to have an interesting life.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,drunkenstyle,2,Sat May 30 15:06:26 2015 UTC,This is the the best answer. It's really hard to maintain voices that strain your vocal chords. That's why Seth McFarlane hated doing the bear in the Cleveland Show.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,Laurikens,14,Sun May 31 00:23:21 2015 UTC,Probably because they are cheap bastards and used like 3 voice actors for the entirety of oblivion & skyrim
ElderScrolls,37srhs,sugarkid,10,Sat May 30 03:06:24 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'd say Skyrim is slightly better, they have like 12 VAs? But Oblivion was awful in that regard."
ElderScrolls,37srhs,Blunderbar,4,Sat May 30 11:11:47 2015 UTC,I remember reading that Oblivion had 15 or so while Skyrim had over 70.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,UpiedYoutims,3,Sat May 30 23:04:39 2015 UTC,Another thing: Wasn't it just the men?
ElderScrolls,37srhs,gartfoehammer,3,Sat May 30 04:07:50 2015 UTC,I was always thinking that inhaling the ash of Red Mountain (which would only apply to the elves on Vvardenfell) caused their voices to become rough and scratchy. The dark elves who lived in Cyrodill and Skyrim wouldn't have the same ash exposure.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,SoulCrystal,4,Sat May 30 16:16:17 2015 UTC,"Personally i hate the UK voice. Simply because the original Dunmer didn't have it. I can understand if Dunmer born in other regions don't have that grainy voice, but Dunmer that fled into Skyrim aren't going to suddenly have british voices. I hope in future installments they don't have a UK voice. Not unless the entire region does. Otherwise it doesn't make sense.   It also kinda bothers me that they took an ""otherworldly accent"" and put it in their game. No one else has an otherworldly accent, so why give one to the Dunmer?"
ElderScrolls,37srhs,ginja_ninja,7,Sat May 30 13:58:06 2015 UTC,"Actually posh British accents have kind of been the Altmer's thing for a good while. But I agree it doesn't fit on the Dunmer. Bethesda should keep them speaking Dunmerican like they're supposed to, dammit."
ElderScrolls,37srhs,JadedDarkness,2,Sat May 30 15:56:40 2015 UTC,"As others have said, the ash in Morrowind is a very likely lire explanation. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't some of the dark elves have more 'coarse' sounding voices on Solsthiem in the Dragonborn expansion?"
ElderScrolls,37srhs,n60storm4,1 point,Sat May 30 23:57:19 2015 UTC,"Only one. Jiub in the Soul Cairn is voiced by Jeff Baker who did the Dunmer voices in Morrowind, including Jiub's character."
ElderScrolls,37srhs,TekaLynn212,0,Sun May 31 02:29:21 2015 UTC,It's regional. Due to the Red Mountain blight storms which started due to Dagoth's return their voices got coarse.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,TekaLynn212,3,Sat May 30 03:52:47 2015 UTC,I'm keen on backing that theory yet in the volcanic regions of Morrowind in Elder Scrolls Online none of the inhabitants speak this way despite the ash and storms.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,TimmannenMr,2,Sat May 30 04:28:23 2015 UTC,I attribute it to specifically Vvardenfell dialect.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,zenthr,2,Sat May 30 04:46:39 2015 UTC,Then what of the refugee Dunmer escaping Red Mountain's eruption during Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim? None of them had the voice. Neither do the members of Vivec's entourage from Vvardenfell in ESO.
ElderScrolls,37srhs,OriginalPosta,1 point,Sat May 30 18:16:05 2015 UTC,Linguistic drift over centuries. Language changes and evolves.  (I didn't say it was a good head canon.) : D
ElderScrolls,37uyzw,Ridiculum,3,Sat May 30 16:50:20 2015 UTC,"I think Islamic (I think you mean Arabic) architecture would be found in Hammerfell, not Elseweyr, as it's a mix of jungle and desert.  Hammerfell is (I think) inspired by the Middle-East.  Don't quote me on this though, not a lore buff  EDIT: forgot to mention, in my opinion that would be a good contrast to the previous games, Morrowind was an alien-like land, Cyrodil was Medieval Europe kind of, and Skyrim was a cold, hard land. I think a warm climate like Elseweyr/Valenwood or Hammerfell  would be awesome for the next installment."

ElderScrolls,37uyzw,YouCantTakeThisName,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  I've always loved the Khajiit.  In Skyrim, they mention that there are entire palaces buried under the sands of Elsweyr.  Could make for awesome exploration opportunities.    Also the different types of Khajiit would be awesome.  Maybe you could have a companion Khajiit of the variety that look like house cats.  And you could buy him little armored cat sweaters.  Fuck yeah."
ElderScrolls,37uyzw,gravyboatcaptain2,0,Wed Jun 3 23:13:05 2015 UTC,"I would love that, but having a land full of cat people won't be mainstream so I doubt Bethesda will do it."

ElderScrolls,37s0xw,Bulby37,2,Fri May 29 22:50:22 2015 UTC,I was also wondering this. Also I heard the map is huge. Is it fun to explore ? Is it detailed ?
ElderScrolls,37s0xw,Davidoff1983,2,Sat May 30 15:20:44 2015 UTC,"It's definitely huge, the debate is generally about exploration.  The quests tend to follow a linear path, but the only thing stopping you from wandering is the level of the enemies in the world (which can be avoided)."
ElderScrolls,37s0xw,Lord_Wibblington,2,Sat May 30 16:29:11 2015 UTC,That sounds cool. I kind of missed really dangerous areas like in Morrowind. Well fuck it I preordered it so I guess we'll see.
ElderScrolls,37s0xw,Davidoff1983,2,Sat May 30 18:50:50 2015 UTC,"A friend and I went into an area we were very underleveled for shortly after launch. The tension and suspense was palpable, and it was a good experience, though we didn't accomplish much (if anything).  Pvp, on the other hand, is always a dangerous area for a noob such as myself. And there are no tricks to beat skilled players other than developing your own skills and cookie-cuttering your build. One of those works, one makes you feel like an ass when you respec because you hate the play style."
ElderScrolls,37s0xw,Bulby37,1 point,Sun May 31 02:37:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured there would be at least some MMOness.
ElderScrolls,37s0xw,Davidoff1983,0,Sun May 31 02:46:21 2015 UTC,"There's no ""exploring"" because all zones are level based, unlike skyrim/morrowind where the world levels with you. The only thing that ESO and TES have in common is the name."
ElderScrolls,37s0xw,Jedigoosemoose,2,Mon Jun 1 22:03:34 2015 UTC,"It's fun, but don't go in expecting an Elder Scrolls game. It's much closer to a typical MMORPG, complete with fetch quests and the like."
ElderScrolls,37s0xw,TylerTJ930,3,Fri May 29 22:52:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It's set in a TES setting, but you aren't the head of the guilds you quest for when the quest line ends. There still is that trope from TES games that your character is the hero of the day, but it seems less hamhanded than in the single player games. They've tried to make some constructive additions to the lore as well, which I enjoyed, but some are very critical of. It's definitely more theme park than you'd expect from a TES game, but it is largely designed so that MMO newbs aren't overwhelmed."
ElderScrolls,37s0xw,Bulby37,0,Sat May 30 02:23:08 2015 UTC,complete with fetch quests and the like   So... pretty much standard Elder Scrolls in this regard?

Are you talking about the WOW type thing, where you have to go ""collect twenty bear asses""? In that case, Skyrim only has one (bear pelts for the lumber mill owner in Ivarstead, as Lord_Wibblington pointed out). Several of the guilds in Morrowind had at least one of those at the lower levels. Daggerfall had a few of these in its random quest list.  But when I think of ""fetch quest"", I think of ""go to place x and retrieve item y"". In that case, just about every town (in Skyrim) had at least one guy that lost something in a dungeon and wants you to go fetch it for him, and the Bard's College was entirely this.  Note: I do not regard ""fetch quests"" as a bad thing."

The gameplay was very MMORPG-like, however, and the multitude of player characters running around everywhere bothered me occasionally.

One thing I would suggest is doing a bit of reading into the level up system in Oblivion as it's quite different and your starting build is very important to consider. Everything in the game levels with you until about level 26 I believe so if you choose the wrong stats you may run into some trouble.

So you basically have 3 options that I can think of, don't level untill you are sufficiently strong in your weapon category and sneak, turn down the difficulty slider in the options menu, or take heavy advantage of OP weapons that you can get early like Umbra and keep a stock of health damage poisons. The Darkbrotherhood questline gives you some solid gear for being an assassin and the Thieves Guild is also good for sneaky types. To join the DBH just kill somebody, if you're concerned about killing an important NPC you can google optimal targets, some are unimportant and some actually respawn. To join the Thieves guild I think you bribe beggars in the imperial city and then talk to them about the Thieves Guild.   For a Mage:   I think in Oblivion it's harder to be a mage hybrid than it is to be a pure mage. In Oblivion the amount of mana your spells cost is proportionate to the level of skill you have in the school of magic you are using. Also whenever you level up you get to assign attribute points to int/str/end/spe/agi etc and you get bonuses for leveling skills relevent to the stat. So basically you want to level up your skills as much as possible or people will overwhelm you if you just try to use magic on them. The best way to level your mage skills is to make really cheap cost spells and spam them while holding down the block button which will reduce your cast time for some reason. Destro and Resto are a little different however because you need a target for Destro and for Resto you need to be damaged, so what you can do is make a damage yourself destro spell and then heal yourself. You can also manage your levels like an assassin but Mages are frankly a little bit easier to get stronger at a good rate so it's not as big a deal. Just some monsters you will need to kite, pay attention because as a mage typically the gear you get will not have as much armor value. The Mages Guild is great but frankly so is the Fighters Guild, you don't really need to be a mage or a fighter to join either and some rewards you get are leveled so you might want to get them later."

The rules are simple 1: No fast travel unless a magic build. 2: Do as your character would stupid decision or not. 3: no looking like an assassin, thief, or hunter/slayer in public. 4: dungeon diving without legal guild permission or authorization from someone with the authority is illegal and punishable by dungeon time. If rule 3 or 4 is broken in the vicinity of a gaurd, captain, or someone of legal authority you add bounty or punch someone to enact the AI to act on it. I find that spices the game up well and makes things trickier."

ElderScrolls,37s2aq,TylerTJ930,17,Fri May 29 22:51:48 2015 UTC,"Historically, Bethesda has hedged with such situations. The Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall, had a bunch of different possible endings, which had vastly different consequences. When developing Morrowind, therefore, they reconciled this by inventing the concept of a ""dragonbreak"", a magical warp in time and space in which all possible outcomes happened, thus meaning that no matter what ending you had in Daggerfall, it actually happened, and didn't happen, simultaneously.  The book Where Were You When the Dragon Broke? is one of the in-game ways of talking about this bit of history/lore.  Given that they've applied the concept of a dragon break to multiple historical events, I think they'd have ample ground to do something similar with Skyrim's ending."

The Aldmeri Dominion existed before the Empire did, but didn't exist during the entirety of the Septim dynasty, which goes right up to the end of Oblivion, so there wouldn't be any information in earlier games about the third Aldmeri Dominion (the one in Skyrim).

ElderScrolls,37ipoj,TheNebula-,6,Wed May 27 22:39:52 2015 UTC,"I want to see a complete gameplay overahaul. I love TES games, but I think the devs need to take a step back and look at how to improve the gameplay at its core. A lot of the mechanics in even Skyrim are outdated and shallow.   They need to implement an evasion mechanic to make light, mobile builds more viable and a poise type of system for heavy armor builds. Dodging is pretty much impossible, making high defense the only way to survive at higher levels. Light attacks with large weapons should stagger more than with small weapons, power attacks with tiny daggers shouldn't stagger dragons, etc. Stamina should regenerate faster so stamina management is more important, not just boiling down to spamming power attacks and using potions. Healing and attribute restoration should not be able to be accomplished in the inventory while the game is paused. Drinking potions should lock you into an animation so you make yourself vulnerable while healing. The ability to keep a stack of 500 health potions in your inventory completely negates the benefits of Restoration spells and makes the game too easy. A new leveling system that doesn't make use of the ""practice"" method (your skills increase by repetition). The practice method encourages you to squat behind a guard for 5 hours to level sneak, or constantly be casting Mage Light or something to level Illusion. I'm more of a fan of a basic EXP system. Give every weapon its own viable use. The Iron<Steel<Elven<Dwarven etc thing encourages players to run around with the exact same weapons because there is a hierarchy where one weapon is just straight up superior to the previous with absolutely no difference in moveset or effects, just better damage. Give Iron Swords a special niche like higher stagger, or give Elven Swords faster swing speed or something. Make it impossible to become the guildmaster of every guild on one character at the same time. You can't run 3 guilds at once and still have time to run around and punch bears and shit. In fact, becoming guildmaster shouldn't even be an option unless there are tasks related to actually running the guild. In every guild in Skyrim and Oblivion, becoming guildmaster is just a pin on your shirt and not an actual duty to uphold. You can become the leader of the Dark Brotherhood and then ignore the faction for the rest of the game, it makes no sense. Make it impossible to craft rare weapon types. A mortal shouldn't be able to craft Daedric weapons and armor, which are legendary artifacts from other planes of existence and are supposed to be extremely rare. Also you shouldn't be able to craft Dwarven weapons for a similar reason as Daedric, they are very rare and the secret to their construction has been lost. I'd be okay with going to certain smiths who can make those weapons for you, but you certainly shouldn't be able to just go and make them at some lower class blacksmith's forge in a couple of minutes."

Even though the materials are rare, you shouldn't be able to just craft it at a forge like any other piece of armor. Some kind of ritual to create the armor or summoning a high level Dremora Lord for a duel for the armor would be much more interesting than just combining two semi-rare ingredients at a normal forge to create legendary demonic armor that is supposed to be one of the rarest artifacts on Tamriel."
ElderScrolls,37ipoj,GigaPotato,3,Sun Jun 7 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything /u/GigaPotato said, but I'd add something to the bit about leveling.    I like the practice-oriented experience system, but there should definitely be a limit to how many iron daggers you can craft while still increasing your skill. Maybe you can't earn more than 10 or 15 levels in a skill doing the same thing? Obviously, Sneaking is just sneaking so this wouldn't apply to every skill. Another thing I'd like to add is a legitimate crafting system. Skyrim made leaps and bounds with this in comparison to the previous games (especially with Hearthfire), but more could have been done. Cooking, for example, was a complete feature of the game, but it lacked its own skill tree. That would have been nice. Cooking brings me nicely into my next topic: food. Food shouldn't be so useless, given the frequency with which it occurs in the game world. At low levels, you can eat 14 steaks to heal a broken toe. At high levels, food is just absolute garbage. I think perhaps some sort of hunger bar could be added. You wouldn't need to eat, but it would greatly affect the regen of your stats. If your hunger is at 0, your stats regenerate at 15% of their normal speed. Maybe sleeping could be useful again as well. One thing I liked about Oblivion was the fact that you had to sleep to level up. It felt like I was a normal human being with a (somewhat) regular sleep schedule. Walking around town at 4 AM, waking all the shopkeepers up, is silly. Maybe you'd experience tiredness (reduced stamina/carry weight/speed) from never sleeping? Maybe the old leveling up mechanic could be brought back to a degree, too. In order to spend perk points, you'd have to sleep (makes sense to me as Skyrim's skill screen looked very much like a dream)."

It would make more sense with crafting skills. Repetition is pretty much how magic is improved in the lore and in the games because a lot of the spells are just stronger versions of the same kind, and even with spamming things like Muffle, you are using that school appropriately.   Spamming Soul Trap? Well...Conjuration is reanimation and summoning focused, and again, a lot of the reanimation and summoning spells are the same. Just stronger versions."

ElderScrolls,37ipoj,ThatGuy743,2,Mon Jun 1 21:42:50 2015 UTC,"The ability to create half-breeds. TES is a role-playing game, right?  More than Bretons and Altmer having meaningful magic buffs. Magic is in everything in the lore and nowhere does it say only Bretons and Altmer can be good at it. Give the rest something, or add some shit. Arcane archery...something. I fucking hate how the game mechanics has lead fans to ask those stupid fucking questions of which race they should choose for a magic based class. Any fucking one you fucking idiot! Oh, no magic buffs for you lore-deficient? Well, what the fuck do spellswords, battlemages and nightblades use? Swords and armor. What reserve is more important for that? Stamina. Then pick a fucking Redguard. Rant over. Spell-crafting. Spell charging, with the ability to move. Instead of wasting slots with stronger versions of the same spell, let the levels determine how long it takes to charge them, as well as how much it would cost. Level 20-30 charges would be moderate for a user whose skill is in that range, fairly quick and not as exhausting when the skill is 50 or something. That would fights more fun as well.  Consequences for a play style. A stamina based character should not be able to ease through a mage faction. Mages should not struggle to kill muggles at a distance early on, or at any point. Rogue players should be punished for hacking it out with muggles in heavy armor. That would make followers more important for certain quests. Reintroduce stats like willpower and speed, allowing the player to adjust them like they were allowed to do in Daggerfall rather than forcing them to be stuck with something that does not fit what they want to role-play. Reintroduce major and minor skills but without classes decided for them. Let the players create their classes with reminding them their actions have consequences. Standard magic attack that cost nothing. Why do muggles get to swing their swords without losing stamina whilst a mage has to use a spell for something as basic as a weak attack? That would also work well with the charge system. Tap, simple lighting spark. Just a little pew pew, pew pew. Hold that bish and release? Kaboom!"

ElderScrolls,37fihb,serafin29413,2,Wed May 27 20:19:20 2015 UTC,Here is another good video that highlights some advantages Morrowind has over Skyrim:  Main Quest Comparison: Skyrim & Morrowind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wujJnlsJh4  Note: linked video contains minor spoilers for Morrowind's main storyline.
ElderScrolls,37fihb,MyrMindservant,9,Wed May 27 22:05:37 2015 UTC,"You liked the diverse world in Oblivion? Then you're set for Morrowind. If you've already played the Dragonborn DLC for Skyrim you caught a glimpse of it in Raven Rock and its outskirts. Giant Jellyfishes, huge bugs with an hollowed-out carapace so we can drive them and use them as transportation, volcanic areas, houses grown out of magical mushrooms... Morrowind have the most alien world of the Elder Scrolls series. If you got interested in the Lore of the Elder Scrolls, there's also a fair amount of important and interesting lore in it.  Negatives are, it's old, both in terms of gameplay and graphics. Graphics you can find mods around to mitigate that aspect, but don't expect the kind of combat you have in Oblivion or Skyrim. Every time you attack there's an invisible dice roll to determine if you hit your target or not, and it's pretty frustrating at the beginning of the game to miss a damn rat or mudcrab half the time. I don't consider it a negative but forget about quest location arrows too. If an NPC tells you to go east until you find a bridge, cross it, and turn left, then you have to exactly do that without other indications.  In a nutshell, Morrowind is great for its world, and ambiance, but coming from newer TES games the mechanics might be hard to get used to.  Also, don't do like I did and pick up a mage with no magicka birthsign. You'll end up with 100 MP (one per point in Int) and won't be able to cast anything."
ElderScrolls,37fihb,Fastolph,3,Wed May 27 22:34:14 2015 UTC,"I always do the Atronach birthsign, the one with no magicka regen, but a huge mana pool. It's easy enough to deal with. I use magic as a utility (unlocking doors, levitate, etc) so I never really ran out. I just make sure to join the makes guild , make the rounds to all the guild halls and steal their free, infinitely respawning potions."
ElderScrolls,37fihb,NDWolfwood5268,2,Wed May 27 08:29:30 2015 UTC,And there we hit one of the others defining characteristics of Morrowind: insane exploits to make you stupidly powerful.
ElderScrolls,37fihb,Fastolph,2,Wed May 27 15:46:01 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be an Elder Scrolls game any other way, would it? Looking at you, Skyrim alchemy."
ElderScrolls,37fihb,NDWolfwood5268,4,Wed May 27 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"So unlike you playing backwards, Skyrim first, then to Oblivion, then to Morrowind, I'm playing all the ""modern"" ones in order, starting with Morrowind. It was fuckin' amazing. Going from Morrowind to Oblivion, the environmental diversity in Oblivion is null compared to what's in Morrowind. The only time I really got a sort of alien feel in Oblivion was when I went to the Shivering Isles.  I feel like Oblivion and Skyrim are trying harder to be... well, video games than Morrowind is. They don't suck you into the world as much as Morrowind does, with its silt striders (rather than just teleporting anywhere), diverse alien world, amazing story, detailed quest journal that actually works like a journal (whoa dude), etc.  Yeah it's clunky, yeah its graphics are dated, but it still holds up as the best Elder Scrolls game to date, in my opinion.  Also, copy/pasted from another comment:  I feel like I'm the only one who's not bothered by [the hit or miss dice roll combat system]. I mean, when you're super shitty at everything, at the start of the game, of course you're going to miss a lot. After you practice a bunch you get way better. By the time you're like level 50 in any weapon skill, you'll hardly ever miss unless you have no stamina, which makes sense."
ElderScrolls,37fihb,rct3fan24,17,Wed May 27 17:22:52 2015 UTC,"Negative: You're going to need mods just to make the game playable. The bodies and combat animations are clunky as fuck and the graphics really need updated. It's still a great game, just parts of it really haven't aged well. Thankfully there are lots that still maintain that vanilla feel.  Positive: It's a lot more complex, the system kind of has that old school D&D feel to it. The landscape is incredibly beautiful and interesting, the story is richer and the world-building is up to Bethesda's usual standards. Also the music is (IMO) the best in the series."
ElderScrolls,37fihb,nanbullen,7,Wed May 27 16:51:01 2015 UTC,"As long as we're putting up personal opinions: I disagree that Morrowind requires modding in order to make it playable (I started out on Skyrim and moved to Morrowind).  Yes, the graphics, animation, etc are dated, but it's still very playable.  The mechanics take a bit to get used to, but once I realized that that was how I was going to play the game, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  And yeah, it does crash on occasion or your follower gets stuck within a flight of stairs or just up and disappears for whatever reason after taking a ride on a silt strider/boat.  I found I just got used to the look of everything after a few minutes of playing.  153 hours of unmodded fun.  Arena took a bit longer for me to get used to and I still had a lot of fun with that game."
ElderScrolls,37fihb,Jaconian,2,Wed May 27 08:26:53 2015 UTC,Your opinion is of course valid but in no way are you in the majority. I'm actually curious why you wouldn't take advantage of mods that simply update the graphics and some of the meshes?
ElderScrolls,37fihb,nanbullen,3,Wed May 27 23:40:10 2015 UTC,"Personally I haven't found any that I like.  Admittedly I haven't looked all that hard; I hate installing mods and since I appreciate vanilla Morrowind, I don't have much motivation to seek them out.  I got Morrowid Graphics Extender and uninstalled it immediately.  Being able to see so far is actually a bad thing in my opinion.  It makes everything look closer, which kind of ruins the feeling of vastness Morrowind originally has.  I've tried texture replacers too and I just don't like how they alter the atmosphere of the game.  I'm sure it's a nostalgia thing.  I don't really get why graphics are so important to people.  Skyrim doesn't look like real life either, people are just more forgiving of that because it's newer."

ElderScrolls,37fihb,TimmannenMr,2,Wed May 27 17:21:18 2015 UTC,Yes it is playable but so is Arena. But that doesn't change the fact that the game play and graphics of the early TES games have aged closer to milk than fine wine.

ElderScrolls,37fihb,TimmannenMr,3,Wed May 27 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"Freedom to go anywhere at any time, and do anything you want.  The later games prevent you from killing certain people, and certain doors/chests are locked until you get the quest involving them.. in Morrowind you LITERALLY can go anywhere and do anything.  You don't even have to go through the ""normal route"" to complete the main quest. Massive game world.  You think skyrim with it's 9 or so cities is big?  That's cute.  (Yes I know Oblivion and Skyrim have more square footage, but empty wilderness isn't all that exciting.) Unique setting.  Morrowind is like an alien planet with it's own ecosystem, flora and fauna not found in any other game world, whereas most of the monsters and animals in Oblivion and Skyrim are standard fantasy fare you've seen over and over again. It's harsh, it's unforgiving, it does not hold your hand.  You have the potential to become a superpower if you survive, far more powerful than you could be in the later games thanks to powerful enchanting and spellmaking and unique weapons scattered throughout the world.  But you have to survive long enough to achieve these things, and you have to figure them out by yourself.  (Well you could look it up online, but I mean NPCs don't coddle you.) Treasure hunting.  When I go in a cave in Morrowind, I might find a powerful ancient artifact or a secret burial.  When I go in a cave in Oblivion, I know exactly what I'm going to find, a few gold coins and some weapons appropriate to my level. You can get lost.  Morrowind makes you pay attention to where you are, look at a map, and think about where you need to go.  Being lost can be exhilarating, too.  (If you don't have the paper map that originally came with the game, use this http://www.uesp.net/maps/mwmap/mwmap.shtml) Amazingly intricate, interesting, and LONG main quest.  Oblivion had a really good main quest too though, but Morrowind's is still better.  But you will have to pay attention to lore things (like reading books) to get the full impact of what is going on. Morrowind feels like another world.  Not like just a game."

Personally I don't have it installed, because I didn't really bother to get it until I had a whole bunch of other mods. When I did install it it totally broke my game, because of mod conflicts. Half of Chorrol was missing etc. etc. I dunno why. So uh... make sure to install this first!  C'mon, it's really not that hard to do a 3 second google search and copy the link. :P"

I played Morrowind and Oblivion when they first released, So now when I go back to it it's a rush of memories. In the beginning I didn't really like oblivion. But once I powered through the first 20 hours it was love.  When I played Fallout 3 for the first time I felt like it was an extension of the Bethesda engine. So I can definitely see where your coming from."
ElderScrolls,37dxs7,Inthepaddedroom,8,Wed May 27 21:26:34 2015 UTC,Oblivion has the best of Morrowind and the simplicity of Skyrim. I think questing feels less grindy in Oblivion as well. Try Oblivion first.
ElderScrolls,37dxs7,NickMotionless,3,Tue May 26 23:28:48 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say Oblivion is simple. Especially with the way leveling was so jacked up. I would recommend Skyrim first because it has the smallest learning curve.
ElderScrolls,37dxs7,drekstorm,5,Thu May 28 04:42:05 2015 UTC,"I'd go with Oblivion first (with mods if you're playing on PC, especially DarN UI because the UI was made for console play and it SUCKS.)   Then you can go on to either Morrowind or Skyrim. Morrowind is a little bit slow and clunky, but the environmental diversity, interesting story, immersive world, etc. more than make up for it. If you're into that sort of thing, definitely go for Morrowind. In my opinion, Morrowind is still the best Elder Scrolls game. Definitely try it at some point.  Skyrim's alright, I guess. I haven't played much of it yet since I started playing through them all in order recently. I've had it for a while, I just never got very far in the main quest, and started over a few times, I only have like 20 hours in it. It's definitely smoother than Morrowind, but it just doesn't have that alien feel that Morrowind has. It looks really good, but it doesn't look very vibrant and colorful like Oblivion and in some places, Morrowind. Skyrim's definitely a good game, I'm not trying to dis it. If you prefer the graphics, smoothness, and exciting...ness of Skyrim over Morrowind's immersive, diverse, interesting world and story, go ahead.  Edit: One more mod I recommend for Oblivion is OCO, or Oblivion Character Overhaul. It makes people's faces not look like shit, and look more like they actually are part of the Elder Scrolls races. For example, Dunmer have more pointed facial features, and sometimes facepaint, Nords look more rugged, etc."

It doesn't hold your hand at all, has an excellent story and characters, the quests feel substantial and the lack of over powered fast travel makes the world seem enormous, as it should.   The only drawback Morrowind has is its combat system. If you play Morrowind, I highly recommend installing some sort of combat mod, as the hit-and-miss system will cause someone used to modern rpg systems to rage.   Other than that, Morrowind was the first Elder Scrolls game I ever played, and to this day still the best."

ElderScrolls,37dxs7,Inthepaddedroom,1 point,Wed May 27 07:57:32 2015 UTC,Morrowind is not using D&D ruleset and it is not simulating d20 rolls. It has it's own formulas to calculate your success in various situations that are mostly more complex than what you would find in D&D.  For example here are formulas for calculating chance to hit:  Chance to Hit = Attacker's Hit Rate - Defender's Evasion Hit Rate = (Weapon Skill + (Agility / 5) + (Luck / 10)) * (0.75 + 0.5 * Current Fatigue / Maximum Fatigue) + Fortify Attack Magnitude - Blind Magnitude Evasion = ((Agility / 5) + (Luck / 10)) * (0.75 + 0.5 * Current Fatigue / Maximum Fatigue) + Sanctuary Magnitude
ElderScrolls,37dxs7,MyrMindservant,1 point,Wed May 27 22:02:20 2015 UTC,Ahh...Got it. Just looked at the wiki and found it. It is much better for a video game aspect.  For those interested:  Combat in Morrowind is relatively straight-forward. Your chance to hit can be generalized as  (Attacker's Hit Rate - Defender's Evasion)%.  Hit Rate  (Weapon Skill + (Agility / 5) + (Luck / 10)) * (0.75 + 0.5 * Current Fatigue / Maximum Fatigue) + Fortify Attack Magnitude - Blind Magnitude (Pemdas Applied)  http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Combat

ElderScrolls,37dxs7,SargeantSasquatch,1 point,Wed May 27 05:11:02 2015 UTC,"I started with Skyrim and it was a great place to start, it's the newest in the series so it feels ""modern"" and it's not particularly difficult.  The world has an amazing atmosphere.  The quests vary in quality but some are fantastic, I don't think the game deserves some of the hate it gets from TES fans.    I'm planning to work my way back through the series.  I'm playing Oblivion now.  It's also fantastic - some aspects are very similar to Skyrim but others are quite different. Oblivion is harder but the difficulty is satisfying, it feels like ""realistically"" playing in a fantasy world where you really have to work your way up.    I haven't gotten to Morrowind yet, not planning to play until I've exhausted myself on Oblivion like I did in Skyrim before getting Oblivion.  From what I hear, it has an amazing asthetic and world, but the combat and other aspects are very outdated.    If you're new to RPGs like I was when I started, I'd recommend Skyrim.  If you already are familiar with RPGs you could probably start with Oblivion or even Morrowind.  I was worried that going back to Oblivion after Skyrim would be annoying, but the key was to get hooked on the lore of the world enough to not care about relatively old graphics.  For what it's worth Oblivion still look great IMO, it's really only the faces and UI that feel dated in the vanilla game and that's not nearly enough to ruin the rewards of exploring the world."
ElderScrolls,37dxs7,THETEH,3,Wed May 27 03:33:26 2015 UTC,"The UI isn't dated, it's because it was made for consoles. Assuming you're playing on PC, I recommend installing DarN UI and Oblivion Character Overhaul, as well as Combat Stance Reanimation. Those are my three favorite mods for the game, and they fix the problems you mentioned in Oblivion. even though OCO is a piece-a-shit to install.

ElderScrolls,37dxs7,MarshManOriginal,1 point,Wed May 27 12:10:27 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd go backwards. The graphics get worse but the story gets better that way. Otherwise once you finally play Skyrim you'll be craving richer storylines like the ones in Morrowind and Oblivion (not that Skyrim is bad, mind you, just in comparison to it's predecessors it's not as well written.) Skyrim is way more user friendly, but when you love the story so much you'll get used to the harsher navigation of the other games."

ElderScrolls,37dxs7,Vorpal_Smilodon,1 point,Wed May 27 20:05:56 2015 UTC,Oblivion IMO has a superior story to Skyrim but with inferior gameplay. If graphics matter to you the most however - start with Skyrim if you're on console. Oblivion is probably fine on PC.

No exaggeration.  I've loved this series since Morrowind first came out in 2002.  I was immensely excited for Oblivion, which I enjoyed immensely, but it never quite reached the same heights as Morrowind for me (which I still go back and play to this day).  Skyrim, I felt, was a better game than Oblivion.  The world had more depth and personality, though still not the kind of originality Morrowind had.  All this to say, in spite of my fondness for Morrowind, I'm glad Oblivion and Skyrim became the games they are today.  I'd rather the series continue to evolve and move forward rather than rest on its laurels like Assassin's Creed or CoD in the name of appeasing ""true TES fanatics"".  A true TES fanatic should remember when Todd Howard famously said that the spirit of The Elder Scrolls is reinvention.  The games are all different, they'll continue to be different, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  As long as they continue to place me in beautifully crafted worlds with emergent gameplay systems and intricate lore to explore, I'll keep coming back for more."
ElderScrolls,37cmha,SiliconSynapsed,14,Tue May 26 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"My theory is basically whichever TES game was your first will be the best one. A lot of my friends think Oblivion and Morrowind is crap compared to Skyrim because they just got into it. Me, Morrowind will always triumph. Something about being put in that world for the first time makes and other ones seem to be no match"
ElderScrolls,37cmha,ChrischinLoois,3,Tue May 26 21:58:32 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with that.  I mean, your first TES game is always going to be a transformative experience, because there's just nothing like it.  It's the only series (apart from the new Fallout games) that successfully combines an open world with an immersive simulation (a la Ultima Underworld).  Then when the next game comes out, it will be different, and because it's different, there's going to be something that you miss and feel nostalgic for, but mostly you'll just be disappointed because it doesn't capture that same feeling of awe you felt when you played one of these games for the first time.  On the flip side, older games are just harder to get into.  It takes an open mind and a lot of patience for out-dated graphics and game design.  Some things invariably change for the better."
ElderScrolls,37cmha,SiliconSynapsed,1 point,Wed May 27 02:46:21 2015 UTC,Skywind. That is my most anticipated game lol combines modern gameplay with the original game
ElderScrolls,37cmha,ChrischinLoois,2,Wed May 27 22:40:08 2015 UTC,"You've hit the nail on the head I think. It's the same thing that happens with any long standing rpg series I think. If you go to an MMO's forums you see a ton of posts along the lines of ""X expansion was way better than the current one!""   Comes with the territory I think."
ElderScrolls,37cmha,Questhunter3,3,Wed May 27 22:20:58 2015 UTC,"I think some of the ""depth"" we perceive in our first game is an illusion. Getting into the world of TES the first time is a whole different thing than coming back to the world. The first time, there's an overwhelming amount of lore to learn about the world and its people and gods. Coming back for your next game, you already know all that, so that ""depth"" isn't present in the next one, you only see whats new on top of the old depth. I also think the abundance of Skyrim's radiant draugr dungeon crawl quests in particular make people see the game as lacking depth.  Also, there's just the usual nostalgia for old things. OP's criticism of Skyrim's guilds makes me think of this, because besides the murder mansion DB quest and the thieves guild final heist, none of Oblivion's guild quests were memorable to me. In fact, with the exception of those two quests, I thought they were very shallow and short. Fighters guild in Oblivion was just kill some people, kill some more people, suddenly you're the leader. Mages guild was just make a staff, kill some necromancers, suddenly you're archmage.  My first TES game was Morrowind, and to me, Skyrim was no more lacking in depth than Oblivion was."
ElderScrolls,37cmha,shikamaruispwn,4,Wed May 27 02:19:34 2015 UTC,"There's some truth to that, the notion of a ""lore learning curve"".  But I'd also say that it's hard to deny the amount of detail packed into the world and cultures of Morrowind.  It's a feat that hasn't been matched in games since, by my reckoning.  As for quests, they've certainly gotten more elaborate over time.  Morrowind had a lot of rote questings (go here, kill X of Y, take me to town Z).  That said, we still haven't seen anything like the Great House questline and, in particular, the stronghold building quests since.  I'd love to see those return in some capacity in TES VI.  I'd say my favorite quest from Oblivion was the Umbacano the Collector triplet (http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Umbacano).  It really played into one of TES' major strengths: plundering ancient dungeons for lost artifacts, but it added the unique twist of a rival dungeon explorer.    Anything involving the Count of Skingrad was also a high point."
ElderScrolls,37cmha,SiliconSynapsed,3,Wed May 27 02:55:50 2015 UTC,I just want them to keep making bigger and bigger game worlds. eue And lots of neat hidden stuff like the deadric maze thing in Skyrim.
ElderScrolls,37cmha,DivinePrince2,3,Wed May 27 04:53:16 2015 UTC,"Every game seems watered-down compared to the previous one... at first. I remember being disappointed by the tiny map, the (apparently) linear quest lines (I was wrong about this), and the slow, ponderous gameplay of Morrowind after having spent years playing Daggerfall. Then, after playing it for some time, I got used to the gameplay, discovered the incredible tapestry formed by map, quests, characters, and everything about it, and realized Morrowind was at least as good as Daggerfall.  I have to admit, that while I did eventually learn to appreciate Oblivion, I still dislike its ""theme park"" design (compared to the previous games) and its ""leveling hurts you"" gameplay.  In some objective sense (outside the action aspects), Skyrim isn't really any better than Oblivion. But to me, it feels better, because the overdeveloped cinematic quest lines of Oblivion distracted from the sandbox, while in Skyrim the sandbox takes the fore, and the quests blend in better, leaving more to the imagination.  I'm sure the next game will be as good as the previous one. The thing about really deep games is that it takes a while to find that depth. You can't just play for a few hours and go ""welp, it sucks compared to its predecessor"". Elder Scrolls games take years to properly explore.  And I'm really looking forward to it. I finally feel like I've fully experienced Skyrim (I preordered it, to give you an idea how long that took me), and I'm really, really looking forward to having that first experience with a new ES game."
ElderScrolls,37cmha,DaSaw,5,Fri May 29 05:32:16 2015 UTC,"It's funny, people said the same thing about OB when it came out.  I was quite surprised to find so many OB lovers when I came to this sub. I loved the game myself, but I remember when it came out how much hate some sectors of the playerbase heaped upon it. Everything you've said about Skyrim vs OB was said about OB vs MW. Circle of life I guess.   Beth learns from every game they release, I guess I have some confidence they know what they're doing by now."
ElderScrolls,37cmha,ZazzRazzamatazz,6,Tue May 26 19:14:06 2015 UTC,It's also easy enough to go even farther back and find people hating on morrowind because of how much it changed from daggerfall. It's an interesting and long term trend in how people react to new installments it seems.
ElderScrolls,37cmha,THETEH,2,Thu May 28 05:00:04 2015 UTC,"My hope is that Bethesda (well most RPGs for that matter) can incorporate the style of story consequences produced by CD Projekt RED with the Witcher series.  Other than that just some minor tweaks would be nice like having a more robust spell system (I still don't know why weapon skills could increase the damage of your weapon but magic skills could not do the same for spells, that seemed silly). And adding a bit more detail into quests so ppl didn't have to rely on quest marker if they chose to turn it off.  The biggest draw about TES games to me have been the immersive world building Bethesda seems to excel at and being able to ""direct your own experience"" as Todd Howard put it.   That's something TES III, IV, and V have continued including and I feel that's the biggest draw of the series."

Even when you look at the trends between games you'll see that Morrowind's guilds were pretty boring in their own way, and they improved in Oblivion, while the quality of the main story declined.

And at this point people will buy it because of the hype, and because there's nothing better.  I knew Skyrim wasn't going to be as good as the older games but I bought it anyways and all of the DLC because what else am I supposed to play?  Skyrim's not epic, but it's still pretty good.  Unless there's a dramatic shift in our culture and people start demanding harder/deeper games, nothing is going to change."

ElderScrolls,36g7oj,Elder-Traveler,4,Tue May 19 03:33:01 2015 UTC,"Bethesda is presenting under the RPG genre. Fallout and TES are RPG games. Doom is not. Therefore, there is still a chance that they will be mentioned. Perhaps we won't get a release date or a trailer, but just a mention.  Also let's not forget they presumably finished the Fallout 4 trailer in March, which would fit in nicely with a June reveal.  Also please, PLEASE read this https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/36e3qc/bethsoft_vs_bgs/?sort=confidence"
ElderScrolls,36g7oj,PowerStacheOfTheYear,2,Tue May 19 08:36:21 2015 UTC,"Let's also not forget that the leak states that Fallout 4 is being developed by Mirada Studios instead of BGS themselves, which opens up the possibility of concurrent FO4 and TES6 development.  Announcing both of those titles would certainly be a presentation worthy of scheduling their first dedicated conference.  And even if they don't announce both, it's likely that we'll see TES6 a lot sooner than we would have if BGS were developing FO4 themselves."
ElderScrolls,36g7oj,awesomejim123,5,Wed May 27 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"Everyone is so pessimistic with their predictions. It's been 6 years since fallout 3. There have been hundreds of leaks, rumors, teases- Guillermo Del Toro made a cinematic trailer for Bethesda. Job listings have been up since like 2012. Bethesda are presenting under the RPG category. I think it's safe to expect a fallout 4 mention.  And I personally don't think it's crazy to expect a fallout 4 trailer and an ES6 mention."
ElderScrolls,36g7oj,highkingnm,1 point,Mon May 25 15:00:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. First E3 presentation they've ever done makes me think they have a lot to say. With Doom revealed already there isn't too much more to show bar a bit more footage. People are talking about a new Dishonored which I find unlikely. It felt like a 1 installment (with DLC) franchise to me. It has a nice resolute ending (well multiple endings, making a sequel harder) and a prequel wouldn't sit well with me as it kind of feels that all that needs saying has been said (plus that is id, so not just in Bethesda Softworks realm to reveal as this is a BGS reveal from what I've gathered). Fallout 4 is near enough certain, if not I think we can assume that it is not happening, at least not in the near future. But even with the Fallout 4 reveal isn't big enough to warrant such a huge reveal with so much build up from the company. This sounds to me like two big announcements are coming and, looking at the past timeline on TES announcements and releases I think it's reasonably likely some TES6 news will come out. Even if it's just ""It's being made, here's like a 10 second engine demo to whet your appetite, more to follow in a few months"". That would sort of make sense what with them seeming to be aware of building Fallout hype whereas they may want to try to cultivate some more TES6 hype before release hence it could be winter/spring Fallout release, next summer/autumn TES release. Of course a lot of things could be true, but that's just my opinion on the matter."
ElderScrolls,36g7oj,Contagious_Cure,2,Mon May 25 21:22:43 2015 UTC,"Time between Morrowind release and Oblivion release was approximately 4 years.  Time between Oblivion release and Skyrim release was approximately 5.5 years.  Time between Oblivion release and Fallout 3 release was approximately 2.5 years. That being said Fallout 3 and Oblivion both shared the GameByro engine. Hell Morrowind used the GameByro engine as well.  Creation Engine and GameBryo engine are very similar. By memory Todd Howard stated in an interview that they weren't going to start making the next game until the next-gen consoles came out. Microsoft announced Xbox One in 2013 which was the same year that BGS announced that they were going to stop working on Skyrim and formally move onto their next big project.  Elder Scrolls Online took 6 years to develop (by ZOS).  Assuming a new game on a new engine plus a few additional ambitions takes 6 years. We're looking at maybe 2016? Or if they're starting from scratch from 2013, as late as 2019."

ElderScrolls,36afcj,toxictaliban111,4,Sun May 17 20:34:05 2015 UTC,I don't know if I want that in an Elder Scrolls game. I mean it'll be great but to do well would IMO double development time. But one thing I will say is Mount and Blade mounted combat puts Skyrim to SHAME.
ElderScrolls,36afcj,Contagious_Cure,2,Mon May 18 04:54:58 2015 UTC,"Love this idea.  It would also work well as an ""end-game"" for each guild questline - rather than becoming head of the guild and suddenly having nothing more to do like in older games, becoming head of the guild would start a totally new and open-ended type of gameplay where you actively manage the guild.  It could also be integrated well in to a war-themed game if TES6 ends up being focused on a war with the Dominion."
ElderScrolls,36afcj,RHPR07,2,Sun May 17 21:14:39 2015 UTC,"Then you could declare outright war on the other factions, create allies, kill them off, Mages guild vs fighters guild, thieves vs brotherhood etc etc"

From what I understand, it isn't the most practical thing to add to a game of Elder Scrolls size as of right now, due to how taxing it can be, but I think that if it could be done, it would make everything in the game more interesting. Meet a dragon in a forest? You are now surrounded by an inescapable ring of fire, with trees threatening to crush you as they thunder into the ground. Every encounter has the potential to be epic."

Buying a house, renting it out, making enough money from that to buy another house and rent it out, and repeat. If it were added to the Elder Scrolls it would have to be much slower paced than it is in Fable, considering it doesn't really take all that long to literally own everything."
ElderScrolls,36afcj,Isaac_The_Khajiit,2,Mon May 18 16:30:30 2015 UTC,"I'll piggyback off this comment but in general I would love for them to flesh out more gameplay that isn't revolved around combat. Weather systems, and an optional food/rest/injury system that was elegant enough to matter but not too convulated to be a chore.  Your real estate idea is great and when they added hearthfire to build your own home it could sort of be an extension of that. Imagine renting out a worn-down/broken home in a town and repairing it up to sell on the market.  Or heck even being able to actually make money from non-combat activities like fishing/trading/gambling!/sailing like someone else mentioned.  Todd Howard once mentioned how amazing it felt to bake bread in a game, I think the modern Elder Scrolls could do more to bring in some more ""mundane"" things to balance out all the combat focus.  Also this would allow for more utility spells to be introduced through the game as each game has been lacking more and more in the magic department.  These games do so well at creating immersive experiences and it would be nice to have such features implemented without having to rely on mods."

Like limping when hurt, leaving trails of blood, or even leaving tracks or stool so that you can track them.  Animal behavior needs to be improved by a LOT. Deer and other wildlife need to run as soon as they see you, run AWAY from you not into you, and run faster not in some weird ass slow motion like they do in Oblivion.  More flying mobs, not necessarily aggressive ones.  But just more unique creatures in general to make the world more alive.  Mounts other than horses, maybe guar or bug-like creatures similar to nix hounds.  Traveling caravans that provide fast travel, trading, and job opportunities."

Or if I save the the world, it would be neat if rumor and word spread. ""No charge for your room, your worship. Wouldn't have an inn if it weren't for you."" No more random people calling me a loser. It wouldn't even have to be that much. Just a bit of dialogue. Like in New Vegas, NCR troops are friendly if you have high reputation and cold/hostile if it is low.   So I guess what this rambling turned into is me wanting factions like in New Vegas and for NPCs to act accordingly.  TL;DR: NPCs should be more reactive, possibly factions fron New Vegas."

ElderScrolls,36aga4,WanderingThespian,5,Sun May 17 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"I support both of these. Although I do think the lack of spell crafting was justified in skyrim given that magic in general is shunned or misunderstood by 90% of its residents. It makes sense that all the spells were somewhat basic compared to ESIV where we had the mages guild, a huge library and resources for mages, and it was more widely accepted and practiced. The college of winterhold had 8ish people actually studying magic with no one else to help them thanks to the thalamor."
ElderScrolls,36aga4,hensharo,2,Mon May 18 00:14:55 2015 UTC,"I am not sure I want spellcrafting back. In previous games I found it somewhere between ""gamebreaking"" and ""annoying"". There was so much variety it was hard to envision all it's various permutations while also preparing for balance issues with it (So you had wizards leaping over mountains or permaflying or whatnot).   Now, i know it was exciting for some people to be able to go through the PROCESS, but to me it felt almost immersion breaking. I know some will argue that what could be more immersive than a clever wizards creating spells that are so powerful none can best them!?   But we may come to a balance issue here: either the devs make the game so that elaborate spellcrafting can be equaled in power/threat level by a rogue or fighter, they nerf it to the point that why would anyone want it, or they just allow it to break the game. I don't want a situation where someone has some trouble with the games' difficulty and goes online only to immediately find youtube videos that tell you how to craft spells that make the game trivial. Others will argue that it can be ""done right"", and I agree there may be a way to do that, but how much time do you want them to spend getting it ""right""?  Now I don't pretend for a moment that ""my way is the right way or the only way"", but this seems like something that can be done with mods later if the some members of the community really want it."

Like start with one like in MW. Reach a certain level and you can mark 2 places, etc"
ElderScrolls,36aga4,1speedbike,1 point,Mon May 18 12:12:45 2015 UTC,There was a spell that let you mark and teleport to that mark in morrowind. You only really need one to mark the players home.
ElderScrolls,36aga4,Invalidword,3,Mon May 18 07:58:28 2015 UTC,"Well yes that's what I'm referring to. But without fast travel, I'd also think it would be cool to be able to mark your favorite vendor, your current guild HQ, and a few other places (not talking like 10 here, because then what's the point of no fast travel?). When first learning the spell you mark one place, and can teleport there just like MW. Then you level up and eventually ""learn"" how to mark two places and are given a choice as to which place to teleport. Then level up more and eventually you get to a few maximum marked areas. This is instead of just having one mark and only being able to teleport there.   I remember in MW I always marked my stronghold, but then if I did a quest and wanted a way to return to the quest-giver quickly from out in the wilderness without Almsivi/Divine intervention and a bunch of load screens, I'd have to mark where the questgiver was and lose my stronghold mark. That's why I think it would be helpful and not TOO close to fast travel to have like, say, 4 or 5 maximum marks when you're fully leveled up."
ElderScrolls,36aga4,1speedbike,13,Mon May 18 21:26:38 2015 UTC,"Logged in after a long time just to comment here. Bring back actual stats, and not that ""health, stamina and mana"" stuff, leveling stats like strength and intelligence is something that is pretty much needed for an RPG."

ElderScrolls,36aga4,Jedigoosemoose,0,Mon May 18 00:53:34 2015 UTC,"I agree it didn't work so well in Oblivion, but only because of the wonky multiplier system that screws you over if you improve your primary skills too quickly. It would have been better if you could just allocate 10 points into any stat, or something along those lines. I'd still much prefer 8 unique attributes over 3 dumbed down attributes."
ElderScrolls,36aga4,MasturbatingCatfish,1 point,Tue May 19 20:13:05 2015 UTC,i have the same complaint.  my solution is that you get the same number of stats every time (ex 10) and they automatically are allocated based on the skills you use.  then you could lose stats in one pool (like not training = lose muscle) by just using magic to gain int(practicing magic) or vice versa. or trainers.

ElderScrolls,36aga4,ChristianPrime,3,Tue May 19 21:18:14 2015 UTC,"Alchemy shouldn't be so stingey. I think if you put a poison on a blade it should last for a number of swings or at least a set period of time as opposed to just one swing. I think you should be able to poison quivers of arrows, say 10 arrows at a time. You could also have the option to ""clean"" the weapon, taking the poison effects off it in case you want to change the applied poison. It would make it much more worthwhile investing skill points in alchemy and make it actually useable.   With regards to guilds I really enjoyed starting off at the bottom and working my way up the ranks in Oblivion; I really felt like I earned my position in the guild. The only guild story I feel skyrim really pulled off well was the dark brotherhood. Bring back guild ranks! it doesn't have to be for all guilds but it would make sense in the fighters' or mages' guild."
ElderScrolls,36aga4,sb14g10,3,Tue May 26 04:18:06 2015 UTC,"I've always sort of hoped that the devs keep an eye on fan forums and already know a lot about what fans would like to see in future titles.    Still I could see this potentially being a helpful way to highlight top-priority things.  For me, the most important thing about TES isn't combat or action but rather open-endedness, depth, freedom of choice and immersiveness, so if the next game emphasizes those things I'll be happy.  I care most about improved depth compared to previous games (much more complex interaction with NPCs, more clear impact of your choices on the world, less linear stories/dungeons, more complexity to the ""roleplay"" elements)."

ElderScrolls,36aga4,FusRoeDah,1 point,Sun May 17 21:20:25 2015 UTC,I think it would be good to be able to parry with your weapon. That would make the choice of using a heavy weapon (like a mace) or a Light weapon (sword) more relevant as you could intercept a blow faster with a sword.

However, if every artifact/relic just had a cool unique spell or effect or had a damage that leveled with you (but under by a few levels to make new found weapons a bit stronger until end game) then I would feel way better about finding chillrend in my second hour of play instead of cursing the puny enchantment of a low level weapon."
ElderScrolls,36aga4,dude_who_could,1 point,Mon May 18 04:44:34 2015 UTC,Another idea I have is to bring back Oblivion stats where you gain them based on the skills you use. But with one fix and a twist.   Make it so efficient leveling doesn't become a thing again.. breaks immersion like crazy Maybe even require a certain amount of stat for a skill in some trees such as 60 strength >> power bash perk can be bought. Have attributes that have skills that go unused (even at level cap) degrade and move over to attributes with skills you use more. I feel like this mimics forgetting how to do something after a long time and could perhaps be limited by perks such as in #2. ex. strength won't lower below 60 while you have power bash unlocked Allow repeatable guild quests to boost up a stat in end game such as agility in a sneaky thieves guild job.   I feel like our PC's have the ability to become experts of everything at one moment. Even if you were immortal I could imagine losing muscle(strength) while studying magic or forgetting(losing int) obscure magic while training for combat. It also limits the skills to be used at any one moment while simultaneously allowing one single character to change roles at any point(due to their personal interest changing) which i feel is more immersive than having multiple characters.

There are heaps on new books, NPCs and quests which explore aspects of the lore we've been wondering about for a while. They also embrace the issues with the alliances. You can tell the people in alliance don't want to be in an alliance. They've put quests, dialogue and books in the game all around that and it's really interesting and fun.  No lore errors (except for Cyrodiil but that was retconned for Oblivion), and the game play is definitely expanded and it's getting better now that crime and a Skyrim-like perk system was added."

ElderScrolls,362ge6,DrPineappleButts,1 point,Sat May 16 03:53:57 2015 UTC,"From what I understand  (based on the dwarf fortress rules for this thing)   It's one save file that we each take turns playing. Each person has a limited amount of time, something like 2-3 weeks, to play the save file before reposting it so the next person can play that character. The person who's playing takes tons of screenshots and puts together a fun story of all their activities while they've been playing and basically shares the events of the character's in-game life. They've got to go all out with story and pics too. Not just ""and then I joined the thieves guild."" Things are often more fun with deliberate handicaps like -     no killing anyone,   can't leave a town or city until every adult has been pickpocketed,   must kill a goat or chicken before leaving town,  No fast travel,  Kill one guard before leaving a city,  Turn one person into a vampire before leaving the town,  Certain types of armor and weapons only,    And most importantly, if you die, you die. That's the end of that save file and everyone starts a new story. The fun comes from being honest about how you died too, because it's fun to read about stupid deaths like falling or forgetting about the poison etc.  The whole purpose is to share the story with the community so s document everything, embrace mistakes, and dive head first. Since we're not playing dwarf fortress then we'd all have to agree to a short list of non conflicting mods if we all wanted to play the same save."
ElderScrolls,362ge6,thinkpadius,2,Sat May 16 09:05:27 2015 UTC,I would be totally down to do this.  Maybe even something like adding a rule or removing one with the proper circumstances.

ElderScrolls,362ge6,hotblondeboob,1 point,Sat May 16 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"Skyrim would probably be the most playable. I don't think anyone would want to do Oblivion without a ton of mods to change the faces because they're terrible. Morrowind is old enough that many people could get past the graphics, and if you installed the mod package like Morrowind d 2011 (or whatever it's called now) then you'd probably be okay.  The important thing about Morrowind is that some of the enjoyment comes from letting the player fill in the gaps in art and sound from their own imaginations so it definitely could be played. The only danger is that it can be quite difficult to play and the early levels of the game are lethal."

Stop using the passive voice. The passive voice is the biggest hindrance to understanding in writing. You don't come across as educated and charming when it's clear that you can't make your point in a simple and concise way.   Stop using the third person in your sentences. E.g. One hopes for spells that would truly tip the balance of  the battle. It's your opinion, so use the first person singular. Own it. I hope for spells... Embrace reddit formatting like bolds and italics to make your points stand out. I suggest you pick up Strunk & White's The Elements of Style for the best guide to writing well.     As for your points on the game:   I see your point about all magic sharing formulaic progression in skyrim, but I disagree about the building - block analogy. You can't actually craft spells in the game, unlike Morrowind or even in a bit in Oblivion - those were much more building-block-esque. I'm also going to agree with you and say that destruction magic was made incredibly powerful in Skyrim. To the point where being a pure mage makes you practically invincible. Nevertheless, you can play a pure mage without once using destruction and have an amazing game experience that feels far more magical. I tend to center the game around illusion magic and vampirism during those playthroughs. Summoning weapons or beasts as needed, using restoration etc. When you forego destruction you end up with a fully rounded mage that uses all schools. It feels much more magical that way. I completely agree that spell creation should be brought back. There are quests for master levels of each spell school, so I think you've already solved one of your own problems there."

Story telling and writing has generally improved over the years, but story telling is just not a new concept in video games.  Check out Lunar: the silver star story complete warning: spoilers.  This is from a remake from 16 years ago of a game that was originally released 23 years ago. Did you think video games until the past few years only consisted of plumbers jumping on turtles?"
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,Nalessa,29,Wed May 13 20:18:46 2015 UTC,"Magic is so commonplace that a lot of modern technology such as firearms are not necessary.  Plus, I think it would be totally out of place in the setting."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,Squidkidz,5,Wed May 13 23:00:03 2015 UTC,"There could be a kind of Magitek firearm that casts spell enchantments instead of firing bullets.

Keep it to the mods."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,magnanimous_xkcd,16,Wed May 13 23:40:35 2015 UTC,Wouldn't a firearm that shoots magic enchantments be functionally the exact same as a staff though? What would the point of making a staff that looks like a gun?
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,the_almighty_cheese,2,Thu May 14 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"Ease of use perhaps. You make a staff that has an insane amount of charges and is specifically geared toward on-target spells' efficiency. Instead of holding it awkwardly all the time, you hold it like a gun, complete with handle and all, since you're not going to use such a specialized staff for another purpose.  It can work, I think, but in general I agree. Like steam power being ""invented"" in Ancient Greece but lacking the purpose of use or technology to make it safe, I don't think there's much motivation in a high-magic fantasy world to create firearms technology."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,Saeta44,-1,Sat May 16 17:52:18 2015 UTC,"The point would be that it would look like a gun? I mean, what's the point in making a short sword, when you can make a long sword?  Edit: Sorry didn't make myself clear. I mean the point would be more then just looks. The weapon would be balanced and used in different situations/scenarios.

ElderScrolls,35v9k8,Godzilla_Stomps,2,Fri May 15 03:12:31 2015 UTC,"There is a point to short sword vs long sword... Short is one handed, faster, weaker, and has a SHORTER range and long sword often needs 2 hands, is slower, is stronger, and has a LONGER range.  The technology is already more advanced in TES than in our real world so making a gun or making gunpowder would be pointless when you already have the equivalent of all technology and eve more advanced things."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,FlamingSnot93,1 point,Thu May 14 19:59:02 2015 UTC,Yeah but adding a new weapon to the game has just as much potential as short sword vs. longsword. That's the whole reason behind RPGs.
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,Godzilla_Stomps,3,Fri May 15 03:10:49 2015 UTC,A modder and a game developer have a much different finesse to the way they implement something new to the game. You shouldn't let a poorly executed mod ruin the idea of firearms for you
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,divinedpk,2,Wed May 13 20:54:51 2015 UTC,Thrown weapons would be cool but I feel gunpowder weaponry is not super far fetched especially since you could implement/tie it to the alik'r. I guess I just feel flintlocks and scimitars are meant to be side by side
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,divinedpk,5,Wed May 13 21:08:56 2015 UTC,I kinda have to disagree that they don't belong here. I think it's more along the lines of modern mechanical firearms not having a place in skyrim.  Why should it be omitted when we have had gunpowder since the 9th century? The Chinese have been using it for hundreds of years for numerous types of projectiles.  Perhaps modders need to turn their focus to the akviri instead of the dwemer?
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,Inthepaddedroom,3,Wed May 13 21:10:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with the original comment not for the fact that they wouldn't fit, but more for the fact that they wouldn't be needed. When you can do various things like turn invisible, blast fire and ice from your palms, and summon undead hordes of monsters. Is there really a need for someone to create guns? Anyone who is interesting in creating more efficient ways to kill would either look into alchemy classes for poison or magic classes for more efficient ways to kill. It doesn't belong in the universe because there are many other alternatives, not because the technology shouldn't exist."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,OhBill,10,Wed May 13 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"We are also talking about a world that has no parallels to our own beyond just weapons they use for melee and archery combat. If something like gun powder was planning to be used, we probably would have seen it with the Dwemers"
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,PowerStacheOfTheYear,9,Wed May 13 22:10:55 2015 UTC,"We have.  Or we've at least seen some form of controlled explosives.  In one of the quests in Tribunal, you use a Dwemer satchel pack to blow away some rubble in a Dwemer ruin.  If all of a sudden we found a ton of firearms and everyone started using them, that would be one thing, but I don't think that one or two prototype firearm using the explosives that the Dwemer had already created would be disruptive to the existing lore.  I mean, with their expertise in engineering and the fact that they had already created explosives, I would be surprised in some Dwemer somewhere hadn't built such a weapon."

ElderScrolls,35v9k8,KiboshWasabi,5,Sat May 16 17:44:36 2015 UTC,While I'll agree with the general consensus that firearms wouldn't fit within the lore and the settings I have to add the stipulation thus far. I see no reason why future iterations of the series couldn't include something along this line. Logically the further progression of time on Nirn and the natural advancement of technology will reach this point eventually.
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,negatrom,7,Sat May 16 19:12:03 2015 UTC,"Doesn't fit the setting i'm afraid, lore wise. Elder Scrolls has changed its setting bit by bit in its series, but its technological level stood the same for thousands of years, its just how the developers want it to be.  Technologically speaking, muskets and explosives were already invented (by china i think) during the feudal period, however they were so weak, slow and inaccurate that bows were the best choice by far.  Although Fire Salts could work as some sort of gunpowder I guess...  Then again, in a realm where people already throw fireballs in one another, and are able to use telekinesis, I don't see guns happening."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,OhBill,6,Sat May 16 19:16:20 2015 UTC,Don't give them ideas with the fire salts!

None of the Akaviri races have the want, or prowess to actually put forth the research to achieve gunpowder.  It just doesn't fit into the high fantasy theme that Elder Scrolls has."

How do you know the firearms would even work? Maybe the Laws of Physics are completely different in Nirn."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,autowikibot,1 point,Fri May 15 15:07:51 2015 UTC,"If that was true, people never would have bothered to invent the bow and crossbow. But it isn't, and alchemy could be considered science, and a blade or arrow dipped in a poison that's created by alchemy can be just as, if not more dangerous then alot of magic spells.  And like pointed out multiple times before, the dwemer had explosives, so it exists."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,Godzilla_Stomps,1 point,Sat May 16 00:48:08 2015 UTC,"But alchemy is part of magic school. At least it was before Skyrim moved it to stealth tree.  How can you be sure the dwemer explosives are not another type of enchanted items? We have examples that dwemer technology is more reliant on magic (all automatons operate using magical soul gems) than science.   There are steam machines in dwemer ruins, but they look primitive and crude - at an infant stage of steam technology (not like complex automatons). I imagine ancient Greeks in out world would have used similarly looking machines if they would have further developed their Steam Engine.  My point is, you have to have a solid scientific background for firearms to become common in society of Tamriel. When I played the games I have not seen anyone trying to do scientific research. Everyone is interested only in magic."

In the 1st century AD, Hero of Alexandria described the device,   and many [which?] sources give him the credit for its invention.

The name – derived from the Greek word Αἴολος and Latin word pila – translates to ""the ball of Aeolus"", Aeolus being the Greek god of the air and wind.  Pre-dating Hero's writings, a device called an aeolipile was described in the 1st century BC by Vitruvius in his treatise De architectura; however, it is unclear whether it is the same device or a predecessor, as there is no mention of any rotating parts.

ElderScrolls,35v9k8,comkiller,4,Sun May 17 09:37:22 2015 UTC,"h8rs gonna h8.  I think it could be done well. Fable II pulled off guns in a very cool way, and I think Elder scrolls could pull it off too, in their own way of course.  Like /u/PowerStacheOfTheYear already mentioned it has been shown that the Dwemer had discovered or invented some sort of explosive. It's not unreasonable to imagine it being discovered by Man/Mer/Other, either in dwemer ruins or independently, and used for other things, such as basic firearms, or maybe even something as advanced as some sort of combustion engine.  I'm not saying the technological setting of the whole world would be changed. It could be isolated to a small quest line, or maybe a small village setting. It could be one mad scientist using a combination of dwemer technology, magic, and his own technology. he could get you to collect the explosive (or it's ingredients) from Dwemer ruins or other places and then he rewards you with some of his inventions as payment.  Really I don't understand all the anti-gun circlejerk around here."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,expendableyouth,4,Sun May 17 09:37:44 2015 UTC,Could be interesting. I'm open to change implemented well.

I'm not talking about a desert eagle or w/e btw, I'm talking about these kind of pistols http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/guns/images/e/e0/Pistolet-marine-19e-2.png/revision/latest?cb=20060421235452"
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,expendableyouth,4,Thu May 14 05:28:14 2015 UTC,Maybe we just dont want guns in some games :/
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,Jacob_wallace,3,Wed May 13 20:37:55 2015 UTC,"to be fair, they're very much magical enchanted golems."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,mPORTZER,3,Thu May 14 00:36:15 2015 UTC,"You've raised several things I'd like to address here.  First, what you call a crude pistol is not crude at all. The example you give is a flintlock pistol. While not as advanced as a modern Uzi, it is far more advanced than even the crossbows we see in TES. It has smaller, more complex and intricate moving parts. It also corrected design flaws to make it significantly more waterproof than any firearm previous. It was more likely to fire, and less likely to blow up in your hands if it did fire. Of course, both of these things still did occur more frequently than with our modern day guns. Accidental firings from a nearby heat source were also a problem with flintlocks. Furthermore, flintlocks could be used one handed. Matchlocks and their predecessors required two hands to operate. So no, I don't think it's possible a flintlock would fit the world. However, a hand cannon of the sort /u/mPORTZER mentioned, could fit the world.  Second, from what we see in game, the ""steampunk golems"" are larger and less intricate than the action of a flintlock. They're also powered by magical soul gems. Sure, you could have a magically powered firearm, but necessity is the mother of invention. In a world where a wizard can already cast exploding firebolts, or raze his surroundings with an area of effect spell, what makes the invention of a magical firearm necessary? Aren't battle mages the Tamrielic equivalent to grenadiers? It just seems to me that a firearm would be more expensive to produce and less reliable to produce than a trained battle mage, particularly in the early days of firearms. Furthermore, particularly in the early days of firearms, it would take about an equivalent amount of training and experimentation to become proficient as magic took. Yet, once magical ability is mastered, it's not only more reliable, but more accurate, and effective both over long distances and wide areas. Early guns, on the occasions they worked as intended, were not accurate, did not have a very good range, and also did not do any area of effect damage. Hell, the closest thing to an area of effect spell that we have in the modern world is either a machine gun or a claymore mine, and neither of those was around until relatively modern times.  Third, it seems much more likely to me that we'd see explosives applied to other endeavors in Tamriel, rather than fighting - again, because a trained battle mage is much less likely to misfire, shoot off because he laid down too close to the campfire, or just blow up completely - than a rudimentary firearm. But gunpowder and explosives could be useful in mining, in excavating the foundations for castles/defensive town walls, and in other jobs which a person with magical talent might not be attracted to. It may even be more efficient to use a large amount of gunpowder as a siege weapon than several battle mages, since you wouldn't have to feed the gunpowder (on the other hand, you would have to keep it dry and away from flame, so that might be a toss-up).  TL;DR - while rudimentary firearms could, in theory, be possible in Tamriel, given the nature of the world and its economics, I'd expect to see simple explosives used for other applications. In terms of self-defense, I don't think firearms would replace magic."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,FlamingSnot93,2,Fri May 15 00:31:36 2015 UTC,"In regards to the ""Why bother"" question. Why risk the few battle mages you have in front line combat? When you're mages can create devastating magical weapons and put them in the hands of peasants? You're applying logic to a scenario which is devoid of it."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,JackH4rt,1 point,Thu May 14 02:42:38 2015 UTC,"Not replace, but combat.  Everyone says there's magic, but they seem to forget not everyone can use magic. Those who can't use magic, or simply do not want to like the majority of Nords would have a good alternative to cause alot of ranged destruction without having to rely on magic.  We still have bows aswell, why not get rid of them neither if there's magic anyway? Or crossbows, those evolved from regular bows, but if the people of Tamriel would indeed think that magic is enough for ranged destruction, they would never have bothered creating a crossbow aswell.  And while bows and crossbows can have some succes in penetrating heavy armour, firearms are much better at it, so the strong armour piercing component would also be a highly attractive to combat enemies, especially orcs who wear their trademark heavy armour."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,FlamingSnot93,2,Thu May 14 04:23:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, in the early years, firearms were pretty weak against plate armor. Longbows were the best ranged weapon against plate armor in the Renaissance, and warhammers and maces the most effective close range weapons. Plate armor started going out of style not because of guns, but because it was expensive to produce (a factor which doesn't seem to apply to Tamriel, since so many people have access to plate armor). The introduction of the rifled flintlock musket put the final nail in plate armor's coffin, but as I already explained, the rifled flintlock is far more advanced than anything else we've seen in Tamriel. A longbow would still be a better ranged weapon for someone not magically inclined than an early hand cannon.  I really have to emphasize - the late middle-ages hand cannons and Renaissance era matchlocks were not reliable, not accurate, and rather weak weapons. In our world, it took hundreds of years to develop a firearm that was not only affordable, but effective against heavy armor. In Tamriel, technology appears not to be advancing, but stagnant or perhaps even in decline. For these reasons, I don't see the hand cannon catching on in popularity - although, as I admitted, it is theoretically possible and wouldn't necessarily be world-breaking."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,Matteo11,1 point,Thu May 14 06:44:26 2015 UTC,"It took hundreds of years for us to develop them, but we still worked on them even when they were seemingly useless.  No reason the elder scrolls world wouldn't have started using guns.  In fact, the fact that ancient guns were crappy makes it better since they wouldn't be game breaking."
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,MarvelousMagikarp,2,Thu May 14 06:06:01 2015 UTC,"I think I could see something less advanced popping up in small numbers depending on the time period. An inefficient ancient style hand cannon would be interesting and they could do the same thing they did with crossbows but a little more (higher damage, longer reload) and also you need to have adequate amounts of both bullets and the gun powder. maybe something like this http://s63.photobucket.com/user/BrentFinnigan/media/96eab6a4.jpg.html"
ElderScrolls,35v9k8,HoxtonFreeman,1 point,Thu May 14 11:35:08 2015 UTC,The technology is already more advanced in TES than in our real world so making a gun or making gunpowder would be pointless and counter productive when you already have the equivalent of all technology and even more advanced things.

I DO think large scale munitions like Cannons would be a useful advance. In fact, I can only think of a few realistic things that would be a bigger technological leap (such as trains.).   They would  have incredible value in siege or ship-to-ship warfare. I guess this doesn't help much when it comes to player weapons, but my mind goes there."

However, its ok to start out one way, and then Role Play that your experiences are changing your characters priorities-for example, start out all good and heroic and eventually get PSTD from all the death you see so you start to develop a more questionable morality.   Its a fun playthrough though!"

For whatever reason, I just haven't bothered investing a single level-up into magicka, it's all gone into health and stamina.

ElderScrolls,35qm4e,QuixoticTendencies,10,Wed May 13 04:36:21 2015 UTC,"Because the lore in ESO is varied enough that you can find something good in there no matter what you like, so saying it's all bad means that there just wasn't enough effort put into looking."

OP wanted to know what is canon, so I told him, before someone comes here shouting that it isn't and lie to the OP."

ElderScrolls,35qm4e,Pickleburp,0,Thu May 14 16:53:39 2015 UTC,"The meaning of ""canon"" gets muddy when you're dealing with franchises overseen by companies whose writing staff can change completely from one installment to the next. If your concept of canon is strictly a legal concept, and refers to the vision held by the current copyright holders and associated developers, then sure, ESO is canon. You have to recognize that that's not the only legitimate view though. In fact, go ask /r/teslore about C0DA. I'm not a big fan of Kirkbride anymore, but his views on ""canonicity"" within TES are something I can mostly endorse, and are something the people of /r/elderscrolls could probably do with looking at, judging by the responses to the OP.   will still be referenced in future games   It's possible they will be. Unlikely though, with the massive time gulf between ESO's events and the fourth era."
ElderScrolls,35qm4e,QuixoticTendencies,2,Thu May 14 20:43:23 2015 UTC,"This coming from the same person who was arguing before that George Lucas can't decide what canon is because there have been too many writers.  The writing and canon of TESO are fine. You can argue you don't like it, you can even reject it personally, but it's still an Elder Scrolls game. It was still published by Bethesda, even if the writers have changed. If the writers going forward are going to use it as part of the ""official word,"" it doesn't matter what you thought of it. TES have been going for two decades, so yeah, writing will change.  I get the fact that people played the Beta and hated it. I was there. I put in the hours, 24 at one time one weekend. There were a lot of bugs and the game wasn't that fun to me.  I also went back for the Tamriel Unlimited invite to see what had changed, and it is now and Elder Scrolls game with MMO aspects instead of an ES themepark MMO. Conversation options, fully voiced characters, and the first person combat has greatly improved. Sure it's not Morrowind, Oblivion, or Skyrim with multiplayer. The writing is still there, the lore is still there. To me, it's now worth the ticket price again."

ElderScrolls,35qm4e,dallonweekes,-2,Wed May 13 00:13:38 2015 UTC,"I drew an analogy that I thought was apt. George Lucas pretends that after so many decades, that he still gets to dictate what happens in the Star Wars universe, even though there has been released scores of novels and other materials which portray a universe that dwarfs his own vision of it, and which the fanbase has embraced. Most, not all, but most fans of the lore of TES largely reject ESO because of how egregious it is. Zenimax and its supporters may vehemently disagree, but if you'll pardon my frankness, they can go fuck themselves."

Cyrodiil, at the time ESO is set, was a jungle, not the Europesque landscape we are introduced to in Oblivion. The explanation for why it's the way it is in Oblivion, in Oblivion, is that Tiber Septim made it so after he ascended/achieved CHIM, for love of his Red Legions. I may have out of date information, but the last I checked, Zenimax's chalks all that up to a ""transcription error"", and says no more. That, at least to me, is profoundly unsatisfactory."

ElderScrolls,35qm4e,thecuraga,1 point,Tue May 12 18:36:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, probably right. I'm pretty sure ESO isn't cannon (just to piss of people) because it would make no sense to have 10,000,000 adventures all being the chosen of some prophesy or whatever."
ElderScrolls,35qm4e,thecuraga,9,Tue May 12 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"Anything released by Bethesda/Zenimax that has the name ""Elder Scrolls"" is considered canon.

A simple group of thieves isn't going to murder you, they might just beat you down and steal your shit.  I wish you could leave people alive and that sometimes you could be left alive or captured rather than always going from peace to full out murder."
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,SulfuricDonut,4,Tue May 12 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"Add factions to the game. If you lose a fight, the game spawns you in the bed you last slept in, half your gold, and the most expensive item in your inventory missing.

ElderScrolls,35nzkb,SulfuricDonut,1 point,Tue May 12 18:55:49 2015 UTC,"I would say that certain creatures would be factionless. IE: if you die to a mudcrab then you're dead, game over as usual. I also had the thought that if you die to a faction you lose all your currently equipped weapons and armor with the same stipulations of waking up in the last bed you slept in. It wouldn't be as bad as what you suggest, but it would hurt just the same. Then you'd have to go and fight whoever stole your shit to get it back. Would add a layer of complexity to death without the ... permanence."
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,prowlinghazard,2,Tue May 12 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with most games now is that death has exactly no permanence, since you just instantly reload back to a few minutes ago. Being left alive ends up being both more immersive for role-playing and more permanent (but still retaining the option to reload).  And yeah obviously animals would be mostly independant, and straight up kill you since they are probably trying to eat you in the first place.  And if you die to a mudcrab your game-save should delete itself because you should never die to a mudcrab :P"

Non-combat factions (like the Bards College), more immersion (being effected by weather/health, mods usually fix this but still), radiant quests to go beyond going into random dungeons, more home/character customization, more dynamic dialogue when your character progresses through the game (there's some of this but some NPCs say the same thing to you even when you're the Arch-Mage or whatever)."
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,cadetart3mis,17,Tue May 12 04:07:58 2015 UTC,"So basically, more like an RPG rather than a Double Dragon beat em up?"
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,Rezcom,21,Tue May 12 06:11:59 2015 UTC,"A more extensive combat system for mage characters in general.  Seriously those conjuration spells don't seem to scale at all unless you summon weapons (better off just using real weapons), it's so limited to what you can do.  Alteration is useless, and the destruction spells are some of the most boring I've ever seen.  They need to balance different play styles, or at least have quests that would have varying experiences depending on play style. Right now, it seems the ideal play style is a big dude with a ton of armor just hacking and slashing endlessly and knows Restoration spells to run away with.  And every quest in Skyrim encourages this, even shit like the Dark Brotherhood quests are still ideally completed with this tanky dual wielded/sword and shield play with a couple shouts and restoration spells here and there.  Being a thief (except for occasional cheap and boring archery) isn't ideal either and just slows everything down."
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,Rezcom,9,Tue May 12 06:09:59 2015 UTC,They should just go back to the varietey Morrowind had in spells. Magic has just been steadily been dumbed down from morrowind to oblivion and then to skyrim.
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,karnivoorischenkiwi,7,Tue May 12 08:55:27 2015 UTC,"As far as I can see, everything has been steadily dumbed down since Morrowind.   If the trend persists then by the time we get to TESVII we'll have a UI with one button marked ""Play Movie"". On the other hand, there will be lots of ways to customize your character and the graphics will be so realistic that orcs will occasionally lean out of the computer screen and punch the player in the nose."
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,docclox,2,Wed May 13 12:07:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Steadily, they've simplified the game with each iteration. I feel like Oblivion was the worst offender in this department.  My dream TES game would be a world that is hand-crafted and alien like Morrowinds, with dungeons like Skyrim, and the complexity of Morrowind, with Oblivion quests. Add in the ability to have non-voiced dialogue trees like Morrowind, and then make the different guilds and factions much deeper. Bring back consequences in character development so that one character can't finish everything.  Also, someday, the radiant AI that was showcased in that 2005 Oblivion E3 video would be nice."
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,Rotationation,2,Fri May 15 03:38:45 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd like to see a more extensive combat system period. As much as I love elder scrolls other games have been calling me away lately because of how other games just do combat way better.
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,Questhunter3,12,Tue May 12 11:38:43 2015 UTC,Make the feeling of character progression like older TES games. I don't need to feel special or a be hero from the start. I want to earn it.
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,Bergs_,1 point,Tue May 12 14:04:52 2015 UTC,"Morrowind feels like it does this best. In Oblivion you become the hero of Kvatch already after closing the first gate, which is pretty easy and is one of the first quests in the main story."

ElderScrolls,35nzkb,Fobby12308,9,Tue May 12 08:23:12 2015 UTC,"I think that future Bethesda games would gain a lot from more cinematic storytelling devices. For example:  1) More voice actors. Way, way more voice actors. Also, the performances should be subtle and less theatrical.  2) Mocap performances, especially in terms of facial capture.  3) The ability to always look around while being spoken to. No more forcing the camera perspective to center on the speaker. It's immersion-breaking, and feels a little bit condescending.  4) NPCs should sometimes look toward you, and sometimes look around at their surroundings. No more dead-center, dead-eyed interactions.   Bonus: Fewer loading screens. This could be achieved by integrating a more seamless (i.e. streaming) loading system for certain indoor/in-wall environments.    edit: formatting"

Surely if you join the Dark Brotherhood, then the Thieve's Guild might be a little suspicious and not let you in? Or that the Companions would tell you to bugger off? Or that some combination means that the Mage College or Stormcloaks wouldn't want you?  The fact that every option is open to you and you can simultaneously be everything at once kills some engagement in the storyline - I don't sweat decisions on whether I join A or B, I just join both."

I like games like Assassins Creed Brotherhood, where you start at nothing and build this huge organization.   It would be neat if once you are finished with the Dark Brotherhood/Thieves Guild/Etc... quest, instead of neat armor and a new place to crash, you actually had the advantages of leading a guild. The thieves guild would provide you a steady income and a rare item every now and then. Your thieves are working, aren't they?  As the leader of the Dark Brotherhood, shouldn't you be reviewing and processing contracts?   As the Archmage of the college, shouldn't you be more privy to the forefront of magic? Approving research that could benefit you, or accidentally put people in harms way.   Once you are in the late stages of the game, you probably have hundreds of thousands of gold, a collection of estates, a family, a museum of treasures; I would like to be able to settle in to a position of leadership and send others off to do my bidding. A way to lead the day to day activities of the guilds or to invest your gold in a continuous way would be terrific."

Taxes, say property taxes if you live in a certain hold (Gotta keep those cave torches lit after all), economic woes/booms depending on external factors (war, spending, human influences), value of goods based on supply (if I'm selling 1,000 iron daggers to one merchant the value should decrease), inflation if you spawn in millions of Septims, etc."
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,thourhinelander,5,Tue May 12 11:55:21 2015 UTC,I might be alone but I don't like how the game scales to your level.  I want baddies with Daedric armor at level 5 that I'm too weak to fight.   Although magic should scale. I want my fire blast spell to increase in damage as I level up my destruction.  It's annoying buying new spells when my previous one is too weak because then I have a list of unusable spells.
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,JHeim286,3,Tue May 12 14:59:00 2015 UTC,Don't want to be an ass but   I might be alone   You're not. You're really not. Look up any TES thread that discusses level scaling ever since Oblivion came out.  I personally could do without level scaling but can kind of see why Skyrim does it and it's just as easy to screw up the balance of an unleveled world as it is to screw up level scaling (like Oblivion did).
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,notponies,3,Wed May 13 01:59:30 2015 UTC,"In no particular order…   Expand factions and make them more rewarding but more restrictive, similar to Morrowind. In fact, bring back favored skills and rank requirements. People can still master all, but I’d like to see more immersion and rewards for rolling specific character archetypes. The inclusion of more playstyle-neutral factions would help justify this a bit more. Less developer reliance on quest markers. Notably a return of descriptive quest text. More tactical gameplay and world building “theming.” For example, having to bring resist/cure poison items into a falmer cave or face serious risk of dying. Or how you knew to bring restore strength potions into ancestral tombs in Morrowind. This can scale with difficulty, with easy being whatever, and legendary forcing you to prep up before the dungeon or face a much, much more difficult battle. This also coincides with more descriptive quests. If possible, having smarter and more tactical enemies would be a lot of fun too, e.g. melee bandits blocking you from reaching the archers or healers. It’d also be nice if alchemy followed more themes, i.e. pick mushrooms for stat recover, so I didn’t feel the pressure to obsessively collect everything in sight and end up with 100 lbs of alchemy mats I’ll never use but “might need one time.” More disparity between normal and power attacks. It gets super tedious having to button mash through giant piles of health when you’re at no risk of dying. Give crafting a smaller role, possibly remove them as traditional skills and give them a role more similar to werewolf/vampire perks. More non-combat gameplay. Just more world building and less “themeparking” overall. Skyrim was fun but it felt less memorable and poignant than any of its predecessors. The lore is one of TES’s biggest strengths, it’s wrong not to lean into it. More Daedric spheres to visit!"

Let you choose a direction for the guild and actually affect it after you become guild master.   Guild quests that make use of guild skills. You have to be sneaky as an assassin, you have to maybe craft a special potion by finding ingredients in the mages guild, or manage to charm some diplomat before a meeting, summon an army to scare off some band of vagrants, actually require you to have the skills the guild is for.   Loot system that isn't garbage. So, more unique items found in dungeons. Weapon have unique aspects, borderlands style. Not just ""oh look, another daedric sword"".

ElderScrolls,35nzkb,Kyvr,4,Tue May 12 17:01:40 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls makes Skyrim seem inept.   Apples and oranges. Skyrim and Elder Scrolls games in general (not counting TESO) were meant to be played in first-person. This doesn't translate well to a 3rd person view ala Dark Souls. Not to mention Dark Souls is an arcade platformer, meaning you have combos, etc. That's just not part of (nor has ever been) the Elder Scrolls mindset. I'm not saying one is better than the other, just different. And if you prefer Dark Souls, go play Dark Souls and Bloodbourne.   a stealth-based character will have a much easier time than a combat or magic-focused one.   I've got thousands of hours in between ES3, ES4, and ES5. I tend to gravitate towards stealthy characters because I think they're fun, but I wouldn't say they're necessarily easier. It's all in how you build them and what you do.   Light armor has much fewer drawbacks than heavy armor and shares the same armor cap.   Maybe eventually and it depends on your skill level, but they're still different. If you head west of Solitude and pick up the Steed stone, which negates the weight of the armor you're using when it comes to encumbrance, heavy armor wins for pure melee. Again, just depends on how you're building characters, and let's not forget that we're talking about an RPG. Having multiple classes of armor is helpful for some people in building the character they want. Remember Medium armor from previous ES games?  As for the rest, to an extent you have a point, but it also sounds like you haven't played a lot of previous Elder Scrolls games."
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,Pickleburp,6,Sat May 23 10:23:23 2015 UTC,On that note - medium armor was a legit thing and needs to be brought back as well.
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,EKSelenc,3,Tue May 12 15:07:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The ""Medium"" (mixed heavy and light) offered by Beirand when you join the Imperial Army in Solitude got me excited at first until I realized what it was. I've tried playing with mix-and-match, and what you end up with is a nice role-play idea that struggles to melee or sneak well. You can't use the bonuses offered by the skill trees (% for using all heavy/light), so yeah...real medium armor would be nice.  Edit: formatting"
ElderScrolls,35nzkb,Pickleburp,3,Thu May 14 14:13:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, and don't forget medium class armor actually did work back in TES III. It might seem as a hard to believe fact now, but many people (including myself) stuck to using medium armor since it was universal and had a separate skill as well. Some of the plugins brought back 'medium' class armor in TES V but only in terms of item name AFAIK."

ElderScrolls,35nzkb,Archey6,1 point,Tue May 12 21:43:27 2015 UTC,"I disagree with just about everything you said, except for the rebalancing. There are a lot of ways to improve on Skyrim without starting over, but that might be where to start.   The combat is mostly fine with the exception that the AI is inept. I'd like to see some intelligent AI design where they wreck you through using different abilities, not just out leveling you, walking up, and smashing your face. I liked how ghosts/etherial entities in Oblivion required either a silver or a magic weapon to kill. If you want to play a game with dark souls combat, play dark souls. If you found the combat disengaging it was more to do with that all the enemies were retarded, not because the combat system itself was bad.   I never really found stealth to be more powerful than the other styles of gameplay, but giving the player more freedom here probably isn't a bad thing from a game design perspective. Sure, some balance is needed so you don't become a godlike jack-of-all trades, but making one more powerful than the rest is invariably something that happens as a result of this philosophy. I'd rather have everything a little too powerful than not powerful enough.   Guild quests aren't really supposed to impact the plot. They're just side quests that tell their own story most of the time. However, Skyrim's story was so shallow it seems like they should have done more with them. What we really need here is a main quest that is actually good. More immersion, longer, dialogue that isn't drown out by music and random people talking to you. Someone who learned how to write, voice actors who didn't phone it in, Etc. There are a lot of small ways to improve the game that were overlooked when they made Skyrim. It starts with writing and story creation. It ends with people giving a shit about what they're doing.   That said, a direction I would like to see them go with guild quests is to add some new guilds. Maybe like an inspector's guild or something. Kinda like the FBI, who go around and try to out the Thieve's guild or Dark Brotherhood and arrest/kill their members. Or the thieve's guild/DB could get a spy inside their ranks as well, and disrupt them somehow. Would give you more of a reason to do one, or the other, or both, depending on how you want it to work out, and could give the player some choices as to how their plot lines work out.   The Fighter's guild and Mage's guild should probably remain untouched. They are there to serve just as additional content and something for new characters to start out doing to make a quick buck and level early on. You can't really do much with them, they are just adventurers for hire. Add a cutsie little plot, sure, but don't expect to see the Fighter's guild go after the Dark Brotherhood.   I found companions were pretty much just useless fodder and only worth keeping around if you wanted someone to look at who wasn't actively trying to kill you. Some improvement to them, IE giving them their own skills and leveling them up using some sort of point-based system or classes and abilities for them to use in combat would be a step in the right direction. You don't need to make them OP, just give them some character. Yeah, I'd like to see my companion occasionally throw a fireball and catch me in it.    you should be able to proceed with the Thieves' Guild quest without selling your soul to Nocturnal, and that your Orc barbarian probably isn't qualified to lead the College of Winterhold   I don't really know where you're going with this, but I don't feel like players should be restricted to certain fates based on how they roll their character. Combat role, fine.  If someone wants to have a barbarian be in charge of the Mage's Guild, so be it. He should probably have to know some magic, and I feel like making someone cast a spell to enter is a fair as a minimum requirement.  If you don't think that's right, the game isn't forcing you to do that. The idea is to give the player more freedom, not less. If you want to RP your game a certain way you're free to do so, but we shouldn't force everyone to follow your RP rules.   Also, the guy in the thread who said that he role played a magic-phobic character and was forced to take a spell to complete the main quest is a huge loss in my books. Sure, he probably shouldn't be allowed to run the college if he can't cast a spell, but he shouldn't be forced to take one to complete the game if he doesn't want to have anything to do with magic.   More Freedom and choice is great here. Making the game more linear and making the player follow more rules goes against what people love about TES games."

You can kill the Dark Brotherhood, for example. No one says that you HAVE to obey the orders you get when they kidnap you; you just turn on Astrid and kill her. They probably planned the same thing for the Thieves Guild, but maybe just decided to leave it out because there wasn't enough time.  I'm just guessing here, through.

Fallout New Vegas, however, can be completed without killing a thing."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,Faerillis,1 point,Sun May 10 21:02:38 2015 UTC,I guess you could use followers for the super mutants or failing that just go ahead without killing any humans.

ElderScrolls,35gkv8,Faerillis,-5,Sun May 10 13:38:28 2015 UTC,Who likes post-apocalyptic? Fallout games are boring.
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,Haplo12345,1 point,Mon May 11 01:21:35 2015 UTC,"Fallout games are great, but I would love to see more realistic 'purist' post-apoc games, especially with survivalist elements (like Unreal World or the Frostfall mod). Whilst the wackiness of Fallout makes it unique and v. fun, I often find myself actually longing for something similar but more generic."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,Faerillis,3,Sun May 17 12:44:35 2015 UTC,"If you want an RPG that allows to solve almost all problems/quests by ways other than killing, then you definitely should check Arcanum. It has its own issues and weak aspects, but when it comes to resolving problems in many different ways Arcanum is unmatched.  Original Deus Ex is also extremely good in this regard. Though it is not a pure RPG, it allows for more variety in playstyles and impactful choices than most modern RPGs."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,MyrMindservant,1 point,Sun May 10 17:42:12 2015 UTC,"Think about the production cost of that. Not just money but time, manpower, burnout, etc...  Maybe one day the tech will be good enough to do that without making the game far too onerous for the devs to make but that is not a time coming soon."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,Faerillis,1 point,Sun May 10 11:10:13 2015 UTC,"Look at Skyrim from the perspective of computer games in the early 90s. Those teams would say the same thing about a game like Skyrim; ""think of the production costs...""  Game studios put tens of millions of dollars into these games, sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars. I don't think it's too much to ask for a non-combat path in a game that's supposed to be one of the defining RPGs of the genre."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,MyrMindservant,-2,Mon May 11 01:20:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you've pointed out the flaw in your own argument! With current tech what you're asking for is a 1992 Game Company to produce Skyrim today!  Non-Combat options mean: more scripting, more voice-acting, more writing, semi-customized/dynamic responses (so more voice-responses again), reward re-balancing for non-aggressive tactics to maintain a semblance of balance, more work balancing out various approaches, improved AI, not to mention drawing resources away from the rest of the development team all for an option only a small portion of their market will get reasonable utility out of.  AKA one day, the cost will be worth it for a company to do that and I look forward to that day but it is not currently feasible."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,Haplo12345,2,Mon May 11 02:47:39 2015 UTC,"No, I was just using that as a comparison to your first paragraph. Yes, it requires more work, but is it unreasonable? No, not from a quality point-of-view. This of course is the company that decided paid mods was a good idea, however."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,Faerillis,-2,Mon May 11 03:58:46 2015 UTC,"Steam thought Paid Mods was a good idea, Skyrim had the biggest audience and then things happened.  And no, I'm telling you now — and I've already laid out the massive amount of reasons why — that yes, given current technical limitations your request is unreasonable for a game series like this. Your argument is, in essence, ""The customer is always right"" when anyone who lives in the real-world will tell you otherwise."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,Haplo12345,5,Mon May 11 04:25:59 2015 UTC,"You are naming tech limitations as the reason and this is exactly why your argument is wrong. There are multiple long and expansive RPGs made more than 10 years ago that have non-combat options for most or sometimes even all their quests. Those RPGs were made with way more tech limitations than any modern game and they still managed to do it well.  This is not a question of tech limitations but rather of priorities and target audience. Bethesda spent huge amount of money on advertising for Skyrim before it came out. If they would spend those money on development of the game itself, then we surely would get a better product. But they chose potential profits over quality of the game, hence advertising had higher priority. Who they were making the game for is even more important. They tried to encompass the largest audience possible. Skyrim was aimed (this can be seen from their advertising campaign) at casual gamers, non-gamers and people who never liked or cared about RPGs as a genre. They knew that most of their target audience wouldn't appreciate sophisticated RPG mechanics and non-combat solutions, so they didn't bother with these things."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,flytrap666,-1,Mon May 11 12:54:59 2015 UTC,"Those tech limitations weren't in place 10 years ago. AI was based almost entirely on Dice-Roll mechanics, dungeons and NPCs were so simple that they could be procedurally generated. There was no voice acting or it was limited to cutscenes and grunts and not expected of regular interaction so that cost didn't exist. Also their audience was far more limited and more likely be forgiving of bugs."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,SomeHairyGuy,1 point,Mon May 11 13:32:16 2015 UTC,"Things you have mentioned are either not tech limitations or limitations developers had to deal with for ages.  1) Voice acting is an additional feature. Yes, I know that it is an industry standard at this point, but it is still not a limitation. If developers want, they can always work around the issues introduced with voice acting, as an example see Fallout New Vegas. 2) AI was based on the same principles, nothing has changed. If you think that AI in older games was fundamentally different, then you are not familiar enough with subject. Also, NPCs and their AI were just as detailed as now. Arcanum was released in 2001 and has better NPC AI than Skyrim. 3) Dungeons were actually more complex than now. I don't even need to go far to find an example. Morrowind had way more detailed and diverse dungeons, both in structure and appearance. Yes, most of them were smaller, but I would choose quality over size any day.  Look, I understand what you are trying to say, but these issues are nothing new. Modern games are simplified not because of tech limitations, but rather due to different development budget distribution (more is spent on graphics and advertising, less on the gameplay, script, and other inner aspects), different priorities, and to cater to a different audience. It also happens because most game development companies are now owned/supervised by corporate entities and aren't free to create things as they wish."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,flytrap666,1 point,Tue May 12 17:24:42 2015 UTC,"No, my argument is I am an individual and I can want whatever I want to want. If I want an RPG that can actually be defined as an RPG, you're in no position to say otherwise."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,imason96,1 point,Tue May 12 03:50:12 2015 UTC,"Apologies, I'd not meant to say you can't want this and I don't think it's a bad thing to aspire to. It would make for a hell of a game! I just don't think with current technology that it's feasible given the cost of production or a reasonable expectation. Wanting something to that effect is good, making it an expectation is setting yourself up for disappointment."

ElderScrolls,35gkv8,Apex2113,2,Sun May 10 21:29:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, since starting DnD several months back Skyrim just feels like the emptiest, blandest RPG in existence, to the point where it seems more like an interactive movie. Still a beautiful game and v. fun, but it's asking too much for a video game to try and emulate the 'unlimited possibility' element in our imagination. EDIT: ever try Necromunda?"

ElderScrolls,35gkv8,DivinePrince2,2,Sun May 17 13:30:56 2015 UTC,"I know this might not be the most related response, but here it is. Fallout New Vegas, while its setting and atmosphere was in many ways inferior to vanilla FO3, had MANY more choices and opportunities in comparison (both story-wise and combat-wise) and was more of a role-playing game in a good way. You could literally piss off or become the savior of ANY faction in New Vegas; while the game was rushed out, as most Obsidian games are, they redeem themselves with a deeper storyline, likeable companions, and more importantly, PLAYER CHOICE. It wasn't good vs. evil anymore, you chose from factions that were essentially Lawful Incompetent Good, Lawful Competent Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, or Lawful Evil. I actually heard a rumor that Bethesda changed several aspects of Skyrim to reflect on what people liked about New Vegas; such as the fleshed out personality of Serana and the very nature of Skyrim's Civil War. If it's true, the rumor will probably mean that Bethesda's learned from their fanbase and will try to improve player impact- this is fantastic news."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,Apex2113,1 point,Tue May 12 01:29:23 2015 UTC,"I thought New Vegas had a better setting because it made more sense to me. The war happened 200 years ago. People have been hitting those stores for at least 150 years, why are they still unlocked and loaded with guns, ammo, etc.... The cities were really the killer for me. For every good city like Rivet City, or Areafu, you also have nonsensical ones like Little lamp light, Megaton, or The Republic of Dave. When I visit a place in a game it needs to seem like a place that could exist in that world. I didn't feel that through most of FO 3. It is still a great game that I logged 80 hours or more into but I thought the setting of FO:NV was better realized."
ElderScrolls,35gkv8,FusRoeDah,5,Wed May 13 04:46:01 2015 UTC,"No I totally agree with you.  I've said before that one of the things I hate most about Skyrim is that in many cases it shoehorns you into being the bad guy.  Most of the deadric quests require you to kill innocent people and there is never any way around it.  Their aren't any ""good"" factions to oppose the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild for you to join.  You should play Morrowind.  That game is perfect for roleplaying."

ElderScrolls,35fwnj,vhisic,8,Sun May 10 00:29:22 2015 UTC,"ESO is an MMO based on the game series The Elder Scrolls, which is a fantasy based RPG. You might know the most recent of the series as Skyrim.   The series consists of 5 ""main"" games starting with The Elder Scrolls: Arena followed in order by Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion and then Skyrim with a few side games and expansions packs. As a whole the series is considered one of the best RPG games available for both story and game play. If you want to know a bit more about the story i would recommend giving skyrim a play through you dont need to have played the previous titles to get into the story, and on the same note you dont need to have played the stand alones to get into the MMO.    The world is pretty large, in general each of the single player games takes place in a single region of the world (known as Tamriel). Map size  wise the 2nd game in the series Daggerfall is considered one of the largest game maps ever created, the later maps are not as big but are all of considerable size (compare them the rest to daggerfall) . Story wise each game is different, but typical save the world from doom sort of stuff and they are sandbox free roam so you can do as you please, and the modding community is VERY active for these games so its almost limitless what you can do."
ElderScrolls,35fwnj,n60storm4,3,Sun May 10 00:48:23 2015 UTC,"The Elder Scrolls is an RPG series with five titles and a few spin off series's including Elder Scrolls Adventures, Elder Scrolls Travels, and Elder Scrolls Online. The main series is an open world adventure RPG, Elder Scrolls Adventures follow more of a set story line and are a bit more cinematic, Elder Scrolls Travels is for cell phones, and Elder Scrolls Online is an open world MMO. They are all set in the same universe (called the Auribus) although not all are set in the same time period (ESO is in 2nd era, while Skyrim is in 4th era).  Oblivion, Skyrim, and Elder Scrolls Online should all be easy to pick up as they are modern while the other one's are a quite old and can take some getting useful. Shoddy Cast has a lore series that goes over the basics."

ElderScrolls,35chd0,thinkpadius,7,Sat May 9 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"It's an Elder Scrolls MMO set a  thousand years in the past during a 3 way war for control over the entire continent of Tamriel.  Graphically I would put it a little past the quality of The Secret World so it looks okay.  It suffers from your typical MMO graphical problems like agoraphobic buildings, huge hubs and town centers etc., and grainy textures. The combat is solid. I would say it's better than solid, it's very good. This is in part because they didn't skimp on particle effects and animations so even at a low level, the action looks excellent. They've also got the 1st person view going for them too. story wise - I haven't played the story so I have no idea if it's good or bad. there are plenty of interesting features about the technology of this MMO, compared to others, that are worth looking into. The website for the game is the best advertisement for these features - which are mostly about how areas change based on what quests you complete etc. a lot of the things you can do from the elder scrolls games are in this game. A lot of the freedom is also gone - you can't really be nonviolent and win, you can't mod, and many things are level locked apparently (though you should verify with someone who plays currently because I don't play anymore). overall if you like MMOs and you like the Elder Scrolls, give it a go. But if you don't like MMOs, then the fact that this is an Elder Scrolls game probably won't be strong enough to win you over."

ElderScrolls,35bkxe,Ethridel,9,Fri May 8 19:15:24 2015 UTC,I wonder if this is why most players gravitate to Sneaky Archer. It's the best of both worlds. Godly defence in that nobody sees you and godly offence in that you're hitting an easy 3x damage multiplier.
ElderScrolls,35bkxe,tobascodagama,6,Fri May 8 20:03:24 2015 UTC,"In ES games, there's no defense quite like 100+ health potions in the 'ole inventory."

ElderScrolls,35bkxe,Sdesser,2,Sun May 10 10:47:07 2015 UTC,"The simple, linear percent damage reduction in Oblivion/Skyrim make armor fairly useless in the early game except for gaining skill. Like in Oblivion, the first 15 armor rating you get only reduces damage by 15%, but the last 15 (from 70 to 85) reduces the remaining damage by 50%, and anything beyond that does nothing.  I liked how New Vegas did it, having armor give a constant reduction instead of a percent reduction. So your early-game 10 DT armor will stop an early-game 10 damage bullet almost completely (capped to 80%), but be almost useless against stronger weapons, rather than being equally useless against all weapons like in TES and FO3."
ElderScrolls,35bkxe,dtfinch,1 point,Fri May 8 21:14:14 2015 UTC,"(To point out, all my gear is the best you can get with maxed out crafting skills without abusing any exploits etc. Also running a mod that makes the toughest creatures scale all the way to your level, as I'm currently level 100+)   Skyrim had the damage output of the PC just fine for one handed at least. Daggers are a bit too powerful when used in tandem with Sneak though. Bow damage is way too low in comparison. When playing on Legendary difficulty, I can one-shot legendary dragons from sneak with daggers with no perks invested in the One Handed tree. With a bow with maximum investment, I do around ~15-20%.   When it comes to PC defenses, I think they're quite perfect at Legendary. I'm running in Light armor and I can be one shotted by a high end Draugr's bow shot. Sword & Board playstyle is also quite nicely balanced. Fighting the toughest monsters is still a challenge in the sense that I actually have to watch out what I'm doing and try not to take a blow to the face without blocking.  Magic is a joke, sadly. It has no place in high level play, unless you use a mod to balance it out. :( Also, sneak surely needs a better balance in the next title. It's way too easy to become this impossible-to-be-seen being that hur-durs his way to victory with daggers. With sneak being broken, sneak archery is still somewhat balanced, as enemies will react to your shots even when shooting from perfect hiding. Though, enemies should look for you longer and further than they do in the vanilla game, perhaps go looking from the direction where the arrow came from instead of going to look where it landed, walk towards the origin for 2 seconds and then just go ""Perhaps I was just hearing things."" with his friend dead on the floor and an arrow in his head. With enough distance between you and the monsters, it's still way too easy to stay hidden.  Don't even get me started on using Invisibility spells, they simply break the game when used with Quiet Casting and sneak builds. Invisibility in your off-hand and a dagger in your main-hand is probably the most safe way of killing anything."

ElderScrolls,358868,NewerEngland,1 point,Fri May 8 16:10:50 2015 UTC,Yeah no there would be no altering those DOS titles.
ElderScrolls,358868,ZaephBee,3,Fri May 8 17:18:15 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they confirmed that there will not be a remake for Skyrim, so I wouldn't get my hopes up for any of the older games either."
ElderScrolls,358868,KiboshWasabi,2,Fri May 8 05:35:49 2015 UTC,That would be awesome! I'd like it if the updated UI of Skyrim was used in the older titles. Don't get me wrong I loved Morrowind and Oblivion but I just don't have time anymore to play without fast travel and quest markers (for Morrowind).  That being said I'd rather a new entry to the series but at the end of the day I love ES and would totally pay to play then again on updates hardware.
ElderScrolls,358868,zen_mutiny,4,Fri May 8 08:04:18 2015 UTC,"Theres a reason the Anthology went to PC and not console. Primarily I'd say its a marketing reason, as I doubt many console players would fork over the dough for it."
ElderScrolls,358868,KiboshWasabi,4,Fri May 8 06:36:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I'm primarily a console player and I just bought Anthology for PC for $20. Conversely, I was looking at the Morrowind GOTY edition for consoles for $30. I would totally drop more than either of those for an Anthology for consoles."
ElderScrolls,358868,NotVeryBatman,-3,Fri May 8 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"You would, but thats hardly any perspective into the majority. The Majority has already spoken. The diehards play on PC. A lot of the diehards began gaming on PC specifically so they could play on PC and take advantage of the PC community surrounding it."

ElderScrolls,358868,SplashBro11,0,Mon May 11 20:36:04 2015 UTC,I was thinking of the 3 main titles after the DOS releases.  Counting those 3 only it is a trilogy.
ElderScrolls,358868,darthmarticus,1 point,Mon May 11 21:27:04 2015 UTC,Well that's not implied so that is why I was telling you...
ElderScrolls,358868,VarsityPhysicist,1 point,Tue May 12 01:09:33 2015 UTC,I would love it but I would rather get elder scrolls 6 on next gen. Maybe one day
ElderScrolls,358868,awardments,1 point,Fri May 8 04:48:25 2015 UTC,I've only ever played TES on 360. I've looked into whether Bethesda would do something like a remake for the new consoles but sadly haven't found anything. I would be all for them remastering the games once they release TESVI
ElderScrolls,3534et,outerspacegrass,26,Wed May 6 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would like a faction system based on the one we see in Daggerfall with a multiple guilds and knightly orders that could not all be joined in the same playthrough and more radiant-like quest lines for minor factions."
ElderScrolls,3534et,KommandCBZhi,10,Wed May 6 19:12:00 2015 UTC,So much this. In Oblivion and Skyrim you're this guy who simply does literally everything that there is to do. The titles you'd deserve from this would make Daenerys Stormborn look like a minor countess.
ElderScrolls,3534et,23PowerZ,6,Wed May 6 19:56:48 2015 UTC,"the thing is, nobody is forcing you to join every guild. That's part of what makes TES awesome: If you want to run around and beat every quest and get all the loot and kill everyone, YOU CAN! If you want to actually do things in a logical manner, YOU CAN! The only instance of someone telling you you have to join any of the guilds IIRC was your handler in the blades near the beginning of Morrowind, and that might have simply been a suggestion."
ElderScrolls,3534et,comkiller,3,Wed May 6 21:37:48 2015 UTC,"Dude that's as logical as saying that you could get a title on unrelated fields. Can you? Absolutely. Will it make YOU a more developed person in the specific area that you like? No it won't. Don't mistake me, my first character is always a jack of all trades, master of none. But those characters tend to get stale after level 60 because there's no point in maxing skills, if not for basic perks.  If a guild has a minimum requirement or a requirement quest (like... if you are not too advanced in one faction, you can defect to the enemy by betraying the former. It would affect negatively HUGELY the first faction's opinion of you). By level 40 you've usually ran through most of the game already."
ElderScrolls,3534et,EinherjarofOdin,2,Thu May 7 08:39:26 2015 UTC,"I like the mod that makes it impossible to join the thieves guild until you've pickpocketed X amount of valuables. Then suddenly the joining option opens up. It fixes pickpocket in for me, and the thieves guild issue I had. I agree with everyone about the connection between magic knowledge and the mage guild. There should have been a greater connection there. I definitely think there should be an economic faction of some kind - basically something that turns the alchemy, speech craft, and blacksmithing skills, and turns them into something you could combine for a guild.  Someone suggested pirates - I was thinking helping the East Empire Company set up new trade routes. shops for sale - I'd also love it if you could buy and invest in shops just like you could buy homes. So just like Breezehome, there might be another  locked building that could be unlocked but this time it could be as a store - you pick the type of store, you furnish it, you hire someone to work the storefront, and maybe what you do is rather than sell your junk, you put it in a chest and your guy sells it for you and you come back later for the cash."
ElderScrolls,3534et,thinkpadius,5,Thu May 7 19:18:06 2015 UTC,I'm just saying there should never be any hard shoehorning forcing the player to play a certain way. There should always be the option to do whatever the hell you want even if it makes no sense.
ElderScrolls,3534et,comkiller,3,Thu May 7 13:43:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not pro-shoehorning, but I do find things like the conflict in Morrowind between the Fighters Guild and the Thieves Guild to be interesting and compelling. I would be all for faction storylines in future TES games that are mutually exclusive by nature of conflict, not by nature of shoehorning. That's the sort of thing that can really increase the immersive and dynamic feeling of a game world."
ElderScrolls,3534et,jmelesky,1 point,Thu May 7 20:33:31 2015 UTC,"but I do find things like the conflict in Morrowind between the Fighters Guild and the Thieves Guild to be interesting and compelling.    Yeah I agree completely. I simply don't believe in content restrictions 'just coz', but morrowind really did set such a good standard. The mechanics served the story, and that's always superior in a rp game."
ElderScrolls,3534et,OriginalPosta,1 point,Fri May 8 09:13:58 2015 UTC,"I agree too--that sort of thing, as well as the conflicts between the Great Houses, was what made Morrowind my favorite ES game."
ElderScrolls,3534et,LitAndButterflies,1 point,Sat May 23 18:17:47 2015 UTC,"In Oblivion and Skyrim you're this guy who simply does literally everything that there is to do.   Not me. I made a character and only did the quests and joined the guilds that interested me.  If its important to you, it seems a bit silly to go and join factions you think you shouldnt be able to and then complain about it."
ElderScrolls,3534et,OriginalPosta,3,Fri May 8 09:09:00 2015 UTC,"Nice, I agree."
ElderScrolls,3534et,foxsable,48,Wed May 6 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"Hunters guild would be great, hunting was really fun in Skyrim but not very profitable or rewarding without mods.  Maybe a Aedra guild or questline of some sort, something along the lines of the knights of the nine DLC for Oblivion  Also a proper mages guild, i loved guild halls in each city, they should bring that back. Actual requirements for joining exclusive guilds should be brought back too (looking at you theives guild) but in Skyrim it was bad you could be the archmage while only knowing like 3 spells."
ElderScrolls,3534et,JojenWalker,16,Wed May 6 18:43:55 2015 UTC,"but in Skyrim it was bad you could be the archmage while only knowing like 3 spells.   It really was ridiculous and I hope something like this won't ever be possible again in a TES game. But I think the main cause of this was the large amount of Winterhold story that was cut, and not actually intentional."
ElderScrolls,3534et,23PowerZ,4,Wed May 6 19:52:17 2015 UTC,"You should definitely be taught spells over the course of the Mage quest line.  I mean, it's common sense, really. Get given new spells that are needed for the quest."
ElderScrolls,3534et,badgersprite,2,Thu May 7 02:44:06 2015 UTC,thats kind of linear though imo
ElderScrolls,3534et,neophytegod,6,Thu May 7 05:22:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe one every quest and being necessary to progress is too much, but I still stand by the point that you should be learning spells organically through the Mage's Guild storyline, even if it's just things like being taught a new spell for completing a sidequest for one of the characters there. It would be a logical reward.  This definitely happened at least a bit in Oblivion, and it felt totally natural."
ElderScrolls,3534et,badgersprite,5,Thu May 7 05:26:34 2015 UTC,agreed. and you should be proving yourself. you should be able to prove that your alteration is better than each level's teacher. novice journeyman etc... and not just because it has a higher numerical value
ElderScrolls,3534et,neophytegod,2,Thu May 7 05:33:25 2015 UTC,you should be able to prove that your alteration is better than each level's teacher.   Some level of competency in the particular skill is an awesome idea.
ElderScrolls,3534et,OriginalPosta,2,Fri May 8 08:57:13 2015 UTC,"That is, fwiw, exactly how Morrowind factions work -- they have a set of faction skills, and advancement requires both minimum levels in those skills and a certain number of tasks completed."
ElderScrolls,3534et,jmelesky,1 point,Mon May 11 22:12:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like they dared to do a lot more in Morrowind. I don't subscribe to the ""hand-holding"" rhetoric, but I can only hope they re-integrate this kind of thing in future games."
ElderScrolls,3534et,OriginalPosta,3,Mon May 11 22:30:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe make questline quests have physical damage-resistant enemies, or traps that can only be  deactivated with high levek magic. Maybe a boss that has a ton of armor and teleports, make it absolutely bollocks for melee chars, but make it just hard enough for a mage with illusion, conjuration and destruction. Stuff like that.   Minion-spawning enemies with armor and/or sneak attack resistance, maybe. Basically, fuck melee chars hard."
ElderScrolls,3534et,EinherjarofOdin,1 point,Thu May 7 08:33:56 2015 UTC,There was stuff cut? Like what?
ElderScrolls,3534et,thinkpadius,4,Thu May 7 19:06:40 2015 UTC,"Nothing is actually known of the stuff that was cut, only that something was cut. One of the best educated guesses is that the LDB actually activates the Sphere of Magnus thereby somehow causing the Great Collapse back in time and needing the help of the Psijic Order to fix it."
ElderScrolls,3534et,23PowerZ,1 point,Thu May 7 19:52:09 2015 UTC,"One of the best educated guesses (snip)   This is where the community shines, imo; where they've come up with ideas so cool that if they weren't the initial intention of the devs, you kinda wish they were."
ElderScrolls,3534et,OriginalPosta,2,Fri May 8 08:59:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe a Aedra guild or questline of some sort, something along the lines of the knights of the nine DLC for Oblivion   Do you mean like Morrowind Temple: go kill the vampires mixed wit the Imperial Cults: I see a relic, you will find it close to water. bring it to me. you know what you should keep it."

ElderScrolls,3534et,SargeantSasquatch,1 point,Wed May 6 22:17:19 2015 UTC,"Skyrim's thieves guild sort of moved in that direction. It became a bit more thuggish rather compared to the dashing antics of Oblivion's. Even still, I'd like to see that concept pushed all the way."

ElderScrolls,3534et,nasty_nater,11,Thu May 7 04:16:20 2015 UTC,"I'd like an Elder Scrolls game where you can get more political power. You could create your own faction and set its policies in a similar way we used to create spells in Morrowind and Oblivion.  For example you could have a town and organize it like the mages guild in past games where magic users from all around would pay and learn about magic.  Or you could have a town with a mindset like the Telvanni and you would horde your magical secrets.  You may make a bit more cash with a mages guild themed town and in general most people may like you more but with a Telvanni like town you could be more selective of those who join you and earn wealth that way, or better yet you could use your secrets to aid someone influential and gain power like that."
ElderScrolls,3534et,lumpy999,1 point,Thu May 7 03:00:46 2015 UTC,"Wow this is an awesome idea, and would make being the leader of the faction a lot more fun than it is currently.

ElderScrolls,3534et,Fastolph,5,Wed May 6 20:33:45 2015 UTC,"You could join every guild, but some of them had conflicting objectives (like you can't steal from a guy if you've killed him earlier in a Morag Tong quest).

ElderScrolls,3534et,cheatatjoes,3,Wed May 6 20:42:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, this exactly. I think both Mages' Guild and Fighters' Guild final quests involved killing the leader of the other faction. You could join both, but only complete one. Well, until you use your little ~ magic..."

It's kind of sad that the Elder Scrolls are heading more towards that direction by pandering to a non-RPG style."
ElderScrolls,3534et,ifrit1100,7,Thu May 7 04:18:16 2015 UTC,"If you want to role play as only an assassin in Skyrim, the game does not force you to join the Mages Guild. Why do you need the game to specifically tell you that you can't?"
ElderScrolls,3534et,nasty_nater,1 point,Thu May 7 17:08:06 2015 UTC,"Eh, I guess I don't think you shouldn't be able to, but there should definitely be obstacles in the way. Or at least some sort of acknowledgement like ""oh, you're the Harbinger of the Companions, a Legate of the Imperial Legion, the Dragonborn, and now you want to join the College of Winterhold? Never seen that before.""  EDIT: Guess I might also add that Skyrim basically forces you into the mold of the Dragonborn. In Morrowind you weren't automatically the Nerevarine, you had to fulfill the prophecy by doing parts of the main quest. In Oblivion you weren't the Hero of Kvatch until you saved Kvatch. In Skyrim within the first few quests deemed Dragonborn, and everyone recognizes you as such, and dialogue options are automatically geared towards what the Dragonborn would say."
ElderScrolls,3534et,nasty_nater,2,Thu May 7 22:27:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly from a programming perspective; it's only adding a few more lines code. A simple if statement could determine whether an NPC recognizes you as someone. Am I the only one who finds it way less immersive to be the Legate of the Legion and stumble across Legionaires on the road who still address me as a common person instead of saluting me? Or being a Khajiit and the trade caravans treat me like a Nord for some reason? It just comes down to laziness from the developers in this instance.  It's very easy for a developer to come up with excuses for why they didn't implement a certain feature, but in all seriousness it mostly comes down to them not even thinking about it or being too lazy, or just dedicated to something else like focusing on graphics or putting all resources into marketing.  I mean what does ""load more on screen"" mean when it comes to armor? You're already loading tons of assets from the environment (individual items and clutter), NPCs, etc. etc., what makes it worse if they added individual armor pieces? Like with most things in Skyrim, they opted out for simplicity over complexity in order to pander to a more casual audience, which in my opinion is sorely detrimental to the notion of being an RPG."
ElderScrolls,3534et,Saeta44,1 point,Fri May 8 06:36:03 2015 UTC,"That's reasonable enough I think- if you're driven and clearly very skilled, then you would have a place in most guilds of you had the time and coin for it. The key is that there's few consequences in the two most recent games for your joining rival factions or factions with bad reps. I think that needs better addressing."
ElderScrolls,3534et,OriginalPosta,1 point,Fri May 8 14:22:54 2015 UTC,"because honestly what ""role"" would involve doing every single quest or faction?   The role of someone who does a lot of things in their lives. Perhaps some kind of heroic person. Its not that much of a stretch, tbh.   It leads to a shallow playstyle.   I disagree. You choosing a shallow playstyle leads to a shallow playstyle. And if that makes you happy, and you buy the game and make the developers more successful, that's awesome, cause I will never need to even spare one thought with how you played your game. I was too busy playing how I wanted to, viz. joining the mage's guild and ignoring the fighter's guild, coz I was a mage and had no inclination to do all the content just cause it was there.  i never went and knocked on the fighter's guild door and went ""damn! they will accept me. Ah well, better do the content, even though I don't want to.  Locking off content because people can't make their own choices sounds like hand-holding to me."
ElderScrolls,3534et,nasty_nater,2,Sat May 16 18:36:15 2015 UTC,"Not locking off content. It's putting obstacles in the way that actually make sense.

New, compelling factions could be added, in the same vein.  Having interesting political relationships between guilds for players to explore would be hugely appreciated, I think- instantly adding to the depth of story that people love about the game.  I honestly suspect, though, that to be competitive, its not necessarily an option. more guilds means more content, and less players per hour of content, and that's not so realistic these days I guess.

ElderScrolls,34zctg,devon5569,8,Tue May 5 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"Pick a topic (if you can't pick one topic there is a random button on in the Imperial Library). For example let's go with Ayleids (my personal favorite topic). Here is everything that has to do with Ayleids in the in game sources. Now there is quite a bit of stuff here, nine whole pages! Let's pick Magic from the Sky which deals with Welkynd stones, Varla stones, Ayleid Wells, and Sun worship. Well, now you wonder if there are any other uses for Welkynd stones? Repeat the process replacing Ayleids for Welkynd stones. Another source is /r/teslore which has all manner of interesting articles, which may or may not be true, much like the games themselves. So heading to /r/teslore you'd go to the search bar and type in Welkynd stones selecting search only in /r/teslore, which pulls up this page. On this page are two interesting articles : ""Bluefang and Sky-Smile: On the Secret Purpose of Welkynd Stones"" and ""My theory about the nature of Ayleid stones"" each of which may hold information you might find interesting. As for where to start, it is suggested that you read the 36 Lessons of Vivec as it will set the stage for some of the crazier aspects of the lore (CHIM, TalOS, Towers, Stones, Organic Time Machines, etc.). Then start reading up on what interests you. For many people the exotic metaphysics that make up a large part of the lore is a favorite  subject. In fact /u/rottendeadite has a whole site, called The New Whirling School, that examines the 36 Lessons. He also hosts a podcast on Youtube on the Memospore channel that touches on many of those metaphysical aspects and important factors, such as the Numidium (or Big Stompy). you should also take a look at the Wiki and the FAQ which are generally helpful. I will say that some people over there have become feed up with some questions that have been asked, if only because they've  been asked so many times before. To avoid disgruntling anyone use the search bar thoroughly before posting, it can help. Feel free to join in on the conversation, we always enjoy new scholars! Happy researching!

ElderScrolls,34zctg,Flatogeo,3,Tue May 5 21:56:11 2015 UTC,"Very thorough and well thought out answer. I second starting with The 36 Lessons of Vivec, as it details and connects to a lot of amazing in-game lore, as well as sets the ""framework"" for those interested in getting into some of the more obscure texts and out of game writings.  If you happen to already know a lot about Vivec and Tiber Septim, two other great reads I would personally recommend are centered around Cyrus the Restless (supposedly the same Cyrus who is the protagonist of TES Adventures: Redguard) and written by Michael Kirkbride.  Lord Vivec's Sword-Meeting With Cyrus the Restless  Tiber Septim’s Sword-Meeting with Cyrus the Restless"
ElderScrolls,34zctg,EpicPrawn,2,Wed May 6 05:27:20 2015 UTC,"I agree to a point. The Sword-Meetings are some of my favorite parts (that don't deal with the Ayleids), but they can be fairly confusing especially when everyone calls Cyrus ""HoonDing,"" who is the Yokudan god of make way, a god most people don't know about and wouldn't know to read up on. Because of his status as an avatar of HoonDing, anyone who reads the Sword-Meetings must understand several things, like the fact that ALL the gods in the Aurbis/ Elder Scrolls universe are real, what CHIM is and how it works, a general understanding of the FULL story of Talos' ascension and his role in the Aurbis, etc.   But if we're going to pimp the Sword-Meetings let's through the last one in too. It's part of a world building project by /u/IceFireWarden dealing with the Echmer ( check out /r/echmer). Here is HRAHNDEYL's Sword-Meeting with Cyrus the Restless."

I think ESO has added a greater percentage of lore books than any game since Morrowind, iirc.    Also, on the not of the Oblivion-Skyrim gap, there's a two book series, Infernal City and Lord of Souls, that takes place in that time period.

What bugs me sometimes is the forced nature of quests, like being trapped in a building, or not being able to kill an ""important"" character. One thing I'm looking forward to as well is how they handle the combat; Some features that'd be cool would be object inferences with weapons, weapons collision, projectiles colliding, more customized spells, and most importantly (not intelligent but rather) an adjusted AI. Certain NPCs will have better fighting AI than others, so like voicesets and schedule packages, different NPCs should be given pre-determined parameters for their combat AI chosen for them. I'm really, really hoping BethGames doesn't simplify the combat like they did with the skills.  Lot's to look forward to."

TBCH, I really just want an Elder Scrolls game that resembles Morrowind in depth, complexity, and immersiveness, just less clunky and even prettier."

Why would you entirely get rid of skills like Hand-to-Hand or Mysticism, while splitting the perfectly fine skill of Security into the awkward Lockpicking and Pickpocket skills? Also if it's too complex then people can simply not bother with those skill-trees, but I for one want to make unarmed martial artist characters. Spears. 'Nuff said. Either more guilds, or longer guild quest lines. The Companions and the College of Winterhold can pretty much be completed in one game day. Not only that, but when they're finished they're pretty much just...done. Nothing exciting happens and you're just left standing there. I'd also like to see the return of an Arena style faction. To piggy back on that; more interesting main quest line. No more ""an ancient evil awakens"" or ""KILL DA EVEEL DWAGON."" More lore. I love the old lore that they use in all the games, but for the love of Talos just add some more lore. I don't know how you can have an entire 200 years between Oblivion and Skyrim and the only substantial lore you add is the Great War. More complexity. This ties in to the first point, but Elder Scrolls was originally an RPG for RPG type nerds. I get that most modern developers are pandering to the casual crowd nowadays, but the series should be about exploring a complex, interesting, well-crafted world, not just a typical medieval adventure game."

The civil war is basically Skyrims inner dispute about Talos worship, independence against Imperial and Thalmor dominance. (Basically because Nordic customs don't fit in the modern empire. )  Great War is about the whole empire fighting Thalmor, and that war has come to more of a truce than truly end. Thalmor are preparing for one last assault to bend the rest of Tamriel to their will, and are currently observing Skyrim because of their civil war and dragon crisis.

Lord Dagoth recommended their immediate destruction, but Nerevar wished to consult with his other counselors, so he entrusted the tools to Lord Dagoth and had himself carried out to the Tribunal on the slopes of the mountain.

ElderScrolls,34tnl4,valergain,7,Tue May 5 00:24:41 2015 UTC,"The more I think about it the more I agree that Hammerfell will be the setting for the next game. Like you said there were many references to Redguard and Alik'r culture in Skyrim and it just makes sense for them to do something different (going from snowy Skyrim to deserty Hammerfell).  The cool thing about it is that it's not all desert either. I like to think that you'll be able to get lost in the Alik'r desert (your compass stops working and the map doesn't show where you are), but then there's also greener coastal areas, badlands, the Dragontail mountains, and the south and eastern portions are probably a lot like the Colovian highlands.  As far as cities I think they could be pretty diverse. Sentinel is a huge and prosperous Forebear port city. Hegathe is the center of Crown culture. Skaven would be where the Swordsingers are located (this game's Fighter's Guild equivalent). Since it's so close to Dwarven ruins I'd like to think Gilane would be Hammerfell's Markarth where all the buildings are Dwarven. Rihad would be a pirate port town. Elinhir apparently has a lot of mage history so could be the center of the Mage's Guild-like factions (Synod?). And personally I'd like to think Orsinium would be in the base game as one of the cities, which would really add to the diversity of regions.   DLC-wise they could do Stros'Mkai and the other islands west of Hammerfell, or even the Psiijic Order's mysterious Isle of Artaeum. And if the Thalmor are present they'd probably be doing stuff in the island where the Adamantine Tower is.  So yeah, it'd be pretty cool. Also they could fit it in with the past game's having local rulers like the Counts of Cyrodiil and Jarls of Skyrim by having local Princes ruling the various cities of Hammerfell."
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,dontlookatmeimnake,10,Tue May 5 15:10:51 2015 UTC,I'm betting Valenwood and Elsweyr personally. Would really like to see the Dominions perspective on things.

ElderScrolls,34tnl4,Aliensdoexist,4,Mon May 4 17:49:54 2015 UTC,"It could possibly affect their skin. Not being in the sunlight for hundreds-thousands of years would cause them to adapt (as we've seen with their eyes, ears, and their appearance now) to not need or to live without sunlight. Going back into sunlight could possibly hurt them. I mean, I'm not a TES doctor or lore-master by any means, but it's a possibility."
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,NickMotionless,4,Mon May 4 18:07:50 2015 UTC,Theoretically that could work in reverse. If they become adapted to dark then presumably over a long period (remember we don't know the time between this and Skyrim) they can equally asapt to sunlight once more.

I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a new ancient cultural ruin type of some kind.  Hoping that Black Marsh gets it. You have the Shadowscales and the rich culture of the Argonians. In my humble opinion, none of the TES games have ever focused enough on the culture of Argonians. Mostly only Elven and human races and quite a bit of focus on Kahjiits. It'd be nice to discover a lot more about Argonians."

'Nuff said Wide variety of terrain; Mountains, hills, forests, swamps, badlands, rivers and lakes Breton architecture looks pretty spiffy"
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,Odok,3,Tue May 5 00:20:12 2015 UTC,Chance to capitalize on the popularity of Game of Thrones and the more 'political' side of fantasy. Like they did with LotR and Oblivion.
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,notponies,1 point,Tue May 5 08:24:35 2015 UTC,This is what I'm hoping for.
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,Native_of_Tatooine,2,Mon May 4 21:20:23 2015 UTC,"My guess is Black Marsh. There's a lot in the metastory they can explore there with the Hist, and it ties into the whole kalpa-cycle interrupted hook introduced at the end of Skyrim. That's my only real lead. You can make a justification for any other province during any time period, save Summerset Isle if the Thalmor are still in power. A xenophobic fascist isolated state makes a pretty poor setting for a sandbox game like TES. Heck it'd be a stretch justifying why you could even make a non-mer character there, let alone seeing any human or beast race NPCs."
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,Aliensdoexist,7,Mon May 4 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"The only problem with Black Marsh is that MK (however irrelevant he is now to TES) said no beast race stories, and that basically all of Black Marsh is toxic to non-argonians in lore I believe."
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,Odok,2,Mon May 4 17:06:04 2015 UTC,"That's actually interesting. I wonder what the rationale and context was for that statement. Could you share a link, please?   basically all of Black Marsh is toxic to non-argonians in lore I believe   See, this has been quoted many times by players, but how many actual references exist for the claim? I think its just one, and as the developers have made a feature of (in game-authored) fallible context, propaganda and misinformation, I think it would be a weak barrier for the devs to bypass if they wanted to.  Even if the developers really went with that, you have to remember the setting and context. Its a fantasy game, full of magic and natural systems that don't work in the same way as irl. If they can rewrite all that has happened before and say ""Dragonbreak"", I don't see this as being a huge hurdle, if the devs had their sites set on Argonia."
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,twisterrk,3,Tue May 5 04:52:57 2015 UTC,"Or the entire hook for the game could be that the marsh is suddenly habitable and open to everyone. You could do a lot of interesting things with a dark, hidden, and pretty much completely isolated province suddenly being open to anyone. You'd have the obvious government powers, frontiersmen looking for fortunes, scholars, smugglers/opportunists, etc. You could zoom in and examine how the Argonians feel about it, showcasing the fear of sudden exposure and change, the loss and confusion of their ancient blanket of protection, divisions in society. And the MQ could focus on investigating why things changed, and could uncover that the Hist did it in order to move forward some plan they've conceived. Like they've been hiding pieces of previous kalpas and now with Alduin gone they need a Shezzarine to come ""unhide"" them.  Also screw MK. I respect what he's done for the game but lately he's just been acting like a child that can't play with the other kids anymore."
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,Soutaja,2,Tue May 5 11:10:05 2015 UTC,"I'll need to find the MK quote. It's in an AMA somewhere.   I do see your point though. Bethesda could retcon everything, like I assume they did with the Orcs, who weren't considered sentient. Then a dragon break occurred, and now we have PC orcs. Bethesda has the mother of all loopholes, and it is the dragon break."
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,twisterrk,2,Tue May 5 11:02:17 2015 UTC,"Bethesda retcons something in almost every TES game. I'm sure Black Marsh's diseases aren't that big of a hurdle.  And I want my medieval Lost World RPG dammit. :P   MK...said no beast race stories   Kirkbride, why do you hate freedom?"
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,Obliviuns,2,Tue May 5 21:33:27 2015 UTC,Because MK is a bundle of sticks. They could totally retcon everything though. I'm pretty sure they did quite a few in Skyrim. Not sure exactly which though.

ElderScrolls,34tnl4,awardments,2,Mon May 4 17:06:33 2015 UTC,"In short, the destruction of Nirn and its subsequent rebirth/recreation. Not just in terms of matter, but governing laws, physics, magic, etc. Alduin eats reality and then a new one takes its place. In (IIRC) Knights of the Nine it's hinted that the transition of the Dawn era to the next was a kalpa reset.  It's all community speculation after that. My personal notion is that the Aedra do it as a means of perpetually keeping Lorkhan ""dead"" in a similar matter to how the Daedra kept Sheogorath insane. But old Lorry has been hiding away remnants of old kalpas until he has enough to break the cycle, somehow, which he did in Skyrim with Alduin's destruction."
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,11475,1 point,Tue May 5 11:16:49 2015 UTC,"Although I would like Hammerfell a lot, but what about High Rock? Seems like there is little love for the Bretons in these speculation/wishlist threads."
ElderScrolls,34tnl4,11475,3,Tue May 5 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"The only reason I don't really see that happening is Daggerfall being set mainly in High Rock (and bits of Hammerfell). Hammerfell is one of few we really haven't gotten an in depth view of. If they want to appeal to the scu-er, wider buyer base, they have an opportunity to have another core mechanic, sword singing. The shouts were an attracting factor for Skyrim, and who wouldn't be entranced by lots of chanting and large angry nords yelling. (FOOS ROW DAH!) Sword singing has the chance to be bait yet again.    I will be happy as long as hand to hand returns, lol."

A lot of people are just assuming that Fallout 4 has been in development and will be released by Todd Howard's team at Bethesda's in-house development studio, but there is literally zero proof at the moment for that.  Many have even said that Todd Howard's recent interview that took place in Germany had Howard hinting at Fallout 4, but he never says that.  All we know is that they are making a game.  It could be F4, it could be ES6, it could be a different IP to work with, no one outside of Bethsoft knows.    For all we know, Bethesda could release F4 with a different developer, like they did with New Vegas.  I'd say, especially with Bethesda, don't get your hopes up when it comes to major releases until there has been legitimate confirmation from Bethesda."

ElderScrolls,34fg2w,BRGT,2,Thu Apr 30 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"When your forward momentum is greater than the rate at which gravity pulls you down, you get some air time. The stairs aren't too steep, and your fall damage has nothing to do with them. This is pretty realistic."
ElderScrolls,34fg2w,KiboshWasabi,0,Fri May 1 07:24:33 2015 UTC,You can normally run down stairs in real life and not get launched into the sky unless the stairs are too steep. It is pretty unrealistic and they made the stairs too steep.
ElderScrolls,34fg2w,KiboshWasabi,2,Fri May 1 15:22:33 2015 UTC,So you can sprint towards stairs and will magically adhere to each step regardless of physics?
ElderScrolls,34fg2w,KiboshWasabi,-1,Fri May 1 16:00:21 2015 UTC,"You can sprint towards stairs and still sprint down them with the momentum of sprinting towards them. You might fall, but it is possible."
ElderScrolls,34fg2w,KiboshWasabi,4,Fri May 1 16:36:35 2015 UTC,Not if your forward speed exceeds the speed at which your body is pulled by gravity towards earth. Its simple physics. Don't believe me? Take a ball to the top of some stairs. Kick the ball in the direction of the stairs. The only way to get the ball to touch the steps on the way down is to ensure its speed is lower than the speed at which it is pulled towards the earth.

Why there is no crossbreeding in the Third or Fourth Eras is not directly addressed, so far as I know. One can presume that reality itself was more malleable back in the First/Mythic Eras when Bretons first arose. Now the races have become too ""fixed"", along with the rest of reality, to allow for any new variations like Altmer-Nords or whatever.  It's important to keep in mind that the TES universe operates on narrative/metaphorical laws more than physical/biological laws. Not just in the sense that it's a fictional universe, either. It's actually true within the TES universe itself that reality is shaped by archetypes and metaphors rather than raw logic."

ElderScrolls,347pjk,PurpleFlurp16,5,Mon May 4 18:05:48 2015 UTC,"For mods, just head over to Morrowind Nexus. Download the nexus mod manager, and install any mods you want through that.  Morrowind uses a attack vs ac system that makes it so that your attacks don't always land, especially if you're fatigued. If you want combat to be more like skyrim and oblivion, then I'd recommend adding something like the accurate attack mod. If you play a mage, magic always hits, but isn't always successfully cast. Casting failure rate depends on skill in the school you're casting, fatigue, willpower, luck, and type of armor you're wearing. You can get an always cast mod if you want it to be more like oblivion/skyrim.  Morrowind has no quest markers, and no arrows point the way, which can make it pretty brutal. Generally you have to follow descriptive text in your journal to find out where to go. There's no real way around this with mods, so I'd keep google handy incase you get lost. A map mod can alleviate part of the struggle, but you'll still get hopelessly lost a few times.  You CAN kill quest-required NPC's, so save often and be careful about who you murder. This includes the main quest, and if you kill the wrong person, you can make the main quest impossible to complete through conventional means. For the main quest, if you kill an essential npc it will almost always display a message telling you that you can't complete the main quest now, so watch for that.  The skies are filled with a horrible beasts called cliff racers, and they will make you hate life. You can get a frequency reducer mod, or one that eliminates them entirely. If you want a more vanilla experience, then casting a 1s AOE levitate spell on them makes it so when the spell wears off, they fall to the ground and can't bother you anymore. Similarly, slaughterfish infest the waters, and they hate you for no reason. Avoid swimming with waterwalk or levitate spells when possible.  Merchants have frustratingly little gold. There's a scamp called Creeper in Caldera who you'll need for pawning off most of your expensive items. The only merchant with more gold is sort of out of the way, and thus is annoying to travel to. You can get a more gold for merchants mod, but if you don't mind a little hassle, there are ways to sell even the most expensive items to any mechant.  Check out the differences between Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim, as well as the UESP hints page for general gameplay tips.  Oh, and make sure to play around with the magic. The earlier TES games had really fun magic systems that you could do awesome stuff with at high levels. This is the last game that had a levitate spell in it, so make sure to play around with enchanting and spellmaking."

From there buy a few spells.  Get a spell that restores an attribute. Go to the spell crafting npc and make a spell that restores 10 points of each attribute. Having this spell in your spellbook will save your bacon later.  Divine Intervention and Almsivi Intervention. Use this chart to figure out where using these spells will take you.  On that note. Here is a map to help you get around.  Some people consider it to be a little cheese but a Fortify Intelligence 100 spell will make you really good at making potions and enchanting things. The spell only has to last for 1 seconds.   You can also make a fortify strength 100 spell for 1 second so that repair hammers never break (or break way less often).  Bound weapons are crazy op! They don't need to be repaired, they don't drain any stamina to swing because they weigh nothing and they have daedric level base damage. Just enchant a ring or something with a low cost summon weapon spell and you're good to go.  Buying a levitate spell and making a super easy to cast version is a very good idea. You'll find getting around much easier. Same goes for water walking and water breathing.  Buying the Mark and Recall spells will let you set a point you can teleport to. Making returning to a quest giver much less of a hassle or just a quick way to get you to the mages guild so you can get around.  In the town of Dragon Fel there is a merchant who sells and amulet of rest. This is a very good stamina recovery item. Remember that fighting without stamina is going to get you killed in a hurry.

Also, make sure you make your own 1 mana levitation spell. Levitating is key in Morrowind.   Combat is a little wonky, as you have a chance to miss melee swings. Your spells have a chance to fail based off your armor.   Do the main quest but don't focus on it. This game isn't as ""urgent"" as Skyrim or Oblivion.   Also, spellcasters aren't as powerful in this game as they were in Skyrim and to a lesser extent Oblivion. Not saying it can't be done, it'll just be harder for a 1st run.

The game is great but to help a new player appreciate it, we can't expect them to see it with the same rose tinted glasses that we do. Nostalgia doesn't work on newbies!  Let me prepare you by bringing everything down to earth.  The game is old. A lot of the mechanics will make you want to punch the computer. It's unnecessarily difficult in the beginning. There are several rage quit moments. There are few leveled lists. There high level dungeons along the beginner path to the first city! People have no knees! There's barely any audio dialogue.  Having said that if you can force yourself to put about 10 hours into the game, your mind will adjust.    The old graphics are just at the point where you can make things so much better with your own imagination and that's why it stays great. The various quest lines are excellent. Truly they are unique and Vvardenfall is a testament to creating fantasy that doesn't have to follow the Tolkien rules. There are genuine mysteries that you encounter in the game that you want to have answered, like the disappearance of the dwarves. This was the game that really focused on the mystery and got everyone riled up about the mystery. Solstheim! HTML dialogue! Armor on top of clothing! Jiub! Morgan Freeman. J/K only if you mod. speaking of mods: you can do the Morrowind 2011 mod package and try and make it look gorgeous, but something will get lost in the process. I highly recommend that if you do that mod (or whatever it's called now) then you reduce your view distance so that your retain the original foggy/mysty quality of Vvardenfall. The temptation is to make everything visible, but as soon as you do that everything will feel agoraphibic, you'll lose the desire to explore, and you'll realize that there's a lot of emptiness because back in the day the devs were limited by memory constraints. So keep your view distance to the original max view distance of like 9 cells or something."

ElderScrolls,347qko,TekaLynn212,4,Sun May 3 07:43:07 2015 UTC,"Now, I need to know what this game added to the canon lore   The game has two major storylines. The Planemeld, and the Three Banners War.  The Planemeld occurred when the Emperor legalized Daedra worship. Some people weren't happy about that, and a rebellion stormed the Imperial City and took over. One member of this rebellion, Mannimarco (seen in some other games), betrayed them, and enacted a ritual that weakened the barries between Nirn and Oblivion, letting Molag Bal attempt to merge Nirn and his realm, Coldharbour, together into one. This is known as the Planemeld.  The Three Banners War is a war between three opposing factions, all attempting to take Cyrodiil, and gain rule over Tamriel.  While the evens are canon, they happen centuries before any TES game and have little to no effect on their stories.    what areas have been ""explored"" (meaning they most likely won't be featured in an eventual TES:VI)   A map of all current available areas in ESO  Again, this game takes place a long time before the main series. The areas would be significantly different, and so the places seen in it could still be in a future game.   and anything else that you think could interest me.   ESO takes place in the Interregnum, a period between the fall of the Second Empire and the beginning of the Third Empire.  During this time, three factions attempt to claim Imperial City and rule Tamriel. The factions are:  Daggerfall Covenant: Orcs, Reguards and Bretons joined together to take the throne due to dwindling trade routes and poverty throughout the land. They want Tamriel to move forward into a new era of prosperity, and believe they are the ones to make it happen.  First Aldmeri Dominion: Altmer, Bosmer, and Khajiit have allied in Southwestern Tamriel. They believe that human rulers are too emotional and short-sighted, and believe it would be best for all if a long-lived Elven ruler sat on the throne. Despite this, they are vehemently NOT racist, and have caused quite a stir with some elves who consider the High Elves superior.  Ebonheart Pact: Made up of Dunmer, Argonians, and Nords, the pact is probably the most unstable faction. Despite the mistrust and hatred between many members of their races, the Ebonheart Pact was formed to fight back against common enemies such as Molag Bal and the other factions."

Though they're less a 'history of' and more reviews, he still includes some history and background on both. And he's hasn't reviewed any of the newer games, though he did do a let's play of Morrowind and Skyrim.  There's probably other, more in-depth videos out there, closer to what you're looking for, but LGR is one of my favorite YouTubers, and his reviews are an entertaining little taste for both."

I've seen a few things that will say ""Only 5 left, order now"" and the price will be astronomical, but then going back a week later it no longer says how many are left and the price will have plummited.  Maybe add it to a wish list and see how the price fluctuates? Hope this helped."

ElderScrolls,343ogo,CSGOWasp,4,Tue Apr 28 02:55:31 2015 UTC,"Uh, no, it can't. It's not cheating the system, we're getting dicked.   Our adult minimum wage (21 and over) is £6.50, and for ages lower than that it only decreases. £6.50 equates to something like $9.90.  $26 for anthology, £60-£80 for us in the UK. $26 is £17. How is £60-£80 justified? It's just fucked."

ElderScrolls,3443r2,theforsaken7,5,Tue Apr 28 07:09:01 2015 UTC,"Ok I would highly recommend not playing Morrowind on console. For whatever reason it has aged like milk, loading times are horrendous. Just about any PC today can play Morrowind, and it's a fascinating game that will draw you in with it's outstanding characters and storylines."
ElderScrolls,3443r2,RHPR07,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:26:01 2015 UTC,"I know you hate to hear it, and I don't mean to sound like an elitist, but I'm going to. Morrowind must be played on PC, especially after you play skyrim. There is a project called Skywind, where Morrowind is being remade in Skyrim's engine. In order to use it you must have both skyrim and Morrowind with all of the expansions. If you are willing to give PC a chance, try buying the elder scrolls anthology, very cheap. Modding is no longer a challenge, just use Nexus Mods."
ElderScrolls,3443r2,Devonic96,-7,Mon May 4 05:00:23 2015 UTC,"Morrowing IS better modded on PC. That being said you can play it on 360 if you have a live account, you'll have to get the backwards compatibility patch to play it. Last bit of advise, take the money you would spend on ESO and use it to wipe your ass. Its a better use of that money."
ElderScrolls,3443r2,KiboshWasabi,3,Tue Apr 28 07:48:58 2015 UTC,I was with you up until the ESO part. ESO is alright.

ElderScrolls,3443r2,Some_Random_Nob,5,Tue Apr 28 17:59:53 2015 UTC,Why do you think it's so bad? I had fun playing it.
ElderScrolls,3443r2,braden26,-5,Tue Apr 28 18:04:48 2015 UTC,"Laggy, uninteresting, differed from any other ES game way too much, being the chosen adventurer who must venture into a mystic dungeon is silly when you see 8 others down there, all with better gear then you farming all the monsters in the dungeon so you can just run past them. The price was fucking ridiculous, $70 for the base game that didn't include a free first month. I didn't like the skills bar, it ruined the combat for me. There's micro transactions and gold sellers galore and I ran into an unbearable amount of bugs but I'm sure a majority of them are fixed by now.  The game looks really pretty though."
ElderScrolls,3443r2,Some_Random_Nob,4,Tue Apr 28 18:29:12 2015 UTC,"OK the lag is either ur Internet or your computer, it's buy to play now. It may have had a rocky start but it is fine now and a pretty good game."
ElderScrolls,3443r2,braden26,-2,Tue Apr 28 18:30:41 2015 UTC,"I think we can agree that it's very different from any other ES game and just because you like Skyrim doesn't mean you'll like ESO.  And the lag was from the servers being overloaded, my internet is fine."
ElderScrolls,3443r2,Some_Random_Nob,5,Tue Apr 28 18:38:10 2015 UTC,"So change is bad? Morrowind was immensely different than from Daggerfall and Oblivion is even more different than Morrowind. ESO is an MMO so it's obviously going to take cues from the successful ones like WoW. ESO is a great MMO in my opinion and I hate MMOs, except Runescape. Runescape was the shit."
ElderScrolls,3443r2,braden26,-4,Tue Apr 28 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"I never said change was bad, I said the changes that they chose to make made a negative impact on my impression and enjoyment of the game. The changes from each ES game where either a small mech rework, a measurable improvement or added content. ESO makes changes that throw the game into an entirely different genre that I personally don't like, even if you agree that it's a good game, you can't argue that it's drastically different from any ES game.  If you disagree I'll kick ur ass in lvl 58 wildy."

ElderScrolls,341y6e,Zoltanu,22,Mon Apr 27 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"It is playable.. but there are some things about it.   First, you can not walk from town to town. It is SO far you'll never get there. LIke ever.   Second, dungeons are so big. Going into a dungeon without setting a recall/teleport, you might never make it out. The maps don't help.   finally, it is buggy. Hopefully there are patches and things that help, but sometimes you just fall through the terrain."
ElderScrolls,341y6e,foxsable,3,Mon Apr 27 18:14:17 2015 UTC,"I made my guy that uber strong, uber tank, uber retarded and I got through it all without recall/ teleport. I mean my guy had the lowest intelligence and couldn't regen mana in daylight or at night so casting anything was a given NOPE.  But if you just stick you ass the the wall on your right and keep going until you finish the dungeon or have the floor plan memorized you can do it.   Since you have a billion HP and do a billion damage with you strength so high and do a billion damage because you have the most epic armor and weapons because you have max luck the game doesn't become so much about being difficult as it is racing through quests so you can watch the cutscenes and get the lore out of it first hand."
ElderScrolls,341y6e,FlamingSnot93,5,Tue Apr 28 19:19:59 2015 UTC,That's barely playable to me lol.
ElderScrolls,341y6e,foxsable,3,Tue Apr 28 20:23:19 2015 UTC,Yeah it definitely isn't on my list of games to play again... I hope eventually they remake it somehow because the ending is soooo good.
ElderScrolls,341y6e,FlamingSnot93,7,Tue Apr 28 21:32:04 2015 UTC,"Daggerfall is better than Arena. It's more like an RPG, there's more story, more features (ship homes! Vampires, werewolves, books, bank loans, horsies...), cool spells (mostly the stuff you also get in Morrowind, like mark/recall, jump, levitate, water walking), and it's much bigger.  With that said, I disliked the same things in Daggerfall that I disliked in Arena. The gameplay is very similar, and every place is a huge dungeon. At one point, you're supposed to go talk to an old lady in a castle. The castle? Of course, it's a dungeon! Worse, you don't get Passwall in Daggerfall.  If you're fed up after playing Arena, probably just skip to Morrowind. Between Arena and Daggerfall, though, Arena is a lot more skippable of the two. It's basically just a dungeon crawler, while Daggerfall has story and lore."
ElderScrolls,341y6e,MasturbatingCatfish,17,Tue Apr 28 02:28:54 2015 UTC,"Skip to Morrowind. Daggerfall is alright but you'll die a lot and there's a LOT of ""wait 2 weeks for my letter at this location. If you are not there between 2 and 5am I will assume you are dead."" situations that will genuinely fail the main quest.   You can save quick though, and there is a fast travel ability that Morrowind doesn't have (can be done from the map instead of silt striders and boats). Plus, you can map the controls to be just like the later games without mods.    Edit: always keep at least two saves! And one for when you enter a dungeon and one when you make it out! I lost a game once because I saved right as a monster opened the only door out of a room. I died, reloaded, and the door was stuck partially open. Didn't move. Tried really hard. And there's no console in Daggerfall.."
ElderScrolls,341y6e,FuzzelFox,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:56:02 2015 UTC,i have found that 3 saves and one extra for certain actions is the magic number.

ElderScrolls,341y6e,dallonweekes,3,Mon Apr 27 22:49:18 2015 UTC,Look into Daggerfall Unity. It's an open source port of Daggerfall with mod support. Only playable for developers right now but it's making progress very quickly.  Here's a video  Bonus
ElderScrolls,341y6e,apocryphalmaster,3,Tue Apr 28 11:44:26 2015 UTC,daggerfall is a huge improvement over arena
ElderScrolls,341y6e,MrTimmannen,2,Tue Apr 28 14:09:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit puzzled that no one has mentioned it yet (definitely needs more attention): take a look at /r/dftfu. /u/DFInterkarma is building ""daggerfall tools for unity"" as i understand it, it's an API to bring elements of DF into the unity-engine. /u/InconsolableCellist is using that to build a port of DF in Unity, which would geht rid of the many limitations coming with the original game. It's awesome what they've done so far, there are playable demos available. I would suggest some patience and waiting for a finally playable Version of DF, at least that's what i'm doing atm, being in the same situation as you are."
ElderScrolls,341y6e,aurbicorbit,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:43:15 2015 UTC,"It depends what you want out of the game. Do you want to have a challenging experience getting lost in dungeons and having epikk fights with the monsters? If that is the case don't take my advice.   If you just want to the experience of a vintage game and to experience the lore first hand this is what I did to complete the game.   Set all the controls to be as close to skyrim as possible as soon as you get to the beginner dungeon.  Pick Highelf, lower WIS and INT and PER all the way down, Do ""weakness to paralysis""(highelf cant be paralyzed so doesnt matter) ""doesnt regen mana in daylight""""Doesnt regen mana at night"" forbid all the shit you dont need crank all remaining stats into ST AG LUCK END and become profiencent in the weapon you want (probably long sword). Putting points into luck is super strong in this game because you can usually get ridiculous loot in just the first opening dungeon.    I'm at work currently and trying to do this off the top of my head but i think that is everything i did to make it fun for myself. Get a horse and fast travel to most places. One of the church factions lets you stay in inns for no charge so I would buddy up to them early in the game too"
ElderScrolls,341y6e,FlamingSnot93,2,Tue Apr 28 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"Haven't played it, but don't delay playing Morrowind any longer."
ElderScrolls,341y6e,SargeantSasquatch,2,Mon Apr 27 19:26:29 2015 UTC,"If you use character creation correctly, there are some tricks that will allow you to level rapidly, since how quickly you level depends on your many weakness & strengths your character takes on (like giving yourself critical weakness to poison, disease, & paralysis but then resistance to magic to cancel those out--very rapid leveling). That makes combat pretty easy and only the enemies that are really designed to one-shot you (ie vampire lords at low levels) will.  The dungeons are insane though. They're all randomly generated and also 3D, so they're horrible mazes without any rhyme or reason. You can use walkthroughs to get through them pretty quickly, though, but then you'll have more difficulty leveling.  I really enjoyed Daggerfall, but I also enjoyed Arena. If you hated Arena you probably won't enjoy Daggerfall."
ElderScrolls,341y6e,TheSpaceWhale,2,Mon Apr 27 20:27:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you want to play a old school RPG, a game like Baldurs Gate is much better today then the old Elders Scrolls games.  I'm a huge fan of the series, but there's no denying the lack of the quality in Arena and Daggerfall that was present in other RPGs of the time such as Fallout or Baldurs Gate (which, to be fair, came out a couple years later) as well as all the Elders Scrolls games since Morrowind.  Also the gameplay and graphics haven't aged as well as it's isometric cousins, but overall, I do think Daggerfall is better than Arena."
ElderScrolls,341y6e,Th3DeathDog,4,Mon Apr 27 22:51:27 2015 UTC,I'm getting pretty demoralized as I am coming to the conclusion that Daggerfall is unplaybale to anyone who isn't extremely stubborn.
ElderScrolls,341y6e,Jannaeus_Sulla,10,Tue Apr 28 00:22:49 2015 UTC,Pretty much sums up the experience of early video game history.
ElderScrolls,341y6e,eMeLDi,1 point,Tue Apr 28 05:08:58 2015 UTC,"Took me a fair number of attempts to get out of the first dungeon, and then get anything done after it. I've never even picked up the main quest beyond that lady we have to see before she leaves.  Someone did a stream of his first time playing Daggerfall the other day, and I felt sorry for him as he had so much trouble doing anything without help. And for stupid things like managing your inventory or renting a room in an inn. When he said ""I'm almost having fun"", he probably summed up his experience.  It's worth trying for the experience because there's just no other game like it, but yes, stubbornness is a requirement. Or time-travel back to '97 and you'll have nothing better to do than to figure out the game anyway."
ElderScrolls,341y6e,Fastolph,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:12:50 2015 UTC,"You must remain diligent to the ""Never leave the wall on my right"" rule. If you do that after a few trips around an entire dungeon you will come to 1 of 2 conclusions.   1 you made it out with the quest item in hand  2 you fucked up all the switches but have memorized the map to the point you can leave the wall and fix the switches.  Being stubborn is required but I would also consider having lots of time to kill just as important."

ElderScrolls,3437pz,herbushdinks,5,Mon Apr 27 23:15:29 2015 UTC,This video is the only thing I have seen that is done by bethesda that you can speculate off of. Everything else is people just wanting something so they make it look like they are right.
ElderScrolls,3437pz,FlamingSnot93,5,Tue Apr 28 19:44:19 2015 UTC,I suspect they've been putting extra effort in keeping development under wraps. I think if anyone suspected TESVI was in the works than ESO sales would've suffered. That being said I wouldn't bet on hearing anything until next year.
ElderScrolls,3437pz,KiboshWasabi,6,Tue Apr 28 07:54:17 2015 UTC,Bethesda is probably working hard on Fallout 4. They'll probably start working on it just before Fallout releases.

ElderScrolls,3437pz,TheMadTemplar,7,Tue Apr 28 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. Skyrim was a ridiculous bombshell of a game that raked in all the money ever. They probably put the sweet cash monies towards making TES VI to satiate the new colossal-ass fanbase, as well as to make Fallout 4."
ElderScrolls,3437pz,ngtaylor,4,Wed Apr 29 14:32:08 2015 UTC,"There is nothing. In all likelihood development of the game hasn't even started yet, and everything is just on the drawing board. Leaks usually happen when a game has undergone a significant amount of development."
ElderScrolls,3437pz,LeMAD,5,Tue Apr 28 05:13:25 2015 UTC,"Its about to have been 5 years since Skyrim, they are definitely working on it, especially since they doubled their workforce"
ElderScrolls,3437pz,SharlBird,3,Tue Apr 28 19:31:10 2015 UTC,"especially since they doubled their workforce   Source?  And even if it was true, Fallout 4 probably has a much bigger budget than Skyrim, and probably a lot more people working on it.  If they are indeed working on both series at the same time, it would probably mean that one of them is not developped by BGS."
ElderScrolls,3437pz,TheMadTemplar,0,Wed Apr 29 21:53:46 2015 UTC,"It normally takes about 3 years of developement to make a game. So I'm sure they're working on TES VI, in fact they were concepting FO4 as soon as FO3 came out, even though their entire 'workforce' was working on skyrim. And about Fallout 4 having a bigger budget than Skyrim, now that's just being a fanboy. They probably have very similar budgets, as Bethesda takes the same amount of time to make them and they are about the same size. If you mean it in a   progressive way(although it doesn't seem like it), then that's totally fine. But that completely disproves what you're trying to say, as TES VI would have the same budget as Fallout 4."

ElderScrolls,3437pz,TheMadTemplar,0,Tue Jun 23 03:54:14 2015 UTC,"But in order to have a larger game you NEED a larger budget. Unless you except workers to take money from their own lives and commit it to the project, that is."
ElderScrolls,3437pz,Nuclear_hellfire,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:51:54 2015 UTC,"I still NEVER said anything about either game having a larger budget. You're grasping at straws here.    And about Fallout 4 having a bigger budget than Skyrim, now that's just being a fanboy.   I never said anything about. In fact, nobody in this thread did.    But that completely disproves what you're trying to say, as TES VI would have the same budget as Fallout 4.   Dude, what the fuck are you smoking? Again, never said that.   For a refresher, here is what I did say:   There is nothing. In all likelihood development of the game hasn't even started yet, and everything is just on the drawing board. Leaks usually happen when a game has undergone a significant amount of development.   Do you see the word budget in there? Do you see anything about any title being larger than the other? Do you see anything that would suggest I am implying one game has had more time and money than the other? No, you don't. Stop being such an idiot."
ElderScrolls,341b4x,Incognizance,10,Mon Apr 27 15:00:35 2015 UTC,I'd like to see it come back. It's more realistic (for me at least) to believe characters are wearing clothes under their armor. I'd think there'd be some major chaffage otherwise
ElderScrolls,341b4x,ScottyBeans,3,Mon Apr 27 19:59:52 2015 UTC,I think the implication in later games is that the under garments are part of the armor. The artwork supports that. I doubt the DragonBorn rocked bone armor Commando.
ElderScrolls,341b4x,KiboshWasabi,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:51:52 2015 UTC,"With non fantasy armor you do wear clothing underneath, but it's special arming garments (specific fabrics to deal with heat/sweat and usually padded). Given the enchantment system you could enchant those but, it's not like you'd be wearing normal pants or rare artifact clothing under there.  I don't know of any historical precedent for wearing robes over the armor, but certainly tunics were worn over armor."
ElderScrolls,341b4x,dagit,6,Sun May 3 06:08:31 2015 UTC,"The issue is animation. The more faces and bones you have to animate on screen, the more resource intensive the game is at any given time. Also, much more work for animators. Also, harder to make sure the game follows the aesthetic that the designers want. It was a cost-vs-benefit decision. The benefit of throwing together whatever armor and clothing you wanted to make a Hodge-podge outfit was outweighed by the cost of enabling it in this newer, more graphically-intensive rendering engine."
ElderScrolls,341b4x,Haplo12345,3,Tue Apr 28 01:58:47 2015 UTC,"This needs more upvotes. Even back in morrowind just mixing different sets together caused major clipping. it would be a nightmare to make it so every set item fit together still allowed the character to move, and didnt clip. Even then putting clothes under the armor just made it disappear in morrowind. how do you handle that in a more modern game where people actually pay attention to that sort of thing.if you put a shirt on then some sort of sleeveles leather armor over it how do you handle that. Clip the armor through the shirt? mke the shirt disappear? have a different set of models that accounts for all combinations of shirts under that armor? until we get an engine that allows fully deforming clothing to be implemented its best for the devs to just let modders worry about creating each iteration of the shirt armor scheme and spend time on just making the set look good."
ElderScrolls,341b4x,theoriginaled,0,Tue Apr 28 17:25:24 2015 UTC,"The issue is animation. The more faces and bones you have to animate on screen, the more resource intensive the game is at any given time.   Nah. Clothing doesn't have bones, and they have nothing to do with facial animations. They wrap around and deform with the existing bones of the character.   Also, harder to make sure the game follows the aesthetic that the designers want.   This was not a problem in morrowind. Everything just followed the Morrowind aesthetic"".  All clothing in skyrim follows the skyrim aesthetic, so wearing clothing with armor should not be an aesthetic problem.   The benefit of throwing together whatever armor and clothing you wanted to make a Hodge-podge outfit was outweighed by the cost of enabling it in this newer, more graphically-intensive rendering engine.   Nah man. Morrowind and oblivion were the ""next gen"" games that were a great techonological leap. When skyrim came around, console hardware and especially PC hardware were established, and skyrim was made to run on them (as opposed to having to upgrade just to run skyrim). I ran skyrim fine on my 550i.  A quote from wikipedia: Had the team not been able to meet their design goals with current hardware, they would have waited for the next generation and released Skyrim then,[32] but, as Howard felt, the current technology did not hold the team back at all."

ElderScrolls,341b4x,Contagious_Cure,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:01:21 2015 UTC,The reason was to enhance performance as they wanted larger scale battles for Skyrim (e.g. the battle of Whiterun). Contrast this to the battle of Bruma in Oblivion where it was only 1 guard from each city and only about 3-4 Daedra came out of the Great Gate a time. Not exactly an EPIC battle.
ElderScrolls,341b4x,ifrit1100,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:11:40 2015 UTC,"Balancing is the main issue probably. But also Todd Howard (I think) said for Skyrim they combined armour pieces in order to allow for more things to load on screen. Some armour in Oblivion/Skyrim reveal skin, so if you were wearing clothes underneath the game would have to render this to fill in the exposed places?"
ElderScrolls,341b4x,Phhhhuh,2,Mon Apr 27 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"This is correct, that was the sole reason they merged cuirass and greaves into one. I didn't like that from a role-playing perspective, it makes more sense to be able to put together different kinds of armour, but if they say it helps the gameplay/graphics I'm sure they've thought it through. And the enchantment-stack from Morrowind was obviously unbalanced, but that could have been circumvented by only allowing enchantments on jewellery."

ElderScrolls,343vjb,skulluminati,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:01:53 2015 UTC,Sometimes the influence of community reactions can be surprising.  Over the span of a few days we went from Valve announcing a new policy to the CEO of Valve personally jumping in to a forum full of pissed of gamers to Valve completely repealing the policy and refunding everyone impacted by it.    I'd like to think they've learned a few lessons from that and won't try something as blatant again anytime soon.  If anything perhaps they'll try a pay what you want/donation model for the next big Bethesda game (Fallout 4).    I'd like to think that the amount of backlash scared them and they learned a lesson about trying to profit off of fans doing extra work for them to make their games last longer.

ElderScrolls,33ybxq,sunsprie,10,Sun Apr 26 20:19:41 2015 UTC,"There aren't really any point of no returns. Basically, you have zones.   Zone 1: Level 1-10 quests and monsters Zone 2: Level 10-20 etc   You can go back to old zones. You can generally travel to any other zone at Level 1 but of course, enemies on the way can kill you and you won't have a lot of quests to do. So within a zone there is good exploration.  The quests are basically of 3 types:   Kill enemies Talk to NPCs Interact with an object (e.g. Pull 5 levers, burn 10 tents)   These are typical MMO quests. There aren't many puzzles and you have a quest arrow to show you where to go. However, quests are usually lore rich and have a story behind them so they're not really like ""Hi, can you kill 10 bears? Thanks"" - there might be a Daedra nearby possessing the bears so you have to kill them.  There are some choices in quests, like who to execute. However these are obviously not as varied as with single player games - you won't find a quest like Whodunit or Paranoia. Both of these quests had many many paths you could take but ESO understandably isn't the same. So I would say quests are mostly linear like normal MMOs."

ElderScrolls,33ybxq,TheSpaceWhale,3,Fri May 8 05:33:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely! The world is huge and fairly open-ended, within limits. It is zoned (which are leveled) so it's more restricted than main series Elder Scrolls, but on the plus side are lots of things to find that are interesting and unique, and it feels much more hand-crafted and less copy-and-paste compared to the main series.  Quests are IMO better than main-series, definitely better than Skyrim's at least. Much more varied, lots of unique battlefields that aren't just Ruin #321."
ElderScrolls,33ybxq,hhhnnnnnggggggg,-1,Mon Apr 27 02:39:11 2015 UTC,"There are invisible walls in awkward places. It's not like WoW where if you can climb it, you can climb it. In ESO, if you can climb it, then there's an invisible wall stopping you.  I'm not even talking about zone barriers, but just random hills and trees in the middle of a zone will have invisible walls roping you off from it like a damn museum.  There's no secret areas or hidden Easter eggs because everyone has to follow the theme park path.  As an actual explorer it pissed me off.  You don't have to go from point A or B. The areas you are allowed to walk in are pretty big, but the confines are pretty obvious since some zones are pretty narrow, forcing you on a path unlike other Elder Scrolls games."

I heard it was going B2P in when I read some article about it in February this year. I decided yo give it another shot. So far it's been nothing but awesome times.

It's come really damn far from then, you can trust me on that.    Honestly, I think it's worth getting.  You're in this sub, so I take it you like elder scrolls, and you're at least somewhat interested in it, so I think you may enjoy it.

Werewolves have also gained 2 new abilities (a heal and a cone damage) making them much better overall in PvE but in pvp there's still the issue with you being a fuckin massive target that literally every enemy will target if they see you. If you're just fighting a couple enemies, then WW is great with very little downsides. Another thing they gave WW is a passive 15% bonus to Stamina regen (even when you're not in WW form), some people consider this to be unbalanced currently as you can just pick up WW for the stamina regen and never have to use ww form. Overall they're both more balanced then they've ever been for both PvE and PvP"

Except that ESO is set in the Second Era, and Skyrim (and thus the Great & Civil Wars) in the Fourth.  That aside, and bearing in mind I have no interest in playing ESO myself (I play exactly one MMO, and that mostly solo), I find there are too many conflicts between what Zenimax came up with and the established canon from Bethesda; which I view like the happenings in Daggerfall and the incident of the Warp in the West, which pretty much rendered all player actions moot.

I highly doubt stormcloaks lose their fight, there is no point in all that trouble just to see them lose. Hammerfell is pretty pissy about the whole situation with the empire.

Vampirism holds a central place in my canon--my Daggerfall roleplay was an honorable nightblade Redguard servant to the emperor who was turned against her will by Mannimarco and thus manipulated into siding with him in the contest over the totem, with his ascension to godhood being my canon's reason for the dragonbreak. Super fun and allowed for a lot of character development and different playstyles in one playthrough (good, righteous and hardcore evil), and with the perks of her immortality I've worked the character into subsequent games as well, since she is immortal and all."
ElderScrolls,33rggr,TheSpaceWhale,4,Sat Apr 25 00:22:48 2015 UTC,"Different playstyles in one playthrough   Yes, I loved taking my dragonborn through the Companions/Werewolf story arc for this reason.  Gave an excuse to explore some very dark directions with a character that had otherwise been pretty good and self-righteous up to that point.  Generally this is the playstyle I gravitate towards, with some development/changes in the character's morality over time, really makes for a rich experience."

ElderScrolls,33r4kp,takahashia16,67,Fri Apr 24 20:49:36 2015 UTC,"From a marketing standpoint it doesn't make sense to release both games close to each other. There is a lot of overlap in the target audience and fanbases of these franchises. Both series are known for being a 100+ hour time sinks and will for sure have special edition releases costing $80+ and the publisher wouldn't want to create a situation where fans would have to choose between the two for financial or time constraint issues. While it is certainly a possibility that we will be getting news about both games this E3, in my opinion the actual game releases should be spaced out by at least 6 months to a year."
ElderScrolls,33r4kp,wintermute27,7,Fri Apr 24 21:14:04 2015 UTC,I'd say the same. Those games are too similar to be released together.

We know that Bethesda will always be working on an Elder Scrolls game at any given point.  It's their flagship IP, but is it actually confirmed they they're working on a new Fallout game?"
ElderScrolls,33r4kp,TheFreeman16,3,Sat Apr 25 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"Fallout 4 was confirmed back in 2008. Unfortunately there hasn't been a lot of official news from Bethesda since, but their stated intentions for the IP are clear."
ElderScrolls,33r4kp,wintermute27,3,Sat Apr 25 17:22:50 2015 UTC,"That article is from 2008, that's a bit too outdated to convince me.  That's also a pretty vague statement (which is close to what Bethesda says about all of their IPs) Are you sure that Pete isn't referring to Fallout: NV?  Or that maybe things have changed since then?  I don't mean to seem negative, but I have to be skeptical when it comes to video game releases (especially from Bethesda, see the Prey 2 debacle).    There's usually a few leaked trademarks filed by Zenimax before a big release, but I haven't seen anything that indicates a major fallout related title is on the way (aside from this enigmatic press conference I keep hearing about).  A lot of people are fully convinced that a Fallout game developed by Bethesda's in-house developer is and has been in development, but until I see some more concrete proof than Pete's 7 year old, ambiguous statements then I'm not jumping to any conclusions."
ElderScrolls,33r4kp,TheFreeman16,15,Sat Apr 25 21:02:02 2015 UTC,"Does Zenimax/Bethesda have enough money to support development of TES VI and Fallout 4 simultaneously? Yes.  However, they probably won't, as if both were released within a short window of each other, Zenimax would be competing with itself and would not be able to make the most possible cash off each game being released in an environment where they weren't competing with another Zenimax title. So, for completely capitalistic, corporate reasons, no, it won't happen.  (FYI: Zenimax is Bethesda's parent company for those who weren't aware.)"
ElderScrolls,33r4kp,shinjiryu,6,Sat Apr 25 02:23:12 2015 UTC,"I see them being maybe 6 months apart at the absolute closest, but if they were to be released close to each other the closest I can imagine realistically happening is 1 year.  Even that seems unlikely though."
ElderScrolls,33r4kp,ON3i11,3,Sat Apr 25 10:03:39 2015 UTC,"New Vegas was developed by Obsidian Entertainment for instance, the guys who just made Pillars of Eternity. And Bethesda isn't a single monolithic studio. There's Bethesda Game Studios which is the dev end and Bethesda Softworks, the publisher end. And Bethesda is working with Arkane Studios as well. Obviously they have more than one team, but I imagine personnel shuffling still happens."
ElderScrolls,33r4kp,Keld1n,3,Sat Apr 25 08:59:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'd release both around the same time.  Since Fallout and TES are their major game series I think they'd want to ""stagger"" them a bit.  My unrealistic hope for E3 is that maybe Bethesda will jump on the ""HD remake"" bandwagon and do an official new HD Morrowind, but I doubt it, since there are already mods for people who play Morrowind."
ElderScrolls,33r4kp,THETEH,2,Sat Apr 25 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"I would agree, but I don't think it'd be wise to release two competing games near each other. They want to let the market fully obsess over one, not have to decide between the two."
ElderScrolls,33r4kp,DAC_tbwe,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:45:23 2015 UTC,"It'd be great to hear news that both franchises have games that are actively being developed, and with the way Bethesda is building up this E3 announcement it's a very real possibility.  I don't think that both will be released in the same year though for the reasons that have already been mentioned.  If there is news about both TES:VI and Fallout 4 it'd probably be one coming out this year around X-Mas time, and the other the following year around the holidays again.

This is why you can't charge for mods to begin with people.  Either Steam's made a bunch of agreements with IP (Intellectual Property) holders, or this is only for certain games, or a bazillion lawsuits will be heading Valve's way in a few microseconds.  Just my observations here.  UPDATE: Yes, I signed the petition. This is utterly stupid Valve. Why? I've spent ~5 hours trying to reconfigure my own Skyrim install, with effectively the maximum number of allowed mods (255, or FF in hex), and am having a few annoying issues. Ugh.

There is no way Valve or even Bethesda deserve 75% for something that they did nothing for. But you can't really blame people for wanting some compensation for their work, especially the huge mods like Falskaar that they've put hundreds or thousands of hours of work into. It's not like anyone's forcing you buy these mods."
ElderScrolls,33p8f7,KiboshWasabi,2,Fri Apr 24 19:58:02 2015 UTC,"I think attributing nothing to the developer is a little short sighted. Most of the time the mod is made up of 90% of the developers assets, just reconfigured in some way. As for the distribution network, thats the sole reason this is even a question, without that network in place where else would a modder list their wares?  Ultimately I feel like if they want to create a paid content market for mods there needs to be some vetting processinvolved. Something to confirm the validity of the mods claims, also the quality and reliability of the mod. I mean in the past when a mod was buggy or half-assed, or didn't come anywhere near to doing what it claimed to do, you would roll your eyes and move on. Afterall it was a mod, created by amateurs and given away for free. But if I'm going to pay for a mod I expect to get my moneys worth. Its no longer a community affair and I expect professionalism in conduct and product, or at the very least some sort of recourse for refund should the product fail to meet claims, or worse cause damage in some other way."
ElderScrolls,33p8f7,_JO3Y,0,Sat Apr 25 08:12:16 2015 UTC,"Fucking mobile, I just type a couple paragraphs then it refreshed and deleted everything. Anyway, you're right. I didn't put a lot of thought into my first comment. Bethesda has a right to some profits, but the amount they get right now is too much. Both Valve and Bethesda have been paid when people bought the game originally. They should get some compensation, something like 25-40% to split seems more reasonable. But I don't think this systems going to hold up anyway. Too many mods are reliant on other modder's resources. If you download a follower, it's almost guaranteed that the hair, body, armor, weapons, animations, etc all came from different modders. Should only the person who uploads it get paid? If not how do you determine who gets what? What if on person doesn't want their mod to be sold, does the whole thing get taken down? And there are going to be other issues too. What if your mod recreates something from LOTR or WoW or something? Stuff like that probably didn't matter before, but now you, Valve and Bethesda would be profiting from copyrighted materials and that could cause some major issues. Like I said before, I'm not opposed to the modders, or even Valve and Bethesda getting money from this, but it should be distributed fairly and the whole system needs to be better thought out."
ElderScrolls,33p8f7,Dathadorne,0,Sat Apr 25 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"It's a distribution network. That's how it works. The modders can't get their product to their customers without using Steam's infrastructure. If they could, they'd use a competitor's infrastructure. Either way, Steam creates the marketplace in which trade is enabled."
ElderScrolls,33p8f7,_JO3Y,2,Fri Apr 24 21:49:50 2015 UTC,"I understand that hosting the content requires use of their network's resources; I didn't say steam should get nothing, just that them making 3 times what the actual mod authors are making is an unfair ratio."

The only work put into the creation of an individual mod was done by the mod author(s). Valve is allowing them to use their resources to distribute the mods, but most of these resources are already in place for them to sell games. The additional cost to them can't be enough to justify taking 75% of the revenue this generates, even if they are splitting it with Bethesda. Since every mod is based off of something created by Bethesda, I don't think it would be unfair for them to get some of the money, too. But they've already been paid by both the mod authors and everybody who downloads the mods. So, in my opinion both Bethesda and Valve are justified I'm taking some of the money this brings in. Just not 75%.  I think a more fair split would be something like 25-30% for Valve and Bethesda to split with the rest going to the modders. Even something like 60/40 would be more reasonable and still leave both companies with 20%. The fact of the matter is the comparison you made is inaccurate. I think a better one would be like someone selling something they made to someone online and having to pay UPS to ship it. The infrastructure to ship the package is already in place and in use. Adding your package to one of their trucks doesn't cost them much so the amount you pay for your product to get to its destination isn't that much. Certainly not 75% of the price you're charging."

ElderScrolls,33p8f7,Dathadorne,2,Sat Apr 25 07:21:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is mostly because Valve was the innovator and created the market, and thus is able to almost completely corner it. All of the examples you cited have serious competition, where customers can choose to use one of many services. For game distribution, as alternatives arrive on the scene (like Origin), modders (and game developers) will be able to pick and choose their distribution service, and Steam's cut will drop accordingly.  Right now, Valve invented the market, and they're getting the deserved initial revenues. Data centers cost billions of dollars, which has unfortunately lead to the 100MB file size limit. Hopefully, revenue from this marketplace will subsidize the data centers so that even the free mods can be hosted with larger files."
ElderScrolls,33p8f7,motrisvile,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:56:07 2015 UTC,That is not the case. Modders have no way to vote with their wallet. Sure Bethesda could find another market place that would give bethesda a larger cut. Hell they could do so tomorrow. But modders can only sell their work through a distributor of the developers choosing.   The future will not be any brighter for the modder once more competition is introduced. The modder's hands are tied to the developer.

(edit: and they only get that money if it reaches $100) A better solution might be a donate button on workshop pages. This will discourage people from giving their mods away for free. Despite there being plenty of free mods currently, subsequent games will see a reduced amount of free content, relegated only to idealistic modders who refuse to support the paywall. Valve says that users can try mods for 24 hours risk free, like a free sample, but the wording is weird and seems to imply that you actually purchase the mod and must actively seek a refund before your 24 hour period is up. This is fishy. what happens when people copy the mechanics of a paywall mod and distribute it for free? Or when people copy a free mod's content and sell it? DMCA takedowns and lawsuits? You know steam customer support won't be easy to get ahold of. seems that valve has removed the ability to downvote paid mods, therefore that is one less defense against shitty quick-cash junk mods or copied stuff. (update: seems they have removed access to the discussion pages on paid mods as well, though comments are still viewable) any ""refund"" you get (if you realize before your 24 hours is up that the mod is junk) does not actually go back to you - you just get it back in your steam wallet, not as a deposit on your credit card or bank account.   *(see nuggynugs comment below)  edit: interesting commentary in a nexus blog post: http://www.nexusmods.com/games/news/12444/?  edit2: some youtube commentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLwu61lzBI and several posts on /r/pcmasterrace: here and here and here and here  edit3: /r/gaming discussion here, and /r/games discussions here and here"

ElderScrolls,33moyo,Foolski,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:19:14 2015 UTC,I think the answer here is pretty obvious.  At least they're not removing the old unsupported mod from nexus (as far as I know).
ElderScrolls,33moyo,yngradthegiant,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:11:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is another question I had. How will nexus handle this? What if content creators want to pull their mods from Nexus so they can only be downloaded by paying through steam? I assume Nexus owns the rights to any mod hosted on their site, but Jesus Christ this is terrifying to think about."
ElderScrolls,33moyo,Foolski,3,Fri Apr 24 00:39:44 2015 UTC,Donations would be way better
ElderScrolls,33moyo,n60storm4,10,Fri Apr 24 08:34:19 2015 UTC,"To be honest, while I'm a huge fan of TES and Fallout, without mods they are pretty mediocre game play wise. Not to mention buggy and outdated. Mods are what keep the game going, if it wasn't for mods I'd have dropped skyrim a long time ago.  I'm not paying for these bullshit micro transactions, so it looks like I'm done with both TES and Fallout if all the mods require payment to use.  Probably won't be buying the next games either."
ElderScrolls,33moyo,HesThatGuy1986,9,Thu Apr 23 22:10:54 2015 UTC,"Talk about overreacting. It's only on the Steam Workshop for Skyrim at the moment and for only a few mods, also mod websites like the Nexus are still there. Wait and see what happens, it could go down the drain."
ElderScrolls,33moyo,RedShirt404,6,Thu Apr 23 22:34:52 2015 UTC,"Skyrim is old, New Vegas is older, fallout 3 came out when I was starting middle school, and I played oblivion in like 5th grade. I'm 20 now.  Mods are the only reason i still play those games. Mods are the only reason i bothered to play more than one or two playthroughs. There are better, newer games out that I could spend my money on, not some mod pack that costs more than the game itself while only offering 1/1000 the content. Nexus is still there, but will it still be there when the next games come out? Why spend a lot of time on thankless work when you could get paid? Not to mention all the other shitty things valve has slipped into this. This could be a huge blow to the modding community."
ElderScrolls,33moyo,Crk416,6,Thu Apr 23 22:48:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah it could be, it could destroy modding as we currently know it, but that's also the worst possible scenario.

ElderScrolls,33moyo,Crk416,6,Fri Apr 24 06:45:02 2015 UTC,I think that breaches Bethesda's policy on modding for their games.

ElderScrolls,33r5hj,OctagonalHumanist,2,Mon Apr 27 02:44:52 2015 UTC,"I would LOVE it if this was the case, but like Atmora, Akavir has mostly served as just a plot device (like the Oblivion Planes), rather than an individual setting of its own.

ElderScrolls,33r5hj,Contagious_Cure,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:49:10 2015 UTC,"Read ""Mysterious Akavir"". This is how much we will know about it. There is a lot of Tamriel to explore, and we won't leave it until we'll see it all."
ElderScrolls,33r5hj,TheStradivarius,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:54:19 2015 UTC,"Yes there is. Plenty to explore, however, Tamriel is essentially never ending.  Just like any real story. But what can they do that's ground breaking, what can they create that pushes the bar even higher? The mysterious Akavir covers just a pinch of the rest of the world. While they can do great things either way, Bethesda tends to create an entirely independent story yet maintain lore ties. The tribunal great houses played no role in oblivion. The oblivion crisis didn't have an effect on dragons coming back. So the thought many people say is they want a game about the Thalmor government, that's not how they have been doing it. If it stays in Tamriel I'm thinking some high rock or black marsh may be the destinations."
ElderScrolls,33r5hj,MarvelousMagikarp,1 point,Sat Apr 25 05:53:48 2015 UTC,"But the Great Houses don't really effect anything outside of Morrowind, and the Oblivion Crisis was over and done with.  The Thalmor's influence spreads across almost all of Tamriel, and they're still a very active, very real threat."
ElderScrolls,33r5hj,ForIAmTalon,1 point,Sat Apr 25 09:48:43 2015 UTC,"I'd like them to move away from Tamriel but not right now. They should however speed it up by doing multiple provenances in games. Such as Valenwood, Elsweyr and Summerset Isle (Thalmor War?) in one game. Then the game after that should take us to High Rock and Hammerfell (Return of the Snow Elves?) and finally Morrowind and Black Marsh (Return of Nerevarine?). After that the game should go to Pyandonea home of the Sea/Tropical Elves. Then we can explore Akavir."

ElderScrolls,33ngbi,Squidkidz,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:08:21 2015 UTC,"First off the intro is very boring. Then i have to get spells and perhaps some shouts. And of course i have to skill up for perks.   I remember reading for ""demon hunter"" build on a forum and it sounded like lots of fun (i still want to play that). Its just that getting to that stage is annoying. Especially magic for some reason takes time and i  end up using melee and restoration. Perhaps i need to just go a mage for the next playthrought."
ElderScrolls,33ngbi,Akrash,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:38:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think TES is for you. ""Getting there"" is pretty much what you'll be doing the whole game."
ElderScrolls,33ngbi,DilbertHigh,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:41:22 2015 UTC,"Its pretty fast in Skyrim. And i probably would have ""Got there"" this but by level 10 i fixed some ini settings that fucked up my game, so i had to delete my save files and game. But im not really hyped at making that same character again.   Once i got STEP and my accessory mods downloaded i will get to completing Skyrim at least. Then Morrowind perhaps and then Oblivion. I refuse to give up on it. I love playing the game. I usually just lose interest for a bit and then i have trouble getting hyped for my character again and make a new one. Probably had about 20 Skyrim characters and 30 Oblivion characters. My lack of love for the game is not what is stopping me.   I have all these mods for making a ranger character. So this time getting loot will be a bit special. And i got cool stuff for hunting such as traps etc.   I was just wondering if people had great tips just as backstory for character or doing a specific thing. I usually end up doing a lot of side quests. I guess i lose track easily."
ElderScrolls,33ngbi,Devonic96,3,Fri Apr 24 22:34:15 2015 UTC,The only times that I ended up not able to finish questlines in Morrowind at least were cause I got distracted by the expansions or by other questlines. In Skyrim my issue was sometimes simply the repetitiveness and lack of decent rewards. However I could usually make it through those as well.

ElderScrolls,33i0i3,Fiercedeity77,6,Wed Apr 22 18:02:13 2015 UTC,I think even if they give us Elsweyr or even Valenwood they will timejump the series far enough ahead again that they would both be very different places than what we would be expecting.  I can see centuries of Thalmor rule making both different in many way s from what has been told of them in the past.
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,kah43,2,Wed Apr 22 19:08:13 2015 UTC,"TLDR: I agree, that would be amazing!  That would be awesome. Like, instead of riding horses you can befriend the other breeds of Khajiit and use them as mounts? I think I read somewhere that the Aldmer overthrew the whole Mane leading the Khajiit or something but I could be mistaken. But if that was the case what if the character you play as is the next mane and you have to lead a resistance against the Aldmeri Dominion? You could start off knowing you are the next mane and the resistance could be grooming you (heh. Cat. Groom? Ugh.) and the game could begin with the Aldmer executing you only to be rescued by the resistance, keeping in line with the games always starting out as a prisoner theme. Unite the two kingdoms in Elsweyr, drive the Aldmer out, and then in the add-ons you take the fight to Valenwood? Just ideas but I personally think Elsweyr would be super cool and I don't even like the Khajiit that much. As for being able to select different breeds of Khajiit, again, awesome. I can't name them all off the top of my head but what if they only stuck with the three that are good at sneaking, fighting and magic giving your player the appropriate bonuses to their skills at CC? Desert nomads, fighting in trees, riding giant war cats into battle? I'm sold. OH! Just another random thought, they say not to eat any of the local food in Elsweyr because of the presence of moon sugar right? What if one of the plot elements is that for some reason or another moon sugar has lost its ""divinity"", making it basically just regular sugar? The elves could be behind something like that I guess but this could explain why a character that isn't a Khajiit isn't reduced to a moon sugar addict within being in the country for a more than a few days?Or maybe it doesn't affect you because regardless of race you're still the mane? Meh, I like the first one better. Anyway, now I'm heartbroken because although most of the people here seem to think Elsweyr would be great, odds are it won't happen. Probably going back to High Rock to stop the AD from destroying the Adamantine Tower or something. Don't get me wrong, Bretons are my favorite race, but damn it I want something new."
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,dyingenglish,2,Thu Apr 23 08:57:31 2015 UTC,"Considering that (iirc) up until now Bethesda has taken care to keep the scale of their worlds the same, Elsweyr alone may not be large enough, combining it with Valenwood might work though. Personally I could see a combined Hammerfell - Highrock map working very well, great variety there with mountains, forests, the Alik'r desert and of course the open ocean. The geographical size would be between Cyrodiil and Skyrim so it would work out nicely. Put some islands out there for the player to explore - you could even have the map extend to Yokunda and have some seriously interesting stuff happen. If the devs were feeling adventurous the map could extend southwards to the northern coast of the Summerset isles as well."
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,Mimwing,4,Thu Apr 23 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"I would love for it to be in Elsweyr, but I don't think we're going to get it. I remember browsing a thread yesterday and someone posted a comment from someone who was involved in the development of the game and he indicated that elder scrolls has always been about ""the fall of man to mer"" or something to that effect. Because of this, I don't think the beast races and their regions are going to get the love they deserve in a lot of fans eyes. :("
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,dclown50,8,Wed Apr 22 18:13:40 2015 UTC,"I may be remembering incorrectly, but I believe that it was Michael Kirkbride who said that. He is still a huge name in the creation of the game's lore, but is no longer affiliated with Bethesda. So don't lose hope just yet."
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,thesimplemachine,3,Wed Apr 22 18:23:36 2015 UTC,"Even if the fall of man to mer is the underlying theme, I still think there's a lot of story to be told from the perspective of one of the beast regions. I'm really hoping its elsweyr. Just for the scenery and because I love khajiits"
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,dclown50,2,Wed Apr 22 18:29:58 2015 UTC,"I've been hoping for a game in Elsweyr since I read the description of it in the Pocket Guide to the Empire. I really don't care all that much for Khajiit, but their culture is interesting enough. Really though it's the idea of exploring a desert with centuries old civilizations that have been buried and forgotten that draws me to it."
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,thesimplemachine,6,Wed Apr 22 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not sure how Bethesda would work in this ""fall of man to mer"" thing like it's something tying all the games together. As far as I can tell none of the games has had a common theme beyond ""RPGish sandbox in fantasy land"". If Bethesda does go with that theme it'd be another one of their retcons. Like adding dragons, getting rid of Cyrodiil's jungle, and resolving the ending of Daggerfall with the Deus Ex: Invisible War style Warp in the West.  If Bethesda has any reason to avoid Elsweyr, it'd be things like the exotic setting not having enough mainstream appeal. Or it being too weird to have in the character creation process a choice between four elf races, four man races, the Argonians, and like 13+ different kinds of cat people (either that or Bethesda drops the whole Khajiit subrace thing, making lore fans rage)."
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,notponies,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:59:20 2015 UTC,"Very true, I think a world filled with Arab-esque cat people would just seem too silly to have broad mainstream appeal."
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,ten_of_svvords,2,Wed Apr 22 22:32:32 2015 UTC,Has the series followed this so far? Cause if so I dont see how.
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,Sickle5,2,Wed Apr 22 23:26:22 2015 UTC,"Chances are the timeline will be sometime after Skyrim. If they do it close to it at all. And they will probably fill in the gap with their own lore just to override people's personal canon.  And there was just a post about how beast races are not likely to be the main focus. I didn't really see why but with so much of the lore centered around man and mer it's definitely a consideration. I honestly wouldn't mind any of the locations, save for repeating ones. The ""worst"" area they have left is probably Hammerfell and even that place sounds immensely interesting."
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,lepigpen,5,Wed Apr 22 18:16:36 2015 UTC,Hammerfell is pretty cool and I'd be happy with that. Part of the reason I want Elsweyr so much is that the Khajiit are probably the race we know the least about. We know plenty about all of the man races and most of the mer races. Also I think the thalmor should burn in oblivion so a game centered around destroying them would be great.  Edit: the bosmer are also the mer race we know the least about I'd say so this would be a great way to learn about them too
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,RedShirt404,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:40:21 2015 UTC,"I think if they do do a game centered around destroying the thalmor it would be based in the Summerset Isles or Valenwood or possibly both, but that's just my opinion."
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,Flying_pig2,2,Thu Apr 23 00:49:06 2015 UTC,...Which would give us a plot line very close in nature to morrowind (since it would have to follow the basis of being a undercover-ish spy sort of thing) but considering how the only other option would be making a skyrim civil-war-ish questline a main questline I think I would prefer the former.
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,awardments,-3,Thu Apr 23 03:45:56 2015 UTC,"Black Marsh is very much the worst, followed closely by the stupidly named cat province"

ElderScrolls,33i0i3,DilbertHigh,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:26:22 2015 UTC,"I guess some people are sick of the Thalmor, but I feel like it would be hard for the next game to not involve them. I also have an unhealthy hatred for them."
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,baronvonreddit1,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:05:23 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't they be able to put the Thalmor on the sidelines even more. Just make it be a background thing.
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,Contagious_Cure,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:31:57 2015 UTC,I somehow don't think we'll see the subraces of Kha'jiit in the game 'cause if you're going to include the battle-cat and such you'll have to let people play them. Not to mention explaining to people that aren't well acquainted with lore where all these things came from suddenly.
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,Fujum8,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:32:00 2015 UTC,"The third person talking might be a bit much for me to handle for a full game. Also I also don't see why the Khajit would care to drive out the Thalmor. If the Thalmor are ever toppled, it'll be from within."
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,yay855,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:56:24 2015 UTC,If khajiit can be overly different in shapes and sizes the personality might differ as well. I like to think of other khajiit types as more serious. The ones traveling through the other games being less so.
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,FlamingSnot93,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:04:30 2015 UTC,"Elsweyr is definitely a unique area; all food grown there is infused with an addictive substance, it has a desert and a jungle, and the local language's word for 'rules' means 'foolish concepts'."
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,Fujum8,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:41:02 2015 UTC,There is jungle in Elsweyr as well not just wasteland. None-the-less I still agree it would be a good game if the setting is there. Personally I hope for both valenwood and elsweyr so we can have some moon sugar and skooma smuggling missions over the border.
ElderScrolls,33i0i3,DivinePrince2,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:40:03 2015 UTC,Elsweyr are Thalmor sympathizers. At least they like the aldmeri dominion. It would be cool since then we might get the other side of the story. Elves being portrayed as evil in Oblivion and Skyrim.

ElderScrolls,33i0i3,Fazblood779,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"While Elsweyr would be cool and all, I am tired of Tamriel. I think the 6th should be in Akavir. More races for your faces. These old races are getting kind of stale, and the lore of Akavir has hardly been developed (or the rest of the world for that matter). Last I checked there were four native races mentioned in Akavir, and if they really want to max out customization i think new types of skills would be introduced, sort of an eastern medieval system of skills and weapons. This would be an extremely daring approach, but I think Tamriel's Story line needs to be fleshed out a little bit more. Besides, from a business standpoint it would be extremely smart, as many ESO fans wouldn't leave their game but would also purchase ES VI."

ElderScrolls,33egcu,tppadg893,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:48:45 2015 UTC,"Can someone provide a reference for where the ""Pelinal is a time traveling cyborg"" thing came from?  I'm curious."
ElderScrolls,33egcu,tppadg893,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:15:26 2015 UTC,"This link is to The Song of Pelinal a kind of biography for Pelinal Whitestrake and it mentions his hand was made of killing light and what else could that be but a laser, he was clad in armor from a future time, and he had no heart but a red rage shaped diamond, not necessarily a cyborg but it does make him seem cooler"
ElderScrolls,33egcu,tppadg893,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:49:30 2015 UTC,killing light   My character's left hand throws killing light all the time in the form of fireballs and lightning bolts.  Sounds like Pelinal just liked Destruction magic.
ElderScrolls,33egcu,thebeef24,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:51:51 2015 UTC,"Fireballs and lightning bolts are not made of light, but they emit light. If they meant fire or lightning they would've said so or at least something more specific than killing light, still could be destruction magic just not fireballs and lightning. Also remember that in the Elder scrolls lore there is no concrete set way something happens everyone's opinion on the lore is different and right at the same time.Also have you searched for more info on this subject on the teslore subreddit"
ElderScrolls,33egcu,tppadg893,3,Wed Apr 22 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"I went to /r/teslore for the first time earlier today.  I'm fairly certain that you have to be high as a kite before you're allowed to post there.  I can see the whole no-set-lore thing, I just tend to prefer a concrete basis for things, y'know?"
ElderScrolls,33egcu,notponies,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:23:45 2015 UTC,"You get to that level of loredom gradually. When I started I preferred topics like ""What was Ancient Nord society like?"" more than crazy questions about metaphysics. Eventually I got tired of being puzzled by those topics though and started reading. It's actually pretty neat.   Although I will say the one thing that always has to be said in TES: there is no concrete. Even if you're not into the ""no such thing as canon"" thing, remember that just like in the real world, your historical source can be wrong. Your author may have been writing about things that happened even before he or she lived, there might be social bias, there might be unfounded speculation. That's not a lore fanatic thing, that's ingrained in every Elder Scrolls game."
ElderScrolls,33egcu,tppadg893,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:35:50 2015 UTC,I also prefer a more set lore but like the flexibility as well; how you can explain your side and how you see it
ElderScrolls,33egcu,notponies,2,Wed Apr 22 20:51:41 2015 UTC,"Fireballs and lightning bolts are not made of light, but they emit light. If they meant fire or lightning they would've said so or at least something more specific than killing light   Light beams are hardly exclusive to science fictiony lasers though. And The Song of Pelinal is written in poetic language anyway so I wouldn't expect it to just outright say that Pelinal had the Flames spell equipped in his left hand.  Not trying to completely knock the idea of cyborg Pelinal, but as you said in one of your replies a lot of this is open to interpretation."
ElderScrolls,33egcu,tppadg893,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:34:41 2015 UTC,It doesn't have to say outright that he had a flames spell equipped but it can get more descriptive and poetic than a hand of killing light to describe him shooting fire or lightning from his hands . You could say His left hand blazed with a magical flame or His left hand crackled and sparked with energy.
ElderScrolls,33egcu,HurtsYourEgo,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:52:11 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. I'd say ""killing light"" does not suggest a laser any more than it does not not suggest a laser."

ElderScrolls,33egcu,notponies,10,Wed Apr 22 22:23:58 2015 UTC,"That was the idea - a militant order expressly devoted to the Nine and violently opposed to the Thalmor.  Possibly have the main character go about rebuilding it yet again, but stronger than ever."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,THETEH,41,Tue Apr 21 14:46:46 2015 UTC,After Oblivion's crisis and Skyrim's Civil War I'm burnt out on large scale conflicts. I'd rather a more subtle conflict like Morrowind's.
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,Akrash,18,Tue Apr 21 15:10:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly Skyrim and Oblivion would have been pretty boring without their respective war/oblivion invasion. Morrowind could be more subtle because the setting was unique so I would be intrigued by every encounter... like WTF is a netch or a nix hound or guar?  Bring on Black Marsh I say, we need another unique setting."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,Contagious_Cure,3,Tue Apr 21 22:57:58 2015 UTC,Spot on
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,Bulba_Core,8,Tue Apr 21 23:31:28 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'd much rather have a more succinct and focused story related to the culture of whichever province the next game will take place in. Large scale plot devices can be messy as far as keeping with continuity goes; especially if Bethesda has it fall by the wayside like the Civil War campaign in Skyrim.
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,russelcrowe,5,Tue Apr 21 21:45:33 2015 UTC,"It won't happen unless they literally resolve all the issues that have been leading up since morrowind off screen between games, which would be fucking stupid."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,theswerto,5,Tue Apr 21 21:47:52 2015 UTC,Y'know that TES VI doesn't have to be after Morrowind/ Oblivion/ Skyrim? There is plenty of room for a prequel and plenty of existing lore to focus a game on.
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,Akrash,3,Tue Apr 21 22:00:24 2015 UTC,I hate prequels. It takes me out of the time of the world and throws me around to different places.
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,DracoOculus,-5,Wed Apr 22 00:59:12 2015 UTC,So the only TES game you like is Arena?
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,FlamingSnot93,5,Wed Apr 22 03:09:00 2015 UTC,"You do know that every TES game except the spin-offs were after Arena, right?"
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,Vehkislove,7,Wed Apr 22 04:26:16 2015 UTC,Then it woudln't be TESVI. Up until now every ES game has been a sequel in the main series. Non numbered games have been prequels or midquils.
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,theswerto,-1,Tue Apr 21 22:02:11 2015 UTC,The games don't have to progress in chronological order just because of a tradition.
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,Akrash,14,Wed Apr 22 06:22:10 2015 UTC,"Someone just suggested having old imperial (or, from the empire) buildings as abandoned ruins. The idea of having ""modern"" ruins.. buildings that were used not hundreds of years ago, but 5 years ago, all inhabited by bandits or the like. In this scenario you could choose one of these ruins to make your castle and start out as you go alone slowly building it up to your specifications. As the game goes on you could have slowly changing battlefields based on the players actions.   Oh! You could have roving parties of soldiers instead of bandits, and the ""bandits"" might be more deserters. Symbolism could be super fun and well used."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,foxsable,11,Tue Apr 21 16:02:16 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of choosing your own ""base"" or home castle and working your way up from there. Would work well if you were taking part in a war as some sort of independent rogue."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,foxsable,8,Tue Apr 21 17:37:49 2015 UTC,"Ooh, that would be awesome!   I like the idea of Finding your own base rather than buying it. If you need to take gold out for it (for mechanics/balance reasons) just make the ""upgrades"" expensive. Or hard to find. Oh man.. how awesome would this be.   So check it. You have the choice between 5 different places: A ridge with an abandoned church of one of the nine on it, a swamp fort, a mine, a hunting lodge, or a small keep. There is no direction in game to go to these, other than mention in bars only near the location in surrounding towns and villages that you can go to. When you find them, you can ""claim them""(just for gameplay reasons). When you claim it, you find stuff inside that can be upgraded. For example, lets take the temple as the base.  So you climb this ridge and at the top overlooking the surrounding farming community you find this temple. It is sort of broken down. Out in front is a statue, but the statue has been defaced by a bunch of Elves who are camping at it's base, refugees from the war, perhaps deserters. So you defeat them and toss their bodies over the cliff, because fuck them. You [mouseover] the statue and get some descriptive (possibly floating) text that reveals the statue has been so far debased you can not tell which of the nine it was originally. So you move to the door, and find that it is locked with a strange key. It appears it would be hard to pick. But at the base is a bunch of pieces of paper (""Lost temple note"", ""likely hiding places""). If you look at them, one is a note describing the lock and the place in detail. The other is a map showing a few details the writer has searched in his quest for the key. An enterprising player can check out those locations to find the key. Once inside you discover various rooms, but to fix the place up, you are going to need certain parts. But various towns have certain parts. Like a town which has good carpenters might agree to make wooden doors for you, but you need a doorknobs made in other places. Doors will allow you to use those rooms more functionally. Things continue piece by piece. Eventually you can choose which of the divines you want to devote the temple to and can go on a quest to restore the statue."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,foxsable,2,Tue Apr 21 18:01:58 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I like that! It allows you to potentially sway things.. Convince various local lords (some of them no better than bandit lords) to join your cause.. or destroy them, possibly to replace them with some displaced group of your choosing."

ElderScrolls,33cxlv,PMMeYourBootyPics,8,Fri Apr 24 00:55:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if they made the game focused on a war with the Thalmor it would feel much more like a direct sequel than any of the other games so far have IMO."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,foxsable,6,Tue Apr 21 17:25:17 2015 UTC,"I think a game where there are two main questlines could work well in this situation. Like some kind of personal revenge (or something similar) storyline that parallels and intertwines with the other main war storyline. I think the supposed Hammerfell location could work for the war setting as well as shown in this post. Huge battles in some of the desert and mountain regions of Hammerfell where hundreds of NPCs battle and you can win or lose based on which quests you've done to prepare, how many people you kill in battle, maybe what level your army is if the game goes that in-depth. That could add a really cool dynamic to the game that is reminiscent of other fantasy games like Warhammer."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,HighFiveEm,2,Tue Apr 21 17:38:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that this would be an exciting new element to the game if you could influence large-scale battles in that way, even through influencing armies somehow (would be insane if you could work your way ""through the ranks"" and eventually influence the war effort on a huge scale, don't know if we'd see something like that but it would be awesome)."

ElderScrolls,33cxlv,DilbertHigh,4,Tue Apr 21 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"I would love TES VI to centre around an uprising type war against the Thalmor but from the PoV of the Aldmeri Dominion. Ideally I wish that the game could take place across the Summerset Isles, Elsweyr and Valenwood and for those who got a bit sick of war in Skyrim, you could choose early on whether you want to launch a full assault or a more sneaky, right from under their nose approach. I also like the idea that a questline could be choosing whether or not to ally the khajit and the bosmer."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,olddoubleratbling,2,Tue Apr 21 19:02:07 2015 UTC,"from the PoV of the Aldmeri Dominion.   I think they should take a page from skyrim and let you choose your side, stormcloaks/empire or aldmeri dominion."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,DilbertHigh,2,Tue Apr 21 17:59:14 2015 UTC,"Only if they made the choice meaningful and have there be a difference between the two options, not just have roughly identical questlines. Look at the 3 great houses in Morrowind, it actually made a difference which one you choose."

ElderScrolls,33cxlv,olddoubleratbling,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:19:30 2015 UTC,"Yes this is true. A bigger outcome than soldiers in different armor would've been nice, but maybe it was more of a set-up for another game, however unlikely."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,DilbertHigh,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:36:50 2015 UTC,I would be disappointed if it was a set up for another game. I like the games being related in lore but not directly connected by plot.
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,olddoubleratbling,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"Yes I do to, but I'm afraid I am to attached to the dragonborn aspect at this point. I'm not sure how they will play the next game out, they've kinda painted themselves into a corner. It would be very weird for them to add a game changing mechanic (shouting), like one that people base their entire characters off of and then, just remove it in the next game.   While I agree with this, I would also LOVE to play in the aldmeri war (either of them really), which maybe they'll make a game about the great wars."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,MarvelousMagikarp,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:51:48 2015 UTC,"I found shouting to be okay. It wasn't great but there was nothing wrong with it.

One that would be fun would be Black Marsh, because I would love to play as a Telvanni style Dunmer and put those N'wahs in their place."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,JuiceBySarah,2,Wed Apr 22 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"I really liked shouting, I thought it added a fourth fighting style. I totally agree it wouldn't make sense for two dragonborn games in a row, unless they made one with the same dragonborn. Skyrim was really a hit or miss for most people, for me it was almost perfect, I love the Nordic stuff more than any other lore, I really got into the acient dragon kind of thing and it almost felt like a ""last of a dying age"" type game with the dragonborn coming for the last(maybe?) time, and eternity being broken with the slaying of Alduin. I don't think people quite understand the significance of the killing of alduin, I would take dagon trying to invade anyday over, well, the world ending and beginning an infinite amount of times. I liked the aspect of how you don't know who the gods are rooting for, (because while Alduin would destroy the world, it WILL come back, and Alduin is the ""son"" of akatosh) because it almost makes it seem like you are more in control of your destiny. In oblvion you're just another jimmy that did something awesome, nothing special about you. Sorry for babbling"
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,SneakThief_,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:05:34 2015 UTC,"I agree that an uprising would be very cool. A guerrilla war somehow would feel very appropriate for TES and would I think maybe make use of more subtle mechanics compared to a ""huge battlefields"" type of game.  Three provinces would be spectacular. The chance to explore three cultures would be amazing and would be a cool chance for them to mix the familiar with the exotic and surreal.  I'd be surprised to be on the dominion's side, I've been expecting to either be fighting against the dominion or to be able to choose a side like in the civil war. Either way hopefully we'll be learning more about the motivations and perspective of the dominion."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,ImperatorTempus42,4,Wed Apr 22 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"I want it to feel like a war.  Skyrim's civil war didn't effect anything until you actually got involved in it.   In a hypothetical ESVI based on a second Great War (which is where I think we're heading), I'd like the world to feel like there's a conflict, and not just have some enemy camps scattered around doing nothing. Have the Dominion be besieging some cities and forts, and have the quests be more varied than simply ""Kill these guys, now we own it"". Espionage, Politics, etc.   I'm picturing a game set in Valenwood/Summerset Isles, a few centuries after Skyrim, with a rebuilt Empire and elven rebels facing off against the Aldmeri Dominion, while the Thalmor are nearing the final stages of their ""destroy the towers, unmake the world"" plot. There's a tower in Valenwood I believe, and I think it'd be cool to make it so the Thalmor have destroyed all the others, and have it be the last, final one standing between the Thalmor's ultimate goal. The Empire/Rebels have to protect it with everything they've got. Basically an all or nothing, ""if we lose, everyone dies"" deal."

Larger and battles that feel like an important event
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,Hi-rez,2,Tue Apr 21 23:37:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, so some centuries have passed, and the Dominion is ready to take the next big step in unmaking the universe.  They've been eroding people's belief in anything and everything, so to prevent the scheme you need to give people something, anything to believe in order to reinforce the [metaphysical babble] enough that the plan won't work.  To achieve this, you need to accumulate some number of, for lack of a better word, victory points.  Gaining levels, doing side quests, accumulating artifacts all may grant (or remove?) these points.  There's no obvious way to track the points until later in the game when the progress of the unmakers becomes obvious (say, a growing void in the sky, or something).  Then the stakes really get higher and you are amassing armies to fight the forces of unmaking, exploring the heavens and realms of oblivion to contact greater powers, and constructing enormous geomantic edifices.    The more (in)famous you are, and the more epic things you do, the more people/spirits/gods come to feel strongly about you/the world.  Whether it's love, hate, fear, avarice, whatever, you just need them to act in some way that makes the universe real and push back the nothing.  Then you ride Falcor out of the book and down the street chasing the bullies that had been harassing you IRL..."
ElderScrolls,33cxlv,TotesMessenger,1 point,Wed Apr 22 10:31:26 2015 UTC,Love this. Really captures how the stakes are a lot higher than who controls the provinces - it's the fate of everyone that's at risk. A game centered on that would be very gripping.

ElderScrolls,3390jj,SonicWage,38,Mon Apr 20 16:43:00 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go out on a weird one here but I'm actually going to suggest starting with Oblivion. Why? Well, Morrowind can be difficult to get into for people not used to older mechanics and text-based RPGs. You would likely appreciate it much more once playing the other games and getting invested in the lore. Skyrim, on the other hand, has a less interesting story, but is easily accessible. You  can play it, and enjoy the game, but I don't know if there is enough lore and story to the game to leave you wondering what happened in the earlier games.  I suggest Oblivion because it's reasonably accessible (the combat is relatively simple, it's fully-voiced) but it has some really good stories in it (Oblivion haters come at me). The main story might not be Morrowind standards of great, but the guilds are fantastic, some of the best in the series. And the sense of world and lore you get is enough to leave you wondering about the other provinces, especially with the diversity in Cyrodiil. From there, you can continue to Skyrim, where you'll be able to appreciate the graphical upgrade and the streamlined systems, or back to Morrowind, where you will be able to appreciate the deeper lore and sense of world building.  A lot of people I know who got really into Elder Scrolls either played Morrowind when they were younger (when it was more in line with games of its time), or started with Oblivion. The people I know who played Skyrim seemed to find it impossible to get into the earlier games. (Also a lot of the Morrowind fans I know aren't fans of the later games either). Oblivion offers a better starting ground, I think."
ElderScrolls,3390jj,gingerdeer,8,Mon Apr 20 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"You can start with any of them. They're all set in the same universe but they're each a separate story that's only vaguely related to the other games.   As for which game to start with, it depends. If you're new to RPGs or you're a big action gamer, Skyrim is a good place to start (but admittedly it makes going back to earlier games harder). If you're looking for a deeper role-playing experience (albeit an older one with clunkier combat and lots of behind-the-scenes dice rolls to check if your action was successful), Morrowind is an awesome starting point. It's my favorite entry in the series, anyways, and I find it's the deepest gameplay-wise and the one that feels the biggest (due to lack of instant fast-travel)(. If you're somewhere in the middle there (i.e. you want better action and some RPG elements), Oblivion is a good middleground.  If you really want to play Arena or Daggerfall, though, they're free on the Elder Scrolls website.  As for mods, I'd stick to graphics mods for your first playthrough (as long as you have a good PC) until you get a feel for the game. There are a ton of them for Skyrim and Oblivion and I wouldn't know what to recommend specifically but for Morrowind, MGSO is an easy way to get the game looking really pretty."
ElderScrolls,3390jj,noplzstop,3,Mon Apr 20 16:52:26 2015 UTC,"Alright I think I will stick to Skyrim,  and maybe play through Oblivion after! I am getting a GTX 960 but with only 2GB."
ElderScrolls,3390jj,THETEH,2,Mon Apr 20 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with the suggestion to start with Skyrim.  That's what I did last year and it pulled me in to the world and story, and got me interested in the older games.  I recently got Oblivion and have been very much enjoying it...lots of shared elements with Skyrim but a few elements that are more complicated.  Despite being an older game it looks pretty good apart from a few parts that feel outdated.  I've enjoyed it enough that I've started considering working back towards Morrowind, which I probably wouldn't have wanted to do if I was new to TES.  So yeah I think working backwards is a nice way to go."
ElderScrolls,3390jj,noplzstop,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:24:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, you'll be able to run the vanilla game on ultra easily and you should be able to run some of the more intensive graphics mods too, although you can find combinations of mods that'll bring any rig to it's knees so you always have to do some tweaking. There are plenty of good guides on it, but I'd try it vanilla first, at least as a reference point for performance and graphics."
ElderScrolls,3390jj,MrTimmannen,13,Mon Apr 20 17:03:12 2015 UTC,i wounldn't recomend starting at arena
ElderScrolls,3390jj,AnalLaser,3,Mon Apr 20 17:35:36 2015 UTC,I still cant get through the first dungeon
ElderScrolls,3390jj,MrTimmannen,2,Thu Apr 23 09:53:20 2015 UTC,I just ran and finally got to the portal. Walked around in the town for a cuple of minutes and quit
ElderScrolls,3390jj,qfl,3,Thu Apr 23 11:22:35 2015 UTC,"I'd strongly recommend against starting from the beginning (Arena or Daggerfall). You don't miss out on much of the lore by skipping them, but you do save yourself a lot of frustration. Daggerfall in particular has a huge number of game-breaking glitches (falling through dungeon walls, quests that have a small chance of corrupting your savefile, etc.), and if you commit to going through the series sequentially, you'll likely feel trapped in a grind long before you get to Morrowind. (You can come back for them if you're interested--I still fool around in Daggerfall from time to time--but don't sour yourself on the series when you encounter their flaws.)  Other than that, I think any of Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim are good starting points, so I'd personally probably just start with whichever one is cheapest/on sale at the moment. All of them have plenty to do, including plenty of fun side quests and plot lines to follow if your interest in the main line falters.  As far as mods go, I tend to avoid most of them out of laziness, and I still have a good time with these games. If you're annoyed by the idea of trying to optimize your level-up attribute bonuses in Morrowind and Oblivion like I was, there are decent mods out there for revamping the leveling system into a more passive/less grind-inducing format. Realistic Leveling for Oblivion, Madd Leveler for Morrowind, although there are plenty of others if those don't do it for you (other options for Morrowind here and for Oblivion here)."
ElderScrolls,3390jj,autowikiabot,2,Tue Apr 21 16:42:38 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Gaining levels of article  Character Level (from Elderscrolls wikia):       When a character increases any Minor or Major skill ten times a level is gained. This can be performed by using said skills, or retaining the services of a skill trainer. Any combination of these skills can be increased for a level-up, be it the same skill ten times, five skills two times, etc. A message to ""rest and meditate on what you've learned"" is received, and the character must sleep soundly in a bed, or deep in the wilderness far away from any settlements in order to receive the level-up interface. Waiting is not sufficient for this to occur. In the level-up interface, the character's attributes are displayed and can be increased. These frequently have multipliers, which are assigned based on the number of times an attribute's governing skills have been increased since the last level-up, up to a maximum of 5×. Minor, Major, and Miscellaneous skill increases contribute to the determination of the multipliers. Luck can never have a multiplier because it does not govern any skills. The character also gains Health with every level-up. It is increased by amount equal to ten percent of the character's Endurance, including any Endurance gained during the current level-up. Endurance bonuses from magical effects or enchantments are not considered. *  In Oblivion, a character gains a level after a total of 10 major skill increases, since they last gained a level. These increases can be spread across any number of these major skills. For example, increasing the Blade skill five times, the Block skill two times, and the Heavy Armor skill three times results in a total of ten skill increases. The character then receives a notice to meditate and rest (sleep), so that he or she may gain a level and distribute attribute points. If this meditation notice is accidentally overlooked, a moon with an arrow pointing up to the left appears next to the compass, indicating that a level up can occur. Level ups stack if they are not taken right away, causing the player to level up multiple times upon next sleeping.  Once five levels of one skill are reached, that skill cannot be leveled again, until a level up has occurred. A message in the upper left-hand corner displays when this happens. Red bars depict the progress of each skill level up and the over all character level progress. This character is about to level up. To optimize leveling, increase skills that match the class specialization chosen at character creation, that match the main attributes for that class, and that are major skills selected for that class. For example, Destruction, based on the Intelligence attribute, falls under the Magic specialization. So, a character, that choose intelligence as a main attribute, magic as a specialization, and Destruction as a major skill requires less casting experience to receive skill levels in Destruction, making leveling up easier. To be specific, only 45% of the base experience is required before skill advancement. Of the seven Combat, Magic, and Stealth skills chosen for a class, only 75% of the experience needed to level up is required. For the major skills chosen for the class, only 60% is needed. Skills not falling under the specializing, attributes, or major skills take the longest to level up because they, by logic, need the most experience. Some players prefer to use a reverse tactic, instead of choosing major skills that correspond with ones that will be used most often during game play, ones that are used least often are selected instead, so that better control of leveling up can be gained, allowing for creatures to be easier. The downside is that the loot is weaker and the player must increase cross-class skills in order to augment difficulty and improve item drops. The level up screen in Oblivion displays each attribute modifier. Only three can be selected per level up. When one skill has been leveled five times or more during one level progression, it is possible that certain attributes can be increased by five increments, which is the largest of the game. For example, casting Illusion spells and leveling that spell for the majority of one level allows Personality, Illusion's governing attribute, to be raised by +5. This works on a sliding scale. The more a specific skill is leveled per level, the more attribute points the character can add to that skills governing attribute, ranging from +1 (the least used skills) to +5 (the most used skills). Only three attributes can be increased per level up. Once all attributes are maxed out, no more levels can be gained. So gaining attribute modifiers of +5 may not be beneficial. Health increases by 10% of the Endurance attribute,(rounded down. From empirical data, it seems that this gain (the bonus 10%) is not retroactively calculated with future Endurance increases. However, increases in Endurance will retroactively add to your base health (2x Endurance). Magicka gain is identical, but is calculated by Intelligence, while Willpower governs the rate by which magicka regenerates in real time, unless otherwise impeded by outside skills and abilities such as by selecting The Atronach birthsign. In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, leveling functions much the same, except attributes and classes have been eradicated. Character level is determined solely on skill levels. No shortcuts or experience point discounts are awarded for having major skills or specializations since the class system no longer exists. These discounts are, instead, given by the Guardian Stones (discounted skills depending on a chosen stone - Thief, Warrior or Mage), the Lover Stone (which provides a lower discount than that of the three primary Guardian Stones but all skills are included) and by being Rested, Well Rested or having Lover's Comfort which gives a 5%, 10% and 15% bonus respectively. Additionally, instead of requiring rest, sleep, or meditation to increase character level, it occurs instantly. Simply follow the prompts on the screen, select which of the three statistics to raise (Stamina, Health, or Magicka), then allocate perks to whichever skill tree the player wishes to advance.

Hell, the story could be about the Redguards trying to build a Tower, and the Thalmor trying to stop them. That would be awesome.

The White-Gold Tower, Red Mountain  and Throat of the World are towers. These towers keep Tamriel anchored in place, which allows men to exist.   Now, that last part I'd need to dig up sources on, but as I recall, mer (elf and beast races) are made from aetherius as a form of aedra or daedra where men are not. Thus, if the towers fall and Tamriel merges back into Aetherius, men would die and mer would survive.   Like I said, that last part needs fact checking, but suffice it to say, the towers are important as the main plotline through all the games. See this link for a bit of background: http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Towers"

ElderScrolls,337zcx,Enlicx,2,Mon Apr 20 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I'm a bit fuzzy on those details, but I recall reading that men and mer are from different origins. Men being tied to Mundus and mer being tied to Aetherius like the Aedra. This ties into Mundus being a daedric plane that was ""stolen"" from Mehrunes Dagon, IIRC.   Either way, I can very well be wrong, but I swear I saw lore cited that said men would die while mer would basically return to their immortal status by merging with Aetherius, which is why the Altmer (Thalmor) are trying to stir shit up. They want to destroy the towers (Throat of the World under the guise of a civil war they made possible) so they can return Mundus to Aetherius and become immortals again."

Their opinions on the AD, parts of the AD outside of the Thalmor.  But my real reasons for thinking of Valenwood is that there is a Tower we haven't seen there, the Green-Sap Tower. I do believe it is the only Tower we have not yet seen in game that still stands, as both the Orichalc and Crystal-Like-Law were destroyed. Well, disregarding any Khajiiti Tower (some say the Mane, some say the whole race).  The graht-oak city of Falinesti also conveniently stopped moving towards the end of the third era, making the issue of having moving cities, well, a non-issue. The reason it stopped moving would make an intriguing plot point.  Plus, I think it'd be an awesome setting, and a refreshing change from the cold bleakness of Skyrim."

ElderScrolls,337zcx,TheGnudist,2,Mon Apr 20 20:02:48 2015 UTC,"First, I'd like to make a correction - the correct phrase is ""fall of man to mer"".  From my understanding, it's basically that the Thalmor desire to return mer to immortality, but to do so requires removal of - at the very least - all but the last of the Towers, thus causing Nirn to re-merge with Aetherius. However, as the towers function as a sort of reality anchor, their deactivation would also result in the erasure of man.  To deactivate a tower, its Stone has to be destroyed or removed, i.e. the Heart of Lorkhan in ""Morrowind"", or the Amulet of Kings' destruction in ""Oblivion"".  Of course, I'm not too up on the lore, so I may have gotten some of this wrong, so if someone who knows more than I could follow up on this I would definitely appreciate it."

There are no clear hints as there were at the end of Bloodmoon, but unless the story skips forward a few hundred years I think Hammerfell is a safe-bet.

The lore behind Black Marsh creates a few difficult things in terms of translating to game play which could either be annoying or extremely fun, atmospheric and challenging. If they make traversing the poisonous and deadly Black Marsh challenging rather than frustrating, then IMO they would have succeeded. That's what I mean by doing it right. In comparison to say Oblivion or High Rock, where they would not only need to create solid gameplay, they would also need to add something extra to make the setting interesting since its so generic lore-wise. Argonia/Black Marsh is already an interesting setting on its own, all they need is to translate it smoothly game play wise."

ElderScrolls,337zcx,FlamingSnot93,2,Wed Apr 22 23:06:05 2015 UTC,"Daggerfall had half of Hammerfall explorable. So, it violates your rule #1 partly.  Also, there was a TES (non-main series, though) game that was set on an island off the coast of Hammerfall (Stros Mkai?). The game was named Redguard.  I've always thought that 6 would be in Elsweyr. No real reason in particular. But I guess that isn't happening, due to point 2."
ElderScrolls,337zcx,TheStradivarius,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:41:14 2015 UTC,I'd much prefer Valenwood in my opinion. I feel like it would offer a bit more.
ElderScrolls,337zcx,TheStradivarius,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:55:38 2015 UTC,I think you have a couple good points here expect that Hammerfell was in Daggerfall. I still agree that it could be Hammerfell because if they are looking to replace the dragon shouts mechanic (not that they need to but if they want to) there could be a sword singer mechanic since they have some lore about magically good swordsmen.
ElderScrolls,337zcx,TheStradivarius,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:50:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, MK has some knowledge but he is no one in terms of decision making. He doesn't decide anything. His ""there will never be TES in a beast province"" is meaningless because it is not his decision. Landfall is basically glorified fanfic, it will never be made into a game. Bethesda will never end their most known and money-bringing series because of MK's fanfic. You've missed High Rock, which in my opinion is very high on list of possible locations for the next game."
ElderScrolls,337zcx,Acer132,2,Tue Apr 21 13:06:56 2015 UTC,The point I was making is that the series was already written at time when MK was working there. The story for each game is roughly painted. And these guys have known what TES6 was going to be for a long time. Descision making is irrelevant. He knows because they've known for ages.
ElderScrolls,337zcx,TheStradivarius,0,Thu Apr 23 19:01:32 2015 UTC,"And your source for that claim?  And even if that was true, ideas change, decisions change."

ElderScrolls,337zcx,NDWolfwood5268,-4,Mon Apr 20 18:20:05 2015 UTC,"Then you cannot say that they have every game planned. Elder Scrolls game are standalone games, there is no big overarching story that would link them (Tower lore is an obscure background piece that may or may not be true) so they don't have to plan everything, just the game they are currently working on.   Sure, they probably are gathering ideas what they could do maybe in the next installment, but I don't believe in some grand plan."
ElderScrolls,337zcx,NDWolfwood5268,2,Mon Apr 20 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"Tower lore may or may not be true   You haven't played ESO, have you? That game has tower lore all over it."
ElderScrolls,337zcx,Contagious_Cure,-3,Tue Apr 21 08:53:12 2015 UTC,And none of it makes MK's fanfic about Thalmor winning true.
ElderScrolls,337zcx,NDWolfwood5268,-2,Tue Apr 21 09:47:48 2015 UTC,Lots of lore in ESO isn't considered cannon because it is just another spin off series. That is like taking everything from Battlespire and saying it meant something to the actual lore.
ElderScrolls,337zcx,TheStradivarius,-4,Tue Apr 21 11:29:47 2015 UTC,"They have Fallout and a ton of creative folks.

A ""big bang"" type finale would be nice."
ElderScrolls,337zcx,ahmedo993,4,Tue Apr 21 11:30:56 2015 UTC,Why the hell would they drop the series that makes the most money
ElderScrolls,337zcx,TheStradivarius,-7,Thu Apr 23 18:45:03 2015 UTC,"Because times change? Think of how many series have come and gone over the years. Elder Scrolls is no different, it just operates on a different timescale. Rather than being obsolete and repetitive in 10 years, it may take 50 because of the rich world they have, but eventually the numbers will say it'd be more profitable to move on to a new IP but carry over the Elder Scrolls experience. Aka, Skyrim gameplay set in a a modern world, or a sci-fi setting.   Nothing lasts forever and eventually, when the next big IP from Bethesda starts outselling TES, we'll see them closeup the series."
ElderScrolls,337zcx,Contagious_Cure,0,Mon Apr 20 17:57:26 2015 UTC,"Lol why are we talking about 50 years down the track?

ElderScrolls,337zcx,Mr_Mimiseku,5,Mon Apr 20 19:47:44 2015 UTC,"I don't see it. They'll only drop TES if it stops bringing cash. Otherwise, it would be a stupid decision.

ElderScrolls,337zcx,Contagious_Cure,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:16:51 2015 UTC,I doubt a game will completely take place in Akavir ever.

ElderScrolls,337zcx,TheStradivarius,2,Mon Apr 20 17:32:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's less about ambition and more about mass appeal. The elven provinces (or even more so, the beast provinces) are a bit too alien for the average casual fan. Skyrim has been the most successful game in the series so far, because it's so approachable. Is it the best in the series? I would say no, but Bethesda is a company, they care about what sells, not what's good."
ElderScrolls,337zcx,Contagious_Cure,3,Wed Apr 22 23:08:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think the success of Skyrim has anything to do with the fact that it's setting is approachable. Each series is selling better than the last because the series is becoming more well known, open world is becoming more popular and because the core gameplay is becoming more streamlined for the mainstream crowd (which I'm fine with provided they keep the game moddable for those who want the more complex aspects of the game).  When Oblivion came out a lot of people didn't think the next game would be in Skyrim because ""who would want to play in a world that was all snow? That would be boring"". People are now saying the same about Elsweyr and to a lesser degree Hammerfell, only its now ""the desert would be too boring""."
ElderScrolls,337zcx,Drake55645,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:58:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think approachability of setting was a major factor, to be honest.  Oblivion was about as ""default fantasy"" as you're ever gonna get in TES, and Skyrim still destroyed it.  Skyrim was just a overall bigger budget game, with a lot more hype around it's release."

The Relics are still out there, waiting for a new Crusader to take them up and have an honest religious discussion with the Thalmor.  But seriously, what kind of crap ending is that?

It is the largest region of the continent, and most is endless jungle.   This is how a Morrowind's book that goes by the title of ""Provinces of Tamriel"" describes Cyrodiil.  On following titles we find out that Cyrodiil is actually pretty different from what we were used to hear. Developers explained this change saying that Talos, also known as Tiber Septim, reshaped the entire province with his godly powers (CHIM) in order to make it more suitable as capital of his realm for their new rulers.  However on The Elder Scrolls Online it was explained by saying that Provinces of Tamriel's author commited a ""transcription error"" while writting (""The Heartland of Cyrodiil"" by Phrastus of Elinhir). But also several renown writters make their own suppositions and speculations on their works (""Subtropical Cyrodiil: A Speculation"" by Lady Cinnabar).  So as you might see there is no truth when talking about this. You believe what you want to believe."
ElderScrolls,3343tt,hyperchaud,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:01:54 2015 UTC,"It could be possible that the change in Cyrodiil's climate from subtropical to temperate could be of more mundane origin, i.e., just part of a larger climate change on Nirn. Kodlak in Skyrim references the ""days of the distant green summers"" in Atmora, implying that the ancient homeland of the Nedes was also once warmer and capable of supporting agriculture. Atmora is now polar and inhospitable, though once was probably more like Skyrim itself. Cyrodiil's own gradual cooling could just be a delayed effect of whatever caused this little ""ice age"" on Nirn."
ElderScrolls,3343tt,Franco_Andres,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:39:47 2015 UTC,"There is some people that thinks that Atmore isn't literally frozen but frozen in time. This was referenced by Michael Kirkbride, former worker at Bethesda and one of the greatest contributors to The Elder Scrolls game series lore. You can find discussion on the matter here, here and here at /r/teslore.  However, this doesn't mean Atmora is frozen in time neither it means it has been turned into a Tamrielic version of Antartica. As I said one makes it's own 'canon' and believes what he wants to believe when talking about The Elder Scrolls.   t could be possible that the change in Cyrodiil's climate from subtropical to temperate could be of more mundane origin, i.e., just part of a larger climate change on Nirn.   You want to think Cyrodiil's and Atmora's climate changed because of a large climate change on the entire Nirn? You're welcomed! Go ahead! I like to make suppositions and read them as well.  Going back to the term of 'frozen in time Atmora' it could mean that it's original inhabitants were very isolationist, close minded and primitive thus being 'frozen in time'. They were always fighting each other no matter what and didn't bothered to change this behaviour they carry with them since ages.  And so subsequently groups of Atmorans refugees ravaged by the war and tired of the traditional warmongering lifestyle decided to flee their native continent to find another home to start all over again without comitting the same mistakes their people did."
ElderScrolls,3343tt,ginja_ninja,2,Sun Apr 19 23:31:59 2015 UTC,"Cyrodiil has 3 major climes: the lush Nibenay of the southeast, the more temperate and dry Colovia of the west, and the snowy northern Bruma region.  When Oblivion came out people were dissatisfied that the whole province wasn't a jungle like some blurbs in the other games had described it as, so MK released a new little blurb attempting to retcon it so Talos used magical plot-induced CHIM to change the landscape.  However, if you view the area around Leyawin and east of the Niben River, around the same latitude as Elsweyr and Black Marsh, it still definitely is a jungle-like environment. Here are some screenshots I took a while ago as proof.  So really there never actually needed to be a retcon, people were just only spending a lot of time in the northern and western parts of Cyrodiil when they played Oblivion and failed to remember that there still totally was a jungle region. Due to the number of climate zones it occupies Cyrodiil has ended up as arguably the most diverse region of Tamriel."

I imagine southeast Cyrodiil as comparable to those areas - technically not tropical, but still sweltering, bug-infested and humid in the spring, summer, and early fall.  Also, they're stunning in person.  And filled with alligators, which Oblivion really should have had."

ElderScrolls,333yey,Franco_Andres,2,Wed Apr 22 08:42:02 2015 UTC,Daggerfall was by far one of my favorites together with Redguard and Morrowind. You were asked by Uriel Septim VII to do a favor for him as a friend and as Emperor he tasks you to serve him but you could actually decide between helping him or not. There were several endings if I recall right and lore-wise they all happened at the same time causing a 'Dragon Break' which is actually known as 'The Warp in the West'.
ElderScrolls,333yey,DaedeM,4,Sun Apr 19 20:10:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't even realize that Morrowind had a main story the first two months I played it. I actually sold the beginning packages."
ElderScrolls,333yey,redditsuckmyballs,19,Sun Apr 19 19:25:22 2015 UTC,"I think more importantly it needs to feel alive. Oblivion and Skyrim felt bare and empty.   But if you want foreign, it'd have to be Elsweyr, Valenwood, or maybe Black Marsh. But Black Marsh probably won't work (the Hist have made sure non-Argonians don't want to be in Black Marsh), and the moving trees of Valenwood maybe a tad difficult (definitely if they keep releasing on consoles). So my bet for an alien location would be Elsweyr.  Personally I want it to be in High Rock, and have the story revolve around the Redguards and their allies crushing the Thalmor. I really don't want to find out about the end of the Aldmeri Dominion through backstory (unless they did an amazing job showing the results of the conflict in the world)."
ElderScrolls,333yey,SonsofAnarchy113,18,Sun Apr 19 09:06:17 2015 UTC,"Skyrim felt... bare? Really. The huge forests, the waterfalls and rivers, the mountains, wildlife everywhere, you can hunt, harvest, lose yourself off the beaten path.   Bare indeed."

I haven't played Skyrim for a few years and forget that the Ai's move and everything Edit: ignore that, thought you were talking about a different post of mine.  They really are two totally different games. One was focused on the lore and the ways each faction interacted, and Skyrim was about a big beautiful environment. I compare Morrowind to an old book that's slightly outdated but is still a great story. You can get to know the characters and feel attached to them. And Skyrim is a beautiful painting that you can lose yourself in for hours, admiring each and every detail, but you don't have any attachment to the individual portions of the painting, just a feeling for the overall painting.  In my mind, they'll nail it with the next one."

ElderScrolls,333yey,LandOfGreenGinger,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:14:24 2015 UTC,I thought that it was almost the opposite for both games. There's so many caves and landmarks that it makes the whole world feel so tiny. I'd actually be fine if TES6 had the same amount of landmarks as Skyrim but they just spaced everything out more and made transportation more interesting and complete.
ElderScrolls,333yey,RHPR07,3,Tue Apr 21 04:46:41 2015 UTC,"It'll be interesting that's for sure.  Skyrim was popular partly due the fact that almost anyone could play it, you didn't have to be good at RPGs to complete the game.  There was a definite 'dumbing down' of traditional RPG elements from Morrowind to Oblivion to Skyrim, and I think the trend will continue. The next ES will appeal to as wide an audience as possible.  Things like The Hobbit and Game of Thrones make a lot of money, I wouldn't be surprised if Bethesda stick to easily accessible fantasy such as these.  Whatever they do, it'll be great, Bethesda make great games."

Yeah, the mainquest was rushed and uninteresting, with few natural breaks, but it was a game that was alive.  I have played all of the last three titles, and there is next to nothing I truly miss from Oblivion and Morrowind. Skyrim is my favorite game because it was most the immersive one of them all.

The idea of a poisonous marsh with deadly creatures and insects appeals to me. It should be enterable by non-Argonians by equiping items with poison resist and spells. Seriously if I have to wear a radioactive suit in Fallout in some sections, Bethesda can make people cast a poison resist spell or item for Black Marsh.  Make Eastern Black Marsh (towards the Cyrodill border) more generic for those who MUST have a generic medieval European feel just like they did with the southern section of Skyrim (seriously Whiterun warmer than Bruma?

There's only a handful of provinces left with an active Tower. Valenwood (Green-Sap), Elsweyr (the Khajiit themselves? hard to say), Black Marsh (the Hist), and High Rock (Direnni Tower). But we've been to High Rock and I find it doubtful we'll go to Black Marsh, given that it's never been thoroughly colonized by anyone but the Argonians.  There's no Tower in Hammerfell, but Kirkbride has dropped some hints - or things that I've construed as hints. And before we get into the age-old argument over MK's canonality: whatever stance one takes, he wrote quite a bit for both Oblivion and Skyrim, and there were hints in Oblivion that Skyrim was the next game."

They could also have their own culture with culinary arts and export that too. I bet some Nobles would pay a lot for some Imp Meat just because it's so ""rare"". That Settlement could be Ferengi of Oblivion with whatever people be it Dwemer, Ayleid, Tamriel Citizens or all of the above. If there's Dwemer in there, I would like to see a quest where Yagrum Bagarn can be re-united with his people. T_T  I think this is a good idea for a non-cannon lore friendly mod, but I think it might make the player OP as far as money goes if they export goods. :P"

ElderScrolls,32uqu3,mPORTZER,7,Thu Apr 16 22:09:33 2015 UTC,"I think that'd be an awesome feature and very do-able, I believe the Baldur's Gate games had a feature like that from the first to the second game where you could import your final save file from the first game.  I forget exactly how it affected the game though."
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,Squidkidz,4,Thu Apr 16 22:45:14 2015 UTC,"While its a very nice idea, the depth of TES lore doesn't really allow for it. Without even getting metaphysical, you can't really have 2 possible outcomes lead to the same end result easily; ex the outcome of the civil war. Then again is not really relevant who wins or loses to the Thalmor, only that in the end both sides have less soldiers.  As for a statue of your own character, its much more likely that the LDB would go off and do his/her own thing, much like how the Nevarine went and traveled, and the COC faded into obscurity or mantled Seogorath. No one would really truly remember who you were, only what you did."
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,ianjb,5,Fri Apr 17 06:43:33 2015 UTC,"Both sides won, killing Alduin caused a dragon break."
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,AasianApina,1 point,Fri Apr 17 07:43:30 2015 UTC,Another dragon break? Is that what Bethesda said? I thought they officially declared the rebellion winners at the end of skyrim.
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,thinkpadius,4,Fri Apr 17 13:23:57 2015 UTC,They didn't say anything and won't say until TES VI.
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,TheStradivarius,5,Fri Apr 17 14:22:45 2015 UTC,"It makes sense. But I don't really feel like they are too concerned about how you fit into lore. I mean, how many times do I have to save the entire world to get a little recognition from people?   Is there a mod that turns nearly the entire world into a crazy fan after the main storyline?"
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,jeebidy,3,Fri Apr 17 14:14:15 2015 UTC,This could work for small details. But ultimately it needs to arranged so that the same outcome comes from either ending of a main quest or its too much work to make the next game.
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,ducksaws,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:20:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unless if they were willing to commit to the possibility of multiple endings with consequences in the next game I think you're right that major quests will all leave the world in the same overall state. Still it would be exciting if they actually made it so that major multi-game world altering consequences would come from player choices, but probably isn't feasible."
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,Earfdoit,5,Fri Apr 17 21:14:07 2015 UTC,"I don't want that.  The hero of TES has always been anonymous and it's one of the great things about it, in my opinion."
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,stormRed1236,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:47:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a fair point.

ElderScrolls,32uqu3,DaedeM,2,Fri Apr 17 13:27:01 2015 UTC,"The idea wasn't to have it be the same character in every game but instead to have your character's name, attributes, race etc actually mentioned in in-game mythology in subsequent games. Like in in-game books, statues, etc."
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,DaedeM,2,Fri Apr 17 21:15:38 2015 UTC,He's saying that most people create the same character in every game. No way it's a coincidence that my Redguard just happens to be the same in every way compared to the statue in the town square

ElderScrolls,32uqu3,Akrash,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:36:57 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't work with the attribute/skill changes Bethesda do between games. How would you reconcile your Oblivion character having stats, and then loading it into Skyrim where there are no stats. TES isn't like Mass Effect, for example, where there's a consistent narrative between games."
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,RyanMill344,1 point,Sun Apr 19 09:09:40 2015 UTC,"There isn't a consistent narrative but there is a consistent world. Again I'm not saying you'd actually play as the same character. But your old characters would be worked in to the ""lore"" through some simple ""fill in the blanks"" system.  Like you'd read a book about the oblivion crisis in skyrim and the book would mention your oblivion character by name as the hero of the crisis. Things like that. And if your oblivion character was an archer the book would say ""the elf archer named..."" Fair enough that maybe it would be hard to figure out how to detect those things from one game to another.  I agree that in tes there isn't one consistent storyline but on a larger scale each game is part of the universe's history and each player character has a huge impact on that history."
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,TotesMessenger,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:09:07 2015 UTC,"But even then, there is a huge time gap between the games. It wouldn't make much sense for any of the races of men to persist between games over such large time spans. And even Elves would have aged noticeably.  I just don't think it works with the gameplay, or the lore. It's a great idea for series that can make it work, again I mention Mass Effect and also Dragon Age."
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,ginja_ninja,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:41:35 2015 UTC,"I agree there's a huge time gap, the character would have become a legend/historical figure and probably wouldn't be alive in the next game, just mentioned. I agree that without more branching endings there wouldn't be a huge impact, just might be cool."
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,SquidApocalypse,2,Sun Apr 19 13:53:41 2015 UTC,id also like to add BattleSpire was meant to be an expansion originally for daggerfall but the  they dropped that and wanted save imports. but that was dropped too as much of the stats wouldnt transfer over.
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,Dustygusher,2,Fri Apr 17 12:22:56 2015 UTC,Sounds cool but it would take a lot of time and effort to implement compared to the amount of people that will actually notice it. Unless Bethesda do a direct sequel (Skyrim 2 or something) then I don't see it happening. I feel this would work particularly well with fallout New Vegas because it has so many ending variations and many pivotal moments in the story depend on the player's chosen factions.
ElderScrolls,32uqu3,capkato,2,Fri Apr 17 14:46:46 2015 UTC,"I'd rather not. One of the things I like about the Elder Scrolls series is that nothing you do outside of the main quests of the base game and the expansions is canon, nor is it widely known within the universe."

ElderScrolls,32uqu3,Akrash,1 point,Tue Apr 21 06:48:11 2015 UTC,"I had a similar idea a while ago of including an option to import your Skyrim character to be able to have the Dragonborn continue to play an actual role in the story. Have them as a follower NPC with shouts, include multiple voice actor options like they do for the protagonist in Saint's Row, etc.  Unfortunately, consoles prevent this from ever having even the slightest possibility of happening. The generational gap means it'd only be viable to import character/game data on PC.  ...fucking consoles..."

And, true to form, Dagoth Ur is my favorite character thus far.   EDIT:  Oh, and Karliah. I hate that bitch too! Though not because she was written as well as Vivec, but the opposite; easily an example of some of the worst writing in Skyrim. She requires you sell your soul to Nocturnal in order to harness the powers of a Nightingale in order to beat Mercer in a fight, only she leaves out the fact that you can't harness the powers of a Nightingale until the Skeleton Key is returned to the Twighlight Sepulcher. So, you sell your soul to Nocturnal for no reason, defeat Mercer without harnessing the powers of a Nightingale, and then return the Skeleton Key. God damnit, Karliah.

I was also a big fan of Ralof in general, I like how he is a consistently re-appearing character that you can really connect with as he's with you right from the beginning.  That is if you go the Stormcloak route, I think your buddy's name is Hadvar if you go Imperial.  As far as characters that are kinda bastards, I liked Ancano from the College of Winterhold storyline, he kinda epitomized why a lot of people in Skyrim disliked the Thalmor."

ElderScrolls,32q1ou,Blunderbar,9,Thu Apr 16 14:15:10 2015 UTC,The elder scrolls series has dramatically shifted towards mainstream gimpdom since Morrowind.
ElderScrolls,32q1ou,comkiller,4,Thu Apr 16 16:48:14 2015 UTC,"Because its not like 90% of the stuff they ""gimped"" wasn't completely and utterly broken to begin with in this series that has had little to no consistency in game play and mechanics from Arena to Daggerfall  to Morrowind to Oblivion to Skyrim. It's not like they tore out a bunch of features from Daggerfall when they made Morrowind  or anything like that."
ElderScrolls,32q1ou,tobascodagama,15,Thu Apr 16 17:53:43 2015 UTC,Basically zero. The marketing benefits (especially for word-of-mouth) of a cross-platform release are too good to pass up.
ElderScrolls,32q1ou,andriask,15,Wed Apr 15 22:42:56 2015 UTC,No chance at all. Consoles is where the money is.
ElderScrolls,32q1ou,litewo,13,Thu Apr 16 03:13:24 2015 UTC,"That article is pretty bad, to be honest, and many of the writer's points are highly misleading or just plain wrong. I'm not sure how the author thought those screenshots were in any way a fair comparison. He's comparing two games made for their respective systems and released years apart with a cross-generational game. Also, the argument that the PS3 was able to grow because it was super powerful while the weak PS4 is already maxed out doesn't hold up to scrutiny. The ""specific number-crunching areas"" that the CELL processor excels at aren't the same as real-world gaming performance, where the CELL turned out to be a significant liability. Every generation, some developer says they ""maxed"" out the console after a year, and it ends up sounding quaint as the platform become more optimized.   Will the next Elder Scrolls be toned down because of the consoles? Of course. But it's more likely that this will affect the PC version as they strive for parity across all platforms."
ElderScrolls,32q1ou,Contagious_Cure,5,Thu Apr 16 03:45:20 2015 UTC,"0% chance.  But as long as they keep the game moddable, it won't make a difference."

ElderScrolls,32q1ou,Faerillis,2,Fri Apr 17 18:20:15 2015 UTC,It's different for MMOs.
ElderScrolls,32q1ou,Contagious_Cure,2,Sat Apr 18 02:12:32 2015 UTC,eso is a financial failure   I have no idea where people keep getting this idea from. ESO is estimated to have covered its development cost within the first 6 months of its release. The fact that it's gone from a subscription based MMO to a pay-to-play format isn't an indication of its financial performance but rather just a reflection of the current MMO trend. In fact many games that went from subscription to P2P or F2P report higher earnings.
ElderScrolls,32q1ou,andeleidun,2,Sat Apr 18 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"I want to clarify here, ESO went B2P because of the Xbox specifically. Zenimax could have kept it as a subscription, but Microsoft wouldn't let them bill the Xbox players. So, instead of not releasing on the Xbox, it got shifted to B2P. Anyone telling you otherwise hasn't seen the numbers and obviously doesn't pay attention to press releases."
ElderScrolls,32q1ou,eat-KFC-all-day,-1,Sun Apr 19 02:12:39 2015 UTC,"ESO was a finacial failure the moment they announced a paywall and a monthly subscription. Why do you think they got rid of the subscription? Also, ESO is an MMO, and as much as people like to think so, MMOs are not that popular on console (in comparison to PC). Skyrim was extremely popular on both console and PC, and it was one of the top selling games of 2011 (it actually continued to be sold extensively years after too). Thus, selling the next TES on PC first would offend their giant console fanbase."
ElderScrolls,32q1ou,Franco_Andres,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:18:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Unfortunately I know The Elder Scrolls game series for having it's titles severely dumbed down before release mainly because of consoles and to have their games able to run at low-end computers. Just look at the presentations and samples of several instalments before release and you'll know immediatly.   IIRC Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim were all released at the same time across all three consoles, Xbox, PS, and PC (maybe not Morrowind)   Morrowind was launched for both Xbox and PC."
ElderScrolls,32nwhm,karee,47,Wed Apr 15 08:12:28 2015 UTC,"You don't need to look into what is fun about Elder Scrolls specifically, but games in general. There are lots of documentaries out there that can help you understand.   But in short: Games are stories and experiences. It's like playing pretend when you were a kid: You could be anyone you wanted and for a moment live in that fantasy world and forget about the outside world. It's both a stimulant and a relaxation. Netflix binges for me are usually just to relax, and they are more likely to make me tired. Videogames often give me energy and charge my creativity and mood for the rest of the day.   This 'escaping to another world' does not mean that there is something to escape from in the first place, however. It's just a way of charging your battery and having fun, like most hobbies and sports are.   Also, most videogames provide clear goals. These goals are (in good games like the Elder Scrolls) perfectly balanced between difficult and fun. This means it gives players pleasure in succeeding in a goal, because it was hard enough to be proud of but not too hard to be frustrating. In real life, goals are often long term and many goals take years to reach. Human beings take great pleasure out of achieving things, and that pleasure is what most games aim to fulfill.   Many games actually have a lot of similarities to sports. You take a challenge, you either play alone or with/against friends, and you either win or lose. This is a proces of risk and reward and like I said previously, achieving goals makes us feel good.  I wrote this down quite quickly because I don't have a lot of time at the moment, but I'm open to any questions you might have.   .  Source: I'm a student of Game Design and Development."
ElderScrolls,32nwhm,TheOnlyArtifex,21,Wed Apr 15 09:54:16 2015 UTC,Having clear goals and accomplishing goals makes so much sense to me. Thank you for taking the time to reply and in such detail too.

ElderScrolls,32nwhm,captain_awesomesauce,8,Wed Apr 15 11:33:40 2015 UTC,"Having clear goals and accomplishing goals makes so much sense to me.    Somewhat offtopic ... But it works for dogs too. In the aftermath of 9/11 the rescue dogs were getting 'down' and 'frustrated' for not finding anyone. Too keep the dogs engaged so they would continue searching volunteers would hide in the wreckage so the dogs could find them.   Attaining short term goals helps keep you on track for long terms goals that have a less-than-immediate payout.  It's a common misconception that people hid so the dogs could find living people. That's not true, it's so they could find anyone at all otherwise they weren't getting any praise for days at a time"
ElderScrolls,32nwhm,Semenslayer,20,Wed Apr 15 20:14:11 2015 UTC,"You should definitely apologize for calling his hobby weird first of all, that's a pretty shitty thing to do considering it doesn't seem to have a negative impact on his life from what you've said. Elder scrolls games are very detailed and open, and provide a lot of different ways to play the same game. There is a lot of interesting lore if you even remotely enjoy fantasy and visually the games are very detailed and usually stunning for the time period they came out in. Maybe I'm just being an asshole now too but if you can't bother trying it or at least even researching it a bit then you shouldn't judge him for it because it's obviously something he enjoys and it isn't even weird if you compare it to other hobbies. If you really can't stomach trying one of these games at the very least you should sit down and try to watch him play a bit so you get the idea or even just ask him yourself."

The conversation between us ended when I walked into work for the night- which is where I am now.

ElderScrolls,32nwhm,WhiteRushin,6,Wed Apr 15 08:42:35 2015 UTC,"Another slice of opinion.  For me, gaming has been about decompression. Something about playing a game for a few hours.. It's like watching a movie, but your in it. It can be relaxing, humorous, exciting, interesting, or more, even all at the same time.   I have a wife, two young kids, a career. I run (first marathon in 1.5 weeks!), read, make things, take classes.. Generally, I have very limited free time. But, every week or so, I need to sit at a computer and be someone else and whittle away at a story in a game. It's entertaining and therapeutic.   A small bit of affirmation: It's OK to not get it. My wife hasn't gamed since Donkey Kong, or Oregon Trail. She doesn't really get it. She gets annoyed sometimes when I take an evening away for it. But she grew an understanding that I like it, and keeps the inner asshole at bay."
ElderScrolls,32nwhm,Amplifiedsoul,2,Wed Apr 15 14:16:22 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the affirmation. I sound like your wife, thats the extent of my gaming. I appreciate your point of view, it really is helpful. Decompression is something I definitely get, and understand is a necessity."
ElderScrolls,32nwhm,mojonation1487,2,Wed Apr 15 14:29:10 2015 UTC,"I used to be puzzled by my husband's gaming myself, mostly because he is a very social person, yet he prefers to spend his time gaming instead of hanging out with friends. What I didn't realize until i started playing myself was that there are alot of games out there, including ESO that are actually very social. My husband has made alot of friends in the years he has been playing. Some he has met in person, and some he will never meet in person. But it helped me understand that gaming is his equivalent of someone else going to a bar."
ElderScrolls,32nwhm,awardments,3,Wed Apr 15 11:26:28 2015 UTC,I'm on mobile so I'll be short. Some people watch hours of TV and no one cares really. I like to interact with things myself so I rather play games. Sadly some of this same people who will spend hours watching TV will judge those who play games. It's all just a way to unwind and relax. As long as it isn't hurting relationships it should be fine. My wife can sit there and watch TV for hours. I can't really. I get bored. Interaction focuses my attention however and draws me in. Just different strokes. Don't know if this perspective helps or not but I do think it's a positive that you are trying to understand where he's coming from.
ElderScrolls,32nwhm,VexonCross,3,Wed Apr 15 11:28:48 2015 UTC,"Here's something I wrote last Valentine's Day that may shed some perspective on what video games can mean to people:   Today is Valentines Day. Love Day. What/Who do I love? First and foremost [name redacted]. Without her, I don't know where I would be. But you know what? You know what set me on the path to meeting her? I mean /really/ meeting her.  Morrowind. When life shit on me, I played Morrowind. When /I/ shit on me? Morrowind. When religion made no sense whatsoever? Morrowind.  Elder Scrolls may just be a game to some, but to others, it's a living, breathing thing. It made me challenge myself on a personal level by the amount of interaction in the game. The personal journey one could make when real life made ZERO sense.  and now? I'm a healthy, drug-free human being. I'm stable, I have a good head on my shoulders. I found my release through not just a video game, but a living experience.  I found peace that I searched my whole life for. I found [name redacted] and I have Elder Scrolls and Bethesda to thank. I will always be thankful to this franchise for leading me to my world, my star, my everything. I love you [name redacted]. Maybe now you realize why Elder Scrolls means so much to me.

ElderScrolls,32nwhm,awardments,3,Wed Apr 15 21:38:32 2015 UTC,"I feel like the best thing you can do, is ask him if you can play the game for a few hours when he normally does and have him with you explaining things you don't get. Even if it doesn't click with you the same way, you might recognize what it is about games like this that clicks with him. Best of luck."
ElderScrolls,32nwhm,ON3i11,3,Wed Apr 15 15:59:25 2015 UTC,"You say this game, but you never specify which one he's playing. There are at least 5, if you count ones like redguard there are more like 7-8, so to accurately describe why he, well the best I can do is describe why I like it and hopefully that will help you. The ones he most likely plays are either ""Skyrim"", ""Morrowind"" (not sure if that's spelled right) or ""Oblivion"". All of these games follow the same principle and outline, but are still very different. And don't worry to much about what you said, it's pretty natural to not like something someone you care about does for a hobby, especially when it doesn't involve you at all, and even more when you don't really know what it is."
ElderScrolls,32nwhm,ScottyBeans,3,Wed Apr 15 18:55:30 2015 UTC,"First, video games can be mundane or they can be extremely artistic, beautiful, challenging, strategic. This is Elder scrolls, but there are many other games that I think are very respectable and meant for adults to play. This is not super mario. That being said, even if he was playing Super Mario, people need to unwind. I love games that make you think, but after I found out I had cancer (it's gone now, woohoo) I started playing clash of clans, a ridiculously addictive but brainless game just to occupy my mind. Not to mention after a week of family, friends, coworkers, and even SOs sometimes you just want alone time, to escape if you're an introvert and feel drained after repeated social contact. Lastly, to be criticized for something you enjoy doing, that in a way reflects who you are, can be painful, especially by someone who is supposed to accept you as you are.   I think it's great that you've made an effort to understand. Maybe you should figure out something to do together? If you got into gaming that would be great, but I think couples need to do things together and separately. Doing things together help you grow together, doing things apart helps keep you an independent person."
ElderScrolls,32nwhm,ON3i11,3,Wed Apr 15 20:00:30 2015 UTC,"What's more weird, watching a tv show that will never be different and the plot will never change, or spending 6 hours in a world where you control everything? Gaming isn't linear, it's for people with greater imaginations"

ElderScrolls,32nwhm,TheSpaceWhale,3,Thu Apr 16 22:24:07 2015 UTC,"can someone explain to me the desire to play this game?   Have you ever loved a tv show, movie, or book so much that that you didn't want it to end? That feeling of enjoying a world or story so much that you wanted to be in it, experiencing it? That's what video games allow people to do. Ever watched Harry Potter and thought ""it'd be cool if I could be a wizard at Hogwarts too""? Well in Skyrim I can become a mage and join a mage's college and cast magic at people. Ever seen Lord of the Rings, and thought ""wow it would be so cool to be a warrior hero and ride a horse across the plains into battle""? I can do that in Elder Scrolls too.  With games like the Elder Scrolls series, you can completely forget all the crap of real life and become that kickass person that only exists in fantasy. They tend to be more engaging and personal than tv shows and movies because those you can only observe from the outside. In an Elder Scrolls game, you dictate the story. You can be an honorable knight, a thieving rogue, etc.  As far as it being ""weird"". That is the product of ignorance in our society toward video games. It's common in media to see jokes about ""nerdy video gamers"". The truth is that a lot of very successful and capable people play games, and imo it is a completely normal and healthy activity (within moderation, of course). I'm currently in a very competitive and difficult doctorate program, and I'd say at least half my class regularly plays video games.   Weird that he could be enthralled in a game that doesn't provide human contact and a social life.   He probably plays games to relax, like many people do. Human contact is the complete opposite of relaxing, imo. Why don't you go hang out with friends instead of watching Netflix? Because you probably want some solo time, like he does.  Anyway, sorry for the long reply, but I hope some of that helped :)"

Also Gaming is (at least where I am) an accepted hobby to have. Instead of watching TV or do other time-wasting things, gamers play games."
ElderScrolls,32nwhm,Haggon,2,Wed Apr 15 10:06:27 2015 UTC,"Hobbies are meant to engage your mind and let you have fun doing so.  That's exactly what video games are. He's not weird. It's a real hobby, unlike watching TV where you're not actively using your mind.  The desire to play video games is pretty much the exact same as the desire to collect train miniatures and set up a train set. It's all about what makes you happy.  Specifically, the draw to video games for me is the ability to actually become part of the story. Not just an outside watching, like with TV/movies, but actually contribute to a fantasy world. You are the hero, you're not just watching him."
ElderScrolls,32nwhm,foxsable,2,Wed Apr 15 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"For me, games--especially Elder Scrolls--allow me to escape reality while still being active. I find TV & movies boring (not mentally stimulating enough) but books usually taxing (since I only like reading stuff that I find challenging). Video games are the perfect medium between the two where I can forget about the stressors of the outside world for a few hours and really totally relax and lose myself in the activity.

It's a very unique type of media in that regard, so that aspect of the hobby can be very hard to sell to someone not familiar with some of the smaller intricacies that make up the medium.  Ask your SO to play through a bit of The Walking Dead game with you if he has it. That's a game that very much plays out like a movie with choices throughout that I feel does a good job of showcasing what the appeal is in an easy to digest format without the trappings of other mechanics of more traditional games."

ElderScrolls,32nwhm,MrTimmannen,5,Wed Apr 15 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"You have actually stumbled on a pretty amazing game, or rather he has. Elder Scrolls games like skyrim are HUGE and when I say huge, I mean they represent a massive area, all of it full. And you are free to explore it all. Take a look at this map. All those little symbols are places, however, they are not all the places, simply the ones that are big and full of stuff. Some of them are towns, with many individual buildings inside. So, start appreciating the scope there.   Now, at the beginning of the game, you have access to that map, but it is pretty much blank. And your character(the person who's role you are playing.. basically you are the actor and they are your ""part"") is basically blank too. You have not done anything, seen anything or learned anything. Typically you are thrust directly into the story with a cinematic event, but after that event, you are free to do as you choose. You have ""clues"" of what to do next if you want to follow the main story, but you can also just say ""screw it"" and go do other stuff. That is part of the beauty of the game. Because the world is full of stuff to do and see!  First of all see, the game is beautiful. You can take a screenshot of almost anything and it comes out magnificent because the graphics are awesome. And it all makes sense. People are dressed in various manners based on where they live and their profession. You can talk to anyone. ANYONE! you meet. Now some of them may  not have anything to say, but a lot of them do. And they may need your help. Or, they may want to kill you and take your stuff. Or both! You collect ""quests"" (things people want you to do) and you can take steps to complete them... well, anytime you want! Or not. Some are as simple as ""bring me a flower"" while others may be ""kill all the bandits living in that cave"". It all varies.    And that's where the to do comes in. You can do anything! Fight bandits, join a faction, rob the royal treasury, get married, build a house, adopt children, collect helmets, arrange said helmets in your house, steal all of the cabbage in the land, take said cabbage to the top of the highest mountain, throw all of the cabbage off the mountain and race it to the bottom. You can do all of that. In one game. Or not. You can kill people, steal things, slay dragons, learn to use magic, anything! These games define ""big"" and ""expansive""."

ElderScrolls,32iipq,ArmorGyarados,42,Tue Apr 14 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"The thing that, to me, sets Morrowind apart is the depth. The sheer scale of the game is amazing, and the density of content is a little absurd. I have spent entire days just in Vivec, exploring cantons and meeting the people, learning the ins and outs of the paths and relationships. Each House has its own politics, which interact with each other as well as the various Imperial factions. The main quest is a masterpiece of multi-layered storytelling. I thought I was so smart the first time I played through and found the dry, easy, Imperial account of the Battle of Red Mountain. ""Oh, a conflict between orthodox and secular Dunmer factions. Cool!"" Then comes the stuff with the Nerevarine. Are you him? Are you just being used? If you are being used, by who? Does it matter if you are? What is Vivec actually trying to do, and what the frak is up with these sermons he has all over the place? And so on, and so on.   Add to that the beautiful alien landscapes, and each region and faction has a completely unique feel. Skyrim does this to a lesser extent, but nothing will ever match for me Tel Vos in the old Imperial fort, or exploring Ald'ruhn after teleporting in via the Mages guild for the first time because the leader of the guild tasked me with discovering what happened to the Dwemer.  It just goes on like this. So massive, so intricate. It might be my favorite game of all time, and while much of it is nostalgia, it is the nostalgia not just of the game, but of remembering ten thousand specific instances and experiences, and the feelings I got from them. Well worth playing.  Of course, same caveat as everyone ever. The combat takes getting used to but I recommend against modding to always-hit. The roll-to-hit is frustrating at first, but as your skill rises it becomes truly satisfying to see your hit % go up as well."

If you're going to try it, see this comment I wrote earlier for some information useful to new players: http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/30zhd3/im_an_outlander_with_some_questions/cpx9bj0"
ElderScrolls,32iipq,MyrMindservant,2,Thu Apr 16 03:48:37 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest. I had been pretty much a console gamer (outside of Civ games and ultima online and stuff) and when I bought Morrowind I didn't really know what it was - the EB games guy highly recommended to me. I had never played a game like it and it was SOOO frustrating to start. There is absolutely 0 hand holding.  This was pretty much my experience:    Make a thief character, had to run away from a mud crab Made a mage, couldn't cast anything - had to run away from a mud crab Made a sword user and finally something started to work. Started feeling a little confident went into the cave just by Seyda Neen to fight the mage the town people told me about and died in one spell. Didn't realize the game hadn't saved anything, character was gone and had to reroll again. Rebuilt a similar char, did the opening stuff again, I take a step outside the city and a wizard drops out of the sky. I find this neat scroll and decide to see what it does. I decide I'll save after I use. I use the scroll that sends me 100000000 feet in the air and die.  Reroll again. I do most of the opening stuff again and then get caught by a guard stealing something. I go to jail, all my stuff is gone and I'm all of a sudden miles away from Seyda Neen and lost.  Rage quit for about 2 months Decide to give the game another chance and do things in a more organized fashion. Finally figured out how to get my character's skills up and once I got over the hump, it became a blast. Up there with one of the most memorable games I've ever played.    I personally recommend playing a mage. It's really, really slow to start especially if you don't know what you're doing, and you are going to have to spend some time grinding spells, sleeping, grinding, sleeping, etc to get your skills up but you can do anything with magic and it's also the most creative. You can build any spell you can imagine (one of the things that makes Morrowind so great).  There's just so much detail and freedom in the game it's crazy. I literally came across random objects hidden all over I honestly thought I must be the first person to ever find. You enter dungeons and complete a quest but decide to keep exploring and find you only saw 1/4 of what there was. Can't find a door? it's probably 100 feet up and you have to figure out a way to get yourself up there.  Just don't abuse magery too much, if you do go that route. It's easy to abuse some aspects of the game but really you're just cheating yourself. I.E. No 100% chameleon effect 24/7."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,ULMmmMMMm,2,Thu Apr 16 21:33:27 2015 UTC,"I played Morrowind the year it came out on legacy XBox. I would have been, I don't know, 13 at the time and admittedly I had no clue what I was doing or how to really work stat numbers to my advantage. This led to a massive exploration since real questing with combat was never something I could do without luck or gross over-preparation.   To date I cannot remember ever having more fun with the lore of a video game. I spent hundreds of hours and days at a time just reading books in-game. 12 years later? Still reading books and console commanding my way through story lines."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,Pnemonic,11,Tue Apr 14 12:01:03 2015 UTC,"Gameplay-wise it doesn't hold up that well in some respects. Combat is awkward and menus are unwieldy. NPCs don't sleep, even at night. Shops are open 24 hours a day.   The things that make Morrowind still my favourite are different from the gameplay aspects.   It has the best setting. It's an ash-blasted volcanic island fringed with rank swamps, populated by giant insects and dotted with mushrooms the size of trees. By comparison, Oblivion's generic fantasy and Skyrim's Norway analogue seem tame and mundane. If you've played Oblivion's Shivering Isles DLC, think about the grim southern half of the Isles - that's quite reminiscent of Morrowind's environment.   That interesting element of the setting extends to the culture, too. The resentment of the Dunmer towards the empire is tangible in your interactions with them. Unlike in Oblivion and Skyrim (especially Skyrim) you're not hailed by all and sundry as a friend or hero-in-the-making. Everyone in Morrowind hates you, and you have to work hard to earn even simple courtesy from them.   It's also an interesting alternative perspective on things that will be familiar to you from the later games. The religion of the Divines is a niche faith in Morrowind - it's known as 'the Imperial Cult'. The prominent religion, instead, is the Tribunal Temple - the worship of three Dunmer who became demigods centuries ago.   It also has the richest lore. The surreal ramblings of the 36 Lessons of Vivec, for instance, are inspired. Which leads me to perhaps my favourite feature...  Morrowind is ambiguous. The Tribunal Temple lies about its origins. It's unclear whether the antagonist, Dagoth Ur, is really a monster or a victim of his friends' betrayal, or both. It's unclear even whether the prophecies that drive the main quest are real prophecies, or just fabrications. I once read a remark by someone right here on Reddit that Morrowind is the story of Azura using you as her tool of retribution against the Tribunal for subverting Daedra worship. There's far more room for interpretation in Morrowind than in any other Elder Scrolls game, in my view."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,AlanWithTea,3,Tue Apr 14 12:26:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, also, it doesn't have much fast travel. You can travel between certain points but then you have to walk from those points to your actual destination. While some people find that cumbersome, I prefer it. It gives you a familiarity with the world which you don't get in the later games. It's more immersive. I know the walk from Balmora to Pelagiad like the back of my hand."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,AlanWithTea,2,Tue Apr 14 12:28:11 2015 UTC,"I avoided using fast travel in the later games, unless I was really keen to expediate my trip for whatever reason. I gained a similar familiarity with the land of skyrim in this way.  The land has always been the main character in the major titles. Exploring, learning and finally knowing the land is probably the primary reason I've been hooked, line and sinker by TES.  One of my few, but sad disappointments with ESO is that it is hard to piece the land together. I don't think they have taken as much care with how the maps, maybe even the lands all fit together, and that wayshrines for fast travel are frequently required to explore the world."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,OriginalPosta,4,Tue Apr 14 14:25:19 2015 UTC,"Morrowind is ambiguous. etc...   Yeah this is absolutely one of the highlights of the game, I wish I'd included it in my post, because it was such an important factor. and again, this can't be contrived for success- the writing was genuinely creative and compelling.   The story itself, even ignoring the ambiguity and moral greyness is great. It has sexy metaphysics, breadth to explore, compelling characters and interesting, well composed plot.  But the ambiguity, the lack of closure and the openings to interpretations that explicitly invites you into the world; This kinda stuff makes for a good story; its enigmatic and something people will be talking about for years afterwards."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,OriginalPosta,16,Tue Apr 14 14:17:15 2015 UTC,"One of the major appeals of this series has been the ability to explore the world. As with other titles, they developed an interesting world to explore; in this case, a fantastical world at turns vivid and morose. But they also defined the world in terms of deep, unique politics, culture, architectural identity and sense of real history that can be explored alongside the landscapes. These two elements worked well together to create an enigmatic atmosphere and mood to the game that many people really loved.  There seems to be an emphasis on quality writing, and an almost indie-esque grasp of the cool and wonderful, ie; truly inspired and not forced by overanalysis of ""the elements of cool"" for market purposes.   I know a lot of people have their qualms with skyrim and oblivion and prefer Morrowind.    I really loved Skyrim in particular (there goes my /r/elderscrolls cred...), and tbh i think the game is very underrated (by the old-school type critics). There is still a lot of depth in that game, but they have made it so that you didn't have to partake in it, if that wasn't your thing, there is all the shinies and action and gorgeous landscapes. I think a lot of people saw this veneer and didn't bother to explore it properly and fobbed it off as cheap and shallow and a sign of the impending apocalypse/loss of the moral fabric/selling out to the ADDgeneration/casoool gamer (which all pretty much amount to the same thing).  And believe me, Morrowind had the same problem; there were many gamers who never bothered with the story, focussed on the clunky combat and mechanics of frustration and wondered what all the fuss was about, and if you google very carefully, you can still find those who believed that Morrowind was superficial with its fandangled 3d polygons and really lacked that special something that Daggerfall had.  And I would bet irl money that if they make a TESIV, it is going to be the exact same story. People will rant about the lore that's been trampled over by a company who sold out and is burning the true fans, you will have people celebrating the game by sharing cool images and others trolling them for doing so.   Are they just the same type of ""back in my day there were only 150 pokemon!"" Elitists?   Yeah, those guys exist, but they aren't the totality. Morrowind was in many ways, really brilliant, and there's good reason people loved this game in particular. I hope in future titles they can put strong emphasis on not only the physical landscape, but on the development of deep, compelling of the socio-politico-historical/cultural-architecturo.... (I'm pushing it) landscape as well. Not by applying a formula of cool, but by engaging great writers and concept artists."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,OriginalPosta,7,Tue Apr 14 02:36:10 2015 UTC,"I too love Skyrim. It's a very close second in the TES series for me, behind Morrowind. Great combat, pretty good voice acting, beautiful graphics, and quite a bit of content.    I shun Oblivion. It's a good game if you look at it in a vacuum, but the generic setting and awful leveling just break it for me."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,cee2027,7,Tue Apr 14 02:43:59 2015 UTC,"I dunno man, I thought oblivion was amazing. I felt that the choices you made had more permanent effects than in skyrim"
ElderScrolls,32iipq,LogicManifesto,2,Tue Apr 14 07:19:25 2015 UTC,What choices? The game's quest lines were pretty linear. Martin Septum tells you he needs you to do this and you do it. There is no choice made in the storylines. Still a great game but the story was very linear.
ElderScrolls,32iipq,drekstorm,2,Tue Apr 14 19:00:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, the main storyline isn't really about choices for the most part. Even in Skyrim, what real choices did you have?   You got to choose a faction (imperials or nords w/e) but that wasn't the main storyline. In the dragon main quest, you either killed parthurnaax or you didn't, but the rest of things, you kinda had to do.  In oblivion, I enjoyed being able to go into oblivion gates at my leisure, I thought the guild quests were all great (DB and Mages guild in that game were unbelievable) and I felt that there were more quests with more unique and fun mechanics, as well as the pure length and diversity of quest chains.  Dunno, just felt more...invested in Oblivion. Skyrim definitely felt like it had a bigger budget, but that a lot of the small nuances and things that made Oblivion special were absent. Perhaps people say that going from morrowind to oblivion as well."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,LogicManifesto,4,Tue Apr 14 19:16:23 2015 UTC,"The oblivion gates were just dungeons. Given the limited number of them by the second or 3rd play through I tried to avoid them because I was tired of them. Skyrim has a fair bit of nuance as well. To me it hedged out as the better game of the two. There seemed to be way too many dungeons in Oblivion that didn't really make sense to me. All the abandoned forts and mines. What was up with that? In Skyrim they are ancient burial grounds that contained ancient Nordic dead. Given how the nords are superstitious and it is their ancestors buried there it makes sense why most are pretty intact. Also a civil war is going on so it sets the stage for me as to why no one explores them. In Morrowind it was against the law to go explore and or loot Dwemer ruins. Hence why only outlaws were there. In Oblivion it is as far as I know legal to loot the ruins. The abandoned mines were never taken back because? What about the abandoned forts on the road around the imperial city that has guards patrolling it? The Oblivion Crisis isn't  known to most of the people in Cyrodil until about 4 quests in. Why let so many things just rot or get miss used. It was almost like these places existed solely so the PC can get swag from them. That is a major turn off for me, though I guess I can see the appeal for others."

ElderScrolls,32iipq,LogicManifesto,2,Tue Apr 14 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe but I had just come off of Morrowind where everything was steeped in culture and history. There was a reason a ruin sat there and then Oblivion's ""You guys like dungeons right?"" approach never clicked with me. I enjoyed knowing that Necromancy was illegal in Morrowind by order of the Temple and houses because of the Dark Elf ancestor worship. The mages complied out of necessity. The empire wasn't entirely against it because an agent of the blades tells you to help a necromancer in order to get info. And so on."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,drekstorm,2,Tue Apr 14 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"In some ways I disapproved of Skyrim (the RPG fan in me resented losing control of my stats and not having the option to create my own spells with custom effects) but in many ways it has the best gameplay design of the series. I enjoyed Oblivion but it's kind of an awkward bridge between Morrowind and Skyrim, with bits of both which don't entirely work together."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,AlanWithTea,4,Tue Apr 14 12:41:46 2015 UTC,"Your description of Oblivion is probably why I don't like it. Morrowind's leveling system works for Morrowind. But tack it onto an entirely scaled world, and it's terrible. I never felt like I was becoming more powerful as I leveled, only weaker.    I know there are mods that fix it, but OOO makes the game enormously difficult."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,cee2027,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:43:37 2015 UTC,Todd Howard said one of their main goals in Oblivion was to improve the AI and I think they definitely did improve it from Morrowind. Seems they didn't do much else after though as there's little AI improvement from Oblivion to Skyrim.
ElderScrolls,32iipq,Contagious_Cure,22,Tue Apr 21 02:08:25 2015 UTC,"Freedom to go anywhere at any time, and do anything you want.  The later games prevent you from killing certain people, and certain doors/chests are locked until you get the quest involving them.. in Morrowind you LITERALLY can go anywhere and do anything. Massive game world.  You think skyrim with it's 9 or so cities is big?  That's cute.  (Yes I know Oblivion and Skyrim have more square footage, but empty wilderness isn't all that exciting.) Unique setting.  Morrowind is like an alien planet with it's own ecosystem, flora and fauna not found in any other game world, whereas most of the monsters and animals in Oblivion and Skyrim are standard fantasy fare you've seen over and over again. It's harsh, it's unforgiving, it does not hold your hand.  You have the potential to become a superpower if you survive, far more powerful than you could be in the later games thanks to powerful enchanting and spellmaking and unique weapons scattered throughout the world.  But you have to survive long enough to achieve these things, and you have to figure them out by yourself.  (Well you could look it up online, but I mean NPCs don't coddle you.) Treasure hunting.  When I go in a cave in Morrowind, I might find a powerful ancient artifact or a secret burial.  When I go in a cave in Oblivion, I know exactly what I'm going to find, a few gold coins and some weapons appropriate to my level. You can get lost.  Morrowind makes you pay attention to where you are, look at a map, and think about where you need to go.  Being lost can be exhilarating, too. Amazingly intricate, interesting, and LONG main quest.  Oblivion had a really good main quest too though, but Morrowind's is still better.  But you will have to pay attention to lore things (like reading books) to get the full impact of what is going on. Morrowind feels like another world.  Not like just a game."

They complained about Oblivion more so than Morrowind, but right after Morrowind launched people were up in arms because it wasn't as good as Daggerfall. And when 6 comes out, the same people hating on Skyrim will do a 180 and say ""TESVI doesn't have a story like Skyrim did, nothing can compare"". Most of the time, a large percentage of this community is like a cancer"
ElderScrolls,32iipq,awardments,2,Tue Apr 14 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"Oblivion's main quest is pretty bad. The faction plots range from forgettable (Fighters guild) to amazing (Thieves guild).  The biggest problem in Oblivion is that you aren't truly the protagonist; Martin is. You are an errand boy from start to finish, doing the work so more important people with destinies to fulfill can save the day with a flick of their wrist.  I felt like Shivering Isles was a direct attempt to correct this issue, placing the player directly into the role of an important character guiding events, rather than just fetching the ingredients for someone else's epic quest."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,Emberwake,4,Tue Apr 14 11:26:30 2015 UTC,"Morrowind isn't really about you either; it's about Azura, the Tribunal and Dagoth Ur. Yes, you have a role to play, but it isn't your story."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,AlanWithTea,6,Tue Apr 14 12:39:43 2015 UTC,You are absolutely the protagonist of the story though. The actions of the Nerevarine provide the forward action of the narrative.

There's no subtext, everything is as it appears to be and there aren't really any surprises.  The most interesting part is the beginning when you have to uncover the secret messages in the books, but even that is explained to you by an NPC."

Dozens of angry naked people wanting to punch me. Also, making it my goal to trap Vivec's soul for an uber-weapon.   I'm going through a Skyrim play through as a just a Mage and I keep looking for spells like we used to have! I wish there was more variety.   I have fond memories of the nervous feeling when first coming across the giant flying beetles that transport you. It was a feeling of newness, that you were just left to your own in an alien world and you just had to figure it out. Morrowind was a terrifically unique game."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,jeebidy,2,Tue Apr 14 11:29:18 2015 UTC,"Haha, being able to kill absolutely anyone can be hilariously unfortunate. I vividly (and painfully) recall being part way through the main quest of Bloodmoon and accidentally killing that Riekling who guides you into the ice castle. I swung at an enemy, hit my guide, then accidentally saved instead of loading. That was that - no more Bloodmoon for me. Oblivion and Skyrim would have just had him be unconscious, but Morrowind let me kill him.   I suppose Morrowind treats you like an adult. If you're careless, things can go badly wrong and the game isn't going to bail you out. The consequences will be on your own head."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,AlanWithTea,1 point,Tue Apr 14 12:36:26 2015 UTC,"this is a bit of a tangent, but I found one of your points interesting:   I suppose Morrowind treats you like an adult. If you're careless, things can go badly wrong and the game isn't going to bail you out. The consequences will be on your own head.   The thing is, I play games because I want a good story, not a questionable simulation of how consequence works for adults.  Consequence is an important device in good stories and the specially interactive domain of rpgs. Where used well, it compels the player to invest in what is happening, and to care about his or her choices in the world. I think its overdone when it results in such utter frustration as described in your situation.  Many people who opine that later games were more hand-holdey quote this particular element as evidence. I have to say, tho, that I don't think it was a sell-out, but just that the devs realised that allowing such drastic degree of frustration isn't fun or enjoyable, and thus probably a bad idea."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,OriginalPosta,3,Tue Apr 14 14:00:00 2015 UTC,"I should probably clarify that while I generally appreciate Morrowind's tendency to provide lasting consequence, I can definitely see both sides of the argument.

ElderScrolls,32iipq,AlanWithTea,5,Tue Apr 14 15:17:35 2015 UTC,"My favorite part is that your faction choices have consequences. You can only support one great house. Want to lead both the thieves guild and the fighters guild? Well that might be a little difficult. Join the mages guild and house Telvanni? That might get interesting...  The other thing I really appreciate is that there are level and stat requirements for faction advancement. Want to advance through the mages guild? Better actually get good at magic! The great part of this is that it requires you to go explore or do other quests instead of just powering through an entire faction.  A few downside to beware of:  The quest design isn't always great. Oblivion and Skyrim were much better at integrating storytelling into their quests.   Want to be a magic user? If there was one system that was most dramatically improved over the three games, I'd pick magic. Lots of people will complain that, by Skyrim, they'd taken away all the best spells and your ability to craft your own. But in my opinion, what they did was make magic a much more viable system of combat, between magicka regeneration, duel casting, and streamlining the spells."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,EarthDayYeti,2,Tue Apr 14 12:02:28 2015 UTC,"I do dislike Skyrim's magic in some ways - I was a big fan of spell crafting, and I always felt like the spells I could get hold of in Skyrim were way behind my power curve, so Destruction magic in particular was never worth bothering with. On the other hand, it was much easier to use. I appreciate that. Morrowind's magic system is very clunky.   I like the stat/level requirements for faction advancement, as well. To advance, you don't just perform a certain task, you have to actually become better at being what you are. To gain a rank in the Thieves' Guild you have to develop better thief skills. Not only is that logical and consistent with the setting, it also means you usually can't just power through several ranks quickly by knocking off a few quests."

See, I don't know if it was deliberate, but I appreciated the feeling that awe-inspiring, visceral, earth-shattering magic was taking a back seat in a setting that was meant to have a grey, earthy tone. The nords were never one for much magic, though it existed, and I think too much of it would have really over-saturated the tone they worked hard to set. The magic in the game works well, imo. It exists, in a rudimentary, basic and almost practically threadbare way.  Vaardenfell on the other hand is steeped in sorcery and wonder, and the level of the kind of wild, fantastical, out of control magic really suited that setting.  Skyrim is not a land of high magic and wonder, it is a land of earth and harsh reality and grim determinism bought about by toil."

ElderScrolls,32iipq,AlanWithTea,2,Tue Apr 14 15:14:47 2015 UTC,I think it also had to do with contrasting with the shouts. Morrowind magic is insanely powerful and would over shadow the dragon shouts.

Why am I going to have trouble with House Telvanni and the Mage's guild? not because the devs only wanted me to have one; House telvanni perceives the mage's guild to be an agent of imperial device in dunmer territory who want to over-regulate and comodify everything, while the mage's guild scorns house telvanni for their absolute immorality.

Apart from the story, the rewards are different too.   My big complaint in Skyrim is that the only really large choice you're asked to make is to pick a faction for the civil war. Even then, the quests and rewards are parallel. The story is slightly different, depending on your choice, but it doesn't make any real difference for your character.   The vampire dlc did a little to rectify this, but too little too late."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,EarthDayYeti,4,Tue Apr 14 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"Time to repost my most reposted repost again!   Advance tl;dr: Morrowind is the greatest game of all time because it puts you in an incredibly unique and detailed setting, gives you total control of your character immediately, and is expansive enough that you can create your own totally unique story. All of this more so than any other game I've ever played.  Copy pasted from my response to a ""favorite game of all time"" thread:  Let me tell you the story of why Morrowind remains my favorite game of all time.  When you start out in Morrowind, the first thing you're expected to do is rob the customs office where they're not done processing you for release from prison. The first two quests you're likely to get are giving an elf dude back his ring and then robbing him blind on behalf of a dude he owes some money to. As soon as you walk out of town, you hear a bloodcurdling scream and a dude falls out of the sky and splats to his death right in front of you. On his body are scrolls that buff your jumping skill to 1000 (ten times the natural maximum and enough to let you jump so high the ground starts to recede from your view distance) but only for 7 seconds, meaning that if you use them, you suffer the same fate he did (unless you stall your fall in some way). The wildlife is nuts, all dinosaurs and giant mushrooms. The first cave you find is full of cat people slaves you can free and an asshole wizard who will probably kill you in the first encounter. All this just sets the tone.  A decent number of levels later, I was feeling pretty confident in myself. I had gotten some okay equipment, done some quests, killed some dudes. I was given a quest to go out into the wilderness and meet some folks. They gave me a starting point and some directions and left the rest to me. There are no quest pointers in Morrowind. There is a map that you fill in by exploring. I headed into the wilderness lightly stocked, confident that like before, I'd be able to live off the loot of the land and come back laden with goodies.  One of the first things I met was an alligator demon. It took a huge chunk out of my health and I ran the hell away. Shortly afterward I realized I was lost. I tried to follow the general directions, but I was in the middle of a more or less landmarkless wasteland by this point. I headed north, tried to guess if my bearing was right, decided to head east for a bit, decided I was nowhere near where I was supposed to be, and decided to just follow the first thing I saw that looked like a road.  I was still poking my head into every cave to check for easy enemies or loot, but I was run off as often as I ran off with new potions and gear. I gained levels. I slept in the field. I ran out of repair hammers for my armor. I found better armor on a guy I just barely managed to kill and discarded my old armor for his (I didn't have room to carry more stuff at this point anyway). I was in the east half of the island by this point, which I'd never explored before. I decided to head south, toward the nearest city I knew about.  Eventually I got out of the wastelands and into some vaguely green terrain. I came across a massive stone fortress. I charged in, slaughtered everyone, chugged potions and looted more off the bodies of the dead. My sword was damaged so I dropped it and picked up a lesser one in better condition. When I killed them all, I was able to replenish most of my supplies. I dropped loot I'd carried halfway across the map in order to take more repair hammers, I'd learned that keeping gear in shape is not a joke. I came across a road sign. ""Balmora"" it read in one direction, Vivec in another. All I had to do was follow those signs, that road, to safe and familiar cities.  Instead, I kept on heading south, to the closer-as-the-bird-flies city I'd initially set my sights on. The path led over more mountains. There weren't many caves to raid. I fought off Cliff Racers. I killed a demon just like the one I'd run from at the beginning of my trip. I climbed down the side of a mountain toward my target, a town I'd first visited by paying someone to take me there. I reflected on how boring towns were compared to the field. I sold what little loot I had left. I didn't need to replenish my stores; I'd returned better supplied than I'd left. I took another look at the map, and thought about how much faster it would be to pay a few gold for a quick trip back to the capital.  I decided to walk instead."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,Fzzr,3,Tue Apr 14 17:24:41 2015 UTC,I love this story. Pretty sure I've even said that before in some other thread.  But you eloquently explain exactly why I love Morrowind so much.  I'm so sad that there's a lack of modern games that let you experience being lost in the wild.  I wish I could erase my memory of Morrowind and experience it all over again.

ElderScrolls,32iipq,andeleidun,8,Sun Apr 19 02:32:20 2015 UTC,"IMO, Morrowind is held in such high regard by those who played it because of the insanely high investment necessary to play the game. You had to know what you were doing, where were you going, what is happening around you. You had to read very long quest descriptions (allow me going on a tangent: voice acting in TES IV and V made descriptions smaller, hence quests became less 'lore intensive'), you had to know Vvardenfell, geographically speaking, you had understand the universe of the game.   I think that makes the game very daunting at first (recommended it to several friends, none got around to actually play it beyond a few hours), but makes you very attached to it, once you break through the brick wall right at the start. It's greatness lies not in being able to wear two different gloves at the same time, or being able to enchant crazy spells, but that it actually conquered the heart of the player through its lore intensive gameplay.  That said, I think at least a part of this is an unintended consequence of poor design. You had to be SO invested in reading quests and remembering where you were and where you were going because the journal was an absolute mess. The exploration of the amazing landscapes was very often triggered by getting lost on your way to some quest spot. Newer games couldn't keep these mechanics simply because they catered to small audience that loved a game that takes so much effort to play.   At least this is my conclusion: it's not that TES IV and V are 'dumbed down', it's Morrowind that is so convoluted and flawed, that when you breach it's surface and find the 'treasure' underneath, it's probably the most rewarding experience in video games, never running out of new adventures and new ways to experience that magnificent world.  edit: Of course, Morrowind had great writing and was a very solid rpg, with plenty of different components. Not every game with complicated mechanics has the potential to grow on you the way Morrowind has."

ElderScrolls,32iipq,OriginalPosta,3,Wed Apr 15 05:02:05 2015 UTC,"It's very different to Oblivion or Skyrim because it's a much more detailed, densely populated storyline that feels like a real world. For instance, character development in Skyrim usually happens through rather mundane, obviously scripted dialogue. However, in Morrowind it's more of an oral history that actually adds to the lore and immersion. It's kind of the more detailed, higher quality foundation that led to the following games. I don't have it anymore, but just thinking about it makes me want to put hundreds of hours into something more rewarding that what we've had (not just TES, but the general decline of game quality) over that past few years."

ElderScrolls,32iipq,TekaLynn212,2,Tue Apr 14 05:24:19 2015 UTC,"It's the customisation that sets it apart from Skyrim and Oblivion. Oblivion was fairly deep when it came to this but Skyrim was as shallow as a puddle. The thing with Morrowind is that once you got the hang of the crafting, you could make any spell, enchantment or potion you could think of. There is so much more content in Morrowind as compared to it's modern counterparts. There are more armour, spells, spears, factions and skills in Morrowind. Morrowind also has freedom. Want to kill Vivec? Sure, but you'd better bring a lot of healing potions! Want to levitate and fly over the map? That can be arranged. On the other hand, in Oblivion and Skyrim there are protected NPCs and levitation is removed. Hell, Skyrim doesn't even have spell crafting! As the technological aspects of Elder Scrolls games improved; the customisation and freedom have had importance."

The instruction may not be well understood and you might have to think about it, but it's all there in your journal.   In Skyrim, I sometimes try to be more immersed, but the quest giver casually mentions ""he's in a cave somewhere"", and the quest log says ""go to orejsonvaald"".  Just go to map marker. Or use a spell that draws a literal freaking line on the ground.   Older games just gave you more of a transcript of your conversation which had hints and details of where to look."

Want to wander into a Daedra den and try to steal a sheild at lvl 1?

ElderScrolls,32iipq,afterthefire1,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:09:00 2015 UTC,"I never played an Elder Scrolls game and knew nothing about the franchise until I recently started playing Morrowind. The two huge things that set it apart for me were: (1) endless customization, of everything, starting at the most fundamental level with being able to make your own custom character class; and (2) the sense that at any point in the game I can just do any damn thing I want, anywhere I want.  First, when I saw that you could create custom classes, the only thing I thought was: Why in the hell does every other RPG ever made NOT DO THIS?! I spend about as much time playing around with the character planner as I do playing the game. And coming up with weird character builds and back stories for them is as much fun as playing them. And you can make custom spells, and enchanted items, and crazy OP potions too. The entire design aesthetic of the game was basically to make the coolest giant box of RPG LEGOs ever and then just let players run amok with it. And it works brilliantly.  Second, my first play through character is something like level 16 (I can't even remember actually) and I only just left Balmora. I don't even really know what the main storyline is yet, and I just have some vague idea that it's some prophecy or something. I got some quests, and some people want me to go to Vivec now for something, but I don't even care. I just log in and fart around and do whatever the hell I want, and I don't feel like I'm missing out or falling behind or off the ""track"" I'm supposed to be on or anything. Everything you do is interesting because each thing makes you better at doing the thing you're doing. There is no doing one thing you hate so you can do some other thing you hate so you can then finally do the thing you wanted to do in the first place.  I don't feel like I need to grind mobs to get XP to get stats to be able to do something interesting. When I see something and decide to go kill it, I'm practicing fighting, and if I do that for a while, I get better at fighting. It's a really simple but simply amazing concept. If I want to get better at casting spells, I just practice casting spells for a while. I even have a couple of cheap spells I made just for practicing.  I'm amazed by how the game works, but even more amazed that so few games ever have copied how it works, because it works so well, and is so unlike the usual thinly veiled Skinner Box drudgery that game makers resort to when they're too lazy to come up with something actually fun for you to do."

For its time it was a masterpiece, but too much of the game was left to chance and the rest was clunky as hell.

I enjoyed Morrowind at an unhealthy level, but it died in my heart the day Oblivion launched, same with Oblivion and Skyrim. The games are spaced so far apart that going back is almost unenjoyable"
ElderScrolls,32iipq,awardments,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:39:58 2015 UTC,"All the stuff about depth and story that other people have said is all true, but for me, it's also the depth and variety of character you can play. The width of the stats system and the wide and differing range of weapons allows you to build so many different unique characters with different play styles.   Morrowind is the only ES game where I've enjoyed playing as a vampire, and where the different vampire clans means one playthrough isn't enough to experience it all.   Each further iteration has stripped out more and more of that depth in favour of accessibility and that's a shame."
ElderScrolls,32iipq,Ged_UK,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:45:33 2015 UTC,characters with different play styles.   In my opinion Skyrim did this better than Oblivion and brought things back to a more varied play style.

The whole place is just incredible. Balmora (Morrowind) - I can't say anything that hasn't already been said in this thread, so... it's simply awesome. Whiterun (Skyrim) - It just feels like a medieval town in Scandinavia. The way they linked the blacksmith with the advisor (daughter-father), the clans who have lived there for centuries and hate each other and of course, the Companions with the Skyforge. It just feels so well crafted and makes me feel like i'm actually in that time period every visit."

As a guy who probably is way to anal about ""realism"" it was nice to leave behind the giant mushrooms of Vvardenfell. Desele's House of Earthly Delights. I was 13 or so years old playing this game, I don't think you need an explanation. Vivec. I loved the architecture, the waterfalls everywhere, etc.   Oblivion   The Great Forest - No game at the time, and many since, have not been able to really capture a true forest feel. This game absolutely did. Inn of Ill Omen - As someone who never fast travels, and RPs alot, stopping at this creepy inn to rest was always a cool thing. Skingrad - the flagstone streets, the cool buildings, the menacing castle in the distance. It had an awesome ambiance. Anvil - Loved the coastal feel, the clay tile roofs, etc.    Skyrim   The forests around Falkreath - Really only after I added mods to enlarge the trees, but as someone who's big on forests, it finally captured the feel I missed since Oblivion. Riding horses through the forest with my companions and then getting ambushed by Bandits was one memorable experience in this area. The fallen tree bridge near the Rift - Crossing a ravine on a narrow log with a roaring waterfall pouring over sheer cliff face is just awesome. Riverwood - first town I came to. Really set the feel for the game, and I like the small towns in the game because unlike the ""big"" cities, they actually feel the scale they are supposed to. The swamps near Solitude - The swamp was really well done. I remember wandering through the murk with my pet dog at my side fighting off mudcrabs."
ElderScrolls,32ckc3,seekunrustlement,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:04:57 2015 UTC,For some reason I like Solstheim in Morrowind a lot better than in Skyrim.  I think it's because I REALLY didn't like Apocrypha and I associate that place with Skyrim's Solstheim.

Markarth for the breathtaking imagery, for nords living amongst the ruins of the ancient dwemer, and because it is part of the reach and on the border of Skyrim and High Rock.  Cheydinhal, partly just because it looks cool, but also because it has a blend of culture. I've seen it argued quite compellingly that there are dunmer influences in the architecture, though I can't see it myself.  Stormhold (eso); Dunmer settlement amongst the ruins of ayleid civilization, sorrounded by argonian mud huts, with future imperial cultural overlay to boot; if they follow this thread in later games or lore, it will be interesting for its political complexity. Yeah, its a little like ""hey markarth was really cool, lets do it again!"", but it still looks awesome."

ElderScrolls,32bvan,kipthunderslate,3,Mon Apr 13 16:31:57 2015 UTC,"I had the idea (probably not original, though) that the Dwemer could have simply been pushed forward in time (similar to Alduin) by the Heart of Lorkhan.

It would be interesting to see how they would deal with a world that still had not caught up to their science while at the same time them being a much smaller group than most races.  Maybe have the lost city appear near the border of High Rock and Hammerfell so that those two places could be the setting of the next game.

ElderScrolls,32953g,Choccokels,6,Sat Apr 11 18:27:58 2015 UTC,"They're different games, Skyrim is the fifth main entry in the Elder Scrolls series. The main entries in the series go:   The Elder Scrolls: Arena The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind (Expansions = Tribunal, Bloodmoon) The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (Expansions = Knights of the Nine, Shivering Isles) The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (assuming you already know this one :P)   Those are the main entries, but in between Daggerfall and Morrowind they released two side games, Battlespire and Redguard, as well. I've never played them, though.  Arena and Daggerfall are available free on The Elder Scrolls website, if you want to see what they were like. They're really dated by today's standards, but they're still interesting to see. Oblivion is available on PC, Xbox 360, and PS3, and Morrowind is available on PC and Xbox. They're both amazing games, definitely worth checking out."
ElderScrolls,32953g,noplzstop,2,Sat Apr 11 18:43:42 2015 UTC,"Which one would you say is best and which one to try first, im still on my way to complete skyrim ( had to start again on pc as ps3 broke :( ) but im up for starting a new one"
ElderScrolls,32953g,noplzstop,6,Sat Apr 11 18:48:41 2015 UTC,"They're all pretty different, and as you go back to earlier games in the series, the RPG elements (stat checks and dice rolls to see if you successfully hit or missed, or if your spell casts successfully, that kind of stuff) get more and more prominent, and they add things in like player attributes (strength, intelligence, willpower, etc.) which makes it a bit more complicated, but I'd go one of two ways:  Play Oblivion next. It's the most similar to Skyrim so it should be easy to get into. It's a great game, and the expansions are awesome as well. The biggest differences are player classes and attributes (which you pick at the end of the tutorial) and weapon/item decay (you have to repair weapons and armor with repair hammers or by paying a smith to do it for you). And no sprinting, unfortunately. You do have a speed stat, though, which makes you move faster as you increase it by leveling.   Or...  Play Morrowind instead. It's my favorite game in the series, but you'll want to be aware of a few things. The combat isn't like Skyrim or Oblivion, you can make contact with an enemy but you can still miss if your skill is too low (you'll hear a whoosh sound) or if their block skill is high enough. A lot of the game has these behind-the-scenes calculations governing it, so your chance of casting a spell is less when your skill is low. Same goes for speechcraft, alchemy, enchanting, lockpicking (no minigames here, just a stat check), blocking, pretty much everything that has a skill governing it. It definitely takes some getting used to. There's also no instant fast travel (i.e. open the map, select an icon, warp there), so you have to rely on taxi services between towns and spells that teleport you to certain locations, or just walk on foot everywhere. There's no quest markers, either, so you have to pay attention and follow directions to find where your quest target is. You'll get a description like ""Follow the road south out of Balmora, and make a left at the river. Follow that river until you see a bridge..."" and so on. It's harder than the other games, but it's more rewarding. The lack of fast travel makes the world feel much bigger, as well, even though it's just a bit smaller than Skyrim or Oblivion.   You can't go wrong with either one of them, though, they're both excellent. Watch some gameplay videos if you're unsure, though."

Don't play unless you wanna have all the games under your belt so that you're able to say ""I've played all the games!"" which is what I'm doing.  It's so hard that I'm pretty sure you will be completely and utterly unable to finish it without using a walkthrough. Not to mention all the bugs, horrible controls (which I were able to fix with autohotkey, though even that was extremely hard to achieve) and really hard riddles. It's a 90's game for sure.

Definitely an unmatched experience by any other game in the series in its own regard."

ElderScrolls,31t4rf,Smugallo,2,Wed Apr 8 13:39:23 2015 UTC,Confirmed.  Didn't leave the house for 3 months.  I was 15 years old.
ElderScrolls,31t4rf,Jov_West,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:07:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely an unmatched experience by any other game in the series in its own regard.   Quite a statement. Which Elder Scrolls was your first? Just curious.  I've tried Daggerfall on DOSBox, but have very high standards for performance, and always felt like it was less than perfect. It would bother me enough that I couldn't play it. I've seriously considered building a retro gaming PC simply so I can play Daggerfall natively on hardware that would have been high-end at the time."
ElderScrolls,31t4rf,TheSkoomaCat,6,Wed Apr 8 02:35:07 2015 UTC,"Morrowind was actually my first.  I'm not saying that it's the best, it's just Daggerfall has aspects that you simply can't recreate using modern engines.  I have yet to really get lost - and I mean actually lost - in cities in any other game past Daggerfall.  Cities are pretty much to scale, albeit flat, whereas Morrowind and up are all scaled down significantly.  Dungeons are the same way as well.  I didn't explore dungeons without having a good recall spell to get me back to the beginning easily in case I got lost.  Also I think I like DF's ""fast-travel"" system the best, since it doesn't just hold your hand and get you where you want to go.  If you cheap out on how you choose to travel, you could very well die for it.  I think really the unmatched experience is it feels most like a good traditional tabletop RPG.  Arena feels tabletop-y too, but it gets pretty generic and redundant after a while."
ElderScrolls,31t4rf,moon_shoes,2,Wed Apr 8 11:37:28 2015 UTC,The character creation in Daggerfall is my favorite in any game. I wish that had carried over to later games.

ElderScrolls,31og3d,sneakierpanda,20,Mon Apr 6 22:10:55 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No, they are god-like immortal beings.  Long answer: A Daedric Lord is a god-like being (as stated above and I'm sure you know) that rules over a realm of Oblivion. Oblivion being the name for any realm within the void that is not Nirn (where Mundus is) or Aetherius (the land of the gods where Jorrvaskr and the like are). However, it should be known that, while it is impossible to kill a Daedric Lord, it is completely possible to kill the Aedra (the Nine Divines) as evidenced by the death of Lorkhan (although, even then, ""death"" may be a bit inaccurate to say). So, why is this? Well, we need to look at the creation of everything to understand that. In the beginning there was nothing.   Nothing except for Padomay and Anu. The former representing Chaos and change and the latter representing order and justice. Now, right here is where there is some variation. But we'll just look at one thing right now. What is usually told is that Padomay and Anu fought a lot. Eventually their interplay created the et'ada (what would later become the Aedra and the Daedra).   Among these et'ada was Akatosh, who created time. Time helped the et'ada to understand their indentities and limitations. In contrast to Akatosh, Lorkhan was created to destroy everything and return it to the void. So, essentially what happened was Lorkhan convinced a bunch of the et'ada to create Mundus, the realm of Nirn. However, creating a realm is no small feat and the et'ada who were involved had to sacrifice their godliness to do so. The first of the et'ada to realise this was Magnus, so he fled Mundus and went to Aetheriu. As he left he tore a hole in the sky (the sun). Soon, lots of other et'ada followed him, they created the stars. However, many other stayed, though lots of them (including the Divines, who we care about) did eventually pull out.   However, they were still weaker than the Daedra, who did not participate in the creation of Mundus at all. The word ""Aedra"" actually means ""Our Ancestors"" whereas Daedra means ""Not Our Ancestors"". Technically, all Et'ada who participated in the creation of Mundus are Aedra. But even the ones that fled as early as Magnus still have a connection to Mundus that the Daedra do not have, which is why the Aedra may seem just as powerful, if not more so than the Daedra. That is why a Daedric Lord can never truly die. Because, as a result of not helping create Mundus, they still have 100% of the divinity they were created with."
ElderScrolls,31og3d,Tryoxin,4,Tue Apr 7 02:05:26 2015 UTC,"As far as slaying a Daedric Prince, likely not. Normally, when a Daedra is slain, their ""essence"" or ""soul"" simply returns to their Oblivion realm of origin. However, the Immortal Plane is anathema to the Daedric nature, so a Daedra slain in Aetherius is stuck there, unable to revive in Oblivion. Effectively, they are permanently slain.  Theoretically, this might even hold true for Princes, but I doubt it."
ElderScrolls,31og3d,TheMadTemplar,3,Tue Apr 7 00:59:43 2015 UTC,There was a similar thread with a lot of good ideas about a year ago here.
ElderScrolls,31og3d,cjoous,2,Tue Apr 7 15:48:47 2015 UTC,"If you are somehow able to change the inherent nature of a Daedric Lord, such as with Sheogorath turning into Jyggalag, you can effectively 'kill' them; a Daedra lord is, in essence, the physical manifestation of an ideal, whether good or evil. This is shown in Skyrim, where they pretty much tell you that the Hero of Kvatch is now Sheogorath, exactly the same as Sheogorath from the Shivering Isles DLC before he turned into Jyggalag."

Daedric Princes can be slain in both the material plane and Oblivion (although it takes someone truly powerful to do so in the latter). Slain like that they merely revive eventually.  Likely the Aedra or other Princes know a way to permanently slay a Prince.  Also, see my above post."

In there you are completely safe. Otherwise, even if you are in an area that can only be reached by turning on a switch to enter of whatever, you can be interrupted whilst resting.   The prison is a hard dungeon, but it is high risk high reward. There is lot of loot in there but also some dangerous enemies (and I'm not talking rats and goblins). Thieves and lizard-men can ambush you.   To get out you just have to go west from the first door you open, then south, then west, then south ect. Cross any water and don't open any doors. There the shift gate will ask you a question, about the mana cost of a spell (one that you'll be unable to answer unless you have the game manual, go look on a wiki or download the manual).

Far Horizons from Skyrim is also really great."
ElderScrolls,314yqh,rhaokja,1 point,Fri Apr 3 12:35:59 2015 UTC,"I love what the sound goblins have done with the themes for the recent games. They really tie them together and set the tone for each installment. Morrowind's theme is languid and mournful, which introduces the state of Vvardenfell and it's place in the Empire. By the end of the track it has a great thronging sound to emphasize the heroes return and a hopeful future. (Shame about the volcano really).    Oblivion's theme is bouncy and adventurous. For me it also has a sense of ""waking up"", the Empire has been wealthy and powerful, but with the start of the game the age begins to turn and Cyrodiil must awaken from it's day dream."

ElderScrolls,312gvf,TheOnlyArtifex,22,Wed Apr 1 15:41:55 2015 UTC,"The main game is very solo-friendly. Some would argue too much so.  You can play through all the quests in all the zones without anyone else's help, but be aware that you will still see other people, and they will still exist in your world. Most times, however, they will not hurt your experience - they can't steal loot from monsters you kill, they can't steal your items, they can't harm you (unless you're in Cyrodiil).  While there are certainly strategies you can use to play most of that content and win reliably, it's typically not of the 'hit this button until you win' variety. Monsters move around and will do things like try to flank or trap you, so you do need to be at least a little awake if you're adventuring on your own (IMO).  You only need to group with other players for things like:   Dungeons. Most of the caves you'll find are Delves (meant for 1-2 people), Public Dungeons (meant for 2-4), Private Dungeons (which need 4 people), and Trials (which need 12 people). However, a good player can handle Delves and Public Dungeons on their own with little issue. PvP (Player vs. Player). You can go into Cyrodiil on your own and do all the questing and treasure-hunting and skyshard-searching you want there solo, but you will be vulnerable - a dog among wolves. Having friends is a great way to not die in the middle of a war. Participate in the player economy. ESO's economy depends on players grouping together to form guilds; if you aren't in a guild with a store, your wares have a much smaller audience.   ...And that's about it.  If you're worried about immersion, there're plenty of mods for the game that encourage it. You can turn off quest markers, NPC written text (so you have to listen to their spoken words), and more UI elements... Or you can add elements and put extra information on your map, so you know where to go to get shiny things.  Let me know if you have any further questions. Whether people love or hate this game is up to them, and it definitely doesn't scratch everyone's itch - but I'm always happy to help a newbie out!"

I did feel that some areas/group dungeons were specifically designed to be completed with others which made it a little frustrating when the game told you that you should be able to easily get through (but only if you were with others).    I played up to ~25 solo before stopping back in June 2014 due to lack of funds.  I never entered Cyrodiil (PvP area) so I can't say if my build would have worked in that setting, but I got the feeling it would not have since I picked abilities that worked well for a solo playthough.    So I would say that yes, it is worth playing as a single player game."

ElderScrolls,312gvf,El_Barto_227,3,Fri Apr 3 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"ESO from what I've played is very much a singleplayer-MMO hybrid. If what you want is story and quests, I think you'll enjoy yourself. Quests are actually really variable and creative--arguably the quests are better than the main series, definitely better than Skyrim's. The world feels very much like Tamriel, though not quite as detailed in terms of ""interact with everything"" (it's about where Morrowind was at). The only real shortcoming IMO is that the dialogue options and number of evil or even morally ambiguous quests are lacking... Lots of helping people with problems. But hopefully that'll be remedied with time and the newly introduced Justice system. Personally I really like it, though the limitations of the MMO genre (public dungeons; respawning mobs) do make it a slightly less immersive experience, I think it's still much more immersive than other MMOs I've played or seen."
ElderScrolls,312gvf,El_Barto_227,2,Thu Apr 2 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"I love the singleplayer games and have yet to find an MMO I like other than Runescape and ESO.  Quests and storytelling are very good, especially for an MMO. Main Story is a solo experience, so you feel like the hero without lots of others doing the same thing as the 'chosen one'.  Combat is a bit like Oblivion's with more spell hotkeys. Much more engaged than WoW (in WoW I just spammed my 1 until I won, in ESO I'm dodging and doing all sorts of stuff)  Classes are very free-form. Only 3 of your 15 or so skill lines, you can do a lot of different things.  Some interesting lore tidbits, for example, the Daedrats. Yup, Daedric vermin that like to sneak through portals and gates. The Dremora think they're cute, so they kill them swiftly instead of the usual torture.  Level can be an issue when exploring, but stealth can help. There's a lot of things to find if gou do explore zones.  if you want to play, let me know if you're on NA, I'll make you some gear."

ElderScrolls,312gvf,NDWolfwood5268,2,Thu Apr 2 01:06:10 2015 UTC,If you love the world and the lore you'll love ESO. I tried GW2 and it just couldn't suck me in like it has everyone else. Getting to explore Tamriel was the hook that finally eased me into MMOs.
ElderScrolls,312gvf,The_Silvenar,5,Fri Apr 10 08:44:38 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, no. Don't bother.   To expand, people tell me that it's a very standard mmo, and it doesn't even do that well. The freedom you love in elder scrolls? Gone. You kill mobs of a certain level before going to the next area and killing slightly harder mobs. Factions can only fight in designated areas and the combat mostly works like WoW.   Honestly, TOR and FFXIV are better examples of this kind of mmo. I want to love ESO, but everything I've seen, read or been told makes me think I'll hate it."
ElderScrolls,312gvf,CrashB111,6,Wed Apr 1 20:38:13 2015 UTC,"I couldn't disagree more. I find it to be a blast, and like OP I'm not a big fan of MMOs. There are things that could be better, but that can be said of and games, TES or not.  The combat is nothing like my experience with WOW. I would compare it more to Oblivion with the addition of hotkeys which do your magic. Considering that Oblivion had us casting with a keystroke, the hotkeys aren't an issue for me.  You can totally travel throughout almost any area. You may be slaughtered because you are too weak, but there are no real limits on your ability to explore if you are careful and/or don't mind having to go back to a checkpoint if you screw up. I feel very free in the game, and I love RPing in the game.  I feel that the downsides have been better addressed by others who have actually played the game, so I will not get into those aspects. If you can get the game on sale, you owe it to yourself to try it if you love the TES series."
ElderScrolls,312gvf,NDWolfwood5268,0,Wed Apr 1 23:33:53 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of buying it on sale just because I want to try it, being an Elder Scrolls game and all. Most of what you describe is the stuff I was talking about, though. Hotbars and monsters killing you in 'high level areas' are things I don't want. Basically, I was hoping they'd embrace the freedom that TES games generally have and give us some fantasy version of EVE where everything is done by player agency. That's what a true ESO should be, but what it is sounds like a worse version of other games in the same category.  Like I said, I'll probably get it on sale like I did Secret World, but I can't advise someone to drop full price based on what I've heard from reviews and anecdotes."
ElderScrolls,312gvf,CrashB111,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:29:41 2015 UTC,"You can ignore the hotbars completely, and again it's like the casting system in Oblivion just expanded to five more keys.  Regarding exploring and being limited, in Morrowind, you could encounter things way stringer than you easily, and have your ass handed to you just the same. However, I will admit that the level restrictions for armor and weapons (need to be a minimum level before using certain types) is a move away from other TES games. But it works in this system. I cannot attest for how the game stacks against other MMOs, but like OP other MMOs don't interest me. This one is great and I started playing it because I love TES. I don't think it deserved the hate it received."
ElderScrolls,312gvf,NDWolfwood5268,1 point,Thu Apr 2 12:13:21 2015 UTC,"monsters killing you in 'high level areas' are things I don't want   Even though every Elder Scrolls game has some version of that? Like Skyrim you can't just wander into a Frost Troll den at level 10 and expect to walk out alive.  And I know its not TES, but still a Bethesda game. The Fallout games have it as well. Like in New Vegas if you try to go directly north to New Vegas you get yourself ate by Deathclaws and Cazadores."
ElderScrolls,312gvf,CrashB111,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:55:48 2015 UTC,"If you've ever played an mmo versus an elder Scrolls game, you realize your making a false equivalence. Mmos do this on a much larger, more annoying scale. I can run from Helgen to any city in Skyrim, hell, any place in Skyrim and survive at level 1 as long as I'm smart about it and, as you said, don't wander into frost trolls. Some areas are harder than others to explore at low level, but a skilled player can take the north route to new Vegas. In ESO, like with other mmos, you can't.   You're comparing apples to oranges. Yes, technically elder Scrolls has these types of leveled enemies, but in no way is it remotely the same as how mmos do it."
ElderScrolls,312gvf,NDWolfwood5268,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:06:00 2015 UTC,"You can in ESO though. All of the Daggerfall Covenant areas are linked to each other, so theoretically you can walk from Glenumbra to Bankorai.  Just like with the Frost Trolls though, the first mob you meet is going to eat you."
ElderScrolls,312gvf,Flyingmonkey53,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:22:09 2015 UTC,"I know you can in TES, what I'm saying is ESO isn't the same. TES games are not that bad at restricting you. Yes, the mods will be tougher in later areas, but again, if you're good and/or smart at how you play, you can beat a frost troll at level 1. In an mmo like ESO, the odds are stacked against you far more in the interest of forcing you to follow a very clear, very linear leveling path of zones.   Basically, TES games incentivize you to do things a certain way. Mmos force you to. That's just an indication of how different they are. Comparing the freedom in TES games to any MMO is like comparing a buffet to a burger joint menu. It's the same idea, you can't order anything you want, but one obviously offers far more ""player"" choice."
ElderScrolls,312gvf,Faerillis,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:32:38 2015 UTC,"Meant type ESO instead of TES up there, but it still applies.  Compared to other MMOs the freedom that ESO offers is above and beyond. Yes you aren't going to be as completely off the rails as a single player game, but within the context of the MMO market you have a lot of freedom to roam around."
ElderScrolls,312gvf,kitcomet,0,Thu Apr 2 15:03:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but you're the first person to suggest that, so I'm not sure I believe it. I'll reconsider and do more research, but everything I've seen and heard goes against what you're saying.   I want you to be right because I want a good TES online game, but word of mouth and reviews make it sound just as restrictive as every other mmo. It sounds cookie cutter.   But either way, it's not free enough. I'm hoping Life is Feudal or Wyrm Online reaches the level of polish I want in an mmo, because those have the level of freedom I want. Right now, it sounds like I should just shut up and go back to EVE."

ElderScrolls,312gvf,jarodxjarod,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:16:06 2015 UTC,"In my experience? Not really. I've tried to pick it up quite a few times but the first 5 levels are really slow and the next 3 at least are only quite slow. You'll be using hotkey'd spells/abilities more than your actual weapons/attack keys so you end up feeling a lot more passive. It's crafting has some cool ideas but it tends to just make the game feel slower and more bulky, at least at low levels.  That said the game is also absolutely fucking gorgeous. The armour designs are intricate and interesting, with each truly having its own unique feeling while fitting into the history of the race and the world. The PvP is also supposed to be very fun but 8 is the highest level I've hit so far (yes that slow).  And I'm saying this as someone who prefers single-player RPGs but still loves MMOs, so take it however you will."
ElderScrolls,312gvf,ianandrew2000,1 point,Fri Apr 3 08:55:53 2015 UTC,To truly succeed in combat though you can't just sit and spam your hotkeys. I find I do a lot of strafing/aiming/blocking in combat on ESO and have to plan and strategize which powers I'm going to use to get the best effect for the mana used. So you can play it in an active way for sure.

Older games in the series are just as good as the newer ones, or even better, but they require different mindset and approach. In terms of inner design and mechanics TES 1-3 are pure RPGs, Oblivion is mostly an RPG with some action elements and Skyrim is an action game with minor RPG elements.  Do not treat older parts of the series as a trial you need to overcome on your way to newer ones, rather try to immerse yourself in them. Also do not try to just run through the main storyline while ignoring everything else, you will miss most of the content that makes these games great.

ElderScrolls,310jds,MyrMindservant,2,Thu Apr 2 05:43:15 2015 UTC,"You can start with Arena and work up but really any of the first two games have not aged that well with labyrinth like dungeon design, and the sheer realistically scaled cities in Dagger fall though impressive I don't think will appeal to you very much unless you have a thing for retro PC gaming.  Morrowind was the first one in true 3D and also focused on world building as much as the story. The world in Morrowind is very alien to what you would expect from a fantasy game. It has Volcanoes, desolate ash lands, swamps, mountains and occasionally green plains. The architecture is sometimes strange and every different cultural groups seems pretty different and you can tell which one has which some times by the architecture in the area.  Oblivion was in my mind the weakest entry in the series. It is still a great game but where it Misses it does miss pretty bad for me but lots of people say it was the best of the series.  It is set in the Cyrodill providence which is mostly temperate forests. This was the first game to introduce npcs that have entire daily routines as opposed to always doing the same things they did in the previous games. The capital of the empire is located in this game and it looks impressive. A lot of work went into the dialogue on this game and it is fully voice acted which was also a first. NPC can transfer through loading screens which they also couldn't do previously. Still a great game inspite of the major glitches it was shipped with. (Most of which should have been patched out.)  Skyrim is set in the Sky rim providence which is an icy viking land and home to the nords. It has dragons, and revamped the level up and skill systems to be (well in my opinion anyway) better. Your character is destined for greatness from early on and the game let's you indulge quite a bit of badass. Magic, melee, stealth and pretty much everything else was rebalanced so there isn't really ""one"" really good way to build or play your character. Stealth is a bit over powered though. Stat grinding is gone now (for better or worse. I think it is better but some think it is worse.). There is a secondary magic system involving speaking in the dragon's native tongue. You can duel weild now as well. There are huge perk trees for each skill to customize your character as you gain levels. It is by far the most accessible Elder Scrolls game to date."
ElderScrolls,310jds,drekstorm,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:36:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, I have all 5 installed on my PC now, though I do agree they haven't aged well, I do enjoy retro gaming. Sometimes anyway.  Though part of me looks at arena and thinks yuck, I think a bigger part thinks ""this looks like fun!"" So I think I'll play in sequence.   Thanks for your really awesome response! :-) I really want to play skyrim first but I'm afraid it'll ruin the rest for me. Lol.   We'll see what happens. Although I'm kind of glad Arena is only about 10 hours since it hasn't aged well, on the other hand though Daggerfall being 50 seems daunting given its age.   Any who, I think I will eventually get them all played.  Any tips on Modding any of the games? Skyrim has the most Mods obviously, does morrowind or oblivion have mods?"
ElderScrolls,310jds,Tirkaz,2,Wed Apr 1 04:53:12 2015 UTC,"I would highly suggest you don't use any mods to alter the gameplay too much... play the games through originally before you mod them.

ElderScrolls,310jds,sayitaintsoap,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:15:03 2015 UTC,"I wasn't gonna alter the game play but more like enhance the game with better graphic mods. Like the water mod and snow mod and such.  Edit: it scanned my PC (newly built for $800) and instantly suggested Ultra High, so a few mods to further improve things should be simple enough."
ElderScrolls,310jds,drekstorm,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:20:30 2015 UTC,"Morrowind has a host of fantastic mods. I recommend starting with MGE XE, a graphic extender which adds custom resolution/fov, draw distance, and modern shaders such as hdr, bloom. The overhaul is also a great all inclusive mod that basically installs itself. This one includes MGE XE but is much more comprehensive as it includes better textures, armor/weapon skins, lush flora, better bodies/faces, as well as performance improving mods. Start with MGE XE and if it's not enough, switch to the overhaul 3.0."
ElderScrolls,30zdul,Aaera,4,Tue Mar 31 22:45:22 2015 UTC,"I've played a video game or two in my day, but it still took me months to really understand the character creation/stat system in Morrowind. These games are designed so that you can pretty much do everything with one character, so having too much character specialization (there was much more in ES3, 4) is more of a hindrance, as it makes it harder to do everything with one character.   The alternative is to argue that one character shouldn't be able to do everything, after all no one character class could see all the Baldur's Gate content in one go,this would allow for a much deeper system of specialization but asks that the ES design philosophy change completely.   If i were the boss, i would split the difference. Bring back attributes,  and skills tied to attributes, but leave skill specializations out (and thus character ""class"")."
ElderScrolls,30zdul,PM_ME_UR_REDDIT_GOLD,3,Tue Mar 31 23:16:31 2015 UTC,"I think choosing initial bonuses to skills and attributes would also be simple to do and help with differentiating characters.  Those bonuses can represent your talents and past experiences and differentiate you from other characters of the same race, but they won't tie down your future development the way a traditional class system would.  That's how I set it up in a homebrew TES RPG that I was working on, and I felt that it did a good job balancing the ability to create a unique character with the freedom to develop that character however you want."
ElderScrolls,30zdul,PowerStacheOfTheYear,2,Tue Mar 31 23:42:44 2015 UTC,"I like this, even if you pick the wrong initial skills, there is no penalty to pursuing an entirely different skill set, as there kinda was in ES3, 4."
ElderScrolls,30zdul,PM_ME_UR_REDDIT_GOLD,4,Wed Apr 1 00:50:16 2015 UTC,"One of the recurring lines used by those defending continually simplified character creation is ""It would be too complicated, people wouldn't get it.""   My issue with the stats linked to skills model was that it had me grinding skills that I didn't want to use so I could a higher stat to modify a derived value like max magika or carry weight. I didn't find that very fun especially after they limited how many times per level. I would much rather have a game that got rid of tedious elements than keep them for tradition. Why do I want to grind a weapon skill or armor as a robe wearing mage just get more strength? It certainly isn't a roleplaying choice and it isn't something directly helps this character. It is just a gating mechanism."
ElderScrolls,30zdul,drekstorm,3,Wed Apr 1 04:52:12 2015 UTC,Oblivion.  I love colour sliders. Please please have full spectrum colour sliders. I want neon green hair :c
ElderScrolls,30zdul,DivinePrince2,2,Mon Apr 6 08:57:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree with most of the commenters here. I could make some truly epic characters with the oblivion character editor, especially after I downloaded that mod ""blockheads"". It all comes down to the amount of time your willing to put into understanding intricate systems. Same with the race bonuses & birth sign bonuses. It adds to the overall replayability of the game. Once you understood the leveling system in Obliv you could then easily exploit it to your benefit. It just takes a little time to fully grasp. But that's how it should be, games should take time to learn & master. I don't want to pick up a controller & be told ""You are the almighty chosen dragonborn, you are the hero of the world!"" in the first half hour of gameplay. Bethesda should stop catering to Casual gamers & start catering to its truly dedicated fan base."
ElderScrolls,30zdul,pressto,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:31:19 2015 UTC,"The creator should be rebuild from ground zero. Look at what you can do in Drangon's Dogma or EVE online: simplification of creation is not the same as downgrading it. EVE is interesting case in that, while it is a mix of a few sliders in the form of sculpting and preset selection of parts to choose from, it subtly and brilliantly highlight which part will be affected by the slider. It would fit really well in an TES creator full of obscure sliders that can only be guessed when you actually mess with them, often resulting in annoying irreversible side modifications. That way you could keep some advanced options and still have an easy creator."
ElderScrolls,30zdul,andeleidun,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:29:33 2015 UTC,"I remember with a lot of screwing around, I made a blue Orc in Oblivion. More customization, not less.

ElderScrolls,30zdul,yngradthegiant,0,Sun Apr 19 07:03:30 2015 UTC,"Sad shadow of what, morrowinds whopping ten or so premade faces or Oblivions Mr.potato head? Character creation (as in the physical appearance of the character) is at its peak in Skyrim. The only way I would improve anything is incorporate the Racemenu mod. I grew up playing morrowind and oblivion, and I can't remember how my characters looked because the character creation was so bad, everyone more or less where clones of everyone else."
ElderScrolls,30zdul,drekstorm,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:06:10 2015 UTC,"Morrowind was very basic with presets, Oblivion was an upgrade with sliders for fine-tuning, and Skyrim is pretty much a Morrowind V2.0 in terms of char creation.  They removed the sliders and brought back presets for the most part. In Oblivion you could mould the face, but in Skyrim you can choose preset face parts with minimal tweaking.  Yes, Morrowind was a lump of polygons and Oblivion was strange, but it's not so much the graphics I'm referencing as it is the options and freedom. The way that you create your face with freedom instead of presets.  I'm hoping for sliders like Oblivion had, but of course with much better graphics and human proportions by default, and with quite a few more sliders/toggles. Some presets are nice so that you can find a good template to work off of and get some big changes out of the way, but sliders are needed to make your character look how you want it to look. Sliders give it life and a unique quality."
ElderScrolls,30zdul,yngradthegiant,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:44:31 2015 UTC,The problem with the sliders was characters lost physical ethnic details except for khajitt and Argonians. That is kind a big disappointment for me that in Morrowind all Nords had certain facial features and the same for Sky rim but it always felt wrong when making a snow white Redgaurd in Oblivion.

ElderScrolls,30u6i2,divinedpk,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:45:22 2015 UTC,"If this is going to be your first playthrough, then I would suggest you to try playing with as little mods as possible. This will allow you to experience the game as it was made by developers and later you will know what exactly you want to alter with mods.  Morrowind Code Patch (MCP) is almost certainly a must have. Morrowind Patch Project is also quite good. Delayed Dark Brotherhood Attack is a mush have if you installed Tribunal expansion. Illy's Solstheim Rumor Fix is a must have if you installed Bloodmoon expansion.  If you want better graphics, then get Morrowind Overhaul (aka MGSO). Personally, I think that it's not really necessary, but your mileage may vary. MGSO is a mod pack/compilation, besides other things it also includes MCP and Morrowind Patch Project. If you are willing to play without MGSO, then you may need at least Morrowind Graphics Extender XE for widescreen resolutions support.  You should also check this short modding guide from r/Morrowind."
ElderScrolls,30u83u,Fatal_Burnz,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:23:56 2015 UTC,If it's just the games you're after you could just buy them all individually on steam and IIRC you can get Arena and Daggerfall from Bethesda's website for free. Will end up much cheaper.   If you're after the anthology with whatever comes in the box (I haven't look at it so don't know if there's anything extra) then I can't offer more I'm afraid.

ElderScrolls,30f9ny,joe_copp,3,Fri Mar 27 02:28:15 2015 UTC,"Except the slomo miss/not a kill cam.    Well, even then, you're right."
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,nerbovig,12,Fri Mar 27 03:12:45 2015 UTC,Killcams are freakin awesome. Hopefully they add a way to disabled them in the future if it isn't already an option but I like them.
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,CSGOWasp,5,Thu Mar 26 22:12:23 2015 UTC,"I think the killcams are very cool. Of course they still have their own problems and could possibly take somebody out of the game experience so it would be nice if they were optional. And I also like where your idea is going. I dont know if i would set it up like that but a way to have unique killcams and unique general fighting styles develop would be very fun to work with and help stop fighting from feeling possibly cut and dry.   Also something to refine would be the decapitations. Bashing a warhammer into someone's neck would not make that clean of a cut, or a clean cut in general!"
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,mPORTZER,6,Fri Mar 27 01:04:49 2015 UTC,"I find that they are a cool concept, but could be executed a little better. I've encountered countless bugs when executing these moves, but it is still quite satisfying when they carry out without a glitch. If they were tweaked they would be perfect in the game. I like being able to cut someone's throat as opposed to slashing them in the back."
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,TheCourier666,3,Fri Mar 27 00:53:10 2015 UTC,If you're  playing as a pure mage it can get a bit bothersome. Like when you're  running from two enemies and your character pauses for a killshot on one then the second one kills you in one attack even if you have sixty percent health.
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,Trashysneakers,9,Fri Mar 27 05:07:16 2015 UTC,I personally don't like them.  They were a bit overly graphic and stuff was still going on during them.  I got killed twice because dude who died a graphic death had a buddy who was still attacking me.  At least let me turn it off.
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,mhoner,6,Thu Mar 26 23:42:31 2015 UTC,It should definitely only be when it's the last enemy aware of your presence.  Even Dragon Age: Origins knew that.
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,nerbovig,-7,Fri Mar 27 03:13:41 2015 UTC,"Isn't the phrase ""even [blank]..."" usually reserved for something sub-par or even bad, not the best western RPG of this century?"
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,VexonCross,11,Fri Mar 27 13:16:51 2015 UTC,best western RPG of this century?   Someone hasn't been playing RPGs at all.
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,Latenius,-3,Fri Mar 27 14:27:23 2015 UTC,"No matter how poop DA2 was, or how much of a disappointment Inquisition ended up being, Origins is nearly a perfect RPG in a time where RPGs have been getting the shaft on a regular basis."
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,VexonCross,7,Fri Mar 27 14:43:37 2015 UTC,"Sure, I agree that it's one of the best RPGs of recent years, but you are talking about the same century games like Baldur's Gate 2, Morrowind, KOTOR and The Witcher 2 were released.  DA:O is not nearly perfect, it's just loads better than most of the modern AAA accessibility streamlining season pass downgrade bullshit."
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,Latenius,3,Fri Mar 27 16:55:52 2015 UTC,"This is a very subjective topic. It depends hugely on your preferences and experience with RPG genre.  If we are talking about years after 2000, then I think I can name about 10 RPGs that I consider to be better than DA:Origins. Although, I do agree that DA:Origins is better than DA2 or DA:Inquisition."

ElderScrolls,30f9ny,rederic,2,Fri Mar 27 01:03:13 2015 UTC,"I love then, my only issue is that Draugr only have one or two, and considering how many of those there are it gets pretty boring."

It should be able to take a page from batman arkham city and how they were able to do their  finishing moves so well. I'd like them to range from heavy flashy to extremely violent and ruthless. And that even on a 100 plus hr  play through u still managed to see new ones.
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,DamarisKitten,1 point,Fri Mar 27 05:55:30 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved them, I wish there was more variety of them. I always used the Dance of Death mod which allowed you to trigger kill moves much more often. Really hope to see more in future Elder Scrolls titles."

In fallout I quickly got very sick of them. Using VATS was like a guaranteed killcam every single time. It got incredibly boring. It was always the same too. Bullet shoots -> bullet hits -> Guy explodes.  I took the liberty of not getting bloody mess during my current playthrough, cause it gets repetitive.  Skyrim did a much better job with the killcams.    Unique cams for different creatures Unique cams for different weapons Unique cams for different camera views.    It also only activates when it's going to be the last enemy that has discovered your location and even then it's not guaranteed. The randomization just makes it much more pleasing.   It still has some room for improvement though. They could've definitely added a few more additions, especially to the extremely common Draugrs and main plot device Dragons. I would've loved to see some dragon heads fly when fighting with an axe, or some wings get shred to pieces.  Magic definitely need some improved killcams too... Watching a beam of fire be a beam of fire as usual in slowmotion doesn't really make it more exciting...  Maybe something like grabbing the mouth of an opponent if they're close enough and shooting inside, though I guess that might be more suited for Mortal Kombat :P.    EDIT: ALSO THU'UM KILLCAMS.  WHY DID WE NOT HAVE THU'UM KILLCAMS?!? Imagine a cinematic Firebreath explosion killing like 5 or 6 lower ranked mobs in one go. It would be so badass D:  Or getting a killcam for Fus Ro Da, where you look through eyes of your victim as you get flipped and flung off a cliff.  God, now that I imagine that it would so badass D:  Does a mod for this exist? Please tell me a mod for this exists q.q"
ElderScrolls,30f9ny,0ba78683-dbdd-4a31-a,0,Sat Apr 4 11:01:39 2015 UTC,"Fine for ranged attacks but a bit silly in melee, particularly when you're surrounded and everyone just stops while you show off a bit like a bad action movie where the protagonist can't lose because of the 50 people attacking him, only one is allowed to move at any time."
ElderScrolls,30egl8,stickman2324,7,Thu Mar 26 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"There have been a few ruling empires in Tamriel, they usually end when a dynasty ends. The Merethic era is similar to the BC years, it ended when the Camoran Dynasty being founded. So the First Era is also the Camoran Dynasty, this ended ~ 3000 years later when the Second Era started with the Reaman dynasty, the Third Era had the Septim dynasty which died out in ES IV: Oblivion, The Fourth Era began with the Mede dynasty, and has yet to end."
ElderScrolls,30egl8,thebawsofyou,3,Thu Mar 26 20:52:23 2015 UTC,"And in response to this, any major even that changes the lives of all of the citizens of tamriel is also capable of changing the era such as the Oblivion crisis, but it just so happens that it also ended the septim dynasty. However, you also need to think that the interregnum didn't end and start eras. It was ended by Tiber septim who then started a new era and a new empire."
ElderScrolls,30egl8,HairySascrotch,-4,Fri Mar 27 11:22:47 2015 UTC,"And we'll see if we're still in the Fourth Era when (and if) The Elder Scrolls VI comes out.  (With the flop of ESO, it should be obvious to Bethesda/ZeniMax that making TES VI will save the series. Hopefully.)"
ElderScrolls,30egl8,shinjiryu,3,Thu Mar 26 23:57:08 2015 UTC,the flop of ESO  making TES VI will save the series   implying eso is a flop and a sixth game is the only way to save the series.
ElderScrolls,30egl8,TooSkilled,-1,Fri Mar 27 10:18:02 2015 UTC,"Well ESO is a flop — even if it's an enjoyable game, it didn't do well financially — but it's a spinoff game not really part of the series, nor does the series need saving so you are right on that."
ElderScrolls,30egl8,Faerillis,2,Fri Mar 27 21:21:07 2015 UTC,Well ESO is a flop   source?
ElderScrolls,30egl8,OriginalPosta,-1,Sun Mar 29 16:07:04 2015 UTC,"It couldn't hold enough subscriptions, nor garner enough buyers, to remain pay-to-play. This wasn't some tactical ""First year is paid"" it was the inevitable force of it not being financially viable as it was released. In other words: a flop.  Now I'm not trying to insult it on top of those sale numbers — enjoy things however you so choose — but speaking financially it did end up flopping. That's all."
ElderScrolls,30egl8,Faerillis,2,Mon Mar 30 04:30:04 2015 UTC,"ESO couldn't hold subscription numbers because of the state of the North American MMO market. Everyone wants F2P - nearly all games have been going to that model over the last several years. This doesn't necessarily make the game a ""flop"" - it really just means that the company is giving players what they want. IMO it has nothing to do with subscription numbers at all and has everything to do with making the game accessible on consoles. Making the game buy to play with a real money store makes the game that much easier for console players to get into."
ElderScrolls,30egl8,Th3V0id,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:42:50 2015 UTC,"I would also say that since they wanted to go to Consoles as well as PC, dropping the Sub is the only way to achieve that.  You are going to commit financial suicide if you ask Console players to pay a subscription + their PS+ or Xbox Live subs. And if they didn't have to pay a sub but PC did, you would alienate your PC userbase.  The only way to keep all 3 groups happy is to drop the subs completely."
ElderScrolls,30egl8,CrashB111,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:59:51 2015 UTC,"You don't keep anyone happy with subscriptions; they exist to compel people. XBox Live, Playstation Plus, Netflilx, etc...

ElderScrolls,30egl8,Faerillis,1 point,Fri Apr 3 03:38:11 2015 UTC,Asking people to pay $30 a month to play your game is going to be pushing it no matter how good the game is.
ElderScrolls,30egl8,CrashB111,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:42:45 2015 UTC,I believe it was $15 and even as a former WoW-player I agree with you entirely. But MMOs work on the basis of compulsion — just enough reward to keep the hook in and eventually enough cost that it seems more wasteful to cancel your subscription and lose everything you made. A fallacy of course but one that trips people up.  I don't at all disagree that it should have gone subscription-free but if they had the numbers to keep it there they would have.
ElderScrolls,30egl8,Faerillis,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:09:56 2015 UTC,"Wrong, wrong, wrong. ESO was holding the numbers. Microsoft just put their foot down and said no, you can't double charge our players and we won't waive Gold as a requirement. PlayStation was all for waiving PS+.

It's similar to how historical periods work: the Bronze age ended with the Bronze Age Collapse, Classical Antiquity ended with the fall of the Roman Empire; in Tamriel, The 2nd era ended with the loss of the Cyrodill bloodline, the 3rd age began with Tiber Septims ascension and conquests, and ended with the Oblivion Crisis and loss of the Septim Bloodline.

Dragon-breaks occur at any point in time, ie The Warp in the West was a Dragon Break that occurred a little more than 20 years before the events of Oblivion.  Eras are dictated by particularly huge events. The Merethic Era ended with the foundation of the Camoran Dynasty in Valenwood. The First Era ended with the death of the last Emperor of the Reman Dynasty and the rise of the Potentate. The Second Era ended with Tiber Septim's conquest of all Tamriel.
