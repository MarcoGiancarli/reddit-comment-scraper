As someone who is an atheist who studies euphoria, I am telling you, specifically, in atheism, no one calls trilbys fedoras. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you should too. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""fedora family"" you're referring to the euphoric grouping of le reddit army, which includes things from neckbearded gentlesirs to highly intelligent intellectuals like myself.

justneckbeardthings,3dyj46,craigishell,-4,Mon Jul 20 18:15:24 2015 UTC,"I don't claim to be super smart, but now and then I try to explain some things to certain people I know, and they really do not grasp what I'm saying, no matter how simple I try to make it. I'm not talking about anything complex, or anything technical, these are every day things. I think a lot of it has to do with education, but also that these people just have lack of experience with thinking about things outside of what they can visually see. Half the time they will just accept my suggestions because they don't get it and don't want to put the thought into it and the way they've been doing it works, even if its harder or wrong, the rest of the time they completely dismiss it, because it's too hard to think about it. It's highly frustrating.   The only example I can think of, off the top of my head, is when I once suggested that someone pay forward small amounts towards a bill each payday, so they weren't faced with a large unpayable bill in 3 months time, and they could do that with all bills, if they calculated the average amount they should pay each payday. To this day, they still do it their way.  Then you get the people that will dismiss a carefully worded suggestion on a topic you are knowledgeable about, or even something you do for a living, and instead go for something their friend's uncle's half-sister told them on a hunch, simply because they've never heard of your method before, and they prefer to take the answer of someone that agrees with them."
justneckbeardthings,3dyj46,Anach,4,Mon Jul 20 22:49:00 2015 UTC,Boo! How dare you make a reasonable statement about how stubborn and resistant some people are to challenging or changing their opinions or ways. You 2 smrt for me. How's it feel losing so many internet points over this mr smarty pants?
justneckbeardthings,3dyj46,ProllyChris,4,Tue Jul 21 01:40:51 2015 UTC,"I kinda expected it to be downvoted, as it comes across pretentious, and considering what subreddit this is, it's kinda an expected neck-beardy thing to say, however, in these cases, I am directly involved, so it is my place to make these suggestions. As for losing those points. I wouldn't have even noticed until you alerted me to it.. Now I'll have to post a meme later to make up for it.  As for another example of what you just said, regarding people that resist even the well meant advice. Yesterday I had to be the one to have a talk to the owned of an aggressive and entire male dog at the local dog park, because his dog had started numerous fights for the last 2 weeks, one of which ended in surgery for at least one of those dogs. I carefully suggested some methods of avoiding conflict, and possibly training, as he didn't want him neutered. I even gave him some handy training tips on trying to take charge of his dog. He refused to accept that it was his dog causing it, shut down my suggestions, blamed everyone else and left the park as his dog ran off to tackle another dog, and refused to come back on his command.  He will end up being banned from the park and possibly fined by the council instead, because he's too horrible to face some reasonable advice from someone trying to be helpful."
justneckbeardthings,3dyj46,Anach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:58:11 2015 UTC,"I agree this meme seems pretty neckbeardy...but I do know what it's like to argue with someone who just doesn't understand my side of the argument. One specific example I can remember was when I was arguing with someone about how legalizing or decriminalizing drugs can actually be a good thing (see Portugal), and they were like ""but you can't just let people do drugs!!""  And couldn't comprehend all the positive effects it can have on society when you don't just lock people up in cages for taking/selling drugs (particularly less harmful ones)."
justneckbeardthings,3dyj46,TROLO_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:45:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's very common for people's prejudices and misconceptions to override their ability to listen to facts and logic. I don't do any drugs, other than those I have to do due to medical reasons, but there are good reasons to legalise certain substances;  such as making drugs safer, taking taxes, removing dealers income and having a controlled substance you don't have to fight an endless battle against, wasting tax payer money.  We have the same problem with people against gay marriage."

Anyways, point is, super unimposing nerdy guy, not so much a beard just a super dweeb.   Anyways this kid tells my brother he's going to bring a pair of brass knuckles to come kick his ass at a fight. im down the block kicking it with the kids in front of the smoke shop and some girl comes running up and is like ""Your brother is in a fight on the baseball field!"". So me and a few friend go running down the street and there's this huge crowd gathered around this beard and super dweeb wrestling. like they were fighting like they were in a wrestling match. no punches, just straight up wrestling moves. me and my friends go pull them apart and finally campus security is on the scene. they take them to the office and search their backpacks for whatever reason. Super dweebs? nothing, obviously, nobody in their right mind would think this sheltered son of a bitch had access to a weapon. My brother? he's got an anime dagger replica and a fucking taser (where the fuck?) in his backpack. Gets expelled, sent to different school.  So when I took him to his first rave we dubbed him ""Tasertag""."

Gave him some ecstasy, saw him actually approach and make friends with people. He took in the environment and was smiling and dancing and opening up to people. I had some really cool friends who he trusted so he was with a big group of people and had a ""normie"" night out.  Im pretty sure that was his only one though.

justneckbeardthings,3dvgxr,Fuck_Accountant,15,Sun Jul 19 22:07:11 2015 UTC,"That's actually a bad karambit. They're supposed to be curved more towards 90 degrees. People hold them incorrectly and use them incorrectly, generally, and it's mostly because western knife manufacturers made the shape wrong. Everyone tends to think they're just curvy regular knives."
justneckbeardthings,3dvgxr,leDesespoir,9,Sun Jul 19 22:24:44 2015 UTC,"They've evolved from the traditional Filipino style, though, and tactics have evolved along with them. The original primary usage was for agriculture, the martial aspect was only a secondary concern. Essentially, now ""karambit"" is any knife that has a curved hawkbill-style blade and a fingerhole on the other end, primarily intended to be held in the reverse grip. Even still, you really need training to effectively utilize one in a fight.   That said, the karambit in this picture is standard mall ninja crap. You can pick them up online for about $10-15. There are some really good karambits out there that use a similar shape, though, that can be very effective with training."
justneckbeardthings,3dvgxr,alc6379,6,Mon Jul 20 01:21:19 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything you've said.   Karambits are a little terrifying, in all honesty. I would not want to have to deal with someone who could use them effectively."

He's on the forefront of ""modern"" karambit tactics, in my opinion, and he uses other blades that don't match the traditional designs exactly, but have similar applications. Some of the blades he uses are barely curved, if at all, and offer different options of how you strike your opponent with them."

I'm not super big on karambits myself, but my instructor has a big interest in Filipino Martial Arts from his time in Southeast Asia. He integrates it a lot into his Jeet Kune Do work. He LOVES knifework, but he admits it's not the most ideal form of self defense.   Personally, though, I keep a Benchmade SOCP dagger on the strap of my backpack. It's got the finger hole like a karambit, but it's almost exclusively intended for stabbing type applications, where a karambit is for slashing. The finger hole can also be used as a makeshift brass knuckle for punching applications. (Actually, you can do that with a karambit, too).   It works great for self defense for that reason-- you can hold the knife, have good retention, and still be able to punch, but have that extra option of force escalation if you need it."

justneckbeardthings,3dvgxr,HerrBongwasser,3,Sun Jul 19 23:13:38 2015 UTC,"Lots of cool karambit facts here, but none can answer the question well. The loop at the bottom was designed for your pinky to go through, so when you are working and need to use both your hands you can let go the knife and it will fall around your hand and stay retained by the pinky. I can't come up with a better way of describing it, but you can let go of the knife to use your hands without using a sheath or putting the knife down. This was super popular with seamstresses and farmers, who would use their knives for protection at night etc. At this time the knives were more normal looking, with a far less drastic curve in the blade. The subtle curve was great for cutting twigs and roots etc. At the same time, martial arts of the region were very up close and in your face. So as time went on, these knives with the loop at the back gained a more drastic curve to accommodate ripping the living shit out of someone's flesh from, and less about utility like farm work. The gentlesirs example is basically a massive piece of shit that kinda looks like these karambits."

justneckbeardthings,3dvgxr,enoughaboutourballs,7,Mon Jul 20 00:52:38 2015 UTC,Oh knives are great at killing. My point being if some one can beat your ass they can still most likely beat your ass even if you have a knife. I've always seen knives as being a suprised offensive tool more so than defensive.
justneckbeardthings,3dvgxr,xRoHx,2,Mon Jul 20 02:30:52 2015 UTC,"For sure. Ivr trained silat and kali for a couple years. Everyone thinks knife fighting is super user friendly when they start (myself included). It super is not and even if youre excellent its hard not to get cut. They also trump a punch so the fight becomes about who has it, which if you are smaller ot untrained, will be the other guy who will kill you 9 times out of ten.   If you are really really good, you probably learned at some point its best to not use it if you dont have to. Also, guns are op and best coursr of action if you need it."
justneckbeardthings,3dvgxr,enoughaboutourballs,3,Mon Jul 20 02:35:44 2015 UTC,Hand to hand knife or not will be about skill. Pistol will generally be about who draws first. All pulling a knife around my neck of the wood will do is get you shot.
justneckbeardthings,3dvgxr,xRoHx,2,Mon Jul 20 02:45:03 2015 UTC,"Eh, i don't exactly disagree. I do think two untrained people fighting is definitely about who has the killing tool.

justneckbeardthings,3dvgxr,enoughaboutourballs,4,Mon Jul 20 02:51:46 2015 UTC,"A knife would be effective in a situation like, if a guy was mugging you, and he didn't have a gun, and he was awkwardly close to you, I mean like, not even a foot away, and it makes you uncomfortable and you don't really know why because he has no reason to be this close, but he also doesn't have a knife, and he's too big to actually move quickly but not big enough that the knife wouldn't just get stuck in belly fat.  Personally, I'd just stick with a gun, but that's me."
justneckbeardthings,3dvgxr,DammitJosh,2,Mon Jul 20 11:56:41 2015 UTC,Definitely gun. Even pepper spray or a stun gun would be more benificial than a knife for self defense. A knife you are literally trying to bleed someone out to disable them. That could take a while and get you killed.

justneckbeardthings,3dvgxr,xRoHx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:41:44 2015 UTC,"The knife fighting classes I've taken have focused on just using it as another tool in hand-to-hand combat. The focus has been on slashing cuts to the hands, arms, neck, and face. Secondarily, tendons in the leg, but those types of attacks leave you really vulnerable, to the point of being impractical.   Incidentally, the cuts to the tendons are the ones that would do the most damage, meaning you could at least immobilize your opponent. Really, if you use a knife in a fight against an opponent, you're just looking to get covered in blood (yours or your opponents)."
justneckbeardthings,3dvgxr,alc6379,2,Mon Jul 20 07:37:11 2015 UTC,My point being that if have enough training to use a knife well you will be better served using your fists.

justneckbeardthings,3dtz2n,VicBiasWatch,22,Sun Jul 19 22:52:27 2015 UTC,"Not as a species, no. But Japan's awful birth rate will mean their next generation will be half the size of their current one. They'll be a country full of elderly people in aged care with no young people left working to keep the economy going. It'll be a major social and economic catastrophe if Japan doesn't sort its shit out and start having babies, or stop being massive racists and let some immigrants into the country.

(keep in mind japanese men have to work A LOT. They have almost no free time.) Meanwhile, the women view the men as too effeminate and they don't like how little time is devoted to them.  Honestly, neither side is wrong, and I'm not sure how you even fix this besides maybe putting a cap on how many hours you're allowed to work an employee. The situation over there is just fucked."

justneckbeardthings,3dtz2n,TopspinTEC,50,Tue Jul 21 09:06:50 2015 UTC,Japanese women often deliberately avoid seeking out a relationship to focus on their careers. They have male host clubs where women can go and talk to them just like the guys have maid cafes. So... if you think there are a bunch of Japanese women out there lamenting the male situation you'd be wrong.

justneckbeardthings,3dzqaz,unfunnyfuck,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:42 2015 UTC,"Self-aware neckbeard is self-aware. That being said, it was actually  pretty good for an amateur youtube film. If this is op: you have film making talent, but in the future try a less is more approach. I'd use your normal voice. I think you sell the parody without the exaggerated vocal performance; it takes away from surprisingly excellent use of camera angles and editing. I rewatched it on silent and it holds up nicely. Clearly I don't have much going on right now.   I wasn't going to continue but fuck it. You should have ended it when he passes out. I thought it was pretty funny even in spite of the weird voice up to that point. After that it got a little exhausting.  I guess the only reason I'm even saying anything is because it seems like you've got potential and maybe you'll make more. I'm quite sure you posted this looking for lengthy feedback. We are all neckbeards after all."
justneckbeardthings,3dzqaz,Kid-Dynamite43,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:11:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot man, I actually worked with a few friends on the film, we didn't really have much guidance on what I should do with my voice or anything, and your feedback means a lot! Can't improve unless people can tell you what you did wrong, eh? I wasn't really in charge of the camera angles or anything like that, so that credit goes to someone else, all I really did was spark the dumb idea and be a neck beard on camera.   The whole plot twist thing with lobster man was an irrelevant inside joke, I seriously didn't expect anyone to watch it the video, and I enjoy getting lathered in red paint, so we decided to do it. The original idea ended when I passed out on the lawn though, haha"

justneckbeardthings,3dvpqd,round42,4,Mon Jul 20 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"The gist was that because women have more control over their sexual urges, they have an unfair upper hand in relationships which they use to extort things (jewellery, money, commitment) in exchange for sex. Ergo, to level the playing field, women owe men sex.   There was also some bonus super-creepy stuff about how men who are denied sex are more likely to be violent, so women need to give men sex to prevent violence.  If that makes no sense, congratulations! You're not insane."

justneckbeardthings,3dtowj,Neuro_Skeptic,13,Sun Jul 19 20:54:32 2015 UTC,"Another day, another bunch of MRA's mocking a male feminist for trying to make a difference.   lol it's funny because identifying as an MRA is one of the biggest NeckbeardThingsTM you can do.

Edit: Okay, looking through her post history, I really can't tell if she's an elaborate troll or just completely insane. On the off chance that you're serious, if you ever happen to read this: seriously, you're not helping. It doesn't help women when you represent them the way you're doing. If you go off on crazy, angry tangents and accuse people of being MRAs or CIS (like that is an insult?) you make women look bad. People who interact with you are going to assume all women are like this, and that really is not helpful for feminism. TBH, I'm tempted to believe this is actually a guy playing the ""crazy feminazi"" in order to make feminists look bad, that's how ridiculous some of her comments are."

What's your gender, age, class, religion, and ethnicity/race? What mental disorders (if)have you been diagnosed with? Do you have neckbeard relatives? Do you have neckbeard friends/acquaintances? Be honest as fuck, how egotistical/narcissistic are you? Drug use (I don't mean just illegal drugs, I mean everything you have used to get buzzed)? Were you bullied in school? What genres of music do you like, which is your favorite? What genres of music do you dislike, which one do you hate the most? How was your relationship with your family growing up, how about present day? What about romantic relationships, how many have you had? How strong/stable were they? Do you re-appropriate forms of entertainment designed for children (e.g. My little pony)? Occupation? Education? Who else lives in your place of residence? Hygiene?"

justneckbeardthings,3dv5nb,MuertoMalos,14,Sun Jul 19 19:53:28 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that with neckbeards, many of the traits that they have can be linked to autism, such as the lack of need to shower or bathe, having almost no shame in what they would do (whether it be socially acceptable or not) and social awkwardness all come to mind.  Another thing that can be noticed is how some of them have no filter (going back to the no shame part). What i mean by this is that they will say some things considered inappropriate and feel nothing afterwards. This is something i had to deal with to and even today i still struggle with it. Like i said before, having no shame/filter can be linked to autism."

justneckbeardthings,3dv5nb,Battlesheep,4,Mon Jul 20 05:24:42 2015 UTC,A lot of them do have traits generally associated with Aspergers or Autism.   They may or may not have Aspergers or autism though. What is socially acceptable is taught or learned. Someone with Aspergers or autism has difficulty learning these things. The neckbeard may never have been taught or may not want to learn.   Eventually most neckbeards grow out of their neckbeardism. People with Aspergers or autism tend not to.
