Isn't animal agriculture basically a deliberate killing of a large group of beings? Sure, we keep breeding them so they replenish their population...  And what's so wrong with a world where we have a few farms where domesticated animals can roam around free from harm?"
Bacon,3drv9e,crackyJsquirrel,3,Tue Jul 21 07:11:09 2015 UTC,"Serious answer:    In the vegans mind there is supposed to be a wild herd of dairy cows roaming the land.   Nope!   So they would just eat all the naturally growing plant life, (including the veggies the farmers grow) and then leave their huge shits all over the place...eventually dying of old age and providing giant carcasses to feed the predators!   Nope!   Would we see wolves become even more intelligent?   Nope! (though that 'nope' is more from an evolutionary biology perspective; not necessarily a vegan one)  Modern day industrially farmed animals are artificially altered version of their wild counterparts, with wildly artificially inflated numbers. The wild counterparts have all the adaptations necessary to survive in their respective biomes; we still have wild bovine, wild fowl, and wild hogs today, and (hopefully!) these aren't going anywhere. Since the world ain't going vegan overnight, in the ideal scenario, as demand for meat goes down, the number of creatures bred every year for slaughter would also go down, until eventually we'd be breeding no more of them, and their population totals would be well lower. There are farm-animal sanctuaries across the world that take in animals rescued from the animal agriculture industries; it would be nice if we could provide a decent life to the last remaining members of these artificially bred species, who have no natural biomes. Species extinction is only a thing to be avoided because of the complex roles species play in larger ecosystems. These artificial breeds don't play any role in any natural ecosystem. In such a case, it's consistent to have compassion for the individual members, while recognizing that the collection of members itself can be allowed to vanish."

About 1/4 of the liquid renders off during the curing process firming up the fat which is critical to the process. Upon frying most of the fat renders off. This has nothing to do with America and everything to do with flavor.

Fry up a bunch of bacon so it's mostly done but not completely, then when it's still hot and soft, fold the strips into your ""patty"" shape. Be careful not to burn yourself. Finish in the skilled with a bacon press to help the layers adhere to each other. You can probably leave the outside layer uncooked and then when that's done, it'll hold it all together.

Bacon,3d2p47,Baconist,2,Mon Jul 13 15:23:34 2015 UTC,Boil your bacon first (let the water cook down and then fold and fry in the leftover fat.). This renders the fat so the meat and fat cook without one of them burning before the other.

Bacon,3cychv,jonnyredshorts,2,Sat Jul 11 23:14:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry you're getting downvoted for your opinion, even though it's an extremely odd one. Unfortunately, I don't think you can easily remove  the fat from ""streaky bacon"" before cooking without it coming out horribly. If I were you I would try one of two things. First, as others have suggested try cooking it longer. If you cook it to the point the bacon is crunchy, the fat loses its ""fatty"" texture and becomes more softer and melty. If that still is not to your satisfaction, try cooking it and afterwards separating the fat with either a knife or your fingers (after its cooled a bit). I'd imagine that if you try to remove the fat before cooking it will become extremely tough and dry. Also try different brands. I've noticed the amount of fat varies wildly between brand and even individual package.  As for back bacon, I couldn't say as I don't eat it. To be honest, I was unaware it had any amount of fat on it.   It may be something worth aquiring a taste for as well. It sounds like its mostly a texture problem for you and if you learn to tolerate it better it should open a broader range of the more flavorful cuts of meat, assuming that it is a problem you have with all fat and not just bacon fat. Good luck and good eating."

Also, Whole Foods cures their own bacon and they have a ton of different flavors. It's like $10 a pound, but pretty worth it.

Bacon,3cychv,mrbaconpants,5,Sat Jul 11 23:12:30 2015 UTC,"A lot of people said to cook it LONGER, but the answer really is to cook it SLOWER and LOWER.  Med-Low, 25-30 minutes, perfect bacon every time.   And I don't fuck around with 3-5 slices in a pan, I line every centimeter with bacon and then layer over that so I get 12-16 slices in the pan.  I have a 13 inch heavy iron pan for this!  Once I open a package of bacon, it does not go back to the fridge.   EDIT:  Try an episode of Mr. Baconpants.  They started cooking bacon for lots of shows last year!   I'm the stoner in the bottom right corner.  I'm so wasted all the time.    The point is that your bacon should be cooked just so that when you take a bite, it doesn't get stringy or hard to chew at any point.  When you bite down on a BLT, you should not be tugging bacon slices out whole, or having it just crumble into your lap.  It should be firm, yet slightly bendable, and should break off evenly when bent more than half way.  You know when you've done it right, and it feels good."

Farmland's in downright awful, avoid with prejudice, I've never tasted bacon that has no flavor before."

Bacon,38abtw,Grombrindal18,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:56:49 2015 UTC,"There are very few savory dishes that cannot be improved by bacon/pork fat in some way. I've had this discussion many times and we normally end up with cereal being bad with bacon, and most desserts that aren't chocolate and/or maple flavored. The only other thing we ever come up with is more of a texture thing... in that a soup or stew could make your bacon too soft and chewy, which wouldn't taste bad, but provide an unpleasant mouthfeel.... unless you love chewy bacon."

Even the tiniest bit, powdered, minced, it doesn't matter.  I can't handle the smell or the texture or the flavour.  So if you're serving to someone who hates onions, that's it.    Now, on to other meals that bacon would suck with.  I really tried here.  I thought of EVERY other vegetable, bean and legume imaginable to find something that's not good with bacon.  I give up.  I am really high, so I asked  Twitter.  I'll be back soon with answers from around the baconsphere.    Bacon in milk is kinda bad.  You really need to get all the fat out, and that's not easy.  I've put it in every type of breakfast cereal, just because, and I love the flavor, especially with Cocoa Pebbles or Crispix!  But, it does leave a little grease in your mouth, and that tastes really weird with milk.  Maybe it's just me."

You realize that this applies to everyone who sells the damn stuff, right? The reason for the price jumps over the last few years is the weird cult following that has sprung up around bacon. They know everyone loves the stuff so much they can charge whatever the hell they want, and people will PAY.   I don't think we can/should give up bacon or anything, but the more we go around buying bacon bandaids and bacon sweatshirts and whatnot, the more the meat packing plants and companies realize they have us by the short hairs, and will keep kicking the price of bacon heavenward.   Maybe, instead of trying to give up bacon, we should just go back to enjoying it like normal human beings and stop talking about it so much."
Bacon,37rpwu,ohhbacon,1 point,Sun May 31 17:49:45 2015 UTC,"I definitely realize that, I was pointing out the irony of this person's video because of that. I'm with you on the nonsensical stuff, but I used to get a chuckle out of that same junk at one point. Personally I won't stop talking about loving bacon, I have not changed how much I talk about it in the last nearly 30 years and I see no reason to change just because it's become a fad. Like other fads it will wain in popularity when something else comes along everyone latches onto. The prices have primarily increased due to the decrease in supply though, people talking about bacon bandaids isn't a big enough contributing factor in that regard, imo. If you have any facts to support otherwise I'll concede."
Bacon,37rpwu,BeanXX,1 point,Sun May 31 18:59:47 2015 UTC,"I admit, I don't have any direct pork farming figures to support that. But, I do have some numbers on Chicken farming. I won't bore you with the details, but suffice it to say, given the sudden, meteoric rise in the consumption of chicken, and the subsequent rise in production, we shouldn't really have any concerns about devastating the population anytime soon.   Similarly. I don't think there's any realistic expectation on a pork shortage anytime soon. Even if some areas of the world are adversely affected, others will pick up the slack. If you need a 'case in point', just look at all the mad cow scares we've had in recent years. But Beef hasn't become particularly rare, has it?   I mean, if you can find figures to support the idea that a pork shortage is driving the prices up, I will also concede, but to me it seems more likely that this fad is inflating demand for the product to the point where the producers feel confident in jacking up the price, because people will pay."
Bacon,37rpwu,ohhbacon,1 point,Sun May 31 23:27:40 2015 UTC,"After a quick google search of why have bacon prices increased I found this article at the top of the list:  http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2014/08/05/bacon-prices-rise-to-new-all-time-high/  Seems to indicate the pork epidemic, drought, and demand as the three main contributing factors. None of which points to the fad of bacon related merchandise. It really is a market trying to make money off the fact that there is an increase in the popularity of the meat itself, not the other way round. Supply and demand will always be the determining factors in pricing, and when they are not you'll find a failed product, of which bacon is not.  Edit: Slightly more recent article supports previous report, but I couldn't find anything more current than these.

Put bacon in frying pan. Put on highest heat, once grease starts to come out and edges are cooked (NOT middle), flip them over and reduce the heat by about a fourth, so you're using about 3/4ths of the max heat. Wait for the small grease bubbles (as you can see in the bacon picture) to come out of the bacon and keep flipping over to cook evenly and take out as soon as it becomes golden"
Bacon,36x5j4,wirbolwabol,1 point,Sat May 23 00:01:44 2015 UTC,I'm usually on half heat and flip it about 4 times through the process. Pretty much nail it as well.

Right away that sounds like a bad idea, because the quality of lootcrate has declined rapidly since its debut.  Also the fact that meme related businesses don't sound like a great idea at all."
Bacon,36j3in,boredcanadian,1 point,Thu May 21 01:54:20 2015 UTC,"A little birdie told me that product curation and quality are one of Narwhal Bacon Box's primary objectives.   As far as ""meme related"" goes, I get the impression ... from that little birdie ... that products are not only based on popular reddit content and viral internet media, but also on popular internet culture. Bob from Network World didn't have a great grasp on the service or product when he wrote that.   :)  I believe the Bacon Box guys know that redditors are super critical and sometimes picky. A box of plastic knickknacks and fake dog crap isn't going to cut it."

Bacon,36acum,fahzbehn,1 point,Mon May 18 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"Its really easy to make. Set your oven to 375 and get a baking sheet. Mix equal parts brow sugar and sriracha in a bowl. You want the mixture thin enough to be able to spread on the bacon but not to thin that it won't stick.   Lay out your bacon on the baking sheet, I put tinfoil down it makes for easier clean up. Brush the mixture on both sides of the bacon and put it in the oven.  Now depending on your bacon it should take about 15 to 20 mins per side to cook. Just keep an eye on it because it can go from almost done to burnt pretty fast."

Bacon,33f4ja,muhaski,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:44:26 2015 UTC,"Most likely a farmers market, or a butcher that sells slab bacon (unsliced bacon).  Then you can slice it your own to the desired thickness.  Your other option would be to cure your own pork belly (about a week long process), then smoke it yourself, but I'm not sure if your set up for that.  By the way I'm going to Athens, Santorini, and Naxos next Thursday.  Any suggestions?"

Bacon,32oklc,Barcade,3,Wed Apr 15 13:54:05 2015 UTC,"Ate this at a chinesse restaurant in Montreal.  I saw it before called ""twice cooked pork"", thay call it ""braised pork belly"" or something simmilar. Basicaly that take a piece of raw bacon 'not smoked or nitrified"" and deep fry it. They then braise it slowly for hours.  the final product does not offer the crispiness we all expect but it gains a ""melt in you mouth"" that is well worth the try. Even though the slices are thicker than theaverage bacon slice the fat just melts in your mouth while delivering incredible flavor."
Bacon,32oklc,truBlaze6691,6,Wed Apr 15 14:03:20 2015 UTC,this is not twice cooked pork. twice cooked pork is cooked pork belly sliced up and cooked again in a stir fry with veggies. this is braised pork belly with preserved vegetables

They're not cupcakes as they don't use any of the traditional cake methods such as the creaming method, the reverse creaming method, the genoise method, the chiffon method, and so on.  They're not muffins as they don't use the muffin method (combining the wet ingredients in one bowl, and the dry ingredients in another bowl, then combining the two quickly with minimal mixing).  They use pre-made biscuit dough and just put them in a muffin/cupcake tin. Not being muffins or cupcakes, they are still much closer to muffins based on their texture.  I know you called them cupcakes because the people who made the blog post you linked to called them cupcakes, but I just felt like dropping a knowledge bomb. Hope someone can learn from this :)"

They are used to soak up moisture and prolong shelf life if you are keeping it out in the open, like say in a deli case. It also imparts a crispy texture and great pairing flavour when cooked. Now a days, a lot of people substitute cornmeal, it works almost as well.  As for the cherry... My original recipe calls for maple syrup in the brining solution. I used cherry ice cream topping in its place. It works great."

Bacon,2zvqd2,OneEyeWillE,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:32:58 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer.  Extra bacon=extra fat creating a poor of bacon fat essentially you were frying bacon at 500 degrees and that'll burn anything at 15 mins. I mean to deep fat fry bacon which works great if u watch it very closely, drop it in a fryer at 350 and cook it for maybe a min and a half two. It'll look undercooked and rubbery, have no fear, let it hang in the basket a min and the residual heat and fat will crisp it right up after sitting for a couple. If u cook it till it looks cooked in the fryer it'll b gnarley"
Bacon,2zvqd2,keto_does_it_4_me,3,Tue Mar 24 10:24:54 2015 UTC,"Dude, dude, dude... oh no, this is an horrible sight, burnt bacon. My condoleances.  Here is a time-tested bacon cooking recipe:  1) Do not pre-heat the oven.  2) The smoke point of lard is 370°F. Never, ever go above that temperature. You are killing that greasy goodness.  3) Lay your bacon strips in a pan, on parchment paper.  4) Put pan in cold oven, set to 325°F  5) Leave in for 20-22 minutes, up to 30 minutes for nasty, fatty bacon (my favorite). It is ready when you start to have brown striations on the top side.  6) some people like to flip, I don't  7) 350°F also works, but it is less forgiving. After hundreds of trials, I always come back to 325°F. Find what works best for you, the temperature sensor can be off by as much as 50°F on some ovens."

Bacon,2zvqd2,autowikibot,2,Wed Mar 25 03:08:13 2015 UTC,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_point
Bacon,2zvqd2,silverwarbler,1 point,Wed Mar 25 08:18:37 2015 UTC,"Smoke point:       In cooking, the smoke point of an oil or fat is the temperature at which, under defined conditions, enough volatile compounds emerge from the oil that a bluish smoke becomes clearly visible. At this temperature, volatile compounds, such as water, free fatty acids, and short-chain degradation products of oxidation come up from the oil. The smoke point is the temperature at which the oil is decomposed and where possibly toxicological relevant compounds are formed. [citation needed]  The smoke point for an oil varies widely depending on origin and refinement.  The smoke point of an oil does tend to increase as free fatty acid content decreases and degree of refinement increases.   Heating the oil produces free fatty acid and as this heating time increases, more free fatty acids are produced, thereby decreasing smoke point. It is one reason not to use the same oil to deep fry more than twice.  Intermittent frying has a markedly greater effect on oil deterioration than continuous frying.   Considerably above the temperature of the smoke point is the flash point, the point at which the vapours from the oil can first ignite when mixed with air.

Bacon,2yod85,snyderjw,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:44:35 2015 UTC,"Not sure what your truck is equipped with, but when I used to cook at restaurants, we'd buy the best non-frozen bacon possible and then throw it in the deep fryer for a few minutes per order. This takes only a few minutes, produces a good quality product, and doesn't take up precious grill/griddle space.  If you don't have a fryer in your truck, there aren't a ton of alternatives that I know of to produce quick and quality bacon. If you truly care about the quality of your bacon/sandwiches, which it sounds like you do, sometimes you gotta bite the bullet and par cook it on the flat top and push it to a cooler spot until it's ready to finish for a order. It's messy and time consuming, but it will help season your cooktop.... so you could have that going for ya, which is nice."

And, in my opinion, it tastes better and has better texture than the pre-coooked stuff. I will add though, that it's better to go with a thicker cut of bacon if you go the fryer route."
Bacon,2yod85,D00zer,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:36:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've heard all that before.  Now let's get into science.  The reason bacon is so delicious is because of the fat.  When you submerge the bacon in hot oil, all the fat leeches out.  When you use a flat or a pan, it cooks in its own juice.  Deep fried bacon is essiently carbon :(  I have never, in my professional cooking career spanning continents and years, encountered a kitchen that thought it was ok to deep fry bacon.  In fact, that is a dumbass offense and one warning.  IMO, basically a fireable offense for making shitty product to sell to customers.  You wanna know how to kill your business?  Deep fry bacon."

Bacon,2vglv7,drsweets333,2,Wed Feb 11 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"I made these a few weeks ago and my memory is a bit hazy, so excuse the general vagueness.   Essentially, I coated the bacon with dark maple syrup and baked them on a wire rack in the oven at 350F. At two intervals through the cooking process (at approx. 10 and 20 mins into the cooking respectively) I removed the bacon from the oven to apply more syrup, flipping the pieces in the process. On the final coating I ground some salt and pepper onto the pieces (before and after the flip to get both sides). I removed bacon from the oven when the pieces looked optimally delicious. The maple syrup should harden to a candy coating as the bacon cools (10 or so mins).   This is a very simple way to make maple candied bacon and I'd love to see other innovative variations on this theme (for example including additional spices such as dijon mustard and/or cayenne pepper)."

The alcohol will keep it from ever going bad, so no need to store it in the fridge.  It made the best bloody marys ever, I garnished them with a celery stalk and strip of bacon."
Bacon,2u2ntf,ThetruePedobear,7,Thu Jan 29 12:11:09 2015 UTC,"It's better to put it in the freezer, because the fat will freeze but the Vodka won't. And by doing this you only need to filter it once or twice ;)   Well that's how I'm doing it, and ooh yeah I let the bacon stay in the Vodka for 3 weeks before doing it.. 1 week if it's bourbon whiskey ;)"
Bacon,2u2ntf,ThetruePedobear,2,Thu Jan 29 16:29:14 2015 UTC,"I had trouble with the freezer, the fat didnt seperate it just froze into icy chunks throughout the vodka."

Bacon,2u2ntf,OreoBA,2,Thu Jan 29 16:48:11 2015 UTC,Nah man.  Its all about using bacon in creative ways.  If you enjoy bloody marys then this infusion will knock your socks off.  Garnish with celery stalk and bacon strip and its breakfast of champions.  [Edit] plus those 8 slices of bacon infused a whole 5th of vodka and that lasted me an entire summer.  I highly suggest trying it

There's not a single chance I'm putting that in vodka when I could be eating it in one of about five dozen ways.  Store bacon? Meh, do whatever you want with it, since it's pretty much inedible anyway. But not actual, real, smoked bacon. Not a chance I'm soaking that in fucking vodka."

Bacon,2s7nxz,MexicanaPerfecta,1 point,Tue Jan 13 18:23:00 2015 UTC,"It's difficult, in my experience at least, to make bowls out of the thick cut stuff with any device. And I don't mean like Hormel Black label thick... I mean like actual thick... 1/4 of an inch type stuff. Then again, that's the type of bacon that I just cook and eat. Not using it for flavor or serving vessel, just straight bacon goodness."
Bacon,2s7nxz,D00zer,2,Tue Jan 13 18:58:49 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, at that point it's just eating bacon. I usually use the kroger brand thick cut for my bowls. The regular is way too thin and the thick cut you are talking about is way too good to be made into a bowl, plus it probably wouldn't cook as well. Kroger brand is right in the middle which is perfect for doing stuff like this..."

Bacon,2rpa98,Tomasfoolery,2,Thu Jan 8 02:55:48 2015 UTC,"Removing skin is a time consuming and frustrating task.   Not, not really.  Leave it on when you smoke the bellies. Then let it rest for about 45 minutes on a cooling rack, skin side up. Slice just a tiny bit of a corner off and using a paper towel, just pull the skin off.  It'll easily come off in one sheet. And another bonus is the skin itself will come off, leaving the fat attached to the meat. You want that fat on your bacon, not on a piece of skin you throw away. (You basically cut off and threw away a lot of flavor.)  Now the bonus here is that you'll have smoked pork skin. You can fry it, cut it into strips for the dog, put sections of in stew like you would a hamhock, flavor beans, etc. It freezes very very well if tightly wrapped.  There's no reason whatsoever to remove the skin before smoking. No reason and wasteful as well. The skin is good stuff, too."
Bacon,2rpa98,wee0x1b,1 point,Thu Jan 8 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"When I wet cure, I leave the skin on.  But with a hand rub, I've discovered that the skin side is nothing but cold because it doesn't take a rub.  Hardly any spice flavor at all.  Sure, it's that fatty goodness, but to be honest, I much prefer to remove the skin when rubbing with hands.  To me, dry rub bacon and wet cure bacon are two different animals entirely.    Like american bacon versus canadian bacon, that's how severe the difference is to me.  You are right though - a lot of fat and meat got cut off."
Bacon,2rpa98,wee0x1b,2,Thu Jan 8 18:40:44 2015 UTC,There's a lot of flavor on the skin-on belly.  I dry cure as well. It comes out like this: http://i.imgur.com/IopHP.jpg

Bacon,2rpa98,wee0x1b,1 point,Thu Jan 8 19:25:12 2015 UTC,"Good luck with the cure and (assuming) smoke. I suggest you get a better knife or sharpen the one you have properly. the skin is much easier and faster to remove with a proper cutting utensil. Also, you know how when you were rubbing the rub into the meat and more of that shit stuck to your hands than the belly? Wear latex or nitrile gloves, the rub doesn't like to stick to them as much as your hands."
Bacon,2rpa98,wee0x1b,2,Thu Jan 8 13:02:17 2015 UTC,"the skin is much easier and faster to remove with a proper cutting utensil   It's much, much, much easier to remove after smoking. It just tears off, by hand, leaving all the fat still attached to the meat. And then you have smoked pork skin. Which is very tasty indeed."

Yet still:  The cow is as far as I know, universally sacred to the Hindu traditions. Furthermore, Hindus are mostly supposed to be vegetarians according to their traditions. However, some warrior castes are permitted to eat meat or something (saw it in a documentary).  And even after that, most Hindus I know near me eat meat for some reason. But they all have their own weird little rules- like no meat on Friday or something. Then there are a few who are pure vegetarian.  Also some Sikh institutions are against eating meat, which is weird... since I don't know any vegetatian Sikhs. Sikhism developed by blending Hindu and Islamic elements.    tl;dr Hindus can't eat bacon, but they can, but some do anyway."

You take a sour dough bread loaf and cut it long ways and then cut short ways but not all the way through. Then stick a slice of cheese and what looks like Canadian bacon in between each little slice and then bake. I made it with Colby jack and then cut of chives and melt butter and pour that over the top and bake.

I'd say the biggest differences are that it's leaner and the strips are a bit more substantial... dare I say, more beefy. In my experience, I think it is harder to cook beef bacon and get my desired result of being a cross between chewy and crispy. I found baking worked better than pan frying.  I'd take boar or duck bacon over beef though, but it's definitely worth trying. It's still cured smoked meat, and you can't go wrong with that unless you over or undercook it."

A bit on the tough side, but extremely tasty.  Would be great cut thin with cheese and crackers.  Use slabs of pork shoulder instead of belly to get a leaner bacon, with a slightly different taste."

Bacon,2me9je,Grimmner,2,Sun Nov 16 17:51:53 2014 UTC,"I was able to obtain some apple syrup at a threshing bee; I used that as part of my sugar source when curing the bacon.  Not certain how to make Apple Syrup, unfortunately.  It's not as sweet as honey, and can actually be a bit tart.  Gives the bacon a very nice flavor, however; you can really taste the apple, more so than just smoking with apple I've found."

I keep seeing it on Reddit and I can't do anything about it. I grew up in NM, but all of the internet sites that sell it might as well be organized crime. If I could get a beef stuffed sopapilla from Little Anita's, along with a burger from Blake's Lotaburger  (I have no idea why they have NYC in their background picture), topped with Hatch chile, I could die a happy man. I grew up in Albuquerque, but the only thing I miss is the food. Keep the desert, keep all of the rest of it, but send some of that great NM food up to Washington state. That's all this dieing man asks. And by dieing, we're all dieing. But without this food, I'm just dieing a little quicker."
