LinusTechTips does something similar with a different platform, buts its only something like a 24 hour preview, and I'm assuming they're trying this out with a less popular Polaris show: Table Flip.  Table Flip isn't really Game Grumps is it? I always considered that and Kitty Kat Gaming completely separate because they are traditionally hosted on other websites or channels even if they include people who work on Game Grumps.

normalboots,3cxvc0,Holyrapid,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:12:16 2015 UTC,"It might not be ""concrete"", but it's far more then just a name:   In Final Fantasy VII, the main catalyst of the games events, and the organization considered by some to be the actual main antagonist is the Shin-Ra Electric Power Company. It uses the Lifestream, the planets life force, to create an energy source known as Mako. Mako is then used to fuel the great cities all over the planet.  In Final Fantasy X-2, close to the end of the game, there is a cutscene that can be activated by talking to a young Al Bhed boy. The boy's name is Shinra, and when asked what he is doing his response is shocking. He says that he is researching something he calls the planet's life force. He then goes on to say that it would be possible to harness the energy and use it to fuel cities. This causes the main characters to get very excited at the idea, however he cautions that it would take ""generations"".   Source"

He didn't mention that it's considerably easier than a lot of the classic series (or at least I didn't notice it), aside from that stupidly difficult final boss. Still a very good game, just different."
normalboots,3c1cfm,FYININJA,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:34:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly never understood the hate for 7. It's got my favorite sprites, a great soundtrack, the level design is awesome, and it's just generally a really fun game."
normalboots,3c1cfm,ElCrowing,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:02:26 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not as...tight as the previous games. Like, the level designs are fine, it's not poorly designed, but the Megaman games were always super tight. Megaman was pretty small, the courses were designed with one screen at a time, so each individual screen felt more...impactful.  7 became a sort of mid-point between X's ""open"" levels and the Classic series ""Course"" levels. The two series are pretty distinct despite being similar, 7 is a bit of a blend between the two. Slower than X, but a lot faster than the classic series.   People wanting Megaman X were kinda disapointed with it's more cartoony, less serious atmosphere (and it's lack of speed), people wanting classic megaman were probably put off by it's relative ease and more focused and open levels.  I agree it got way more hate than it deserved, it's a perfectly fine game, but at the time I can understand the hate for it. X was such a fantastic game that following it up was rough. 7 was slower, generally uglier...X just did a better job at being a SNES game."

Even fucking CoD exclusive DLC is somehow a WIN FOR SONY, for fuck's sake..."
normalboots,3a08xy,gribnoysup,19,Tue Jun 16 09:49:02 2015 UTC,"I thought it was EA he thought was shit? He didn't mind Microsoft's conference, just wasn't excited by their games."

normalboots,3a08xy,gribnoysup,-1,Wed Jun 17 09:15:56 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from. Xbox gave their fans everything they wanted and then some, while sony had to have a kickstarter for one of their games. Seems like he's playing favorites."
normalboots,3a08xy,sargentsuicide,3,Tue Jun 16 20:05:48 2015 UTC,"Well the general consensus is that Sony had the better conference, but that doesn't mean Microsoft's one was bad!"
normalboots,3a08xy,Spruxy,0,Tue Jun 16 20:32:03 2015 UTC,"But I don't understand how it was better. I understand no-one said microsoft's was bad but it's a reviewers job to be non-biased. His entire bit on microsoft was just that he just didn't like halo and stuff. I don't like Final Fantasy or shenmue or any of the JRPG's on playstation but all I've seen that could have pushed them past microsoft was shenmue. I'm not a fan but I could see the passion. Unfortunately they had to put up a kickstarter for some reason which is really odd to announce at e3. Also, most of sony's stuff was multiplatform anyway."
normalboots,3a08xy,sargentsuicide,3,Tue Jun 16 20:43:45 2015 UTC,"Some fair points, and I have both consoles so if I wanted to I could be impartial but the thing about Sony's conference was that, on top of having great games, it felt like a show. The conference itself was majorly entertaining and the fact that they also announced two games which were basically considered dead could get anyone hyped! Personally, I've never cared whether or not The Last Guardian is launched or not because it's not really my thing... But when they announced it I felt the same amount of excitement as anyone in that audience because what the game is and what it represented, which is genuine fan service from one of the major gaming companies.  Jared could be impartial if he were an IGN or Gamespot employee, but like he says in all of his top and bottom 5's of the year, everything he does on his channel is down to his own personal preference."
normalboots,3a08xy,Spruxy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I think he was too indifferent toward the microsoft conference and for him to open the sony one by flailing his arms saying that sony won is a bit fanboyish. I don't fault him for that, it's just a bit disappointing to see him act so biased. Honestly, I think bethesda won the whole thing but microsoft did an outstanding job, and so did sony for that matter."
normalboots,3a08xy,sargentsuicide,4,Tue Jun 16 21:30:23 2015 UTC,"No doubt it's been the best E3 for quite a while. Personally I'd rank it (for how hyped I felt after each one):   Sony Bethesda Microsoft Nintendo EA   But hey, that's my personal opinion!  / also, no idea who's downvoting you for having an opinion. It's not me in case you wondered!"
normalboots,3a08xy,Spruxy,2,Tue Jun 16 22:35:35 2015 UTC,I know. It's probably some disgruntled fan. He can get over it by having his petty revenge and not saying anything.
normalboots,3a08xy,sargentsuicide,2,Tue Jun 16 23:05:08 2015 UTC,Some people ay.
normalboots,3a08xy,Spruxy,2,Tue Jun 16 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Exactly!  I'm not saying that Sony conf. was bad or something, and I'm really excited to hear about FF7 (although a little bit scared because it's THIS square enix will be working on it). But all this hands swinging and ""Sony wins"" screaming?  And what was the point of covering microsoft conference in 20 minute video if you don't care about it? Its not objective at all and this really bothers me because I love Jared's videos and I want to see him as a good, objective critic"

normalboots,37vwmn,NormalBootsBot,8,Sat May 30 21:02:45 2015 UTC,"My only real question is does the game have staying power. Multiplayer only games need something to keep a lot of players entertained, if they can't keep a good number of players, the community will die, and it'll go the way of games like Monday night combat."
normalboots,37vwmn,FYININJA,2,Sun May 31 06:07:56 2015 UTC,"Frequent (free) dlc should help that. They already announced 4 new maps and almost 10 nee weapons, so there are incentives to keep the game alive. It is kinda weird that they didn't include this in launch though, since splatoon is kinda light on the content right now."
normalboots,37vwmn,biranqu,2,Sun May 31 08:24:45 2015 UTC,"That's nice. I'm just wary of trusting Nintendo to support a multiplayer exclusive game that isn't a party game. They just haven't dealt with that kind of stuff before, and it's something that has ruined a lot of multiplayer exclusive games that were otherwise pretty fun. MNC is my favorite example, it was a super fun game, but they just couldn't keep players playing it. Then they switched to Super Monday Night Combat, they added lots of content consistently, but it wasn't engaging enough to keep players interested, and it died pretty quickly. It's important to keep the initial flow of players entertained long enough to get a community going. I've not played the game, and it looks interesting, but I'm not going to purchase it unless I know it's going to be something like Team Fortress 2 that I'll be able to play for a few years on and off."
normalboots,37vwmn,FYININJA,2,Sun May 31 16:30:50 2015 UTC,"There's also a single player campaign, although it's very simplistic. All it really is is a series of challenge maps/obstacle courses with enemies and stuff. It basically presents lore and backstory to the game, and you can unlock notes that tell you the story of this big war between squids and octopuses."

I myself have stopped watching TotalBiscuit after he said a bunch of transphobic shit recently, fortunately I never liked his videos all that much so stopping my support wasn't too hard. It'd probably be enormously hard for me to just stop watching PBG or ProJared though if they came out and said something transphobic (which, I sincerely hope they wouldn't) and in the end I might just end up continuuing watching their videos, even if I hated that they were transphobic, just because I love their content so much. I know it's not really the same, because you're actually watching these people talk for large amounts of time instead of just eating food that is made by some employees who probably don't even share the same opinions as their higher-ups, but yeah.

normalboots,33iq4p,Lyingfigure,4,Thu Apr 23 03:05:49 2015 UTC,ASMR are tracks using repeated sound effects or smooth comforting voices that you can listen to as you go to sleep. They're designed to be incredibly relaxing at their base level. Some are designed to implant thoughts or ideas into your head as you sleep.   Visit /r/asmr and have a look around!

You were supposed to lay down and listen to them with your eyes closed. They had names like ""Armageddon"", ""A-bomb"" and ""Rainbow"". I Only tried it once, and felt whoozy afterwards."

Of course everyone reacts differently to this stuff, I personally respond very well, but other people might get nothing or might have bad experiences, though they're rare.   Thankfully ASMR is fairly harmless, certainly not as full on as auricular hallucinogenics so I suggest you give it a go :P"

Paul lives in Philly which is around and hour or 2 away, but Dominic moved to L.A. Also, Michael Azzi does the animation for the intro and pixel art. That requires a bunch of time as well.   On top of each person having their own life, they would then have to coordinate to draft the episodes together. If it's anything like most writing sessions, it works best when they set themselves in a room together for a long period and spit-ball with each other while they construct the narrative. Then figure out which shots and content will be needed etc.   How long do you suspect a multi-million view production to take exactly?  Also, nobody knows when he'll post. Also, publishing a schedule to the viewers tends to just make people freak out when something's not on time. How could they possibly know how long each episode will take to produce when episodes draw on such varying content (movies, old games, new stuff, strange consoles, etc). There is so much to do between getting the idea and creating the product.  Anyways... no one knows. It's basically free entertainment and we shouldn't be pushy about it."

It was shitty when it first came out and it's shitty now.  Hopefully this video helps in reducing the amount of dumb asses trying to claim that it was/is a good sonic game.  I do love the Sonic/Shadow levels, but they are by no means good Sonic levels.   The Sonic games for the GBA and DS are the true MVP's of the sonic franchise."
normalboots,32xom2,Ninjabackwards,1 point,Sat Apr 18 06:29:18 2015 UTC,"He mentioned the bad camera, but there's one level in particular that uses the camera to fuck you up: Hidden Base.

normalboots,32xom2,King_Dead,-1,Fri Apr 17 18:25:47 2015 UTC,Is it really fair to complain about the camera? All 3D platformers at the time had shitty cameras. Remember Super Mario 64? Everyone jerks that game off as one of the best game ever made despite the camera.
normalboots,32xom2,PetevonPete,9,Fri Apr 17 19:45:27 2015 UTC,Probably because Mario 64 was one of the first 3d games and pioneered most of the features. The camera didn't really exist at that point and Nintendo basically had to create the concept. 5 years later Sonic Adventure 2 should probably not have a camera of the same quality.
normalboots,32xom2,UnusualBadger,3,Fri Apr 17 20:07:06 2015 UTC,Super Mario 64 also benefits from Mario being slower than Sonic.   A broken camera may work better following an italian plumber doing somersaults rather than an anthropomorphic hedgehog that likes to go off rolling around at the speed of sound.
normalboots,32xom2,JoeyGlowey,2,Sat Apr 18 05:23:15 2015 UTC,"I think all cameras were equally shitty until we invented controllers with two joysticks. I mean, how were they going to fix the camera control problem in Adventure 2? They were out of buttons on the Dreamcast controller."

normalboots,31x40m,SuperEnd123,2,Thu Apr 9 02:16:34 2015 UTC,Yeah it's kinda bothering me how much the hardcore seriess have been moving towards minimal camera switching. It makes it harder to follow the interesting things.
normalboots,31x40m,mrrobopuppy,2,Thu Apr 9 08:00:11 2015 UTC,"I've watched mostly all of them and this is usually the case isn't it? The camera usually only switches between 2 or 3 people, and mostly it's on PBG."

normalboots,31o6y1,selib,2,Mon Apr 6 21:34:38 2015 UTC,"Perhaps we should call him ProPeebins and then just ""Jared"", because we can clearly see who has more poke-skillz (really it was just that Jared never had a Gyrados with ice fang to destroy altaria, probably because he had a lombre and didn't want to have a common weakness, but still) (PB)GG."

But it seems every episode I listen to is about Vaginacock the Orc with a Bonerpoop sword who fights hoards of slutty wizard zombies or something.  Its kinda low-brow and disjointed. Not my kind of humor at all."
