chelseafc,3e32a4,wittycyberdesigners,24,Tue Jul 21 16:25:27 2015 UTC,The 21-year-old forward will continue his development by spending next season on loan at Crystal Palace.   Brilliant.
chelseafc,3e32a4,mtowle182,8,Tue Jul 21 16:08:09 2015 UTC,"Even though it was hanging in the air, I'm still delighted to read this. English talent like Bamford is rare and I'm happy for Chelsea to sign him for atleast 3 more years.   Also Crystal Palace seems like an excellent choice. I assume under Pardew they won't play for relegation but closer to the midtable. Bamford is a great player to have, if you look who Palace's forwards are."
chelseafc,3e32a4,delusional-thomas,4,Tue Jul 21 17:29:53 2015 UTC,Even if he doesn't make it at Chelsea he has great resale value down the line with an extended contract
chelseafc,3e32a4,term1001,4,Tue Jul 21 19:29:39 2015 UTC,His comments are very mature as well.  Seems to understand that the only way to get into the team is to prove yourself on sequentially harder loans and it doesn't automatically mean you're being sidelined
chelseafc,3e32a4,elmntguy12,2,Tue Jul 21 21:13:54 2015 UTC,Excellent
chelseafc,3e32a4,RadioRaheem_,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:16 2015 UTC,I seriously think this kid is the future of Chelsea and England... I'm glad the club extended him and can't wait to see how he takes to the Prem.
chelseafc,3e32a4,ddonreddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:51 2015 UTC,"Quite a short deal, but probably the right idea from Bamford's perspective. If in a year/18 months he doesn't look like getting into the Chelsea team he's in a strong position to push for a move away."

chelseafc,3e31i8,zachmo360,19,Tue Jul 21 16:01:03 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see how he does in the EPL! If he does well he can easily slot into our striker rotation next season. Maybe even give Remy a run for the second striker spot!
chelseafc,3e31i8,ur_gonna_get_hop-ons,8,Tue Jul 21 16:18:21 2015 UTC,Not sure if you're under rating Remy or over rating Bamford. Seems to me like it's the latter because there's no way Bamford is going to be 2nd choice for a Chelsea while we are aiming to win the PL and the CL after just one season playing in the top flight.   Remy is too good to lose his spot to a 21 year old come on now.
chelseafc,3e31i8,thegreenmonstuh,5,Tue Jul 21 17:12:22 2015 UTC,It's very very very optimistic to think Bamford could come into our squad next season but remember how well Kane did. You just never know. Hopefully he has a decent season and scores some goals.
chelseafc,3e31i8,awlfjawlfjhlawfhjl,-15,Tue Jul 21 17:21:19 2015 UTC,Please don't compare Chelsea to Spurs.
chelseafc,3e31i8,thegreenmonstuh,13,Tue Jul 21 17:37:30 2015 UTC,Oh fuck off it's reasonable to use an example of another youth player coming to the PL. Nobody is comparing our club to theirs.
chelseafc,3e31i8,awlfjawlfjhlawfhjl,-12,Tue Jul 21 17:51:29 2015 UTC,"How is that reasonable? You can't just completely ignore the context and not consider the aspirations each club has.   Chelsea aim to win the league and the CL year in, year out therefore they can't risk giving raw, unproven youth players big roles and dropping points as a result.  Spurs aim to simply finish in the top 4, they can actually afford giving raw, unproven youth players a chance and dropping points every now and then.   It's two completely different situations, so you're the one that needs to fuck off."

Yeah I absolutely can...he was a youth striker that was very successful in the PL. Bamford is a youth striker entering the PL...   Chelsea aim to win the league and the CL year in, year out therefore they can't risk giving raw, unproven youth players big roles and dropping points as a result.   If Bamford has a season at Palace like Kane did at Spurs he would very likely be in our reserve squad.   Spurs aim to simply finish in the top 4, they can actually afford giving raw, unproven youth players a chance and dropping points every now and then.   This is just way off base. Kane came in and never stopped scoring so they kept playing him. He was only an unproven youth player for a couple games. He also won them a hell of a lot of points.   It's two completely different situations, so you're the one that needs to fuck off.   I think everybody else has made it clear who is wrong."
chelseafc,3e31i8,awlfjawlfjhlawfhjl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:09:27 2015 UTC,Right now there's definitely no disputing the huge gulf in class between Remy and Bamford. But a lot can happen in a year. I'm talking about the literal best case scenario. Like Lukaku at West Brom or Harry Kane level best case. I'd also imagine regardless of his performance he'd come in a similar situation to Zouma and Ivan. Mou said Ivan was originally the first player to replace either JT or Cahill but it became Zouma due to performances.

chelseafc,3e31i8,grey76,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:44 2015 UTC,"The best thing he can do for himself would be to perform well enough to warrant Palace asking for him again in a second season. It'll be difficult for him to break through and score a lot, and based on his previous loans he tends to impress when he's given a second season or so. Adapting here will be hard, so if he can score when they need him, and boost his all-around game...he'll certainly be securing l top-flight status."

Stones doesn't strike me as the person to cause drama, he'd happily stay at Everton or happily come to us but he won't force the issue I reckon. Likeable lad.  I wouldn't say Jose and Martinez have the best working relationship either so that might not help here. Think we'll get him but for £35m plus some serious add ons on top of that.

chelseafc,3e2szm,johnnynohat,5,Tue Jul 21 16:33:59 2015 UTC,This is why you purchase the best players that you can possibly afford.  With competition like this during training it will help to propel each Hazard and Oscar.  It also will elevate everyone else to the level that they are training at.    The same philosophy in signing strong backups.  Begovic for example is a strong enough GK that he can drive Courtois to better levels then if he just had Blackman has his backup.   Ups the intensity and forces everyone to increase the level that they play at.

He was bang on about Turan when a lot of people were saying Chelsea were in for him. He's also said Chelsea are operating under one-in-one-out and all of the noise about players leaving seems to have died down. If Cuadrado goes - and he's only going for the price he came in for - then there's a minor possibility but still, I think this is like most stories that originate on or around social media and just speculation."

chelseafc,3e425l,nixty84,3,Tue Jul 21 20:10:24 2015 UTC,"So it's looking like the squad next season will be the same starting 11 as last season with a bench of Begovic, Baba, Zouma (or Stones?), Mikel, Ramires, Cuadrado, Falcao and Remy."
chelseafc,3e425l,bustedracquet,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"You'd think zouma and stones. And that's assuming Moses is sold, too. It's actually weaker than last season. Our cm and am depth is still poor. Injuries to matic or hazard will crush our season."
chelseafc,3e425l,msbr_,6,Tue Jul 21 20:37:13 2015 UTC,Loftus-Cheek will be playing. We might get Witsel as well. Our bench is weaker (Cech and Luis leaving) but we instead have younger players which is not a bad thing. Cech and Luis want more playing time and Mourinho loves his starting 11. We want to play our youth and complain when we dont spend a lot on big signings.
chelseafc,3e425l,selle123,2,Tue Jul 21 20:47:15 2015 UTC,"Doubt we'll get Witsel, Jose seemed to indicate that once we finish up with defenders (Baba and possibly Stones), that our business is done. He likes the squad the way it is. As for RLC, I think people are overestimating how much he'll be playing. He'll play in Cup matches, and the occasional 5-10 minute cameo when we're up by a few goals, he's still going to be behind Mikel and Ramires in the pecking order."
chelseafc,3e425l,bustedracquet,-4,Tue Jul 21 22:35:12 2015 UTC,Stones...will probably stay at Everton on loan this season if we do sign him up.
chelseafc,3e425l,freemac,5,Tue Jul 21 20:40:38 2015 UTC,"No, he won't"
chelseafc,3e425l,RGD365,3,Tue Jul 21 21:09:31 2015 UTC,"So if we sign Stones and this Baba kid, would anyone care to tell me were we have improved on from the start of last season?  Stones will be a bit part player who improve us every so slightly as we have Zouma, we have lost Filipe Luis for a player whom I believe is not as good as him, Cech gone, Begovic in, downgrade (albeit the best we could of hoped for). We have Cuadrado who hasn't fitted in and hasnt had a preseason to fix this as apposed to Schurrle who scored goals.  Salah has gone and Moses has come back, that to me, is an upgrade.  Falcao in for Drogba, we have lost 2 major players from our dressing room in the last year and Falcao who has been awful for 12 months with no signs of improvement in the Copa America.  Not being funny, and I am saying this as more fact than anything else, but seriously, where have we actually IMPROVED? If all we buy is these 2 defenders. And why is it that I believe the biggest upgrade is having a goalscorer like Moses come in for Salah. If this is all we end up with I will be furiously pissed off. We will of fallen into the trap that every league winner has. And don't come back to me with bollocks like ""There is no one available"" There is people available for the right price."
chelseafc,3e425l,jmsspr94,5,Tue Jul 21 21:03:48 2015 UTC,This. We need a cm and rw or am. We are weaker than before where we flopped out of the cl at the round of arsenal.
chelseafc,3e425l,msbr_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:12:15 2015 UTC,Wut?  No we don't.  Oscar has a break finally after all these years and i expect he would take this season by storm.  William and fab can also play AM.  rlc grow another year and we got Moses and Traore in.  Hopefully with a pre season cuadrado would be better as well.  We have a young team.  Another year means we are already stronger.  The only position we have gotten weaker in is GK but you can't really replace Cech anyway and Begovic is no slouch.
chelseafc,3e425l,TimYoung,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:12:16 2015 UTC,"We didnt lose in the CL because of not having a ""cm and rw or am"". we lost to PSG because of tactics (or the team not attacking like Mourinho said). If we didnt park the bus and actually pressed going out to score we would have won the game.   Across midfield we have Cesc, Matic, RLC, Ramires, Mikel.  Attacking positions: Traore, Cuadrado, Hazard, Oscar, Willian, Remy if need be and Cesc if need be.  If you think some of those players arent good enough then thats another issue, but they should be replaced (the generic response is Ramires and Mikel). If not then we already have good depth."
chelseafc,3e425l,Boonsquemador,2,Tue Jul 21 22:27:48 2015 UTC,"We improved by keeping our team.  Fact is if you asked me if we could improve our first team squad, I would struggle to think of anyone I'll like to swap.  We have a pretty young team considering the prime age is like 28 and an extra year means even without changes our team would be better.  Mourinho likes a small squad and we struggled last year at times because the age profile of our team is lower than the usual ages Mourinho likes to have.  I haven't been this happy with our squad in ages.  It just shows how complete our team is when we are only talking about the second string.  Of course we could always do with more depth.  But Mourinho likes to keep a small squad is because it keeps the team happy and boost morale.  I wouldn't worry about Falcao who is potentially our third team player.  If he doesn't do it, it's fine..  If he does we benefit."
chelseafc,3e425l,TimYoung,2,Tue Jul 21 22:04:39 2015 UTC,"Cech gone, Begovic in, downgrade (albeit the best we could of hoped for)   you're acting like having 2 top 5 goalkeepers on a team is standard, we were unbelievably lucky to have cech ride the bench for courtois last season. Having begovic as a backup is still on par or better than every other champions league team."
chelseafc,3e425l,PandaWrestler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:29:49 2015 UTC,So this pretty mch confirms Baba Rahman because Mourinho wouldn't let Luis leave unless he was confident he'd be able to replace him.

chelseafc,3e255z,bustedracquet,35,Tue Jul 21 11:11:35 2015 UTC,"Basically, we have every incentive to sell Salah to Roma. Roma are trying to get Salah as one of their non-EU players, but if they can't get him, then they will turn their attention to Baba Rahman. We supposedly have an agreement with Baba Rahman to be our replacement for Filipe Luis, but he's probably waiting to see if Roma goes for him because he'd get more playing time there.   Since Roma can't buy both, here's to hoping that we sell Salah to Roma, so we can get our man who Jose must rate if he's willing to let Luis go."
chelseafc,3e255z,msbr_,4,Tue Jul 21 11:15:42 2015 UTC,Excellent explanation. Sounds good for both parties.

chelseafc,3e255z,zachmo360,8,Tue Jul 21 15:30:31 2015 UTC,"I can't say I've seen much of Baba but I really hope he is already a very good player and not just a talent. What's slightly worrying for me is not the lack of transfers, but the fact our squad is weaker than it was last season; Luis to Baba and Cech to Begovic. Would've loved to see us bring in Gaya from Valencia, although costly, he could really give a chance for Azpi on the right. Hopefully I'm an idiot for doubting this signing anyway and Baba proves a great addition."
chelseafc,3e255z,DorothyJMan,16,Tue Jul 21 15:30:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think our squad is weaker than last year. Cech to Begovic is a downgrade sure, but not a huge one, and Falcao is an upgrade on Drogba (despite what a lot of people think, at least Falcao can press). Plus we've added RLC, Traore and potentially Moses to add depth, I reckon it's a more solid squad than before."
chelseafc,3e255z,bluesbruin3,2,Tue Jul 21 13:01:25 2015 UTC,"Baba is not as proven as Luis was, however, he lead BuLi in tackles per match last season, and was Augsburg's most consistent defender. He's also young(23 I think?), so he has even more time to improve. He may not be as complete as Filipe Luis is/was, but this is a good move considering he still has a lot of potential to get better.  Edit: He's 21, so definitely not a finished product."
chelseafc,3e4848,42nexus,6,Tue Jul 21 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"There is not even a quote from Mourinho. I dont think that we should panic.  The club wants to play youth so we should give them that chance now since we have a settled team. We should not focus on BIG names, that is not what wins titles. Playing as a team does that and we have a good squad who Mourinhos trusts and he can count on. We really should not panic."
chelseafc,3e4848,selle123,0,Tue Jul 21 21:31:32 2015 UTC,"This, we can either be like City and United, who just splash out on old, known players, or promote and sign young exciting players who we can form to be Chelsea material.

We don't need a central defender by any stretch of the imagination, and surely not one we would most likely loan since he wouldn't get much game time.  Our backup for Fabregas and Matic is Ramires and Mikel, that isn't exactly the depth we are looking for. And Oscar has no backup whatsoever. Midfield is a much weaker area for us in comparison to defense. The only defender that might become a necessity is a LB, if Luis leaves to Atletico."
chelseafc,3e000r,kygrtj,19,Mon Jul 20 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"Fabregas, Willian and even Cuadrado can play in Oscar's spot."

We had no adequate replacement for him and it showed."
chelseafc,3e000r,kygrtj,11,Mon Jul 20 22:54:59 2015 UTC,"Bullshit, so you counted Ivanovic for CB despite he also being a starter but don't want to count Fabregas and Willian for that reason? Fabregas can play at CAM and Ramires can take his place as a CM, or Willian can play as CAM and Cuadrado or Ramires as RM, even Cuadrado can play there, he's not wasted at that position, he can play almost anywhere in attack, he can even play RB for god's sake, just because he has been dissapointing for Chelsea don't come with that bullshit just because you haven't seen him play with any other team."
chelseafc,3e000r,DrYaguar,3,Tue Jul 21 03:20:37 2015 UTC,I like how you're trying to tell a colombian where Cuadrado can or cannot play lmao
chelseafc,3e000r,Rider_0n_The_Storm,5,Tue Jul 21 11:19:33 2015 UTC,"I think you have valid reason. At the moment, center backs is not the our most pressing issue. Even Jose mentioned that. What we need is a CM or even CAM. Someone that can help us keep possession. But, buying a player like Stones would set us up for the next decade. If we don't sign him now, he would be more expensive in the coming seasons. He should be the player replacing JT when he is done. If we get him, i think he might end up becoming our Captain and the captain of England(in the near future)."
chelseafc,3e000r,TheBlueNomad,6,Mon Jul 20 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"I think you have valid reason. At the moment, center backs is not the our most pressing issue. Even Jose mentioned that   Thank you, exactly. I am not sure why people are trying to make an argument out of this, its simply a fact that our defense is not our weakest area ATM.   But, buying a player like Stones would set us up for the next decade   This is also true. People can't seem to understand that a signing could be a great purchase while still not being a priority. It would be great if we get Stones, and would set up our future, but he should not be our biggest concern right now."
chelseafc,3e000r,kygrtj,3,Mon Jul 20 23:32:27 2015 UTC,"I dont agree that it is a fact at all.  Cahill dipped in form for long periods middle of last year and Terry isn't going to last forever.  When a player age, it comes suddenly.  Look at Cole when he played really well the season before last then suddenly lost his legs.  I am not saying it would happen to Terry but the idea of Cahill Zouma doesnt give me a lot of confidence as they both work best with Terry.  Stone by all account has the leadership quality to be a Terry replacement."
chelseafc,3e000r,TimYoung,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:54:57 2015 UTC,"John Stones can play something like 35 matches, if he comes to Chelsea now. But, i won't be surprised, if we buy him and loan him back to Everton. Especially, if we end up signing someone like Baba Abdul Rahman. Jose clearly knows we have a very small squad, one injury to a key player might disrupt our whole season. I still believe we will sign someone like Witsel. Jose is just playing mind games with the media. He won't risk going into the season without adding key players to our squad. This would be a very tough season to win the League. Almost all the teams have strengthen their squads with some good players. It would be crazy to think that we are a better team than last season after letting go top class players like Luis and Cech."
chelseafc,3e000r,TheBlueNomad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:53:16 2015 UTC,"I think the problem most people are having with what you are saying is the part where you keep saying that we will just loan him back to Everton. If we buy him its to come solidify the squad, yes our defense was strong last year and yes we have the same players but do you really think Terry will be able to fully replicate last year, especially considering that we will make it a priority to dominate in the league as well as champions league. We need a role player like stones to spell Terry or Cahill so that we can rest and not have a massive drop of talent on the field. This is how you create a team that can contend in all competitions every year. Look at the bench for real or barcelona or bayern. They have players that would start in any other team on the bench. We started that trend last year and we are continuing with stones."
chelseafc,3e000r,Blueandwhite23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:18:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said except Oscar's position, don't know why everyone here thinks that we can have 4 high quality CBs and still give Stones and Zouma the games they desperately need. Zouma's playtime last season says it all and I hope we either wait with Stones until next summer or loan him back to Everton."
chelseafc,3e000r,Davetology,2,Tue Jul 21 07:20:24 2015 UTC,Why are you so sure he would be 4th choice?
chelseafc,3e000r,DrYaguar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:52:21 2015 UTC,"Terry and Cahill are our starting defenders. First choice off the bench for rotation is Zouma. He would come in as 4th choice, not understanding why you would think any different."
chelseafc,3e000r,kygrtj,8,Mon Jul 20 22:54:10 2015 UTC,"He might be fourth choice the coming season. But, what about the season after that? Terry would almost be 36. We definitely need a backup. Mourinho has clearly stated that his two main defenders are over 30 and he is expecting to sign Stones as a replacement for the future."
chelseafc,3e000r,balajivanji,5,Mon Jul 20 23:12:15 2015 UTC,"Not to mention Stones would get a great amount of experience playing alongside Terry and others. Terry doesn't have a ton of time left, and Stones is a good option."
chelseafc,3e000r,lampard9,2,Mon Jul 20 23:24:37 2015 UTC,"He might be fourth choice the coming season.   Exactly my point. I am not here to debate anything 2+ years from now, just this season and this window."
chelseafc,3e000r,kygrtj,3,Mon Jul 20 23:18:55 2015 UTC,It's called smart business. If we start shopping for him a year or two from now he might already be snatched up by ManU or something when his potential kicks in and his value skyrockets.
chelseafc,3e000r,xjselman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:42:05 2015 UTC,By the looks of it his value has already skyrocketed. 34 million is a stupid amount for a centre back. It would make him the most expensive purchase for a defender in the premier league.
chelseafc,3e000r,TheGingerLow,2,Tue Jul 21 09:49:23 2015 UTC,I think he is a better option than Zouma. And could potentially beat out Cahill by the end of the season.
chelseafc,3e000r,joepo32,2,Tue Jul 21 02:42:13 2015 UTC,"yes a 4th choice CB should not be priority. However, Terry's replacement SHOULD be a priority. As someone who feels Terry is the most important cog in our team, it is imperitive we get his replacement right. Zuma, Kalas, Christensen and stones, surely something from there must stick. This is an absolute priority man, we are looking to replace one the best players Chelsea has ever seen."
chelseafc,3e000r,Fsgbs,5,Tue Jul 21 03:47:57 2015 UTC,"A few years ago you couldve easily argued that buying a 3rd Choice keeper wasnt a priority. That turned out alright for Chelsea with Courtois. This is buy for the future, not for the current campaign."
chelseafc,3e000r,RedDragons8,5,Mon Jul 20 23:20:31 2015 UTC,"A few years ago you couldve easily argued that buying a 3rd Choice keeper wasnt a priority   It wasn't, and looking back it still was not. We didn't shell out 32million for a keeper, or force ourselves to buy one. We never bought Courtois as a priority purchase. We would have been fine with Cech right now had Courtois not existed or became what he is today.  Please keep in mind what the word ""priority"" actually means."
chelseafc,3e000r,kygrtj,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:22:40 2015 UTC,"Fair enough on your point. But this purchase isnt about an immediate need for the squad, this is long term building and structuring. I see you're saying ""Im not arguing about any thing 2+ years from now, just this season and window."" But thats a bullshit excuse just to invalidate the primary arguements for signing him. Im not saying there are not other, more immediate needs in the squad, but this has a good chance to be a fantastic buy for Chelsea. Our captain wont be here forever, and the fact that he is homegrown is icing on the cake."
chelseafc,3e000r,RedDragons8,0,Mon Jul 20 23:37:00 2015 UTC,But thats a bullshit excuse just to invalidate any other opinion that is not your own.   How did you come to this conclusion? I originally replied to a comment that specifically stated that Stones should be our number 1 objective this transfer window and since then I have been defending my point that while Stones would be great he should not be our top priority this window. Its very simple and no one seems to have really done anything to prove that as wrong.   but this has a good chance to be a fantastic buy for Chelsea.   I am NOT saying that this is false. But it does not make it a priority signing. I really have no idea why people are trying to make this into a debate.   edit: word
chelseafc,3e000r,kygrtj,4,Mon Jul 20 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"Ok, thank you for clarifying. I certainly did not mean to come across as hostile, after all, we are on the same side. Shitposting disengaged"

What on earth are you on about, again? Terry will turn 35 this season, not 29. The reason why I wrote 29+ is because Cahill is yet to turn 30, and you'd get on my ass for semantics. Terry will retire in 1-2 seasons, and we've seen how Cahill's performance levels drop without Terry.  I wish you'd just address the actual point, not just discuss semantics and attacking ad hominem.

He we won't be a starter as well. CB is not our MAIN concern. We can definitely wait till the next transfer window or next season. There isn't any competition from rivals for his signature as far as we know.
chelseafc,3e000r,Fatmanp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:17 2015 UTC,I think it is more of a case that John Terry will not go on for ever and if Zouma and Stones are to be our pairing for the next ten years i would rather them spend two or three years with Terry to learn.
chelseafc,3e000r,med_22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:24 2015 UTC,Hope we've already submitted a bid at that price then.
chelseafc,3e000r,bustedracquet,-2,Mon Jul 20 22:56:29 2015 UTC,"One thing about this whole thing that mystifies me, is that Everton fans would rather not keep him for a year on loan if he did agree to move to Chelsea. That's the dumbest thing I've heard.  Stones would immensely help their position in the table, and they'd get a significant amount of cash to reinvest in their squad elsewhere. I don't get this notion that you can't keep a player that you know is going to leave at the end of the year. At the end of the day, football is a business, and he would play for them and do well. And then next year when they get a massive influx of money from the TV deal, they could get a replacement for him.   Basically, keeping him on loan for a year would help Everton do better next year and delay having to get his replacement which would surely be tough. I don't get how they don't see that..."
chelseafc,3e000r,attleboromass16,7,Mon Jul 20 23:17:15 2015 UTC,Would you want to keep our best player (Hazard) for a year on loan after selling him to Madrid?
chelseafc,3e000r,17hazard,3,Mon Jul 20 23:49:01 2015 UTC,Why the fuck wouldn't you? Not that this scenario makes any sense at all but of course we would want another year of hazard. It would give us extra time to find a replacement and begin to adapt to playing without him.
chelseafc,3e000r,attleboromass16,3,Tue Jul 21 00:30:28 2015 UTC,"Club pride, team chemistry are a few I can think of off the top of my head. Everton don't want to be seen as a feeder club for better sides. If their best player wants to come to Chelsea, no need in keeping him around for a year after a deal is done."
chelseafc,3e000r,17hazard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:36:26 2015 UTC,I don't think any logical person would want their team to lower in quality out of pride.
chelseafc,3e000r,bustedracquet,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:09:34 2015 UTC,Exactly.
chelseafc,3e000r,zachmo360,-4,Tue Jul 21 00:53:41 2015 UTC,"Ridiculous money, that's Otamendi's rumoured release clause as well.  So people who downvoted this would rather have Stones than Otamendi, great."
chelseafc,3e000r,quitefranklee,10,Mon Jul 20 22:28:52 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Stones because he's young, English, and very promising. Obviously Otamendi is the better player currently but he is 28, and we need a CB for the future. Not just one for this year since we already have Terry and Cahill."
chelseafc,3e000r,zachmo360,-4,Mon Jul 20 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"Otamendi is 27 and could easily hold down the CB spot for 5 years and give Zouma some experience to play alongside.  I feel like this sub doesn't actually watch football, anyway nice to see people down voting a different opinion."
chelseafc,3e000r,MobyTugboat,4,Tue Jul 21 00:10:33 2015 UTC,"This isn't about getting the best player for next season. Stones could be our defensive cornerstone for the next 10-15 years. John Terry does eventually have to retire, you know."
chelseafc,3e000r,TheGingerLow,3,Mon Jul 20 22:57:53 2015 UTC,"You said it yourself, he COULD BE. We don't know that for sure. Which is why spending over 30 million on him is stupid."
chelseafc,3e000r,zachmo360,2,Tue Jul 21 09:41:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like people haven't seen his defensive mistakes, fantastic talent for sure, but not worth the risk when we already have Zouma who is currently better imo."
chelseafc,3e000r,zachmo360,-3,Tue Jul 21 12:49:33 2015 UTC,"We have Zouma. You need some experience and leadership beyond Terry it's not fm, Otamendi could start for 5 years easily and allow Zouma to develop alongside him and be a started for 10-15 years"
chelseafc,3e000r,dWisey,4,Tue Jul 21 00:11:31 2015 UTC,I don't particularly care for either tbh but let's not act like Otamendi is some next level unreal player. He's had one stand out season. Most in here probably wouldn't have even heard of him last summer.
chelseafc,3e000r,dWisey,4,Mon Jul 20 22:58:42 2015 UTC,"Otamendi has been good for a while, But he is only being recognised now as he is in a bigger league"
chelseafc,3e000r,DrYaguar,0,Mon Jul 20 23:03:32 2015 UTC,"Has he really? Seen a couple of Porto fans say they've been surprised with his progression. Could be talking bollocks though, who knows."
chelseafc,3e000r,ScarySquirrel,3,Mon Jul 20 23:12:31 2015 UTC,Otamendi is overpriced.
chelseafc,3e000r,zachmo360,2,Mon Jul 20 22:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would rather have Stones that Otamendi."
chelseafc,3e000r,ScarySquirrel,2,Tue Jul 21 08:55:20 2015 UTC,Have you seen both play?
chelseafc,3e000r,zachmo360,0,Tue Jul 21 12:48:14 2015 UTC,"No I haven't, I only tend to follow English football. I was basing it purely on Stones being 22, English, and with Premier League experience."
chelseafc,3e000r,ScarySquirrel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:25 2015 UTC,Great way to form your opinion.
chelseafc,3e000r,kygrtj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:04 2015 UTC,What are you on about?

chelseafc,3e000r,xjselman,0,Mon Jul 20 22:46:11 2015 UTC,People may not want to hear it. But spending 30m+ on a young player who is promising and may or may not turn out to be good is a bad idea. Its simple economics.   People WANT him because he is English.
chelseafc,3e27ei,ThePhantomPotato,12,Tue Jul 21 11:40:59 2015 UTC,"lots of families and ""casuals"", normally a pleasant atmosphere but there won't be a lot of singing"

chelseafc,3e27ei,ght123,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"It will be great no doubt. It will be more laid back for sure, but last year that seemed like an advantage since there was nothing on the line and the crowd was more willing to be patient and just cheer on. Since it's the first home game in a while since the season ended, and now that we're champions, I'd bet it will be even better than how it was against Real Sociedad.   Expect a lot of 'champions of england' chants (who doesn't love those) and some great introduction/pyrotechnics for the squad. You'll love it mate."
chelseafc,3e27ei,branisuave,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:48:46 2015 UTC,It's fun at the start and stuff but most of the game will be mostly quiet. Not terrible but it'll depend on how many goals there are.
chelseafc,3e27ei,IncompetentRedditor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:46:59 2015 UTC,"Wasn't bad at the Sociedad game for a while. The Shed end was going crazy for a while, some of them more crazy than in a real match but for the rest of the game it was a library."

chelseafc,3e27ei,GingerSawr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:38:07 2015 UTC,Read an article a few hours back. It said only 12 fans had turned up to watch the players train and even more fewer turned up to greet the players when the bus arrived. how true is this?
chelseafc,3e27ei,specialhazard,2,Tue Jul 21 12:30:12 2015 UTC,"That was in Canada though, the game op is talking about is at home"
chelseafc,3e27ei,Ractrick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:45:14 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that the training sessions in Canada were private, that would explain why only 12 people showed up. They were probably family/friends or received some kind of invitation."
chelseafc,3e27ei,zDM14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:41 2015 UTC,"pretty sure those 12 were from some supporters group and were the only ones with access, it is not like the team wants to be bombarded with fans when they are trying to train."
chelseafc,3dyj74,obrapop,77,Mon Jul 20 16:03:52 2015 UTC,This is very good! It was never feasible that he would make it in our first team this season. This is a great opportunity to change that for next.
chelseafc,3dyj74,Ngog_We_Trust,3,Mon Jul 20 16:09:00 2015 UTC,Who do they currently have playing striker?
chelseafc,3dyj74,Tornality,18,Mon Jul 20 16:12:24 2015 UTC,It was rumored they were in for both Remy and Charlie Austin. Seems as if neither of those will work out. Wonder if they think Bamford will be first choice?
chelseafc,3dyj74,iamMANCAT,11,Mon Jul 20 16:18:17 2015 UTC,"Well Mourinho has ruled out Remy leaving, and it seems like half the clubs in the premier league are going after Austin, so Bamford will probably see a lot of the field even if he's not their out and out first choice."
chelseafc,3dyj74,obrapop,9,Mon Jul 20 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"Murray, Gayle and Chamakh. I think he has a good chance of coming out first choice in terms of ability but he might end up getting a bit less game time due to the fact that he won't be there beyond next season."
chelseafc,3dyj74,Ngog_We_Trust,6,Mon Jul 20 16:20:14 2015 UTC,"That would be amazing if he became first choice and lit it up. Falcao leaves after this season and he slots right in.   Chamakh is aggressively mediocre. I don't know much about the other two. I remember Gayle scoring against Liverpool(?), maybe a hat trick."
chelseafc,3dyj74,NickTM,3,Mon Jul 20 16:33:53 2015 UTC,"Chamakh's actually very good, just not as a striker.  Gayle's a good finisher, no more. Campbell's leaving. Bamford will get minutes but I don't expect him to outright displace Murray as first choice."
chelseafc,3dyj74,obrapop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:44:08 2015 UTC,"It would be brilliant. Gayle's not bad, loads of pace. IIRC Pardew played two up top for Newcastle a for bit in the days of Ba and Cisse. Maybe we'll see them as a partnership?"
chelseafc,3dyj74,mesabiral,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:15 2015 UTC,Chamakh is playing more of a CAM role these days if I remember correctly. Murray seems to be on his way to Bournemouth.
chelseafc,3dyj74,NickTM,4,Mon Jul 20 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"To clarify, I'm a Palace fan.  I sincerely doubt Murray is moving to Bournemouth. He's too important for us and he's beloved by the club, not to mention he did very well last season. Also, we're already shipping out Campbell and probably Gayle too."
chelseafc,3dyj74,mesabiral,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:43:16 2015 UTC,Might've just been shit rumours then. Would you see Bamford as a starter for Palace?
chelseafc,3dyj74,NickTM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:27 2015 UTC,"No, not right away at least. Murray is too good, too popular and too well suited to the playstyle of the team."
chelseafc,3dyj74,obrapop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:43:56 2015 UTC,Really? Fair. All the better for Bamford's playing time!
chelseafc,3dyj74,isrly_eder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:50 2015 UTC,I heard Bolasie might be getting playing time up top this season too
chelseafc,3dyj74,fma891,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:50:51 2015 UTC,"He won't be first choice. No idea how others are suggesting that. But I think he could be a very important player to sub into the late game, and a very good player to have if other strikers get injured."
chelseafc,3dyj74,wiNNA_monstER,9,Tue Jul 21 03:22:43 2015 UTC,"Now he has a chance to really prove himself.  Best of luck, Patrick!"
chelseafc,3dyj74,MrTrollFaceGuy,4,Mon Jul 20 17:16:11 2015 UTC,Under Alan Pardew too! This really looks great for us
chelseafc,3dyj74,renome,5,Mon Jul 20 19:21:37 2015 UTC,"If Falcao doesn't work out and Bamford plays well, I think he'd deserve to be our third choice in 16/17."
chelseafc,3dyj74,cescyblue,11,Mon Jul 20 19:00:43 2015 UTC,This is really great news. Hoping he bangs some few goals in league which majority audience notices and then an opportunity to start in Chelsea's first team as a 2nd striker or 3rd striker in the later season. Good times for him.
chelseafc,3dyj74,thegreenmonstuh,5,Mon Jul 20 16:17:27 2015 UTC,No way he'll be our 2nd choice any time soon
chelseafc,3dyj74,msbr_,6,Mon Jul 20 17:07:49 2015 UTC,Yeah some people on this sub are so fucking deluded regarding youth
chelseafc,3dyj74,themauvestorm3,5,Mon Jul 20 17:19:22 2015 UTC,How can anyone here truly know the likelihood of a youngster breaking into the first team? There are very few points of reference.
chelseafc,3dyj74,cescyblue,9,Mon Jul 20 17:39:39 2015 UTC,"The thing is.. It's not bad having faith on youth, right? I mean If a certain player belongs to the club, we REALLY hope he does well. Bamford is type of player which I really hope he shows his potential in Premiere League and he marks his worthiness in any top club if not Chelsea."
chelseafc,3dyj74,themauvestorm3,3,Mon Jul 20 18:45:35 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the ones (seemingly, like you) that thinks some of our youngsters are good enough. The problem is that there are so few data points. Meanwhile, many experienced football professionals are spending lots of time with these players but yet they can't break in. So, part of me wants to believe that they just aren't good enough but deep down, you really wonder.  We really haven't had TOO many of these loanees go on to do great things at other clubs. For every Ryan Bertrand there are 3 McEachrens or Turnbulls."
chelseafc,3dyj74,HEYO2013,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:45:33 2015 UTC,I don't think they are deluded but they are fan(antics)s and are living up to that definition. I feel like as fans of this club you see these guys come up and you want them to do well and you want then to make Chelsea's first team and you feel proud when they progress in their careers.
chelseafc,3dyj74,msbr_,0,Mon Jul 20 22:11:19 2015 UTC,"I understand that but there is little room in the first team perennially hunting quadruples for kids with 0 experience at the top level. That's just the way it is, however unfortunate that may be."
chelseafc,3dyj74,AlexTDS,4,Mon Jul 20 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"Love the thumbnail !  And yes this would be great for Bamford, PL experience in a club with ambition."
chelseafc,3dyj74,consultius,4,Mon Jul 20 16:57:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think he will see much time on the pitch to be brutally honest, I very much doubt with the ambition that Palace have shown this window that they won't bring in someone else better than Gayle/Chamakh/Murray."
chelseafc,3dyj74,fromthelanddownunda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:22 2015 UTC,murray was playing very well at the tail end of last season so i could see him starting. chamakh i heard plays better in a playmaking role so i could see him getting play time over gayle
chelseafc,3dyj74,NickTM,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:24 2015 UTC,"Murray's a cut above Gayle and Campbell and Chamakh's more of an attacking midfielder, but I do agree with the sentiment. The club's primary target is Austin."
