ketoscience,3e1rdd,PunchyHorse,6,Tue Jul 21 08:00:32 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty big question...   80% will be used for energy, the rest incorporated into hormones / modified into other structures.  The omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are used in pretty much the same way as each other, just that the omega-3 are very much more ""biologically active"" in the tissues they end up in (cell walls, hormones, all kinds of places). Omega-6 are more likely to cause inflammation.  The big problem is if you have trans fats in your body. They get incorporated like the correct versions, but they ""break apart"" more easily. If they were incorporated into cell signalling receptors, then break, then those receptors stop working.   Omega-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (e.g., arachidonic acid (AA)) and omega-3 (n-3) PUFA (e.g., eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) are precursors to potent lipid mediator signalling molecules, termed “eicosanoids,” which have important roles in the regulation of inflammation. In general, eicosanoids derived from n-6 PUFA are proinflammatory while eicosanoids derived from n-3 PUFA are anti-inflammatory. Dietary changes over the past few decades in the intake of n-6 and n-3 PUFA show striking increases in the (n-6) to (n-3) ratio (~15 : 1), which are associated with greater metabolism of the n-6 PUFA compared with n-3 PUFA. Coinciding with this increase in the ratio of (n-6) : (n-3) PUFA are increases in chronic inflammatory diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). By increasing the ratio of (n-3) : (n-6) PUFA in the Western diet, reductions may be achieved in the incidence of these chronic inflammatory diseases.   http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnme/2012/539426/"

The higher the omega 6 content of the diet the greater % the cell walls will be composed of omega 6. Health wise you want a greater % of the cell wall to be omega 3.

In our study, carried out in the setting of general practice, we observed that a short-term ketogenic diet is able to improve both on the short and long-term large number of anthropometric, haemodynamic and metabolic parameters related to the cardiovascular disease risk.   In particular we examined a significant improvement in body weight, BMI, WC, ICO, estimated body fat, SBP, DBP, PP, FPG, HbA1c, LDL-C, TG and HDL-C levels, that tend to remain stable after 1 year from the end of the short ketogenic period. The mild improvement of uricemia observed in the trial could also have some relevant prognostic implication.  These changes have not been associated to any clinically relevant adverse event."
ketoscience,3dthxd,simsalabimbam,3,Sun Jul 19 15:10:16 2015 UTC,"So this seems to suggest that the changes seen in keto, have a positive residual effect, even after the diet has ended?"
ketoscience,3dthxd,greg_barton,3,Sun Jul 19 15:33:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, you would expect that.  Many of the markers used such as HbA1c and HDL do not change dramatically over the course of weeks.  This is what I think happens on keto: first is liver recovery from fatty liver. At the same time the liver regains whatever insulin sensitivity it had lost. From this initial step, all the other benefits accrue quickly like normotension and reduced LDL with a switch to Pattern A (light, fluffy LDL).  If you stop the diet and return to overconsumption of food in general and a large carb intake, it will take some time for fat to accumulate in the liver and more time for the sequalae of that to begin."

ketoscience,3dihra,bohzahrking,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:44:22 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as ""keto adapted"" since there is no objective criterion (those of you who disagree: name one).  Thanks to the Dawn effect, many people on a keto diet will experience blood sugar levels quite a bit above 100, which will limit ketone production and thus ""kick you out"" of that supposed state every night.  On the other hand, many people who are not on keto will be ""in ketosis"" over night, if their last meal was long before sleep.  The truth is your liver produces glucose and ketones side-by-side even if you zero carb. Anyone with a glucose meter can verify that. ""Ketosis"" is not such much a ""state"" than a graded phenomenon (i.e., more-or-less rather than all-or-none)."
ketoscience,3dihra,grndzro4645,3,Fri Jul 17 14:41:19 2015 UTC,Wow. Thanks for the detailed explanation.
ketoscience,3dihra,bohzahrking,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:56:59 2015 UTC,"Keto adaptation is primarily in reference to mitochondrial count in cells because it is upregulated in keto, and burning fat is directly related to that. Some people are already ""adapted"" through heavy exercise, and calorie restriction. Both of which help cause mitochondrial fission.  People who are sedentary, or stuck on carbs will have a much tougher time switching to Keto because constant carbs downregulate mitochondria and cause an energy crisis when the body switches to fat burning."
ketoscience,3dihra,grndzro4645,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:16 2015 UTC,mitochondrial count    OK. Then what is the criterion? How many per cell? Which tissue?
ketoscience,3dihra,ashsimmonds,2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:46 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. But getting ATP from fat is a far slower process than getting it from glucose.  Any cell that has a nucleus is affected. Except heart tissue, because the heart burns fat exclusively and those cells have ~4000 mitochondria. No idea what the break point is though. I would assume it has to do with caloric needs and average carb/sugar intake."

Your body may of course be different. When I had only been doing keto for a few months, I would cheat and it would literally take DAYS for me to reenter. So there is a stark difference. Two months is most likely not enough time to comfortably reenter keto after a cheat meal (and especially a cheat day), but I assume everyone is different, so you'll just have to experiment."

ketoscience,3dihra,Dispro,2,Fri Jul 17 04:45:11 2015 UTC,Ketosis is achieved by depleting all of the glycogen and excess glucose in your system.  Fasting will accomplish this very quickly.
ketoscience,3dihra,NilacTheGrim,3,Fri Jul 17 12:20:57 2015 UTC,I read an article I think by either Phinney or Volek that suggested that until you are adapted each day of eating high carb again would set you back 2 weeks towards adaptation. I've been meaning to try and find it again.

So the diet has absolutely been working, but now I want to improve my performance. Thanks   The diet's been working so let me see if I can cheat.   For marathons especially, you're better off being fat adapted if you want to have maximal endurance over the long haul.  My two cents is that every cheat meal you consume slows down the fat adaptation and just works against you.  Train in keto, do the marathon in keto.  You'll be much better for it."
ketoscience,3dgobl,redd_now,8,Thu Jul 16 03:11:16 2015 UTC,"Physiological Insulin Resistance is better called ""Adaptive Glucose Sparing"". Why would your peripheral tissues be primed and adpated to remove glucose from blood if... there isn't any glucose in there to speak of?  No, those tissues adapt. Glucose transporters fold back inside the cell from the surface, instead the cell becomes more adept at taking in fat which is circulating. You literally become adapted to sparing glucose for use by those cells which absolutely require it. Some brain cells, red blood cells and testes require glucose because they do not have mitochondria!  Yes, FBG can easily rise above 100 mg/dl. But: FBG is a metric which is useful for day to day and hour to control and monitoring of blood glucose in diabetics. If you have physiological insulin resistance, you are literally at the opposite end of the risk spectrum to a diabetic:   You will have an extremely low HbA1c value Your liver and kidneys will be very sensitive to the effect of insulin, even though muscle tissue isn't You will almost never suffer hypoglycemic events   It takes a few days of eating carbs to return to the normal state for healthy people. This is why the term is ""physiological"" and not ""pathological"". It is not a disease state, it is a healthy response to carbohydrate restriction."
ketoscience,3dgobl,simsalabimbam,6,Thu Jul 16 07:13:48 2015 UTC,"Jason Fung Reviews the limitations of the low carb diet   Insulin does not respond only to high sugars, but the incretin effect shows that fatty acids and amino acids also play a role in the stimulation of insulin.  Hold on.  This changes everything.  The simple implication is this.  If carbohydrates are not the only, or even the major stimulus to insulin secretion, then restricting carbohydrates may not have as large an effect on insulin levels as we may have believed.   By incorporating various fasting regimens, he has overcome these limitations with some amazing results of diabetes reversal.  edit: updated first link to Atkins diet article"
ketoscience,3dgobl,matt2001,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:06:43 2015 UTC,Carbohydrates are still the major stimulus to insulin secretion and restricting them has a large effect on insulin levels  (E.g. Volek et al. Progress in Lipid Research 47 (2008) p. 311). The fact that it is not the only stimulator of insulin secretion does not mean it changes anything.
ketoscience,3dgobl,acetoacetate,2,Thu Jul 16 21:37:20 2015 UTC,"Agree. I avoid them as they stimulate my appetite (insulin). There is more to the story:  Here is a paper from 1997, Insulin Food:   beef was equal to brown rice and fish was equal to grain bread (insulin response)   It was surprising to see the insulin response of various foods, and many did not correlate with the glycemic index.  An insulin index of foods:the insulin demand generated by 1000-kJ portions of common foods  from the conclusion of the above article:   For example, isoenergetic servings of pasta and potatoes both contained ~50g carbohydrate, yet the IS for potatoes was three times greater than that for pasta. Similarly, porridge and yogurt, and whole-grain bread and baked beans, produced disparate ISs despite their similar carbohydrate contents. These findings, like others, challenge the scientific basis of carbohydrate exchange tables, which assume that portions of different foods containing 10 - 15g carbohydrate will have equal physiologic effects    Edit: I just wanted to add this from Fung's article on Atkins:   Where most people assumed that there was a tight correlation between glucose levels and insulin levels, it turned out that only 23% of the variability in the insulin response was due to the glucose.  In other words, only 23% of the insulin response is determined by how high the blood sugars rise.  The vast majority of the insulin response (77%) is not related at all.  Since it is insulin, and not glucose that drives weight gain, this changes everything. This is precisely where the glycemic index diets failed.  They were targeting the glucose response with the assumption that the insulin response mirrored the glucose.  But this is not the case.  You could lower the glucose response by diet, but you didn’t necessarily lower the insulin response.  In the end, it is only the insulin response that matters."

I can feel the size of the tumor on my neck so I can tell what is working and what isn't.  The one on my chest is also open so when I eat something it dosent like it gets inflamed and hurts a bit. Garlic and pepper+turmeric does this pretty well.  Burning carbs creates a lot more free radicals than burning fat. because of this it increases inflammation. In my case I feel it in my hands and the tumor on my neck grows rapidly.

On a side note, this seems to be something that all low carb dieters need to be mindful about! The fact that a low carb keto diet long term might not be sustainable,, and some changes might need to be done eventually.."
ketoscience,3dgobl,telladifferentstory,2,Thu Jul 16 06:07:57 2015 UTC,"Mabye. But I think it is completely sustainable if you pay attention to all the possible problems.  A: Include something in your diet that has a blood thinning effect. Ex fish oil, turmeric...etc. Drink plenty of water/liquid(especially in the morning)  B: Take extra electrolytes. Use regular salt because it has the right ratio of sodium/chloride already.      Use Citrate versions of potassium/magnesium to compensate for the high acidity of ketosis. Taking vitamin K2 is also reccomended. Pay attention to your symptoms to help dial in what you need and when.  C: Get comfortable with hunger. You will be incredibly hungry when you run out of energy. Don't panic, it only lasts 10 min or so. If you are worried about muscle loss use those absurdly hungry moments to tweak your diet and add protein. Specifically protein high in glutamine such as chicken/whey/soft cheese.  D: Have a cheat day once in a while. It helps with cravings when you are on diet, It relieves stress from cravings, It gives your body a break from keto, and it highlights just how crappy you will feel after cheating(thus reinforcing the importance of staying on course). It will also build up your mental fortitude.  E: Don't worry about ketones or ketostix. If you are on diet then you are in keto. The smell when you go to the bathroom will tell you.  F: Eat foods that help with constipation. In keto you have a severe lack of mucous production. Taking several magnesium oxide pills to clean out also works. Potassium is also very important for digestion, don't skimp on greens/suppliments.  And always research everything."

My last A1C (about 3 weeks ago) was 6.1, which is not perfect, but pretty damn good for a diabetic, and it's down from over 10 at my last visit to a doctor several years ago. The reason I got on keto in the first place was so that I could control my sugar better with lower doses of insulin, and it has worked amazingly.  Also: I know what DKA is like. I was hospitalized for it in March (the only diabetes-related hospitalization I've ever had) because I was out of both insulin and money for several days (I buy insulin online and my order was held up for an obnoxious amount of time in customs). I thought that fasting would prevent DKA. Boy was I wrong.  The reason why I keep coming back to the smell of my urine is that it smells different, not just stronger than usual, after I lift; and it smells like it did back when I first started keto, which I had heard from numerous members of the keto subs was a normal part of ketoadaptation, but shouldn't happen afterwards. It smells like burning rubber, or at least that's the closest approximation I can make.  There's no pain or irregular frequency so I don't think it's an infection, plus there's the fact that it is correlated with exercise, but maybe I should get that checked out.

The state will need to show additional evidence that you were impaired, but simply having a BAC under the per se limit does not get you off the hook.

I like Jason Fung's discussion of milk. Fung makes this point in his presentations: carbs (and protein too) --> insulin --> fat storage--> insulin resistance --> metabolic syndrome & diabetes.   I once went to a convention where a group of cardiologists were asked if milk was good or bad. It was split 50:50. I wasn't sure, but I have the answer now:  Here is a recent study showing that milk is a driver for diabetes. It is related to the proteins and activation of metabolic pathways - mtorc1.   Since the early 1950´s, refrigeration technology allowed widespread consumption of fresh pasteurized milk, which facilitates daily intake of bioactive bovine microRNAs. Persistent uptake of cow´s milk-derived microRNAs apparently transfers an overlooked epigenetic diabetogenic program that should not reach the human food chain.   Milk does not do a body good -  But cheese and yogurt do:   Most recent evidence has been provided that fermentation such as in yoghurt or cheese production destroys or attenuates the exosomal microRNA signaling of milk [93]."

However, increasing dietary protein intake, which appears to be safe, can elicit several favorable metabolic adaptations, including improved weight management (such as fat loss, lean body mass retention, and body weight sustainment), glycemic regulation, calcium retention, and long-term bone health. Emerging evidence also suggests that consuming dairy, as a critical component of a high-protein diet, may potentiate the metabolic advantages of higher protein diets, primarily due to the digestive and absorptive properties and EAA content of dairy proteins."

Well, cause the author has received money from Dairy Management Inc. ...for unrelated purposes. Anyway, the point stands - why higher protein diets render better results (not all studies are unequivocal about that too) and also I didn't check how high is higher and how low is lower and also didn't check how are the rest of the macronutrients affected (if it's mentioned in the study) but despite that the author mentions that the beneficial part of the high dairy diets is based on their higher EAA (essential amino acids i.e. protein) content. Why is this so? Because EAA increase mild uncoupling in BAT and block insulin release (that is they increase the intervals in the pulsatile insulin output) i.e. they contribute to increase in satiety thru activation of cGMP -LKB-1 AMPK and related co-factors with all the positive effects following from that."

ketoscience,3cy9vq,pugsaredrugs,3,Sat Jul 11 21:38:01 2015 UTC,I'm doing intermittent fasting and keto with great results. I think it goes well with the keto diet. There are many fasting protocols.  There is also a lot of misinformation. It is safe - especially one or two days per week. It does not cause muscle loss vs daily calorie restriction which does.  I will link you to Jason Fung. I think he has the best information on fasting. He uses it with good results - sick patients with kidney problems and diabetes. Read Fung's blog or watch his videos. The longest fast that he documents was 382 days with great results - pt went from 460 to 180 lbs and kept it off.  Here is an easier fasting program that you might consider. You can still do keto with it for added benefit.

ketoscience,3cy9vq,anbeav,2,Sat Jul 11 22:31:08 2015 UTC,The latter is likely more sustainable. For people who are fasting for weight loss reasons (read: not other reasons associated with a different mindset) the long fast usually results in overeating after the fast which defeats the purpose.

A 500 calorie deficit per day will net the same fat loss with minimal lean mass loss. There is no real reason to not eat protein daily unless you find that the only way you can diet is to eat nothing.  PSMF is for those who want to cut weight as fast as possible and keep their lean mass. For 1lb per week, SKD with a 500 deficit is fine.  You could also eat 180g of protein and nothing else for a couple of days and get a very similar result."

That seems like a pretty absurd conclusion to jump to. As you said, no actual data, just the statements of a man, and given the great number of unknowns when it comes to microbiology and the human brain, I think his statement can be completely disregarded as unscientific hearsay.  Another thing; the leptin hormone probably carries way more weight scientifically as being involved in satiety and hunger than the sort of bacteria in your gut. The idea that the bacteria are eating the vagus nerve in humans because they have a lot of fat in their diet is just absurd, and even absurd as far as mice are concerned frankly. Even the fact that he is saying that mice who ate a lot of fat gained weight just runs contrary to so much scientific data on this forum. Again he didn't specify what they are eating, eating both high fat and high carbs is going to lead to an increased weight gain, so he didn't specify any data here and again this makes any point he makes beyond that irrelevant, because we don't even know what he is really studying. He is just doing things and saying things. There is no transparency here and nothing to look at.  Lastly, I heard favorable things in regards to keto and some chronic inflammatory diseases, they measured the levels of bacteria in fecal matter and found that people with IBS tended to have higher levels of the carb eating bacteria, and people with the healthy systems had more of the fat and protein eating bacteria. I tried to find the link and couldn't find it but that should give you a lead if you are interested in it.  Ultimately there is nothing definitive about any of this.

ketoscience,3cv1tj,FrigoCoder,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the replies guys,.. i've been reading and trying to understand as much as i can. Just learning so much about how the body works... Obviously overwhelming evidence was given that protein does not contribute to accelerated GNG in anyway. However, 2 things that i read from all this material caught my attention   Why must protein remain in the lower end of the spectrum for ketosis? Dietary protein and/or amino acids are necessary and essential for survival <– fact. When taken in excess, some are stored as glycogen, some are oxidized. Ketosis relies on a need for “fat-derived fuels.” If liver glycogen is full, then some of that glycogen reduces the need for said fuels. Further, ketones are derived from hepatic fatty acid oxidation; if liver is getting plenty of energy from oxidizing amino acids, it certainly won’t need any from fat. When it comes down to prioritization of hepatic substrate oxidation: big influx of diet-derived amino acids > fatty acids. And insulin generally helps to prevent a head-on collision.   From my (limited) understanding what i get from this para is (some) protein is stored as glycogen and rest is oxidized. And if liver is getting plenty of energy from oxidizing amino acids, it certainly won’t need any from fat (which might result in lower ketone levels, less need to tap into fat for energy, which might come in the way of fat loss). Please correct me if i am wrong.   Physiological Insulin Resistance Read more about this in the link (http://high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.com/2007/10/physiological-insulin-resistance.html) where the author explains how over the years your FBG might increase.   I recently recorded a blood sugar reading of over 100. Certainly could be a one off aberration,.. however should anyone be concerned about this and make changes to prevent something like this? Again, i tried to read up on Hb1AC tests and found (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3075530/) where they say that ""FBS sounds more reliable to separate diabetic from non-diabetic subjects than HbA1c."""
ketoscience,3cv1tj,simsalabimbam,0,Wed Jul 15 03:03:24 2015 UTC,"You wrote:   ""FBS sounds more reliable to separate diabetic from non-diabetic subjects than HbA1c.""   The article also says:   Generally, FBS was a more accurate predictor for HbA1c compared with HbA1c as a predictor of FBS.   And:   HbA1c had greater sensitivity and negative predictive value in detection of FBS>126 mg/dl. Hence, a low HbA1c is a strong evidence to rule out diabetes.    This is the important part, supported by the data they collected.  FBG values vary wildly from one reading to the next, from the state of the subject (post-prandial, pre-prandial etc.). This is why HbA1c values are much better at indicating the absence of diabetes, not FBG readings.  Measuring blood sugar is an important tool for diabetics trying to control their medication doses. Measuring HbA1c is an important diagnostic for the general population to indicate the absence of diabetes. Low HbA1c means no diabetes. High HbA1c means ""do more tests, specifically an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test"".  Having physiological insulin resistance means you will have a low HbA1c, therefore no need to perform an OGTT. If you get one anyway, the result will be a false postivie, it will indicate poor glucose control even though this is absolutely impossible when adhering to a ketogenic diet."

Or you'd have to load up on some carbs to stimulate hunger, thus you'll probably want to consume excess protein."

On a ketogenic diet I (re)gained the ability to fast. Not that I feel energetic or exhilarated while fasting, but I can do it at least for a couple of days.   From that perspective the ketogenic diet lowered insulin levels and restored insulin sensitivity in fat cells, so that can fat be stored an released again efficiently. Resulting in lower meal frequency and better ability to fast. Any thoughts on the validity of this idea?"

Here are some pieces of the puzzle:  PPAR and Adipose Triglyceride Lipase   Characterization of the function and regulation of ATGL and related patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing proteins such as adiponutrin remain in the early stages. However, the central role of both PPARγ and ATGL in lipid metabolism suggests that regulation of ATGL by PPARγ may have important implications in pathogenesis and treatment of obesity and related disorders of lipid homeostasis.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819189/  NHR and FGF   The ability to adapt to cycles of feast and famine is critical for survival. Communication between multiple metabolic organs must be integrated to properly metabolise nutrients. By controlling networks of genes in major metabolic organs, nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) play central roles in regulating metabolism in a tissue-specific manner. NHRs also establish daily rhythmicity by controlling the expression of core clock genes both centrally and peripherally. Recent findings show that many of the metabolic effects of NHRs are mediated through certain members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. This review focuses on the roles of NHRs in critical metabolic organs, including adipose tissue, liver and muscle, during the fed and fasted states, as well as their roles in circadian metabolism and downstream regulation of FGFs.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3980036/"

You are likely expending more effort to achieve the same distance at a slower pace because it takes time to adapt to exercise on keto   How much sodium? Potassium? Magnesium?   Are you getting enough calories?   I am thinking about carb loading for the actual races so my muscles will be overcompensated with glycogen   If you're going to train in keto I would race in keto.

I just limit the volume to avoid injury and the fact that I don't have a lot of time. I never run until I cannot.  Here is my 1km lap time pre keto. weight and then km1 2 etc. There are 1min breaks between each lap. I do other continuous runs as well, these are just the ones I keep track of.

These weights are taken before the run so a bit higher than my morning weights. So I guess not a great indicator of deficit.  Also when I am running I feel tired right away but can still keep going at the paces listed under keto. I was considering the possibility that the type I muscle fibers are super pumped. The type IIa fibers however may be trying to be recruited and since there is no muscle glycogen available for them, they begin producing lactate so I get the steady burn the entire time.  My effort is steady and consistent and I really am not trying any harder than before.  I won't be changing anything for the first time on race day. I would do the 90km cycle on keto and then another after a 36hour carb load the following week and repeat the same course while measuring HR and power data. And then I could do the 90km again on keto to factor out the training benefit from the previous workout.  Magnesium would be ~360mg just from my mixed nuts but should be in other food sources.  I haven't been measuring the other two. I have just been sprinkling them in to food and water."
ketoscience,3cpk0d,callesen58,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:09:46 2015 UTC,"I am currently on my 5th week of keto and still reading all the information I can while training and tracking progress.   It actually takes several months to reach maximal performance on a ketogenic diet, just a FYI.   I don't know though if this will induce the bonking when I run out or will I continue to have my keto adaptation advantage?   Keto adaptation has to do, beyond the initial phase, with enzyme upregulation, mitochondrial biogenesis and epigenetic changes. Those don't disappear from occassionally consuming carbohydrate.   Any advice, thoughts, analysis, related articles?   Try getting your hands on some high quality methylene blue, if you want a boost to aerobic capacity: http://pqdtopen.proquest.com/doc/1038970687.html?FMT=AI  Important part:   We determined the effect of MB and its derivatives on the activity of mitochondria complexes I-III (NADH oxidase and cytochrome c reductase, respectively) and complexes II-III (succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c reductase, respectively). Both assays rely on measuring the rate of cytochrome c reduction in terms of changes in cytochrome c absorbance, which is typically reduced by complex III. In the complex I-III assay, with NADH as the electron donor, MB and TB significantly increased the rate of cytochrome c reduction, while no effect was found in the other tested compounds (Figure 6A). Antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor, significantly reduced the rate of cytochrome c reduction. For the complex II-III assay using 37 succinate as the electron donor, no effect was observed in all the tested compounds (Figure 6B). As predicted, antimycin A significantly inhibited complex II-III activity. We determined the effect of MB and its derivatives on cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) using a Seahorse XF24 Flux Analyzer. OCR and ECAR were measured under five conditions. The first set of measurements established a baseline for 35 minutes followed by injection of media containing MB or each of its derivatives. Upon injection, NR, MB and TB dramatically increased OCR, while 2-chlorophenothiazine and chlorpromazine had no effect on the OCR (Figure 7A, C). Then cells received sequent treatment of oligomycin (an ATP synthase inhibitor), Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (mitochondrial uncoupler), and rotenone (complex I inhibitor). As predicted, oligomycin caused a decrease in OCR, FCCP maximized cellular OCR, and rotenone dramatically reduced OCR. At each condition, TB, NR, and MB treatment significantly enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation evidenced by the higher OCR as compared to control (Figure 7A, D, E, F). Changes in cellular oxygen consumption are often mirrored by opposing changes in lactate production (Wu, Neilson et al. 2007). Changes in lactate production are measured by ECAR. MB and TB had corresponding decreases in ECAR compared to controls (Figure 8). NR initially increased ECAR, but ECAR subsequently reduced, reaching a similar level as that of MB. To verify that NR was not directly affecting the pH of the media, the experiment was repeated in 10 mM HEPES buffer; however, NR continued to increase ECAR upon initial injection (data not shown). We determined the redox potential of MB and its derivatives. Our analysis indicated that MB, NR and TB have distinct redox potential from other derivatives 38 (Table 3). Interestingly, these 3 compounds have similar action on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.   I personally experience greater performance after methylene blue ingestion."

""Nutrition and the Adaptation to Endurance Training"" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008803/ ""These facts together with the above data, suggest that to activate SIRT1 and therefore PGC-1α maximally, athletes should be encouraged to limit caloric intake before certain endurance training sessions and train at 75–100 % of maximum oxygen consumption.""  ""Epinephrine also increases when athletes exercise for long periods without consuming carbohydrates or when they exercise in a glycogen-depleted state [54].""  ""However, the animal data are strong enough to encourage athletes to train in ways that increase epinephrine levels, such as in the heat [59], in glycogen depletion [54], or at high intensities [53].""  ""This article was published in a supplement supported by Gatorade Sports Science Institute."" I didn't see a conflict of interest in the data since they didn't recommend sports drinks at any time in the article.  ""To start an “adaptive” session in a caloric deficit (i.e., in a fasted state such as in the morning before breakfast or in a glycogen-depleted state). This would make sure that SIRT1 activity would be high. It is important to remember that any time training is performed in a fasted or glycogen-depleted state, the perceived effort will be much higher and performance will decrease. This can be mitigated by carbohydrate mouth rinses and caffeine (see below). To consume a pre-training drink containing 200 mg of caffeine but free of carbohydrates and synthetic antioxidants. The caffeine serves primarily to decrease the perceived intensity of the training [64], but may also increase the release of calcium in the working muscles allowing greater activation of PGC-1α [24]. The absence of synthetic antioxidants promotes more mitochondrial biogenesis [62] because of improved PGC-1α2 transcription through USF-1 [22]. The lack of carbohydrate would maximize AMPK and p38 activity and epinephrine during training. Finally, that these adaptive training sessions should be performed at a low absolute intensity for a long time. This type of training would minimize the mechanical strain and keep calcium signaling high. However, beyond that, performing this training session in a fasted/glycogen depleted state would allow the athlete to benefit from a high SIRT1, AMPK, p38, and epinephrine state for the longest possible time, in theory resulting in the best possible adaptations."""

As I said a million times before it's a total joke in many aspects and I highly recommend the discussion between him, Larsen and the rest reflected in the citations here   I believe there is something totally wrong with this study from 1971 too though I still can't put my finger on it. It's either the housing conditions, the Purina Chow (which is 56% carbs, about 30% prots and 14% fats)-fed controls vs carb-fed rats (really?), the rat strain, the types of FA they used or the FA liver perfusion, itself, I dunno."

Their calculations are just statistics, not science.   Realistically, it varies drastically from person to person based on genetics, age, activity, metabolic rate, metabolic damage done in the past, and type of diet (low carb theoretically can release more fat under some circumstances, but this doesn't always play out under calorie restricted studies comparing HC vs LC).   TLDR- there is very little evidence out there that fatty acid release is limited."

I think it's gotta be at least as enlightening as any of the sugar metabolism talks that I have seen. Especially great points on the balance between exercise and diet and the expected body composition changes.  I wish that there was some detail offered on the ways that macronutrient intake affect the predictions of the model, if at all, but there was already a lot packed into that hour.   The Java applet model on the website is terrific and I have it bookmarked. The way that I see this changing my approach is in putting more emphasis on exercise, allowing a higher caloric intake to help me hit those exercise goals."

ketoscience,3bwg27,the_straylight_run,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:51:15 2015 UTC,"I know this question might be late to the party.   One of the fascinating products of Dr. Hall's research is that the dynamic nature of the body's BMR is shown pretty clearly. Especially in context of actual starvation, homeostatic management of metabolism compensated for the lack of exogenous calories to minimise too rapid loss of energy stores.  My question for anybody here relates to the fact that even though keto dieters use the lack of insulin response from the diet to both reverse insulin resistance and to maximise fatty acid efflux from WAT, they must still diet at a deficit. This implies that at least some of the starvation response by the body would be relevant to consider when setting up diet parameters.  Does anybody think that the compensation effect should be integrated into the design of a diet solution? By that I mean is there some interval, say every 3 weeks, whereby the new weight/body config and calories are used to recompute calorie needs. If so, at what interval?   The idea is that if a dieter stays on the same diet schema, using the TDEE estimate from the beginning as a principle basis to calculate the deficit, over the course of the diet, the body will in a short time adapt to the lower calorie intake and slow the weight loss down. Obviously a dieter wanting to get the maximum bang for the buck so to speak would want to avoid that.  Any thoughts on how to manage it for optimal weightloss, and at what interval for reevaluation?"

ketoscience,3br16d,Thebeardinato462,2,Wed Jul 1 23:12:17 2015 UTC,"I am curious about this as well. Any scientific reason (none of the answers here provide that) ? I understand that anecdotally, you might not feel well switching to carbs as your primary fuel as a lot of people have mentioned.  But all the information I have seen state that in the presence of carbs, the brain immediately stops using ketones and utilizes glucose instead. However, if you want your brain to use ketones, there is an adaptation period before it can use ketones. I believe the OP and myself are curious about why is there no adaptation period for carbs. Based on that, doesn't that imply that carbs are the primary fuel for the brain and that ketones are sort of a backup option ?"
ketoscience,3br16d,dum_dum_dummm,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:44:55 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what it implies as there is evolutionary-established metabolic hierarchy which runs as carbohydrates>amino acids>fatty acids and that's the order they are metabolized. Carbs are the primary fuel for the brain and for the body in general until you replenish the glycogen stores (muscles, liver) necessary for the ""flight or fight"" instinct to take place. That's why the stress hormones are counter-regulatory of insulin and lead to high blood sugar. Both muscles and liver are replenished via GLUT-1 in an non-insulin mediated fashion. As insulin has limited ability to pass the BBB I believe the same happens in the brain too. However when glucose is absent then ketones are the fuel utilized by the brain and it is the more effective one as they are more energy-laden IMHO. This could cast some light on the very sensitive subject about ethnic differences and IQ scores but I'd rather stay away from that topic."
ketoscience,3br16d,hastasiempre,0,Sat Jul 4 21:52:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, I am curious about the ethnic differences. I am an Indian (the gas station/dot/Rajesh Koothrapalli kind) and I have been a vegetarian for 29 of my 33 years. A lot of carbs. All three mails with a combination of legumes and/or rice. Keto still helped me lose weight and made me feel active till a bunch of auto immune diseases all hit me at the same time (UC, uveitis, Ankylosing Spondylitis). Part of me can't avoid thinking that keto caused it. Anyway a year later, I am back on it, but I feel similar symptoms coming back again  However, maybe Indians/East Asians are more carb adapted because they are some of the oldest non-african civilization. Then, I wonder why we have ability to live off ketones. Also, another thing I am curious as to why we evolved a mechanism to store fat not carbs, if fat was easily availale? I mean, if the diet was predominantly carbs, then shouldn't we have evolved a mechanism to store carbs?"
ketoscience,3br16d,dum_dum_dummm,-1,Sun Jul 5 06:12:34 2015 UTC,"Africa and South East Asia but also Asia in general, the Pacific Islands, The Arab Gulf, all those evolutionary have HCLF diet as that is the natural food availability. However that diet goes with a conditio sine quanone - heat acclimation which is protective against obesity and metabolic syndrome morbidity in these countries. The problem with the rising obesity rates in these countries comes with the large swaths of the population that become affluent and could afford to live in air-conditioned spaces thus eliminating that protective mechanism and changing their habitual long-term acclimation pattern."

ketoscience,3br16d,hastasiempre,4,Wed Jul 8 02:00:39 2015 UTC,"Because our bodies are naturally aligned to eat carbs, we have mechanisms to digest them. Carbs are an easy source of energy, and allows population growth as you could easily survive on carbs until the age of reproduction.  However, after that point is where things start to get hairy. It doesn't seem like human digestive system is ideally designed to breakdown/absorb plants which eventually causes a buildup of toxins and health issues as the organism ages.  So while humans have all the machinery to digest carbs, choosing to digest them may not be the wisest thing in the long-term.   Edit: but why are carbs the default?

There are billions of people eating predominantly HCLF diet in the world and they don't have Obesity, Metabolic , or Neurodegenerative diseases rates anywhere close to the ones in the US. Utilization of glucose as primary substrate is evolutionary established as that was the endemic diet of the first humans in the cradle of humanity in West Africa. All long-term heat acclimated humans, living in equatorial and sub-, tropical and sub- and desert climates, have HCLF diet as that's the natural food availability in these climate zones. OTOH people living in the temperate and cold climates (with long-term cold acclimation) are adapted to LCHF diet as evolutionary requirement for the same reasons as above. To sum it up in human evolution with transition from hot climates to cold ones there was an adaptive switch to different macronutrient diets as result of the natural food availability and as an evolutionary requirement. This adaptive switch is expressed in differential gene expressions, mitochondrial content, hormonal regulation etc etc."

All you have to do is lack insulin and glucose will kill you.  Salt, botox, ethanol... it's pretty much the same story with most things."

ketoscience,3bnrfq,QuickArrow,3,Tue Jun 30 19:04:24 2015 UTC,"A1c varies, it's still well within normal range. You can see increased fasting insulin on keto secondary to physiological insulin resistance."
ketoscience,3bnrfq,anbeav,2,Tue Jun 30 19:23:11 2015 UTC,"That makes next to no sense (again, layman here). Bear with me if you will, but why are we seeing increased insulin in a diet with very little blood sugar?   I should make an ELI5 for /r/ketoscience . Thanks for your patience."

Thank you, that is a perfectly reasonable understandable explanation (coupled with /u/goblando's rundown) for why FBG and insulin would be either spiked or elevated, meanwhile fatty acids are being processed for fuel rather than carbohydrates.   He's curious if he and his fellow are oddities. I wonder if there is or could be a database of ketogenic (as well as SAD) blood levels where we might submit this information, for science."
ketoscience,3bnrfq,QuickArrow,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:21:28 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there is or could be a database of ketogenic (as well as SAD) blood levels where we might submit this information, for science.   Yea part of the problem when assessing lab results on keto, there are no standards to compare. For some things (eg sodium, creatinine) there are biological standards which determine normal range but for others it's highly variable. Curiously not all experience physiological IR, for example my glucose runs 40s-50s"
ketoscience,3bnrfq,anbeav,4,Wed Jul 1 10:13:24 2015 UTC,"Insulin does more than regulate sugar from your food intake.  Its release can also be triggered by exercise and other circuits.  The biggest thing with keto is that it never spikes.  Your body keeps your blood sugar in a range.  That level doesn't change just because you are on keto.  What changes is that you don't produce mass quantities of insulin for extended periods of time to keep the liver making glycogen and keep fat cells sucking it in.  A spike in insulin stops the release of glucagon from the pancreas.  Glucagon is the signal to the liver to process fatty acids for fuel and also signals fat cells to release energy.  (Keep in mind, most blood work like this is fasting for 8-12 hours which is usually enough time for a healthy person to process carbs and lower the Insulin levels to a normal range, like OP)"

Triglycerides Consumed for fuel and therefore is reduced.   VLDL-C Decreases due to triglyceride shedding. Converted into IDL & consumed.   LDL-C Increase due to VLDL catabolism. This should decrease over time as SD-LDL are consumed due to lower triglycerides.   HDL-C Increase.   Contains primarily cholesterol so increased count as triglycerides drop. This may decrease initially as LDL particles transfer cholesterol to small HDL particles which then gets sent straight into VLDL particles without the HDL particles maturing properly.   Total Cholesterol Increase due to HDL-C & LDL-C rising. Long-term this will ideally reduce.   TC/HDL-C Ratio Decrease. May go up if LDL-C rises significantly. Look to HDL-C for further analysis.

I completely agree - what I mean is that it's the increased cholesterol in the blood from fat loss that's likely causing the uptick.    Increased free fatty acids from the diet may lead to cholesterol synthesis which leads to an increased cholesterol pool.  Fat loss may cause this as well but it's due to the availability of free fatty acids en masse as opposed to a sudden increase of cholesterol being dumped from adipocytes.   Definitely correlation...I should have said ""when losing weight you often see an uptick in cholesterol measured in the bloodstream.""   More accurate but still incorrect.

And here’s a key fact pertinent to this discussion: low carbohydrate diets consistently and significantly increase LDL particle size irrespective of the response in LDL-C concentration. Compelling data now indicate that having more small LDL particles is associated with increased risk for heart disease[50].  In the mean time, the ratio of your triglyceride to HDL-C (TG/HDL-C) is an effective surrogate for LDL particle size. Values of TG/HDL-C over 3.5 indicate that you probably have pattern B with a predominance of small LDL particles, and a ratio this high indicates there’s a good chance you may also have insulin resistance[55].

It also means that it's possible other things (like excessive exposure to endocrine disruptors) can cause either or both.   The high correlation between PCOS and thyroid disease (especially Hashimoto's disease) also seems to point to another instance of ""either cause OR effect"" on other disorders. There's also evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction, which can either be genetically programmed or (as we're just finding out), acquired later in life from a few common viral infections, may play a role, because mitochondrial dysfunction is often related to insulin resistance, and/or to thyroid dysfunction. Autoimmunity may also be relevant.  (Let me know if you want sources, and for which statements. I don't have time to put all of them in right now because I'm at work and on break.)"

If I go lower, I get despressed (especially when the scale doesn't move), then I give up, get depressed, turn to food and gain weight.  I've mucked around with keto and various levels of carbs (20g, then 10g, then 5g).  Now I am trying zero carb (i.e., an all-protein diet) which seems to work for some (for weight loss).  I'm at day 9 on that.  I'm not convinced the all-protein is working.  My blood glucose will hit 100 (usually when I eat chicken) and on keto, I had it in the 80's. BUT I feel FANTASTIC on all-protein!  My energy has gone through the roof and so has my mood and I feel like I'm finally in ketosis.  The other day, on a whim, I just decided to walk home because it was so nice out and I walked 4 miles and could have walked 4 more.  Scale.will.not.budge.though.  I was able to drop 5 pounds initially doing 23/1 fasting before all protein (after devouring Jason Fung blog).

Also I do have a food scale and have weighed everything since October, 2014.  I am a former WW (from 10 years ago) and can calorie-count like a pro.  :)  I'm curious as to how macros effect my insulin levels - all protein?  high fat?  calorie counting?  fasting?  5 carbs?  20 carbs?  That's what I'm wondering.  There are people on /r/keto having amazing results.  Obviously, I am not like them so something is different and, from everything I've read, it's highly possible that it is related to insulin resistance and the degree to which we each have it.  The OGTT scares me.  If I eat a donut, my BS will go up to 160 and even after switching back to keto, it will take 3-4 days before I see 80 again.

I believe that carbs are meant to be stored as fat in preparation for the bad times - eat em' if you have to - but -- we want the actual fat.  Never eat carbs unless you're dying of starvation (but everyone's different and needs to find their right level of carbohydrate - i understand that)   it is my firm belief that carbohydrate (fructose in particular) + polyunsaturated oil = most modern diseases,(one example: alzheimer's/dementia), most cancers and their increasing prevalence... .

First, yes, real low blood glucose values are still dangerous. If you go below 3, eat some sugar! For me, a value of 4 is no longer something I worry about, but below four I set my insulin pump to a lower setting. And below three feels like a hypo, and I eat carbs.   All this is less of an issue because values are so much more stable. Fewer peaks, fewer lows.  It did take me quite a long time to get into ketosis. Even eating at a calorie deficit didn't get me there, and I wasn't losing weight. For me, it turned out I really needed to limit the amount of protein, a according to the guidelines you can find in the faq. Once I did that, it worked well, and I've been losing weight steadily since.  I don't know for sure if that has to do with the diabetes, but it does make sense.

See #4. 2.)as iawia said the low blood sugars can be potentially dangerous if you let them go low enough to slip into a coma, but to be clear they are not damaging as asked in your question. 3.) I don't know. 4.) Ketosis regulation can be simplified to be based on the amount of liver glycogen available. Less liver glycogen = more ketone production. Glucose can cause a temporary reduction in ketone production via insulin, however ketone production will quickly resume as long as liver glycogen is low. A more complex answer is that oxalocacetate regulates acetyl-CoA thus causing either ketone production or being burned in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.  edited: less is more :)"

For a diabetic, the insulin is decoupled from the glucose. So if higher insulin levels limit ketone production, this becomes a tricky thing to accomplish for diabetics.  I think ketosis is hard to attain at a higher blood glucose level. It seems to work for me as long as my levels are roughly in the healthy range (<8mmol/l). This does require a fairly high base of insulin, though. It's hard to separate these things. If I manage to get into ketosis, I lose weight, which means I need less insulin, which drops my blood sugar values. But that would also mean more 'free' insulin in my bloodstream, and potential hypos. And if I read what you're saying correctly, that could also kick me out of ketosis.  I've certainly noticed the liver glycogen store being more limited on a low carb diet, simply because the 'up swing' in blood glucose after a hypo is much more limited (up to ~10mmol/l, instead of 20)."

While production may be limited by insulin ketone levels in the blood are  not reduced directly, only in so much as you are using them and not replacing them. You might therefore find it useful to do ketone supplementation with either ketoforce, keto NaCa, or MCT oil. What is also interesting is high levels of ketones themselves tend to have a blood sugar lowering effect, which would further reduce your base insulin needs.

I can't seem to find any of that. Peter Attia also mentions it.     As seen in this exercise, glucose tends to fall quite precipitously following exogenous ketone ingestions. Without exception, every time I ingested these compounds (which I’ve probably done a total of 25 to 30 times), my glucose would fall, sometimes as low as 3 mM (just below 60 mg/dL). Despite this, I never felt symptomatic from hypoglycemia. Richard Veech (NIH) one of the pioneers of exogenous ketones, has suggested this phenomenon is the result of the ketones activating pyruvate dehydogenase (PDH), which enhances insulin-mediated glucose uptake. (At some point I will also write a post on Alzheimer’s disease, which almost always involves sluggish PDH activity —in animal models acute bolus of insulin transiently improves symptoms and administration of exogenous ketones does the same, even without glucose.)< http://eatingacademy.com/personal/experience-exogenous-ketones"

ketoscience,3b4x8c,ketosore,3,Fri Jun 26 15:25:37 2015 UTC,"If you want an explanation, almost every part of the nephron in the kidney is super effective at absorbing sodium. Close to 100% of all sodium taken in is reabsorbed and kept in the body. It's very hard to remove from the body outside of sweating and very small amounts in urine. This is why reducing sodium can help reduce blood pressure.   When there is a sodium imbalance the body must use a lot of water to remove a little bit of sodium, so when you are drinking liquids with a concentration higher than that of blood, the kidneys will keep dumping more water than they remove sodium which causes the sodium to become more concentrated in the blood."

ketoscience,3b4x8c,borick,2,Fri Jun 26 13:58:53 2015 UTC,Actually you will absorb a large amount of the sodium that is ingested. The blood concentration is relevant because its what dictates what the homeostatic mechanisms of the kidneys do with the sodium-laden water

This is basic, incontrovertible science.   I can't understand why this is so difficult to grasp.  You can skip all discussions of daily metabolic needs, and simply look at this. If the liver and muscles are full, and you eat carbs, the carbs are becoming fat unless you have diabetes. I don't give two fucks what some stupid ""study"" alleges happens to the sugar.

Let me clarify: It is very plausible that the mutation/adaptation that selects for breast milk with the most robust growth in infancy also, as a byproduct of that mutation/adaptation, produces a magic slow acting poison that kills the baby in middle age. Since the death doesn't occur until after peak child bearing years the mutation/adaptation stays in the gene pool."

When you eat a lot of carbs, your body adapts by becoming less efficient at burning fat, and you overeat easily (reactive hypoglycaemia) and like a goose making ""foie gras"", you turn that excess into fat and because you are now less efficient at burning it you now store it in unhealthy places (like in a fatty liver)."

ketoscience,3axfcg,JLMA,2,Thu Jun 25 22:56:55 2015 UTC,"Everyone will require different amounts of protein based on their lean body weight and their exercise load and how well they can move amino acids around - the only way to accurately determine is to measure the nitrogen leaving the body in urea and slowly reduce the amount entering in the form of dietary protein to determine your personal net protein utilization.  Most experts use a rough formula 1-1.5g/kg of lean body weight.    Animal protein has a more complete range of amino acids for maintaining the bodies of animals (ie: us).  It is possible that people on some plant based diets might need to seek out a source of proteins containing amino acids that plants don't usually make in great amounts.  As for fats, there is some research into the types of saturated fats in the blood correlating with incidences of Type 2 diabetes Differences in the prospective association between individual plasma phospholipid saturated fatty acids and incident type 2 diabetes: the EPIC-InterAct case-cohort study that showed that 'even chained' SFAs predicted increased incidence of T2DM.  Some of those came from Plant sources (eg: Avocado) and also from the palmitic acid from that fat that the liver makes out of excess carbohydrates.  Odd chained and very long chained SFAs predicted decreased incidence of T2DM.  Those are predominately from Animal sources like Dairy.   As for how much fat one should eat - I don't know that there is any upper limit short of satiation."

ketoscience,3axfcg,necropantser,2,Thu Jun 25 06:56:22 2015 UTC,"But!  GNG happens constantly on keto. In fact, GNG is a requirement for ketogenesis.  GNG did not kick in with protein. What happened was GNG was proceeding exclusively from amino acids, rather than in part from glycerol and in part from amino acids. This raises oxaloacetate levels, and then the Acetyl-CoA can be turned into citric acid rather than acetoacetate.  The difference is subtle but real. Only low-moderate protein ketogenic diets lead to high levels of serum ketones."

Especially with respect to the seeing in the diet something that we don't want to see in the blood.    For example Saturated fat.  We know excess Saturated fat in the blood is a bad thing, so it makes sense to limit the intake right?  It turns out if you are burning fat, most of us burn Saturated fatty acids preferentially, so you'll have less in your blood.  It turns out that if you have zero Saturated fats in your diet, you still make them from glucose excess to immediate requirements and because you have enough energy from glucose you aren't burning fat - so the stuff you make hangs about in your blood.  Paradoxically if you eat Saturated fat (and no carbs) you'll have less in your blood.  Cholesterol isn't as clear cut.  Some people really are sensitive to cholesterol in their diet.  But most of us manufacture most of our cholesterol.  Perhaps we need an easily available diagnostic test to discriminate the hyper and hypo responders rather than trying to give everyone a cookie cutter dietary proscription.  Same for Salt.  IMO."

ketoscience,3aoghv,John-AtWork,7,Mon Jun 22 20:05:16 2015 UTC,"We've known for over 100 years that some people who have high blood pressure seem to crave salt.  In the 40s there was a doctor (Walter Kempner) who became famous for curing people of high BP by restricting their salt.    The theory goes that when we eat too much salt we have more in our blood than in surrounding tissue which sets up an osmotic gradient that draws water into the blood (from the surrounding tissue) which increases the pressure inside the blood vessels.  In the 50s we almost lost our minds over an apparent surge of deaths from heart disease, and high BP was identified as a major risk factor.  In the 70s a researcher, named Lewis Dahl, discovered they could induce high blood pressure in rats by over feeding them salt (a human equivalent of half a kg per day).  The same guy discovered an apparent correlation between populations with high salt consumption (like Japan) and high BP and deaths by strokes.    Importantly no one has yet been able to find the same correlation with sodium intake within populations, indicating that there may be other factors.  Lewis Dahl testified before the McGovern commission (of course he did) and since 1977 we've been telling people to reduce the salt in their diet for decades, based on the assumption that reducing salt for everyone will reduce the CVD risk for everyone.  All based on the work of a ""great man"" - Lewis Dahl (the salty rat guy).  It's a similar outcome to the one from following Ancel Keyes' diet heart hypothesis.  We've spent billions to since to find evidence to back this up and the data has been stubborn.  The Intersalt study in 1988 found no correlation between sodium intake and hypertension, in fact they found that the cohort that ate the most salt (14g/day) had lower BP than those who ate the least (7g/day).    There have been a bunch of meta analyses of salt reduction studies and the results have been inconclusive because humans have a high variability in their response to salt.  African Americans, for example, seem to be more prone to hypersensitivity to salt as are the elderly.  There is also evidence that for some people the very process of transitioning to a low salt diet can increase BP, specifically because one response to a cut in salt intake is release of an enzyme called rennin and a hormone called aldosterone that both increase BP.  I find Gary Taubes to be an excellent source for debunking nutrition's ""Great men"" - http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/opinion/sunday/we-only-think-we-know-the-truth-about-salt.html?_r=0  Keto Bonus: Those of us on regimes to lower our insulin (ie: keto) are (literally) flushing sodium away as Insulin causes the kidneys to reabsorb the salts they have filtered out of the blood - lower your insulin by not eating carbs and your sodium (and potassium/magnesium) levels drop.  Personally I add salt to my food in response to taste signalling (craving something salty).  I use a lite salt, and eat a moderate potassium diet to ensure that I have plenty of sodium and potassium and trust my kidneys to regulate the ratio.  I also supplement with magnesium in response to signalling from my bowel."

In the evening I'd had Bone broth emulsified with a table spoon of coconut oil and psyllium husk.

ketoscience,3aoghv,easylocarb,3,Sun Jun 28 07:29:39 2015 UTC,"It turns out that if you have zero Saturated fats in your diet, you still make them from glucose excess to immediate requirements and because you have enough energy from glucose you aren't burning fat - so the stuff you make hangs about in your blood.   I'm confused, how does not eating saturated fats make someone have excessive amounts of glucose?"
ketoscience,3aoghv,Bergolies,3,Mon Jun 22 12:21:03 2015 UTC,"I think he's saying that your body will make saturated fats from excess glucose already in you, not that the lack of SFs will create more glucose."
ketoscience,3aoghv,easylocarb,3,Mon Jun 22 12:41:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I meant.    If you eat more glucose than you need for energy for whatever you are doing right now, to top up your glucose storage (glycogen in your liver and muscle cells), or for the 5 grams or so in your blood - then it is converted in the liver and fat cells into Palmitic acid (a saturated fat).  If you eat just the right amount of glucose for the above - you don't need to make any fat."

ketoscience,3anix2,cruxfire,6,Sun Jun 21 23:28:38 2015 UTC,"How about some science to it. Your liver will store about 500 calories of glycogen first, then muscles will store about 2,000 calories of glycogen. Interesting thing is once glycogen is in the muscle there's no way to pull it back into the bloodstream. If you eat a ton of carbs in one sitting you'll overload your muscles and liver and it'll get converted to fat. So seems like the max stored calories is about 2,500. Your brain uses about 600 calories a day, so, in 24 hours it should burn through everything in the liver and switch to ketones. So, seems like the max would be 24 hours before your brain was on ketones, might take longer for some muscles to be depleted and switch. Oh, and btw, there are only about 5 grams of glucose in the blood stream, so negligible."

De Novo Lipogensis (DNL) rarely seems to happen with short term overfeeding of fat free, fructose free carbs. http://caloriesproper.com/are-carbs-stored-as-fat/  But yes, you're correct, it's about 24-36 hours without eating that puts a human into ketosis, which I believe we enter ketosis faster than any other animal. http://caloriesproper.com/ketosis-in-an-evolutionary-context/"
ketoscience,3anix2,Naonin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"So, would it be your opinion that fasting for 48 or 72 hours would bring you into Ketosis instead of 2-3 weeks that has been reported by Dr. Tim Noakes?"
ketoscience,3anix2,illogic_bomb,2,Wed Jun 24 00:39:21 2015 UTC,"Also a bad idea. The most nitrogen loss occurs in the first three days.   Realistically, your body doesn't produce enough enzymes to fully digest the fat you eat for the first two weeks or so. That's partially why you get diarrhea/constipation sometimes at the start. So eat fat and protein.   Keeping protein in the right range (.8g/# lbm works for everyone to get solid ketone readings, though evidence as to whether this is optimal is still up for debate) will prevent muscle loss in those first few weeks.   And fat is not anti ketogenic so there is no reason to avoid it. Get in some energy and train your body to produce more lipase (an important reason to include magnesium) by eating fat.   I'm going to leave the above as I look at your question again and see you're comparing lengths of time. Whoops lol.  It's not of my opinion, it's a fact. All humans enter ketosis within 36 hours maximum of not consuming carbs or any food. Keto adaptation however takes 3-4 weeks for mental benefits and 8-12 weeks for athletic adaptation (and I believe another minor adaptation around 6 months and ~14 months).   Make sure Noakes said enter ketosis and not adapt. Also, realize the way people talk about it in most keto forums is that ""it takes 3-4 weeks to enter ketosis because you feel bad for that long and being in ketosis feels good, therefore you're obviously not in ketosis beforehand"". A perfect example of why anecdotal evidence sucks."

ketoscience,3anix2,Naonin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"The 2-3 weeks is how long it takes for your body to switch from ketones to fatty acids and save more ketones for your brain, allowing the brain to further reduce its glucose requirement. Entering ketosis takes 3 days max if you stop carbs. Fasting from a carb-fed state is never advised. Those 2- 3 days will be spent rapidly catabolizing your protein into glucose. If you want to fast, always get into ketosis first and best to adapt the full 3 weeks or more before fasting to minimize protein loss. To re-enter ketosis as fast as possible, the smart thing to do is HIIT sprints and/or a full-body depletion-style weight lifting workout. This will transfer your liver glycogen to your muscles within a few hours and you will be instantly in ketosis. The wise thing to do is to never leave ketosis in the first place. If you are anticipating carbs, try to time the exercise right before you have them and keep it under 1500 calories."

ketoscience,3aoyep,FXOjafar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:35:12 2015 UTC,"The number seem quite ok and similar to mine. The so called ""Dawn Phenomenon"" as I understand it, is your body gearing up with some glucose to wake you up. I've tested from morning to night before and after meals, and generally I go down to the low 4s (lowest ever was 3.4mmol woohoo!) in the evening from a morning high of 5-6mmol. The higher reading usually comes if I have a bad night's sleep. I think that's related to higher stress (cortisol) from waking up tired and unsatisfied."

ketoscience,3aed3o,ashsimmonds,6,Fri Jun 19 16:42:47 2015 UTC,"Well, it first references ""Overcoming adrenal fatigue"" which is not an accepted term and is an entirely bullshit way to explain whatever may actually be happening to someone.  I have seen no proof that low carb diets increase cortisol. Eating too little for too long increases cortisol, excessive cardio increases cortisol, and stresses in daily life may increase it.  I think the majority of ""problems"" like this, associated with keto/low carb are missattributed as many people are initially eating at a deficit to lose weight."

Care to explain this approach, as to me it seems the wrong way round.

ketoscience,3a4ajc,ELeeMacFall,4,Wed Jun 17 04:54:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a T1 myself. Keto has been great for me. I'm down to around 15-20% of the amount of insulin I was taking before, which is due to a combination of the diet itself and also the weight I've lost. Obviously if your dad doesn't need to lose weight it will be different for him, but regardless, smaller doses of insulin mean better control, making both high and low sugar levels less likely to occur.  But regarding hypos and treatment: it shouldn't take more than one or two glucose tablets to treat a hypo, right? And that's only 4-8 grams of carbs. Which means in that contingency he would need to be more restrictive than normal about carb avoidance, but otherwise he should be fine. When I've had to do that I just ate spinach instead of broccoli, or something like that, in order to avoid the incidental net carbs that I would otherwise have eaten throughout the day.  Also, 25g of net carb per day is a good rule of thumb, but most people can eat more than that and be ok. Others here can correct me if I'm wrong but IIRC the average maximum carb intake in order to stay in ketosis is around 40g/day, so the 25g limit actually gives you a bit of room for exigent circumstances."
ketoscience,3a4ajc,causalcorrelation,3,Wed Jun 17 04:59:48 2015 UTC,"I love what has been suggested so far. It's tough to beat what Dr. Bernstein has to say about diabetes, and the insights he has gained from it extend even to non-diabetics.  Still, I feel two things are missing from this discussion.    One is a motivator.  Check out this video of a T1 diabetic radiologist, who details his journey from diagnosis to healing through low carb diet. I find it extremely inspirational, and am not a diabetic.  The other is a primer on T1 diabetes. I have not been able to find a popular book on the subject, and so I cannot recommend one. I can give you an ultra-condensed version here, and encourage you to ask for elaboration. A great deal of the confusion on how to treat diabetes stems from patients not really knowing anything about it.  T1 diabetes is usually caused by an autoimmune response that destroys the population of beta cells in the pancreas. The beta cells produce insulin, and are not found elsewhere in the body. Insulin, of course, is a hormone with lots of effects in the body; too many to list right now, but let's say its primary function is to prevent glucose in the blood from going too high. In the pancreas are also most of the alpha cells. Alpha cells produce glucagon, which has a multitude of functions, primary among these is to keep blood glucose from going too low. Beta and alpha cells regulate each other. In T1 diabetics, the alpha cells are less regulated because there are so few beta cells, so blood glucose tends to rise no matter what they eat. This is why T1 diabetics must have insulin. The vicious cycle of requiring more insulin to control blood sugar spikes, and more carbohydrate intake to control low blood sugar, comes from this dysregulation of the alpha cells.  Blood sugar behaves unpredictably for two reasons: first, blood can store very little sugar, and so a tiny miscalculation of carbohydrate intake is all it takes to make a mistake and send glucose either too high or too low; second, there are alpha cells in the stomach, and they respond to food volume by raising blood sugar by the mechanisms of glucagon; most diabetics respond to this by assuming they underestimated their carbohydrate intake, so they take more insulin, which sends them into hypoglycemia and therefore into needing to eat more carbs.   It's obviously more complicated than this, but I feel like this is a very good starting point.  Don't be afraid to keep asking."
ketoscience,3a4ajc,BeefyTits,2,Wed Jun 17 14:11:53 2015 UTC,"The body can synthesize glucose from protein through a process called gluconeogenesis. Unlike protein and fat, a person can live without eating carbohydrates. Your body and (most of) your brain can run on ketone bodies, which are produced when the body breaks down fat - which is used in the place of glucose."
ketoscience,3a4ajc,callesen58,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:22:27 2015 UTC,Ah ok... This makes sense. When he first starts the diet though will his blood sugar drop dramatically? This is what I'm most nervous about.
ketoscience,3a4ajc,easylocarb,3,Wed Jun 17 03:26:08 2015 UTC,"He will need to measure his blood glucose and adjust his insulin dosage to avoid hypoglycemia, yes. He will generally need less insulin on a ketogenic diet.  If possible get the assistance of medical personnel in adjusting his protein intake to the lowest possible level where he is still in nitrogen balance, since that will reduce cancer viability.  Furthermore, butyrate! Butyrate! Butyrate! Either get him some inulin (Aka chicory fiber) to supplement with or some direct butyrate (Commonly sodium butyrate) supplements. Butyrate inhibits histone deacetylase, which makes it a potent inhibitor of cancer cell growth. Direct butyrate supplementation may be the best, since there is some evidence of impaired butyrate synthesis in people with type 1 diabetes. Butyrate will benefit him even if he doesn't go on a ketogenic diet! The ideal may be tributyrin, which is a butyrate triglyceride, but it may be hard to source."

There is a mechanism behind it though that is beyond your question for clarity.  PS. Animal Tissue (liver,brains etc), meat, poultry, fish and seafood are among the best sources of glutamine.

ketoscience,39qqe1,MezDez,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:26:07 2015 UTC,"Err no you are wrong again.  Before keto adaptation they are absorbed quicker because peripheral cells uptake ketones. once keto adaptation takes place, peripheral cells use fatty acids (a byproduct of ketones is produced, which increases blood ketones again). and 99% of ketones is reserved for the brain.  In fact, its harder to detect blood ketones when you arent ketoadapted. THe reason why blood ketones MAY decrease after adaptation, it is because the fact that your peripheral cells are now insulin resistant and no longer partake glycolysis. So the glucose produced from protein, and from the carbs you eat, tend to increase insulin levels a bit higher than it used to, thereby reducing ketone formation. Protein is not required at the same amount when you are still adapting.  Go read Lyle McDonalds bible ""The Ketogenic Diet"" before you start spinning shit, it has it written in black and white"

So-called ""adaptation"" is actually pretty rapid, people just prolong it with diet excursions. You'll find in the complete absence of food your mitochondria very quickly ""learn"" to use ketones, or else, well, you die.    So onto part two of title question - what about a long-term ketard carbing up? Earlier this week I ate pizza (it was free at work for massive overtime coding efforts, thought it a good time for testing) and tested my blood - it was scary, as in my blood glucose after a few slices of pizza where I only ate about 1/4 of the base was hovering around ~9.8, my usual post-prandial BG is ~5.0 and fasting 3-4.5.    The acetone v acetoacetate v pyruvate v acetyl-CoA v whatever stuff is still hugely in contention, and I don't agree with the keto/health gurus on what's appropriate/optimal levels, I think they're mostly stuck in false biomarker logic - like days of old where cholesterol levels supposedly denoted heart health."

ketoscience,39ppvc,ashsimmonds,2,Sun Jun 14 22:45:45 2015 UTC,"To start I'm not using ketostix for this because it isn't providing meaningful data. Ketonuria doesn't give me present-state data on ketonemia so it's useless, even assuming it's without ""technical error.""   What is your hypothesize on how the proportion of measured acetone and measured acetoacetic acid would change between the fasting state, and the normal ketogenic diet?   I'd expect to see higher concentrations of both. Glucose and ketone levels are inversely proportional over time due to the nature of how insulin affects various processes.  There is still an upper bound to this concentration due to the acidic nature of ketone bodies overloading the buffering capabilities of the body. At this point insulin will get released and the level will drop.   How would it change if the ketogenic diet user were to suddenly carb up?   Ketone levels would drop as the availability of oxaloacetate increases and glucose forms the primary energy requirements of the body and the ketones get flushed from the kidneys.  Due to downregulation of glucose transports a person who is keto-adapted will not be able to utilize the glucose as efficiently as someone who isn't keto-adapted so it may take longer to flush out said ketones. This lasts up to ~48 hours.   This suggests to me that the proportion of acetone to acetoacetic acid ketone bodies in the system would change between regular consumption of a ketogenic diet, and a starving state, where energy economy in the body obviously changes.   Acetone is a one way conversion of acetoacetate and is spontaneous. More acetoacetate, more acetone. I see no reason to believe this ratio would increase or decrease from a hypothetical perspective simply because there is more acetoacetate."

Could it not be used to predict present-state data, perhaps combined with other factors, such as blood glucose?   Absolutely not. You are talking about a multivariate equation that would rival some quantum physics calculations. I wouldn't even bother doing this not to mention it is completely unnecessary.   Wouldn't glucose remain relatively constant during a fasted state?    Sure.   Wouldn't insulin levels considering the individual isn't eating anything?   No. Insulin levels would drop.   Why would high ketone body levels cause more release of insulin and why would this release affect ketone bodies?   Because ketone bodies are acidic and the body has to adjust accordingly. This is why non-diabetics cannot achieve diabetic ketoacidosis - the body will start producing insulin, which will shut down ketogenesis, switch fuel sources to glucose and thereby cause the now excess ketones to get burned off and/or flushed through the kidneys into the urine.   I thought insulin only regulated glucose.   Perhaps directly. Did you know the kidneys product glucose as well?"

ketoscience,39k5o2,callesen58,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:26:16 2015 UTC,"Your psychiatrist is either retarded and/or doesn't know you are on a ketogenic diet. You being lethargic is because Ritalin contains D-amphetamine AND L-amphetamine, which interacts with both noradrenaline (Or norepinephrine) and dopamine. D-amphetamine interacts only with dopamine. Let me explain why that matters.  It is not uncommon for ketogenic diets to fundamentally alter neurotransmitter homoeostasis. I believe many in this sub are familiar with the upregulation of GABA and the downregulation of glutamate. There is strong reason to believe that noradrenaline is upregulated in the ketotic state as it may be linked to blood glucose, as this fasting study shows (http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/71/6/1511.long). Noradrenaline stimulates both gluconeogenesis and fat oxidation. High levels of gluconeogenesis blocks ketogenesis, making you enter ""low-carb hell"" (The place betweeen ketogenesis and adequate dietary carbohydrate for a glucose-dependent brain)  You have most likely taken Ritalin before with no side effects, but that was before you went on a low carb diet. Given that Noradrenaline upregulates gluconeogenesis, it is no surprise you feel lethargic. It literally puts you in the same low-carb hell as some are in during ketoflu, and it will continue as long as you take your Ritalin.  As such, you need to ditch the L-amphetamine and get a pure D-amphetamine medicine. The natural upregulation of noradrenaline on a ketogenic diet most likely means you don't even need the effects of L-amphetamine any more."

Strattera only increases noradrenaline, so stay away from that as it might just make the lethargy even worse. You need something that only affects dopamine.

ketoscience,39k5o2,callesen58,2,Sat Jun 13 13:32:35 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I noted that in a comment further down the thread. Though it doesn't matter, the issue is still the upregulation of noradrenaline blocking ketogenesis through excessive gluconeogenesis.  Whether Ritalin or Adderall have the same effect on noradrenaline is something I don't know, though.  Edit: They don't. The primary difference is that methylphenidate is an uptake inhibitor while L-amphetamine is both an uptake inhibitor and stimulates the release of noradrenaline (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1471-4159.1997.68052032.x/epdf)."
ketoscience,39k5o2,FrigoCoder,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:39:45 2015 UTC,Ritalin is specific to dopamine transporters. But I remember something about dopamine transporters in the prefrontal cortex also being responsible for noradrenaline transport.
ketoscience,39k5o2,callesen58,2,Sat Jun 13 13:52:21 2015 UTC,"Ritalin is more effective for noradrenaline transport than dopamine transport: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20691429  Edit: This part of the study is also relevant:   Interestingly, NET has greater affinity for DA than for NE (30), and whether DAT or NET is the predominant protein clearing DA depends on the abundance of the two transporters in a given region (31). In mice, 0.75 mg/kg MPH administered orally increased DA content in the frontal cortex, without producing significant changes in NE levels (32). Because the ED50 estimate of MPH for NET (0.14 mg/kg) is lower than that for DAT (0.25 mg/kg), it is possible that lower doses of MPH inhibit dopamine reuptake by blocking NET, rather than DAT. Medications such as atomoxetine could actually exert their therapeutic effects through DA reuptake inhibition even though they are “norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors”. That is, even though atomoxetine blocks only NET and not DAT, its therapeutic effects could be due to DA reuptake inhibition because NET in the PFC may be required for DA reuptake."

The issue is that while dopamine upregulation by blocking noradrenaline reuptake may work in the brain, it's unlikely to work the same outside the brain.  The bottom line is that noradrenaline interferes with ketogenesis when in excess, which it will be when the reuptake is inhibited. Methylphenidate doesn't just act on the brain after all."

ketoscience,39fpvt,ketoquest,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:38:48 2015 UTC,"Lyle McDonald, The Ketogenic Diet, pp. 58-59   In a maintenance calorie diet study, six subjects were given 2,800 calories with 135 grams of protein, 40 grams of carbohydrate and 235 grams of fat for a period of 6 days (15). This was compared to a diet containing 135 grams of protein, 40 grams of fat, and 475 grams of carbohydrate. Both diet groups were in positive nitrogen balance from the first day of the study. As well, the 40 grams of carbohydrate in the ketogenic group spared some protein breakdown. It would be expected that a lower carbohydrate intake would require a larger intake of protein to avoid nitrogen losses.   ...   In a second maintenance calorie diet study, subjects received 1.75 g protein/kg ideal body weight daily (17). Nitrogen balance was attained in most subjects by the second week of the study. However, since the study did not list how many grams of protein were given to each subject, it is impossible to determine how much additional protein would have been needed to establish nitrogen balance from the first day. This study simply supports the idea that nitrogen balance can be attained quickly on a ketogenic diet, provided that sufficient protein is consumed.   ...   In another study, eight men were placed on diets of 1800 calories, containing 115 grams of 58 protein for 9 weeks (18). Carbohydrate intake varied from 104 grams to 60 grams to 30 grams. Although all three groups were in ketosis to some degree (especially during the first three weeks), we will only consider that 30 and 60 carbohydrate gram diets as truly ketogenic diets. Nitrogen balance was slightly negative during the first week of the diet. Approximately 2 grams of nitrogen were lost, equating to 13 grams of protein converted to glucose, meaning that 22 additional grams of protein would have been required to attain nitrogen balance. Added to the 115 grams of protein given, this yields a total of 137 grams of protein to prevent all nitrogen losses. Nitrogen balance was achieved during week 2 and became slightly positive during the third week.   ...   In a third study, which examined the metabolic effects of a variety of different dietary approaches, subjects were studied under a total of 6 different dietary conditions (19). We are only concerned with three of them. The first was a 400 calorie diet consisting of 100 grams of protein. In this group the average negative nitrogen balance was -2 grams, the equivalent of 12 grams of body protein broken down to make glucose. An additional 20 grams of dietary protein (for a total of 120 grams/day) would have provided this amount of glucose and prevented any nitrogen losses. When you consider that even 100 grams of protein was unable to prevent nitrogen losses, it is no surprise that studies using less protein (often only 50 grams per day) than this fail to show nitrogen sparing with ketogenic diets.  The second dietary approach we are concerned with was a group given 800 calories as 200 grams of protein. In this group, there was a positive nitrogen balance of almost 8 grams/day, the equivalent of 48 grams of protein. This suggests that a protein intake of 152 grams would have been sufficient to achieve nitrogen balance, supporting the value of 150 grams from the previous section.  A third group was given 400 calories of protein and 400 calories of fat and showed the same negative nitrogen balance as the 400 calories of protein only. This points out that the fat intake/calorie level of a ketogenic diet does not affect nitrogen balance. Meaning that, protein calories are far more important than fat calories in terms of achieving nitrogen balance on a ketogenic diet.  This study is interesting as it shows that nitrogen balance can be attained essentially regardless of calorie level as long as sufficient protein intake is consumed, as has another study (20). The difference between the two values for protein intake determined in this study (120 grams and 152 grams) cannot be explained from the data presented.

I am still experiencing actually,but I am also starting to work out more,so we will see how those extra 25 pounds will react.  Quote from the article you gave me the link. Protease inhibitors inhibit some of the key enzymes that help us digest protein. The best known of these protease enzymes is trypsin. Most of the USDA studies performed over the years have looked at trypsin inhibitors in soybeans, but these anti-nutrients are also found in other beans, grains, nuts, seeds, vegetables of the nightshade family (potatoes, tomatoes and eggplant) and various fruits and vegetables.  Traditionally, few of these foods caused health problems because they were rarely eaten every day and because cooking deactivates most of the protease inhibitors. But given the growing tendency to fill up on plant foods, and the fashionability of al dente cooking and “live food” (raw) vegan diets, more and more people are eating foods with their protease inhibitor content intact. Proponents of plant-based diets generally believe their diets provide plenty of protein, but this premise fails to take into account the fact that protein swallowed is not the same as protein digested when protease inhibitors are in the picture. Without high-quality, usable protein, growth, repair, immunity, hormone formation and all metabolic processes will suffer.  The conclusions are that ""the dangers"" are for the ones who eat a lot of soy and for the ones who eat ""raw food"" and seeds."

I don't know exactly why so I am going to experiment a but the following things happened.  Last week I went to a friend's house for an occasion and had a super high carb and sugar meal and drinks. That night I woke up in the middle of the night with a 10 reading and immediately started exercising until it went down to a level which allowed me to sleep.  Since then I have been back on my very low carb diet and it's fallen steadily since.   The other thing is that every night I have a drink with one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, water and a bit of raw stevia leaf.  Two nights ago I added a calcium and magnesium powder to that mix. Also accidentally I took an extra berberine that day (1600mg total instead of 1200 for the day) and the next morning my blood was 5.5, previous day it was 6.7.   Yesterday I did the same things again and voila it was low again.   Today I am going to leave out the calcium supplement but take the extra berberine and see if I get the same result. If I do then tomorrow I won't take the extra berberine and see what happens.  I may have stumbled on something here. My highest reading in the last two days is 6.0 which was two hours after a meal."

ketoscience,39fpvt,saralt,2,Fri Jun 26 10:22:36 2015 UTC,4.2 to 5.2 is pretty good. That's normal range right?  Last night I did my usual routine but omitted the cal-mag powder. This morning my reading was 6.0 so that's a big jump.  Before I went to bed I was at 4.3.    Tonight I think I will add back the cal-mag and see if it goes down .5 or not.  Berberine has worked well for me. The studies I read administered three pills of 500mg each.  I could only get 400mg pills and had been taking three of those. Adding the fourth one seems to have made a difference so I guess you need to be over 1500mg per day.  I really need to do a fast myself. I want to do a three day fast on nothing but water.

It might be worth looking into if you have stalls. It would only speed things up since low carbing would lower your blood sugar over time anyhow.
ketoscience,39c9wn,JLMA,9,Wed Jun 10 20:12:19 2015 UTC,"Protein meals give an explosive dose of insulin for at least a couple of hours. Hence your initial assumptions miss a vital piece of information that makes them unable to differentiate the diets based on Insulin alone.  Most of the confusion in keto comes from Gary Taubes that in his desire to be popular he has made it so simplistic, that it's wrong.  Insulin isn't only a carb thing.  If that kind of insulin isn't enough for it (which it probably is) it's also known that the body doesn't have ON (full) and OFF (zero) switches, just tendencies.  PS. The reality is more complex than just Insulin or a baseline tendency for stuff to happen. e.g. Sugar isn't around on low carb, however, it's still needed, so some of it all of it will have to come from protein and fat. On high carb though there's already a sugar overdose so that need is zero. During that process on low carb, glucagon is often working together with insulin after meals (protein meals, but most of them are protein+fat meals anyway). Glucagon is pushing sugar out of glycogen reserves because with the simultaneous action of Insulin (which mainly happens in order to anabolize amino acids to tissues that need them), sugar has to also stay high enough (and not become hypoglycemic because of Insulin alone) . Most of the problems people have isn't because the body can't handle certain types of states, but because it's not evolved to handle OVERDOSE AMOUNTS of certain nutrients (usually sugar)."

Then again we may be unfair, in a sense that he may just be naive and just not know it.  PS. A good way to simplify it without saying something wrong is to say ""the body is illequipped to handle an overdose of blood sugar"", because in the end that's exactly the problem; it's not that there is no insulin, it's not that the body can't handle some nutrients at all, it's that it's not evolved to handle an overdose of some of them because it wasn't used to it when it was evolving."

We aren't apex predators (historically here) rather we evolved as scavengers and small game hunters.  The best information we have is that brains, marrow and other organs were our food of choice because predators couldn't crack bones and skulls the way we could.

I'm surprised I reached to that point but I think before someone is very slim, fat in food doesn't really have to be huge because you know, the body doesn't really want to become thin as stick, it still has a tendency to keep a good reserve. After all even the ancient hunter would become chubby for a few months if he found unlimited food for a while because he would require a contingency for possible future months of famine.

Yes, and look how that's working out.   Demonising carbohydrate foods can therefore be misleading, because although foods are often grouped together as carbohydrates, there is a great deal of variety between the food types.   Demonising any food type is misleading, but the evidence for carbohydrates being a problem in quantities is there and building.   Carbohydrate foods provide essential nutrients, fibre and are an important fuel for the helpful bacteria that live in our gut. The bacteria, or probiotics, are now known to help with prevention of bowel disease.   I don't know enough to counter this, but does fibre solely come from carbs? How many carbs do your gut bacteria need?"

ketoscience,399k5f,darthluiggi,-6,Fri Jun 12 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean by 'exercise'. For ultra-endurance events, LCHF has potential for some. But, for ordinary events, you'd have a hard time making a case for it unless you're doing it quite slowly. Even proponents usually take some carbs to exercise. And I highly doubt you'd find a top-level athlete in running for example who would use it.  Kidney problems: sorry, high protein is absolutely hard on the kidneys and for diabetics who already tend to have renal damage, I'd be very worried about it and certainly not without medical supervision.  Fibre is carbs, yes.  As for the rest, read it again. They are NOT proposing a high carb diet, they are very careful to use moderate language. They are clearly calling for some caution, not demonising anything. One could only object to it if you have a fundamentalist view of keto.  Edit: my problem with keto is that proponents tend to say it's suitable for everyone no matter what their health or goals, all fats seem to be equal, it should be done forever even though no studies support this and so on. This is an extreme position IMO. I don't accept such an extreme."
ketoscience,399k5f,ABabyAteMyDingo,7,Wed Jun 10 11:41:56 2015 UTC,"You're not on /r/keto friend. The nuances are well understood. There are no Atkins disciples here. Anyway the paragraph specifically references the paleo diet, not even keto, which encourages lots of fiber and even a bit of fruit in moderation. (Keto does too for the record, just minus the fruit.) The only whole foods excluded are basically grains and starches -- it should be totally uncontroversial at this point to say that such things should be avoided by diabetics.  And neither keto nor paleo are high protein diets. You have to really be trying hard to push protein up to the point where it becomes a problem. Most still eating medium to high carb diets could probably stand to do better with more protein not less.  And finally top-level athletes typically rely on explosive movements. It's true that this is something that is much better achieved with full glycogen stores. /r/ketogains has quite a few experienced lifters who eat keto and take glucose only before workouts for this reason. But as you seemingly reluctantly qualified, for endurance LCHF is winning converts rapidly as an alternative to downing gel after gel. Fact is, if you don't need explosive movements, you don't need to pre-load carbs."
ketoscience,399k5f,hot_rats_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:07:58 2015 UTC,"Ok, this is where I have difficulty in these discussions. The definitions of Atkins, Keto, LCHF and paleo are highly variable and it can be unclear exactly what we're referring to.  For my clarity, can you define what you mean by keto and Atkins and the difference between them?   for endurance LCHF is winning converts rapidly as an alternative to downing gel after gel   I think this may be overstating it. I think there are very few people who do competitive events with keto and I really don't see that changing much.  I agree carbs are more 'explosive' but where is the cut-off? Anything up to Ironman is certainly normally done using carbs. Perhaps slow events longer than this (multi-day hikes?) could theoretically benefit from going keto? I wouldn't call Ironman 'explosive' though.  Overall, unless i'm mistaken, you seem to be agreeing with my moderate and non-extreme position? If so, I welcome a little nuance as you say, it's the extreme views I find hard to take. Keto does intrigue me and I have tried it myself. I just remain questioning and healthily sceptical about some claims about it. My only goal here is to discuss, not argue."

LCHF = Self-explanatory Atkins = Was using him to refer to the idea that all fats are generally equal, generally accepted to have contributed to the demise of his health.    I'm not arguing that carb-burning is still by far the most popular mode of endurance athletics, but that is to be expected after decades of the proliferation of mainstream misinformation. There are certainly people doing low-carb Ironman quite successfully. However, to be competitive for time in anything will involve a degree of what I would call explosiveness, if the goal is to beat everyone else. But if we're just talking general fitness your body will generally have an easier time engaging in prolonged endurance in a more fat-adapted state. And if we're talking metabolic disease like diabetes, getting the body into a fat-adapted state is probably the single most beneficial measure one can take."

I'm glad to hear all fat is not equal, this is one of my bugbears. So many seem to conclude keto means they can eat bacon all day long. You may lose weight on that, but your bowels won't thank you when.  The thing about Ironman or any events is that as far as I'm concerned, doing it as quickly as possible is paramount. I am/was an athlete and I care about doing well. By that measure, carbs are unavoidable (probably). If you just want to finish, maybe fat can work, true.  For more typical events like running a 5K, well clearly carbs will be optimal for competitiveness. There's no way a top 5K athlete would use LCHF IMO. If keto is indeed a good choice for health overall, there will be a trade-off between speed and health. Or else you would need to use carbs for racing and keto for the rest of the time I imagine.  Again, don't get me wrong, I would love the hype about keto to be true. If it actually achieves half of what is claimed for it, it would be a major success.  Where I get concerned is the claim's made that keto is optimal for all people regardless of health, weight and goals. I just don't buy that.

You may as well try and determine how much oil is in your engine by looking at the fuel gauge.  Stop using ketostix as they are:   Inaccurate Cannot measure ketosis directly. One must infer and one never has enough data to accurately measure in the first place. Are prone to false positives Cannot measure ketosis Are measuring the ketones in your urine in present state.

To answer the one you actually did ask:   I know ketostix don't really give you a true level because it's not a blood test, but what might be a reason for these results?    You could have gotten moisture on the stick before you pissed on it Assuming the results are accurate, you are spilling excess acetoacetate into your urine. Your body isn't fully utilizing what ketones you are making or you ingested food such that it increased your insulin and halted ketogenesis as well as utilization of ketones for a primary fuel source. You could have taken a supplement that is causing ketone spillage. You could have drank alcohol, caused an excess amount of ketones to be created and they are being dumped. You could have had blood ketone concentration around 5-6 mmol/L and caused excess ketone spillage.   There's no way you'll ever know.  Donate them to a diabetic, the human they were intended for.

Some call it ultra-keto which I think is mistaken.  Zerocarb differs to keto in two significant areas: zerocarb pays little attention to macronutrient composition, and like vegetarianism is primarily concerned with the provenance of the nutrition. Vlchf by contrast pays little attention to the source of the nutrition and concentrates wholly on the macronutrient composition. Secondly zc does not attempt a scientific justification for superiority, instead it trusts that those who practice it do so because it works. Vlchf by contrast very much wants to be taken seriously and perhaps even appears to be locked in contest with hclf diets.  What effect does that have? Nothing relevant to zc. Ketogenesis on zc is likely to be depressed compared to keto. This because an abundance of dietary and serum amino acids may prevent mitochondrial depletion of oxalacetate, thus allowing AcetylCoA to continue entering the citric acid cycle instead of being reduced to acetoacetate.  This is irrelevant because Zerocarb as far as I understand it is not claiming to be a well-formulated ketogenic diet, ketosis is not the goal.  Zerocarb can be practiced in a moderate-protein high-fat version, in which case it would be almost indistinguishable from a carnivorous keto version.  The similarity lies in the depression of blood glucose levels both on keto and vlchf.  There can be overlap in the way some people diet from paleo to keto to Zerocarb, but each of these diets is distinct enough for practitioners of the canonical version to not associate with the canonical version of the others.  The science applies to all of them, equally, with the consequences varying depending on the diet and the individual."

ketoscience,394nti,StupidStudentVeteran,23,Tue Jun 9 06:00:56 2015 UTC,"Net carbs are an entirely American concept. It has to do with including fiber in the carbohydrate total, meaning that net carbs is just actual carbohydrate minus the listed fiber content. In Europe fiber is listed separately from carbohydrate, because we are just better.  Unfermentable fiber has no way to contribute to glucose and/or oxaloacetate. Fermentable fiber is mostly pretty pro-ketogenic, since it ferments into loads of acetate, butyrate and other even-numbered short-chain fatty acids. Some fibers produce high levels of odd-numbered SFCAs, like propionate, which are gluconeogenic but even then 1g of such a fiber would end up at MOST about 0.10-0.15g glucose. That tiny amount of glucose is likely to be dwarfed by the effect of all the acetate, butyrate etc produced."
ketoscience,394nti,callesen58,2,Tue Jun 9 10:01:42 2015 UTC,"Do you know, if those fiber carbs do not contribute to glucose/oxaloacetate, are they essentially ignored by the body as usable calories?

ketoscience,394nti,packet_wrangler,4,Tue Jun 9 13:43:20 2015 UTC,"The calories fiber contributes is pretty darn complex. Unfermentable fiber is pretty simple, since it contributes negative calories, since they reduce transit time in the small intestine. It's why almonds for instance have lower calories than you would otherwise expect.  Fermentable fiber and partially fermentable fiber is the complex part. It depends heavily on the type of fiber (It's composition and structure) as well as your gut bacteria. Inulin, for instance, has 1.6 kcal per gram. The calories from inulin come mainly from butyrate, with the runner up being acetate.  Only odd-chain fatty acids can contribute to glucose and oxaloacetate. Propionate and to a lesser extent valerate are the only precursors for glucose formed from fiber fermentation. However, it's the acetyl-CoA:Oxaloacetate ratio that is important. There is no fiber that is anti-ketogenic, as the fermentation products ALWAYS race acetyl-CoA more than oxaloacetate.  SFCAs are also potent stimulators of AMPK, which enhances their pro-ketogenic potential. When it comes to calories, fiber may contain calories, but they actually lead to a net increase in energy expenditure and fat metabolism due to upregulation of AMPK."

Would you mind elaborating, what types of specific benifits do you mean?  Is there any benefit to taking more than just a little as I have been doing?

ketoscience,394nti,bryanlharris,2,Wed Jun 10 17:29:37 2015 UTC,Fiber is counted in the total calories as 4 kcal / gram. It depends heavily on the type of fiber and the individual how many calories your body can actually utilize. I've seen figures that the average is 2.5 kcal / gram of fiber. You can always look in the toilet and see how much of certain fibrous items pass through essentially whole. Clearly none of that is being used for energy in the body. Isn't celery a negative calorie food? ... It takes more kcals to chew and pass through than can be extracted in digestion.
ketoscience,394nti,erixsparhawk,-2,Tue Jun 9 14:40:57 2015 UTC,I understand all of that. But I could say net-carbs is total carbohydrates minus sodium if I wanted. I guess I am having a hard time understanding why it is satisfactory to just start subtracting total carbohydrates because of fiber.
ketoscience,394nti,callesen58,6,Tue Jun 9 15:19:23 2015 UTC,"Because fiber doesn't contribute any meaningful amounts to glucose and/or oxaloacetate, which is what people avoid on a ketogenic diet. Fiber instead contributes acetyl-CoA, which increases ketosis."

ketoscience,394nti,bryanlharris,2,Tue Jun 9 22:41:57 2015 UTC,Fiber is not a carb. Sodium is not a carb. We put fiber under the carbs but not sodium. Do I have that right?
ketoscience,394nti,handsoffdick,2,Wed Jun 10 01:59:41 2015 UTC,Fiber is a carb chemically but we can't digest it so you can subtract it from the total.
ketoscience,394nti,callesen58,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:41:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  It has to do with early methods of detecting carbohydrate, which were only able to differentiate monosaccharides and disaccharides from polysaccharides. Then eventually polysaccharides were distinguishable into starch and what would then be defined as fiber (Initially by simply spitting in the food, thus providing alpha-amylase which digests the two starch types). Of course today you can identify each and every carbohydrate down to the milligram pretty easily using gaschromatography.  It's simply institutional inertia that has prevented the switch to the European model."

ketoscience,394nti,alsoram,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, but starch is, too. The difference is the kinds of bonds between the monomers. Humans can't effectively cleave the beta 1,4-glycosidic linkages in cellulose, but we can break down the alpha 1,4 and 1,6 linkages present in starch and glycogen. It has to do with bond angles and stereochemistry, if memory serves.   Edit to add: cellulose is a major component of fiber, but hemicellulose is another major component, with additional contributions from pectin, etc."

Just look at Quest Bars.  They're fiber on paper, but most diabetics have to take insulin to get their sugar down after eating one.  Would they have the same issue after eating an equal amount of broccoli fiber?  No, of course not.  So as with most things in diet, you have to do your own experiments.  See what carbohydrates give hunger pangs, drives your glucose up, etc.    Me personally, I'm at the point where I'm trying to avoid carbs as much as I can.  I'm eating the most nutrient dense carbs there are, and that's about it.  Nuts, avocados, even some green leafy vegetables are out and herbs, spices, and hot peppers are in.  I've also increased egg and organ meat consumption.  If I am going to eat any carbs or starch (I have a soft spot for beer), I have it late at night.  After dark, ~9pm.  But during the day, I eat food that controls my hunger as much as possible, which basically means < 5g total carbs.. including the 1/2g in each egg yolk.  TLDR: Net carbs are in your head, do n=1 and see how your blood markers and hunger respond."

It's pretty obvious most of the people that think they require tweaks of that sort do not have a good diet as a basis. I do not automatically consider generally saying ""low carb"" to be a good diet.

This raises the question of whether or not unwitting consumers were the victims of economic exploitation.

So I did that, but didn't worry too much about carbs/sugar because it wasn't really in the guidelines (I even read a diet book that said it was impossible to get fat eating carbs). I followed the advice and continued to gain weight.  The marketing strategy of food companies was so similar to that of the tobacco industry, I actually feel they should be held responsible in some way.  But even fat people who tried to eat right blame themselves kind of like /u/memory_limit.  I think we need to start blaming the industry that told us how good their products are for us and stop feeling guilty.

This is why I have a hard time hating obese people, even obese people who drink tons of pop. They've all, pretty much universally, been fed lies and self-serving bullshit by authority figures. They've been told fat is bad, they haven't been told what adequate protein is, and they've been told ""a calorie is a calorie"" which is bullshit if you know the basics of what insulin resistance is. Sure, you can lose weight on a carb-based diet, but you'll be tired, miserable, and it'll take three times as long. People need to be (for lack of a better term) re-educated.  And honestly, one thing that would help? Fat-based junk foods in corner stores. Lower people's insulin resistance and people will lose weight just on that alone, they'll have more energy, burn more calories, and they'll feel less need to snack more, thus reducing calorie intake. Make it cheesy, chocolately, salty, whatever - and people will go for it.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who has had that experience.  If you don't think either A or B would kick most people out, adjust the scenario so that there is a meaningful difference. At some point too many carbs in one meal will kick you out. 40? 50? 100? However many it is, if you spaced those same carbs out over an extended period it would not, right? I want to explore that.   If people are worrying over carbs in a day but NOT worrying over carbs in a meal, they may be doing it wrong, it seems to me. I think that might matter so I'm just curious if there's some discussion about the difference between short-term ingestion vs. long-term, and at what point it becomes meaningful to think about that. If there's a resource on this already, I'd be happy to read it. I just can't find much of anything on an issue that I would think matters."
ketoscience,38o7d3,I_hate_pugs,8,Fri Jun 5 14:19:22 2015 UTC,"Several factors are at play here. How complex are the carbs and is there any fructose?  30g net carbs from broccoli is much different than 30g from white bread. That being said, your muscles should be aptly ready to take in the glucose in either scenario as glycogen. From my understanding, insulin isn't as big as a factor in determining ketosis as liver glycogen levels. Additionally, as long as your glucagon/insulin ratio is still high, your body will still signal for ketone production. Fructose however can only be metabolized by the liver, so 30g fructose will refill your liver glycogen and temporarily shut off ketone production until your redeplete your liver glycogen. The only way to get 30g of fructose though would be to consume 60g of sugar, so I doubt that's your case.  Sorry for no sources, feel free to correct my view if I said anything blatantly wrong."
ketoscience,38o7d3,Naonin,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:39:18 2015 UTC,"We've all considered this as we get further into keto.   Short answer: it's splitting hairs as long as the carbs are from slow digesting sources (veggies).   Longer answer: assuming the carb sources and protein and fat levels remain constant, fewer carbs will always be more ketogenic. The body still needs energy from somewhere. In fact, those that do intermittent fasting may have lower ketone readings, but I'd argue they are more ketogenic. As in their body is producing and using more ketones. (Reading blood ketones is like trying to determine the mileage of a car while looking in the fuel tank, it's not enough info). So they don't have carbs for the 16 hours they don't eat, they produce and instantly use ketones, rather than having them sit in the blood while the glucose is used.    Getting ""knocked out"" of ketosis is about ingesting too many carbs at once, is it not?   No. Ketosis is regulated by liver glycogen. More liver glycogen = less ketogenic. Specifically, you should look at oxaloacetate and how that interacts with acetyl-coa. Oxaloacetate is the primary regulator of ketosis, no oxaloacetate, ketones will be produced."

In Norway, the upper limit for potassium in dietary supplement products is 1000mg. They sell 750mg capsules OTC in pharmacies, a lot more than the 100mg/pill limit in the US. The US limit seems a bit weird, since a good size Haas avocado will have about 1000mg in it, so clearly the dose limitation is intended for pills/capsules, and not overall dietary intake in real food.   RDA estimated to 3.3-3.5g for adult males, but then again my friendly government also recommend eating whole grain and avoiding saturated fat to prevent CVD, 10 IU/day of D3 in the dark winter etc., so they are clearly not infallible.    In Scandinavia it seems sodium and to lesser extent magnesium are touted as potentially useful supplements in a keto/paleo diet, but here on Reddit and other US-based resources, potassium is almost always included as recommended supplement. No idea why the difference. I've tried supplementing with potassium, and I casually mentioned my planned experiment (eat some and see I can feel a difference) to the pharmacist when buying, and I was rewarded with a look of disbelief and disapproval. I have noticed absolutely zero difference adding 750mg regularly, but I have never estimated my overall intake to see if I undershoot the RDA in a meaningful way. I can however notice a difference with sodium, when deficient adding sodium has an immediate effect easing the symptoms for me. Potassium appears to become a focus point in a medical/health context only with an underlying (serious) condition, and not something necessary to tinker with for a lay-person.

ketoscience,380tqv,Naonin,9,Mon Jun 1 00:46:10 2015 UTC,"Glucagon upregulates GNG  It has a tendency to go up when insulin goes down, though; and vice-versa.  Diabetes has a bit to say about these mechanisms.  I like a discussion that came up regarding this some time ago... I can no longer remember where, or how... But you can refer to doctor Bernstein.    T1 diabetics have a blood sugar spike in response to consumption of just about anything, and they do this because the stomach has alpha cells that produce glucagon in response to food, and they get no compensatory spike in beta cell insulin production like normal people do (remember when I said ""has a tendency to,"" well, that has to do with the way the pancreas works, not so much exactly how the hormones work generally). This lack of insulin production and the generally out-of-control high glucagon are how T1 diabetics develop ketoacidosis and why ketoacidosis is occurs in the presence of high ketones and high blood glucose. And this is driven by the high glucagon and non-existent insulin, causing the body to preferentially avoid glycolysis and produce no (well, probably just very little) oxaloacetate.  Now, normal people have this usual glucagon release, too, but it is followed by insulin release. T1 diabetes informs us that glucagon certainly isn't stopping ketogenesis, and seems to be the cause of the out-of-control ketosis; it stands to reason that insulin, as the counterpart, is doing something to counteract that. It doesn't have to be direct.  Among other things insulin tends to do is shift the respiratory quotient away from fat oxidation and towards glucose oxidation. Even in ketosis, there's generally a sufficient supply of glucose; so a lack of it isn't what's causing the liver to oxidize fatty acids; some hormonal/enzymatic action is. Since glucagon seems to be responsible for ketosis in some way, and insulin inhibits it in some way, it's likely that we simply have yet to discover the mechanism by which it accomplishes this.  As an aside, I totes agree with you that GNG from protein is a very limited factor - I might disagree in that I believe the hormonal control element (independent, mostly, of substrates) is key, though. However, I am pretty sure that we did not discuss this at length. I have to admit that, except in the context of diabetes, the topic is of minimal interest to me because of the fact that protein intake has an ideal range, and eating within that ideal range isn't going to be enough to inhibit ketosis to any great extent... usually.  Another note worth making: Triglycerides have glycerol molecules that are freed when the fatty acids are cleaved from them.  These glycerol molecules can, and do, easily end up entering glycolysis (or are converted to glucose) and this can produce oxaloacete, even if it is less than that produced by glucose oxidation (like, 1/10th of the number of units of oxaloacetate for comparable calories of triglyceride and glucose).  One final note worth making, again heavily cribbing Dr. Bernstein, is that because of the way the pancreas works, we unfortunately cannot compare the effects of injecting insulin to insulin release from the pancreas (as the actions of alpha cells and beta cells releasing their respective hormones impact each other and the injection of the hormones does not, as the hormones tend to not flow back in high concentrations to the pancreas). It is certainly useful for the generation of hypotheses, but must be thoroughly tested.   As an example of this, Dr. Bernstein argues that a T1 diabetic will get high blood sugar from consuming rocks, because of the action of glucagon, and would have to inject a certain amount of insulin based on that, which is why estimating insulin doses is so hard, and the best approach is to simply try to minimize the required insulin dose. A person whose pancreas functions normally would instead see a slight blip in the levels of these hormones as the pancreas adapts to the presence of one or the other in the bloodstream and rapidly balances the situation.

ketoscience,380tqv,ashsimmonds,5,Mon Jun 1 09:39:00 2015 UTC,eat too much protein and it becomes glucose via GNG.   Not the only path. There is also Glyceroneogenesis which can make fat. It's probably related to some cases of fatenning on low carb diets when ad libitum is put to extremes.  It could be THE main path in cases of excess for those  already keto adapted (low sugar needs).  e.g. when you eat tons of excess protein.
ketoscience,380tqv,ZeroCarb,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:46:42 2015 UTC,"Glycerogenesis also appears to be regulated by oxaloacetate.    Glyceroneogenesis can be regulated at two reaction pathways. First of all, it can be regulated at the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate. Secondly, TCA cycle can affect glyceroneogenesis when the glutamate or substrates in TCA cycle is being used as a precursor. Decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate is catalysed by enzyme PEPC-K.[1] PEPC-K is known as the essential enzyme which regulates glyceroneogenesis. Increasing the amount of PEPC-K or over expressing the gene for PEPC-K will increase the activity of glyceroneogenesis. More oxaloacetate can be decarboxylated to phosphoenolpyruvate when there is more PEPC-K that can catalyse the reaction.    http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyceroneogenesis  Now I'm not sure how much TCA cycle impacts PEPC-K, but I'm glad you bring it up because it is another piece in the puzzle. Especially considering that protein can also provide oxaloacetate.   However, glycerogenesis still does not fulfill the role of creating energy for the brain. The glycerol would still have to be converted to glucose, which does happen a lot when triglycerides are broken down, especially under fasting conditions. However, ketosis isn't fasting because protein flux is positive.   I'm not sure how this would play in to protein kicking someone out of ketosis. It still doesn't seem likely to me, but I could be missing something. (I'm only doubtful because of the question ""where is the brain getting its energy?"")"

ketoscience,380tqv,simsalabimbam,3,Wed Jun 3 23:27:59 2015 UTC,"On a glucose based diet, Acetyl-CoA enters the liver and combines with Oxaloacetate for fat metabolism. If you also wiki Malonyl-CoA, gluconeogenesis and regulation of ketogenesis you'll understand put together that glucose/glycogen provide oxaloacetate. No glucose > no oxaloacetate > what happens to Acetyl-CoA?   That is not a great way to present an argument. ""Look it up and you will draw the same conclusion as me.""   glucose/glycogen provide oxaloacetate   Glycolysis leads to oxaloacetate, but this is hardly important for ketogenic dieters. Glycolysis is no longer a major respiration pathway vs beta-oxidation.   I actually draw a very different conclusion based on the same point of agreement: oxaloacetate concentration is increased via gluconeogenesis from glucogenic amino acids, any increase in oxaloacetate inihibits ketogenesis:  https://www.rpi.edu/dept/bcbp/molbiochem/MBWeb/mb1/part2/images/gluconeo.gif  Glucogenic amino acids are transaminated to pyruvate. From there they are converted oxaloacetate, which allows Acetyl-CoA to enter the krebs cycle. Ketogenic amino acids (branched chain amino acids) are converted to Acetoacetate, or first to Acetyl-CoA. This is lyles 58% thing. This is only relevant during starvation, when near 100% of GNG is coming from amino acids. In weight loss, significant amount of glucose comes from non-AA precursors: glycogen / glycerol / lactate / fatty acids. Until that point, the liver will spare amino acids.  Since GNG can proceed from a variety of precursors, oxaloacetate depletion can be provoked by reducing intake of protein. This will not necessarily lead to muscle wastage, since a deficit in dietary protein will lead to amino acid sparing (such as increased GNG from glycerol, increased ketone producion and therefore decreased glucose uptake by the brain)."
ketoscience,380tqv,callesen58,3,Mon Jun 1 10:16:46 2015 UTC,"You are forgetting one thing: GNG is indeed rate-limited (AND demand-limited), but protein oxidation is substrate limited. If your protein intake outstrips your ability to use oxaloacetate, then you will get knocked out of ketosis."

Plus I don't believe a lot of what people say about what they eat - colour me jaded by crappy food-frequency-questionnaires that litter nutrition ""science"".    As mentioned here and wherever, the gap between ""zero"" carb and ""low"" carb for results is probably as wide as LC and SAD.

Despite its beneficial effect on weight loss [8], KD induces adverse side-effects such as osteoporosis and hyperlipidemia on the long term [9, 10]. Moreover, KD has been reported to promote insulin resistance in humans [11], which may discourage the use of such diet in obese patients [12].

ketoscience,37ou40,purple_sponge,45,Fri May 29 05:55:05 2015 UTC,"Some annotations (to explain things further):   Fat does not cause heart disease.    The researcher who originally came up with the Lipid Hypothesis of Heart Disease did not look at the complete set of data for his theory. He cut out any set that did not agree with his theory. He also did not control for smoking, as smoking was still considered ""in vogue"" at the time - and smoking may have been the largest correlation and causation for heart disease at the time.  tl;dr: the heart disease hypothesis was based on cherry picked bad data that didn't control for things like smoking.   Fat does not cause you to become fat.   Blood sugar increases through eating carbs causes a spike in insulin. Insulin has two jobs, in layperson terms: bringing down blood sugar by forcing glucose into your muscles/soft tissues, and signalling the storage of fat into your adipose tissues (your fat cells). If you eat tons carbs, you are telling your body to store any additional carbs (converted into fat) into your fat cells, and if you eat more and more carbs over time, eventually your pancreas runs out of steam and stops being able to produce insulin - hence, type 2 diabetes.   You have high cholesterol and diabetes (if type 2) because of eating carbs/sugar.   Cholesterol isn't even a bad thing, either. The cause and effect has been confused. The reason why cholesterol-based plaques form in your heart is because of inflammation, not because of cholesterol itself - cholesterol is there trying to repair the damage high blood sugar (which causes inflammation) has done to your heart, and is trying to dog-pile the inflammation into submission. Unfortunately, cholesterol isn't terribly smart, and will keep doing it even if it's harmful. The human body was never built for eating 250g of carbs a day, so it effectively turns cholesterol into a poison.  Theoretically, you can have a sky-high cholesterol, but in the absence of carbs or inflammation, nothing bad will happen. Higher cholesterol is also correlated with increased longevity in women, specifically, while it's relatively neutral in men.   You have been lied to.   Yep. It was a junk theory based on junk science by a junk scientist trying to make a name for himself. Tobacco companies didn't want their product to go down in flames, so they blamed fat for heart disease instead, and shoved a lot of money into it. 50 years later, Big Tobacco is effectively dead compared to what it once was, but their ""investment"" remains solid to this day, and you have two generations of people brought up on the idea that fat is the devil.

He also says that nutrition is a matter of ""personal responsibility"" and that people should simply educate themselves, but then goes on to admit that almost all the info out there is bullshit and that you shouldn't be prejudiced against fat people because they're just doing what most doctors tell them to do. I'm honestly on board with parts of both messages - it's a matter of personal responsibility, but authorities need to give people real direction that doesn't sabotage their lives - but he just presents it so conflictingly that it's difficult to know where he stands.

ketoscience,37ou40,alsoram,8,Fri May 29 12:42:04 2015 UTC,"Your body is going to use several thousand kCal/day - your body needs to get that energy from somewhere and AFAIK there are really only 5 sources; fat, protein, glucose (and things that easily convert into glucose like starch), alcohol and fructose.  Just about all of those become toxic in large doses except glucose and fat.  Arguably for people on the insulin resistance spectrum even glucose isn't a safe fuel source.    Obviously if you are limiting carbohydrates then it follows that the safest diet has to be one mostly fueling from fat (and taking just enough protein in to not have to catabolise your muscles to maintain your body).  It turns out that fat is a very stable way to store energy, which is probably why it is the form that our bodies use for long term storage of energy surplus to immediate requirements.  The fear we have of fat was an hypothesis that eating fat was causing us to get heart disease.  Turns out that was never supported by evidence.    If you eat both carbs and fats then the carbs are used first and the fat stored and as long as you keep getting carbs the fat isn't used and just keeps accumulating.  If you can manage to eat only as many calories as you burn, you can eat a diet with a moderate amount of both fat and carbs.  Most people can't - which is why it is easiest to manage your energy input by eating either mostly carbs and almost no fats, or mostly fats and almost no carbs.  Yes saturated fat (butter) in the diet will raise total cholesterol - turns out that isn't a good predictor of anything."
ketoscience,37ou40,Iamahugemess,2,Fri May 29 21:07:17 2015 UTC,How do you go about consuming so much fat without over consuming protein?  Do you as the poster stated just put a stick of butter on your plate and eat is as a meal?
ketoscience,37ou40,alsoram,1 point,Fri May 29 08:21:37 2015 UTC,"While you are losing weight, some of the fats you burn are the ones you stored years ago in your love handles.  But sure at some point you need to add more fat on your plate.  Most butchers trim meat of fat before they sell it - I ask mine not to do that, just slice it off the carcass and bring it to me mooing and dressed with all it's fat.  I also buy Lard, Dripping, Suet or render my own from offcuts I explicitly purchase from my Butcher.  Vegetables sauteed in Lard are delicious.  I add coconut oil to food, for example I blend a tablespoon of coconut oil with some stock and boiling water to make a fatty broth smoothie.  Mayonnaise is easy to make, delicious, and almost entirely oil.  Pork Crackling is so easy to make and supermarkets here almost give away pig belly skin because I guess every other customer is terrified of fat - fine by me."

ketoscience,37ou40,isamura,2,Thu Jun 11 12:47:24 2015 UTC,"WHat do you do for lunch?  Breakfast for me is always the same. Two boiled eggs and a shake made out of psyllium, flaxseed, oatbran, cinnamon, and cocoa mixed with heavy cream, and unsweetened almond milk. According to my calculations that shake has one maybe two grams of carbs given the quantities I use.  Lunch is always a salad, either a ceaser salad with ham, cheese and eggs,  a chicken and avo salad, or a lamb salad. Everything except the lamb salad has very small amounts of meat in them.  Dinner varies and that's where I tend to eat a lot of protein. Sometimes a small steak, sometimes ground beef or something. I also always have a ""shake"" made with chard, kale, cucumber, vinegar, olive oil, salt, and a small tomato.  I add a bit of water to all that and hit it in the mixer.  Drink the whole thing including all the fiber.  That's it really. An extremely limited diet. Oh and I have coffee, green tea, red tea, and occasionally a diet coke through the day."

HDL appears to be protective against, and pattern-b LDL appears to be contributory toward atherosclerosis.  We are only regularly measuring HDL - and as we don't have a statin like therapy that can raise it, so it's off the radar of most pathologists.  About the only thing we do know that will raise HDL is dietary Saturated Fat - and we've only just decided a few months ago that Saturated Fat isn't a cause of Heart disease.  I expect it may take a while to see the consensus support for a high Saturated Fat diet for 'Cholesterol'."

Saturated fat does raise lipids in the blood, particularly LDL cholesterol levels. Now what a lot of doctors now believe is that it is not the total cholesterol, but the ratio betweel LDL and HDL which is important in recognizing heart disease. My point stands, the majority of the medical community is skepitcal of a high diet of saturated fat, as well they should be, because a scientists job is be skeptical of claims that go against a consensus. I would love being proven wrong, as I personally want saturated fats to be the next ""heart healthy"" foods people turn to."

I was referring to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' May  comment in response to the DGAC that went further and suggested;   While the body of research linking saturated fat intake to the modulation of LDL and other circulating lipoprotein concentrations is significant, this evidence is essentially irrelevant to the question of the relationship between diet and risk for cardiovascular disease.   Also Zoe Harcombes study from earlier this year that we just don't have any evidence to associate Saturated fats with Heart disease.  eg: Evidence from randomised controlled trials did not support the introduction of dietary fat guidelines in 1977 and 1983: a systematic review and meta-analysis   I take your point though, that if you were to poll the medical community, a plurality would support the view that saturated fat causes high cholesterol which causes heart disease.  It will take time to change the momentum of a generation trained to believe that the diet heart hypothesis was well supported by evidence."

Since insulin levels are low on a ketogenic diet, storing excess dietary fat isn't really an option. As such, your body needs to burn it. This is done through thermogenesis and other futile sources. It doesn't have to saturated fat, any fat will do.  MCT fats are more efficient at promoting thermogenesis since their metabolism isn't rate limited by the carnitine shuffle, while long-chain fatty acids are."
ketoscience,379rli,callesen58,3,Tue May 26 08:44:05 2015 UTC,storing excess dietary fat isn't really an option.    That's absolutely wrong. Plenty of us have seen extra fat being stored with ad libitum diets. And I'm including zero carb groups.  Bro-science groups think you'll automagically become fashion-magazine thin because their  leaders are effortlessly thin.  It makes perfect sense you'll store: Even the ancient hunter would store fat to compensate for downtimes.   PS. Also your explanation is wrong in another level. Insulin in ketogenic diets is pretty high for at least a couple of hours after a meal because of protein. That includes amounts of protein that are low to moderate.
ketoscience,379rli,ZeroCarb,0,Tue May 26 18:38:43 2015 UTC,Why? If you haven't already gotten a lipid profile done then I would strongly advice getting one that has LDL-P values as there is a possibility you may be a hyperresponder to the diet and your cholesterol levels will shoot through the roof. LDL-P is a driver for risk to your heart health and in some people skyrockets due to the massive influx of fat. Thermogenic effects of fat lipolysis. What did you replace in your diet?

There is also a bit of a selection bias going on in this sub, with posts that show positive effects in rodent studies eliciting quite a bit of upvotes and discussion, and findings that speak against the keto dogma quickly being dismissed (e.g., on the ground that rodent metabolism is different from primate/human metabolism).  It seems to me that this is a well-written, peer-reviewed study with proper stats and methodology that was not funded by anything that raises a flag for COI.   Can we really dismiss this result so easily?  Mice are not humans, okay. But previous studies with mice were in line with what human ketoers report.  ITT is off when applied on keto, okay. But there are a heck of other marker in that study that are alarming.  Glucose intolerance is a ridiculous term, okay. But what about the pancreatic damage?  The issues that I have with the study is that 1) it seems like caloric intake was not controlled and 2) the previous literature finding opposite effects was not really discussed.  1) You can see the weight of the animals approach that of control after a few weeks. What was their caloric intake at that time? It seems trivial that overeating on keto food will lead to obesity and thus metabolic syndrome in the same way as overeating on any other diet. Any one have thoughts on this?  2) Why did previous mouse studies find improvements (e.g., ref 2)? Again, overeating could be the main difference."

ketoscience,3744ej,bozahrking,3,Tue May 26 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, what I find alarming is that low carb high fat diets are sometimes hailed as ""reversing"" pre-diabetes or even T2 diabetes by restoring insulin sensitivity. However, many, myself included find that fasting blood glucose increases rather than decreases, up to clinically relevant levels (i.e., 100+).   This effect is supposed to be ""physiological"" rather than ""pathological"", and it is supposed to be eliminated by re-uptake of carbs for a few days. However, it does mean that your insulin is elevated for many hours of your night while on the diet. In essence, your pancreas seems to produce the same abnormally high release as in a pre-diabetic individual."
ketoscience,3744ej,alsoram,3,Tue May 26 15:22:44 2015 UTC,"There is evidence that a low caloric diet can reverse Insulin resistance Reversal of type 2 diabetes: normalisation of beta cell function in association with decreased pancreas and liver triacylglycerol, and to the extent that a low carbohydrate diet helps people with pre-diabetes to restrict theiur calories that's not an unreasonable claim.  As I understand it, physiological insulin resistance is just a glucose sparing response by cells that are able to get sufficient energy from fatty acids (or ketones), in favour of those that are glucose dependent.    My own levels, after a year adapted, are reliably 4.9-5.2  mmol/l (88-94 mg/dl) in contrast to 7-11 mmol/l (126-200 mg/dl) on my previous high carb diet.   nb: I still take a low dose of metformin to limit gluconeogenesis - it's possible if I stopped that I might see the same clinically relevant levels."

The ketogenic diet was lacking in protein versus the chow diet.  It was 6% protein by calories or 10% protein by weight.  That's a malnourishment-style protein ratio, if I ever saw one."
ketoscience,3744ej,causalcorrelation,5,Sat Jun 6 16:08:43 2015 UTC,"There are a number of issues present.  The most obvious is that they are mice. Mice are not naturally high fat consumers, and are generally low fat consumers. Results from mice about diet composition will likely not transfer effectively to humans (this is clear from the fact that the control mice eat about 11% of calories as fat. Control humans tend to eat near 30% if not higher).  The control mice ate vastly more protein, roughly 5 times as much as controls, and substantially less than what a human would eat on such a diet.  The distribution of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats is vastly different from those recommended by any reasonably constructed ketogenic diet. Most of those diets are very high in monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids (if not both) and very low in polyunsaturated diets. A likely reason for this is that, unlike humans, mice do not thrive on high saturated fat diets for very long. So here there are two issues: one is that the effect of a ketogenic diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids may well be gloomy for humans, but two is that no human would ever undertake such a distribution of fatty acids."
ketoscience,3744ej,NilacTheGrim,1 point,Tue May 26 06:38:12 2015 UTC,"The most glaring problem in my mind is the paltry, inadequate protein in the ketogenic diet group.  10% protein by weight?

ketoscience,3744ej,NilacTheGrim,2,Mon May 25 17:56:47 2015 UTC,"Except this was comparing a standard chow diet (high carb, moderate protein, low fat) to a very high fat, low protein, almost zero carb diet.    If you look at the control versus KD group, the two diets did not keep protein constant  (nor did they keep the various forms of fat [PUFA/MUFA/SFA] ratios the same, but they were close enough, I suppose).  The KD diet was very high fat, very low protein (about 2x less protein by weight, 4x less protein by caloric ratios!!) than the control diet.  The protein ratio for the KD was about 5.9cal/100kcal, versus 27.2kcal/100kcal (or 10g/100g versus 22.5g/100g for the chow diet).  This is a VERY low protein ketogenic diet!  It's the kind you would give to an epileptic to maximize ketone output at the expense of his health, and not the kind of diet any real human being (or mouse) would eat for optimal health.  Noone eats a diet that low in protein!  What's more, ketogenic dieters need all the protein they can get for gluconeogenesis!  It's possible glucose tolerance went way down due to muscle wasting.  Smaller muscles = more insulin resistance and worse glucose tolerance.  I would be curious on body composition changes (lean mass versus fat mass) for the two groups.  This is omitted from the study.  Weight hadn't changed much, they say, but it's entirely possible that skeletal muscles mass was reduced as the body was forced to catabolize amino acids in the muscle for maintenance and repair of tissues and for gluconeogenesis.  On the other hand, since calories weren't fixed either (or even mentioned in the study!), it's possible the mice were overconsuming the fatty food they were eating to get adequate protein.  In that case you're still running into a situation where you're comparing apples to oranges.  Also, the pancreatic alpha and beta cell mass went down in the KD diet.  This is probably due to less circulating insulin, and less insulin secretion.  On a diet so low in protein that's not surprising!  There's very little need for insulin due to the low amino acid (and/or carb) intake.  Ditto for glucagon (which also is a hormone stimulated by amino acids in the blood).  Because the diets controlled multiple variables at once, this experiment is flawed.  It doesn't really compare the KD and the chow diets fairly.  The KD diet is so lacking in protein it's basically a malnutrition diet.  You can't compare a diet lacking in a basic nutrient to one that is complete in nutrients.  Using an adequate nutrition KD would have been a fairer comparison.  Also, keeping calories constant or even mentioning total caloric intake would have been helpful.  This would explain why these results contradict previous findings. I would say the study is flawed and doesn't really help us understand the effects of a real ketogenic diet a human would eat (one with adequate protein).  As such, it  should be disregarded."

GNG is a sign that insulin is low, itself a sign that serum glucose is low. Whether this is good or bad depends on the circumstances. For most people dieting it is a sign that their carbohydrate intake has been low enough to cause a drop in insulin secretion.  Ethanol is metabolized in the liver before fats or sugars. Whilst ethanol is being metabolized, glucose is not being produced by the liver (http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/275/5/E897.long). If you drink alcohol, then those calories are being used for energy and not body fat. It does not help with weight loss. Drinking alcohol before bed is known to reduce DP (http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/30/12/3011)   Dawn Phenomenon is closely tied to circadian rhythms, including GH and IGF secretion. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863387   Normally, DP is explained by release of glucagon causing glucose to be released via glycogenolysis, and the physiological lack of insulin leads to a rise in serum glucose. It has nothing to do with beta-oxidation of FA or ketogenesis, as far as I know."
ketoscience,3704ug,simsalabimbam,2,Sat May 23 18:18:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding. I am T2D, but I am curious and a recent discussion made me want to understand this. It comes down to the fact that I must have lowest A1c I can have to stop years of systemic high A1c and the damage it probably has already done to me.   I found some of this at this blog  http://high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.com/2008/05/physiological-insulin-resistance-2-dawn.html?m=1  And there are links to studies I have also followed in my research."
ketoscience,3704ug,simsalabimbam,2,Sat May 23 18:28:49 2015 UTC,"So whatever Peter writes is definitely better than what I write! Thanks for the link!  The idea is this:  Circadian rhythm -> production of GH each early morning -> release of glucose from glycogen AND increased levels of circulating FFA via increased lipolysis.   Both lipolysis and glycogenolysis are stimulated by GH - as you would expect, GH makes fuel available for growth.  About that A1c, a ketogenic diet (along with fasting) is the best non-pharmacological way to lower A1c values. This is because, without carbs in the diet, there is much less glucose in your blood stream. In fact, the only glucose in there has been manufactured via GNG - mainly by the liver but some also by the kidneys and intestines.  DP leads to a slight rise in serum glucose, as you described in yourself. This is very much less than the values seen in people with uncontrolled diabetes, their values are often above 300. Sometimes far above. I think it is a relatively minor thing for non-insulin dependent diabetics, restoration of insulin sensitivity will solve the DP issue."

ketoscience,3704ug,DownhillYardSale,1 point,Sat May 23 20:53:03 2015 UTC,"So, could my exercise be leading me to higher GH = high FBG & lipolysis?   Exercise is ketogenic. It increases catecholamines that are responsible for lipolysis and thus increased fat burning not to mention the reduction in insulin levels that causes more fat burning as well.  Lyle McDonald, The Ketogenic Diet, pp 24-25   Growth hormone (GH) is another peptide hormone which has numerous effects on the body, both on tissue growth as well as fuel mobilization. GH is released in response to a variety of stressors the most important of which for our purposes are exercise, a decrease in blood glucose, and carbohydrate restriction or fasting. As its name suggests, GH is a growth promoting hormone, increasing protein synthesis in the muscle and liver. GH also tends to mobilize FFA from fat cells for energy.  ...  Adrenaline and noradrenaline (also called epinephrine and norepinephrine) are frequently referred to as ‘fight or flight’ hormones. They are generally released in response to stress such as exercise, cold, or fasting. Epinephrine is released primarily from the adrenal medulla, traveling in the bloodstream to exert its effects on most tissues in the body. Norepinephrine is released primarily from the nerve terminals, exerting its effects only on specific tissues of the body.  The interactions of the catecholamines on the various tissues of the body are quite complex and beyond the scope of this book. The primary role that the catecholamines have in terms of the ketogenic diet is to stimulate free fatty acid release from fat cells.  When insulin levels are low, epinephrine and norepinephrine are both involved in fat mobilization. In humans, only insulin and the catecholamines have any real effect on fat mobilization with insulin inhibiting fat breakdown and the catecholamines stimulating fat breakdown."

I think probably more evidence is needed to conclude either way.  My personal belief is that it is in fact the best, healthiest metabolic state and the best examples of our ancestors were probably in it more often -- the ones that actually were successful hunterers and fishermen and whatnot, probably were spending a lot of their time year-round in ketosis.

Asians had a similar situation with a different pre-sapien species. Since they invented agriculture they also are predisposed genetically and with microbial gut bacteria for slow carbs. This is why they can eat white rice three times a day and not gain, while a western european would. The basic diet of the original homo sapien sapiens in africa ate a diet consisting mainly of 33% carbs, 33% protein, and 33% fat.

Stone tool use is what allowed us to become human. The stone tools allowed for better hunting, easier butchering and meat consumption while also importantly giving access to bone marrow and skulls. Due to being able to cut the hide away, and cut off bite sized morsels, there was no need for carnivorous jaw structure and the intense full body pulling to tear away the meat. It took less calories to get more calories. With more available, and easily digestible calories we had a surplus, allowing for a larger brain to develop which requires maintaining those calorie needs. Our intestines even got shorter drink this time due to no longer needing to be hind gut fermenters of large amounts of vegetation. Human bone records show that humans had a diet more close to wolves than apes. It wasn't until the late paleolithic in some very regional areas, that there started to be groups of humans eating more carbs, such as acorns in one region of France. Acorns are a high carb nut. Those cave dwellers had horrible teeth issues and other diseases beginning that weren't found among others. This is what led me to keto, reading anthoarcheology while wanting to be healthy."

If fruits/veggies were available elsewhere and consumed it would be more likely to not be in ketosis.

Tissue tears, inflammation increases, cortisol, etc. However, the body's response is to improve and adapt beyond the stimulation. Every adaptation in biology is in response to stimulation. If the stimulation is more than the creature can adapt to, it either gets sick, injured, or dies. Exercise is no exception. Can you only squat 200 lbs? Then more will hurt you. More is not always better in terms of stimulation.   Exercise is largely about signaling. I really like the ""map"" that suppversity has here. As you can see, exercise may be the one thing connecting everything else, but most of what goes on is not about ""more exercise"". A lot of those pathways are highly limited by biology (MAPK, mTOR, IGF, all extremely limited by other chemicals/hormones). So more exercise would only induce more damage beyond what the hormones can adapt to.  Since a lot of it comes back to hormones, there is a lot a person can do besides diet and exercise to increase the benefit gained from a 45 min. lifting session. Increase sleep quality, cold/heat exposure that induces stress and therefore causes the body to respond to each therapy with hormones, light/dark therapy.

ketoscience,36do5l,simsalabimbam,3,Mon May 18 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"To add something very relevant to ketogenic diets, glycerol is also an important input to gluconeogenesis. Since it can not form the basis for glucose by itself, it requires the presence of certain amino acids (from protein food). A pet theory I have is that this is one of the most important reasons people require a certain amount of (endogenous) protein when fasting, since while protein can be used for repairs and general (re)building, it is also required for creating new sugar via gluconeogenesis, and sugar is always required in certain amounts to be around.  PS. Some people around these parts believe that fasting will not use any protein at all until all fat is gone. I don't see how that would make any sense. There is no way for their fat to make glucose on its own and glucose is required for them to survive, in limited amounts by some tissues, unless they use protein from fat cells, but I seriously doubt it's that.  edit: OH IT WAS YOU THAT BELIEVED THAT.  So are you conveniently omitting information now?"
ketoscience,36do5l,ZeroCarb,2,Mon May 18 19:32:43 2015 UTC,Pet theory?  Isn't that simple gluconeogenesis from gluconeogenic amino acids?

We had a similar discussion and he believed fat must be burned in total, before protein can be used in fasting. I wonder if he omitted gluconeogenesis on purpose to satisfy his biased point of view.  Fat giving glucose by itself doesn't seem to be a thing. Does he believe dihydroxyacetone phosphate is enough on its own?  Dihydroxyacetone phosphate appears to be inadequate on its own."

In the cytosol gluconeogenesis proceeds from glycerol or malate. Also: lactate is shuttled from the muscle to the liver, is used in GNG to produce glucose which is then returned to the muscle via the blood stream - this is the Cori cycle. It is worth noting that GNG also occurs in the small intestine and in the kidneys.  TBH I am not sure if dietary fat provides the glycerol used in hepatic GNG. I think it is more likely that endogenous triglycerides released from adipocytes during lipolysis provides the glycerol."

If you don't mind me asking, is ketoscience just a hobby of yours or a part of your profession or some kind of combo of the two?  So I supplement citrulline malate in my pre workout, would the malate promote gluconeogenesis?   So dietary glycerol mostly gets used for energy via glycolysis?"
ketoscience,36do5l,DownhillYardSale,2,Tue May 19 14:00:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think supplementing malate would necessarily promote gluconeogenesis, since this pathway is tightly controlled via insulin.  What might happen is improved rates of oxidative phosphorylation during aerobic respiration. More malate might mean a higher rate of phsophorylation in the malate shuttle (whereby malate functions as an electron shuttle across the mitochondrial matrix). But that is just hypothetical."

ketoscience,36do5l,simsalabimbam,1 point,Tue May 19 17:12:12 2015 UTC,conserved   I'm not a nutritionist. Does conservation have an exact meaning in this context?
ketoscience,36do5l,ZeroCarb,4,Mon May 18 23:23:02 2015 UTC,"Yes.  During extended fasting, many things happen to prevent muscle wastage and thereby conserve muscle mass. One of them is a decreased need for glucose - as we all know - since glucose is largely replaced by ketones as an energy substrate for the brain. See: http://www.med.upenn.edu/timm/documents/ReviewArticleTIMM2008-9Lazar-1.pdf    Another thing that happens is that epinephrine levels rise and lipolysis rates are increased. Thus more glycerol becomes available for GNG as body adipose stores are rapidly depleted. See: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC424023/  And another thing which happens during fasting is increased production of human growth hormone. (see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1548337). (In rats, further increase in GH is shown to be stimulated by butyrate and BOHB (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310566) which may or may not also happen in humans). Growth hormone is important in this context because it directly stimulates muscle tissue to the catabolic anabolic state, preventing wastage:   The findings in this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the decrease in lean body mass, the increase in adipose-tissue mass, and the thinning of the skin that occur in older men are caused in part by reduced activity of the growth hormone—IGF-I axis, and can be restored in part by the administration of human growth hormone. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2355952   .   These results demonstrate that GH-possibly by maintenance of circulating concentrations of free IGF-I--is a decisive component of protein conservation during fasting and provide evidence that the underlying mechanism involves a decrease in muscle protein breakdown. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11147801   .   When well nourished the GH-induced stimulation of IGF-I and insulin is important for tissue anabolism whereas during fasting and other catabolic states GH predominantly stimulates the release and oxidation of FFA which leads to decreased glucose and protein oxidation and preservation of LBM. The most prominent metabolic effect of GH is a marked increase in lipolysis and FFA levels. In the periprandial and postabsorptive states the effects of GH on protein metabolism are modest and include increased protein synthesis and decreased breakdown at the whole body level and in muscle together with decreased amino acid degradation/oxidation and decreased hepatic urea formation. During fasting and stress the effects of GH on protein metabolism become more pronounced... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19773097   GH itself stimulates lipolysis:     This supports the notion that stimulation of lipolysis is a primary and important effect of GH. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19820031   N.B. There is plenty of controversy surrounding supplementing human growth hormone, some claim it stimulates all kinds of things such as diabetes and cancer. These negative effectives of exogenous GH supplementation do not extend to endogenous GH production seen during fasting."

I'd say cut them both out completely, honestly.  I'm on keto for the second time (long story), but my first stretch was a year and a half long before I discovered that I was born with one kidney. My kidney function was great, and my nephrologist was concerned that there were ketones in my urine, but I told him why I'm eating so low-carb (PCOS), and he said, ""If it's working, stick to it.""   One thing that's tough on your kidneys is losing weight very fast. That's regardless of WHAT diet you're doing.  110g of protein doesn't seem TOO too high to me -- my nephrologist told me not to go over 80g when I was 140 lbs (also I'm a chick) -- but protein is really what you want to watch out for when you're talking about your kidneys. And water. For the love of all that is holy, guzzle that water. You also have to make sure you're not overdoing the sodium, so it might be a good idea to supplement more with other electrolytes.

This urologist is obviously on a tirade against keto. Do not drink that wine. He's right that if you have certain kidney diseases you might have to monitor protein intake carefully, but your big problem will be potassium. I cannot stress this enough, potassium will become your main focus if you indeed have kidney disease. Too much and you die, too little and you die. I'm sorry to be blunt about it, and I hope you don't end up with chronic kidney disease, but that one is important and it doesn't seem like your urologist is at all concerned about it from his reccomendations. At very least it seems he did tests to rule out a kidney stone, which is the only reason I'm not going to start throwing around the ""M"" word.  Okay, lighter tone now. You can live a perfectly normal life with just a quarter function of one kidney. You are a long way from anything like dialysis or surgery, and they have also come a long way with both in recent years. You do need to get this figured out as fast as you can because the earlier you treat this the better your outcome is, especially if it ends up being auto immune in any way.   My guess is you originally suspected rhabdo when you googled, and if that was the case the ER should have given you IV fluids and after rehydration you would have likely recovered. It's possible you sustained mild damage to your kidneys even if they did push fluids, so it could all be that. If they didn't I'm hoping they had their reasons.  A very common kidney disease you might want to look up is called IgA nephritis. You should hopefully have also gotten checked for anemia, if not I would ask about that. I would also ask about getting an ANA and if that's positive I'd ask to get more specific antibodies done, especially if you have a speckled or homogeneous pattern (I'll save you the googling, lupus can implicate the kidneys and so can some other forms of auto immune).  In these cases I mentioned your keto diet is not to blame (rhabdo is usually induced either by vigorous exercise or buildings falling on you, IgA nephritis is a slowly progressing chronic kidney disease you could have had for twenty years before it became apparent, lupus is the kind of thing that lurks behind the scenes then flares up occasionally then hides again).   All that being said, and as much as I dislike your urologist from your description, I do think you should probably pause the keto diet until this is figured out. At very least you don't need to be fighting medical professionals thirty year old opinions while you try to get this figured out.  You also don't know what's happening with your kidneys and there are some kidney diseases that require lower protein intake. On the other hand, if it ends up being auto immune the keto diet might help. The point is you don't know right now, you don't want to distract your doctors, and you need to take a least harm approach in the interim.   Good luck, and I'm hoping for the best result for you. Push the doctors and stick to it until you have a diagnosis, then come back and tell us about it if you feel up to it."

I have steadily increased my carbs just to do some science and I am able to eat 80g carbs daily and still maintain high levels of ketones in my urine. I am pretty sure breastfeeding directly correlates to increased carb permissions.   To your original question: I'm sure that breastfeeding would allow you higher permissions of carb intake if you wanted, the real question should be, is there a requirement for them. The answer to that is unequivocally ""no""."

Carbohydrates require a chemical process of converting Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen (or you could also say... CO2 and Water) into sugars. That's something that plants do. If animal life could create Carbohydrates themselves, we would be photosynthesizing.  Our bodies can convert some sugars into different sugars, and store it, but as far as I know, we can't create carbs out of nothing.  Feel free to provide some citations to prove me wrong though. I'm not an expert in this.  Edit: I was wrong. I didn't understand what Gluconeogenesis did."

If this weren't true, all the people on a zero carb diet would be dead.  It's not about thinking if it's possible, it's possible :) The body does it all the time. You don't create carbs out of nothing, you create them from other molecules.   Google - gluconeogenesis, you can in fact convert other molecules to glucose   Biochemistry textbook is the best source on this matter"
ketoscience,364em4,anbeav,2,Sat May 16 16:31:51 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected.  For what it's worth, here's the process the body goes through to make its own glucose from proteins:   Gluconeogenesis begins in the mitochondria with the formation of oxaloacetate by the carboxylation of pyruvate. This reaction also requires one molecule of ATP, and is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase. This enzyme is stimulated by high levels of acetyl-CoA (produced in β-oxidation in the liver) and inhibited by high levels of ADP and glucose.  Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate using NADH, a step required for its transportation out of the mitochondria.  Malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate using NAD+ in the cytosol, where the remaining steps of gluconeogenesis take place.  Oxaloacetate is decarboxylated and then phosphorylated to form phosphoenolpyruvate using the enzyme PEPCK. A molecule of GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP during this reaction.  The next steps in the reaction are the same as reversed glycolysis. However, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase converts fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate, using one water molecule and releasing one phosphate (in glycolysis phosphofructokinase 1 converts F6P to F1,6BP). This is also the rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis.  Glucose-6-phosphate is formed from fructose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucoisomerase (the reverse of step 2 in glycolysis). Glucose-6-phosphate can be used in other metabolic pathways or dephosphorylated to free glucose. Whereas free glucose can easily diffuse in and out of the cell, the phosphorylated form (glucose-6-phosphate) is locked in the cell, a mechanism by which intracellular glucose levels are controlled by cells.  The final reaction of gluconeogenesis, the formation of glucose, occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where glucose-6-phosphate is hydrolyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase to produce glucose and release an inorganic phosphate. Like two steps prior, this step is not a simple reversal of glycolysis, in which hexokinase catalyzes the conversion of glucose and ATP into G6P and ADP. Glucose is shuttled into the cytoplasm by glucose transporters located in the endoplasmic reticulum's membrane.   In humans it is a process that only happens when we're starving, or consuming extremely low, or no carbohydrates. There is apparently some debate about if the body is able to actually increase glucose levels this way, or if it's just a way to maintain glucose levels.   Very cool. I always thought Carbohydrate creation was something limited to plant-life."
ketoscience,364em4,ZeroCarb,3,Sat May 16 16:39:49 2015 UTC,It's just a way to maintain glucose needed for the brain and other tissues that require it like red blood cells.  It's a costly process that is both supply and demand driven.
ketoscience,364em4,callesen58,3,Sat May 16 16:40:59 2015 UTC,"In humans it is a process that only happens when we're starving, or consuming extremely low, or no carbohydrates.    Most people around these parts consume no carbohydrates of merit. Even if you get some, even minor exercise can easily deplete glycogen. In general glyconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis should be very common occurences to ketoers.  Those two pathways should also be taken into account by those that erroneously think overeating in keto can't get you fatter. It can. It can either make sugar (gluconeogenesis) or fat (glyceroneogenesis) if you overeat protein and fat.  PS. Ketogenic diets were very common in nature. Way more common than sugar eating. So those aren't special metabolisms reserved for starving and diet experiments."
ketoscience,364em4,ZeroCarb,4,Sun May 17 00:11:21 2015 UTC,"I read that breastmilk contains 7g/100mL of carbohydrates.    In the form of lactose. A disaccharide composed of glucose and galactose and which is manufactured by the mammary glands from glucose. Glucose is, as you probably know, created in gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidneys out of protein.   Can I add the amount of carbs I am losing in breastmilk to my daily permitted carb intake?   You shouldn't add carbs to replace it. You may need to up your protein intake, however. If you start ""craving"" carbs that is a sign of protein depletion.  I honestly don't know about the protein requirements for breastfeeding on keto, but excess protein is less of an issue than inadequate protein! Try going for the upper range of suggested protein intake, ie:   0.69 to 1.2 grams per pound lean body mass. (1.5 to 2.64 grams per kg lean body mass.)   From the r/keto FAQ.   Also, am I starving my baby of important sugars by going keto while breastfeeding?   ONLY if you are eating inadequate protein. Your body creates all the sugar your baby needs out of the protein you consume.  Note that your baby does NOT only use the sugars for energy metabolism (Mostly used by red blood cells and such), instead the primary energy source is the fat in the milk. In fact most of the glucose demand comes down to protein formation, since many proteins require the attachment of a sugar (Usually glucose). Babies grow rapidly, and such have high demand for glucose for all the proteins, cells and shit they are creating. Likewise for the galactose partition of lactose, galactose is also used to support the high growth rate of the baby."

ketoscience,364em4,QPDolly2,1 point,Sat May 30 09:12:50 2015 UTC,"Well, as anything in the body, it's always good, until it's either overdone or done too little. Protein intake is vital to be enough but it seems to be taxing if it's too much because it's metabolized in a more complex manner, before entering the subject of gluconeogenesis or glyceroneogenesis. Hence to get enough and good quality energy, I'd mix fat and protein with protein being up to 2 X the current needs, because it's also vital to always be enough, especially when growing or repairing, but not too much higher to avoid adding a burden to the body to metabolize it (fat metabolism is much simpler).  In general without sugar/carbs around, moderate protein in combination with fat is enough.  The body can use parts of fat (glycerol) with some of the protein for sugar.  PS. Without being an expert I would assume the best strategy is to do something very simple. Eat ad libitum protein and fat of good sources (fresh animal parts, olive oil, butter, etc.). While it's not the best strategy before a fashion magazine modelling job, it should be very healthy in most cases provided it's not forced in a lopsided manner (e.g. being afraid to eat fat or eating only processed meat or overeating without even being hungry)."

ketoscience,362tj5,ctsorensen,2,Fri May 15 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"Glycogen depletion isn't necessarily dependent on diet. Glycogen depletion happens when your body uses up all of the glycogen stored in muscles and the liver. So you can eat straight carbs for a month, then go on a three hour run on an empty stomach, then 'bonk'. The point at which you 'bonk' is a point of glycogen depletion because you've used up your carbohydrate stores in exercise. Glycogen depletion tends to happen on a ketogenic diet because you're simply not consuming the carbohydrates to refill your glycogen stores."

ketoscience,362tj5,Clob,1 point,Fri May 15 18:15:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure, but I think the food immediately ingested after a bonk would be converted to glucose as quickly as possible. The priority (as far as I'm aware) is blood sugar, then glycogen stores, then muscle repair, then fat storage. My understanding is that the body will always find a way to fill the glycogen stores. So if you only eat  100% fat after a bonk, then the body will convert that to glucose and glycogen as quickly as possible. Even if you eat a keto diet, your body will still fill its glycogen stores, just through conversion of fat/protein. Pretty sure that's how it works, someone correct me if I'm wrong."

ketoscience,362tj5,dalesd,3,Fri May 15 17:19:02 2015 UTC,"Going hypocaloric has similarities with ketogenic diets. After all, total fasting which is the ultimate hypocaloric thing, is by definition a ketogenic state. But, there are big differences, for example if you eat almost all your calories from carbs and they are only slightly lower than maintenance, you may lose protein while even gain fat, as an extreme example of the effort going bad.   Glycogen specifically, is probably related to the hormones that make it build up. Plain old insulin is pushing sugar to glycogen stores (it's not hard, glycogen IS a sugar), and plain old glucagon takes it out if blood sugar goes low. I suppose hypocaloric high-carb diets do give more glycogen.  But in general I would not equate high-carb hypocaloric diets to the benefits of low carb. This is especially true for people that has been established they are very high carb intolerant (as it's most of us around these parts). Besides, ketogenic bodies, do not use glycogen as much."

Especially after the first 2-3 weeks, everything slows down way too much.  EDIT: Ah, nevermind, it seems that you think Jason Fung said that so it must be correct. I don't know that work of his, but if he said that, he has to seriously explain where all that protein lost shown in all those studies came from.

Sorbitol is distinctly anti-ketogenic, as per this study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1197501/pdf/biochemj00915-0015.pdf). Both sorbitol and mannitol convert to fructose, but sorbitol is converted extremely fast. Sorbitol conversion uses NAD+ while mannitol uses NADP+. The body has a much larger supply of the former than the latter.  If you want to sweeten with sugar alcohols, stick to xylitol or use erythritol instead. The only sugar alcohols that are not metabolized in the human body are erythritol and arabitol (But isn't available on the market currently afaik, might be in the future). Everything else counts as a carb. Xylitol is okay because it has to be metabolized in the pentose phosphate pathway, and the pentose phosphate pathway runs rather slowly, so it doesn't interfere with ketosis as much, yet each gram of xylitol still counts as 60% glucose."

Ascorbic acid in most animals is apparently created during carbohydrate metabolism.  The reason we need vitamin C is because we are one of the few mammals that lack the enzyme for the last step.   In 1975, Mann proposed that, because of their structural similarity, ascorbic acid and glucose might utilize the same membrane transport.  This extremely important concept was eventually confirmed experimentally and ultimately led to an understanding of how glucose and ascorbic acid compete for transport by insulin and entry into cells. Ascorbic Acid and the Immune System   It also explains why when Vilhjalmur Stefansson did his metabolic ward experiment eating a diet of only meat for a year, he didn't get scurvy as the nutritionists had predicted.  Glucose and Ascorbic acid compete for transport, so when you eat mostly carbs you need a lot more vitamin C.  Those of us who in nutritional ketosis need much less, vitamin C."
ketoscience,35tpqp,alsoram,4,Wed May 13 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"Ascorbic acid in most animals is apparently created during carbohydrate metabolism.    I wouldn't say so. Ascorbic acid is packed together with glucose naturally, it's not created, that's an evolutionary artefact and characteristic of endemic foods in hot climates. Human metabolism revolves around that artefact. Ascorbic acid is an antioxidant that lowers cytosolic pH and thus reduces the proton leak respectively ROS created by NADPH+ in mitochondria as result of glucose oxidation. This explains why some antioxidants appear harmful or with no effect in lipid oxidation as fatty acid oxidation already marks a reduction in the potential because of the ROS output that accompany the process. What matters in the case is what is the epigenetic determinant and the physiological factors that regulate the switch between glucose and lipid  oxidation but that's a different story.So you are right about that nutritional ketosis does not require antioxidants as there are already evolutionary-evolved mitochondrial defenses in action. The take home conclusion is that ROS created in the process of the two main metabolic paths (glucose and fatty acid) of oxidation utilize differential mitochondrial protective mechanisms and are also created in different stages of the ETC i.e. to correct Gary Taubes and set the record straight there're ""good"" and ""bad"" ROS though they are not immanently so and what matters is the dynamics in metabolism.

Also if Ascorbic acid hitches a hike on GLUT-1(which is a transporter for non-insulin mediated glucose entry) to pass the BBB it definitely implies that one of the routes for glucose entry is already taken, GLUT-1 receptors are not public transportation, you know, they take one passenger at a time."

ketoscience,35tpqp,Soldier99,3,Wed May 13 16:49:31 2015 UTC,To put it simply from how I understand it. If the transport mechanism is being used up to transport glucose into the brain it won't be able to pick up and do the same with Ascorbic Acid. As such you would need a significantly larger amount in order to hope that some transporters pick it up. Similarly in other tissues Vitamin C and glucose use the same pathways.
ketoscience,35tpqp,rickamore,5,Wed May 13 17:16:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, the glucose ""hogs"" the transporter and decreases the ability for ascorbic acid to pass through. As an example, picture an aerial view of a stadium. There are a ton of hometown fans in their red jerseys trying to get through a gate and very few visiting fans in their yellow jerseys trying to get through the same gate. Fewer of the yellow jerseys get through in a set period of time due to the massive number of reds. You can increase yellow fans entering per unit time by increasing the number of yellows (more ascorbic acid) or by decreasing the number of reds (less glucose)."

Eating fat does have some effect on both quality and levels of cholesterol.  However, your overall level is more dramatically influenced by how overweight you are.  That is: loose the weight, drop your overall level despite a high or low fat diet.    The quality of your cholesterol and your HDL ratio is now considered more important then the overall level for health and the quality is affected by what you eat. Both by the types of fats, and the types and quantity of carbs.  Healthy fats improve your HDL ratio and keeping your blood sugar levels even and avoiding large amounts of sugar (fructose) stops the extra bad type of cholesterol from forming.    But also ...  Cholesterol is also no longer thought to be the major or only factor in heart disease.  Instead it is believed that is is more impacted by widespread chronic inflammation.  So lowering inflammation is possibly more important than improving your lipid profile although the two generally go hand in hand.  Which is why cholesterol was falsely implicated previously.     How do you lower chronic inflammation?  Vegetables, healthy fats, exercise, avoiding nasty stuff (trans fats, truckloads of sugar)"

ketoscience,35nre5,SilentArashikage,11,Tue May 12 06:44:33 2015 UTC,"There is a theory that Fructogenesis might be the cause of a lot of the horrid side effects of hyperglycemia.    Most cells usually clear about 3% of their glucose using the polyol pathway by reducing it to sorbitol, then oxidizing that to create fructose.  In insulin resistant tissue that polyol pathway is apparently up regulated to clear over 30% of the glucose.  In a hyperglycemic animal, availability of (and resistance to) insulin limits glucose entering most cells.  Insulin independent tissues like the retina, nerves, kidneys don't have to wait for insulin to take up glucose - so they are free to produce a lot of sorbitol and fructose.  These don't pass easily out of the cell, which creates an osmotic gradient which damages these kinds of cells specifically.    This would contribute to diabetic retinopathy, peripherial neuropathy, and diabetic kidney disease.  Maybe we might eventually regard fructose our body makes as more dangerous than the fructose that we eat.

It's also related to the person. e.g. the few people that find it very hard to gain weight on ad libitum standard diets are adapted very fast to ketosis.

Your muscles will only be using ketones for so long. It's thought that since your brain cannot fully utilize ketones as the liver glycogen is depleted and ketogenesis initiaties the muscles burn up the excess to prevent issues of acidity in the blood.  It takes hours to start using the ketones for fuel. Over the weeks of adaptation over 90% of your body tissue, including muscle fibers, will be utilizing free fatty acids for fuel, not ketones.   *use it as energy first and store only the excess amount   The glucose will start to fill up your glycogen stores while using the glucose as a primary fuel source. Any excess would be stored as triglycerides.   *immediately start storing some of it as fat for ""emergency""   Depends upon insulin levels but they are likely to be high due to carb introduction. Excess energy = fat storage.  Bear in mind that due to downregulation of GLUT4 transporters glucose metabolism enzymes your liver has to upregulate them to properly utilize glucose as energy. This takes up to 6 hours and up to 48 hours for the rest of the body to catch up. This assumes keto-adaptation is complete."

It's where glucagon mainly acts on to not go hypoglycemic which can be dangerous. It comes to reason that even on a very low carb diet, glycogen is still used and replenished, even if it's in lower quantities since other sources of immediate energy are used, fat and ketones.  I suspect the main reason of this requirement is something basic in chemistry. e.g. Ketones or fat might be less ""burst-y"" in energy output. So, life in general might find it an advantage to have a small reserve of plain sugar.  (Glycogen is practically sugar, a carb.)"

However with migration to temperate and cold climates a switch to a more and more pronounced lipid oxidation as a default is apparent. The physiological capacity for glucose metabolism in cold acclimation does not go beyond 10% of nutrient intake. The excess of the glucose, if not utilized, is converted via DNL (Lipogenesis De Novo) in elongated and desaturated  LCFA (long chain fatty acids), a rather unpleasant stuff which gives FAO (fatty acid oxidation) a bad name. A clear and distinct line should be drawn between those fatty acids and the dietary fatty acids as their origin and effects are totally antagonistic and that's where all troubles and metabolic syndrome morbidity start."

Now it seems to be a bastardization of its former self filled with marketing Mumbo-Jumbo and chemophobic tendencies, with the keto community being the one that really stays are up on science."
ketoscience,353ixv,b34k,9,Wed May 6 23:46:03 2015 UTC,"Thats because its gained mass popularity. Its no longer a science driven approach and, instead, has become a diet driven by dogma.

ketoscience,353ixv,Tyrant_Saint,4,Thu May 7 15:59:45 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, a lot of primary resources are great, but the attitude of the community such as the religious adherence to 65/30/5, the borderline worship of bacon, etc. gets pretty old. I get that it's many people's first time exposure to it, and it can seem like some magical diet, but there's a lot more to it that most people don't bother looking into. And eventually one of three things happens - they get into an loop of try/fail/try/fail and give up, they lose the weight and go back to their pre-keto eating habits and gain it back, or they maintain the switch and keep the weight off. Like any other diet, the most important aspect is sustainability - how well can you adhere to it?  On top of that, there's so much more to it that would help out that few people (present company excluded) look into that improves the quality of the diet. Why does keto work? Why might it be better than the alternatives? Why might it be worse? How might it be made better?  As a specific instance, 65/30/5 is so heavily defended because in general, it works. However, it's suboptimal (because it would be better to calculate necessary protein first, set a maximum limit of carbs next, and fill the rest of your caloric intake with fat but still at a deficit). It's also only useful to a certain point because what is beneficial at a 300lb weight may not be the most beneficial once you break 170.  Bacon is in a similar situation. Because it's permitted on keto (one of the only diets that allows it), people think it must be the end-all be-all staple food of keto. Barring the fact that it generally is full of nitrates, bacon is still just a muscle meat with a relatively weak fatty acid profile and is therefore, suboptimal. You'd be much better off making some liver and onions, or having even a grass fed well-marbled steak."

My knowledge is limited, but here is a point below. I may be incorrect, so if someone could help that would be great.   Though it's mentioned that LDL may go up on LC diets, it's important to note that Trigs go down significantly. The kind of VLDL particle that is considered bad is formed when Trigs and LDL are both elevated, and especially Trigs being the marker. Combine that with raised HDL, and we're looking great for health improvement.   When on the LF diet, LDL goes down. Could this be explained by the conversion of trigs to VLDL? There is also an intermediary particle during the conversion that isn't ever measured. Im curious to know if trigs where high enough on a LF diet compared to LC that could explain the potential offset there. My thoughts are that even on a LF diet, we could still have more risk.   Thoughts?"

There's no correlation with LDL and CHD in women over 50.  Trigs correlate with carbohydrate consumption. I believe VLDL do as well.  For example, here are the criterion for metabolic syndrome:   Abdominal obesity: a waist circumference of 102 cm (40 in) or more in men and 88 cm (35 inches) or more in women. For Asian Americans, the cutoff values are ≥90 cm (35 in) in men or ≥80 cm (32 in) in women Serum triglycerides 150 mg/dl or above. HDL cholesterol 40mg/dl or lower in men and 50mg/dl or lower in women. Blood pressure of 130/85 or more. Fasting blood glucose of 100 mg/dl or above.

ketoscience,34jn4n,Clob,1 point,Fri May 1 23:58:51 2015 UTC,"LF generally implies high carb which generally implies higher triglycerides and more pattern B LDL. LC implies lower trigs. LC diets generally include a transient increase in LDL associated with weight loss as the amount of cholesterol contained in a pound of fat tissue is very large. This is not thought to be detrimental to health.  As I noted, you have to be very careful of types of fat (there isn't just more fat, there are good and bad fats). Some ketogenic diet trials were conducted with a nearly inhumane concoction of polyunsatured margarine (some epilepsy trials IIRC), which will obviously have a different affect on many bodily functions and lipids than a grass fed beef and egg diet with butter and cream and moderate consumption of nuts (assuming appropriate omega 3 intake).  For example, there are two papers I've read, one demonstrating clear improvement in cognitive ability in dementia patients fed a ketogenic diet and another demonstrating obvious evidence of cognitive disfunction in rats when fed a ""ketogenic feed"" in comparison with those fed ""normal rat food."" Which is correct? The answer is complicated.  TLDR there's far more to a diet than just ""High Fat, Low Carb"" which is why the information you're seeking is not readily available. It's further impossible to compare different trials as the variables aren't sufficiently controlled."

No. I took several breaks. As a matter of fact in January/Feb this year I was completely off the diet. I just went back to eating whatever I wanted - I was having heart complications along with anxiety from my ADHD medication and something had to give so I gave up the diet to eliminate any possibilities that was causing me problems.  Cardiologist gave me the all clear. I even talked to him about being in ketosis (I switched back by that point so I could be in keto when I got my heart monitoring done) and we discussed how to raise my HDL-P and how unconcerning my results have been.  I've had several cheat days over the course of my keto life. I know if I get knocked out I'll be back eventually so I don't sweat it. I hiked Supai Falls a few weeks ago and was undoubtedly not in ketosis due to the amount of carbohydrates I was ingesting and I knew I'd come back having gained 1-2 lbs. I was right.  I've learned over the years how my body responds to certain intake.  As far as exercise goes it's been off and on over the years. I snowboard consistently in the winter and when I do not do that I hike at least once every 2 weeks or so and I run now on a consistent basis. I'm training to be an endurance athlete and have been working with TKD.  I've since gained weight (my legs are fucking huge) but my stomach got bigger too so I was taking in too many carbs.  I'm up to 163 from 151 before I stopped the diet in January.  I regret nothing, though.  So overall you can see that despite being completely off the diet for 2 out of the past 6 months it didn't ruin my progress. My lipid profile is the best it has ever been (with the exception of lacking HDL-P data but I'll get that in another 6 months).  I exercise 2-3x a week... but I burn almost 750 calories when I do it... 6 miles @ nearly 8 minutes / mile."

The human body is an immensly complex machine with thousands of basic energy fluxes. You have hundered of glucose-based and fat-based cycles active at all times, no matter what your diet is.  When your diet is at a deficit, even on a high-carb diet, your body will dig into fat reserves, of course.  And about your brain questions, that's why sugar burners feel so bad when they are low on carbs, as their brain cannot really use FFAs (basic physiology), and the ketones processes, which can be used to feed the brain, take a few days to ramp up.  So yes, ketosis happens once your liver glycogen is depleted, and some other conditions set in place, like low level of oxaloacetate, that is after a few days on low carbs."

ketoscience,346ggf,Paradigm6790,4,Tue Apr 28 19:20:39 2015 UTC,"Is it suppression, or is it a return to your natural levels of satiety because the metabolic damage caused by a high carbohydrate diet is no longer affecting your body's ability to regulate your appetite naturally?"
ketoscience,346ggf,keto_does_it_4_me,2,Sat May 2 16:10:22 2015 UTC,That sounds like an excellent topic for a study
ketoscience,346ggf,the_straylight_run,3,Sat May 2 16:20:29 2015 UTC,"The magic of keto seems to be that you can avoid all the crappy low glucose feelings on a caloric deficit. Things like hunger, fatigue, headaches, crankiness. These things usually lead to a loss of willpower and quitting your diet. At least that was my experience pre keto.   That is beautifully said! It should be framed. Well, I would change the word glucose for blood glucose, for clarity.  To answer your main question: when you lose weight on a high-carbs deficit, stored fat is mainly used as FFA (free fatty acids); it is negligeably or not even used as ketones.  Quite a few people do remarkably well on high-carbs. I regularly read that up to 25% of people do fine on a high-carb diet.  That leaves us with 75+% of people feeling like crap wile dieting on high-carbs. And if on top of it they start exercising (larger deficit), yes it is a recipe for bad results."
ketoscience,346ggf,anbeav,3,Tue Apr 28 18:39:39 2015 UTC,"ITT: Two competing models (it seems) to evaluate the effectiveness of keto versus standard calorie (CICO) deficit dieting.  Model 1: Both Keto and CICO diets work on the same principle (calorie deficit), but keto leads to greater satiety, and thus greater adherence. Other metabolic effects largely irrelevant, with regard to causality, in comparison to CICO.  Model 2: Keto diet produces an actual metabolic advantage over a CICO diet, through optimising hormones which lead to mobilsing fat to a higher degree than is possible in CICO. Unclear to what extent a calorie deficit matters.  We thus seem to need to clarify a few points:   Do the hormone changes caused by keto cause the fat loss, or do they change independently of fat loss while it is occurring? Do the hormone changes caused by keto have any other bearing on the process of fat mobilisation other than greater satiety? Are calorie-deficit CICO and calorie-defict Keto equivalent to produce fat loss, assuming willpower (adherence) is not an issue for either? Is the carbohydrate component amount during a calorie deficit relevant at all, or have any impact upon, the process of losing fat itself?    While it seems like there is a great biological understanding of the mechanisms, the models built with them are both inadequate and oversimplified, at least as they are presented. Is there not a coherent model that explains the entire process and is not in contention?  I consistently see these two internal keto versions battle each other, and depending upon with whom one talks, which one is given credence.   Any thoughts?"
ketoscience,346ggf,anbeav,1 point,Thu Apr 30 10:37:38 2015 UTC,"I can only speak from my own experiences.  I certainly don't have the science to back up what I am about to say.  I think a ketogenic diet forced me to do a few things that I never wanted to do and therefore never did before.  With CICO I just assumed that if I ate 1,500 calories (or less) that would be a deficit and therefore I would lose weight.    With my ketogenic diet I...   Weighed my food to be sure I was under 25g of CHO and eating adequate protein Made more conscious decisions about eating nutrient dense foods instead of just calorie counting.  Honestly it is easier to count calories for less nutritious foods because the calorie count is right on the packaging.  Whole foods require a scale. Had specific rules to follow.  Basically a plan set out for me.  CICO was just don't eat more than X calories.   I don't think I would have been as successful with a keto diet if I hadn't failed with beachbody, CICO, Paleo, and exercise programs.  Although Paleo was a major influence on me understanding food better.  Moving from Paleo to Ketogenic Paleo was the magic for me.  I didn't change anything else about my life except my diet and it appears that I have gone from nearly 30% BF (DEXA scan) to approximately 15% bodyfat (soon to get a follow up DEXA scan) so quickly...  If I heard my story on a commercial I would think it is a scam.  No way you can go from a BMI of obese to visible abs in 90 days.  Yet it happened.  How, Why?   Because researching the keto diet made me understand the hormone responses and how to control them in my favor. Because the satiety on keto made me never even have to worry about willpower issues.  It was the opposite, I was more worried about eating enough. Because (I believe) my addiction to CrossFit workouts required an abundance of fat mobilization for energy that was not possible prior to keto.  My fitness improvements over just the past 3-4 months pre -> keto are amazing and they aren't noob gains.  I had already been doing CrossFit workouts for 2.5 years.  I'm able to press the intensity longer before I am gassed.  I hypothesize that more fat mobilization is happening = greater fat loss.   My gut feeling about your last point, the amount of carbohydrates, seems irrelevant to me.  It seems as long as you are in ketosis that more or less carbohydrates is likely irrelevant.  In other words I don't think I would lose more fat if I had zero carbohydrates as opposed to 25g, 30g, 50g, or any number that kept me in ketosis and at a caloric deficit."
ketoscience,346ggf,anbeav,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"Oh and I should say that with CICO I did lose weight.  Significant amounts of weight even.  I just don't think I did it the proper way.  My deficit was TOO extreme.  I'm sure I lost LBM.  Then when I felt like I was ""thin enough"" I quit.  I hated CICO.  I was literally exhausted, angry, hungry the whole time, but I forced the willpower for an extended period of time.  Then when I stopped the diet, I yo-yo'ed right back to my previous weight and then some.  It took about a year to happen, but it happened."

I guess we could keep it on the radar, but to give up all the real life health benefits of keto based on test tube studies is not for me.   Also, they mentioned the following:   co-treatment of NCMs with 50μM oleate + 300μM palmitate was sufficient to significantly attenuate ER stress compared to NCMs treated with palmitate alone   So a very small amount of another non-saturated fat largely prevented the negative effects of the pure saturated one. I would be curious to see what other unsaturated fats have this effect as many people on keto keep an eye out for their omega fatty acids. Or even other saturated fats as the study only tests with palmitate.  In any case, I myself am not concerned at all."

The rare state of an infusion of pure palmitate occurs during periods of extreme carbohydrate overconsumption, and even in that case palmitate is not the only fatty acid. Otherwise, palmitate is always accompanied by large portions of oleate, like in basically any dietary fat."
ketoscience,3424em,causalcorrelation,7,Mon Apr 27 19:48:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Even tallow or palm oil, which have the highest concentration of palmitate is a mixture that is generally less than 40%. I have no idea how you would get 100% palmitate into your bloodstream short of injection."

The article does imply that a normal diet is carb rich, and that saturated fat intake is corrleated with heart disease. So its possible imo that the rats are eating a carb rich diet and then being fed saturated fats.   Still its interesting that unsaturated fats seemed to not be troublesome."
ketoscience,3424em,Mangalz,4,Mon Apr 27 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"If anything what I would be concerned about is if you are a hyperresponder to saturated fat intake on this diet.  If you are, reduce it.  It will show up in your lipid profile as elevated LDL-C and LDL-P, but I strongly encourage you to verify that LDL-P is high.  http://eatingacademy.com/cholesterol-2/random-finding-plus-pi   In one particularly interesting case, a patient in self-prescribed nutritional ketosis presented to me with an LDL-P of more than 3500 nmol/L (i.e., more particles than could be measured by the NMR machine so the report simply said “>3,500 nmol/L”) despite feeling, performing, and looking great. Based on his through-the-roof desmosterol and cholanstanol levels, and a curb-side consult from the Godfather I mean Dr. Tom Dayspring, I decided to try an experiment. You see, the logical thing to do in this setting would have been to start two drugs immediately (a potent statin to address the hypersynthesis and ezetimibe to address the hyperabsorption) or tell him to abandon ketosis altogether. But this patient was adamant about staying in ketosis given the other benefits, though obviously worried about the long-term coronary implications. So, we agreed that for a 3 month trial period he would reduce SFA to an average of 25 g/day (vs. about 75 to 100 g/day) and make up the difference with monounsaturated fat (MUFA). Parenthetically, we also reduced his omega-3 PUFA given very high RBC EPA and DHA levels.  So, on balance, he consumed about the same number of calories and even total quantity of fat, but his distribution of fat intake changed and he heavily swapped out SFA for MUFA.  The result?  His LDL-P fell from >3,500 nmol/L to about 1,300 nmol/L (about 55th percentile), and his CRP fell from 2.9 mg/L to <0.3 mg/L (and for the lipoprotein cognoscenti, both desmosterol and cholanstanol fell).   ...   As a doctor I can’t look a patient in the eye and tell them a sky-high LDL-P is ok because they don’t eat carbohydrates. So if you’re following such a diet, and your LDL-P goes through the roof, I’d urge you to consider a variation of the diet."

ketoscience,33nyzy,maksull,6,Fri Apr 24 16:32:01 2015 UTC,"Low carb science says that a kcal is a kcal, just that in very high carb diets and for most people, a lot of the cals are ""stolen"" by the fat deposits unnecessarily (and deleteriously). The most intuitive explanation I have found is that we're simply carnivorous to a large extend. There is a reason sheep have four stomachs and we only have the amount of stomachs of a lion."
ketoscience,33nyzy,ZeroCarb,5,Fri Apr 24 13:43:55 2015 UTC,"Right. I mean, what's going to add fat to your body? 160 calories of sugar? Or 160 calories of almonds? The sugar will spike insulin which will convert that extra glucose into fat. The almonds won't do that. (Over simplifying, I know) They're both 160 calories, but only one of them is going to create more fat. (OVER SIMPLIFIED I KNOW!) But in general, that's  how it works. That's why a calorie is not always a calorie.   An analogy: a dollar is a dollar, right? Well, what if one is a US dollar and one is a Zimbabwean dollar? What if one is making  interest in a savings account and the other is just 100 pennies scattered on the floor? Is a dollar still a dollar in those cases? There are variables. There are differences. Same thing with calories. Our body will use the calories from almonds differently than the calories from sugar. They're made of different things."

The real problem is that most people are incompatible with high carb so that they will literally starve in order to maintain their normal weight on high carb because most of their ex-""maintenance"" calories are now just new fat and their real maintenance calories need even more food to reach even a basic level of satiety."

An influx of sugar, raising your blood sugar your body responds by removing it from your blood stream and shoves it in a broom closet.   So if we're hiding the sugar and dumping the byproducts of burnt fat, doesn't that obviously take away from the idea that a calorie is a calorie?"
ketoscience,33nyzy,ColrathD,1 point,Fri May 8 04:18:48 2015 UTC,"The main two factors are. 1. If you remain on same maintenance requirements and eat maintenance then you won't gain fat since even if you store some for some time you will burn it again anyway, since you require it, but 2. The hunger might be high to a lot of people when they have sugar highs and that may make them eat automatically more, or it may be unhealthier, or the maintenance calories may be even lower.  I think the main differences are in hunger and health. Maintenance calories going higher on low carb is a thing, but sometimes it's overestimated.  A realistic approach of understanding that the ancient hunter may have had the instinct to be chubby for a while to survive may also help."

If you have an unlimited amount of food you might be hacking the instinct of the ancient paleo hunter because he had downtimes, and he had to divide his food sometimes so he may have had the need to actually get fatter for a few months to not starve.  That being said, any set point you have -""feast or famine"" +40% ideal body weight or not - it seems that carbs set it much higher.

In theory, this gives you usable fuel for the whiskey ride while preventing the insulin swings that would kick you out of keto. I think a good test would be to have higher fat meat (85% ground beef) and see if it is still protective. My guess is no. Then do same with lean beef on another night a few days later.

If you have anxiety or stimulate the adrenaline pathway then glycogen breakdown exceeds production by a long shot. When you eat food, insulin makes sure your production exceeds breakdown. This is kind of a binary state that prevents a ""futile cycle."" Any 'aerobic' activity utilizes the glycogen stores in the short term, but they fill back up after you start to rest.   Glycogen is kind of like an insurance policy in case you encounter a bear or armed mugger - the fight/flight response would be useless without a surge of ATP as a result of rapid glycogenolysis.

I read an article by Peter Attia about substrate utilization in keto-adapted athletes.  Us ketoers that are adapted tend to use nearly 100% fat and ketones for muscle work in the low end (below 60% effort), and especially when doing aerobic work.  On the high end, when doing high-intensity work, our muscles partially go into anaerobic mode and that's when glucose utilization kicks in.  So.. I guess, yeah.

Unfortunately,  the only way to ""prove"" that a vegan diet is healthy is with heavy observer bias and lots of misleading people or outright lying.     It's not like keto is 100% foolproof either; we have to watch our electrolytes and it's possible to miss out on micronutrients if we don't eat enough vegetables (or organ meats). Our community can also go a little crazy with pushing our philosophy. The big difference is that good unbiased research tends to support carbohydrate restriction and consumption of high fat as being much healthier than a standard American diet, and more effective than a low fat high carb diet for weight loss and people with a personal or family history of diabetes or heart disease.     A vegan diet is healthy in that you get all your micronutrients more easily,  but in the long term what your body is not getting can be problematic.

I've been on keto for more than 2 years, and I checked my blood sugar and ketones level almost every day. At some point during a plateau I read about berberine and I started taking it. I took about one pill a day for about 2 weeks. And then I stopped, and I'm never again going to touch it. I don't know for sure if it's because of the berberine, or some other change in my lifestyle that I wasn't aware of, but my morning blood sugar increased seriously. I'm talking here from less than 90 mg/dL every single day (and sometimes less than 80) to regularly more than 130. This freaked me out. I stopped taking berberine and I kept having elevated blood sugar. This happened about 1 year ago. About one month ago I decided to take  a break from keto. The thing that finally brought my morning blood sugar back down was beer (can you imagine? beer is the first thing I ditched when I started keto. For me beer pretty much = evil, but I was too scared, I needed to take drastic measures). Now my blood sugar is 100 or below. I'm back on keto. I'm seeing an endochrinologist next week, and I'll ask if there's anything to worry about. Maybe it was just the thing we call in this keto forum ""physiological insulin resistance"", and it's ok. Physically I certainly don't feel weak or sick or anything. Quite the opposite. Never in my life until keto did I run more than 10k, now I run half-marathons.   Sorry for the wall of text.

Some of the more obvious ones are insulin's impact on the way your body reserves electrolytes, and how that changes when insulin is chronically low. Others are more long term, like the way muscles have their energy partitioned (normal dietary conditions > run on glucose. Keto diet conditions > not enough glucose for this to happen > run on ketones. long term> run on fatty acids).  The flu usually lasts less than 3 days.

Due to the increase of dihydrogen phosphate and ammonium ions your body needs to maintain a pH balance buffer such that your blood does not become too acidic. This shit gets pushed out and due to the effects of osmotic diuresis it pulls out potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium and water with it.  So you need more to not experience keto-flu.  That simple.  So up your electrolyte intake until your symptoms disappear and you will be successful.  Oh, make sure you eat anywhere from 0.5 - 1 g of protein / lb of lean body mass (body mass * body fat %) so you do not experience any issues with muscle tissue catabolism. I'd shoot for 0.8 as 0.9 and 1.0 g/lb is likely necessary for athletes.  Good luck."

ketoscience,32vxcy,TeamVerdun,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:28:57 2015 UTC,An article was posted here a few months back about the rash possibly being the death of a candida infection (which feeds on sugar).

ketoscience,32vxcy,kertronic,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:43:15 2015 UTC,"I had the exact same rash a few weeks after starting keto last year. It was located on my back, under my breast and on my sides where I have folds of skin. I suspected a reaction to my sweat too because the rash was located where I tend to sweat the most. I had the rash for 3 long months! I went to the doctor a couple of times and got wrong diagnostics and wrong creams... I had a cortisone cream and an antifungal cream. At that point the rash had gotten worse, it had spread on my abdomen, between my breast, on my neck and on my head. Finally one doctor gave me antibacterial pills and it worked. After 4-5 days it started  disappearing.  After that episode I continued to have some itchy pimples when I was sweating a lot. But it was not as itchy and it was disappearing after 2-3 days.  Then last month I started eating even less carbs (I did an elimination diet to see if I'm sensitive to Fodmaps cause I think I have SIBO) and I got a rash again. Same location, on my back and under my breast. I posted pictures on a group I was on and a few people told me it was probably a detox rash because the rash was located where lymph nodes are. I have no idea if they were right or not but that might be the explanation. I didn't want to go to the doctor that time because of my previous experience. What I did was to apply pure oregano oil mixed with some avocado oil (could be olive oil too, just to dilute the oregano oil because it is too strong). I was taking oregano oil internally too because it's a natural antibacterial herb and a known cure for SIBO. I don't know if it's because of the oregano oil but that time my rash lasted only about 2 and a half weeks.  I hope that helped. Good luck with the rash!"
ketoscience,32t3oj,sheepdog_tx,4,Thu Apr 16 14:27:39 2015 UTC,"So I can speak to 2 of these: intermittent fasting and cold thermogenesis.    IF: I have been doing this for about 1 month. I am a huge fan. Maybe it is the keto diet, but I have so much energy during the day when I don't eat breakfast or lunch (20/4 fasting). My stomach will grumble as if to say ""hey, remember me,"" but as soon as I tell it to piss off, it shuts up. About 1:30 every day I get this crazy surge of energy. I typically eat 1000-1200 calories per day. Sometimes I have to search for things to eat. While, I am trying to lose weight now, once I hit my goal, I will likely have to work to hit maintenance calories on a 20/4 schedule. I might go back to eat more meals on the weekends.    I do not regularly do anything that could be referred to ""working out."" I play with my daughter and walk my dogs. I have not had any problems with energy with IF and these activities.    Cold thermogenesis: This topic interests me a lot. However, some of the people that do this come across as just NUTS. I have experimented with some cold exposure, but I have no plans to sit in a bathtub of ice water.    The week I started IF, I also did some cold exposure. I would go out  in the yard or walk the dogs when it was about 40 degrees in pants and a t-shirt (sometimes gloves). I lost a lot of weight that week. More than my calorie intake and TDE would predict. Was it the cold? Was it the move to IF (and likely too low of a calorie intake)? I am not sure. I am looking forward to when it warms up a bit more and I can start swimming in some cool (not cold) water.     This guy is where I started reading about cold thermogenesis: http://hypothermics.com/category/blog/. There is some stuff that is interesting there. The guy, Ray Cronise, has his own calorimeter and does a bunch of experiments on himself and others. He is featured in the book The Four Hour Body."
ketoscience,32t3oj,DrPeterVenkman_,3,Thu Apr 16 16:54:08 2015 UTC,"Cold exposure is possibly a minimal exercise if done for the limited amounts of time that would be usually done. Consider that even mainstream exercise is extremely disappointing in calorie loss. Sprinting like a maniac for an hour might only take out the energy one can eat in a few bites.  That's why one of the most ""funny because it's true"" things I've heard from low carb scientists is ""why not just not eat that slice of bread instead of going up and down the stairs for dozens of times?"".  Exercise et. al. is best done for other reasons, not calorie burning."
ketoscience,32t3oj,ZeroCarb,2,Thu Apr 16 18:30:20 2015 UTC,"I personally do not advocate anyone trying to excersise to lose weight. For most people, it flat out does not work. By tying weight loss to running such that if you stop running you have failed at losing weight. Strenuous exercise can lead to post-workout overeating, you think that because you ran for 40 minutes, a smoothie is a good idea. So we are the same page with that.    Cold thermogenesis is a little different than exercise in two respects:  One, cold exposure may burn more calories per minute than exercise (I have seen reports of DOUBLE the amount). Two, the additional calories burned are mostly fat (check the link above, he shows this), whereas with strenuous exercise, you mostly burn glycogen. (Obviously this not as interesting to someone who is running while fasting or on a keto diet but interesting nonetheless.)"
ketoscience,32t3oj,DrPeterVenkman_,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:40:21 2015 UTC,"That reminds of brown fat. Its main job is to give heat, though I'm not sure if it's directly related. Good point that it may be of less importance to someone already using fat from ketosis."
ketoscience,32t3oj,ZeroCarb,2,Thu Apr 16 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"Yes heat up regulation is primarily through brown fat. People used to believe that only babies had brown fat, but it has been shown to exist in adults too, and cold exposure has been shown to create more brown fat. As the brown fat burns fat for heat, it replenishes it stores from your other fats stores.   So, if I can burn twice as many calories walking around my yard in the cold listening to a podcast or something vs. running, well...."

ketoscience,32t3oj,causalcorrelation,2,Sat May 2 21:16:46 2015 UTC,"I really like intermittent fasting. What I tended to do was eat just one meal a day, or one large meal and one snack.  I kinda started doing it accidentally, and discovered several benefits, some of which may have overlapped with keto benefits.  I stopped feeling hungry, almost ever.  At the same time, I found myself able to eat enormous meals if I wanted to (I had calorie goals). In fact, I found the ability to eat really huge meals without feeling full (as in 4 or 5 thousand calories). I was working out in the evening, and would work out fasted, and eat my ginormuss meals after that, then go to bed."
ketoscience,32t3oj,FrigoCoder,4,Fri Apr 17 04:44:19 2015 UTC,"Start the day with fasted cardio, or after consuming some zero calorie supplement that makes fat burning easy. (See below for one such innocous stack). It helps mood and energy greatly. Lifting should be done before supper. Supper should contain the vast majority of carbs. Consume 1-2g sodium for example from both, and some potassium after workout and/or before sleeping. Sleep for 7-8 hours. If you get interrupted sleep, or insomnia, fix that as soon as possible. (You might not get enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium.) 5-HTP can cause heart valve disease by serotonergic mechanisms. You need EGCG or Carbidopa to inhibit Aromatic L-amino Acid Decarboxylase in the periphery, allowing 5-HTP to pass the blood-brain barrier and turn into Serotonin there. 5-HTP also puts you at risk of serotonin syndrome, especially combined with MAOIs. Messing with serotonergic neurotransmissions are not recommended anyway. Tyrosine and Caffeine both can elevate blood pressure, dehydrate you, and over time mess with serotonergic neurotransmissions. Tyrosine also builds tolerance quickly, and is fairly useless in general. I would not waste money on it. Glutamine is highly glucogenic, and provides an alternate energy source for cells, so it might interfere with ketosis. Use only around exercise if you have to. Yohimbine is an alpha2 adrenergic antagonist and thus can interfere with attention and executive function. It is also very anxiogenic. Forskolin is a very wide acting substance that increases cAMP. Increasing cAMP in the prefrontal cortex interferes hard with executive function. Increasing cAMP in the kidney can mess with its functioning. You are asking for side effects with such a wide acting drug. ECA stack has a lot of risks, please read up on them: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECA_stack#Risks Avoid hypoglycemic agents like Cinnamon and R-ALA while on keto. All they do is to mess with the keto-adaptation of cells, and potentially increase the rate of gluconeogenesis. They could also trigger hypoglycemic effects like palpitations or insomnia. Carnitine and ALCAR are most probably fine though. They are actually needed for fatty acid oxidation, and are depleted on keto. There might not be a need for grass fed meat. The fatty acid composition of beef for example, barely differs between grass fed and conventional fed. Both contain negligible amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids, so no need to fear Arachidonic Acid. For omega 3, either find a quality supplement that contains vitamin E, and is preferably refrigerated, or rely on omega 3 enriched eggs. I would recommend against PSMF. It has no real advantages over keto, only more risks. Citrulline malate might interfere with ketosis by malic acid replenishing oxaloacetate. Fasted cardio is good. Beta Alanine is anxiogenic, depletes Taurine, and prevents uptake of Taurine into the brain, potentially causing cerebral atrophy. You could try caffeine + carnitine + choline as a simple preworkout stack. This is assuming that choline does not interfere with ketosis after induction. At the moment this is unknown. I would not bother with liver protection, assuming you are on keto, and get adequate amounts of choline, folate, vitamin b12, and other vitamins. I would not mess with kidney function, you might accidentally screw up ketoadaptation. Testosterone supplements have negligible effects, I would not waste my money on them.     There are only basic keto hacks that worth it:   Exercise Fish oil Potassium bicarbonate (but not sodium bicarbonate) Coconut/MCT oil Leucine and possibly HMB Possibly olive oil Possibly caffeine + (acetyl-l-)carnitine + choline, again, if choline does not interfere with ketosis."

Since then, new findings have been published regarding the relationship between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, including supplementation, and cardiovascular health.  Methods   A literature search was undertaken in PubMed and Medline, for literature published between January 1, 2007 and August 31, 2013.  Results and Conclusions  A total of eight research questions were developed and, using the National Health and Medical Research Council’s evidence assessment framework, conclusions were made in relation to dietary intake of fish and omega-3 LCPUFA for cardiovascular health. In the evidence published since 2007, this summary of evidence concludes that dietary intake of fish was found to be mostly consistent with respect to protection from heart disease and stroke. Higher fish intake was associated with lower incident rates of heart failure in addition to lower sudden cardiac death, stroke and myocardial infarction. In relation to omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation, neither a beneficial nor adverse effect was demonstrated in primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). Although the evidence continues to be positive for the role of omega-3 LCPUFA in the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia and a modest positive benefit in heart failure. No further evidence was found to support the consumption of 2 g alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)/day over the current Australian guidelines for 1 g/day"

ketoscience,32ew4h,hastasiempre,9,Mon Apr 13 05:48:27 2015 UTC,"Link worked for me.   Abstract:   Alzheimer's disease is a devastating disease whose recent increase in incidence rates has broad implications for rising health care costs. Huge amounts of research money are currently being invested in seeking the underlying cause, with corresponding progress in understanding the disease progression. In this paper, we highlight how an excess of dietary carbohydrates, particularly fructose, alongside a relative deficiency in dietary fats and cholesterol, may lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease. A first step in the pathophysiology of the disease is represented by advanced glycation end-products in crucial plasma proteins concerned with fat, cholesterol, and oxygen transport. This leads to cholesterol deficiency in neurons, which significantly impairs their ability to function. Over time, a cascade response leads to impaired glutamate signaling, increased oxidative damage, mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction, increased risk to microbial infection, and, ultimately, apoptosis. Other neurodegenerative diseases share many properties with Alzheimer's disease, and may also be due in large part to this same underlying cause.  ...Over time, neurons become severely damaged due to chronic exposure to glucose and oxidizing agents, and are programmed for apoptosis due to highly impaired function. Once sufficiently many neurons are destroyed, cognitive decline is manifested. Simple dietary modification, towards fewer highly-processed carbohydrates and relatively more fats and cholesterol, is likely a protective measure against Alzheimer's disease.  This is a HUGE deal. Lending credence to our long-held idea that too much fruit, and too few dietary fats, is detrimental to the brain."

ketoscience,32e8ag,hastasiempre,3,Mon Apr 13 01:48:15 2015 UTC,"So this article is quite interesting, especially because it has DIRECT RELEVANCE for why a ketogenic diet helps people who are weight-loss resistant. It is also one of the areas of which I am quite well-read, so here goes my take on the article:  The study specifically looked at carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (Not going into detail on the different variants, not that important for the paper), which links long-chain fatty acyls with carnitine to from acyl-carnitine (Eg Steroyl-CoA formed from stearic acid and CoA, with an acyl being the side-chain version of a carboxylic acid like methyl is the side-chain version of methane.) Carnitine palmitoyltranferase I is located in the cell cytoplasm. After the acyl-carnitine is formed, a translocase enzyme moves it through the outer mitochondrial membrane and then a second translocase enzyme moves it through the inner mitochondrial membrane. After arriving in the mitochondrial matrix, carnitine palmitoyltransferase II decouples the fatty acyl from the carnitine, and the translocases moves the carnitine back into the cell cytoplasm to be used again. With the fatty acyl inside the mitochondrial matrix, beta oxidation can proceed.  Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I is competively inhibited by malonyl-CoA. The exact mechanism of this is unknown, and is not mentioned in the study, but may be that malonyl-CoA expresses a higher affinity for the enzyme than fatty acyls, which leads to a shuffling of malonyl-CoA into the mitochondria. Inside the mitochondria the malonyl-CoA is converted back into malonate, which goes through the citrate cycle until it becomes citrate and then just gets exported back into the cytoplasm as citrate, from which the malonyl-CoA just gets formed again.  Malonyl-CoA is formed both in de novo lipogenesis as well as lipid elongation. It is necessary to attach extra carbons to fatty acids. The regulatory mechanism malonyl-CoA exhibits on carnitine palmitoyltransferase I is necessary for both lipogenesis and elongation to proceed normally, and is also a way to reduce ""futile cycles"" where the acetyl-CoA formed from breaking down fatty acids is used to form... Fatty acids again. The cycling of malonyl-CoA back and forth is much less energy intensive, and it thus an energy conserving mechanism.  In the study, they used a mutant form of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I that is not subject to regulation by malonyl-CoA, which they inserted into adipocytes using an adenovirus. They incubated their mutated adipocytes in a medium containing palmitate and malonyl-CoA. They found that markers of obesity on the adipocytes disappeared, in that the adipocytes did NOT increase in triglyceride content even when grown in a palmitate medium and there was partially restored insulin sensitivity compared to non-mutated controls.  So with that out of the way, why is this important for the ketogenic diet? This study shows that obesity is at least partially the result of excess de novo lipogenesis, or at least that the negative health effects are caused by it. It's frankly HUGE! Why? Because de novo lipogenesis does not really occur on a ketogenic diet, because de novo lipogenesis requires both glucose and insulin stimulation to happen in significant degrees. Also, blood palmitate (And it's mono-unsaturated sibling, palmitoleic acid) is strongly related with de novo lipogenesis as per Phinney and Volek in the Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living.  The study looked at a malonyl-CoA insensitive carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, but what happens when you remove the malonyl-CoA by removing carbohydrate? You get the exact same effect! It's virtually a mechanism by which the ketogenic, or pretty much any low-carbohydrate diet, is superior to a high-carbohydrate diet by virtue of the absence of malonyl-CoA inhibition alone. It also explains why some people can ONLY lose weight on a low-carb diet, namely people who perform very high levels of de novo lipogenesis at the merest hint of glucose and/or insulin stimulation.  I could write a lot more about this study, but I think that covers the most important bits. The difference between healthy controls, obese subjects and diabetic subjects is a whole other topic."
ketoscience,32e8ag,callesen58,0,Mon Apr 13 12:27:45 2015 UTC,"Nice take. A short explanation will be that induced FAO (which is what KD delivers) inhibits glucose oxidation and DNL, both based on glucose and insulin, and lowers TAG-DAG (respectively VLDL) formed by SREBP-1c activation (Malonyl CoA, DNL) and reduces the low (to medium) grade inflammation, appearing as sequence of Glu Ox and SREBP-1c activation. Btw if you are interested in that area I would recommend the book Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase Genes in Lipid Metabolism by James Ntambi. It's HUGE. The article I posted about Alzheimer revolves around the same paths."

ketoscience,3254wj,ashsimmonds,2,Sat Apr 11 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"Several things are going on here:  1) BCAAs interfere with ketone production. All protein isolates have the potential to interfere with ketone production, since they A) Serve as precursors to substrates in the citrate cycle. Ketogenesis occurs when hepatocytes (Liver cells) slow down the citrate cycle due to a lack of oxaloacetate, which results in a build up of acetyl-CoA sufficient for the spontaneous generation of acetoacetyl-CoA from which ketogenesis occurs. B), protein (And isolates especially) increase insulin, which impairs beta-oxidation in the liver and prevents the release of fatty acids from fat cells. However, the insulin increasing scenario is not relevant when you exercise immediately afterwards, since the adrenaline and other hormones resulting from exercise overrules the action of insulin on the liver and fat cells.  2) Intense exercise lowers ketone levels. During intense exercise or when muscle cells otherwise produce lactate in excess, the liver continually recycles lactate in order to prevent acidosis and to provide more glucose for the muscles. This recycling, called the Cori Cycle, involves as a step the conversion of pyruvate into oxaloacetate. The increased availability of oxaloacetate during intense exercise speeds up the citrate cycle in liver cells and, as explained above, prevents or drastically limits the production of ketone bodies.  During exercise, the brain also runs on lactate from the muscles (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18653766). The linked study is in non-ketogenic scenarios. It is quite plausible that in the ketotic state the brain switches from ketone oxidation to lactate oxidation during intense exercise. After the intense exercise ends, ketone levels will rise as lactate levels fall, providing no significant deprivation of substrate for the brain."

(yeah I know I keep going on about glucagon, but every time insulin is mentioned in the absence of glucagon discussion a little hormone baby is killed)    All the other amino acids are either potentially glucogenic, or partially both.

I've done long write-ups on semi-related stuff before, but basically it's pretty normal to be very low almost undetectable ketotic upon waking even in zero carb folk, and even for hours afterward, but toward midday/afternoon with no carbohydrate or severe protein assault we go peak ketones.

There are examples of molecules that are mirror images of each other that have different functions.  It's like saying a fat is a fat or all 18 carbon fats (e.g. the monounsaturated oleic acid vs. the saturated stearic acid) are the same or all 18-carbon monounsaturated fats are the same (18:1 fats).  18:1 is the configuration for oleic acid (think olive oil), elaidic acid (the super bad trans fat), and vaccinic acid (the ""healthy"" trans fat found in ruminants).  Shape and function are everything.  While two things may be ""similar"", don't make any assumptions."

ketoscience,31ym8o,zewski,0,Mon May 11 20:38:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't outright say that Dr. Fung claims CICO is false, it's more of a secondary system to the master system that is hormones.  That is, CICO is a thermodynamic law that cannot be broken. So the body will increase the ""calories out"" side of the equation naturally in order to stay near a point of equilibrium in response to the ""calories in"" side of the equation increasing."
ketoscience,31ym8o,alonzoub,4,Thu Apr 9 04:53:16 2015 UTC,"True at some type of basic cellular level, but largely irrelevant in regards to food consumed, which i believe dr Fung argues is hormone driven. If what you say is correct (and I tend to agree) then the whole concept of cutting calories to lose weight is futile isn't it? Rather we should be eating at a level which maintains our desired body weight and fat composition goals. After all normal weight people don't  maintain a deficit do they? For overweight people this should automatically put them at a caloric deficit, and I theorise probably the correct one, rather than the hit and miss approach being taken now, based on the theory that a higher deficit leads to greater weight loss - perhaps true in the short term, but not productive for sustained weight loss. I argued this recently in a post on the /keto  subreddit and was told that even one calorie matters, which is taking the thermodynamic law to the extreme in terms of food consumption. But seems to be the trend lately when people ignore the role of the biochemical balance of our bodies."
ketoscience,31ym8o,AZ_Steve,2,Thu Apr 9 05:40:35 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.  It seems to me that there is more to it than CICO, but it is still an unknown or at least not quantifiable.  CICO at least anecdotally seems to work and it makes sense.  Doesn't mean it is right.  I've lost 31 pounds in 86 days.  I am 6'2"" and weighed 228 pounds with a DXA scan in my hand that said I was 27% body fat on January 12th.  I mention it only for context.  I am at about a 500-600 daily calorie deficit.  Maintenance for me is about 2400 calories.  Some days less of a deficit.  Rarely more of a deficit, and on two separate occasions I was on vacation for a total of 6 days.  All 6 days I definitely was above maintenance calories.  3 of the days I kicked myself completely out of ketosis binging on fresh tortillas and Mexican beer.  Certainly there is water weight to factor in, but I would have to be at nearly a 1260 calorie deficit if we try to do the math.  If instead I assume 31 pounds in 80 days (throwing out the vacation overeating days) and assume 15 pounds of water weight that would still be a 700 daily calorie deficit.  (Edit - I redid my math from last night, I miscounted my days, and now the math seems to be more in line with CICO).  Yes I exercise, but not more than about 45 minutes per day, 4-5 days per week. 20-30 minutes of weight training and then about 10-15 minutes of HIIT.  It's probably somewhere around 200 calories I would guesstimate.  (Edit - So while I had originally thought that CICO is overly simplified, it may be closer than I thought for me.  15 pounds of assumed water weight loss seems high, but it's not out of the realm of possibility.  CICO still intuitively seems too simple for the complexity that is the human body, but the n=1 in my case seems to bear it out.)"
ketoscience,31ym8o,Junkbot,2,Thu Apr 9 08:35:02 2015 UTC,"10lbs of water is not that high of an amount, and likely a gross underestimation of the 31lbs lost. This guy lost almost 25lbs in a day, most of it being water.  A 500 Calorie deficit for 50 days is 7lbs of fat lost. The additional 200 Calories burned 4x a week is another 2lbs. So 9lbs fat lost + 22lbs water weight in ~2 months? Not impossible by any means."
ketoscience,31ym8o,AZ_Steve,2,Thu Apr 9 11:52:35 2015 UTC,"Not saying it's impossible, my point is that ultimately the person will need to one day revert to a normal caloric intake which matches their goal body weight, composition, and personal metabolism. And as anyone who has fasted knows, managing the transition from fasting to eating is harder than refraining from food in the first place. It seems logical to me (but happy to be corrected) that aiming for the correct  amount of calories from the very beginning will train the body to the correct weight, rather than overshooting the mark, suffering metabolic slowdown problems, then having to adjust later."
ketoscience,31ym8o,AZ_Steve,2,Thu Apr 9 12:38:21 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting theory.  Just plug in something like 180 pounds and current lean body mass and eat that amount of macros/calories.  You assume that our body will naturally go there.  The hard part would be someone that wants to put on more muscle as well.  Seems like they would need to adjust to build it.  But I hear you... instead of possibly cutting too many calories and harming your metabolism, just eat maintenance for the size you intend to be and let your body figure it out.  Maybe.  Might work in some circumstances.  Probably not for someone that is extremely obese.  Seems like the caloric deficit might be too extreme and should be eased into over time."
ketoscience,31ym8o,AZ_Steve,2,Thu Apr 9 17:02:57 2015 UTC,"The reason I started thinking about this was that I was doing some crazy fasting schedules in order to severely cut my calorie intake (not for weight loss though) to average below 800 cal per day over the week, found my body slowing down and thinking this is not sustainable in the long run, so I upped my calories back to about 2000 a day, as I expected I put on weight initially, probably mainly water (hey - easy come, easy go), then after about a week it started to drop again slowly. I also discovered that eating 80% of your calories as fat at 2000 Cal needs quite a bit of conscious effort, which is why it's so easy to eat at a large deficit on this diet, although I'm against the trend of keto becoming a Weight Watchers type diet as a tool to lower caloric intake by worrying about carbs and protein only and ignoring the fat. It will work... For a while, just like WW, until the body catches up (or slows down to match your intake, which is more likely the case). Once your body adjusts to the new lower intake, regaining weight is a certainty once you return to a normal intake, which must happen sooner or later, hence the diet yo-yo'ing many of us have experienced."
ketoscience,31ym8o,Hexariu,3,Thu Apr 9 17:35:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think once your body reaches that homeostasis that your are no longer at a caloric deficit and therefore this becomes your new normal.  If you up your intake then certainly you will store fat again.  The additional problem is that if you have lost muscle mass during your diet you are going to be in an even worse situation if you go back to your prior eating levels.  You'll end up with an even higher percentage of body fat.  I would say in general people really need to be extra conscious about their eating habits and exercise regimen if they are changing things or their body has changed.  Hitting a magic number on a scale, having a party, and then going back to the ""old normal"" is definitely a recipe for disaster."
ketoscience,31ym8o,Kamelasa,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:10:24 2015 UTC,"Regarding the obese , it's a good point, perhaps in those cases it's a matter of setting multiple goals along the way, ""planned plateaus"" so to speak, waiting for the body set point to normalise then move on. It would make for an interesting experiment."
ketoscience,31ym8o,somanyroads,2,Thu Apr 9 17:06:42 2015 UTC,"You are right. It was late last night and I miscounted my days on keto.  I've read the 25 pounds in a day thing before, but it's not like I've been hanging out in saunas and purposely dehydrating myself.  I would think once the glycogen water dump occurs that water weight loss is primarily over.  Is it likely that a person has over 2 pounds of glycogen hanging out holding on to 4x the amount of water?  I don't know the answer to that, but 22 pounds of water weight would be more like 4 pounds of glycogen, right?  I will go back and edit my post above.  Math and keto are hard =)"
ketoscience,31ym8o,Sneakstir,4,Thu Apr 9 16:44:14 2015 UTC,"The thermodynamic argument assumes that regardless of the state your body is in, it absorbs the same quantity of calories from the food you ingest, which is not true. Also, the body has mechanisms to preserve calories (diminishing your level of ""energy"", slowing your metabolism, etc.). The problem in the CICO is that it is considered that other variables (e.g. hormones) are negligible outside of specific pathologies (obesity is not considered one of them)."
ketoscience,31ym8o,alonzoub,2,Thu Apr 9 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly, when you look at both sides of the CICO equation, there are so many variables it's almost impossible to determine with accuracy. On one side we have CI (due to variability  in food composition, the method of determining calories, etc) and then CO (e.g. Individual's insulin resistance, hormone balance, physical activity, climate, sleep patterns,etc.), it becomes a stab in the dark at best, probably ok as a rough rule of thumb to start with, but to state it as an absolute law of weight loss or gain as many do, is absurd in my opinion."

Yeah, the simplemindedness of it drives me nuts. A rough rule of thumb for attempting to quantify, overall, sure, but it doesn't in the least get at the causes of storage of food calories (as fat or as muscle) versus burning of them.

Your requirement for glucose goes down to something like 40g/day. So you will eat some of that as carbs and the rest will be converted from the protein you eat. This is why keto diets have a minimum suggest protein intake: this protein will help supply any deficit in glucose and to re-build any muscle that is broken down.    EDIT: That amount of protein being converted to glucose will nit hurt your kidneys, unless you have some pre-existing condition.  EDIT#2: In my post above I have corrected ""spare protein"" to ""spare muscle"" to be more accurate and differentiate muscle vs. consumed protein."

ketoscience,31xjfu,Wickatron,5,Wed Apr 8 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"There is some, though most of it is anecdotal, and much of it is based off of design flaws.   Lean mass gain/retention. Studies designed to compare lean mass gain/retention often fail to account for the glycogen loss associated with ketogenic diets.  Because of this, there are many published studies that show a lean mass retention/gain advantage to high carb diets compared to low carb/ketogenic diets.  This may or may not be a reality, but the design flaw in the studies does not allow us to know for certain.  On the other hand, there is at least one study in which the ketogenic dieters followed their regimen with a carb-load before having their mass compared to that of the high-carb dieters, and the low carb/ketogenic dieters came out ahead.  My conclusion here is that there's not enough good data to know for certain if LC/K diets are better for lean mass gain, but they do appear to be at least as good for lean mass retention during loss. High intensity exercise performance. There is some evidence to suggest either that it takes a very long time to adapt to very high intensity exercise (like all-out sprints) while ketogenic or that ketogenic diets are inferior to higher carb diets with respect to this kind of exercise.  The data is inconclusive though, and in some cases, individuals performing at highly intense levels are just as capable as those on higher carb diets. Ketogenic diets seem to be less effective for women. I don't have an explanation for this one, and I have a suspicion that it has more to do with women having a generally more emotional relationship with food than men, but this is truly a consistent pattern that individuals as well as practitioners who work with patients discuss. Possibly due to hormonal changes caused by higher fat/cholesterol diets favoring men. Certain genes can actually make consumption of fats/cholesterol produce sub-par blood markers.  I don't know if there is conclusive evidence to suggest this actually causes various chronic diseases, but it is at least alarming when your blood markers go in the opposite direction of desirable.  I would probably mark this as the greatest dark mark against ketogenic diets, and is alone a good reason to get a baseline cholesterol test before and after keto (but give it some time after!). It's one of the ApoE genes, though I don't remember which variant it is, that I'm thinking of. I do believe there are others as well. Some people do just fine with lots of carbs. Keto is still at least socially less than convenient, at least in America. If you are someone who can tolerate carbs, I don't really see a reason to keto."

ALL diets are less effective for women than for men, not because of their emotional issues, but because testosterone favors building muscle mass while estrogen favors storing fat. If there's a study that shows that that this performance delta is higher under keto than with other diets, I'd like to see it.  Anecdotally, I've actually experienced the opposite - keto is the most effective diet for women with PCOS, a hormonal disorder that makes it extremely hard to lose weight with conventional diets. 10+% of women have this disorder, and it's thought to be one of the biggest causes of obesity in women (and is also a leading cause in female infertility)."

ketoscience,31xjfu,causalcorrelation,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"Right, but women are supposed to have low testosterone. To get back to PCOS, one of the primary symptoms is elevated testosterone which causes all sorts of nasty sideeffects, such as the aforementioned infertility - and absolutely ludicrous levels of obesity. Some 95% of women who have PCOS are overweight, with high testosterone levels. Keto lowers it into the normal range - and suddenly weight loss starts happening.  It's about having good ratios of hormones, not one or the other - both sexes have the other sex's hormone, and that's vital to keep stuff functioning (for example, it's commonly known that a slight testosterone increase leads to higher sex drive in women - but men actually get a sex drive boost from estrogen, bigger than the increase they get from a similiar dose of testosterone.) Make the dose too big, though, and stuff starts malfunctioning.  High testosterone + high estrogen = slow weight loss, if not gain. High testosterone + low estrogen = very good weight loss. Low testosterone + high estrogen = decent weight loss."
ketoscience,31xjfu,FrigoCoder,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:41:16 2015 UTC,"This is off-topic.  Normal diets don't raise men's testosterone.  I don't know what they do to women, but it implies that high fat diets are particularly beneficial for men in terms of body composition.  Maybe they are equally beneficial to women as well, but I would assume they are not.  Lowering testosterone is not going to make women more muscular."
ketoscience,31xjfu,keto_does_it_4_me,0,Sun Apr 19 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"It's not off-topic. Your claim was that this diet is not very effective for women, listed as a drawback (and potentially scaring people off this diet), and when pressed for a reason, you said it lowers testosterone. But the case of PCOS women clearly shows that lowering testosterone does NOT hinder weight loss. Quite the opposite.  That men might benefit from keto's additional testosterone - and thus more muscle mass - is not a drawback to keto. That's an additional positive, one which women happen to not get. But they wouldn't get it on any other diet either."
ketoscience,31xjfu,causalcorrelation,0,Sun Apr 19 19:51:56 2015 UTC,"Now you're starting to seem kinda combative about all of this.  Keto appears to be less effective for women. We don't know why, but part of it probably has to do with the fact that women are more likely to have emotional relationships with food, and emotionally comforting foods are almost invariably full of carbs (if you've ever heard a man say ""I could never give up fruit"" I'd probably retract this statement, but I probably wouldn't believe you lol). As a second possibility, keto diets change hormones in a way that tends to cause men's muscles to grow and fat to shrink. The change in female hormones is a good thing, for sure, but doesn't have the same muscle stimulating and fat suppressing effect.  It might be a great treatment for PCOS, but in women who don't have PCOS, less testosterone will probably reduce their muscle mass and increase their fat mass, as that's what lowered testosterone tends to do (which is not to suggest this happens in a vacuum).  Its not a downside to be particularly beneficial to men, but it does mean women may have to curb their expectations of the diet more than men do. I would call this a potential downside, as much of the most promising research centera on results in men.  I didn't say the diet was ineffective for women. And the given reason from bill lagakos was only to point out why/that the difference of the effects between men and women might be so pronounced."
ketoscience,31xjfu,ashsimmonds,0,Sun Apr 19 22:55:53 2015 UTC,"Keto appears to be less effective for women. We don't know why [...]   You have yet to provide a single piece of evidence that it's keto that's ineffective for women and not, you know, weightloss in general. That's my problem right here. All weightloss is slower for women, and science has long since figured out why that is - because female bodies are more prone to storing and holding onto fat. It's physiology, not some just-so wild guess about how women are emotional about food.  I'm sorry if wanting some actual scientific basis for your claims comes off as combatitiveness to you."
ketoscience,31xjfu,keto_does_it_4_me,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:51:19 2015 UTC,"good god, I haven't once said it is ineffective.  You quote me in one line and then say something different in another.  Here's a discussion from eatingacademy.com with a quote from Phinney:   To my knowledge, there is nothing in the peer-reviewed literature that answers this question.  That said, I have had many young adult female subjects in metabolic ward studies who uniformly maintained nutritional ketosis as long as their diet was strictly controlled in an “extremely low carb and moderate protein” range (aka less than 30 grams of carb and no more than 100 grams of protein per day).  In addition, we have done weekly ketone analyses on over 6000 clients in outpatient low carb clinics and did not stumble upon an a priori connection between low ketones and late luteal phase.  What we did observe is that women with marginal ketones seemed to be more susceptible to pre-menstrual cravings (which of course nuked their ketones).  Perhaps your blog reader might want to objectively test her ketones as you did. It might be instructive to see if her daily average blood ketones through her follicular phase is maintained above 1.0 mM but then falls below this threshold in the luteal phase despite maintaining the same diet.   I also said that it ""seems"" to be less effective.  Which doesn't mean that it is, simply that anecdotally it appears to be less effective for women than for men.  Cravings and caving to them also matter less when ketosis is not a goal and a major source of a lot of the dietary benefits.  This alone suggests that a propensity to give in to cravings is likely to be a cause of reduced success.  On /r/keto there are tons of anecdotes from women complaining that they aren't losing weight as fast as men, not consistently remaining in ketosis, battling cravings more often than men, or are less willing/able to give up certain foods.  If you don't believe these people, then we can agree to disagree.  I don't believe my point was intended to come across as ""evidence has shown that ketogenic diets are less effective for women, even if they stick to it perfectly,"" and I don't believe such a thing is a reasonable reading of what I said.  women are much more likely than men to have disordered eating.  I've already mentioned why this should be particularly problematic if ketosis is a goal, because not many people binge and purge on steak and avocados.  If you disagree with that point as well we can agree to disagree.  While fat mass is associated positively with testosterone in women, so is lean mass.  It may be the case that ordinary diets have comparable effects on men's and women's testosterone levels as ketogenic diets... Although if they did, my point would obviously not hold any water and I would concede it (hint: look it up and post it and I will give up at least that side of the argument, if such an argument against it exists).   If there's a study that shows that that this performance delta is higher under keto than with other diets, I'd like to see it.   I should thank you for asking for something that both of us knows doesn't exist and probably won't for a long time.  Most people can't even agree that there's data that shows keto diets are more effective for weight loss in men than ordinary diets.  That said, I do believe that I have justified what i said:   There is some, though most of it is anecdotal, and much of it is based off of design flaws."

That would be in line with my observation that men are less suited for conventional vegetarian or vegan diets and rely more on nutrients found in meat, eggs, and fish.   Some people do just fine with lots of carbs. Keto is still at least socially less than convenient, at least in America. If you are someone who can tolerate carbs, I don't really see a reason to keto.   I would argue with this. It could take a long time for health complications to develop on a high carbohydrate diet, so someone who seems to do fine might not actually be fine on them. Also, keto has desirable cognitive and disease prevention effects that are not achievable on other diets."

ketoscience,31vq01,causalcorrelation,7,Mon Apr 20 21:28:17 2015 UTC,"Not to jump on the bacon bandwagon (though I do love bacon), the issue here is that certain cured and processed meats are the last bastion of unsnobbish food in America.  Generally, you cannot say that a food is consumed by the poor in larger proportions than other foods.  In America, regardless of income, people consume foods and beverages across a wide spectrum of costs (meaning poor people still have steaks sometimes and rich people still eat potatoes from 50lb bags).  There are a few exceptions to this rule, and they mostly do not fall into their own food categories (only the wealthy consume truffles, artisan hams, and overripe cheeses).    The huge exception, of course, is processed and cured meats: who eats spam? Who eats any other meat from a can? The question is rhetorical.  We also know that people who consume these sorts of items have a tendency to not be the healthiest of people, and we can say that even if they didn't consume these foods that would probably still be true.  There are other confounders as well, such as the fact that ""cured and processed meats"" as a category tends to include foods like pizza, bratwurst, and McDonald's breakfast sandwiches - foods all notable for being associated with people who do not make wise health decisions (who eats pizza and bratwurst? Frat members. Who eats McDonald's breakfast sandwiches? Hungover frat members).  These sorts of studies are rife with confounders that are generally not included in the discussions.  A likely explanation for why the consumption of cured meats correlates with ill health is that people who eat lots cured meats are more likely to engage in and then conceal the fact that they engage in generally risky behavior."

This finding was in contrast with our starting hypothesis that bacon diets would promote carcinogenesis. Our hypothesis was based on epidemiological studies showing that intake of processed meat (mainly pork) is associated with risk. We also thought that nitrite and N-nitroso compounds found in bacon might increase carcinogenesis. However, bacon-fed rats drank more water than controls (Table 3), probably because bacon is salty. We thus propose the hypothesis that a high water intake, and not the bacon intake, can protect the rats against carcinogenesis."

Although collagen’s giant triple-helix proteins “denature” — which is to say break down — during cooking, we end up with plenty of the glycine, proline and other amino acids needed to manufacture our own collagen. Proline and glycine are the keys to tensile strength, resilience and water-holding capacity of healthy collagen.

This is crucial for survival to gain as much fat as possible while supply lasts. Because famine will come as your body thinks.  KD mimics starvation therefore fat is used while vital body functions and organs are being preserved. You feel alert and full of energy to gather food all day. You also optimize your sensitivity to leptin after a while on keto. It is released from fat cell telling you have enough energy stored thus no hunger.
ketoscience,3111ro,theSkynnyFatDude,8,Wed Apr 1 13:17:15 2015 UTC,"Every word you said is true except for your first statement. It is exactly because of the metabolic changes and hormonal changes in our bodies that you describe that allow weight loss to happen mentally, emotionally, and metabolically easier.  I also very much argue against the use of the word ""starvation"" and ""famine"" WRT ketosis. Plenty of primitive cultures ate a ketogenic diet even when their food was bountiful; they merely did not eat many carbs especially during the winter-time. To say that ketosis = starvation is oversimplifying. Just because you enter ketosis during starvation does not mean you are starving every time you are in ketosis!"
ketoscience,3111ro,Solieus,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:06:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, because of course the fact that ketosis mimics the effects of fasting cannot be equated with starvation. Fasting is controlled and short-term. Starvation can lack both traits. Keto is far more protective of muscles than either fasting or starvation: their similar, but only to a point."

ketoscience,3111ro,Ramboscie,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:11:41 2015 UTC,Yeah but does it make you sick to eat more. Because I think inducing hunger isn't likely necessary. It seems like a really weird thing to force yourself to get hungry like that. I don't think it's a good idea that's all. Especially since inducing a insulin spike before eating promotes fat storage.

At 12% body fat and a reasonable fast metabolism, a little extra fat's probably not gunna be an issue. Eating above 2450 cals of healthy whole foods every day is not easy at 61 yo unless i include a lot of oils and fats. The feeling is like the hunger i had prior to Keto. I have no issues fasting at anytime for 24 hrs, no hunger then, i do a fast once every 30days just to rest the digestive processes, feel good during and after the fast."

ketoscience,30xfkn,sugemchuge,5,Tue Mar 31 14:24:22 2015 UTC,Ketogenesis requires low enough levels of oxaloacetate in the liver for a buildup of a acetyl-CoA. Oxaloacetate is the limiting substrate for acetyl-CoA to enter the citrate cycle.  Getting into ketosis once ketoadapted happens the moment you deplete your oxaloacetate. Usually done by doing anaerobic exercise to increase demand for gluconeogenesis.

Not only did we evolve from apes, we are apes.   Yea? Do you think early man had plentiful access to these monstrosities? No but they had access to these monsters :   No they didn't. Early man evolved in Africa. There are no mammoths in Africa. By the time man left Africa, he was already anatomically modern, that is, not functionally different from you or me.   It is irrelevant what animals fruits they ate. It is relevant that in what proportions they ate.   No shit. You claimed carbs were scarce for early man. That's clearly not true. When Homo Sapiens evolved, in Africa, there were plenty of carbs.   In what part did you think I labeled sugar as a toxin? Toxicity is all about the amount. Any substance is toxic if you consume enough of it. Even water.   Here's what you said:   I too always find that body's reaction to alcohol and carbs similar.

Just because your body metabolizes alcohol and your body metabolizes sugar, does not mean there is any connection whatsoever. Your body also metabolizes fat. Does this mean fat is like alcohol too? It's a complete non-sequitur   I just thought and referred that there is a similarity in reaction of our body to alcohol and sugar.   The similarity is irrelevant, and your conclusion that ketosis is ""normal"" is false. Evidence: more people are not in ketosis than in ketosis. Therefore it is not normal. Unless you're using some other definition of normal I'm not familiar with.   Yes our body preferentially burns sugar(carbohydrates in general). But it also preferentially burns alcohol. What I mean is preferentially burning of things does not mean they are perfect for us. If you had to label some macro as perfect, you should label fat as perfect. (Because it results the lower methabolic inflamation)   It preferentially burns alcohol because it is a toxin. It preferentially burns carbs because they are our body's preferred source of energy; seeing as we evolved in a carb rich environment, that would make sense. Just because your body burns something for fuel does not mean it does it for the same reason or that there is any connection. For fuck's sake, your body also metabolizes fat for fuel, that doesn't mean fat is literally alcohol.  So to go back to this:   What I mean is preferentially burning of things does not mean they are perfect for us.   Just because your body preferentially burns something else also doesn't mean it is perfect for us. Just because carbs are burned before fat does not mean fat is better for us.

Books does not mean anything unless based on scientific data.  If you need a book then just read ""The Art and Science of Low Carboydrate living"" and ""The Art and Science of Low Carboydrate Performance"" by Stephen Phinney and Jeff Volek. It will open your mind about the ""Other Theory"" on obesity and diabetes.  Speaking of the ""Other Theory"" you should also read ""Good Calories Bad Calories"" by Gary Taubes on how we changed our macros in late 40 years, based upon nothing. I mean when USA government suggested low-fat diets, there were no scientific data on that issue. All ""scientific"" research came later after that dietary change happened. Please understand the fact that correlation does not mean causation which is the essence of low-fat promoting scientific papers. There are no randomized control trials that suggests low-fat diets are better than low-carb high-fat diets.   And again, toxicity is nothing to do with the substance itself. It is all about the amount of it. Anything could be a toxic if consumed in relatively large amounts. You drink 10 liters of water in 2 hours, you will most likely die due to dangerously low amounts of electrolytes.   And also know that, consumed in same amounts, sugar would be more toxic than fat. See this article and follow some research from that link : http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sugar-t.html?_r=0   Just because your body preferentially burns something else also doesn't mean it is perfect for us. Just because carbs are burned before fat does not mean fat is better for us.   Just what I said. I suggest not labeling any macro food as perfect. But if you strongly feel you have to, the safest macro is fat, based on numerous randomized control trials and evolutionary facts.  And I have asked about the scientific and conclusive evidence about your claim :   No shit. You claimed carbs were scarce for early man. That's clearly not true. When Homo Sapiens evolved, in Africa, there were plenty of carbs.   Please give your evidence on abundance of carbs in our evolutionary history. And please give your evidence that how much we preferred to eat them. There were plenty of mud in Africa too, should we deduce we preferred eating mud?

It's easy for anyone to go into or out of ketosis within 24 hours, just by controlling what they eat. Being keto-adapted and losing weight is another matter entirely."
ketoscience,30xfkn,DownhillYardSale,3,Tue Mar 31 20:06:08 2015 UTC,"Ketosis is 0.2 mmol/L of ketone concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood. That's it.  Ketosis around here is more of a perception that one is producing ketones, which is misleading because we always produce ketones, but in amounts that are unappreciable to what we're trying to do with greater concentrates of ketones in ketosis.  The term comes from one utilizing glucose as a primary fuel source over ketones and thus ""knocked out"". It's misleading because very few people know if they are in ketosis or not based upon their blood readings.  They just know eatings carbs is bad and assume they were kicked out of ketosis when the reality is they are saying ""I'm no longer producing ketones in a meaningful amount for my diet.""   Or in other words has it ever been proven that it is harder to get into ketosis that out of it?    Not physiologically. It requires no effort whatsoever to be in ketosis. Stop eating carbs. That is simple. Psychologically, however, we get into the difficulties of the diets or not. Your body will simply respond so judging that response on being ""harder"" or not can only be done in objective terms like:   how many kilojoules of energy are required to enter/exit ketosis consumption rates of food to initiate both etc etc   Shit we can't measure anyway.   Is it easier to bounce back from cheating if your ketone levels were previously high or do you have to start again from scratch?   It is easier the longer you go into fat adaptation because your body will have enough enzymes to process the fatty acids for oxidation. Over time the vast majority of your body will be using free fatty acids for fuel but until that happens it's primarily ketones and glucose. How long the adaptation takes is anyone's guess but from what I have read, if it took you 3 months to adapt to fat it will take 3 months of carb intake to reverse the enzymatic up/downregulation."

ketoscience,30xtu8,anbeav,3,Tue Mar 31 20:43:13 2015 UTC,"I am a tested Hashimotos sufferer. I definitely don't do well in deep ketosis for long periods of time - my weightloss can slow down to a crawl, even at a decent calorie deficit with exercise and full medication: or even with no calorie deficit and no exercise sigh. Its a PITA.  What has helped - my Dr suggested adrenal supplementation - its made a huge difference. Also taking maca helps.  But the thing which helps me the most is a carb refeed every weekend. I have discovered that I can go strictly with ketosis and right about the 6 week mark ie: full keto adaptation, my weightloss just basically stops. I stuck it out for two months, with almost no weightloss. Did a two day carb refeed and lost 3 kilos in the next week - more than in the previous month.  With a carb refeed every weekend the weight is coming off slowly, but it never stops. I've been in this current phase for almost four months and have been steadily getting lower.   I stick to 20 grams of carbs a day or lower.  But the thing is, I have a complex autoimmune endocrine disorder which went undiagnosed for 12 years. ALL of my hormones were out of whack by the time I was diagnosed and its taken me eight years to get back up to this point.  Some people with diagnosed hypothyroidism do extremely well in permanent deep ketosis. Some people can even come off their meds. And some people, like me, find that being in ketosis for too long can set them back - even with enough calories....  But you can't do any of this without a full blood workup and a good doctor. You can't guess if its thyroid. It might be your iron levels. Or progesterone. Or testosterone. Or adrenals.   You have to have all that complex hormonal stuff completely pegged by blood tests before you can start tweaking your diet.  It has taken me months and months of tracking my diet and paying attention to what's going on to work out what works for me. I spent most of last year stalling, trying desperately to work out why I wasn't losing weight.  This goes against some of what is said about ketosis in scientific circles, but the thing is, people like me don't get used for studies :) In the end you have to do an N=1 observational study and find a good doctor. But you cannot guess your thyroid symptoms.  I found this book to be the most comprehensive in terms of describing all the complex ways in which your thyroid doesn't work. If you have a slight problem with your Free T3 levels, taking medication may be the worst thing you can do.... Similarly you have to be really careful supplementing with iodine unless you also supplement with selenium - and excess iodine can cause symptoms like both hyper- and hypo- thyroidism....  Mary Shomon's About Thyroid page has a list of thyroid-friendly doctors. Its a good place to start :)"
ketoscience,30xtu8,anbeav,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:36:16 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for all of your information. I'll check out the book and perhaps that Thyroid page. Blessings on your keto path! I plan to see my doc if these sxs don't disappear. I have felt better with a slight increase in carbs which I really don't want to do. Thanks so much.

I would stop the salt substitute and get some lab work and possibly an EKG done to see where you are.

So basically: do the carbs from 0 GI foods count towards carb count or not and are 0 GI foods important for keto?   They count. Eat too many carbs whether 0 GI or not and you will exit ketosis"

ketoscience,30ptot,russdr,2,Mon Mar 30 22:59:26 2015 UTC,"From what I'm understanding, when a cow is calving and lactation begins, the cow doesn't take in enough DMI (dry matter intake) to support the changes, therefore glucose stores run out quicker and so begins ketosis.  I don't think the rumen protected choline prevents ketosis as much as it prolongs the initiation of it until the cow begins to intake more DMI.  The choline helps in VLDL synthesis, which transports the accumulated fat out of the liver.  Fat accumulation in the liver, in short, leads to ketosis.  Ketosis leads to lower milk production while the cow is going through metabolic changes.  I believe the choline only supports milk production during the calving transition until the cow can increase it's food intake.  That's kind of what I got from it.  Let me know what you think."
ketoscience,30ptot,TwinEclipse,2,Sun Mar 29 20:58:04 2015 UTC,"I used to take choline extract from fish when supplementing with notropic stacks. It didn't affect ketosis as far as I can observe. I don't see how choline inhibits ketosis..choline is a precursor for Ach in the brain's transmitters. Without it, the insulation will degrade and may affect the action potential of synaptic transmittion. If you eat plenty of fish/eggs, you probably Ingest more than 600mg choline. :) I also like taking sunflower letchin (non gmo)"

There are of course examples where lab animals do not metabolize substances like humans eg theobromine, surface area calc for Rat would suggest human LD50 of approx 200 mg/kg where we are around 1000 mg/kg. Also cats and dogs are bad at metabolizing theobromine compared to rats and far worse than us. Always take body surface calculations with a grain of salt..."

This leaves the consumed glucose in the patients blood circulation rather than being utilized by the cells for energy . Since the cells cannot uptake the circulating glucose the diabetic person must either get energy from other energy source like fat or be forced to supplement with pharmaceutical insulin . This is why untreated type two diabetes will have high blood sugar and sometimes they will have so much they surpass the threshold levels of their kidneys and secrete glucose in their urine excrement , which can increase the chance of a yeast infection."

ketoscience,30ddag,netbacon,3,Thu Mar 26 19:03:42 2015 UTC,The dawn phenomenon has to do with your body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Your brain prepares your body to wake up by releasing cortisol and epinephrine. These hormones cause the liver to begin breaking down liver glycogen into glucose to provide the brain with early-morning energy. Your glucose will be high in the morning because of this.
ketoscience,30ddag,djemdeeema,2,Thu Mar 26 16:03:05 2015 UTC,There we have it. I was wide alert this morning too. Thank you ketosis. :)
ketoscience,30ddag,netbacon,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:02:24 2015 UTC,Aren't glycogen stores supposed to be depleted though on ketosis?
ketoscience,30ddag,djemdeeema,2,Wed Apr 1 16:33:19 2015 UTC,"You always have glycogen readily available. Your body is too smart not to have a ""rainy day fund"" of glucose when needed. Your body starts producing ketones when it senses that your liver glycogen is not filled up. It's like a red flag saying ""hey we are running low on fuel, start the backup generators!"" Thus your body begins using its fat stores for energy and saving glucose for the really important stuff."
ketoscience,30ddag,MikePatton-yakyakyak,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:13:34 2015 UTC,"Ahh, OK. I had been under the impression once you were in ketosis the glycogen was gone and the only way of getting glucose left was dietary carbs and gluconeogenesis. I guess it makes sense that it wouldn't ALL be gone."
ketoscience,30ddag,theSkynnyFatDude,2,Wed Apr 1 18:23:28 2015 UTC,Gluconeogenesis can also refill glycogen supply if not all used. The trick is to keep glycogen stores as low as possible with a (debatable) short refill period every so often to help hormonal controls.

If you want to find that out get your desmosterol and lathosterol (cholestonol) analyzed.

Although we can hope that the diet was a more paleoesque ketogenic diet (food source is important), most medically prescribed keto diets are terrible.   In any case, the following made me rage a bit:   Selenium is an essential nutrient in the human diet. Sources of selenium include cereals, meats, and fish. However, depending on the intake of those foods and the source of cereals (e.g., soil rich or poor in selenium), selenium levels in humans are variable. Patients on the ketogenic diet have little cereal intake, and only moderate fish and meat intake, and thus are predisposed to low selenium levels.   Da fuq? Moderate fish and meat intake on a ketogenic diet? 6oz of pork or beef will give 100% DV. 2oz of salmon will give almost 100% DV. The authors give no indications as to what the kids were eating, but they jump to these kinds of conclusions..."

Thanks for reading this peer reviewed journal aricle.  Reviewers of anything new hit it with everything they can imagine. I think I see this in many of the pediatric studies. And you're right. This is only 2 patients and their review.  I did some further reading and found that prolonged Q-T syndromes can happen with anorexia nervosa which is similar in electrolyte imbalances as ketoers. But I think you have to have at least some shred of the genetic defect toward prolonged Q-T syndrome to result in the problem.  Many people are using this diet for their kids for epilepsy. And many doctors try to discourage parents from this practice. But I saw a you tube case of an infant with intractable seizures whose parents went to John Hopkins which treated it as an emergent disease. They used ketogenic diet for epilepsy and the child today is seizure free! It is quite profound in children when it works.  I read a lot and come here to check anyone else's reading or knowledge on these subjects. Maybe I read too much.  Anyhow, thanks so much for reading and replying.

ketoscience,30aqc0,parco-molo,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:38:03 2015 UTC,Why is a high carb diet beneficial at hotter climates?
ketoscience,30aqc0,parco-molo,0,Fri Mar 27 01:33:23 2015 UTC,"Not in hotter climates per se but in Long-Term Heat Acclimated individuals. It's evolutionary defined. The migration of humans started from West Africa (equatorial climate) to colder climates. This was accompanied with change of the endemic food availability and physiological adaptations to metabolism of high fat low carb diets respectively a switch to fatty acid oxidation as dominant metabolic path. That switch was also conditioned by the need of maintaining thermohomeostasis and fatty acids as energy dense nutritional substrate in that process. A main factor in thermoregulation is Ca2+ entry in the cell. There are two distinct ways of Ca2+ - Receptor Operated Ca2+ Entry (ROCE) and Store Operated Ca2+ Entry (SOCE). The two human phenotypes by that criterion  are the high density ROCE/low density SOCE phenotype aka ""dark"" people (LTHA) and the high density SOCE/low density ROCE phenotype aka ""pale"" people (LTCA). They have differences in gene expression, Vit. D plasma concentrations, thyroid, leptin, insulin, noradrenaline, melanin, cortisol etc etc levels.  But back to your main question as I digressed and had written about that stuff here before.(You can Google it if interested. use my username as a keyword + the terms I mentioned). High Carb/Low Fat diet is less energy dense and the physiological genetic/hormonal setup fosters/facilitates inhibition of thermogenesis in the Long-Term Heat Acclimated phenotype while the opposite is valid for the LTCA (Long-Term Cold Acclimated) phenotype. Dunno if that didn't go too sciencey for a regular discussion but here is where I'll make an exit. If smtg from the above is not clear enough I could elaborate a bit."

But if  reading comprehension doesn't fail people and one can see the forest for the trees it becomes pretty clear that the diet is not the factor here as those countries use a rather conservative traditional HCLF diet which is not that exposed to westernization. The dominant factor ubiquitous for  all South Asian etc countries that experience a rampant spread of Diabetes is change in SES i.e. increase in the affluent and urbanized parts of the population (middle class), respectively a change in the long term acclimation pattern. The rates in Diabetes between the rural impoverished areas and the well-to-do urban parts are drastically different. My pleasure."

Idk why any of this heat business is relevant, other than that fatty animals are more common in colder areas. Can you provide any evidence of said ""physiological adaptation"" to eat high carb?  The pseudo-scientific objections of keto and paleo fanboys aside, we can count on one hand the number of dietary adaptations that exist in some people and not others- lactose tolerance being the most widespread.

So far they have only measured the chemical outcome of the most effective cooking method for the least healthful of the 38 varieties. But that variety still produced a 10 to 12 percent reduction in calories. ""With the better kind, we expect to reduce the calories by as much as 50 to 60 percent,"" said James.     10-12% is the best actual result so far - RELEASE THE RISOTTO! So basically if you're able to replicate clinical results in your own kitchen, the best you can hope for is a ~10-12% reduction in carbs, in real terms this means your cup of rice goes from ~45g of carbs to ~41g of carbs. Whoop-de-doo. Their ""expectations"" are just a wild fantasy right now, and to go against the grain of what they predict, I tend to think the ""healthier"" kinds of rice will yield even further diminishing returns.    Oh and as for the main topic for the mainstream which is reduction of calories (which many of us don't give a shit about), but that's completely BS too - a cup of rice is 195g and 216 calories, adding 3% (5.85g) of 100% fat adds 53 calories, but the reduction of digestible calories from the rice has only been reduced by about 25 - so you're actually DOUBLING DOWN on calories in the opposite direction. Another fail.    Also note I think RS needs to be consumed at low temperatures after you've done the preparation (I'm no expert on the actual culinary side), which means if you like hot rice with your meals then this is possibly (again, no expert) all out the window, so get used to nice cold gluggy coconut tinged rice if that's your thing.    What a waste of time. Want to know the true secret to cutting all the carbs from rice? Put it in the bin, eat the fat instead."

ketoscience,3055y9,hastasiempre,9,Wed Mar 25 13:08:17 2015 UTC,"Now I'll give you one example why you disregard the NYT opinion feining scientific backup.  Low Protein Intake Is Associated with a Major Reduction in IGF-1, Cancer, and Overall Mortality in the 65 and Younger but Not Older Population Study cited.   On average, subjects consumed 1,823 calories, of which the majority came from carbohydrates (51%), followed by fat (33%) and protein (16%), with most of it (11%) derived from animal protein. The percent of calorie intake from protein was used to categorize subjects into a high protein group (20% or more of calories from proteins), a moderate protein group (10%– 19% of calories from proteins), and a low protein group (less than 10% of calories from proteins).   To call a spade a spade: This is High Carbohydrate Diet (we start by the dominant nutrient) with relative high-, medium- and low- protein content. Relative to what? If I give the scientists and the study the benefit of the doubt and accept that High Carbohydrate level was not increased, then it comes out that the  low protein increased the fat content. Although they don't say higher fat content compared to lower was connected with low mortality rates in people under 65, right?   Now, BOTH carbohydrates and protein drive insulin output respectively stimulate Ins/IGF-1 however to claim that protein content is the main major and determinative driver in that race one should be an idiot, not a scientist. That study presents a skewed and kinky twist on metabolic signaling paths with a pseudo-scientific agenda. What I can agree with is pretty simple and basic - an increase in activation of Ins/IGF-1 leads to decreased lifespan."

ketoscience,301qr7,FelixTheInnovator,7,Mon Mar 23 19:51:38 2015 UTC,"Looking at the thread, I see that you have been pointed towards a review of the literature on the neuroprotective effects of ketosis. You should read the entirety of it, if you haven't already. It basically explains everything worth knowing about how ketosis helps with brain injuries and the like.  Some people think something is only proven when a double-blind, placebo-controlled study proves it. Disregard such idiots. You know the ketogenic diet helps you, and science sorta has ideas why that is. Yet due to there being nothing conclusive so far, you won't find doctors prescribing the diet for brain injuries.  As the article on the neuroprotective effects notes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1940242 ):  ""Although the mechanism whereby the ketogenic diet confers protection in these diverse injury models is not well understood, β-hydroxybutyrate could play a role. The ketone body would presumably serve as an alternative energy source to mitigate injury-induced ATP depletion. In fact, exogenous administration of β-hydroxybutyrate can reduce brain damage and improve neuronal function in models of brain hypoxia, anoxia, and ischemia (Cherian et al., 1994; Dardzinski et al., 2000; Suzuki et al., 2001, 2002; Smith et al., 2005). In addition, the other ketone bodies, acetoacetate and acetone, which are β-hydroxybutyrate metabolites and can also serve as alternative energy sources, have similar neuroprotective effects (Garcia and Massieu, 2001; Massieu et al., 2001, 2003; Noh et al., 2006). Interestingly, in rats receiving a ketogenic diet, neuronal uptake of β-hydroxybutyrate is increased after cortical impact injury in comparison with animals receiving a standard diet (Prins et al., 2004). Thus, the ketogenic diet may promote delivery of β-hydroxybutyrate to the brain.""  It may be worth trying to go deeper into ketosis in order to get that sweet BHB. This means going as low carb as possible, possibly consuming some amount of MCT fats, perhaps supplementing with vinegar or sodium acetate. All in order to increase your ketone levels and thus improve your brain function."
ketoscience,301qr7,callesen58,2,Mon Mar 23 20:27:44 2015 UTC,How does vinegar and sodium acetate help you get deeper into ketosis?
ketoscience,301qr7,-MOPPET-,3,Tue Mar 24 12:09:49 2015 UTC,"First off, sodium acetate is the salt of acetic acid and sodium. It's a partially neutralized form of acetic acid that's easier to ingest than vinegar.  The mechanism is elevation of AMPK. Acetate has to be acylated in order to be metabolized, and the reaction is as follows:  Acetate + CoA-SH + ATP -> Acetyl-CoA + H2O + AMP + 2 PPi  Reducing the ATP/AMP ratio leads to an increase in AMPK activity, which increases fat burning among other things. It's my personal belief that AMPK is the reason why a ketogenic diet is so healthy and effective for weight loss.  Furthermore, acetate in the liver gives a fast boost to acetyl-CoA levels. High acetyl-CoA leads to the formation of acetoacetyl-CoA, which is the substrate for ketogenesis."
ketoscience,301qr7,callesen58,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:15:09 2015 UTC,"So if I just take let's say 2 tbsp of vinegar daily, will that be enough to start experiencing this reaction?  Have you noticed it yourself?"
ketoscience,301qr7,-MOPPET-,2,Tue Mar 24 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"It depends on your size, obviously. The bigger you are the more you need to ingest. But yeah, if you ingest vinegar you will feel the effects of it. You should feel complete lack of hunger, increased thermogenesis and more energy.  Yeah, I have. But my throat really doesn't like vinegar, and I pretty much hate taste of it even dilute. For that reason I ordered 2.5 kg of sodium acetate last weekend."
ketoscience,301qr7,callesen58,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:27:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I'm not very big.  5'3 with 20 lbs to lose, but no matter how low I take my calories it's very hard for me not to gain on a standard diet.  On Keto I can keep my weight fairly level between 900 and 1500 kcal a day, but if I go above that I gain fairly quickly and below that I'm pretty much exhausted. It's too hard to do for more than a few days.  Maybe the vinegar will help.  What does the sodium acetate taste like?"
ketoscience,301qr7,-MOPPET-,3,Tue Mar 24 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"The vinegar should, if nothing else, help you with your energy levels.  Sodium acetate tastes like salt and vinegar chips. It is the flavor compound that gives them their taste."

ketoscience,301qr7,-MOPPET-,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:10:54 2015 UTC,One last question.  Does the vinegar lose any of its beneficial properties when emulsified with oil?  I like to make oil and vinegar salad dressings - I plan on just upping the vinegar to oil ratio and drenching my salads.  That should give me at least 2 tbsp. a day. But I mix my salad dressing with a hand blender so it does get very emulsified.  I just wonder if the oil bound to the vinegar buffers it and makes it less effective.
ketoscience,301qr7,-MOPPET-,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:32:24 2015 UTC,"Your digestive environment should break the emulsion pretty easily. Oil doesn't buffer the vinegar, but does reduce it's apparent acidity. Oil and vinegar dressings are a good way to get vinegar.  Anyway, my sodium acetate came yesterday. It is vinegar-y in taste and a bit salty. It works pretty good as a condiment, less good when added to water. Currently consuming it mixed with sugar-free soda pop, to which it lends itself quite well. It displaces the carbonic acid, rendering the taste pretty similar to the original taste. Just slightly more salty."

I'll definitely look more into that recommendation of going deeper into ketosis, I've been reading alot of literature about the sweet spot of nutritional ketosis so hearing this simply reinforces my ideas aswell. The problem I've encountered is that the micronutrients involved in keto friendly vegetables like spinach, broccoli, and cauliflower are also very beneficial.

The issue is that once you are metabolically deranged you can't hope to fix that problem by adopting a carb-rich diet from a population without said derangement.
