Merkel may not have made the right choices, but Greece has been given pathways out of the crisis and they seem to have chosen a path that continues along the road towards exit from the Euro zone. I don't think the result would've been different had Merkel taken a (subjectively) ""better"" approach.  I think the author of the article realizes this but still wants to lay blame on Merkel."
TrueTrueReddit,3c4zif,tyme,3,Sun Jul 5 02:04:02 2015 UTC,What pathway out is that exactly? The last five years of signing on the dotted line and accepting more and more austerity has pushed the Greek economy into a depression. The institutions with the backing of Germany are just offering more of this. The IMF itself has released reports admitting that they consistently overestimated the recovery of the Greek economy and that there is no way the Greek government will ever be able to repay its debts. Economists as prestigious as Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz have voiced their support of a 'No' vote.
TrueTrueReddit,3c4zif,shamankous,7,Sun Jul 5 15:56:26 2015 UTC,"All the blame on Greece? I'm not so sure about that, though they are certainly to blame for some of it. I'm of the mind that the ""solutions"" however, are pretty dark and won't help anything (austerity, basically, until the Greek people are truly finished)."
TrueTrueReddit,3c4zif,The_Thresh_Prince,4,Sun Jul 5 07:51:35 2015 UTC,"Who else is there to blame? Greece is grossly insolvent, and has taken  none of the requisite steps to remedy their situation.  Greece needs austerity, you can't correct years of gross deficits with a few years of relative 'balance', it will require an equal and opposite period of austerity to bring the Debt Service ratio back to manageable levels.   Tax reform is also a must for Greece, however it would surely be political suicide.  This is one of those situations that truly highlights 'capitalism' vs.  'democracy' as we know it.   IMO, only two things are certain: A conversion to the Drachma would be catastrophic for the average Greek citizen, and the EuroZone is done subsidizing a lifestyle that the Greek people simply can not afford."
TrueTrueReddit,3c4zif,shamankous,8,Sun Jul 5 09:02:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, capitalism vs democracy. I agree. Do we really want democracy to lose out?  Is austerity the only way? Surely some tax restructuring and other methods are needed, but (and I'm no economist, though I read a few of their blogs) most people are saying that pure austerity is not the route forward and won't do anything to help the debt situation. You're basically making the Greeks suffer for no gain. I would say that anyone trying to force austerity (as well as those trying to keep even minor inflation away from the Euro... the ECB then) is to blame for this, for it's not meant to solve the problem.   So here is some more reading, lite, on the matter  Something about the whole idea of Euro  The euro itself might not be sustainable if this is what it does to Greece.

TrueTrueReddit,3c4zif,mconeone,3,Sun Jul 5 18:16:34 2015 UTC,"Tax reform is also a must for Greece, however it would surely be political suicide.   Tax reform can mean many things. To the troika tax reform means raising VAT. To the Greek government tax reform means creating an independent tax authority and hiring more tax collectors. Given that much of the country is struggling with poverty and that most tax revenue goes uncollected. The latter approach seems as sensible as the former seems insane.  This is emblematic of how these 'negotiations' have proceeded. The European institutions are unwilling to consider anything other than austerity despite the overwhelming evidence that it does not help either the Greeks or their government's creditors."

It sounds like most of the people, if they had received adequate treatment, would have never been in that situation to begin with.  2) Loose gun control regulations.

Just how low does that number need to get before it is entirely acceptable for that percentage of people to feel forced into prostitution for lack of options?   I'm one of those who do think trafficking stats are politicized charity campaigns and exaggerated, but I will go further than the above statement:  What if basic income prevents just 1 trafficking incident.  That is still a great outcome.  We don't need to argue how much money I should give to your charity or what draconian laws against prostitutes or their customers need to be imposed.

That is less draconian than prohibition which is the most common.  I'm not sure that being monitored is a great thing.  If some of they and their customers prefer being monitored for some reason, then they can be.  Regulated, some customers would like, and communities would prefer that no solicitations take place in school yards, and such.

The point is to create a floor to create opportunity equally. It's not about guaranteeing outcomes.   ""There is then the important issue of security, of protection against risks common to all, where government can often either reduce these risks or assist people to provide against them. Here, however, an important distinction has to be drawn between two conceptions of security: a limited security which can be achieved for all and which is, therefore, no privilege, and absolute security, which in a free society cannot be achieved for all. The first of these is security against severe physical privation, the assurance of a given minimum of sustenance for all; and the second is the assurance of a given standard of life."" - F.A.Hayek  Basic income does not mean everyone earns the same amount of money.

TrueTrueReddit,3azo80,dirtymick,3,Wed Jun 24 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"Let's talk more about talking. Talk, talk, talk.  Everyone seems convinced that there's some magical conversation to be had, and then we can all be finally free of the racism that lurks in all of us. But no one seems to know what that conversation would sound like. One thing I think we need to drop from these little chats is the prevailing focus on institutions and ad hoc programs of the past. While valuable in a historical/contextual sense, they present 2 problems:  1) Most of the programs, etc. named have been long abolished, and history seems to move at such a rapid pace that the best reaction you can get name-checking the past is white America giving a collective shrug; ""Wasn't me."" I hold the same amount and quality of detached empathy for victims of lynching as I do for victims of iceberg collisions. I know that (usually older generation) black America wants white folks to understand their pain, but they can't. Even those with ties to racism against their own ethnic group (ex. no Irish need apply) are so far removed from such overt hatred that it barely registers.  2) None of these talks get to the heart of the matter: We all harbor an innate fear of the other. Institutional racism is real and rampant, but scrapping institutions doesn't even come close to addressing that fear we all share. Making hate illegal just drives it further underground, where it can fester and learn to express itself in increasingly creative, legal-ish ways.   Deal with hate/racism/phobias where they really reside, in the human breast. Everything else is just pissing in the wind."

Tons of studies have shown how empathy is switched off when facing opposition, especially among males.  Tribalism was destroyed in developped countries with massive and brutal social engineering and acculturation. In France, local languages were forbidden at school. History books said that we were all from the Gauls and praised the dynasties of kings that lead to the unified nation. All was made to destroy tribal regional identities. Blind nationalism is the only way to put humans in a mindset where their social inclusion extends to the borders of the nation.  All Us vs Them scenarios lead to a dead end. Especially in an era where white middle class and lower class economic situation is worsening and they hear the aristocrats of the media telling them that they should shut up because of priviledge. White middle and lower class are already in a state of switched off empathy.  There is no better way to sustain or even increase hatred. Justice seeking is not how human societies end century old struggles. All you get is people saying ""anti-racism is anti-white"".  You really want to end racism ?

What does seem to be irrelevant is the existence of slavery 100 years prior to the civil rights movement.  Why have the markers for a poor upbringing gone up in the last 50 years?  Single motherhood, higher gang-related violence, drug use - are those all just 'because slavery'?  The effects of slavery have gotten worse the farther away it becomes? Isn't it much more likely that the absenteeism of fathers is the culprit, since there seems to be a much stronger correlation of these behaviors with that factor alone?"

If we were having an honest discussion around discrimination throughout history, it might make sense to touch on both. But that's not what happens. People force the issue in Reddit threads in order to further the myth of white supremacy -- to explicitly imply that Irish people ""got over it"" and succeeded, therefore black people are the cause of their own problems.  And I really think you're belittling the far-reaching the implications of human slavery here. Slavery is a big deal, and 100 years is a drop in the bucket of human history -- these things don't just go away in a generation. There's so much more to it, though.

I absolutely agree that people should be donating to fight malaria rather than a breast cancer charity that wastes 90% of the money.  Having said that, I do think the entire discussion starts with a somewhat limited philosophical lens. It's all about lives, and saving them. But, hard as it sounds (and as easy for me to say as a privileged American), lives are cheap. We could create a couple billion more in 9 months if we wanted to.  The argument presupposes that the general structure of the world is fine. I'll give an example: I donate to a non-profit that helps communities prevent sprawling development that weakens their overall economic solubility. You may not agree with me that this is a major problem. But maybe it's clear how someone that does believe this thinks that such a donation has great leverage in making the U.S. a better place in the long run; this is hard to put a value on (although studies suggest we waste untold billions this way, which I suppose could be used to fight malaria).  Another issue is what is the long term plan for our species. Is our goal to sustain 7 billion people? Can I do the most good just by not creating a child, or by donating to advance women's rights, which correlates to decreased child birth?  Another example: the subject's non-profit that offers career advice suggests that various types of finance and hedge fund work is totally great so long as you like, totally promise to give away a lot of the money. But I think that this is an overrepresented field that sucks up smart people while creating no true value; that it is part of the problem with the world (the subject says that this is a good idea because the other guy that gets the job wouldn't give; this to me sounds like buying a used Hummer in an attempt to drive it fewer miles than it would otherwise be driven. I'm dubious.)  I think there's valuable information here, for sure, but I don't think it comes near solving the ""problem"" of giving."

I'm not saying that you should change your donation because those two things are VERY helpful to the environment but I feel like we shouldn't be hurting other humans in the process.

It doesn't matter if you have a million hardcore conservationists out there, they will still take more from the world than they provide. The only way humanity can restore the planet to proper order is to cease to exist.    Some people are barely surviving as it is and I doubt that they're causing a negative effect on the environment.   Like, what, starving Africans? North Koreans? Amazonian rain forest dwellers? People who barely survive have awful impacts on the planet. They kill without mercy or thought, and appropriate any and every resource they can find to serve their own needs. And for most of them, their inability to survive is tied directly to their ancestors consuming every resource that was available. Humanity has killed staggering amounts of wildlife, polluted the air and ground, fished the oceans bare, caused desertification the world over, dried up riverbeds, clear-cut forests, thinned the ozone and melted the polar ice caps, and we are all responsible for that, from Native American hunter gatherers to medieval Europeans to the Ancient Egyptians and everyone that has come before and after.

I just upvoted you to make sure that you don't leave with negative karma because honestly you do make good points.  Native Americans I feel don't do any of that and are the most resourceful when it comes to environmental protection. They don't kill without thought and only kill in order to survive. I'm not researched enough per se to talk about starving Africans, North Korean citizens, or Rain forest dwellers so I can't say about them but they are suffering.  I feel like humans aren't the problem but the ones who try to get more and more are. There are many, many innocent humans out there compared to the ones who actively destroy the environment for self-gain. I actually do support but slightly disagree with your viewpoints because other animals do survive in similar fashions. Humans do have one difference in which we are intelligent (not sure if that's the right word) to have obvious and strong emotions.  Humans can do a ton of good and without their own support then I feel like the ones who still do bad will continue to be in power."

We're a declining empire where the dynamic has developed, according to Adam Curtis,  that ""In the past our politicians offered us dreams of a better world.

To be functional, our war-based economy needs an enemy, so now that the USSR is long gone, we create enemies -- either by provoking Russia or China, or by arming and training Muslim fundamentalists who we then decry as ""terrorists"" and then attack.  Former US ambassador to the USSR and State Dept. strategist George F. Kennan's 1950s-era Cold War prediction has come true:  ""Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial establishment would have to go on, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented.

We seized 1/2 of Mexico in a war of aggression in the 1840s. We've been at war for more years of our country's history than we've been at peace.  Our standard line of being a peace-loving nation is simply nationalistic propaganda.   It's what we can expect to return to when the system can no longer sustain itself.   We're fast approaching that date. I hope the economic collapse of capitalism is such that we reinvent locally-based, democratic economics on some sustainable level.   but to assume that what follows it will be any better would be naive.   Speculation, sure, but I think it will be a more democratic and egalitarian system than we have now.

Let me be clear, I think anti-vaxxers are very stupid and dangerous. I think their behavior might end up possibly killing a few people. But I have a very serious problem with giving the government (or any group of people) the authority to force someone to do something to their body that they don't want to do. You want to skip vaccines and roll the dice with disease, go for it.   I know there are counter-arguments. ""But its the children's' bodies, the children are in danger, not the parents who are making this bad decision. We need to do it to protect the children!"" I hear that argument from both major sides of the political  spectrum and, while noble, the reality is that the children are not your children. You do not get a say.   ""Its not about their bodes, its about building herd immunity! Them not doing it is a danger to the rest of us!"" I'm not arguing this point, as I agree with the logic. But unfortunately we don't get to dictate what others do with their lives. Some people make very poor decisions. All we can do is educate and protect ourselves as best we can.   Believe me, I would like nothing better for anti-vaxxers to get their kids vaccinated, but I feel the same way about fundamentalist religious groups raising more fundamentalists.

However, as a counterpoint: We generally agree that parenting is something that should be left up to parents. But we already have laws in place to prevent specific parenting fuck-ups. Outright child abuse, obviously, but you're required to make sure your kids get some kind of an education. You're also required to take them to the doctor if they get sick. Now, mandating vaccinations is just another specific point the government would be intervening in the parent-child relationship, and one could argue that it is covered under the ""must take care of your kid when they're sick"" part, which is really just saying you can't neglect your child's health. So opposing that particular bit isn't objectively right or wrong, but there's already the libertarian proverbial ""gun pointed at their heads"" to make sure parents already do some stuff for their kids, why not vaccines also?  This of course ignores everyone else's interest in making sure kids are vaccinated, since just vaccinating alone isn't 100% effective in preventing eg measles, you also need an overwhelming percentage of the population to vaccinate as well."
TrueTrueReddit,38vgsn,NoMoreNicksLeft,-7,Sun Jun 7 22:29:48 2015 UTC,I have a very serious problem with giving the government (or any group of people) the authority to force someone to do something to their body that they don't want to do.   So what is this problem?

TrueTrueReddit,38vgsn,NoMoreNicksLeft,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:01:08 2015 UTC,You may find this article relevant: The Science of Why We Don't Believe Science  IMO the act of convincing someone is an emotional endeavor rather than an intellectual one; what stymies the attempt to convince anti-vaxxers is often less a lack of intellectual ability on their part than a lack of empathetic ability on ours.

I don't need to convince people that wearing their seatbelt is safe, I just need to enforce it (points on license, etc.).   Not allowing unvaccinated children into schooling is a step in the right direction.   Making it a misdemeanor offense could also be one.   It's harsh, but indirectly endangering other people, primarily infants who have not been vaccinated yet, deserves a harsh stance."
TrueTrueReddit,38vgsn,jplindstrom,2,Sun Jun 7 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"By and large this is exactly what's being done -- not to the point of criminalizing or fining parents, of course, but various types of regulation.   The big reasons why it won't get to the point of fines:  1) There are a large number of reasons why a child would, legitimately, not be up to date on his or her vaccinations. Evaluating the validity here requires a medical professional, and in many cases -- vaccinations are just one of them -- it's hard to accept a landscape where the child's doctor's opinion gets supplanted by a bureaucrat.   2) The people (in So. Cal. at least) who are anti-vaxxers are also, by and large, politically enfranchised."

TrueTrueReddit,38vgsn,Iskandar11,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:36:15 2015 UTC,"Most states don't allow them in school unless you can prove you are a regular, committed member of a religion such as Christian Scientist. Given that the number of such is low, it makes no real impact.  States like California, which just changed their law, allowed anyone to opt out based on ""conscientious objection"" which is bogus.  States that allow that have problems.  States that don't, don't have problems."

TrueTrueReddit,38vgsn,kriffin,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:29:41 2015 UTC,"Seatbelt doesn't just save the life of the person driving / passengers, it also keeps them safe enough to react and not endanger more people."
TrueTrueReddit,38vgsn,NoMoreNicksLeft,-3,Sun Jun 7 16:35:16 2015 UTC,"This is false. Any time you would have been injured by the incident if you weren't wearing a seatbelt, the car's already uncontrollable. If you're thrown through the windshield, for instance, the impact has already occurred. Same if your head is smashed into the steering wheel.  And on top of that, this is only an excuse for the driver, not passengers.  What this is really about is that you're a control freak."
