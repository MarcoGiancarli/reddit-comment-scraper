Eating a junk-free diet and getting enough sleep will help your body feel its best, which will make you feel calmer and sharper and more capable of giving positive energy to your Neighborhood."

It has helped to remember that emotional health relies on me taking care of me, and if I can't be emotionally healthy, I can't be there for anyone else, either. I have realized lately that people just expect that I'll help them because I always have, and I have neglected myself and kinda ""trained"" other people to disregard my needs as well. Thank you for this reminder. <3"
TheChurchOfRogers,3dkaki,throwawaypussies,10,Thu Jul 16 23:21:32 2015 UTC,"You're eventually going to need to talk to him about it, I won't say you'll need to ""confront"" him in the spirit of the sub. But one way or another this will come up, and it will either be in some high-tension boiling over/breaking point fashion where neither side will be able to get what they want out of the conversation or you can proactively approach this and choose the context and setting you want this conversation to occur in. It will probably be tough, and awkward, and uncomfortable, I wish I had advice for how to make it not that way. Just keep in mind what your goal in the conversation is, and keep in mind that your brother likely doesn't want to face that his actions have had negative repercussions for you, and to avoid feeling guilty he may try to displace/project in ways that are hurtful or seem callous.   I can't promise anything but it seems likely that getting this out in the open on your own terms will be better than waiting for this to build into something worse. Certainly the best case outcome of understanding and reconciliation can only come through that course of action."
TheChurchOfRogers,3dkaki,ryegye24,5,Thu Jul 16 23:49:20 2015 UTC,"First off, go see if /r/raisedbynarcissists rings any bells. If your brother is the spitting image, you may not be able to fix the relationship, and your focus should be on preventing him from damaging your other relationships.   Second, remain calm in the knowledge that he will burn all of his bridges eventually. In the meantime you need to survive until you're not living under the same roof.  Strategy for becoming unquestionable:   Lock down security. Put passwords on things and make sure he can't find out information about you that he can use against you. Do not deny access to your parents, and if they express concern about this, reference your brother's attempts to undermine you.  Clean your life up completely. If you are hiding things from your parents, hide them outside of your house. When he accuses you of something, object, point out his history of accusing you to deflect, as in ""Remember when he accused me of using pills, and instead he was selling pills at school?"" and then allow full access to demonstrate innocence. When you've demonstrated innocence, say something like ""I hope you're beginning to see what's going on here. This is very difficult to put up with, and i would hope you're learning go trust me a little.""    This will establish a pattern. Your mood and level of agitation during this whole process is key. Effective moods you can combine:  calm: ""I'm really sorry he keeps doing this, but eventually you're going to have to start trusting me""   moderately irritated: ""ah, Jesus. Again?""   amused: ""Ha, really? Sounds like he's projecting again like with the pills.""  taken aback: ""He said what? Wait...  You don't think this is like the pills thing again, do you? You can go through my drawers if you feel the need to. Wow.""   disinterested: ""Huh. That's a weird thing to say.""  over it: ""Ugh, really? I don't even know anymore.""  You have to remain calm. Once you establish a pattern of trust with your parents, you can say to anyone, ""No, he does this all the time. Call my mom and ask her. Here, let me give you her number."" All those approaches will help you with new people too.  If he's agitated and lying, and you're calm and telling the truth, you will win eventually, I promise. You will have some bad days, but just keep it together, and it will turn out.   Check out /r/socialengineering, but don't let him see you reading it."

TheChurchOfRogers,3dkaki,XPostLinker,2,Thu Jul 16 23:23:38 2015 UTC,"well, your brother is obviously deflecting, however he's doing it because he doesn't know how to face what he's done himself. it seems to me that he most likely is not able to face this which is something a therapist should talk to him about if he's able to go to one. if you want to confront him, then you need to do it with your mother so he can't change the story.   as for what you should do, you can always try to distance yourself, however he is family and it will be difficult, do try to do everything you can to preserve the relationship before you take any steps towards a burnt bridge."
TheChurchOfRogers,3ddf3t,sfrasermait,15,Wed Jul 15 12:01:43 2015 UTC,"When i look at things I tend to wonder why someone acts the way they do. I to was recently let go, however it was a huge reduction in work force, not a single just firing of me. I had to look at what they wanted to accomplish and why they chose to do this. Because I have no way to fix it, I don't see the point in wallowing in it or wondering how else it could have been solved. Holding onto that hate won't solve anything, it will just make you more and more resentful. In the famous words of Disney creators... Let it go. Prove to yourself that you can be amazing in your next job and live a great life!  As for the people who are loud and rude at school, particularly  rude to those of not the same color of skin, remember that they are people to, and if they are in school they are most likely young and impressionable. You can't change people, however you can change how you look at them. Everyone has something to offer the world, perhaps try to look for the good they do, or good things they say and see what they offer. People aren't rude usually for no reason, their's a reason they're rude, you might just not see it yet.   I personally believe that empathy is how we save this world when it's paired with compassion. Understanding someone's plight and having the desire to help them or make them feel simply better for a little bit can go a long way to showing them that not only do you care about them, but you are wanting what's best for them.  As for the rude person at work, there's again nothing you can do to change that. Some people just don't want to get to know you or care about you, however that's fine, not everyone is going to like you and it's okay. However, over time with you showing people how awesome you are by being the great person you are to everyone you see, they will eventually understand why you are this way and possibly change their mind about you. Perhaps they're scared about getting to know new people, perhaps they grew up and had a hard life and are just extremely guarded and standoffish. Who knows, but it will be okay.  Remember empathy and compassion go a long way to understanding people and allowing them to see the good in you, which could change how they see everyone."

TheChurchOfRogers,3ddf3t,greebytime,2,Thu Jul 16 04:02:15 2015 UTC,"I can relate a personal experience - I was laid off by a boss who had only recently joined the company. I was SO DAMN MAD at him because it was clearly personal ... we had clashed a few times, but I was a far superior producer at my job than several of my peers. (Objectively and subjectively.) I was talking with another friend and for awhile we were really going off about how little he knew, how in over his head was, how petty and cruel he was ... and then, sort of out of the blue, she said:   Can you imagine how scared he is every day at work, wondering if that's the day people will finally realize he's a fraud?   She didn't mean it considerately, she was still goofing around. But when I thought about it...I mean, that's a fear we all have in some parts of our life. And it humanized this guy for me in a way that I hadn't been willing to allow originally.   I'm not going to say I'd go out of my way to help this guy, but I don't feel hate towards him because I finally figured out how to put myself in his shoes for a moment.  TL;DR - try to see the world from their perspective, and from their insecurities and fears. It humanizes them and makes them feel more like real people."
TheChurchOfRogers,3ddf3t,ristoril,2,Wed Jul 15 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry I'm late I meant to type this yesterday but what I have done with neighbors who might be described by others as ""difficult"" is to just speak to them gently (without being patronizing or anything) and with understanding.  ""Understanding"" for me means that I try to understand the meaning of what they're saying and how they're saying it.  Typically people who ""speak hatefully"" are trying to express some combination of opinion and emotion and thoughts etc.  They're having a hard time communicating those things in a way that is neighborly.  In my experience if you listen without attempting to map any extra meaning to what people say, you can come to understand what they're trying to express.  Once you've achieved that understanding you can attempt to rephrase their concerns in a more neighborly way.  If you're successful you will make whatever situation you're in better for everyone.  If you succeed with this repeatedly you can actually help your neighbors develop more productive methods of communicating their thoughts/feelings/etc."

Edit: also, to be fair, you are receiving some outside recognition from your friends and family. Don't downplay their support, not everyone is so lucky as to have that. Even if you aren't sure that their being proud of you is ""the right thing"", trust that they know it is right to be proud of you and continue to encourage you."

Your edit put me in mind of something I realized. When someone compliments me - ""You look really pretty today"" - my instinct is to negate it - ""Not really, my hair's a mess and I didn't do my makeup."" It only recently occurred to me that I'm not only forcing myself not to feel good about something that I SHOULD feel good about, but that I was also unfairly robbing that person - who had taken time and energy to try to make me feel good about myself - of the satisfaction of having helped me. Not only that, but I was effectively telling them, ""You're wrong, you don't know what you're talking about."" I was refusing to take their compliment and was instead returning it with an insult.  All this to say that I think you're right. If my family and friends are kind enough to believe in me and tell me so, it's not my place to tell them they shouldn't."
TheChurchOfRogers,3db26n,Poot_Tweet,5,Wed Jul 15 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"You're not a failure. You're an artist, and art is really hard to get paid for. The vast majority of actors, writers, painters, musicians, dancers, etc either live with someone who helps support them or have a day job or both. Acting adds an extra level of difficulty because you're working with other artists, and just like watching a movie made from a book you love is sometimes hard to enjoy even when the movie is well done if it doesn't match the way you imagined it, just because you personally are a good actor doesn't mean you'll get the part. The director was really looking for someone with greener eyes or longer fingers or who talks like their sister-in-law. Or whatever.   A friend of mine is a character actress who does a lot of theater too. I met her at work: for me, my career; for her, a day job. She still works part-time at the day job, but just now, in her late fifties, after thirty years of acting, she's getting enough work to consider doing it full-time. Part of it, honestly, is that she's done it so hard for so long that she has a ton of connections and recognition in her town's theater world now. It's not that she's getting jobs from her friends: it's that when they're casting the villain they think of her performance in that other thing, and stuff like that. Be patient with yourself."

You are moving forward, hopefully learning from each audition and experience. Sometimes an experience teaches us what we don't want to do, but that is still useful information. Sometimes it reconfirms our dream and helps us with our determination. Whatever the result, we can learn and grow.  Also, I read that you tell yourself you're not wasting your life. First, that sounds like you have a presupposition that you are wasting your life. Second, do you believe what you are saying? Does the definition of who you are, inside your mind and heart, include making something of your life through acting and theatre? In my own life, I discovered that even while working towards a major goal, I was thinking inside a box that excluded succeeding in that goal. I needed to expand my defining box. This might not be your situation; I share my experience in case it's helpful.  Best of luck to you as you continue to audition!"

He was a student and a purveyor of his faith which equates to a strong relationship with Christ.   Your statement was, ""my favorite thing in the world to think about is Mr Rogers kicking Jesus's ass"".  I need not present credentials to have it understood that this is a disrespectful and inappropriate comment, especially in the environment into which is was delivered.

TheChurchOfRogers,3czgvy,jeffwm,9,Sun Jul 12 04:41:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think these things are all negative all the time.  Anger gives us ambition and drive to succeed, loneliness motivates us to seek companionship. We become lonely because humans are social creatures, we are not built to live solitary lives.    Focusing exclusively on and being content with what we have is again likely to bring about complacently. I think this is why we look for and try to rectify problems. Often focusing on problems in our lives can cause pain but this pain is a necessary part of improving ourselves. Otherwise we stagnate emotionally, educationally, etc.   Happiness is complicated and hard to really define I think. I'm not sure exactly what desires you are referring to that remove happiness.  In access all of these attributes (loneliness, anger, desire, negativity) are crippling but in appropriate doses I believe they are invaluable tools for self improvement.   Finally, I like to think MOST people are empathetic and do not take pleasure in the pain of others. There are however several well researched psychological and sociological theories for why people in certain situations are willing to be complicit in or enjoy inflicting pain. I can provide some of these studies if you're interested."
TheChurchOfRogers,3czgvy,agentdatta,5,Sun Jul 12 06:05:52 2015 UTC,"Since you're posting in this sub, I guess you wish to hear what Mr. Rogers would say. I wish he were here to answer you and I could watch his replies. Maybe he's partially addressed some of these questions in his show, designed in a way kids could understand. I sincerely hope that someone comes along to this thread to give a try at summing up things in the style that Fred would have done or even link to some relevant tidbits of his show.     At the moment, the above is not posted, and I'm not confident I can do justice to that approach, but these questions are near and dear to my heart, so I will say some thoughts that come to my mind when I read your questions. I will state the obvious a lot, say wrong things, whatever, chat, sorry if what follows is painfully drafty.     Why are people so lonely?   The first thing I want to say is that people are not the only creatures that experience hardship when alone for a long time. Several species of social animals are known to self-harm when housed in isolation. People vary in the degree of social contact that we seek, but generally, we tend to feel happier when we are with people than when kept in isolation (enforced isolation is often considered torture or abuse). Some people live in social communities where private time is the rare commodity and people, people everywhere is the norm and there's little time for loneliness in the sense of a lack of people around us. However, those of us who are not in a close-knit neighborhood, where we finish our work and go to our homes and close the door, well, we may often feel lonely because we're not physically surrounded by people. A social structure that's a trifle weak on neighborly neighborhoods is a studied phenomenon, and relates to many things in our society, including the communication technology which actually makes it possible for us to be chatting (with people far away, even people we don't even know). Some scholars think that communications and internet make it easier for people to live solitary lives and make the lonely path more palatable. But this kind of loneliness isn't probably the issue of interest, but instead it's the existential loneliness of having trouble connecting with people who really get us, who are true friends who care not only about us as a person, but also think the way we do and say the things that make us feel acknowledged to our core. Getting that kind of affirmation from people requires sharing and getting to know you talks that go close to that core, so we can learn from each other and grow closer in that way. So avoiding loneliness takes time to talk and courage to do it. To peel the onion of our masks and bare some inner stuff.     Why are people so angry?      People vary in their anger. Some are very angry, some are less. Similarly for animals, there are differences in anger-like behavior that vary with heredity and environmental experiences, whether in development or recent stresses. So my understanding is that when people are angry a lot, it's perfectly reasonable to think that there's some complex combination of innate wiring, growing up issues, and problems in my life now. In some people close to me, mood disorders have played a significant role, and mood stabilizing medicines have played a significant role. In my experience, telling someone to chill out and not be angry is kind of like telling a depressed person to cheer up and not be sad, which, in turn, is somewhat like telling someone with liver cancer to step up and not be cancerey. It's not under voluntary control, and the factors to prevent angry outbursts are not instantly manipulatable. The techniques to teach emotional regulation work fairly well if exercised with dedication, but those who need it most also often have the least ability to exercise with dedication. Still, we must try to exercise, and help others to exercise.    Why is it so hard to ignore the things we are fortunate for?       Skipping this one, for now, though it's important. Gratitude is a saving grace.     Why do people desire things that do not cause themselves or happiness?      Desires come from brain functions, which emerge from essential innate combinations of wiring circuits (e.g. desire for caloric food, desire for warmth) or from learning and experience (e.g. desire for mom, desire for money). Our natural systems have an electrochemical foundation, and because they use certain molecular locks and keys, these machines are vulnerable to producing desires for drugs that hit these keys. Similarly, in our learned experience and our other desires, there are related things that can tickle the desire paths and thus grow into desires even though they are not life sustaining. There's no way to make a desire governing system that is perfect, there will always be errors. Systems can be self-correcting, but still, not perfectly self-correcting. Facing this challenge, we will always desire some things that are bad for us, and some of us will naturally have these problems worse than others, for reasons of both innate and experience-based reasons.     How do people (children & adults) take pleasure in the pain of others?       The whole in-group vs. out-group thing is scary. I'm also a dad, and I am blessed with a son who is really very healthy mentally and physically and is pretty well adjusted and normal. And kids are mean. Focused on the toy he wants, excluding the other kid. Wants friendship with another kid, ignores another. That kind of stuff comes from being self-centered. Quite a lot of adult human-on-human abuse also comes from caring about one group and not another. Ignoring the spirit of the golden rule, or thinking other people in certain groups are exceptions. Then there's the scary world of true sadists. That fucked up shit I don't understand, but I just imagine that there gets to be some wiring where people get off on the sense of power and dominance over others that comes when they hurt others and instill fear in others. Scary especially when that comes from being a recipient of abuse. Also scary when it traces to a brain tumor or brain injury. Always scary."

Aside from books (which are mostly electronic now) I have very little that I wouldn't give away or lose with a smile. (I had a very bad flood last year and lost tonnes of books -- I have degrees in Humanities from Oxford, so you can imagine that it was 6 or 7 bookshelves worth of books that were destroyed). I am ok with that. I was, the moment I saw the water & damage.  I try to explain to my children that built into something such as a beautiful vase, is a broke vase in millions of pieces.

The lady in question isn't necessarily ""bad"" but she is very thoughtless and often speaks hurtful things without thinking about what she is saying.

I'm not really mad about what she said anymore, but it was just a reminder that I will never be accepted in this group of people because of my ethnicity.  I feel like if I go back, it will be like saying it is okay to treat me that way, but if I stay away, it's like their nasty words and actions have power over me.    As background, I am married to a Romanian and speak near fluent Romanian.  My husband is a member of a Romanian church (as am I) and I always feel bad when I go there, but I want my children to have that connection to their culture.  I was at a ladies retreat and everyone introduced themselves.  This lady started talking and said she even knows me from when I rented from her.  I never rented from her, my husband did, but when I politely told her that, she said ""fine, you just 'visited' "" which means something very inappropriate in this conservative community.  It was embarassing for me and completely unnecessary considering my husband rented from her 13 years ago."

Would you just take, along with me, ten seconds to think of the people who have helped you become who you are. Ten seconds of silence.""  And then he lifted his wrist, looked at the audience, looked at his watch, and said, ""I'll watch the time."" There was, at first, a small whoop from the crowd, a giddy, strangled hiccup of laughter, as people realized that he wasn't kidding, that Mister Rogers was not some convenient eunuch, but rather a man, an authority figure who actually expected them to do what he asked. And so they did. One second, two seconds, three seconds — and now the jaws clenched, and the bosoms heaved, and the mascara ran, and the tears fell upon the beglittered gathering like rain leaking down a crystal chandelier. And Mister Rogers finally looked up from his watch and said softly ""May God be with you,"" to all his vanquished children.[13][32]"

WTF?!"
TheChurchOfRogers,3bl012,demafromua,3,Thu Jul 2 21:32:51 2015 UTC,"Personal anecdote and a few random facts, just because I want to share but I don't want to clutter this post and make it longer than it needs to be!  So my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time during my senior year of high school. She kept it from me until I'd graduated, as she didn't want the news to interfere with my academic performance (I wasn't particularly pleased with that, but saw her logic in it. But was still upset that she didn't tell me she might be dying sooner)  As she began chemotherapy treatments, her hair began to fall out and she started to lose her appetite. Everything tastes wrong after her treatments, and it took nearly a week for it to begin to taste right again. She took in transfusions of red blood cells to make up for the death of her own cells following donations, but at the time I assumed it was whole blood.   Being a stubborn-as-all-get-out 18-year-old, I made a point to ride my bike to one of the blood mobiles during a blood drive at a local restaurant. Pro tip, don't do that, there's a reason they tell you not to exert yourself. I just got lucky that I never did any damage, I easily could have.   Anyway, for whatever reason, they had buy one get one free coupons for a smoothie restaurant called Tropical Smoothie that was somewhat nearby. On an impulse, I picked one up for my mother and one for myself before heading home-- and much to her surprise, it tastes ""right"" well before it should have on her chemo schedule.   It helped her to keep fighting through the treatment, and became her tradition-- every Friday, she would get a Tropical Smoothie. Eventually her coworkers caught on, and began bringing them to her at the middle school where she worked. When she finally finished treatment much, much later (100% cancer free for six years!), she made a point to bring the smoothies in for everyone at her office as a thank you for all their support.   Donating blood sort of randomly helped in that instance-- not the direct impact I always expected to see, but an indirect one that some small part of me will probably always believe was some semblance of fate, and will be eternally grateful for.  Also, fun fact! Running for an hour will burn approximately 500 calories. Donating blood burns (on average) 650 calories! Though the surgeon general does not recommend donating blood as a weight loss plan-- 650 calories is 650 calories. That's a guilt-free donut in my book. Plus, I mean, you need sugary foods to replenish what you lost. That's a double-guilt-free donut. That's, like, a donut that you feel good about eating! How cool is that?!  Quick note-- most donation centers giving to hospitals and emergency rooms will not compensate you for your donation outside of free juice and cookies to help you recover after the donation. Occasionally you'll be lucky, as I was, and get promotions from local businesses, but many local laws prevent mom-commercial blood drives from incentivizing donations, as they fear that people who are not eligible to donate may lie about their past in order to meet he criteria and take those incentives. Please, do not lie about any of the criteria (even if it's something that we know is silly and wrong, such as same-gender sexual contact, which doesn't affect your blood unless you have contracted AIDS already), as the center will have to spend a tremendous amount of money if that lie comes to light and you have donated.   Also worth noting-- if you get scared before they stick you, here's my anecdote-- my very first time giving, I was 16 and the blood bus was visiting my school. I had a signed parent consent form, and I shook so much that the staff had to take my pulse six times before they decided that it would be ok. Despite reassurances from all of the employees, I was still terrified-- so much so that I didn't even realize he needle was in until I finally opened my eyes and asked when they were planning to stick me. Everyone got a pretty good laugh out of that, and my friend donating across the aisle made fun of me for it for a while. It really is a lot like a roller coaster-- the anticipation of the thing is much, much scarier than the reality of it."

TheChurchOfRogers,3ba5z2,Imperialvirtue,10,Sat Jun 27 06:30:37 2015 UTC,"If this is a single issue, can you ask to not talk about it? If you haven't told people that you feel hurt you should start by doing that. If they want to change your mind, making you feel bad about yourself is not the way to do it.  In my family we have people who have very strong feelings on both sides about a whole bunch of religious issues. For example, part of the family is devout Catholics, most are non-devout Catholics, and a few are atheist. Between some people respectful discussion is possible, but between others it's not. After some shouting matches I concluded that I must avoid any future discussions of my/other people's religious beliefs with a certain family member. This is inconvenient, because the most strident person really wants me to believe what she does. But you need two people to have an argument, and both of our feelings are hurt by these fights.  I'm dealing with it by basically making it really hard for the most strident person to talk to me at all if she's going to bring it up again.     When someone is airing their view that you disagree with, be quiet. This was hard for me at first but got easier with practice. If possible, absent yourself from the room without making a fuss. Go to the bathroom and don't come back for ten or fifteen minutes. Go to a different room and do the crossword or whatever. Refuse to be drawn into arguments. When the conversation about That Thing starts up again, end it. Say, ""I really don't want to have this argument again"" and change the subject. ""Fighting about this with you hurts my feelings.""  Give fair warning that you're going to avoid them if they don't stop: ""I don't want to be around you if you're going to claim I'm a terrible person for not agreeing with you.""  If they won't give up, leave the room, or hang up the phone or whatever. You might have to do this a couple hundred times. It will start other fights, but at least they'll be about how rude you are rather than That Thing again.  When they're not talking about That Thing, reward them with more positive attention. Display more interest in things they like. Say nice things to them.    It took a couple of years honestly, but the reward is that I can have a healthy relationship with that person without compromising my beliefs or having an argument at Thanksgiving that makes the whole family mad a both of us but mostly me."

It many ways the way some choose to live their lives  just magnifies situations in other more affluential areas.  One thing I am glad I no longer suffer from is worrying about what people say when I do not really respect their thoughts. I always explain it to my students as, ""he doesn't pay my rent"". If someone isn't helping you to achieve great things, or helping you with food, shelter...Why worry what they think?  I think this can be true even in parts for people we care about. While I may have asked my father about accumulating wealth or other 'stuff', I'd never value his thoughts on other matters.  Even today (at fifty years old) I was 'cut down' by my 82 year old mother who was upset that I was taking her food shopping on Sunday rather that Saturday. As much as it still hurts to think that I may have caused her to be upset.   Deep down, I understand that she is suffering for a multitude of reasons (the lose of independence amongst the most troubling things). Of course, this causes me to suffer also.  I could spend my time thinking, ""I have two other brothers who live close enough to help out much more and I have more responsibilities (younger children) than they do and far less means financially to assist. To be honest, it would be more productive to do anything else.  I can only change my actions. I can only change my* thoughts. I can only do what **I believe is right.  I am very fortunate that at fifty years old, I still have my mother and she still has all her mental faculties about her. My mother will die. That is no surprise to me or her. Although I will be saddened by that untimely event, I will stand, knowing I tried to do whatever I could. I won't be thinking, ""what if?"" then.  I'm fortunate. I aspire to be able to act in this manner to each and every person I come in contact with! How wonderful would that be!?  Let us all pause throughout the day and just smile at all those that are so angry about things that really don't matter. Let us all take the true wisdom from people and be able to discern the ignorance that they may speak.  May you all know peace: even for a moment!"
TheChurchOfRogers,3b9fs3,jeffwm,11,Sat Jun 27 01:44:10 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest attending marriage counseling with you and your wife as it sounds like you're unhappy and that's a good way to talk about that.   In terms of meeting other people with similar interests, I'd try to use Google or talk to someone at your public library to see if there are any groups in your area that celebrate your interests. Many people find friends and meaning from volunteering so that might fit with your political interests. I'm sure if you're as nice in person as you are in your post you'll make some friends. Good luck."
TheChurchOfRogers,3b9fs3,ThelemaAndLouise,3,Sat Jun 27 14:09:07 2015 UTC,"I second marriage counseling, and it sounds like your wife needs to be going to therapy alone as well. Addiction tends to go with depression, and I imagine this will be hard to get her to do.   The ugly truth is that exposing yourself and even more so your daughter to her behavior will have lasting repercussions on who you are and how your feel. The only thing that still upsets me about my father is that he didn't have the courage to separate me and my brother from my mother earlier, and he didn't tell us in no uncertain terms the things we needed to hear to protect ourselves. To be fair, my mother was openly abusive.   With that as personal context, I believe that separation should be one of the solutions you consider. If your wife is depressed, she might be unhappy with your life together, and knowing she's making you unhappy could be making it worse. Even if separation doesn't help your wife, making difficult decisions for your family will make a serious positive impression on your daughter which will help her avoid being trapped in this sort of situation later in her life.   As for socialization, I have found that my isolation stems entirely from my internal attitudes. You have to differentiate yourself from your judgments of yourself, and act from an unlimited place.  Go to places like diners and parks and watch people interact. Some people are happy and outgoing, and they will grasp the waiter's armwhen they order. It's okay to touch strangers.  Join a book club, take a woodworking course, or go to the gym. Any of these things will begin to bring balance to your life, which will help your daughter.   Ultimately, for all intents and purposes you are a conglomeration of your thoughts, experiences, and actions. If you don't like these things, you probably don't like yourself. If you don't like yourself, it will be hard to invite people in. I quit my job in computers so I could barback because I didn't like who I was.   This is all going to take a lot of psychological and emotional work. I can recommend books ranging from light pop psychology to deep spiritual fare. Let me know if you want recommendations.  I could go on, but I'm meeting a lady for brunch. You should take your daughter to brunch."

Even though we live in the U.S. where they have some of the strongest confidentiality laws she is sure it will get back to her job. (BTW, she is in health care and the insurance is through my job.)   There is no discussing it with her. Even when I've said to her that her own daughter (12 years old) says, ""I can't count on mommy"", my wife's reply is that my daughter is wrong. Even if my daughter was wrong, wouldn't you be upset she felt that way?  I'm here for my children. I'm the bad guy because I'm the only one who makes or enforces any rules, but I'm also the one they come to when they need something.  It's the best I can do for now."

The feeling of failing to reach your loved ones might just be the worst I have ever experienced, despite feeling it a lot...  I have never been married myself. Never even had been in relationship in my 21 years, mostly because I don't understand people too well - think social awkwardness level 100500 combined with a lot of psychological complexes. There were girls I liked and even the one I loved, yet I was never able to show them what I am and what I feel towards them and... well, friendzone was the best result I ever reached.  You - you already have an advantage over me. Years ago you found strength to say to this woman ""I love you"" in a way to make her believe you. And you meant it - otherwise, why would you stay with her for what, 20 years, give or take? And you still do - otherwise, you would have found a way to have an affair or break all of the relationship apart.  So, before you do something stupid and radical, listen to loser on the Internet. Send you kids to your or her parents for a day and talk to her. Really talk to her. Turn off her computer, sit her in front of you and talk. Tell her how frustrated you feel. Tell her that she is losing her children for some polygon models in the virtual world. Tell her how much you love her. And tell that you want to help her with whatever she is facing, because people don't escape into the virtual worlds when they are comfortable in theirs. I know what I am talking about - in last five years I became somewhat an expert on both internal frustration and videogames.   I'm not saying it will help. It probably won't, it probably will. I don't really know. But tell yourself something I'm telling myself every time I have to make some really tough calls: ""Despite having a 90% chance of failure, it's still the right thing to do"". So go to her tomorrow and do it - and if it fails, you'll know that you did your best.  I wish you luck."

TheChurchOfRogers,3b0gmb,jeffwm,3,Wed Jun 24 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"I have personal, philosophical, and religious beliefs against the harming of any sentient being. These beliefs are mine. I do not 'push' them on others. If someone happens to be interested in an intelligent discourse, I welcome it. This, on the other hand, is something I believe few people can argue. Although I can understand the desire to target practice, or even hunting I cannot accept the idea that a citizen has a need for weapons specifically to protect themselves from the government. I believe it was Winston Churchill who said, ""Many forms of Gov­ern­ment have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pre­tends that democ­racy is per­fect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democ­racy is the worst form of Gov­ern­ment except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.…"" There are ways to change the government. It is a shame that too many choose not to exercise their right to vote and let their feelings be heard. I find it difficult to believe that my 'one vote' counts as much as either of the Koch Brothers when they (according to the New York Times) donate $888,000,000.00. I still vote. I still write letters and let my opinions be known. I do sincerely hope that our collective 'anger' someday subsides. I do think the general anger & violence needs to stop. It seems like it all comes down to my all time favorite answer from children, when asked to stop doing something, ""but s/he's doing it too""! Maybe we should all take a deep breath, count to three, and stop to realize how fortunate we really are. Maybe I'm overly simplifying the issue. I wish I had a better answer."

It's just that as a collective people, most Americans have become alarmingly apathetic. I see even my family members watching reality tv shows were judges berate and humiliate contestants and zone out to endless hours of drama shows but when I want to talk about real-life drama, like the buying and selling of our Supreme Court Justices or the rationality behind our gun laws, I'm invariably met with, ""That's just the way things are"" or ""Do we have to talk about that? It's so depressing."" It's like the whole country just wants to ignore it and hope it all fixes itself. I honestly don't know what it will take.... what heavy price we'll need to pay, before people will finally stand up and say, ""No more"" and then actually take action toward the necessary changes.   This country has so much potential for amazing good, that it seems heartbreakingly tragic that we have let things get this bad. I want to hold tight to hope.

TheChurchOfRogers,3abvr8,imgeekynotcool,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:49:40 2015 UTC,"The trouble is, the opposite of anger is not happiness, it's sadness.  When people feel their emotions being something they don't' want, they take the alternative instead to drown it out.  It leads to depression, and that can be just as bad.  Holding on to any emotion past it's healthy point is poisonous.  Even happiness, because it can leave us lingering in the past, instead of looking at what's around us.  Often angry people are really just sad about something, but feel out of control, and sad people are angry people who feel the need to take control.  Our emotions are never delusion, and being dismissive of them leads us to cover them instead of treating the source.  Accept how we feel, don't make feelings the problem.  Just help each other act on them positively, and turn them into something constructive.

When I use he word delusions, I don't mean to discount our very real emotions! I mean it more like how we falsely believe ""If I purchase that new shiny 'thing', it will make me happy"". Sadly, when we put our hopes in outside things, they soon loose their 'newness' and no longer bring us away from those things that cause our pain. Too often, we measure our self-worth by our possessions, or our job, or our 'status'.  I believe that what we are 'worth' can only be measured by what we can attain so that we may serve and help others in whatever way we can.  I am so very happy that you were able to find refuge and make, what seemed to me, serious and positive changes to your life. You are quite fortunate.  I hope you are able to use that good fortune to continue to bring good fortune to others.
