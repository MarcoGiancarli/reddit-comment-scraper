Who is the person standing at the end of those many seasons past? Feelings swaying, the person who embraced me. What kind of day will I face tomorrow, my face pressed against the window.

In the palm of my cold hands, snow is slowly melting.  They're like tears, this winter that has met warmth.    The person seeking happiness is the happiest.

Bands alike Luxúria are known for being used as dirty/adult parties songs in Brazil specially with girls dancing, twerking and body rubbing with very few clothes on.   Regarding the background talking please note that most of the sentences they use are very regional slangs and are extremely hard to translate word-by-word and still maintain the original meaning, so I will try my best to translate what they're saying and still keep the idea of what they're willing to say:   0:09 Guy: Go for it dude!  0:30 Guy: Hey, take off your shirt!  0:33 Girl: I've took it off already  0:54 Guy: -humming the song lyrics-  1:04 Guy: Hey, take off your shorts/trousers!  1:08 Girl: Come on... no, no. I won't take them.  1:12 Guy: Take it off!  1:28 Guy: Yo man... the meat1 is already here.  1:35 Girl: -can't comprehend what's she's saying-  1:52 Guy: Ohh, hot!2  1:54 Girl: -moans as in taking a breath and pausing the dance-  1:55 Guy: Wait, wait!  2:05: Guy: Hotttt...2   1 - As in barbecue/steak.  2 - Implying the girl is hot, 'delicious'.    Unfortunately there's a lot of background noise and due to the poor recording quality I was unable to understand most of what the girl babbled. Moreover, yes they're native speakers and if I would have to tell where are they from I'd would say the countryside of either Sao Paulo or Minas Gerais states.  Hope it helped."

translator,3dqaqs,fishkin8787,2,Sat Jul 18 12:13:31 2015 UTC,"(I re-ordered the pages, so that the new order is 4, 1, 3, 2 - that moved the links around a bit, so if you find a place or institution that does not have a link, look on the former page 1 and 3)  Preface  In Autumn 2013, I visited the International Tracing Service (ITS) in Bad Arolsen in order to do some research for the realisation of Gunter Dennig's STOLPERSTEINE project. I hoped to gain new insights on nearly 100 persons from our town who fell victim to National Socialism. Most of them were Jews who lived in big cities of the Rhine region or abroad following their escape from Dinslaken. On my list, there were aslo the names of former inhabitants of the Israelite Orphanage Dinslaken.   In the ""Central Name Index"" of the ITS, which contains records about 17.5 million people on 50 million file cards, almost all names that I had collected for the visit could be found. I discovered new insights on the life of these people. For example, I did not know that two inhabitants of the Israelite Orphanage had fled to Belgium in 1938, and had been deported as young men to Auschwitz-Birkenau in the years 1942 and 1943. Both of them suvived and returned to Belgium in 1945.  At home, I evaluated my recordings. I came across new questions, especially concerning the orphanage. Of the inhabitants who had fled from Dinslaken to Cologne after the Night of Broken Glass, strikingly many had been deported as youths from Belgium to Auschwitz-Birkenau in the years of 1942 to 1944. I could not find two of the people who were murdered in Auschwitz in the memorial book of the federal archive. It was safe to say, on the other hand, that some children and youths had arrived to Belgium on a children's transport. When and from where had this taken place and who had organised these transports? How many children from Dinslaken had reached our neighbouring country? In which institutions or families had they lived? What had happened to them after the invasion of the Germans in May 1940? My search for the children and the clarifying of their fates began with these questions.   No publications about the children's transports to the neighbouring Belgium after the pogrom of the 9th/10th of November 1938 exist in German, as opposed to the children's transports to Great Britain.  The study on the Holocaust in Belgium, which was published by Dan Michman, has not been translated into German yet. In it, Sylvain Brachfeld and Mordechai Ansbacher published their results on the subjects of Jewish [cont'd] children's homes in Belgium under German occupation and of Jewish refugee children.  Sylvain Brachfeld's research paper, which was written in Dutch and published in 1997, was not translated into German either. The publication contains numerous auto-biographic records and interviews with former residents of the children's homes in Belgium. At the end of the book, the names of 682 surviving children are listed. Insa Meinen presented the first German-language research paper about the Shoah in Belgium. In this research paper, she also draws attention to the unaccompanied children from Germany who were living in Belgium at the time.   In her study about Jewish refugees in Western Europe that she co-published with Ahlrich Meyer, there's also a reference to the transport of the children from the orphanage Dinslaken.  Building upon these enquiries, the fates of the inhabitants of the Israelite Orphanage Dinslaken, as well as the children who were sent with the transport Dinslaken are to be elaborated on, and the organisation of the children's transports to Belgium are to be portrayed.     5 Escapes from Southern France  Inge and Heinz Bernhard  Inge Bernhard, the daughter of Siegfried and Anna Bernhard from Dinslaken, succeeded in escaping from La Hille. She had , according to own statements, arrived to Belgium by means of a children's transport in December 1938, together with her brother Heinz. The report card of Heinz Bernhard in Dinslaken lists a notice of departure in Dinslaken on the 31st of January 1939, and an arrival in Brussels in the Rue van O...[illegible]  on the 6th of February 1939. The Bernhard family was a prominent family in Dinslaken and owned a hospital in the town centre. Siegfried Bernhard was the last chairman of the synagogue congregation of Dinslaken. On the morning of the 19th of November 1938, he was arrested together with other members of the congregation, and deported from the administrative region Düsseldorf to the concentration camp Dachau on the 17th of November 1938 by means of an aggregated transport. His discharge from Dachau ensued on the 29th of November 1938. Siegfried and Anna Bernhard fled to Cologne in the early year of 1939.   The siblings Bernhard were separated in Belgium. Inge Bernhard lived in the home General Bernheim and subsequently fled with the other girls and the management of the home to Seyre in May 1940 and arrived in La Hille in the summer of 1941.   Heinz Bernhard got arrested on the 10th of May 1940 and was interned into the camp St. Cyprien in Southern France. On the 10th of October 1940, he was transferred to the camp Gurs. He managed to escape from Gurs to Switzerland in September 1942. Heinz Bernhard and his sister Inge got registered with the union of Swiss Jewish refugee relief organisations.  In the night from the 10th to the 11th of December 1943, the escape of Inge Bernhard to Switzerland began under the direction of Gret Trobler, who was working as a kindergarden teacher for the ""Children's Aid"" of the Swiss Red Cross in La Hille. Inge Bernhard was in the possession of a valid entrance visa into Switzerland, but she didn't have exit papers from France. With her, the twelve-year-old Toni Rosenblatt fled from the children's settlement. The three traveled to Carcassone by train. They reached St. Cergues, where they stayed the night at a children's home of the ""Children's Aid"" of the Swiss Red Cross. From there, Gret Trobler prepared the illegal [cont'd] crossing of the border.   A first crossing of the border failed, as they were surprised by a German border officer whilst scouting the border fence. On the next morning, the second attempt at escape succeeded. The behaviour of the new head of La Hille, Emma Ott, had also contributed to the successful escape of Inge Bernhard. She had learned of the children's escape through a letter from Gret Trobler and reported it to the authorities in accordance with the regulations. However, this report only took place after a two days' delay. Anna and Siegfried Bernhard were transported together to the ""old people's ghetto"" of Theresienstadt on the 18th of June 1943 from Cologne. From there, they were seperately deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, Siegfried Bernhard on the 28th of September 1944 and Anna Bernhard on the 6th of October 1944, and murdered.  Inge and Heinz Bernhard, circa 1938 in Dinslaken. Copyright family Weisskirch/Bernhard, Israel."

translator,3dkul5,Auready,9,Fri Jul 17 02:15:45 2015 UTC,"It has already been 49 days since my younger brother Shipeng has left us, but his life and experiences still remain with us. He had always been smart and cute since childhood, always had excellent grades in school, his compositions were often read aloud to the rest of the students as a model, and he was always best in the class at math. Whenever past teachers spoke of Shipeng they would give a thumbs up - having Shipeng as a student was a point of pride. After the Cultural Revolution, Shipeng moved to the countryside. The year that the Gaokao (University entrance exams) were reinstated, he passed with exceptional marks and was accepted into university, gaining the opportunity to study abroad. From the bottoms of our hearts we were all so proud of our extraordinary little brother. He was never one given to mischief or misbehavior, he never made his parents worry about his schooling. He was a good son to his mother and father.   During then time when Shipeng was away from China, whenever he came home to visit, he would always buy lots of things to bring back to his parents and family. Boxes were always filled to the brim with medicine, clothes, even toys. He really had thought of everyone. But Shipeng nevertheless always wore that pair of jeans with the washed out color. His demeanor was restrained, always frugal, never spending money recklessly. So academically distinguished, yet never arrogant. Hardworking and erudite, he was always happy to help others.  Unexpectedly, rainclouds appeared in the sky. When we heard about Shipeng's motorcycle (could also be a bicycle) accident, we did not want to believe it. How could this have happened to Shipeng, who was never careless or brash - how could such tragedy have befallen him once again? We are thousands of miles away from him. Even though we wanted to help, we could not. Even though we wanted to be with him as he passed, we wouldn't have been able to make it in time. We could only silently pray to the heavens for its blessings upon his life. He was so excellent, so kind, so honest.   We pray towards the heavens to bless my younger brother with the power to escape this calamity. Even though my brother is gone now, he held on for ten days, and even though we prayed from afar for those ten days, he still passed away. We miss you, we have and always will be proud of you, an exemplar we could look up to, we will always be proud of you. You will forever be in our hearts. We hope that you are happy up in heaven. We await the day that you come home again. We'll be waiting at the airport in the capital to bring you home.     edit: tenses and stylistic stuff"

Presumably some would get the idea about Quenya from Ilúvatar's usage of ""Eä!"" in the Ainulindale, but I wouldn't take that completely literally."
translator,3dkgkp,Neganti,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:13:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think Tolkien ever released enough information about the language for anyone to be able to do that. Apparently it is based on Quenya though, so that would be possible. http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Speech has (I assume) all the words known, which you could try to swap out with the Quenya version.  Edit: some synonyms for ""game master"" I see you could make are ""dark lord"" or ""rule lord."""
translator,3dkgkp,magradhaid,3,Fri Jul 17 01:05:52 2015 UTC,"That article (like much on lotr.wikia) is unsourced and has a good deal of misinformation and complete inventions, especially in the wordlist.  As a sidenote, the neo-Black Speech section mentions the LotRPlaza archives having a vocabulary list of neo-Black Speech, but that was mainly Beren and I ""corrupting"" words in other Tolkienian languages (as found with Orkish golug from Sindarin golodh) into theoretical debased Orkish dialects for (much) fun (and weirdos asking us how to reconstruct a word for, say, ""ass hair"", for which nowadays I'd just say the vocabulary is too limited) but even that couldn't really get fleshed out, and was speculation based on very limited evidence. Even if words could be corrupted from other languages, actual grammar and morphology would pretty much have to be invented wholesale, and we weren't in complete agreement on those, or how 'corrupted' words should turn out.  I wouldn't recommend people to use our wordlist, though it was a fun teenage experiment back in the day, with some theory and discussion (though certainly not on scholarly or properly linguistic levels). Also, our individual additions to the wordlist didn't always sync with each other's ideas of Orkish phonology, and those weren't always debated or made consistent.  At least David Salo's film Black Speech has an underlying grammatical and historical structure, and though it only has a few words in common with Tolkien's (since there is so little attested) and the rest is invented by Salo, it's a better approach than just taking Elvish/Dwarvish/Adûnaic words/roots and corrupting them, since much of the Black Speech we do know can't be linked to roots in other languages. Having an underlying grammar and historical roots then creating words from those roots (and various dialects) is something more like what Tolkien would have done (if he had liked the Black Speech more), even though Salo's actual roots, vocabulary, grammar, and phonological changes are (or would be) different than Tolkien's uncreated or unpublished (scarce) ones."

As for durb-, Tolkien more literally glosses it ""constrain, force, dominate"" (PE17:11). We don't know how a noun (or gerund) would be created from that, but Tolkien notes ""at, verb ending (like a participle) (durbat = constraining, of a sort to constrain)"". (ibid.)"
