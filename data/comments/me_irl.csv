Most people are fine and easy to take care of, but if you miss that one table where the guests need a personal slave to cater to their every whim, they will let your manager know just how horrible of a human being you are. After that, the manager will hound on you all damn day because a guest complained.  TL;DR: We have to do this shit or we get fired."

me_irl,3dzub2,RepublicofTim,14,Mon Jul 20 23:27:53 2015 UTC,"I don't remember all of their last names so I'll just give you them in order of aquaintance.   Frank #1 (Francis): 5th grade classmate. Went on a field trip to Catalina Island off the coast of California and he thought it'd be a funny idea to run from the cabin we were staying in down to the beach in nothing but his undies, screaming bloody murder, running all the way to the end of the pier and diving into the water. He screamed even louder when he hit the water and found out how cold it was that time of the morning. They wrapped him in towels and escorted him back to the cabin to warm up. He was doing this mixture of shivering and crying all the way back. Luckily it was near the end of the year so there was only a couple months of teasing before summer but I bet those months were brutal to him.  Frank #2 (Francene, a girl but people called her Frank as a nickname): 8th Grade basketball team member. Overtime in a close game with one of our school's rivals Frank, who was one of the starters at the time, decided to hog the ball and go for a 3 pointer to become a hero and win the game, the ball goes clear over the hoop and they lost the game by one point. She was taken off the starter line up and spent a good share of the season on the bench.  Frank #3: Member of my high school drama club, senior year. I spent a lot of last year preparing a play that I was going to do for a project (at the end of senior year each senior must do a project that they decide and are graded based on the quality and if they reached their goals), I cast Frank as one of the leads and he completely fucks up on stage, screwing up the play and made it so that I only got a 190 out of 200.

I think it's because of the confidence it gives.  For example I was at a festival a few weeks ago. Now normally I can't catch a football thrown lightly to me. I got a little bit drunk and I'm catching fucking everything. Some little marble sized sweet from my friend? Didn't even need to look at it. Some dudes nearby were chucking round a rugby ball, decided to throw it to me for fun. Shit throw but frankly I caught it perfectly - they asked if I was a rugby player (I know the dude, he is a rugby player, he didn't recognise me because I was all hippy looking from festival shit)  Then I sobered up and couldn't even catch a cold.  If I became a professional sportsman and got drunk before every game, would that be use of a performance enhancing drug?"
