What a chill dude. I always thought people totally overreacted to what he did, and he responded to it all with a lot of grace and aplomb.   The panty-throwing was getting kind of over the top before Unidan's fall, but I do feel sad that we don't see ""Biologist here!"" in every other thread any more.   I love the idea that Isaac Newton got sent nudes in his day, although I have a feeling he would have been even more totally awkward about it."
Upvoted,3difyt,HobbyDaily,13,Fri Jul 17 05:06:26 2015 UTC,What exactly did he do?   Can you do a TL:DR about the whole story?
Upvoted,3difyt,YouDisagreeWithMe,26,Fri Jul 17 15:57:26 2015 UTC,"He realized the reddit hivemind is extremely easy to manipulate.  A couple upvotes/downvotes sets a comment to positive/negative, and then the hivemind will just follow through with that.  He was able to use 5 additional accounts to quickly manipulate a thread, downvoting things he disagreed with while upvoting his own response.  Most people sort by best so you would see his reply, which usually looked good and never really saw the other post.  The reason he was banned is because the important part of reddit is supposed to be discussion, and that reduced effective debate by giving some voices no ability to be heard in dissent of Unidan's point of view.  EDIT: homonym fail"

He was killing my ability to compete. Him putting politics and marketing into something that I was doing for fun kind-of killed my desire to make things.

Upvoted,3dgubg,jpatton89,-2,Thu Jul 16 14:50:10 2015 UTC,"I appreciate Unidan's honesty in this episode.  And, while I don't support it, I can at least understand why he would want to add 3 or 4 more upvotes to an AMA where he got a bunch of scientists together to answer questions. He's right that it's just a stepping stone to allow the content to rise based on it's own merit. It would suck to go through the effort of getting those people together just to get buried by the sheer volume of posts.  But I just can't help but take offense to one thing in particular. As a Christian on Reddit, I find it very difficult to be here sometimes. The atheist undertones on this site can become borderline offensive. Especially when I started redditing 3 years ago and /r/atheism was a default. Seeing posts on the front page every day insulting my faith was tough. And now...hearing him say that he would use alt accounts to downvote Christian beliefs is just...disheartening. Sometimes, I mention God or Jesus and I immediately get heavily downvoted. This just confirms suspicions I have always had that people may be using vote manipulation techniques to downvote those types of comments."
Upvoted,3dgubg,PhillyGreg,5,Fri Jul 17 07:16:03 2015 UTC,"Well Reddit demographically is more secular and left than the US in general. I'm an ex-Christian (or apostate if you prefer the biblical term) and I don't really have much sympathy for your experience being annoyed at the lack of support for your religious beliefs. Just consider that religiousness is the norm for most people on the planet. In the U.S. and most other places being atheist means you're basically unelectable. Christians in the US trust atheists less than religious felons. My childhood friends aren't really my friends anymore now that I'm atheist. I don't really understand how you're surprised that people on Reddit don't like hearing about your religious beliefs. Have you never witnessed or participated in the real world isolation and exclusion of people who didn't share your religious beliefs. Because I certainly did. I don't speak for anyone but myself, but I'd venture a guess that you're catching the result of the shitty way Christians treat unbelievers. Besides the internet is kind of the place for people who believe in the current scientific consensus. I vaguely remember something about persecution being a validation of Christian faith that should be celebrated. But I don't want you to leave Reddit, I think this is a place for people of all types and I like engaging in discussion with people I don't agree with. But, If nobody is really harassing you or threatening you, then my advice is to develop thicker skin."

Upvoted,3cnel5,GotZah,119,Thu Jul 9 06:48:11 2015 UTC,"I suppose I'll take this moment to be critical, and this time, not from a technical/podcasting angle.  I think one of the biggest issues reddit (the company) has is a lack of proper PR. I'll admit, I know little-to-nothing about the corporate structure of reddit, but a lot of the announcements and commenting going on should have been done from a CMO. The fundamental rule of PR is to know your audience.  I guess you could call /u/kn0thing's recent speech at a high school, in which he got escorted out on the principal's orders, a foreshadowing of last week. (For those not in the know, it was a good speech, but there were a few moments of profanity, which doesn't fly at all in a public school setting -- sorry for calling that out, but I figured it was a relevant example). The lack of understanding the audience was repeated again with the popcorn comment.  The first story involves not understanding the expectations of the setting of communication with the audience. In other words, the unwritten rules and etiquette for speaking at a high school (like using PG language at all times). The second story involves not understanding the feelings of the audience. The replies from /u/makemisteaks and /u/Randomass7654 in that thread summarize the issue perfectly.  Oddly enough, Victoria's post in /r/self is a prime example of how to properly handle a tense post. She maintained a level of cheerfulness we've all come to know and love, didn't divulge any sensitive information, and left it at that. You can tell she picked every single word carefully.  That's one of the big stresses behind PR: carefully choosing what to say, when to say it, and how to say it. You guys had a lot to say, and I'm sure you have the best intentions, but the way you delivered it can lead to some misconstruing. While listening to this episode of Upvoted, I kept thinking, ""Someone is going to make a hissy fit about how a majority of the podcast was discussing modtools, rather than Victoria or the 'cleansing' of reddit, and will claim that modtools are being used as a distraction.""  I know you guys aren't working on modtools as a distraction. You're working on modtools because you genuinely care. But, when a majority of your podcast talks about technical jargon, and only a few minutes discuss any actual 'controversy', people will assume the worst.  This is, to a very small extent, a fault of the reddit userbase for expecting perfection from the reddit staff. It's a fault of any audience, really. You guys are businessmen and coders, not marketing and PR experts. It's like when a celebrity makes a dumb comment and everyone overreacts. My immediate response is, ""Um...duh? Do you think Justin Bieber is a member of Toastmasters?""  That does not, however, excuse reddit from not having proper PR. You all have a role, and your own strengths and weaknesses. Ellen was chosen as interim CEO to get things done, despite all of the issues people bring up about her past. Alexis is fantastic with public speaking and being genuine (to a fault, arguably, after that popcorn comment), which is great for community engagement. But, reddit has grown to the point where it could benefit from someone with proper training to use the Golden Mic of Reddit. If there was ever a time to get hiring, now would be it.  PS: It was very tasteful not to include the intro/outro music and sponsors for this week's podcast, as it was during the Armenia episode. Just wanted to give you guys props for that."

I've read through your comments recently and we've seen you talk a lot about authenticity, and encouraging thought leaders, celebrities and other interesting people to get involved in specific communities here. Perhaps all of that comes at the price of making the site ""safer"" for exchanging ideas that coalesce with more, I don't know, socially acceptable values, etc. (aka, everything related to all the talk of censorship, real or imagined; but I understand if you're going to bring more ad impressions to market you've got to do what you've got to do...). Sigh... In any case, the real threat to authenticity on this site, IMHO, is content marketing. We all know it's happening here, whether its organically being posted and promoted by third-parties, or whether, and only you folks at Reddit would know, it's being surreptitiously promoted through agreements your offices are making with various sponsors (which is downright unethical, if you are asking me, but I'm not making accusations, ... ahem ...).  So, my serious question is, what is being done, apart from the wisdom of the crowd, to combat content marketing so that we can TRUST that reddit is an authentic place for exchanging ideas? It just feels like, the bigger any social media platform gets, the more bloated and overrun with content marketing it becomes, and the social media analysts who parrot such material ad nausea to boost their clients' SoV scores. I understand you've got to increase your inventory of impressions, and authentic conversations with popular people will help with that, but when brand names are polluting the site with content that may or may not be authentic, it starts to feel like it's not reddit anymore. I almost cannot tell the difference between authentic content and content marketing on the homepage anymore, and in subreddits like /r/pics and /r/funny.  So again, and I hope you get to see this and I hope you reply some time, but, again, what is reddit doing about content marketing, and how will it be controlled or better exposed? And I mean more than just being able to report something as spam. Or maybe, are some corrupt mods doing deals behind the scenes with PR firms unbeknownst to you? Anyway, thanks for reading.

There are lots of possibilities. I think too many people look at r/all and think that that is all there is too reddit, but it's not just another 9GAG or Imgur, it's a whole lot more.

A good example is Brandon Sanderson (/u/mistborn) -- he always pops into threads in /r/WoT and /r/fantasy that talk about his books, and is such a friendly guy.

I've not heard a comment on this, and need some elaboration."
Upvoted,3cnel5,krakrakra,19,Fri Jul 10 04:30:33 2015 UTC,"I just had a chance to finish listening to the podcast, and from what I can see nobody's said what I'm going to say so I hope this doesn't get lost.    I love what you were getting at with your comments about the transcendent moments that have happened with celebrities, but I am afraid that you might be missing a key point.  What creates the transcendence, what creates the magic, if you will, is not celebrity.  At least, not necessarily.  Basically, it sounds like you're really groping for the recipe for the secret sauce, for what creates those interactions that get magical.  But don't presume that ""celebrity"" is a necessary ingredient.  I don't think it is, and that's partly because I mostly live in some little corners of reddit where the transcendence happens many times every day, not ""every couple of weeks or so"" as you said in the podcast.    My reddit account's almost as old as yours, Alexis, and I've been here and paying attention the whole time, too.  And I think in some ways the most important and compelling things about reddit are the same as the most important and compelling things about Commander Data: the way they've transcended their programming.  In particular, I think that the ""service"" subreddits, that exist specifically for people to help each other, are something that goes far beyond the original vision of a ""news aggregator"".  It's places like /r/assistance and redditgifts and some of the mental-health support subs that have found a way to turn on reddit's emotion chip.  And I think that you might do well to shift a little of your attention away from the celebrity angle and look over there.  (But for the love of the FSM that doesn't mean ""selling"" the service subs - I can't think of a better way than that to fuck up our real-life karma.)  I think you're absolutely right that people feel uniquely at home here, and because of that they feel uniquely free.  (I think that unique freedom is what appeals to the celebrities who ""get reddit"" because fame is incredibly confining, after all.)  And that's by no means an unmixed blessing; look at how many tantrums got thrown when people's ""god-given rights"" to harass and torment others were taken away a few weeks ago.  And I think there's much to learn from how much negative reaction there was to the implementation of the harassment policy, which, in a sane Universe, ought to have been a no-brainer.  (And I do think that the fallout from that probably intensified the Victoria-related frenzy.)  The people who are intensely attached to reddit I think feel free to be themselves here in a way that they can't anywhere else.  Not just anywhere else online, anywhere else, period.    Now, there are two things I know about freedom.  1.  There's no such thing as freedom without risk.  And 2.  There's no such thing as freedom without safety.  I think the prevailing assumption in much of American culture (from my pov as a foreigner looking in) is that more safety = less freedom.  And hence anger about the harassment policy.  And I think the Victoria fiasco is a good illustration of the other side of the coin; nothing is more constraining than uncertainty and lack of trust and dependence on what's outside our control.  And I think the methods that the protesting moderators chose to express themselves, by using privacy settings to close down their subs, illustrates the psychology of that really well.    I think that the most freedom for people to reach their potential, whether in an online community or in society at large, occurs when there's an optimal balance between risk and safety, between people having control, and people being constrained.  It might go against American ideology, but in fact, having some sane limits gives everyone in a community more freedom.  And, whether by accident or by design, through most of its history I think reddit has managed to live in that sweet spot. But it doesn't take much to slip out of it, as we've all seen. Because I fear it's an unfortunate truth about first-world culture that it's not always safe, in the ""real"" world, for people to express their natural altruism and empathy. So one of the most important thing reddit does is carve out a safe space for people to be their best and most generous selves.    Finally, I want to say that while the Victoria situation was a huge failure, I have a feeling that some incidents of this type are probably necessary evils.  It's one of the proverbs of the software business (where I have my day job) that if you're not failing once in a while, you're not doing anything very innovative.  Reddit is absolutely unique, so everything that goes on here is an innovation.  So, shit's going to go wrong.  It's still worth it to be here."

One thing that stands out is that you guys are constantly looking forwards, to the future, at what you can do better tomorrow.  Perhaps instead of this, you should take a step into the past to look at what you did well previously that has changed. I brought this up in the announcement and /u/raldi agreed somewhat, which was nicely affirming.  I would also advise against the use of the word ""authentic"" in your public-discussions about this. I understand it works as an easy word to use in meetings in the workplace to discuss a very specific thing, but it doesn't work for PR anymore. It's been overused by companies in damage limitation and has become a word regarded by the average person as corporatese, a buzzword. A single word like this that triggers people can turn a message that otherwise would have been taken positively into something taken negatively because the audience are looking for something to attack you for no matter how much you're trying to look out for them.  I would also advise that while you're talking about shipping features for mods and so on and so forth you should remember that it doesn't matter how much you give them if you don't nurture your relationship with them. You can give them the world and they'll still hate you for it if you don't also give them appreciation. On the flipside to this you could also not give them any features and they would be happy as long as you maintained an appreciative relationship with them.  Please don't make the mistake of believing that giving them features will make them think of the admins better.  Words will actually serve you much better than actions."

Upvoted,3cnel5,msheaven,10,Thu Jul 9 14:10:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm one of the guys that came on to do video (back in April).  We'll be doing a blog post about all of this soon, but I want to try to address it where I can first. We're not taking anything away from r/iama or trying to move anything anywhere.  Both NDGT's recent AMA and Hilary Duff's AMA were done on video - but if I hadn't mentioned it, you probably would've never known...right? When a person chooses to do video, the 'text' part happens by default - it just means that someone is transcribing their vocal answers into text, which is how a majority of AMA's were done in the past - people would call in over a phone rather than type them out on a laptop.  Text will always have an advantage. It will go 'live' right away - whereas the video will take a little while to polish and post. And the reason that we're doing this, is because we think there's an audience out there that may not 'get' reddit, but would probably wants to watch interesting people answer interesting questions. And since these amazing people are coming to us and doing these awesome interviews anyway, why not try to make the most of it and capture expressions, laughter, sadness, surprise - on video and use imagery to really help tell their story. At this point, I'm just looking forward to showing what we've done so far, get feedback, and grow it / tweak it from there."

Part of the reason Victoria is so popular is that this was retained when she was transcribing etc. Don't get me wrong not all of them were great but the beauty was that they were raw and honest.   With these video AMA's that have gone through post production you lose a lot of that, and in my honest opinion in doing video AMA's you are losing what AMA's on reddit are about. If we want a PR piece we can go to numerous places and find them. Once you start monetizing and videoing them you lose that."

The current trend is to clearly articulate exactly why someone has left the company. It's called transparency and has a number of benefits such as setting expectations for other employees.  The real benefit, from a PR perspective, is that prevents people from filling in the blanks, which is what happened. And that's why u/kn0thing and u/ejkp have have had to eat shit sandwiches since it happened."

Upvoted,3cnel5,Absinthe99,3,Fri Jul 10 17:20:48 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm a little worried that reddit is too focused on chasing page views rather than building a community. But the page views are a result of strong communities. You talked in this episode about getting more celebrities like Arnold to post in different subreddits - and that would be great to get more noteworthy people involved consistently on this platform - but I don't think you can force it.   Something that Steve brought up in a recent podcast was the importance of subreddit discovery. There are some great subreddit communities here that must be easier to find for both new and old users. Maybe if you encourage celebrities to do AMAs in specific subreddits, that might be a good way to more directly connect fans with their heroes."

Upvoted,3cnel5,cat_sweaterz,3,Fri Jul 10 22:50:01 2015 UTC,"2 things, one in response to the podcast and one i've been thinking about as things have progressed:  1) Communication. I'm not going to criticize anything that's been said, but it looks like the open conversation from admins in the past week has noticeably helped from what I've seen. Threads were mostly admins suck/fire Pao/other angry circlejerk originally, and once admins started to interact with Reddit on Reddit (Pao's apology post) the mood shifted to more discussion and less hate (like this thread).   A large issue that others have pointed out and I agree with all over reddit is the lack of interaction with admins. I have as many admins as possible RES tagged in bright red, and I very, very rarely see them do anything on reddit (except in corporate meta threads like this one). Maybe I'm not browsing the right subs, but compared to when I joined and before there seems like there is so little admin -> user general interaction.  /u/Deimorz said it best in the podcast when you asked ""What are ways we can stay in touch with our people who are using reddit?"", he answered ""I guess just more frequent and honest communication is all that people are looking for,"" and went on to say how the vast majority of the userbase only hears from admins after something has changed (/r/announcements is almost entirely retrospectives). You have /r/blog to say anything you want, so use it to talk about things that are happening or are being planned. We want to know! The vast majority of reddit isn't subbed to /r/modnews, /r/ideasfortheadmins, and who knows what other subreddits that are used. It would help to see a better presence.   2) Vote Manipulation. This is mostly for my own curiosity. One hot topic is brigading and manipulation, and after the announcement /r/upvoted got eviscerated with downvotes. This has to be super easy to track where on reddit the brigades came from, I was wondering if you would use this data as a sort of case study? It would interesting to see (username censored, obviously) data on /r/redditdata, and would provide insight into how Reddit is analyzing and working to fix this problem."
Upvoted,3cnel5,jpatton89,3,Thu Jul 9 16:50:11 2015 UTC,"To your second point. That would be interesting. However, my guess is that people just clicked on u/kn0thing's username and downvoted all of his activity. At first only the submission he made to r/upvoted were being downvoted. A while after is when everything else was being downvoted."
Upvoted,3cnel5,Werner__Herzog,2,Fri Jul 10 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"I agree. It would help showcase the complexity of the issue if you could show users that data though. And, if that's the case, quell the rumors that places like srs and the like are brigading centers."

I was originally very ticked off by the now infamous popcorn comment, and I just dismissed every post after as damage control. Hearing Alexis talk about what happened lets you hear how he really regrets everything that happened over July 4th weekend, and how he still has a passion for the site, its members, and its values. I think it was a very smart move to dedicate this episode to the reddit revolt, and while I think that actions will ultimately speak louder than words, it's definitely a step in the right direction."

Sometimes it is the opposite, it's ""charisma"".  Some people (indeed many people) can convey a feeling or sense of ""sincerity"" in their voice that is nonetheless not really present.  You need to be cautious of putting too much emphasis on your emotional reaction -- it is often mistaken -- and in either direction (i.e. you may disregard someone who is actually being very sincere, but just lacks the ""charisma"" and/or the tone of voice to convince you of it -- and conversely you can easily be fooled by someone that is just really good at faking the ""sincerity"" bit)."

While I totally get that you can't go into detail as to why you've let any employee go, I think reddit is using this privacy shield to protect themselves from describing the process itself once the decision to fire was made. Was the general consensus that nobody would really care? How did that change as you realized how big of an impact this was going to have?  To the average user, the thought process is way more important that moderator tools or any other technical stuff. Reddit's approach still seems a bit tone deaf to me, which is a part of why this was a problem in the first place."
Upvoted,3cnel5,stmbtrev,2,Thu Jul 9 08:07:34 2015 UTC,"So I listened to the podcast last week and have been mulling this over, and now with more confirmation of /u/kn0thing being the one who let Victoria go I've decided to just give my opinion on the AMA's.  Now I'm not all in the know or even a frequent visitor of either /r/AMA or /r/IAmA but from all the recent issues that have sprouted up I found some form of understanding of how things work and from the Podcast I get a form of understanding of how they want it to work going forward.  How I understand it is they want to remove Victoria as the buffer between the person doing the AMA and reddit itself, get them to actually use reddit as an online service and maybe become part of the community after the AMA such as Arnie. That sounds all well and good but let’s think about that? Let’s say that a requested celebrity is willing to do an AMA but not exactly computer or internet literate? That person isn't going to really be able to figure out reddit by themselves and it is less likely for them to do the AMA if they have to thumb their way through something they don't really understand or know how to use. This is where Victoria came in to help with that barrier. I think there is room for the new system and the old and maybe instead of removing Victoria as a buffer but instead restructure how to set up AMA's if how I understand it is correct.  Instead of Victoria holding the persons hand through the entire AMA have her teach them how to actually use the service, introduce them to the platform and get them to do the things needed to use reddit as a user not just a onetime AMA. If afterwards the person doesn’t want to continue using the service fine, we get the AMA and they get to go on their way. If they do want to stick around the service even better for all.  From how they explained it they might actually lose a lot of possible AMA’s because they want them to join the service not just do the AMA, forcing it on the people who are coming to do an AMA.  If they come correctly yes they will use the service and if what I’ve heard is right then I would be surprised that Victoria wouldn’t be willing to help in making that happen. But I hope they don’t plan on throwing away AMA’s with people who maybe don’t want to use the service for one reason or another after the fact. Those that do, great, if not, fine do the AMA and move on.  This is all from my current understanding of things, if I’m wrong about anything feel free to correct me."

I totally understand that to grow your business you have to constantly change. Reddit presents a weird dynamic with it's community and trying to change. Everyone that is active on Reddit, either as a contributor, stalker, or a mod acts like a little stock holder in Reddit. They might only own one share, but they still want to have a voice on what happens in the community. The whole incident that happened last week, feels like there was a stockholder meeting and none of the stockholders were invited. Excuse the pun, but a lot of people invest a ton of time on Reddit and I think they do deserve a say it what is being considered.  Would it be a terrible idea to have a sub dedicated to discussion on what is being tossed around in terms of changes and let the users have some input on what they think of the ideas? Maybe make it like some sort of student council?   There is no way to make 100% of the users happy, but if there is a process in place for everyone to voice their concerns it might take the sting away.

Parts of it were awkward and hard to listen to, but that's what running a company is sometimes. Not everything you think is a good idea, is a good idea, you make mistakes, you sometimes let people go, sometimes you do it poorly, or for good reason but you can't say what that is, sometimes you even fire the wrong people. Regardless of how we got here, we got here. I hope it doesn't happen again. I'm cautiously optimistic as I hope most redditors are -  but here's what I find refreshing about it.  Don't forget, that most upper management of big companies aren't this apologetic. It's a higher standard here in this community, and that's rad. reddit, really, doesn't owe us anything, sure, it's in their best interest, but not required. Yet, here we have /u/kn0thing/ is owning it, and change is happening. It was also nice to hear from someone in the reddit engineering group.

This is coming from an outsider who really doesn't know the full story. People make mistakes/stupid decisions, the best thing we can hope for is to learn from them and do our best to prevent them from happening again. Reddit has lost some amazing people this past week and I hope that in time they decide to come back and at least be content submitters and share their stories. /u/kn0thing I look up to you and hope that your apology and promises to make the changes needed aren't just lip service.

It's astonishing that the admins can be this bad at PR. When there's a problem, waiting is never a good idea. Get in front of this stuff and you can avoid most of these minor issues from blowing up.   A well worded statement on Thursday afternoon could have avoided the whole blackout, but time after time you guys play this ""keep silent and hope it blows over"" card and it blows up in your face.

The goal is to create a much more 'hands off' system regarding the scheduling and facilitation of AMAs. He has described the team of existing admins in charge of funneling AMAs to the right mods for scheduling in the interim. This team will be replaced by a full time employee in the future. He has also described the new team in charge facilitating AMAs and some of their broader objectives concerning integrating talent as consistent posters rather than one off occurrences. This more relates to the site as a whole rather than how /r/IamA functions day to day.

They appointed Alexis because they assumed as a founder he would have widespread community support and would do his job well.  Instead, he is almost single-handedly ruining the community here.

While the ""Reddit Myths"" page has this misdirection;   myth: Condé Nast owns reddit.  reality: reddit is not owned by Condé Nast. reddit used to be owned by Condé Nast, but in 2011 it was moved out from under Condé Nast to Advance Publications, which is Condé Nast’s parent company. Then in 2012, reddit was spun out into a re-incorporated independent entity with its own board and control of its own finances, hiring a new CEO and bringing back co-founder Alexis Ohanian to serve on the board. The best characterization might be to say that reddit is a “part-sibling-once-removed” of Condé Nast.   But, they go and say right below;   reddit has 3 sets of shareholders: The largest shareholder is still Advance Publications. The second-largest set of shareholders are reddit employees. In the spin-out that occurred in early 2012, Advance voluntarily reduced its sole ownership to that of a partial owner in order to put ownership in the hands of current and future employees.    So.  Reddit is not owned by Conde Nast.  It's owned by the same people who own Conde Nast.  ie: ZERO FUCKING DIFFERENCE.  What's not said is how much of Reddit is owned by Advanced (Conde Nast's common parent.)  The purpose is to intentionally misdirect."

I think the videos should be embedded.  I know you probably want people to navigate to the OP, but the newsletter should be easy to enjoy too.  The styling is just weak now too.   If there is a way to adopt the header style from each subreddit and apply it to the each 'article' it would give an better character to each article.  A physical newspaper is kind of nice in that there are sections, and maybe you can't have a 'Snowden' section, but just a styling for each article might accomplish a similar thing.  It feels a bit like just a random list of posts now.  It needs a little more motivation/organization or something.  It functions well and I think its smart to compile a list of ""best of"" kind of stuff, but it feels like a pile of random stuff when it might need the kind of enjoyment you get from a newspaper navigating from world politics to local politics to entertainment to tv to comics to crosswords.  Just more literal focus of either zooming in or flipping pages between articles might work to break up the pile."

Growing up in the South as I did, I feel like it was especially impressed on me by my mother and mamaw the struggle that blacks went through to get the rights they have now, even though I am whiter than a piece of paper. I was taught to be careful especially of their feelings and to treat them with respect. In conversation, if I was among my friends/peers, I was taught that it was ok to say ""This black person"", but if I was among my elders or black people I was to say the word ""colored"" (which I assumed, for many years, was actually more polite than saying ""black"") and saying the N word was right out because it was only something that white trash or ignorant people said.  Growing up, I wasn't actually around that many people of color and the only way I got to experience what I thought of as black culture was through the medium of television--primarily The Cosby Show, Martin and re-runs of Good Times and Sanford and Son.  I read books by Toni Morrison and  Terry McMillan because I was curious about black culture and how blacks saw the world.  I learned this last year that maybe, by being curious about black culture as a white and trying to understand the black perspective, I may have unintentionally been offensive. That really shocked me, like a slap in the face.  Now I don't know what to think. I want to sympathize with the blacks who are going through such crap right now but I don't know if it's appropriate to do so, because I am white. It's a very confusing time."

Upvoted,3bvnif,legalizegaymarinara,-2,Thu Jul 2 19:28:32 2015 UTC,"Im fairly yung  (19) almost a kid really, but I grew up with people 3 to 4 years older than me. I was never a social guy within kids my age so I was influenced by people who where more mature and had more expirience in life, people that knew better than me who they were and who they are. I saw better and better the contrast between someone doing something because they understand why they are doing something, what they whant to achive while doing it; and other people doing something beacuse other peolpe are doing it or because its what older people do and such. Basicly, I started to hate this hypocrite type of people who just follow blindly societies presures. I basicly promised myself that I will always scream out whatever I think, whatever my view is and hear out poeple who actually have found the real reason for doing something. Basicly people who have actually grown and to filter out the hypocrits. For example, I never understood why people chose flowers as a gift. They do nothing, they dont smell, they are stupid, they are pointless and they die. Hypocrits would just say "" you are not romantic, you will never get a girl like that etc"" so they did not explain why people give flowers untill some old dude told me ""kid, I dont understand it either,  I think they are stupid but I don belive they are pointless. You see, for some strange reason, girls like it and when I have nothing to give, I buy flowers and I do it thinking of the smile on her face. So just think of that and try it out""   The point I what to  make is that reddit should allow people to say whatever they think and belive because as shown on this podcast it helps these people with sometimes obviously wrong points of view grow with true knowlege and not to follow blindly anything or anyone. We as human beings do not change the world if we force someone to do or think some way or another, we truly help society when we erase wrong ideas and change them into empathy and respect because its the only way we can really make sure that its less likely to happen again."

Upvoted,3btpig,TheOneTonWanton,14,Fri Jul 3 03:34:01 2015 UTC,"Wut?   The medieval fiddle emerged in 10th-century Europe   I get that you got that from the right side info box, but the actual content on that page says something different.  Full context paragraphs:   The medieval fiddle emerged in 10th-century Europe, deriving from the Byzantine lira (Greek:λύρα, Latin:lira, English:lyre), a bowed string instrument of the Byzantine Empire and ancestor of most European bowed instruments.[2][3] The first recorded reference to the bowed lira was in the 9th century by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911); in his lexicographical discussion of instruments he cited the lira (lūrā) as a typical instrument of the Byzantines and equivalent to the rabāb played in the Islamic Empires.[4] Lira spread widely westward to Europe; in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms fiddle and lira interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments (Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009).  Over the centuries, Europe continued to have two distinct types of fiddles: one, relatively square-shaped, held in the arms, became known as the lira da braccio (arm viol) family and evolved into the violin; the other, with sloping shoulders and held between the knees, was the lira da gamba (leg viol) group. During the Renaissance the gambas were important and elegant instruments; they eventually lost ground to the louder (and originally less aristocratic) lira da braccio family.[5]"

Upvoted,3btpig,oldguynewname,6,Fri Jul 3 01:16:20 2015 UTC,What about all the others? Reddit is losing money with defaults going private. If the userslf reddit want a change this will get the job done.  As I said it will do one of two things. Force users to find an alternative. Or it will force admin to show they truly don't give a fuck and demod all those in default sub's that are protesting. Just so they can be back online.   The disconnect is so great between admin and mods is deplorable. I mean smaller sub's sure ok. But larger ones for default even? Was a guest that notified them in a modmail message. Not an admin. On top of that it was in the middle of an iama that she was shit canned. That guy is all over twitter.  Maybe he ain't that important like others. But don't matter now more and more news media outlets are going at it. Rumors will fly and who knows what will happen.   Only saving grace is transparency with the user base and say wtf and why. Being the way they have in the past I am guessing it won't be till Victoria does and iama and yishan comes in and just throws a bunch of shit at her and gets guilded for being such a dick like last time.   Reddit is in a bad state. It isn't gonna get better. Sure a majority of the user base don't give a fuck as long as they see their cats and dank memes. But if all their sub go private. They will find out why and say wtf.   I actually submitted content. I did that for free and mods are not paid yet are treated like shit same as I am. What the fuck. Well fuck reddit. They will leave like locus after the crops are gone.

Upvoted,3btpig,oldguynewname,6,Sat Jul 4 01:24:26 2015 UTC,I don't hate the Admins I also don't believe the majority of reddit does. Admin do as they are told. That's all. Its a job kinda like hating the mailman for bringing you bills.   The only logical (to me) explanation is that they said iama is going to be making money now and she said not under my watch and they said so be it.  Hey maybe I am wrong let's hope so. But more and more defaults are going dark now. You think its gonna just end? Not without an explanation. Or they demod all those in the sub's.  If that happens then exodus. People will leave because they think reddit owes them something. Mods do so much for free and its overlooked but no one cares till they rattle the cages.

The problem is I hate USB mics and coordinating it would be a pain in the ass (though it'd be nice to get more use out of my Stamps.com account :) ). Currently, we are trying to do tapesyncs whenever possible. Which is we ask the guests if they could go to a local recording studio or have someone record them locally. We did that for the next two episodes and they sound awesome (you can't even tell the interviews weren't done in person). So we are trying to slowly but surely cut out the skype recordings. I am sure there will be times were we would only want 5 minutes of tape from someone for an episode, the guest is in the middle of no where (like the Craig Watts episode), or the guest is in a foreign country where we would have difficulty implementing this strategy.

Upvoted,3b8ij4,Karunamon,275,Fri Jun 26 20:48:50 2015 UTC,"10 years of reddit  16 billion upvotes  2 billion downvotes  Nearly 200M total posts  1.7 billion comments  And the staff chose to throw all that goodwill and hard work away in the last 90 days or so because apparently, answering direct questions is too hard for you to do. You'd rather let people froth and think about conspiracy theories and nonsense, because you'll make officious blog posts about vagaries rather than answer simple and direct questions.  In other words, because you'd rather do anything but be honest and forthright.  We've got this wonderful platform called IAMA, where we've had the goddamned president of the united states.  Yet the staff can't even use it to answer questions?  I'm unhappy. I'm writing this because I happen to like this place, having been here for the last 4 years or so despite your recent attempts to make me very much not like it.  I'm not even talking about certain communities being banned.  I'm talking about shadowbans and how they're applied, seemingly arbitrarily. I'm talking about how default subreddits capriciously apply their rules to suppress discussion of massively important legislation. I'm talking about how admins only apparently reply directly to people that support them, rather than engaging with the community as a whole.  The lack of respect being shown here, from Reddit's administration staff, to the users that generated billions of comments, votes, and posts, is absolutely unprecedented in the history of this site.  I'm talking about the fact that secrecy, as it applies to things like the TPP, and Reddit's shadowbanning policy, and the behavior of the defaults, is usually the hallmark of shenanigans.  I call shenanigans, Reddit."

I'm talking about shadowbans and how they're applied, seemingly arbitrarily.   We need an alternative to the shadowban, yes, but there will always be cases where it's imperative the spammer doesn't realize they've been caught, else it's an arms race we'll never come close to winning. This is what the vast majority of shadowbans are used for. We're developing the alternative ban, though, which will notify a user and include some kind of cool-off period.   I'm talking about how default subreddits capriciously apply their rules to suppress discussion of massively important legislation.   Is this about TPP?[Yes it was] Which communities? I just want to be sure we're talking about the same thing. The core problem here is with defaults, which I'd like to get rid of, but don't have a great plan for at the moment.   I'm talking about how admins only apparently reply directly to people that support them, rather than engaging with the community as a whole.   That's a fair point.

Upvoted,3b8ij4,HowAboutShutUp,155,Mon Jun 29 17:42:08 2015 UTC,"Welp... now I feel somewhat humbled considering how bent out of shape I was when that comment was written.  So.. thanks for at least proving one part of this wrong :)  Anyways, that clarification.   ..there will always be cases where it's imperative the spammer doesn't realize they've been caught   They are being applied to people who do not appear to be spammers. And whether they know it or not is irrelevant, because both the ban and people's reactions to it happened in the same thread.  From what it looks like, it's been deployed in a number of cases against people who did nothing but smacktalk either the admins, or the interim CEO.   Neither of these things are against reddit's rules, and they certainly don't deserve the spammer treatment.  Now, that may or may not be the case, but the radio silence when anyone is asked about this matter (either by modmail to /r/reddit.com or similar) naturally leads people to assume that something not entirely above board is going on.  FWIW, I actually do think something untoward is going on, and I think it's something along the lines of sanitization for possible upcoming suitors. Recent behavior on the site matches up a bit too closely with what a corporation would ""like"", yknow what I mean?  If that's the case, just come out and say it already.   If that's NOT the case, then it really, really shouldn't require this level of outrage to get an honest answer.  You know what would be really cool and go a very long way to placating people? A group admin IamA. With people like you, /u/krispykrackers, /u/ekjp, and the lot. Perhaps even make it a regular thing?   Which communities?    I'm referring to /r/news - the rule says ""no politics"", okay fine, but for some reason, the TPP is considered politics, while supreme court decisions and things like SOPA are not? We've come from the entire site rallying against SOPA to a law which has the potential to cause more damage being actively flattened from one of the most visible places on the site?  Here's the all time top submissions on that subreddit. A good chunk of them are blatantly political.  I'd feel a lot better if default subreddits had to hew to higher standards than /r/joes_news_shack, yknow? I get that the idea is or was that subreddits are their own communities, but a hell of a lot of power comes with being a default (not the least of which: they're the face of the site!), and you know what they say about power.  +1 to that idea of getting rid of the concept anyways. It's kind of telling that the consensus on the internet appears to be reddit gets better when you unsubscribe from them.   That's a fair point. Where in particular could we have done better?   This, what you did right here? Do more of it, in highly visible places. People think something bad is happening because the staff is generally ignoring their questions - so what just happened here? Make that happen more.  Don't give better responses to BuzzFeed than you give to your own userbase.  Some other unanswered questions I can think of which nobody has really ever chimed in on that I'd love to see actual answers for:   Are places like /r/kotakuinaction on the verge of being banned or not? How can they avoid that fate? Speaking of /r/kotakuinaction, why are they disallowed from organizing email campaigns to corporations? (Famously, being told that posting a PR person's company contact info at Volkswagen is not allowed) - and what rule of reddit does this violate? What is the actual definition of ""brigading"", and how does it differ from regular comment/post interaction on the site? What measures are in place to assure that fake/abusive reports do not lead to removal of people or communities? The ""safe space"" rule seems as if it could be trivially abused."

If that's the case, just come out and say it already. If that's NOT the case, then it really, really shouldn't require this level of outrage to get an honest answer.   You're right. It's been bad. We've gotta do better. I hope this is helping.   You know what would be really cool and go a very long way to placating people? A group admin IamA. With people like you, /u/krispykrackers, /u/ekjp, and the lot. Perhaps even make it a regular thing?   Yes. Obviously, this has come up after this weekend, too.    Which communities? I'm referring to /r/news - the rule says ""no politics"", okay fine, but for some reason, the TPP is considered politics, while supreme court decisions and things like SOPA are not? We've come from the entire site rallying against SOPA to a law which has the potential to cause more damage being actively flattened from one of the most visible places on the site? Here's the all time top submissions on that subreddit. A good chunk of them are blatantly political.   I'd like to give communities the chance to dictate their own rules. The bigger issue here imho is that they're a default, so their decision has more weight. If we built a better system, if enough people thought one sub was moderating too poorly, they could just go to another sub fluidly, but defaults + poor subreddit discovery breaks that. We need to fix those things and if we do I think we'll go a long way toward solving that problem you describe.   I'd feel a lot better if default subreddits had to hew to higher standards than /r/joes_news_shack, yknow? I get that the idea is or was that subreddits are their own communities, but a hell of a lot of power comes with being a default (not the least of which: they're the face of the site!), and you know what they say about power.   Yep, gotta figure out a better solution than defaults which are a hangover from when we didn't have enough active communities to just tell people ""hey what are you into? subscribe to these places..."" which we can do now.   +1 to that idea of getting rid of the concept anyways. It's kind of telling that the consensus on the internet appears to be reddit gets better when you unsubscribe from them.   Yep!   This, what you did right here? Do more of it, in highly visible places. People think something bad is happening because the staff is generally ignoring their questions - so what just happened here? Make that happen more.   Yeah, I needed to have re-read this over this weekend. I've been on pretty much nonstop since Thursday talking to users, but the vast majority of comments have been in mod-only communities, or slack, or email, or PM, and the few publicly visible comments I made were stupid.   Are places like /r/kotakuinaction on the verge of being banned or not? How can they avoid that fate?   I don't believe so. If they're not breaking the harassment policy, then they shouldn't be.   Speaking of /r/kotakuinaction, why are they disallowed from organizing email campaigns to corporations? (Famously, being told that posting a PR person's company contact info at Volkswagen is not allowed) - and what rule of reddit does this violate?   We definitely need to re-think this rule. Adding to the list. Organizing an email campaign to target a PR person's public corporate email seems like it should be reasonable. There are a few of rules we need to clarify.   What is the actual definition of ""brigading"", and how does it differ from regular comment/post interaction on the site?   Whatever it is right now it's too vague + complex. There was a good thread about this over the weekend -- here's my thoughts from a comment that should help:  ""np is not the answer. It's a terrible new user experience, too -- most folks have no idea (nor should they) how it works and that's a problem. New system should make np unnecessary. It should be a that gives mods control over this. If you as a mod don't want your community to be affected by bestof post, then we should make that easy enough to enforce with a few clicks. And I'd like a definition of brigading that comes out of it that's very transparent and concise with the definition (and again give as much authority and tools to mods to enforce as possible).""   What measures are in place to assure that fake/abusive reports do not lead to removal of people or communities?   The community team can break this down better than me, but it really comes down to the rule: ""Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them."""

I understand that, right now, most of the messages you are getting are likely to be negative, with your responses immediately getting downvoted deep into the negatives.  I also like that this doesn't seem to be as saturated in PR-speak as some of the other recent admin posts/comments (like your modclub thread telling moderators to get their subreddits back online, and ekjp's (AKA Ellen Pao's) comment about ""we need to better support moderators, and we'll do it by breaking the moderating tools they currently have in place"").  Still, I don't see any real change from a month ago.  The detailed admin posts are saying the same thing of ""yeah, we know [np/shadowban/AutoModerator/modmail] is currently broken, and we are working on fixing/replacing it"", with no further news until the next time an admin responds to a question about that.  Throw in some Beta features coming out of Beta when they are still broken, as well as the very subjective rules on ""harassing""/""brigading""/""bad behavior""/""what will get you banned"", and you have a really volatile situation with the site as a whole."

Upvoted,3b2ypq,tuttlebuttle,3,Sun Jun 28 00:25:34 2015 UTC,This was a really interesting episode. Did you all ever figure out who the first user to work the system and make a self post was?
Upvoted,3b2ypq,kn0thing,-198,Fri Jun 26 01:27:12 2015 UTC,OH! Let me do that now. Asking our smart people....
Upvoted,3b2ypq,raldi,3,Sat Jun 27 21:49:47 2015 UTC,I didn't realize I could change up my front page by subscribing or unsubscribing for a LONG time.  I saw the subscription button on subreddits but I didn't understand what it did.    It wasn't until someone posted a pie chart of people had not yet unsubscribed from r/funny http://imgur.com/gallery/ZKEbFTv that I started messing around unsubscribing to stuff I didn't like and looking harder for stuff I did like.
Upvoted,3b2ypq,omegacarn,-198,Fri Jun 26 03:24:06 2015 UTC,"UGH. This is the bane of my existence right now. I want to solve this problem so badly for new users because there are people who LOVE reddit and have no idea how it works -- just imagine all the people who think ""eh, not for me, I'm into discussions about slowcooking"" -- I want to sit them down and subscribe them to r/slowcooking!!"
Upvoted,3b2ypq,truthisthenewblack,3,Sat Jun 27 21:48:42 2015 UTC,"For all active users who have not subscribed or unsubscribed to any subreddits in the last 90 days, calculate their Most Hated Subreddit -- for example, if such a person has an upvotes-to-downvotes ratio of < 25% to /r/pics -- then set things up so that the next time they go to downvote an /r/pics submission, the arrow turns into an expando saying, ""It looks like you hate /r/pics. Did you know you can just unsubscribe from it, and never see this crap again? Click here to learn how.""  (Note: That was just an example; I have nothing against /r/pics)"
Upvoted,3b2ypq,tuttlebuttle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"I like this idea. I'm not in favor of huge intro tutorials, because I think most new users tune those out on sites now. However, some simple items like this could really help get new users into the flow of the site.  Giving everyone easier options to unsubscribe would also be helpful. Having to click into a sub to unsubscribe or going to settings is too much work for a modern site. There should be a way to do it without leaving the post list of the front page."
Upvoted,3b2ypq,GotZah,2,Fri Jul 3 16:26:35 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine was shadowbanned and received an Inbox message not from the moderator / admin (btw, what's the difference? I forget what's what) I used to have several other accounts VERY active..but I kind of boycotted Reddit when the following happened:  My friend went on a subreddit and did NOT break Reddit rules, that's the crucial thing to grasp here.   Anyway, one day she texted me that she posted something in a particular sub and to check it out. I did and couldn't find it, so texted her..""It's there""she says and screenshots it...hmmm yup... that's when she gets an email from hueypriest, Erik Martin, explaining that her comments made people uncomfortable and he reminded her several times she was not paying to use reddit and could be removed at any time for any reason. Her comments questioned a govt narrative of a mainstream dialogue so ever since then, I'm saddened about the lack of truly free speech....even here,  /u/kn0thing ??"
Upvoted,3b2ypq,cat_sweaterz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's tricky.  Maybe the top subreddit for every new user could be something that briefly explains the deal.  And as part of the explanation, they could be taught to unsubscribe from the help subreddit.  They'd learn how unsubscribing works and it wouldn't be bugging anybody once they understood how things work."

Way to go, /u/ParagonPod /u/kn0thing /u/cat_sweaterz!   Loved the variety you guys have thrown in over the past few months, from the panel discussion, to the cameos, to all of the overall fun story-telling I know you guys probably addressed this before, but I miss that string bass sponsor tune :( Just something to consider, but for episodes that are a bit heavier on the profanity or content, maybe have a more ""kid-friendly"" version up in the show notes for those who want to download that -- the more popular the podcast gets, the higher the demand for something like that is bound to be With Upvoted and Upvoted Weekly, it's only a matter of time before you guys start UpvotedTV -- I just wanted to call it now and reap that sweet sweet karma if it ever comes to fruition (and I volunteer as tribute if there was ever a need for assistance to make it happen) This one is actually for /u/spez since he's here: I really want to use Hipmunk, but I keep finding myself coming back to Google Flights because of their calendar view. I know you guys have a similar function with the lowest fares over the next 90 days, but having that calendar and such an easy price comparison eases the process so much. Also, since you've been on the East Coast for quite a bit, I'm sure you guys know we use buses a lot. If Hipmunk ever wanted to dive into the bus market (like Wanderu), I'd throw so much money at you guys. /u/kn0thing, how could you grow up in HoCo and not like the Ravens? Also, in a previous episode discussion, I joked about you starting ""Variety Hour with Alexis Ohanian"", but failed to respond to you after you asked what it would be like. This episode is actually pretty much what it could be: hanging out with a guest and talking (similar to SourceFed's Table Talk)   Cheers on hitting 10 years, and here's to 10 more!"

Just something to consider, but for episodes that are a bit heavier on the profanity or content, maybe have a more ""kid-friendly"" version up in the show notes for those who want to download that -- the more popular the podcast gets, the higher the demand for something like that is bound to be.   Yeah maybe we should have a warning for those in the front. Doing two separate episodes is a little tough right now, and not quite as needed. I also don't want to put an explicit tag on it cause that'll probably have negative effects in iTunes. Do we have many of you here that wish you could listen to it with your children, but don't for fear of the subject matter or language?

As for any assistance I could potentially offer, it's a bit limited since I imagine you guys operate in roughly the same physical location, so for someone remote like me, it would be along the lines of some basic video editing and script-writing."

I know that this is on purpose ""you can't tell us what to do"" and all, but it is a childish reaction.  It would have made a much clearer statement if people had simply joined together against the banning ""peacefully"" (ie, no hate-mongering) or simply left, vocally.

The previous notable time was when they prevented you from distinctly seeing upvote and downvote counts for each post/comment using RES or mobile apps. There were threads full of people getting angry about infringement on their freedoms, how this was reddit opening the door to shills doing vote manipulation, how the site was going to the dogs. Admins and their sympathisers were mass downvoted. There were calls for gold boycotts and adblocking campaigns. People found alternative sites and announced loudly that they were leaving.   Within a week, everyone forgot about all that shit, the alternative sites' traffic dropped to pre-change levels, and people realised their all important freedoms weren't really under threat.

Upvoted,38u7ho,AdamBombTV,23,Sun Jun 7 07:26:45 2015 UTC,"I came over in the great Digg migration (I'm sorry, please don't shoot me), and one of the major things I noticed was the sense of community and comradery within the boards, there were no power users pushing their agenda to the front and making lesser stories fall off the front page, no, here everyone was equal and all had equal chance to get their story, their images, their videos, even their lives noticed and talked about. Here, you are amongst people who generally just want to have a good time, you can find stories about disgusting sexual fetishes one minute, and then gush over the latest kitten picture the next, there is something for everyone.    Literally.    There is something for everyone. And if there isn't than you can make it, you can create a subreddit to an obscure German animation from the 1980's and you're likely to find an audience for it.    Reddit tells you that you're not alone, and that others have the same weird and wild thoughts that you have, maybe even weirder and wilder... and thats comforting.    My favourite story is probably the one I saw on my first day on Reddit (Or there abouts, it's the one that sticks out most), it was the 'Today you, tomorrow Me' story. Its a simple tale of human kindness and just makes me smile whenever I see it. I try to live by the ""Today you, tomorrow me"" mindset, it's a good philosophy to have.    Reddit is more than a place to kill time for a few hours (It IS also that, but  still), it's a place where you learn, where you care, where you get grossed out, where you hear about news happening first, where we create the news and where people can create friendships.    It's a pretty rad place to be.    Oh, and if you're enough of a smart ass, they might just send you 72 doughnuts in the mail.    Happy soon to be 10th birthday, Reddit. I can't wait to see the next 10 years.    EDIT: I know it's meant to be a video, but it's past midnight here and I don't want to make too much noise. I'll try and get something up tomorrow.

Here's a comment I wrote about a month ago that portrays how it's helped me:   My favorite subject in school was always creative writing.  As opposed to other homework, it only required my imagination and it was fun to do.  I remember specifically asking my teachers for more assignments, which annoyed some of my other classmates.  After high school, I wanted to continue writing, but, for one reason or another, I never completed anything.  I had a concept for a novel I wanted to write based on one of my creative writing assignments, but I never got past the ideas so they'd end up in words.  Then, over a year ago now, I discovered writing subs and started writing again.  The best thing you can do is just keep writing.  I've known that the whole time, but I never really took it to heart.  And, while I haven't been able to write as often as I'd like, I can see myself improving, which will only make it easier as time goes on."

It has become a place where I have made friends from around the world. The MegaLounges are more of a home for me than most of the subreddits that I joined to follow sports. The community there (that starts in /r/lounge) is amazing. We may not all agree all the time, but we are one big family.  Another thing I love about reddit is the Upvoted podcast. To be honest, I wasn't really excited about the podcasts. But then I started listening to them a few weeks ago. I had to go back and listen to them from the beginning.

Upvoted,38u7ho,kiwiapple87,2,Sat Jun 6 23:52:50 2015 UTC,"As a gamer, my favourite thing about reddit is communities and fitting in.  Amidst the gaming subreddits of this site, for every game released, a community somewhere pops up serving a small number of people with a very specific set of needs. These people mesh together well around a common thing they all like, and they form bonds because of it.  Eventually these communities die as the game exits the interests of the people, they move onto other games, and other new communities.  However, many of them hold onto specific friendships they made, hold contacts with people they played with, and hold a special attachment to that community during that time of their life. For them, in some cases, that game WAS that community.  This is the powerful thing reddit is helping the gaming subreddits provide.  The only shame of it all is that those communities have no longevity. They are all doomed to eventually die through one reason or another about the reddit ecosystem that makes it hard to support their continued existence as they move into new titles.  But still. Those memories people hold. For some kids, teens and adults there are serious feelings attached to communities that reddit helped breed.  That's the best thing about reddit. The places on this site where people come together with a common interest to form real emotional bonds, friendships and memories."

The reddiquette is one of the best, that thing should be applied to the whole internet as a form of the 10 commandments.  I love the vastness of reddit. I am a very active 28 year old male. I can find whole communities that have well curated content of just about any topic. I'v learnt and gathered knowledge like no other human has ever before: i'm into videogames, photography, fitness, diet, porn and who knows what else. All of these subs are rich, great and really cool"
Upvoted,38u7ho,Parktheredbus,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of subreddits like /r/Politics and /r/Worldnews as I already read a lot of different news outlets and use news apps. But reddit complements this in a very interesting way via its plethora of national and local subreddits. I very often visit local subreddits after hearing news items relevant to that locale to get the ""talk of the town"" so to speak and get more insight from people doing the same and asking questions that the locals answer. This is where reddit really shines! You can find lots of different local perspectives on news and the like! They are usually also very accommodating to travel questions and visitors often go there to share their trip with the locals. Every place like /r/Westpapua to /r/Canada is worth a visit to broaden your world view."

Reddit always was the place to cherish wisdom, distractments and yes - of course - sometimes very dark humor. The question is: Who makes the rules? Who decides whether it is humor or harassment? What about differences in opinion and humor? Why are there subreddits where rape is glorified, but a subreddit motivating people with very hard examples to overcome their unhealthy life style is deleted? Why can you Admins not even respond properly to the concerns of the people? A black day for reddit. I think that many - myself included - will not find any longer a home in your ""nation"".

I felt apart of the movement to keep the Internet open and free and it felt great. When the FCC voted to adopt the new rules I was ecstatic.   By being involved in the net neutrality debate has led me to becoming more aware of issues that may not be picked up on the mainstream media (ex. TPP and TPA). I urge everyone that have noticed picked up the phone to call their representatives to discuss their stance on issues today please do so. It takes 5 minutes per call and could make a huge difference.

Upvoted,37lnre,lifes_a_glitch,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:53:37 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia: Net neutrality (also network neutrality, Internet neutrality, or net equality) is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication.   A ""free"" Internet and a ""neutral"" Internet are thus interchangeable in this situation."

So far I've been loving the podcast and I thought that this experiment with exploring a bigger idea was really interesting! Net neutrality is one of the very few current issues I have a strong opinion about.  One bit of feedback: I think the episode would have been more engaging if it was more discussion-centric as opposed to the sort of narrative nature it had. A narrative style works really well for the usual reddit story episodes. But for big idea topics, I think it would be really cool to have large parts of the content be conversation between Alex, Alexis, and one or two guests. Not too interview-y, though, more like a round table discussion with some good back and forth.   Just my two cents; still a great episode."

But I don't see an unvarnished victory in the FCC's title II changes. The FCC chose to leave high speed cable monopolies in place by excluding them from certain title II provisions. Why doesn't the FCC require cable companies to lease access the way phone companies are required to? I can choose from multiple DSL providers where I live, but only one cable Internet provider.  It wasn't always this way. Cable monopolies used to be required to lease access to competitors. But the FCC changed the rules in 2000 to grant them monopolies. Until we fix the competition problem the monopolies will still find ways to add tolls to the Internet."

Upvoted,36w1b9,orchid8,3,Sat May 23 11:23:23 2015 UTC,"The closest thing will be the Cracked video which is on my IMDB page, which definitely will go on the resume because it was real on-set acting experience. I have a brief history in casting and I know that more than anything, they care about real acting training and experience. I don't list extra or bit-role credits on my paper resume, only training and speaking roles. They see adding in uncredited background work as padding an otherwise weak resume. However, it probably wouldn't hurt if the casting director was a redditor ;) Also I could informally mention it on my website biography or offhandedly in conversation (not that I would, unless if it organically came up), but it definitely isn't something you should lead with if you want to be taken seriously. I mean, it is the same for any other profession. If you were a reddit-famous world-class food server, you probably wouldn't put that on your resume - you would list your prestigious food service training and experience. For the record though, I think being a film extra is great experience for any aspiring actor or anybody aspiring to work any job in the film industry. If you are observant, you learn a ton about how a movie set operates and will know what to expect the first time you're on set with a credited job. Most of it is in the episode. Maybe 20-30 minutes were cut or so. Nothing was ""censored"" or anything like that, it is more about cutting down on the fluff and helping the storyline. They have to keep it under a certain length or else it goes into two parts... and I don't think just 20 extra minutes would warrant another part. Things that were cut that I wish were not are: armchair SOPA activism on reddit, getting people to email porn site admins to black out on SOPA black-out day. The statement from Ed and some more Jarod stuff. Life after the suspicious onlooker incident (although of course that includes NoFap and Jarod).

I haven't heard anything about it, so I really doubt that they plan to include me. Especially since they didn't re-edit the original to include me after all of the free press the suspicious onlooker incident gave them. And Tom Cruise, etc refusing appear in various press (from my understanding his publicist refused other things before) about the suspicious onlooker aside from tweets.  In the case that they would like to, I feel ready for it. On-the-side I've been doing improv, private lessons, and acting classes. Ready for ""Even More Suspicious Onlooker"". My body is prepared. My mind is sound. I'll start prepping now.  But in all seriousness, I can guarantee 99.5% that this would never happen, unless if Ed Zwick (the new director) has a sense of humor. Or maybe if their marketing team had a redditor on it. My only cautious optimism stems from this: it would cost them one day of SAG-rate (less than 1000) and they would get a lot of free marketing because of it. But again, doubt it will happen."

I did a few smaller acting gigs. Then I returned to school a couple of months afterwards, finishing up my degree. Then after a break-up with my then-girlfriend I sat around, living in my father's house rent free, for a few months crying every day and furiously masturbating to internet porn. Then I started contracting for Google for the Google Shopping product, helping to improve their data to display better search results. Then I quit porn and started exercising, reading books, and leveling up my life. Then there was a fire and I lost all of my belongings and moved out of my burnt-down father's house. 1 year and 8 months later I quit Google and started freelancing and working on my own projects (such as NoFap) full-time. I saved up a lot of money from Google so now I'm just living very frugally and living below my humble amount I bring in from doing my own thing.  But I value experience, happiness, and pursuing my other goals more than money. So now I just do web development, pet kitties, work on NoFap, write, take acting classes, and am just trying to figure out life right now.  Thanks for the question!"

Jarod ""/u/edify"" Coonce was one of the most selfless people I've ever known. Way too young to die. Hope you're in a better place now, regardless of where that might be: in the peaceful worry-free void of non-existence or ""the big computer in the sky"", as your father Ed would put it. You're missed by many - family members, friends, and redditors alike.  Shout out to everybody who made this possible:   /u/NvaderGir for suggesting this episode. Without your suggestion, I'm sure this would have never been recorded! I'm just a washed up ex-reddit celebrity, wallowing in the 15 minute self-pity with the likes of cumbox guy. THIS IS MY BIG BREAKNot really. But seriously it is just such an honor to be featured on the official podcast of my favorite website ever. Reddit has defined by 20s and it means so much to be involved with reddit in this capacity. I'm so happy to have this opportunity to share these stories with the community, especially the stories about Jarod. The super talented /u/ParagonPod who set everything up and edited the entire episode (check out the site here). /u/kn0thing for creating reddit, being an awesome person, and leveling up humanity by enabling so many humans to help other humans in their own respective ways. It is the cumulative butterfly effect in action, and there is no way we can predict the tremendous ramifications that reddit has had on the world. reddit is a website unlike any other. It boggles my mind that Alexis is on our side. He's in charge of the biggest media company in the world and hasn't been corrupted by corporate information-control bullshit. He is one of the rare media moguls who genuinely cares about humanity. Check out his book ""Without Their Permission"", hipmunk, Y Combinator startups he has been involved with, and his activism for internet freedom. Meeting Alexis Ohanian in person was such an honor, and I hope to have the opportunity to hang out with him again someday! Just a few hours with him left me a better, more motivated person since he radiates contagious awesomeness. The entire reddit community for enabling all of this. Without the community, I would have never had all of those acting opportunities, been the cult leader of the internet's largest porn-recovery community, or been able to pay for /u/edify's funeral. reddit has changed my life and given me a platform to do some good in this world, and I'm just so thankful for that.  Not only has it resulted in these things, but reddit makes me laugh, makes me cry, and provides me with more entertainment, in-depth discussion, and news than my brain can handle. Some of my best friends I've met online via reddit. Thank you to the reddit team for upkeeping the site and continually improving it. I can't believe Tim Ferriss is in this episode too.   If you take away anything from this episode, PLEASE BUY SMOKE AND CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS!!!!!! Fires are scary and come when you least expect them. Have an escape route, a fire ladder (if you are on a high floor), and rehearse rehearse rehearse. When the smoke hits you, you get 75% stupider and won't be able to act rationally. Make sure you figure out what to do BEFORE it happens so that it is robotic."

Upvoted,36r7qz,Alexanderr,6,Sat May 23 15:57:39 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to jump on here and say that thanks to upvoted I've realized a couple of things: 1) I'm not really a Redditor, I'm just a lurker.  2) I'm a piece of shit in many ways.  What makes Reddit great is the community - and I'm talking about active community, not the hive-mind aspect of it. I'd like to consider myself a Redditor but won't grant that title until I feel I'm actually contributing, however that may play out (more than just a comment here or there).   About the second realization, many upvoted listeners will understand right away why I'm saying this. There are so many selfless people (like in this episode for example) who one never really hears about through legacy media. I think I'm a good person and all, but really I can do much much better.  Upvoted is an amazing service to so many of us and I thank you thank you for producing it."

Upvoted,36r7qz,Le7els,23,Mon May 25 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"Hey Alexis and Upvoted community! I have wanted to share my thoughts on this podcast for the longest time, but had not caught up to the current episode until today. I discovered the Upvoted podcast through my podcast app Pocket Casts (which I discovered through Reddit) in late April and have been blasting through each episode ever since.  I want to thank you and everyone involved for making such a wonderful podcast that truly captures all of the best elements of Reddit.  While I am far from a religious person, each day I wake up and count my blessings, or better yet, the things that I am happy to have in my life. And Upvoted is absolutely one of them. For years I have tried to explain to my friends and family all of the wonderful acts of kindness that form through Reddit, and have gone so far as to update my parents whenever I find a particular episode compelling.  From finding a connection to the world in prison, to starting the career of a screenwriter, or even helping a transgender woman find her place in the world, every Redditor has their own unique story and can be thankful for the kindness of this wonderful community.  I too have been the recipient of many generous favors and advice from Redditors in the nearly four years that I have been an active member of the community. Redditors have brought joy to my life through the generosity of Secret Santa, helping me mourn the passing of my grandfather, and giving me advice about finances, purchases or even what clothes to wear. Hundreds of Redditors even helped me with my senior thesis years ago, which took second place at one of the largest Communications conferences in the United States and set me on track for the career I have today.  What I find so special about Reddit are the amazing humanitarian efforts made by its members for complete strangers on a daily basis. Upvoted is a prime example of the wonderful philanthropic and compassionate accomplishments of the Internet. The web can be a dark place and we’d be kidding ourselves if we didn’t acknowledge some of those communities which exist on Reddit. But whenever I am down and need a reason to restore my faith in humanity, I look no further than this podcast and the sensational stories it highlights of the Reddit community and really, the world.  So thank you so much for this podcast and everything that you do for Reddit! I just really wanted to let you know how much it all means to me. :)"
Upvoted,36r7qz,dirtyswede27,10,Thu May 21 19:17:42 2015 UTC,"I use Pocket Casts as well! Love it for my Android. Upvoted is probably my favorite podcast right now. I leave for work at 3:45am every morning and drive an hour through the nothingness of central Illinois. Its not uncommon for me not to see any other cars on my way in. No matter what the subject is on Upvoted, it keeps my brain engaged and focused because it is always so interesting to me. I think if I had an Upvoted podcast every morning to listen to, I probably would not have hit the 4 deer I have in the last year and a half."

How does that even make sense? People wait tables hoping to get a lucky break like the one he is apparently squandering. This isn't a career in the medical field. This is acting. The ""proper path"" concept doesn't even apply. His managers were right to be perplexed and aggravated. I mean what are you hoping to some day spontaneously develop the talents of Meryl Streep while carrying entrées to customers and then and only then will you start taking-up the [likely non-existent] acting gig offers? I'm flabberghasted bro. Flabberghasted. I can only surmise that he's just too much of an awkward penguin to just admit he doesn't want (or can't handle) the career that was laid out for him.  Anyway, good show."
Upvoted,36r7qz,Luckyluke23,4,Sun May 24 05:06:49 2015 UTC,Getting famous is a lot difference than developing a career. A lot of entertainers who get fame before they have sharpened their skills can make some money though what does that mean in the long run? It's a strange and uncomfortable predicament. That's why a large percentage of Youtubers and reality TV stars can turn out like pricks that have no appreciation for their situation. I have massive amount of respect for the decision that Alexander made. It's not the easiest decision but I bet it has lead him towards a much better and fulfilling life where he has been able experience so many things that he couldn't have otherwise.
Upvoted,36r7qz,Alexanderr,5,Sun May 24 05:13:50 2015 UTC,"This is true, and it's also the reason child stars often go through such shitty struggles. They weren't mentally prepared for it.  People thrust into the spotlight without doing the crappy side jobs and going through some of the more humiliating aspects of climbing that ladder maybe won't appreciate it quite as much as the people who've worked hard for the opportunities."
Upvoted,36r7qz,Luckyluke23,3,Tue May 26 08:41:57 2015 UTC,"This has probably been one of my favourite podcasts so far, I think /u/Alexanderr did a fantastic job talking about, well, everything. Even though the topics were somewhat wildly different (from acting to masturbation to house fires) I felt like the general format still flowed really well, it didn't feel unnatural to transition from one to the other because the stories you had to tell were just really intriguing and, for lack of a better term, 'immersive' almost. You're a cool guy - don't change pal.  I feel like in some previous episodes, /u/kn0thing has had to narrate a little more than usual and it kind of makes the podcast feel like it's more of a Q&A with a talkshow host rather than a continual story, and that definitely improved tenfold this time round. Great job to everyone involved."

It was really good to hear it discussed from a level headed place. Whereas it didn't necessarily make me subscribe to the beliefs of /r/NoFap , it at least gave me a clearer understanding of what it's readers are trying to achieve. I actually think it would be really cool if there were episodes where other controversial or polarising subs were given this type of treatment, just because its easier to empathise with a human voice than a wall of text.

The ads are relevant to their audience, and I'm usually happy to hear about services that might be potentially useful to me.  What I dislike is highly repetitive adverts (if they had the same exact commercial repeated) or ads that would never be something I'd consider getting (CHECK OUT THIS MINERAL BUTT SCRUB).  Stamps.com sounds like a good deal (I've been thinking about getting it for a while now because I'm lazy and don't like sitting in line at the post office). The offer in the episode is a good coupon offer so I'll probably check it out.  Regarding monetization, it is just entirely necessary otherwise Upvoted wouldn't be possible. The mid-show advert is probably high-impact and brings in the most money which makes recording the episode possible. The Paragon Pod needs that sweet cash."

It sucks but it's the way of the world.  Also, most decent podcast apps (I use Downcast) have a nifty feature whereby you can choose the start and end time of each different podcast. That way the episode always starts after the introductory advert and ends before the ending advert. It's like adblock for your podcasts. However, Upvoted inserts a mid-advert (like a TV show) to get around this feature (some podcasts I listen to also do it).  Anyway, it sucks but without adverts you'd have to pay for the podcast."

It was such an honor to appear on Upvoted by reddit with Alexis Ohanian! /u/ParagonPod was so nice and fun to work with. All around it was an amazing experience!  I'm pretty happy right now. I got to meet such a remarkable human being in person, Alexis Ohanian. He just radiated awesomeness. /u/ParagonPod was awesome and edited the episode beautifully. One of my heroes Tim Ferriss made a surprise appearance in this episode.... and most of all I know that Jarod (/u/edify) would be so happy right now.  Thanks again! Since you have reddit gold now, you can access the episode early in the secret lounge subreddit that might or might not exist.  Here is a current statement that /u/edify's dad has for the reddit community (in his own typed words):   While Jarod was alive he spoke of reddit briefly a few times. But I never heard him enough to look it up. We never knew this side of Jarod until the redditors started making comments with their contributions on GoFundMe. I am still amazed at how many people contributed to help us lay Jarod to rest. I would like to thank everyone for helping us. If I could, I would like to give a hug to everyone. So, here's an e-hug, for helping a disabled Dad bury his son. Thank You, and May God Bless all of You."

Upvoted,36oy3y,ihateirony,9,Thu May 21 21:02:10 2015 UTC,"Really enjoyed the story on being The Suspicious Onlooker. Coming from a background of sex research, though, I was a little disappointed that porn addiction was presented with very little question. While I am by no means an expert on the issue (my focus is on mental health, but moreso on that of sexual minorities), I have seen experts in neuroscience and sexology debate the issue and read their citations and I, along with most other sex researchers, am unconvinced that it is a good model to explain unwanted/problematic porn use/masturbation.  I want to qualify that the reasons our field largely disagrees with the conceptualization of the issues as ""addiction"" is not because we think the issues and experiences of people on /r/NoFap aren't ""real"", as /u/Alexanderr suggested, nor are we all just trolls. It would be hard to claim that there are no people who watch porn to a point that it makes them unhappy and/or interferes with their life. However, there is a complete lack of evidence that there is any reason to conceptualize it as fitting the addiction model, per se. The addiction model claims a causal mechanism for the issues experienced, and the issue taken is specifically with that claim of causality, not whether or not people have the experiences or problems that they have. While it may make sense that your body being ""flooded with chemicals"" from orgasm would result in an addiction, especially when you hear stories from people with unwanted/problematic porn use/masturbation, thus far the empirical evidence simply does not match up to that piece of intuition.  I know that he doesn't care what I think and that he ""knows that it's real"" based on his personal experience and the anecdotal experience of others, but in science we try to know that things are real by testing them, and asking people about their personal experience simply in no way tests whether the model of addiction applies to unwanted/problematic porn use/masturbation use  There is absolutely no means of testing causality of those experiences in the reports of the experiences themselves. Given this, it's more than likely there are a number of underlying causes of unwanted/problematic porn use/masturbation, such as depression, anxiety, poor self control, over zealous religious beliefs, OCD, or any number of other possible explanations that probably differ from individual to individual. We see this with a lot of other unwanted/problematic uses of things. For example, I'm sure we all have known someone who just spends all day playing video games or watching Netflix instead of going out and finding a job like they reportedly value doing and having very similar issues to those in /r/NoFap, but we would never claim that they are literally addicted.  The reason that this is an issue is that there are clinicians that come from an addiction treatment background who stand to gain more clients if they can sell the idea of sex addiction to them, and as such promoting addiction as a model of unwanted/problematic porn use/masturbation allows them to do this. This means that they will then try to treat it as an addiction, rather than exploring and addressing the underlying issues, because if they do explore and address those issues they would then, responsibly, have to send the client to a clinician that has the expertise to actually treat them, and they then lose a client and therefore income. Similarly, some users of /r/NoFap will not have their underlying issues treated if they think their behavior can simply be explained away with addiction.  I do want to re-qualify that this in no way means that there is no reason for /r/NoFap to exist at all, nor does it mean that there is no reason that people should not be able to quit watching porn and/or masturbating if they want to or if it is interfering with their values or lives in some way. Even if quitting it altogether does not directly address the underlying issues per se, the resultant behaviours are a negative consequence of those issues and may be helping maintain them. Indeed /r/NoFap may even inadvertently help treat underlying issues (for example, if stopping porn use means you now have time and boredom which results in you leaving the house, that can treat the depression that caused it in the first place through behavioral activation).  I merely think that it is irresponsible that the subreddit uses the rhetoric it does, not that it exists at all. I think that /r/NoFap could be a good supplement to actual treatment to the underlying issues, but I think that suggesting that unwanted/problematic porn use/masturbation is as simple as some sort of addiction misguides people and I think the subreddit needs to stop doing that. However, it will be very hard to convince them to do this, given that people (unjustifiably) take unwanted/problematic porn use/masturbation more seriously with the addiction model behind it, so addiction as a model is a very useful piece of branding.  However, even if you do subscribe to the supposition of porn addiction being a good model of unwanted/problematic porn use/masturbation, it can still be seen as irresponsible to use that rhetoric as the main explanation of unwanted/problematic porn use/masturbation. The vast majority of humans are able to consume porn without it being unwanted or problematic, so cases of addiction would still be relatively rare and a large number of users of the subreddit would still have underlying issues as the actual cause of their behavior that are not getting treated. So whether you think the model is a good one or not to explain the behavior, there is likely a chunk of people that the rhetoric is doing injustice to.  Edit: typos. It was a long post and early in the morning for me."
Upvoted,36oy3y,Alexanderr,5,Thu May 21 07:58:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your well thought-out response. To be honest, I feel like I'm slightly in ""over my head"" regarding neuroscience and addiction science, and I really appreciate you responding. I'm just a human who removed one variable in their life (porn) and experienced drastic positive results. So now I just help other people do the same thing.  Regardless of if it was an addiction or if the excessive porn-use is an expression of something else (I believe it was an addiction, as I found it extraordinarily difficult to quit, and it negatively impacted my life - I couldn't maintain an erection without fantasizing about porn in my teen years), it doesn't effect my goal of helping people to quit porn. That's all. Was just trying to state that I'm not shutting the doors to NoFap and will continue moving forward, because thousands of lives are being positively changed around the world. I'm happy to examine evidence at it comes in and make adjustments to our content, but I won't stop because of all of the tremendous positive feedback we see from people who have quit porn.  We definitely didn't discuss NoFap at the length that I originally intended to (we had a lot to talk about, and not everything made the cut!). However I have heavily discussed it in many other media outlets. I am enthusiastic about further research on the brain changes associated with excessive porn use (and participate in helping these studies find subjects on /r/NoFap). I am open to all ideas. A large number of mental health professionals acknowledge porn addiction as being a real problem. YourBrainOnPorn.com is an amazing compilation of the information and studies that I would advise anybody who is curious about the subject to check out.  Regarding the ""scientific community"", I was too vague. I was referencing particular people such as David Ley and Nicole Prouse who seem to make careers out of using poor arguments to ""disprove"" the existence of porn addiction.  From our FAQ page:   Rebooting is not a panacea. Do not look to abstaining from PMO to cure your physical, social, or mental ills. If you have other problems that have nothing to do with your sexual habits, they're likely still going to be there when you're done with a reboot."
Upvoted,36oy3y,ihateirony,3,Thu May 21 13:28:51 2015 UTC,"Admittedly I am also somewhat over my head. I'm a psychologist by training, not a neuroscientist, so my knowledge is indeed somewhat limited, although obviously quite a lot of what I have is relevant.  The thing is that a behavior being extraordinarily hard to not do and it interfering with your life is, in my view, insufficient grounds to call it an addiction. This is why we do not call bulimia or pedophilia or self harm or eating unhealthy foods  addictions (and it's notable that some of my examples are considered disorders in and of themselves and some are consequences of other underlying issues). I'd also question whether needing porn to maintain an erection is solely caused by the consumption of porn. Plenty of people consume high volumes of porn without developing erectile dysfunction. It really intrigues me though, as I wonder if it's an interaction of a number of things and I'll be fascinated if that's ever explored in more detail. I'm intrigued as to whether it represents erection issues that result in higher levels of novelty or terstosterone being required for an erection, and if reducing contact with porn (and indeed, sexual stimulation in general) helps with that.  I am glad to hear you're not closing the doors of your sub though, like I say, I am unconvinced of the addiction model, but I think it can be beneficial to quit it, even if I don't think the addiction model applies. ;)  I will try to check out the studies mention on YourBrainOnPorn.com. I notice there's some studies I haven't looked at yet (I last read up on this in 2013). Although admittedly I'm hard to impress with brain scan studies; so many of them use small samples, cast a wide net of hypotheses that result in unreplicatable results and even just sometimes use terrible, inappropriate statistics. They get cited though, and impress people so they're very easy to publish. This is an interesting related, although not directly, article on the topic. I usually prefer a debate format so I can get opinions on both sides, and I usually I find the porn addiction camp to come up short (although amittedly I've only seen Marnia Robinson argue on behalf of the use of the model, and perhaps if a trained scientist did it they may be able to make a better case).  I would say that Ley's a bit broader and tackles sex addiction in general, rather than just porn, and i actually find his arguments quite palatable, but I don't know much about Prouse.  I think it's good that you have a qualifier there, but I don't think that addresses the fact that the use of porn itself may be a product of another issue, if that makes sense?"

Upvoted,35ydpn,______DEADPOOL______,13,Thu Jun 11 11:50:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for this episode...depression and mental illness is something we need to talk about more. Not just in Austrailia but all over the world. It really does need to be de-stigmatized.  I have lived with depression and anxiety since I was 10 years old. In middle school and then again my junior year of high school, I made suicide attempts that fortunately I lived through because I got through half of my plan (take a shitload of drugs) and didn't have the guts to finish it (slit my wrists).  I've been on and off medication for my depression and anxiety for most of my life. For the last few years, I'd been off it and though life had been tough, I thought I was doing fairly ok.  Then the shit hit the fan. Last summer I got pregnant and unfortunately, in September (September 11 to be exact..I will NEVER forget that day. Ever) I found out that my pregnancy had gone tits up. D: I was crushed. For three straight days, if I wasn't asleep, I was sobbing hysterically and six days after I found out that the baby I wanted so much was not going to happen, I had surgery to deal with that issue.   Within a couple of weeks, my husband (erroneously, but trying to help nonetheless) suggested I go back to work, which I did. But within a few days of going back to work, I found myself in the hospital. I'd been getting ready for work when I got hit by what felt like a freight train. I couldn't think. My whole body was shaking and I was crying hysterically, rocking back and forth on the floor clutching a bath towel to my chest and muttering gibberish.   Now my husband (who's been with me almost 20 years to this point, 16 1/2 of them married) didn't know what to do. He called my dr who told him to get my ass to the ER. Which he did. For six hours I continued to rock and cry and mutter gibberish until I was so physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted that I couldn't keep it up any more. The lovely nurse brought me a dose of Ativan and I was, for the first time in several weeks, able to get some sleep.   You see, prior to this, I'd been suffering insomnia pretty much since the day I had my D&C (if you don't know what that is, it's pretty much  the same thing as an abortion only on a dead fetus instead of a live one) I'd been unable to sleep for more than a few minutes at a time. So I'd been dosing myself with Nyquil and Benadryl in order to be able to get some sleep.  It's been a long fucking road back to normal, let me tell ya. I broke because I'd been trying to hold up the world--my husband (who works 80+ hrs a week as a retail mgr), my son (who is special needs, Autism and ADHD and some other stuff besides) and work and trying to keep our small house from going to shit. I'm a Southern girl, so I was raised to suffer in silence with a smile on my face and I just got to a point where I couldn't do it anymore. This really fucking broke me.  Slowly, over the last few months, I've been putting myself back together with a lot of sleep, a lot of reading (because that always helps) and a lot of fucking meditation which makes me feel more...I dunno. Even. Normal. Like if I can shut my brain up for just a few minutes every day, I can get through the things I need to get through. I can survive.  Mental illness is a tough thing to deal with and I hate that it's so stigmatized in this country (USA). It's like supposed to be an embarrassment and I'm not embarrassed to say that I have depression and anxiety. I'm not embarrassed to say that I'm on Lexapro, because it helps keep the darkness from getting too dark and taking over. According to society, I should be horribly ashamed of this and I'm not.  Because I have to be strong. I have to hold up the world. Because if I don't...who will?  EDIT: Whoa. I've been gilded. I feel special. Dankeschoen!"

No big whoop. :)  It's gotten easier to talk about over the years as I've grown to accept that this is part of who I am. I am who I am and I am doing the best I can to make the best of what's been given to me.  Is my life perfect? Oh hell to the no. My family is like a Jerry Springer episode waiting to happen. My son is high special needs and requires a LOT of effort to parent even halfway effectively (which I'm sure that's true of any kid, special needs or not, really). I don't know if he's ever going to develop depression (he already has the anxiety part) but I seriously hope not because depression is hellish to deal with.   Like I said, I've been on and off medication for my anxiety and depression for almost 20 years. Mostly off because I'm the kind of person who doesn't like taking medication if it's something I feel I can deal with on my own. And I really thought I had been doing well until the anxiety/panic attack that sent me to the hospital. The dr's were worried about me...they wanted to put me in the psych ward on a 72 hr hold but there were no beds and since I didn't have a suicide plan, they decided I was safe enough to send home with a prescription for more meds. They advised me to see a psychotherapist,which I did a few times. But talking to a shrink just isn't for me so I quit going and I started meditating which has really really helped. I am doing everything I can, from not watching sad movies or listening to depressing songs to trying to cultivate joy EVERY SINGLE DAY so that I don't get back to that dark point again.

It'll crash the whole phone as well, not just the app. It only happens with this podcast (I listen to around 10 other podcasts and not had issue with them).

Upvoted,35ydpn,lifes_a_glitch,6,Fri May 15 04:46:24 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add to the depression discussion a little. I have been typing and deleting for a bit so I think I will just dive in now as I can't get it right! I think that an overlooked problem with depression is the guilt it can have you feel. I know for me, I was depressed for years and became severely depressed a few years ago. I am not a great conveyer of emotion anyway and find it difficult to talk about my feelings etc, so when I was constantly bombarded by questions of ""are you ok?"" from my Mum it made it worse for me. That isn't a criticism of her, she is a wonderful person and only cared! But I knew that she had been depressed herself before and how upset she would be for me if I actually admitted anything to her. So I became annoyed with her questioning and felt guilty about it! One thing depression does is impair your reasoning. So, while asking someone if they are ok is well and good (and R U Ok etc are great initiatives), I think that you also need to recognise that asking it constantly may not help, or maybe if you see someone ask, you should ask as well yourself when you are 1 on 1. You might be the right person asking. I'm so glad for /u/motivatinggiraffe that you found a way to help yourself in some regard. I think that's brilliant. I went to see a psychologist a few years ago but in the few sessions I went to not once did he ask me anything about what causes may be, his focus was purely on teaching skills that could be used to reduce stress and anxiety. While those things might be helpful, I very much felt that was like learning some basic first aid so that if I get injured in the future I can help myself, but doesn't do much for my broken leg right now! My point is...I'm not sure. Sometimes you just need to work out the fixes for yourself, but some help along the way can be wonderful. Also, asking if someone is ok is more than that question (and doesn't even need a truthful answer), it is an acknowledgement that you care about that person and you will help them if they can tell you how to. So don't be afraid to ask, just maybe don't do it too much ;) Ramble over."

Upvoted,35ydpn,cat_sweaterz,4,Sat May 16 07:29:08 2015 UTC,TL;DR - Slight critique followed by some thoughts about the episode  I maybe spoiled by the likes of RadioLab and anything Gimlet Media does.  I feel like the pacing of the storytelling is a bit slow.  I get that the people sharing their stories aren't professional storytellers so it's reasonable that they might be rambling a bit.  I imagine I would as well.  I think the show's pacing suffers a bit because of it.  And I understand that the fix is more editing which takes more time which could slow down weekly production.  Upvoted is quickly becoming one of my favorite podcasts.  I love the 'meta-ness' of the show and the deeper dive into things that I may notice on Reddit but don't give a second thought to.  Keep up the good work guys.

That style of response but with videos seems a good idea to both produce video content, produce more responses to questions(quicker) and produce something that redditors love.  You could produce IAMAs in that format actively with the community then supercut it into a produced video format for ""reddit original video"" to be released a few days afterwards.  Benefit of doing this is that it gives people a ""finished product"" version of IAMAs. The problem with IAMAs when people stumble across them currently in progress is that they might not come back to them later and miss answers that happened later. The finished video format would include absolutely all questions and answers given."

We asked him if he'd like to tell his story on camera and he agreed.  We're going to meet with him and have him answer some of those great questions on camera.  Then he's going to answer some of the other top-voted questions he didn't get a chance to answer in the original AMA. (I'm dating myself, but the very first AMAs we did with 'famous' people were like this video - there's something really great about hearing someone read ""so, here's a question from lul2488..."").  Then we'll thank him for his time.  We'll produce the video and share it on YT, FB, IG, etc. We'll probably also run some house ads and put on reddit.tv.  And hopefully everyone will love it."

I'd suggest going way beyond just Q&A for formatting.  I've also been around reddit a long time so I remember that.  I also remember when there were no subreddits, mods, or comments and it was mostly articles about programming when I was an undergrad at Georgia Tech.

If they're going to be separate AMAs, courtie's concern is valid.  If they're going to be supplemental to AMAs like the video intros and outros the cooler guests already sometimes do, awesome, but why does reddit need a whole content team for this?  If they're going to be submitting video interviews instead of the AMAs, it might be something to discuss with the /r/IAMA mods first."

Being able to get back in touch with these people, and encapsulate their experience and how reddit has helped is what you guys are good at, and uniquely qualified to do.  Exploring issues of genocide, factory farms, and gender is without a doubt important... but I can get that elsewhere.  It's not unique.  Maybe there is a way to do both, I dunno.

Upvoted,352e9y,Reply_Imposter,1 point,Wed May 6 22:35:27 2015 UTC,"I can see it working for AMAs. But if someone shares a poignant story in an AskReddit thread or something, is the idea that you might track that person down and dig deeper into the story? If so, then it seems like it ultimately has a strong journalistic flavor to it.   There are a lot of responsibilities there, and I think you have to be careful if you're going down that road. Moreover, in AskReddit, the stories are participatory. The stories are made together, in plain view, and shared.   How would your model square with reddit's primarily bottom-up content-creation system? It seems like this would be very top-down, and admins, the filmmakers, or someone else would decide what stories to pursue.   I think it's a very interesting idea for something separate from reddit. If you, as a filmmaker, come across a story, then you should as a documentarian feel free to try and provide more about it. And if someone wants to do that now, they certainly can. By tying it to the website, though, it seems more like the ""they"" are deciding what's important and should be seen, and not the community.   That might be what's concerning people. If we wanted a place with videos that dug deeper into a story, and provided a place with news and information, we have such a place -- the news. The news has an editorial process and a Board, which means that the public at large is not involved, typically, with the endeavor. They are passive consumers. reddit is about active participation, at least from what I've experienced.   Or, is this more like taking something that happened on reddit and following its effects in the real world? Because, I think newspapers also report on that, and perhaps have a less-biased perspective.   All that aside, I did think the short that you guys produced was very nicely done and professional."

Huck talked about a lot of the hate he receives, and I am not sure if it is all just jealousy or fear, although I am sure a lot of it is.  I guess one concern I have is that it sounds like a lot of the hobo lifestyle is still centered around asking for and accepting help from others. Huck talked about getting a bus and going to Alaska, and that sounds cool but should other people really pay for them to do that? I guess I would like to hear more about the community building and charity work Huck says they do.

Right now, we are painstakingly researching hundreds of communities along the way, contacting local citizens that have been spearheading local projects, and asking them directly how we can best help out their community. Whether those tasks are helping dig a ditch for a local farmer, taking care of animals at a local animal sanctuary, helping tutor local kids, helping build houses...literally ANYTHING we can to do to help, no limitations. The community tells us what they need, and we do it. I truly feel that's the most effective and productive way to help out.  Of course, in exchange, I hope that this excursion equally provides a cultural education to Americans and Canadians that aren't fully aware of what other cultures are going through. We, especially Americans, seem to live in a ""shell"" that has socially disconnected the USA from the rest of the countries in the Western Hemisphere. Mexico is America...Argentina is America...Costa Rica is America...Canada is America...in fact, this entire landmass of the Western Hemisphere is AMERICA. The United States has seemingly forgotten that fact, somehow.   Moving on to your other questions:  I've never encountered anyone having any racial problems on the road. I think African-American travelers will encounter many of the same prejudices they experience in normal society, but that's just an inherent problem with American society as a whole, not just travelers. However, my first traveling friend I met on the road was African-American, and I traveled with him for 3 months, and he never encountered any negativity from other travelers.  As far as women, sure, there's definitely a safety risk. I always recommend that female travelers travel with travel partners. There's alot of bums and predators out on the streets, and those people becomes a bit more prevalent when you choose to live on the road...you become much more vulnerable to sexual abuse, getting robbed, etc."

The immediacy of that conversation really struck me because I felt more connected with it having seen the Baltimore Riots discussion happen all over Reddit.    I think it might be interesting to use Upvoted as a platform to hold those dialogs with Redditors. Invite people who spark genuine and rich conversation on the site during the times where.....well where Reddit (and the world for that matter) can be a challenging place. Hear how those comments can create events, dialog, and change.   Keep up the great work team. I love Thursdays.

But don't we all have a time in our lives where we wish we could just put the responsibilities on hold and just deal with fixing ourselves. It seems like both guys did and grew to take on things better in the end. It's a bit of vicarious living to me
Upvoted,34esqu,kylegetsspam,7,Thu Jul 9 13:00:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that, man. For what it's worth, I feel like there aren't always direct ways to take responsibility for one's actions beyond doing what furthers you in life to a level beyond your previous status quo. In itself, such an unorthodox solution can seem like merely 'running away' from things, but work out in the end as a way to get back and tackle that which was previously impossible to tackle."

Perhaps you could use this to entice more people to sign up for reddit so we can connect more people and get even more amazing things on the site.  As an email, it's likely to be forwarded with messages like ""here's this thing I told you about"", for example, and the person who receive the message may not know too much about reddit.  Maybe out something on the footer to tell people what reddit is about.  Also, seeing as reddit is all about the bites, could you incorporate up and down vote arrows next to each ""section"" of the email so that your stats can show how people feel. It wouldn't necassirly have to have a bearing on the actual posts on reddit (because wed obviously want people to actually visit the post) but at least it could help you make Upvoted Weekly into something the community really wants to see - similar to the context of /r/EVEX (which is a really interesting and cool experiment if anybody is interested).

Taking land from people who've managed to organize into some semblance of a state and taking land from people who are not so lucky are both conquests. (I assume you're comparing Armenia and Greece.) Even if war vs internal extermination were different in terms of legitimacy, the distinction is not valid, in this case. You can say the Ottoman Turks killed Armenians inside their own country but went to war with the nation of Greece, but you're forgetting Greece was formed by an armed revolt. The Turks had to be physically removed and forced to cede most of Greece. From the Ottoman perspective, they were fighting a revolt within their lands. And, the Turks were only ensured the rest of the Greek lands after the mass deportations. Their homes were stolen too. And, don't forget the Greeks also suffered genocide. The difference between the Greeks and the Armenians was essentially luck of circumstance (but they started from similar places).   Greece vs Armenia aside, that still doesn't say much Kurdistan.  TL;DR Theft is theft. Giving in on one claim can still bring down the whole house of cards. In either case, the theft suffered by the Armenians wasn't as structurally different from the others as you imply."

I can't understand how the US can go to war in Iraq over false pretenses to save people who are in no real danger just because it meets their plans (to have a monopoly on Iraqi oil for a few years) however they wont do it for a genuine cause like the massacre that is happening to the Rohingya people in Myanmar. I don't want to wake up 30 years from now and have regrets that I stood in silence idly by while people are being massacred and ask my self the question ""what if""? No my people the time is now we must do all that is in our power and bring this issue to the forefront. We must act now before its too late, before we have regrets.  -Ras (EpicMasters)"

The referendum asked the people of Crimea whether they wanted to join Russia as a federal subject, or if they wanted to restore the 1992 Crimean constitution and Crimea's status as a part of Ukraine.  The available choices did not include keeping the status quo of Crimea and Sevastopol as they were at the time the referendum was held. The 1992 constitution accords greater powers to the Crimean parliament including full sovereign powers to establish relations with other states, therefore many commentators argued that both provided referendum choices would result in de facto separation from Ukraine.     The Supreme Council of Crimea considered the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in the 2014 Ukrainian revolution as a coup and the new interim government in Kiev as illegitimate and stated that the referendum is a response to these developments.  The final date and ballot choices were set only ten days before the plebiscite was held. The referendum was regarded as illegitimate by most countries including all European Union members, the United States and Canada because of the events surrounding it  including the plebiscite being held while the peninsula was occupied by Russian soldiers.  Thirteen members of the United Nations Security Council voted in favor of a resolution declaring the referendum invalid, but Russia vetoed it and China abstained.   A United Nations General Assembly resolution was later adopted, by a vote of 100 in favor vs. 11 against with 58 abstentions, which declared the referendum invalid and affirmed Ukraine's territorial integrity.  The Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People called for a boycott of the referendum.    Russia officially recognized the results of the Crimean referendum and claims that unilateral Kosovo declaration of independence has set a precedent, which allows secession of Crimea from Ukraine.  Such parallels are disputed by legal scholars, however.     The official result from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea was a 96.77 percent vote for integration of the region into the Russian Federation with an 83.1 percent voter turnout.   The Mejlis Deputy Chairman Akhtem Chiygoz stated that the actual turnout could not have exceeded 30–40 percent.  In an interview on 22 January 2015 Igor Strelkov admitted that his militia group coerced Crimean deputies to vote in favor of secession from Ukraine.   Following the referendum, The Supreme Council of Crimea and Sevastopol City Council declared independence of Crimea from Ukraine and requested to join the Russian Federation.  On the same day, Russia recognized Crimea as a sovereign state.      Image i     Interesting: Lypky | Kiev Conservatory | Road Control   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

I'm a Turk from Istanbul Turkey. You have no clue how history is taught to us in schools. For example in The Battle of Manzikert (1071) where Seljuk Turks advanced in Anatolia against the Byzantines and Turks started to settle in Anatolia, Anatolia is portrayed as ""vast empty lands where nobody lived in"". Could you believe that? Our history lessons are structured in a way that ""No Turk can do any bad thing"". History is great propaganda tool. I really don't know how to change that. My parents feel like disowning me when I bring up this subject to them. You got to believe me that Turkey is in an overall confusion and transition like Lara said.   I think everybody is missing the point that the ruling party at the Ottoman Empire at that time, Committee of Union and Progress was responsible of organizing the insidious actions that resulted in genocide. Today everyone says that the Nazi Party and Adolf Hitler is responsible for The Holocaust, not The Germans. I think the same approach should be applied in the Armenian Genocide.   I apologize for the genocide that is committed under the rule of Committee of Union and Progress Party in the name of my successor country and nation. I feel for you. I hope dialogue and empathy will bring the two nations closer."

I know the Turk stereotype in the internet doesn't seem like an open-minded researcher type but some of us are.   The problem is that the current Turkish government is denying what happened.    It's more about the fact that current government wants to seem strong to Turkish people so they don't want to even talk about this matter. Confirming the genocide and apologizing to another country who has been hostile to the Turks in the past isn't the definition of strong.  To me it feels like our ancestors who lived in the Eastern Anatolia were trying to protect their territory but then i don't know why and how but they started to kill every Armenian they found alive and this is the point when they past the border. I know that my government should apologize but i expect the same behaviour from the Armenian government.  Think about it, if the United States goes into a war which they can't possibly win and the Chinese people(just a random example) who lives in the United States starts a rebellion and starts to fighting with the local forces/civilians with the weapons they got from the PRC, what would you do? Natural behaviour is fighting back, protecting your lands and people and this act doesn't involve any fault, unnatural behaviour is killing all of them and this act involves a big fault but this fault comes from another one and if they're going to apologize so should the other side.  Just my thoughts on this matter."
Upvoted,33lp53,satellizerLB,2,Tue May 26 00:05:52 2015 UTC,"That's actually what happened in the US during WWII. The Japanese-Americans were relocated to concentration camps because the Americans thought that the Japanese would start a rebellion. Most of the Japanese lost their properties, but they were resettled after the war. And the concentration camps weren't all that bad; they were more like isolated communities. What happened to Armenians was somewhat similar, except they weren't to be relocated. More like exterminated, cleansed from the Ottoman Empire. People don't wanna believe that their ancestors could commit such atrocities, but this actually happened. But not only Turks committed mass-scale killings that were intended to wipe out a certain religious or ethnic group. Look at the Christians. From around 1100 to 1300, there were several crusades through Asia. Back then, common people believed that the military is actually going to the Muslim countries to liberate them from their ""wrong"" religion, when in fact (and this has been researched the fuck out) the crusades were actually mass-scale robberies and murder. The same thing with Turks and Armenians. Shit, both groups had religious beef going on since forever. And the Turks saw an opportunity to take what was not theirs. But that's history. I'm sure many ancestors of Armenians had participated in crusades and other shameful acts. Now, though, it's different. Turkey has a new government and still continues to portray Armenians as traitors and liars. There has to be a change.  Also, the only countries denying the Armenian Genocide are Turkey and Azerbaijan, which is basically Turkey's little sister. And there are 27 Western countries with good records of human rights (unlike Turkey and Azerbaijan) that recognized the event as genocide.  politics is so weird"

They usually portray anyone except them and their supporters as traitors and liars. In the past there was a Armenian terrorist group named ASALA killing Turkish people so i get why the older governments didn't accept anything we did. I don't know much about ASALA though but you can find further info from here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Secret_Army_for_the_Liberation_of_Armenia I believe our government shoud at least talk with Armenian government in these matters now that terrorism ended."

Also, I was raised Christian. But I am a grown man now. I don't believe in any God, nor any other deity. I don't believe anything people just tell me. Like you, I do my research. I've been on Turkish websites that promote the denial. I actually read their argumentation and their presentation of evidence. But what I noticed is the proud nationalism on every Turkish website. It is widespread in Turkey to believe that Turks are special, not like others. A ""glorious"" nation could not commit genocide and get rich from it, right?  Then, there are the Armenian sources that portray themselves as victims. But unlike Turkish sources, Armenians do mention the secret armies they had to form. Rather then be a victim, the Armenian nation tried to fightback, but failed miserably to resist. The nmain argument of Turks states that it was a war, sinceboth sides suffered. I believe that it is true that both sides suffered, but the number of Armenians that ended up dead by 1923 was orders of magnitude greater than Turkish losses.

To me, it started as a local war indeed, but in the end it wasn't a war at all. There are some quotes of Enver Pasha, a well known official of the Ottoman Empire's government of that time, stating they killed many Armenians while traveling them to Syria. Not that they died of starving or something, he is stating that they killed them. That's not war, far from it.  Today Enver Pasha is being portrayed as a traitor in our history lessons. Maybe the reason for this is to deny the genocide, i don't know.

I knew nothing about the Armenian Genocide before listening to this episode, and there are many basic aspects of it that I still don't know.  One example is when the Armenian Genocide is compared to the Holocaust /u/kn0thing mentions how many people were killed in the Holocaust but not the Armenian Genocide.  Also, when speaking with Lara the conversation just jumps back and forth between the genocide and Syria.  It wasn't until someone say something about ""diaspora"" that I realized that Syria must be important in relationship to the Armenian Genocide, because that is where the Armenians fled to.  Maybe that isn't even right, but it was not apparent to me in the episode.   I'm honestly not even opposed to episodes being structured this way if that's what you want to do.  I just want to let you know that it was confusing for listeners that don't know about the subject."

As a jew currently living in Israel, I am very upset at my country's decision to not recognise the Armenian genocide. It's amazing to me how a country fighting so hard against holocaust denial can deny another nation's genocide for political reasons. I have heard my grandma, a holocaust surviver which has also immigrated to the USA (and later on to Israel), talk many times of her anger at the hypocrisy of the continuing denial of the Armenian genocide by our government.   Thankfully they are organisations and political parties in Israel fighting for recognition of the genocide. The ""Meretz"" party has been at the head of the fight for recognition for years. They're current head Zehava Galon said this two weeks ago, after the pope recognised the Armenian genocide:   Recognition of the genocide is not defiance against the Turks, and is not a diplomatic bargaining chip for Israel's foreign relations. It is just the right thing to do.    The Israeli ""Combat Genocide"" organisation is also a big fighter for recognition, and is organising a petition which many great Israeli figures have signed.  Remembering and acknowledging history is critical.  A week before hitler marched into Poland and slaughtered millions of Poles and jews he said this to the nazi army commanders:    Who, after all, speaks to-day of the annihilation of the Armenians?   I am full of hope that in the near future this important fight will prevail and that Israel and the US (which I'm also citizen of) will follow other countries around the globe and finally recognise the Armenian genocide."

My grandmother on my father's side lost all but two of her siblings, and my grandfather on my father's side fought with the Norwegian forces during the war.  The first time I encountered the Armenian Genocide was in the Old City of Jerusalem about fifteen years ago, where, across the Armenian quarter, there are posters and plaques commemorating the atrocities committed, and calling it what it was; a genocide.  As a Jew, growing up with the holocaust as part my family story, the wealth of information about the particulars has been important to my understanding, and I am grateful that my grandmother recorded her memories for posterity through the Survivors of the Shoah project.  I think it is important to those of us with that backstory that, rather than try to shield our children, we tell them about it, and remember not only the tragedy, but also the joy of the other memories. A common saying among Jews states that shared joy is doubled, and shared sorrows are halved.  It has been my experience that growing up as part of a minority makes it easier for me to relate to the struggles of other minorities, and that is an experience I think everyone should have.

Specially, I have always wondered (as an American without a deep knowledge of these things) what an American acknowledgement of the genocide would mean. In other words, I had been wondering why, right now, 100 years after the genocide when it would be politically safe for Obama to acknowledge the genocide (well, safer than it would have been during the cold war, say) would an acknowledgement matter? Your grandfather explained so plainly and beautifully why it WOULD matter, that I feel slightly ignorant? Callous? for even wondering such a thing. Of course, we have to speak out about injustices and acknowledge the victims and acknowledge the crimes against victims, not just as a process of forgiveness and as a proper recording of history, but to give the victims (and their descendents) the honor and value and respect that we give the powerful who, too often, are the oppressors.   Even if it does become politically feasible and even politically expedient to acknowledge the 20th century's first genocide, that acknowledgement still counts for something to the victims.   Thanks.

With events happening in Syria and Iraq, that is to say the confrontation between Sunni and Shiite, or rather one between Saudi Arabia and Iran and consequently, the massacre of Christians, your government will sooner or later engage in a moral position.

This was a very one-sided episode -I mean guys three Armenians and no one else.   However, I am not writing to point out this obvious stuff about them being biased and ever present conflict of interest. I am writing about the people I've met and lived with, the people in my family and the things that I have experienced as a Turkish man in the Republic of Turkey.   First of all, my mother's family used to live in a area that in Ottoman time had a good amount of Armenian population. Therefore, I was able to learn a lot from their passed down experiences.   My grandmother was telling stories of how Armenians would come and torture the Muslim households, not every Armenian though. She told me when she was still alive that she almost got raped by an Armenian when she was a little girl and how another Armenian man and their Turkish neighbor helped save her. She said how the Armenian nationalists would kill anyone even close to helping Turks. She said that the Armenian doctor that came to their relative's house to treat him was tortured and killed in the village square. Therefore, it is clear why they left their home and neighbors and fled to a place that has a greater majority of Turkish population.   These two instances are the two that I can write here without throwing up inside and there are many more darker ones that would make everyone feel ashamed of being human. That being said, my mother has heard even more real life experiences from my grandmother.  When we were living in Istanbul, we had old Armenian couple as our neighbors and despite what my grandmother experienced, we never hated them, in fact, we loved and helped them as much as we could. For instance, our neighborhood would have a bazaar on a street nearby on Thursdays and the Armenian Lady would do her home's grocery shopping there but, she and her husband was living on the third floor and the apartment was rather historical and lacking an elevator. So whenever my parents would see her they would send me and my siblings to help carry her stuff. But this was a minor thing we did compared to what my mother has done.   My mother is a doctor and back then she was the assistant dean of medicine of a very busy hospital in Istanbul. The year before we moved from that apartment, the Armenian lady got very sick and bedridden. For months my mom accompanied her through her treatment, helped her in her house, cooked food for her and her husband until her death which made everyone of us sad. And my mother is the daughter of the grandmother that I mentioned above, you know the one that almost got raped by Armenians.   Moral of this story and its lesson is left to you the reader. If you are bigoted this won't do you good so keep on looking at the other writing on this page that conforms your beliefs. But if you are open minded, you will see it through."

Really interested to know if the above story took place before or after the invasion. but i can guarantee that the choice to invade didn't exactly happen overnight. just like many of the ongoing wars/massacres we have going on today. Palestine/Israel since the 40s. Iraq war, and all the side effects well over 10 years now that has led to great secular battles, and gave birth to several extremest groups that are continuing their raids in the region till today. In such subject matters, both sides are at fault, violence breeds violence. this blame is not for the people to inherit or either side to take, but the bloody politicians who led their own people to doing the act. I am an Armenian, never had anything against Turks, those that i have met have been great friends. we both agree on one thing though, those politicians are segregating the world for their own personal gains. so if you are Turkish, or Armenian, don't hate your neighbor, that's the person you live and grow with regardless of who they are. hate the corrupt leaders who caused the bloodshed in hopes that their so called name lives on, or to becoming powerful, or to ensure their financial gains for eternity. pitting brother against brother. we need to unite, we are more powerful together than alone.

You can go ahead with your personal stories and try to downplay it as a massacre or some sort, and I can talk about my personal stories and say it was a genocide.    Fact of the matter is, when looked at objectively, it was a genocide.  And you know which country has clear as day evidence in their archives as this being a genocide?  USA.    The problem is America obviously won't accept genocide as good relations are very important with a key ally in that region.  They can lose a lot just to please such a minority of Armenians who live in America."

The Ottoman Empire had committed similar massacres, expulsions, forcible conversions, kidnappings and enslavement of all of their occupied populations for hundreds of years and you've got very little case to make them out to be a victim. Why do you focus solely on atrocities committed against the Ottomans whilst completely refusing to take responsibility for their atrocities against others? They were an EMPIRE and were hardly an innocent victim, it's impossible to count the millions of Slavs kidnapped by their Crimean puppets and cosigned to slavery within the empire nor those kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam as children.

Rummel at least 128,000 Muslims were killed by Russian and Armenian troops/irregulars during the war.[59] During January–February 1918 some 10,000 Muslims were killed in Erzincan and Erzurum by retreating Armenian troops.[58]  Franco-Turkish_War[edit]  Main article: Franco-Turkish War  Cilicia was occupied by the British after World War I, who were later replaced by the French. The French Armenian Legion armed returning Armenian refugees of the Armenian Genocide to the region and assisting them. Eventually the Turks responded with resistance against the French occupation, battles took place in Marash, Aintab, and Urfa. Most of these cities were destroyed during the process with large civilian suffering. In Marash, 4.500 Turks died.[60] The French left the area together with the Armenians after 1920.

Upvoted,334fbq,BBBelmont,6,Sun Apr 19 13:14:27 2015 UTC,"Similar to multi reddits, could you bucket your own? I.e. TV Shows I watch, Sports leagues and teams I follow, Fantasy Novels and literature, etc."

Upvoted,334fbq,schumaga,35,Sun Apr 19 14:21:07 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, I expected something a bit more in-depth. Also, that Charmander meme and all following posts were cringe-worthy and don't belong on a newsletter."
Upvoted,334fbq,dashed,5,Mon Apr 20 09:57:37 2015 UTC,Heh. No kidding.   The top five posts from /r/bestof in the past week would've been better choices in the newsletter: https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/top/?sort=top&t=week
Upvoted,334fbq,modestmoos,-15,Sun Apr 19 13:16:00 2015 UTC,Like more content or more depth on the same quantity of stories?
Upvoted,334fbq,schumaga,23,Sun Apr 19 13:48:36 2015 UTC,"More content would be wonderful. Maybe you could have a list of general topics that you cover every week (serious, funny, ""reddit makes a difference in the real world"", educational, AMA) and these posts could come from any subreddit as long as the post is on topic.  The best thing you could do is not include stuff like the Charmander post. Stuff that's already gone sort of viral has probably been seen by most of us already. I would appreciate you including more ""quality"" posts that have not quite gained the same traction yet. If you post mostly things that have already made it to the top of a subreddit, non-reddit-users will love it, but it adds no value for people who are already on the site because we came across it when it was upvoted in the first place. Unless, of course, you can go more in depth into the story but that seems to be the goal of the podcast and I think it should stay that way.  Also, it would be awesome if you could include posts from more obscure subreddits. That way, we would be seeing posts we wouldn't normally see and we'd be exposed to new subreddits that we wouldn't have found otherwise. In order to accomplish this, without you having to spend your entire life on reddit (I'm sure it's already close to that), maybe you could open up a ""consider this for inclusion"" submission form or subreddit, where people can give you a heads up on the less popular subreddits' great posts.  Hope you find this feedback more helpful than whiny."
Upvoted,334fbq,diyod,10,Sun Apr 19 14:44:00 2015 UTC,"I think the key here is better content. None of things you picked for this week's newsletter is particularly interesting or worth discussing, except the net neutrality in India story, which I believe you should have expanded upon. I think you should cover stuff that is genuinely interesting and generates discussion. Another idea would be to highlight a small/medium-sized reddit community each week, a la /r/subredditoftheday.  Of course this doesn't mean cutting off funny content entirely, you can keep it because it won't be much work to post some funny images or interesting pics. But you can pick 2/3 things every week (like an interesting AMA, a story from /r/WritingPrompts, an interesting /r/AskHistorians thread, etc.) and go a little more in-depth.   Just my opinion anyway. On a different note, the design is great!"
Upvoted,334fbq,-dudeomfgstfux-,6,Sun Apr 19 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that the first issue was very good and included things that I missed which is exactly what I was hoping for. However, I was hoping for more of an overall summary than just a teaser paragraph designed to get cluckthroughs. Maybe more of the community's response, top comments for each post (or most guilded comments if you want to casually plug reddit gold). Overall I think this newsletter is a great idea, reddit is increasingly hard to keep up with and I'd love something that kept me up to date with the current culture."
Upvoted,334fbq,-dudeomfgstfux-,8,Sun Apr 19 15:15:13 2015 UTC,"Very cool, the layout is nice. I would just put the number of upvotes to the left and the number of comments to the right.   Any ideas to make the same for specifics subreddit or a personalized selection ? :)"

Upvoted,334fbq,TristanCorb,7,Sun Apr 19 13:18:37 2015 UTC,"I love the layout, that shouldn't change as much. I think you should embed feature and add some of the interesting top comments.

Edit: Thanks so much for the gold! So this is what it fees like"

I was expecting more content from a newsletter though, that would be good. Also, some more stories from non defaults would be appreciated. If you needed people from smaller, more niche subreddits to chime in threads that they deem feature worthy, I and many others would obviously be willing to contribute from the places we browse.  I'd like if I could access this via reddit, maybe on this sub, as we all browse reddit and it seems a tad nonsensical to have to leave reddit to go to my email to view reddit content, but maybe that's just me"
Upvoted,334fbq,DNZe,4,Sun Apr 19 20:26:35 2015 UTC,"I gotta say I liked the design and the overall idea, but i'd hoped for something more similar to the podcast, more in depth.

Upvoted,334fbq,wicro,4,Sun Apr 19 21:25:08 2015 UTC,"You have to figure that if someone is going to ""opt-in"" to Reddit's weekly news letter that s/he has mastered the basics of navigating thru the many subreddits and uses RES.

Perhaps add a small section for ""discovery"" every week where you highlight lesser know subreddits or submissions that didn't make it to the frontpage but are still interesting? Other than that I'd keep it this way."
Upvoted,334fbq,Blittzzo,3,Sun Apr 19 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could use this to entice more people to sign up for reddit so we can connect more people and get even more amazing things on the site.  As an email, it's likely to be forwarded with messages like ""here's this thing I told you about"", for example, and the person who receive the message may not know too much about reddit.  Maybe out something on the footer to tell people what reddit is about.  Also, seeing as reddit is all about the bites, could you incorporate up and down vote arrows next to each ""section"" of the email so that your stats can show how people feel. It wouldn't necassirly have to have a bearing on the actual posts on reddit (because wed obviously want people to actually visit the post) but at least it could help you make Upvoted Weekly into something the community really wants to see - similar to the context of /r/EVEX (which is a really interesting and cool experiment if anybody is interested).  I hope this gives you some ideas in ways to improve something that's looking very promising already. Nice work!"

Upvoted,32t8ty,SushiRoe,7,Thu Apr 16 20:58:46 2015 UTC,"This episode had me smiling throughout. I remember reading the thread and seeing the pictures of the doge car. I thought it was one of the funniest moments on reddit. I can only imagine the viewers watching that race seeing that car and their reactions. All those corporate sponsorship logos plastered on their cars and here comes a funny looking shiba. Here's Dale Earnhardt Jr's view of the dogemobile.   Also, having Josh explain some of the intricacies of Nascar was great. I know it was more complicated than turning left, but came away with a lot more respect for the sport, especially the underdogs that do not have as much funding. I think it's unfair that a sport places so much influence on sponsorship funds to be competitive. Props to Josh and his team and the best of luck to them in their future races."

So I am at least aware of the costs involved in motorsport. Getting that level of sponsorship for $55,000 is absolutely insane, given the high cost of motorsport.  But more importantly, when the story of how they pulled off the money raising aspect I welled up slightly. I am not entirely sure why, but the idea of a community coming together to support a driver who they felt deserved more than he was getting, and allowing him to achieve all that he did makes me really happy to be a human.   I also like anything that sticks two fingers up at the establishment and /r/dogecoin managed to do that in spades. Extremely impressed with Josh and that community."

Even on pasture, we have similar losses due to heart failure and leg problems.  We also can see the ""bed sores due to the chickens not wanting to move.  Many pasture based systems are caged systems, putting 50-100 chickens in a 8x12 ""chicken tractor"" that gets moved 1x - 2x daily.  The birds the consumers want to eat are meat birds.  Those genetically chickens who have enormous breasts.  They have been bred to grow fast, with large breasts, minimal feathering, and insane feed to weight conversion.  They are efficient as fuck.  And disgusting to raise.    I had access to an affluent market of ""socially and ecologically conscious"" people.  I pushed hard to have them buy my regular chickens who lived out with the cows for 28 weeks, scratching through cow patties, free ranging, and acting like chickens.  THEY DID NOT WANT THEM.  Not enough breast, not enough meat, too much bone, funny color meat.  Those chickens cost me almost nothing to raise and I passed that savings on to the consumer.  I gave the chickens just enough feed to make them go in their houses at night.  They were certified organic, free range, humanely and sustainably raised, and the consumer did not want them.  The consumer gets what they want.  I did a couple years of meat chickens, and as lucrative as it was, I stopped.  Screw those foodies.  People want what they want.  They want to believe the lies so they can feel good about themselves.  But if it takes some actual work, some developing new tastes, some going without, they act like it's too hard.  /end rant  With that said:  Enjoying your all's podcasts.

Upvoted,320b0w,MarkBC,5,Thu Apr 9 17:11:06 2015 UTC,"None of them are.  You have to go to a local, small farmer to find chickens that are not being abused.  Your 'cage free', 'humane', 'natural', 'grass fed' doesn't mean shit.  All animals produced for supermarkets and quick-serve/fast food/most restaurants are kept in deplorable conditions.  It is impossible for the industrial production on the scale we currently see for cows, pigs and poultry to ever become humane.  Impossible.  Americans need to cut WAY down on the amount of meat they eat if they don't want animals to be abused anymore.  Also, not only will it save the environment but it is healthier for you too."

But 40-50% from households is insane- that's Grade A food that people just let go to waste due to poor planning.  Source A B  I used to be terrible about this in college. I would buy bulk meat (10 lb bags of chicken, turkey, whatever), freeze it, and forget about it for a year until I moved apartments, and then it would go straight in the trash alongside tons of other food.

The point I'm getting is that is that just because in one country that makes up 5% of the world's population set a bunch of standards around the nebulous, hard to define term, does not mean that we have an agreed upon definition, for the three reasons of (a) that country only being a small portion of the world, (b) a definition for industry not necessarily matching and scientific concept and (c) standards are based on a definition, they aren't the definition themselves.  Edit: clarity and large expansion"

So a ""definition"" is a moot point.  The US federal government says what is and what isn't ""organic"".

Essentially, I think there are no benefits, but I'm open to the possibility of there being some.

One of the legal standards for organic farming is no sewage sludge. That's not a rule for conventional farming. It's considered permissible for conventional non organic farming and is common practice.

Even if one out of the patchwork of rules for organic happens to be true, I don't want to reinforce the notion that the concept of organic food is a coherent or collectively useful one, so I would rather source I'd rather save money unless the evidence suggests actually relevant effect size and spend my time worrying about things that have evidence-based effects on health, like nutrition."

Upvoted,320b0w,Spinjuleeano,9,Fri Apr 10 18:18:14 2015 UTC,"Love these podcasts dearly, they make my thursday every week.   I worked in a grocery store in Canada for many years and was always extremely interested when it came to the truths and fads of the food industry. I mainly worked in the produce department, so I saw all flocks of ""superfoods"" (Acai, Goji Berries etc) that were sold as well as the organic farming phase. This story had to remind me of organic farming. Not to knock organics, but the truth of the matter remains the same with chicken. In order to be certified organic in Canada, you have to meet a certain standard including no adding of antibiotics (fair enough) but also no vitamin supplements, animal biproducts and so forth. For chicken, ""organics"" is pretty much a lie in Canada as it's illegal to put any heavy duty hormones or antibiotics in it (Source)   In fruit/vegetable farming...I respect organic farming because of the amount of effort put in, but it is not feasible. ""It has been estimated, that, at most, organic farming practices can feed 4 billion people. We have passed that already"" (Source)   All in all, what it comes down to is money. People will rarely pay 10 dollars extra for high grade, properly treated poultry when they can have similar tasting chicken for a lower price just by looking the other way. It's the sad truth I struggled with for most of my working life, but I've come to grips with it.   P.S Alexis: Ian McKellen reading as Magneto? I would much rather be read to by GANDALF!!! Too bad they're not the same person or anything....  TL;DR: Organics and Free Run/Well treated chicken are right by the environment...but not sustainable for how many people we have living on earth. Not to mention the crazy costs we'd have to endure to buy these types of food.   Also, long live Gandalf the Grey. The end."

Even though this episode was not at all about that, I must say, I really enjoyed this podcast.   As a business guy (who has an MBA in Marketing) I've always found the food industry especially interesting. It's so bizarre to me that we, as consumers, are, on the whole, sheepish enough to just believe what's written on packaging even though we know it's marketing trying to get us to buy their product.   The industry (marketing) has basically devolved to this weird dichotomy of lying by telling the truth. That is, saying something that is technically true in an attempt to make yourself seem different even though your claim is true of your competition. Like the ""Cage Free"" thing, if I were to start a cereal brand I could say something like, ""Laziejim O's, the best tasting asbestos free cereal on the market!"" Sure it would be true, but I would be telling the truth in an attempt to deceive.  But enough about that, great episode folks!

I know that not everyone has this flexibility, but I (and others) do... and if I can vote with my dollar, I will.  The fact that Whole Foods has a rating system to help consumers make a choice is fantastic, I never knew.  I will definitely start buying my chicken there.

They are then ground up and made into food to be fed to the other chickens.  Sadly, you cannot get anything humane from a factory or mass-producing farm. Unless you have chickens in your backyard, every time you buy eggs or egg products, you are contributing to the death of a countless number of baby chicks. Also the chickens that lay your eggs, because they will be killed after about 2 years, when their life span is 8-10, even 20 years.   Milk and meat are a very different, even worse, story.

Most farmer's markets have eggs from backyard hens. I raise backyard hens myself, and so I know for a fact my hens are well-treated and healthy. (And so the ""you cannot get anything humane"" part of your argument isn't at all accurate). The chickens cost me $7 each. I feed them about $20 in grain a month plus scraps of vegetables. It's super simple. Most cities allow you to keep hens in the backyard.  It's not easy necessarily, but it's not what I would consider hard. And, again, you can get backyard eggs at most every farmer's market I've been to.  For future reference, if you see that someone has posted in favor of humanely gotten eggs in a discussion thread about animal cruelty, it's probably safe to assume that the person has some understanding of commercial agriculture."
Upvoted,320b0w,Octavia9,2,Thu Apr 9 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"Those hens you paid $7 for were likely raised by people who do, in fact, dispose of male chicks by grinding them alive or by burying them alive.  It sounds gruesome, but it is, unfortunately, the industry standard. Otherwise there would be tons of unwanted roosters. Broiler chickens and laying chickens are not the same, and therefore, male chickens from the laying variety never become grown, since they have no value to the producers.  Since you purchased from these producers, you have supported their industry and their practices."

He is still with us, crowing every morning.   And what is with you people assuming I support ""industry?"" Jesus christ. I live in the middle of nowhere in Mississippi.

Upvoted,320b0w,PounderMcNasty,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:04:52 2015 UTC,"I did read what you said, and I do agree that some people can have access to humanely-raised eggs. But for those people who don't have a farmer's market or are unable to raise their own chickens, there's really no way for them to get humane eggs. If it's mass produced enough to be on a store shelf, it can't be humane.  But about you disagreeing with being able to get humane animal products, my original statement stands. By nature, there is no such thing as humane milk or meat. Eggs are different because chickens lay then naturally; whether you take them or not, they'll lay them.  But milk and meat are different. Cows, like every other mammal, only produce milk when they have just had a baby. So when you drink milk, you're drinking milk meant for a baby calf. No farm can have a cow have a calf and allow it to stay with it's mother; it is either sent to live for a few months and then killed for veal, or it is yanked away from it's mother to be another dairy cow, and the cycle continues. Also, a cow's average life span is 20. Every dairy cow is killed around 6 years old if they're ""lucky"". So again, by definition, cow milk is not humane, since the only way to get it is to steal it from an animal that is trying to give it to their baby. When you drink cow's milk, you contribute to the death of calves and the cows themselves. There is no need for cow milk in our society when we have so many options that are more sustainable, healthier, and more ethical.  Hopefully I don't need to go into meat hahaha"
Upvoted,320b0w,kn0thing,2,Thu Apr 9 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"I have no idea where all this about meat and milk comes from. I didn't mention either of those things and you should stay on topic in these exchanges.  Listen, it's clear you're passionate about this, but it is offensive for you to assume that A.) I am a moron (as your first response seems to indicate or B.) That I do not care about the welfare of animals.  Besides the fact that I'm a vegetarian and consider myself intelligent, I highly suspect that your posts come off as generally condescending and offensive to people who choose to eat meat.  It's not for you or me to judge what people eat. Advocate for legal remedies (better conditions in slaughterhouses, etc) or talk to your friends about these issues, but coming onto these forums and acting holier-than-thou in defense of animals and also by pointing out commonly known facts of industrial ag is irritating to the general masses, I would think."
Upvoted,320b0w,caross,3,Thu Apr 9 21:31:08 2015 UTC,"oh, man i'm sorry if i came across that way. I really didn't mean to. I don't think it's off topic though? This podcast was about getting humane animal products. I know you were talking about eggs, but when using the term humane it's important, I think, to make sure people know that milk and meat could never be humane.   But uh again, I really didn't mean to sound preachy or condescending, nor did I even intend to imply that you weren't intelligent. My apologies for offending you. I try my best to just sound like a normal person when talking about these things, as preachy is the last thing I want to come across as. Try reading this in a 20-year-old girl voice who's scarfing down on chocolate chip cookies... because that's me lol  I also don't judge others, but it's important to discuss things that are well... bad. And eating meat requires others to die, so I would certainly say it's bad. Again I'm not judging those who do, but I don't think this is a case of ""oh i'll do my thing and you do yours"". That applies to like... me liking apple juice and you liking soda, or me liking green and you liking blue. Nobody, no animals, are hurt by those things. But eating animals is more on par with slavery, because it affects the ones being killed for meat,  or used as slaves. So like, if I saw a slave owner, I couldn't be like ""oh yeah i won't have slaves, but you'll have slaves, and that's cool. live and let live."" because it isn't. It isn't cool. Being a slave isn't fun, nor is being an animal raised for the sole purpose of being killed years before your lifespan. My motto is, if it doesn't hurt people, the planet, or animals, I don't care what you're doing. Drink soda instead of tea, wear a dress instead of a polo, I don't care. But as soon as you impede on the rights of others, what you're doing isn't your own ""personal"" opinion. You can't just choose to eat meat, just like you can't just choose to kill someone, or choose to rape someone. It stops being personal when someone else is effected! And animals are someones, too, and you need to think about their say in the matter lol  You can still be respectful of people while saying hey, this is wrong. I don't judge what people eat, and I don't judge them, either. Nor do I think I'm better than them. But just like speaking out about racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. it's important to speak out for animals. And if someone hadn't spoke out about the wrongness of meat around me, I may have never changed, and I'm really glad I did."

The mothering instant has been bred out and the cows produce often more milk than four calves can consume.  These cows and their calves need us.  The calf left with its mother would quickly become ill for receiving too much milk.  The cow would become engourged, get mastitis and possibly die.  We separate them to keep them both healthy and within hours and frequently right away both sides forget.  It's a symbiotic relationship. Dairy cattle would become extinct without human care.  The cows love us as much as dairy farmers live their cows.  Calling it cruel and inhumane just shows me you know nothing about our industry."
Upvoted,320b0w,clemm55,5,Sun Apr 12 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly dude I'm pretty tired because I just got back from a trip, and I really rather not have to go through your paragraph and list all the things wrong with it. I'm going to be quick about this, and anyone who wants to know more about this should look it up because I'm not going fully into it.   people have cared for dairy cattle for thousands of years.   I'm sorry but that literally means nothing to me; plenty of people have been doing wrong things for ""thousands of years"". Slavery, racism, sexism, homophobia... all been going on for thousands of years. That is an absolute garbage excuse to keep doing something.   The mothering instant has been bred out   I have never heard this before, even from other farmers I've talked to. I've read article after article about people who live near dairy farms that are kept awake by crying mother cows. I've heard of mother cows on farm sanctuaries hiding their calves from the caretakers because they think it'll be taken away like it was when they were on a farm. How do you ""breed"" out mothering instinct?? I mean I'm honestly curious about this because from what I know about breeding, adaptation, and evolution, that makes 0 sense. That's like saying you bred out their need for food and water. Maybe you're thinking of cows that have had mulitple babies taken away? I hear that after a few years of their calves been taken away, mother cows learn that they'll be taken away and they give up fighting for them.   The calf left with its mother would quickly become ill for receiving too much milk. The cow would become engourged, get mastitis and possibly die.  Dairy cattle would become extinct without human care.    Dairy cows are bred to have huge, unnatural, and uncomfortable udders. Thats why they produce so much milk. Do you honestly believe wild cows needed humans to come and milk them? This is because of human breeding. Breeding unhealthy animals and then claiming you bred them to help them... is nonsensical. The world does not need dairy cows and it isn't fair to them in the slightest to breed them. Inability to survive without human care is a sign of a weak species. Just cruel.   The cows love us as much as dairy farmers live their cows.   Correct me if I'm wrong but... doesn't Bessie go to the slaughterhouse when you're done with her? And isn't that after 6 years at the most, when their life span is 20? How does that even come close to resembling ""love""?? You don't kill and eat things you love. You don't raise creatures you love for the sole intent of exploiting and killing them. That isn't love.  If that was love, I would have taken my 15 year old cat to be butchered years ago. I would be breeding my dog every year, drinking her milk, and eating her puppies. My parrot would have been eaten as soon as he was plump enough.   I understand cows are a monetary investment for you, but please do not try to disguise it as love. They are walking, mooing money in your eyes.   It's a symbiotic relationship.   Not it is not. In a symbiotic relationship, both partners gain something from the relationship. If you kill and hurt the partner, it is a parasitic relationship.   Calling it cruel and inhumane just shows me you know nothing about our industry.   I live in farm land. I've seen farms. I've talked to farmers. I've researched farms. Ever thought maybe you've got bias about this industry because you... work in it? If it's your job and livelihood and how you get money, you're gonna put your blinders on and think all of this is okay when it really, truly, is not. The world does not need cow's milk; it's bad for humans, pollutes the earth, it's unsustainable, wastes water, takes insane numbers of food, and hurts animals. One cup of milk takes 20 gallons of water to produce.   I am very sorry if I come across as attacking you but I would encourage you to really question the things you've grown up to believe. I understand if your parents were in this trade and their parents, and so on. It can be hard when everything you've ever been taught is false. It can be uncomfortable, but you really can't act like all the things you said were facts, when every single one has been at the very least, debatable.  If you truly do not believe any of the facts I have just stated, feel free to look them up! There are many resources and reading materials on the internet. While I do not expect this conversation to change your views, I encourage you to look these things up to get an idea of why the ""evil vegans"" don't eat these things. Anyone else reading this, give it a quick google as well! Vegans have absolutely no reason to lie to anybody about conditions of meat, dairy, and egg farms. By exposing those industries, they do not personally gain anything. But the government has billions of dollars riding on animal agriculture.  With that I am going to go take a shower! Hope you have a nice Sunday afternoon!"

Allowing their extinction is cruel. On the farm they live a purposeful life.  The can sometimes live to 13-15 but that's pushing it.  We slaughter them sooner to stay in business but honestly they die a purposeful death, feeding many people rather than withering away to uselessness.  I value people more than cows and feel human food is too important to waste. As for water we have an abundance here.  It isn't lost anyway just cycled.  We wash with it and it goes back to the lake.  The cows drink it, piss and it goes onto the fields.  We drink the milk piss and back to the lake it goes.  No harm.  Cows may bellow when you take their calf.  That doesn't mean they can raise it.  I was nearly killed as a child by a cow when I went in to her pen to check the calf's  sex.  She liked that calf sure, but because my parents were busy dealing with my injuries they left her alone with the calf until the next morning. By then she had killed it by laying on it.  They suck at mothering because for thousands of years humans raised their calves.  This means the poor mothering genes survive where with wild animals offspring of poor mothers die.  We have selected for other traits rather than mothering ability.  In fact aggressive and protective mothers used to be culled due to the danger they posed to humans.  Same thing with domestic chickens.  The instinct to sit on eggs has been bred out. 99% of the time you hear a cow bellowing all night, she is simply in heat.  That's what cows in heat do. Our cows are content.  We keep them comfortable, they come when we call, line up at milking time, and serve us faithfully.  I have love and respect for them. I also have the sanity to know that they are not humans, they are property with a financial value not human thoughts and emotions. Your time might be better spent worrying about humans being exploited rather than farm animals.  I care for my cows well and sleep fine at night."

It's clear you aren't going to change your ways, but dude: google is right there. You fail to mention the health effects. You fail to mention the sustainability problems.

I also have the sanity to know that they are not humans, they are property with a financial value not human thoughts and emotions. Your time might be better spent worrying about humans being exploited rather than farm animals.   I know they're not humans. They're animals. I'm not saying they should vote, or drive cars. I'm saying we shouldn't just kill them because we think hamburgers taste good. Animals deserve respect, too. And you can care about more things than just people. I , for one, care very much about human rights as well as animal rights.   What you said about them being financial property just speaks for itself honestly. If you honestly see them as on par with televisions and cars this conversation is useless. (They do have thoughts, emotions, and feelings though. Pretty easy to find that information...)  I think the silliest part of all of this is you're saying you treat your animals well, but then say that they don't have feelings, so why do you treat them well? You said you ""loved"" them, then called them ""financial property""?? Then you act like you farm out of charity when you fail to mention all the money it makes you. There are so many fallacies and holes in your beliefs, it just strengthens my faith in the lifestyle I have chosen. Again, I can tell you aren't going to change your ways so you can answer this if you like, but I see this conversation going nowhere fast.

Upvoted,30eako,huckstah,-1,Fri Apr 3 00:49:22 2015 UTC,"Why are you stalking my account and posting this on every post that involves my name? You're just spamming several different subreddits with copy/paste messages because of a personal problem you have with me. If you have a personal problem with me or my lifestyle, there are ways to express that without trolling and stalking someone.  Also, the entire satire/sarcasm of /r/imgoingtohellforthis has obviously flown over your head. The point of that subreddit it to be absurdly stupid and offensive for the sake of dark comedy. None of it is supposed to be taken literally. Their logo, for a long time, was a picture of the World Trade Center buildings smoking marijuana...how can you honestly take that stuff seriously or literally? For that matter, the sidebar specifically says:  ""Tasteless ""politically incorrect"" dark, offensive, & twisted humor of all types is welcome here.""  Get it? Clue: It's dark humor for the sake of sarcasm. Louis CK doesn't hate his children in real life, and Chris Rock doesn't hate black people in real life. It's called dark comedy. You can't judge someones actual real life character on that kind of shit, especially on the internet.  As far as the very FEW occasions that I panhandled, they were pretty dire situations that required me getting a bus ticket quickly out of town in order to race to a job opening. In my 11 years of traveling, I've done that LESS than half a dozen times, and those times were pretty dire.  TL;DR: If you're going to hate me for dark humor that is meant to be taken as fake sarcasm/satire, then perhaps you have a different sense of humor than other Redditors, and you should probably avoid the darker subreddits. You might want to just avoid the internet altogether, for that matter.  However, if you're going to hate me for panhandling during dire situations, for the sake of seeking employment, then maybe you should just use the downvote button as opposed to stalking my account, spamming various subreddits, and trolling posts involving my username.   Fine, we get it, you hate a hobo on Reddit. Congrats! To each their own! But do you really have to go to this sort of extent?"

I wonder if he would have decided to take off had his mother been more supportive and whatnot. To put this more abstractly, I think /u/Huckstah was right that a lot of us see transients through a whole host of preconceptions and one of those is a preconception of social dysfunction.   Given that he clearly didn't fit in in Alabama and at his mother's house, I wonder if he'd see himself as dysfunctional? I suspect he would, but I am guessing he doesn't see this as a problem. Does he have any sort of angst or disappointment or anger toward society in general or his small town in particular?  Meanwhile, from looking at some of the feedback he's gotten from earlier posts, I get the idea that more than a few ""regular"" folks seem to have a problem with /u/Huckstah and his lifestyle. I wonder if he sees his lifestyle and the ""regular folks"" as indeed two different things that are mutually exclusive or is one thing a product of the others?  In other words, I'd like a part two. Thanks!"

Upvoted,30eako,jack_o_all_trades,4,Thu Mar 26 21:44:30 2015 UTC,"Any idea why? My own suspicion is that they're slightly envious. But maybe it's because they're actually offended that someone didn't choose the same lifestyle as they did? That sounds way more mentally ill than my first hypothesis, so I hope that's not the right one. Personally, I've always been of the opinion that if someone can find meaning and happiness living on the fringes or outside of mainstream society, then I am ALL the more willing to stay in mainstream society and do what I can to help y'all out.   If you guys have found a way to be somewhat happy, you're better off than most. More power to you guys."

My best guess is that, yes, they're jealous, but perhaps not in the way you might expect. Obviously I'm not going to name names, to conserve their anonymity, but I think that they (the people who have problems with huck, especially) aren't jealous of his lifestyle so much as his freedom. He can travel wherever he likes, whenever, and that's something that a lot of people who work 9-5's may dream about. Maybe they've thought about it, maybe they haven't. I don't know, and I'm not here to judge, only to ensure that /r/vagabond stays working well and everyone there has a good time.  So, yeah, I think they're jealous. Or maybe they do just hate vagabonds. Who knows.   If you guys have found a way to be somewhat happy, you're better off than most. More power to you guys.   Well, I'm not actually a vagabond.

For the most part, I have found Reddit to be a pretty chill place (I've only been here for maybe a little less than a year) and the subs I hang out in are pretty specific so the community gets fairly tight ... so that's also why I was surprised at the haters directing their bile toward Huck.  For a little while when I was in college I really wanted to ride the rails and be a vagabond ... but I figured I worry too much and frankly I'm just not brave enough to do that, but like you say, I respect the cause."

I'm just a normal dude that simply hated the shitty town he grew up in. Are you suddenly a goddamn psychiatrist based on listening to a 40 minute podcast about me? For fucks sake, people.  As for promoting the documentary, I'm not even making any money/profit off the documentary, nor was I paid for my role in the documentary. The mention of the documentary simply came up in the podcast interview, and the podcast team was interested in interviewing the director about his life of being a hobo while also being a filmmaker.  As far as calling me a fraud, or assuming I have only traveled for one summer, I'd be happy to hitchhike/trainhop to wherever you live, meet you in whatever place of your choosing, post a selfie with you, me, and my backpack, and then you can reiterate your opinion in front of all of Reddit, as opposed to doing it behind a keyboard based on unfounded assumptions.  As far as me being a cunt/weirdo/asshole, that's a matter of opinion. Am I a perfect person with a perfect record and perfect opinions? No. Hahaha, certainly fucking not. I'm just me, and I have never asked anyone to hold me to some moral benchmark or pedestal of being a model citizen. I'm a fucking hobo, either accept it or get over it. My lifestyle is partly illegal, so I'm obviously not aiming to be the Pope or Mother Theresa, folks.

And I had to talk fast because we had limited space on the phone to shoot video.  The picture of the two dogs is at my parents old house back at my families farm. The brown one is kinda considered the ""family"" dog, and the white one is my younger brothers dog. I took that picture a couple of years ago when I visited family and friends during the winter.   I've visted my family 3 times in the past 11 years of traveling, usually only for a few weeks, and usually during Winter. If you're going to hate me for occasionally visiting family and taking pictures of my families dogs, feel free.  Why don't you research shit before you troll someone?"

Upvoted,30eako,huckstah,2,Sat Apr 4 05:01:19 2015 UTC,"Cool, a chance for storytime:  Haha that tiny bag of coke was from a really weird bartender in Denver that randomly gave it me and my traveling  friend for free. I think it was like 10 dollars worth, maybe less...anyway, he just stuck it in my hand and winked. I actually thought it was a bag of weed at first, since this was in Colorado, but I opened up my eyes and was really shocked and kinda paranoid to see that it was cocaine. I was like ""oh shit! wtf?"", and I quickly shoved it into my pocket.  I don't even do coke. I've done it 4 times in my entire life, all 4 times when I was between 18-21 years old, usually at crazy parties. My traveling friend was the same way...not too familiar with hard-core drugs like cocaine.  However, that night we were already pretty drunk because the bartender hooked us up with multiple rounds of free beer. So me and my friend drunkenly thought ""hey fuck it, free bag of fun! woohoo!"", and we snorted the tiny amount of coke. It was barely enough for two really, really thin lines, and I was already so drunk that I don't even think I felt it much. It probably added to my hangover the next morning, if anything...  We had our fun, drank our last beer, and then later went to camp to sleep off the booze. That was it really.   It's laughable that you're going to try and twist that into making me look like a drug addict. I'm actually just a pothead that enjoys quality beer, as you can see in 99% of my posts on r/vagabond. But of course, you'll stalk through all my internet accounts until you can find ONE picture, and then you'll use it to exaggerate the story into an epic pile of proportional bullshit.   It's quite obvious that you created your account 2 days ago to specifically troll me, yet again. You've made the exact same accusations and used the exact same writing style under other usernames. And because of this obvious trolling, moderators in other subreddits have had to delete your comments/posts because you're trolling went WAY too far, such as now. You are truly, truly a despicable and pathetic form of existence, and this trolling has gotten absolutely ridiculous.   You are the lamest/weirdest/obsessed/creepiest stalker I have had in a long time. It's truly like you have no life, and you're only asking for bad karma.

I realized much too recently that it was I who was choosing, and I was choosing to be bigoted. I never judge people for their race, creed, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, etc. and yet a group whose struggle doesn't even allow them social norms was the object of my judgement.

They don't fit your Western gender model. Not today 25 BS genders, not the Victorian binary gender. Everything in the world except Euro America was fine until you Westerners came along! Homosexuality was even legalized in Japan before Americans and their Commodore Perry came with their ""muh freedom"" BS and abolished homosexual practices.

Do you remember about ~5 years ago, when loads of straight teenage girls decided it was cool to be bisexual? That's tumblr in a nutshell. They're nothing more than deluded, immature kids. Their concept of gender is frankly, bollocks. They have nothing to do with actual trans people, and have pushed back trans rights by at least ten years with their bullshit.

Yeah, I'm know I'm going to get a lot of hate for saying this, but the truth is more important than a few peoples' feelings.   If you are born a male, then you are a male. Nothing can change that. The same applies to if you were born a female. The media has brainwashed so many into believing that they can simply be 'whatever they feel like'. Buzzfeed are a perfect example of this. Pushing an agenda that makes people believe we are 'free' because we apparently have more choice.   Masculinity is beginning to decay. First in Western countries, but the rest will follow up pretty soon.

We are 3D-printing organs, wombs transplants are possible, and in a far future we could be actually capable of completely rewriting our own genome. Born a male, born a female, these words mean nothing - chromosomes mean nothing, internal organs mean nothing, even hormones mean very little.  Can you provide me examples of how the decay of masculinity is actually a thing? And more importantly, can you explain why that would be a bad thing?

Psychologist John Money oversaw the case and reported the reassignment as successful and as evidence that gender identity is primarily learned. Academic sexologist Milton Diamond later reported that Reimer failed to identify as female since the age of 9 to 11,  and transitioned to living as a male at age 15. Well-known in medical circles for years anonymously as the ""John/Joan"" case, Reimer later went public with his story to help discourage similar medical practices.

Upvoted,2zm20y,Marissa93,-5,Sun Mar 22 09:58:41 2015 UTC,"""Everything that is done, everything that can happen is natural.""  This is a reductio ad absurdum so that the word natural (and artificial) ends up not meaning anything. Natural when used in most cases, means ""following the natural design of the body"". The penis goes in the vagina, not in the anus for example, or in the vagina of a different species, because that doesn't allow for reproduction or for the birth healthy, normal offspring.   The slippery slope isn't a fallacy if it is real. The argument that changing divorce laws to make divorce easy would make divorce widespread was called a slippery slope by leftists and feminists and they said these laws are only for those who are very unhappy with their marriages and no one would desire to be divorced or be a single mother. Until, of course, feminist divorce laws led to the divorce epidemic we now have. Another ""slippery slope"" was that feminism would lead to homosexuality. Until it did. And now we're saying homosexuality will lead to pedophilia (the same ""gay rights"" lobbyists have attempted on several occasions to repeal age of consent laws; NAMBLA openly participates in gay pride parades, gays and lesbians openly admit in many studies and surveys to have sex with minors...). But no, no, no. That's just another slippery slope. Homosexuality and acceptance of it (or at least the career destruction and censorship of anyone who opposes it) is, right now, leading to the normalization of transsexuality and further entrenching of the insanity of Gender Theory which says we are blank slates and gender is not based on biological sex.   Speaking of the APA and ""reputable doctors"". The APA which in the mid 80's changed homosexuality from a mental illness to a ""sexual orientation""... Sidenote: BTW, that's another social construct, the construct of sexual orientation itself. There's no such thing as sexual orientation, only functional sexual (on the physical and psychological levels) and sexual dysfunction)  ...changed it due to no scientific discovery but the rabid bullying of the APA by homosexual lobbyists and rioters. That same APA tried a while ago to do the same thing to pedophilia rebranding it as ""sexual orientation"" and only backtracked because of the enormous public backlash.   So don't lecture us on slippery slopes and reputable doctors.   The only people who would even consider subscribing to the insanity of Gender Theory and Queer Theory and believe that there's more than two genders are those who are very bad at being one of the two healthy genders, and have rock-bottom SMV (sexual market value) in the ""cis"" sexual market. It's kind of like emos saying anybody who is athletic, fit, beautiful or popular or blonde is a ""Britney or Justin wannabe"" and that cutting your wrists and being depressed is a better value system than valuing health, fitness, social life, intelligence, etc.   And before you predictably accuse me of being a bigot (typical liberal ad hominem instead of addressing the person's arguments).

Upvoted,2zm20y,alkarnur,2,Sun Mar 22 11:34:13 2015 UTC,"But natural actually means nothing. Even if we define natural as meaning ""following the natural design of the body"", it doesn't actually say anything about an action being good or bad.  But why, even if there is a divorce epidemic, would that be a bad thing? It is cerainly better than forcing uncompatible people - who married when they were young and in love - together just because marriage. And feminism didn't lead to homosexuality. It was already there - what feminism did was helping people stop being silly about it.   There is more about gender than biological sex itself (that doesn't actually means anything, as intersex conditions are a thing) - the brain, for example. Which I consider to be more important than the body.  Yes, NAMBLA may have participated in gay pride parades, and yes, some homosexuals may have ad sex with minors. But this doesn't say anything about homosexuality itself, as heterosexuals do it too. People can be shitty, homosexual or heterosexual. Still, they are shunned - because even if pedophilia is a legitimate sexual orientation, minors cannot give consent. Nor can animals. But two adults can give consent, and this is what distinguishes homosexuality from pedophilia and bestiality.  So, yes, what you are saying is fear-mongering. Consent - good, no consent - bad. There is no slippery slope here.  And actually what people who subscribe to Gender Theory/Queer Theory are saying is that people have bodily autonomy rights, and people have the right to find happines and not be shoved in boxes that do not even exist.  You want me to accuse you of being a bigot? I can do that. Bigot! Happy, now?

Upvoted,2zm20y,alkarnur,-5,Sun Mar 22 12:13:28 2015 UTC,"I’ll only be addressing nature vs nurture.  The short answer is: nature (incl. instincts, abilities…) not only does exist, but it can be broken & it can be beneficial or harmful to civilization. How natural something is is not good in & of itself, but rather in how much it can streamline things for civilization. Feminists, homosexuals, transsexuals are against the parts of nature that are beneficial to civilization & for the parts of it that are detrimental to civilization.  The long answer:  ""natural actually means nothing."" Then why do homosexual lobbyists & apologists go to great lengths to say that gays are born that way, & we have witnessed homosexual behavior in X amount of animal species? Pick a thing & run with it. Either ""gays are born that way"" is true, & a relevant argument, or it isn't. Cognitive dissonance isn't ok. If natural means nothing, then it's all cultural & nothing ""comes in the brain"" (to address your gender dysphoria point) for it not to be aligned with what ""comes in"" the body. Thus transgenders / people with ""gender dysphoria"" (which is allegedly a natal condition) can be & should be socialized & get over it. Or rather resocialized since socialization is how they first got the opposite-sex mind in the first place.  ""an action being good or bad.” Something being natural or occurring in nature is not sufficient for determining whether something is good or bad. That is determined by whether an action or precept is beneficial or harmful to individuals & civilization. Civilization, & its principles & basis, is the attempt to achieve maximum outcomes & the highest possible heights practically, or at least usually, measured in the health, well-being, prosperity, knowledge… of the biggest possible percentage of its population. Maximum outcomes (or often just plain acceptable outcomes that, if they were any lesser, would be quite horrible) are obtained by not going against the grain of human nature but harnessing it & humans' animal instincts in a positive way as much as possible & whenever possible, where those instincts are, if not compatible with civilization then at least reconcilable. &, whenever impossible, i.e. whenever those instincts are incompatible or irreconcilable with civilization, its precepts & basis & optimization of outcomes, they should be eliminated or suppressed. This ""harnessing humans' animal instincts"" &, as much as possible, not going against their grain is what I mean by ""natural"" or ""following the design of the body"". It doesn't necessarily mean that every impulse we have is necessarily pro-civilization or desirable. There are plenty of instincts & innate tendencies that are beneficial, compatible, reconcilable with civilization & should be harnessed, promoted & channeled properly & constructively, & plenty of instincts or innate tendencies that aren't & should be eliminated or repressed. Most of our instincts are not related to sexuality, but some are: competitiveness, nurturing instincts, aggression, aggressive protectiveness of kin, sexual partners & offspring; sexual jealousy, envy of social status, etc.  The reason both types of instincts exist is that we are not evolved for civilization. We are evolved for small primate societies. In fact, If humans' animal instincts were all that there were to human beings, we would be nearly indistinguishable (behaviorally & socially) from chimpanzees &/or other primates. If we weren't evolved for primate societies but rather for modern complex multi-million-member-society civilizations, & all our instincts were civilization-friendly, there would be no need for social constructs in the first place as everybody just following their instincts would lead to the best possible outcomes. But we aren't, therefore social constructs & cultural rules exist to channel some instincts & outright suppress others.  We do not get our sexual morality (or any morality) from nature or by observing animal behavior. There are plenty of examples of homosexuality, rape, incest, infanticide, etc. in the animal kingdom. But what is interesting to note is this: what is rare among animals? Monogamy, & even rarer: lifelong monogamy. Humans, following their instincts, are not naturally monogamous, but the opposite. Men are polygamous & women are hypergamous & serially monogamous. In fact, how sexually moral something is can roughly be determined by how distant it is from animal behavior & unleashed sexual instincts. Monogamy & heterosexual marriage are, or at least were (since they're now largely undermined), the institutions that brought about maximum outcomes.  Leftists' (feminists & LGBTQ) ""nature vs nurture"" arguments are a sham. When it comes to women joining the workforce, or the army, or someone promoting traditional roles for them based on their biology, leftists go: ""Nature is meaningless, didn't you know? It's all nurture."" When then someone suggests homosexuals can or should control their sexual behavior they switch to: ""OMG, it's nature! Gays are born that way, silly, you can't ""cure"" gays!"" They then follow up by confusing behavior & desire into a single, fabricated, concept: ""orientation"". It doesn't matter where desires come from, whether they're innate or acquired; We do not excuse a drunk driver who kills people just because he has an innate predisposition to alcoholism. As for behavior, sexual or otherwise, it can always be controlled. Yet in there, is an argument from design that ends up backfiring on them. For in saying someone is born this way or that & that therefore he ought to act on how he is made, they are assuming that he is designed that way (whether by a deity or by evolution) & that that way is by design & not broken. In other words, both a healthy person & someone with a congenital disease or h&icap are born that way. But one of them is clearly ""broken"". Homosexual apologists & propag&ists are assuming, without any evidence, that a homosexual or a transsexual is the former. Another point of their cognitive dissonance / hypocrisy is that they recognize design in their allegedly innate desires, but then turn around & actively ignore design in the anatomy of their bodies & don't infer purpose from it. Having desires for the same sex is a green light to act on those desires (nonsensical, everybody has tons of desires, most of which are not & should not be acted upon, nor is just having a desire justification enough to act on it & translate it into behavior). But having been born with a penis or vagina (that are designed for each other) offers no hint that they should engage in heterosexuality. & if homosexuals are born that way & ought be accepted & not be questioned for how they are born, why do transsexuals not accept themselves & seek to change? Unless of course, their condition is evidence that nature does matter & it can be broken, i.e. the wrong mind in the right body, or as they see it, the wrong body with the right mind. So, in short, leftists / gender dogmatist are both against nature when it comes to women, for nature when it comes homosexuals. But to top it all off, when it comes to transsexuals, they are both for & against it at the same time! Nature does matter: transsexuals are born this way, it's not cultural, you should not tell them to change their mind. Nature doesn't matter, (1) they are not broken & (2) they should change their body to fit their mind. They need to do doublethink when it comes to transsexuals, because if they are against nature here as they are with women, then transsexuals should change their mind. If they are for nature as they are (or think they are) with homosexuals, then transsexuals are just perfect the way they were born & they shouldn't change anything, neither body, nor mind. In fact, changing their bodies can be construed as them being brainwashed by the ""oppressive binary cisgender paradigm"" since that paradigm only accepts female minds in female bodies & male minds in male bodies.  The truth is nature does matter. But the truth also is that all gender dogmatists' positions on nature & nurture are insincere & intellectually dishonest. They simply don't care about nature. They want to do what they want to do, nature & consequences be damned.  Whenever someone in this decadent culture of ours wants to legitimize some destructive behavior or policy, they say it's nature. Whenever they want to legitimize something that's against something widely considered to be based on nature, they say it's all nurture. Take obesity & the fat acceptance movement for example. They said obesity is genetic, & when that didn't fly, they're now saying it's a disease. ""Genetic"" or ""disease"", doesn't matter, as long as it takes any moral responsibility or control over their condition or situation or, most importantly, control over their behavior away from them, along with any blame & allows them to engage in their favorite vice with impunity: promiscuity, homosexuality, gluttony, genital & physical self-mutilation…  Gender dogmatists got it backwards. Sex is largely fixed (& the social part of gender is completely based on biological sex). ""Sexuality"" largely isn't. A woman's womb being designed/evolved to gestate children, or breasts designed to lactate & feed children, or her vagina designed to be penetrated by a penis has no bearing whatsoever on women's role as mothers or on their heterosexuality. But some vague desires for the same-sex are a m&ate to engage in homosexual behavior. Desires, mind you, that are amplified if not outright put into place by a highly visible, pervasive, mainstream, gay culture, & grow when one dwells on them. If you're a man, imagining what taking a penis in your ass or sucking a penis feels like doesn't make you a homosexual anymore than imagining doing sick sh** to someone who wronged you makes you a psychopathic murderer. If you dwell on it, & feed it, it will grow."

Now, it being natural says nothing about it being good, but it harms no one - except for when conversion is attempted. Transsexuals exists, and always existed throughout history (case in point, Elagabalus). Dysphoria exists, and we can observe its effects. As per homosexual people, conversion therapy has been attempted with transsexuals, with destructive results. Various kinds of medication have been used, but they didn't work. What works is hormone therapy and surgery. Natural? It certainly seems so. Good? It harms no one. About women joining the workforce or the army, it certainly seems that nurture is at work here - women are capable of doing any of the works that men can do. On average they are weaker, but our species didn't become the dominant one on the planet through strength, but through intelligence.   Civilization is made by humans. Unless we all die, it will survive and grow, like it is doing, like it did in the last century. Homosexuality, transexuality are far from being a threat to human civilization.  You are equating sexual attraction and gender identity to destructive alcoholism. Your comparison fails, though, because while alcoholism is destructive to both the person itself and to society (DUI, domestic abuse), neither homosexuality nor being transgender are destructive. You could argue that homosexuals do not or should not reproduce, or that transsexuals become sterile (even if they can freeze sperm/eggs), but the worth of a person, their utility to society does not come from how many babies you can produce. Then you go on saying that having desires is not a green light on acting on that desire - and you are absolutely right. When I desire something, I usually run down a list of checks: is it possible? how much would it cost me? how useful would it be to me? would it harm anyone? is the harm, if any, justified?, and green light or red light it based on that. Acting upon homosexual attraction towards another consenting adult passes all of these checks. It is possible, the cost would be immaterial, it would make me and my partner happy, it would harm no-one. This is a green light to me. Pursuing gender transition would get a green light, too, because it is possible, it is relatively cheap, would make me happier, it would harm no-one. As I am not interested and will never be in having children, I am not worried about sterility. So, green light.  Promiscuity, homosexuality and gluttony are not necessarily bad things. Promiscuity with consenting partners and practising safe sex can be good. Homosexuality with a consenting partner is good. Gluttony is not bad either, if you get enough exercise to offset your intake. The fact that you are calling surgery and hormone therapy ""genital & self-mutilation"" worries me, because it means that you know very little about it.  And you are utterly wrong about media exposure causing people to be homosexual/transgender/psychopathic murderer or amplifying their desires. If anything, it can cause people to be more open with themselves. It can help people realize that what they are feeling is not wrong (well, except for psychopathic murder, I guess). It won't grow if you dwell on it and feed it, if there is nothing for it to grow. And most people are still cis and heterosexuals, and not psychopathic murderers.  Edit: a word, and some additions"

Upvoted,2yqf63,googolplexbyte,6,Thu Mar 12 13:09:08 2015 UTC,"Oh boy. I really am not sure I want to go down this road, but I think it needs to be said.  Quite separately from the actual message on the sign, this whole family's conception of Jesus is way off. Jesus wasn't a ""nice guy"". He said things that made people want to kill him the whole time he was doing his ministry. At times whole crowds of people tried to stone him or throw him off a cliff because of something he said. He flipped tables and whipped people he thought were desecrating the temple on at least two occasions. He was brutally sarcastic toward his enemies. He himself said ""I have not come to bring peace, but a sword."" (Matthew 10:34) And when he returns, it is with a sword, to judge all the earth.  Now Christians, on the other hand, are instructed to be ""nice"" in many ways. We are told to not have unwholesome speech. We are told to love everyone, even (and perhaps especially) our enemies. We are told to respect authorities. We are told to be meek, humble, peacemakers, etc. As you probably noticed, this rarely happens because we (like everyone else) are imperfect sinners. But this is what we are supposed to do.  I don't support the negative reactions to the Cain family, especially the reactions from the Christian community, because they obviously were not coming from a place of love. I am glad that Billy defended his daughter and that others have shown support as well, no one deserves to be the target of this kind of hate.  However I (perhaps obviously) disagree with abortion as well, not merely for ""religious reasons"" but because, far from being a ""women's heath issue"" it kills 600,000 women every year in the US alone, and as many men. Leaving religion completely out of the picture, abortion is murder, plain and simple."

Upvoted,2yqf63,mellowfish,10,Fri Mar 13 05:20:35 2015 UTC,Abortion being murder isn't plain or simple. That's why it's not considered murder and there are rather vociferous opinions about it on both sides.  Whether or not you agree with another persons actions - be it abortion or whatever - it really only becomes your business when it directly impinges on your life. Abortion does not really come under that subject heading.
Upvoted,2yqf63,Roshambo2110,7,Thu Mar 12 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"it really only becomes your business when it directly impinges on your life   This is obviously false.   Laws are all about getting into other people's business in order to either directly protect/compensate individual victims or to encourage/discourage actions for the general betterment of society at large.  The various laws against murder exist to punish people when it does happen primarily to discourage repeat offenders and secondarily to discourage people from doing it in the first place. We as a society made this action our business even though it did not directly impinge on our lives (murder rates are ridiculously low and pretty much always have been), because it was the general opinion that it is a bad thing. This is similar to pretty much every other punitive law.  And as far as abortion direction impinging on my life: do I really need this to happen when 1.2 million fetuses are dying per year due to the convenience of their parents? This is too appalling to keep my mouth shut. Abortion is the number one cause of death in America right now, at twice the rate of heart disease or cancer."
Upvoted,2yqf63,mellowfish,5,Thu Mar 12 16:54:06 2015 UTC,"Agree with you about laws. But I didn't say anything to the contrary. I said things become your business when they impinge on your life, and otherwise are not. Other people having abortions are not your business whether you agree with them or not.  Unfortunately, your issue with abortion and the clearly emotive response it elicits from you is somewhat blinded; if we take the above at face value - and I don't but nonetheless - people are having 1.2m abortions out of ""convenience"". This is obviously nonsense. People have a number of reasons for having abortions (including instances of rape, unwanted pregnancies, early detection of issues which may affect quality of life, etc...) but again, I go back to my central point - whatever those reasons are, it's none of your/mine/our business. If someone decides they want to do something and it's not against the law to do so they have a right to do it, and trying to shoehorn your own ideology into someone else's life only serves so fasten someone's resolution to do the opposite, and make the oppressor look exactly that."

I think we were successful because we engaged people; not attacked them. We spoke to people in measured words and did not hold up our fists or shields.   Many people that would actually engage had really, really personal stories that showed why they had issues with abortion and when we talked, we were able to see that there is a huge gulf between ""abortion just for birth control"" and ""an absolute necessity under certain conditions."" While I am on the ""whatever the woman and doctor believe is right"" side (to the extreme), I realize that's not the majority opinion so what I can do is just present a viewpoint that may open some hearts and minds to be compassionate towards women that may fall outside of the statistically ""average"" abortion.   I trust women. People should know that others do feel that way.   I recommend everyone go talk to their elders to just see how many abortions have happened in their circle of family and friends. Be open. Listen. Ask them why. How did they feel? One out of three women have had an abortion. What does that say about the NEED for these services?   Even if you don't agree with us, go forth and listen with an open heart.   And go be inspirational!"

The point is that the poorer you are, the more you focus on the right NOW, not the long term future. And that is a tragic condition.]  If you have a lot of money, you can go protest against the people with less money.   The people with the money redraw the lines of voting districts to be sure those that agree with them (the people with money) outnumber those with no money. Gerrymandering.

My short version is that we are all supposed to create the world we want to live in. I try to be nice and not hurt anyone. I may fail, but that's my goal.   I don't need anything to tell me to do that. Some people think they do. Some people do need that. It is self-evident that we should not hurt one another and I think that is universally true.   The question comes down to the finer points of ""nice."" And that, I believe, is where the fundamental issue starts to get nasty. It shouldn't.  I challenge anyone to have an honest, open discussion about this topic. It's tough when one ""side"" believes the other is ""wrong,"" but you can do it if you open your heart to each other.   I'd suggest you do it in person, however, because that's where you can really make the difference and learn something close to home. Here are a couple of guidelines: - Open, honest communication - Tell each other how you FEEL - Differentiate EMOTIONS from FACTS.  - Stay away from ANY specific religious doctrine (i.e. the book says) and stick to YOUR and the other person's FEELINGS.   If you can have that conversation without feeling fear or anxiety, you can believe you had a good talk. If you ever feel threatened, anxious, or afraid, that's not the right person to have that conversation with.   Good luck!"

Upvoted,2yth1f,Downbound92,-3,Sat Mar 14 19:12:49 2015 UTC,"Facebook may not be the best resource. Here's a quick definition:  A Christian is someone who accepts that being a ""good person"" is simply not enough. The Christian God's standard of ""good"" means ""perfect"" and every human falls short of that standard because they've personally sinned:   ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."" -Romans 3:23   Everything has consequences and the consequence for sin is not just physical death but eternal death:   ""For the wages of sin is death;"" -Romans 6:23   No good judge would let a guilty man go free; no good god would do so either. There is nothing that Christians can do personally to save themselves. However, God has provided a way to justify sins through His son, Jesus Christ. Christians believe that Christ lived his life without sin and then took our sin on himself and died with them:   ""But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."" -Romans 5:8   Christians profess this as truth and therefore are redeemed and meet God's standard of ""good"". This means that they no longer have to face the consequences of their sin. They live life before death and life after death more abundantly than before."

You're trying to have it both ways. Also really bothered me that there was virtually no mention in the podcast about what this had to do with Reddit. I think the show is far more interesting when dealing with things that happened on Reddit, or Reddit was somehow integral to the story.  I think it's a mistake to try to tie in other big picture subjects through some loose (and not even mentioned) association to Reddit. The show should be ""Only Reddit could have made this possible""  There a TON of stories like this, and to not use this as the basis for the show you are watering down the focus of the podcast.

I don't know how I would have decided if I had something like school or a job to worry about.   If you do decide to re-register, as I said in the interview, most transplants don't involve surgery anymore.

I just registered.  The promo code in the Erik Martin link still works.  PIF070109. Website  http://bethematch.org/.  It  asks you for an optional donation.  Didn't take too long to register and you don't have to give your social security #.  You do have to give some other stuff but it's still less than the government already has and way less than is online in your electronic medical records.    Regarding episode feedback,  there were a couple spots where I couldn't fully understand.  I don't know if it was me,  the accents,  or my speaker, but there were 1 or 2 places where I was hoping Alexis would cut in with an explanation.  For example,  I didn't quite catch how they figured out the first guy's blood had the cure.     There was also a spot in the second guy interview where the story stalls before picking back up.  Might have worked better to cut a little there and insert a little summary,  then cut back to the guy.   Overall a solid episode.   Anxiously awaiting my cheek swab."

I can't get it out right this second, but I will have a lot of time on my hands this morning so check back on this post and I will fill you in!  Alright so now I have some time to type this out, let's start with What is Sid Meier's Civilization V?  Well Civ V (for short) is a turned based strategy game where you take control of some of the most powerful and famous empires of history; such as the Romans, Greek, Chinese, British, Aztecs, Americans, Mongolians and so on. Your goal is to win through means of either Scientific Advancement, Diplomacy, Cultural Influence, or by Military Action. When you choose a Civilization, you get certain bonuses, unique units, unique buildings, or unique tile improvements, each being different for each Civ.  You get different cultural policies which gives your little boosts in areas, and research technologies that give you more advanced units or buildings. Beat your opponents and build a Civilization that will stand the test of time!  Now that we got that out of the way, I'll explain the matches at hand. Thenyanmaster was the first to put his game out on the subreddit, so I'll start with him. He set up the game by using a couple of mods from the Steam Workshop, and setting it so that the only way to win was through a Military Victory (holding all the capital cities in the world)Firstly to allow all of the Civs available in the game to be in the same match. Then he got a map that is a replica of Earth and allows for the Civs to spawn where they are or were in real life. Thirdly, he got a mod that allows the game to be edited, he used this so that he could 1. Delete all of his starting units and place a submarine in Antarctica 2. revealed the entire map so he may see what everyone is doing. From there he hit next turn and recorded all the crazy happenings that the computers got themselves into. He uploaded his game screenshots to imgur and it is all history from there.  It was a complete success! People really found it interesting to see what the AI does when left to a game by themselves. People quickly picked sides and fought and cheered tooth and nail for their Civ to pull for the victory! It was the talk of the subreddit for weeks, and people were demanding more and more, thankfully Thenyanmaster was able to deliver. Personally what I liked the most was Thenyanmaster's commentary of the whole thing. The way he described all the events really added to the experience and left me wanting more. Other people starting to take notice of Nyanmasters hard work too, I saw multiple posts about this on /r/bestof, it really seemed like a large ammount of reddit was watching. I guess even people outside of reddit were watching as well, as there have been many articles about this game on websites such as Rockpapershotgun,  even the games developers, Firaxis, and most awesomely, Sid Meier.  Going to have to stop for now, I will return in about 5 hours (plane rides :/)"

I had really wanted you to talk about some of the crazy shit that happens around here so when I saw the latest episode is with the double dick dude then that's exactly what I've been wanting.

Board of Education, or people who were part of movements like the Nazi Party before WWII. It'd be interesting to humanize those who got caught up in propaganda or bad upbringings but later changed.

The post was designed to help find kid's with similar conditions, so scientists could actually start researching the condition. The post went viral after being upvoted and then shared on Gizmogo.  Seth Mnookin did a long story on what happened next in the New Yorker. It's an amazing tale, linked to something that happened on reddit. The story shows the bias of our system to money, the conflict of interest in disease research, and the importance of patient centered communities. It's not a neat story with a perfect ending, but as a scientist, this is god damn amazing.

Upvoted,2xi0va,TeaFarts,6,Sun Mar 1 21:32:41 2015 UTC,"I've posted elsewhere in this subreddit about the podcast being more reddit-centric rather than just stories of people who are only very vaguely connected with the site. Episodes like the Prufrock451 one have been my favourites so far, not those which just seem to be Alexis's interests in the wider world. Maybe I've just been on this site too long and have seen it develop almost exponentially!  With that in mind, there are a few topics which I think would be worth taking a look at:   It's been mentioned before, but /u/unidan's fall from grace would be a great story. The highest highs in terms of being a reddit ""celeb"", down to effectively being run out of town The negative side of reddit, such as the hunt for the Boston bombers and how that rather spiralled out of control. Reddit is a great site for good, but as with any large community it has its negatives too. Even things like the fappening are worth looking at. Whilst their individual stories probably wouldn't cover an entire episode, looking at some reddit-original memes like OAG and good looking runner guy would be interesting. OAG in particular, because of how she's embraced the infamy and has done good charity work with it. Moderators of large subreddits, their war stories. It might help people appreciate their work to hear what they do, all voluntarily. I assume this will be done for timing with the launch of the 2015 edition, but reddit secret Santa is an amazing thing. Similarly, you could go back to the early days of /r/randomactsofpizza and tell the story of the pioneers there. Reddit can do good! An episode with Victoria /u/chooter would be gold, I'm sure. She sounded super-enthusiastic in her AMA, and I hope would be equally good on a podcast episode.   Anyways, just a few pennysworth of ideas."

Another great one would be around the events of The Boston Bombing and reddit's reaction.  I believe you could have a very fascinating podcast around the events and how reddit responded.  There would be quite a bit of work to be done to get it right, but I think it could be incredibly fascinating.   The positives and negatives of such instantaneous knowledge.  Mob mentality in the modern age.  How social media was able to allow something like this to happen.  How reddit administration reacted and what the thoughts were.  (I don't remember anything about what they were)  And how the community came together to change and prevent that from happening in the future.    Not to mention that an episode like that would get a huge amount of traffic and therefore subscribers to the podcast.

I don't have a specific episode suggestion, but I would say that this is something I hope you never let go of. There's a realism in the stories that equate to the likes of The Moth, or even This American Life. I've already told so many friends about this podcast in hopes that they can share this work of art with me, and everyone else here. If I ever come up with the opportunity to create a podcast, it will certainly be modeled around the format I've heard from Upvoted.  FWIW, it's also motivated me to become a more involved Reddit communities user. Instead of using the front page to just kill time at work, I now spend a bit more time reading comments, voting where I deem appropriate, and responding to those who have something to say. At the very least, the ability to vote is something I took for granted before tuning in; now I wield that power with a sense of pride and responsibility.  Finally, your anecdotes at the end are incredibly heart-warming. Your insight and advice is quite moving.  So yeah. Don't stop."

Upvoted,2x9pfh,DieMafia,16,Sun Mar 1 01:49:18 2015 UTC,This is actually not correct. Removing the foreskin means the removal of the five most sensitive parts of the penis. The glans comes way later on the sensitivity scale. Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847

Upvoted,2x9pfh,DieMafia,12,Sun Mar 1 16:37:36 2015 UTC,"The study you cited compares only the glans and shaft of the penis. Of course if you only compare the parts that are not affected by circumcision you can conclude there is no difference in sensitivity.  It is similar to making the argument that if I cut off your right arm, there is no decrease in sensitivity. Because when I measure sensitivity on the legs between arm-amputees and non-arm-amputees, it is the same.  Do you see why that kind of comparison is ridiculous? If I just take the removed parts out of the comparison, I could remove your whole penis except a centimeter of your shaft and I could claim there is no loss in sensitivity."

Is he super rich and paid everyone to keep their mouths shut? Did he kill everyone who knows about it or did they all just coincidentally die before his AMA? Is he super best friends with thousands of people that are trustworthy enough to keep their pinky promises? --I mean, in this day and age where people are desperate for fame and money... how is it possible that absolutely no one has come forward saying they know this individual? I can only imagine that statistically, it's not possible for all the people he's ever encountered who knows about his ""medical anomaly"" to keep it to themselves. It just doesn't seem realistic. And I don't mean that they even need to make a big publicity stunt about it, just how is it possible that no one has come forward, ""I slept with him years ago!"" Or with all the times he's rode the subway, a place where half the people are crotch level to those who are standing... no one has creeped a picture of him and posted it to the internet going, ""omg! something weird is going on in this guy's pants!""

Fact is, I've never used the internet to hook-up with anyone. I don't use personals and there are in fact no photos of my face at all on the internet. Shocking huh? I don't have a Facebook or anything. The only thing I have are Tumblr, Reddit & Twitter and a complementary ManHunt account that I don't use. That being said, the only photos of me on the internet are of my dicks.  Now, I'm sure there are plenty of people who felt very vindicated when I first came out. Meaning, when I appeared last year they told all their friends ""I TOLD YOU I WASN'T DRUNK THAT NIGHT! I TOLD YOU A GUY WITH TWO DICKS EXISTED!""  That being said, there is no way for anyone I've been with sexually can prove who I am. There is no trail leading to me from the internet and vise versa.  As for my doctor, you realize that if my doctor had told anyone he could have his medical license revoked. A little thing called Hippa goes a long way.   The fact of the matter is, you will likely never be satisfied with any proof I'm willing to give you. So it's up to you to accept what I've given so far or not. The fact remains, my having two penises does not rely on the public believing that I do."
Upvoted,2x9pfh,_Not_an_expert_but_,-3,Sun Mar 1 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"OMG I typed too much and had to split this up. PART ONE.  I want to preface this by saying I mean you no ill will. I'm not a hater, and I'm not a troll, which iirc, you feel everyone who doesn't believe you is one or the other. I admire that you took a few moments in your podcast to talk about spreading love and helping others instead of spreading around hate on the internet. I'm not here to spread hate. But- if you have been lying, I can see why you would view me that way. Notice there are no insults or name calling in this response because that is not my intention.  You know what's weird? That you felt the need to defend yourself to me, again. If it was true, why defend yourself at all? Specially for a second time... to me. This is the second interaction we've had. You say you write your own narrative. Well, this is a thread about your podcast/skype interview. Everyone in this thread presumably listened to it. So why even bother acknowledging my comment considering your views on the people who don't believe you? Specially when you say you've already addressed my questions in other interviews. I'm guessing it's because you know people will see this comment and suspicion might start to gather so you want to diffuse it as much as possible. If you really do have two penises, WHO CARES ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE YOU!? Am I right? Why do you continue to make a point to say ""just because they don't believe me, doesn't change that I have two dicks"" ? I mean, I have two legs... if someone on the internet tells me I'm lying about that, I DO NOT CARE, and I wouldn't even acknowledge them because what a tremendous waste of time. I specially wouldn't say to them, ""you believing I don't have two legs doesn't change the fact that I have two legs"" because it's not even worth a response.   I've never used the internet to hook-up with anyone.   No, it's not shocking you don't hook up on the internet. Your online social life really has nothing to do with the point I was trying to make in my previous comment. Also, I'd imagine you wouldn't ever dare to date a fan using your DDD handle because then they'd know the truth about you, if you're lying.   That being said, there is no way for anyone I've been with sexually can prove who I am.   So you're saying your 1000 or so sexual partners were all anonymous? Your poly relationship, excuse me, recent past relationship... they didn't know your name? Of course they did, but we can assume that you're on good terms and they would never reveal your identity. However, as young as you are, I find it highly unlikely that every single one of those 1000 or so people were from serious relationships who still love you and care about you deeply, enough so that they still keep your secrets (I mean plenty might, but ALL of them?). I also find it highly unlikely that none of them have the internet, or watch late night talk shows. A few probably don't, heck, maybe even most don't... I know plenty of people who barely spend time on the internet or watch late night talk shows... but ALL of them? C'mon. It's unlikely that absolutely all of them are completely unaware of your online celebrity presence. It's also unlikely that they haven't discussed with their friends that they dated/had relations with a guy with two dicks... unless all of them have no friends, or they're all mute (unlikely). I'm sure there would be at least a few of them that saw your AMA, or heard about it from somewhere and maybe looked it up on the internet and was thinking, ""I bet I know that guy!"" Because HOW MANY PEOPLE WITH TWO HEALTHY, FUNCTIONAL DICKS ARE THERE? And after hearing your phone interviews, they'd hear your voice. At least a few of them know what your phone voice sounds like and would recognize you. Ex lovers would recognize your voice, maybe your body, and especially your dicks. You say you saw people on a subway discussing you... would it be wrong of me to assume that even just a few of your ex lovers have over heard people talking about the guy on the internet with two dicks? By this time a lot of people know you use the subway, do you tuck your dicks into your buttcrack to avoid people seeing the bulge? You admitted to being worried about being spotted when you first rose to fame so that makes it sound like your double dick bulge is pretty obvious if someone were to stare. Beyond that, you'd be a fantastic rumor in your city and all the cities you've had lovers even before your internet stardom.  I can even imagine a scenario where one of your ex hookups is in the same store or diner or library, or wherever (unless you're a hermit) and they're with their friends and they whisper to their friends, ""that's him! HE HAS TWO DICKS!"" And their friends would then proceed to look for a double bulge, or hit on you. Maybe they believe them, maybe they don't. But I find it doubtful none of them had heard about the ""ddd"" stories on the internet or looked it up. Or even ex lovers introducing you to their friends (either during the relationship or even before or after) and after you leave, telling them, ""that's the guy with the two dicks I was telling you about!"" and although they might not believe them, it would still be a constant statement shared by many of your ex lovers. And we know from your ex poly relationship that at least two lovers know each other so it's not too far fetched to think that there are several past lovers that know of each other or are even friends... so in certain social settings when they're telling stories or talking or whatever, one of them goes, ""I know a guy with two dicks"" and other people are like, ""yeah, suuuure"" and then another ex lover in the room goes, ""no, he/she is serious, I know him too."" And it's even possible they give out your name to identify you to their friends, or describe you, ""you remember that guy at that party with the tan jacket and (other details about you)? Well that's the guy I was talking about that has two dicks."" And it's very, very possible that not a single person they tell will believe them... but it would still be a local urban legend. Maybe not all your ex lovers talk about you to their friends, but it's implausible that none of them do.   As for my doctor, you realize that if my doctor had told anyone he could have his medical license revoked. A little thing called Hippa goes a long way.   So you're saying that all those medical books and stories that talk about patients and interesting medical marvels or cases or whatever, got their license revoked? He doesn't have to reveal your identity to talk about you. Also, someone with your alleged condition would be in medical books, or at least should, and even brought up during medical conferences (maybe in friendly chit chat, maybe even during a lecture) or what have you. It's an anomaly right? It's amazing what condition your dicks are in right (fully formed, fully functioning)? Your name doesn't have to be a part of that information. But it's definitely something for the history books, backed by doctors who have seen it first hand to verify it. It would be a BFD and one of those ""did you hear about the guy with two healthy, functioning dicks?"" stories that would at least be LEGENDARY in the medical community, just as legendary as the girl with two vaginas. That group of people that doctor brought into your room (the one your mother punched), there is NO WAY they didn't discuss what they saw for awhile. There is NO WAY they didn't go home and NOT tell their family and friends what they saw. Sure they could leave your name out of it, some of them probably didn't even catch your name since they weren't your specific practitioner. Some might have been volunteers or students who DIDN'T HAVE A LICENSE TO LOSE. You would've been the talk of the town, although without your name attached to the story. Again, it would've been one of those urban legends in your hometown alone.  That's not something people forget unless they have a horrible accident and lose their memory. And I guess it's possible that happened to one or a few (my sincere condolences to them), but not ALL of them.  End of Part One."
Upvoted,2x9pfh,SmokinBear,-2,Tue Mar 3 23:49:39 2015 UTC,"PART TWO   The fact of the matter is, you will likely never be satisfied with any proof I'm willing to give you.   INCORRECT   You said this to me last time, I think word for word too. I see now this is your rehearsed go-to response (when, imo, you shouldn't even be dignifying people with a response if you're telling the truth). There is plenty you can do. Xrays, cat scans. Ultra sounds. OMG I FOUND THE PERFECT PROOF. You like shoving stuff in your peehole right? Use two medical cameras, put them in at the same time in each peehole, and then they should meet where they connect. Viola. You get to enjoy your sounding fetish while providing video evidence. Actually, I think I read somewhere that you got surgery after your AMA to widen your ""connecting pee hole"" to make it easier for you or something? How did they figure out they needed to widen it? Sheer guess? Xrays? Cat scans? Ultrasound? Pee camera? I honestly don't know because I'm not a urologist.  But you know the absolute easiest way to provide proof (and I suggested this during our last encounter too)? VIDEO FOOTAGE You don't have to show your face. You know your way around a camera. Move around and make a helicopter dick (or attempt to). Standing still in a video obviously wouldn't work since it's possible you or someone you know is very good at photoshop. The longer you wait to do this, if you eventually put out a short video clip in the future (instead of like, right away), it becomes more and more suspicious that you took so long because you needed the video editing to be absolutely perfect (which you would, if it was fake).   And what's the problem with doctor verification? IIRC, that mom story with the broken arms, they provided doctor verification to the mods from the therapist (I think that's who it was?) that was writing a book about their story. You could even see a new doctor, in a new town, just for this purpose... if you're worried you're going to get some crazy stalkers bugging your current doctor. But all you're doing is showing mods, not the entire internet. It'll only be the mods who know the doctor's name that's verifying it for you (because obviously they have to make sure it's a legit doctor and not some fake badge) and then your doctor can, with your permission, email/fax them a picture of your xray/ultra sound imagine, anything... but with your name blocked out on them of course. Make them sign a confidentiality agreement or something, and then I'm sure if the mods shared this information with anyone else outside of work and word got out, you could sue them.  Did you provide any verification to the mods?  Verification. Not pictures.  I think the reason you're still anonymous, is because you made it up. And your close friends know you made it up, they're in on it and think it's hilarious along with you, that you got so far with it and it's still going! And you made a book about it! Man, what an amazing con. Really though, if it was true, I can understand why someone would want to remain anonymous, specially when they have goatse dic pics plastered all over the internet. But it's even more understandable why someone who was lying would want to remain anonymous.  Without proper verification, you have made a fool out of all the people who believe you whether you actually have two dicks or not. That's like the people who see a picture of the mermaid art project and believe it to be a real, mummified mermaid. Pictures are not valid proof. YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE VALID PROOF and yet you continue your charade of, ""it's true whether you believe it or not"" spiel. Videos are a step in the right direction. Doctors are even better. You can still be anonymous with this verification.   Now go ahead and tell me how I'm begging or desperate for your attention or whatever you need to say to put me down, just like you responded in the interaction we had a few months after your AMA, all because I responded to you after you responded to me.  Tl; dr = May we see some proper verification please? Thank you. It is absolutely worth your time to get proper verification because you're monetizing on this. But I have a hunch there's a reason you haven't provided one, nor ever will. Got to at least wait long enough to get as many book sales as possible, right? Look man, if you have been lying and eventually come clean, it'll provide you even more fame. Even more publicity. And then writing ""double dick fetish erotica"" can be your thing if you're really intent on making money from this.  I made this long on purpose. To be thorough. And also to see if you're going to pretend not to read it.  Many Blessings!"

Apparently it is up to the poster to provide proof/verification in the post, or if there are confidentiality issues, provide proof to a mod who will then say in the thread that it is verified. AFAIKS, neither happened in the original r/ama, and surprisingly for reddit, no one seemed to be pushing the issue near the top of the thread. With just the toe that I dipped in, the only proof I saw seemed to be the 3 or 4 jpegs posted, and considering that he is now making money off of this in a book, that doesn't seem like very good evidence.

Upvoted,2wgkf4,MuffinMan0420,12,Fri Feb 20 04:26:30 2015 UTC,"I hate to say this but after listening to this week's episode I'm considering unsubscribing.  Not to say that this episode was bad - I did enjoy listening to Kultur Shock's story - but I felt that this was an episode which had the weakest tie-in to reddit so far. The podcast's description on iTunes reads:   We created this podcast so we can delve deeper and go beyond those upvotes -- to learn more about the stories that hit our frontpages and left a lasting impression.   I feel like many of the episodes so far just haven't matched this description at all. I was a big fan of the first episode with Dante, and the second with /u/Prufrock451 because they were impactful to reddit - with Dante landing his position there, and Rome Sweet Rome becoming a literal part of reddit's history. I expected from this podcast to hear more about posts which brought the community together and did things no other community on the internet could do - this one, for example, where a reddit user in so much pain because he can't afford the dental work to fix it was flown to a redditor dentist who took care of him - that's the kind of stories I think this podcast should be exploring, or even to do something different and dive into reddit itself. I'd love to have an episode with Victoria to talk about her interactions with celebrities and other household names to do AMAs or to talk to other reddit employees about how they found reddit, how they see it evolving, etc.  I've also mentioned this before but I feel like the advertising still needs to be scaled back. Upvoted has, by far, the most amount of advertising time out of any podcast I listen to in the same length group. Even longer podcasts - I've been a fan of This Week in Tech for years - feel like they have less advertising in a 2 hour episode than Upvoted seems to have in 40 minutes. This American Life - an hour long podcast - has a single and short advertisement break in the middle and that's it.  I don't want this to come off in a wrong way - the production quality has come a long way since the first episode, and there is obviously a lot of work that goes into each and every episode, but while there are episodes that fantastically embody what I feel this podcast should be (the episode with /u/jaxani, for example) in an overall sense there's enough episodes of the opposite that just don't keep me as a committed listener."
Upvoted,2wgkf4,InAnIndianAccent,5,Thu Feb 19 20:10:55 2015 UTC,"We are still fine tuning this and figuring it out. So your feedback is super helpful! Thank you!  1) In terms of relating to reddit. We are still fine tuning that. It is one thing to see a post, spend two minutes reading it, and think wow! It's another thing to talk to the OP, parties involved and evaluate if there is actually more of a story there. We've found that so many of our favorite posts resolved in stories that weren't compelling for Upvoted. So please give us some time to get this down pat. :) That being said we had a thread about that piece and it got buried so thanks for bringing it to our attention again!  2) Ads. So personally I also work on a lot of other podcasts. The amount of ads in Upvoted is fairly standard (2 pre-rolls and 2 mid-rolls). This American Life has this same amount of ads PLUS 2 post-rolls. There are many shows with more ads. You mentioned TWIT earlier. They have more ads in the first four minutes than we have in our entire episode (5 ads in the first four minutes). If you don't believe me, here is their latest episode.  Also and more importantly, we actually have ad free versions now for reddit gold members. So if you are that bothered by ads, you can always support reddit with some gold and hangout in the lounge."
Upvoted,2wgkf4,GottaGetToIt,6,Thu Feb 19 20:57:37 2015 UTC,"1) I totally understand - there's lots that dies off after its time on the front pages of reddit. And like I said, it's not that these stories are boring to listen to or uninteresting - they're great stories, but the only connection to reddit in this week's episode was a niche AMA and even that didn't get touched on very much, and it ultimately doesn't really match what the podcast advertises itself to be. Glad to hear it's still being fine tuned though.  2) You're missing a post-roll, are you not? Before Alexis jumps in with his final word, or do you count that as a mid-roll? (I'm not an advertiser or podcaster so bear with me - I just had to double check these definitions). I think the biggest difference between Upvoted's ads and ads in shows like This American Life is that Upvoted's ads feel long - a TAL ad seems to come and go pretty quickly and it's done in a way that doesn't feel like an interruption to the story (to Upvoted's credit, I did mention it in an early episode thread and you guys did make changes which really helped). To be honest, I didn't actually realize TAL has more ads than Upvoted does - it feels the exact opposite. I will definitely keep an ear out on my next listen. I also did listen to this week's TWiT and while it does have more ads (which makes sense for a podcast 3x the length), they are a lot more spread out - after those first four minutes, there's pretty much a solid 45 minutes to an hour before the next one, and I don't think they do another advertisement again after that (please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong - I'm going by memory here).  If you'd clicked through to my user page, you'd see that I've been a consistent reddit gold member since 2011 now - I do support reddit, which may be some source of the dislike for the ads - the ad free versions don't really work for me since I can't subscribe to them (I listen in the car on my commute)."
Upvoted,2wgkf4,powkewl,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:11:01 2015 UTC,1) Thanks for being understanding and all of our other finished episodes are much more reddit focused. :)  2) We only have 4 ads an episode max (3 ad breaks). I count that last one as a mid-roll. With TAL they have another person reading the ads which makes it feel like it is broken up.  That's awesome that you support reddit! I want to do more research on private RSS feeds to make it easier for gold members such as you to have a better experience. Can you listen to Soundcloud in your car? Are you listening through an auxiliary chord or do you have an app that you use in your dashboard?
Upvoted,2wgkf4,motdiem,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:19:28 2015 UTC,"1) Great! That's definitely piqued my interest again. :)  2) That makes sense - I guess I never really paid enough attention to notice that before.  Soundcloud is streamed only, right? I prefer to use a podcast app because they'll download in the background when I'm on WiFi instead of using up mobile data to play them (our data caps are pretty horrific here in Canada).

There are great stories behind some of the big hits on reddit, but sometimes there aren't (those don't make it into a show, unfortunately) -- other times there are things that did well on reddit but weren't Rome Sweet, Rome or the Elizabeth Gallagher story, that happen to have really interesting people involved who we only would have learned about through reddit.  Some connection with reddit will always be consistent. Fortunately, reddit has over 9000 communities helping us find great stuff."

Upvoted,2vokx2,ParagonPod,92,Thu Feb 12 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"I just finished listening to this on my way home from my coworking office. It was a great, inspiring episode.  I (male) have been in the field for 35 years or so. I would say, just from my experience, that the ratio of men to women in the IT shops I have worked in has not changed much at all. There have always been much fewer women than men. I am surprised that the ratio hasn't gotten better over the years but it really hasn't.  One of my greatest accomplishments was this: at a job where I was a senior developer, a female college intern was hired who turned out to be really smart.

I fit into the majority demographic of CS Majors/Software Engineers. 19, white, male, upper middle class, etc. Essentially I have every socio economic thing working for me.  So being a programmer really made me realize   a. There can be a very low barrier to entry if we encourage all genders, races, and religions.  b. These things will only happen if the majority of programmers are not afraid to ""walk on eggshells"" as one of the guests put it.

Upvoted,2vokx2,kn0thing,0,Thu Feb 19 14:50:21 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with being white, male, and from a middle class family? Why do we have to value people more or less by their race, gender, and economic background instead of their skill and effort? I wonder why so many people on reddit - and especially in this thread, feel the need for there to be a perfect 50/50 ratio in every profession, field, and career. When I look at a worker, I look at their skill and effort - not their race, religion, sex, or every little nitpicky category people love to categorize other people in.   Of course, we should seek to educate everyone on the benefits of a career in all technology related fields, but if the majority of those who get the job just happen to be white men I really could care less - since they earned it through their own effort."
Upvoted,2vokx2,algae12,8,Fri Feb 20 02:50:14 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with being white, middle-class, and male in programming, it's just that a suspiciously high percentage of programmers fall into that category.   Statistically, if you take a big enough sample of something, the sample population should approximate the actual population. Programming and other tech jobs make up a pretty big sample of people, so if all these people were to ""just happen"" into this field, it should be a pretty even split between men and women. However, this isn't the case. We know that the U.S. school system pushes young girls away from science and math, we know that most colleges have STEM programs that are mostly men, and we know that there are many factors in play that prevent women from getting and succeeding in tech jobs. If these factors didn't exist, it would in all likelihood be a 50/50 split (or close to it). There is no inherent reason why men can disproportionately put in the skill and effort required to get a tech job and women cannot.  tl;dr: The argument isn't that these men didn't earn their jobs, it's that women encounter more barriers on their way to getting that same job."

I would love to hear more like Rome Sweet Rome or Smooth McGroove where we get an insight into how these peoples lives were changed by Reddit and why they are big names on Reddit.

I would have edited out a bit more.  When you ask about the overlords there is a part where they cross talk and laugh and stumble over each other a bit.  It's not interesting content and it's pretty unintelligible.  Then someone says something interesting, then back to laughing,  then something interesting.  Maybe play around with cutting in tighter on the content.  I'd also cut where you were getting off the call with them.  Didn't add anything.  I liked your tldr.    I thought you dealt with the women's issues well.  Talked more about diversity and the future of computer science instead of just ""hire more women."" It was a nice treatment of it. It was also nice that each interviewee had a slightly different take on the issue.  Only part that was a small stumble to me was when you said something like,  ""my fellow males..."" somehow the way you said it made me think,  ""we girls are listening to.""  Could totally just be me.  I think a word or two different could have made it sound more like you were talking to a subset of the listeners,  like ""and to those of you who are my fellow males"".    Maybe try experimenting with how to lead people onto longer sections of story or go a little deeper on story.  That's where I think you'll find the sweet spot.  A story that delves into one person's life a little bit,  but with enough back and forth that I don't forget you're there too.  Maybe listen to some Larry King interviews.  He went into interviews blind and was able to ask the questions that got to an interesting story.    Overall,  very nice."

I don't think it sounds dumb or Valley girl. I think it's odd that other people do.    I didn't grow up in the American South but I live here now and I love that I have zero residual feeling that southern sounds dumb.

""The Story of ______"" model was starting to wear on me. To hear from people whose noteworthiness doesn't originate from reddit itself was a nice change.  Also nice to hear a discussion on this topic that didn't make a stereotypical (22/white/male/etc) engineer feel like a dick just for having one.  Would really like to see the show try to feature more recent stories. I know there's a huge backlog of potentially great users to feature, but if you guys could try to jump on things shortly after they happen, that'd be really interesting. Maybe even to the point where the show opening could be: ""this week, upvoted by Reddit""."

Upvoted,2vokx2,GottaGetToIt,2,Fri Feb 13 23:50:10 2015 UTC,"Was this the first use of ""subreddit"" on the podcast?  I like that better than ""reddit community.""  It also helps you drop the ""r-slash""  so you can say ""subreddit IAMA""  instead of ""r-slash IAMA"""
Upvoted,2vokx2,slybird,2,Sat Feb 14 03:34:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure. Sometimes we've also used the convention subreddit.reddit.com (in particular when directing people here) because it's easier to understand than r-slash. We've most likely said subreddit when talking about a specific post in a specific subreddit, and might have said ""the reddit community"" to talk on a more macro scale. Don't quote me on this though. I'd have to go through the episodes to actually confirm."

So it's they appeared in the subreddit IAMA versus they've been popular in the r/music community. Does that make sense?"

I wish I could instantly replace everyone saying 'subreddit' with 'reddit community' though. That's how we launched it, but we got caught up with the idea of it being a subdomain (sub-reddit, get it?) at first (gaming.reddit.com) and THEN went to /r/gaming model.   It just makes everyone think of each reddit community as a subsection of reddit, when each community is an independent part of a network of over 8000 active communities with over 8000 frontpages."
Upvoted,2vokx2,ayyelle,1 point,Wed Feb 18 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"What if you say ""the subreddit community, IAMA""  the first time each episode, then switch to ""subreddit IAMA""  for the rest of each episode? I would then drop ""r-slash"" since that doesn't make sense if you aren't a redditor-- and is redundant if you are.    It seems like you are gearing the podcast for redditors and non-redditors alike so this would set up ""subreddit = a sub community within reddit""  at the top of each show and then get newbies more familiar with ""subreddit.""  It will still make sense to redditors.  IIRC I think you plug this subreddit in the episodes which is another opportunity to explain ""subreddit""  by saying,  ""our dedicated sub-reddit community which you can find at reddit.com slash r-slash upvoted.""  Just a thought.    Also I think I saw you comment in one of the earlier episode threads that you wished you sound like Ira Glass or at least that you like his voice and weren't sure about yours.  I think your voice is awesome for a podcast! I love This American Life and while I'm used to Ira's voice now and now he sounds like an old friend,  he doesn't have a great radio voice,  apart from it being distinct.   Looking forward to the next episode!  I now have gold thanks to you lovelies but will be waiting for the podcast elves to drop it into my phone.    One more random thought.    I don't know all the podcast nomenclature so I'll use an example to explain what I mean.  Do you listen to allusionist?  At the top of the show she does a small mini topic on a word.  The last episode was about swear words. She said  something like ""your word of the day sponsored by X is ""bullshit.""  and she did a very short vignette on it.  Then the rest of the show was about other swear words so the little ""bullshit"" story stood in its own but was topical.  Then at the end she flips to a random word in the dictionary and reads a word out and its definition and I think she uses that to plug another ad.    Have you thought about doing any of these mini topics for structure,  more varied content, and possibly as a way to sneak in ads organically?  I would love to see some short vignettes,  only loosely tied to the rest of the story,  as a way to highlight a cool little community or topic or amazing comment that doesn't warrant it's own episode.    Some ideas for the type of vignette:   Alexis reads out a top post of the day from a chosen subreddit.  Don't announce in advance but maybe check /r/WritingPrompts, /r/nocontext,  /r/evenwithcontext,  /r/jokes,  /r/bestof, /r/upliftingnews, /r/showerthoughts,  /r/crazyideas,  or a quote /motivation subreddit,  etc.  And pick one to read that's funny,  or sweet,  or cool.  have a subreddit of the week (as long as they agree)   have a comment or interesting post of the day.  For example,  just read a post where someone offered 5 years of reddit gold if you'd find him a wife.  Or maybe a super interesting ask historians post, etc.  do ""This week in reddit history"" and find something older and interesting from the last year. Like the fact that the top post on /r/tattoos is someone who posted tea to the wrong subreddit.  After the folly was realized,  it was left up for kicks.  The guy then went and got a tea tattoo in honor of the post and posted it to /r/tea.  The guy deleted his account I think.  So you couldn't track him down but maybe one of your compatriots could tell you about this silly post and you could interview him about it.   I think in addition to giving more character and structure to the podcast,  these changes could also help generate more buzz on reddit about the podcast which will be important for future sustainability and growth.  Inevitably people will start posting on reddit that a reddit founder read out their ""shower thought""  on the air or that their subreddit was highlighted.    Sorry this got so long.  I'm clearly procrastinating.    Have a good night!"

I'm more a fan of edited audio stories than discussions. That said, I do like Enontalk and Longform podcast. I find one-on-one discussions generally more interesting than roundtable discussions. Both styles are skills sets that take time and practice to develop I am sure.  I would have enjoyed a more in-depth conversation with one guest if the subject of conversation was more narrowly defined. Three guests was too many. The topics moved too quickly never letting teeth get to the flesh underneath. The entire conversation seemed unfocused.  My last issue was that at an hour the show was just a bit longer then I usually give to any podcast, Econtalk being only exception I can think of.

Upvoted,2vokx2,1488memes,8,Wed Feb 18 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"In general, having people from diverse backgrounds bring diverse ways to approach problems and design products, which a homogenous environment might not think of.    Also, when you have a field that is extremely dominated by one group, it can make many people who might otherwise excel in the field choose to go into other areas where they don't feel so out of place.  So then you end up with plenty of guys in CS who maybe weren't super excited about it but hey, they consider themselves nerds and it's good money so why not?  And in exchange, some women who would do great at CS would not even consider it as an option, or might switch majors after the pressure of being the only woman in their first CS class, etc.  The point is, it is not all just preference.  There certainly is likely to be some inherent preference there, but as long as as you have extreme gender disparity, you will also being losing out on plenty of talented people who would otherwise consider going into the field, and you lose out on their unique view points and ways of approaching problems.  And I would argue the same thing with regards to strongly women-dominated professions, such as elementary school teachers, nurses, etc."

My brother has a strong interest in both architecture and design and while he hated material of the male-dominated architecture courses he tried, he absolutely loved the material of the female-dominated interior design courses he tried. However, he felt uncomfortable being the only straight guy in a field dominated by women and gay men. Not out of his own inherent sexism or homophobia, but out of society's prejudices about a straight man working in a field like interior design or nursing. I can only imagine that's very similar to how women feel in STEM fields.  Needless to say, he chose against interior design, despite having a passion and talent for it, due to expected societal gender roles and workplace gender divides.

Upvoted,2uwhbw,kn0thing,9,Thu Feb 5 21:54:15 2015 UTC,I realized after the fact that it's really really hard to just pick one. Maybe I'll just spread it out to everyone?
Upvoted,2uwhbw,nechered,5,Thu Feb 5 22:23:16 2015 UTC,"Might be the best, it´s really hard to choose (also kind of hate the idea of having to choose between all of these stories)."
Upvoted,2uwhbw,kn0thing,1 point,Tue Feb 10 06:11:00 2015 UTC,All four are really touching stories. This was not easy to choose.
Upvoted,2uwhbw,g4nd,2,Wed Feb 11 19:42:38 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, I was considering saying 'I don't know who you should give it to' as they all seem very worthy of a break and have all clearly had a rough time.  I guess the Glenda one sort of got me because I have two young kids and could relate a bit more to what that would be like if there was one who had these troubles and you were worried about the other picking up on them getting more attention and such like.   Maybe splitting it is a good idea though.  When I was thinking about it after I sent that to you I thought to myself 'man, if I had the money I'd probably pay for them all to go!'.  But then I suppose that sort of gift would create some sort of expectation which wouldn't really be fair for others, the charitable person included!"

I think it's great that you're donating to A Ticket Forward, Alexis - looks to me like Nickeisha could really do with that trip to South Africa.  Just two small point to note: I would really have loved to hear more of ""OP's anectodes"" from the trip itself, and an interview with Quinn. I'm sure you did try to reach her but it really would have been cool to get her perspective.  Keep up the good work!"

I'm glad you decided to split up the donation, it didn't seem right to leave any of them out in the cold.   I'm about halfway through this week's episode and I have to say, I'm not enjoying it quite as much as the previous ones. I understand that a lot of people had negative feedback about the more ""staged"" setup of the usual format but that's probably one of the things I most liked about it; trimming all the fat and leaving the juiciest, most interesting parts. Another thing, I guess, is that I always find stories more engaging than abstract discussion, and the whole theme of getting more women into STEM doesn't really work well as a storytelling platform.  That being said, kudos for trying something different and I will definitely listen to the rest after work! In contrast to a lot of users here, I'm actively looking forward to more fasciniting (possibly uplifting) Reddit-centric stories."

I thought that, on the low end, it would be mind numbing mumbling and, at the best, it would be dick jokes and cats (because, you know, it's reddit).   Did not see riveting storytelling à la This American Life as even a remote possibility, so the show sort of blew my mind.  I'm redoing a bedroom in my basement and I've already burned through every show you've produced. And I've only discovered you guys today. Seriously, this is such a great show that articulates exactly why I think reddit is so great.   I hope this show is a huge success.

Upvoted,2uwhbw,propagandhi45,3,Sun Mar 15 09:27:59 2015 UTC,"Hope I'm not too late. Just listened to this episode. A couple notes:   You didn't bring resolution to the story about Quinn in the Prague coke den. Did she just get lost? Did someone lead her down there? Did she think she would never escape? A little more editing so YOU'RE telling the story instead of the guest would be great. This relates back to point 1. If you're telling the story, you can edit out the less relevant parts from the guest (he rambled a bit when describing this labyrinth of doors and hallways). You tell the story and intersperse pull quotes throughout. Helps with pacing. Helps keep people engaged. Helps to control the story.  Save some of the housekeeping stuff for the end. And I mean the END. The theme music should bookend the story you're telling. I'm not saying you shouldn't call out upvoted.reddit.com or mention your donation of $1000 (as an example) but you spent a long time talking toward the end of the episode. Wrap up the story. Call out /r/upvoted. Play the theme music. Then leave any less relevant housekeeping stuff for post-theme music.    Overall, really good, though. I echo what others have said, especially all the progress that's been made with just a few episodes. Keep it up."

Upvoted,2ugcbm,llehsadam,4,Thu Feb 5 23:40:23 2015 UTC,"Would you keep the upvoted arrow as the main icon and do the snoo per episode?  And,  are you definitely committed to different art per episode?  And different main art versus episode art?  It seems too watered down to me that way.   On the one hand,  it's kind of nice having the different art per episode.  I get a visual teaser of the story before I  start.  However,  I (and I would assume most redditors)  like to go deeper and will generally look things up during or after that I want to see.  And this sub makes it even easier to do that.  Having separate art per episode also makes it harder for me to find upvoted in my very long list of episodes on my podcast app.  Invisiblia,  criminal,  memory Palace,  boom!  Bright icon,  same every week.  Upvoted on the other hand blends in with 99 percent invisible one week and a different podcast the next.    Personally,  I think the up arrow is a bolder image than snoo but snoo is a stronger reddit signifier.  Regardless,  I think you should have the same art every episode.  You're kind of going halfway by having snoo plus art in the corner but I'd rather the same image every week.  Maybe I'm just boring though.    Of the 10-15 podcasts I'm subscribed to,  the only ones with rotating art are upvoted and a sermon podcast put on by a church.  I tend to miss the new episodes of upvoted because I don't notice the icon and end up listening much later.   TL; DR: I do think going with snoo plus episode art is better than just art, but I think just snoo or the arrow is stronger."

If that's the goal then I'm fine with it, but it rubs me a bit the wrong way.  I think that's mainly due to the theme song as well- I'm really not a fan. It's too...""World Cup"", and not enough ""Serial"". I've been sitting here trying my best to describe how I feel about it but unfortunately I'm not that great at doing so. I understand that they have a theme they are sticking with and that this song might exemplify it, but for me it's a big turnoff. I don't think every story has to be a completely uplifting one, but with that intro/outro song they're left with no other options.   I'd like to hear something that invokes the idea of...""Here's another interesting story from reddit"", and not, ""Here's another uplifting story about reddit"". I'm not dying to hear about violentacrez (well, I am, but I understand that his story is not fit for this podcast). I think the ""Rome Sweet Rome"" episode did a great job of being an interesting story without going too far towards ""reddit saved me life"".   Looking at the mission statement of the show, I think it's definitely geared towards the former rather than the latter.   We created this podcast so we can delve deeper and go beyond those upvotes -- to learn more about the stories that hit our frontpages and left a lasting impression. Hopefully, we’ll gain further insight into ourselves as well as the communities we love that make reddit so special   The problem is that this isn't an independent podcast, so there's no way we will get anything remotely ""controversial"", which often times lead to the most interesting stories. Who doesn't want to hear about the Fappening, and what reddit had to go through during that time? Or violentacrez, or Saydrah, or Unidan? Those are very interesting moments in reddit's history, but they obviously don't belong on this podcast.   I guess I'm rambling now, so I too am sorry if this is an incoherent mess. I'll keep listening despite my feelings on the theme song since, well, it's just a theme song. I hope going forward that you guys take a look at some other themes for future ""seasons"" and what not.   Thanks for the hours of listening guys, I really appreciate it."

Upvoted,2u89w8,AdamBombTV,2,Tue May 5 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"I also told Adam this, but what'd you think about the latest 2 episodes with DeStorm and Smooth?  Neither of their lives or success had a ton to do with reddit or a specific reddit post. Smooth does get pretty consistent love on reddit, but he definitely didn't have his life saved by it."
Upvoted,2u89w8,noobtheloser,3,Fri Jan 30 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"I split DeStorm's over two listens (My fault for starting the Podcast when I had 10 minutes of lunch left, DAMN YOU TIME MANAGEMENT!!), so my attention wasn't with the episode 100% (Also Hip Hop isn't really my thing... Even though ""My Life is Like a Movie"" is one Hell of a Jam), so I may be miss-remembering stuff, it might have been when he was talking about how all of Social Media has been helping him out that I got my wires crossed and thought ""Dang, this sounds like another reddit promo""    So, my bad.    I loved Smooth's interview, but quite a bit of that was bigging up how awesome reddit is for a creator and how much reddit helped...    Which I'm just now realising is pretty much the point of the interviews where reddit DOES help the individual... God, my brain sucks.    Okay, I'm just going to try to bottom line it:    I like the podcast... a lot.    Alexis, your silky smooth vocal stylings are butter for my ear breads (you need to totally get /u/noobtheloser on the podcast at some point, check out his Behind the Gif's if you don't know him)    As a personal request, please be careful about how reddit comes across (I'm really trying to make it sound like I'm not bagging on you guys here), it currently sounds like these awesomely talented guys are saying it was thanks to reddit first and their skills second as to why they became successful, when it really should be the other way round.    My god, I'm babbling.    I'm really having problem articulating my thoughts into words. Maybe if anyone else has this same thought they'll be able explain it better than I can.    Also, you're still starting out, and it's hard to please everyone 100% of the time, and I'm only nitpicking because I want this show to go on for a very long time.    So yeah. tl;dr - Keep on keeping on."

One thing that struck me, so far each episode has been about individuals, but throughout each episode there is talk about community.  Are there plans to cover times on reddit where a community got together with a common goal and created something or an event?   I would imagine this has happened in some of the smaller and local subs.  Edit:  I was hesitant to provide the one example I'm familiar with, as I'm the founder and mod of the subreddit it happened in.  But what the hell.    Last April, one of the members of /r/bikeIN was hit and killed by a school bus during his first week bicycle commuting to work.  He had just started being really active with us, and was proving to be a great member of the community.  Through /r/bikeIN, other social media and help from quite a few people in our geographic community, we installed a ghost bike in the intersection he was struck and organized a memorial ride that attracted over 200+ rider from around the midwest in the space of one or two weeks.  And it all started here on reddit.    I'm sure there are plenty of examples of this kind of thing that happen here all the time.  That's the kind of thing I was thinking about."

I'm a huge podcast listener and Upvoted has a ton of great qualities that, I think, make it a distinct and unique listening experience.  In my opinion, the thing that could use some change is the theme song.  It sounds like every generic Phillip Phillips folk pop stomper. Catchy? Yes! However, the first word that came to mind was ""generic"". I'm not a picky music listener either.   You've interviewed great musicians on your show, why not solicit some of their help in developing a theme that really fits the flow and format?  Like I said.... I really love what you are doing, and a simple change like this could really make a difference in presentation  Keep up the great work !"
Upvoted,2u89w8,ParagonPod,5,Tue Feb 3 02:23:42 2015 UTC,"Hey. I'm not really understanding the format of this podcast. It's like you get someone on the phone and then hit record while they tell their whole story. Then when you edit it you just play it back while coming in every once in awhile with some sort of transition sentence.   Also I'm not really getting the feelings I'm supposed to be getting from this. It's like you realized this in the last episode that it didn't really make anyone feel anything and so you threw in that bit at the end. If you're trying to get a npr feel then I don't really think it's working. I think what this podcast most sounds like is Fresh Air, but without the dialogue which I think is hurting Upvoted. Terry commonly uses clips and sticks to the subject. I don't think a WTF format would be good because those conversations could go anywhere and then you've lost the theme of the show which I think in your case is reddit and peoples relationships with reddit.   Destorm has a cool story, but instead of engaging with him like terry or Marc would do, you just let him give a tldr where I'm just kind of left with a meh feeling.   Anyways sorry man these are just my dumbass opinions. Thanks for reading it though."
Upvoted,2u89w8,broncoflyer8912,4,Sun Feb 1 06:33:37 2015 UTC,So would you like it to sound more like a discussion? We've got an episode coming up that should feel a lot more like that. Let's see how it goes - you'll know it when you hear it. I just personally didn't want this thing to be about me -- it's about our subjects.
Upvoted,2u89w8,Meda123,6,Sun Feb 1 22:11:18 2015 UTC,"Ok hey sorry this has taken me awhile, but I wanted to go back and listen to them again and I only had the time to listen to the first two. Also I've been thinking about why I find other podcasts more enjoyable than this one, and it's really hard to kind of formulate my ideas. Sometimes I will just go to talks or something and come out of it not being able to explain what it was about, but I can tell you that I had a good feeling during and after it. So if any of this doesn't make sense then whatever that's why.  So yeah this is your podcast so have it however way you want, but I just wanted to mention a few things.  Episode 0:   I got from this that the theme is a guy who is living an average life has a series of unfortunate things happen to him and loses his faith in humanity or whatever. He then finds a way to deal with these dark thoughts by become active in the reddit community. But I've listened to this twice and I still don't know what's going on. Between this one redditor you have talking about the prison postal service and his own views about the way of the world and this guy talking about coffee I get lost. So not many people know what jail or prison is like, but know about feeling lost and down and that it's over. Well feed off of that. Try to make us feel like we're going to prison and we've lost everything. You gotta push these people you interview about these good subjects. If you get them to show some real emotion, then I think the audience will hear it. His son was mentioned in the beginning and then he comes up at the end like it's supposed to tie it all together, but where is this guy talking about his son throughout it? I enjoyed how you did that flashback to happier times, then all of the events leading up to it, but I would have kept it a lot simpler. Actually ok I'm going to stop I don't know what the hell I'm talking about this one is just too hard to figure out for me. Sorry.  Extra things:  -Ok I don't know if it's a good idea to start a story of talking about how this guy is going to prison and then go in to your pop theme song. I really like the song, but not that part of it. Anyways yeah that's minor.   -I would have cut out this guy giving an exegesis about youngluck's story. Tell the story in a way where it doesn't have to be explained by some guy.  -You were talking about youngluck and technology then straight into an ad and that was really confusing, but it sounds like you fixed it in the next episode so whatever.  Episode 1:   I think the theme here was this guy who had this moment in his life, Jeopardy, where he felt like he accomplished something. We all kind of have those glory days that we can think back on. It's similar to the Walter White / Uncle Rico thing. That's the theme that you should hook the listener on. I wasn't really sure if the dude got married after the Jeopardy or what that was all about, but you have him talk about the high of Jeopardy and the feeling of accomplishment then ""a look at him now all washed up and stuff checking reddit on his lunch break."" I don't really mean anything by that I think this guy is a total badass, but what makes his story interesting is that through reddit the guy was able to find an outlet for his creativity and was able to get that feeling back which then encouraged him to pursue it and write this novel he mentions at the end. Interview his wife or something so we get a feel of his life. It's one thing to hear it all laid out, but what's so nice about audio is that you can really play with the sounds and imagine being somewhere and experiencing things. When the dude is driving in the car with his wife explaining to her what happened just throw some of those sounds in there. Pretend he's in the car with you telling you how he broke the news to his wife. Just make that shit up you don't have to go travel to this dude's house, but just be like ""hey man take this mic and drive around telling me this part of your story"" and then edit in some car door sounds like you're in there with him.  Then you have the whole Rome Sweet Rome thing blowing up and the community's response to it. So with this I'm not really sure how I would have handled it. It's amazing all these people contributed to it, but you wouldn't want to focus so much on that where you lose the subject of your story which is this guy. I think you did a good job with it. Just make sure you remember to emphasize the dude's reaction to the reaction rather than the reaction to the story. Then the whole thing gets kind of confusing. You start getting in to the hollywood business stuff and after a lot of information we're left with finding out this guy's movie isn't even being made or whatever. Maybe it is I don't know because I was confused listening to it, but you use that to transition into this guy having complete creative control over this new book. I don't think any of that is necessary. Just be like dude's story blows up, he gets deals, ""like so many other hollywood stories...."", but then fucking bam dude learns his lesson AND is encouraged from the support of the reddit community and blah blah he feels like he has that purpose again that he lost after jeopardy to not let those hollywood punks hold him down and writes a book on his own terms.   Um here are some extra things that didn't really fit into whatever I was saying:   I would have cut that whole thing where he was explaining how to find out about his book and all of that, you mentioned it at the end and you could have elaborated and not have him talk about it with the ""ums"" that he was throwing in.   I'll just try to throw in some things about episodes 2 and 3 even though I've only listened to them once.  Episode 2:  -It felt like a down note when we find out at the end the dude isn't even making videos or doing anything right now. It's like ""yeah I made a bunch of money now I'm just chilling playing video games."" Episode 1's dude was cooler in that sense because he found a creative outlet in reddit and is still pursuing it.  Episode 3:   -Yeah you want the show to be about reddit, but it doesn't have to be. Like you don't have to stick in reddit in each episode. destorm's story is interesting, but reddit had very little to do with it. If it's not crucial then just cut it out. Also other stuff about this episode I mentioned in my previous post.  Alright man that's all I got. I was trying to be good with formatting and grammar, but then got into some stream of conscious stuff and F it I'm not going back. It is really difficult thinking about what makes a good podcast and I can't even imagine how difficult it must be creating it. So I hope they keep coming and don't give up and go watch that Ira Glass pep talk video on YouTube if you ever feel like your shit sucks."

Upvoted,2u89w8,broncoflyer8912,0,Tue Feb 3 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but in my humble opinion the imperfections make the podcast feel a little more personal, like the interviewee is actually talking to you (the listener) instead of listening to a perfect, recited speech. I agree that some of the issues should be edited, like the areas where it is hard to follow what they are saying, but I think some small things should be left alone like the ""ums"" and hesitations, etc."
Upvoted,2u89w8,AvTheMarsupial,1 point,Thu Feb 5 15:17:43 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to say that I agree with what /u/cbaddele is saying.  Forgive me for making comparisons but it will help me explain.    On TAL and Invisibilia,  the hosts make you feel the story by jumping in,  just a few times,  with an emotional response.  Something like,  ""wait,  so you're just sitting there all alone and no one came?""  Something that highlights the emotional situation and makes me feel like I'm not alone,  that my good buddy Alex is feeling what I'm feeling.  This also breaks up large chunks of time when the protagonist talks for like 20 minutes.    I think in episode 4 you did a few more post-recording cut ins than prior episodes but they were always snippets,  not interruptions.  These are good.  But I think you're missing the off the cuff interactions that make me love my favorite podcasters.  Roman Mars relies a little more on the post recorded cut ins than Ira or the Invisibilia ladies but even then he uses some snippets to highlight an emotional response or the hilarity of a situation.  Like in Mascotte, Roman has a post recording snippet, during a long clip of a mascot historian, cut in to say ""you hear that? kids at home, you can't trademark dressing up in a chicken suit.""   I don't particularly like Serial, but it's strength (though overdone in my opinion)  is that you know how the host feels all the time.  It makes me feel more connected to the story,  and therefore the world around me.   I'm not saying you should try to be just like them but hopefully these examples show what cbaddele and I mean.  Provide a little more emotional depth and response during the interview,  hopefully with 1 or 2 well timed interruptions,  to break up the flow and help me feel like I'm there.   Just my thoughts.  Overall,  I've been enjoying the podcast.  Oh,  except the modem noise at the beginning.  That brings up bad memories     of a slow internet and makes me picture the AOL guy desperately trying to get across my Mac LC's screen."
Upvoted,2u89w8,molecular_chaperone,3,Tue Feb 10 04:01:23 2015 UTC,"Just listened to all 4 and it's very evident how much more comfortable /u/kn0thing is becoming with it.  Much more natural in his speaking, which is great.  I see what some folks meant about the theme tune - definitely reminds me of some europop slowed down version of Numa Numa :D  It has grown on me though.  I agree with /u/cbaddele 's post about the jump from narrator to interviewer, though, in the DeStorm one; it was slightly jarring.  I definitely like the narrator style that's going on, however, so I'm not suggesting moving to a more interviewer-esque format.  I'm not sure how that bit could be handled differently because it was a nice little exchange.  One thought regarding sound quality - if you're scheduling these ahead of time, is it possible to ship out a decent microphone to the subjects? :D  I appreciate some might have to be via phone due to their commitments, mind.  Overall, very enjoyable and you've got another subscriber.  (I have absolutely zero interest in rapping, hiphop etc but DeStorm's one held my attention nonetheless, so top job there.)  Edit : Alexis just gave me gold.  I think I just won at Reddit, or something :D"
Upvoted,2u89w8,kam0706,2,Tue Feb 3 11:51:29 2015 UTC,"Just stopped by to say that I'm excited about a new episode. I have enjoyed each episode of Upvoted, and it seems to be finding its style and voice. I'm extremely glad that the audio has improved since the first few episodes.   My only real suggestion has been covered a few times. I hate to hear all the ""Reddit is wonderful"" stuff. Yes, it is, but it's also horrible a ton of other things. That's what I enjoy about reddit. For the most part the site breaks down walls, fosters communication, proves that good people actually do still exist, and all manner of wonderful things. It's also a place where people build walls, troll each other, etc. We often fault ""The Media"" for highlighting the bad in the world, and Upvoted should highlight the good more often than the bad. Imperfections are what make things beautiful though. We love Bob Dylan in part because sometimes we can't understand him at all and he can't sing for shit. I can't hear ""Tangled Up in Blue"" in any voice but his though.   Maybe show a few imperfections of reddit and how those scars have healed for better or worse. Another huge part of reddit is that though comment threads get off on tangents, we usually somehow end up with something resembling whole stories rather than snapshots.   Again though, great job on the podcast. Keep it up. I understand that many long hours of pre-production research and logistics and post-production work go into each episode. As a listener, I can tell that the those aspects of the show are improving the final product. I also know that reddit has to have income, and that comes from ads, I'm certainly down for seeing advertiser links in the sidebar."

It's a bit hard to tell when Alexis switches between different parts of the show like Host-Guest conversation, 'Backstory', Final thoughts, and sponsor listing.  Maybe consider adding some additional tracks of background music to differentiate between what you're talking about, or adding another voice into the mix to cover things like sponsors and the intro.

Upvoted,2u89w8,proogle,1 point,Sun Feb 1 01:26:00 2015 UTC,"I've been an avid podcast listener for a few years, to a whole range of subjects and styles, and have given Upvoted a go over the last few weeks. Here's a few thoughts:   I preferred episodes 0 and 1 more than 2 and 3. The earlier shows were much more reddit-oriented in that it was through the reddit community that these people became (in)famous or changed their lives significantly. The subjects of eps 2 and 3 are just internet-famous and have had some of their works pop up on reddit from time to time. They got a traffic boost, fine, but they could've had the same from a celeb on twitter posting a link. There are numerous other podcasts which cover the same people and subjects, and are more targetted at their original audience. Reddit is unique in the sheer size of its community and the many, many subreddits into which it divides itself, even with the numerous crossovers, and there are umpteen stories from within those communities which are original and couldn't be found elsewhere. A reddit podcast should concentrate on those stories. I know that reddit is essentially a website which says ""hey, look at this cool thing elsewhere on the internet"", and that the podcast may be trying to follow suit, but reddit now has enough depth itself to be self-sufficient in terms of generating content, not just linking to it. Look at subreddits like IAMA or AskReddit and how they are entirely organic nowadays, pretty much, or for the various stories that have developed elsewhere from within. There are a lot of adverts for such a short podcast. Seriously, compare it to other podcasts of similar length like the Serial Serial, Sideshow, Pitch and so on. Either batch them a bit more, or reduce them. I know we shouldn't expect free things to carry zero adverts, but Upvoted has more than most. Whilst the people in question should take up the majority of the episode, it might be good to ask other redditors why they upvoted a particular post or comment. You make passing reference to this sometimes, mentioning a username for submitting a link or making the first comment on something, but do you try to get in touch with them to find out why they did that, or what it was about the post/comment which made them submit/upvote it? Reddit is constantly viewed as a hivemind, but it'd be nice to hear from the worker bees from time to time. I'm sure you have in your server logs a list of everyone who upvotes a particular post/comment, and you could try to contact a few of them.   I'm looking forward to ep4, and will certainly stick with it for a while, but it'd be nice to see it develop a little more."
Upvoted,2u89w8,ParagonPod,3,Thu Feb 5 12:32:47 2015 UTC,"The subjects of eps 2 and 3 are just internet-famous and have had some of their works pop up on reddit from time to time.   I was especially not a fan of DeStorm's episode for this reason - I didn't mind branching away from reddit for an episode (however I felt doing that so early on in the podcast should have been avoided) - but the problem is that really all I took away from that episode was that DeStorm is in it for the cash and not for the love of creating the content he does. I felt that vibe especially when Alexis tried to tie it back to reddit and the best he came up with was a longer beat-around-the-bush method of saying ""reddit is great because it gave me more money"".   There are a lot of adverts for such a short podcast. Seriously, compare it to other podcasts of similar length like the Serial Serial, Sideshow, Pitch and so on. Either batch them a bit more, or reduce them. I know we shouldn't expect free things to carry zero adverts, but Upvoted has more than most.   I've brought this up before in episode threads but this really needs to be reinforced - even podcasts double or more their length (Stuff You Should Know, Freakonomics) have the same amount of advertising time that Upvoted has.   Whilst the people in question should take up the majority of the episode, it might be good to ask other redditors why they upvoted a particular post or comment.   I absolutely agree with this idea."
Upvoted,2u89w8,ParagonPod,1 point,Thu Feb 5 14:10:02 2015 UTC,"I completely understand that point. We are still experimenting with the idea of how much every potential story should tie back to reddit. The feedback on that has been very split. Though, nobody else has really gone out and told Smooth or DeStorm's stories besides themselves. They are very inspirational stories to our team and it was a cool opportunity for us to make those pieces. Also, keep in mind there are a lot of people who listen to Upvoted who aren't even redditors so it's a delicate balance and we look forward to finding it with even more of your input. :) We are doing a lot more in depth reddit pieces and content specifically about the reddit community so don't worry. All we ask is a little bit of experimentation with the DeStorm type pieces every once in a while (we do have one more coming). I understand the sentiment. Though, there are a ton podcasts with far worse ad to content ratios (Entrepreneur on Fire, Carolla has like 6 ads an episode, etc). Also in my opinion instead of comparing length, it is better to compare meat of content between ad reads. It takes at least 20 times as much work to make an Upvoted episode than an episode of Serial Serial (this is probably an under exaggeration too haha). We are doing research, serious episode sculpting, and 4-8 drafts of each episode before we release it. Personally, I think a paid model for redditors that don't want to hear ads might be something better to consider in the future and would be a better balance of keeping everyone happy. That is a good idea and definitely worth exploring."

His motivation videos were fucking great, really helped pick me up when I was going through some shit. Didn't keep up with everything he went on to do but his message has since been close to my heart. It seems he has a lot of hate from YouTube hipsters, which is a weird new phenomena.  But fuck it, every time I see him pop up in something like YouTube Rewind or some skit somewhere, or even stumbling across his more street stuff, I'm like that dude deserves every ounce of success."

Totally caught me off guard there (like mentioned in the previous episode discussions, I still think it would be better to use unused footage or b-roll, but I realize sometimes the extra stuff just isn't good enough, so a recommendation would be to maybe bait or direct a side conversation into the subject saying something cool that could be the lead-in) The end track still sounds abrupt, but I heard traces of something else there, so I gave the source a listen and realized you guys are using the last chorus of the song, which ends abruptly to a quieter part (which then gets faded/clipped, so it sounds like you guys just stop it abruptly). Maybe try using one of the choruses from the middle? I absolutely loved this episode, and coming from that part of the states made it all the more interesting!"

Your feedback has definitely been very helpful in the show getting better every week. So thank you and please keep it coming. :)   Good catch. I just fixed it. We actually tried 3 different lengths for this part and discussed it. I am happy with this length and it felt like the least jarring cut. Remember it is really only a chorus/verse/chorus. Also it's a great song. /u/kn0thing killed it with that. I disagree that using b-roll is always better. I think situations like this are the best. Though when you don't have them, then reverting to b-roll is great. You are wrong but nice try. :) I used a middle chorus and stitched it with the last note of the song. I like the outro and don't think it is too abrupt. It has the dynamics and feel of a finale. Though what matters most is that you listened that intensely to the show until the very last second. Thanks!"

That is, who came up with the upvote system or how did the team fine tune the karma system, perhaps what goes behind scheduled /r/IAmA where so many upvotes are accumulated, what about the person who traded in his karma/upvotes to Reddit (I remember reading that somewhere), or why Team Periwinkle is SO better than Team Orangered."

I understand it's more or less down to personal preference but let me telling you why:   While the story was incredibly inspiring, the only tie-back to DeStorm was, essentially (and I'm paraphrasing): I love it when reddit sends me traffic. I guess I liked hearing the stories about redditors more than someone that anyone could do a story about. I would have loved to potentially hear about some specific tactics he did to start growing his audience. I'm not at all about having a YouTube channel and creating videos... but I would have liked to hear a couple of ways he was able to build his audience in more specific ways. I really enjoyed the last bit. I thought that the little op-ed piece really did help wrap things up and thought it was the first time I heard Alexis's true thoughts and feelings on the show. Looking forward to it in future episodes. I'm going to disagree with user that said the music on the podcast seems ""run of the mill;"" I really like the music and hum the opening throughout the day. Eh, to each their own right?   Just some bits of feedback, as I know you're 100% taking everyone's feedback into account."
Upvoted,2u46f0,GiveMeABreak25,3,Fri Jan 30 17:56:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback.   In this episode we felt DeStorm's story was more important than just tying it back to reddit. Technically anyone could tell this story. Though Alexis is one of the only ones that has. He shared his tactics and they had to do with the type of content he created. I used to work with some Youtubers and people always ask them about marketing as well as tactics for growing audiences but really the answer is creating stuff people actually want. Marketing is only a small piece of the puzzle. DeStorm's real tactics were working hard, pushing himself, staying original, and listening to people. The Youtubers I worked with always talked about how they wished more people would ask them how to do X with their craft instead of just tips to get famous. Thanks. Thanks."
Upvoted,2u46f0,kn0thing,5,Fri Jan 30 20:32:40 2015 UTC,"Man, I love DeStorm. I saw him just standing around against the wall in a pretty small club in Orlando when Watsky came to town a few years ago and he was such a cool dude. He bought me a beer and we just hung out for a bit between acts, telling me he came to show support for Watsky while he was in town for a YouTube live tour. I was totally starstruck but he was such a down to earth guy.  DeStorm, on the off chance you read this, thanks again for the beer and humoring an awkward long-haired dude."

I like that it was more a story that has a reddit angle rather than a purely was massively upvoted thing. Presumably this tactic leads to stories known by less people but that are interesting to redditors.   All in all, nicely done!"

Like I knew who DeStorm was because I found him on YouTube and loved watching his song challenge videos, then he appeared on Vine. Never did I know that he was connected to another great Social Networking site. Same with Smooth McGroove, I had no idea that this wonderful bearded man had gotten his start on here. I'm so excitied for the story and lore that will appear on this podcast."

I've never heard of this guy and you didn't give me any reason to sit through his backstory to find out what his deal is.   I learned how to write a profile in journalism school; you have to give a mini-intro and mini-cool-interesting-kicker up front to get people to invest in the long slog of the detailed expanation of the context and background. You needed a sample of his work (he's a rapper, maybe? It wasn't clear.) or to link him to something I am interested in (for instance, Reddit.) in the first couple minutes to intrigue me and get me invested.  From the other feedback, a lot of folks found this episode inspiring. I'm more interested in being interested than inspired. Are all the episodes going to be feel-good Horatio Alger stories of how hard work and social media can help artists go from rags to Internet stardom? That does seem to be the theme so far."

Coincidence. However by default anything that gets noticed on the Internet you can peg as ""Internet stardom"". We have episodes that run the gamut, but I'm not going to go into detail on what they are. I do agree though that our first few episodes have had a theme running through them, but promise that will change.

You teased the lede by saying that there was somehing DeStorm did that made you really want to talk to him, but I lost patience waiting to find out what it was.   You also explicitly say that he is more active on other social media platforms than Reddit. That, along with your enthusuasm in the tease, communicated to me that this episode was a personal indulgance that didn't quite fit the remit of the series. A tighter connection Reddit helps keep me listening when I'm otherwise not grabbed by the subject matter. Probably not just me."

Upvoted,2tbe4t,ijzm,23,Fri Jan 23 02:23:50 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I'm a content creator as well, so I know far too well the confidence boost you get from praise, but the necessity of criticism. I guarantee you, my list of praises would be at least 10 times as long as this list, but allow me to be your nitpicky necessary evil:   So it looks like you need to have three sponsor blocks (this episode had two from Squarespace and one from Igloo). My recommendation would be to open the episode entirely with a sponsor (""Mail Chimp! Mail Chimp! Mail...khimp?""). Opening with a sponsor allows you to not interrupt the flow. The second sponsor block came a little awkwardly. I'll have to give it another listen to propose ideas on how to make it come more smoothly. Alexis, this one's for you: when you were discussing Patreon, the way you packaged it came a little...off. If I recall correctly, it was something like, ""Disclaimer, I'm an investor in Patreon, [insert great things about Patreon here]."" That makes it seem like you should feel guilty about the small plug/explanation. Instead, you can just reorder how you phrase it to, ""[Amazing things about Patreon]...I believe in it so much, I even invested in it."" (or something like that) Guile's Theme was a bit lower in volume than the rest of the episode. The ending theme ends pretty abruptly. I recall it being like that for last week's episode too. I'd recommend extending it and fading it out. Another one for Alexis: the way you read the Igloo script sounded like you were trying to seduce me. I like that.   And one thing from last week: thank you for raising the volume. It was perfect :D"

Upvoted,2tbe4t,kn0thing,3,Fri Jan 23 17:53:04 2015 UTC,"because I'd like to keep the midroll   I'm probably way too late to this (just listened today - was binge listening Serial), and I wanted to offer my opinion which is to do away with the mid-podcast advertisement, moving it to either the start or the end.  In podcasts where it's just back and forth discussion on a set of topics (Stuff You Should Know, Freakonomics, TWiT) a mid-podcast ad is fine because at the very least it can be leveraged to move forward to the next segment of the particular topic or to start a new topic altogether.  However, in podcasts where there's a story being told, I don't think there's an easy way to transition to an advertisement without breaking the flow of the story being told. I'll use the Criminal podcast as my example here - it's a similar length podcast which tells a story but only inserts advertisements at the beginning and the end, and it serves to be a much nicer listening experience.  I wouldn't mind listening through a longer introduction with a bit more ad time if it meant the story wouldn't be interrupted halfway through with an ad.  Just my 2c!"
Upvoted,2tbe4t,got_milk4,4,Tue Jan 27 01:01:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! You have a very valid point. We tried to use the mid-roll a little bit better in this week's upcoming episode. So instead of it being a break for no reason other than to mention a sponsor it's more of a close on a chapter before another one begins. I'd be curious to know if it maybe works a little bit better for you after you take a listen.
Upvoted,2tbe4t,cat_sweaterz,3,Tue Jan 27 01:31:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for responding! Will definitely listen for it in the new episode.

I didn't know Smooth had roots in reddit, i came across him stumbling through the related videos on Youtube. The flow gets better as this podcast progresses, so props on that.  I have some things I'd like to say though:  The sections you have the person talking about their experiences are pretty long. I like the narratives, and if its how you want it to sound (a person telling their story) then leave it, but i feel it could be broken up a little bit with Alexis asking a question, omnipotently summarizing over some parts, etc to make it sound more like a conversation then a speech.  The outro music is abrupt. It sounded like you got 29:30 through editing and then panicked to end it in the last 30s :)  Always a topic in these threads, but the ads. To me, everything was fine/fixed/whatever in this episode except for the ""pay the bills"" line. Having a 2s pause and then the ""ad music"" is all you need for the listener to know that there's a break coming. Its analogous to watching a sitcom, and before the commercial break the actors break the 4th wall, look at the camera, and say ""we'll be back after a word from these sponsors"""

It's great to hear a little bit of /u/SmoothMcGroove's story, and also to get a sense of where he's at. I've heard some of his songs before and loved them, but haven't followed too closely.  If you don't mind my saying so /u/SmoothMcGroove, you sounded like you went through a period of burnout and were a little afraid to say it because of how many people were supporting you in fear that it would make you seem ungrateful to acknowledge it.    It sounds like your coming out of it now and rediscovering what motivated you to do some of this awesome stuff in the first place. If that's the case, I'm happy for you, but make sure you take care of yourself. This sort of work can be hard. Trust me I know.  I myself have certainly been in that place of burnout and probably will struggle with it again. I'm trying to combat it in part by building healthy sleeping, eating, and exercising habits and feel like I've succeeded lately, but I've got to stay vigilant. Experience has taught me I can fall back down at any time if I'm not careful.  Also, one thing Alexis and whomever else is listening. I've only listened to this one show and love it so far. The intro music is great, you're good at interviewing, and the production is good all around except for some of the voiceovers you insert to bring the story along. Some of those felt like an interruption in flow.  If you want a good example of a show that puts a good flow together with interviews like this check out On Being with Krista Tippet. She puts out the unedited converations, too, so you can really get a sense of what they've done to put out a more finely produced show. It also happens to be one of my favorite shows out there."

Upvoted,2tbe4t,Measure76,6,Wed Jan 28 03:15:26 2015 UTC,"Hate to be a downer, but I gotta admit that I felt this week could have used a little work, specifically on the pacing. Smooth's story is a great one about how to succeed in music in a non-traditional way, but it was roughly twice as long as I think it needed to be.  Just my two cents, hope it's helpful."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,Measure76,3,Wed Jan 28 14:41:25 2015 UTC,"I concur and I don't think you're being a downer. This is constructive criticism. The podcast, which I dig and want to succeed, is still finding its groove (so to speak). I think /u/kn0thing and team welcomes helpful feedback.   So, I second this comment. The first ten minutes dragged on about five minutes too long; a little too much detail in his buildup. I would have appreciated some highlights of how he got started, versus a thorough back story."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,Mooshu_Beef,3,Mon Jan 26 22:40:26 2015 UTC,We LOVE the feedback. Thanks - we're reading it all.
Upvoted,2tbe4t,kn0thing,3,Tue Jan 27 21:41:37 2015 UTC,"I just want to affirm this thread. I felt the pacing was off and I got a bit bored around the 25 minute mark. No worries, I'm not unsubscribing, but I think the episode was kind of aimless for a bit there."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,Midnight_Rain,2,Wed Jan 28 00:33:08 2015 UTC,Noted! I'm curious to hear what you thought of the latest ep.
Upvoted,2tbe4t,cat_sweaterz,4,Fri Jan 30 06:31:12 2015 UTC,"Hey, I liked it. Seems like reddit is just a minor part of Destorm Power's story, but the flow of the episode was very good, following his story and not rambling.   Great work, I love podcasts like this."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,OroCrimson,3,Fri Jan 30 18:08:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I haven't had time to get to that one yet, my podcast feed is a little deep right now, but if I have strong feelings about it I'll be sure to leave feedback."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,wikisaiyan,3,Sun Feb 1 19:33:58 2015 UTC,@ /u/kn0thing I'm so used to your bubbly and energetic voice that even after two podcasts I'm still weirded out by your NPR voice :p
Upvoted,2tbe4t,creative_sparky,4,Fri Jan 30 18:54:57 2015 UTC,"OK, I'm trying to bubble-it-up for this episode VO recording today. Trying."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,creative_sparky,3,Tue Jan 27 16:52:20 2015 UTC,"Suggestion, are you able to put the Related Links section in the show notes also. Along with a link to the reddit discussion thread for convenience would be great. I use Overcast to listen and I have the Description section but not Related Links."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,kn0thing,3,Tue Jan 27 17:53:19 2015 UTC,"I love Overcast too. It is the Macallan single malt of podcasts apps. Though if you look at the description sections of iTunes, Stitcher, and etc they aren't made for excessive episode notes like Overcast is. Their formatting is also not as clean. So although a related links section would be awesome for Overcast, it would look like a hot mess everywhere else."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,creative_sparky,2,Tue Jan 27 23:24:41 2015 UTC,paging /u/ParagonPod for this one.
Upvoted,2tbe4t,NvaderGir,3,Wed Jan 28 01:21:45 2015 UTC,I'm at work so I can't look into the actual episode But I clicked the ad leading here specifically because I recognized the art as Smooth McGroove <3
Upvoted,2tbe4t,NvaderGir,1 point,Wed Jan 28 01:10:59 2015 UTC,I honestly thought the art was Jared Leto
Upvoted,2tbe4t,NvaderGir,3,Thu Jan 29 20:58:06 2015 UTC,"So Uhh... I know in about to sound like a self entitled jerk but...   I think the episodes should be either longer or more frequent. Is nice to get a quick little blurb about ""/u/soandso"" (sorry if you are actually a person) but half an hour is too quick. I listen to podcasts at work so these things make my day go by quick. Maybe have more than one story per episode? Or you could do an AMA style pre-podcast question gathering that you could ask the person being interviewed. Yes I'm asking you to do more and yes I realize I'm selfish but that's my input. I'll still listen if you guys don't."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,speedofdark8,8,Thu Jan 29 22:47:53 2015 UTC,"You don't send like a jerk. If you want more, that means we are doing our job. :)  We are still finding the footing of the show and this style of podcast is a ton of work. So as the show grows, we will be able to do longer shows and maybe episodes with 2+ stories.  So if you want more please spread the word! Tell your friends, subscribe, and leave a review on iTunes."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,Motha_Effin_Kitty_Yo,8,Thu Jan 22 21:18:06 2015 UTC,Great! I'm glad you are responding here. I happened to find episode 0 the day it uploaded. Awesome coincidence! I really do like this podcast so far.
Upvoted,2tbe4t,kn0thing,3,Thu Jan 22 21:46:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting..... we're experimenting a little with every single episode, learning, and adapting the show as we go! Thanks, I can think of a few upcoming interviews where this would be especially awesome."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,D_DM7_D7_G_Gm_D_E_A,2,Thu Jan 22 22:02:53 2015 UTC,The questions from the listeners thing? Because that'd be awesome often. It would be more interactive. That's what reddit is about right? A community having conversation? You could have an AMA segment of the show to add 10-15 min on to the length.
Upvoted,2tbe4t,Ryaed,2,Fri Jan 23 05:13:33 2015 UTC,I feel like that could happen if they planned it as a 2 parter where maybe everyone was curious about a certain aspect of their story in Part 1 that could go more deeper in Part 2.  And assuming they haven't done an AMA already :P  I feel like it'd spoil the episode knowing the guest weeks ahead of time. This is why I'm glad we get teased the day before!
Upvoted,2tbe4t,cat_sweaterz,3,Fri Jan 23 05:33:15 2015 UTC,"I feel like it'd spoil the episode knowing the guest weeks ahead of time.   This, but we did want to have subjects do AMAs in here the day after. What do you (and others) think? Would you prefer an AMA in the subreddit, or an after show of sorts?   Also we will soon have a sticky post at the top for suggestions and feedback. I want to be able to be involved in the opening hours of that thread, which is why it's been delayed."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,KingAmongDorks,2,Fri Jan 23 09:54:53 2015 UTC,"Talking Upvoted hosted by /u/nerdist.  I kid, but that sounds just fine! Them chiming in during this post-show thread is just fine, and a lot more organic. Having a weekly feedback thread separate from this thread would be a lot better for the people who want to give feedback, and people who want to discuss the episode."
Upvoted,2tbe4t,bmoresbest55,3,Fri Jan 23 21:21:28 2015 UTC,I like that idea.
Upvoted,2tbe4t,kungfucandy7,2,Fri Jan 23 22:11:38 2015 UTC,Gives people a better venue to bounce off ideas and easier on you guys to quickly check without needing to filter comments
Upvoted,2tbe4t,V2Blast,3,Sat Jan 24 00:07:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Its sounds like they were stretching this story out juuuust a little bit longer then it needed. They could do a theme for the episode (for this, music) and picked 2 musical redditor's stories to make a good 45-60 minute podcast."

I was actually surprised when I saw the new podcast title, I was like, I must know this guy. Indeed, my friend sent me one of his videos back when he had like 100,000 subscribers. It was really nice to hear his story, never even knew  that he was on reddit. Really great podcast, looking for more! :)"

I only hope that if you decide to do a story that has a lot of stuff to go over and update us on is that you would do an hour long episode or a 2 parter.   Also, Alexis, you sound so much more ""professional"" in this podcast than you did on the Joe Rogan experience, just shooting the shit with Joe. Do you ever listen to sword and scale? Your approach reminds me alot of Mikes. Not saying you copied it or anything, just that I love that style.   Keep up the great work!   edit words"

I don't know Sword + Scale but I'll give it a listen!  I'm not a very professional guy ;) My time on Nerdist was one of my faves if you want more of the unpro-Alexis.  Thanks for the great feedback!

Upvoted,2t6oq5,916253,2,Thu Jan 22 15:44:34 2015 UTC,I believe it's been the same at least for Episode 1. Episode 0 might have been earlier. Either way that's the official time (give or take a minute or two) that each episode will go live from now on.
