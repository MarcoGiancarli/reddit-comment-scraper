The price may decrease at some point and you'll be notified. Ebay also has good deals sometimes if you're certain of your size or if the seller accepts returns. Be sure to check the seller's rating to see if other buyers would recommend. Good luck!

FrugalFemaleFashion,3clsqf,swbaker,7,Thu Jul 9 11:07:42 2015 UTC,"I think I stated the case rather well, but apparently It is a no-go. See below:  From one of Frugal's Mod's:  ""Thanks for joining our community and participating here. It does not matter if a poster gains or not by posting a sales announcement, ad, coupon, referral code etc. We have millions of page views each month, probably more than you towns newspaper. Hundreds of people come here in an attempt to sell their stuff and promote things. To be fair we remove all of them. As for Amazon. It is about the biggest retailer in the world. They do not need anyone's help to promote their business ventures. Frugal is about teaching people how to think about their resource allocations, not a place to find deals. If you see that on frugal it is just because one of the mods has not removed it yet."""

Having said that you probably want to have a good look at their household appliances. They have everything and if they come at cheap prices... I'll be up for that.   Besides that... Of course, fashion will be high on my list. I don't normally shop at Amazon, but I could use a button front denim skirt or two, anything vertically striped....  Don't get me started.  I could go on and on. :)"
FrugalFemaleFashion,3clsqf,steamybuns,5,Wed Jul 8 23:38:02 2015 UTC,"Wii U, and Psp Vita. And if I'm lucky I might grab a smart watch.. anything you where on the fence about buying because it was a little out of your price range, should be added to your wish list, I have things I might not even buy on there but guess what if amazon knows I might buy it, they may lower the price a litte."
FrugalFemaleFashion,3clsqf,TexTheBrit,6,Thu Jul 9 01:47:50 2015 UTC,Amazon is the worst for giving good discounts on black friday (cyber monday). Proven by science people.
FrugalFemaleFashion,3clsqf,goopy-goo,7,Thu Jul 9 02:46:55 2015 UTC,Use a website called Camel Camel Camel to see if you're getting s deal or not. Shows you the price trends on Amazon etc.

FrugalFemaleFashion,3clsqf,Youre_awesome_so_i,6,Thu Jul 9 09:49:26 2015 UTC,Any clue if they'll accept returns??
FrugalFemaleFashion,3clsqf,blacktieaffair,8,Wed Jul 8 23:38:21 2015 UTC,"Amazons returns are very easy, just go onto your account say you want to return it and print out the prepaid label.  If you buy from outside seller that just sells on amazon not so much.  I always look for the things that are fulfilled by Amazon."
FrugalFemaleFashion,3clsqf,siamthailand,4,Thu Jul 9 06:11:36 2015 UTC,"Mmmm... Great question. Honestly, I am not sure, but I would think so. After all, we are talking about Amazon. Perhaps someone could enlighten us how they operate with regards to returns on Black Friday sales? That should give us an indication."
FrugalFemaleFashion,3clsqf,blacktieaffair,9,Wed Jul 8 23:42:06 2015 UTC,"I have returned a watch I bought on Black Friday, so I would assume they would allow returns."

FrugalFemaleFashion,3cdvma,brogsters,5,Tue Jul 7 10:33:28 2015 UTC,"My local store has 40% everything sales every couple months that don't seem to line up with the online sales, might be worth askinga clerk if they know of any good sales coming up. If you don't need them right away, there is usually a sale online around August/September, during back-to-school shopping time."
FrugalFemaleFashion,3cdvma,shortieblitz,3,Tue Jul 7 17:06:20 2015 UTC,Did you try Old Navy? They're owned by Gap and might have something similar but less expensive. Hope this helps!
FrugalFemaleFashion,3cdvma,bingonthebubblebutt,2,Tue Jul 7 04:27:15 2015 UTC,I did to no avail. Could have been the location as it didn't seem well stocked. Cropped pants seem to have taken over for the summer season.

FrugalFemaleFashion,3cdvma,smarchles,2,Tue Jul 7 22:26:57 2015 UTC,"employee chiming in (but in NYC)...I would recommend you wait for a sale because we constantly have sales going on (right now online you can type SUMMERDAYS for 40% off regular-priced items and MORE for 30% off sale items). That being said, theres a chance your store may run out of stock for that item. If you don't mind the risk, you can note the 6-digit item number (located on the top right near the item description online), and can wait for it to get to a price you are more comfortable paying. Then use the find in store option to locate it near you. If the item is not available at a store near you, you can always call (800) 427-7895. They will locate a store that does carry the item for you- we offer charge sends with a $5.95 shipping fee (Free if you happen to have a Gap/Banana/Old Navy Silver card"
FrugalFemaleFashion,3cdgxj,tempest_36,3,Tue Jul 7 01:36:04 2015 UTC,Asos quality is always a hit and miss. They have free returns though so get those dresses and send them back if you don't like them?

A google doc with pictures would be acceptable as well.  (You can put flair next to your items as well with your username, it isn't required though.)  Pinterest just doesn't work because you must have an account to view anything no matter what now."

Doc Martens plaid sneaker boots, size 10. Current bid at $19.99, also only worn a couple times.

FrugalFemaleFashion,3bddpk,rule17,13,Sun Jun 28 03:57:20 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty happy with my Target t-shirts. The Favorite t-shirt is opaque enough to not show a nude bra, even when the shirt is white. The Boyfriend tee is similar and I find that the fabric feels less ""stretchy,"" but is a little bit more see-through than the Favorite tee. Both the Favorite and Boyfriend come in v-neck. I believe Target is having a sale right now (just saw the BOGO sale on this subreddit, and each shirt was like $6 when I went to the store last week)."

FrugalFemaleFashion,3bddpk,GimmieOrangeJuice,3,Sun Jun 28 05:50:17 2015 UTC,"Adding on to this, There's always a sale and you can get them for around 7.90$ never pay full price. If you're lucky to have a store near you, sometimes they have in store discount on even more items. There's also a clearance bin where they put ""damaged"" goods, like light damage or make-up strained items. It's final sale but I got a ""light damaged"" long sleeved v-neck for 2$. The discoloring is barely noticeable."

I have scoop necks in the black and dark grey and a white V-neck. The dark grey is suuuuuuuper soft.  The v-neck is a bit more of a rounded v-neck, which I kinda like. And with a nude bra underneath, it's great! No show!! Had them for maybe a year now with heavy wear, and they still look and feel amazing."

FrugalFemaleFashion,3bddpk,firstmessage,2,Mon Jun 29 16:06:18 2015 UTC,"I am on the same boat as you! Gap and loft are my go-to! Gap usually has 40% off sales every once in a while, or extra discounts on shirts. (One time I snagged a shirt for $.63!!!) I have  a few shirts from Loft, which I love. I try to buy shirts under $10 each and it usually works out! From the loft, I might spend between $8 and $12 per shirt (always on sale). From Gap, I spend between $5 and $12 per shirt (always on sale).  Target has some good v-necks, but I don't like the way they fit on me. Because it's the summer, they should be having sales here and there. I have some shirts from here too!  My guilty pleasure is Forever 21. True, they shrink and they're pretty bad quality, but I can't help it. I usually only buy my basic white and black vnecks from here. I just size up and only expect these shirts to last me one year (and they usually hold up for a few months in my experience.)   (Not shirts, but I LOVE Uniqlo's chino shorts. They don't shrink and they fit me absolutely wonderfully. Very classy looking too. I have 4 in different colors and spent $10 on them each on sale. They're usually more, but go on sale time to time.)"
