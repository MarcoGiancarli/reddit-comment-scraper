Here:   “I’m having soo much fun with GTAV on the PC but I just have one question about it, how come you are not allowing mods for it?” - @ClarkMatthew63  “Will I get banned from GTA Online for using a FoV Mod or Oculus Rift mod?” - @Mattophobia  We have always appreciated the creative efforts of the PC modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original GTA map mod for GTAIV PC among many other classics. To be clear, the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for GTAIV.  Recent updates to GTAV PC had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications. This was not intentional, no one has been banned for using single player modifications, and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player PC mods. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways."

GTAgifs,35ulpn,homercles337,1 point,Thu May 14 00:02:02 2015 UTC,Basically it takes your char wherever they are and puts you crazy high in the air. You then fall in whatever direction you want and won't receive falling damage when you land. After the initial land you can be hurt again so don't land in a highway. Its a pretty convenient way to cover a lot of distance really fast.
GTAgifs,35ulpn,SomeoneBetter,2,Thu May 14 01:30:57 2015 UTC,skyfall doesn't make you invincible to my knowledge which means you usually die when you land. At least that's how it was on ps3 and 360.
GTAgifs,35ulpn,schin125,1 point,Thu May 14 02:10:44 2015 UTC,In 5 you survive the landing. If you were to get run over by a car or have a shitty bounce off the side of something you will die. If he hit the trees in this bid he'd likely survive the initial impact and fallen to his death.
GTAgifs,35ulpn,SomeoneBetter,1 point,Thu May 14 02:25:39 2015 UTC,Doesnt work like that. That only happens you 4 am your face straight down into the ground. You will die normally from sky fall this is why he has invincibility on.

GTAgifs,341y8b,PizzaSaucez,4,Tue Apr 28 03:40:56 2015 UTC,"The flying controls in BF are weird to me. With GTA, they seem much more realistic. At least when it comes to the helicopters on PS4 you have L2 and R2 acting as your collective (altitude and throttle), L1 and R1 as your pedals for turning and then left stick as your cyclic (joystick).   Takes some getting used to, but it's great."

GTAgifs,341y8b,PizzaSaucez,2,Tue Apr 28 05:58:41 2015 UTC,"The handful of times I've played BF3 or 4, I go straight to a helicopter, but my longest flight has been like 12 seconds before I crash. GTAV, I can fly through pretty much any gap and park my chopper in a parallel spot like a boss. Guess it's just what you're used to.."
GTAgifs,341y8b,llamawearinghat,-4,Thu Apr 30 20:50:32 2015 UTC,It's because GTA dumbs the flying down so anyone can do it right away. It makes general flying easy but it makes any precise maneuver hard. I always have to fight their shit auto leveler. I hope we get a flying mod soon. BF flying isn't even hard with a little practice.

Constantly killing someone just isn't satisfying. I was getting back at a guy for killing me a couple times as soon as I'd spawn. After killing him 4 times I was like wow, this just isn't fun.

I zoom on ahead, mine the tracks with prox mines, set up on a water tower with site to where I put the mines. They start going a lot slower than before, and I realize they hopped the train. Right as they get to my mines they get to the engine and climb on top. Headshot one, pros mines gets another, headshot the third. Starts a little battle 3v1 for 15ish minutes.
