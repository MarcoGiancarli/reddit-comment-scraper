TownofSalemgame,3e4185,RhazhBash,6,Tue Jul 21 20:04:21 2015 UTC,"I do have to say that framer being invisible to spy would be useful, but I continue to be surprised when I see spies fail to take advantage of what they have against framers.  Time after time I see a spy (even confirmed spies) ignore that town is lynching a guy ""who must be mafia"", despite mafia having visited them, often more than once... They just keep their mouths shut and let an innocent townie get lynched, it continues to baffle me because it seems like a clear advantage that spy has over framer, or even blackmailer for that matter."
TownofSalemgame,3e4185,Thashary,2,Tue Jul 21 21:55:43 2015 UTC,"I think the part with investigator/sheriff is a bit OP, but I like the spy/lookout aspect of it (and I don't think it would be too strong). One of the problems of framing the same person each night is the spy seeing that, since no other mafia role (except BMer) visits the same person everyday. Being undetectable by lookout doesn't help much, but hey what the heck. It may help when lying about your role"
TownofSalemgame,3e4185,ELB95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:57:44 2015 UTC,"I must be the only one who thinks framer is just fine as it is? I quite enjoy playing it, too.   The way I see it, it isn't about randomly framing a person each night, but rather coercing the investigative roles to check the people you frame, thus getting innocents lynched.  And that is fun.  Then you've got the other aspects like helping maf figure out roles and targets, diverting attention from the killing mafia roles if need be since you are the non-killing role and least to matter if you're lynched and, only lastly, the extra vote."
TownofSalemgame,3e4185,DenialFlash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"But with experienced players, once they know/suspect there is a framer then they will blatantly say that the framer will just keep targeting that person.  Plus Framers are the only role that will get found out by the investigator without any other roles to hide behind.  sk can hide behind docs, mafioso can hide behind vig or vet, disguiser can pretend to be a jester, and GF can pretend, for a small amount of time, to be mayor."
TownofSalemgame,3e4185,Zetalus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:38:04 2015 UTC,"This. If an Invest outs himself to the town now, say by calling out an SK, any possible Framer has to preempt who he investigates that night. A Framer could hide behind the fact that it wouldn't be too hard for their results to be screwed up for a night, and if they found anyone as a Framer/Forger chances are they would just scrap that night's data if this buff happens."
TownofSalemgame,3e4185,Zetalus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:40:34 2015 UTC,"Framers should at least be able to frame the mafia.  That will mess up the invests who see that the GF comes up as framer and he doesn't have to ""reveal"" on stand."

If there is a spy in game your role would be best played by going afk at night. I don't see how any one can consider that just fine.  You could also go into the fact that unless there is a sheriff in game, and alive you won't have any impact even if there is no spy. To me if mafia is only going to get 1 actionable role it should at least be a useful one like Consort/janitor/consig."

TownofSalemgame,3e4vja,Sir_Snark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:46:38 2015 UTC,"Long story short I'm one of the few people that enjoys playing as an Executioner. There were four random neutrals and I selected the name Executioner in the hopes of being well... an Executioner. I got the role I wanted but my target was a spy. It's nearly impossible to lynch a spy since it's really easy for him to prove he's a townie by telling people what they are whispering in the chat in what is known as a spy test.  So I just sat there and waited. There was a second Executioner that unsuccessfully tried to lynch his target on the second day, but ended up getting lynched himself since it was obvious he was an Executioner. The mafia tried to kill me at some point and figured out I was night immune, therefore an Executioner.  The town turned against each other and I just lynched anyone put on the stand unless I thought they were mafia. This caused the town to think I'm a jester when I acted annoying in the chat and they asked someone to kill me at night. Which couldn't happen thanks to night immunity and little to no killing roles left. By sheer luck my target was still alive but now there was two mafia, two townies, and me. I tell the mafia my role and who my target was and they agreed to help me lynch my target, otherwise I threatened to lynch one of them. The mafia starts gloating while the Spy pointlessly tries to defend himself on the stand. I get my target lynched and the mafia kills the last townie that night, resulting in a victory for the both of us.  Edit: typos"

TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Reosoul,4,Tue Jul 21 01:14:21 2015 UTC,"I always just have last visited if I'm BG or doc. If I know who jailor is, and my will says I've been protecting him every night for a long time, it's a dead giveaway to the mafia who's important, similar to how mayors or invests who have a name marked as ""confirmed town"" in their wills are giving way too much information away."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,hardcorr,5,Tue Jul 21 03:09:34 2015 UTC,"This isn't as beneficial for you as you think. A will is about half your defense as a townie. There's a reason Mafia/Evils pick easier roles to make wills for, like Sheriff, Medium, Escort, etc. There's not much work that goes into making that will believable.  If you're BG with a quarter of a will and the words you're blabbing out while on stand, you just might not make a good enough defense to keep from getting lynched by town.  Besides that, you can at least keep notes on your will as to why you protected someone or who you think is suspicious.   If you protect an 'Investigator' for something like 6 nights even after they're spouting stuff constantly in chat and they never get attacked even once, they're probably just a consig.  So many good reasons to have a will as Town Protective."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Reosoul,4,Tue Jul 21 03:17:37 2015 UTC,"The very fact that it's so easy to fake a BG will is why it usually doesn't matter that I don't have a will. In fact, I make more fake BG wills as scum than I do legit wills as BG. I've never been mislynched as BG because I am confident in my ability to project as town and it fits the rolelist. If you're on the stand, you've already fucked up.  I do keep notes, yes. But I don't have a longass list of everyone I protected, it's a waste of space."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,hardcorr,6,Tue Jul 21 03:22:56 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about?  People get randomly-lynched all the time if there's no leads. Just vote someone up, get a role-claim, then Inno them down. Keep doing this until someone makes a mistake, has a really shitty will, or you have a good idea from vote-reading to draw some conclusions.  I still don't see how having an ironclad will hurts you or the town, whether they're weak or strong players."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Reosoul,2,Tue Jul 21 03:29:36 2015 UTC,"Right, so if it's a random lynch and I claim bg, ranked players will always inno me. Even if another person tries to counterclaim me as BG (which usually only happens by scum towards late game in a mayor game), I've never been lynched because of it.  The thing is, a BG will is never 'ironclad'. If you're alive, it's inherently suspicious that everyone you 'visited' wasn't attacked. It's not that it is strictly bad to have one, but it is unnecessary because it doesn't help and in worst case scenarios can risk giving away an important role. In that case, it's best to just conceal information rather than give it to mafia for free."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,hardcorr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:36:01 2015 UTC,"Remember, they don't always pay attention to wills. Yesterday in a game (I was mafioso) he asked me for my role day 2 and I told him vigilante (though I screwed up the whisper so everybody saw it). Somebody said ""you can't be vigilante, I am"". Despite a will with my name/claimed role, and ""n1. Can't shoot . n2."", and telling them that the guy could be exe or one of us is RT/any, I was still lynched. Being doc/BG with a quarter of a will is much more beneficial, since you just say ""I've been protecting whatever important role that's known to me"". If there's a revealed mayor and you're BG, do you really need that in your will?"
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,ELB95,2,Tue Jul 21 12:39:30 2015 UTC,"If you don't visit people, such as mayor or med, use the time to search the wills and the chat to determine who slipped up.

TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Archemyst,3,Tue Jul 21 04:07:25 2015 UTC,"If I'm a surv\netural in a maff vs town where my vote decides, I'll pick the side that more people win if it wins."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Ocisaac,5,Tue Jul 21 08:50:39 2015 UTC,Even with a ww who basically never wins?
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,PlushSandyoso,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:01:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by this, if I am the WW or if a WW can win?   If it's the first one, then by netural I meant jester(when they know and won't lynch me) or exe.  If it's the second, then I will still vote for the case where most people will win."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Ocisaac,2,Tue Jul 21 12:11:39 2015 UTC,"This is why I always go out of my way to help a surv. I always say something like ""I saved you by..."" or ""I always believed you because..."" And then they vote with me. Almost every time I get into this situation I get surv to side with me no matter what side I'm on."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Skwishums,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:58:55 2015 UTC,In my experience it's the opposite. The survivor always makes more people win.
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Ara-Player,2,Tue Jul 21 12:58:56 2015 UTC,"If there's two NK, one of them being WW, WW can just stay home and claim survivor. I've done it, and I've had it happen to me (jailed a guy who claimed surv, didn't execute, he was WW and mauled me)."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,ELB95,2,Tue Jul 21 12:43:41 2015 UTC,"Except Witches/Werewolves (Invest results) and Arsonists/SKs/Executioners/Godfathers (Explanation for night immunity), and even Jesters (to avoid getting targeted by evil killing roles and get voted for when town has no leads) all have reasons to claims survivor.  It's not worth the risk to let someone claiming survivor live. Because the odds that they're not really survivor are pretty significant."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,ultimario13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:08 2015 UTC,the town always wanting to kill survivor makes the survivor go against town. seems like they should remove the survivor role then if everyone wants to kill them. or make the jailor and vig react the same as if they kill town.
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,tohon75,2,Tue Jul 21 14:33:57 2015 UTC,"The prime component missing from your question is yet. Of course no survivor is going to come out swinging saying ""fuck town"" because they know they can hang him at a moment's notice just for being rude with no penalty. Killing the survivor early is essentially defusing a time bomb. It's not if it will explode, but when."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,wrathandhavoc,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:13 2015 UTC,"That's a horrible strategy. Mostly because survivor day 1 claims are almost always survivor so you're not only wasting a kill potentially, but you're preventing the possibility of saving someone else by jailing a true evil role.  I suggest you change your strategy unless you have reason to not trust the survivor claim."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,JustTray,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:04 2015 UTC,"As of late, there is absolutely no reason to trust a survivor claim in the lategame. The moment the game gets close, the survivor immediately becomes a 4th (or 5th) mafia, essentially. They parade their neutral intentions until the mafia force their hand, and towns don't necessarily win any affection from them by screaming ""hang the surv, its no loss to us"" the moment they claim. Thus, when I'm jailor, I no longer give them a chance. Too many instances of them turning on the town to allow it to continue. I'm not much of one for survivor hate, but the meta has shifted public opinion away from survivors with plenty of good reason, for now."

TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Oops_killsteal,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:48:41 2015 UTC,That's a waste of an execution.
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Gorodhaner,11,Tue Jul 21 01:29:24 2015 UTC,"No,  it's not.  Apart from the reasons listed above survs are more likely than not to side with bad guys"
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,DgSb,4,Tue Jul 21 01:35:03 2015 UTC,"If they are actually survivor, it is.  While not as bad as killing town, executions are vital, its better you save it for bigger evil's, being down to 2 executions just because you 'think' a survivor will side with mafia is a waste."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,TurtleforAG,11,Tue Jul 21 01:42:57 2015 UTC,"But sometimes the survivor claim is a lie.    Losing one execution in order to, at worst, kill a neutral and reduce claimspace, and at best, kill a lying evil role, seems worthwhile."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Salindurthas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:51 2015 UTC,I stated specifically only if they are survivor I see it as a waste.
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,TurtleforAG,5,Tue Jul 21 07:59:10 2015 UTC,"Is that meant to dissuade someone from killing a Survivor claim? If so, I have 2 counter arguments:   Relevance. You don't know they are actually a survivor. You may actually be killing an evil role. Reducing claimspace and uncertainty has value."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Salindurthas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:53:37 2015 UTC,"Its not, its ment to save your executions for more important people.  Also you seem to forget town will claim survivors, so there's always that."

TownofSalemgame,3e0era,TurtleforAG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:59:36 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly. If you can eliminate 3 non-town on your own as jailor, there is a good chance you have destroyed the evils. Survivor execution or not."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,wrathandhavoc,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:04 2015 UTC,How naive.  You'll learn one day.
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Reosoul,2,Tue Jul 21 02:17:59 2015 UTC,Looks like i have an another conception of the survivor claim. I always execute survivor claims at jail. Unless they claimed N1 (which mean they are more likely to be survivor). Am i wrong ?
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,milouse666,2,Tue Jul 21 14:43:13 2015 UTC,Never admit to the jailor you are a survivor. Lie and then start teaming up with the mafia. If anything you can pretend your the jester once the TK dies.

TownofSalemgame,3e0era,UnholyTeemo,2,Tue Jul 21 01:03:59 2015 UTC,"its interesting to gauge the reactions of people when you choose to execute them. Sometimes you get a ""wtf whyyyyyyyyyyyy"", and other times ""WTF JAILOR ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!!? towns gonna lose dsfalkfdsja;"""
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,KnightsOfArgonia,2,Tue Jul 21 03:10:55 2015 UTC,"I keep a will for almost every class EXCEPT bodyguard. The reasoning is because it requires no thought to fake a bodyguard will, the people you visited won't be alerted unless they got attacked and you died. Also, it doesn't give the town any information on who you protected except for the night in which you actually die. I put the last person I protected in my will just so the town knows who got attacked. But either way, to the jailor, that will is meaningless because it's literately impossible to prove or disprove it.  Instead, I post lyrics from the soundtrack to 'The Bodyguard' when the jailor asks me for a will, cause it's just as useful as proving I'm actually a bodyguard. So I've been executed the three times I've attempted it."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,ThePopil,5,Tue Jul 21 05:22:27 2015 UTC,You get a lot of time to type in Nx:# in your will.  How hard is it to do that to keep the Jailor and town from hounding you.  It's useless but if the town is on your ass you might as well provide something to show you aren't a noob baddie.
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Zetalus,5,Tue Jul 21 08:40:00 2015 UTC,I don't approve of your tactic.
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,PlushSandyoso,2,Tue Jul 21 12:03:48 2015 UTC,"Except if a lookout visits the guy you claimed to visit and sees nobody visited them, you're proven guilty. And jailors are very capable of coordinating with investigative roles. So jailor can be like ""Ok, bodyguard 12 next night and lookout will check him out too. I trust him because he found a mafia member, so if he says you didn't visit you're proven guilty""."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,ultimario13,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:21:39 2015 UTC,I dont keep a will as a bodyguard. There isnt much point. He probably typed it out then posted it.
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,SephithDarknesse,14,Tue Jul 21 00:29:46 2015 UTC,"You should always keep a will of who you visit if you're a town who CAN visit people.  For Medium, having a nightly will is less important, but even still you should jot notes down in it. Any townie who doesn't have a will in ranked, for me, gets executed."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Reosoul,-2,Tue Jul 21 01:11:50 2015 UTC,"Not really. A bg gives no useful information about who he visits. Not does a doctor. Both know the outcome, and saying you visited someone in a will shows nothing. Wills are generally giving your last info when killed. When you die, that info is now useless."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,SephithDarknesse,13,Tue Jul 21 01:28:12 2015 UTC,"Argh, I hope you don't play ranked.   BG wills allow the rest of the town to see who got attacked if you successfully defend someone -- useful because then the town knows the maf attacked that person, indicating the attacked person is not maf.  Or, in the case of a doc, shows they are not night immune."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,DgSb,0,Tue Jul 21 01:33:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's useful to store saves and a last visit but a full will just makes it crowded and harder to sort out the useless bits."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,Gorfoo,-5,Tue Jul 21 03:31:00 2015 UTC,"Fyi, im 15-1 ranked right now. I dont play that often.. But im rather good at this."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,SephithDarknesse,7,Tue Jul 21 01:38:40 2015 UTC,"You're not rather good if you think keeping a will isn't important for bg/doc, your high opinion of your skills just means you haven't been in a situation where your poor play caused any damage yet.   And 15 wins really isn't that impressive."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,DgSb,-7,Tue Jul 21 01:42:15 2015 UTC,"15 wins and 1 loss is fairly impressive, and thats just what ive bothered with ranked. Ive played well over 500 games with most content unlocked.  Noone can really oppose and pretend to have been attacked, when you have someone right there knowing the info."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,SephithDarknesse,3,Tue Jul 21 02:01:58 2015 UTC,"In TOS, win percentage doesn't directly correlate with how good somebody is... It's a team game, and it's very easy to lose when it's no fault of your own as I'm sure you're aware, so flaunting your wins isn't impressive in the slightest."
TownofSalemgame,3e0era,sturmspitz,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:11:13 2015 UTC,"Whatever you say, kid. But you're wrong.  16 ranked games don't mean shit to some of us who have 1,000 or more and have seen it all."
