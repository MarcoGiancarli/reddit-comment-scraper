Not to mention the fact that being even just slightly influential in a young man's life is pretty awesome."

Keep up the good work and if you ever have a scout who is having a hard time and wants to call it quits feel free to use my experience:  I am 33 and a contractor with NASA. I have accomplished some pretty amazing things in my life and have passed on many things along the way (sometimes there's just not enough time or resources). However the one thing I wish I could go back and change is dropping out at Life Scout. Not finishing my Eagle is probably my biggest regret in life. And after a few deep discussions with my supervisor at NASA's Environmental Management Division...I am not the only one that feels this way. He reached Life Scout and stopped as well, and completely regrets it."

showerbeer,3dvmul,dougsbeard,4,Sun Jul 19 22:19:54 2015 UTC,I cannot find that root beer beer anywhere. I swear the company deliberately created a shortage to get everyone to talk about it and has been filling up warehouses and will send every liquor store hundreds of cases.
showerbeer,3dvmul,biggred11,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:22:10 2015 UTC,"It might be the state you live in. The company is a pretty small brewery and might not have distribution to your state. However, they did increase distribution when the hype started on the beer. And Pabst even said they have signed a distribution deal with the brewery to get the beer in every state. Honestly...I haven't stepped into a store where it hasn't been lately. Hell, the girlfriend and I were camping last month and took a quick trek to Wal-Mart to grab a few things we needed and found a massive stack of cases there. Middle of New York, Wal-Mart, huge supply."
showerbeer,3dvmul,biggred11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I am in north NJ and every liquor store near me said they are expecting shipments on Tuesday. I also heard sam adams in making their own root beer beer as well.

BuzzFeed brings you the buzz on the internet, same as reddit does - just in a different way. I'm sure most of these were top posts, or something. If I am posting something here, I'm publishing it for people to see. Unless it was edited or used for unintended purposes, then the picture is fair game in my book. People post here for what? To show off their shower beers. And they get upvotes for it, right? I'm sure everyone likes receiving upvotes and/or are posting for attention. Now they got even more attention.   I'm actually surprised we haven't heard from any of the image posters yet. Anyway, I see nothing wrong with using these pictures to promote shower beers, and that's the bottom line. At least a source to the subreddit was given. This isn't some secret society. There are more than 25,000 subscribers. C'mon now, don't be an elitist. This subreddit did not create the idea of a shower beer."

showerbeer,3d6s07,McJawsh,5,Mon Jul 13 23:35:18 2015 UTC,They may have contacted the users asking for permission. I had buzzfeed contact me once and ask to use one of my posts.
showerbeer,3d6s07,bucherman7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:21:06 2015 UTC,"They didn't though. #10 is my post and I was never contacted by anyone about using the image - a friend saw me and shared the listicle with me. Honestly, I don't care that I wasn't contacted. I cared more that they didn't take the extra few seconds to be more invested in the posts they took their images from. In my case I feel like my (now ex) boyfriend and I were framed as friends in comparison to #12 as lovers. The title of my post might not be clear, but the comments are very clear that we're a couple. But then again it's Buzzfeed and it's a list so it's not like I expect any more. I sound more bothered by that than I really am.  What I do expect is maybe some mention of r/showerbeer since every single image they used is from here. They want people to ""embrace"" the showerbeer? How about sharing and respecting the community that supplied your source material."

A tad strong on that flavor, like a drink that was made a bit more stiff than you were expecting, but not that you would send back. Overall, I really enjoyed it"

showerbeer,3by7r6,peewoah1,4,Fri Jul 3 03:28:36 2015 UTC,"I have nobody to blame but myself for this:  1) Had previously tried other brews from Hitachino Nest - never liked any of them.  2) Was going for an All-American beer theme at the local bottle shop...but this caught my eye and there was only one left. Abandoned the theme.  3) Didn't realize this bottle was $9 until I went to the register. Didn't want to be ""that guy"" and hold up the line so went through with it.  Never again."
showerbeer,3by7r6,riggard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:34:04 2015 UTC,"I just had this the other day, I think it's delicious. Better enjoyed in a glass.

Very interesting beer and brewery."

Surely 42 miles on a streamlined road-bike isn't quite as hard as it sounds once you get in great shape right? I have a mountain-bike, but assume you can coast or at least cover a lot of ground without too much effort on a nice road-bike, right? Still sweet.

showerbeer,3b2ov3,CRush1682,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:36:28 2015 UTC,I was able to do multiple 100km days in a row on a decent bike in crappy shape. So it's certainly achievable. But be prepared to feel awful afterwards.
showerbeer,3b2ov3,theoriginaljwin,0,Thu Jun 25 22:40:34 2015 UTC,"Even with a mountain bike, depending on your pace 42 miles isn't too bad.  I mean, you're not gonna bang it out in 2 hours, and you will be tired at the end if you try to keep a good pace.  It does also depend on the terrain.  I can average over 13 mph on a flat tow path on my Cannondale Trail7 29er mountain bike for long distances.  Lets say 7-8 mph on more hilly terrain assuming we're not climbing in elevation from start to finish.  That's still 42 miles in 6 hours assuming no break for food.  That being said, you have to be in decent cardiovascular shape to keep up that pace for 42 miles.  I'm thinking about doing a 2-day 160 mile ride this summer on my mountain bike.  http://main.nationalmssociety.org/site/TR/Bike/PAEBikeEvents?pg=entry&fr_id=25223"

showerbeer,3abo7p,facetiousmoose72,3,Thu Jun 18 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"Objective – anecdotally assess if a beer is my shower beverage of choice.  Conditions :   1)Must be limited to beverages I drink during the week (i.e. avoid creating delicious cocktails just for the sake of this assessment).  2)Must be an actual shower and have an actual reason to partake in shower beverage (i.e. no fake showering just for this assessment). 3)Must be cheeky and fun, because real science (and a real manuscript review) is usually a cold, harsh mistress.  Methods:  1)Beverages were selected based on my current suite of drinkable liquids in my fridge (photo 1) and bar (photo 2).  I selected 5 drinks total (photo 3), including 1 beer (photo 4). I did not randomly select the beer. Beers in my fridge (photo 1) are all blonds, hefes, or wheats so there is really no discernable difference among the various types. 2)I flipped a coin at each beverage to decide order. If a beverage received “heads” then that beverage was placed at the top of the queue (ok, those last 4 letters are unnecessary), if tails, it was placed at the bottom of the queue until the order was decided. 3)I took a fuckin’ shower, yo. This shower was brought to you by “I mowed the yard ,its 90 degrees out with 87% relative humidity, and I have some serious titty sweat goin-on”.  4)During this shower, I drank each beverage in the order of the queue. To avoid  “beverage belly” I only drank 1oz of each beverage.  Each beverage was poured into a 5oz Delmonico drinking glass (classy AF).  5)Upon each sip, I noted my initial thoughts in a “Rite in the Rain” all-weather journal using a #2 mechanical pencil.  6)I conducted no statistical analyzes for this assessment. I don’t bring my work home with me.   Results:  Results are provided in each photo caption (photos 5–15). I reported results as my initial reaction upon drinking each beverage. Beverages were not quantitatively ranked.   Discussion:  Beer was by far my favorite “post yard-work” shower beverage. I highly recommend one today. Other beers or beverages may be preferable for other situations (heartbreak, post-coitus, bad day, “I should sober up” shower), but that information is beyond the scope of this assessment. I encourage other users of this subreddit to replicate my study and post their findings on this sub. Please PM the OP for any particular methodological questions."

I remember a comment I made that reached about 20 or so downvotes before I said ""screw it, I'm just deleting my comment because everyone thought it was uncalled for."" All I said was that I had noticed in previous pictures OP had a different shower (regular white tile with a standard shower head vs a beautiful stone walled shower with a rain-style shower head) and it looks like they traded in their old shower for an upgrade.  They were apparently visiting their parents so maybe my comment might have come off as ""rude"" because it was pointing out that their actual shower isn't as nice? I don't know. Either way, my comment came off as uncalled for by many, many people on here."
showerbeer,39bq3e,dougsbeard,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:35:20 2015 UTC,It'd be nice to hear from one of the bravehearts exactly why your comment was uncalled for. Maybe because you took note of the redhead's shower? Maybe that can be seem as knowing too much detail. I don't think it's so terrible. Sorry to hear!
showerbeer,39bq3e,dougsbeard,3,Wed Jun 10 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe it was the thought that I went through and looked at previous pictures...but I was just admitting what most other people do anyways. I don't care if it's a dude or a girl, if there's something intriguing about your post I'll skim through your history and check out other posts, it's just human nature. I remember she was an attractive individual who was doing something clever so I wanted to see what other funny things she did for her pictures and maybe get an idea for a picture for myself. Either way...I contacted her directly and apologized if my comment came off as rude or uncalled for since the masses seemed to think it was negative or something.  I still don't know because it was still only bringing to light the shower upgrade. Oh well."

showerbeer,39bq3e,limpinfrompimpin,3,Wed Jun 10 18:34:00 2015 UTC,But what if it's not meant to be flirty. Just a compliment or a funny comment. I would say pming someone would be much creepier.

showerbeer,39bq3e,throneismelting,3,Wed Jun 10 18:49:32 2015 UTC,"I think we can agree there is a vague gray area we do not want the sub to cross. I think a lot of people throw their down votes out of fear of something spiraling out of control. In other words, they do not want to encourage people turning this place into a porn sub. Which seems weird to some people because this sub is already full of naked people. And it's okay to appreciate nakedness. But then where do we draw the line? I mean if a girl is just, extraordinarily attractive do we specifically try and not comment on it? If you're going to comment on it, what's the best way to make it into a joke like ""haha but seriously dat ass"". Sometimes comments like that are upvoted while ""wow you're pretty"" are downvoted. It's all very weird."
showerbeer,39bq3e,jwaterworth,2,Thu Jun 11 00:42:11 2015 UTC,"That line is what makes this beautiful.   Seriously. If you downvote it means you don't agree and for all the cowards that are just plainly downvoting, there is just simply no ruling on this from the mods. There is just the simple notion of being polite to another individual.  Again, if you click on the post listed above, my comment wasn't sexual. It wasn't spiraling. It wasn't speaking about anything but a short sweet and simple compliment. I even got a nice message from the OP, who once again, put her face and her brew out there on the internet.   I just see the awkward back and forth dance as hypocritical. If you think the fella/lady has nice eyes or is attractive, so long as you're not waxing poetry about what you'd do to them alone, what's the BFD?"

It comes down to being classy, I like to think we're a classy sub. Maintaining mystery is sometimes 100 times sexier than just showing a boob. At least that's my opinion. But things like full on gratuitous nudity just seems like we turn into a GW sub and the message is lost. The formula here is simple: Shower + Beer. The nakedness is there but it's not the focal point."
showerbeer,39bq3e,thedoorkeep,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"I mean... I guess I don't heavily disagree. However, close your eyes and imagine post after post of just hands, shower knobs and beer. Is this the same thing? Isn't there something a little more guiltily perverse about showing some skin and the beer? I like to think it's on the edge and because of that it's human nature to make a comment on the person.  I don't think anyone should be disrespected, as I've stated countless times, but I would argue that both the beer and nakedness ARE the focal point and therefore both are fair game to be commented on. Otherwise, why not just make this an extension of /r/beer?"

showerbeer,38ql2r,Bloedbibel,4,Sat Jun 6 15:00:42 2015 UTC,It doesn't need to exist. It only exists because a very few some small minded people on here get their panties all in a bunch if they see a tit or cock.
showerbeer,38ql2r,fosiacat,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:12:23 2015 UTC,"Dude it's not about the tits and cocks. I don't think you understand the argument.  I'm fine seeing boobs, but /r/showerbeer is, in my opinion, supposed to be about the beer. When a beautiful woman/man posts their tits and cocks, horny people (everybody, pretty much) make that the focus and upvote it, even if it is kind of a shitpost as far as showerbeer is concerned.  I am glad /r/showerbeergonewild exists, because then people who want to look at tits and cocks and showerbeers can upvote all the tits and cocks they want. Which is great! Everybody gets what they want! I don't think wanting a certain type of post in this specific subreddit makes me small minded."

showerbeer,37x2q9,PM_ME_YOUR_PANINIS,2,Sun May 31 14:21:36 2015 UTC,Don't worry! The can is actually resting on a decently sized ledge.
showerbeer,37x2q9,the10thD0CT0R,2,Mon Jun 1 15:31:35 2015 UTC,Holy crap!! The invisible man is having a Showerbeer!!!!
showerbeer,37wzwy,Dynisis,2,Sun May 31 02:36:12 2015 UTC,How is that beer for the price?
showerbeer,37wzwy,CGM1,1 point,Sun May 31 14:22:13 2015 UTC,Not quite as good as the newer Rebel Rider IPA they put out in my opinion. Its included in the current sampler along with a pilsner that's very light and super smooth. I'll admit I'm not huge into heavy IPAs but this one was aggressive to say the least.
showerbeer,37wzwy,abductee92,1 point,Sun May 31 21:54:49 2015 UTC,I quite enjoyed it. Not as in your face as some of the IPAs out there but still has a good kick (but a balanced kick).
