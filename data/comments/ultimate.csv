ultimate,3e3qez,ell_dubya,11,Tue Jul 21 22:35:14 2015 UTC,"I think it depends what level you're playing at, honestly. I do occasionally say sorry when playing club, but I say it far more often in pick-up or rec league when playing with less experienced players. I don't want them to get down on themselves or stop having fun because they feel like they're making a bunch of mistakes and hurting the team. If my throw wasn't spot-on or if I don't get to something that I know I should have, I'm going to say sorry so that they recognize that it wasn't their fault.  The article only looks at one angle of saying ""sorry"" during play. This is the other. It's not about dwelling on your mistake, it's about maintaining the confidence of one of your teammates, especially when you know that they doubt their skills in a particular way. I know when a turnover is my fault, and I would rather tell them that than let them blame themselves which, ultimately, would probably hurt the team more. Because I know I can throw better, that's why I'm sorry, whereas they might actually doubt themselves.  Also, in one of the examples in the article, if someone says ""sorry"" and that makes their teammate think ""well, not my fault!"" then your team isn't going to be successful anyway. That other teammate should try even harder to get to that throw to pick up their teammate, not use it as an excuse."
ultimate,3e3qez,minardif1,20,Tue Jul 21 20:25:26 2015 UTC,"The spirit of the article is good, but I disagree with removing sorry from the act of playing (outside of hurting another player in the authors exception).   The reality is, if I make a bad decision that hurts my team (ridiculous or unnecessary throw, stupid bite on a disc I shouldve left, etc), you better believe I'm apologizing.   And I would hope that my teammates would do the same.   Never apologize for having the right intention but a poor execution. But if you knowingly throw a crosswind hammer into heavy coverage on stall 2 after your team has just agreed to play ""chilly"", you SHOULD apologize."
ultimate,3e3qez,VanRolly,6,Tue Jul 21 20:24:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. My general policy is that I don't get angry at people for making physical mistakes, but I do for making mental ones that are preventable. I think ""sorry"" is the same- I would expect a person to be sorry if they make a preventable mental error, but not so much a physical one. However, I would still apologize for a physical error because I demand more from myself."
ultimate,3e3qez,Oysterous,3,Tue Jul 21 20:58:24 2015 UTC,"Frisbee is a game of millimeters, you're going to screw up eventually, and probably a whole lot during one play.  Sometimes it's obvious with a shitty throw or dropped catch.  Other times it's being slightly out of position on the force or while striking.    I don't need to hear a 'Sorry' every time you screw up, and for some people, all they do is beat themselves down over every single non-perfect play.  Sounds like this author is one of those (as am I), and for us, getting us to focus not on what we did wrong, but on the next play is very very important.    I coach teenage girls.  I know how fragile their confidence is.  I will probably be adopting the ""I'm a star"" instead of sorry method.    I think my point kind of got lost somewhere, it's simple, acknowledge your mistakes, but don't dwell on them.  Addendum; some people think going ""sorry"" or ""my bad"" absolves them of responsibility, and that also needs to be beaten out of them."

Related to this is when someone or the whole team is in a funk - typically when you're losing or things just aren't meshing right and people are getting pissed off.  The trick I recommend is, ""poop.""  Have everyone on the line say poop.  Nobody can do it without smiling which usually results in better play."

Off-season is the best time to build a base of strength that will last through and even be built on during the season.   Aerobic/anaerobic conditioning is definitely important, but it's also an athletic quality that can be trained quickly and disappears quickly, so it makes sense to focus on before the competitive season (spring for college), but not a ton before then. Strength takes longer to train and longer to disappear, and is harder to increase in-season when you have a lot of aerobic demands from practicing and playing.

As for hating gym workouts...is there anything about lifting that you enjoy?

ultimate,3dy7r5,ColdBeerAhh,4,Mon Jul 20 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"Several of the things used in tournaments and championships (tents, signage) make high winds extremely dangerous for athletes and spectators. In fact, wind can be ""fine"" to play in and still send tents cartwheeling across fields (especially if you haven't staked the tent).  Setting a mph max for both the base/expected wind speed and gusts would indeed be arbitrary, but would create guidance for organizers to offer both a safer environment and a more watchable product.  Perhaps some additional limits for the takedown of tents, restrictions for signage, etc.  The largest drawback is obviously the increased cost to participants/organization if their travel schedule is altered.  One way to adjust for that is to reduce the number of tournament games when high wind is forecasted so you can attempt to schedule around the worst of it. Not perfect, but a start."

Some teams decided to cancel their games or leave early (the main route home for most players was at risk of being shut due to the weather).

That said, there is another category of ""extremely windy, so windy that even the best players in the world are having difficulty completing basic passes,"" and I think (in the distant future when this is logistically/financially possible) it would make sense to have some cutoff past which the games get delayed to the next day, cause those types of games really aren't fun to play or watch.

Cutting Tree - Based off of this Sky'd post; helps me stay active as a cutter if I find myself stationary. Breathe - After making any catch, I want to take a notable breath in/out so I don't rush any decisions and can survey the field. Break - Be active with the disc when handling; manipulate my mark in some way; hand the disc ready to be thrown to either side [neutral position].   On defense:     Disc - sneak a peak at where the disc is/who has it. This allows me to get in specific positions relative to my mark. Can the disc holder throw big? Where is the disc relative to me/my mark? Triangle - I try to incorporate the triangle mark if I am trying to stop any/all break throws [which I rarely do, I'll usually lean towards no around or no inside]. HELP - Is my mark being lazy? How can I help my teammates? Most importantly, if any huck goes up to anyone, CHASE IT DOWN. Unless it is a great throw on a fast line, odds are I can catch up and help make a play. This goes for offense as well.   I'll edit others I think of."
ultimate,3dukf1,RobPG,7,Sun Jul 19 18:09:23 2015 UTC,Great post.   Be active with the disc when handling; manipulate my mark in some way;   Just wanted to second this.  Not moving while holding the disc doesn't make sense to me.  I want to see exactly how the mark is going to react to me so I know how to properly set them up when I need to throw.  I'm actively thinking about what space the mark is going to give to me.  Looking past the mark is the best way to get blocked.
ultimate,3dukf1,stultus_respectant,3,Mon Jul 20 07:08:51 2015 UTC,"I hear you on this.  At the same time, moving without purpose can be counter-productive.

Sometimes that involves moving.  Sometimes it doesn't."
ultimate,3dukf1,zeledonia,3,Tue Jul 21 06:46:07 2015 UTC,"At the same time, moving without purpose can be counter-productive   Good point.  I'm definitely talking about moving with purpose.   Lots of new players are taught to pivot frequently, and people get so focused on that that they miss things happening downfield.   Yes, absolutely.  I appreciate the clarification of the point.   In general, I'm trying to set up the throw I want to throw. Sometimes that involves moving. Sometimes it doesn't.   In general, yes.  I will say that at the high levels (in my experience) it becomes a lot less about what you want, and a lot more about what you're given.  For example: I can't expect a single, late pivot will grant me my second choice, and I can't expect a mark that even makes my first (and possibly only) choice easy.  People may also have different ideas about what's mean by ""moving"", which I don't restrict to pivoting.  My hands are active, there may be fakes, I may lean, or use my head, etc.  The point is that with a good mark, I should feel out my options, and whether the movement to do that is subtle or overt, I can't do that being static."
ultimate,3dukf1,stultus_respectant,5,Tue Jul 21 19:20:22 2015 UTC,"I think its normal to have simple, non verbal thoughts. Some things that advance your game are starting to think about timing cuts for when a handler receives the disc, cutting deep off strike cuts, cutting breakside as the disc is moving across the field, etc.   Zone O is a bit more complicated but the same principles apply, since you want to think about attacking unoccupied space and timing your cuts off the other cutters and the disc.   In general, things you should be aware of are how your defender is positioned, where on the field you are relative to the disc, who has the disc, where is the disc likely to go next, where are the other cutters, where are they likely to cut next, and where on the field is the empty space. Then figure out how to make a cut into empty space without cutting off another cutter, doing so to exploit your defender's positioning, and timing it so a handler can throw it into that space easily."
ultimate,3dukf1,b3tzy,10,Sun Jul 19 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"Also, it's not necessarily about having more complex thoughts, it's about expanding awareness.

ultimate,3dukf1,diazona,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:56 2015 UTC,"Like /u/b3tzy said there's a lot to be aware of, but it becomes kind of instinctive after a while. I think you can sum up a lot of it like this:   if I'm on offense, where is the best place for me to be 3 seconds from now to help my team advance the disc? if I'm on defense, where is the best place for the person I'm guarding to be 3 seconds from now to help their team advance the disc? if I'm marking the thrower, where is the best place (best for them) for the disc to be 3 seconds from now? Although in this case you mostly just hold a force, so you can focus more on watching the thrower and less about thinking which side you should be on.   This doesn't necessarily make it any easier, because in order to figure out the best place for anyone to be in 3 seconds, you have to be aware of where everyone is and where the disc is, and how your team's formation works, and how the other team's formation works, and all that. I think new players who haven't really internalized how the stack works (or anyone who's running a new formation) will have a hard time keeping track of all that. But once you've done it long enough, it becomes very natural to look at what's going on on the field and have a sense of where you (or someone else) needs to be next."

This is incorrect - note the rules posted by OP never actually say ""add two to the higher score and play from there"".  This is one of the reasons soft caps are stupid and just should never be used, since there isn't any defining language in the rules.  (slightly hyperbole - detailed explanation below).  ""Soft Cap"" is simply a maximum score to which teams play after a certain time has elapsed (and the current point has ended) - it could be anything.  Add 2 to the current high score.  12.  Double the lower teams score.  It can be anything (and is almost never actually posted in the rules of the tournament / league as to what the soft cap actually is for that event, because, well, nobody actually bothers to read the rules), though add 2 to the higher score and play to that value is the most common.  Hard cap, on the other hand, is better in every way, as there is no room for confusion or interpretation.  ""Finish the current point.  Is someone winning?  Great, they win.  If not, play one more so the score is not a tie"".  ""But lordlardass, soft caps are so great because they give losing teams a chance to catch up.""     So does not playing like shit and having some sort of time management.  Soft cap, these days, is basically used as simply a warning that the hard cap is coming soon.  Just replace the soft cap with a 10 minute hard cap warning and your tournament will run more smoothly.  The problem with a soft cap is that you never know when the game would end.  If a team is losing 5-11 in a game to 15 and the soft cap goes on, assuming the ""add two"" style soft cap, you could still have to play 9 more points.  9 points!  Or maybe just two...who knows?  The game could take another half an hour or more, but usually the soft cap gives you 10 or 15 minutes only, which, well, just doesn't matter.  ""Come on, lordlardass, we all want to see that epic comeback!""  Sure, yeah, we all do.  I've been involved in ultimate for almost two decades now and I can say with absolute certainty, at all tournaments I've played in, coached, observed, run, watched, streamed, etc. no more than 5% have ever had a soft-capped team come from behind and win.  Not that it doesn't happen, but, it is really rare (again, mostly due to the short amount of time given to soft caps).  Keep in mind, again, that if a game makes it to the soft cap, teams aren't scoring quickly, so the likelyhood of a team just popping off a bunch of points is pretty low (especially since, at that point, all the winning team needs to do is to drag the game out to the hard cap which is easy with 90 seconds between points and time-outs).  ""Fuck you, lordlardass, we love the soft cap and we want to keep it!""  That's fine - I don't think the soft cap is inherently bad, it's just used in terrible ways at most tournaments.  If you have time at your tournament to run 2 hour rounds, a 30 minute soft-cap isn't a bad idea, especially if you don't want to hard cap your finals.  30 minutes is ""probably"" plenty of time for your soft-capped teams to mount their comeback, especially since you probably gave them 80 minutes or so to play (80 minutes play time + 30 minute soft cap + hard cap + 10 minutes to finish final point if needed / get to next game), but anything less than that and, again, basically the soft cap is just there as a warning for the hard cap.  Unfortunately, 90 minute rounds are much more prominent at non-championship, which generally follows a sort of 75 minutes play, 10 minutes soft cap, hard cap, 5 extra minutes, which is just not helpful, but playing 60 minutes with 25 minutes soft cap could allow for the catch-up time, but could also see teams winning playing a handful of 60 minute games.  TL;DR - soft cap (in its current form) is not often implemented correctly at all (because of how it is explained in the official rules) and is often implemented poorly, where it is basically just a warning that the hard cap is approaching."
ultimate,3dwai7,lordlardass,2,Mon Jul 20 05:33:39 2015 UTC,"I have 2 issues with hard caps as described here. Firstly, they give an incentive for a leading team to run down the clock. Defence is difficult in ultimate, and any good team can keep hold of the disc for minutes at a time if they need to. That makes for a game which isn't particularly fun to watch, play, or otherwise be a participant in. Secondly, it means that a team with a buffer doesn't really need to try, so the last minutes of a match can be very anticlimactic."
ultimate,3dwai7,blackrat47,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:31:23 2015 UTC,"Defence is difficult in ultimate, and any good team can keep hold of the disc for minutes at a time if they need to   Good teams can also just score, though, which is much more likely than trying a soccer style pass the disc around for 5 minutes without a mistake.  Teams are much more effective when running their offense than trying to ""wing it"" and just not fuck up.   That makes for a game which isn't particularly fun to watch, play, or otherwise be a participant in.   In a tournament, games are played to be won, they aren't played to be exciting to watch, or fun to play necessarily.  If my team is a lot taller than yours we're gonna huck it over you all the time.  That isn't going to be fun for you either, do you think we have an obligation to not play that way?   Secondly, it means that a team with a buffer doesn't really need to try, so the last minutes of a match can be very anticlimactic.   The issue, though, is that the games need to end at some point, and at some point according to a schedule.  The hard cap is just saying ""you guys ran out of time and we have a schedule to keep"".  It isn't the cap's fault that you lost.  For instance, I was observing a game where one team had better clock management, were up two points, had possession of the disc, and called a Time Out to effectively end the game.  For the championship.  I'm sure the team that lost feels like the cap screwed them...but that is absolutely not the case - the fact that they dropped the opening pull and then immediately gave up two breaks to start the game really put them behind early...it wasn't the cap's fault...the cap was just there to keep the schedule (in this case, so people could get home).  Yes, soft caps are better if you want games to have a CHANCE to be exciting, you just have to give them a lot of time to play out, which can cause the ""actual"" game portion to be cut short which can make teams feel like they didn't get to actually play."
ultimate,3dwai7,lordlardass,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:34:46 2015 UTC,I'm in total agreement that hard cap is the way to go. I'm just saying that any tournament I've ever played at with a soft cap did the add 2 rule.

The first is a warning, but two in a game or three in a tournament is an ejection.  Also, in the US, the receiver could call dangerous play, which would send the disc back to the thrower even though it was not catchable. It seems to be considered a pretty weak call though.  I assume the retaliation thing is a joke. Don't do that."

Absolutely false.  If the disc was not catchable, it is not a receiving foul, thus the disc is not awarded, nor would the disc go back to the thrower.  Dangerous play can render the timing of a foul moot, but it cannot change a general foul to a receiving foul/throwing foul.  If you are just talking about a non-observed game, the receiver could make the claim and get it sent back, but that wouldn't be any different than a player's ability to make any sort of unsubstantiated call.  Note, my comments are just regarding to bigg_nate's comment, it is not any comment regarding my interpretation of the play in question."

ultimate,3dt12w,bigg_nate,2,Mon Jul 20 15:10:04 2015 UTC,"I will let Colin answer this as the head of the SRC. Members of the SRC have recently been involved in this discussion and the opposite was stated.  IMO, there is a huge problem in the ""back to the thrower"" outcome as the question then becomes ""At what point does it not go back to the thrower?""  Is the line drawn when the dangerous play is after a turnover occurs (the disc landed)? When the disc stops?  At what point is the receiver far enough away that they aren't even considered part of the play?  To me the cleanest line is ""when the disc isn't catchable"" as we are treating general fouls as general fouls and receiving fouls and receiving fouls.  I don't see how dangerous play suddenly changes one foul into another when timing isn't the determining factor."

However, I have about 5-6 friends who have used this to replace their other gloves, and as far as I know, they haven't had any issues after a season of playing.  It's worth noting that these gloves stand out so much compared others in other ways, too. Unlike with other gloves, it took me about 5-10 throws total to go from a bare-handed player, to a Mint-wearing player.

It looked like every single close line call went to the advisors, at least in the men's final. If that's going to happen, it seems to me that the line calls should just be active.  I don't think you eject someone merely for one dangerous bid. PMFs would have been the perfect response to both of those plays. It's tough to tell without being on the field, but I think a quick word with the captains and/or the players involved might have been better than a spirit timeout.

ultimate,3drgaq,rjhberg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:36:26 2015 UTC,I played with game advisors in Lecco. My team went to play offs on the open side. I think you should vet game advisors more. They should have a better understanding and how they word things. They are there to advise not force their opinions on people. But I think that is often because they mix up roles. More active calls would be nice. Just look at in and out active calls when players go to game advisors for their opinion their opinion is always taken as the outcome.
ultimate,3drgaq,Frolic3,2,Sun Jul 19 14:51:10 2015 UTC,"Ruben,  I think it should be stressed that Game Advisors are perfectly allowed to say ""I don't know"", they aren't referees and don't have to make a call or have an opinion if they legitimately aren't sure.

How is a Spirit Time Out with both teams acknowledging that things are going out of hand any worse than a third party stepping in and ruling for them?

Obviously some are more egregious than others (and the really bad ones are almost always the case of very poor judgment), and if you play enough frisbee at a high level it is likely that at some point you will make a play that crosses the line.

The college answers were already done, but here's a bit more regarding club:   No owners, but a lot of high level teams are using coaches now. It's not required and there still are teams without coaches, but the best of the best are mostly coached now. USAultimate.org features the Triple Crown Tour. It's a series of tournaments for teams (invite only) that allows interconnectivity between teams. It gets Elite teams from all around the country attending the same tournaments, and sometimes allows for lower level teams to compete at the same tournaments. Want to be the best? Beat the best!   Their tier system is the following:  Classic (new teams, pretty much. teams that usually aren't about competing, but more so about playing ultimate and having fun!)  Select (more competitive. A lot of mid-tier teams here. It's the middle of the pack teams from each region)  Top Select (The first team that did NOT qualify for Nationals from a specific region)  Elite (Bottom 8 from Nationals in previous year)  Pro (Top 8 from Nationals in previous year)  Other tournaments are sanctioned by USAultimate, but are not part of the Triple Crown Tour (TCT). These tournaments invite whoever they want and the games still do count in the rankings. Rankings are what decide bids to nationals. Each region gets a certain number of bids, depending on how teams finish in the rankings. Each region is guaranteed one bid, but for every team that finishes in the top 16 of the rankings after the 1st team (who receives an automatic bid because each region is guaranteed one bid), another bid is added.  That was probably confusing.  3 . Club teams travel around the country playing at tournaments. No home-fields.  4 . Players mostly. Though USAultimate does pay  prize money to the winners of some tournaments. Bigger prizes for the more competitive tournaments.  5 . At the end of the season, Nationals occurs. Each teams region winner attends, along with teams that won the secondary (sometimes more) bid that their region qualified for in the rankings.  6 . Yes! There's Masters and Grandmasters ultimate. The format is a little different than above (there's not much of a regular season), but opportunities are still around to play."

ultimate,3dkqfr,echo-engee,6,Fri Jul 17 01:39:50 2015 UTC,"I've never had a good answer for this, as the defender in an unobserved game. The choices are basically  (1) Get the D, create the dangerous contact, or  (2) Pull up, let the offense catch the disc, call dangerous play, have a long and painful discussion with the other team who thinks it's a weak call, and eventually send the disc back to the thrower.  With observers, option (2) becomes more palatable because at least the observer might rule in your favor."
ultimate,3dkqfr,bigg_nate,7,Fri Jul 17 03:19:42 2015 UTC,Without contact you can't call dangerous play (you were able to avoid contact by stopping so your opponent must not have moved in a way that was unavoidable to you).  See Colin's answer below
ultimate,3dkqfr,DanD8,3,Fri Jul 17 04:07:15 2015 UTC,The league I play in does actually allow you to call dangerous play without contact...
ultimate,3dkqfr,skyrider55,5,Fri Jul 17 06:29:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have specified, per USAU 11th edition, there needs to be contact for the call.  I don't know if I agree with it, I can see valid arguments for both sides but that's the was USAU has it written.  Not sure about WFDF."
ultimate,3dkqfr,DanD8,7,Fri Jul 17 06:47:27 2015 UTC,"you can call dangerous play in WFDF without contact, in the interpretations it says in 17.1   ""Dangerous Play fouls can be called before an event to avoid a potential collision e.g. a defender runs/layouts in a way that an accident would occur if the offence were to continue. When this occurs it is correct to not make a play on the disc & to call a ‘dangerous play’ foul. Players calling a Dangerous Play foul before a potential incident need to have reasonable grounds for doing so. They should actually be able to see the on coming player and have some reason to believe that player will not avoid contact – this could include a previous history of that player to not avoid contact.""  Pretty tough call to make though, when called I've only ever seen it retracted pretty quickly"
ultimate,3dkqfr,unimaginativedan,2,Fri Jul 17 11:39:33 2015 UTC,"Wait, so, you have to have your leg broken before you call dangerous play. The point of the call (in WFDF), is basically for situations where you can make the call to avoid contact which could cause injury, without impacting the ""Foul"" call.   I mean, what does it cover in USAU that the ""Foul"" call doesn't?"
ultimate,3dkqfr,glbotu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:43:18 2015 UTC,"No, in USAU, they advise you to try and make the play without contact, if contact occurs because of your opponent (hopefully) it is very minimal because you did your best to avoid the contact.    This covers more than just a general foul call because a dangerous play call on a disc in the air would give the disc to the person making the call regardless of whether the outcome of the play was affected.  For instance, defense comes in and skies a stationary offensive player and knocks the disc away, after the disc is well out of bounds the defense lands on the offense.  If you just cited a regular foul that wouldn't be enough to give the offense the disc because the contact did not affect the outcome of the play.  However, a dangerous play call would give the offense the disc regardless of whether the contact was before or after the disc being knocked away."
ultimate,3dkqfr,DanD8,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:30:23 2015 UTC,"No requirement for a broken leg (or severe contact) under USAU. The big thing it covers is contact that happens after the block that wouldd not otherwise be covered under the receiving foul rules (WFDF difference). Also eliminates discussion of who initiated contact or if it was a tie, if one person was reckless."

ultimate,3dkqfr,bigg_nate,3,Fri Jul 17 05:26:44 2015 UTC,"Yup.    In reality, I've only ever seen 1) players play through, either leading to a collision or a near-collision; or 2) one of the players pull up a bit and play on with the outcome.  I've never seen anyone have the wherewithal within the moment or the desire (because it would feel lame) to call dangerous play.    I suspect there's nothing in the rules that would give a clear answer to how to address this.  I'm curious to know how observers would want to deal with this in both observed and unobserved games."
ultimate,3dkqfr,mdotbeezy,3,Fri Jul 17 03:44:34 2015 UTC,"I think truest answer is that players should be tought to not run where they aren't looking.   I find that many players are unable to look away from a disc they intent to catch, no matter far away, temporily, the point of catch is. You notice this all the time on bladey hucks - people watch the damn throw all the way, rather than doing a read-n-run. It's much tougher to teach in an upline scenario, but maybe someone ought to experiment with this."
ultimate,3dkqfr,ColinMcI,8,Fri Jul 17 22:49:00 2015 UTC,"Be aware of your surroundings. Proceed safely, in a way that you are in control of your body and can avoid a collision. Make sure to avoid the collision, and attempt to still make the play.  If the opponent makes a dangerous play and makes contact with you, even while you tried to avoid the collision, call a dangerous play. If there is no contact, you cannot call dangerous play.  It's not perfect. But there is definitely middle ground between creating a dangerous collision and bailing out on the play completely. And entering safely into that middle ground is where you'll find safer and more acceptable outcomes.  XVI.H.4: Reckless disregard for the safety of fellow players or other dangerously aggressive behavior (such as significantly colliding into a stationary opponent), regardless of whether or when the disc arrives or when contact occurs  Annotation: If no contact occurs, there is no callable dangerous play. Contact need not be severe."

ultimate,3dkqfr,blackrat47,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:41:57 2015 UTC,"This is an issue close to my heart, as it was in this situation that someone totalled my knee (I was the dump cutter).   Under WFDF, it should be up to the person coming from the upfield to get close enough that they had a bid, then call dangerous play. In the discussion, they should state that both players equally had a bid on the disc, but that neither player could make that bid without initiating dangerous contact, and that therefore the disc should go back. Anyone watching should be able to confirm that situation.   It's slightly different if the dump  cutter starts moving considerably before upfield player, because then the upfield player is moving in such a way that the dump cutter cannot reasonably avoid initiating contact."
ultimate,3dkqfr,cudlax,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:28:35 2015 UTC,"Did anyone see the Nightlock-Schwa game at the US Open which was streamed? I was wondering about this type of call when Kaylor got a big block on Laurenza. The D itself was completely clean, until the follow through Kaylor's bid ended up taking her into Laurenza's leg, up-ending her. Luckily it was more of a glancing blow so no one was seriously injured, but it could've been quite bad considering Kaylor's trajectory and speed. I believe Laurenza called a foul, which was thrown out by the observer. How would a dangerous play call have gone, I wonder?  edit: linked here. Possibly not as bad as I remembered, still a close call for the receiver's left leg if it had been planted."
ultimate,3dkqfr,Pearberr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:42:21 2015 UTC,"Speaking as one of the Referees for the AUDL, I would call a double unsportsmanlike conduct in the play that you described.   It is the responsibility of all players to act in a manner that avoids dangerous contact. If both players bid for a 50/50 disc and there is a dangerous collision, I will call double unsportsmanlike. Assuming nobody caught the disc, the fouls are offsetting, and would go back to the spot of the throw. In the AUDL at least, this has the bonus of marking down the names and numbers. Another unsportsmanlike is an ejection.   How does this relate to club? I have no idea. There hasn't been an observer clinic where I am from in a few years so I just play my very casual Sunday pickup and didn't worry until I started refereeing. Sorry if this doesn't help."
ultimate,3dkqfr,chubs45,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:21:15 2015 UTC,"My stance on this is that if one of the two players can safely avoid the contact - it is not a dangerous play. A dangerous play is made when a player who could have avoided contact did not do so. If no play can be made without contact, then you simply just do not have a play on the disc.  The idea is that if a handler is going upline for the strike and a poaching defender must contact him to make a play on the disc then that defender did not have a legal play to make. It doesn't matter if they ""thought that they make a clean play"", just that they tried to get the D and blindsided a receiver.  To me, it's similar to boxing someone out in the endzone. A huck goes up and a receiver takes a position to catch it in the endzone. If the defender must go through the receiver's body to make the play, then he simply was out-positioned and had no play to make. I don't think any of us would be arguing that it would be a dangerous play to go through someone's back who has bodied you out.   The only time that it becomes ambiguous for me is when both players mutually recognize the danger in going for the disc. If the handler going strike notices the defender with plenty of time to avoid contact and they both collide going for the disc, it is a dangerous play on both parts and the disc should return to the thrower. Both players were available to avoid the contact but chose not to do so.  Thoughts?"
ultimate,3dkqfr,ddtink,-2,Fri Jul 17 15:41:03 2015 UTC,Id say dont throw these throws. It may sound dumb but i have always been taught and i always urge my teammates not to throw dangerous passes like this especially.
ultimate,3dkqfr,gymineer,7,Fri Jul 17 03:06:12 2015 UTC,"I've heard this response to this situation before, and while I agree that it is very good advice, it doesn't address the problem.   This same situation could be caused by a thrower trying to swing the disc, the disc being tipped by the mark, and then floating down between a receiver and a defender who are running towards the disc from different directions. What happens next?   One of the problems I have is that - especially as the level of competition increases - the idea of calling a dangerous play almost goes out the window. I honestly can't imagine anyone calling a dangerous play in any of the high level games I've been in.   I called one once in a pick up game because a player was running towards me looking back at the disc, and I absolutely could have got the D, but at least one of us would have been seriously injured. He just threw the disc back, huffed at me as if I had insulted him, and held a grudge the rest of the game. And that is typically the result you'll find - the player who caught the disc  will be thinking ""I just made a great play - if you could have gotten to the disc, then you should have"". They treat the dangerous play call as if you are accusing them of intentionally doing something dangerous, and they know they didn't intentionally do anything dangerous.   On the other side of the coin - in a high level game, the defender can't peel off if they believe they can get to the disc. They have to go for it - because they know that if they call a ""dangerous play"" it will be argued and either the point will stand, or the disc will go back to the thrower. Both of those results are world's away from getting a D and taking possession of the disc.   The imperfect answer is that the player who can see the collision coming should peel off, but this player also needs to be trusted in his judgement, the same way we're suppose to trust players with other aspects of this self-officiated game.   If I am the handler running upline, I catch the disc in the endzone, and then someone says ""dangerous play"" while they are standing there - my initial reaction is not going to be a pleasant one. But, hopefully that player is honest in his evaluation, and at the end of the day I am thankfully that he peeled off and I was healthy enough to play the rest of the tournament."
ultimate,3dkqfr,glbotu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:51:01 2015 UTC,"They treat the dangerous play call as if you are accusing them of intentionally doing something dangerous, and they know they didn't intentionally do anything dangerous.   I mean, that's just bad spirit. They should know that in all versions of the rules of Ultimate, no-one intentionally breaks the rules. As such, in your dangerous play call, everyone should assume that something dangerous would have happened because of not noticing, being out of lines of sight, or just playing hard and accept it. Makes sense to ask a 3rd party perspective to make sure, but no-one should be thinking they're being accused of intentionally breaking the rules, because that's not how ultimate is played.   That said, one of the 2 times I've ever called dangerous play, the other team was intentionally breaking the rules and that game ended pretty sourly."
ultimate,3dkqfr,DanD8,2,Fri Jul 17 12:41:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is obvious.    It still happens at every level, though.  A safe upline becomes a dangerous one if the thrower accidentally leads the receiver too much; high stalls can cause players to miss poaches and make poor decisions.  What I'm hoping is that there's something in the rules that both prevents these collisions from happening but also leads to a sensible outcome.  For this particular scenario, I think the sensible outcome would be that the defender is awarded the disc.  That becomes ambiguous when the disc is closer to the offense than the defense and a bunch of other hypotheticals.  My point, though, is that the offense shouldn't be given a do-over, let alone the disc, when it's their fault (as I suspect you'd agree) that the dangerous situation occurred in the first place."
ultimate,3dkqfr,2_Sheds_Jackson,3,Fri Jul 17 03:39:03 2015 UTC,"While the offense's throw created the situation, anyone who sees the potential for a bad collision and doesn't take steps to avoid it is at fault per USAU.    In my mind these plays, if they do result in contact, are almost always dangerous plays on the defender.  The offense is looking back over their shoulder at the thrower and disc for most, if not all of the cut depending on the throw.  The defender on the other hand has the thrower, the disc, and the handler all in the same couple degrees of vision usually.  They have a lot more time to see and react to the potential collision. They can do their best to take a path to the disc without crashing through the offense.  Maybe I'm biased though, I have fractured my skull on this play as the handler when the defense was a step too slow and put their shoulder through the side of my head after I caught it."
ultimate,3dkqfr,DanD8,-2,Fri Jul 17 06:24:12 2015 UTC,"My disagreement with your position cannot be more absolute.  A cutter going up line has the complete responsibility to determine if and where the poaches are coming from.  This can be done prior to the throw.  Also, there is no reason to tunnel on the disc once it is thrown.  Typically on these plays there is time to peak to see what is coming and then return to the flight of the disc.  In short, the cut is dangerous, the throw is dangerous, and the offense should recognize this and be prepared to duck."
ultimate,3dkqfr,2_Sheds_Jackson,2,Fri Jul 17 11:13:30 2015 UTC,"I'm describing the situation where the poach doesn't come until after the cut has started.  I think we can all agree that the offense is obligated to not run over a defensive player that is standing still out in the lane.  In the OP, this situation we are addressing is where a defensive player has seen a disc they can D but recognizing that it would result in potentially bad contact.  To me, if you recognize bad contact would occur due to a play you want to make, don't make it and assume you'll win the game of chicken."
ultimate,3dkqfr,DanD8,0,Fri Jul 17 11:50:25 2015 UTC,"I understand the situation, however, I contend that the potential for the poach should be apparent when the cut is made.  Once the disc leads the receiver up line the potential for contact should be expected and the offensive player should look for it.    Not to mention that the offensive player whose defense is poaching should be screaming a warning of the poach.    All in all I hate the way a good play by the defense is cut short by a horrible play by the offense."
ultimate,3dkqfr,2_Sheds_Jackson,2,Fri Jul 17 13:59:27 2015 UTC,It's not a good play by the defense if you couldn't get to the disc before contact.
ultimate,3dkqfr,mgdmitch,2,Fri Jul 17 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"No argument with your point.    However, if the defense can get to the disc first, but risks a collision with an oblivious cutter (who is looking the other way), then the rules seem to state that the defense needs to back off.  This is not good."
ultimate,3dkqfr,2_Sheds_Jackson,2,Fri Jul 17 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"The rule is written with safety in mind.  That is a good thing.  I've seen this play out terribly several times (concussion, broken bones, torn ACL, etc). The player with everything in front of him/her has a much easier time assessing the situation rather than a player that has to be constantly swiveling their head 180 degrees between their path and the disc. The cutter isn't absolved of looking where their going, but their ability to react to what's behind them comes in finite chunks while the defender's is almost purely continuous.  That's the difference."

Kaczmarek and Hogan are always great to listen to for their cerebral understanding of the game. Roca because he's the inverse of the two aforementioned coaches, and just a hoot to listen to. Heather Ann Brauer - she has an unparalleled vision and drive for what she wants to see in the sport, and is someone who we should all collectively be paying a lot more attention to Qxhna - basically everything I just said about Heather. One of the hardest working people in the community. Kevin Minderhout - I think there is a compelling angle to be found for how he's remained a very important figure in ultimate despite the fall of (RIP) NGN. The new project with Jim Gerencser & All-Star Ultimate is really intriguing Jim Gerencser - E.R.I.C. founder, tirelessly optimistic and one of the best galvanizing forces for raising the expectations of what we as players/members of the community can do off the field. His work and the way he has gotten people committed in the Bay Area is astounding, I think   There are literally dozens more, but those are the bigs names that come to mind."

ultimate,3diqc0,samonchips,3,Thu Jul 16 16:46:45 2015 UTC,"Yes. Usually the defender wont just be out of bounds though, but will come from in bounds past the offensive player who is forced to stop at the OB line to make his play and then the defender will make the play."

It's just out at that location.  You may sometimes note a defense player weighing the pros and cons of D'ing the disc if they are unsure if an offensive player could have a play or not."
ultimate,3diqc0,mtrowb,4,Thu Jul 16 23:03:44 2015 UTC,"WFDF rules:  11.2. The out-of-bounds area consists of the area which is not in-bounds and everything in contact with it, except for defensive players, who are always considered “in-bounds” for purposes of making a play on the disc"

So as /u/team-orange said you are not in-bounds just because you contact an IB-player. If however you manage to land and stay on top of the receiver without touching the ground AND without a dangerous play you are still IB."
ultimate,3diqc0,sinembarg0,3,Fri Jul 17 10:27:13 2015 UTC,"Yes. The disc is considered out of bounds at the point of contact (you don't ""bring it back to where it went out"")"
ultimate,3diqc0,mdotbeezy,2,Thu Jul 16 23:01:59 2015 UTC,"If a defender is out of bounds and MACs/deflects the disc, what happens?  IX.E says   A disc becomes out-of-bounds when it first contacts the out-of-bounds area, contacts an out-of-bounds offensive player, or is caught by an out-of-bounds defensive player.   can an in bounds offender catch it after this MAC/deflection?"
ultimate,3diqc0,zeledonia,3,Thu Jul 16 21:34:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, a defender can deflect the disc, then an in-bounds offensive player can still make a play on it. I believe this was NOT the case in 10th edition, defensive OB contact made the disc out of bounds.   This is probably more relevant for a mark standing out of bounds and getting a partial handblock.   However, when an offensive player touches the disc, it is immediately considered out of bounds at the location the disc crossed the sideline."
ultimate,3diqc0,mgdmitch,3,Thu Jul 16 23:04:46 2015 UTC,"I remember cases (under 10th edition) where defenders argued that because they tipped the disc when they had a foot out-of-bounds, the disc should be down at that point.  I remember an argument about it at College Easterns where a marker with one foot out of bounds tipped a huck, which came back in and was caught ~50 yards downfield.  I think the disc was actually ruled OB and brought back to the point of the marker.  IIRC the USAU rules at the time (early 2000s) were either not clear or not well understood by the parties involved."
ultimate,3diqc0,epicmoustache,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:27:56 2015 UTC,that indeed was the rule under 9th. OB at the point of contact with an OB defender.
ultimate,3dio5b,samonchips,5,Thu Jul 16 16:10:06 2015 UTC,"I think you have a bias toward big plays i.e. it probably happens on all plays, but because you reflect on big plays more and want to remember every single detail of the play the memory seems more fuzzy.  I think the exceptions are the bad plays you made. This has actually been researched, and the school of thought is that it is an evolutionary advantage to remember bad experiences and forget good ones because you need to learn from the bad ones in order to survive (the good ones don't do you as much good)."
ultimate,3dio5b,Myburgher,3,Thu Jul 16 19:12:29 2015 UTC,"Thats a really good point, I hadnt thought about it like that. It makes sense too.

I fractured my left arm in a similar way and played for another hour before I realized it wasn't just the sprain I thought it was.  Adrenaline is funny that way, and in high pressure games like this, you have a lot to focus on and push through already.  I absolutely agree you shouldn't play hurt.  In my case, I severely underestimated the injury due to adrenaline and the local shock/numbness.  I'm willing to believe he might have not had good enough perspective on it."
ultimate,3dfclh,-dustyRhodes,3,Thu Jul 16 07:19:35 2015 UTC,"The more interesting question is ""How do you stop someone from playing injured if they, either by choice or being unaware, do not inform anyone of the injury?""  I'm neither lauding nor condemning playing hurt, just hoping that we consider the whole picture.  It is very easy to not recognize the difference between injured and hurt.  It is also an individual decision w/r/t what is too much or too little pain and/or lasting damage for that individual's own personal body."

ultimate,3dduok,captainsnide,7,Wed Jul 15 21:08:43 2015 UTC,"In David Epstein’s recent book ""The Sports Gene – What Makes the Perfect Athlete"", David tells the story of ""two high jumpers"". One has trained his entire life – living close to good facilities and good coaches. Starting as a child he has carefully conditioned his body to jump as high as possible – achieving world class status. His name is Stefan Holm and when examined scientists found that his purposeful practice over many years had hardened his left tendon to a point where it took a force of 1.8 tons to stretch it a single centimetre. This is four time what you will measure in the average man. This allowed Holm to not only clinch the 2004 Olympic title despite being very short for a high jumper. Lesson #1: Carefully and correct training of running and jumping (with proper landings) can condition your Achilles tendon until it becomes able to absorb massive force and create impressive rebounding – for the runner this translate directly to speed.  Of interest to those of us who are not genetic freaks is that Holm’s Achilles tendon had a relatively normal size. Not so for Bahamian Donald Thomas. While Holm worked for over 10 years before he was ready for the 2007 World Championships, Donald Thomas had 8 months training. He was not really a high jumper – his main interest was “slam-dunking” – but despite utilising a technique that many derided as “offensive”, it would be Thomas who triumphed and won the World Championship. One explanation coaches found was Thomas unusually long Achilles tendon for a person his height: 10 and a quarter inches (26 cm).   http://www.championseverywhere.com/article-all-about-the-achilles-tendon"

ultimate,3dfnoc,andinator1,2,Wed Jul 15 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Ive got some good experience with this:  2008 broke my right 5th meta, had surgery.  2010 broke my left 5th meta, no surgery.  2012 broke the left again, no surgery again.    My best advice is that no matter what route you take, sticking to the rehab program and making sure you are all the way healed before you hit it full time again is the best way to prevent setbacks.  I had surgery in 2008 after breaking it at college sectionals because I was competing in the Ironman triathlon 4 months later and wanted to be sure it would heal.  I was told quicker heal time and I was all about that.  It was not any quicker than my other two times, but has the nice benefit of seemingly never being at risk again.  Surgery was pretty expensive, which was the main reason I didn't get it the next two times (and I wasn't training for a huge event and both times were very near the end of club season).  I rushed back after the first time on my left foot and probably could have taken better precautions, which is why I think it happened again.  My advice:  If surgery is within your financial means, and you are willing to commit to the rehab, go for it.  Be prepared for all the suck that goes along with surgery including more pain than you are in now.   If you feel like you'd rather save some money, give yourself more time than you think you need to heal.  Adjust your habits (and your cleats?) to prevent it again.  Good luck bone brother, hope it goes well for you."
ultimate,3dfnoc,frandler,2,Thu Jul 16 02:25:15 2015 UTC,"I had a jones fracture a couple years ago in June. I wore a boot (non weight bearing for most of it) for like 8 weeks and it showed good signs of healing. I played on it some around September/October for the series, but it was never fully pain-free during that season. Took more time off in the offseason and it hasn't bothered me since. I was like 27 at the time. It may not have been a complete fracture based on the x-rays. The doctor was pretty optimistic about it healing on its own.   If you want to come back quickly and you have good health insurance, get the surgery. Otherwise, it's a long recovery. This is the same thing that took out Kevin Durant for this whole NBA season, btw."

ultimate,3dg1s0,RobPG,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:04:45 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that Skyd is only set up to film on one field (the one with the stands for spectators).  Many of the games that are scheduled for that pitch are filmed; but there haven't been many US or Canadian teams who have played there yet. I'm rather happy that the coverage has included many other countries.  I like seeing photos from the watching parties in India and Japan as their teams are live-streamed.  I'm guessing that as there will be more showings by the US (and Canada) teams on that premier field this weekend, as I expect it will be used for some semi-final and the gold medal games."

ultimate,3d8ux9,Gingers_Unite,13,Tue Jul 14 12:51:52 2015 UTC,Maybe it was an adjustment of stride in order to get to his more dominant jumping leg?

Also I had one of the more experienced Ultimate players in my team come up to me and ask me what role I wanted to play as in competitive matches, as a handler or cutter. I chose handler and it was really nice to have the focus and direction early on as I had something to work towards.   I still remember the first few times I played as a handler, I had no clue what I was doing or where or how to cut and my throws were terrible. About a year down the line I've played handler for my team at Mixed Nationals,  and on the way we've become the best team in the province.   I play 3 times a week :D so try play as much as Ultimate as possible! Also something that helps, at your casual pickup games, focus on one aspect of your game that you'd like to improve (flicks, hucks, etc.)   Just my 2c."
