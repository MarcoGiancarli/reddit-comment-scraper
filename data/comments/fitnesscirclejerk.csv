fitnesscirclejerk,3e2vcd,brotz,9,Tue Jul 21 15:16:14 2015 UTC,"The results of my back X-ray (compared with one from five years ago) shows this:   There is stable mild to moderate L4-L5 and moderate-severe L5-S1 degenerative disc disease. There is stable minimal retrolisthesis grade 1 of L5 on S1, on a degenerative basis. There is mild right L4-L5 and bilateral L5-S1 degenerative facet joint disease. There is a broad rotary dextroconvex lumbar scoliosis and a normal lumbar lordosis.    I guess ""stable"" is a good thing.  This is especially good since I didn't start actually lifting (other than curlbro shit) until after my 2010 x-ray they're comparing with.  I was pretty confident it was piriformis syndrome, too...  He did say that my piriformis seems really tight, but maybe it's more of a symptom than a cause."
fitnesscirclejerk,3e2vcd,Heroine4Life,6,Tue Jul 21 15:19:03 2015 UTC,What does mean about recovery?
fitnesscirclejerk,3e2vcd,Strikerrjones,7,Tue Jul 21 16:06:58 2015 UTC,PT said that he thinks we can fix it with PT and if it isn't better in a month he'll send me back to the doctor.  Hopefully for steroids.
fitnesscirclejerk,3e2vcd,Strikerrjones,12,Tue Jul 21 16:08:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah. So, the important thing here (and you might already know this, but just in case you don't) is that just because it looks like a bomb went off in your spine on imaging, it doesn't mean you'll always be in pain and have disability. What you see on imaging does not correlate well with pain or disability. Your mindset going into this is much more important, which is actually a reason that x-rays can negatively impact patient outcomes. What the physical therapist does will not change how your spine looks on imaging (only surgery can do that), but your spine doesn't need to change to get results, as evidenced by surprisingly poor levels of recovery following surgery to fix stuff like this."
fitnesscirclejerk,3e2vcd,tubadeedoo,14,Tue Jul 21 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do understand that.  The funny thing is that I have a coworker who started having pretty much the same back pain as me a few years ago.  He went to PT because his doctor made him do it before trying surgery.  He didn't do any of the at-home stuff so it didn't help and then he got the surgery.  Then he did post-surgery PT and was feeling a bit better...  and didn't do any follow-up at home stuff and now he's pretty much where he started.    Around the time he started his adventures, I decided I was either going to start lifting for real or end up in a wheel chair... so I started deadlifting lightly and worked my way up from there and pretty much fixed all my problems by the time I was pulling 315x5."
fitnesscirclejerk,3e2vcd,UltraHumanite,14,Tue Jul 21 17:39:22 2015 UTC,"Deadlifts are love, deadlifts are life."
fitnesscirclejerk,3e2vcd,UltraHumanite,4,Tue Jul 21 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"Wow this, except I'm actually going to a place with a cycling team in the spring, so I probably won't be doing my Smolov for deadlift silliness."
fitnesscirclejerk,3e2vcd,LTUTD,7,Tue Jul 21 20:35:03 2015 UTC,"You won't get the good kind of steroids, prednisone is nice for getting the swelling out but you'll be fat and weak because of them.  Start learning more than your PT right now and you'll make it out just fine.  PT is good if you're getting things like massage, traction if it helps and the physical manipulation that frees up all the damage you've done.  PT sucks if it's ""oh do this exercise"" because chances are you're strong enough that their Total Gym is just going to make you wonder why you're giving them your co-pay.  I've been through both.  Got the good kind the first time, bad kind the second time."
fitnesscirclejerk,3e2vcd,Strikerrjones,4,Tue Jul 21 19:03:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my PT said he wants to do traction.  He also mentioned general core strengthening, which made me kind of wonder what he's thinking since I probably have an adequately strong core even with my mediocre lifting level... maybe I'm off here, though.  Also, I guess since I'm not lifting the inactivity could be screwing me up...  I'll just do what he says and go from there.      I'll be sure to mention I want the good steroids."
fitnesscirclejerk,3e2vcd,flannel_smoothie,6,Tue Jul 21 19:26:04 2015 UTC,"the core strengthening will be about useless if you're lifting at all, it's mostly geared toward 70 year old women.  The steroids you usually end up with are Glucocorticoid not Anabolic.  I don't think you'll be able to swing that in the name of bulging or herniated disks."
fitnesscirclejerk,3e2vcd,LTUTD,4,Tue Jul 21 19:38:02 2015 UTC,"Just tell then you need to add weight to any exercise they give you.  Planks r dumb, weighted planks r k."
fitnesscirclejerk,3e2vcd,BeastlyCaptWillard,2,Tue Jul 21 19:50:29 2015 UTC,"Eh... traction is only indicated in some back pain patients, and there's very little evidence that it helps at all in the lumbar spine. Not saying it won't help you, but yeah.  You can have strong as fuck abs and erector spinae, and an atrophied fatty-fibrous multifiduus. Some PTs give out stupid shitty exercises, but some of those exercises might actually be beneficial even if they don't feel hard. I'm not just saying this as something I learned in a classroom either, I'm saying it because after I learned it I tried it on myself (amongst other things) and now my low back is almost always pain free."

Lifting is an advantage though. People who are weak anyways regardless of how we perceive it. 99.9 percent of trainers at my gym can only squat in my gym could outlift me or those with an olympic bar with 2 flat benches.. fucken sucks.. i already got in a bitchy ass tone... was he being nice? lol are you talking about? I have seen someone outright refuse to squat and do legit barbell workout.. they like the workouts because they are stronger than hers.... Soft texture may be due to being a strong and actually pointing meaning to THEM 315 is not misdirected; it is I actually am very proud of them. I am saying there are trained women who CAN and many regular gym guys cannot outlift a female going heavy on the bench... I did yell at his face but he was using it for months. You may argue that humans are social creatures but what if I told him to work in so why should i have asked him nicely when he didn't have the social connections.

fitnesscirclejerk,3e01ql,LTUTD,4,Tue Jul 21 01:34:12 2015 UTC,"(sigh)  I just got back into the gym a month two months ago after 15+ months off for my degree, toyed with some dumbbells maybe every 3 weeks, had some form issues that I don't anymore, trying not to go overboard so I can learn my new job.  3x5's for Squat 210 Bench 170 DL 365 (1x5 obv, thus spake rippetoe, peace be upon him), Press 125, PC 180.  When I manage not to compare myself to publications and the internet, I actually feel pretty happy with that.  I get two days off each workweek and spend them eating and sleeping.  Overall work capacity is a harsh mistress."
fitnesscirclejerk,3e01ql,LTUTD,6,Tue Jul 21 01:38:53 2015 UTC,"Are you doing any accessories?  You could build up work capacity working variations on the main lifts.  Also, I need you to bench more.  For me."

fitnesscirclejerk,3e01ql,LTUTD,3,Tue Jul 21 01:52:55 2015 UTC,"Extra work is bench (gotta have chest bro), neck, and grip. I work some barbell rows in when I can, since stuck at low chinning strength and that seems to help.  Bench was the last to get form in line actually, just about a week ago. Now that you've informed me of my obligation in this regard I'll be redoubling bench efforts.  Wanted to get the press up, but that has shown itself to be a path of treachery and woe."
