That's the more ""hip"" area, but west little rock is by far the safest part of town and is where all of the growth is happening lately.   That house out on Cantrell is in a quickly growing but still kind of remote area that has a mix of really new stuff and really old stuff that used to be out in the country, so I'm guessing you are looking at an older house that someone is trying to do something with? I haven't looked at picture or anything. It still does seem kinda sketchy, though.   It might be worth a little time to look for more in the chenal / west little rock area.

The NLR high school campus is spread all over creation right now because they're doing a ton of construction trying to make a new campus.  There are ways to get around the construction if you're going to your house but it's kind of a pain.  The neighborhood itself is sort of working class, meaning like you're not going to get murdered in your bed but you also don't need to leave your expensive electronics sitting in your car or anything.

You can ask your landlord to light the alleyway.  Im guessing you are having a lot of trouble in the alley because its fairly dark back there.  If you ever do call the cops for a break in or something like that do your best to talk to the cops.  Find out their name and use their name in conversation with them.  Smile a lot and be friendly.  Tell them about the alley way attracting loiters and see if they would commit to stopping in the alley once a week or so just to make the people there a little uncomfortable.

Edit:  A lot of people aren't understanding what I meant.  Grabbing a can of wasp spray in self defense is totally legal.

But it is against the laws to plan to use it against a human, for any reason, and that's what is being advocated here.  In that situation your are choosing to replace a non-lethal pepper spray with a deadly poison.  That is against the law because you are trying to kill your attacker, when incapacitating him is an option.  It's illegal because it's premeditated."

LittleRock,3d917s,prodiver,2,Tue Jul 14 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"All legal mumbo-jumbo. It ultimately comes down to your defense and the judge. Most likely it would get thrown out anyways. Police often say to use your keys if you need protection. ""The former NYPD detective suggested keeping car keys on the night stand for easy access to an alarm."" He didn't buy the keys to fuck people up, but he left them by the bed stand just in case he needed to. Same thing with anything, including wasp spray.   Totally unrelated, but, you don't want wasp spray. Its not gonna that much damage and if you're kids are around it's probably more dangerous to them."

LittleRock,3ccgua,CosmicSlopShop,0,Mon Jul 20 11:03:43 2015 UTC,"I should edit and say that some of the stuff I listed is Vietnamese (like the pho), but I included them because they are somewhat similar and places like Mikes Place, Lillys and AW Lins are just ""Asian"" and offer food from different countries.  Some options in LR. Any time I go to another city, my first stop is always a Thai place, though.  Thai curry can be found at Bangkok Thai in the river market or at Chang Thai in Sherwood. Also Kbird in hillcrest. His Thai food is more ""legit"" and less ""Americanized"" so some people find it a little off-putting due to the unexpected/different flavors.  Probably can find it at Mikes Place (yes it is Thai, despite the name), too.  You can find Pad Thai at all of the above places, plus AW Lins in wlr, Lilly's Dim Sum, Saigon on hwy 10 (they may have closed?), and Mikes Place near UALR.  I actually like aw line pad Thai a lot. Lillys is really good, too. Not a fan of Bangkok Thai in this area. Chang Thai is the best, just a long drive.  You can get amazing pho at Pho Than Mi and Mikes Place. Pho Than Mi has the better pho, imo.   Bahn Mi sandwiches can be found at pho than mi and also at The Root (good sandwich but not a Thai restaurant).  Mikes place may have them, too."

Going down the hill on Napa Valley in west Little Rock, like by Asbury Methodist and the entrance to the St. Charles neighborhood, it's been a speed trap for years, so watch out there. I still ride the brakes when I drive down that hill.   I moved away more or less for good a few years ago and still make sure to go to Mt. Fuji for sushi every time I go back. People are going to tell you about Sushi Cafe and maybe one or two others. Sushi Cafe is good, don't get me wrong, and the atmosphere is more fun for 20- or 30-somethings, so I still like it there! But I have yet to find anything as good as the Dragon Roll at Mt. Fuji anywhere. And I guess it helps that I've been going there since I was a kid...nostalgia and all that."

LR is a decent sized city that isn't difficult to navigate and has enough activity to keep one entertained. It's hot/humid as fuck in the summers. Trips to lakes and rivers are decent weekend ideas. Lots of newer breweries are all around town. Lots of different dining options. You can't buy alcohol on Sundays at liquor stores/gas stations, but you can get growlers from several breweries. The city is ""dangerous"" but just stay north of 630 as the other guy said. Lock your cars and don't leave anything valuable visible, even in decent areas. If you like drinking, you have to experience Midtown Billiards at roughly 2am (Be a little drunk when you show up and then get a cheesburger and a beer. Soak in the vibe.

Local star parties may be one night affairs, but larger events can last up to a week or longer and attract hundreds or even thousands of participants. Many regional star parties are now held annually and are an important part of the hobby of amateur astronomy. Typically a dark sky site away from light pollution is chosen as a location. Participants bring telescopes and binoculars of all types and sizes and spend the nights observing astronomical objects such as planets, comets, stars, and deep sky objects together. Astrophotography and CCD imaging are also very popular. At larger star parties, lectures, swap meets, exhibitions of home-built telescopes, contests, tours, raffles, and other similar activities are common. Commercial vendors selling a variety of astronomical equipment may also be present. As with any other hobbyist gathering, there is much camaraderie and discussion of various aspects of the hobby at any star party.

I find all restaurants are child-friendly if your child is well-behaved :)  So unless you're referring specifically to restaurants where there is some manner of entertainment for kids, you've got a lot of options.   I don't have kids myself, but I've been out several times with friends with younger kids. We've been to The Pantry numerous times with a friend's kid (currently 8 months) ever since he was 6 weeks old. Granted, he usually either just sleeps or sits quietly and looks around."
LittleRock,39ecaa,behold_the_j,2,Thu Jun 11 12:46:47 2015 UTC,"I was going to suggest the Pantry as well, partially because it's generally a bit louder in there anyway thanks to lots of hard surfaces, so if your child starts to make some noise it won't be super bothersome. You can very easily step outside to the patio or even just 10 feet around the corner there is a lit area where other businesses are closed at dinner time if you need to calm a cryer.   I also think South on Main would be a pretty good place for a baby, since it's also kind of loud and is fun and fancy, but also kind of a bar/lounge/venue. Just make sure there is no music or you won't be having much conversation!"

From a personal honesty standpoint, I think part of the problem with the whole transplant lists thing is it lacks a lot in the way of personal stories. Having a transplant list makes the whole thing go quiet when what is needed is more sharing. Unless people are willing to put their stories out there so that people form a personal attachment, we just aren't going to  get more people donating. Not because people are mean, but because thinking about your own death is hard, so things very often get left in the hands of grieving relatives.   I say all this as someone who had a friend on a transplant list for several years without even knowing it. They didn't want to make a scene and kept it quiet because the list is going to take care of me. Only finally it got to a desperate point, and the list wasn't doing any good. Luckily when it got to that point, the husband started telling friends and family. We organized a big community program that got hundreds of people tested for the donor registry, and a donor was found for my friend. Today 11 people out of those tested that day have donated bone marrow, and none of them ever would have even known such a thing was possible without my friend's story being told."
LittleRock,38r9o3,Gertiel,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:00:29 2015 UTC,"I can agree with you on that. It took me a year to get on the list and they still told me it could be up to 7 years with my blood type. And as some of my friends have wanted to donate, I've never asked anyone for a kidney. I don't feel right asking someone for a piece of their body and to go through surgery for me. It's one of those things most people are terrified of. Makes the list one of those only hopes for me. I've done small things like post on /r/kidney_match and willingly given all my info to anyone who asked but I've never actually asked anyone if they would give me one"

There's a mountain to climb in the city (sort of) lots of parks (dog parks too) and so much hiking it's a little ridiculous.   Check out the AR State Parks website for locations and info. Hot Springs National Park has a wealth of nature and shit. There are 4 or 5 ""diamond"" lakes in the state. This is the highest rating for water clarity and quality that is given to a body of water.   Get out there and explore! There are literally thousands of people that explore the state everyday.   I'm heading to Greers Ferry this weekend for cliff jumping and general lakey goodness. And probably a horrible sun burn."

LittleRock,38o5xd,Freudianslipnslides,3,Thu Jun 11 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is tons of outdoor opportunities in Arkansas, mostly in the central and western half of the state.  The Ouachita National Forest is about 40 min west of LR.  Tons of hiking, camping, backpacking available out there.  The Ouachita Trail starts in OK and runs through half of AR (192 miles long) and is perfect for what you want to do.  There are tons of state parks, national & state forests spread throughout the state.  I think you would be hard pressed NOT to find someplace to go.    Summer is a pretty brutal time to be outdoors (especially August) with typically high heat & humidity.  If you're not from the south, it could take a little getting used to.  But fall is really really nice and temperatures are moderate until November/December."

LittleRock,38lebh,CaptainShaboigen,2,Fri Jun 5 01:05:47 2015 UTC,I don't have a degree yet.  So far I've worked warehouse/supply related positions except for a few years working down at the Pine Bluff arsenal.  Since I don't have a degree in any field it's hard to find a good opportunity.  I was wondering if there was somewhere I could go for help.
LittleRock,38lebh,alicethemalice,2,Fri Jun 5 01:31:23 2015 UTC,"Try again with the staffing agencies. My background is in staffing and my past four jobs were all obtained through agencies. They tend to get a bad rep, but I have placed guys into manufacturing positions who have gone perm with the same company years later.   When you're dealing with anything that deals with volume, it's important to realize that appearances and first impressions matter A LOT.   Try any and all staffing agencies and beyond that. The wider you cast your net, the greater chances are that you catch something.   Not all staffing agencies are all about just trying to fill a job. We really want to find great candidates and place them in a position forever. Trust me, less work in the long run for us. Clients will also hire the best of the bunch when they can. People sometimes get frustrated when they're temp for four months and are still not hired full time. Chill out, you're still getting paid.  Patience and hard work pays off. Attitudes matter when you're a temp.   Write a nice cover letter. Update your resume. Have several versions. Use the same verbiage from the job description. Be prepared. Be presentable. Be thorough. Don't blow off the application, especially when it pertains to dates of employment and specifically your job duties. Keyword searches for openings are common practice and if all you put is shipping and handling when you've also driven a forklift, you'll be passed over for someone who used more keywords than you.  Practice interviewing. Ask questions. Don't give up and don't take rejection personally. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.   Never forget that finding a job is a job. Happy hunting!"

They're more geared towards filling their business clients need for workers rather than looking for genuinely good opportunities for the people who go to them, which is why they're mainly for unemployed people.  I was wondering if there existed a place I could hire that would help look for the best position available."

You have to provide your own wireless router with Comcast. ATT's modem is also a wireless router.

As the other comments below should show, a gigantic factor in your experience with either will be dependent on how well maintained their infrastructure is in your particular neighborhood.  I've seen AT&T connections that performed like shit because their wires in the area were old and not upkept at all.

Along Asher Ave., the further from Fair Park/University you get, the faster you get into the shit.  If one considers the intersection of Markham and University to be the geographic center of Little Rock, MOST people will not suggest Southwest (south of 630, east of 430) or East (east of I-30, the further from the river, the worse). Downtown isn't too bad nowadays, you just need to know that it's actually mostly north of 630. Downtown (or at least the parts you're interested in) only lasts a few more blocks south of 630."

The pharmacist in Perryville who was arrested back in January or February actually instructed undercover DEA agents on how to forge prescriptions for controlled substances. He would stay after hours in his privately owned pharmacy and write up fake prescriptions, bill them to Medicare on random patients, then sell the tablets on the street, thus getting paid twice for them. It'd be smart if it weren't so stupid, so to speak.   I recognized a few names on the US Attorney's list of indictments. Can't say I'm too surprised at some of them. I have to agree with you, I make good money (not $150k good, but I'm more than comfortable), and I can't imagine jeopardizing my steady salary for a few bucks on the side. It took seven years of college for me to get my doctorate, and it'd be unthinkably foolish to throw it all away.   I hope these guys get what's coming to them.

I have gone to the same doctor for over twenty five years and have never had an issue being treated for any issue thankfully, but am always reluctant to ask for help in pain management. This is why.

LittleRock,36fnal,Blazedazex55,6,Tue May 19 00:39:41 2015 UTC,"I hate to be a naysayer to the Flying Saucer, but I've really stopped going there in the last couple years. It used to be a great spot before Little Rock had a plethora of other good options. Now it seems pretty weak. They always seem to be out of at least half the beers on their menu, their pint night has some decent deals but draws such a big crowd it can get fairly obnoxious pretty quick.  If you're in NLR I'd recommend checking out Diamond Bear's patio. The weather is awesome, they've got a handful of solid beers and usually at least one good drink special going.  Some hummus and pita and maybe some fried cheese curds with a double IPA is hard to beat :)  Lost Forty's tap room is right off the I-30/I-630 exit so is likely on your way if you're coming from downtown LR to NLR. The noise level gets a little obnoxious because it's usually pretty packed and is basically a big warehouse with terrible acoustics haha (I know, I know, damn kids need to keep it down and stay off my lawn). They have some decent beers and great food as well."

LittleRock,35y7fu,tight_dick_playa,4,Thu May 14 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on which Landers. The one in Benton is my go to dealership. I've heard nightmares about the one in Little Rock, which is the one I assume you were looking at. Take any price quote you get from the one in Little Rock and the one in Benton will match it or do better."
LittleRock,35y7fu,Thenotsodarkknight,2,Thu May 14 15:29:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, forgot about the benton landers. But you're right, i was referring to the one by Rave theater."
LittleRock,35y7fu,behold_the_j,3,Thu May 14 15:37:54 2015 UTC,"I bought a new car from Landers in Benton a couple years ago. I'd say overall it was a good experience. Salesman wasn't overly pushy, didn't seem to be wheeling and dealing too hard on the price, etc.  My only word of caution is that if you finance, set that up beforehand with your bank or preferred lender. I went in with the intention of putting about 50% down and financing the other half. Their finance guy was trying to talk me into a 10 year loan with only putting about 5% down because ""Why put all that extra down, man?"" Uhhhhhhh because I don't want my car payment to be through the roof and pay double in interest? I put the 50% down.  He seemed very shady. But I guess that's his job. There's likely the same guy at any dealership."
LittleRock,35y7fu,dasnoob,3,Thu May 14 18:13:26 2015 UTC,"Neighbor told me a great story about a friend of his. Steve Landers sideswiped her car and totalled it out. He gave her his card and told her to call him and he would make it right.  So she calls him a bit later and he asks here ""What kind of payment can you afford?""  lol"
LittleRock,35y7fu,HappyTheHobo,2,Sun May 17 04:21:36 2015 UTC,Thats actually pretty funny in a fucked up sorta way.
LittleRock,35y7fu,Rachelle1016,2,Sun May 17 17:08:21 2015 UTC,If you're buying used the Landers pre-owned in Little Rock likes to tell you that the dealer for that maker will fix anything under warranty. Then after you've bought it you find out that isn't true. In reality if something would be covered under warranty the company selling the car will take it right down to the dealer to have it fixed. As far as new dealers go just shop around and play them against each other. Have fun and ER everything in writing.
LittleRock,35y7fu,Glass-of-Water,2,Thu May 14 16:44:08 2015 UTC,Just don't go to Crain! Haven't heard anything negative about Landers.
LittleRock,35y7fu,Rachelle1016,2,Thu May 14 17:22:59 2015 UTC,"I went to Crain Ford in Jacksonville with a goal in mind of what I wanted and what I expected for a deal, but purely with the intent of just looking.  After talking with the salesman, we worked out a really good deal (but I wish they had thrown in some more service things for free).  The only bad part I've ever encountered is taking the car in for service and recalls.  They.. Seem to not like you in the service department."
LittleRock,35y7fu,Glass-of-Water,2,Fri May 15 02:58:27 2015 UTC,That's exactly the issue I had.
LittleRock,35y7fu,Freudianslipnslides,2,Fri May 15 03:04:14 2015 UTC,"Then again, I went to Landers Toyota during my trials of finding a replacement car, after previously owning a corolla, and they seemed different that time.  They gave me really bad deals that I wouldn't take in a million years."
LittleRock,35y7fu,DearBurt,3,Fri May 15 03:14:34 2015 UTC,"I went to Landers Toyota on Colonel Glenn. I traded a 96 Ford Ranger with over 200k for an 07 FJ Cruiser.  They gave me a good price on the trade (the Ranger was beat to shit) and paid my sales tax on the FJ.   6 months later I decided I wanted a 4x4 FJ. The only one they had in my price range was IMMACULATE. All package upgrades and less than 60k.   Again they gave me an awesome price on the FJ trade in and paid my sales tax again.   If you treat them like people, they're pretty nice. A lot of people are on the defensive when buying a car, but the guys at Landers are really good at getting you what you want."

LittleRock,35mxxs,lifelite,2,Mon May 11 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"I work in the area (near W. Pershing and Pike) and those are your two options; Comcast and AT&T Uverse. What you get will depend on precisely where you live. I kid you not, my dad's work was a quarter mile from me and he could get actual fast Uverse when all we could get was slow DSL billed as Uverse. Over the years our Comcast throughput has wavered. First it sucked, then they ran new lines, then it slowly started going down hill, especially during wet weather. A guy that works for me used to do installs for Comcast and he said NLR had generally the worst lines he's worked on in central AR.  We did upgrade our Comcast service (business plan) and they've actually delivered advertised speeds. So maybe read the fine print and see what sort of exit options you have if Comcast doesn't deliver?"
LittleRock,35mxxs,jersully,2,Tue May 12 04:21:18 2015 UTC,I came here to make a post about this exact question!  So I know Comcast has a reputation for bad customer service but...has anyone actually had a problem with their service in NLR? I'm going to be moving right on the river getting only internet (no bundle) and comcast is waaaay cheaper for (theoretically) faster internet.   Has anyone had slower than advertized speeds or connection issues with comcast?
LittleRock,35mxxs,DeathToTheKings,2,Tue May 12 16:31:17 2015 UTC,"I've not had any issues with outages or slower-than-advertised speeds with Comcast.  I have had multiple billing issues. Their customer service is non-existent and super shady. They'll hit me with a $15 charge out of nowhere for a service I never requested and don't actually have (like one month I had a charge for HBO... I never requested HBO, I didn't have HBO). I tried calling literally once a day for two weeks before they resolved it.  I've found the best way to deal with it is via their online Help Chat. On the phone, everyone is pretty useless, and the few times I've actually been connected to a CSR who seemed to actually be fixing my problem, the line would mysteriously go dead and it would be picked up by someone in a different call center who couldn't do anything for me. It's like they were actively encouraging their people not to help you so you'd just get frustrated and eat the cost of the relatively small charge rather than deal with them.  With the online chat, there's a bit of a language barrier usually since (I assume) they likely outsource that kind of work to India/Dubai. The good part is that you don't have to fool with recording the phone call because you can just print out a transcript of the entire conversation."
LittleRock,35mxxs,behold_the_j,1 point,Thu May 14 18:18:56 2015 UTC,Hmm. So...would you actually recommend them then? Has it been worth it?  Currently they are quoting me $30/mo 25mb internet VS AT&T which is $52/mo for 18mb.  The choice there is obvious...but is it worth potential hassle?
LittleRock,35mxxs,DeathToTheKings,1 point,Thu May 14 22:55:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly if there was any better option I would drop them in a heartbeat... but there's not. So while I wouldn't do anyone the disservice of ""recommending"" Comcast, I will just say that they are the fastest option in this area.   I had ATT Uverse when I first moved to Little Rock, and while their prices are worse and their customer service is also pretty bad, I never had any random problems with my bill like I do with Comcast.  Both are bad. Might as well go with the best price/speed option you're looking for."
LittleRock,35mxxs,behold_the_j,2,Thu May 14 23:12:42 2015 UTC,"Not really much here, Comcast had a ton of non-compete agreements that prevented competition for a long time, gladly that's coming to an end this year and will open the door to better companies and competition.  Comcast was great for me personally up until 2014, we now have regular issues, service will randomly die on a sunny day for a few hours a few times a month, speeds usually are below what's advertised during the day, customer service is horrible (perfect example here), especially when they base their pay off keeping the customers with Comcast (for reps if 1/4th of your callers who wanted to cancel originally actually do after they speak to you you lose your paycheck), and they are way overpriced compared to companies around the world offering the same or even better service or in other parts of the country.  We've had so many issues with them over the last year and a half that we can't wait until there is a better alternative here, hopefully that day is soon."
LittleRock,35mxxs,TibitXimer,1 point,Wed May 13 21:12:21 2015 UTC,Where exactly in NLR do you live? I'm hearing such mixed things about NLR service it seems like it just depends on the area.
LittleRock,35mxxs,DeathToTheKings,1 point,Thu May 14 14:31:56 2015 UTC,I am with U verse in NLR and I get 22 nearly 23mbps.  Nothing is going to be cheap though.
LittleRock,35mxxs,guess_twat,1 point,Tue May 12 01:54:18 2015 UTC,"If you only want an ISP, comcast is going to be able to offer better speeds.  (50 mbps+)  Their cable had a fuzzy picture quality to it compared to uverse, which I why I'm still with them."
LittleRock,35mxxs,b-nut,1 point,Tue May 12 02:06:32 2015 UTC,Comcast has horrible customer service (as I'm sure everyone has known) but the internet my friend has is 15x faster than my uverse. Seriously at best I've gotten 1.3 MbPS download speeds and when I'm at his house it's around 35MbPS.
LittleRock,35mxxs,stolenlogic,1 point,Tue May 12 04:47:59 2015 UTC,"We're in Indian Hill in NLR on Comcast.  Paying for 50mbps service, currently testing at 60.12Mbps down, 12.30Mbps up.  I haven't noticed any appreciable slowdowns in service during peak times, nor have we had any problem with outages."

If you haven't played in the league before, you'd probably be better off getting a team together for the fall league. Just a thought. It's a ton of fun though. Definitely worth doing."
LittleRock,35bnmb,Daimakaicho,3,Fri May 8 20:28:13 2015 UTC,Thanks. I thought it was rec league this summer as well.
LittleRock,35bnmb,SoloSkeptik,2,Fri May 8 20:30:17 2015 UTC,It is. It's specifically the summer survivor series that is going to be extremely competitive.

LittleRock,358van,OwenLR,1 point,Fri May 8 02:01:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's a shitty idea in general to allow a for profit company first dibs on goodwill clothing that they will turn around and make more money on.  It would be one thing if this company was going around to each goodwill and shopping but they literally have office space in the goodwill headquarters and can pull any items they want first.  $30 a month for 2 articles of clothing when it most likely cost less than $8 is a complete ripoff, especially when you take in to consideration that you're getting used clothing."
LittleRock,358van,nevercriesalone45,3,Tue May 12 12:41:28 2015 UTC,"Tagless doesn't get first dibs. They pull from clothing that was not able to be sold in stores. Considering that the clothes that are picked are cleaned and updated to look brand new, and that a stylist specifically picks them out for you before sending them to your door, I think it's a pretty good deal. Where are you getting your information from?"
LittleRock,358van,hudsonfoo,1 point,Tue May 12 21:39:27 2015 UTC,"Can you go in to detail about where you get your clothes from?  Are you talking about getting clothes from retail outlets that didn't sell (like how stein mart does it) or are you talking about getting clothes from goodwill or other 2nd hand stores.  I based my opinion above on the assumption that you were getting your clothes from goodwill, if I'm wrong then I apologize and can actually see this being a decent service!"
LittleRock,358van,nevercriesalone45,2,Wed May 13 16:25:13 2015 UTC,"The clothes are 100% sourced from Goodwill. If an article of clothing doesn't sell in Goodwill stores, it goes to the distribution center. The distribution center is where Tagless is located as you mention in your post and that's where the clothes are processed. Goodwill in-store customers get first dibs on clothing before it ever makes its way into Tagless. That being said, there are lots of really fantastic clothes that fall through the cracks and they end up with a quality product and high-end clothes that were simply overlooked while in stores."

I was on sprint towers for years through ting before RW and never had issues either. I've sometimes encountered voice problems when using free public WiFi, but it's no big deal to just switch to cell and continue on with my conversation. I purchased the most recent moto x and like it, but kind of wish I had just gotten the cheaper version, I don't really use the new features and the battery life is okay at best."
LittleRock,346at3,ppoppers,2,Tue Apr 28 19:34:30 2015 UTC,"I have been using RW for over a year now. My biggest complaint is defiantly the poor coverage. But I live in Saline County so if you live in LR it will likely be better. But still, it is worth pulling up the Sprint coverage map and seeing how little coverage they have in the state. On the plus side, RW roams Verizon which does help in the coverage respect.  My other complaint would be that RW, while better, is still buggy at times. It is probably closer to a beta service than they care to admit. It is just the little things like sometimes my phone will not ring or sending a picture message will make the messenger app crash. Other times though everything works great. It is just something to be aware of. Other than those drawbacks, I am pretty happy with RW. I like the company and feel like they are one of the few companies who are actually doing something innovative in the wireless industry--have you noticed how eerily similar Google's new Project Fi is to what RW has been doing for a few years now? Which leads me to last thing I would keep in mind before jumping on board with RW, things are about to change. RW has a lot of new projects coming up in Labs that should be coming sometime this year, new pricing scheme (it remains to be seen if it is better or worse than the current plans), a new network (probably T-Mobile), and a new phone. It might be worth waiting and seeing how all this pans out before committing to RW.  In summery, RW is great if a) you want the lowest prices b) like trying new technology, even if it is a bit buggy. Cricket is better if you really want good prices, good coverage, and reliable service."

As far as living close to school, there a few decent places downtown with either parking garages or gated parking lots, but I wouldn't recommend walking to the school, mainly at night.  The school itself is fine, but the end of the street you turn on has a gas station that seems to attract a lot of transients.  I go down there for smokes during the day, but I prefer not to in all honesty.  I've got a buddy that bikes to school from nearby on occasion though and I don't think he's had any trouble.  Edit: crime is not as bad as some people make it out to be, like any other semi large city, avoid certain areas and you're plenty safe. As far as traffic, it can be annoying but it isn't too bad if there is not a wreck or something, I can get from my place in Roland(way out west) to school in 35 minutes or so, so anywhere in town doesn't take too long.

During my time in Oxford, I had a small bachelor pad for $440/mo, but there were places that were something like $350/rm if you have or want roommates. Right now, my GF and I are renting in WLR for $700/mo.  As far as traffic, it depends. I don't take University, but there's no way it's gridlocked. Some of the nearby interstates get clogged with morning commuters, but if you're living near the campus, you won't have to deal with that. You should know that Ole Miss doesn't have a parking garage, and parking has come up as an issue year after year. But law students have their own lot, IIRC.

LittleRock,343soi,ShutterWriter,3,Tue Apr 28 20:57:48 2015 UTC,"I've only been to Oxford one time, and the school was really nice. It was a beautiful campus. I don't know much about either law school, so can't help you at all there. And I don't know a lot about the schools in general, but its my impression that Ole Miss will give you the traditional collegiate experience. Bigger nicer campus more students, more active campus life, less people leaving the campus every weekend. However, since you are going to grad school, and not undergrad, I think this will matter a lot less to you. What I think will matter more will be the city, and I think Little Rock wins hands down over Oxford. There are some bad parts of town no doubt (and the UALR campus is sort of in the bad part.) but there are great parts to the city too.   West Little Rock is generally considered to be nicer and safer, but its also a lot further from nightlife and school. If you are looking for nice safe apartments close to the school this is your best bet. http://www.theparkavenuelofts.com/  There are in a shopping center with a target, la fitness, panera, etc. I have a friend that lives there and a 1 bed room costs about $1,000 a month. Does not have gated parking but it is well lit and active and he has never had any problems. There is a pool, but I'm not sure what other amenities it has. Not within walking distance to night life, but a short drive will get you there in 5 mins.   Congrats on the full ride. Just a little more advice, take a real close look at how successful the universities are at getting their graduating students employment post graduation. It is tougher and tougher out there to find jobs for recent law school graduates. If you got a full ride, I'm guessing you will be a top student at law school and that should help you find a job, but if Oxford is going to be better about getting you a job after you graduate might be worth it to take loans and go to school there. If all you care about is the city, LR > OX  edit: just realized the law school is not on the same campus as the undergrad school.

Riverdale is a great area to look into, there are 4 or 5 apartment complexes in the area and as others have said there are lots of great lofts downtown.  I have had several friends live in the rock Street lofts and they all love it.  West little Rock is nice but a good drive.     All in all LR is as safe as many other cities as long as you are aware of your surroundings and aren't dealing in illegal activities."

LittleRock,33s70f,dmv1975,6,Sat Apr 25 02:48:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your talking about ""markham man"", brown hair always caked in dirt and limping somewhere perpetually.  I also saw him again for the first time in a while downtown, yesterday. I heard a rumor that his family is super wealthy, but he just he's just psychologically incompetent and prefers the streets. Maybe someone else can provide actual details"
LittleRock,33s70f,CosmicSlopShop,7,Sat Apr 25 03:46:30 2015 UTC,"""Markham man"" is named Carl, and he's the brother of a family friend.  He does have psychological problems and prefers the streets.  His family is not super wealthy.  They are well off enough to help him, but he doesn't want help.  His brother gave him a mobile home to live in, but he walked out of it back to the streets after a few days.  He's been in a state-run nursing home for a while, which is why no one has seen him.  He got severe frostbite on his foot and was unable to walk.  He's actually gotten frostbite a number of times, which is why he walks with a limp.  When it's really cold he urinates on himself at night because it's warm (remember, he has mental problems), and it freezes and causes frostbite on his legs and feet.  If you see him feel free to give him a little cash.  He doesn't drink or do drugs like a lot of homeless people, and he really does spend the money on food.  He often goes hungry because he doesn't fit in well at the homeless shelters/soup kitchens and rarely goes to them.  His brother gives him food and money when he can find him, but sometimes he just doesn't know where Carl is."

LittleRock,33s70f,prodiver,2,Sat Apr 25 20:38:08 2015 UTC,"Cantrell Carl is not the same person. He walked his bike (was never seen riding it) up and down Cantrell in the '80s/'90s, often stopping in the McDonald's by Foxcroft. And, yes, he passed away years ago.  Also, I believe that the homeless man OP is asking about -- aka Dirt, aka Walking Man -- is actually named Keith. His father was Bud Campbell, the ""Voice of the Arkansas Razorbacks"" before Paul Eels."

His story is also that his family is wealthy and he's just incompetent and prefers the streets"
LittleRock,33s70f,CaptainPeppers,2,Sat Apr 25 19:24:51 2015 UTC,"It's been quite a while but there was a thread about him here. If I'm recalling it correctly, he's actually the son of a rather well-known local radio host or something like that. Apparently at a relatively early age this guy chose to live as a vagrant, which is why he's been at it for so incredibly long. He doesn't like it when he's recognized, though, or so this article said."

LittleRock,32ow3w,Barack-OJimmy,2,Wed Apr 15 15:05:51 2015 UTC,"Seems like some sort of epidemic is going on among LR, NLR, and PCSSD."

They can't which is explains the ever-increasing ""white flight"" to the suburbs and private schools.  BTW, when you click 'Take Action', you get this:   404 - Page Not Found Sorry, the page you are looking for does not exist"
LittleRock,32n2f5,tacfan,5,Wed Apr 15 02:36:49 2015 UTC,"While I'm glad that this is getting attention, and all of these mentions of Smalley will hopefully show up on google searches until the end of time to let people know what a POS he is, from a legal perspective I doubt any of these robbery charges will stick. I mean that's why someone would kill a witness in the first place right?  While TC's murder may be unsolved I will say that this guy is the only person who would have any motive at all, and also the only person who had said that he would kill TC. While that may not be hard evidence of murder, it is at the least evidence that this guy is a fucking asshole for threatening and extorting a sweet gentle autistic man who never hurt anyone.  I also don't think the other Wright Avenue robbery and assault (http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/apr/06/2-released-hospital-after-sunday-shooting/) charges will stick, the guy who was shot likely won't testify and the police released Smalley without physically recovering a weapon as I understand it. Interesting note, the place where this shooting occurred is less than a half mile from where TC's body was found.  Furthermore I hear Smalley was recently also involved in a shootout with his neighbor recently, again I bet the neighbor doesn't testify.   Maybe they will get him on the driving on suspended license and turn signal though, he should do all of three months probation for that."

I live in Hillcrest and it is a very open community, but it tends to trend more towards families. I concur with others about that near the rivermarket has a growing group of young professionals. Particularly in the loft buildings.   There's a newer development called Park Avenue Lofts that is centrally located on University.

If you're working in Maumelle, traffic shouldn't be too big of an issue.

It probably has the best view of downtown south of the river, short of Capitol View, and has some nice wooded areas as well.   Emerald Park (past the ""don't go past this sign"" signs) is great, but don't get too close...the rock is NOT stable.   Another favorite of mine is Fort Roots, but I've only ever been up there on a bike. There may be another way in, but there are gates sometimes. On the south side there is a trail and an occasional bench with amazing views of downtown.  Lastly, North Allsopp Park is rarely visited by anybody for some reason.

My personal pet peeve is the asshats that go all the way to the end of 430N in the far left lane and expect to be let in (unless you get the pleasure of it being some idiot in a giant lifted truck in which case they will make it so your options are let them in or wreck). If they'd just merge to the middle back where the traffic is still moving smoothly, there wouldn't be a problem. I know there's going to be some bottle neck because the ramp to 40W is only 1 lane for now, but these selfish pricks just make it worse because the WHOLE LINE has to stop whenever they shove their way in. I've let them get all the way to the end and nearly wreck before. I don't let them in. Been yelled at and had shit thrown at me but I refuse to reward them for being complete morons and completely disregarding traffic rules and etiquette just to save a few seconds on their commute."
LittleRock,313tvl,barktothefuture,3,Wed Apr 1 21:50:48 2015 UTC,this is a totally different scenario than 430N. On 430N both lanes should be used all the way until the lanes combine.  Early merging is bad.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLVMW8KnfBE
LittleRock,313tvl,Malystryxx,1 point,Thu Apr 2 05:39:47 2015 UTC,"I was referring to before the construction started. Before all of that, the left lane still had to merge to the middle. The zipper method works great if traffic isn't at a stand still. The video you linked states that it's safer to merge when everyone is going close to the same speeds. I had the exact same point in my original post; merge as early as possible once you've been instructed to, which is where (usually) the traffic is still moving, if only at a greatly reduced speed. If everyone started trying to merge at the first opportunity a little after the bridge ended, it would be fine, since that's around where you're first instructed to start trying to merge. Which follows the zipper method as it was explained in the video. Whenever I've observed most people doing it that way, everything seems to go smoothly and time sitting still is minimal.  The problem is when traffic is stopped (which it often is, including before the construction started). In this case, you have your typical jackass that goes flying down the empty lane without ever attempting to merge, or someone that's already merged but decides they want to force their way up the line so they hop over and floor it and then force their way back in at the end.  If they have their turn signal on and are clearly trying to get in, but don't find an opening until close to the end of the lane, that's one thing, and I'll let them in every time. But if you just wait until the last possible second, you're doing it wrong."
LittleRock,313tvl,spongebob_meth,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:17:44 2015 UTC,no. waiting until the last possible second is the way it is supposed to be done. All the people backing up traffic in the middle lane have merged too early and should be equally split between the middle lane and the left lane.

LittleRock,30sqly,Random_Heero,2,Mon Mar 30 12:17:16 2015 UTC,Eh they are medium size I guess. The Mexican grocery has fresh pastries and the place always smells awesome it also has a restaurant and a deli in it.

Both Sam's and Mr Chen's have undegone renovations recently so they are better than before. Sam's only take cash and check but Mr Chen on the other hand accepts all major credit cards except American Express."

LittleRock,30pvpg,cwm9805,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:11:09 2015 UTC,Thanks anyway. I figured it was a long shot.

I know there's an ATV park out just north of the airport in LR - I've never noticed rental signs, but if you're around it might be worth checking out."
