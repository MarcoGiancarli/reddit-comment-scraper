shadowofmordor,3e5aq1,Something_Syck,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:51:15 2015 UTC,So this is the last view of DÃ»sh the Massive before I blew up his head...
shadowofmordor,3e4yzz,ThatOneChappy,6,Wed Jul 22 00:14:37 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: Loved the game overall and the reason why I'm listing these points below isn't to just trash the game but to highlight areas that could make SoM into some sort of God among games. I particularly liked the flow of combat, the visuals, the performance, the personality given to captains and warchiefs, and parts of the nemesis system. Might get flamed hard but this is my honest impression.  Story: was pretty bad. It was hilarious seeing a dev compare SoM with Bioshock, and saying they drew inspiration from Ken Levine and tried to work it into the game. Bioshock is full of story and choice and dilemmas - SoM, not so much.  Nemesis System: Would have been nice to have more incentive to be selective about which uruks you guide up the ranks to eventually brand as part of your amazing epic orc army (which turns out to be 5 warchiefs and a few followers). Maybe if the system was a bit more 'organic' rather than making the player the center of the universe by having things happen like a challenge against your branded warchiefs. You should need to increase a captains power as much as possible and make sure you select one with good resistances and strengths so it can survive challenges.  Difficulty: The game was pretty easy, but more importantly there were not that many ways to meaningfully customise the difficulty. The abilities you get mid-late game are way too OP and there should be some more restrictions on using them to make it feel like you are facing an army of orcs that vastly outnumber you rather than a bunch of meat-sacks that are yours for the exploding. Removing on screen prompts is a good start, but would have been nice to have some levels of difficulty and a 'hardcore option' (maybe disables some OP abilities, removes attribute increases, etc).  Technical options:  A FOV slider would have been nice. Had to use Flawless Widescreen so that the camera wasn't up Tallions bum the whole time. Once I applied the fix the game felt much better, environment was able to be appreciated, combat was more fun because you could see more etc.  Repetition:  Some aspects of the game get pretty repetitive. Artifacts dont really serve much purpose (I suspect the devs thought they were being all Bioshocky by trying to tell stories with them but in my view didn't really do much with them).  DLC: Was excited to start the DLC but didn't really feel like the bright lord or Lord of the Hunt changed things up a great deal, or introduced any features that were radically new. Also, all the little pieces of DLC that you get with the Season Pass just end up giving you high powered runes at the start of the game which I had to just not equip (at the least would have liked to 'sell' or remove them from my inventory).   Edited for grammar."
shadowofmordor,3e4yzz,SymmetryDearSteinman,2,Wed Jul 22 06:01:01 2015 UTC,"TLDR - but i did read the difficulty bit.  IMO - it was difficult until you started paying attention and playing it properly - i played with no runes or levels up (voluntary ones) and go heaps far before it just got too time consuming to have massive fights and have to dodge, block, counter etc etc.. If you followed the prompts or just payed attention to the uruks around you - it wasnt very hard.  Great game though... and, im going to read your whole comment now."
shadowofmordor,3e4yzz,drunodrundridge,2,Wed Jul 22 06:09:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything you just said but one point that stood out was about them giving you all the epic runes. What the fuck was up with that? I got the game of the year addition so I got them as soon as I started the game but I never used them because it felt like cheating, and what's more is I could never get rid of them! So they just sat there and I could never tell at a quick glance what epic runes I had aquired. Such a stupid feature."
shadowofmordor,3e4yzz,Jutzking,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:30:10 2015 UTC,Yeah its frustrating. Seems that a lot of games suffer from this too. You buy a GOTY version or season pass and when you start a game you suddenly have all these items or buffs that seem way out of place for how experienced your character is.

shadowofmordor,3e4yzz,Purdaddy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:56:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I found that they were pretty  difficult to control effectively to be any better than me in open gameplay.  I tended to brand them and then hop off and fight along side

shadowofmordor,3e4yzz,Kattpuzn,0,Wed Jul 22 08:39:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of  a good story in games, but I only bought this game because the Nemesis system and stealth gameplay appealed to me. I know jack shit about LotR lore and partly because of that, I didn't care one bit about the story. If the story had been better, I might have gotten interested in the background lore. Torvin and Ratbag were characters that I liked, but they didn't get that much screentime. Despite not liking the story, I still had lots of fun with the gameplay, which was the reason I got the game in the first place."
shadowofmordor,3e3vi0,scimscam,6,Tue Jul 21 19:25:38 2015 UTC,"Something I like abut this game is that you can still carry out a stealth kill just after you've been spotted.  Hell I have even run up and stealthed killed 3 orcs in the same group.  I don't know if it is intentional, but it does make sense. If someone ran up and slit my friends throat and then I turned to attack them he could have a knife in my face before I could draw a weapon even though I know he is there."
shadowofmordor,3e3vi0,Spacedementia87,2,Tue Jul 21 22:28:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a really cool touch to the game, stealth really uses the element of surprise well :)"

shadowofmordor,3dj9qn,Mithridates12,2,Thu Jul 16 18:46:22 2015 UTC,"The enemy types are extremely similar to AC - mostly typical grunts, but also ranged units and some with shields, etc that require certain combos to defeat so it takes a lot more than just ""left click to win"". Plus the animals provide a very different type of battle.  I would say the combat in SoM is a lot better than AC because you have more options and more variety between ranged, stun, leaps, grabs, shanks, and special moves you have to chain hits to 'charge' before you can use.  If you're worried about the game being too easy, just don't buy any health upgrades and not more than one arrow ammo upgrade. That way you'll be much more susceptible to being killed and will have to work harder and plan ahead to stay alive.  And that's not counting the Nemesis enemies who all have specific strengths and weaknesses making each battle require a different strategy. For extra challenge you can go out of your way to exploit someone's fear of animals, burning, etc just to rub it in before they die, and the game rewards you for doing so."
shadowofmordor,3dj9qn,niceville,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:17:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks, sounds good so far. Are there any decent mods for the game? I think (even though I haven't played it) you could do a lot with this type of game....new enemies, new characters (you can only play this one guy, you can't choose, right?), weapons etc. - that is, if they allow it, many studios prefer to sell this stuff as DLC. So what's the situation regarding mods?"
shadowofmordor,3dj9qn,SymmetryDearSteinman,2,Thu Jul 16 21:26:46 2015 UTC,"I recently finished story mode with all of the abilities unlocked. I'm planning on starting a new game and not selecting many upgrades or abilities because, yes, the combat gets too easy mid-late game. I think its still worth unlocking everything to see how everything works when playing for the first time because then you understand how challenging it will be to cripple your character for a second playthrough. And plus, some of the abilities are just plain fun to abuse.  Comprehensive modding is not yet possible because the game is very locked down and no tools have been provided. There is a tool to extract the game files, and some people have had ago at this (eg here and here). But I dont think anyone has released any mods yet, and its unlikely we will see any comprehensive mods without official support.   It is possible to change the FOV (which I was very pleased to hear about) by using either Cheat Engine or Flawless Widescreen - it does make a huge difference, and allows you to actually appreciate the environments and combat."
shadowofmordor,3dj9qn,SymmetryDearSteinman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:34:25 2015 UTC,Can you reset your abilities mid-game?  Is there any indication that the game might get mod support?
shadowofmordor,3dgbxj,shiftry,6,Thu Jul 16 01:25:57 2015 UTC,Advancing time can help captains level up without you dying.

shadowofmordor,3dgbxj,HeadCrusher135,2,Thu Jul 16 01:39:29 2015 UTC,"You can advance time to let the power struggles play out automatically to let captains get a higher level. You can also just activate their power struggles and help them complete it if you don't want to sit on the map menu all day, pressing the advance time button.   The wiki also has a little formula for how to get higher level runes; in case you wanted to know."

If that has no issues, then the previous save must be messed up somehow.  Do u have a backup on the cloud? If so, delete the one on your system an pull that save down from the cloud and have a look.

shadowofmordor,3dcukj,KYAmiibro,3,Wed Jul 15 07:20:40 2015 UTC,"The general consensus seems to be that getting 'some' health first gives the greatest bang for your buck. I recommend unlocking 2 of these first.  The usefulness of rune slots really depend on the available runes (which are rather lackluster early-game) and focus/elf-shots depend a bit on your play style to be worth it. I personally skipped these at first.  The weapon power abilities can take out captains or a good number of trash, instantly (early on at least). However you might feel yourself grinding to charge these abilities only to trivialize the big fights."
shadowofmordor,3dcukj,mostlikely4real,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:56:28 2015 UTC,"So far I have 3 health upgrades and the first elf-shot and focus upgrades. I'm at 1700 currency.  Which do you suggest I go for? Urafel, AzkÃ¢r, or Acharn? I don't know if the 20 seconds of executions or 20 seconds of unlimited stealth kills is the most powerful.  As for being overpowered, I don't mind that. I like to be successful at games, even if it becomes easier."
shadowofmordor,3dcukj,mostlikely4real,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:57:13 2015 UTC,I can refer to reddit discussion  Personally I went with Acharn because:  1) I spend most of my time stealth-killing (especially before I engage a captain) so it's more convenient to charge up.   2) The slow-motion while active gives you free reign to move in or out as needed.  3) It can be used in non-combat situations.  The downsides are that prolonged combat situations require me to run as it can not be charged during combat (unlike Urafel). Also I read that Azkar has great synergy with shadow strike. I'm holding +2500 to get either of those next.

shadowofmordor,3deghd,Corzare,2,Wed Jul 15 18:49:44 2015 UTC,"I meant it like, you didn't really do anything in the video, you kinda killed some dudes and then that was that. Not to discourage you from doing what you want, just my two cents."
shadowofmordor,3dbqt0,JaysFan26,18,Wed Jul 15 01:07:26 2015 UTC,Work on your counters and jump over enemies if it gets too intense. Once you get some abilities like branding it gets alot easier (too easy in the mid-late game really).
shadowofmordor,3dbqt0,SymmetryDearSteinman,8,Wed Jul 15 02:52:45 2015 UTC,"It depends a bit on what exactly if killing you.   If normal uruks are slipping attacks through, you really need to up the counters to 100%. Unless you are in the process of landing an attack on one that's flashing the counter button, counter! No other action takes precedence here. From my experience the most attacks you have to counter at once are two (even with 50 around you) which you can catch 100% of the time.  If you are mostly hit by dodge-able attacks that you can not counter, I suggest keeping more distance. Spend more time moving or dodging towards the edge of the group (while keeping your counter up) and work on what you want to do from there.  If those two aren't an issue, I suggest running and hiding more. Move to the edge of the group, keep your counter up, and run/climb. Often your main objective (one of the captains) will either leave the rest behind or stay put while the rest follows you some. Eventually you can circle back and finish the job. Remember, your death resets their health and increases their power, running away does not.  Look on these forums for more tips."
shadowofmordor,3dbqt0,mostlikely4real,4,Wed Jul 15 07:24:03 2015 UTC,"In addition to this, don't forget your bow! Big fat warspear uruks with a shield getting annoying? Jump into focus mode and headshot a couple. Same with Berserkers if they are the trouble. Common warriors and archers rarely bring any trouble, warriors you can just counter and whack away at while archers very rarely stay in the pack and can be taken out one by one or shot down with the bow if there are no other special uruks. Later when you get more abilities it'll get much easier aswell."
shadowofmordor,3dbqt0,Nenija,3,Wed Jul 15 10:59:39 2015 UTC,"Same happened to me, I suck at gaming in general and fighting seemed impossible. Three recommendations:   ABOVE ALL just be patient and keep trying until you get to Tier 3 abilities, the combat will become much smoother against big groups. Focus on mastering finishers! Make sure you know well how to actually KILL your enemies (keep an eye con streaks in  order to do so), and NEVER underestimate the usefulness of stunning your enemies. Those few extra seconds of ""peace"" can be crucial. Prepare your battle well before you start. See your main opponent's weakness and try to plan a way to use them in your favor. Believe me it helps A LOT, specially when a war chief can be damaged by ranged attacks, or needless to say when it can be instantly killed by stealth finishers (in which case I recommend to always go with a stealth kill from the roofs).   Good luck, mate, be patient. I almost gave up on the game because I couldn't handle huge combats. I just kept on dying in stupid ways and the Uruk Captains kept on getting stronger and harder to kill. But then again, once you get the hang of it, you'll realize why this is probably one of the best games ever made.   EDIT: Extra tip: Remember that killing the major uruk will make the others flee... Prioritize your target and focus on ending him. Plus, do events with red logos from time to time, they can be pretty useful!"
shadowofmordor,3dbqt0,nicohfdc,2,Wed Jul 15 08:31:58 2015 UTC,"Early in the game, focus on hit and run attacks. Key word being run. Pick your target, make a quick kill and then get out of there or you will be stuck fighting uruk reinforcements until your health is whittled down.  To increase your survivability, other than increasing your combat abilities, focus on weapon runes that allow you to regain health during open combat. A couple of those and you will be close to unstoppable."
shadowofmordor,3dbqt0,Bangersss,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:32:05 2015 UTC,"If it is just the normal mobs of uruks that you are routinely having trouble with, there are typically lots of conveniently placed ""traps"" in the strongholds.  Shoot down Morgai fly nests, release a caragor, shoot a fire and incinerate the overwhelming hordes.  Or. . . get higher.  You usually can find something to climb and get a breather in the middle of an intense fight.  If you have unlocked shadow strike, that's a great way to get some distance and regain your composure before jumping back into the fray.  I would recommend advancing the main storyline until you have unlocked that ability if you haven't already, it's very helpful.  If it is captains you are having trouble with, definitely take the time to learn their strengths/weaknesses before heading into battle.  Survey the stronghold in stealth mode to identify all the captains lurking to make sure you know who you are up against.  The preparation is all, my friend."

shadowofmordor,3dbqt0,90guys,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:27:11 2015 UTC,"Never start a fair fight.  If you can, eliminate uruks in elevated positions first, then use the open roofs to escape conflict and to stealth kill enemies one at a time.  Sneak most of the time. I've taken out four uruks sitting around a fire in quick succession with stealth kills without any of them fully noticing me. Any time there is an arrow above their heads you can stealth kill them, along with when you aren't detected. You can actually stealth kill in combat if you can sneak around behind the target.  Some abilities are insanely useful in combat. If you have daggers you can stun approaching enemies and build combo for an execution. Executions are very useful, because they instantly kill an enemy and give your fingers a rest from mashing buttons for a second or two."

They will appear on your map with a special icon. When you go to that location you can start the quest and you must kill the orc captain that is set as your objective(there is usually a secondary objective that you can do to make it more of a challenge).  Also as far as i know you don't need to have friends that play SoM. These quests can appear randomly from other users as well.
shadowofmordor,3d65mw,Rift_R,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:19:38 2015 UTC,You don't need friends... but I have none as all my buddies game on consoles...  Friend? :)

shadowofmordor,3d6nfp,jacksmind,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:00:14 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I  just got my hands on this gem myself, and the forum has called to me from across the void to speak with others about this awesome game!! I've found the game extremely addicting, and Im constantly wanting to muck about in Mordor. Now I just got the game a week ago, so I don't claim to know all the ins and outs of the game. But, I'd say in regards to your op, For my first run I stuck to the story as much as possible (sometimes you just end up going on Orc killing sprees) and just learn the gameplay/nemesis system.   Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'm starting a new run. I've found the skills that I like and others that I find a bit OP that I'm going to avoid to make things more interesting ( for me that's the stun vault, head explosions, double finishers and the sword and knife unlimited execute skills at the bottom)  I've also found the nemesis system requires a little give and take to get the full effect. Which means sometimes letting captains get away from your onslaught, killing them in ways that insure they have a chance to return (not lopping there heads off haha) or dying/running away yourself. No matter what those filthy orcs say, it is okay to run if your getting overwhelmed and it helps build your rivals power.  Then last of course, you can always change skins to help mix things up. I'm pretty sure at least 2 are free (the black hand and lithariel sp?) but I've played both my runs as Celebrimbor cause he is my favorite character of this story. Plus he just looks bada**, and I feel the gameplay fits him the best. Especially with fully upgraded weapons. For me it looks more ""natural"" for an elf to be doing all the crazy flips and climbing walls, jumping on caragors graugs and whatnot. I'm also not a huge fan of capes myself and I like his armored look much more.  Well that ended up longer then I expected...happy hunting!"
shadowofmordor,3d6nfp,IAMJDR,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:07:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, man :) I can tell you're enjoying it as much as I am !   I've decided to complete the story first and then do another run, this time purposely avoiding purchasing some of the abilities (I got the Blade Master skill and the double execution one and now it seems like I get my executions every two seconds and makes the fights uninteresting). Granted, I could just not us the execution when available but they're so damn cool!   What you said about the nemesis system - I had not thought about it that way before. Playing around with that could very well be mighty craic! I just sort of looked at it before as ''Kill aaall orcs'' and didn't even consider manipulating it too much outside of what's required for certain missions."
shadowofmordor,3d6nfp,IAMJDR,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:02:36 2015 UTC,"No problem glad I could share. It's pretty hard not to just kill everything in this game, it's just so fun. But yeah I started by finding the Uruks I think look the best and helping them raise in power. Cause I want my nemesis to look the part haha. I'm torn on double execute, it's just so awesome. I really feel it makes the game a lot less involved tho, so I've decided against it for my next run. well see how that goes, luckily you can have more then one save."
shadowofmordor,3d6nfp,Devin3279,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:30:16 2015 UTC,"yes, this is a super fun game.  This game was the reason I bought a PS4, and just started playing again to complete the Bright Lord DLC after being hooked on Bloodborne for a long while.  My advice is to basically . . . do what you want.  That's the best part of this game, honestly.  The nemesis system is amazing, and is actually more fun to just mess with the orc society than follow the main questline IMO, but the options truly open up after you unlock the 2nd area.  So you are probably best off progressing through the main storyline at least until you unlock that 2nd area, then do as you will.  Prepare to be a bit disappointed at the ending of the game, but enjoy the rest!"

shadowofmordor,3cxiv7,inguaz,3,Sat Jul 11 17:42:26 2015 UTC,"I advise you avoid it until you can play it on PC or a current gen console. The game doesn't look as good or run as smooth as other last gen titles and the Nemesis system is really limited, which is unfortunate because the Nemesis system is easily the best feature of SoM. Overall, on the PS3 you're paying for a clunky hack and slash game with a mediocre story."

One could be extending beyond the Black Gate into Ithilien, which could bring in Gondorians a bit more.  Maybe even Osgiliath? I'd also love to have some followers for Talion that would be factored into the Nemesis system.  They could have their own grudges, etc., and even die. Would love to see horses, too.

High level captains are more likely to get this because they will take a lot less damage from one hit, so you're lowering his health in very small steps.  It's supposed to be a state of 'you've beaten this guy, now decide his fate'. IIRC you have the chance to kill (not sure but this might be instant decapitation, don't quote me on that) or interrogate the captain. When they get on their knees, they'll always have some final words to share with you. Some of the dialogue is pretty amazing."

Business-wise, it makes sense for development on a sequel to start up soon, if it hasn't already, especially if they plan for this to be a franchise. So, that's another reason they're done with DLC on the first game."
shadowofmordor,3cfgxr,iamthebluegoose,2,Wed Jul 8 14:31:09 2015 UTC,"Haven't beaten the main quests yet so I don't know the story, but is the game open-ended enough to to allow for a second game? I've been wondering if they allowed for a direct sequel story or if a second game would be something very different."
shadowofmordor,3cfgxr,iamthebluegoose,2,Wed Jul 8 14:38:48 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'd say they definitely leave room for a sequel.  I think a totally different story/protagonist would be just as great, but I'm not going to complain about another game with Talion as the lead.  Looking forward to a reveal sometime in the next few months, hopefully."

IMO skill path doesn't matter that much.  Try to use more stealth, dodge plenty and always be ready to counter. Don't forget to use your execute function (b+y or circle+triangle)  Game is really easy once you get a hang of the gameplay."

shadowofmordor,3ccodz,crimson117,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:45:43 2015 UTC,Keep your finger hovering over that counter button. It's very important. Vault stun is also very helpful defensively.

You can manage to stealth kill two or three guys(even if they're looking at you) if you capitalize on the enemy's surprise and then disappear to do it again.

I didn't have the abilities yet to deal with the 'okay now there's 40 orcs' situation.  I ended up running away from most battles, and trying to drag the captain away on his own until the rest lost interest."
shadowofmordor,3c9s8n,i_literally_died,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:36:58 2015 UTC,"This might be obvious to most but just to be safe: ensure that you've picked up the execution ability. The game is significantly harder without it.   Find a large group of regular orcs and practice fighting & parrying. Don't ground execute them, you probably wont have enough time before another hits you. Do this till you're comfortable with parrying attacks.  Several abilities in later power tiers significantly ease combat. I don't really recommend this since it might make the game too easy too quickly (if you only level the right perks) but attend a bunch of power struggles to gain power. You dont even have to fight, once it finishes youll automatically gain 40 power. You can even run away and still gain power... But thats no fun :P"
shadowofmordor,3c3j2n,armyboy884,2,Sat Jul 4 12:25:18 2015 UTC,"So here is my recommendation.  I have a friend who had a hard time with the combat in this game. I'll tell you the advice that seemed to help him.  As a batman arkham game freak,  I found the combat in this was way more forgiving.  Wasn't a challenge for me at all. Not bragging I promise.  What I found though was once I got the ability to make the orks fight for me the game got even easier due to a pretty large loop hole in the system.   So you can jump over almost everyone in this game,  so what I'd do is jump over the guys in a large group run to the other side then spam the shit out of my throwing stars button. Every hit increases your multiplier.  Jump run spam, until your able to do a take down,  then turn the orks against each other.  Just keep doing this until the army has turned on each other allowing you a bit of breathing room.  At that point you can do combat like normal or just do the : jump, run, spam,  method.   Does this make sense?  If not I'll try and make a video of this later."

As someone who gamed with a much worse laptop than yours for a long time my advice is to get stuck into indie games - they run nicely on lower end hardware, are cheap, and do provide many great and varied game experiences.  It wasn't until last year when I was able to afford a proper gaming PC that I was able to play all the AAA releases including SoM.

My theory is that Sauron wanted Celebrimbor to regain his strength. It's been around 3000 years since the end of the Second Age, the age in which Celebrimbor lived. As he'd been turned into a wraith, he surely spent that time in the Unseen world. Even for an ageless creature like an elf, 3000 years of existing in a state where nothing really mattered and you had no one and nothing to even remind you of your own name would probably leave its mark. Namely memory loss and weakening.  As for the matter of Talion being chosen. I think that was pure chance. Sauron most likely needed someone with family and Talion had his with him. Celebrimbor once said that it was probably their shared pain that allowed him and Talion to be bound. I agree with this. Otherwise, why would Sauron bother to kill the wife and child of the chosen vessel specifically?  Hope this helps."

They needed him to become more powerful, maybe Sarong would be able to claim some of that power when absorbed. 2. The Black Hand chose a random Black Gate Guard with a family, because as Celebrimbor said their ""shared pain"" is what allowed them to be bound together. He definitely saw the opportunity of a sacrificed victim and took it. 3. He was in the unseen world for centuries upon centuries. The only thing he seems to remember was that he needed to stop Sauron"
shadowofmordor,3brq1c,Nethernox,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:44:09 2015 UTC,"I think that just means they will use 'Ambush' power struggles against their Uruk opponents, instead of 'Duel' or 'Execution'."
shadowofmordor,3brq1c,the_gerund,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:49:35 2015 UTC,I suspected as much. Weird that there's a trait that has virtually no impact on the player... I've observed that Ambushes have a high chance of succeeding but only without player intervention.  If Talion is present then it doesn't   succeed as often because the captain doing the Ambush only shows up in the 2nd wave.

Crew that serve under you, that can be replaced if they die and you can interact with walking about your ship. (total number growing as you obtain larger ships but you would still have to find them and recruit them).  The Nemisis engine would be applied to said crew, in that your crew remember your acts.  Ie if you pulled them out of the way of falling debris on a deserted ship you come across.  Or you had their back in a space bar brawl.  The kind of player you are would be reflected in both the decisions you make and how your crew treat you/think of you. From hero to villain to pirate."

shadowofmordor,3ax4w4,Falcitone,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:07:34 2015 UTC,Hey so I have the exact same specs as you but when I run at Ultra at 1080p I do not get 60fps. Any suggestions as to what could be causing that?
shadowofmordor,3auxmo,mcinerneyconor1,12,Tue Jun 23 18:35:16 2015 UTC,"I'd like a SoM with a bit more ""story missions"" than just mainly killing bosses"
shadowofmordor,3auxmo,MusicManReturns,2,Tue Jun 23 23:33:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed, as it did get a little repetitive but it would be great for them to use more stories from the lore to make that possible"
shadowofmordor,3auxmo,pellep,4,Wed Jun 24 17:17:59 2015 UTC,"To be honest i'm not sure if Shadow of Mordor 2 would be a good idea. Don't get me wrong I LOVE THIS GAME! But a follow up really would have to bring something new to the table, and that could be difficult without fucking up the core of the game which gives it the unique feel. I'm afraid a SoM 2 would just feel like a dlc for the first one."
shadowofmordor,3auxmo,pellep,3,Wed Jun 24 09:12:29 2015 UTC,One thing they could do is add a lot of stuff to the nemesis system and maybe have the first few hours of the game finishing talions story and then the remainder is going to a new area of middle earth with a new character and can see what they can do with it
shadowofmordor,3auxmo,SoleSoldier,2,Wed Jun 24 17:20:15 2015 UTC,That sounds like some interesting ideas! I would play it :D
shadowofmordor,3auxmo,TheDark1105,4,Wed Jun 24 17:23:45 2015 UTC,"A more in-depth nemesis system with other chaotic elements thrown into the gameplay would be great to see. One thing that bothered me were the outcasts and that they all looked the same, without the option to upgrade them or make them a reckoning force against Mordor's Uruk-Hai."
shadowofmordor,3auxmo,Vorpal_Kitten,7,Wed Jun 24 19:10:47 2015 UTC,"I love Monolith. Have ever since playing FEAR. But I would love to see them tackle a new IP. I'm a proud owner of SoM and loved every second of it, but I would love to see the talent get poured into something new.  That's not to say I'd be disappointed in a SoM 2, I'm sure there's loads they learned during the first game they could improve on in a sequel. I would just prefer to see something new, something to drive the nemesis system to an entirely new level."
shadowofmordor,3auxmo,themactastic25,2,Tue Jun 23 19:17:15 2015 UTC,"I mean, wouldn't it be better for them to take the Nemesis system and design a game around it from the ground up? Not having to use a specific 'boss' no matter what because it's tied to a pre-established IP."
shadowofmordor,3asiay,D5Guima,2,Tue Jun 23 03:53:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, my understanding is that with SoM, it'll default to the language that your console is in. So, if your cousin switches his PS4's native language to Portuguese, it should transfer over!"
shadowofmordor,3asiay,MonolithAndy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:22:14 2015 UTC,"We tried that, and it doesn't work :/. Thanks for taking your time to answer :D."

Just some feedback for you though; Since you're doing a voice-over i'd personally say the background music should be a bit lower, so your voice is the main focus. Great job otherwise! :)  Edit: I'd understand it being a bit hard to sort that though as the music track in particular has a lot of quiet and loud points to balance xD Edit2: Finished watching, loved the humor :D Great video, subbed! :)"

shadowofmordor,3a3wp8,bstones,3,Wed Jun 17 14:31:37 2015 UTC,"If there is a Game of the Year edition, get that instead since it would come with all the DLC.  If not, this isn't a good deal.  It's been much cheaper, so I would either wait or go bargain hunt online.    That said, the game is great without the DLC, one of my favorite gaming experiences recently thanks to the Nemesis System.  The DLC, while good and quite fun on their own, doesn't add much, they're far too short.    The base game I would say buy if you can find it for less than $20.  The GotY edition, maybe $30 and cheaper would be a good deal."
shadowofmordor,3a34nk,Leonidas_U,2,Tue Jun 16 21:19:21 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately no, you have to dismiss a branded orc after getting 1 intel/giving 1 command. You'll have to find the captain again in order to get more intel from the captain."
shadowofmordor,3a34nk,Kyakan,2,Wed Jun 17 04:41:19 2015 UTC,I'm not at that point in the game yet so bear with me. Is it hard to find him again? Can you just run after him after getting information?
shadowofmordor,3a34nk,FakeChiBlast,2,Thu Jun 18 14:32:40 2015 UTC,"Finding them again is no more difficult than finding any other captain, with the added benefit that they don't fight back when you're running up to them.   After getting the information they're teleported away, so running after him immediately isn't really an option."
shadowofmordor,3a34nk,Kyakan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:05:06 2015 UTC,You have the option to kill them or release them.

shadowofmordor,39zelw,EmperorXenu,4,Tue Jun 16 00:55:28 2015 UTC,I don't think there are any mods. I think it's because shadow of mordor doesn't quite easily mod itself.
shadowofmordor,39zelw,Ovalidem,2,Tue Jun 16 12:55:17 2015 UTC,No games ever easily modded itself :D. But what he says is true the games locked down i imagine. All there is is FOV mod/widescreen gaming that is a must imo.

shadowofmordor,39z7i6,Hobo_in_Hawaii,2,Mon Jun 15 23:54:33 2015 UTC,Position on page and location have no relation. I believe resurrected captains don't appear in the army page until you meet them in battle again. Just keep fighting orcs and he either will or won't come back.

shadowofmordor,39xhbw,Xeromemred1,15,Mon Jun 15 16:29:16 2015 UTC,Try to find a captain that is vulnerable to stealth finishers. You can just sneak behind them and stealth brand them.
shadowofmordor,39xhbw,magic_lumps,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"So I found a decent way to do this, in the Bright Lord DLC, hide and then use the one ring, sneak up them and stealth brand them before the ring's effect is over."
shadowofmordor,39xhbw,Aled4192,2,Fri Jun 19 13:20:01 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this achievement was introduced with this DLC and that's how I did it. Just get his health low enough then activate the one ring's power press sneak button and brand button it might take  a few tries because they'll resist, you don't have to hide or anything."
shadowofmordor,39xhbw,neverender158,0,Fri Jun 19 23:31:53 2015 UTC,Make sure the skull that id's the captain had turned green.  This means you can grab them and you should be able to brand them.
shadowofmordor,39xhbw,spicypancakes,5,Mon Jun 15 21:52:42 2015 UTC,"That's not a stealth brand, though."
shadowofmordor,39xhbw,neverender158,2,Tue Jun 16 13:24:12 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. Sorry I didn't read that correctly. So I guess you would have to do as /u/magic_lumps said and find a captain that is vulnerable to stealth finishers.

shadowofmordor,39bzu4,Digita186,6,Wed Jun 10 19:15:08 2015 UTC,It doesn't actually follow much of the actual Canon either.

shadowofmordor,39bzu4,lordwafflesbane,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:52:28 2015 UTC,"A lot of the filling in stuff kind of does contrast with canon, but I guess some of it could kind of follow it but fill it in."

shadowofmordor,39bzu4,90guys,3,Thu Jun 11 04:39:10 2015 UTC,"Not really, it stands alone pretty well and explains itself a lot. There might be some talk about the rings that will seem to drag on and be slightly confusing if you know nothing about them, but it wraps itself up and doesn't rely on external sources. Actually, I found this to be a much better story than the original LotR stories, imo. It's grittier and darker than the original story. I can only think of one major event in the originals that affects SoM at all, but it is also a naturally occurring event, so it's still believable. It's probably better for the experience of the story if you had pre-existing knowledge, but not required and won't affect gameplay.  Extra note, it's way better on new-gen systems, but still enjoyable on last gen stuff."

shadowofmordor,396h6c,danbot,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:52:05 2015 UTC,I have the same problem. I tried being a lower level or health than him when I killed him. I tried making him escape and finding him again. Doesn't matter what I do it seems he won't come back to life with updated traits and appearance.

If you command them to attack another captain, it will create an event like an execution. You can command them to be a bodyguard for a warchief and it will create an event like gathering recruits or trial by ordeal."

shadowofmordor,38wrnn,Ninjaspar10,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:24:43 2015 UTC,I think it was a combat finisher against the Hammer. Laughed my ass off :D
shadowofmordor,38wrnn,glados131,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:40:47 2015 UTC,Fun fact-- faces that ridiculous happen on every character when they do a combat finisher.  Use this knowledge wisely.
shadowofmordor,38uxsc,FrancoCJ,11,Sun Jun 7 01:17:25 2015 UTC,"My most is 5 times. I've thrown a captain off of the ledge in Nurn, burnt him, shot him in the face, had him mauled by a caragor, and had his own men shot him by accident. He still came back. It was our 10th-ish fight because we'd trade death for death.  Has anyone actually gone in the game files or something and worked out how the RNG for determining Uruk survival works? do decapitations really count as a permanent kill or does it just decrease the chances significantly? And IS there a death cap at a point where a Captain can NEVER come back after a certain number of deaths?"
shadowofmordor,38uxsc,PlatFleece,3,Sun Jun 7 08:05:55 2015 UTC,"I had to kill Luga the black 6 or 7 times but the last time was a decapitation and he hasn't come back so I think they're like the immortals in Highlander, take their heads and they won't return."
shadowofmordor,38uxsc,IAMA_Drunk_Armadillo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:22:57 2015 UTC,I wonder if the game tags Uruks that have died around 3 times non-lethally as getting a higher chance of revival? To simulate that always coming back nemesis thing?  I really am curious to how this whole thing works to be honest. It's very interesting
shadowofmordor,38uxsc,PlatFleece,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:37:10 2015 UTC,"I too am curious as to what the conditions for making a captain ""resurrect"" are. I have tried some things but none of them have seemed to work."
shadowofmordor,38uxsc,Ovalidem,2,Wed Jun 10 20:36:32 2015 UTC,I dont know about the death cap but I'm pretty sure that the developers said in one of their livestreams when the game wasnt released yet that decapitation = 100% death

shadowofmordor,38mxnc,Jiratoo,3,Fri Jun 5 07:15:54 2015 UTC,Just found out that about this DLC The Blight Lord where you take control of Celebrimbor before he was killed by Sauron. You can actually see his thirst for power while he wears the One Ring.

shadowofmordor,38mxnc,supahmonkey,3,Tue Jun 9 05:42:50 2015 UTC,"What I'm guessing is that Talion believes that forging a new ring of power using all of Celebrimbor's power would allow him to fight Sauron in his weakened state and finish him for good.   Obviously, this isn't actually the case. Thankfully the fellowship happened before things got too out of hand."

shadowofmordor,38j8k4,TheLastFruit,3,Thu Jun 4 16:18:56 2015 UTC,Is there a way to start fire without the bow ability? I can't seem to get a attack combo going near him since he one shots me. I have followed him for almost an hour at one point; waiting for him to get near an explosive with no luck. Will the pin shot work if he is immune to ranged?
shadowofmordor,38j8k4,HoneypuffCereal,10,Thu Jun 4 16:21:35 2015 UTC,"You can shoot grog barrels, they explode and will light any orc in the blast radius on fire."
shadowofmordor,38j8k4,Chabazz,5,Thu Jun 4 16:23:03 2015 UTC,That is the right tactic- you need to either draw him to an area with fire/grog barrels - then burn him good- once he goes green - kill/brand him.
shadowofmordor,38j8k4,ShreddyZ,11,Thu Jun 4 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"He's still stunnable and he's still vulnerable to regular attacks, so I'd do the following:   Kill everyone else around him to make things easier. Jump over and stun hin Start attacking but stop before you activate the finisher Use wrath flash Repeat   Alternatively, if he's standing next to fire and you have the ability that let's you explode firepits with arrows, that should light him on fire. I don't think fire arrows do the trick because he's invulnerable to ranged."

shadowofmordor,38j8k4,toavahi,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:16:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know how many abilities you've unlocked, so I'm adding all the options. However, if you're really low level, just give up and come back later.  Get your attack streak up any way you can, then shoot him with a fire arrow (if you've unlocked the skill). If you you haven't unlocked the fire arrow, the way I usually take down combat masters is by stunning them with Wraith Stun or by jumping over them (which is also an ability you have to unlock), using the flurry attack (don't finish it, as it will have no effect on combat masters, just use it to get your attack streak up) and use Wraith Flash to weaken them. If you have a rune that increases your weapon damage after your streak hits a certain number, just attack him without stunning him. If he becomes weakened, grab him and shank him to death. You can also do that if he becomes frightened, in his case, by fire. All in all, do your best to set him on fire.  You can also use a branded captain (if you have one) to start a riot. The branded captain and his men can help you take him down. Also, there's usually a grog barrel that you can catch him on fire with somewhere on the battlefield.  EDIT: Needless to say, stay as close to him as you can and keep him from shooting his crossbow. Looking at his stats, if he nails you, you're fucked."

I am doubting whether captains actually come back after a certain point in the game and to be honest, that would be disappointing."

shadowofmordor,37zsaa,Blood_Fox,2,Sun May 31 20:01:52 2015 UTC,What is your preferred strategy?  I have every trophy in this game but the two trials from each DLC and have not gave them a very serious attempt because of how frustrating I've read they can be.  I one time tried the backup save trick but it still takes a couple of hours and I still screwed it up.  I've read some people like to gain intel on all 20 captains and wipe them all out then the warchiefs.  Some encourage use of the riot mechanic and some encourage just getting a gruag and running around with wraith vision on.  Since you saved about 10 minutes on an achievement that most people go into the last minute for I assume you have a pretty effective strategy.  If you don't want to fully disclose it I understand but any hints would be really appreciated.  For the Hunt is my Mistress and Lord of the Ring achievements
shadowofmordor,37zsaa,Serpenth,2,Mon Jun 1 05:06:18 2015 UTC,"It was actually REALLY frustrating at first.  It took only three tries, but I was screaming at the orcs, and swearing. It was baaad. I even ended up giving up halfway through a try because of how badly it was going.  I used this YouTube video, and watched it until I memorized the patterns...   I used a graug for almost every single captain kill, except the ones I could not reach with a graug.   Grab all the uruks you can, and gain intel on all captains. You dont need a weakness on any of them.  if you find a ""worm"" or ""intel"", use those on those warchiefs. If you can, try to uncover ugakuga, as he's the only warchief who can riot ""ghul keeper"" and possibly win. Just in case you get a bad draw and have no graug bait nearby. If you DO, well you're very lucky, and enjoy eating the ghul keeper. I use a pattern from the center, go to the right, and slighty upward. then circle down and around until you reach the southern center stronghold, that has a graug bait on it. At this point, you SHOULD have all the intel on the captains. Ignore the time, you'll only get more frustrated. Practice is better than to quit and try again. Use the graug, eat your fill. After the captains are dead, the ONLY captains alive should be the power struggle ones. Go get ugakuga and dominate him.  Use ugakuga and riot the other warchiefs. After that, riot the leftover captains.  On the last captain, kill the captain, then dispatch everyone including ugakuga for the achieve.   It's all in that YouTube video, honestly. It's a GREAT video, and I got it correct the second time around.   TIP: Bodyguards enter into the riots. The more bodyguards a warchief has, the more you can kill all at once. Keep this in mind.  Remember to take your time.  It seems like it's not enough time, but it's easily enough if you don't stress about it too much.  Just pay attention to it sometimes, and keep up your pace.  I don't use the save strategy.  Just run it all the way through.   I actually JUST did the Lord of the Rings achievement for my last achievement in the game  It's REALLY easy. I even screwed around half the time and tried the ""brand 20 uruks in 60 seconds"" achievement for like 10 minutes. You'll be fine."
shadowofmordor,37zsaa,Serpenth,2,Mon Jun 1 06:57:57 2015 UTC,Awesome thank you!   I just got the bright lord one pretty easily after giving it a serious try.   So im going to study this video and give the wild one a try tomorrow!

shadowofmordor,37xyiq,minolin,12,Sun May 31 09:36:37 2015 UTC,Obviously you love this game and want to share it with her (understandable). But you need to ask yourself if this is really the game for her. SoM is a very combat-oriented game.   She might be better off with Skyrim and a 'peaceful mode' mod.
shadowofmordor,37xyiq,Liraniel,3,Sun May 31 11:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this isn't really an exploration game. Skyrim would be perfect."

That said, I've looked up some forum posts from cheatengine but they don't seem to have any recent posts.   Do you know when the most recent update for SoM was on Steam? I haven't played in a number of months. Which trainer did you attempt to use?"
shadowofmordor,37xyiq,geforce78,2,Sun May 31 11:27:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your effort! Our game version on Steam is ""Update: Build v1951.27"" which went live on 28th of may. The trainer we tried is called ""Shadow Of Mordor 02-18-2015 Trainer +8 MrAntiFun"" - which is probably too old. (and btw fighting is not the major problem, even if my little finger is often cramping becauses of the permanent stealth, but dying is. I absolutely hate dying :[ )"
shadowofmordor,37xyiq,Ninjaspar10,1 point,Sun May 31 23:44:16 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, there are no cheatengine or godmode hacks for this version. Your two choices from herein would be to either wait for an undated cheatengine or to download an older version of the game that is compatible.  As the community around SoM has for the most part died out, there is little chance of an update to cheatengine coming soon. My recommendation would be to download an older version from one of many torrenting sites and using that to mod.  Hope that's helped some."
shadowofmordor,37xyiq,glados131,2,Mon Jun 1 05:40:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the main draw of the game is the Nemesis System, being able to forge your own stories and whatnot.  And it runs almost entirely on combat.  The risk of dying is integral to its success.  Not sure a god mode would work well."

shadowofmordor,37xcno,OhManTFE,2,Sun May 31 10:22:05 2015 UTC,"They were generally received poorly over here.  I'd say the hunting one was good but not worth $10.  The bright lord was not liked at all, but I didn't complete it so can't comment."
shadowofmordor,37xcno,erythro,1 point,Sun May 31 08:51:07 2015 UTC,"I think for $5 each they are worth it- not the greatest DLCs ever, but solidly entertaining, plus, fighting Sauron is pretty neat."

I think you're getting a better deal with the GOTY edition.  You might end up liking the game a lot and want to play the DLC, so it's a few bucks cheaper to prepay than to try and get it later, unless there is another sale or something.  It's fun.  I've invested about 60 hrs into it and am about to finish The Bright Lord."
shadowofmordor,37sd7g,zacheath,4,Sat May 30 00:20:48 2015 UTC,"Yes they will. All of those power struggles on the map will play themselves out if you advance time, and the warchiefs will change accordingly :)"

It's like a fast forward and all the power struggles are played and most if not all open slot get taken.   I do not recommend this if you are trying to kill all of the war chiefs as it immediately repopulates them."
shadowofmordor,37u4ns,Kubrick_Fan,2,Sat May 30 12:15:36 2015 UTC,What am I looking at here?
shadowofmordor,37u4ns,PoisonousPlatypus,2,Sat May 30 16:20:37 2015 UTC,I took out a bunch of low and midlevel captains today after finding the game difficult earlier in the week.
shadowofmordor,37oxzc,amoralism,6,Fri May 29 06:41:29 2015 UTC,Certain things in the open world will change slightly as you progress through the story missions. New mission types will become available and you'll get new abilities. It's open world but with a story that manifests itself through the missions.  My advice - I'd play the ratbag missions through till the end then you've unlocked just about everything so can just do what you want. If you want to continue playing the story then play the story. The open world will still be there when you've finished.
shadowofmordor,37oxzc,The_Captainn,2,Fri May 29 08:30:10 2015 UTC,do the side missions stay after completion of the main story?
shadowofmordor,37oxzc,zarkonis11,1 point,Fri May 29 18:58:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can complete them after the main story"
shadowofmordor,37oxzc,Russeru,3,Sun May 31 21:00:23 2015 UTC,"Well the cool thing about open-world games is that they don't tell you what to do right? If you want to just go around killing orcs and captains all day, go ahead. If you like the collectibles/lore or the sidequests, then do that.   The main story mostly just serves to improve your abilities (and opens a huge new area when you do enough). I'd suggest do as much side stuff as you want, then when you feel underpowered or just bored then do the main story missions.  Also the intel system is kinda optional, but it helps you exploit the weaknesses of the captains which comes in handy once they get harder."
shadowofmordor,37oxzc,Russeru,2,Fri May 29 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"I see, this makes more sense haha thank you!"
shadowofmordor,37oxzc,Haloninja744,3,Fri May 29 18:58:29 2015 UTC,"No problem. Also if you want to make the game look better while giving you a bit more of a challenge, try turning off some of the UI settings like the giant counterattack button that pops up."
shadowofmordor,37oxzc,Russeru,2,Fri May 29 19:06:06 2015 UTC,"Ok awesome, I might do that a little later once I get used to fighting more"
shadowofmordor,37oxzc,CarrotOnAStick,2,Fri May 29 19:29:49 2015 UTC,O_O you can turn off the combat pop-ups..... I die so much because I don't hit the key fast enough playing without them would make me a psychopath
shadowofmordor,37oxzc,CarrotOnAStick,2,Mon Jun 1 02:10:06 2015 UTC,"haha it's definitely a challenge. forces you to be more aware of your surroundings and do crowd-control with arrows, daggers, explosions, and branding rather than just jumping in the middle of a dozen orcs and spamming the counterattack button."

shadowofmordor,37kqdv,NameIdeas,2,Thu May 28 18:12:48 2015 UTC,"Yup, this. While this game does allow for different playstyles you gotta remember youre a ranger, not a one man army. Although playing a one man army is certainly a lot of fun"
shadowofmordor,37kqdv,Jim_Stick,7,Fri May 29 00:53:41 2015 UTC,"I would say it is a stealth game early on.  Once you've played for a while, it becomes more of a run in type of action game.  The game does reward stealth more than going in guns blazing, however."
shadowofmordor,37kqdv,jameson_the_dude,4,Thu May 28 20:43:01 2015 UTC,This is definitely true!
shadowofmordor,37kqdv,Neixus,3,Thu May 28 22:27:17 2015 UTC,I absolutely love the stealth in this game as its pretty forgiving compared to other stealth titles. You have a grace period of about 2 seconds between an orc spotting you and entering combat. Getting close to him in that window still provides a stealth kill and no other orcs are alerted.
shadowofmordor,37kqdv,TheSilentHedges,6,Thu May 28 14:17:19 2015 UTC,"This is not a stealh game, you can go all out aswell. Excluding some story missions where it's required to remain undetected."
shadowofmordor,37kwx9,astronax,8,Thu May 28 11:21:58 2015 UTC,You are playing it wrong.. Even on the hardest difficulty with the least upgrades its not hard.  Don't forget that you can always RUN AWAY from a fight... Vault/roll often.. Run and pickup health... Split up the group... Headshots.... Counter counter counter... Hit hit streak special attack.... Don't go flurry until you have learnt the time it takes perfect... Do ratbags missions until Death Threat... Place death threats on every captain before you attack them... Place death threats on all warchiefs.... Use runes... Lead enemies to the wild animals... Unlock explosive arrows and shoot firepits and barrels.. Counter counter counter....

shadowofmordor,37kwx9,drunodrundridge,3,Thu May 28 11:40:37 2015 UTC,"So when I'm playing again, I need to:  Escape from fights when an army is chasing me.  Use my bow more.  Do as many side missions as possible.  Apply death threats.  What is a death threat, what are ratbag missions? Thank you. I have already been using runes, and I already have the trait which allows me to blow up barrels and fires and such."
shadowofmordor,37kwx9,intelnavi,9,Thu May 28 11:55:58 2015 UTC,Hold down the sneak button.  Always.
shadowofmordor,37kwx9,YawgmothForPresident,5,Thu May 28 14:55:59 2015 UTC,"Also use stealth. Brutalize. Shoot explosive stuff and free caragors.  Ratbag missions are storyline missions specifically dealing with the uruk Ratbag. Won't go into spoilers, but they're all simple enough."
shadowofmordor,37kwx9,themactastic25,1 point,Thu May 28 14:49:18 2015 UTC,Ratbag missions are normal mission.  Youll come to them through the course of the game.  They are gold icons on the map.  The white and red icons are side stuff.    You cant do death threat until a certain point in the story.
shadowofmordor,37kwx9,drunodrundridge,1 point,Thu May 28 18:49:06 2015 UTC,"Do the main missions and you free Ratbag from being tied up. He tries to become a warchief, and you got to help kill his way to the top.  He, after 3 or so missions, gets you to put a death threat on another chief (do that interrogate thing and place a death threat - gives you a greater chance of epic runes and epic runes are completely sick).  So yeah, do those missions up until the death threat and then once you unlock that you can pretty much go gangbusters on the XP and unlock nearly everything in the skill tree before going to second area."
shadowofmordor,37kwx9,FuckAthiesmPolitics,1 point,Thu May 28 19:53:49 2015 UTC,Yes...but looking like a badass while doing it is the challenge.(I've had the game for 2 days)
shadowofmordor,37kwx9,dead_ed,3,Sat May 30 23:51:40 2015 UTC,"That's how I started out. I'm a functional idiot and I figured it out. For a while, i was just terrified to venture out beyond the tower. Do this, run out and start a fight, but if you start to lose it, retreat up the tower. Get some practice whompings in and it'll snap. Fighting is actually really easy, but initially intimidating. Just keep your exit strategy in mind, if needed. Once you get some skills built up, then exit strategies aren't required because you can beat everything."
shadowofmordor,37kwx9,Russeru,2,Thu May 28 16:12:25 2015 UTC,It's definitely tricky at first before you have a lot of the good traits. I'd stay away from the strongholds for now and do the main story missions until you're a bit stronger.
shadowofmordor,37kwx9,Squirrel009,1 point,Thu May 28 13:46:07 2015 UTC,I've just been doing side missions and getting intel so far. So I should just carry on with the main story?
shadowofmordor,37kwx9,Russeru,5,Thu May 28 22:21:00 2015 UTC,In my experience the further you get in the story the stronger you get. You get more abilities. You start off a damned man facing a horde of orcs all by yourself. In the end you are the Lord of Orcs. Warlords who once sent you running bloody and bruised are now your playthings that you pit against each other for sport until they bore you and you slaughter them like cattle to bring in a new crop.
shadowofmordor,37kwx9,sui146714,1 point,Fri May 29 01:24:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say mix it up between the two. Don't rush the main story too much, but definitely just do a few missions whenever you feel underpowered."
shadowofmordor,37hn4a,blowthatglass,4,Wed May 27 18:27:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, you can. Just go to the game's folder, go to x64, then to profile, and then your profile. There should be a stats folder in there, open up stats.bin in a text reader."

shadowofmordor,37deif,Keksus_,33,Tue May 26 21:25:08 2015 UTC,just shoot. it's not that the game actually restricts you.
shadowofmordor,37deif,erythro,8,Wed May 27 00:19:06 2015 UTC,Find a vantage point with lots of arrows and shoot him in the head with fully charged shots.  Even an unupgraded bow should do the trick.
shadowofmordor,37deif,atomiczap,15,Wed May 27 07:25:30 2015 UTC,"Lure him near something you can explode? Even if you can't take him down with a bow, you can use it to blow up grog/fires."
shadowofmordor,37deif,TheChinkyBear,4,Tue May 26 23:14:02 2015 UTC,I usually use branded Uruks or a branded captain which works even better.
shadowofmordor,37deif,HoneypuffCereal,8,Tue May 26 23:16:31 2015 UTC,"Well, graugs are instant kill, so branding and riding one might kill him if he doesn't kill the behemoth while approach. Explosions seem to do the trick, but you need a bow for that. Branding his fellow uruk to bat him down probably works. All in all, time to put that bow to use."
shadowofmordor,37deif,ixipaulixi,3,Tue May 26 21:09:00 2015 UTC,"There is a way to damage an ork with combat master. The stun from Wraith Flash will let regular melee attacks do damage at higher hit streaks. This Captain is also vulnerable to wraith stun, so you can stun  him and use flurry hits to build your combo.   If you'd prefer a different, there are throwing knifes, which do a little damage and the shoulder charge move."
shadowofmordor,37deif,Skullmonkey_,3,Tue May 26 23:28:58 2015 UTC,"If you burn him, and hit him with a couple of charged headshots he should become weakened and flee. Pin him with an arrow, and brand him."

shadowofmordor,37deif,BrutallyHonestTIM,4,Tue May 26 23:53:52 2015 UTC,branding always works. doesn't even need to be an archer. all vulnerabilities and strengths only apply when talion attacks.

I think you can Shadow Strike him, though, so that way you can still use a combat finisher without having him block it with his ""combat master"" ability.  Edit:  Oh, and no matter how weak your arrows are bon fires and barrels will be just as effective at any level, except if you use fire arrows which are extra effective.  So try luring him close to explosive things."

shadowofmordor,3740be,Sephrik,4,Mon May 25 03:19:32 2015 UTC,"Really, I feel like how much you enjoy the DLC depends on how much you enjoy the base game.  I got a lot of enjoyment out of both DLC.  And without going into spoilers, let's just say many, MANY people were disappointed with the final boss of the base game, and the Bright Lord did a pretty good job of fixing that."

I remember having to explain to people how I intentionally gimped myself and disabled features to increase the difficulty.   That said, I'm not making light of your situation. If you aren't used to these types of games you might not be used to sneaking in to situations and the whole counter-combat thing can be tough. Timing counters is probably the most important skill you could have.   Best advice is to use every advantage you can. If there's orcs near campfires, fire arrows in to them to explode them. Use the beevhives, use your bow, and definitely stealth."

It feels like the game sets all kinds of options up for you.  That said, fights here can quickly get out of hand compared to the calculation you put into encounters in DS, but as long as I stay level-headed, follow cues, and know when to tactically retreat and pick off bits of a gang I do fine."

If there was a sliding scale of slow to fast paced melee combat that started at Thief and ended at Devil May Cry, you should be playing Shadow of Mordor at something between Assassin's Creed and Metal Gear Solid.  To quantify it:  Thief is a 1  Metal Gear is a 4  Assassin's Creed is a 7, ironically enough.  God of War is a 9  Devil May Cry is an 11  Play Shadow of Mordor at a 5 or 6. Half speed with a modicum of respect for the stealth system."

shadowofmordor,3722g5,Smoochum,3,Mon May 25 07:12:30 2015 UTC,"Stealth is key, take out as many enemies as you can that way. Otherwise, at least in the early game, the Wraith Stun and Execution are the best ways to win in those big open fights. Don't forget to pull out the bow for slow-mo kills when in tight spots either.  Also make sure to collect all artifacts and do all side missions as you go through to get yourself more practice and more abilities/stats before other bigger missions"
shadowofmordor,3722g5,phoenix2448,2,Sun May 24 04:33:47 2015 UTC,"Some tips: *Don't worry about the bonus if you are finding it frustrating or difficult. *Running away if you get noticed is a viable and even expected tactic. Break line of sight, then climb up something. It is very possible to re-hide if you get noticed. This won't work if a fortress alarm goes off, but even then, you can always run away from the entire fortress. * Best way to take archers out is using arrows. Most archers can be killed from a distance without anyone else noticing. *Climbing up and doing stealth takedowns from a ledge below or from behind are usually pretty straightforward for the same reason, once you get more practiced at movement. *Stealth movement is pretty fast. Use it a lot. *In a brawl, don't mash buttons. Just focus on strikes and counters. Use the dodge, jump over, and throwing knives to give yourself breathing room. In the beginning, those moves can be used indefinitely because you haven't encountered any enemies that can counter them."
shadowofmordor,3722g5,fishling,2,Sun May 24 06:47:31 2015 UTC,"Use stealth. Take out the alarms so they can't summon more orcs. If a high level captain appears and you can't take him run away. Try to lure your target to an isolated area then finish them off. Use the environment, fires, those wolf-like beasts. Find the weaknesses of the captains and use that to your advantage."
shadowofmordor,3722g5,jrstriker12,2,Sun May 24 18:44:43 2015 UTC,"I had trouble with that one too, I think the trick was to do stealth ledge take-downs where you are handing on the ledge they are standing on; it's a single button press that will stab them and yank them off the wall."

shadowofmordor,36e8gl,ExMonolithGuy,24,Mon May 18 22:51:25 2015 UTC,"Ex-Monolith dev here.   Â   I had to create a throwaway for this, because your story is one that's incredibly close to me. And, given the content of that story, /u/MonolithAndy can vouch for me. He'll know who I am.  Â   On August 14, 2013, I got switched from one type of design to another: helping design personalities and write dialog for the Nemesis system. Andy was tasked with doing the same, and even though his name doesn't say so in the credits, he was instrumental in making that game as solid as it is.   I was ecstatic, because I hadn't gotten to do any game writing for several years, and I really wanted to bring Shadow of Mordor to life in a way that people would remember for years to come. It was a huge thing, because I knew how hard it would be to accomplish. I was just glad people had enough faith in me (or were desperate enough) to let me write, as well as design.  Â   But less than a week later, on August 17, my best friend killed herself. I found her hanging from a sprinkler nozzle in her bathroom, all the lights off aside from a solitary candle burning on the bathroom counter. I loved her more than I ever thought possible. She was one of the two most important people in my life. I'd have taken a bullet for her, and I still would.  She had battled bipolar disorder for most of her incredibly short adult life, and self-medicated by drinking too much, putting herself in increasingly risky situations, and refusing outside assistance. She masked it all, being incredibly happy-go-lucky and devil-may-care when dealing with everyone else. Everyone but me. But even I didn't notice how bad it had become. I mean, my wife is bipolar, but she knows how to manage it. Lauren didn't.  For the next week or two, I didn't know what to do. I just knew I was going crazy - when I'd told her I couldn't imagine life without her, I meant it. So I did the only think I could think of.  Â   I started writing those fucking orcs.  Â   Every iota of anger, rage, helplessness, terror, bloodlust... Every single evil, vile thought I had went into those fucking orcs. Every time I felt overwhelmed, I stuffed it aside and let it boil over when I was at work. I tried to make the ugliest, most sickening personalities and behaviors I could, because I figured it I could just get it all out of myself, I would be okay. Because the orcs were the horrible things I felt inside myself - the guilt over not saving her, the anger at felt at her, or for her, because her family didn't let her feel like she could ask them for anything, because I should have been there to listen, or if I'd told her one more time that I loved her, that she'd still be there.  Orcs aren't horrible because they're vicious. They're horrible because, ultimately, all of them are afraid. They're terrified of a universe that doesn't want them, that can kill them at a whim, and the only way for them to make sense of it is to serve something that, while evil, is at least somewhat predictable. They are PTSD made manifest.  Â   The orcs are my voice, howling into the void, at a universe that doesn't care, won't listen, and is indifferent to anyone's suffering.  Â   So why am I telling you all of this? It's not just to rehash my history.  Â   It's because I made the game for you. You, /u/bipolarcarebear/.  I guess, more accurately, I made it for Lauren. Everything I did on it, I did it for her. I tried to make a game that she would have loved. Something to plug that enormous hole inside herself, for however short a time. Something that would have kept her alive for a few scant more weeks.  Â   But I also knew she'd never get that message. So I held out hope that somebody out there with the same problem, the same darkness, might find a tiny stupid spark of light in a game. That it might help them out of that hole, even for a little bit, because maybe for them it wouldn't be too late to put down the rope.  Â   Don't thank me. Let me thank you, because maybe all that grief and rage in front of a keyboard meant something. Maybe I actually helped somebody. Maybe this stupid shit that I do and release for people to tear apart has had a fraction of meaning greater than 10 minutes amusement.  Thank you."

I walked past a college friend of my mine years ago, without saying ""hi"", or even acknowledging his existence because he looked like he was lost in his own inner world, and wanted to be left alone. He hung himself within a few weeks of that. I always wonder if it was my fault. He asked me to hang out a few times, and I turned him down. He had bipolar disorder.   Your friend will never experience this game, but knowing the statistics on bipolar disorder, I can promise you that many others were touched by it, and will continue to be touched by it over time. The things the orc's say make this game what it is. You had a much bigger impact on how players feel about the game than maybe even you realize.    That 10 minutes of amusement? You can multiply it by every copy of this game that was sold. That's the definition of significant.  I wouldn't play that down."

Run in the middle of fights to nearest herb and heal yourself ( this alone has kept me alive through huge fights with multiple mobs and captains). Don't rush into a captain battle head on without finding out the weaknesses. And then use those weaknesses.  Ride caragors.

shadowofmordor,36crwb,OrbitalFoxtrot,5,Mon May 18 10:17:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, you will be able to change to Celebrimbor's skin at any point during the campaign :) Keep in mind that you'll still be Talion in all cinematic cutscenes though and that in the two DLC campaigns you are forced to use only the corresponding skins, but the main storyline lets you choose one."
shadowofmordor,36crwb,mirkwoodfalcon,5,Mon May 18 11:17:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help! At least it will make more sense than playing as Lithariel with a gruff ranger voice during in-game dialogue..
shadowofmordor,36crwb,mirkwoodfalcon,4,Mon May 18 11:20:26 2015 UTC,"Funny story about that, when they first released the Lithariel skin, they didn't remove the in-game grunting noises when Talion gets hit so she sounded pretty weird. I think they have since silenced Lithariel's skin, lol"

shadowofmordor,36awkv,Winterbirth,1 point,Mon May 18 07:47:28 2015 UTC,to be that guy or not to be that guy.... those arent lag spikes lag doesnt occur in a single player game. lag is the latency between a client and a server.if possible id run task manager in the back ground to see what kind of cpu useage youre getting after a death and also one for normal gameplay for a baseline. my guess is its more cpu then gpu.
shadowofmordor,36awkv,steakatwork,0,Mon May 18 00:42:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry gotta be that guy...  Lag - fall behind in movement, progress, or development; not keep pace with another or others. Your system can ""lag"" without it being related to the network"

Meaning if they wanted to include her voice they'd have to book studio time and rerecord the entire game (in regard to the main character's lines). The story wouldn't make sense if the words were coming out of her mouth since she's a different character entirely. What would happen during the scenes that would have two of her? Hahaha"
shadowofmordor,365q57,TheSilentHedges,1 point,Sat May 16 19:56:57 2015 UTC,I got the whole game + season pass and just finished the main campaign and the end is weak but for me the story isn't over untill I do all the dlc's main quests.  Right now I'm doing the challenges and it's a blast. It makes you forget the main story right away. There's still lots of fun to be had in this game.

shadowofmordor,364esh,Barbarian0057,2,Sat May 16 01:43:18 2015 UTC,I think it can go both ways. They either have hatred or become traumatized by being killed. The trauma could then decrease their chance or strength of brand resistance.
shadowofmordor,364esh,lostinsurburbia,1 point,Sat May 16 01:46:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe even an expansion on that is that they have a reshuffle of strengths.

shadowofmordor,364esh,Valtyr1988,2,Sat May 16 03:29:33 2015 UTC,"I would like to see more distinction between the tiers of Orc Captains - as an Uruk goes higher up, they should get more and more powerful. I think there should be caps on the Power that an Uruk can obtain at a specific tier. So, for example, Tier 1 (the bottom row) can only get to Power 10; Tier 2, Power 15; Tier 3, Power 20. This would (I believe) help you feel like you are working your way up the hierarchy towards the Warchiefs.  I also like the idea of giving them different abilities - I think they have expanded on this with the Hunt DLC, but I have not tried it so cannot comment."
shadowofmordor,364esh,tasmus11,1 point,Sat May 16 12:00:49 2015 UTC,"I had a brainstorm yesterday about possible additions to the Nemesis System (because let's face it there's gonna be a sequel) and my favorite one was adding water to the game and then giving some uruks the ability to commandeer their own flagships. They would behave in the same way that the uruks do and would be generated via the Nemesis System, so they would have their own strengths and weaknesses,"
shadowofmordor,3640nx,SasserMaster,2,Fri May 15 22:50:36 2015 UTC,"If you want a better Sauron fight, they acknowledged the fans' complaints and made an epic one for the Bright Lord DLC.

shadowofmordor,3640nx,glados131,1 point,Fri May 15 22:55:41 2015 UTC,Just finished the main story myself yesterday. I agree that the end of the game seemed to come to a halt rather abruptly.  Other than that an overall excellent game. I was equally shocked when my nemesis reared his ugly face again in the end. I thought for sure I put him in the dirt for the last time previously.

shadowofmordor,35mv17,Curtastrophy,1 point,Tue May 12 21:21:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I came on here to address this and thankfully you already made a post about it.  I've killed all the yellow dotted guys that wont support the warchief, but there are usually 3-4 uruks that aren't a part of it and they are the ones that will be ""turned"" when the marked yellows do get killed.  It seems that if you become noticed and murder them, then there's no one to follow your captain, which means the event hangs indefinitely. I'm so tired of this issue that I just turn off the PS4 as soon as it happens. On rare occasion it works out flawlessly even if I murder all the uruks not with my captain, but this event is bugged to hell IMO.  Stay in a safe position far away, preferably on high and try to run and hide if you're seen. Always snipe the yellow dotted uruks in the back or ones that aren't visible by other uruks. Let your captain finish off the last yellow dotted uruk and it should move forward. It's just tedious and annoying."
shadowofmordor,35mv17,Curtastrophy,1 point,Tue May 12 21:18:49 2015 UTC,"Wow. Well no pressure there. Although I did find that instead of turning of your PS4 you can just dismiss your captain and I don't think it counts as fleeing, and doesn't advance time..."

shadowofmordor,35k39f,Something_Syck,1 point,Mon May 11 18:01:15 2015 UTC,"If you watch the trailer its pretty clear they are using the Nemesis system, or at least a form of it. When they talk about the warlords, and weakening them to eventually take them down.  Its not the same dev team, but its being published by WB, and I'm betting they own the engine used in SOM since it appeared to be a repurposed/tweaked version of the Batman engine.  I'm obviously making some assumptions here, but I think they are pretty safe assumptions to make."

I don't want to spoil anything, but you'll soon see him disappear from the leaderboard :)     Secondly, I hear there's a way to actually pick a random Uruk and raise him through the ranks..      That happens in the second half of the game. The campaign isn't too long, so you'll likely be doing this soon.     Thirdly, when is a captain actually considered dead?      I believe there's always a chance for any warchief killed to return. The only way to make sure they DON'T return is to kill them by removing the head (by way of a combo move).     Fourthly, can Warchiefs revive themselves?     Some later high-level chiefs can do this mid-battle, if that's what you mean.     Fifthly, can captains eventually promote into Warchiefs?     There needs to be an open spot at the top! If you know for sure a captain is hoping to make gain, you can keep thinning out the ranks above him to give him a hand in that.     Sixthly, is there any way I can befriend more Orcs or Uruks like I did with Ratbag in the beginning?     See my reply to number 2 :)"

shadowofmordor,353j6x,glados131,2,Wed May 6 21:08:03 2015 UTC,"My advice, which might seem odd at first, is: Try not to die, but hope you fail. Strange, I know, but the cool thing about the Nemesis system is that if there's an orc you die to over and over again, it generates real hate of that orc.  The feeling of finally killing that captain gives you an amazing sense of catharsis.  Also, I'd be careful not to get too many skills, as you can get swiftly overpowered.  This might sound good at first, but it can get to the point where you just can't die and you'll never have another nemesis."
shadowofmordor,353j6x,Kyakan,2,Thu May 7 00:52:45 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend putting a priority on watching for when you should counter and dodge over putting out damage; staying alive in a fight is a lot easier if you're willing to turn bigger fights into battles of attrition. Theoretically, if you're good with dodging arrows, you can avoid all damage the orcs can deal even when in massive groups because of it. Make use of that fact."
shadowofmordor,354cda,some1stoleit,2,Thu May 7 00:18:12 2015 UTC,"The special abilities are pretty good, as they give you about 20 seconds of unlimited insta-kill maneuvers (executions for melee, fire arrows for ranged, stealth kills for stealth).  If you don't want to get overpowered, though, you might want to avoid getting them altogether, as they can become a bit too useful and undercut the nemesis system a bit."
shadowofmordor,354cda,glados131,1 point,Thu May 7 00:54:48 2015 UTC,"To be honest i'd also recommend not getting the Special Weapons Abilities but for a totally different reason: There's not much use for them.  Once you get the hang of the combat you even forget you have them(happened to me at least, barely used each of them 2 or 3 times the whole time i played).  I'd focus on Elf Shot/Focus since i found those way more useful, but if you really want to get a weapon ability i'd either recommend the Sword one, for obvious reasons, or the Bow one since then you have easy access to Fire that some Warchiefs are vulnerable to."
shadowofmordor,34ye45,KyleVoakes,6,Tue May 5 16:17:46 2015 UTC,"In all my many, countless hours spent in Mordor, I don't think I've ever seen that happen. Well done!"

There were so many moments when he killed a captain and some random Uruk came sailing down off a ledge, after which he just lost it xD"

shadowofmordor,34ye45,MonolithAndy,2,Thu May 7 17:48:23 2015 UTC,"Go to the playlist and find ""The Jaw Dropping Nemesis"" for, bar none, the single best nemesis ever generated by the system.  Nothing will top Prak Jaws, ever."

shadowofmordor,34zd0z,jrlionheart00,3,Tue May 5 20:36:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, to be clear, Save files and Achievements/Trophies don't share between the base version of Shadow of Mordor, and the GOTY Edition. (We've got a MOTD live now for console players to inform them as well.)  Our thought is this: If you want to spend the time playing through what is, for all intents and purposes, a different version of the game, you should absolutely have the opportunity to get those trophies."
shadowofmordor,34zd0z,MonolithAndy,2,Tue May 5 21:21:11 2015 UTC,Are there any version differences in the GOTY edition compared to the normal edition with the season pass?
shadowofmordor,34zd0z,stealthcl0wn,4,Tue May 5 23:48:54 2015 UTC,"Nope. Either way, that'll give you access to everything we've released for Shadow of Mordor."
shadowofmordor,34zd0z,MonolithAndy,2,Wed May 6 17:45:56 2015 UTC,"Kudos for not putting ""two new maps/challenge modes/widgets"" in the GOTY edition to try to have everyone re-buy it..."
shadowofmordor,34zd0z,Rouxmire,1 point,Wed May 6 20:17:56 2015 UTC,"Wow. I was actually going to re-buy the game (already own the game and all DLC on xb1) but this changes my mind entirely. That seems like such a strange choice, given the game was released only 7 or so months ago. That really bums me out. =\"
shadowofmordor,34zd0z,Callisto34,1 point,Wed May 6 02:08:44 2015 UTC,"Well, if you've already got all the DLC and the game on XB1, you've got everything that you'd get out of the GOTY Edition, if that's any solace.  But, how come it bums you out, if you don't mind my asking?"
shadowofmordor,34zd0z,MonolithAndy,2,Wed May 6 17:47:10 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the game, I wanted to continue to show my support as it was one of my favorite games that came out last year. I like spending time playing it, even if I've already beat it several times, gotten all the achievements, etc. Games like the Tomb Raider reboot make sense to have a different set of achievements, and no save crossover because the two version were on two different console generations. I don't mind playing back through to grind through all the collection achievements because the game is actually substantially different.  There is no difference between owning the base game + DLC vs. the GOTY edition, like you said, so why is it considered a ""different game"" for purposes of save crossover and achievements? I'm sure I am in the minority on this, but having ""Shadow of Mordor"" and then ""Shadow of Mordor: GOTY Edition"" on my achievement list would just look silly.    I like collecting and perfecting games I really enjoy, but it really does just seem silly."
shadowofmordor,34zd0z,Callisto34,1 point,Wed May 6 18:15:48 2015 UTC,"I can see why you'd say that, but from our perspective, it comes down to making sure that a player is rewarded for their time spent in-game.   So, while I totally get why you're just not a fan of cluttering up your played game list, we thought of it from this approach: The GOTY Edition of Mordor was a chance for anyone that'd still been on the fence to get a killer combination of Shadow of Mordor in its entirety, and at an even better price. And, if anyone wanted to play through again (or if there's someone that shares an account with a loved one, friend, or child), then they'd be properly rewarded for it. They spend the time doing Rise and Fall once more, they get rewarded for it."
shadowofmordor,34zd0z,MonolithAndy,1 point,Wed May 6 22:06:00 2015 UTC,"To play devil's advocate to that idea:   Maybe they had the original game, sold it back, and are looking to get back into the game now that the GOTY is out (meaning, I assume, that all DLC planned for the game is out), they have to re-buy the original and all the DLC instead of the GOTY because the saves don't transfer. Effectively making them spend more money if they don't want to start all over. I'd wager that is the most likely scenario this console generation."
shadowofmordor,34zd0z,Callisto34,1 point,Thu May 7 01:24:28 2015 UTC,"With that example, again, I can see where you're coming from. Believe me, the goal wasn't to prevent anyone from enjoying their previous save that might be in that situation. (And, if they are, the original version of the game is likely cheaper than the GOTY at this point. Scoop it up!)  But, we always aim to make sure the time spent in Mordor is worthwhile. We're not taking away any save files, or any trophies, we're only adding more on there for those that want it. We hope those that do dive in enjoy themselves!"
shadowofmordor,34zd0z,MonolithAndy,1 point,Thu May 7 01:45:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining the decision to have separate trophy lists. Can I ask why save files aren't compatible?  I'm currently playing through the regular edition (got it 2 weeks ago - having a blast) and would've like to trade it back in for the GOTY edition to finish up the DLC/trophies, so personally, it was disappointing to hear saves and trophies would be separate."
shadowofmordor,34zd0z,mekktor,2,Thu May 7 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"Well, with save files and trophies/achievements, it's an all or nothing deal. There's a lot of annoying stuff, both for us and for you, that can possibly happen if we take one and not the other."

shadowofmordor,34tttt,MonolithAndy,7,Mon May 4 20:03:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the reply! Whilst trying to achieve Rise and Fall, the game turned like a movie for me and I actually felt like I was part of something.  There was a point when I had a dominated Captain to murder my killer, but of course I had to kill my minion. But things got out of hand and my barely-alive killer was fleeing but my Captain won't stop following him. So I range-killed all his followers and shadow grabbed him and the two of us watched my killer run away. It was awesome!  I don't have 100% achievements like the other dudes as I don't have the DLCs, but I will surely buy them in the near future.  Once again, thanks to you and the whole team for this game."
shadowofmordor,34tttt,MonolithAndy,3,Tue May 5 16:15:15 2015 UTC,"Reading that story has got to be the highlight of my day. I'm glad you had a good time, and it sounds like that Captain earned his death!  100% achievements come in time. And, out of curiosity, what platform are you playing on?"
shadowofmordor,34tttt,MonolithAndy,1 point,Tue May 5 18:20:18 2015 UTC,Yeah he definitely did earn his death. :) He was a Berserker Uruk when he killed me and I let him grow too powerful.

shadowofmordor,34rx3m,Ranzok,2,Mon May 4 13:08:31 2015 UTC,I would have liked a hardcore mode too. But with the nemesis system it is actually important to die and makes it more fun. I didn't die until about 12 hours of gameplay. Once I died I realized the strength of the game.  I wish they would become nems if you fled

shadowofmordor,34i56n,JL235,3,Fri May 1 10:36:41 2015 UTC,Get a better graphics card. That is literally the only tweak you can do at this point.
shadowofmordor,34i56n,stealthcl0wn,1 point,Fri May 1 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"It's really interesting to see performance reports like these, since I played through the game on my old laptop without a hitch at well over 30 FPS the entire time. It had nothing more than integrated graphics as well."
shadowofmordor,34i56n,Ninjaspar10,1 point,Sat May 2 22:00:29 2015 UTC,My main PC actually uses a Geforce 9800GT. Even though it's really old as long as I have anti-aliasing off and there isn't silly amounts of post-processing then most games actually run pretty well at 1920x1080. Everything I play on that machine certainly looks and run betters than Shadow of Mordor is on the 430.  However the 9800 doesn't support DX11 and so the game refuses to boot. You can force it to work but then DX uses the software renderer for the missing features. The resulting fps is literally less than 1fps.  It's annoying because plenty of other companies allow you to disable all this stuff so you can get good performance. You could even run HL 2 on Vodoo graphics cards.
shadowofmordor,34i56n,Ninjaspar10,1 point,Sun May 3 02:16:01 2015 UTC,Now that is a shame. Maybe there's a way to force the game to use DX10 like Saints Row did? I'm at the limits of my expertise here I'm afraid.
shadowofmordor,34fzxn,glados131,2,Thu Apr 30 20:51:59 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue, the guy's corpse was on the board top tier (not warchief) for 2 weeks, through several time advancements, and I didn't find him anywhere.   Turns out he was still alive, but had this weird habit of running to and hanging around to the extreme northeastern part of Sea of Nurnen - the cliff area where you can cross over to the Maw of Hope fortress.   I only managed to find him because he had the 'ambusher' trait and showed up when I was fighting another captain in the general area. But after that, he started ambushing me every time I attacked another captain at a feast, hunt, etc."
shadowofmordor,34fzxn,Raventree,2,Fri May 1 01:08:35 2015 UTC,Hmm.  Hopefully I'll be able to track him down-- don't think he has the Ambusher trait.  And he killed a captain I found very entertaining.
shadowofmordor,34fzxn,Stormageddon222,1 point,Fri May 1 02:41:50 2015 UTC,"That's what's going on! I had no idea why no orc was taking that spot. Looks like I have a dead orc to hunt.

shadowofmordor,34e7uw,sharpsh007er,7,Thu Apr 30 12:49:49 2015 UTC,"Use the map to fast travel to a tower and use advance time. Most of the dead spots will be filled by promoted or new Orc captains.  There are a few times when this does not happen, in that case you have to play one or more of the main (gold) missions for the system to advance further."
shadowofmordor,34e7uw,hovercraft_of_eels,3,Thu Apr 30 13:05:29 2015 UTC,"i finished the main missions. and i used that ""advance time"" and still some spots don't fill up :/"

I don't know what causes the game to lock up like that, but one of those tactics should work. I have one spot permanently occupied by a dead (not decapitated) Orc, the rest filled up after some skipping and travelling back and forth."
shadowofmordor,34e7uw,marshdabeachy,4,Thu Apr 30 14:31:52 2015 UTC,If there's a body in that spot (not a head) it could also be that orc actually is still alive and you haven't run into him again yet.
shadowofmordor,34e7uw,Kyakan,3,Thu Apr 30 14:48:59 2015 UTC,You can use the advance time feature or just die to a bunch of random orcs in order to fill up those slots.
shadowofmordor,34e7uw,aaruni96,2,Thu Apr 30 14:01:08 2015 UTC,"yes but the ""new"" orcs don't fill up empty spaces in the 3rd row, they duel with the first row or occupy an empty space from the first row. I'm having problems filling the rows further back"

shadowofmordor,34e7uw,piitza,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:04:39 2015 UTC,"There is a progression, which is what is causing this to happen.  New orcs will always do one of two things: take the space of a dead uruk, or duel someone in the first row. The second and third rows work exactly the same. Warchiefs will nearly always be duels.   If you wait enough time, all gaps will fill up, but you may have to skip time a lot to have this happen if you stay on the same map. The easiest method by far is to travel to the other map, wait a while, and then travel back. The entire board should be full, and you can then go about capturing everyone."
shadowofmordor,34e7uw,justforthissong,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:10:43 2015 UTC,"so you get the new orc. you have to help him move up. There are duel missions or whatever and you just help him win, and he will be promoted.   I think thats how its done, i'm going to attempt the trophy for letting an orc kill you to become captain, then help him up to warchief and kill him.  I also think that each row is a tier they move up, but im not sure."

I ended up stacking all the health returns on branding in and out of combat, and it made me pretty much unkillable. Vaulting over enemies to be able to take them out one at a time, rushing up walls, then stealth brand for health back... There are lots of things you can do to make fights easier for you.   If all else fails, there's always getting a graug over to bite off their heads."
shadowofmordor,34aibg,TheLadyNuala,2,Sun May 3 03:01:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't completed this game yet. Just got it last week but I am deeply in love with it.   My advice is to get Intel on your target, that's key to defeating any War Chief or Captain. If you're going after a War Chief, kill their body guards first. You can see their linkage in the Sauron's Army screen.  Play their weaknesses, after you get the Intel on them you know what they are weak to. And also what their strengths are. So you're more informed on what to do and not to do.   Track your target and before you engage. Scout your target and area. Make sure you know what you're dealing with. Use the wrath vision to mark your target and check if they are any other Captain's around the area which can be a problem. Check to see what kind of escort gang they have to know what you're dealing with. Pick off defenders and berserkers before dropping in if you can.  Get into big fights and kill everything in sight. This helps build your combat skills so much. I usually drop in on big groups and try to not be hit once or lose my streak. Practice makes perfect.   I've only died twice in the 30+ hours I put into it. It is easy once you figure out the combat system and weaknesses. Have fun!"
shadowofmordor,34aibg,iron_mike_,2,Wed Apr 29 17:35:08 2015 UTC,"Great advice in general. I'd add this:  Complete the main story missions until you've completed the Ratbag storyline at least.  Once you unlock branding, you have unlocked the real game."
shadowofmordor,34aibg,hovercraft_of_eels,2,Thu Apr 30 14:29:39 2015 UTC,"I felt the same for the first 15 hours or so. There are some buyable abilities that make it way easier, notably Wraith Stun, Vault Stun, Blade Master and Resilience (Wraith Finisher is pretty helpful too). Story wise once you get Brand it gets really easy.   Until you get enough power to get most or all of those fighting really big groups will just get you killed. So you have to rely on tactics and sneakiness. Which ironically start becoming second nature to you later in the game."

I found all the collectibles and such (that could be collected), before reaching 50% of the story.  Makes everything so much easier in the long run, Plus all the side missions give you currency to buy the upgrades which do nothing but make the game more fun.  you're 15 hours in you probably have a good grasp on how long it takes and the distance orcs/uruks spot you. The missions aren't difficult if you use the environment well. I always did the bonus objectives up until I bought everything (theres no need at that point i think)."

shadowofmordor,347rkn,danblanchet,2,Tue Apr 28 23:46:35 2015 UTC,"Turn off all anti-aliasing, reduce in game resolution, windowed mode, turn down texture quality... just go into graphics options and turn everything down. Hard to say without knowing what gpu you have. RAM is not an indication of how powerful your card is."
shadowofmordor,347ptv,astralvortex,3,Tue Apr 28 23:32:17 2015 UTC,"Those are actually very different for different purposes.  Sylvan Arrow allows you to recover Focus while using Focus to headshot enemies. This, especially with Ascendant to reduce Focus depletion, lets you focus headshot using all of your Elfshot and still have Focus left over. Mount up, add some Nature's Wrath to recover Elf Shot on mounted kills, and you are unstoppable. Or, add Forge of War or Reckless Hate to your dagger to get Elf Shot on brands, shadow strike in to close the distance, and brand to recover Elf Shot instead.  This approach works regardless of stealth as well. Got full Focus and Elf Shot in the middle of a stronghold? No problem!  Don't forget that you can also stack two Sylvan Arrow* to get the chance very high. This is very powerful for many runes.  Keen Eyed is for a different playstyle where you are remaining in stealth but using bow shots and Focus for short bursts, and abandon using the bow when you run out of focus or lose stealth.  Unbreakable Bond or Wind Rider split the difference by allowing you to recover % Focus without stealth, but force you to pin in place or lose your distance. Wind Rider is great With Knight of Eregion.  You can also use Rule Through Fear as a different style to recover Focus on stealth kills by following a pattern like strike hard with bow and combat, hide, and then strike again OR are killing from stealth both at range and then also melee. Focus recovers on its own between combat, so recovering it from a stealth kill is only useful if you use stealth soon after using Focus, and then want to use Focus again. This also works well if you also use other runes around stealth or brutalize kills.  So, both runes are actually quite good, depending on the effect you want to achieve and the other runes you have for synergy or stacking."

At times you actually get the feeling of commanding an entire army against Sauron's Orcs, which is amazing.  Just keep in mind you are playing as Celebrimbor, not Thalion, and he works really different in combat. You are more fragile and don't have the slow-down focus on your bow so you have to learn to fight differently, but once you get a feel for how the character works it really becomes fun and you really wish there was more to it when you reach the end.  The last boss battle definitely makes up for SoM's weak 'press buttons in sequence to win' ending."

shadowofmordor,33u7hp,BoozeDelivery,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:02:46 2015 UTC,There is no way you were running the Ultra textures on that setup.
shadowofmordor,33u7hp,FvHound,0,Sun Apr 26 01:15:16 2015 UTC,Why?  This game is really well optimized. That isn't a deflective statement it's a true one.  I also have 12gb ram if that changes anything. But no for serious shadow of mordor ran plus 50fps on highest settings.
shadowofmordor,33u7hp,BoozeDelivery,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:00:15 2015 UTC,"You need at least a 4gb card to run the HD textures. I tried running them on my 770 2gb and it wasn't having it. Now my gtx970 runs them fine. Also, ultra is the same as high if you don't specifically download the HD texture pack."
shadowofmordor,33u7hp,FvHound,-1,Sun Apr 26 02:15:10 2015 UTC,"You didn't upgrade your Cpu as well when you got a new card?  I would've guessed a bottleneck in your previous system, but if you only had a gpu upgrade then I really don't know what to say.  I've searched online and seen threads of other people with mid tier cards running everything on ultra.  Shadow of mordor is not a demanding game that requires a 970; minimal particle effects, render distance far, but again not a lot of dynamic objects to render.  And again.. it's just the most beautifully optimized game I've seen on pc in a long time. I really don't understand how you had these issues."
shadowofmordor,33u7hp,BoozeDelivery,3,Sun Apr 26 02:25:29 2015 UTC,"I had already upgraded the system. The gpu was my bottleneck. Once again, the Ultra HD textures are a separate download that you have to specifically select otherwise ultra is the same as high textures."
shadowofmordor,33u7hp,FvHound,-3,Sun Apr 26 02:33:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know because I recall downloading it anyway despite articles citing there didn't seem to be much visual difference compared to the size of the download. I'm afraid I don't have an answer here."
shadowofmordor,33u7hp,BoozeDelivery,4,Sun Apr 26 03:14:27 2015 UTC,"I do. You aren't running the HD textures on that setup. Now, you are probably running everything on medium/high to high as it is well optimized but you aren't running the HD textures.   The HD ultra texture pack is listed under the DLC in Steam. That is where you have the click the checkbox to install the textures.  I'm not trying to be rude or argue for the sake of arguing so please don't take any of this discussion that way. I've just seen many, many setups similar to yours or even better that won't run the HD textures. It just isn't possible to do and keep 60 fps on a setup like that. Unless maybe you're playing at 800x600 but we all know nobody would do that lol."
shadowofmordor,33u7hp,FvHound,-4,Sun Apr 26 03:24:35 2015 UTC,"Your persistence doesn't change anything.  I'm not going to try and convince you, Obviously you are disregarding everything I've said so there's no point having a discussion about it."

Now I have 100%ed the game both by my own and by the games standard but I have never used these slaves to kill a captain. Now the other meaning is major spoilers and is rather set arched from the original meaning but is possible. However they are also likely inaccessible to a new player. I highly recommend stealth kills in all early game encounters, especially since the first thing that captains become unanimously immune to will be stealth"

That might be a clever bit of code on Monolith's side though which recognises my preference for stealth and combats it. Out of interest, do you prefer ranged combat?"
shadowofmordor,33icwt,Ninjaspar10,2,Thu Apr 23 20:51:26 2015 UTC,"I actually like to stealth kill a few, then get caught and start massacring everything. I can confirm that stealth weak captains still exist post campaign."

shadowofmordor,332nd3,piknim,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:50:22 2015 UTC,hasnt it got to be done in 1 sitting?  i've done this btw on my 4th serious attempt (i did a few were i gave up after 10 mins)... my next go after i posted the original post i did in 1 hour and 16 secs! Ended up doing it in 56 mins.  Gone on to do 40 min one which is my last one i need to get 100% have only played it as a test to get a feel of it and not done a serious attempt.
shadowofmordor,332nd3,piknim,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:19:39 2015 UTC,It auto saves after every captain and or warchief kill. You can abuse save/reload depending on what platform you are using to make this easier

shadowofmordor,32i151,Traveledfarwestward,5,Mon Apr 13 23:26:12 2015 UTC,"I too, am a PC player, and I finished the game on the default controls on kb+mouse. The controls aren't too tough to get used to. All you have to understand is that the controls can be context sensitive. For eg : Right click is for bow mode. But if you are in stealth, short press on right click will do brutalize (if you have unlocked it yet). Similarly, short press ""E"" is stun, but long press ""E"" is drain. ""ctrl"" is grab, but ""ctrl"" near use-able things is the ""use"" key. (Press ctrl to collect herb, etc).  To move around is very easy. Use W,A,S,D to walk in that direction, relative to the camera. Long press ""space"" if you want to sprint (unlimited stamina). Short press ""space"" if you want to jump in the direction you are currently facing. Move the mouse to pivot the camera around your player model.  When it comes to combat, left click to strike, right click to block (when not in stealth mode). In stealth mode, you can left click when you see an Uruk with a red outline for a stealth kill, or right click to brutalize (if you have the skill unlocked). In bow mode, you should long press left click to charge your bow, and then release when the bow is completely charged.  Uruks which are stunned, but haven't fallen yet : strike them again to make them fall. When an uruk is fallen, you can finish him off with left shift + left click. If you have other uruks who try to hit you while you are performing the fatal strike, you can press right click to block. It will terminate your animation at once. The stunned Uruk will survive, but you will avoid a hit.  Yes, there is a point to collecting herbs if you're not wounded. Its the survival challenge in game. Each time you complete a tier of survival challenges, you get some in-game money, and a list of herbs to be collected for the next tier."
shadowofmordor,32i151,aaruni96,-5,Fri Apr 17 12:17:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you, gave up on it for now, as soon as Gollum was shoe-horned into the story, all the graphical flaws and little console-port leftover things just became too much. Trying Dark Souls now."

shadowofmordor,32f38t,halfbulletproof,6,Thu Apr 16 03:54:57 2015 UTC,"Well, if you advance time a bunch, then the roster refills, that or you go to the other map and kill everyone there, then by the time you go to the other map, the captains and warchiefs will be back and at a decent strength."

Lord of the Hunt and The Bright Lord took me about 10 hours (I think, not exactly sure) and I'm still working on the Trials of War which provide a skill-demanding but still fun challenge.  Trial of Wisdom is very difficult in my opinion. I can kill all the Captains and Warchiefs no problem but I can't get the score to 22000."

OP, are you saying you did the entire campaign and got all collectables in 25 hours? I hate the be an ass but... that smells like some serious BS unless you just blitzed the game just for 100%."

shadowofmordor,31v3o9,morphinapg,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"No I got 100% in the original campaign in 25 hours; this is the twenty story missions, sword, bow and dagger legends, outcast missions and collect the 32 runes and artifacts. When you are going through the missions, pick up the runes and artifacts that you run into as I picked up many of them while battling Warchiefs and Captains. The Outcasts missions can be done quickly if you use the wraith speed ability and quickly cut the slaves loose. I also used the fast-travel to tower quite a bit and did not really fail any missions more than once (Apart from one dagger legend in where you have to keep hidden and release Ghuls, failed that about 5 times).  I do feel that I did blitz through it but I did enjoy it greatly when playing. The original campaign can be completed in 25 hours but you have to plan well when playing it. Your making me wish I took a picture of the 100% when I finished it.  EDIT-I still have achievements to complete in the original campaign, Trials of War and the two DLCs so still quite a bit for me to do before I reach full 100% completion."
shadowofmordor,31v3o9,VeganMonkey,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:55:08 2015 UTC,Ok I think I was confusing the 100% requirements with achievement requirements.

I would have liked to see a few missions where you could travel to other areas of Middle Earth, because even though Mordor is beautifully designed it would be nice to have a variety of scenery even if it was just for one mission. Haven't finished the game yet, looking forward to play the yellow and red marked missions."
shadowofmordor,31v3o9,stefoske,2,Wed Apr 8 17:31:43 2015 UTC,I wish I could move it as much as you but I got bored after unlocking all the powers. Took me like 5 hours :(

The dlc is terrible in terms of new content.  I enjoyed my initial run through, but as with every open world game lately, padding with unlocking towers and collecting pointless stuff... And the game needed more enemies, ones who were actual characters for bosses."
shadowofmordor,31v3o9,ncarson9,4,Wed Apr 8 13:03:16 2015 UTC,The game actually rewarded collection by dishing out lore info.

shadowofmordor,31qaxr,drunodrundridge,2,Tue Apr 7 10:06:40 2015 UTC,This. All of the warchiefs/captains at the time will be snapshotted and keep their place until they're dead. You can't promote him while you're on that quest but if I remember correctly he will be promotable after the mission (Branding them is an alternative to killing them). So kill all of the other targets and he should be good to go :)
shadowofmordor,31qaxr,Kawdie,2,Tue Apr 7 10:13:23 2015 UTC,Thanks man! i killed the rest of the warcheifs and he was promoted.
shadowofmordor,31qaxr,Linen42,2,Tue Apr 7 10:52:52 2015 UTC,Now I'm just curious why you want to promote him.
shadowofmordor,31qaxr,Aled4192,2,Tue Apr 7 13:19:43 2015 UTC,oh im trying to get the lv 25 rune achievement man. that betch dropped and epic after all these hard work z

The save game file is ""gamedata.sav"" located where you installed steam at  \Steam\userdata(your Steam ID in a bunch of numbers)""\241930\remote  Just copying that one file should be enough.  You may want to temporarily disable steam cloud synch for her computer while transferring the save file.  p.s. In future if you wish to share this game, use Steam's Family Sharing feature and let the friend use his or her own Steam Account instead of both play on your account. This not only allows him to have his own save game, but also his own Steam Achievements separate from yours, and if he buys the game, they will all be already there."

shadowofmordor,31ju86,Traveledfarwestward,8,Mon Apr 6 01:43:58 2015 UTC,sure  so eventually after progressing through the story you unlock this power that lets you take over orcs and you can also have them bodyguard a warchief. i made all my orcs bodyguard one chief after using the death threat skill to make them have high chance of dropping good runes when you kill them. then i killed them all when they were grouped together and grabbed all the runes
shadowofmordor,31lc5k,andrewofaiurz,5,Mon Apr 6 03:53:03 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm in the minority,  but my favorite part of SoM, is the lack of multiplayer.

shadowofmordor,31lc5k,Xanos_Malus,2,Wed Apr 8 06:15:23 2015 UTC,yeah i think they need something to put your personal godlike nature at end game to the test. Whether some kind of multiplayer pvp or a monster from the back story (feeling ungoliath) that can be done as a team. Also maybe some kind of valar intergration into story set more in the 1st/2nd age? What do you think?

shadowofmordor,31h5ii,Chronic_Apathy1,8,Sun Apr 5 01:05:42 2015 UTC,"The two largest expansions are standalone adventures, none of the new mechanics, runes, or features carry over into the main game. Overall they have gotten fairly poor reviews in that regard."
shadowofmordor,31h5ii,SigmaValentine,2,Sun Apr 5 04:23:17 2015 UTC,"The expansions are enjoyable, but both leave you wanting more, probably because like SigmaValentine said, they are stand alone and you can't use the new abilities in your normal save file.    The other features in the Season Pass include all skins, some are really cool like the Dark Ranger and the Black Hand.  You also get all of the challenge modes, I loved playing these for awhile and trying to get on the elite scoreboard.  The Endless challenge was the best, I also liked the one where you play using the Lithariel skin.  The runes you get with the season pass are kind of pointless, making the game too easy.   But to answer your question, you do get all current DLC with it. Expansions, runes, challenges, skins, a few extra small missions that actually do get added to the main game.  I think that's it.  For $25 it might be worth it, especially if you plan on doing some challenges and getting on the elite scoreboard, which for some challenges is really tough."
shadowofmordor,31h5ii,BumblerBurger,2,Sun Apr 5 15:03:35 2015 UTC,Shit i paid 35 when the game released....

I'm currently reinstalling the entire game because I suspect the game got ""stuck"" updating.   Anyone else experience this and resolve this problem?  Update: deleting the game data and reinstalling fixed the issue. I didn't have to delete my game save either."
shadowofmordor,31hjqz,illusionastic,3,Sun Apr 5 03:29:10 2015 UTC,Exploding arrow causes a lot of friendly fire; captains will often kill other captains or their underlings. By far more dangerous are combat immunities.
shadowofmordor,31hjqz,PargonIntensifies,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:39:11 2015 UTC,combat immunities give them protection against other uruks as well?
shadowofmordor,31e2uj,illusionastic,5,Sat Apr 4 04:40:57 2015 UTC,If you have the right move you can take the warchief to an area that only he is in (A.K.A the dominated orcs) then blow his head

shadowofmordor,315eff,ncarson9,20,Thu Apr 2 03:07:20 2015 UTC,"It did nothing to prevent piracy, so much as piracy enabled a purchase.   But I agree it helps a lot.   I used to pirate everything that wasn't multiplayer. I simply couldn't afford to buy every game that I wanted to play. I make no attempts at defending my actions. Sure, I could have just NOT played the games but I am after all a human.   These days thanks to steam and the sales I have over 330 games in my library and I almost exclusively purchase everything I play.

I for one found the first area to be pretty cool aesthetically. The second was my favorite however. That's not the nemesis system, that's just a scripted story line. The nemesis system is about captains that escape death when you thought you killed them. There is a lot to climb in the second area. Patience young padawan.  The hardest part is simply remembering what key combo does what. It's not like you actually have to press four buttons at any one point in time. GhÃ»ls are in the codex.

If SOM takes place when Sauron finishes rebuilding Barad Dur after The Hobbit, then it would be about 70 years before Ioreth the healer appears in LOTR.

Talion could whomp on a 20 power uruk at the start of the game (provided one existed) and the only problem would be the lack of handy skills to mitigate the uruks defenses.  Talion=badass

My gaming time doesn't happen often.  When I get a spare few minutes and want to kill some Orcs, I don't want to be greeted with, Okay, now you've got to wait a day and a half on your slow-as internet connection until download this extra crap for your game.  My wife is running into this with Dragon Age: Inquisition also.  She keeps trying to play it on her computer, but there is always an update.  So when she gets a free moment, she can't just dive right in and play.  It's rather annoying.  I understand the always online thing, but adding these required updates alienates and frustrates players with poor internet connections because they live in rural areas and casual gamers who still want to enjoy their games."

shadowofmordor,30d37w,Aleforge,10,Thu Mar 26 11:53:25 2015 UTC,How did you brand on the first map? I thought that ability only got unlocked when you get to the second map....
shadowofmordor,30d37w,Subver5ion,4,Thu Mar 26 13:48:50 2015 UTC,Agreed.
shadowofmordor,30d37w,josephdevon,3,Thu Mar 26 14:04:00 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry I did go to the second map and unlock brand after talking to the old lady, then came back to finish up the things I missed. I didn't want to leave the first map without clearing everything up.   EDIT: Ok think I found out, there is a special quest to unlock the order option? I am guessing on the second map?"
shadowofmordor,30d37w,Parus_Major87,2,Thu Mar 26 18:53:56 2015 UTC,From what I understand captains and warchiefs in the first map don't have any bearing on endgame. You have to brand Uruk warchiefs in the second map to unlock the final mission. To give a branded captain orders you have to run up to them and dominate them then you will be given the option to give them orders.
shadowofmordor,30d37w,Parus_Major87,2,Thu Mar 26 13:45:15 2015 UTC,OK so I should not worry about even messing with the fist maps branded Uruks then. Any idea what the point was to even brand them? lol. I ran up to a few and dominated them but it seemed only to allow me to gather intel. Is these suppose to be a special selection for orders?
shadowofmordor,30d37w,Parus_Major87,2,Thu Mar 26 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"There's no actual point to branding the Uruks in the first map, other than using them for backup if you're farming epic runes (or just having fun causing chaos in Sauron's army).   If you go dominate an Uruk that you've already branded there should be an option that says ""command"" or something like that, although you may have to advance in the story to unlock the command function (http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/739522-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor/70215134). Some of the warchiefs in the second map can be difficult to brand, and it's easiest if you brand the warchiefs bodyguards and create a power struggle where your captain kills the warchief. I could be wrong, but this is my understanding of the purpose of branding. Hope this helps, man-filth."
shadowofmordor,30d37w,Voyager5555,2,Thu Mar 26 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"This helps a lot, I finally unlocked the ""command"" option last night. But I am glad you told me the first set is pretty much for fun. I have entire army branded. I wonder now if there is a way to threaten and increase epic rune chance and kill some off? I suppose I need to clear some room for new Uruks to step in?  So at the end do your branded warchiefs (second set) help out in the final battles or something?"

shadowofmordor,2zykof,ROFLM0NSTER,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:39:59 2015 UTC,It's a time based thing..... It's not about how powerful you are.
shadowofmordor,2zykof,ROFLM0NSTER,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:46:46 2015 UTC,How is it time based? I made 5 captains into bodyguards then I turned them on the warchief before I killed him. The more powerful you are the faster and easier it is to accomplish.

shadowofmordor,2zw1hy,hyperlite135,9,Sun Mar 22 08:58:00 2015 UTC,Play the very beginning of the game again.  It will help you understand it's a revenge plot. You are out to get revenge on the people that wronged you and your family.  Then it get more complected with the maker of the rings.
shadowofmordor,2zw1hy,ZappyKins,3,Sun Mar 22 09:03:39 2015 UTC,"I never really saw it as a revenge plot. For most of the game, Talion seemed to just want to get his curse lifted so that he could die and be with his family again. Celebrimbor was the one who was really pushing him to get revenge. It was only at the end that Talion decided to stay, and even then it wasn't so much about revenge as that he wanted to stop Sauron because he thought he would regret it if he didn't do anything while he had the chance."
shadowofmordor,2zw1hy,Timewinders,3,Tue Mar 24 22:01:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, true, he wants to be with his family again, but then why does he go after those 3 specific people?  The very ones that harmed his family?"
shadowofmordor,2zw1hy,ZappyKins,3,Wed Mar 25 01:11:38 2015 UTC,"I thought Talion wasn't trying to go after all three, just the Black Hand since he was the one who caused the curse and would know how to lift it. When Talion fought the Hammer at the end of the first half of the game, that was just an accident; he was trying to lure out the Black Hand by blowing up the statue, not the Hammer, but the Hammer showed up instead. Same when he fought the Tower; he was trying to attack the Black Hand, but the Black Hand happened to not be at the fortress at the time. Talion got revenge when it was easily available to him, killing the Hammer and the Tower when they were in front of him, but it didn't seem to me like revenge was his primary motivation, just a side goal at best. Remember that Talion was pretty much reluctant about pretty much everything he did throughout most of the game (like branding Uruks) aside from helping people. It was mainly Celebrimbor nagging him into doing it."
shadowofmordor,2zw1hy,Timewinders,2,Wed Mar 25 01:28:29 2015 UTC,It think it means its an awesome game if we can talk about these kinds of interpretations.   Can you imagine how it would be to have to share a body with someone you don't know and didn't choose like that?    Are you looking forward to a sequel?
shadowofmordor,2zw1hy,ZappyKins,2,Wed Mar 25 03:03:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one of the things I liked about the story was that it showed enough to keep things interesting while not explaining too much so that a lot is left up to interpretation. Like Talion hearing his son's voice before the final battle asking him why he's fighting. Body sharing is one of my favorite story premises. It's a great way to bring together two characters with radically different personalities and get them to interact and care about each other. It's a real shame that it's not used more often. The only other story I can recall that uses it is the anime Birdy the Mighty Decode. I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel, we need to see what happens with Talion trying to forge another ring. It can't lead to anything good, but it would still be cool to see."
shadowofmordor,2zw1hy,Timewinders,2,Wed Mar 25 03:36:29 2015 UTC,"Speaking of other games that do not explain too much, have you played Alan Wake?  There is a rumor we might get a remake for Xbox One."
shadowofmordor,2zw1hy,ZappyKins,2,Wed Mar 25 03:40:49 2015 UTC,"No, not yet, but I just got a 360 and will give it a shot. Haven't heard about a remake but I'll play it either way. What's your opinion on the story? I mainly play Japanese games so I haven't gotten around to it yet. Most Japanese games give you every detail about the story aside from the rare few like Nier/Drakengard, Kingdom Hearts, Folklore, Gravity Rush, and some Shin Megami Tensei games. As far as Western games go, Spec Ops: The Line also does a good job of it."
shadowofmordor,2zw1hy,Timewinders,2,Wed Mar 25 03:49:34 2015 UTC,I liked it alot.  Not to say it didn't frustrate me at time.  And can be confusing.

shadowofmordor,2zw4m3,PooPooKazew,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:19:37 2015 UTC,It manages pretty good. I think the bottleneck is my GPU.
shadowofmordor,2zw4m3,Skwared,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:24:43 2015 UTC,"Do you have 2 monitors or a method of tracking your temps where you can actively see them? I ask because I'm rocking an i5 4690k/780Ti and this game seems to push my system pretty hard. My GPU is the Evga SC edition and during Unigine gets to the mid70's on temp yet this game brings me to 80C sometimes. Perhaps it's a temp issue.   You can try MSI after burner if nothing else, it has a running graph for your GPU temp. You can just alt-tab out every now and then to see where your temps are.  Edit: your 7850 is pretty old and a lower end gaming GPU but it should still be stable even if your constant FPS is lower than some."

And it's remarkable how much he's changed with each death, it's at the point where he's got a rucksack with rope covering his head, he's completely lost almost all color to him, with some black tattoos now on his body. I can try to post a picture later if you'd like"

I've tried to kill the captains/bodyguards separately, but trying to lure them out so they're by them self seems to be impossible   Problem is, one has a crowbow, one has a long weapon and shiel and the other a regular weapon. So I'm either getting shot or hit with the long weapon."
shadowofmordor,2zk0br,Zaranthan,2,Thu Mar 19 11:23:33 2015 UTC,"If the bodyguards don't have Regeneration, you can hit-and-run them.

shadowofmordor,2zc2p7,drunodrundridge,6,Tue Mar 17 09:52:51 2015 UTC,"Pertaining to number seven, its almost always a good idea to shoot an arrow into fires if it is surrounded by uruks.  Even if you don't stick around to finish the tough ones off, its easy XP to grab in passing."
shadowofmordor,2zc2p7,mattinva,6,Tue Mar 17 14:48:33 2015 UTC,It's also always fun to do
shadowofmordor,2zc2p7,lumberzach316,5,Wed Mar 18 00:45:02 2015 UTC,"Here are a few I posted back when the game launched:   You can actually get cursory intel from ANY random mook on ANY captain. It won't tell you his weaknesses like the captains, worms, prisoners and dossiers will, but it will tell you his location, name and appearance, which can help in making sure you don't run into 5 of them at a time. Edit: This is not true of Warchiefs. Only captains can send death threats to them, and you can only get any intel on them from worms or captains. Use your surroundings. It will make the difference between life and death, especially later when the nastier kinds of enemies start showing up. Morgal fly hives, Caragors and their cages and bait, exploding and poisonable grog barrels, Elfshot caches and the like will show up with your Wraithsight (default V for PC). Use them to your advantage. Remember that enemies can still be stealth killed for a couple seconds after spotting you. The general rule of thumb is that you have until they draw their weapon to kill them. When a Captain's icon over his head turns from red to green, you can Grab and Interrogate, Drain or Shank him with no resistance. This can be very easily accomplished when they're afraid of something like burning or Caragors; when Terrified, they're instantly grabbable, and since Interrogation is an instant kill, you can get them easily. Always use Wraithsight right before you cause a ruckus. You want to make sure there is an acceptable (usually below 2) number of captains in the area, or else you may be overwhelmed. When applying Intel, a white arrow will appear above the heads of Captains who are near Talion.  When you have an enemy grabbed, you can drag him away from his buddies. Just hold the drag button and move. This is useful because Uruks will freak out when they find a body, and call for reinforcements. Also helpful if you're afraid someone will see you in the time it takes to drain him. Keep in mind also that you can Drain someone and then interrogate or shank them (if the drain doesn't kill them) without breaking your grip on them. Just keep the grab button held down. Don't be afraid to run away and fight another day. Orcs can't keep up with Talion, especially if he has the Elvish Grace feat (The one that makes you run faster when you go over an obstacle).  Caragors stay friendly when you dismount them. For a good time, release about 5 of them, mount, dominate and dismount each one. Then watch and laugh. Keep in mind that they'll attack orcs whether they're friendly to you or not... but it's good to make sure you won't get murdered when they're done.  Do not underestimate the first-tier upgrade that allows you to detonate campfires with Elfshot. It is incredibly effective, and does not alert enemies to your position.  USE THOSE WEAKNESSES. The weaknesses of the captains are an essential part of the game. Not only will you earn more Power for each weakness you exploit, you'll remove some of their strengths and make them much easier to kill cleanly.  Never start a fair fight. You're a Ranger, not a Spartan. Scout the area before you fight. See where the orcs are. See where environmental features are that you can use. Find a good fallback point. Observe where herbs and Elfshot caches are. The game rewards diversifying your attack strategies, so get used to using everything at your advantage. Unless something doesn't go according to plan, you should be able to kill every Orc and Uruk in a given situation without engaging more than 2 or 3 at a time (if that's your style)."
shadowofmordor,2zc2p7,TalShar,2,Wed Mar 18 02:36:50 2015 UTC,"Just a note on #6 and #10 this will only work if the captain/warchief is vulnerable to it, make sure to check strengths/weaknesses before attempting."
shadowofmordor,2zc2p7,Voyager5555,2,Tue Mar 17 14:51:00 2015 UTC,"Fire hurts. The captains weak to fire get scared when they are set ablaze. But even otherwise, fire hurts. (Except when they are enraged by fire. Then fire is bad.)."

shadowofmordor,2zc2p7,myr7,2,Tue Mar 17 21:22:58 2015 UTC,"Multiplicatively they stack.    There's a misconception that it's an additive stack.  Simply throwing on a few 50% runes will let you know this isn't true, as you still have failures, implying multiplicative stacking.    I ran 4 Lvl. 25+ River of Arrows (25% chance of gaining 1 elf shot per shot of the bow), and there were a few times where I didn't get an arrow for every shot.  The chance to not get an arrow would be closer to 1 - (.75.75.75*.75), or roundabout 99.6%.  At this point you're getting marginal returns, so it's best to stick with 2-3 stacked runes (98% chance of getting an arrow in this scenario) and throw a different rune in for good measure.   That's what I've fond anyway."
shadowofmordor,2zc2p7,jdfred06,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:48:19 2015 UTC,Thanks! Very helpful.    I think I stacked a couple that I thought were useful.
shadowofmordor,2zc2p7,myr7,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:36:49 2015 UTC,"They may stack, I just usually have a variety of runes and a 10% rune is easily replaced by at 12% rune.  Or if you already have a decent rune and then get a lesser variant, you can safely get rid of those (unless you want to stack them, I guess)."

shadowofmordor,2zb040,liamc99,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:43:38 2015 UTC,It is a 65 gb game so it may off taken a while based on your Internet speeds
shadowofmordor,2zb040,kevonicus,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:10:58 2015 UTC,I've read if you disconnect from the Internet and just let the disc install on its own it is a lot faster.
shadowofmordor,2zapod,ainerhpozihcs,6,Tue Mar 17 00:40:00 2015 UTC,It's very easy to max your character out. Just pick what you think you need the most when spending mirin
shadowofmordor,2zapod,btgf-btgf,3,Tue Mar 17 03:33:23 2015 UTC,"You get mirian for everything. Missions, sidequests, rune missions, finding ithildin, survival challenge, hunting challenge.  In short, when spending miriam, buy the ability you require immediately."
shadowofmordor,2zapod,aaruni96,2,Wed Mar 18 14:58:56 2015 UTC,"Easy to max out, you can always just run around and get more if you're running low."
shadowofmordor,2z6tz1,rusticmoose,7,Mon Mar 16 02:13:09 2015 UTC,"This is a new power up for each weapon.  In your case, you have it for the sword.  To activate it (depending on if you have it for console or not) you can click both of the sticks in and it will give you an ability for the weapon equipped. For the sword, its unlimited executions for a limited time. For the dagger, I believe it slows time and allows for unlimited stealth kills/brands for a limited time. For the bow, its unlimited arrows, focus, and fire arrows for a limited time."
shadowofmordor,2z6tz1,Wemie1420,2,Mon Mar 16 03:11:10 2015 UTC,Thank you! Works awesomely

shadowofmordor,2ywdxh,MonolithAndy,6,Fri Mar 13 12:14:25 2015 UTC,Just in case you were on the hunt for the patch notes for this particular update.
shadowofmordor,2ywdxh,MonolithAndy,3,Fri Mar 13 18:25:31 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Love seeing a game's devs on reddit. Always a good sign.
shadowofmordor,2ywdxh,Turin082,4,Sat Mar 14 00:13:02 2015 UTC,I'm just glad I haven't been thrown out yet!
shadowofmordor,2ywdxh,Boiscool,2,Sat Mar 14 00:26:47 2015 UTC,Took about 12 hours to grab off Steam. Way more than 8gb.
shadowofmordor,2ywdxh,Howzthis,2,Fri Mar 13 18:29:58 2015 UTC,"2 hours over PSN.   Steam is always horrible for me. Waseland 2 is the same size, but every time I try to DL it, it stalls after a half gig."
shadowofmordor,2yr54n,BuddhaB,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:48:46 2015 UTC,I have had this happen to me before.  It seems to happen if you execute a captain before he kneels down to give his spiel and give you the option of killing him or branding him.
shadowofmordor,2yo8nk,BarackPutin,8,Wed Mar 11 12:58:14 2015 UTC,That final fight was so fucked.  That's it? I just have to fight Sauron? Wait I have to defeat all these warchiefs again?? WTF I HAVE TO FIGHT SAURON AND THE WARCHIEFS?
shadowofmordor,2yo8nk,jshufro,4,Wed Mar 11 23:43:58 2015 UTC,That boss fight exceeded my expectations and I was deeply satisfied with the balance between difficulty and fun.
shadowofmordor,2yo8nk,Pahoyhoy,3,Thu Mar 12 13:04:51 2015 UTC,"I'm liking this DLC, played through a couple times. I think building up an army for bigger battles is great, it's what made the last mission of the main game so good. It was weird getting used to losing all my powers and upgrades, but it makes you rely on branding more which is the point I guess.   They could come out with anything and I'd get it though, love this game."
shadowofmordor,2yo8nk,icallrocket,2,Tue Mar 17 03:30:45 2015 UTC,That's what I really like about the dlc too. You can have massive brawls between packs of orcs. You also have to act more like a leader. You aren't as over powered and have to lead your orcs to victory.
shadowofmordor,2yo8nk,OnTheJobRedditor,2,Thu Mar 19 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I love just flooding the field with my orcs, and love how good the game is that I can just watch all the Chaos, and they usually get the job done themselves"
shadowofmordor,2yo8nk,icallrocket,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:13:50 2015 UTC,freakin loved every second of the last DLC ! The Warchiefs were beatiful designed and Branding was never more fun with a 40x Combo they are all yours hehe!
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,0ritfx,7,Wed Mar 11 12:16:31 2015 UTC,Likely not. There is no official word about any more content than what has been released.
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,Kevinthedude2000,1 point,Wed Mar 11 12:34:34 2015 UTC,"Quite enjoyed playing both DLC modes. Worth the $25 for the Season Pass, I reckon. the Hunt is basically a continuation of the main story, but Bright Lord is fairly different. Pretty tough too."
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,Howzthis,1 point,Thu Mar 12 06:58:24 2015 UTC,Season pass is usually for much larger amounts of content. Kinda bullshit that you get two dlc's and skins. Look at the season pass of any other game and you'll see much more content
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,ifixputers,4,Mon Mar 16 16:00:40 2015 UTC,"Also, if someone can answer: IMO, the Season Pass is worthy. What would you guys say?  I don't have it, but I intend to buy it ASAP."
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,rapozaum,2,Wed Mar 11 13:22:14 2015 UTC,Not really. Look at the DLCs that contribte to the main story. The other ones are completely separate camapaigns with different protagonists.
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,rapozaum,2,Wed Mar 11 13:25:39 2015 UTC,"How big is the Bright Lord? It seemed really nice on the trailer, plus, fighting Sauron is something the main game failed to give us..."
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,icallrocket,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:30:41 2015 UTC,"I really like Bright Lord. Mostly focuses on branding, so you get more large battles. You lose most of your powers/upgrades though so combat is a lot tougher."
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,icallrocket,1 point,Tue Mar 17 03:32:10 2015 UTC,"Also size wise, 8 missions or so, branding 5 warchiefs, then the sauron battle, with a few side missions that are fun"
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,rapozaum,1 point,Tue Mar 17 03:33:33 2015 UTC,"I don't own the game yet, but I'm really inclined to buy it plus the Season Pass...  Do you think it's worthy?"
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,icallrocket,1 point,Tue Mar 17 14:38:13 2015 UTC,I'd say yes. The gameplay is so solid that any addition is a great excuse to keep playing. I played through the campaign like 5 times before I bothered to get DLC
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,JoeyPantz,-8,Tue Mar 17 20:15:05 2015 UTC,I do not know. I keep playing the base game - it has a lot of side stuff happening all the time. Why should I drop it all and start something that will likely be smaller?
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,JoeyPantz,7,Wed Mar 11 13:33:09 2015 UTC,How can you comment on if the DLC is good or not if you haven't bought it?
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,M1k3tehrippa,-7,Wed Mar 11 16:18:10 2015 UTC,"I cannot comment on its quality. But what I can say is that it is somewhat closer to a standalone add-on. It's not a new area that you can explore with your character. It's not new skills, enemies or items. The only way to try the addon is to abandon everything you did in the main game. This is somethig I have a hard time doing.  However! This is also the way to make sure that the main game content is not stripped of anything."
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,MC_Fillius_Dickinson,3,Wed Mar 11 20:04:40 2015 UTC,Celembrimbor plays completely different than Talion. You cant have an opinion on something you haven't even tried.
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,ifixputers,3,Wed Mar 11 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, It took me a short while to adjust to my missing abilities and master celebrimor!"
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,JoeyPantz,3,Wed Mar 11 20:20:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I totally disagree. How does a lack of focus mode and a few new ways to brand constitute playing ""totally differently""? I had at least expected slightly different animations, but no. In my opinion, Celebrimbor is literally nothing more than another skin for Talion. He even has the same wraith abilities, which makes absolutely zero sense within the context of the story."
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,ifixputers,-1,Thu Mar 12 00:13:29 2015 UTC,"Of course he can. He knows it's separate from the main campaign, so he doesn't want to play it. That's an opinion, just because you love the DLC with a hard vainy dick doesn't mean he can't have an opinion. I bought the season pass and was horrified with my purchase, and I agree completely with him."
shadowofmordor,2yo52o,ifixputers,-1,Mon Mar 16 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"Lmao you're a faggot dude. Hard veiny dick for a dlc? All I asked was how can you comment on something you don't know. He thinks the idea of the seperate campaign I stupid, that's his only valid opinion. You cant have an actual opinion on the gameplay if you've NEVER PLAYED IT. Do you not understand how logic works?"

shadowofmordor,2ylvh8,Timewinders,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:50:41 2015 UTC,"Celebrimbor is a lying bastard. Remember when The Tower said that Celebrimbor could release Talion at any time? If Talion said yes, he'd just have fucked off."
shadowofmordor,2ylvh8,stealthcl0wn,1 point,Wed Mar 11 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what I'm asking is whether he manipulated Talion to get revenge on Sauron or was his true plan to become the Lord of the Rings?"

shadowofmordor,2ylvh8,stealthcl0wn,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:15:03 2015 UTC,So what do you think about the being bound to Mordor until the Ring is destroyed issue? Just a plot hole?
shadowofmordor,2ylvh8,stealthcl0wn,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:16:50 2015 UTC,I feel like that's pretty much true. The whole part about Celebrimbro saying he can go to the afterlife was probably just another lie.
shadowofmordor,2yk6xq,Aleforge,5,Tue Mar 10 14:29:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to restart. Keep exploring and doing story missions. The branding thing will become clear in time.  As for caragors, your attacks while mounted become more effective with a certain rune. Personally I find it more fun just to let the caragor do the attacking."
shadowofmordor,2yk6xq,nastylittleman,2,Tue Mar 10 14:39:46 2015 UTC,Branding will be unlocked in one of the main missions.
shadowofmordor,2yk6xq,DeorcHund,2,Tue Mar 10 14:50:56 2015 UTC,"You'll get to branding orcs in some time. In the meantime, keep slashing!  Dominated caragors remain friendly once you unmount them. What I do is, mount caragor, go near Uruk party, kill one Uruk while dismounting (shift + left click, if on PC defaults. not sure for console). Then you have yourself plus the caragor doing damage to the uruks. Much fun."
shadowofmordor,2yk6xq,aaruni96,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:11:14 2015 UTC,"I have not dismounted and let the cragor help out, thanks for letting me know! I know slashing and biting are coming up as left and right mouse buttons. But as I mentioned they just cause me to use the bow and sword. Although I did notice at random sometimes the cragor will attack when I press either. Not a huge deal if I can let him fight on his own anyhow.  I will keep playing ahead, I think 1/2 of them are dead now. Just didn't want to miss out on anything. Thanks for the help!"
shadowofmordor,2yk6xq,aaruni96,2,Tue Mar 10 16:20:54 2015 UTC,"Just tapping right click will make the caragor attack. Holding right click will switch to bow ability.  BTW, do try unmount kill. Cool animation, and effective way to initiate fights. (While on caragor, approach an orc, and press shift + left click)."
shadowofmordor,2yk6xq,intelnavi,2,Tue Mar 10 16:31:15 2015 UTC,You aren't even halfway through the game and don't even have those abilities unlocked.  Don't restart.
shadowofmordor,2yk6xq,NyoZa,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:13:47 2015 UTC,Thanks! I will keep playing ahead!

shadowofmordor,2yjfvy,wrowlands3,2,Tue Mar 10 09:41:47 2015 UTC,"Choose the 5 best and make them warchiefs, and make all the others their bodyguards. Then kill them and start again."
shadowofmordor,2yjfvy,FvHound,7,Tue Mar 10 09:45:34 2015 UTC,"It's gonna end up with me killing them however we put it, right?"
shadowofmordor,2yjfvy,Zenopus,4,Tue Mar 10 10:31:59 2015 UTC,"Game would've been incredibly deep to add social game play mechanics with branded orcs. But then again a branded orc is meant to do anything you want.  My best advice is try to level up enemy captains by helping them win duels, then once you have an army of your envision, you can solo or make your own army to fight them."
shadowofmordor,2yjfvy,wrowlands3,2,Tue Mar 10 12:01:18 2015 UTC,"That keeps bugging me. The uruks are under your control. It is your army. Yet they still have slaves and act like normal uruks. I pictured a hive-mind like army, that would just chant to your glory."
shadowofmordor,2yjfvy,BumblerBurger,2,Tue Mar 10 22:25:02 2015 UTC,"Once they're all branded, you could finish all the side missions first? There's nothing left to play for though if you don't replace your branded captains"
shadowofmordor,2yjfvy,IWatchFatPplSleep,2,Tue Mar 10 11:00:38 2015 UTC,"I find branding them is kind of worthless.  Unless you want to use them to challenge others.  I say kill them all, death threat the non-branded orcs, fast forward time a bit.  Do your best to get the toughest orcs to level 20, get the prized orcs to Warchief, fast forward time some more until they get plenty of bodyguards and start challenging them.    Oh, and let them kill you once so when you get them you get a revenge bonus for a chance of a better rune.    Also, the best events happen when you're just wandering around and you get caught off guard by multiple captains, so make sure as many as possible are death threated and max level for maximum difficulty."
shadowofmordor,2yjfvy,icallrocket,2,Tue Mar 10 21:07:20 2015 UTC,Rune harvesting. That is where I am at. Try and collect every epic rune. It's taking ages.

It appeared as though the keyboard was trying to take over, thus making the controller lose responsiveness. I believe that I went in to Device Manager and uninstalled the keyboard driver and let Windows reinstall the driver. I haven't experienced the issue in a while, so I believe it has resolved the issue.  Something else to try as well, if the above suggestion doesn't work, is to try a different keyboard and see if it is a keyboard driver issue. I was experiencing the issue on the CM Quickfire TK keyboard. Might be worth a shot."

shadowofmordor,2yf5tj,Aleforge,5,Tue Mar 10 14:30:59 2015 UTC,Almost certainly. With the overwhelmingly positive response and feedback + the ending of the game it's extremely likely they have begun working on it.
shadowofmordor,2ydf4o,TheBaconEater,1 point,Sun Mar 8 21:12:10 2015 UTC,I can only get to the gamma setting screen where you slide back and forth until you can barely see the image. After being on that screen for 1-2 seconds it crashes. I can barely find anything online. Some people did the things you mentioned but they haven't worked at all for me. Sucks.
shadowofmordor,2ydf4o,cweese,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:22:17 2015 UTC,I've mentioned in a previous post about a player having issues with crashing. Check your temps while gaming. Use something like MSI afterburner to see a graph of how your temps are running. I've noticed this game makes my normally cool GPU run pretty hot. For reference I have a 780Ti that normally gets around 75c during Unigine and this game can bring me up to 80c for long periods.
shadowofmordor,2y9szr,bobbyg27,7,Sat Mar 7 20:39:29 2015 UTC,"As i said before i'd recommend the DLC only if it was on sale, and as luck would have it, it is now.  The 2 most important DLCs are Lord of the Hunt and Bright Lord since they also have stories and new game mechanics.  If you really liked the base game and you want more than you should really get them both.   My favorite is Lord of the Hunt since i liked the Story more and the game mechanics introduced for hunting are very fun.  The Bright Lord DLC is also ok but i didn't like the fact that they tried to change the combat in a weird way, basically forcing you to view fights differently from how you would have in the main game.  Being able to AOE brand and use the One Ring is kind of OP but it is needed because they nerfed other aspects of your fighting abilities.  They basically set your HP to half of what Talion has and you can't increase it and they removed the vault stun for when you leap over enemies.  The resulting combat system isn't necessarily harder, it's just a bit more frustrating, specially if you are used with the skill set from the base game.  But at least it encourages you to try a different play style so i guess there's that."
shadowofmordor,2y9szr,Rift_R,6,Sun Mar 8 05:37:01 2015 UTC,Bright lord is the only one worth getting IMO.
shadowofmordor,2y9szr,slothman969,4,Sat Mar 7 22:44:21 2015 UTC,I only bought the skins and DLCs that give skins because I LOVE cosmetics.
shadowofmordor,2y9szr,stealthcl0wn,2,Sat Mar 7 22:18:39 2015 UTC,"Play a bit of the main game first imo. I have the season pass but I havent bothered playing the dlcs for some reason. If the dlc is not going to be on sale for much longer, get them, I would say that they are worth it, atleast as far as I have played them."
shadowofmordor,2y9szr,Ruikka,2,Sat Mar 7 22:10:47 2015 UTC,"I bought the season pass and regret it.   I've enjoyed the skins and warbrand missions/runes more than the Lord of The Hunt and Bright Lord combined.    There's something about the two main DLC... they just aren't fun. Plus nothing you do within the DLC alters or has any effect on the main campaign, so all the cool enemies, runes and techniques don't transfer over at all.    I wouldn't pay any money for either of the two big DLC.  If they were free, maybe try them out, but even then they seem a waste.  I started the Bright Lord a week or so ago, and have no desire to finish it.  Lord of The Hunt was even worse."
shadowofmordor,2y9szr,jdfred06,2,Sun Mar 8 14:39:25 2015 UTC,I don't understand why the 2 DLCs didn't expand on the already completed content? Keeping the progress and decisions you made in play. That's all they needed to do and it would of been great.
shadowofmordor,2y9szr,Aleforge,2,Tue Mar 10 17:23:50 2015 UTC,"I bought the season pass.  In retrospective, I say finish the base game  first before buying anything extra.  If you like taming beasts, get Lord of the Hunt.  If you really, really want to fight Sauron without QTE, get Bright Lord.  Only buy season pass if you decide to get both DLC.  Plot wise, they aren't really worth the time and you can learn about the plots from Youtube for free.  $10 is about the sweet spot for season pass.  I won't pay more than that for both DLC."

shadowofmordor,2y9szr,rapozaum,1 point,Sun Mar 8 16:55:39 2015 UTC,"Lord of the Hunt has more content, more story and is better-designed overall than the Bright Lord DLC. Bright Lord turns every single battle into a minigame, and it is EXTREMELY short. Every mission is largely the same with little room for creativity, because the most effective way to clear it is to repeatedly Flash Brand groups of Uruks in Combat.   If it's a choice between Bright Lord and Lord of the Hunt, I will always recommend Lord of the Hunt 11 times out of 10."

You can try it yourself, but [Triple Throw] is honestly the single most overpowered Skill in this game. It's so strong, it's practically criminal.   When fighting groups of Uruks, you can just Tap-Tap-Tap, Tap-Tap-Tap, EXECUTE EXECUTE, and it will build Hit Streak much faster than any Melee combat ever will. If you just need to get through a fight damn fast, do that. Works every single time.   Throwing Daggers also instantly kill any Uruk you hit in the back, or that's fleeing, and they are also infinite and cost no ammo. They're EXTREMELY under-rated.   For reference, this is a video of me EASILY killing a Graug WITHOUT using Shadow Mount, with Triple Throw and Fire Arrow. Triple Throw is just SO staggeringly good.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLME_3Ct28g  (I kill the Uruks halfway through, because I don't want them to Killsteal my Graug.

The general premise of being ""possessed"" by a dead elf is of course not at all consistent with Tolkien's universe, but the little artifacts are pretty much all in line and I found them a great complement to the story."
shadowofmordor,2xxoa8,Kevinthedude2000,5,Wed Mar 4 21:58:52 2015 UTC,"True. To suggest that through some kind of ritual sacrifice, the soul of an elf could be called forth from the Halls of Mandos doesn't really jive with anything presented in the Silmarillion or other ancillary texts. I suppose, if you wanted to argue it, it would be possible at the moment of the elf's death, before their feÃ¤ could return, but Celembrimbor died about 3,000 years before Talion was ever born. There is some mention of the spirit of a slain elf returning in the form of a descendent, but I'm not sure how far Tolkien fleshed that out."
shadowofmordor,2xxoa8,IGotsDasPilez,5,Thu Mar 5 02:59:10 2015 UTC,One thing I actually thought of after writing this was the dead men of Dunharrow. They basically died but were sort of restrained from leaving middle-earth due to the curse they were under for breaking their oath. This seems to show that curses can in fact bind someone here. Whether Sauron could just lay down such a curse at the drop of a hat is another matter though.
shadowofmordor,2xxoa8,Kevinthedude2000,5,Thu Mar 5 04:30:15 2015 UTC,"Haven't played The Bright Lord yet, so I don't know if that explains it, but I just chalked it up to the effects of the One Ring's corrupting influence, the same way the Ringwraiths are forever stuck to Middle-Earth."
shadowofmordor,2xxoa8,thejadefalcon,2,Thu Mar 5 05:20:49 2015 UTC,"If you haven't played Bright Lord, this is a bit of a spoiler, but Celembrimbor didn't ever leave to Halls of Mandos, and that's certainly thing that can happen.  The ritual at the start is basically Sauron summoning his wandering spirit, a ability that gave him the name ""Necromancer"".  These things are explained in HoME, in Morgoth's ring, IIRC."
shadowofmordor,2xxoa8,Nenyael,8,Thu Mar 5 11:10:18 2015 UTC,My only complaint so far is that I wish it was in more than just Mordor.  Mordor is like the ghetto of Middle Earth so I would love to see a thriving civilization such as Gondor or one of the Elf Kingdoms.

The Silmarillion was printed posthumously by Christopher, and he admits he likely got somethings wrong. Stories would change, names, places, timelines, back stories, were rewritten endlessly. So to be a ""purist"" as you say is fine, so long as one remembers that even Tolkien left a lot of wiggle room."

shadowofmordor,2xxoa8,mcvay206,2,Wed Mar 4 20:30:30 2015 UTC,"Well, there's definitely inconsistencies and things that don't seem to mesh, but as others have said, even Tolkien never fully laid down the laws of the land. After my initial scepticism at the concept of the game's plot, I quickly adapted to the wraith. It didn't bother me at all, especially when the plot further explained it (at least in my mind) with the Ring corrupting and trapping Celebrimbor. It wasn't until literally the last thirty seconds of the game I had to put down my controller and stop and ask ""what the hell did I just watch?"" Talion and Celebrimbor planning to make a new Ring was what tripped the ""no! stop screwing with the lore""-ometer than anything else in the game."

The 2 most important dlcs are Lord of the Hunt and Bright Lord. Both of them have a decent story attached to them and add a few interesting game mechanics that provide that twist that you need to keep playing for a few more hours.  I for one was grateful that they made these DLCs because after i was done with the main game i wanted more. The DLCs provided that.

shadowofmordor,2xzkd5,jdfred06,2,Thu Mar 5 10:11:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%.  The Black Hand skin is the best DLC, then the warbrand missions (new runes!), and The Bright Lord.  The Lord of the Hunt just outright blows.    If the DLC would actually implement some new items/enemies/missions into the main campaign, it would be better.  But they are stand alone mini-missions that in no way affect the original story."
shadowofmordor,2xzkd5,SnoopTidder,3,Thu Mar 5 15:29:16 2015 UTC,Precisely. It's hardly a persistent world when each DLC is a separate little glimpse of Middle Earth...also whoever decided that you could not carry on playing after finishing the Bright Lord is an idiot.
shadowofmordor,2xzkd5,MusicManReturns,2,Thu Mar 5 15:30:57 2015 UTC,Pros: great story add ons. Fun new game play elements.  Cons: not integrated into the preexisting story.   I enjoyed it but the people complaining are completely justified.
shadowofmordor,2xzkd5,take5b,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:31:09 2015 UTC,"I'm playing it now. I beat the main game a few months ago, with all achievements, and now I'm basically just killing time until AC: Rogue comes out on PC so I got the Mordor DLC to keep my occupied. I like it but it's totally unnecessary. - Lord of the Hunt is more of those missions with the dwarf. A couple minor skill upgrades for the animals but it's basically just a few more of those missions and then you have to kill warchiefs. - Bright Lord- this is the first time the game is actually hard for me and is making me think a little. I like the challenge. - Trials of War- completely superfluous, IMO. These are just a set of challenges where they tell you ""kill 20 captains and 5 war chiefs in 50 minutes"" or something. I don't like to game stuff without a story context."
shadowofmordor,2xzkd5,snotbot3000,0,Fri Mar 6 20:41:28 2015 UTC,I would say yes I found the game so much fun and the dlc extends this and plus more play time I found the regular story pretty short

I went for the skills first because they sounded amazing but the thing is that i really didn't use them that much(like once or twice each during my entire playthrough - 50+ hours).  After you get a hang of the combat you don't really need any of them.  I'd suggest getting more arrows/focus time, more health, and only get more rune slots if you get a really good rune that you want to use.    All the upgrades are good but this is just what i'd do if i'd start the game all over again."
shadowofmordor,2xxy2h,Rift_R,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:20:02 2015 UTC,"The special abilities are really nice - I first went for arrows, then stealth, then sword last (being able to auto-stealth out of any situation at any time comes in handy).   As for priority, some of the base original abilities are very useful - I'd say at least put a couple points into the key ones (concentration time, number of arrows, etc.) - you can hold off on the rune slots - they help, but aren't critical.   I'd say get half the base-case stuff, then one of the ult skills - then go to 75%, then another ult - then get the last one once you're almost done."

The stealth is incredibly fun and gives you lots of options. Batman being so weak to bullets is one of the reasons why the stealth is so great. It forces you to be careful and think out a plan. The story in both games link together very well and is incredibly made. Origins, however is horrible. It's filled with bugs and doesn't really bring anything new into the series. Arkham Asylum and Arkham City are the main reasons why I wanted to buy Shadow of Mordor. The combat and stealth seemed as fun as the Arkham games but has a new twist to it."
shadowofmordor,2xvlyx,tupicgold1,11,Wed Mar 4 06:44:56 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend Arkham Origins as well. Despite not being done by Rocksteady, it has held up well and Troy Baker nailed it on his version of the Joker."

shadowofmordor,2xvlyx,Jovian8,5,Wed Mar 4 07:55:14 2015 UTC,The boss fights in Origins were awesome!! The ones in the first two games weren't near as good. If you liked the combat in this game and are a fan of Batman I'd still recommend playing all 3.
shadowofmordor,2xvlyx,LosLoneGringo,4,Thu Mar 5 16:27:58 2015 UTC,Sleeping Dogs has similar combat and a great story but it depends if you like GTA style games. The Amazing spiderman also has similar gameplay with a nice set of upgrades. Obviously the Arkham games are the next best thing to SoM but those are just some other options.
shadowofmordor,2xvlyx,dylanoh,3,Thu Mar 5 07:26:22 2015 UTC,"Its' not that Batman is weak, its that he's human. In all the media portraying him you only ever maybe see him take a bullet once or twice from a lucky shot and nothing more.  His armor can only absorb those few shots but it cannot do it under sustained fire. Plus he's the freakin Batman. He uses fear, cunning, and stealth to take out the baddies with guns and kicks the asses of those who dare to fight him hand-to-hand. You gotta think like the bat when playing those games.  As for anything else..? Iunno. Assassin's creed series?"
shadowofmordor,2xvlyx,Wilwheatonfan87,3,Wed Mar 4 07:32:27 2015 UTC,"Assassin's creed series?   I've tried Assassin's Creed, but just can't get into it.

shadowofmordor,2xvlyx,4Tenacious_Dee4,2,Wed Mar 4 13:34:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer, I guess Ill hive Batman another try"
shadowofmordor,2xvlyx,Jovian8,3,Wed Mar 4 09:08:33 2015 UTC,"No other game has aped the Batman combat as well as SoM did. A few have tried (Amazing Spider-man 2 comes to mind) but none of them really did it well. I would recommend you try Arkham City as it's a vastly improved iteration of the combat that started in Arkham Asylum. Both games are good but City is the pinnacle of the system so far, with a lot of additions and refinements that made it ultimately much more fun and interesting than Asylum. Origins has practically the same system as City but with a few new wrinkles, so if you're jumping in mainly for the combat mechanics, that's a good choice too."

I also like the Orcs who seem to be worried what their fellow Orcs will do to them once they're dead, asking for their remains to be burned."
shadowofmordor,2xsy3i,BumblerBurger,23,Tue Mar 3 19:17:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the orcs' desires, while perverse, are never explicitly sexual. If anything, the preponderance of evidence suggests they are only interested in the bodies of their victims as trophies. If one likes your skin, it's because he wants to make a bag out of it.   While some of them obliquely flirt with Talion / Celebrimbor, I've always read it as a desire to flay / crush / maul them and use their individual bits as trophies, not as any sexual desire. They don't want to possess Talion in a sexual sense, but a literal one.   This is, of course, quite a nasty thing in and of itself, and debatably just as bad as (if not worse than) rape. But I don't think it is even implying rape."

The depiction of Orcs wriggling like maggots from the ground is mentioned in LOTR as well as depicted.in the movie, but they did not pull a ton from the Silmarillion. Since Orcs are corrupted men/elves, it would make sense that there are females somewhere.  You could say the same thing for Dwarf women, we never meet one, but it is mentioned that they have beards like the men and it is hard to tell them apart.  Maybe those Orcs we're killing are half men and half women, but the women look just like the men and only Orcs can tell them apart?"

He's my guy now, but he's still a little weak compared to some, so I'm grooming his replacement in Thrak the Destroyer.

The Lord of the Hunt is probably one of the most frustrating DLC's for any game that I own... it has good new content, new enemies and new runes, but guess what?  NONE of that makes it to the main campaign.  None of it.  It's just a mini-campaign that's too compartmentalized to really be enjoyable.  The Bright Lord is no different.  They are both quite disappointing, with The Bright Lord being marginally better.    I would have preferred 4-5 new runes with a few new Uruk captains and skins over either of the main DLC.

shadowofmordor,2xlwoe,Something_Syck,1 point,Mon Mar 2 02:44:18 2015 UTC,"IDK about bright lord but LOTH was a huge letdown for me. Briefly held my interest, but once you kill the beast warchiefs (which is the only real story in the DLC) that's it, normal ones take their place.   From what I've heard all the warbands and other DLC are the same, they all suffer from the main problem the game had, they're too freaking easy and don't hold your interest very long  When they make SoM2 they should bring on some of the Dark Souls guys as consultants"
shadowofmordor,2xmtiz,msdfhhaa,7,Mon Mar 2 03:49:19 2015 UTC,I think you're talking about when there are two opponents attacking you (and the right-click icon appears) and you can counter-attack both enemies and that is when he helps you.  I could be mistaken though.

shadowofmordor,2xckbm,SnoopTidder,20,Fri Feb 27 13:22:23 2015 UTC,"I would tentatively disagree about the Bright Lord DLC. I thought I was pretty good at the main game and the Lord of the Hunt, taking down each Warchief and ensemble quickly and easily, never needing to depend on special abilities. When I started the Bright Lord, I died in the very first battle after the tutorial, because they stripped back all of Tallion's abilities. I couldn't vault-stun them, I couldn't focus head shot the whole group at a time, I was forced to reevaluate how I needed to take these guys on. And every damn ururk seemed to be a berserker or a shield-bearer that you couldn't block!  But it made me a better player for it. Who wants to breeze through a game anyway? It's not fun dying all the time, but it's not fun being able to overcome absolutely each and every obstacle without needing to think about strategy. The whole point of Shadow of Mordor was the Nemesis system, relying on you to actually die to these uruks in order to create a relationship with them (mostly).  I grew to love Celebrimbor's play-style more than Tallion's. The focus slow-down was way over powered, you could just send a death threat to a Captain and then take out his posse in round of quickfire headshots. Without that, I actually got to do some really archery, and I found it much more rewarding for it. The same goes for vault stunning, it was my only way to take on huge groups, and without it I learned how to actually take on large groups only using the sword.  I beleive it makes sense that Celebrimbor's abilities are muffled compared to Tallion's. Tallion is a mix of human/wraith/elf with Celebrimbor's few thousand years of experience thrown in. Mordor should also be a more difficult environment too - Sauron is at the height of his power and therefore his uruks would be comparatively stronger, as well as Mordor become an angry red wasteland.  The ""One Ring"" power took me a fair while to get used to. It's pretty much an invisible version of the three weapon powers, and I thought it to be all the weaker for it. But it become fairly difficult to take down the Warchiefs without it, especially since they arrive with Captains that you can't take down prior. Plus I was rubbish at charging up the meter in combat, trying to fill it up mid battle against a legion of non-blockable beserkers is a feat in itself.  Which takes me to the final battle: Unghhhhhhhhh. Damn those cinematics were good. ""I AM THE TRUE LORD OF THE RINGS"" or something to that effect - He may not have been as much as a badass as Tallion in power, but he made up for it in character. Arrogant, selfish, incessant, I think it fitted his character well, banishing him to eons of undying due to his hubris and inability to heed dire warnings. I freaked out fighting Sauron, they designed him well. There's no way Celebrimbor should be able to defeat him, and they game certainly showed that, only his creation (the ring) allows him to even stand a chance. Those power smashes were so cool, I'd duck in to brand someone and bolt out in fear of the onslaught. I found the fight really intense, forcing me to master mid-combat branding when I had managed without it before. I also thought that they tied in the ending really well, driving home why the two protagonists were linked, why Celebrimbor chose Tallion and how foolish Celebrimbor was for trying to cut the strings of fate. I thought it was a fantastic end to the series and a ""true ending"", even though it was really set in the past.  So I don't know why you found it so off putting. I found Celebrimbor perfect in his comparatively crippled state. I relished the difficulty increase and bulked-up numbers, I even found having to run away due to constant low health made the game a more enjoyable experience for me. Taste is absolutely fickle in nature, and there are plenty of things that I dislike but are almost universally praised by others. So I say to you - to each their own! It's unfortunate that you had such a sour experience when you enjoying the vanilla game so much. Maybe you'll try it again sometime and find that it wasn't so bad, but you can never have a first experience again and that's a real shame. Thanks for reading, this turned out way longer than I expected :P"
shadowofmordor,2xckbm,L_O_Quince,2,Fri Feb 27 18:36:16 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the DLCs too.  LotH had its moments, cargaths were a blast, the diseased graugs...not so much.  But I really loved the Bright Lord.  I think the fact that the main game made Talion so overpowered is what is putting a lot of that sour taste in people's mouths for how they upped the difficulty.    I would have liked to spend more time playing with the higher level caps for captains.  But the change in gameplay style felt good and I'm actually looking forward to replaying it and try to die a lot less.    And while I say I liked the DLCs, I would be lying if I said I wasn't at least a little disappointed in them at the same time.  They shouldn't have been 100% separate from the core game.  The new animals and mounted captains should have been added from the LotH and the higher levels and new branding abilities from the BL.    Could they have been better?  Of course.  But I found they added to my enjoyment more than they took away from it."
shadowofmordor,2xckbm,BumblerBurger,-2,Fri Feb 27 21:26:31 2015 UTC,"Whilst you make some compelling points, my question is this: Celebrimbor is roaming Mordor -presumably- wearing the ring at all times. How then, is he as weak as Talion at the beginning of the base game!?   To be clear, despite the production values -cinematics especially- the DLC felt like a lazy after-thought.  After a long day at work I really don't enjoy mini-missions such as 'branding x amount of Uruk for y reason'...it's boring...completely and utterly boring.   They certainly could've done more with the one ring...invisibility on a timer (think crysis) would've been interesting. More enemy varieties etc...the list goes on.   Anyway thanks for responding, it's interesting to hear differing points of view."
shadowofmordor,2xckbm,joeDUBstep,2,Fri Feb 27 19:36:33 2015 UTC,"I mean, Talion in the beginning has the power of a ring wielder, it even says so on his page, add onto that the memories and experience of Celebrimbor, he gets more powerful as he combines his ranger training and the powers of the wraith, along with the weapon legends, you can see how he became more powerful than Celebrimbor was originally"

shadowofmordor,2xckbm,jdfred06,1 point,Fri Feb 27 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.  I feel like the season pass was, unfortunately, a waste for me.    I honestly got more out of the Warbrand missions, the new runes and the new skins than I did out of Lord of the Hunt or The Bright Lord.  The Lord of the Hunt was kind of awful, and the Bright Lord is... passable I guess.  But the big problem I think is that the DLC is too compartmentalized... The enemies, level caps and even runes don't come into play with the main campaign.  I also agree with you that the difficulty in the DLC is very much artificial.    The most fun I have with the game is playing as The Black Hand and just running around killing Uruks and being a general bad ass.  The least amount of fun I have is trying to get my money's worth out of The Lord of the Hunt or the Bright Lord."
shadowofmordor,2xckbm,bentheiii,2,Fri Feb 27 19:25:51 2015 UTC,"I liked Lord of the Hunt just fine, although, definitely shouldn't have been 10 bucks. Should have just been an update, considering the only thing meaningful it does is add a skin, and alter Caragors and Graugs slightly.  My problem with the Bright Lord DLC is how it FORCES you to use a Branding playstyle, as opposed to the base game and LotH, where you could go about the game in your own way. That, and the One Ring basically trivializes Captain and War Chief fights."
