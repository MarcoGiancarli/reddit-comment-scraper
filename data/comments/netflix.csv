netflix,3e0yp8,faux_grass,16,Tue Jul 21 06:54:11 2015 UTC,"Wain and Showalter's comedy style is very polarizing. Wain also makes Children's Hospital (wrote 60 episodes, directed 9), and a lot of the same cast as WHAS was in a recent movie, They Came Together (sadly, missing Bradley Cooper). It does for romantic comedies what WHAS does for '80s teen sex comedies. I can't think of a more love-it-or-hate-it movie. It takes the classic joke structure - setup, and unexpected payoff - and turns the unexpected payoff up to 11. Plus, takes the romantic comedy tropes (like someone turning to another character who just gave them advice and saying ""thank you"", or running in the rain) to extreme lengths.  TL;DR - You'd also hate They Came Together."
netflix,3e0yp8,not_thrilled,9,Tue Jul 21 11:27:16 2015 UTC,"Extreme absurdist comedy and this sort of HYPER extreme parody comes with great risk. It's inevitable that some jokes won't land.

The biggest problem is that neither poll controlled who had cable to begin with. A lot of Netflix's subscribers can only afford to have the service versus paying for cable/dish.   The article also has a subtext that Netflix is the reason people are cutting the cord and for many like myself Netflix had absolutely NOTHING to do with that decision. In my own personal case it was HBO Now along with Hulu Plus and Amazon that will save me at least $500 in the coming year. Because while the first two will allow me to watch 85% of my current TV shows, for the last couple (FX and AMC content) I will have to pay $30 per show per season to see.   And that's only if I am impatient. AMC content will go on Netflix and FX shows end up on Amazon Prime within about 9 months.

With netflix I can squeeze in what I want to watch when I want to watch it.  I also feel that amazing TV shows would not have been canceled so early had they initially run on a platform such as Netflix or something like it.  Firefly is a prime example.  It was given a shit time slot and for whatever reason the bigwigs decided to NOT air the two-hour first episode.  None of that would have happened if it had been aired on netflix as a netflix original.  Just look at OITNB.  Great TV show, and the ratings can't lie because people can watch at their own convenience instead of hoping they are able to sit and watch at the designated scheduling time."

I use both as a cable alternative and kodi/torrent other stuff which is pretty much exclusively game of thrones.  Protip amazon often offer and reset their prime free trial. My flatmate does an amazon prime trial as often as possible. She gets a few a year.  Also netflix allows 6 users (IIRC) and a number of concurrent users depending on your plan (2-4). If you have a good friend (e.g someone who won't sell/give the account to another 10 people) or two then split the cost of the netflix sunscription between you.  You can do the same with amazon but I believe they do have 2 users in their terms and conditions so I wouldn't share a prime account with more than 1 other person.

The licensing agreements are a bit more difficult. That being said, Netflix AT has grown quite a bit since its launch in September 2014.   Netflix also has a huge competitor against Sky. The problem with Sky is that they're not quite getting it. If you have a Sky subscription for their TV service, you get the streaming tacked on free. But then to get just the streaming is a bit more difficult (need a Samsung Smart TV), although maybe it has changed since last year.   Then Amazon Prime is pretty big in Europe, too.   It's all slowly changing here. The EU is all about trying to create a single market and remove a lot of the regulatory differences between countries but it's going to take time.

netflix,3dv4s3,orbimobius,2,Sun Jul 19 23:34:14 2015 UTC,"I just googled it and apparently 1080p streaming isn't supported on silverlight over browser, it is supported over html5 on IE, but html5 isn't supported on netflix unless you run windows 8.1...  There's zero mention of Firefox on that help site... You could try it out but it seems doubtful. It's possible that IE+win8.1+html5 just play nicer with HDCP (a form of DRM as far as I know) which is why they get extra treats. It's similar to how you can't play HD movies you purchased on play movies/youtube in HD on Chrome unless you install their additional play movies Chrome app.  (In case other people read my comment, I typed the below up, so it could be relevant, but evidently not for /u/orbimobius)  This could be a licensing issue. I believe Netflix does an hdcp compatibility check (by their licensing agreements) before running higher than 720p. You can see see if your hardware and OS support it by running a tool like ""CyberLink BD & 3D Advisor"". Install it and check if you can watch BluRay on your computer, it should pass all the tests except for Blu-ray disc drive and software player, the most important part being the bottom one on this screenshot."

Almost all films are made in 24fps and that's what you get. Picture quality or a 60hz monitor has no impact on that.   As for the reason why it feels smoother on your smartTV, it could be that your PC slimply has some trouble playing the stream and is lagging a bit.  If you in Chrome start a stream press Shift+Ctrl+Alt+D and have a look at Framerate. It should be 23.975 aka 24 and dropped frames and Latency should be 0."
netflix,3dxzpd,Abyss_85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:30 2015 UTC,"Well, indeed it's what you told me. And i also tried to see the information on the chrome, it was always 24 fps with no dropped frames and latency to 0. But about the stream lagging a bit, this is weird, because all other videos i tried to watch on my pc, even 60 fps videos, was normal. Any idea or is it even possible to watch it on my pc like on my TV? I don't find it like a problem actually, but it would be good to watch it in my monitor with the same smoothness i have on the TV..    Thanks for your help too."
netflix,3dxzpd,Abyss_85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is a bit strange. To be honest, I never checked if the numbers Netflix gives you actually represent how the stream runs on Netflix end or how it runs on your machine. Since this feature isn't really for the end user and more for the tech support it could be that is checking Netflix's end of things... Anyway, I don't think there is a way to get the same result with your PC as with your TV, different hardware and software environment. You could try Firefox, which runs Silverlight, not HTML5 like Chrome does and see if it works better for you, but my guess is it wont, and Silverlight is also an external prgramm opposite to HTML5, in short HTML5 is just better then Silverlight most of the time."

netflix,3dy23p,DPAmes1,2,Mon Jul 20 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"To date the chance of that has been zero, although the past is no guarantee of the future. However, how would Netflix distinguish this? On a standard Netflix subscription you are allowed to have two simultaneous streams to support two TVs in the same household viewing different content (e.g., adults and children). You are also allowed to use your Netflix subscription when traveling in other countries, in which case you will see the content licensed for that country. It's certainly within the allowed terms of service for one family member to be traveling and viewing Netflix content in another country while the remainder of the family at home is viewing domestic Netflix content. So in theory if your account accesses U.S. Netflix to watch one title, and then connects in Australia to watch a different title a few minutes later, there's nothing suspicious about that: one family member could be traveling in the U.S. while the others are at home in Australia. Sure, Netflix could probably develop creative ways to distinguish allowed use from non-allowed use, but they aren't exactly motivated to go to that much trouble. Still, you probably shouldn't be stupid about it - if you blatantly switch between 5 different countries in 5 minutes, you're begging to be noticed."

netflix,3dvtjx,HatmanGates,-3,Tue Jul 21 09:48:36 2015 UTC,"Richer cousins over the pond? You do realise that's incorrect right. On the whole the same job in the UK pays significantly more in the UK than the US, the general rule is roughly $1 for £1 and for lower paid jobs due to our minimum wage the difference can be even higher.  And thats ultimately why it seems so often that we pay more for things when using a simple currency conversion. Currency conversion isn't actually meant for price comparisons as its too simplistic as swapping currency only has the exchange rate as a factor. When you are pricing goods you have to look at a much bigger economic picture than just the exchange rate and one of the biggest of those are wages. Netflix have UK staff at the UK operations end who they are paying more than they are paying the US staff, the utilities they require (inc.any UK servers) have higher staffing costs so they charge more, the UK distributors they purchase rights from have higher staffing costs so the rights cost more and so on. It ultimately works out though that the cost of any item/service in the UK is roughly the same percentage of an average wage in the UK as it is in the US so in real terms the prices are about the same even though the exchange rate suggests its much more. Oh and I should also add Netflix prices in the UK include VAT, as every state in the US has a different rate of Sales tax (although many states don't charge Sales tax on digital goods at the moment) the US prices are excluding Sales tax.  Now the reason you shouldn't just subscribe to a foreign version if its available in your country is that they aren't technically the same company. The money Netflix in the UK has to improve is dictated by the amount of people paying, if you skip over to a different region you aren't really helping them be as viable in the UK as they could be. Sky have such a stranglehold on the UK TV and Movie market that diverting your money to the US arm isn't good.   Also seeing as the US isn't even the cheapest if everyone jumped to the Columbian or Brazilian one or even the Canadian one they would be paying significantly less than they are even on the US one. When/If they eventually launch in places where £7.49 is a few months wages their prices are going to have to be adated further for these markets and if all their subscribers are to hunt out the cheapest its going to really starve not only their incomes and budgets in a few regions but every region and thus the company as a whole thus limiting their available spend which is then not good for anyone. We want  a Netflix that's a viable business in every country they operate in and where every region has plenty of money to speed both on acquisitions and original commissions for that region as that's the best for everyone.   One last thing when buying vouchers online people need to be wary anyway. While the ones on Amazon seem legit many such vouchers for Netflix in other places (and some of the other streaming services that have vouchers on Amazon) are selling codes that may be valid but aren't actually legit codes and if you get caught using one of those thats your account gone and a good chance you are blacklisted"

A simple speed test won't tell you how stable your connection is -- I'd highly recommend calling your ISP to see if any known issues exist and if you're not wanting to do that, perform some basic network troubleshooting (powercycle your modem & router, check the connection, try a different network, try another app on the Xbox, etc).

netflix,3dqdmu,Etunimi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:57:38 2015 UTC,"Your Netflix account is global. Country restrictions on content are applied according to your IP address only when you search or stream. Your standard Netflix account can have two users at the same time in different countries seeing different content lists (supposedly for a traveling family member).  Any credit you add to your own local account applies globally. But beware of people offering online deals on shared Netflix accounts, like the ones you see on Ebay. They are definitely not legit, so you have no idea what they are actually doing (e.g., maybe they stole someone else's account details and are selling you shared access to that account, maybe they have a cracked account promo code generator, maybe they're selling shared access to a 4-user Family Plan - who knows?)."

netflix,3dqdmu,NetflixSuperhero,2,Sat Jul 18 17:50:56 2015 UTC,"Nope, no inside knowledge. I think the information about how Netflix handles your account between different countries is pretty common knowledge. For example if you buy a hardware box in the U.S. and it comes with a free month of Netflix, you can apply the promo code to your Canadian account and you will get a free month. I've never seen anyone report a problem between countries with Netflix promos. As for advising caution about online deals on a Netflix subscription, that's just general advice. There's a lot of non-legit offers out there (e.g., selling access to shared accounts, which appears to be what most of the Ebay offers are for). Your bitcoin deal might well be buying a legitimate Netflix gift card. Just be cautious, especially if the price seems suspiciously low."
netflix,3dqdmu,DPAmes1,0,Sat Jul 18 18:06:03 2015 UTC,"No problem, I just wanted to ask. To give quick context... with this, its dependent on the country of registration on the account (the IP address at the time of sign up) when it comes to determining the factors when redeeming GCs and making payments. That is why if you start an account in Australia but move permanently to the US, you will still get charged AUD as opposed to USD. Gift cards follow the same method as actual credit/debit cards so if a customer has an account in Norway and tries to redeem a US gift card, it will not process at all and will give an error asking them to call in.  Hope that context helps a bit :) That said, I would definitely advise against buying a gift card online for all the reasons that you stated because you are spot on about the scammers being out in full-force"

Your voice has been heard and I will be sharing this with the team :) It will really come down to the time/effort investment it would take to implement this feature as well as planning where that ""hide/show episode titles"" button lives within the interface. It would obviously have to live in a place that makes sense (near the episode list), but doesn't cause the interface to be re-structured to accommodate it. Either way I promise I will bring it up.  Edit: I just remembered the episode name also appears in the play bar while playback is happening, as well as our ""post play"" experience where we ask you if you want to watch the next episode / something similar / etc. I think the fact that the titles exists in so many places would make this potentially a lot of effort to make this show/hide feature work in all of those locations (It's probably pretty easy on just the episode selection screen).

I know that my answers are seemingly vague, but in my position, I do have to maintain some anonymity since my co-workers don't even know that I'm an avid redditor.  As far as my tenure, I can't give specifics but I will say that I've been here long enough to hold multiple positions within the company (I started out from the 'bottom' and have worked my way up) but not long enough to hold more tenure than quite a few others on my team :)"

That being said, it sounds like additional factors are coming into play which help determine what shows are recommended. The information on recommendations gets pulled from a variety of areas; previously watched titles, your My List, recently watched titles, rated shows/movies, etc.  What I'm willing to guess is that if you go to your My Account section and head to viewing history, you will see that it's populated with a lot of children shows. Simply clicking on the 'X' next to each title will remove it and thus will not be calculated into the recommendations.

Think about it, these people who use these services are most likely a bit more ""advanced"" users (even though it is fairly simple task to set up) and they would find their way (back) to illegal downloads pretty fast if the access was blocked. Also, as Netflix and reliable vpn/dns services aren't free people really show that they are willing to pay for the content and good service.

The distributor who has the rights to show X will lose potential revenue to piracy, which in this case would be netflix via VPN. The original content creators may still win out, but the distributors will not be happy, because netflix is being used in lieu of the licensed distributors. Instead of me going to company X (likely foxtel in Aus) and getting cable to watch a certain show, I'll just use a VPN and watch it on Netflix, which is why the distributors are getting shitty.    They pressure netflix to block VPN access (not sure how effective that would be anyway) because netflix is being used in that way. They have outright declared they are looking to trial certain methods of blocking VPN access, but that was maybe 3-4 months ago, and I feel like it's not really in netflix's interest to block that anyway so I doubt much would come of it."

I don't think it would be too hard for netflix to get moving on content rights. They have a couple competitors here (foxtel and two other internet streaming services) but I don't think they really compare at all. I have no doubt in time netflix will push forward, though marketing wise the others are pushing hard, I can't imagine them holding onto that share of the market for too long given how quick netflix is expanding. It'll likely be easier for content creators to just give rights to netflix in many places instead of dealing with netflix in america and others in Aus."

As for another VPN service, I've used ZenMate for a while, which unfortunately isn't free anymore. There's still a free version, but I don't know how good it is. I would suggest using a paid service like Unlocator (what I'm currently using, would recommend) or Unblock-us if you can afford it. They're usually around $50 a year (I think).  As for free extensions, I know some alternatives to Hola have emerged over the past few months, but I don't know any particular name, and hope someone else will give you some recommendations :)"

Just change the DNS setting on your router and you can watch netflix, hulu, cbs, whatever from all devices (PC, Chromecast, Tablet, etc...).

Chances are even less likely while both Mozilla and Netflix engineers decipher where exactly in service delivery chain the issue exists and continue to pour over data each day.  As soon as we know how to fix the issue or can tell how many customers this impacts, we will communicate all of that info out. I think this information has been communicated , and if not, it will soon. We then will call some customers to collect information to help troubleshoot and ultimately  resolve the error."

Its like a Mexican soap opera (no offence intende), the music is comical, the reactions are like a pantomime, the continuity is outrageously bad, some of the acting is overacting.... however its a great story told in detail from all sides and often with real footage including inserting the real people into scenes.  Whilst I had heard of the Medellín Cartel I had no idea how much they had injected themselves into Colombian society in the worst possible way.  Escobar became a psychopath and would kill anyone to progress his agenda."

I originally liked the Jim Carrey film because that's what got me into the books, but after reading I realised they went about it all wrong - trying to fit 3 books into one film was just horribly awkward. Where were they going to go afterwards? They left it open for the sequel.  I guess back then, it was a lot harder to do this idea of Sherlock like episodes in a series of 13 because they take so long to film, and there was no Netflix like server around. I still think it's a bit improbable because it'd take so long and so much more money than just doing a normal season, but I'd love to see it."

netflix,3d7zwg,wredditcrew,2,Tue Jul 14 08:57:36 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Use a VPN, or DNS redirection service, to get a lot more Netflix content for very little extra money.   Your account is global, your selection is regional. If you use something to change your region, you get a different Netflix selection.  Do NOT use Hola. I'd also avoid ZenMate et al.  To largely copy from the sprawling ""Don't use Hola"" thread...   VPNs - The original and best. It creates a tunnel between you and the VPN provider. All your traffic goes through it. /r/vpn can help you with these. There are privacy benefits to VPNs as well.   I love PrivateInternetAccess. PIA has a good Android client and a decent Windows client (and Mac and Linux). You can do it manually too for pretty much any tablet, smartphone, desktop or laptop (and some set-top boxes) if you want.  There are plenty of other VPN providers. You need to pick one that has servers in the Netflix regions you want.  If you have a router that supports OpenWRT or similar then you can even connect to the VPN directly from the router. Then anything you connect to it is VPN'd.  You can't generally set up a VPN to run directly on a console however. There are ways around this: Run the connection on your router, or run in on your PC/laptop and connect your console through that. Workarounds like using Connectify (use ""DEAL"" coupon for discount) or routers are needed for devices like Chromecast but those workarounds are fine for consoles too.   DNS-based authentication redirection services - These sneakily redirect your authentication and authenticated (username and password associated) traffic through their own servers first. They leave the other traffic running normally (hopefully).    If you've seen someone telling you to change your ""DNS addresses"" or ""DNS Codes"" (sic) then this is what they mean.  These work on some consoles and other devices but sometimes need extra work done (like blocking 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).  My favorite is Ad-Free Time. It requires changing some network settings that are responsible for converting the domain name you use (like ""netflix.com"") into IP addresses (like ""54.243.253.96""). They fake the results so they can redirect the needed traffic through their servers in the right country.  AFT also block lots of adverts, region unblocks lots of other services (like iPlayer and Hulu and HBO) and it's cheap. It also has a feature that lets you block subtitles when you're using a Netflix region that forces subtitles.  You can set it up on your router (although not all routers support this - You're looking for the ability to specify DNS servers!), or on PC/Laptop/Mac. UK users can grab an ""On Networks N150R"" for about £7 which you can load up with OpenWRT to do the job (and it can also auto-update your IP with Ad-Free Time).  Because it's far less resource intensive than supplying a full VPN service there are free DNS redirector services that might not be scams. They're basically doing a ""Man In The Middle"" attack on your behalf. Unfortunately it's perfectly possible for them to redirect and spy on traffic you don't want them to. Like your banking, or your email, or Facebook.  Personally I have used PIA for a couple of years and I've just recently added Connectify to the mix. Family who don't need a proper VPN get AFT, it works brilliantly. Your needs might make a different solution a better choice. You can PM me if you like, but there will be sleep breaks where I can't get back to you for a few hours!  Edit: Affiliate links stripped. Cheers loonypuncher."

Another:   Open any TV episode. Show the app commands, either through the title bar menu or moving the mouse. Click ""Episodes"". The pop up menu is completely empty."

netflix,3d9awe,DPAmes1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:04:55 2015 UTC,"I've also been looking for a way to file bug reports or feature requests. Here's my issue:  since Netflix started splitting DVDs from streaming video, search has not been unified.  You don't always get all the media on which you can watch something in your search results, and sometimes you don't get a match at all if the result is on the ""other side"" (streaming vs. DVDs or vice versa ...can't recall right now which way fails in this way).   In addition, once you do get a search result on streaming, often you are only presented with a way to play the video right now, when sometimes you only want to put it on your list.   How hard is this to get right, really?"

When I couldn't and I saw all the posts that were over a year old with no solution, I decided to call myself.. I actually went in with the mindset that if they said that they're working on it, I'd freak out on them but they were super nice and tried a bunch of things for me and they escalated it so they constantly had something else they could try and we got to something that fixed the continue watching issue and they just kept trying to fix the rest and eventually we got to this and it worked ..

Later down the line Roku and Apple TV will most likely follow, Roku has already said so.  Now to the more problematic part, that you have to resarch before you make your buy: Just because a TV can do 4K does not mean it can do Netflix in 4K, even if it has an Netflix app. It has to support HEVC. Here is a list of  4k TVs that support Netflix in 4K and as you can see it's not that long.

You would need to check with Loewe to be sure.   Also, if you're using an Nvidia Shield, it's not critical that the TV itself support the HEVC codec.

Jodi seduces the victim, Travis, a likeable yet conflicted character for a one night stand. She then becomes obsessed with him and insanely jealous. The movie deals with this conflict, where the tension is palpable and based on evidence from the trial. I am going to presume you know the true story, but in case: SPOILER: she brutally kills him, stabs him in the shower, and the ending deals with her capture and trial, although brief. Most of the movie is based on their relationship and her obsession with him. All along, you have a sense of dread knowing what is going to happen to him."

Frankly, I think Netflix could definitely do more to promote their own programming, and taking a few seconds between episodes (note that they don't interrupt the middle of anything to plug), then that's fine.  HBO Go/Now does it too, it's really not a big deal.  If it was an ad for something like AXE Body Spray though, then we'd have a problem."

netflix,3czj6y,luxdesigns,5,Mon Jul 13 02:38:00 2015 UTC,"Search is still there, it's up at the top of the page. If you want to sort, click on 'Browse' and pick a section; 'Sort by' will be an option under those pages. User reviews are still there; when you mouse over a movie, there's a little down-arrow that pops up on it. Click on that for all the stuff that would normally be on the separate page for that title. User reviews are under 'Details'."
netflix,3czj6y,ZombieButch,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:17:33 2015 UTC,"It's so sad... before, I could get a page of reviews all at once. Now I can only get two at a time, at most."
netflix,3czj6y,luxdesigns,3,Mon Jul 13 02:37:05 2015 UTC,I don't want those changes. I hate the new black background and smaller pics of the titles and all the things you mention. I'm low vision and it's horrible for me to try to figure everything out and read the smaller font size.
netflix,3czj6y,pieala,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:50:47 2015 UTC,No one used their Max feature and so they are trying to make regular browsing difficult so that we will accept it when they return it.
netflix,3czj6y,Perrykgreene,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:50:00 2015 UTC,"I am yet to see a single person in many threads we had on this subject who liked the new changes.  The only explanation that made any sense so far is that people who use PC to browse netflix are such a small minority that netflix decided that supporting a separate interface for us is a waste of money and now we get the same limited usability as the people who only access netflix with their smart TVs.  But it does not make a lot of sense either because even if you watch netflix on TV, you would still want to use a much more powerful UI we used to have on PC if you want to do some browsing/searching in order to fill you instant queue."
netflix,3cya7j,lkjeddie,40,Sat Jul 11 21:41:10 2015 UTC,"Netflix is scared that if you saw all the titles they have, you would be disappointed.

netflix,3cya7j,theDoctorAteMyBaby,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:58:31 2015 UTC,that's 341.  8175 results but they count separate seasons and stuff like http://instantwatcher.com/title/70141617?content_type=1%202&sort=available_from%20desc&page=340 so difficult to say how many there actually are.

netflix,3d248x,Kammon,6,Sun Jul 12 22:22:23 2015 UTC,Nope... Its just the shitty PlayStation drive giving up.   There is no way a disk could kill a drive (except exploding of course).  Even when the disk is poorly manufactured and the laser has to go full power  to read that disk the laser does not die. There are resistors which are calibrated for each laser individuly to protect it.   What your friend is expiriencing is just wear on the laser. Replace it and you are good to go.   You also could increase the powerinput on the laser (about 20mins work) but it will wear out even faster.
netflix,3d248x,phoenystp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:08:32 2015 UTC,"Uh unless something is physically protruding from the disc, a disc can't affect a disc drive. Your friends disc drive is messed up. The disc did nothing"

netflix,3cwpmd,szebra,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:19:57 2015 UTC,Netflix API is kill. And screen scraping is a terrible workaround for a site that updates as much as Netflix.
netflix,3cwpmd,kuilin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:43:07 2015 UTC,It can't use the ratings tab? At least for genres?
netflix,3cwpmd,catfayce,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:34:06 2015 UTC,That's what screen scraping is... And Netflix's user interface changes so much that writing a program to navigate the user facing interface isn't good at all.
netflix,3cwpmd,kuilin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:40:46 2015 UTC,"Aah ok, I just thought as this layout hadn't changed in a while it would work for a bit at least  The couples profile would work best though"
netflix,3cwpmd,catfayce,2,Sun Jul 12 00:50:11 2015 UTC,"Huh... that might actually work out. Though there would be no way for the users to give their login info to the program unless they gave their usernames and passwords (a big no-no) or if they downloaded a client executable that did this for them, since they probably disallow XSS..."
netflix,3cwpmd,kuilin,2,Sun Jul 12 00:57:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't give it my login so probably a no go, but if I was already logged in and it ran a script in which you chose a profile, it scraped the data, switched to the other user profile (a new tab on the same login) and threw up suggestions based on both our results id allow that. So it never has to know any login data  But like I said they are probably best of just getting a shared user to as to the account, its what me and the housemates do"
netflix,3cwpmd,catfayce,5,Sun Jul 12 01:02:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, it's two profiles on the same login, not two different logins? That could completely work as a bookmarklet. Sounds neat, I'll see what I can do. I don't have anything interesting planned for the weekend anyways."
netflix,3cwpmd,kuilin,2,Sun Jul 12 01:06:54 2015 UTC,I'm not op but this would be super handy for when I visit my family who use my login with their own profile.

netflix,3cuofo,Schnabeltierchen,2,Sat Jul 11 14:07:13 2015 UTC,"Strongly disagree, it was the poor result of two unparticularly notable seasons, ultimately making it a really poor final season with almost little payoff and thus, no redemption for the show. I found myself losing interest in the supporting characters in 5 and 6 particularly the new ones, but 7 made me lose appreciation for Dexter himself as well as the show.  While being reasonably spoiler free, why do you think it's better that 5 and 6?"
netflix,3cuofo,Harish-P,2,Sat Jul 11 17:09:05 2015 UTC,Mostly because of the main antagonist. I thought s5 and s6 weren't bad either.

In Canada for example Always Sunny is probably not on Netflix because it's on FX Canada which is owned by Rogers.  Rogers is trying to keep things out of Netflix's reach whenever possible.  It's possibly on Shomi in Canada to stream, I'm not sure.  As for Malcolm in the Middle in Canada, I'm not sure.  There is probably some TV channel that has the rights to it.    That being said.. Always Sunny is available in other countries like the U.S. and the U.K.  You can check availabilities of shows on websites like www.moreflicks.com if you want to access regions of Netflix from around the world you need a service like www.unblock-us.com which in my opinion is well worth the $5.     As for shows like them... well there's a lot of choice.  Workaholics is on Hulu, that's a popular one which would be similar to Always Sunny.    Welcome to Netflix.  It's the best $8 you'll spend."

But I just looked back through my history and I listed the ones I've seen.  They're not synopses, just what I can remember real quick and whether I thought they were good or not.  You might disagree, sure.  Movies are to taste.  But because you asked.  Alien/UFO/Space * Extraterrestrial - Great alien horror, in my opinion.  Would recommend. Some gore, multiple jump scares. A noticeable nod to The X-files at the end. * Grabbers - Good alien horror, has Lovecraftian inspiration, I think, and some humor to it, too.  Some jump scares, a little gore. * Lunopolis - Some people wouldn't classify this found footage movie as horror, but I found it had a lot of the mystery/suspense elements of it.  Of course, it's not fast-paced, so don't expect there to be the sort of horror ramp-up you're used to. * Alien Abduction - I had fun with this found footage alien thriller. No gore, lots of jump scares. I highly recommend it.  Acting can be bad in some places, but that's about it. * Dark Skies - Definitely recommend. Alien horror with multiple jump scares, and a lot of unexplained story. Nice climax/ending. No gore. * The Last Days on Mars - Astronaut horror.  Scientific thriller. Good suspense.  Some gore, jump scares if I recall. * Alien Uprising - Alien Suspense more than horror, but gives me a good alien rush.  Some gore, can't remember if jump scares.  Ghost/Demon * The Haunting of Whaley House - sucks, makes no sense, is basically a parody of itself.  Not even really fun to watch in a campy sense, really.  Medium gore. * Apartment 143 - Good supernatural thriller.  Multiple jump scares, no gore. Found footage. * Exorcismus - Not terrible, but I wouldn't put it high on the list if you're hoping for fright.  No gore, not even any memorable jump scares. * Mercy - Again, not terrible, but I feel like there's too much going on to have a good focus for a horror movie.  The writer seemed to want to include too much lore. Low gore. * The Taking of Deborah Logan - Good horror. Incorporates nice elements. Amazing ending. Low gore, multiple jump scares. Found footage. * At the Devil's Door - Good horror. Takes some creative turns on the possession angle.  Low gore. Some jump scares. * The Babadook - Nice horror, good psychological mess, multiple jump scares/suspenseful scenes, no gore. * Haunter - Saw this one a while back.  Wasn't terribly impressed by it.  Ghost horror, no gore, some jump scares. * The Awakening - Everyone says its a good ghost horror, but I found myself terribly bored by its pace.  No gore, no actual jump scares. * Knights of Badassdom - Clearly a parody of itself, but in a fun way.  Has good horror elements to it, despite being a comedy.  Would recommend.  Lots of gore, no jump scares. * Devil - Didn't think it would be good, but definitely good psychological/supernatural horror.  Jump Scares, light gore.  Would watch again.  Supernatural (could also be ghost/demon) * Absentia - Decent scare, creative concept that uses unseen horror as its primary element.  No gore (one disturbing scene) * VHS - The first one of the installment.  Good, found footage.  The different story elements make for good horror since the scenes are short enough that they don't really have to be explained fully.  It's like taking little horror gel caps. Gore. Jump scares. * V/H/S2 - Clearly trying to market off the success of the first one.  I was less impressed with this one, but that's not to say I didn't get some good fright out of it. Gore. Jump scares. Found footage, duh. * V/H/S Viral - Ultimately, I think the worst of the three, but again, it all comes down to whether you liked the first two. I'd still watch it, though, I just don't think the quality of the stories was as good as the first one. * The Mirror - Found footage knock off of Oculus.  I mean, it has some good parts to it, but ultimately was predictable.  You spend a lot of the movie getting mad at people for being stupid.  Medium gore, multiple jump scares. * The Cabin in the Woods - Joss Whedon horror.  Need I say more? Some gore, some jump scares. The best.  See it.  Otherworld * Banshee Chapter - Good movie, incorporates the mystery of MK Ultra and the Numbers Stations, Low Gore, Jump Scares. Sorta found footage. * John Dies at the End - Weird movie, some humor/sarcasm, Medium Gore, more messes with your head than really scary, though * After - You kind of figure out what's going on pretty much at the beginning, but it's a good ride anyway.  No gore. * The Hole - Decent.  Some bothersome plot holes, but ultimately some good suspenseful scenes.  No gore. Some jump scares.  Regular Old Killing * You're Next - Started scary, then gives too much away.  More of a thriller than it is horror, I guess. Low gore (except for one scene), some predictable jump scares * Would Your Rather - Not really horror, but definitely a psychological movie.  Not the best, but not terrible. Low gore. No jump scares. * Trollhunter - Not really horror, but kinda horror. Foreign language, but also just a good found footage movie.  Would recommend for fright night. No gore, no real jump scares. *  13 Sins Like Would You Rather, not really horror, but has some great suspense/gore elements that will make it feel like a horror film.  Good twist, I'm sure some saw it coming, but I thought it ended the movie well."

The bottom line is that in the long run the Netflix model for movies is unsustainable. It existed as a 3rd tier revenue stream for studios. As its popularity has risen, so have the fees the studios rightfully expect Netflix to pay because it is cannibalizing other post-theatrical revenues. When Netflix decided not to meet Sony's price, that was the writing on the wall that eventually they might be out of the movie streaming business altogether unless they want to start raising monthly fees to pay for them."

Many native americans reported that they had to wear makeup to make their skin color darker, often a trick used by old Hollywood to make someone seem more villainous.   The other side of the argument states that this film is meant to be a satire on how Hollywood has been racist in the past, and both Netflix and Happy Madison productions have released statements about it.  Personally, I feel like this isn't the real problem with this movie. The real problem is that as Americans we do not question whether something will actually be good to watch, but instead we watch it because it is marketed to us. The interview is an example of a movie like this. For example, the TV show Marco Polo was so well promoted and advertised but how many people actually considered if it was actually worth watching before we turned it on. As consumers we need to demand for not more quantity of films but better quality."

If after both of these things it's still only 480p then it's maybe your connection to the router especially if it's wifi. It could be as simple as you are getting extra interference which is limiting the speed, perhaps someone has added a new router in your area on the same band and it's causing issues. Perhaps try using Ethernet to test or change the wifi band to a less crowded one or if you can move the TV next to the router just to test.

netflix,3cluxy,Brulbeer,0,Thu Jul 9 10:40:04 2015 UTC,"Netflix is not the blocking guy here,  it's Hola and the other crappy vpn service.  Don't use them.  Hola is dangerous,  Google it.  Use a proper vpn service (PIA)  or use a proper dns service like dnsflix.com"
netflix,3cluxy,FR05TB1T3,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:07:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, could be. It worked before. I'm not an expert on this kind of stuff, I never used VPN/Proxy/DNS before Netflix. I googled and Hola was the first, and best rated thing I got. It was even recommended in an article.   But thats one of my points, there are so many different services, that may be unsafe or crappy. If you don't pay again, to get a good VPN/DNS (whatever), you will have a bad time, and even If you pay for it, you will still be a ""pirate"". That may sound stupid, but I don't wanna feel like a pirate, if I pay twice as much, to see the same content like an US citizen."

There were like.. four locations.   1- The apartment  2- The Law Offices   3- Fisk's apartment  4- Grungy outside location du jour.   That works in a sitcom. Not so much in an action/superhero series.
netflix,3cctyl,your_mind_aches,3,Tue Jul 7 16:57:38 2015 UTC,You forgot the industrial building with yellow lights flooding in.
netflix,3cctyl,TheDragonOfTheWest99,3,Tue Jul 7 19:27:19 2015 UTC,Hell's Kitchen is a small place. And that's not true about the locations hahaha  But that's the point of the series. It's meant to be intimate and not feel grand scale.

netflix,3cctyl,ElRyano,0,Wed Jul 8 02:57:55 2015 UTC,Daredevil is definitely my favourite there and deserves the top spot I think. But Sense8 definitely deserves to be above OITNB imo

But the redhead annoys me.  So does the old lady. I love the black guy. And the blonde from 30 rock. But Kimmy and the old lady kill it for me.
netflix,3cctyl,MR_Se7en,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:58:53 2015 UTC,"My GF started watching it one night while I was playing some games and I'll be honest, the first few episodes started to draw me in. I mean, I knew what was going on and that it was supposed to be a quirky tongue in cheek type of TV show so I accepted it for what it was... until the courtroom scenes started. Any charm or fondness I had for the show ended as soon as I was introduced to the lawyers.   I understand that the show was supposed to be funny, but I was hoping that the trial scenes would bring some actual depth to the show. Instead it took me away from the ""feel good"" nature of the show and just added in huge annoyances. I guess to me the show started out being about a girl who didn't know shit about the real world trying to find her way while staying positive. The crazy characters were surrounded by more or less realistic events that happen in every day life. The show ended being about a positive, albeit naive, person surrounded by morons and idiots that removed any sense of realism or charm and took me completely by surprise in a bad way.   It's one of the few shows that the end of the season made me wish I'd never even see the beginning of it."

netflix,3cctyl,NeverDoingWell,31,Tue Jul 7 12:40:41 2015 UTC,I'd be more bugged about Sense8's rating if it weren't for the fact that it's getting good reviews by Netflix users and lots are getting introduced to it through word of mouth. Really hope it gets a 2nd season announcement soon.
netflix,3cctyl,wievid,10,Mon Jul 6 23:17:59 2015 UTC,"Before the show premiered, a lot of reviewers were given just the first 3 episodes of Sense8. So I think many of the reviews are only based on those first episodes. I think that hurt Sense8's reviews quite a lot because, even though there were problems throughout the season IMHO, the show got much better after the first few episodes."
netflix,3cctyl,NeverDoingWell,2,Mon Jul 6 23:27:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed that too, and it really bugged me because for most shows you can't really get a full sense of what the show is like from a fourth of the episodes so I think it's a poor practice on their end. Some shows just take a while to hit their stride."
netflix,3cctyl,wievid,2,Mon Jul 6 23:31:22 2015 UTC,Shouldn't that be important though? Shouldn't a show draw viewers in even with the first episode?
netflix,3cctyl,NeverDoingWell,0,Tue Jul 7 14:52:13 2015 UTC,It should but I think that it's generally impossible. There are shows that try and do that but the writing is typically unintelligent and rehashed. You need to build enough plot and backstory in a few episodes that can carry something across several hours of viewing. With a movie there's less involved because you have the viewing public spending less time in the seats and don't need to really capture their attention so long.   At least that's my theory.
netflix,3cctyl,wievid,3,Tue Jul 7 15:54:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think I should agree with that. Plenty of other shows that are good have drawn me in with the first episode. I mean, just now I watched the first episode of this show called Humans and it made me want to watch more. The same goes for House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. The only show where that wasn't the case in recent memory is Bojack Horseman. But it was forgivable because each episode wasn't upwards of 40 minutes long. Not everyone has the time to watch more than two episodes of a 40 minute show just so they can know if it's ""good"". I'm sure there are a lot of people like that, but I know I'm not like that"
netflix,3cctyl,silentpat530,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:04:45 2015 UTC,"And that's perfectly fine! :)   My coworkers and I got into this discussion about how many episodes we usually give a show before dropping it or sticking with it. A couple of us more hardcore series fans said 3-4 while our other guy, who was more into movies, left it at 1. If the first one didn't hook him, he didn't stick with it.   My personal experience has been that a show that keeps me really hooked and interested over many seasons has a slow build up but then there are other those rare shows, House of Cards being one of them, that grab you from the very beginning and don't let go."

Which frankly is behind the times and, as you said, can hurt a show quite a bit. Critics don't need to judge a show by 3-6 episodes, or whatever they get before release, if the whole thing is right there on release, like it is with Netflix most of the time.  Critics can still get their screeners and give a first impression based on that, but the actual review and the score resulting from it should be based on the whole series. A lot of other people binge-watch, it is not too much to ask of critics to do the same."
netflix,3cctyl,c0mbobreaker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:02:13 2015 UTC,"A lot of other people binge-watch, it is not too much to ask of critics to do the same.   I would be tempted to disagree, but then video game reviewers probably spend more time playing games for review than a television reviewer would watching an entire season of a netflix show. It can be done for sure. As a reviewer for a show, though, you would need to make sure you aren't glossing over faults because you're watching so quickly."
netflix,3cctyl,-spartacus-,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"Of course it can be done. - And just to be clear, I'm not saying it has to be done on the next day. Give it a week if you really need that. A critic that does that will probably lose some views to one that was faster, but if he/she is good it won't matter that much.  The  thing that has to start to get more representative review scores (if we need them at all) is to see the whole thing before doing the review and not just base it on screeners if the entire show is one click away as it was with sense8 and Marco Polo."
netflix,3cctyl,c0mbobreaker,0,Tue Jul 7 13:39:28 2015 UTC,"The reason I agree with the person above and disagree with you is this isn't like network TV where you are clinging on viewers every single episode so you have to make it good instantly then struggle to keep that same pizzaz.  Some shows are better because they build slower into a much more deep and impactful story.  Think how terrible Agents of Shields started out to be?  How is it now?  Its fucking amazing.  Should it have been better at the start?  It would have been nice.  The thing is that sometimes a show just gets better as it goes a long, that's what lots of people find out on Netflix.  They hear about these shows that people stuck with, how good they got, and they go back through and watch them on Netflix.  Netflix relies on this model to have long shows that keep people coming back, drawing people in for hours a time.  That way there is always something keeping them subscribed."

Not to mention the acting, cinematography, directing, and editing are all top notch. I absolutely love how vivid the show is in depicting people and the world. The writers don't care how you feel about what's going on; they only care about the story they want to tell -- and the fact that Netflix let them do that is freaking awesome!!"

Examples of this are Between, Lilyhammer and Peaky Blinders.  In other cases, Netflix either exclusively picks up an existing project before it is made and thus has worldwide rights to it (Marco Polo, Bloodline) or commissions a production company to make one of their own ideas (House of Cards, Orange Is The New Black)."

I'm not sure if it's streaming rights or regional, but that's what they do with a lot of these shows that are branded as a Netflix Original. Take, for example, The Fall. That is a BBC show that netflix got the US rights to. But your average user probably thinks Netflix was involved much more deeply than that. It just makes their catalog look better."

netflix,3cbt75,SnoozeTrain,50,Mon Jul 6 21:45:32 2015 UTC,"The music you hear in the video is the Dresden Dolls. They're represented by Roadrunner records. The parent company of Roadrunner is Warner Music Group, who are notorious for their copyright takedowns. Does anyone buy that WMG is letting a fan-trailer with over a million views use their music and not lay claim and have it blocked? I don't.  The account is a month old, registered under the name of the editor-in-cheif of a newspaper that is riddled with misinformation, distruth and denial. No status updates have been given to us about this series since it was announced, nothing at all in 8 months. Yet this well-made ""fake"" video hits the internet with a splash. I smell viral marketing. If not by Netflix, then by Handler and his team.  <Edit 1>: Amanda of the Dresden Dolls is married to Neil Gaiman, author of Coraline. The audiobook of Coraline features music from The Gothic Archies (the record in the video), a band in which Daniel Handler played accordian. Dude below me says Amanda owns the music. She can give  permission. Maybe it was Gaiman's time to return the favor? Let's see what /r/conspiracy has to say about this.  <Edit 2> : The picture of Elenora Poe on Youtube is an image of author Laura Jean Libbey. According to some research, one of her novels is ""Mischievous Maid Faynie"" in which a young heiress is forced to marry a man at gunpoint, so he can collect her fortune. Sound familiar?  <Edit 3> The image of the Netflix logo against the typewriter has been online since AT LEAST June 18th. It is attached to the faux poster published a few months ago. Where did they get that image of the trailer 3 weeks ago when the trailer is only 2 days old? CONSPIRACY!!!  EDIT 4 : PRETTY SURE IT'S FUCKING REAL (www.twitter.com/jackgriffo) This kid works on Nickelodeon show and this is his verified account. He straight up says his friends made it for Netflix. So, Netflix told the truth. They didn't do it. They commissioned Jack Griffo's buddies to make it. This kid accidentally let the cat out of the bag, me thinks. SPREAD THE GODDAMN WORD. I'M NOT FUCKING CRAZY.  EDIT 5: twitter.com/eleanorapoe contains a phone number that links to the newspaper from the movie series. Can anyone check and see if that number is a leftover promo from the movie or if it's new? Also, look at who Eleanora is following. Suspicious.  <EDIT 6> : Here is the portfolio for a person who clearly was involved judging by the photo. He claims it is unofficial, but choose not to comment on if he is affiliated with Netflix or the show.  Subedit : Oh, Goddamnt. These blokes are claiming they did the effects. They have done effects for a wide array of high-profile projects . This is good indicator this was NOT a simple fan production in my book."

netflix,3cbt75,giftedmunchkin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:55:08 2015 UTC,"I've been following this pretty closely (okay, obsessively) and I really appreciate your edits. Unfortunately, I've been using them in the exact opposite way - to disprove it's legitimacy.  A few people on reddit have cited the origin of this video as Kellen Moore. I'm not sure where this originated, but it checks out. Kellen Moore is known for having created two other unofficial trailers that many people believed were real - one for American Horror Story: Freak Show, and another for Bates Motel (though he was later hired to create actual Bates Motel teasers based on the reception to his unofficial ones). Both the DP and DAC (whose profiles you linked above) list the fake AHS teaser and a Bates Motel teaser (unfortunately I'm not sure which was the fan-made one and which was the official one). To me this confirms that Kellen Moore is easily behind this teaser as well.  Furthermore, there's decent evidence to suggest that a lot of the things that make this seem official is actually just done to drive promotion to the people who made it. For example - the person who initially posted it to Buzzfeed (this link, with the original headline suggesting that it was official) - openly admits to having worked on it (her twitter contains a lot of evidence, linked tweet being the most damning as well as this one). Setting up a robot answering machine is easy compared to the work they put into producing and releasing this short, and I don't find who Elenora Poe follows to be particularly damning since anyone can follow that specific collection of accounts.  I'm hoping against hope that this is real (it's possible that Kellen Moore was chosen because of his aesthetic, and he chose to work with people he was already comfortable working with), but the way the crew is acting to promote it feels very scummy to me (posting it to Buzzfeed, the instagram conversation, etc.) and honestly is kind of poisoning my attitude towards them.  The main thing that I can't find an explanation for, and as a result is the best evidence for me towards it being real, is the logo. The logo from a month ago identical except that the older one is lighter and appears to have been squashed horizontally. Although it's possible they could have reproduced it (they obviously are very talented), even the texture on the typewriter is identical, as well as things barely visible in the background of the darker logo. Other than that, I think the evidence is pretty stacked against this being real.  Anyway I've spent way too much time of my life going down this rabbit hole. Hopefully it will turn out to be real, but I need to get back other things. Thanks for keeping us updated with your research!"

netflix,3chluk,wakey87433,2,Wed Jul 8 15:06:49 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it's because the copyright holder has been lazy and just supplied the first version they get hold of which often means the syndication version. As syndicated versions are designed to be shown at any time of the day this can include words being bleeped when they weren't in the initial broadcast.  Something that should be noted is not all episodes are always deemed suitable for syndication because the whole subject matter of the episode is problematic so special syndication versions don't exist, if the channel wants to show these they just get the broadcast version and broadcast it later where it's suitable which can explain why some episodes are sensored and others aren't.  At the same time sometimes shows beep things for comic effect so you would need to find out if the broadcast version had that. If the broadcast didn't then let Netflix know, they are generally pretty good at going back and getting the correct version."

Dust to Glory   This action-packed documentary chronicles the infamously treacherous Tecate SCORE Baja 100 road race across Mexico's Baja Peninsula.

netflix,3c8b37,hirisertom,95,Sun Jul 5 21:04:37 2015 UTC,Finally they will have time to get into the books and not just quickly summarize like the movie
netflix,3c8b37,jo1993,60,Sun Jul 5 21:57:37 2015 UTC,"I really hope it's better than the movie. The movie wasn't bad, exactly, it just... completely failed to live up to its possibilities."
netflix,3c8b37,on_my_lunch_break,7,Mon Jul 6 00:01:17 2015 UTC,That's what happens when you try and cram 3 books into one movie.
netflix,3c8b37,JustCallMeEro,12,Mon Jul 6 07:36:36 2015 UTC,"To be fair, there isn't exactly enough action in the first book to fill a 90-100 minute movie heavily aimed at families, not to mention the fact the first three books are incredibly short. They had to merge the first three books just so they could have steady stream of action to break up the story and make the movie more ""exciting"". They almost certainly would have had a slower pace in the sequels (and probably only adapted 1 or 2 books per movie).  The movie was pretty good for what it was, a fun family movie."
netflix,3c8b37,pottyaboutpotter1,2,Mon Jul 6 09:32:32 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree. I loved the movie- it was what exposed me to the books. I started listening to the audiobooks afterwards. I'm just really looking forward to ""no-rush"" screen adaption."
netflix,3c8b37,JustCallMeEro,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:50:17 2015 UTC,Yea I wasn't mad they put 3 books in 1 movie but to do the whole series like that would've meant at LEAST 5 movies unless they crammed more than 3 into a movie and then it just seemed impossible and never going to happen. Which was disappointing because the later books were my favorites.
netflix,3c8b37,jo1993,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:33:08 2015 UTC,"Handler did give the movie his approval and it has become clear he didn't have a very clear plan for the series simply because he chose to end the series without actually resolving anything probably making the approach to adapt difficult. While the books were great, Handler clearly didn't have a plan as he contradicts himself on the fate of the children; mentioning in one book that Violet will return to Briny Beach for a third time and in another mentioning Sunny will become a celebrated cook but in the last book says the fates of the children are unclear for example. The Great Unknown goes around and gets rid of all the loose threads so Handler doesn't have to resolve them as well (the Quagmire Triplets, the crew of the submarine etc.). And let's not get started on the sugar bowl.   While it's all part of the series's charm, it makes it very hard to adapt. Especially as the movie came out while the books were still being written. The Netflix series will have an easier time of things now all the books are out and Handler's prequel book series seems intent on answering some of the big questions so they can draw on that if they need to. It's just a shame the movie was harmed because they made it too early (at the height of the books popularity). If they'd waited, I'm certain the film would have been more of a success. I'm certain the studio waited until all the books were released before considering a sequel (to see if there were any books they could skip probably) but by then the kids got too old and they decided not to bother. I almost wish the film's fake happy ending was the real ending so the film could have had some conclusion and wrapped up instead of being open for a sequel."

netflix,3c8b37,hammerific,2,Mon Jul 6 18:44:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed! (I've posted this comment an embarrassing number of times, but I want everyone to believe that it's real with me so I'll be less lonely and sad):  I wouldn't be surprised if Netflix isn't affiliated with it in the same way Daniel Handler is just ""friends with"" Lemony Snicket. I mean, if someone in-universe was going to leak this story, it'd make sense to have it uploaded by Eleanora Poe, breaking the news or whatever. We fans love our conspiracy theories, and I have a REALLY hard time believing a fan could accomplish this on a technical level. That CGI of the leech? Amazing. The amount of money it'd take to get those books and documents to look so real? Almost impossible, it seems.  It also occurs to me that this got over a million views. a) Do fan videos do that? How did all the news outlets seem to snag this at the same time, before it really took off? and b) if they do, don't they get taken down for infringing copyright (namely, that Dresden Dolls song, though possibly also for tossing Netflix onto their non-Netflix video)? And c) the person who made that would absolutely come forward to tell everyone how awesome they are, because jobs ought to be flying their way with that kinda talent.  So yeah . . . this might be my inner conspiracy theorist coming out, but I'm not willing to believe that this isn't legit and being used as a publicity stunt. Partly because that just seems so delightfully Snicket, and partly because I don't think anything could get better than this teaser, and I need this way too much."

Bryan Fuller is going to be working on his new Starz series American Gods, and told them he wouldn't be able to produce season 4 of Hannibal for at least a year or so, and they didn't want to wait that long for the season to go into development.  Netflix can't bid because of the Amazon contract.  So, unless there's a network willing to wait a year for a new season to begin production, with public consciousness already pretty thin to begin with, it likely won't continue.  Probably the best bet would be Starz, HBO, or Showtime."

netflix,3cbod5,Philo1927,6,Mon Jul 6 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"Ah, the inevitable ""You just don't GET it"" defense.   I liked the show, but it has issues. It was sometimes unclear just what the sensates could do in each other's minds and under what circumstances does it get triggered.   But the biggest problem was shared by another new Netflix show (Bloodline): they both peaked too early. The best episodes were in the middle. The concluding episodes were fine, but couldn't match or top earlier ones. Which is a shame, because both shows have fantastic casts, especially Sense8 which pulled off a casting miracle by finding such great but relatively unknown actors for the main roles. In fact, I wish they had not used Daryl Hannah nor Naveen Andrews."
netflix,3cbod5,Cinemaphreak,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:17:46 2015 UTC,"but it has issues. It was sometimes unclear just what the sensates could do in each other's minds and under what circumstances does it get triggered.   Thats not really an issue. It makes sense that even when the sense8s dont know it fully, that we as  the audience don't know why fully. The only thing we know is it works automatically when someone needs something, be it fighting help or emotional help.  As for your second part. I would say the action peaked in the middle, but the story and intensity of the sense8s peaked towards the end for sure. (I dont want to spoil too much in case people havent seen it yet).  I do think its reasonable to assume a lot of people wont fully watch sense8 because of all the gay themes that are shown without restraint, and that will hurt its viewership."
netflix,3cbod5,Frodamn,0,Tue Jul 7 02:26:03 2015 UTC,"Everyone I've talked to says it's the gay themes. It's just a repeat of Ellen's show back when she came out as a lesbian--try and shove the gayness down the public's throat, and you're guaranteed to lose viewership, regardless of the opinion people have on gay issues.  Most people I know that would be into the show are super annoyed by the 'shove the gayness in your face' borderline propaganda the show pushes. Hell, I personally wouldn't even want to see some of those scenes with a Hetero couple substituted in--it just seems spectacularly out of place and kind of annoying, and doesn't benefit the story arc whatsoever, which begs the question why it was included in such a fashion."
netflix,3cbod5,WolfSheepAlpha,3,Tue Jul 7 04:10:37 2015 UTC,"Its not shoving gayness down your throat though. It sucks that people still view it that way.  Sex scenes hardly in my opinion add anything to a movie/series (except maybe rape scenes, but thats a different story). In sense8 I felt it worked to show how it effects all the sense8s with different emotions, since sex = love = emotions.  Between Nomi and her lover though, to me that was more of an emphasis to show how important Amanita is in her life, and as an anchor to show that becoming a female wasnt a waste. But it did get to a point where it was just over emphasized, but that wasnt a deal breaker for me.  I did find it kind annoying how Nomis beginnings in the show were focused around Pride, but to be honest thats just the backdrop for her character like Capheus' backdrop of poverty etc. Just showing the background of the character and where they are coming from and how they got there."
netflix,3cbod5,Frodamn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:47:28 2015 UTC,"I think you define 'overemphasized' the same way I define 'shoving it down your throat.' Given that, I agree completely with everything you've said.   Nonetheless I feel like the general public is going to reject that aspect of the show as it feels forced and almost like a conspicuous attempt to normalize and badger the viewer into accepting gratuitous depictions of homosexuality as part of standard entertainment. 20 years from now it might not be a big deal, but when that's the number one complaint I hear from my friends and coworkers, something fishy is going on."
netflix,3cbod5,WolfSheepAlpha,2,Tue Jul 7 14:28:47 2015 UTC,"Dont get me wrong, the only gay part I thought was overdone was Nomi and her GF going at it at nearly every chance.  The pride stuff at first felt weirdly there, but it did make sense later on and absolutely deserved to be Nomis backdrop.  The thing with Lito and his partner wasn't at all preachy, it was just his character.  Hell, even the super sweet orgy they all had was fine and made sense as a tool of showing why sens8s develop such a connection.  The only thing that can realistically be considered preachy is the initial pride stuff that happens with nomi, but if thats enough to make people stop watching then they probably have some innder issues to work out.  Im sure if it was a KKK rally that was dealing with racism people wouldnt say ""oh they are shoving this racism problem down my throat""."
netflix,3cbod5,Frodamn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:34:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can agree with this. It's just such a huge disappointment because they're using nuclear weapons on matters that require C4... I just want to shake them and be like 'WHY ARE YOU RUINING THIS!?'"
netflix,3cbod5,WolfSheepAlpha,0,Tue Jul 7 19:58:04 2015 UTC,"It makes sense that even when the sense8s dont know it fully, that we as the audience don't know why fully.    Pretty much the only purpose Naveen Andrews' character exists is for exposition and explaining to the characters (and by extension naturally the audience) how the power works.    The only thing we know is it works automatically when someone needs something, be it fighting help or emotional help.   There are too many scenes where it should have been triggered but wasn't simply because it would have messed up the narrative flow. There were also plenty of times when it was triggered for no reason whatsoever.   I will have to agree that having two LGBT characters (especially ones that engage in rather graphic sex) will turn off some viewers, but I think the overall unevenness of the show is what ultimately caused it to not catch on. Reddit is the perfect gauge of a show like this and the fact that it has had a lukewarm, at best, response from folks here does not bode well for a second season."
netflix,3cbod5,Cinemaphreak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:14:46 2015 UTC,Do you have any examples of when (you think) it should have triggered to when it didnt and vice versa?

Even though I am by no means a homophobe I did feel that they were pushing gay imagery pretty hard which is something I hear people say turns them off when it's in a show or a movie that has far less than Sense8....I watched all episodes very fast so it obviously did not have an effect on me but I am not the typical heterosexual white male and don't get offended easily and don't have a problem with gay or interracial situations...I'm not in favor of tone it down either, but I do warn people when recommending it, that they might be uncomfortable with some of the story."

netflix,3cbod5,RodJohnsonSays,2,Mon Jul 6 20:44:15 2015 UTC,"Disagree. I love when a series shines light on inequalities and the lives of people who are different from myself, but this was too much. I felt like the plot took a backseat to the ""poverty/gender inequality"" message of the series. I stopped watching at episode 7 and as far as I know I made it further than all of my friends. All of my friends either found the sex unnecessary, the characters unrelatable, or the story convoluted.  Regardless, it came across as preachy to me too. So I think that is a valid argument."

netflix,3cbod5,WolfSheepAlpha,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:42:16 2015 UTC,"Uh, no. It's all about pushing the agenda the writers/producers want pushed, which annoys people to no end. No one wants propaganda thrown at them in obvious hunks.   Challenge yourself to do what? Watch poorly and unimaginatively written subplots that do very little to advance the plot? I'm fine with issues about poverty, gender and sexual identity, in my entertainment, but why put up with that if it's poorly written, obviously pushing the normalization agenda, and making a disproportionately huge deal of issues that should be contextual subplots?   It's shitty sci-fi. Good sci-fi introduces those issues in a way that's entertaining and usually subtle. Look at the Hugo and Nebula award winners over the last 60 years. Lots of them deal with these issues in smart, well written ways that bring up way more details and subtleties without forcing their audience to actively question why the writers keep harping on the gay acceptance like Sense8 does. Take Forever War for example. Tons of homosexual undertones. Yet not overly preachy."
netflix,3cbod5,RodJohnsonSays,0,Wed Jul 8 23:22:37 2015 UTC,"Its not supposed to be predominately sci-fi, ya dolt. Its a character-driven drama about people who are struggling through the world and how letting in other people can help us to see different perspectives and open our eyes to becoming better people.  The sci-fi elements are just to keep it interesting. At its core, its a story about people affecting other peoples lives."
netflix,3cbod5,WolfSheepAlpha,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:20:45 2015 UTC,"Which describes like every great sci-fi drama ever made...   Haha, I'm not saying it's Star Trek/Wars Science Fiction or anything like that. But... What you described is literally what science fiction is, and why so many people love that genre.   But, just for the sake of argument, you could take your definition of the show and apply it to Star Trek:TNG without even changing any of the words and it would be a perfect description of the show.   Also, given the writers and producers, and basic premise of the show, you gotta admit it's science fiction."

You still can't click on a thumbnail for more information. The funny thing to me is that Netflix is probably paying designers millions of dollars a year to design this trash.  I feel about the Netflix interface like I feel about Yahoo's mail interface. It's ludicrously complex for something where most people do exactly the same thing. Why can't you make that thing easy?  Simple = better.  There are two things people do with the Netflix interface 90% of the time: 1. Continue a show/movie 2. Browse around for new stuff to add to the queue  Okay, number 1 is generally easy enough. I'm going to ignore the fact that sometimes the thing I am watching is sorted to the end of my ""Continue Watching"" list.  But omfg is number 2 obnoxiously difficult.  Here, Netflix, I will give you a better design than your current design FOR FREE!!!  [image] [title] [blurb]  Clicking the image plays it. Clicking anything else takes the user to more information. THERE IS NO MOUSEOVER. THERE IS NO BULLSHIT SLIDING AROUND THE SCREEN.  If you want to make it even better, you could use Bootstrap's responsive grids so that there are three columns on high resolution displays, two columns on medium displays, and one column on mobile.  Show five movies for each category, and a ""see all"" link.

I've been learning French and in Canada everything here ends up dubbed and it's weird to watch. I stick to original French-language stuff.

The way they stay profitable is by creating good content.  That's what Victoria wanted at Reddit, which the admins did not want because they wanted profit at the expense of content.  At Netflix profit and content go hand in hand.  That's why it would be a good fit.  I think she could still crowdsource some questions before hand, but I think it would be more about the tone she sets, that it's an interview series akin to Charlie Rose, and then permanently available in Netflix's library.  It's not just about promoting an upcoming film.  It's about, in the true spirit of AMAs, getting to know the person and what's interesting about their life.  Obviously it wouldn't be an exact replica of an AMA, though live-streaming could be an interesting possibility Netflix could explore.

Some of the VPNs offer free trials from time to time, and some have a regular free option for limited use (but not that useful for Netflix because usually the free limited use is too slow or has too low a monthly limit for practical video watching). As others have said you should avoid Hola, and probably the ""free proxy"" lists as well, but a little internet searching will turn up lots of other options with DNS and VPN services.

If it's not funny the first time you're not going to hook people enough to go back and watch it a second time.  As for seasons 1 through 3, my all time favorite comedy series on TV ever. It's also close to my favorite TV show of all time... except I just bring myself to dethrone Breaking Bad for anything. It was just too perfect to me.

netflix,3bqrjz,BobbyD84,12,Wed Jul 1 16:25:55 2015 UTC,I gave up after a few episodes. That standalone Lindsay episode was horrible. This show worked because of the constant family interaction. I don't like the episodic feel of S4.

The format kind of reminded me of the older style of novels where the early chapters were just introducing the characters and laying the foundation for the story, with the plot spiraling closer and closer together as the story progresses.  So I'd say the episodes in the last season are more like chapters of a novel, and stopping after episode 3 is kind of like saying ""I got bored with Great Expectations after chapter 3, so I gave up on it."" :p.   TL;DR - give it another try!"

Those characters aren't nearly as funny on their own as they are when they have each other to balance each other out, that's where a lot of the humor in this show comes from and it wasn't there in season 4."
netflix,3bqrjz,lukelear,3,Wed Jul 1 16:47:22 2015 UTC,"I agree, but at the same time I wouldn't want to see that technique used again. The novelty was a big reason for why that was able to work.

A lot of companies and municipalities are going to be watching this to see how it goes, but depending on how broadly and strictly Chicago enforces it, you'll see a lot of challenges against it.  I'd bet Netflix sues over it if it seems like it will catch on. They lost a bunch of consumers the last time they had a price hike and this will look like the same thing."

netflix,3btnhd,alent1234,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:59:10 2015 UTC,"So you have one account with multiple profiles.   Each profile is set up for a different person. When you log into Netflix, log into your profile.   Your queue is a list of movies or shows that you have bookmarked, so you can go back and watch them without having to search again. Let's say you put The Office in your queue. It will stay there until you remove it, but will not appear in anyone else's profile. This is why the profiles are there, to separate everyone's ""to-watch"" list.   Rating isn't that important, sometimes you'll be prompted to rate a title so Netflix can recommend more, but if that shows up, it'll be self-explanatory.   When you see a show or movie you want to bookmark for later, click something along the lines of ""add to my list"" (don't use computer, not sure how it's worded) and it will appear in your queue. When you want to watch something, you can browse your queue to choose things you're interested in and wanted to save, or can browse by other categories."

When we began filming the show in 1992, we actually (except for maybe the pilot) considered HD all along. And so there was image and opportunity to expand and modify the aspect ratio. But the fact is these are all decisions made by 20th Century Fox, which I'm occasionally consulted on.

I watch content from both YouTube and Netflix and have no regrets from switching and have tried converting anyone I can.  Why?   It's cheaper Access to a lot of content when and where you want it Glorious layout and content placement tracking (Where Netflix remembers where you've watched up to on every program you have watched) Netflix original content seems to be aimed more towards my generation and tastes then most of what I see on the UK live TV.

netflix,3bhzg9,xasper8,0,Tue Jun 30 00:25:38 2015 UTC,This seems to be very good survey & results are expected... If the survey had been asked outside US & It had questions: Are you satisfied with your local netflix offering & do you use any other country's netflix(es)? I'd estimate most ppl like 4/5 would not be satisfied & 2/3 or at least 3/5 are unblocking some other Netflix... With Netflix unblocking the service is definitely worth it but without not really

They may not feel there is enough interest in the show to make the process worthwhile.  I wish they could all get along so these shows weren't just locked away for no one to see again.

Personally i think it was netflix shooting itself into its foot because they have very limited 4K/Ultra HD library even in US... So in 2-3 years it'd been resonable as there would be content in 4K and it would be worth paying for the more expensive plan. Yeah they increased the price to use that money to acquire Ultra HD Licenses but i think it was done way too early

You have access to pretty much every country with their premium service. They sometimes offer a three month free trial and afterwards you'll pay roughly €25 per year for that service when the software goes on sale.  It's a price you should consider paying.

So in this case it won't come to Netflix in Canada until after it's been on the Movie Network for 4 months.   Now if it's a indie movie or something that is very low budget or bad it could be on Netflix quickly.  Some low budget movies go to DVD/iTunes right away and then after only a month are on Netflix.    Also note, some movies will never come out on Netflix because they don't want to pay what the studio is asking.  Sometimes the movie will be on Netflix in Australia but not in Canada.  So you can get a service like UnBlock_Us to see the different regions Netflix has."

netflix,3bm8mx,IVIushroom,2,Tue Jun 30 11:34:43 2015 UTC,"A pilot episode in TV is the prototype or the first episode given to networks to evaluate if a network/cable company/etc would pick it up. It's called a pilot because it depends on it for the show to take flight and be given the budget to keep it going or given a red light to stop any further production. It has knotting to do with Netflix, it is a common concept I'm TV and other media (on a minor scale)."

It left the impression that she had descended into despair, when the reality is that she was both very wealthy AND very happy when she passed away.  My uncle was her attorney since 1986 and was credited multiple times during the credits. We were on (and attended) the guest list for the premier at Sundance plus the after party .. It was one of those once in a lifetime things that definitely needed to be taken advantage of.  The movie was incredible and when I looked over at my uncle towards the end, he was openly weeping. Miss Simone had such a great spark!!"
netflix,3bdbny,gnubian,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:41:23 2015 UTC,"That's beautiful man. Yeah, I think the film, like most docos and bio-pics, is meant to create an image of a tragic figure more than anything else, because that's really what makes these extraordinary people so compelling; the Icarus myth forever retold with our own stars.  It's good to hear she was happy and wealthy when she passed away. I remember the first time I ever heard one of her songs was this on an Aardman Animation video. I just fell in love with it immediately and her voice has randomly popped into stuff I've loved over the years, from Before Sunset to friends parties, lovers, birthdays and everything in between. I accidentally became a fan over a decade and I only knew bits and pieces of her story and seeing this doco just told me so much I did not know and broke my heart hearing how she was treated and her dedication."

Her mental unwellness created a very cold and harsh person, in my opinion.   Her preference that everyone in her audience give their undivided attention is understandable, but her demands that they sit down and shut up are not. What if the audience member has her own mental or physical limitation? ADHD can be debilitating, as can get own bipolar in an audience member.  She came off as being very unpleasant, even without going into the civil rights era (""Kill the whites,"" or whatever it was she said).   It was so frustrating that she stayed with an abusive husband and allowed herself to be worked so hard. Just sad.  It's okay if you don't agree with me. This is just my opinion. I'll continue to love her music, though."

For all of Hulu's problems, a much better selection of anime is pretty much the only aspect where it's superior to Netflix. Hell, fucking Crunchyroll is better in that regard."

Other companies are trying to compete with netflix by buying up exclusive streaming rights in their country.

netflix,3bds0c,5inthepink,3,Sun Jun 28 07:37:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would take a serious rethink of the entire business model. Look at music streaming, where there's no exclusivity like that, and most artists and albums are available on most services. Could you imagine if albums or artists were exclusively available on a single streaming platform? Music streaming would be dead."
netflix,3bds0c,divide_by_hero,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:22:20 2015 UTC,"Music streaming does have exclusives. For example here in the UK the Group Take That released their last album on Google's exclusively for a couple of months.  And when it comes to the actual point being made by the OP regional elements are still a major element in music streaming, There are tracks that spotify has that simply aren't available in every region for example, there is an option to show the unavailable tracks where a track that spotify has but not in your region will show up as greyed out, turn it on and search around and you will see plenty that isn't available.  And ultimately music and video are different things. Music has always been a customer facing business with the labels making the majority of their money from direct sales to the consumer. And they have a product where it makes sense to get paid per play so making sure as many people as possible can listen makes sense. A music track is only 2-5minutes long in general and is something you can listen to while your eyes focus on another task and doesn't really need thought about too much. It means it's perfectly possible to listen to that same track multiple times a day and get enjoyment out of it every time. Video less so, at its shortest it's a 20minute commitment and can be as up to 4 hours and it needs your commitment as it uses both your eyes and ears and does require some engagement of your conscious mind. You are less likely to go back and watch the video again that day and do so multiple times a day for a week or month. If you really likened it you may revisit it once a year but that means a per play basis doesn't work, the value is in initial deals themselves not per play rates and exclusivity bumps the value of these up significantly. The only time video has really ever been a customer facing business is the initial release of a movie but even then it's less a little getting more people watching it but getting the rate they pay higher. Have more people really gone to see Jurrasic World for example than went to see Jurrassic Park in the same period or is it just that ticket prices are so much higher now (and the content owners have squeezed the percentage the cinemas make from the tickets to further increase their own income)? I suspect as with the consumption of all media which is seeing a downturn as we have more options available to us the actual numbers of people are less even though the box office figures are higher. Video has generally always been a service facing business, it's about getting other customer facing business to pay to acquire the content and let them worry about getting people to consume it with the content owners not concerned as they have already made their money even if just 1 person consumes it.  And even if people started to watch the same video content over and over again in a day and continued to watch that same content every day for weeks or months changing it is still nigh on impossible because the production of the content is so much more complicated and expensive. Producing an album is relatively cheap, it's actually got cheaper as time has gone on as you can produce a release level album on consumer equipment in a home studio now.  Video hasn't got cheaper, while technology has made aspects of it cheaper video is still evolving so any savings are going on new enhancements, music however has pretty much reached its peak in the product evolving so production costs do just keep falling. As such video production is rarely some thing that's done by a single company, there are usually multiple companies involved and that in turn makes rights complicated as they are often split  between them so to acquire worldwide rights they would need to negotiate with two or more companies. You also see more and more joint commissions by outlets, for example Penny Dreadful is a joint commission by Showtime in the US and Sky in the UK. So while Netflix has been able to get the rights in some countries they can't in the UK as Sky pay for all the rights including streaming and in the US Showtimes rights restrict when Netflix could acquire it."

netflix,3b6tjz,efstajas,2,Fri Jun 26 19:08:15 2015 UTC,Yes and No.  Silverlight has some DRM which was adequate for the studios years ago but as Silverlights development was stopped years ago its far from secure now. The studios are generally only allowing it to still be used because there isn't another solution at this point unlike when  Flash stopped their development which is what pushed most of the rights holders to force the streaming firms to move to Silverlight in the first place. Its also why you can't do 1080p in the browser as Silverlights 1080p initial implementation came just before development was stopped and as such its pretty much a beta feature which the rights holders haven't and almost certainly won't ever sign off on the use of.  HTML5 is where they will eventually go but the DRM standards on that have not yet been agreed and finalised. Microsoft and Apple have done their usual thing and declared they won't be waiting or abiding by any standards so have done their own thing which is why IE11 in Win8 can do 1080p in the browser on almost every title and why Safari on atleats the latest MacOS can also do 1080p as their DRM has been signed off by most of the rights holders. All other browsers who will abide by the standards won't get signed off until after the standard is formalised

You see it with Wifi all the time. If you go to you local computer store and look for Wifi router or adaptor thats is of the AC standard you will still find plenty are labelled either 'pre-ac' or 'draft-ac'. That's the various manufacturers taking the draft of the standard thats to be debated and making devices using that as a base and adding their own things in a hope of it helping them to push what they want through.  It won't be too long until we start to see 'pre/draft AX' devices start hitting the market as thats the next step but they arent expecting to have that finalised until 2019.

With the Netflix split this is going to be especially true as analysts have talked for quite some time about it likely happening.  The debate was whether or not they wanted the small investors and a lot more day traders trading the stock as those investors can mess with momentum and cause shifts in price that may not have otherwise happened.  By keeping the stock price ""out of range"" of those investors, it means there will be a larger majority of institutional investors in the game who are more likely to take block positions and hold them for longer than the average small investor and day traders.  Obviously that's not as exciting as these hot, high volume, mid-range stocks.  It will be fun to watch what happens."

netflix,3b1x2y,thinkpadius,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:35:41 2015 UTC,What functionality are you missing on Chrome (with HTML5 player)?  It works fine for me.
netflix,3b1x2y,Etunimi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:07:12 2015 UTC,"Everytime I try to play a movie or TV show I get the black screen and it tells me I need the widevinecdm. (Which I have). I can browse for films without trouble.  I tried these possible solutions with no results:   I checked to make sure I had the latest edition (I do) I opened chrome as administrator with no result. I rebooted. I checked for the folder. I'm running windows 8.1   The thing is that - as I investigate it looks like Google says they're going to discontinue widevinecdm support on chrome very soon, if not already. The documentation about google's abandonment of widevinecdm and other NPAPI plugins is so new that it strikes me that this is a big deal, but all the issues I find online are from months and months ago.   Firefox and other browsers may still be able to handle netflix streaming but chrome might have issues.  And it might simply be an issue with which server I connect to on any given day or it might depend on whether certain films are switched over to non-NPAPI streaming plugins (meaning full html 5).  The problem is that I don't know if it's a local problem that I can fix on my chrome, a Google problem that will be fixed when they update chrome, or a Netflix problem because they need to get completely ready for non-NPAPI streaming.  It's strange, because I thought netflix had gone completely html 5 already and that this was a non issue.  So as you can see I'm trying to go through a process of elimination. If you could help that would be great.  Thanks :)"

Widewine CDM is not an NPAPI plugin. It is part of Chrome and does not need to be installed or updated separately.  Some initial troubleshooting steps I can think of:   Check chrome://plugins/ - ""Widewine Content Decryption Module"" should appear here, but only once. Its type should be ""PPAPI"", and at least in my case the version is 1.4.8.823 (the version number might depend on your platform, though). It should not be disabled. Check chrome://components/ - As far as I've understood, it should not show a Widewine CDM there if you are using the current Google Chrome (I don't have WidewineCdm there and Netflix works fine)."

netflix,3awzez,Pure_Entertainment,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:30:10 2015 UTC,"Well, as a rule of thumb, go for a VPN that has servers in all those countries where Netflix offers its services. PureVPN is one provider that matches that criteria. Plus, it is giving away 1 year free service too, on purchase of every 1 year account. There is even a blog on how to watch 21 top-rated movies of all time by unblocking different Netflix versions."

netflix,3aq350,IBMflamingo,-1,Mon Jun 22 23:37:02 2015 UTC,"Wow...  All of this Netflix hate is really disheartening. It's like you guys just don't even understand or appreciate how good this service really is.  I've been using Netflix Instant Streaming since it first began, and back then they were boasting over 10,000 titles on the service. I couldn't hazard a guess as to what it is now, but I can tell you that it's probably more content than both Amazon Prime and Hulu COMBINED.  So some of that content doesn't float your boat? Damn, that sucks. You know what also sucks? Amazon's UI. Want to try finding a movie to watch on Hulu? Might have a hard time.   Netflix is trying to please a wide variety of audiences, and that means that they won't always be adding titles that you enjoy. That also means that sometimes they will lose the content you do enjoy.   Do you know why? Because they literally don't have control over when a studio decides not to renew a contract with them. That's up to the studios and the owners of the content, not Netflix, who LEASES the right to STREAM the content to you.  I currently have THREE FULL QUEUES on Netflix, brimming with content that I have either seen before and would enjoy watching again, or content that I have never seen and want to see at some point. If you didn't know, that's roughly 1500 titles total.   I have access to 1500 movies and television shows that I would enjoy watching, and do you know how much that costs me? Less than $10 a month. Is there any other service out there that can boast anything even remotely close to this? No. No there is not. I have used Hulu and I am currently a Prime subscriber, and I can confirm that there is literally no other streaming service that even comes close to providing the sheer amount of content that Netflix provides.  Boo hoo, Netflix didn't add that movie that LITERALLY JUST CAME OUT yet. Too bad. That's not the way these streaming sites work, and it never will work that way. The studios have too much invested in these movies and television shows to just lease out their newest and best content to Netflix mere MONTHS after its release. There's a reason that it is a rarity to see a movie or TV show produced within the last year on their service – it isn't necessarily because the content is too expensive, it's because the studios/owners of the content are not willing to go that route until they've explored every other avenue of making money.  Maybe before you whine and complain about not getting exactly what you wanted, you should actually do some research into how this all works and try to appreciate what Netflix actually does for their customers, because there is literally no other game in town that does quite as much as they do. Everyone else is either playing a different game entirely (Hulu) or is fighting so hard to play catch up with Netflix that they've forgotten to update their actual service (Amazon).  If you can't find something worth watching on Netflix, that is LITERALLY your own damn fault. Maybe you should try to be more open to new experiences and try watching something you otherwise wouldn't have considered? Who knows, you might just discover that you really like a certain sub-genre of movie, or that the TV show that only kinda/sorta looked interesting was actually friggin' fantastic.   So many movies come out in a year that I can GUARANTEE you haven't seen everything worth seeing that was produced in the last 5-10 years. You don't have to limit what you watch to ONLY NEW CONTENT. EXPLORE! Netflix is FANTASTIC for exploration, and if you aren't willing to do so, it's your own fault for having such limited vision. If Netflix is too ""big picture"" for you, then I say good riddance."

But, yes, it is a strong satire of horror films.   To me, the best horror films do have a good sense of humor to them. It just has more than most. :)  Consider: Sean of the Dead, Army of Darkness, Scream, Return of the Living Dead, etc.  Hmmm. I wonder if I should have recommended Zombeavers? :)  PS: Be sure to watch the original Day of the Dead. The remake is not nearly as good.

But it is a big step back in usability for keyboard and mouse and higher resolution monitor users.  It is not even a case of new UI requiring some getting used to.

I want to browse the shows episodes and info at times to check some updates or comments.  Another small gripe. I want finer player tracking. Sometimes I need to rewind due to not hearing what they say in a show. I do not need to go back 5 minutes just 30 seconds.   Also I am getting digital stuttering in audio and video in Netflix.

netflix,3an1uo,Skarekrows,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:41:10 2015 UTC,"Update 6/27/2015   I found the issue for my personal PC's stutter issue. For several Years I ran my Asus P5Q w/4gigs ram and a Core 2 Quad on Win XP. I switched to Win 7 2 years ago. And had used the Baked in driver for my Intel ICH10 Family 6 port SATA AHCI Driver that came with Win 7 (And had recently installed this driver before my initial post when this started happening). In Win XP I used the most up to date Sata driver on Asus Site and noticed a few months ago it was also flagged for Win 7. So I installed it on Win 7, about 1 month prior to the issue coming up, not thinking about it much more.  Fast forward to the time I made my initial post. I jerked my power supply out and swapped with a spare. Swapped video cards back to a 9800GTX from a 450GTS. (Believe it or not the 9800 is at least as fast as the 450 if not more so.) I tested all my hardware and was left scratching my head. Thinking its my Motherboard. But did not panic. I started thinking what I personally did to frig it up. The only thing standing out was the SATA driver.  Then one night I noticed accessing my Hard Drives lagged. Then I recalled that when accessing my PC over the network that my machine appeared to act as if the drive was asleep. And it took a minute for the drive being accessed to wake up. I had not ever seen this issue on Win XP only with the Power Settings in Win 7. Then I noticed that the spin down of my discs, you can feel them kick down due to my machine sitting by my right hand side of the keyboard, and hear the spin down as well. This spin down matched perfectly to the stutter. Putting two and two together......Sata Driver in relation to Power Management.   Win 7 has a 20 Min Timer on all power settings for Hard Drives to sleep. The Asus OEM driver I had installed recently, has a conflict in the Waking and Sleeping portion of the code. When Sleeping or Waking, if any media is playing, it will stutter. The Microsoft Driver for Sata channels, does not have this issue.   To date I had Reinstalled Win 7 x64. I deal with used PC parts so I swapped my video card and PSU. I memtest86+ my ram. I get many power flickers where I am and deal with Power Loss a lot. Its just part of Rural Living. And I thought my board was finally, after 7 years, dieing.  Its not.  It was the Sata Driver conflicting with Power Management of the Hard Drives. (I have 6 drives in my PC and I would get a lot of stutter per drive cycle)  Solution.....Use Microsofts SATA Driver. OR set Hard Drives to Not Sleep under Power Management. (My Wife used to complain about how it took so long to access my Machine from her machine due to the sleep function across the network) I use my Machine as the Family Server as well so as you can imagine it was a pita."

Imagine Sliders meets Hearts in Atlantis (Stephen King story with the Low Men) meets Twin Peaks.  It's very Dark Tower-esq and simply phenomenal.  I had all of 3 problems with the entire movie and that's mostly due to the time constraints.  A TV show would do the theme and story FAR more justice.  It would be a 10/10 movie if it were 6 hours long and explained EVERYTHING.  As a prequel to a Series of tv/movies...it's almost perfect.  Go.  Add to List.  Watch.  Seriously good.

netflix,3aohs1,wakey87433,2,Mon Jun 22 09:14:56 2015 UTC,The risk of a using a DNS server to access other regions is the DNS provider can route all your traffic for certain sites to phishing sites that look like the site you are after but capture all your info.   However the risk of that is worse on free DNS codes you find on the net rather than a paid service from a legit company like unblock-us.

netflix,3aohs1,Jungies,-1,Mon Jun 22 17:11:30 2015 UTC,"I'm using SmartyDNS - you pay for it ($40 per year), you set your modem/router's DNS server to theirs, and all of your Netflix/Hulu/Amazon content thinks you're in the U.S.  Since it only routes US content overseas, all of the rest of your Aussie stuff comes direct from Australia (meaning that it's quicker than a VPN), and you can switch to other regions at will. However, our beloved PM's new data retention policy means he (and any interested police officer/rights holder) can see what you're up to.   A VPN is better from that aspect, but Netflix etc. may be able to see if your device is using a VPN, and cancel your service. Android's Netflix app (for example) needs the permission to see your network connection details, before it will run.   Lastly, remember if you're not paying for a service, then you are the thing being sold. Stick with one that you pay for, as the free ones tend to make use of your internet connection for their own purposes (Hola for example)."

I gave it every opportunity to engage me... it did not -.-  I just watched and liked Ascension last night, its another short show(6 parts), which I tend to shy away from because it really limits time to develop story and characters, but this one did it ok. Its not the best, but it really has a lot of potential, and really caught me off guard.  Lost is really good. Its a show that almost anyone can watch because its never really limited by your imagination. Anything can, and will, happen. Tons of drama, supernatural, science, comedy, love... the whole ""She-bang"" (and that might be the first time I've ever used such a word D:)  Psych is great because it combines quite a bit of comedy into its drama and uses tons of literary devices to engage you into the stories. The main character makes tons of references to 80s and 90s movies who's actors tend to, and most of the time, show up into the show for a bit of fun   Grace and Frankie is ok too, nothing you wouldn't really suspect out of the shows premise but still decent none-the-less  Turn is pretty good too if you are into historical dramas with a bit of action. Very different type of historical drama than something like Downton Abbey, with another good bit of potential. In the same type of catagory Peaky Blinders is pretty damn good, and the same with Marco Polo. Two shows I can't wait for more of.  I really like Blacklist because it plays into my interest of believable and actual supervillain type people. Might not be for you, but I think its got some solid writing and acting in it.  Some other favorites of mine that I recommend anyone check out would be Sherlock for the mystery, Caprica for the sci-fi lover, especially if battlestar gallactica caught your attention, and Better off Ted, The IT crowd, and Eureka for the nerdy/geekyness in all of us"

The only real thing that bugs be is removal of separate pages for titles. It shows that Netflix is either wholly uninterested in PC users, or just doesn't understand how people browse on PCs (which would explain some aspects of their new design...)"
netflix,3aiwkk,iswantingcake,4,Sat Jun 20 23:51:16 2015 UTC,"That's the really my biggest issue with this.  It's now drastically more annoying to navigate Netflix the way I do, especially when viewing TV shows.  The new design seems nicer, but since they stripped away what I now realized were very important features to me, it's a disgusting pain to use."
netflix,3aiwkk,xipheon,20,Mon Jun 22 01:01:03 2015 UTC,"I've seen people bashing on the new layout, I doesn't understand why.    I used the individual detail pages a lot; the lack of them is pretty terrible.  In a desktop browser with mouse+keyboard it's faster to navigate individual pages for separate content than expand and collapse and click-to-scroll different elements. You now can't get a list of all episodes in a show's season on a single page, have to click the side scroll buttons after expanding it (there's a reason no reasonable website uses horizontal scrolling in the browser, and making you click instead of pulling the scrollbar to scroll horizontally is the worst possible version of an already-bad thing). Have to click a couple extra times to get to the now-truncated episode list in the first place = objectively worse. Episode list now puts the short synopsis of the episodes right in your face.  Old episode list just displayed the titles. There tons of empty space between rows of titles that is only used for the expand-on-hover thing, which is itself difficult to use as it moves other elements to the side around.  The empty space looks like it totals about a quarter of screen space. The images for titles are larger, taking up more space and requiring more scrolling, both vertically and horizontally. Same as above for the category names.   Only real improvement is that clicking to scroll categories sideways is faster than the old method, but it's still inferior to using scrollbars... and forcing it for viewing a list of episodes more than counteracts that, when previously you could just get a vertical list of episodes on a single page.  It's basically a layout tailored to holding a remote and using arrows or a game pad or something, with mouse+keyboard it's pretty much all extra clicks and taking extra screen space."
netflix,3aiwkk,Messy-Recipe,21,Sun Jun 21 02:26:34 2015 UTC,"It's flat. That's my problem with it. Well the streaming view is anyway, DVD still has pages that link to each-other. What I mean is that if you're looking at similar suggestions, or for example Terminator 2 and wondering about the first Terminator, there is no link to those. You either play the suggestions immediately or not.  Example, go look under Terminator 2, open the info thing under it and ""more like this"". ""Oh, Big Trouble In Little China, how did I miss that it looks awesome!! I'd like more info about this movie."" How do you get more info? You type ""Big Trouble In Little China"" into the search box. That is a terrible user interface.  Another one people have mentioned is there is no longer a flat list of episodes for TV shows. Try navigating around Futurama, it's pretty awkward really.  Edit: words."
netflix,3aiwkk,greenthumble,13,Sat Jun 20 18:39:22 2015 UTC,"Those are the points that I'm struggling with, as well. Especially the full series view. ""More like this"" is now basically useless. I also miss the info on the last time I watched it and what episode is up next.  Seems like way more clicks to do things now. The dark look is fine, matches the apps on tablets and STBs, but I miss some basic functionality that was there before. I suppose, as with all things, I'll get used to it in time, and hopefully Netflix may address some of the shortcomings in updates."

netflix,3aiwkk,greenthumble,16,Sat Jun 20 19:43:59 2015 UTC,"Um I am NOT talking about design. AT ALL. I'm talking about the representation of the data that is Netflix. Movies make a natural graph (a node graph not a bar or line graph). Directors should link to a list of other movies they directed. Actors likewise. More suggestions should link to more info.  That is what I mean by flat. Things don't link. The freaking web was designed for that shape of data and Netflix is doing a terrible job, sorry."

Actors likewise.   All names when opening the information panel and also the details tab, are linking to what you say it doesn't do. I click on the directors name, it finds all movies directed by that person.   More suggestions should link to more info.   The ""more like this"" tab on the other hand, you can't bring up the information panel for that movie, just add it to your list or play it. Sure, that is a little annoying."

Badly zoomed reviews (clearly designed for a tv) means lots of scrolling. Used to be able to read several on the page without scrolling, now you have to scroll like crazy to get through even one.  The ""look"" of it is fine.. they made it darker..ok, but taking away features that work well on a pc, and making everyone share the crappy tv/console site is just lazy.  Oh, and as I just found out, if you let a show pause and timeout, like, say.. to go check on something you're cooking, when you come back and hit refresh, rather than starting right where you left off.. it freaking takes you back to the main menu! WTF?"
netflix,3aiwkk,crossfire87,10,Sun Jun 21 02:40:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's absolutely awful. What makes them think taking away options and information is an improvement? They keep dumbing down Netflix as if I'm a five year old child and the only thing I'm capable of is slapping my hands on a screen when I see something I like. No, damn you, I have a mouse and keyboard, I'm not afraid of reading or using a web page LIKE A WEB PAGE and not like a crappy mobile site. I don't understand how a company with this much money can't provide decent options and sorting filters. I feel like the only people who like this kind of crap exclusively use tablets or something. Seriously considering unsubbing, but I know that's just a drop in the bucket to them and from what I've heard here, they couldn't give a hot shit about my opinion anyway."

It was not where any article told me it should be. I've been looking for this option for years and never once seen it. Maybe it's not supposed to be a feature in the Canadian version?  Anyway, I finally found a link to the specific setting page and I was able to make it work. For anyone else in the same predicament, it's: https://www.netflix.com/MyListOrder?fullpage=true  I'm guessing the service rep didn't tell me about this cuz technically I'm not supposed to have access to it for whatever reason.

It had links to imdb and rotten tomatoes pages, a random episode button for shows, the ability to make all the categories have a drop down button to show all, so no sideways scrolling required. You could hide or just fade out movies you've seen, change the background color, and many more options. It doesn't work with the new interface, and the new interface really isn't any better than the old one. So yeah I don't like the new layout at all."

Now, when I click on a movie, there are stupid tabs separating everything (overview, episodes, more like this, details), and reviews are two clicks away (details, then See All Reviews).  It's poor design.

netflix,3aiwkk,xaxen8,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:34:46 2015 UTC,I can see how there are some improvements and I can see how some things are worse. I guess you just have to weigh the good with the bad and decide which one comes out on top. You can like the new scrolling which is admittedly better but if you were like me you'd always been in the genres that doesn't have scrolling so it was never a bother anyway. So for you this is a good welcome change that makes the redesign more positive but for me it adds nothing.  I won't bother you with all my complaints though. :)

netflix,3aiwkk,6594933,-7,Sat Jun 20 19:04:55 2015 UTC,I'm certain Netflix tested the new website and confirmed it was a net positive overall before rolling it out. The people vocally complaining about the site are likely a minority.

netflix,3aiwkk,anyuferrari,0,Sun Jun 21 14:31:29 2015 UTC,"I think it is perfectly fine. In all honesty it looks very similar to the Netflix app main screen on the Xbox One. Dark theme, same side scroll etc.  I actually prefer it, maybe I've just being predisposed to it, if anyone knows whether the Xbox One UI was updated at the same as the web version let me know.   Side note, I am using Netflix on Xbox One in Australia, while using Netflix web version based in the US. So I haven't done the Aussie web version as a comparison (and won't either, you buggers have a bigger library than us)."

netflix,3aiwkk,yolo-yoshi,11,Sat Jun 20 18:11:14 2015 UTC,"As someone who doesn't like the new interface, I'm annoyed by that stupid characterization of me, and others like me.  I like the old way of scrolling better, since it allowed me to continuously browse titles at a steady pace, without going ""a page"" at a time. It's why I prefer a large webpage to just be on one page, where I can choose how fast to scroll, as opposed to ""slides"" that snip the info in separate chunks and force you to click to read on.  I also preferred the vertical titles. It allowed the screen to display many more titles at once, side-by-side. Since I normally browse one category at a time, it's much less important how many categories vertically can be displayed at once, but displaying lots of titles horizontally was really nice.   Also, there's a large amount of dead, empty space between the categories. Completely useless, wasted space. Especially since horizontally, there are less movies displayed per category, this loss of useful screen space is extra annoying.  Worst of all: there are no choices! If the new interface was somehow optional, e.g. the advanced options allowing different scrolling or different tiling, it wouldn't be so bad. On the PC, there's only one way to consume Netflix content: their website. With any other type of media consumption, especially pirating, you have so many choices of behaviour and interface of how to consume video, that makes it extra annoying that Netflix forces these changes in you, in my opinion making it less efficient to browse videos, without allowing the user some choice.  Even Youtube, on whose interface there's tons of complaints, allows embedding and playback in VLC."

I realize VLC won't happen soon because DRM. It would still be nice though. And I'm still holding some hope, because when iTunes started out, the notion of DRM-free music seemed impossible because the publishers wanted nothing to do with it. Now you can download DRM-free MP3s from them.   I don't need a download option from Netflix because I'm still well-versed in my (pre-Netflix) pirating ways if need be (I download GoT from the pirate bay, despite having HBO, including HBO Go, just because their website is complete shit) but at least some customization options would be nice.  After all, the reason I switched from piracy to Netflix is convenience, not ethics."
netflix,3aiwkk,TheRufmeisterGeneral,-3,Sat Jun 20 23:40:27 2015 UTC,I like it.  I normally watch an episode or two of something before I go to bed on a smart TV so now the website looks just like the Netflix app.

However both employees claimed that the issue was known and fixable, although their solutions didn't do the trick.  So if you chat / call the customer service, tell them that those approaches don't yield positive results.  Another lead that might be causing the issue - they said - is my using a proxy, namely the Hola Better Internet Chrome extension.

That being said at least for the few minutes I listened I couldn't tell a difference at all, maybe my speakers just aren't good enough.

The Chromecast thing itself is a little USB stick looking gizmo that plugs into the HDMI port on your TV and connects to your Wi-Fi.  You then control it almost exclusively from an Android device although there's some other ways like through some chrome browser extensions and such.

netflix,3ahrj9,kbv510,2,Sat Jun 20 18:23:33 2015 UTC,"To be honest, and a lot less funny, yeah.  IE isn't that bad by any means but it's still not quite there with Chrome or Firefox so it still just collects dust tucked away in the depths of my start menu.  Now at least it gets to come out and see the daylight occasionally, just has to wear a disguise when it does.  As for why would you ""go through all that"", well the better question is why wouldn't you?  If you are confident enough to edit your registry you end up with something that can't be reproduced any other way yet.  One day they may make the windows 8 app resizable, but today you have it with this. Ditto for fully functional keyboard controls and the better web interface.

However, 2:3 pulldown results in an exactly 1 - (2+3) / (2 * 2) = 25% increase in frame rate. Since the target rate is 29.97 fps (59.94 Hz field rate), either the original 24fps content is slowed down to 23.976fps or the content is recorded originally in 23.976fps already instead of 24fps.

netflix,3akukn,_Mithi_,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:48:24 2015 UTC,"Well, it ends with internet streaming like Netflix :).

Though not all streaming services are as good with regard to this (e.g. HBO Nordic streams the 25fps sped-up versions of U.S. shows).  I imagine the original reasoning to do HDTV like this (instead of doing progressive 24fps or 30ps or whatever) is to avoid timing issues when showing old SD content or when downscaling for SDTV version of the channel.  BTW, at least with the U.S. system your TV can perform live inverse telecine to recover the 23.976fps progressive content from the 59.97Hz video (not sure if this is common, but I've seen the option in my TV settings at least).

netflix,3ag5ae,c0mbobreaker,14,Sun Jun 28 16:38:55 2015 UTC,Worth noting they probably wont do weekly releases for any of their original shows like oitnb. This is weekly simply because it's a currently airing Canadian TV show that Netflix has streaming rights to. Whatever agreement they have states that every episode can be released online after it airs on TV on the west coast. That's why the netflix release goes up early in the AM.  It is interesting though because that's basically the Hulu model. I wonder if they will grab rights to other shows and do the same thing. Probably not for the current sub price...
netflix,3ag5ae,wakey87433,5,Fri Jun 19 23:27:43 2015 UTC,I can see them doing more things like this because to reach the amount of original content they want they are going to need to do more of these co-commissions which will usually mean teaming up with a conventional broadcaster like they have here or have with AMC for Better Call Saul and in such a case they only have the choice of going along with the traditional broadcasted schedule or waiting until after the traditional broadcaster has aired them all

netflix,3ag5ae,wakey87433,4,Sat Jun 20 15:00:22 2015 UTC,"Why do people always seem to want a group of kids left to their own devices to act sensibly in such situation. People brought up the same issue about The 100.  These are after all people under 22 most with no life experience and the few who have its very limited. And any experience they do have isn't really in areas that it would really be useful and you will always have competing ideas of what is the right thing to do.    I don't know if you have been watching the NBC show 'The Island' or any of the seasons of the UK originals but if you had you would see even adults with life experience and skills that might be useful will keep making the wrong decision, the group will back the ideas of the wrong people and the likes. So there is actual documented evidence that supports the fact that kids in such a survival situation would really only make the right decision when they lucked into it rather than by design"
netflix,3ag5ae,Starrystars,19,Fri Jun 19 23:34:10 2015 UTC,It just that literally no one is really concerned about what happened. They're all concerned about petty shit.

netflix,3ag5ae,wakey87433,-4,Fri Jun 19 23:45:36 2015 UTC,"The deaths are going to impact the older kids more than the younger ones as the younger ones won't fully understand what's going on.

netflix,3ag5ae,Starrystars,8,Sat Jun 20 00:53:58 2015 UTC,Young kids know when something serious is going down. it's not like they could have been hidden from all the adults dieing.

netflix,3ag5ae,wakey87433,-2,Sat Jun 20 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"There is a difference though between knowing something is going on and actually fully comprehending it. It's our understanding of a situation that makes it traumatic, the younger kids may miss their family for a day or so but until they fully understand death they are likely to just brush it off and go back to having fun with their friends.   Even with the older ones they are being told it's under control and the quarantine will end soon so it's not even as if they are having to really think about the future at this point. Most haven't any reason not to trust the adults on the outside so have no reason to question them at this point. A few already have and more are coming around to that and you would expect as time goes on more and more should start to question it and a cohesive unit start to come together but the cliques and self interest are unlikely to go away"

I just don't think the kids actions are a valid stick to beat it with because it's expecting a group of kids with almost no life experience and certainly no experience in running a town to go from having to go from almost having nothing to do for themselves to having to not only take complete control of their lives but also form a cohesive unit with no ego, no cliques and where the right people are given the right jobs. It wouldn't even be real if it was everyone under 22 were the ones who died because adults who have the required experience and skills rarely work together for the greater good, there is always egos and self interest.   Clearly the leader should be the black kid rather than the jock but the black kid is somewhat of the outsider and doesnt seem to want to lead where as the jock is the popular kid and has an ego that makes him feel entitled to be the leader so of course people will flock around the jock and prop his leadership up even if ultimately every decision he makes seems to be hot headed and the wrong one.

Even adults with more usable skills and experience who have prepared for the situation make equally as stupid decision and get involved in petty squabbles.   As I said go watch either the UK original version of Bear Grylls ’The Island’ (The first couple of episodes of both the men and women's island of season 2 shows both aspects perfectly) or the US version. The Island isn't survivor, it's a group of people dumped on an island with only what's on their back and some cameras and left to their own devices so while it will get labeled a reality show it's closer to a documentary and this shows how even smart people can and will make dumb decision after dumb decision. Hey even survivor in early episodes shows this where rather than banding together to make the right decision so their tribe can succeed before it becomes every man/women for themselves at the merge shows this.  Or for that matter just look at any government to see how the right decision is often the one that isn't taken and petty squabbles undermine everything"
netflix,3ag5ae,voiderest,2,Sat Jun 20 09:17:55 2015 UTC,Dumb kids doing dumb things with drama is what I would expect from the description.

netflix,3agtat,BradDoGFX,3,Sat Jun 20 01:19:35 2015 UTC,"""Like"" regarding television shows is very subjective.  I have no problem understanding some people will really hate shows I really like.  I really didn't like this show for the same reasons you appear to like it.  It was slow (too slow) and too generic/cliche for my tastes.  I appreciate shows that are naturally different and boundary-pushing. This one seemed too forced.    To be honest, I couldn't watch past the first episode.  Okay so it was slow to introduce people to the characters.  As I started to get to know the characters, I found I had zero interest in them.  I had zero interest if any of the characters survived to the next episode.  IMO, a television show needs to grab people in the first episode... make you interested in the characters irregardless of how good or bad the nature of the person is.  I've read reviews and even spoilers of the following episodes and feel my concerns linger through at least half of the series if not all the way to the end.  I have zero interest in watching anymore.

netflix,3ahne2,Dystopian_Dreamer,8,Sat Jun 20 14:18:36 2015 UTC,"Problems I'm having with the new interface:  With the old interface I could open up shows in a new tab. I would browse through the list, open anything that I found interesting in a new tab and then look through the tabs to decide what I should watch. The new interface doesn't seem to allow this. If you click on a show it just expands the options for that show, unless you click on the wrong place then it just starts playing that show. I then need to browse back and it kicks me to the top of the page instead of where I was.  The icons for the shows are even smaller then they were. I have a TV that's connected to a computer and that's how I watch the majority of my Netflix. I could barely see the writing on the descriptions of the shows before the redesign, now it's all but impossible. Sure it's fine if you're at a computer, but if you're browsing from across the room (like I am when I'm on my couch looking at the TV) it's very hard to make out what I'm looking at. The scrollover text (Description, etc) also went from being black on a white background to white on whatever color the screen shot for the show is. Much harder to read.  They haven't made browsing for a show any easier. It was hard before, it's just as hard now.  TL;DR - No imporvements, less functionality."

I have like 400 shows/movies in my watchlist which means for me to see anything that isn't in the top 10 or bottom 10 it's ""faster"" for me to simply search for the title - which complete negates the usefulness of having a watchlist in the first fucking place.

To navigate a series, you can only see 3-4 episodes at once, need to click to scroll, and have a synopsis forced on you. Titles suggested in 'more like this' can only be played - you can no longer get information about them. Video advertisements for some shows have been inserted before some titles. Still advertisements are now shown instead of the next episode on many TV series (I confirmed this with support today - only some users are being tested so far. I can no longer watch The IT Crowd without adverts between each episode.) The inserted advertisements are causing multiple tab errors on many browsers, forcing logout/login before you are able to watch the next episode.   Personally, I don't care about look and feel, but they have removed tons of functionality with this update.    Make sure you give them feedback if you're unhappy with it."

netflix,3ael2r,Adolf_,3,Fri Jun 19 18:32:59 2015 UTC,"If anybody asks you for feedback, please include that the new design is absolutely horrible for people with low vision (I've talked to them already about it, but I doubt it did any good). At the very least, there should be an option to go back to the old format (like a theme or something). I hate everything about the new design, not being able to see the whole episode list for a season without scrolling, the way the pop ups flare out at you, the scrolling ads  for new shows (they make me dizzy), the 'box art' or icons of the shows are smaller--and they were already difficult for me to read. And it's ALL way too DARK.  edit to add about the new design being so dark  If it doesn't improve I'll have to leave because it's so hard for me to use."
netflix,3ael2r,pieala,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:31:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's annoying when you're scrolling through and the squares pop out when you have your cursor over them..   It's a good try, I guess. It looks somewhat more ""sleek and modern"" with the greyish background, and it's kinda nice that you don't have to keep your mouse at the edge of the movie list to get the line moving."
netflix,3acdp9,KinneKitsune,10,Thu Jun 18 23:27:00 2015 UTC,"I'm under the impression that netflix has decided their recommendation engine isn't that important and they'd rather push what's popular by geography. The main reason I say that is because of their algorithm optimization contest back in 2009.  They paid out $1M bucks to whoever could improve matches by 10%(Contest called NetflixPrize). They later dumped all of the research and said it didn't really matter in the long run in terms of customer retention and approval. It costs a lot of money to run the backend services that build recommendations and comb through peoples viewing habits to find patterns. I'd guess however the new recommendations are done is much much simpler than it use to be.  The only personal example I have is that I enjoy few animes. I find most to have to much fan service, and the repetition in the start/end of episodes bugs me. But whenever I do watch one, for two weeks or so anime is all over my recommendation pages. I had gone through and 1 starred every anime thats cover was a busty woman in skimpy clothes but they're still there. Eventually they go away during times I watch very few. Last week I rewatched one episode of Attack on Titan and they're all back again."

At this point, the main reason I keep marking shit suggestions 1 star is to increase my high score of titles rated."

If it was ever going to have ended up on Netflix it would have been during that period where it didn't have a broadcaster which has seen it being a season behind but I'm guessing WB wanted to sell first run rights and Netflix didn't feel it provided value for money

And it's not Netflix who has ideas, but the writers/creators; Netflix is only there to decide whether or not they want to commission those ideas.  Regarding the statement that ""[n]othing new Netflix has developed in the past 18 months has gotten as much acclaim and buzz as Amazon's Transparent,"" while Marvel's Daredevil hasn't received critical acclaim as universal as Transparent has, it has at the very least received the same (if not even larger) amount of buzz."

I see advertising as an announcement that you need to convince people your product is worthwhile because nobody wants to buy it. The closest I like to get to an ad is seeing an announcement, such as a reddit post stating that a game has been announced, or that the first trailer of a movie is up on YT. From there I will decide if it might interest me, and if so I will then look for information, usually a gameplay trailer, or first-look."

From their long term view webpage:   We don’t and can’t compete on breadth of entertainment with Comcast, Sky, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Sony, or Google.

netflix,3a6heh,Cbebop21,7,Wed Jun 17 18:16:33 2015 UTC,"Like I replied over there, I had seen them on Lost; IIRC it is a line saying that the car company paid for the closed captioning.  Working in production myself, in all honesty it is probably left there by laziness.   They probably just copied the subtitles they had from the show provided by the content producers, and threw them in without editing them at all.   If you pay close attention every show on broadcast TV says at some point who the captioning was paid for by, and if you really want to get nit-picky the captioning company also puts ads at the end of every single episode(saying that they did the captioning and if you need it on your production contact them)."
netflix,3a6heh,Furiou5,6,Wed Jun 17 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"As I wrote above, it's just four lines of text acknowledging that Ford helped provide the closed captions for that particular episode and one of them reads ""Have you driven a Ford lately"" or something to that effect; it hardly constitutes third-party advertising. Netflix in the US is legally bound to provide closed captions for all of its content and closed captioning is not done free of charge."

netflix,3a6heh,MistaB784,-2,Wed Jun 17 18:45:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. Then I paid 50 dollars for a year of service with a VPN and filled an external usb drive with tons of content.   I now have all my favorite movies and tv shows on my tv for free.   Netflix is a great price, but why should they get more money? What would be added? If I'm not getting more why would Netflix get more?   They do their shows on low budgets. They have obvious long product placement segments in their newer shows.   Why should I give you more money for that? Unless I see a Game of Thrones caliber show, with the money behind it and no product placement,  I won't be paying more.  I don't give you money first with the promise of content worth it. You provide me with great content I don't want to loose.  House of Cards is great, but it ain't worth commercials or more money.   I will pay and not torrent provided they give me a good service for a fair price. They do that now. When they stop I stop paying."
netflix,3a6heh,kaderick,9,Wed Jun 17 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"It wasn't free, you stole those shows. Most shows can be watched online with ads via the broadcast website or Hulu. Or paid for commercial free via Netflix, iTunes, Amazon, or DVD purchases. You even purposely paid for a service so you would not get caught stealing instead of giving money to content providers.   Now for some networks like HBO who don't provide a streaming service or an easy way to get digital downloads I encourage torrents.  I make minimum wage and am a broke as fuck college student. Besides HBO I find the money to legally watch every piece of television and movies.  There is little excuse to steal in this day and age.  Stop being a cheap fuck and pay for the entertainment you receive. If you can't afford it, go play in a park or rent something from the library."

I want to watch game of thrones from HBO, so why should I have to pay Time Warner for a subscription which gives money to a bunch of other corporations for content I don't want or need.  I need to pay all of them, before I'm allowed to pay HBO for the show that I want.    I was unaware of HBO's new streaming service through apple, and that it will not be an Apple exclusive in a couple of months.  Now that their service is rolled, out, there is no excuse.  If you feel Game of Thrones is worth $15/month, then that's what you should pay for it.  If not, wait to buy a used DVD copy for $15 in a year or two which is what you should do instead of torrenting."

What you are saying is that entertainment should only be availble for the people who make a good income? Poor people should go play in the park. Corproate greed is A-okay because its their content they should be able to price gouge you all they want.  I completly disagree. I believe torrents are the answer to their greed and the only way to keep them in check. Do you think you would be paying the prices you currently pay on music if it wasn't for the P2P networks?"
netflix,3a6heh,shicken684,2,Wed Jun 17 18:33:22 2015 UTC,charging money for a provided service is greed but justifying your own illegal copying of something that isn't yours isn't greed   lmao this fucking site

They still have to pay people to work on sets, build the sets, set up the lighting, run the cameras, write the scripts, do the make up and wardrobe.  Those are all pretty well paying jobs that millions rely on.  So yeah, you're not just stealing from some fat cat CEO, you're stealing form the boom operator and all the dozens and/or thousands of people working on that project.    The Book of Mormon is coming to town and I've been dying to watch it again.  Tickets are well over $100 and I think it will be worth every penny that I've spent the past few months saving up for.  It takes a lot of fucking effort to put on a production like that and they deserve to be paid well.

It's part of the world we live in.  There is probably corporate greed at the VPN service you purchased or from the cereal company you bought your breakfast from.  That's systemic problem with our culture and current system of laws that protect the greed.  They are operating within the bounds of our laws so why shouldn't they make as much money as they can?  That's what our culture tells them to do.    Has the price of music really changed?  I remember a CD costing about $10-$15 for a brand new release in the 90's.  After a month or two you could snag it for $5-8.  Now a digital download is around $8-12 or a few bucks more if you want an actual CD.  About 30% cheaper when accounting for inflation but CD's are much cheaper to produce now, and a digital download cost almost nothing."

netflix,3abpvj,lucasbaker,0,Thu Jun 18 20:21:16 2015 UTC,"No. You do know that Netflix doesn't really have creative input in it's originals, it's just makes bids for production companies that offer their series? So in some cases when first script is written, it's not even clear if series is going to appear on Netflix or in some other channel. So Netflix Universe doesn't really make sense."
netflix,3abpvj,IndyBrodaSolo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:32:32 2015 UTC,"Not really true. As the commisioning outlet they have as much creative input as they want. Yes when they bid on content there will often be a pilot script and a treatment for the season or even the whole show that is being shopped around but the scripts being shopped around often change before a frame is shot based on the input from the outlet that does end up commisioning it. It just seems from the way those associated with the shows talk that Netflix chooses to not involve themselves that much, they put faith in both the creator and the creative people they hire to be able to produce quality without needing to interfere with constant 'network notes'  What actually makes the shared universe unlikely however is the fact they aren't in house productions or all from a single production company. It makes the legal aspect of using elements from other shows to create a shared universe difficult. Most shows that do exist in a shared universe come from the same production company so they already own the rights and this can even mean shows can be on different outlets but still share a universe"
netflix,3abpvj,wakey87433,0,Fri Jun 19 09:09:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't think it would be a thing but I just thought it would be a cool idea. Couldn't Netflix take some creative control of their current shows and create the Netflix Universe after if they really wanted?"

Why make something phone/tablet-friendly when most people who use Netflix on those devices access it through their app?  All these ""User Experience Initiatives"" as they call them - implemented at most big websites these days - are SUPPOSED to be targeted towards ""adaptive design"" or whatever it's called, so that the website suits the thing you're using to view it.  GUI designers crow their glory about this new concept and how great it is... all the while ignoring the fact that most (pretty much all) websites NEVER implement a site for large screens, keyboards and mice anymore.  They stop after ""tablet"" - like they think that's all anyone ever uses anymore.  I don't get it.  I've even argued with a few GUI designers about it, and they are 100% convinced that designing for ""mobile first"" is the way to go.

Even before the UI update, I was still bombarded with their 'originals' and it was pretty annoying how they kept reappearing in my feed. It's like they're saying, ""Here, we made this so we are shoving it down your throats."" Or, ""This movie is popular right now and we just payed a ton of money for it, please watch it so we may recoup or licensing fees."""
netflix,3a6lh0,mushrooms,9,Thu Jun 18 10:33:23 2015 UTC,"It sucks.   I do not need more animation, I need less. I need more control over how I want to see things. I can't scroll when the damned icons keep jumping out at me I can't focus on what I'm trying to look at when the damned icons keep jumping out at me. I can't see ANYTHING with a black background - it's very hard on my eyes. The easy-to-read vertical list of episodes is now gone and replaced with another horizontal scrolling list of crap. They haven't fixed any of the interface issues they have had for years. I still can't sort my list the way I want to. I still can't separate TV from Movies. I don't need their preview title section bigger, and all of the lists below smaller. it's much slower it's much more difficult to use. their 'help' seriously sucks. they've taken one of the most hated website interfaces, and made it considerable worse.  That's a feat.   When you have kids, with no real experience designing current system, they repeat the problems which were resolved decades ago.  The most prevalent these days is the seriously misguided notion that one size fits all.  No, it does not. You can not effectively design one interface and make it work across all platforms.  It's been tried over and over, and it's rearing it's ugly head, again.  It's failing miserably everywhere it's being imposed.  Netflix is one of the worst offenders."
netflix,3a6lh0,macahi,18,Fri Jun 19 06:55:49 2015 UTC,"Awful use of space, being limited to 24 preview images on 2560x1440 monitor  makes for horrible interface. Seems like they're trying to get closer to their windows 8 app.  If there was a slider to alter the size of the images that would be a big improvement or even allow users to control the percentages. As it is it's just too slow to navigate as things stand."
netflix,3a6lh0,yimrsg,19,Wed Jun 17 21:03:36 2015 UTC,"It's terribly unintuitive. My typical flow was to hover over something, click on the link of the tile that takes you to the info page where you can see all the seasons and episodes. I HATE that the episodes are not in a list anymore. You cannot see all the episode titles of a season in one view anymore. These huge thumbnails... they don't even load the thumbnail all the way. It's just a a big black box with the names of only 5 episodes of that season. And then there's that huge black space underneath everything where I expect to see the list/info."
netflix,3a6lh0,triivium,6,Thu Jun 18 04:11:04 2015 UTC,Wow that really is awful. I actually prefer the in-player episode list over the awful new view. A giant thumbnail and tiny text is not at all useful.
netflix,3a6lh0,Rhinoscerous,7,Thu Jun 18 06:20:47 2015 UTC,"I am not a big fan of it tbh, it looks better now doubt but the functionality has decreased significantly. For one, you can no longer just go to a page for a specific show and view the entire list of episodes and use the drop down menu to switch seasons, now I have to sort through everything from the home page. This new version looks like it was made with living room usage in mind, but that is not what I want when I am sitting in front of my computer. The problem comes down to the fact that you can have as much information on the screen as before."

On the other hand, I don't like that the thumbnails are now wide instead of tall. Less info in the same space just to be touchscreen friendly when I use NF almost exclusively on my desktop PC. Also, it used to be that if you wanted to browse more in a row, you could just hover over the arrows to the side. Now you have to click.

I hate how I now have to hunt for the reviews I hate the fact that MY LIST keeps friggin disappearing I hate how hovering over icons makes them balloon up.  This seriously hampers scrolling thru the site. I Hate the new black background as it makes things harder to see and causes eye strain.    It never ceases to amaze me how people working for large companies such as Netflix don't even seem to know the basics about ergonomic and visual design???? WTF?  And why do they keep giving us less control and customization rather than more.  It's beginning to feel like the MyYahoo fiasco all over again.  And pardon my French but DAMN this new blocky tablet-like interface all these sites seem to want to go to now days.  I use a PC and couldn't care less about that interface.  Shouldn't decent web design take into account the device I'm using or is that too advanced for these amateurs????  Seriously getting tired of this site!

Hovering to open pages etc annoyed the shit out of me, I like that the down button just gives me what I wanted. It feels speaker.  I'm not a power user but to be honest I think this works well. Everything else is still there through the top menu and  seeing more options than I had before so overall happy."

If you let it sink in without judging too hastily, you'll be rewarded with a story little like anything you've seen before that you can't stop thinking about after it has run its course. The creators even go so far as to play with language in such a smart way that it obviously went over a lot of critic's heads who were too stuffy to pay attention to how it played out.

I feel like they're much more relatable (definitely wouldn't use the word enjoyable) if you've suffered from depression.

Netflix used to use an older version of their API on blu-ray/some streaming boxes (think Boxee) which meant only US or CA Netflix would work. You also needed a US or CA Netflix account.   Great if you live in either Canada or the US, but people these days want to ""travel"" with Netflix - and these players cannot do that. Now a days - you can use what ever country Netflix account - and use your device in what ever Netflix country.   Some older players also only support upto to 720p playback.   TLDR: Not really - just older models are sometimes restrictive as to where you can use them."

Not all manufacturers are interested in long term support. They've already sold you the TV, Blu-Ray player, etc. There's no more money in it for them to keep doing development and updating a 5+ year old product. Especially the devices where Netflix, Pandora, etc is just thrown in as an afterthought.  Roku, and similar devices, on the other hand - their primary job is apps for streaming, so I imagine the experience with them is much better."

Sometimes they might not update an app ever (See examples in this thread about queue only Netflix Apps), but there hasn't been a single time where the app was flat out inoperable that wasn't fixed.   The worst instance I can think of (an app not being supported/fixed) was November 2013-January 2014 when the Netflix app for Wii went down and wasn't fixed during that entire span. However that was obviously fixed and eventually still supported."

netflix,39wgiv,TakoTues,73,Mon Jun 15 10:40:36 2015 UTC,"It's probably because chrome deprecated (chucked out) the old Netscape module support, which silverlight (what Netflix uses for DRM) needs. https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation  TBH it's about time, there are much better plugin methods available to authors, keeping old standards so plugin writers can be lazy is not just a bad idea, but unsafe.   Netflix wont allow FHD content to go anywhere they aren't 100% sure about though, probably sensibly enough or pirates could just stream their content straight to their HDD's, and break all Netflix security agreements.  So here we sit, ""HD"" is the best you can get on chrome. Netflix can't really do anything without rewriting their own DRM for another plugin entirely (no), unless MS rewrite silverlight on a not shit API (still no) or Google backtracks and puts security holes back in their product (errrr, very no).  I.E. still works though so you can install the I.E tab extension in chrome, and have a single I.E. tab open in chrome running netflix. Not great, but it works at least. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ie-tab/hehijbfgiekmjfkfjpbkbammjbdenadd?hl=en  Edit - Corrected: 720p is ""HD"", 1080p is FHD,"

netflix,39wgiv,wredditcrew,10,Mon Jun 15 15:21:57 2015 UTC,"It's less Netflix and more the content owners. With the DRM elements of HTML5 yet to be finalised most of the content creators won't sign off on 1080p streams via most browsers. Microsoft and Apple as always aren't concerned with standards, they are going their own route so their standards are locked down already so have been evaluated by the content owners so they are allowed to offer 1080p streams by most of them (some are still limited to 720p even in IE and Safari. Some are even limited to 480p)  Also anyone still using Silverlight is limited by that because Silverlight can't handle over 720p"
netflix,39wgiv,wakey87433,11,Mon Jun 15 14:33:42 2015 UTC,"Also anyone still using Silverlight is limited by that because Silverlight can't handle over 720p   This is wrong. Netflix's outdated silverlight implementation can't, but modern silverlight itself has been handling 1080p for years. http://www.iis.net/media/experiencesmoothstreaming1080p  Netflix doesn't update because they're replacing it with html5 standard implementation"
netflix,39wgiv,elneuvabtg,3,Mon Jun 15 19:43:41 2015 UTC,Maybe I should have been clearer in what I meant. From my understanding from someone I know who works for Amazon UK and works in the development of their streaming video products the reason they are still running it in legacy mode is that in with Smooth Scrolling it doesn't offer full DRM support. Its perfectly fine running 1080p DRM Free content but development of the whole silverlight product was dropped just after the initial release of the feature and before it had all the bells and whistles added so they can't take advantage of the new features as the studios won't sign off on it as an acceptable delivery method as it would mean going DRM free
netflix,39wgiv,wakey87433,5,Mon Jun 15 20:13:11 2015 UTC,"And this is exactly why the Movie/TV industry is dying. They refuse to change with the times. They force DRM down our throats and the people buying their merchandise are the ones being hurt by it. Stop pretending like Silverlight stops pirates from downloading from Netflix. By the end of 24 hours after a season release all episodes are done compiling and uploaded on pirate websites. Pirates will continue to pirate and the end user gets fucked.  What would you prefer, a cable package where you pick exactly which channels you get per month for $20-30 no contract or what we have right now with the lowest packages on every major service going for 80 plus dollars with a handful of channels you watch. This is why the movie/tv industry will continue to decline. Shows like Kitchen Nightmares and Hells Kitchen used to be on Amazon Prime they axed that real quick when they thought about the $1.99 per episode price. They are only ensuring their further decline by using 1990 pricing models."
netflix,39wgiv,bound4earth,0,Tue Jun 16 02:01:49 2015 UTC,"I think the thinking is that they won't stop the piracy from the organised groups and it's something they are going to have to live with becauee these groups have the expertese and resources to get around any DRM. It's however a case of trying to prevent it becoming so easy anyone can do it.  As long as it can be kept as being niche (which both ripping content yourself, sharing it or downloading it is) they can make a show about it while knowing it doesn't have a massive impact but if it's too ease and people start ripping as much content as they can for a month and unsubscribe until all that's consumed or they stop buying copies of content to keep so they have it still when it's removed from the service they use because they can download a free or cheap piece of software and rip it with a single button without any thought much like ripping a cd has become (Torrents may be fairly easy but for the masses it's still requires way too many steps) then that's potentially a problem for them and I suspect that's what they are trying to protect against. It's easy from our pov as users to say it's the wrong approach because we want everything to be easy, high quality and low cost but at the same time they need to be making money which also means they need the outlets for the content to make money otherwise they don't have the money to make the content we enjoy so there is a required balance that needs found.  Oh and with the cable thing I think people are in for a major shock if bundling goes away. It will not get any cheaper. Here in the UK our main paid TV provider is Sky. They have 3 packs which costs £20, £30 and £36. I pay for the top pack but there are maybe 6 channels I watch enough that if I had to choose my channels I would pay for.  We also have a couple of channels that don't require a pack, the cheapest of these is £6 a month but that's a fairly niche channel which doesn't spend massive amounts on its content but even if the 6 channels I would pay for only cost that then that's £36 already. Most channels are going to have to charge more than £6 and even a couple of quid more makes the monthly bill higher. And just because I don't watch a channel enough to pay for it doesn't mean there aren't times I watch it and I would lose out on that so for the same price I'm getting a worse service. And then there are the channels themselves. Sky has something like 10million customers and every channel in the base pack gets a fee for all these customers. Even the most popular channels would struggle to reach 2million subscribers on their own, the few that might be able to get 1-2million subscribers may be able to make a little more (although with a smaller potential reach their ad revenue may fall) but the vast majority suddenly find their budgets slashed. This means less spent on content and many of the channels not being able to survive, your personal,favourite channel that you watch for 8 hours a day may be one most people don't watch enough of to justify paying for so may shit down leaving you unable to view the content you enjoy. That's where the bundles help us as consumers, it allows the bigger channels to help make the more niche channels viable while keeping the cost to us lower"
netflix,39wgiv,wakey87433,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:38:14 2015 UTC,"The issues being anyone can do it in less then five minutes on any search engine. Again, it only hurts the people that buy their products. Their logic is flawed it shows how disconnected they are on every facet of their structuring. The majority of shows are still not allowed to be streamed because they think they will make less money, which again shows how obtuse they are. People do not want to wait another week to see the next episode. They want to watch them when they have time without commercial breaks.  Packed in channels might be here for some time, but they are on they way out, mark my words. Services like Sling & PlayStation Vue show that some companies are trying to offer better selections of channels without massive packages with hundreds of garbage channels. One day we will have a la carte services, but it will take a while for the greedy networks like Viacom to realize people no longer want to pay for 20 garbage channels to get the only good one they have left. Cable is not only beyond saturation, but people are abandoning it. Revenues based on the amount of subscribers is going down fast, which is why they are frantically looking for alternative ways to charge their current subscribers which only alienates more of them and speeds up that decline. Cable/satellite is killing itself off.  Local monopolies can only carry you so far when the internet is getting to the point where it can deliver 4K HD no matter where you live. Hell Satellite offers 15Mbps and up which is faster then a lot of cities in America. Cable/satellite does even come close on even one channel yet. They will continue to not upgrade the infrastructure that tax dollars paid for years ago and they will not be able to compete in a few short years. I hope Google crushes them.  TL;DR: Cable/satellite will continue to wither away and die because they refuse to adapt and spend almost no money on maintaining their own infrastructure."
netflix,39wgiv,bound4earth,-1,Wed Jun 24 00:16:44 2015 UTC,"It's not as simple as a 5 minute Google search though. That's only getting you so far and hassle and complexity of torrenting is beyond most people. Most of us posting on reddit are in the minority when it comes to our familiarity and understanding of the Internet  Also most people are still perfectly happy watching things week by week as Aquarius is showing which is getting more viewers each week than are said to have watched the whole season via the nbc website and Hulu.  And your view on a la carte is totally wrong. It's bundling that actually keeps it affordable and also keeps channels viable.  Here in the UK our big Pay Tv provider is Sky, the top package of 'basic' channels costs £36 a month. We have a few a la carte channels as well that you can get without taking a package. The cheapest of these costs £6 for a niche sports team channel containing fairly inexpensive inhouse produced content, the most expensive of these a la carte channels is £23. Even if they all went on at the £6 level that means that you could choose just SIX channels before you reach the same price point. At those prices you are only going to subscribe to the channels you watch almost daily but there will be a number of channels you get value out of because you watch shows on them on a casual basis which your now going to have to miss out on or shell out for. Also look at Playstation Vue that are wanting $4 for Machinima, a channel where all its content is available free on YouTube   And when channels are bundled it actually allows them to generally generate more income than a subscription would. Again looking at Sky in the UK they have just under 12million subscribers all of whom take the lowest pack. Any channel in that hence gets the agreed carriage fee per customer TWELVE MILLION times. Even though the carriage fee is much lower than they get from a subscription even after costs for providing the subscription service they can't get close to getting 12million subscribers to the channel. Sky Atlantic is one of the most watched channels in that pack and its highest rated programme when you consolidate all the repeats is GoT that gets less than 1.5mill viewers. It's the only show on that channel that breaks the 1mill barrier and a show like Mad Men was getting under 80k for. Last of its final run. I would be highly surprised if they would be able to get 1.5 mill subscribers to the channel as most people are only watching GoT, it's cheaper for them to wait for the Boxset or the techie ones to download it Illegally.  So ultimately going subscription based will leave most with less budget, a couple of the most popular ones might be a little better off but not massively   Also as most of these channels also carries ads having a smaller potential reach also impacts this income. We would at the very least see money spent on content shrink and in some cases see niche channels disappear. And you may think this is fine as they are garbage channels but remember a channel you find garbage others may find good and channels you find good others might find garbage so we don't really want a situation where where suddenly we lose content people like.  Also back to my initial point on pricing, this is where the £6 prices we see at the cheapest end in the UK or the $4 for Machinima end up not being viable for most if they want to keep output anywhere near the levels they are at going to need to price it much higher.  People like a la carte as an idea because they believe they are paying for channels they don't want BUT the simple reality is the channels are all subsiding each other for the benefit of us as consumers in a bundle setup and if those after a la carte get their wish everyone will end up paying more with the only winners being the services providing the channels be it cable or over the top services like Sling  Oh and cable numbers aren't dropping anywhere near as you seem to think and outside the US Paid TV services are generally seeing numbers rise (which impacts the US because it stops production companies wanting to offer streaming rights as the money they get from international sales is going through the roof, Infact they can offer them to the channels for less making cable and still make more than they would on the US streaming rights and be quids in)"

Products like Unity used to be able to offer their engine through NPAPI, now they have to write HTML5 export tools to allow games to export to modern web, but the functionality isn't even the barest fraction of what they achieved through NPAPI, and we're likely 1-2 years of browser development and standards development away from where we were 1 year ago."

Most TV is still broadcast at 720p. If you put them side by side, you could probably see a difference but if disk space or home network streaming speed is a concern, the trade off is acceptable by most people. I personally pull epic works like Lord of the Rings or Interstellar in 1080 and anything like a comedy or action film in 720, myself.

If you plan on watching the video on an ordinary laptop screen for example you won't be able to tell the difference between 720p and 1080p so going for the smaller file size makes sense. If you are watching on a nice television/monitor that supports 1080p you will definitely be able to tell the difference.
netflix,39wgiv,jo1993,4,Mon Jun 15 15:34:52 2015 UTC,1280x720 vs 1920x1080  Yes there is a big difference but it all depends on the resolution your screen is.
netflix,39wgiv,vikashautar,8,Mon Jun 15 14:44:03 2015 UTC,DVDs are 720x480.  Playstation 1 was 320x224  You kids today are so picky.

netflix,39wgiv,Sojourner_Truth,-7,Mon Jun 15 15:46:48 2015 UTC,"720p is called Quarter HD because if you take four 720p screens and put them in a square, its the same size/shape/pixel count as 1080p.  however its still better than 480p (SD) or below, but I could understand people being pissed off."
netflix,39wgiv,AeitZean,7,Mon Jun 15 15:30:51 2015 UTC,"Not quite...two 1280x720 screens side by side would be 2560x720.  2x2 in a square would be 2560x1440, not 1920x1080."

netflix,39wgiv,LackOfHats,10,Mon Jun 15 16:19:17 2015 UTC,"No that's ""tab casting"" quality. When you cast content from Netflix, the Chromecast isn't casting the video playing on your desktop, it's running the Netflix app and receiving the video straight from Netflix servers. That's why Chromecast is 1080, as long as your bandwidth allows it. The option you're showing here is the quality to cast your browser tab."

Using it with Connectify.me is awesome, works great in hotels.   I'm trialing Ad-free time because it's so cheap and works for just shifting regions.

You see when netflix makes a commercial it's called a 'promo' and not a commercial.  If it that makes no fucking sense to you then congratulations!  You're able to recognize bullshit when you see it.  There is no fucking difference between a 'promo' and a commercial.  Any distinction netflix marketing people try to create is pure bullshit to stop you from complaining and attempt to convince you that we have in fact been at war with Eastasia all along.
netflix,39z81w,wakey87433,10,Tue Jun 16 12:31:57 2015 UTC,"There is a massive difference between an ad and a promo. It's why the BBC can run promos for their content despite not being allowed to sell advertising space. It's also why most countries with limits on the amount of ads on TV don't include promos in these limits. They could of they wanted run a full day of promos if they wished when they wouldn't be allowed to run a full day of adverts.  Ads are paid spots designed to sell you additional products from 3rd parties, A promo is internal and isn't paid for. It's whole aim is to inform  users of content they may like. Netflix is littered with promos as it is as every image used to promote content from the 'poster' images, to the background images, to the slider images and even the blurbs are promos. A promo free Netflix would be just a list of titles. And video promos are simply much better at giving potential viewers an idea if it's something they would like as it can give a closer repsentation of the content than text and a static image can"

netflix,39z81w,Heiroglyph,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:07:04 2015 UTC,They really are the same. They are advertising their own show to get you to watch it.  It's especially mind boggling to me because they already have my money.  There's no reason to make their product worse by adding annoyances to it.
netflix,39z81w,iguessimherenow,6,Tue Jun 16 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"They need to just give you the option to opt out of it. But I honestly feel as though it is an enhancement rather than an annoyance. If a trailer can bring me to content I may have not found or given a proper chance otherwise, then that's a huge plus value for me.  HBO does the same thing before their shows and honestly it usually peaks my interest to watch an episode."
netflix,39z81w,Heiroglyph,2,Tue Jun 16 15:56:38 2015 UTC,"I have the same issue with HBO.  For example, I started to stream the final episode of Game of Thrones last Sunday.  What I get instead is a trailer for True Detective that I've seen repeatedly and with HBO Now's pathetic fast forward, it's faster to sit through it than to skip.  If I wanted to see that, I would watch it. I got an advertisement instead. They are degrading the service I'm paying for."
netflix,39z81w,wakey87433,2,Tue Jun 16 16:13:24 2015 UTC,"HBO's problem is they aren't using it correctly. Netflix should be perfectly capable of knowing when they have already shown you a promo, know to not show you promos for shows you have watched and maybe even show you promos for non-originals that may suit you based on your viewing and then it will be really useful rather than HBO where it's maybe useful the first time you watch something but gets repetitive until they change the promo they are running. It really could be a good use of 30 seconds to aid contnet discovery if they do it right"
netflix,39z81w,Heiroglyph,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"They've got every opportunity to show me new things in banners, the suggestions section, etc.  Waiting until I make a selection and click play will be annoying regardless of what they show me.  What they do to fill time slots with arbitrary length shows on cable just doesn't translate to on demand."
netflix,39z81w,iguessimherenow,-1,Tue Jun 16 18:08:11 2015 UTC,It's all good. Every person has their own preferences. I would venture to guess you are in the minority. I mean it's only like 60 seconds long. Do you hate the opening credits too?
netflix,39z81w,wakey87433,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:17:26 2015 UTC,"There is plenty of reason. Content discovery is very difficult in long form video content a blurb and an image can never give a fair repsentation of video content. Anyone who has scrolled through trying to find something to watch using these two things knows how tough and how much time can be wasted and you often start something you perhaps wouldn't have from a video promo.   And they are spending a lot on original content and it's good and surely we all want more of but to make it worthwhile for them they need to maximise viewers. A it's very easy to dismiss a show based on a blurb and image, I didn't start watching Veronica Mars when it started on TV based on the description, it was only from friends who gave it a chance that I eventually did and I'm glad I did as it was brilliant and nothing like the description. If I had seen a promo I would have checked it out from the start. And this is the problem that Netflix have to overcome with their originals which this helps with"
netflix,39z81w,Heiroglyph,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:33:07 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned in another comment about HBO, they have every opportunity to show me new material prior to when I make a selection and click play.  At that point, I expect them to show me what I asked for.  There are banners, suggestion sections, they could upgrade to video banners while I'm browsing the list.  When I hit play, I expect to see what I paid for. Not doing exactly that makes the service become annoying and worth less to me."
netflix,39z81w,wakey87433,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:11:29 2015 UTC,"They don't really have the opertunity to show you effective promo material before you pick something though. Banners (even the animated gif styme ones that they use on iPad app) and blurbs can not tell you what you really need to know to make an informed decision. For a while I was seeing OITNB one which was basically which if I hadn't watched the previous seasons would have told me nothing more than its a show set in a women's prison but that basically just tells you the setting. Such a banner for E.R, Scrubs and Greys Anatomy would also suggest the same kind of show, as would the blurb as all 3 are essentially shows following are built around a Rookie Doctor (Carter in ER, JD in Scrubs and Meridith in Greys) but in reality they are 3 very different shows and a video promo would highlight that with little problem.   When your browsing there are limited opertunities to play you video. On a Mobile devices the screen isn't big enough to do both, even a tablet that's a problem, many of the streaming boxes aren't powerful enough to stream a promo and let your browse and you have devices like the chromecast where you are searching on one device and playing on another. As your casting to a TV you most likely don't have sound on the device you cast from as you are wanting to watch it on your TV.   And again it's a single 30 second promo that may just save you many minutes of discovering the next show you want to watch. As long as when the testing is done they realise the kind of things I have about not bombarding people with the same promos over and over again, not showing one everytime and using the data they have to really target then it will be a useful feature and worth the occasional 30 seconds"
netflix,39z81w,KajiKaji,-3,Tue Jun 16 21:50:13 2015 UTC,"If we're getting rid of ads on netflix then we need to get rid of all those small banners with box art and movie descriptions that are just flooding my main page. Every time I go to netflix there are dozens, even 100s of these ads for movies I don't want to watch. It is so fucking annoying. They already got my money I don't want to see all that shit."

netflix,39z81w,Boston_Jason,4,Tue Jun 16 19:29:31 2015 UTC,Just call and complain.  That's all you can do.  This right here is exactly why I never wanted Netflix to get into OC.  The temptation to self promote (JUST DON'T CALL IT A COMMERCIAL!) was always going to be to great.
netflix,39z81w,iguessimherenow,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:36:24 2015 UTC,"But some of their OC is REALLY good. They have to do something to promote the shows. The other content in their library is promoted heavily before it lands on Netflix so you are already familiar with it. But their original content is not. They are going to have to promote the content somehow and self promotion is easily the cheapest and most efficient manner.   I think as long as it is done right it could work. But they should try and give people the ability to customize. Some people, like me, wouldn't mind seeing a trailer for Marco Polo before an episode of House of Cards. Some other people would rather just have the ability to click on a ""coming soon trailer"" that shows 15 min of original content trailers. To each their own."
netflix,39z81w,Drayzen,3,Tue Jun 16 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"They have to do something to promote the shows.   If only there was some sort of ""home screen"" where they could promote their content without a pre-roll ad."

Worst part is Netflix kept stuffing up and telling me ""There was a problem playing this show right now"" So each time it starts the fricking Sense8 ad again. So i had to skip it like 4 times  Now just out of sprite and because they have forced Sense8 ads onto me I am refusing to watch it.  and at the end of shows, when i run out of episodes it keeps trying to trick me into watching it by making it show up as next to play...

netflix,39z81w,doodahdeedo,8,Tue Jun 16 00:17:33 2015 UTC,"Makes sense in a hair-splitting kind of way.    Sounds like it will get pretty irritating when Netflix has enough programming for 3 straight minutes of ads, or ad breaks."
netflix,39z81w,blbil,2,Tue Jun 16 00:19:48 2015 UTC,"I doubt they would put that many in. I would imagine initially it will only show a single one from one of the recently launched shows and you wouldn't imagine they will end up with multiple new shows a week, infact they gave talked about a new show/season every two weeks being the aim.  Mind you expanding it from just Netflix shows to other content might make it a more useful. They know if you have watched s1 of OITNB so no point showing you one for s3 if you haven't, they know when you have already watched Sens8 so no point showing you it, they know if they already showed you the ad so showing it multiple times makes little sense, they know what content you like so can show promos for non-Netflix content and know what's similar to the content you selected that you may also like. As video is always a better way to get an idea of content rather than a image and brief blurb it might then save people plenty of time in finding future content to watch"

netflix,39u9jg,wredditcrew,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:59:32 2015 UTC,I will try the 8.1 device tomorrow. Yes I'm on the HD plan that supports 1080. The middle plan.

netflix,39u9jg,alextheplayer,0,Mon Jun 15 06:38:52 2015 UTC,Why 720p is HD so you are getting what you paid for. And with all the contract provsions they would need you to read through a 100 page document explaining what's available on what quality (Some content even in IE11 on Win8 is still limited to 480p for example)
netflix,39yn4j,BabyBlueSedan88,4,Mon Jun 15 21:20:58 2015 UTC,"*sigh*  Here we go again. Netflix already said it won't ever run third parties ads, only teasers for their original content."

Good thing companies never lie, and that similar entertainment providers have such a great history of always pleasing their customers.   Didn't the cable companies originally say there wouldn't be commercials?  Remember when YouTube wasn't 50% ads?   I'm sure they fed consumers similar bullshit. I love Netflix, but after all they are still a corporation. And if you give corporations an inch, they take a mile, and then bill you for it.

The reason netflix got huge and hulu didn't is because there are no commercials.  If it gets worse they will lose that advantage and alienate their customers. And the fact that people just blindly believe what they say, even with the knowledge of basically the same thing happening time and time again is hilarious.  If people are just okay with it it will just get worse. And because they track your all your viewing habits there's a strong incentive for targeted ads, just like what Google does.   Oh well.

Overall, I thought it was good and this season really featured several great scenes from the supporting cast members that really showed their acting chops."

Maybe that's the way it should be, it probably shouldn't be. But that's what we've got.  Publicly complaining and criticizing your supervisor and your company online won't fix any of that. It'll just get you fired. Seriously, and then you go ahead and provide a link and ask people to contact your supervisor? You're begging to be fired.   Even if all that were pure hogwash, what do you expect to accomplish? You're apparently arguing with a boss. Do you expect them to get a bunch of emails saying   Hey, an anonymous person told me a few select facts which have totes convinced me that you're wrong in your dispute with an employee   And then the boss is going to have an epiphany and realize that they were really in the wrong all along?  Dude, you're getting a lesson on why it sucks, under our current system, to be a powerless disposable employee. Feel free to try to change that! Fucking crusade; unionize; gather petitions; do a sit-in; organize; petition; etc. But just complaining about your boss online -- and by name and inviting people to contact him!!! -- won't result in any positive change for anyone. It'll just cause you to likely lose your job. No boss in the world is going to get a bunch of emails saying   Based on a few select facts, you're totes wrong in your dispute with an employee about scheduling his shifts in a way that he doesn't want to be scheduled.   And then be like ""OK""."

How would you feel if you were blamed for something you had no control over 4,5 or 8 times a day or more?  Over months, I would assume that everyone got a similar normal amount of calls where ""No"" can be attributed to the reasons you state.

This includes not only the screen your watching it on (you cant do 1080p if your screeen is only 720p) or the device can't handle 1080p so only does 720p or with a computer as the streaming device the software may not be able to (Silverlight will only go upto 720p) Does the content contract allow for 1080p on the device your using. There are some content owners who don't allow even 720p in the web browser version and others who limit to 720p even though it does 1080 on a streaming box

netflix,39lav3,funknut,8,Fri Jun 12 18:15:23 2015 UTC,You're correct. This is the Kids profile which is why it's so concerning.
netflix,39lav3,HappyGirl252,3,Fri Jun 12 18:24:51 2015 UTC,Possible you forgot to sign out of your kid's  profile and watched it?
netflix,39lav3,Jhollenbiz0,7,Fri Jun 12 22:20:05 2015 UTC,"Yeh, we don't make a habit of letting our kiddo control the remote, but I told my SO if this happened on our profile and our daughter somehow accessed it before I realized it, that would mark the first time I had ever been well and truly pissed off at Netflix. I consider myself a pretty open parent and we talk about all manner of things, but c'mon Netflix, please let me be the one to tell my kid about fake TV lesbian sex, mmmk?"
netflix,39lav3,HappyGirl252,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:33:09 2015 UTC,Under your kids profile even if your child clicked on the link it would error and say it cannot play on the child's account.  If you child accidentally watched an adult show it would be under your profile.

This is the standard refresh rate for Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia. If you aren't from any of these places, then uncheck it if you have it already checked.  If you have it already checked and you're not from any of these regions, then that might be the problem.  If those settings don't work, then try checking the 24Hz (you can't have 50Hz and 24Hz checked at the same time, it'll automatically uncheck the other), which is the natural refresh rate for films; it could be a workaround for now."

I only go to movie theaters where I have assigned seating and am able to hang out at the bar and go in when the last preview is playing. I don't have cabletv. I don't subscribe to any magazines.   I hate advertising for something that I already pay for. Netflix is all about convenience. I have a 20 TB NAS for work that I can start populating my own stuff on. I have a HTPC that I could load up OPENELEC and never see advertising for any media ever again.   It's the principal to me. If I'm paying for a product, I better damn well never, ever see an ad while consuming that product.    they've only ever shown ads for shows on Netflix   Still an ad.

Ofcourse now they are close to 'launching' so they slowly swapped every image with an ad. I advise you NOT to sign up for their 'service', their methods are not right, it's agressively pushing people to use your product.

netflix,39hmk2,cbrant777,72,Thu Jun 11 19:46:49 2015 UTC,"Weird article. Netflix is operating on a network television model, basically, except they don't scrounge for advertiser dollars. They scrounge for subscribers, like HBO, except their consumer base is near universal (as opposed to HBO's former cable requirement).  This model, of licensing but not owning their shows, hasn't failed HBO or NBC. Netflix's goal is to bring top quality programming to its customers, and not owning it's shows does not hamper that goal.   HBO may own its shows now, but it hasn't always been that way. Production of TV and movies is more than just writing a check. Someday Netflix might find it is better served having its own production studio."
netflix,39hmk2,peterkeats,15,Thu Jun 11 20:09:48 2015 UTC,"Showtime makes for an even better example, as even today they don't own the majority of shows they air and even those that are produced in-house are distributed internationally by CBS/Paramount, Showtime's parent company."
netflix,39hmk2,whateveresque,7,Thu Jun 11 21:01:37 2015 UTC,"Well put. Netflix plans to own their original shows, btw, let's see if they'll be one of the very few, who go through with it."
netflix,39hmk2,Abyss_85,9,Thu Jun 11 21:01:54 2015 UTC,"I believe BoJack Horseman and Sense8 are the first Netflix originals actually owned by Netflix, so they are definitely aiming for the HBO model."
netflix,39hmk2,whateveresque,6,Thu Jun 11 21:05:59 2015 UTC,Nope both shows are done by outside production companies
netflix,39hmk2,wakey87433,9,Thu Jun 11 21:10:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the distribution rights are owned by Netflix, whereas distribution rights to their other originals lie with other companies (House of Cards and Bloodline are owned by Sony, Orange Is the New Black is owned by Lionsgate, The Killing is owned by Fox, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is owned by Universal, etc.)."
netflix,39hmk2,whateveresque,4,Thu Jun 11 21:16:34 2015 UTC,"Being the distributor though doesn't mean you own the content. It means you have paid a fee for the right to sell the content in exchange for a cut of the revenue. And I say sell and not broadcast because that's what it is. The distributors job is to maximise the income for the benefit of the content owners (at age production companies) which means Netflix can't just sit on the content as that defrauding the content owners. They can pay for the content at The markets fair value but are Netflix really going to pay the going rate for content in every country when they operate I fewer than 20. It's highly doubtful.  And distribution deals can be regional with the main distributor being listed as the one who holds the rights in the primary market for the content. Go check out any Weinstein company distributed film of recent years in to see who is generally listed as the distributor, it will be the Weinstein company (as they are really distributors than producers as almost everything they do is bought in after its already filmed) BUT go and buy the DVD of these films in the UK and it will be listed as an 'Entertainment Film'  release just as previously all New Line distributed content (including Lord of the Rings) and Miramax distributed content was distributed by 'Entertainment Film' or 'Entertainment In Video' as it was back then.  So Netflix may be distributor BUT they could be distributor only in certain regions (places they operate in) and will be expected either to be paying market rate for all rights  they sit on or will be having to sell the rights to whoever generates the. Last money for the content owners"
netflix,39hmk2,wakey87433,2,Thu Jun 11 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's the case. I just looked it up (Sense8) and Netflix is only listed as distributor, not the production company.

netflix,39hmk2,wakey87433,3,Thu Jun 11 21:30:17 2015 UTC,200 is definitely doable. Netflix announced a global product that would be launched worldwide (after a few target launches in remaining major markets).
netflix,39hmk2,duckmartens,5,Thu Jun 11 22:09:51 2015 UTC,You do realise there isn't even 200 countries that are actually recognised by the U.N right? If you think some of these countries not recognised by the U.N have infrastructure and economies to make Netflix viable there you are mistaken. There are plenty of rural areas of the UK where Netflix isn't even viable
netflix,39hmk2,wakey87433,2,Thu Jun 11 22:22:38 2015 UTC,You're being pedantic.
netflix,39hmk2,duckmartens,2,Fri Jun 12 01:21:08 2015 UTC,"No I'm not. Hastings said they would be in over 200 countries by 2016 and I'm being realistic that its not doable. He needs more countries than the U.N recognises top reach 200. Most of those countries aren't established or large enough for Netflix to be viable as a business there.  And even if he was rounding up even 150 isn't doable, there are vast areas of the UK and most likely the same in the states where you can't get reliable and inexpensive internet with speeds high enough to watch HD, there are plenty of homes where you can't even get fast enough speeds to meet Netflix (or BBC's) speed requirements to watch in SD. So what makes you think half the countries the UN recognises actually have the internet speeds for most of the nation to make Netflix a viable option for consumers in that country when many people in the UK can't even get 2.5mb"
netflix,39hmk2,wakey87433,2,Fri Jun 12 01:32:30 2015 UTC,Netflix is buying worldwide rights and building back end server infrastructure.  Netflix will be available almost globally. Instead of showing 'not in your country' they will accept payment and let you try to stream. Of course their aren't going to make the end user connections any better.  Car analogy. BMW is available in more than 150 countries (their claim). Cost can be quite prohibitive in some countries and there might be traffic on the roads. There's places where it's a crappy dirt road or no roads at all. But BMW is still available in that country.
netflix,39hmk2,duckmartens,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:33:47 2015 UTC,"200 is of course only a nice round number they thought up, sounds much better than let's say 195 countries. ;)"

Who knows? Netflix is doing well right now."
netflix,39hmk2,Abyss_85,2,Thu Jun 11 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"A bit optimistic? That's an understatement. It's an increase of 852% in a year and a half. Even taking the 3 announced for the Fall (Italy, Spain and Portugal) and the 2016 launch in Czech Republic they still need a further increase of 700%.  They don't have the money to do that, buying content rights in every one of those countries, espeically content that will be popular with people in those countries will be expensive and many of the countries in the world just don't have an economy or decent enough internet to make Netflix viable.  There is more chance of a UFO landing on the White House lawn and when the door opens for ET, ALF, Zoidberg, Preditor to step out alongside Elvis who then put on a rendition of Blue Suede Shoes than then reaching 200 by 2016"
netflix,39hmk2,wakey87433,2,Thu Jun 11 22:16:50 2015 UTC,"You don't buy distribution rights one nation at a time necessarily. You do it in blocks in certain instances.

Netflix is already available in over 50 countries (source PDF, page 2 paragraph 5 - there is also a map here, but note that the names are not all countries), so less than 300% increase is needed.  Optimistic, yes, but I don't think impossible (especially if they start with smaller libraries in the rest-of-the-world category, i.e. just the stuff they have acquired the global distribution rights for, and without localized UI / subtitles / etc)."
netflix,39hmk2,Etunimi,3,Sun Jun 14 21:29:22 2015 UTC,"Vox is part of the corporation that also owns The Verge, the tech website from ex higher ups from Engaget, that transformed over 2 years from really interesting and industry-leading, to click-bait and really, garbage journalism.  Don't expect much from either Vox or The Verge in terms of quality of content, though The Verge does have nice interviews with industry people on Youtube."
netflix,39hmk2,lamamafia,13,Fri Jun 12 01:00:25 2015 UTC,".... so? it's like every other television network and show?   I mean I get what they're saying studios own the shows they produce.  Well no shit.  Fox doesn't ""own"" Family guy.  Seth Mcfarlane ""owns"" family guy.  Fox pays larges amounts of money for first run rights of Family guys, and likely some length of time before each episode goes into syndication.  That's why a lot of stations have the simpsons, family guy, and other shows.  But Then when Family guy wants to make DVDs they don't have to go through fox unless that's in the deal.   So really Netflix is doing the same model as EVERY OTHER NETWORK out there.  No one owns their own shows outside of the licensing deals they made."
netflix,39hmk2,Kinglink,2,Thu Jun 11 22:41:26 2015 UTC,"You example isn't completely correct as actually Fox does own Family Guy, not the Network directly but by association. Family Guy has 3 production partners behind it these are 20th Century Fox, Fox Televison Production and then Mcfarlanes Fuzzy Door. Fuzzy Door are the minority partner in this with 20th Century Fox being the senior one with the most control. In most of these cases the creator's production company is little more than vanity credit, sometimes they get big enough to be able to have a bigger stake by financially contributing such as JJ Abraham's Bad Robot but at then time of Family Guy Starting Mcfarlenes Fuzzy Door wasn't in that position so with Family Guy he has very little control.   So while the basic premise of your statement is right that Fox the Network have no ownership and benefit in no way from additional rights sales it's more complicated than that when the main production company behind a show is part of the same parent company.  Oh and some Netwoeks around the world do operate different. HBO now produce all their content internally and in the UK the BBC used to until law changes required them to use outside production companies for a percentage of their out but much of their contnet are internal BBC productions"
netflix,39hmk2,wakey87433,2,Fri Jun 12 08:55:47 2015 UTC,Netflix should make a studio & then get it greatly organized as making stuff themselves will be probably lot cheaper on in par with global licensing fees (200 countries in 2016) so owning their content with same price is definitely clever
netflix,39hmk2,Hypetys,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:04:22 2015 UTC,Their initial commisioning costs would most likely double. The average licence fee to the commisioning outlet works out at around 50% of the budget but as a production company it would be all 100%. And to act as a production company they would need to go and hire a lot of talented people from other companies for that side of the business to operate the production side which would could with ease double the infrastructure and staffing costs.  HBO are able to do it because they basically operate in. So few countries and are unlikely to expand. Sky in the UK alone pay £55million ($85mill) a year for exclusive access to their content in the UK alone which almost covers a season of GoT and by the time you bring in the international rights for all the other big nations they are probably covering most of their production costs for all their content so the TV subs in the US ends up being pure profit. They also obviously sell digital version and dvd's and let Amaozn prime in the US have the content after a delay  Netflix though if they want to move into as many countries as possible (their 200 by 2016 isn't viable. I would be surprised if they have added even 20 more by then) can't be doing that as they will need to keep hold of their content to sell the service if/when they launch in that country. And selling digital downloads and dvd's makes even less sense when they produce it themselves
netflix,39hmk2,wakey87433,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:46:13 2015 UTC,"Making a studio is hellishly expensive, even if they made a studio where are they going to get talent.  They'd have to hire directors, actors, and every other piece of the production.  Then they have to eat the cost when it fails.   It's FAR better to commission the shows from established content creators who know what they are doing."
netflix,39hmk2,Kinglink,3,Thu Jun 11 22:44:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've never understood why people always say ""Netflix should do ... and bring back ...""   They are all outside production companies producing the shows."

netflix,39hmk2,StormyWaters2021,4,Thu Jun 11 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, and it's lot cheaper to do this than set up their own company. In the end this is better for vewers, because it means lots of outside players can pitch ideas to Netflix and try to get cool ideas paid for, rather than a small group of people inside Netflix making that decision. It means more variety, and for the producers of content more ways to make money off it than that one-time Netflix sale."
netflix,39hmk2,jupiterkansas,2,Thu Jun 11 21:42:13 2015 UTC,"Right, my only point is that people say ""Netflix should do this"" for that reason: Netflix commissions other studios to make stuff for them."

Turning the opening scene of Medium Cool into a feature film, the movie mixes Peeping Tom with Network but doesn't delve deep enough into its themes to make a satisfying movie - ending just as it starts to get interesting.   The characters never connect because Gyllenhall plays an unsympathetic sociopath incapable of real relationships. The same could be said of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, but Bickle constantly wrestled with morality, and his backwards world misled him, which is why we could relate. Gyllenhall has no morality outside of self-serving ambition, and while the movie wants to make a bold statement about the world, it only states the obvious.   I couldn't muster any empathy for this psycho.   PS > Thanks in advance for the downvotes."

I did appreciate him to a point for his perverse brand of charisma; purely in the fictional setting.  I like characters who seem deserving of their confidence. And considering how he kept the upper hand against everybody else, he felt deserving. So, it's subjective for me when it comes to liking the movie despite the protagonist.

My name is Angel, who am I chatting with?  You Curtiseflush  Netflix Angel Pleased to meet you Curtiseflush, how can I help you today? :)  You My ""Contiunue Watching"" list seems to keep programming that I have finished watching... the only solution on the help page says to remove it from my history, but that the programs will no longer be used for suggestions I want the programs to be used for suggestions AND leave the continue watching list  Netflix Angel Oh I see and no worries, I know exactly why this is happening and I'll be glad to tell you the reason of some titles still showing on the Continue Watching, let me tell you more about this, bear with me while I type it out...  Netflix Angel Some titles may still show once you finished them since this ""Continue Watching row"" was the result of the Continue Watching row and the Recently watched. So it will show some of the ones you've already completed and the last ones you haven't for you to have best of both worlds. I know it can seem a little odd but don't worry! And regarding the suggestions something that can be done to ensure you still get recommended titles based on the ones you've removed is to Rate that title with 5 Stars if you really liked it  Netflix Angel And our system will automatically start working on that for sure. :)  You so if i remove it from history, but rate it 5 stars, it will still use that information for suggestions?  Netflix Angel That's correct. And the other option would be to just not remove them and if you continue watching new series and movies the older titles will not show after a certain time, but the first option it's a little quicker of course.  You There are so many forums online with people complaining about this  Netflix Angel I know it's a little unusual but we're also always trying to polish the website so I'll make sure to take this as feedback in your behalf so that it can help us a lot Curtiseflush.  You it seems like a film and TV series are each a title on that list... so I have movies that i finished pushing tv series that i didnt finish off to the back its counterintuative :(  You thanks for your explanation though I will probably remove the films and rate them as suggested"
netflix,39i3e2,CurtisEFlush,0,Sat Jun 27 00:46:21 2015 UTC,"Go to your viewing history and remove it from there, once you do that it will be gone from the continue watching row"
netflix,39i3e2,Netflakes,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:18:56 2015 UTC,"I would like to keep my history. Netflix just needs to allow one to remove individual shows from the cw list, that should be a fundamental function of the UI. Also when a show is watched to the very last ep, that show should disappear from the cw list. In my experience it resets to s1 ep1 and that is very annoying.  edit: If one could manually remove programs from the CW list, I, for one, would not care if they did not dissapear when the series was finished."
netflix,39i3e2,rmccl54,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:42:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they kinda merged the continue watching row with viewing history so it doesn't really make a difference now whether you finished watching it or are still watching it.

netflix,39cm1j,Jason2384,14,Wed Jun 10 21:27:19 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best thing the Wachowskis have made since The Matrix Reloaded. It's more interested in making sure you care about the characters before it dives into the sci-fi, and because of that I am more than willing to put up with the relatively slow start. By the end of episode 2 I had fallen in love. I can't wait to finish the season."

But I think their style of writing suits itself better to the serialized tv or miniseries format. Jupiter Ascending had a great concept, but they tried to do way too much, in far too little time. Sense8 is perfect because, although it starts slow, it has time to build the world and develop the characters."

netflix,39cm1j,EGLusty,2,Sat Jun 13 02:38:17 2015 UTC,"For those saying how its a slow burn etc etc. Keep in mind, this was written by J Micheal Straczynski aka the king of foreshadowing. My favourite show of all time, Babylon 5, had a painfully slow first season, but it was the perfect setup for 3 of the best seasons of TV I have ever seen. His comic book runs have also been the same. He loves the big payoffs, while still making you care about the characters involved.   I will say this though, without spoilers, I was less than impressed with the finale. It seemed rather.....I don't know....bland....like nothing was neither resolved nor heading anywhere. Like you were waiting for that final page of script that never came. Also, you can tell which episodes were directed by the Wachowskis' and which were not. Some of those angles and quick cuts were vomit inducing, as in motion sickness.   All that being said, I do hope this gets picked up for a second season as I have grown to like the characters very much and also look forward to deeper explanations as to all the who, what, where, why and hows."

Two days, I need to watch the first episodes again."
netflix,39cm1j,b0rgerking,2,Thu Jun 11 16:21:02 2015 UTC,"No, we compare it to Heroes because in both shows they barely teased at the abilities while letting you get to know the characters.  Then continued to draw that out until you had met the entire cast and even then when the abilities started being used it was never the focus and was always about how the people were changed and affected by those abilities.  Sense8 was even slower with it though.  The ability they suddenly find themselves with is part of the reason they end up where they do, but it's never the focus of the story being told.  All the way to the end they are still telling the story of some people, who just happen to have been drastically affected by a fantastic ability, not the story of how that ability turned them into a world dominating and evil crushing group of badasses."

It has interesting fight scenes and the pseudo-philosophical mumbo jumbo found in the rest of the Wachowski's work. It's interesting and polarizing, from what I've gathered.

They took the time to detail each character. At certain scenes near the final few episodes it wasn't ""oh they're going to be saved"" but ""who will come and save them"", as each one has a very dynamic way to problem solve so it would drastically change the scene.   I think the point of the show was to say that human decency is still innate, we want to help our fellow humans around the world but in a lot of ways we're so detached we don't really know how to. And that the art of life is everywhere just very different across cultures.  I look forward to second season because they can just jump into the action not need as much build up or exploration."

An occasional tombstone sign pointed the way, for once the drifted track that cut its way through the thick crust of alkali had been a highway. Coaches and buckas had followed it.

The real solution is to change his tastes over time. Show him good movies. I suggest non-sequel Disney movies. The Spy Kids series is good.  On the other hand, you could just say that, in order to watch something that's not on the kids list, he just needs to ask you or your mom first. That way he can watch something fun like The Clone Wars TV series or Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, but won't accidentally stumble onto Repo! The Genetic Opera.  Granted, your family may be working a lot harder on sheltering him than mine. Has he seen Star Wars and Indiana Jones?

I walked away for a few minutes & came back to the auto-play selected movie starting.  I'm assuming the credits from the movie I'd watched had finished, & Netflix decided to go ahead & start the other movie anyway.  It's annoying.  Also, when opening the Netflix application on the PS3, a trailer starts playing a few seconds after it loads, without any prompt from me.

netflix,39940v,GeekOutHuntsville,4,Wed Jun 10 04:03:42 2015 UTC,I don't know. While I like binge watching there is something that doing so is lost and that's the social side of TV. You just can't get that same discussion as everyone is at a different stage and you end up with the awkwardness of trying to either avoid hearing spoilers or being the one trying not to spoil others.  It would actually be interesting to see how a middle ground solution would work a weekly release schedule BUT with say 3 or 4 episodes released in a batch each week. It's then doesn't stretch it out over 10-13 weeks giving it more flow BUT the releases each week are small enough that it keeps everyone at roughly the same pace
netflix,39940v,wakey87433,4,Wed Jun 10 10:32:34 2015 UTC,"By releasing whole seasons, Netflix has given their viewers a choice in their viewing habits.  Some people love to binge immediately and watch an entire season in a weekend. Some people prefer to watch sparingly, emulating the way traditional networks release their content, weekly or possibly even less frequently than that.  Leaving that choice up to the consumer is good business because it appeals to all types of people with all types of time constraints that dictate when and how much watching they can do.  If you don't want to blow through a season of a series quickly, then don't. If you do, then do it. It's a choice. Nobody is forcing you to watch/not watch anything."
netflix,39940v,DoubleGSpot,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:48:19 2015 UTC,"While its not 'gun to your head' level there is pressure to binge watch though due to spoilers. Just look at the international market for TV, it never used to be a real problem in the UK that for US shows we were anywhere from a couple of months to a year behind because the world was much bigger, the chance of being spoiled was very small but with the rise of the internet we are all so much more connected and that makes trying to stay 'spoiler free' as an international viewer waiting for the UK airings more and more difficult. This is part of the reason release windows have tumbled (and a large part of TV piracy which in turn has further lowered international release windows) .  Binge watching actually has that same issue and puts pressure on people to binge watch. There will be someone who sits down at Midnight on the 12th and watches all of OITNB in a single sitting and will then write or tweet about it. Many others will have it watched by the end of the weekend so that pressure of spoilers does push you away from consuming it an episode at a time."

Game of Thrones, Mad Men, True Detective, Breaking Bad, etc. were all shows where almost every episode became an event. Episodes had a chance to soak in. There was discussion, analysis, speculation.

netflix,3972m4,villain717,3,Tue Jun 9 18:52:19 2015 UTC,"See here. They seem to be ditching user reviews (IMO, while some of them are indeed helpful, most--especially on series pages--seem to be just angry users asking for additional seasons or shows to be made available and threatening to cancel their subscriptions). There are even articles on the web that suggest Netflix may also be dropping star ratings in the near future."

netflix,3972m4,whateveresque,2,Tue Jun 9 19:58:11 2015 UTC,"No problem, always glad to help. The new interface will likely be rolled out as the default one by the end of the month, so the ""opt out"" thing will only be a valid workaround until then. Regarding user reviews, it may all just be temporary (as suggested by someone on the linked thread). They seem to be testing a lot of things these days (the ""Continue Watching"" section on the old interface being one of the most problem-laden ones). Plus, the article I linked (as well as all the other ones on the topic) mention a 4-star ratings scale, even though Netflix uses a 5-star ratings scale, so who knows how much truth there is to it."

Give PureVPN a go."
netflix,391n4t,Pure_Entertainment,11,Mon Jun 15 08:28:48 2015 UTC,"Ok, I've been doing some digging on this to try and figure out how all this works as its been doing my head in with this. (edited for spacing clarity)  If you don’t want to read my full break down - skip to the meaty bit towards the bottom - I tend to ramble…  1st off, its not a DNS thing, entirely.  With most ISP, they all have their own DNS servers for you to use, same goes for US ISPs. Although if you set your DNS to a US ISP’s DNS server, say Comcast for example, you get refused any queries, my guess is they geo-lookup your source address and block if its not on their network. Not uncommon. Ive seen this with things like email relay servers, they don’t want any old Joe using their systems.  I've got access to networks that can query directly DNS servers in the US, so I set up a series of forwarders to bounce through a few networks to eventually gain access to a US DNS server, thus any theory that Netflix is using some query based the IP address that get returned from any US DNS servers doest hold up. The results I get are for US Netflix IP’s but thats not enough to get you the US content.   So, if you set your DNS to the ViperDNS servers, I noticed that they return a different IP address for www.netflix.com, which comes back as 185.51.193.51. Subsequently when you go to netflix, this gives you the US content. That much we know.  This is where it gets interesting. If you open the source code for your netflix page after signing in without using any dodgy dns addresses, the coders have conveniently put in a debug line which has your public IP address in it as well as the location your account is in and the country that you are viewing from.   When we go through ViperDNS, this changes. This debug line now reads 'Debug:ip=64.237.34.115:geo=US:...'  So this then raises the question - who is 64.237.35.155 - ARIN provides the answer - it is held by a company called Unblock NV in Piscataway NJ - who knew! ( http://whois.arin.net/rest/customer/C05566657.html ) Registered on 15-1-2015 - Mmmm…  Now remember that I said that www.netflix.com via ViperDNS returns us with 185.51.193.51, well, again according to ARIN - that bounces us to a block of IP address held in RIPE over in the Amsterdam.  Querying their database ( https://apps.db.ripe.net/search/query.html ) with 185.51.193.51 gives us registration to a company called Unblock N.V. - now where did we see that before? Only this time, the registered address is in E-Commerce Park Vredenberg, Heelsumstraat Unit E-01, Willemstad, CURAÇAO. And for those who didn’t know CURAÇAO is a small island just north of Venezuela - so small you might miss it (sorry if I’ve offended you if you live there!)! ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Curaçao/@12.1892117,-68.8905304,11z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8e849dbe62c7fdc7:0xfc7f9228dbc64723)  What does this have to do with Viper DNS - well if you have a look at the bottom of their terms and conditions page (https://www.viperdns.com/terms.html) theres a nice little section that reads…  Law & jurisdiction. Our service is provided under the laws of Curaçao and the courts over here have exclusive jurisdiction.  If we also query to see who registered ViperDNS.com - this points us to Easynet as the registrar, searching their site ( https://whois.easydns.com ) gives an admin contact as noc@unblock.net - they don’t seem to have a web page directly so no more info on that.  What I can see though again is it is registered again to the same address as ViperDNS.com.   This bit I don’t get…  When you sign in to netflix over HTTPS - you get a cert or padlock on your browser - this is because you are setting up an encrypted link between YOUR system and Netflix servers. To my understanding, if the name doesn’t match - it fails, same if its out of date, same again if the system that has signed their cert isn’t trusted by your browser. So, how have they managed to get a Netflix cert on their server?? Remember, when you go via Viper - you are being redirected to one of their servers, which ‘appears’ to have a valid cert on it.  I’ve managed to get the MD5 Fingerprint off each cert, each of which appear to be signed by Symantec, then by Verisign. For those of you interested, the MD5 Fingerprint is 73 7F 1C A4 9A D4 59 E8 66 D9 A8 7D E8 12 31 C3 - the same if you go through Viper or direct. I don’t get that bit - unless they have done some sort of ‘nat’ through their network but in doing that - are you not having to decrypt the data to be able to send it on? I am open to an expert on this.  So what can we take from this…   (The MEATY BIT)  1: DONT SET YOUR DNS TO POINT EVERYTHING TO VIPERDNS! - You don’t actually need to (see point 3 below)! - God only know what servers they are sending you to and what they are redirecting you to capture data - think PASSWORDS!!  2: From what I can tell - they are PROXYING WWW.netflix.com - taking it in on 185.51.193.51 and spitting it out on 64.237.34.115, which is in the US - how they get it there, what do they glean from your traffic? - potentially your passwords - can’t tell.  3: a simple HOST file entry to point www.netflix.com to 185.51.193.51 is enough to sent it through their network (AT YOUR OWN RISK)  4: If you have extra devices that you can’t change your hosts file on, you might be able to set a host entry direct on your router, as I’ve said, from what I can tell you ONLY need to direct www.netflix.com to 185.51.193.51 NOT send all your DNS queries to their system.  5: Breaking this down for open discussion may well lead to changes being made where this gets broken. Sorry, but there should be more transparency from Viper on HOW they are doing what they are doing NOT by hijacking my connection and any relation to other companies.  What /may/ be a safer way - and I have no evidence to prove this,  sign in to netflix not using Viper and register your computer / device.  Then make the change above (point 3).  flush your dns and go back to netflix.  It would appear that once you have signed in, you don’t need to again unless you sign out on a device. At least then you are not potentially sending passwords. What you are doing, which may be how netflix can tell who you are, is sending cookie info, which, as its now going through their systems could be used for other purposes!  Anyways - I’m open to discussion on this, I’m no security expert by any stretch. This is my opinion sat in front of the internet trying to figure this out…  What we need to do is try and lobby Netflix to remove the stupid boarders - then this wouldn’t be a problem.  Thanks for reading, hope all this makes sense! Wayne."
netflix,391n4t,planetwayne,-7,Wed Jun 10 21:35:47 2015 UTC,"Great dig ""planetwayne"", compliments, a lot of information is indeed correct.  The parts I'd like to correct/add on are:  SSL certificate: What we do to get Netflix to recognise you as a US user is simply tunnel your connection to Netflix via our servers. This is a transparent tunnel, meaning we do not intercept nor have the ability to decrypt any content you send to Netflix, which is why the certificates match (we even tunnel the certificate request/response through us without modifications, as can be seen from the matching fingerprints).  Point 1/3: This won't fix it, there are a lot of hostnames that need to be tunneled via our servers to get Netflix to recognise you as a US user, which is why we ask users to adjust their DNS settings. We've added all the needed records to our DNS servers and will add new ones once they come up in the future.  Point 5: No things will break, there is no need to, we're open for discussion and love it when techies look at our stuff :)  In general, we're not hijacking your connection. We never have, and never will. We simply tunnel specific hostnames that belong to specific services via our servers to get those specific services to recognise you as a US (or UK, IE, etc) user rather than your current country. It's that simple, and it's been the modus operandi of any other SmartDNS provider out there. We're not different, just better :)"
netflix,391n4t,Nick_ViperDNS,5,Wed Jun 10 21:52:18 2015 UTC,Except most smartDNS servers charge a fee for their services. How does your company profit from the services you're providing?

Nothing worse then having a service, paying for it and then finding out it isn't stable. Untill we're confident that our service is stable we're in a free beta. Enjoy :)"

netflix,391n4t,quien,3,Sun Jun 14 10:57:49 2015 UTC,"Ok... lets take this at face value for a moment value and try to mute some of the paranoia and fustration that has built up here.  I think the thing to learn from this is that the marketing strategy you have used with this was so way off the mark here that any level of trust has just gone out of the window. There is much work to be done. IMHO.  Why not come clean from the outset that you were looking for testers? Or even state that this was open beta from the beginning? At least people would know that things could change. Instead, from what I can make out, your IP addresses (and not 'codes') had been circulated on various lists on how circumvent Netflix boarder control system. If there had been notice that this was a trial or beta setup then people would have (hopefully) realised what they were getting in to. Instead, the first you get to know is when the web content you are viewing has been vandalised with adverts to a URL outside of Netflix, which instant raises alarms and 'what the hell' to which there is panic, password changes and the whole 9 yards!  There needs to be more transparency on HOW your technology works. Once you realise what potentially could be happening here, people are correct to come up in arms! Again, if you see what you have done here, you have managed to deface web sites that people don't expect to happen, once the realisation then sets in that, hold on, I am sending ALL MY DNS REQUESTS through here, WHAT ELSE is going on! - same again, Panic and Anger!.  At this point - I'm not saying you ARE doing anything like this, I have no proof for or against and I really hope for the sake of your future subscribers you don’t use any proxied data! But I’ll say again, this was truly unexpected - problem. Also be mindful  that Reddit is well searched and at this point in time, this thread isn’t doing any favours. Then again, meaningful discussion may well prevail.  Technically speaking, I still don't see the need for people to route EVERYTHING via your DNS, again trust, but I'm fortunate to run my own DNS and could investigate. Again, explanation on your site on how your system works, with enough detail to convince people you are going about things correctly. Maybe even detailing how to use hosts files or just route DNS for the service you are offering if people are a little more security minded.   This now all boils back down to you guys building up a level of trust with the community, especially if you are going to want people to pay for the service going forward.  The other side of the coin here, again bringing a little balance and perspective here, we are all potentially breaking (ok possible grey area) the Ts & Cs from Netflix here in so much as attempting to circumvent their border control system - the people to lobby on changing this is really Netflix. Although I did have one thought that this was something to do with Netflix directly where they were giving out ways to defeat their own system. The content providers see the ‘official’ Netflix but they also ‘let slip’ the back door to get more subscribers. Hence a bit more ‘digging’ as to who and what is where.  Again, thanks for reading.  Wayne."
netflix,391n4t,planetwayne,-3,Thu Jun 11 20:04:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the follow-up Wayne.  The reason we chose this method was simple really, we wanted to make sure people still had functioning devices while still conveying the message that something was about to change. The other option we had was to simply disable our DNS servers, leaving thousands of people with a device that just ""doesn't work"". We figured that would lead to much more frustration than just replacing the images temporarily.   ViperDNS had it's origins in where a lot of great things originate from, a nasty code hacking marathon over the weekend to see if we could get it to work. We could, and quickly published it online to see how the code would hold up under pressure of thousands of users. Mind you, no business plan was formed, no name was thought of, heck, even a website wasn't made at that point. At that moment there really was no way to let people know this was a test.  We actually have written up an ""about"" page highlighting our technology: https://www.viperdns.com/about.html. I admit, it doesn't go into the nitty gritty, but as you may understand that's part of the business secret on how we do it.  You are correct when stating that there is no need to route EVERYTHING via our DNS, the problem is that part of our business secret is which part of a service need to be tunneled through us and which part doesn't. We've spent countless hours debugging various services and testing it internally on a lot of different devices to figure this out.  Then again, if a techie like yourself would prefer to route/query our DNS servers just for Netflix, have at it, we'll probably even help you out if something isn't working on your end :)"
netflix,391n4t,Nick_ViperDNS,2,Fri Jun 12 13:16:28 2015 UTC,"Hi Nick,  The issue I still see with this is that you have proven that you can alter someone else web site without any warning or intervention from the client. If you had put a full page redirect up instead of changing content - maybe that would have been better, open to suggestions. Not even a permanent change but maybe a 1 in 10000 visits with a click to continue or something again whilst still in beta - again as you said, you are logging source IP addresses. The alarming thing came about because have now proven you can change web content without warning.  I would have still suggested that the addresses you were putting out there to start off with should have some note to say that this was some sort of alpha / beta test.  Anyways, its happened now.  As for your web page, Ok I see you have some 'IP' to protect but I still think things could be made a little clearer and still a valid point to only redirecting for services you  are offering. Whats to say at some point 'your' system doest get compromised whereby a 3rd party then starts logging Usernames and passwords for banking sites etc. you have proven that sites can be changed - all back to trust and transparency.  The commendable side here though is more the fact that you appear to be entering discussion on the whole thing. Hopefully something positive will come about this. I've   noticed that there is now an article on uk.businessinsider.com.  ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/viperdns-covers-netflix-in-ads-2015-6 )  Maybe this discussion will add balance. - I've linked to this reddit page from there also.  For reference, I'm not representing anything here but my own interests and concerns with this and am trying to point out a balanced point of view.  Thanks for reading. Wayne"
netflix,391n4t,planetwayne,-1,Sat Jun 13 18:00:51 2015 UTC,"Again, thanks for the lengthy follow-up Wayne. I'll try to explain our reasoning behind the image replacement.   The people who use a DNS to switch regions do so overwhelmingly via consoles, iPad's, and Smart TV's. In fact, I'd say the vast majority does so. We know that because Netflix uses separate hostnames for almost each type of device. We see the vast majority of requests coming in for those hostnames (do note, we do not know what's inside those requests, we simply see the amount of requests).   If we were to do a full page redirect, every one of those devices would not redirect but rather give a general error message when starting the Netflix app (""There is a problem connecting to Netflix""). Nobody would know what would be wrong at that point, and there would be no way to inform those people about what had happened or how they could fix it.  By just replacing the images with our own image and text we were able to reach the people that use our DNS, still leave them with a functioning Netflix application but at the same time let them know things are about to change and they needed to act on it in order to continue using US Netflix.   We've had very lengthy discussions about this, explored various scenarios and ultimately decided that this was the least worst solution we could come up with.   You are correct that our communication regarding the DNS addresses could have been better to start with, we've learned from that and will certainly try to improve that in future communcations.  Thanks a lot for the lengthy posts Wayne, I've really appreciated your input here."
netflix,391n4t,Nick_ViperDNS,3,Mon Jun 15 12:38:02 2015 UTC,"I found this last month when all the thumbnails had been replaced by a different site Playmo.TV that I had to find a new DNS.  The most up to date one was working fine until this ViperDNS popped up today, how are they even hijacking the DNS to change all the thumbnails to ads for their sites?  Netflix have already said they don't mind people using VPNs to access all of their content so I feel like they should be aware that some company is trying to cash in on that."

netflix,391n4t,Jeffers_99,4,Mon Jun 8 17:41:54 2015 UTC,I'm not an expert but I think it depends on what device your using it on.  If you're using a false DNS code to access Netflix (which we all are) then someone controls that code and can redirect you to somewhere else.  With a PS4 or Samsung smart TV this could cause problems with other apps which use the internet.  As we're having problems with this DNS (I'm using the same one as Jeffers) it might be a good idea to revert back to automatic network settings until a new DNS code is found that works.  But free false DNS codes are always a risk.

To be fair, so long as you've done this on your PlayStation or similar device you should be relatively safe. It all depends on what your doing while connected to the DNS service.

Whatever the show is called, I wonder if the BBC will let the seasons of Top Gear it already has on Netflix stick around. They may decide to pull all their content.   It has happened before, although for different reasons, like when Viacom did this. I believe we lost South Park to this, and that's a prominent show as well."

netflix,38yup4,acosmichippo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:31:38 2015 UTC,They've done this overseas for American shows like Breaking Bad as well.  But I'm guessing all Netflix-produced shows will continue to be released all at once.  I believe they all have been up to this point.
netflix,38yup4,wakey87433,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:58:21 2015 UTC,TBH I see it as probably being done more like the kid animations that are on Netflix. They will commision a set amount but won't release them all at once OR weekly but instead in batches. It's not a simple show to film which is why the BBC would often have 4-6 episodes then a few months break before coming back for another batch of episode from that season

Holy crap the BBC financially rapes the hosts.  This seems to confirm the numbers I was looking at.  4.6M for two years on one of the most watched shows on broadcast television...  WHAT!    Charlie Sheen was making more in a month than they are set to make in two years...  Especially considering that each episode of Top Gear there are literally something like 100 million more views.
netflix,38yup4,xadjack,6,Tue Jun 9 05:43:13 2015 UTC,"BBC is publicly funded by the UK population, so have a commitment to share money and profits from 'big shows' around the whole corp and put it into developing new shows etc.. It's actually a really good thing and means lots of new comedies come out of the Beeb. Certainly if you were in it to make a killing you wouldn't work for them, but do you want tv writers / hosts etc.. On your network that are in it for that reason anyway?"
netflix,38yup4,segagaga,2,Tue Jun 9 12:36:40 2015 UTC,"The problem with that, is a lot of the new ""comedies"" that come out on the ""Beeb"" are shite. Publicly funded corporations with committees and employment quotas and ""cultural sensitivity training"" don't tend to be creative and are highly risk-averse. The BBC has for years been at odds with everything Clarkson does, and the Producer-punching was pretty much inevitable."

netflix,38yup4,wakey87433,0,Mon Jun 8 07:03:05 2015 UTC,I don't think the BBC has been at odds with Clarkson its the rival media firms that look for anything to beat the BBC with a stick with that create a false controversy which then forces the BBC's hand
netflix,38yup4,wakey87433,0,Mon Jun 8 10:20:23 2015 UTC,"That £4.6mill on offer won't even be for just Top Gear, it will be a general contract with the BBC covering both Top Gear and other appearances on the channel including shows the BBC wants them to front and also most likely shows they develop themselves.   Anyway Only the UK airings on the BBC matter though. There are two different BBC's the publically funded broadcaster who makes Top Gear and the commercial BBC Worldwide. BBCW's main business is buying the BBC content to sell worldwide and secondary UK rights but they also buy rights for British content from other channels and also spend money developing local content such as Orphan Black  While BBCW have to hand all their profits back to the BBC it's not something they can rely on. They have to pay what is fair for a show that gets 7mill viewers and that fits in with the budget they have and the output requirements they have that comes from being a PSB"
netflix,38yup4,Furiou5,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:46:30 2015 UTC,So the BBC does trickery(selling content to themselves to sell in other markets) in order to not pay their presenters what they are worth?  Wow that is shitty.  Well I guess unfair crap pay is the reason the US gets all the creative stars from the UK.
netflix,38yup4,wakey87433,0,Mon Jun 8 15:22:33 2015 UTC,"Its not trickery, it's the legal situation. They aren't a commercial network, they are funded by a governmental mandated licence fee that every building that has equipment capable of receiving live broadcasts is required to have. The licence costs £144 a year and the majority of the homes in the UK pay it as they watch live broadcasts. The money from this goes to the BBC who in return have tougher broadcast regulation and output requirements than a commercial network for example they aren't allowed to carry ads or product placement and have to produce shows that commercial broadcasters wouldnt take a risk on as they would be deemed too niche. They are also expected to push broadcast technology for the good of the whole of UK broadcasting, run niche channels such as S4C & BBC Alba (S4C being all in Welsh which is a little spoken language even in Wales and Alba being in Scottish Gaelic which again is a little spoken language) and also invest in the general infrastructure of the UK. They are also required to put out much more new content in a day where as they don't just hand 80% of the day over to the local affiliate to fill the air.   As such budgets are pretty tight as they are running 4 main entertainment channels, a News channel, the 2 specialist language channels, BBC Parliment (Kind of like cspan but just showing the debates happening in Parliment), something like 8 national radio stations, countless local radio stations, regional TV News/Factual output divisions all while investing in broadcast infrastructure, doing R&D and producing expensive niche content.  Even the way they sell their content for international and secondary markets is regulated. The BBC can't start a bidding war for content, they are only allowed to sell to BBCW, BBCW has to pay what is deemed the fair market rate but they could probably get more but because of the way they are funded they aren't allowed  The advantage however of the way they are funded is the extra freedom. Commercial stations always have to think about grabbing as many viewers as possible to maximise ad revenue and also ensuring that they keep advertisers happy. Part of what makes Top Gear better than the other car shows out there is the freedom this gives them, they can slag off any car company without the bosses intervening because it might stop them advertising on the channel.  It should also be noted it's not exactly as if they are getting badly paid anyway. The UK is a much smaller country so there is less money anyway so even if Top Gear was on ITV it's not like they would be getting Charlie Sheen money. They would get more because a commercial station can spend more of they think it will generate more ad money BUT it wouldn't be massively more. In fact ultimately they may make more because unlike most commercial networks the deals aren't golden handcuff ones. Infact most BBC 'talent' especially the presenters are hired on more freelancer terms allowing them to do as much work for other commercial channels to increase their income as much as they like."

To the best of my knowledge, Netflix takes an average score for each show or film and then skews it a little depending on your preferences. It would be highly unlikely (very well might be downright impossible) for one person to see a one star and another a five star rating regardless of how different their tastes are. People rating this show poorly just because they assume it's a ripoff almost certainly contributed to the low rating we see in the screenshot, and regardless of preferences I assume most people see a pretty poor rating for this show on their accounts."

This is why this tv show has 62 episodes. If you check any other latinamerican tv shows in netflix you will find the same trend. As regards to this specific series I must say that it is a terrible makeover, in my humble opinion, the producers made a big mistake by remaking it for the latinamerican  public.  Breaking Bad's plot is not something that could happen in any country in latinamerica, hence the plot turns to be ridicule under the eye of the average spectator."

Overall the acting and production value weren't that great (Diego Trujillo was certainly no Brian Cranston.) But since it was the same story I thought it was still watchable.

netflix,38tw9o,qp0n,16,Sat Jun 6 19:57:01 2015 UTC,I think this series gave the biggest boost to Jean Claude Van Damme's career.  I liked the show but felt like it was a combination of the Matrix in terms of abilities and Cloud Atlas in how everyone is interconnected.  Some of the scenes are direct ripoffs from some of their movies but that only made it better in my eyes.  While it didn't cover too much new material the cinematography and action scenes were amazing.  I can't believe how many on location shots they had all over the world.  If it gets a season 2 I'm hoping for more Van Damn.  That scene with the motorcycle... so good.

netflix,38tw9o,shoe_owner,4,Sat Jun 6 22:06:08 2015 UTC,Most really good shows take 3-5 episodes to really 'get'.
netflix,38tw9o,Jamator01,-5,Sun Jun 7 06:01:33 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you there. Every single show I've watched that I consider to be a great show (usually in line with what the majority thinks) has pulled me in from the first pilot episode. Usually, these shows put a lot of gunpowder into their first episode, for just that reason. That's the first thing anyone's gonna see (apart from the trailer), and could be the last. There's sometimes a conflict between introducing the world in the first episode, and making it actually interesting right from the get-go. Also, at times the pilot episode might be the first and last episode to be made, and so it also needs a good wrap-up ending to it that could lead to a lot more (although this is not the case with shows like Sense8, since they've already been bought by Netflix to do a whole season).  Sense8 didn't do this for me. I've watched 8 episodes so far, I think, and the first one was among the worst of them. It didn't end on a cliffhanger, it didn't intrigue me more than it confused me and (a problem all episodes have had so far) it focuses way too much on unimportant stuff that doesn't drive neither characters nor plot forward, like the weird sex montages or the overlapping scenes, or the countless romantic cliché-dialogues between the stereotypically gay couples - and don't even get me started with the whole 'Lito appears to be in an awesome, crazy scene but it's then revealed to be a movie shoot' that they push on us (I think I've seen it like 6 times, the only time it was inventive and not just a useless scene is the Matrix homage with the strings and stuff).  Bottom line is, besides all my pet peeves about the stuff in Sense8 - a great show pulls you in right from the start, maybe has a slow burn over the season but still intrigues you with every episode and you need to feel the plot advancing for each episode. In Sense8, I could count the plot points on one hand, bar the individual storylines for each of the 8 Sensates(?) - of which most are incredibly uninteresting and at this point doesn't contribute to the plot or the mood of the show.  Sorry for the rant. Rant over. I lost the red thread somewhere in there, please report to me if found."

The dialogue was still fairly poor though. Good dialogue and speech is invisible to viewer, as you need to believe the characters would really be interacting like that. Here it all feels wooden though, as the writers are too focused on getting their point across. Aaron Sorkin is another culprit of this too as every character he has is basically a pulpit for him to preach to the audience."

netflix,38tw9o,digital-atheist,-4,Mon Jun 8 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"But you don't think it kind of exploited LGBT people at all? I mean sure Lana's trans and it means she's part of the community but I don't think it felt natural at all. By your reasoning the Vikings on the History channel should have more people of colour because you don't often see them in nordic culture.  Sure you don't see many, if any, authentic love/sex scenes between LGBT, but I found it was gratuitous and often didn't add all that much to the story. Eventually I started to find them boring as hell. It was like I was being hit over the head that LGBT are sexual beings. Well so are hetero people and there wasn't nearly as much hetero sex scenes in the series. Even the one there was wasn't nearly as explicit and in your face as all the LGBT ones.  I'm all for more representation in the media of all minorities, LGBT included. But the way it was done almost makes some of the story feel like it was written by a child more interested in soap boxing then telling a compelling story. It was borderline soft porn as far as I'm concerned and often didn't further the character development or story at all.  I mean wouldn't it be better that instead of being a stereotype that gets exploited that LGBT were just like everyone else with no more or less attention to any aspects of their lives than anyone else? I kind of feel that much of the pro LGBT we see today is disingenuous and LGBT get's exploited under the guise of being all inclusive by much of our media currently.  Unless I'm off base and all LGBT are pretty much nymphomaniacs, I think it's a gimmick used to garner praise for being lifestyle friendly. And the fact that Lana Wachowski is trans should make her feel ashamed for doing it.  TL/DR While I applaud the inclusion of LGBT in the story I found the LGBT sex gratuitous and excessive, adding nothing to character or story development and feel it was kind of exploitative in nature."
netflix,38tw9o,Gezzer52,8,Fri Jun 12 23:03:56 2015 UTC,"What i find more interesting is how you don't seem to mind the ""gratuitous"" violence in the film? Or maybe you did but decided just to focus on the gay sex. Odd. Anyways, no i didn't find it exploiting at all. Out of curiousity do you find all types of movies with intense sex scenes off putting? Most of the time people rave about the ""steamy"" and scandalous sex scenes in films. Think about it.   When Broke Back Mountain came out people were floored with the scenes, why? Because it was never really explored in mainstream hollywood films on that level. Now a show comes a long, a tv show, and it goes further.   Sure some people won't understand it. I get it. I'm sure the creators expected it though. It's funny, really. When someone doesn't fully understand something. Take for example that last Game of Thrones episode. Some people that obviously didn't read the books or follow the show that attentively assumed it was for ""shock value"". A gimmick. They couldn't be more wrong. Right? Maybe you don't watch GOT.   Anyways, you are off base. The LGBT community (according to twitter) has been extremely supportive of the show and have loved every scene you may have felt bothered by."
netflix,38tw9o,digital-atheist,-5,Sat Jun 13 06:59:42 2015 UTC,"The one thing about the violence, it works in the context of the scene it occurs in. And I'm not so much bother by the sex scenes but more perplexed by why there's so many LGBT ones, and after a while became bored with them more then anything. I would of felt the same if there were numerous straight sex scenes in it with little to do with character or story development.  A perfect example of what I mean is the contrast to the Latin characters relationship. It seemed that it was almost only based on sex the way it was portrayed. It was like the writers had them constantly deep throating each other to send a message. But on the other hand when the character had his epiphany and went back to the bar where he rejected the bar tender I thought that kiss was great. It said that he'd come to terms with who he was and wasn't going to hide any more. But it's like the writers are mostly saying that LGBT love is best expressed sexualy then any other way. Which to me makes the LGBT characters more emotionally one dimensional compared to the other characters.  The one that made me start thinking this way was the one where they continually cut back and forth between a steamy love scene with Nomi and her lover and a innocuous exchange between two of the other characters. Before that I was pretty much just bored with them because they were so numerous and started to lose any potential impact to the story. After I started feeling that there was more than what met the eye to all the scenes. It's like it's pandering to the LGBT community more than celebrating it and feels a bit exploitative to me.  The question in my mind is it a crass way of creating a community of staunch supporters with it's pandering at the cost of creating a good compelling and believable story? At this point I really can't say. I guess I'll have a better idea with season two.  Oh and I do watch GoT I'm just a bit behind on the episods if you understand what I'm saying. So I'm not too sure which GoT you're referring to. And I don't think you understand me completely. It's not the LGBT sex, it's the numerous amounts of it that really says very little other than LGBT people have sex and we want you to have no doubt of the fact. So we'll show it to you over and over again till you reach a numbing saturation point with it. If it doesn't serve the story, it's obviously there for another purpose wouldn't you say?"
netflix,38tw9o,Gezzer52,5,Thu Jun 11 06:29:21 2015 UTC,"There is a lot. I agree. But there is also a lot of violence, a lot of cheese, a lot of exposition about identity, morality and humanity. These are Wachowski sensibilities. Either you dig their style or you don't.   It's not for everybody."
netflix,38tw9o,digital-atheist,39,Thu Jun 11 06:48:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not gay and/or transgender or what have you, I'm a plain old heterosexual male and I really don't get the whole ""forced homosexual references"" thing that some people seam to see in the show. What ""forced"" means is ""Let's shove it in there, no matter what!"" That's not happening with sense8. We have 8 characters, two of them are either gay and/or transgender. That still leaves 6 people who, as far as I can tell, are all heterosexual. So actually you could make the argument that the show is closer to having ""forced heterosexual references"" than any other sexual preference. - But why is that even that important for the show? I'm not saying that to sound liberal or anything, I really would like to know."
netflix,38tw9o,Abyss_85,12,Thu Jun 11 23:40:04 2015 UTC,"3 episodes in and Ive seen two lesbians and two gays having sex in GoT style scenes. Havent seen any of the other couples yet in a sex scene. Also there are two gay guys kissing in the opening in each and every episode. Not to mention the two lesbians kissing in every single moment they are together...  Not that I am against homosexuals or anything, but seems a bit forced to me, like they are trying too much! Also, I am at episode 5 now and some of the scenes are just so cringy, especially the acting (dialogue) could have been better. Anyway, I like the storyline so far so lets hope that it will just get better."
netflix,38tw9o,zhuki,45,Fri Jun 12 03:32:34 2015 UTC,There is a straight couple having sex in the second episode but you must have blocked it out because you couldnt get that hot throbing gay scene out of your head.
netflix,38tw9o,crashdemon,5,Sat Jun 6 23:55:18 2015 UTC,hahah maybe
netflix,38tw9o,zhuki,17,Sun Jun 7 00:09:12 2015 UTC,"I have seen all 12 episodes and I don't feel it was forced at all. The whole point is to show that the 8 people are different and what is important in their lifes, that's why they show it. It's a pretty standard thing to do in the beginning. It's the show saying ""Okey guys, this is the gay dude, he is an actor, this is the transgender girl, she doesn't like her family and is in love with the girl she is kissing, this is the German guy, he doesn't like his family either..."" etc.   As for the intro, it shows all kinds of people, because, as for the 8 people, the point is to show how different and at the same time similar people are. Maybe not the deepest message, but certainly not a ""forced homosexual"" one. - And again, lets say it were, why would that be important for the show?"
netflix,38tw9o,Abyss_85,7,Sun Jun 7 06:39:51 2015 UTC,It was so absurdly heavy on exposition in the pilot that it was almost laughable. Everyone was just openly stating their character traits. I hope that future showrunners and film directors learn a lesson from Fury Road and let us learn about the world and characters as we watch the film instead of frontloading us with a bunch of stuff that would be way more interesting if we learned it while getting to know the characters instead of just being told it upfront.
netflix,38tw9o,weevil_boy,4,Sun Jun 7 12:27:08 2015 UTC,Yeah that scene with the Hindu girl is much more tell; than it is show.
netflix,38tw9o,Ghetto-Swag,-1,Sun Jun 7 00:40:30 2015 UTC,"And again, lets say it were, why would that be important for the show?   Because as I said, to me it seems like they are trying to be different, an they are just trying too much.   Anyway, as long as the show is nice, I don't really care."
netflix,38tw9o,zhuki,2,Sun Jun 7 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"I would argue that, rather than ""trying to be different"" I'd almost say the one of the points of the series is to show that everyone's life is incredibly different and there's so much more to the world out there than just what you yourself experience."
netflix,38tw9o,Asterne,-3,Sun Jun 7 02:39:23 2015 UTC,Well I love this tv show  But let's face it   It was forced :/
netflix,38tw9o,slimkhan,4,Sun Jun 7 12:31:55 2015 UTC,"I agree, to me Nomi is easily the most boring character, but she gets the most screen time. I find her acting sub par and her story not all that exciting. and when her other talent gets revealed its just cringe worthy, and falls for the same thing every show does, being that it makes no sense and it incredibly fake.  That being said, the gay actor is my favourite character, he has a lot of depth and pretty funny with his trio. overall im enjoying the show a bunch but i feel like Nomi was really put in there because of the Watchowskis history."
netflix,38tw9o,GlenCoco701,3,Mon Jun 15 16:53:32 2015 UTC,Was just saying to a friend of mine that if you're going to give a character the ability to easily hack everything with a few clicks of a button then you might as well just say fuck it and give them heat vision and flying powers as well.

I totally agree with you; I mean wow did they really have to show the wet dripping rainbow strapon fall to the floor. ""happy pride!""  I'm going to give it another shot later, but if the LGBT segment doesn't become more interesting (like all of the other 7), i'm going to remain pretty sour."

netflix,38tw9o,TheManWithNoHair,6,Mon Jun 15 21:34:05 2015 UTC,"I did not count the sex scences, but I'm pretty sure there was more... And of course showing or not showing ""heterosexual references"" can be done through much more than just sex. And when it comes to ""agendas""... Every piece of art (I will call sense8 art here, because at the end of the day it is) has them or at least a message it wants to tell, that's not inherently a bad thing.   I think the message of the show is (so far in a nutshell) ""We're all different, but we are also similar and we're stronger and better when we use that."" Gays and transgender people fit perfectly in that theme, If the shows ""agenda"" really were only about them, they would have made a show about gays and  transgender people."
netflix,38tw9o,Abyss_85,-2,Tue Jun 9 00:03:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with imma_horse_AMA and for refence I am straight but I shared a flat with 3 gays guys and made posters for pride. It was forced, it wasn't the gay-ness it was the forced-ness. Like the fact that they say they're a couple, no shit I got that from the sex scene. The explanation of LGBT issues rather than showing the conflict through arguments. The mean lesbians might as well have said ""We're being mean to you because we don't like trans-gender people"". I think the couple of frames where the wet strap-on hit the ground was too much but other than that it wasn't about what they were showing it's that they were telling. It's bad writing and felt very forced.   It's the same with the girl in London and the drugs. Over explaining. The guy might as well be saying ""I'm going to take you to a place where there are drugs so you can take some drugs, I like drugs drugs are cool""  Say basically says ""Yes drugs, I'm going to take these drugs because I have a drug problem,mmmm drugs, yum""  I have only seen the first ep for context. The writing was so shite I couldn't go on."
netflix,38tw9o,price-iz-right,15,Tue Jun 9 06:00:49 2015 UTC,"If it bothers you then it bothers you, but honestly I find these critiques quite shallow. It's a fringe element of the show."
netflix,38tw9o,Asterne,-5,Sun Jun 7 02:16:43 2015 UTC,"You described my thoughts about the show exactly. I tried looking around on Reddit to see if I was the only one that felt that way, and I'm seeing a whole lot of ""the show isn't forcing a homosexual agenda, you just don't like gay people!"" ...don't shame me because I think a show is a bit corny, even without the LGBT themes it would be corny.   Edit: reading through the comments here and it's exactly the same as other places discussing the show. There are 3 types of viewers for this show it seems, based on this thread:   I love the show despite its shortcomings. The gay/trans stuff doesn't bother me. You have to give the show time to get better. Anyone who doesn't like it must be homophobic I hate the show. The gay stuff is just too much, I swear I'm not homophobic (well maybe a little) This show is corny. The dialogue sucks. The acting sucks. All the stereotypes are shoehorned in (yes, even gasp the LGBT tropes!) overall just not a good show.   I'm more along the lines of #3. This show is just trying too hard and falling flat all over the place."

Orange is the New Black and House of Cards had a lot of cringey sexual content.  I mean, I get it, you're not on network and you want to spread your wings. But the wet dildo hitting the floor in episode one was juvenile as hell."
netflix,38tw9o,ArtxVandelay,19,Sun Jun 7 05:30:55 2015 UTC,I laughed at that dildo scene and thought it was great. To each their own. That one orgy mind fuck scene was pretty damn hot too.

netflix,38tw9o,Shloop_Shloop_Splat,0,Sun Jun 7 13:47:00 2015 UTC,"I think the way the gay characters are portrayed is kind of odd. They seem to be written as if the person writing them buys into the whole sex-crazed sexual deviant stereotype. The fact that they're always making out, and in the title sequence there are two gay men doing kind of the same (plus an ice cream)."
netflix,38tw9o,ArtxVandelay,10,Sun Jun 7 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't think any of characters seemed sex crazed/deviant.  Sexuality is also an important part of the show, so I think having it shown in the beginning sequence is appropriate"

Like, Amanita and Nomi were going at it and Lito was having a hard time, and when Wolfgang was having (pretty graphic hetero) sex, Kala was getting hot under the collar."
netflix,38tw9o,Rickardz,2,Sun Jun 7 23:02:18 2015 UTC,I just feel like the gay characters' sexuality is handled differently than the hetero characters'.

For me it's really different, but whatever as long as the characters are believable in it I'm good (sometimes they fall short admittedly). I mean you have to suspend some level of reality to buy into the show. The Mexican guy is kind of annoying, but I'm cool with the rest. You don't usually see this level of gayness on TV, and when it's HBO/SHO throwing in titties in a show people don't mind. I think the Wakowski's are making a statement blasting the gay theme into it, and whatever I'm fine with it. I think it'll tone down, and settle more into the plot."

One thing I haven't seen mentioned but have a hard time believing that nobody else has noticed.  Not only is the cinematography simply amazing throughout, but there seems to have been a real focus on having as many different colors as possible on screen ALL the time.  Half the show makes television demo reels look drab by comparison, and I keep imagining the directors shutting down a scene to throw a fit about there not being enough colors in the frame.  SERIOUSLY glad this came out right after I got a new monitor that does it justice."

The font choice is a little odd for a mega budget production, I'll give you that."
netflix,38tw9o,-Hegemon-,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:38:51 2015 UTC,"IMO it feels generic. The slow, droning music and quick cuts of what could easily be stock footage have no continuity. It doesn't set any kind of tone for the show, just feels like filler. These Netflix originals are meant to be binge watched, so I can't understand the reasoning for the 2 min long intros.

The point is to whisk you around the world so you can experience all these different stories, emotions, and perspectives, not to give you an incredibly in depth look at each character's life. We have plenty of shows that have unbelievable character depth, Sense8 has no obligation to be one of them."

Even more so, Nomi was SO INCREDIBLY AND CLEARLY a Mary Sue for Lana that it was very, very distracting.

The dialog was the most forced and unnatural of maybe any TV show I've ever seen. One of the first lines is some guy calling a girl ""my love."" It's like a parody but not funny.   Almost 10% of people on IMDB gave it 1/10, which is the most I've seen. If you watch it with any kind of critical eye, it's awful. That said, if I was 13 years old, it would seem like a good show."

Like the kid in the first episode that got shot, or the pride parade, or the orgy sex scene - none of these contribute to the story, you wouldn't notice a difference if they were cut out, they just make it slower and more painful to watch for me.

netflix,38vu17,azhazal,2,Sun Jun 7 10:34:54 2015 UTC,"Netflix has the U.S. release of the movie. And that was altered at the parents request.  Portman's parents were worried about the smoking scenes in the film. Before they allowed their daughter to sign, they worked out a contract with Besson which had strict mandates on young Natalie's smoking scenes. There could only be five of them; Mathilda couldn't be shown inhaling or exhaling smoke; and the character would quit during the course of the film. All these mandates were followed if you watch the film closely. Mathilda has five smoking scenes, never inhales or exhales  The initial cut of the film had more scenes with ""awkward sexual tension"" between Mathilda and Léon. These scenes were later removed for the American release at the request of Natalie's parents, but were included in the 1996 European release, as well as in the deleted scenes of the special edition DVD. They were reintegrated back into the film for the ""International Cut,"" which is now available on Blu-ray/DVD."

netflix,38w36n,Hypetys,2,Sun Jun 7 10:42:16 2015 UTC,"Netflix produced seasons 8 and 9, the Swearnet movie and Don't Legalize It and will be producing all Swearnet/TPB properties in the future.  New Zealand may have laws prohibiting the streaming of the show due to heavy drug use/content, I really don't know.    However, Netflix doesn't ""own"" the show.  Robb Wells, John Paul Tremblay and Mike Smith own Trailer Park Boys, as they secured the rights to the property from the producers about two years ago."
netflix,38w36n,alsorobots,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:06:45 2015 UTC,Netflix when it comes to originals are like pretty much every TV network and they just commission shows rather than produce them (HBO are one of the few that produce the shows themselves). The commissioning outlet gets first run rights in their home market but all other rights are retained by the production company who made it.  When it comes to Netflix there is a slight difference in that while they commissioning region of Netflix gets first run (Most of the shows are commissioned by Netflix US but some of the other regions have content coming) they also have first option on foreign rights in any region they operate in at the time of the show starting for a set fee.  If they don't operate in a country then the production company is free to sell it to the highest bidder (which is why some Netflix regions don't have all the Netfflix originals)  With a continuation like Trailer Park Boys it gets more confusing. When international rights are sold it often has additional conditions. For example Prison Break has a whole mini series that exists that Fox didn't show which was made because they were a few episodes short of their required number for international sales. Dollhouse was the same where the episode Epitaph 1 exists simply for international requirements and Fox didn't air it.  And international deals can also be for multiple seasons but those seasons may never get made BUT that deal is still in place so if more episodes are commissioned by another outlet the rights for these episodes still belong to broadcasters who already have international rights   So it's most likely something like this that's preventing it being on NZ Netflix. Or perhaps it's NZ deciding not to buy the NZ rights because the previous seasons may have been sold to another service before hand so Netflix could have the new episodes but not the previous episodes which they may think is confusing and makes the new episode less appealing to the masses

Often decorated, many matatu feature portraits of the famous or slogans and sayings.  The music they play is also aimed at quickly attracting riders.   These minibuses ply set routes, run from termini, and are used for both inter and intra-city travel.  In addition to a driver, matatu may be staffed by a conductor.

netflix,38sza8,laxor09,4,Sat Jun 6 21:28:06 2015 UTC,"I think sometimes people forget what an amazing value Netflix is. And that it didn't always used to be that cheap. The entire streaming piece is an added aspect of their business for goodness sake. They have innovated before and we'll again. It's easy to see that this is an incredibly new, fluid, and competitive market if you have the perspective of even a decade of history."
netflix,38sza8,pwnicholson,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:12:24 2015 UTC,"Still, every service has to be compared to other alternatives on the market. In this case the alternative is buying concerts on DVD/Blu-Ray. I doubt that there are many people who spent $100 per year on these, since there just aren't that many releases every year. I buy maybe 2-3 per year of my favorite bands, so paying a monthly fee of 7.99 just doesn't make sense, because I'd pay a lot more and don't even know if my favorite bands are in Qello."
netflix,38sza8,laxor09,0,Sun Jun 7 14:01:28 2015 UTC,"If that's your standard then you are absolutely right.  The thing about these services though is that they change behavior for many people. They allow them to achieve aspirational goals, not simply offer a better value on something they would otherwise do.  Not many people watched a new movie (practically) every night of their lives before, but lots of people do now. Even if just renting from blockbuster, that would have cost a fortune back in the day. I know I certainly wouldn't have spent more than about $50 in movies a year previously, but I still use Netflix and like it. It certainly isn't saving me money. I'm spending more. But I find Netflix a great service because it makes what I'd like to do possible, not what I would do already do cheaper. I think most Netflix users are in a similar position.  No question the market for Qello is smaller than Netflix, but like OP I'm a music fan and would love to picture myself watching some legendary performers on a nightly basis in my living room, even though I would never dream of spending that much on DVDs.  edit: typos, clarity"
netflix,38sza8,pwnicholson,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"Prior to Netflix streaming, most of my friends had pretty good sized DVD collections. I know at least 2 of them had 5 disk DVD players and would watch one or two movies a night, then cycle something new in every couple of days. Then every week or two you would trade DVDs with your friends, so you're always getting new content. It wasn't a very expensive habit either. $10 in the bargain bin every week led to a huge selection.  Throw in a DVD burner and rentals if you wanted to get really inexpensive.  I know back in the VHS days, some of our local stores would do 2x Tuesday rentals for $2 and return on Thursday.  It wasn't that hard to get continual content with a relatively low cost back in the day."

netflix,38thn3,ziggythebear,5,Sat Jun 6 18:24:52 2015 UTC,"Sound of Noise   A group of intellectual musicians decide to perform acts of ""musical terrorism"" in their city in an effort to combat what they perceive to be a threat from mainstream commercial music. If you liked Submarine this would probably be right up your alley. Very funny and ultimately very tender.   In Bruges   Already been recommended and I have to agree. This film has a well-written script with some very clever dialogue. Pretty dark comedy.   The Trip   A British film; the dialogue and the acting here is about as witty as it gets. I wouldn't say the plot is lacking, but it's so simple that it might put off someone who is used to a traditional three-act structure. This film is less about the plot and more about the contrast between its two protagonists, and it's a masterful example of how a character study can carry a film on its own. There's a sequel (The Trip to Italy) which I haven't seen, but I suspect it's not as good.   Our Idiot Brother   Don't judge this one by its cover. Groundbreaking independent cinema this ain't, but it succeeds in its comedic delivery of a solid story with a lot of heart.   Mary & Max   A claymation film starring Toni Collette and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Two great actors starring in a great film that's equally funny and tragic.   We Are the Best!   Not sure if I'd call this one a comedy (I think I only laughed out loud once or twice watching it), but it's a great film and if you liked Submarine I can't really point to anything else that is more similar to that film than this. Like Submarine, it's a sincere coming of age story, and like Submarine, it has some very impressive performances from unknown young actors."

The first few episodes require patience, but it pays off and each subsequent gets better.  I appreciate the comic relief that is given with measure.  This series is has a lot of future potential, I suspect the story arc will take more than the first season to reveal all the central elements.  I for one am looking forward to it.  The Wachowski's will likely shine in this type of format as it gives the time to develop characters, complicated storylines and subplots that movies and those masters limit."
netflix,38n8tp,DarkVenaGe,2,Sat Jun 6 10:04:13 2015 UTC,"It's amazing.   The individual story arcs are a bit generic and cliché but this isn't a story about individuals. It's about a group of strangers from all over the world becoming one trough a strange power. It's a show about unity. I can't recommend it enough, but it's important to keep an eye on the bigger picture during the series. Also, the action sequences are tight as hell, and the way they show us this power/connection is fantastic."
netflix,38n8tp,TheManWithNoHair,5,Sat Jun 6 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"I'm about halfway through episode 2 right now. Feeling like it's so busy trying to be progressive and modern, especially with the 'on the nose' LGBT scenes and bad monologues (that scene where she's writing her 'pride' blog while she monologues and cries... I was so embarrassed for the writers I almost couldn't make it through) that it forgets to be interesting story-wise. I'm wondering if this is something the actual LGBT community would enjoy seeing or if they find it obnoxious as well.  I'm hoping the writers are just getting it out of their systems early on so we can start seeing some of the scifi/fantasy elements and plot that the trailer hints at begin to play out. As others have said the cinematography is definitely the most interesting part so far."

It does have a slow start and jumps around a lot, but if you watched the trailer that should have been expected.  There's no real way to tell 8 different stories completely without a lot of jumps or throwing some of them into background roles that never get really developed.    Even knowing that it still seemed to take a while to get invested in.  Heroes was practically the same, holding back what most of us were watching for to develop the characters before throwing much of any of the sci-fi stuff into the mix, teasing with quick glimpses of what they could do, but then back to long stretches of normalcy while you get to know people.  As for the complaints about the LGBT characters, I couldn't disagree more.  They are just people, and most people aren't clones of each other.  I'm not gay myself, but seeing them on screen disturbs me no more than watching someone write with their left hand, which is actually about as common as being LGBT and just as much a choice."

WTF is this? we were expecting some matrix coolness and we got tranny sex
netflix,38n8tp,Kinglink,-5,Sat Jun 6 16:41:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, it's... bad  Just bad.   It's got a very liberal mindset, two characters are a transsexual, and gay respectively.   They're ever type of cliche story line, in the first episode there's a cop with a child who is shot in an ER, and the nurse is trying to turn him away.  Now get this, there's a dying kid, and the nurse says ""go somewhere else.""  WHAT THIRD WORLD COUNTRY IS THIS?    Oh Chicago.  And that's the real problem, The transexual says a line ""no one has ever stood up for me before"".  The gay guy has a beard who didn't know and finds out.  Every character has the most cliche story line they can think of and none of it is that good.  The cliche part isn't the biggest problem, it's the writing around it, it feels like they took the most obvious words and put them in everyone's mouth.   I've heard the fourth episode ""makes it great"". But honestly at this rate, if four doesn't completely change everything, I won't be giving it another.  It's weak, which has become the sign of the Wachoskis after the first Matrix.  Sadly.   Edit: apparently getting downvoted for sharing a negative opinion.  Anyways got to the fifth episode.. Yawn..  Maybe other people are enjoying it, but it's a lot of style, with a lack of substance.  The acting is what really kills it.  Though the story isn't much better."
netflix,38n8tp,b0rgerking,4,Sat Jun 6 08:45:22 2015 UTC,"Sadly the only unbelievable part of the hospital scene you mention is that we see the nurse that decided to treat the child later, and she's not being escorted out by security.  Many hospitals facing budget issues have closed or scaled back their trauma centers and in so doing can't treat gunshot victims, even if taking them elsewhere means they likely won't survive.  Especially in Chicago this has been an issue for decades that has caused many protests and has not really improved at all."
netflix,38n8tp,OccupyGravelpit,7,Sat Jun 6 11:47:20 2015 UTC,"Why is this being downvoted? The dialogue is awful (seriously awful) and the first few episodes have no dramatic tension at all. That, and it seems designed for 12 year olds. I get that the Matrix has always been for adolescents first, but it feels like they dropped the intended age down about 4 years on this one.  I've enjoyed the Wachowskis, even when they're doing something oddball and weird -- Speed Racer is a great little movie -- but Sens8 is just boring and lazily written. Totally disappointing."
netflix,38n8tp,MrCarey,-7,Sat Jun 6 17:42:30 2015 UTC,"Jesus, there is a lot of hate because of the tranny role. She isn't that bad at all. There is also no gay sex so far, for those of you that think that's a dealbreaker. There is a gay couple, but they don't force sex on you. I know that would make you die, so I figured it's worth a mention."

I'm not a part of that clique, trust me. But at the same time, we can disagree with ideas whilst remaining civil in doing so. I think that a good deal of what passes for discourse in the trans community is histrionic bullshit, and deserves to be treated as such, but those are ideas which we're arguing against. Using terms which we know to be offensive and whose POINT is to be offensive wins no arguments, no hearts, no minds. Their sole utility is to hurt, to alienate and to demean.  I'll call a transgender person foolish, hyperbolic, hateful or dismissive for their words, actions and attitudes if that's what their words, actions or attitudes are. But to demean them for what they ARE is a different sort of thing. It's not a criticism; it's an insult. It has no merit. It has no weight to it, any more than calling a person a nigger, a chink or a kike. All it does is communicate that you're the sort of person who hates on the basis of what a person is. If you're the sort of person who cares about reasoned, civil discourse, you should be above that sort of thing."
netflix,38n8tp,Kinglink,-1,Sat Jun 6 21:32:45 2015 UTC,The real issue I have with the tranny role is she and the gay couple are so cliché and poorly written.  She had one of the more interesting arcs in the first three except everyone around her is written as if a high school student was told to write a story about a transexual.  Everything from the dialogue to the family is... What you expect from Hollywood.
netflix,38n8tp,Coldara,5,Sat Jun 6 10:42:33 2015 UTC,"as if a high school student was told to write a story about a transexual   i mean one of the wachowskis is transexuell, guess that is her experience."

You are definitely going outside the bounds of their TOS, and they could easily justify banning your account...   But that would just be throwing money away and promoting piracy...

netflix,38rov1,unogs,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:13:05 2015 UTC,I was worried about my account. Foreign Netflix would help me hear the language. I'd love to do it. But mah account!
netflix,38q4ry,Chrotesque,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:56:06 2015 UTC,"If you live in a region where French is an official language, and english isn't, Netflix will almost always only offer you French. It doesnt matter if your account is set English as preferable. Only with a smart DNS or VPN set to US/CA/UK can you have anime with EN subs.  For anime, Instead of Netflix try www.crunchyroll.com you can watch free with comercials."

As in, at this point we know that the main characters will be linked as if they were one person. I'm afraid that the show might give us an answer for why they have that power, along with putting the characters in situations that will emphasize the ramifications of it, but without actually developing the power itself any further. Just the vibe I'm getting from the promo material so far."

Animator: I think I'll make a Tarzan cartoon.  Disney Rep: Instantly appearing out of black smoke Tarzan is a licensed product of the Disney corporation.  Animator: Wait, you didn't invent Tarzan.   Disney: We invented the idea of animating Tarzan.  Animator: No you didn't.  Disney:  We made the film that people remember most, so if you make something, then people might not remember our film most.  Animator: But this was created by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Disney: Well, then you must state that explicitly in the title or people will think you are stealing from us.   Animator: But you stole from Burroughs?  Disney: But we did it with enough success to claim it as our own.  In all seriousness, I think redditors are way too harsh on intellectual property laws, but I really, really hate how Disney heavily litigates in favor of stricter copyrights and trademarks while simultaneously being one of the largest benefactors (if not the largest) of public domain properties."

What killed it for me was the way the characters all act like children regardless of their age (the teenaged characters in Avatar are lightyears more mature than even the adult characters in LoK). I don't think my eyes have ever rolled as hard as they did during the infamous ""fart bending"" scene in season one.  The most disappointing thing for me is that it's coherent enough that I can see what they were going for but they were rushed by Nickelodeon and forced to smash an entire season of plot and character development into like ten episodes, so the pacing is all wrong. In general, it just felt to me like the whole thing missed it's mark.  But that was my experience.

netflix,38f1or,wakey87433,-8,Wed Jun 3 21:21:54 2015 UTC,"You are pirating it though. And before everyone starts downvoting me please hear me out first.  I'm not Canadian so I'm not familiar with BCE itself so I will use the UK Equivalent of your cable companies in North America. That being Sky TV who provide paytv both in the forum of channels they operate and 3rd party channels they carry. Their channels are used to get subscribers to the whole service and they pay handsomely for popular content from the US. If rather than watching a show on Sky I choose to switch Netflix region (or subscribe to say Hulu or HBO Now and use a VPN to access it) and watch it that way Sky lose out, they have paid over the odds for content. Now thats not really a problem for them as long as I keep paying for Sky, although it may hit their ad revenue but if I stop thats revenue netflix (or other US service) is taking from them. So for them it doesn't matter if you VPN or Torrent you are still being a pirate because they paid for the rights and they aren't getting the benefit as you are accessing content from a provider who isn't licenced to show you it which is piracy  Now the money Sky is paying for this content is important, it allows the production company to keep the licence fees they charge the commissioning network down, generally the commissioning network(s) pay no more than 50% of the total production costs,international sales allow some to be slashed significantly to keep it in production when the figures the commissioning network gets don't justify it(Fringe for example or currently Hannibal). If the likes of Netflix cut into the international ratings and international broadcasters start paying less due to this it makes shows less viable to produce. Netflix might be able to offset some of that by paying a bit more but the rights for many of the shows you would switch region for are regions where the going rate of TV is much lower. Somewhere like the Netherlands is always going to have a going rate lower than the UK as we have more large media companies competing for the same rights. So now for the production companies its maybe slightly better for them than torrents but they are still losing out on revenue (Sky are paying HBO £55mill a year for first run access and outside GoT you are generally looking at viewing figures of less than 400k. They aren't going to make that from VPN users accessing HBO Now, they would need almost 500k paying every month to have a revenue of that amount if they offered the service directly to the UK and would have lots of extra costs that they don't have with the sky deal)  So its easy to be critical of these people who come out against VPN's as we want access to extra content but and we can justify that its better than torrents but but for many parties in the chain its no different and it does potentially hurt the content we enjoy. Its certainly no way the simple picture we sometimes assume it is when looking at it from our pov"

netflix,38f1or,nosotros_road_sodium,3,Thu Jun 4 04:48:33 2015 UTC,With the globalization of culture I wonder why studios don't make rights to their programs worldwide.
netflix,38f1or,wakey87433,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:05:12 2015 UTC,"Who are these global broadcasters who can afford to buy global rights. The cost of the global rights has to be the same amount they get from selling indvidually which is never going to be the case when networks/streaming services don't operate in these countries.  Lets say Netflix had wanted the global rights to Mad Men. He in the UK when it was on a OTA BBC channel its best ratings was 355k. Sky poached it and we're paying £3mill a season for it but on Sky it was getting a fraction of that often as low as 45k and that's with Sky having more subscribes than Netflix. So for Netflix to grab global rights they would have to had paid over the odds for the UK part of the deal for a niche show. Now imagine the UK is a country Netflix hadn't launched in yet, paying £3mill for a show in a country that they don't operate in is just burning money.  And even on their originals they don't hold global rights. They have first refusal at an agreed rate in any country they had already launched in when the show started but in every other country the rights reverted back to the production company who were free to sell them and did. Even if they later launch in a country they aren't guaranteed the rights back, they have to negotiate for them when the current deal with the other outlet expires  A final thing is that often rights holders aren't the same globally. One company may have the rights to sell it in one country but another one has them in a different one. The shield for example was like this until recently as Fox had North American rights but Sony held the rest. Or you have Rome/Band of Brothers where HBO own the rights in the America's but BBC own the rights elsewhere."

netflix,38f1or,Auroness,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:09:36 2015 UTC,I like how they are the  company that makes money by forcing customers to take hundreds of channels and packages we don't want.  Want to watch one show on AMC? You have to take the other 100 channels int he package and pay $$$$ for it.
netflix,38f1or,wakey87433,0,Thu Jun 4 14:04:41 2015 UTC,"Bundles aren't as bad as people assume. It actually ends up being better for the average customer and for the channels themselves.  For example for all the 'basic' channels on Sky in the UK it's £36 a month. There are maybe 6 of those I watch enough to expressly pay for them if it was al la carte. However we have a few channels you can buy seperatly and I pay for one of those which costs £6 a month and this isn't really a channel full of expensive content so it can operate on such a relatively low cost. Something like Sky Atlantic would almost certainly need to be more. However even at £6 a month those 6 channels come to £36. And while some of the other channels are ones I wouldn't pay for it doesn't mean they aren't ones I do sometimes watch just not enough to really justify paying extra for. So I would be paying the same or perhaps more for less options.  And the channels themselves end up being worse off in most cases, they all get a carriage fee per subscriber so while channels in Sky's lowest pack all have something like 10mill subscribers even the most popular channel is going to be so far away from that that even they make more from carriage fees than they would on a specific subscription which is why the channels are generally happy to be part of the bundles. Many of the niche channels that some do have an interest in but not a massive amount would cease to exists and most others would need to slash budgets.  The main winners of going a la carte is actually the cable companies who would most likely end up making more from each customer. The Internet may change that in 5-10 years when the channels can go it alone where it may be the channels who benefit but they still need cable at this point.  And even then we will be the ones as usual who lose out"

With the paid options I prefer the SmartDNS route, VPN's have other advantages but the downside is the reduction in the speed you can achieve which can impact your streaming quality. A VPN's other advantages are less relevant when accessing something like Netflix. A SmartDNS does also impact your speed but no where near as  much as is normal with a VPN.

The entire Buster episode.  There is so much to love, but it takes a while to really savor. I think the reason season 4 didn't resonate was because of it's inability to be memed, honestly. It started the threads for new, weird jokes, that took so long to pay-off, if you have patience. For lack of a better word, and groan along with me, it was the most post-modern a sitcom could get.

netflix,38dx9p,JoeyHollywood,2,Thu Jun 4 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"1). The dialogue was poorly written. I understand that the film is lampooning 80s B-action films, but what makes a lampoon, parody, or homage good is to have, for lack of a better word, references back to the source material while replacing the genuinely unpleasant aspects of the source retooled, so as to make it enjoyable.    2). The delivery of lines was very sub-par (slurring, mumbling, etc). This can be attributed to the fact that they are not American, but it's a common trope in these films to overlay dialogue in post. In fact, it is often overlayed badly, so that it is apparent to those watching. For this reason, I believe it would have been better to overlay clearer dialogue in post.    3). The use of CGI was improper to the form, and this is my biggest problem with the film.

The actors and producers have all moved on to other things.   It would be very hard to get them back together.  Plus the show wasn't very popular when it was on.  A situation like ""Arrested Development"" is rare and unlikely to happen again for awhile.  The only reason it did was because not all the actors had to be together again."

netflix,387pxe,MondoHawkins,12,Tue Jun 2 13:20:33 2015 UTC,"""Continue Watching"" is just your ""Recently Watched"" list that was poorly renamed in a UI update."
netflix,387pxe,insomnic,3,Tue Jun 2 16:41:20 2015 UTC,Yeah... It'll lead to confusion for sure.  Especially since Netflix has no way to know if you are actually done watching it or not (doesn't know if sequential watching or need to skip back into a movie etc).
netflix,387pxe,mchvs,4,Tue Jun 2 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"Netflix knows when you finished watching any video, as described on this article - it's when the credits appear and the suggestions are shown. In fact, a couple of months ago we had that ""things you still didn't finish watching"" list, that worked pretty well. I don't mind the current ""recently watched"" list (for some reason called ""continue watching""), but I'd love to have the old list back."
netflix,387pxe,insomnic,2,Tue Jun 2 20:19:53 2015 UTC,"It knows when you are technically at the end of an episode or film but it doesn't know when you're done with a series or episode functionally (fell asleep? watching out of order on purpose? new episodes soon? want to rewatch with someone?). Still, in the ""recently watched"" queue would be the next episode up on a list not the one just watched so the terminology wasn't right there either.  I think it's one of those things that will never be done in a way to make everyone happy.  Maybe a prompt... but then people who don't wanted to be prompted will be irritated. It'd be nice to have a way to remove things easily other than by going to the website.  I'm glad I'm not Netflix - having to decide which function is going to irritate the fewest number of people must be a full time job."
netflix,387pxe,whateveresque,4,Tue Jun 2 20:50:50 2015 UTC,"Same thing here. I have watched each and every episode of certain shows (I never skip the closing credits), and they still appear in the ""Continue Watching"" section.

netflix,387pxe,insomnic,2,Tue Jun 2 13:25:28 2015 UTC,How would they know you are done watching? Not every show is watched sequentially by everyone. What if it finished playing after you fell asleep? What if new episodes came out in 3 days?  It's poorly named because of this exact situation.

netflix,38bs60,real-dreamer,2,Wed Jun 3 04:58:58 2015 UTC,It's more like HBO running ads for their own content in between programs.  Not quite as distasteful as having to watch a Geico ad.
netflix,38bs60,TheBrownWelsh,2,Wed Jun 3 07:25:52 2015 UTC,"This is an ad based entertainment industry we live in. Netflix is cheap. Like, super cheap. And they have great programming.  If they're going to start putting ads for their own products before certain shows or movies in an effort to keep the price down, I'm not that against it. I imagine they won't be that long (30secs?) and I can just mute them anyway. I usually mute the intros to most shows so I don't see this as much different from that, other than I can skip the intros if I so choose.  Basically, I don't see this as much of a deal breaker as many others do. But I work in marketing so my tolerance for shitty ads is pretty high."

netflix,384tvp,ZombieRonSwanson,46,Mon Jun 1 21:28:07 2015 UTC,"The reasoning behind this is shaky at best. I can't really see why they would need to advertise their own shows when I'm going to watch Scrubs season 3 when I already get all the notifications in my e-mail and see the half-screen-wide ads for shows like OITNB and House of Cards on the front page of Netflix. There is probably not a single Netflix Original show that I have missed even though I rarely go specifically looking for them. It's always either on the front page or in me e-mail (just today I got a notification that Archer season 6 had arrived onto Netflix). I'd think they knew better but who knows what this could end up becoming? Is the chance of having third-party ads too far fetched in the end? [adjusts tinfoil hat]  Rather than these features that irritate so many, they should spend time creating lists for ""upcoming"" and ""going away"" titles that I don't have to seek them out on a third-party site. Such a simple feature sounds like it's a no-brainer but apparently it's not."

Many people even if they get the emails or see the image and text blurbs don't get grabbed by it as it doesn't really sell the content perfectly. A video promo gives a much better representation than text/images ever can.   Also there is a problem with people picking what to watch, even with recommendations, categories, ratings and blurbs people waste a lot of time looking and even then turning off as you have got the wrong content for you is common. Being able to help you decide on content allows users to spend more time watching content rather than selecting content"

I mean, the best way to test the system is to do it with your own content since there are no real advertisers yet. I've seen the same with new TV channels that may go the first month with little to none third-party ads and only showing promos of their own shows during commercial breaks and in-between shows.  However, I still want to give Netflix the benefit of the doubt since they have be advocating for some good things in the past."
netflix,384tvp,HenkkaArt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"There isn't enough money in online ads outside the US to make it viable to sell 3rd party ads. If they were a US only service it may be different as Hulu just about make it work but they would need ad sales teams specialising in every market they operate in. Just look at how Hulu struggle to sell all their ad space for a single market, they rarely max out the 4 ads per break and they have so few advertisers that the ads repeat too often and at times you get more Hulu promos that ads. It makes more sense for them to push their content to make sure you don't waste hours looking for content so get the most value for money (which they are all the data to do this more effectively, they know if you have already watched HoC so not to serve you ads for that until perhaps the ones for season 4 start showing up, they know if you don't like sitcoms so showing AD or UKS may not be best served and they know when they have already shown a promo for a show. They don't even need to restrict it to Netflix Originals either with good targeting)"

netflix,384tvp,TastyBrainMeats,2,Tue Jun 2 15:01:22 2015 UTC,I was advertised Daredevil after watching the complete series to a show. It was much better for me since I like to see these previews before watching a brand new show.
netflix,384tvp,coleblake07,23,Tue Jun 2 10:28:49 2015 UTC,That's a distinction without a difference.
netflix,384tvp,2a0c40,2,Mon Jun 1 22:34:16 2015 UTC,The difference is that they've been testing this for a long time and you've probably seen it and not been affected. The difference is that they state that they have decided not to implement a lot of the things they tested.   I remember seeing Daredevil and Marco Polo trailers in the background when I started Netflix a few months ago. I assume this was part of the testing. I haven't seen them since. The way the promo played was by playing in a frame that I could scroll away from. It was easy to stop. It was not intrusive and easy to avoid. They appear to have not adopted this model.  I agree that we should be vigilant. But the sky is not falling.
netflix,384tvp,peterkeats,-1,Tue Jun 2 15:44:43 2015 UTC,I consider it a big difference between promotional trailers and 2 minutes of ads every 10 minutes of content i.e. Hulu
netflix,384tvp,pwnicholson,38,Tue Jun 2 00:36:13 2015 UTC,Length of ads and whether or not it is an ad are two different discussions. No the ads aren't long. No they aren't for 3rd party content. But they are ads
netflix,384tvp,HenkkaArt,5,Tue Jun 2 00:40:51 2015 UTC,I find it funny in a way that in their own Help Center they describe ads and pop-ups when streaming video from Netflix to be ad adware or malware. :D  https://help.netflix.com/en/node/1891

Countries where they have ad restrictions almost all expressly excempt unpaid promos for content on the channel from the limits so they could fill a whole hour of promos if they wanted. So they aren't considered ads

netflix,384tvp,FaxImUhLee,-2,Tue Jun 2 15:00:52 2015 UTC,"Third party ads support the content, therefore the people who pay for those ads believe they have some say over what content is played. If they don't like what's played, they pull their ads, thus the shows lose money, thus they are beholden to that advertiser.   This is just Netflix showing off some of their other shows, asking for a few freaking seconds of your time."
netflix,384tvp,2a0c40,5,Tue Jun 2 15:07:20 2015 UTC,The whole problem is that they ask for my time. It makes no difference if they're showing a brand of toothpaste I don't want to buy or a show I don't want to watch. The difference is utterly irrelevant.

netflix,384tvp,phatwithaphd,-3,Tue Jun 2 15:45:09 2015 UTC,"One is previewing content also offered by the content-provider you are watching, the other is allowing other companies to try to sell you products and services. It's really not a whole lot different from the way new content shows up during the credits now. It's much more akin to movie previews in a theater (which lots of people show up for early in order to watch) than TV commercials (which people buy devices to allow them to skip). Regardless of the fact that a lot of people don't want this to happen, to say that there is no tangible difference between what Netflix is currently testing and third party advertisements is just not fair."

netflix,384csu,Whales96,21,Mon Jun 1 20:30:35 2015 UTC,"I presume that's why this says it's a test then. To figure out if it's more annoying or more helpful to people. You should send them a message and say you disapprove - it might have an impact.  I personally like the HBO trailers when I'm watching GoT - I'm excited for ballers and I hadn't even heard of it without them. YMMV, personal preference etc."
netflix,384csu,wablar2092,7,Mon Jun 1 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"Same, never was interested in True Detective before the GoT trailers."
netflix,384csu,evanx11,3,Mon Jun 1 21:54:01 2015 UTC,100% agree. I had never heard of Ballers until I saw an ad before a show on HBO and now I can't wait for it to premier. I don't get the big deal honestly. Why can't Netflix advertise their own stuff if it remains fairly unobtrusive?
netflix,384csu,kountbla,4,Tue Jun 2 06:32:21 2015 UTC,"As long as it's restricted to their own services I wouldn't mind. A lot of their original shows come out and get no attention at all, like Bloodline and that new show 'Between'. That one is so unheard of (and bad...) it doesn't even seem to have a subreddit yet."
netflix,384csu,rocktheprovince,3,Mon Jun 1 22:33:23 2015 UTC,"Between has had one episode aired, why would you think it would already have a subreddit?"
netflix,384csu,alli_cat,2,Tue Jun 2 01:28:20 2015 UTC,"Well it has 2, but usually subreddits are created before the show even airs. Off the top of my head, /r/bettercallsaul and more recently /r/waywardpines were created before their premiers and people were already there talking about it. After two episodes Between should have one, but I can hardly even find any discussion about it. The ones that do exist just unanimously say it sucks."
netflix,384csu,rocktheprovince,2,Tue Jun 2 03:28:30 2015 UTC,"I understand your gut negative reaction to the news.  I'm not too keen on ads myself.  At the same time, if its really just trailers for Netflix produced content and NOTHING else, I'd be okay with it.  Its just another way to see what else is on Netflix.  If it spreads beyond trailers, however, I'll be as pissed as you."
netflix,384csu,Ocarina654,4,Tue Jun 2 00:08:49 2015 UTC,"There's no way it doesn't spread to other things if people don't mind the Netflix ads.   I don't really want to pay Netflix to watch trailers of their shows. People are talking about it like that isn't an advertisement. It's the same thing. And you'd better believe if nobody cares they'll be moving to make more money on it when they can.   I'd pay $15 a month to not have the ads, if it's a revenue issue. Maybe 2 tiers an ad free for more than a no-ads. But if it's just ""ad testing"" but no option you should be against it, because it will almost certainly expand otherwise."
netflix,384csu,PyreDruid,8,Tue Jun 2 00:36:36 2015 UTC,Exactly why I'm really cautious about this.  The day I see on ad on Netflix is the day I spend my subscription money on a VPN instead and go back to torrents.
netflix,384csu,Ocarina654,3,Tue Jun 2 00:45:41 2015 UTC,I don't think it does necessarily spread to other ads. I believe Netflix wants to be more like HBO and less like a major network in the long run. And I think that they know the HBO model will be more successful and popular with consumers.
netflix,384csu,kountbla,2,Tue Jun 2 06:35:01 2015 UTC,"Hbo go shows ads for their content and it hasn't grown beyond that, so it doesn't always do that. One of the other major players does it and it's really not a big deal."

The typical argument against ads on streaming services is that you're already paying the subscription fee, so you shouldn't have to watch ads too. But Netflix gets no money for showing a trailer for their own content. Instead of a revenue stream, it's essentially Netflix showing you why you should continue to subscribe to their service. Maybe it'll work and maybe it won't but it isn't advertising in the traditional sense."

netflix,384csu,TastyBrainMeats,5,Tue Jun 2 15:15:18 2015 UTC,"Actually you are the one who needs the look it up. An ad is a paid for spot, what these are are promos. There is a difference which is why the BBC are free to run as many of these as they like (On their HD channel they run them for most of the time regional news is on as they don't have regional play out abilities in HD like they do for SD) and why in countries with limits on advertising promos for inhouse content is excerpt from the rules, they could run a full hour of promos in most cases)  As long as it's only a short promo and as long as they don't overdo them then it's a good thing. I know people who know of things like HoC, OITNB and the likes but haven't ever checked them out even though there is often a promo video available and the reason for that is it requires them to go and look for the promo, if they saw the promo it might actually introduce them to a show they would have otherwise missed out on.   As someone else said as well the HBOgo ones work pretty well, I watched Silicon Valley this morning and it had the Ballers promo. I hadn't heard of it, I'm not sure a brief description would have grabbed my interest but having seen the promo it's something I will now check out"
netflix,384csu,wakey87433,24,Mon Jun 1 21:40:12 2015 UTC,Promos are ads. They're just not 3rd party paid ads.

netflix,384csu,juslen,4,Tue Jun 2 00:39:06 2015 UTC,Do you think that if this goes over with no real issue that they won't expand to paid ads?
netflix,384csu,PyreDruid,0,Tue Jun 2 00:37:27 2015 UTC,"No because the complexity and costs of selling the ad space coupled with the lost subscribers would nullify much of the impact. Hulu is able to do it because they are selling ads to consumers in a single country but it gets increasingly difficult and expensive to sell online ads internationally. Even then you will notice it rarely sells its spaces fully out, I believe its supposed to be 4 ads per adbreak but its rarely that. 2 or 3  is usually the norm but you also often don't get ads or get served hulu promos because their inventory isn't large enough. Not to mention you get the same ads over and over most of the time"
netflix,384csu,wakey87433,0,Tue Jun 2 01:56:04 2015 UTC,"Still a worse experience for the viewer, I hope their test fails or i might as well go back to torrents, since Netflix won't be convenient anymore"

As long as they are done well which Netflix is perfectly capable of doing they are a bonus.  Myself I would have 1 before the show and it would tie into the user data. So it wouldn't show you one for something you have watched all episodes (but would give you promos about a new season of something you watched leading up to the new episodes), only showed you the ad once ever, only showed an ad once per sitting (so if you stick on House of Cards and binge you wouldn't see one every epiosde.Just at the start and maybe end.

In the time spent avoiding watching the ad, I could click on a torrent and already be watching it, since you can stream torrents. You even have say it would be ""not that bad."" Which means you acknowledge it is something bad.   It's just an annoyance that serves me absolutely no purpose. I'm already paying for the service, so showing more shows does not in any way get you more money. And I already know about what other shows I might want to watch because that's a service they already offer--when I specifically ask for it, and not while I'm trying to watch something else.  In fact, doing it with first party ads makes less sense than third party ones. At least third party ads get you more money.  That's why people assume this is just a stepping stone to first party ads, which would actually serve a purpose for Netflix. (Of course, most people would rather pay the extra 50 cents than watch a month's worth of ads, so third party ads are still stupid.)  The only reason why people use Netflix is that it is more convenient than torrents or illegal streaming sites. You inconvenience people, they are going to want to go elsewhere.  I already don't use any other service because of ads--unless my adblock can successfully get rid of them."

Threatening to steal content is not the way to argue, as the content you want will eventually disappear.   Their business model was designed to fight piracy. One of the key aspects of that was no advertisement; you're just free to stream content. Whether or not these programs will start to disappear if I pirate something, that's not the point. Piracy is Netflix's competition. They've done well so far out competing a service that is literally free.

Fast Forward was a feature on something called a VCR which played VHS tapes. These tapes, instead of ""Skipping"" forward like on a DVD you would ""Fast Forward"" which would speed up the playing of the tape to get through the part you didn't want to see. This was also available on Cassette tapes for audio back before the CD. The joke that you would have such a feature at your  Theater is a joke as you would have to be in control of the playback and of course you aren't.

Also, the distributor only wants to show trailers for movies they made so my Pacific Rim blu ray has a bunch of shitty trailers because WB didn't have anything good coming out at the time.  I guess what I'm saying is that this should be something you can opt in or out of. Do I love House Of Cards? Yes. And Bojack and Orange is the New Black. They make some great content but I don't want to see the trailer for Adam Sandler's Ridiculous Six 80 times."
netflix,384csu,Aquaman_Forever,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:41:38 2015 UTC,At least blu Ray tries to grab new trailers from the Internet. Although in my experience it screws it up and cuts out about 10 seconds in...

Then when you've done those two there are another three... About six months later we're back to living in caves eating squirrel on a stick."
netflix,384csu,2a0c40,8,Mon Jun 1 23:01:52 2015 UTC,Stop rationalizing. People like you are why Hulu has commercials and take your fucking money. If you have a no nonsense policy you will have far fewer footprints on your back.
netflix,384csu,TrunksTheMighty,2,Mon Jun 1 23:11:10 2015 UTC,But go ahead and be angry   Everyone has their limit. At some point when you're watching five minutes of content for every 10 minutes of ads you would start pushing back too.
netflix,384csu,2a0c40,2,Tue Jun 2 03:43:04 2015 UTC,"When I go to the cinema I turn up, like many others, 25 minutes after the advertised start time so I don't have to see trailers that I've already seen advertised on my TV at home."
netflix,384csu,DirtyOldFrank,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:35:04 2015 UTC,I never met anyone in my life that doesn't like the trailers before a movie. Trailers are the best part sometimes.
netflix,384csu,Numlocks,3,Tue Jun 2 04:38:23 2015 UTC,"I skip about 75% of the time when the option is available. Mostly because I've seen the movie already. Or it's an ad for blu-ray when I'm already watching a blu-ray. Or it's just blatantly something I'm not interested in, like the latest remaster of some Disney stuff, or a godawful rom-com chick flick, or something equally crappy.  Of the remaining 25% about half of the time they leave me thinking ""that looks like a terrible movie"". So I suppose you could argue that it at least let me know I hated it. But it's not like I'm going to watch a movie without finding out something about it, so that isn't really any help.  So that leaves a minority of cases where I see a new trailer for a movie I might like to see. Still not that helpful. That's what YouTube is for.  I'm not sure how you think I'm going to skip trailers in a movie theater. I guess I could arrive really late. But really they're just something in the background will everyone arrives, so that's kind of different anyway."

Got tired of showing up early for a seat, watching 15-20 minutes of Ad's, then another 10-15 minutes of trailers for a 90 minute movie when I could just wait and watch it on the big screen at home without that. So yeah, in a way I guess I did.  When I rent movies, any DVD that lets me skip them, I skip them. Any that let me fast forward, I fast forward."

Not everything is equal between watching at home and watching at a theater (e.g. bigger screen and sound, shared experience with audience), and also some people enjoy the movie trailers -- but if I didn't care about those aspects at all, then yeah, the ads at the beginning would be enough to make me not ever bother going to the movies."
netflix,384csu,causmeaux,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:11:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your original statement that having previews is inconsequential, it can be pretty bothersome when you are watching several consecutive episodes of a show or have a limited amount of time. The deal with Netflix that has drawn in millions of users is that it's free of ads or other interruptions while delivering a high volume of content. They're compromising their former model and risking alienation of customers.  I think your last point is very good. It's still going to be more trouble to go out of your way to download pirated shows, with risk of legal consequences or malware. That's still not an excuse for Netflix to water down its product, though."
netflix,384csu,Andrado,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:52:07 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'd love a trailer for some original content before a session and maybe once every four episodes or so on a binge. I'd love a movie trailer before a movie, but only for movies that I haven't already watched on Netflix and are currently available. Ideal would be the ability to skip after rating the movie, so even though I've seen a movie a dozen times outside of Netflix, they can pop the trailer and I can skip it by rating it.  That's all win-win for me, but if there's a third party add, I'm dropping my subscription and going to torrents full time."
netflix,384csu,CassandraVindicated,5,Mon Jun 1 21:01:33 2015 UTC,"Whether you call them ads or promotions I don't like them if they're unskippable.   I don't actually hate the idea though because I think it could be useful and some consumers may like seeing what's out every so often.   But if Netflix allowed you to skip the ad and then never showed you that ad for that particular original program again, I'd be all right with it.   But let's be honest. Netflix has some issues regarding user experience. That's why so many people prefer to use a browser add on.      So we'll see how it turns out."

Maybe those people need to ask themselves if they think the ads will really never get more intrusive. Do they also enjoy autoplaying (and hard to skip) previews on some Blu-Rays?  Do they enjoy the ads before a YouTube video?  I do believe that cable TV started out as being ad free but they couldn't turn down lots of extra money to show more and more ads.  Why Netflix, when so many are cutting the cord are you trying to be more like traditional television?"
netflix,384csu,JRPGFan,3,Mon Jun 1 23:04:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not cancelling my subscription because they're showing promos for their shows.

netflix,384csu,PK_Thundah,8,Mon Jun 1 22:21:36 2015 UTC,"I think they do. They have more invested in people watching their self-produced shows than shows they license. If they can demonstrate that their own shows have mass following, they would have a better bargaining position against the studios from whom they want to license shows. Before Netflix started producing shows, they were beholden to the studios to give them as much as the studios wanted because, without those shows, Netflix wouldn't exist.The same is less true now."
netflix,384csu,luis1972,5,Tue Jun 2 00:11:34 2015 UTC,"There was a time when Netflix had their own production arm, Red Envelope. They did a few films, notably This Film Is Not Yet Rated, before shuttering because they were alienating the very kind of enterprises they needed to court for streaming rights. Now they play ball like anybody else in competing for or commissioning series, and have them produced for Netflix by Media Rights Capital and the like, or pick up cast offs like Kimmy Schmidt and older network shows like Arrested Development."

What's more, they tend to be straightforward & show you bits of the TV show/film in question. Meanwhile I am very rarely interested in cars, perfume, insurance comparison sites & being reminded of the existence of massive chain stores I'd have to live under a rock not to know about, full of tedious 'humour', terrible jingles, & awful stock characters, which are what 99% of TV advertising seems to be.

If there is a sign soliciting said credit at the register, that is enough for the person to ask about it; similar to Netflix's current method of promoting their shows by placing them on or near your startup page.

I just called Netflix because I just saw my first ad before an episode of Breaking Bad started. It was a trailer for Netflix original content.  At this point, I never heard about ads running on Netflix, so I gave them a call. They man I spoke to repeatedly said that they didn't know what I was talking about, as they don't run any advertisements. He continued to say the same thing even when I said it wasn't an ad for say, a Ford truck, it was an ad for a Netflix original show.  He put me on hold to talk to a supervisor, then came back and repeated the same thing. However, while I was on hold, I Googled ""Ads now on Netflix"" and found this post, as well as multiple other articles talking about how Netflix is ""experimenting/testing original Netflix content trailers/ads to their users"". When I brought this up to him, he backpedaled a lot and finally admitted that yes, his supervisor DID tell him they are ""testing trailers for original Netflix content"" with certain users. I guess me using the word ""ad"" and not ""trailer for original content"" is the loop hole he was able to claim that they were not doing.  Anyway, I asked them to take me out of the test bucket that my account seemed to be apart of, because the reason I pay for Netflix monthly is to have an ad free experience, and he said no problem. He instructed me that I would just have to re-log into my account for it to take effect."

netflix,380jmo,Coliny,166,Sun May 31 23:25:14 2015 UTC,Some shows already do this. From my experience it does it when a show doesn't have any content before the theme song. It's particularly useful with anime shows that can have 2 minute theme songs.
netflix,380jmo,Elomacaug,50,Sun May 31 23:31:59 2015 UTC,Yup. Anything without a cold open gets the intro skipped when you watch multiple episodes in a row

netflix,380jmo,Cinemaphreak,2,Mon Jun 1 18:21:53 2015 UTC,Netflix could use a lot more buttons. Is it too much to ask for a + and - 30s button?
netflix,380jmo,boomhaeur,4,Tue Jun 2 03:03:47 2015 UTC,"I feel the opposite is more true - far too few shows on Netflix have intros to begin with. A recent study showed that most people even when ""binge-ing"" only do a few episodes a day. And if they are like me, might take a day or two to return, so a reminder of where we left off is helpful.   It's VERY helpful when events or characters that happened many episodes or seasons before return and you might be wondering ""who the hell is THAT guy???""  The best shows put a lot of effort into giving their audience well crafted ""Previously on...."" intros to remind them of such things."
netflix,380jmo,Corrosive23,12,Mon Jun 1 01:38:19 2015 UTC,Actually my experience is that Netflix will skip the intros if you are bingeing but if you start a new episode after a break it will show you the intro  Edit: this time with grammar!

netflix,380jmo,JakkuScavenger,2,Mon Jun 1 18:07:03 2015 UTC,"Supernatural really needs this for the ""Then"" bit (which shows a 30-90 second recap) to skip ahead to the ""Now"" bit (which does the beginning of the episode).  The actual intro that takes place after the recap and after actual start of the episode is really short (just flashes ""Supernatural"" on the screen) so it doesn't need to be skipped, but those recaps from the ""Then"" to the ""Now"" are annoying to watch and annoying to skip because the time is variable."

No reason for Netflix not to get better, especially with something like this, it doesn't hurt Netflix or the tv show to skip the intros. In fact, i'd argue it makes the tv shows more enjoyable and therefore more likely to watch more or even watch them on cable.

netflix,380ome,_Mithi_,2,Mon Jun 1 15:07:40 2015 UTC,Personally I would go the SmartDNS route such as Unblock-us. While a VPN does have other advantages it's can be more prone to limiting your connection speed than a SmartDNS especially as with many of them they require you to connect to a node in the country whose content you want to access so all your traffic is having to go via a 3rd party server that most likely thousands of miles away. If you have a decent connection speed it most likely wouldn't impact your Netflix experience but if your connection speed is on the lower end it could do

Personally, Taxi Driver has been my #1 favorite film of all time since I first saw it back in the early 90s. Even still it was listed after Silence, for no other reason than that's the order the original article had them in. I wasn't ranking these films, just pointing out a couple specifically."

netflix,37wr3e,IndyBrodaSolo,1 point,Sun May 31 01:15:50 2015 UTC,"200M is what they have put as their target, if I am not mistaken. However, it seems a bit overly optimistic to me. They need to focus more on getting more content out to as many regions as possible if they want to hit that, and focus on trying to get more insanely popular shows like OITNB and House of Cards that are likely to get people hooked onto Netflix."
netflix,37wr3e,schlacter3101,2,Sun May 31 14:55:18 2015 UTC,They have added more subscribers per quarter than they have anticipated. I think it is achievable. They are already building out their Originals library past the big shows. The thing with Netflix is that it's so cheap compared to a cable subscription so people likely subscribe to both or just Netflix
netflix,37wr3e,Skribla,0,Sun May 31 23:20:30 2015 UTC,"200M if their Expansion finishes as planned... 200M that would be amazing Netflix would have lots of money to renew cancelled shows, make new originals, buy global rights... It has been estimated that Netflix will have international 104M subscriber by then (only counting current markets)"
netflix,37wr3e,Hypetys,1 point,Sun May 31 06:14:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure 200mill is enough to do what you listed  especially the global rights. To get global rights they are going to have to pay a rate that's atleast equal to what the rights holders are likely to get from sellingt them separately and that ends up being a problem.  JUst look at Mad Men. Here in the UK its best ratings on the BBC was 355k when it was on the 'free' OTA BBC Four. Sky snatched the rights after that and paid just over £3mill a season for it. Viewer numbers contracted significantly when it moved to Sky Atlantic, some episodes getting as little as 45k watching and people with access to Sky Atlantic are more than double those with access to Netflix.  Even their deal with HBO for first run rights to all their shows and on demand rights comes in at £55million a year and the only show thats really doing decent numbers is GoT. Can Netflix really afford to pay what currently works out at around £5.5mill per show for first run rights with some archive content thrown in?  Extend that cost around the world and the cost to acquire global rights is going to be restrictive (sure some markets will have a lower going rate but many of the major ones such as Canada, Australia, Germany, France to name a few aren't going to be that much lower as they have strong media companies who will make aggressive plays for content driving the rate up.)  And even in places where the rights are cheaper you have the problem of Netflix may not be operating in countries they bought the rights in or the market for that show may not justify that countries part of the cost. Even with their Originals they don't have global rights, they pay around half the production costs of their shows in exchange for US rights plus for a set fee international rights in any country they have launched in at the time of Season 1 Episode 1 launching. If they haven't launched in a country then they lose their right to buy the rights and the production company gets them back and are free to sell them, Netflix can't get them back until the next negotiating window which seems to be every 2 seasons with Netflix shows.  For what you are suggesting they need to launch in many more countries than the 200mill would suggest and for that figure to be many times higher"

netflix,37rob0,lamentspants,3,Sat May 30 02:54:56 2015 UTC,"It's legitimately a deciding factor for me. Like all things on the internet, the only useful reviews are the reviews 3 stars or fewer. You get much more information about what's actually up with the movie/show from a 3 star review, than you do a 5 star. Even 1 star reviews are more useful as they typically highlight something about the movie that might be controversial. If that reviewer gave it 1 star for something ridiculous like homo eroticism, then I know that there's a good chance a lot of the opinions on this this movie have been tainted by prejudice for or against it. I can use that to help make an educated interpretation of the remaining reviewers.   I give less weight to the 4 and 5 star reviews because you can hire companies to leave positive reviews for your product so the signal to noise ratio has been effed up.  I've been using the trial version of the website for a few weeks now and without the reviews, I find myself not wanting to waste the time watching something I might hate."

If you put a gun to my head and made me guess - though that'd be a pretty fucking bizarre thing to go waving a gun around for - I'd say that they have some sort of metric, whether it's by page views or surveys or whatever, that determined that most of their users don't read them or don't trust them. Or that they realized that their own rating and suggestion algorithm was pointing people to more programs than the reviews ever did. Or some combination of those factors.   That's just pure speculation on my part though."

netflix,37pkq2,wievid,7,Sat May 30 08:12:28 2015 UTC,"It is a known issue, though I haven't heard of many solutions:  Picture Quality  The Wii does not provide high-definition video quality -- even for its games. As a result, the quality of the streaming videos from Netflix can suffer. Usually, most viewers don't notice a significant problem. However, if you have an HD TV and are used to seeing crisp videos, you may notice problems with picture quality, including the brightness. Despite the Wii's limitations, though, you may be able to improve the brightness and quality of the videos.  Internet Connection  One of the most common problems with Netflix streaming videos on the Wii is the user's Internet connection, according to Nintendo's customer support. When the connection is slow, the video cannot download as rapidly as necessary, which can result in a fuzzy or blurry picture. Make sure that you are using an appropriate Wi-Fi connection -- DSL, cable or fiber optic. Dial-up is too slow, and most cellular or satellite connections can provide poor quality as well.

netflix,37pkq2,Kimpyman,4,Fri May 29 21:51:05 2015 UTC,I had the exact same problem.   The Wii is broadcasting the Netflix stream at 720p but you're probably using an RCA cable (the one with the 3 colored cables). This converts it to 420p.  Solution: Buy the component cable for the Wii. It fixed the problem for me.   Although if you want crisp 1080p just get a Chromecast.

netflix,37q9gg,wredditcrew,1 point,Fri May 29 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"By ""DNS codes"", you're actually asking for the address(es) of DNS servers that give fake results, to reroute parts of your traffic via ""proxy"" servers.   Your machine asks the DNS servers ""what's the address for Netflix?"" and the DNS servers lie. Instead of saying the real address for Netflix, they give the address of a proxy server in Canada. They trick your machine into passing Netflix traffic through their proxy server, making the proxy server become a ""Man-in-the-Middle"". Netflix then don't see your address, they see a Canadian address.  Do be aware that if you use their DNS servers, they can fuck with pretty much any of your traffic from the machine. Not a huge problem for an Xbox, but if it were your PC or Laptop, they could spoof Facebook, your email account, your bank etc. Only use ones you can trust, or be VERY careful.  /u/iHeartMila has posted an option, unblock-us. The other big supplier of this sort of Man-in-the-Middle DNS-based redirect services is UnoTelly. UnoTelly do a week trial so you can see if it meets your needs. It's about $5 a month.  You can also set up your own DNS server/proxy combo, but I'm guessing as you're asking this question, that probably is not the best fit for you.  Edit: Cleaned up links.  Edit 2: If you're running it on your laptop, you don't need to use a DNS-based system unless you specifically want to. I'm a big fan of (and heavy user of) PrivateInternetAccess. It's a VPN service and it's cheap if you buy it by the year. You get all the US, UK, Canada, Australian etc. It also hides all your traffic from your ISP. You can't run it directly on the Xbox, but you can hook your Xbox up to your laptop if you want, or just run it on your laptop. It gives you up to two connections at once, so you can share one with a mate, or you can run it on your phone or whatever."

netflix,37jwdo,chadbrochill69,11,Thu May 28 09:38:45 2015 UTC,I'd suggest people to pay for a professional VPN. Stuff like Cyberghost often has some offers where you only pay ~€25 per year for access to servers all around the world. Minimizes the risks imo.
netflix,37jwdo,joosh82,6,Thu May 28 15:29:24 2015 UTC,"Depends on people's needs, but yeah, I generally recommend a good VPN.   Lots of people have been happy with Cyberghost (especially when bought when it's on a crazy offer).   PIA's cheaper ($40 USD for a 12 month) when Cyberghost isn't on offer. It has a shedload of regions and supports 2 devices at once. (They also have a SOCKS Proxy and other random stuff like a good Android client and PPTP support).   But I've updated my OP to include links to the TorrentFreak 2015 VPN list thing too."
netflix,37jwdo,chaosking121,2,Thu May 28 09:02:27 2015 UTC,"My only beef with PIA is the archaic Windows client.  The way it's packaged as a ruby application (seriously?) that unwraps itself each time you launch it makes it look like a new application to Windows every time it is executed.  I go through about 15 warning dialog boxes from my security software each time I run it, and I'm forced to give ruby itself full internet access, rather than just the application.  Once it's running, though, makes switching regions a breeze.  No complaints about the service, it's been great."

Yeah, I vaguely remember it being a ballache to use with TinyWall initially.   But you don't need to use the client if you know what you're doing, (as you clearly do if you're having this issue!)   If you want to use OpenVPN, you can just batch file that. Or if the encryption isn't an issue, just set up multiple PPTP connections to the various regions. Don't forget to generate PPTP credentials because they're not the same as your PIA username and password."

I use a DNS service (current Unblock-US but considering switching to Adfreetime) for my US Netflix fix, but I also sometimes buy PC games off Nuuvem (a South American retailer, and before anyone is tempted to complain, I live on an island just off the coast of South America (I can see the mainland on a clear day)) and I use Hola to add games to my cart. It works alright, but I would never leave it on 24/7.

No proof, that ZenMate is one of those doing it like that, but you always have the risk.  I'm using the paid VPN CyberGhost.

Netflix also keeps a data cache on the PS3, I believe it's under Games -> Game Data or something like that. Try deleting that. In case it's HDD corruption, you could delete that data, delete the app, install some other app which you don't currently have installed, then re-install Netflix.

Life is Beautiful was another one. Nowhere (a film I think is kind of awful but I hadn't seen it since I was a teenager) was the gem I couldn't find anywhere else. It's a lot of Fellini, I think Kurosawa, it's mostly older films and directors that are very respected.  It's a paid subscription site but I believe it was reasonable.

Not funny stuff not posted yet:  Turn - A fun Revolutionary War spy story. It isn't all true but they apparently try to get the time period right. The Second season is going on now and I watch it every week.  The 100 - It starts off as super cheesy and at some point you'll facepalm but it improves later in the first season and the second is pretty good. The show is by no means excellent though.  Agents of Shield - Like The 100 the beginning of the season  is not so great, it feels like a Sci-fi cop show but afterwards it picks up and the stories develop into longer arcs. I think the second season will be coming on Netflix sometime this summer.   Rescue Me- I think after the end of the second season it is it takes a shift in tone from serious to a mix of serious and goofy. I think it declined some in quality over time and I stopped watching around season 5 I think.

For every SD episode you notice, make sure you report it to Netflix so that they can replace it with a corresponding HD upgrade.  As for your second question, it depends solely on content providers.

netflix,37hb8y,ybt_sun,16,Wed May 27 17:08:49 2015 UTC,"I've not read much on Between but if I understand correctly it isn't a Netflix original in the way that House of Cards is. Like Peaky Blinders or Derek, it is a preexisting show that Netflix picked up to distribute outside its home market. So in this way they may be restricted in how they are able to roll out each episode, because it isn't a show that they acquired outright from the start."
netflix,37hb8y,Shawn_of_the_Dead,4,Wed May 27 17:28:30 2015 UTC,"No it is an original but the difference is while the likes of House of Cards are a sole commission Between is a co-commission with the Canadian channel. As such they don't have the free reign on the release statergy. Both parties have to decide between themselves a schedule that suits both.  They have the had two other commissions in this same situation so far, the first being Lilyhammer and the second Better Call Saul. With Lilyhammer they took the route of letting their partner air it first and then release at once and with Better Call Saul they took the decisions to release it an episode at a time. I expect we will see more of these co-commissions if Netflix want to hit the targets for originals that they are talking about as even with the going rate for commissioning a show being 50% of the production cost it would be very expensive to release as many shows as they are talking about on their own where as these co-commissions reduce the amount being paid and allow the budgets to be used smarter. And I suspect most if not all will get the weekly releases simply because waiting 10-13 weeks gives plenty of time for piracy to impact the shows ability to make Netflix money"
netflix,37hb8y,wakey87433,5,Wed May 27 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"It is unsually only for the US. In other countries Originals air week by week fairly  often, because some other provider airs it that way somewhere in the world, as is the case with ""Between"" as well.  As for what makes more sense simply depends on the contract. It's clear that Netflix would like to air all their show as a whole, but sometimes that simply isn't possible"
netflix,37hb8y,Abyss_85,7,Wed May 27 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry my phone spazzed out on those other replies.  The reason the show is being released weekly is because it's also airing on TV in Canada in the traditional weekly format. Netflix just airs the episodes the following day in other regions.  Netflix has done this in the past with other shows like Better Call Saul and Fargo, but they've been released in other regions outside the US, so you may not have noticed before.

I've actually gotten to where I don't care to binge really good dramas. Its just too much. Comedies on the other hand, love to binge them."
netflix,37hb8y,omahaks,-1,Fri Jun 12 15:59:36 2015 UTC,I think it makes more sense for them to stop releasing all at once. Releasing like they are now doesn't allow for a community to develop around the show. You don't get the speculation about what's going to happen next and people have to be really vague when talking about the show as to not spoil anything for those who aren't as far as them in the series.
netflix,37hb8y,Starrystars,0,Wed May 27 21:21:34 2015 UTC,"That's my thinking too. Not sure how much of a community following translates directly to more subscription and contract revenue, though."
netflix,37hb8y,IndyBrodaSolo,-1,Wed May 27 21:35:17 2015 UTC,I've never understood why they  release all episodes at once. Makes no sense. I prefer having weekly discussion and anticipation for new episode instead of one weekend of buzz and binging and year of wait.
netflix,37hb8y,IndyBrodaSolo,2,Thu May 28 12:06:13 2015 UTC,"I personally enjoy the release of everything at once. The release usually coincides with my breaks off of work/school. The year of wait is alright, especially since the originals that I watched arent too cliffhanger-y."
netflix,37hb8y,therakel749,-2,Thu May 28 18:29:23 2015 UTC,"You may like it, but I still think that it's bad strategy for Netflix. Because everyone is watching this series in different time frames, there will be less water cooler talks etc. and whole buzz will be over in one weekend. Compare that to something like Breaking Bad, GoT or Mad Men where hype gets bigger and bigger and culminating in final episode."
netflix,37kibh,Gamer_Chase,1 point,Thu May 28 08:07:05 2015 UTC,It varies. Some can be within 2 months (Agents of Shield season 2 for example) but many will be held back until attests the DVD release. Most seem to try and get it out with enough time for people to watch before the next season starts but arrow last year wasn't up until it was a few episodes into the next season.
netflix,37kibh,wakey87433,1 point,Thu May 28 12:07:18 2015 UTC,"In the US, The Good Wife is only available on Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus (they jointly purchased exclusive streaming rights in a major syndication deal a few years back). You can also watch every episode of the show on CBS All Access, CBS' recently launched paid streaming service."
netflix,37kibh,whateveresque,1 point,Thu May 28 12:52:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on how fast Netflix can get a deal done with a network. Some go on a month after airing, others take years."
netflix,37kibh,schlacter3101,1 point,Thu May 28 17:30:01 2015 UTC,"as others have said, there is no 'set time' - it's all about contracts that Netflix has with the content providers (such as CBS in the case of The Good Wife).   Unfortunately, due to these contracts, this is why Hulu Plus has many newer shows, but at the cost of the odd add in the middle of the show, while Netflix primarily has older shows (with some exceptions of course).   In many ways, it's because of the greed of the content holders with these contracts that Netflix began to produce it's own shows."
netflix,37h8mn,whateveresque,3,Wed May 27 16:51:14 2015 UTC,PRAISE CHEEBUS  I have looked everywhere for episodes from Season 3 with subtitles but nothing.  It wasn't on the Netflix june list so I flipped a table.

netflix,37h8mn,treetraffick,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:38:51 2015 UTC,Is it not there yet? Maybe there are pre-sold broadcast rights in certain countries that are preventing them from posting the show before the episodes have aired on broadcast TV.
netflix,37h8mn,treetraffick,2,Wed Jul 1 10:24:39 2015 UTC,"No, not here in Norway. I guess there are rights at stake here. Season 3 started showing on Norwegian TV2,  and I know TV2 in Denmark financed the show along with Netflix. Here's hoping, it's a great show!"

netflix,37k0e8,thunder_struck85,1 point,Thu May 28 04:37:48 2015 UTC,"The GPU you mention is only included on very low end laptops and that is likely the source of your problem.  As an easy test just open up netflix on any browser.  Then go to your account and click the ""Playback Settings"".  Select ""Medium"" and save.  Now try playing anything you like on any of your browsers.    If it is significantly smoother then it's just that the stream was playing in HD which your combo of CPU/GPU just can't keep up with.  It's highly doubtful that your screen has the resolution and size to really show a better image when streaming the HD version anyway, it's just adding a lot more processing on the GPU having to scale it down to your panel size.  If this is the case there is good news at least.  That setting that disabled HD in the browser ONLY applies to browsers, so you can leave it selected and still get HD streams through the blu-ray without changing a thing."
netflix,37k0e8,b0rgerking,1 point,Thu May 28 08:33:07 2015 UTC,"that's a great suggestion and something i totally overlooked. Will give that a try!  But if the hardware was to blame, wouldn't my CPU be running near max capacity instead of sub 35%? The GPU is integrated on the ASRock AM1-ITX motherboard with an AMD 5350 CPU. It actually came quite highly recommended for those looking to build a mini-HTPC setup on a budget. So I just trusted the reviews and got it, since i don't ever play video games. All the reviews said it was perfectly fine for 1080p video. (heres' one for example: budget htpc 1 and another budget htpc 2"
netflix,37k0e8,b0rgerking,1 point,Thu May 28 16:01:57 2015 UTC,"Full cpu usage would be a great indicator except that there is actually a lot of processing going on with the GPU as well that could be the bottleneck and isn't shown on a cpu meter.  I've helped a lot of friends with low end laptops that described their problems exactly the same way as you did and this was the issue for them.  As for the system you mention, that actually should be more than capable of playing 1080p for most anything.  Netflix does require a bit more horsepower for the same streams than other services, especially when used through a browser, so it may well be that the system is fine for local HD content or even youtube, but once you add in the extra drm that netflix uses it can't keep up."

The UK has a better selection as far as I know, including dubs that aren't in the US netflix. (Attack on Titan and Blue Exorcist).   There are your staples like FMA/FMAB and Stein;s gate which go on and off rotation every couple of months, but beyond that there isn't much there.   Netflix has a weird relationship with anime.

That information is usually somewhat safer.   The problem is that unless you are paying for premium, Hola uses your network connection as an exit node or an intermediate node, meaning that people can potentially be doing malicious activity and have it point towards you. In essence, people can potentially use your internet connection for illegal activities.   A VPN is far better in all regards as its almost completely secure and not logged."

netflix,37fqyt,schlacter3101,1 point,Wed May 27 14:38:47 2015 UTC,"First, that applies to the US, and not necessarily for other countries.

I mean the chances of something happening is very small, but it's always the possible. Hola is not secure at all, and its one of those things that you need to decide whether its worth the gamble for you or not.   Personally, I would pay the 50 dollars a year and get a good VPN. Keeps your data secure, from practically everyone out there and even stops your ISP/Uni/School from snooping on you."

netflix,37e7o4,xilpaxim,1 point,Wed May 27 03:24:36 2015 UTC,"they are only doing what the companies they are renting the movi   And this is correct answer. It all depends on how the movies / shows rights are negotiated, including audio in a foreign language and subtitles. I watch in Brazil, and it's funny that sometimes it is simple impossible to turn off the subtitles, because this is how the contents rights were negotiated. Subtitles in Spanish, by the way, are very easy to find over here. The real fun are with the original contents, with no restrictions rights whatsoever. You may be able to watch Daredevil in spanish, if you want. :)"

netflix,379lkc,SamSara43,1 point,Wed May 27 22:07:11 2015 UTC,"What I mean by CWish, is a little too much focus on love triangles (But I mean in the vintage CW girl show way... maybe not that extreme, but definitely similar style).  In the first and especially second season we have the best character development of the show, and minor characters become very fun, interesting, and 3 dimensional. Slade Wilson/deathstroke in the second season is a fun villain, and is played very well.   Well since then the big writers switched over to the Flash show, and you see the difference. The characters become more one dimensional. The female characters become whiny and helpless even as they are supposed to be turning into heroes of their own. I don't know how they are doing it, but it is really annoying, and it feels kinda demeaning.   The Flash and the Arrow have different tones, Arrow is a lot darker, especially the first season, but you can see the quality switch when the writers changed IMO.   I highly suggest getting into it if you like Superheroes and DC Universe. The first two seasons are very enjoyable. It is darker than shows like the Flash and Agents of Sheild, but it does not take itself as seriously as DareDevil. It is still a CW show, you have to keep that in mind."

I did a google search to see what episodes were skipable, and of the 10 or so episodes I skipped in the first 3 seasons, I enjoyed 7 of them. So, 3 crap episodes over three seasons is pretty decent.   Also, Departures. Best travel show I've ever seen. The cinematography is phenomenal, the show is downright interesting, beautiful, and the soundtrack is pretty cool. The hosts can get a little annoying in the first few episodes, but you end up loving them by the middle of season 1. I ended up buying the series and the sequel Descending on bluray for the extra content that is not yet on netflix."

The ending is a little meh, but that really depends on who you are, some actually called it from the get-go and were happy with the result.

For Netflix, you should check out Twin Peaks. It starts with a high school girl found naked and wrapped plastic. They start to find out more about her, like her drug habit, the men she was sleeping with, and a lot of strange things happen as they dig deeper into the murder.

Do note that it's actually a mini-series, so the it has an ending (if they make another season, it should be with a different story, different cast, etc, much like HBO's True Detective).  Awake - the basic plot is that after being in a car accident with his family, everytime a detective goes to sleep he wakes up in one of two alternate realities, in one his wife died in the accident, in the other his son died in the accident -- he doesn't know which is real. Not really messed up, but it's a cool show with different take on a crime show. It is only 1 season long though, since it got cancelled.  The Fall - not sure if it falls into you creepy category, but it is pretty good. And it stars Gillian Anderson (Scully, from the X-Files).   Happy Valley - Not really creepy, but another good british cop show.   The Bridge (US) - It has some messed up stuff, as you'd expect from a show that portrays some of the violence involving the mexican cartels."

I had been wasting a lot of money on crappy movies, just because I wanted something new to watch. Netflix is now my source for all things crappy.   The money I've saved have gone into going to the movies or buying movies that I actually like, thus reducing my pirated download rate as well."
netflix,376dwg,DVDGuy,3,Mon May 25 08:40:44 2015 UTC,"Nice! It's still cool to own a blu-ray collection though.

netflix,376dwg,bizort,3,Mon May 25 10:12:12 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, as soon as Netflix began offering unlimited streaming way back in like 2008 I stopped buying DVDs altogether.

netflix,37adg9,IHateTape,9,Tue May 26 04:00:12 2015 UTC,There was a post about it the other day. Comments explain that it's a weekly Canadian show that Netflix has rights to so they decided to air them as soon as they could. Or something like that. http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/36xc10/_/

netflix,37adg9,newnemo,3,Tue May 26 05:09:22 2015 UTC,"As Netflix diversifies it's content, it'll happen more and more in the future with different kinds of formats. The upcoming Chelsea Handler show will probably be weekly or even daily. Also,  The weekly ""thing"" is only new to US because Netflix in other countries already have weekly shows like Orphan Black in Netherlands, The 100 Canada, The Returned in UK, etc.  I think is a good thing that Netflix didn't make everybody outside Canada wait 6 weeks until they could watch their new co-comissioned show Between. It'll help with piracy too. They air the new episode 1 hour after it airs on Canadian network television."

netflix,37agqk,LivingReaper,1 point,Wed May 27 06:14:24 2015 UTC,"Hello, thanks for the response.  I tried and confirmed I can still browse Netflix through Hola in other countries. I even re-downloaded Chrome just to test this out. I managed to watch for about 5 minutes and thought ""hey, this is working great!"" and then sure enough my computer froze completely and crashed.  I have no idea why this happens, but Hola only runs smoothly in Torch Browser for me. I downloaded that browser specifically after reading it was  very light on CPU and it's worked wonderfully. But Widevine CDM does not seem to exist within Torch. I still haven't found a fix for this problem and it's driving me nuts. I might have to call up Netflix themselves, which will probably be an awkward conversation.  Also, thanks for your advice but I am well aware of the way Hola works. I decided to get it anyways due to how convenient and fast it is, and how well it works for browsing Netflix. It's been amazing for months up until this recent Widevine thing :("
netflix,37agqk,LivingReaper,1 point,Sat May 30 07:37:13 2015 UTC,"Netflix wont be able to help you, as they don't support VPN usage.  Also, if you can't get Hola to work anymore then it's not very convenient anymore. If you can try a different VPN and confirm that still works it's still worth changing your VPN so you can continue using Netflix."
netflix,37agqk,LivingReaper,1 point,Sun May 31 09:05:24 2015 UTC,"From what I've learned so far, Netflix apparently switched from the Silverlight plugin to Widevine CDM (whatever that is) awhile ago. The latter seems to be unsupported in Torch Browser, which is where my problem started.  However, the curious part is that this change supposedly happened a couple years ago, so I'm not sure why I've only just begun having problems running Netflix in Torch. Perhaps Netflix completely disabled the ability to use Silverlight, as I just check my playback settings on Netflix and there is no option to switch back to using this plugin.  A user in the other thread I posted contacted both Netflix & Torch and said Torch is aware of the problem, so that is reassuring. But for the time being it seems the only solution for me is to use another browser (which I cannot). I don't think using another VPN would make a difference, as it is the browsers themselves (FF/Chrome) that crash my computer.  Thanks for your advice in this thread. I will update in here if/when a fix is found, for any other users having the same problem."

Somewhere around episode 8 or so, i started suspecting it is what it is. I decided to give it a benefit of the doubt and keep watching.  Daredevil himself, has that superman complex, too perfect of a guy, god forbid somebody gets injured, never share your secret. To the point he gets annoying. His partner, Hoggy, is annoying as fuck. The more annoying version of Jack Black. The chick they save in the pilot, seems a but unreal too. Everybody seems to be able to move on, except for her. She claims she is scared, yet continues to go further down the rabbits hole.  The main antagonist, he seemed cool at first, yet it seems like the whole time he is playing catch up. His partners are being eliminated one by one, and he cant seem to do anything. His valet probably was the smartest guy, and taken down by a stupid accident. The picture of the super smart and calculated antagonist is fully ruined, and definitely doesnt live up to great DC villains (Ex, Joker), especially after the poisoning incident. He is a complete mess.  You can call it anti-marvel circejerk, but i gave it an honest try, and i find all of the marvel production of the same caliber, daredevil however being better than avengers."
netflix,372dnr,ceanji,2,Sun May 24 16:25:24 2015 UTC,I love the fact that Foggy asked Matt if he was actually blind. That entire scene made sense. Other than that I can see your Jack Black comparison.   That valet died because he was sloppy. He left a loaded gun on the table. His ego got the best of him. So did the blonde woman.   It makes sense that as scared as she was of the trauma that happened to her she'd keep going. Because she knows it won't stop. It's not like she can run anywhere where they can't find her. She just does her best to avoid the triggers of the incident I.e. her apartment and keeps going. It's just fighting through the fear. Even if she is Pepper Potts-lite
netflix,372dnr,top_koala,2,Sun May 24 17:12:16 2015 UTC,"His partners are being eliminated one by one, and he cant seem to do anything.    I thought it was pretty clear he was taking out his partners, either by his own hand or getting them in a dangerous situation."

But in this scene: https://youtu.be/UEmjRNHKefY?t=1m12s  Can not hear the clattering of an iron pipe swung in the largest possible arc. I COULD DODGE THAT PIPE BASED ON SOUND AND MY HEARING IS TERRIBLE! Every fight was so boring to watch because whether or not he would be able to hear something was completely arbitrary. Imagine if kryptonite only weakened superman sometimes. Imagine if regular bullets could occasionally hurt superman. Better yet, imagine if superman's heat vision sometimes only made things comfortably warm, while othertimes it could melt steel. That's how fucking arbitrary daredevil's abilities are."

I also felt that the main character development was done right. All in one season, we learned how his father died and why and how he honed his skills.  I remember Patrice O'Neal saying that he loved Batman Begins because it explained so much about Batman that they didn't explain when he watched as a youth. DD put all the facts on the table and I love that."

netflix,372dnr,raysweater,1 point,Sun May 24 20:08:43 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh a knee broke!  The problem with network shows is that there is a limit. Also, they have to stretch the seasons into 20+ episodes. It kills momentum and the story. Also, too many producers telling you what the show needs, how to improve it, etc...  HBO, Netflix, and others are succeeding because the showrunners are left alone, and the shorter seasons mean there are less filler episodes and we got a tight story."
netflix,372dnr,your_mind_aches,3,Mon May 25 01:52:54 2015 UTC,Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 2 was basically two seasons. A 10 episode one and a 12 episode one. The story was absolutely tight and there were literally zero filler episodes.   And well it's your loss. Like my friend who won't listen to anything but FLAC audio files.
netflix,372dnr,raysweater,1 point,Sun May 24 17:42:26 2015 UTC,"I watch Agents of Shield. I binge watched the first half of Season 2 and watched week to week for the first 5 of 6 episodes of the second half before I gave up. It's got problems.  I'll binge watch the rest when it's released of Netflix.  It's everyone's loss. Not mine. You're happy with it, but you don't see how much better it could be."
netflix,372dnr,Randommook,2,Sun May 24 21:36:31 2015 UTC,The extra episodes serve a rather important role in Agents of Shield. Agents of Shield is a very character driven show and many of those episodes allow characters to develop at a reasonable pace without the writers having to cram in character progression into a break neck speed plot.  Even with the leisurely pace of 20something episode seasons the writers still managed to avoid putting in lots of filler episodes and almost every episode is relevant to the overall plot in some fashion.  I think there is a time and a place for the shorter 10episode seasons but I don't think that Agents of Shield would be better off with fewer episodes per season because I would rather have 20 episodes with good character development and decent plot than 10 episodes of great plot but rushed character development.
netflix,372dnr,your_mind_aches,1 point,Mon May 25 01:51:52 2015 UTC,This is exactly the problem we're having in /r/personofinterest right now. Our show is being truncated and it's likely we only have 13 episodes left. That's not enough space for the characters to breathe and for the plot to wrap up.
netflix,372dnr,Randommook,1 point,Mon May 25 02:08:47 2015 UTC,"Personally I felt like Person Of Interest just spent the last season treading water. There were some plot episodes but for the most part they are still in almost the same situation they were in when the season started. I feel like Person Of Interest would be in a better situation if they had spent less time on plots like ""The Brotherhood"" which didn't really seem to be building up to anything significant and more time on moving the Samaritan plot forward.  This whole season of Person Of Interest seemed like they were spending all their time setting things up for the next season without actually resolving much of anything in this season."
netflix,372dnr,your_mind_aches,1 point,Mon May 25 06:24:26 2015 UTC,"Nah. It was SPOILER - Hover to View that caused that. I think the first half of the season and the last few episodes of the season was the plan. So they had to speed things up and thus was left with a gap they had to fill. And that's what they did. Filler. Thankfully, it's very enjoyable filler.   I do enjoy The Brotherhood plot though. I wish they'd done a 4-part finale like they did in Season 3 (essentially). They could have gotten Elias and Dominic's number in the first episode, resolve that storyline with Reese and Fusco. Have Reese leave to help the rest and Fusco has to deal with them. That would have been so much better. It could still end the exact same way except there could be a few hours or a day between the crash and The Correction."

Dialog isn't great. The actors aren't bad, but it's hard to tell with some of the silly dialog.  It's not your normal super hero story. It's more of a semi normal guy who is fed up with the corruption in his town.

A few plot devices were used that seemed, to me, obviously tossed into the show for ""good drama."" Despite having an hour each episode, and 13 episodes, there were many times when I felt like the show wasn't covering enough material (House of Cards does particularly well in this regard).  Daredevil reminded me a lot of Gotham. Gotham is constrained by its early prime time slot, and we miss out on a lot of the grit. There are things you simply can't get away with at 8PM on network television. Understood. Daredevil was free of these constraints, but the creators missed the opportunity. Some extra violence hardly passes ""for mature audiences only.""  How does Daredevil remind me of Gotham? I wasn't sure if I enjoyed the program because it was good TV, or because it was a comic book adaptation (which I'm a sucker for).  Bloodline, on the other hand, was incredible. To each their own."

He was absolutely haunted by his past and he had a grand total of one friend - Wesley - and to say he was not uncomfortable relating to other human beings is a bit ridiculous. He definitely came across as an impostor in the art gallery and restaurant scenes and never appeared to be at ease even in his own home."

He's haunted by precisely one event from his past, only having one friend is a by-product of his work--which he loves dearly-- not his status as an impostor.  Like I said above, there's no textual evidence, in the show or otherwise, that Fisk is uncomfortable or feels like an impostor. The voice is purely for effect, and it has a shit effect for plenty of people. Like it if you like, but don't pretend it serves some deeper purpose because that whole show is shallow."

DD is a peak human (and then some) buy he is also fighting waves of attackers. He gets tired. He gets hurt. Sometimes very badly.   I had a couple minor quibbles, both related to the numerous fight scenes. DD diverse fighting uses a lot of full body kicks, either by cartwheeling or using a wall to jump and spin from. Such kicks would literally have the full inertia of his body weight behind them, yet they rarely even stagger his foes, who are mostly street-level guys, normal humans without advanced fight training. Experienced fighters get KO'ed by blows with far less energy.  Secondly, DD underwent intensive martial arts training with Stick, and such training would need to be ongoing. Throughout the entire 1st season, we see a single scene of him punching a heavy bag. I realize story takes precedence over Rocky-style montages of DD pumping iron and doing stairs, but  comes off as the only master martial artist/gymnast/traceur who doesn't need to train."

netflix,371dj5,lodolfo,1 point,Sun May 24 03:59:28 2015 UTC,Have you used it recently? It was pretty terrible when they first updated to 2.0 a couple of months ago but recently they've fleshed it out and I feel it's equal or better than the original.
netflix,371dj5,slayeralucard,1 point,Tue May 26 01:26:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I use it several times a week (I used to use it several times a day). I find that the most obvious bugs are still there, like for example, if you rate a show and later change your mind, you can't do it from an episode list, you have to go into the episode's page if you want to change a rating. I also have given up on trying to add comments."
netflix,371dj5,lodolfo,1 point,Tue May 26 01:59:46 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I guess rating and comments isn't really something I do much. I mainly use it to keep track of what I've watched and to find new things to watch.
netflix,3748ek,shockboomJJ,1 point,Sun May 24 18:58:09 2015 UTC,If you're somewhere in Latin America (sorry I don't recognize the place I'm European) then it's just because like none content has english subs available in Latin America because those retarded studios want more money for offering them which is quite ridiculous as Netflix could easily make ones itself or some Netflux user as well bc no need to translate just write what you hear

The show is airing in a normal once-a-week pattern on a normal TV channel in Canada, and Netflix is getting them at the same time, and conducting an experiment to show them immediately when they get them, instead of waiting and releasing all the episodes at once later, as they do with their British co-productions like The Fall and Peaky Blinders. If the British channels are okay with it, Netflix might try it with those too in the future, but we definitely will NOT see that with true Netflix originals like the Marvel/Defenders shows, Grace & Frankie, Kimmy Schmidt, or Bloodline, since those are American shows, not foreign shows, and Netflix is the primary conduit, not a co-producer."

netflix,3715xt,whatevers_clever,4,Sun May 24 04:54:18 2015 UTC,Advertising more of their shows while you're watching one of their shows and allowing you to instantly skip it  Yeah wtf netflix  Their shows being Netflix originals
netflix,3715xt,Baconaise,0,Sun May 24 06:07:39 2015 UTC,"Look at it from a marketing perspective and you might understand better. They have shows they know more people will watch if they just see the trailer, but for some reason people aren't interested in watching it until they've seen the trailer. They don't and probably won't advertise these shows on real TV commercials (though they have had a commercial for a few of their shows) and they let you skip the commercial if you do see it, no forced/captive audience.  I think it's OK, but I would prefer if they just showed me a list in my netflix for ""new netflix originals"" so I could keep up with all of their shows and watch trailers there."

Obviously I should have read the book first, or watched the original 1979 BBC miniseries. For that matter, since the miniseries already existed, I don't see the point of this movie. Two hours is clearly not enough time to tell a story this complex and intricate. The movie seemed like a huge waste of some great talents, too. Toby Jones is just there briefly as a red herring. I'm sure that character probably got a lot more exploration in the book and miniseries, and here he's just... some guy. I'm sorry but Toby Jones should never just be some guy. What a waste."

netflix,36xc10,mike413,-56,Sat May 23 20:23:14 2015 UTC,That does not matter. The model that Netflix uses is whole seasons at once. If Netflix cannot do that due to the show currently airing then they should not stream it at all and wait till they can release it in the standard model. This is not wanted.

netflix,36xc10,duckies_wild,3,Sat May 23 04:01:44 2015 UTC,Hype train would have been at 110% after that episode if we had a week to mull it over and rewatch it repeatedly and make GIFs and stuff.
netflix,36xc10,miggitymikeb,3,Sat May 23 04:10:05 2015 UTC,And someone would have made a mash up of him beating up drunk don draper or Jesse pinkman. Someone else would have written silly things on screen grabs and posted on tumblr then I'd see the link on reddit.  We'd have an actual clue how not to spoil. Ahhhhhh...never thought I'd wish for the days of traditional TV models.
netflix,36xc10,duckies_wild,3,Sat May 23 04:16:50 2015 UTC,I've noticed that as well with other shows like House of Cards. The buzz is always so short lived that makes the show more forgettable compared to other shows like Game of Thrones.
netflix,36xc10,swanny246,4,Sat May 23 12:44:32 2015 UTC,"I'd rather get 1 a week for 15 weeks than wait 15 weeks to get them all at once. On top of that, the binge content comes out significantly later than the last air date for a season. Usually it comes out right before a new season starts. A staggered release of current content is a huge addition to the service. Now if they start doing this with everything that's another story. So long as this is a model exclusive to currently airing content I'd say it's a huge home run for Netflix. It's one more reason not to pay for hulu."

netflix,36xc10,iSmite,1 point,Sat May 23 03:39:44 2015 UTC,"But you are being unreasonable here..It normally takes a year before they can upload a whole season at once.

netflix,36xc10,WarlordFred,54,Sat May 23 20:32:24 2015 UTC,This is a good thing... It's the same that they did in the UK with breaking bad. They do this when they buy the rights to a show being made in a different country. It isn't a Netflix created show.
netflix,36xc10,randdomusername,15,Sat May 23 01:02:30 2015 UTC,They did it with better call saul as well. It's fine with me.
netflix,36xc10,mattcoady,-1,Sat May 23 03:38:26 2015 UTC,Not in the US
netflix,36xc10,Cinemaphreak,142,Sat May 23 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"I don't recall Netflix signing anything saying they have to release entire seasons at once. It's nice they do, but not required. I'm sure they would if they could, but this is a Co production with Canada"
netflix,36xc10,minnick27,27,Fri May 22 22:36:15 2015 UTC,That is correct if Marvel told Netflix to air a new Daredevil episode each every week they could.
netflix,36xc10,HeroxGxDeal,35,Fri May 22 23:07:39 2015 UTC,Actually no Marvel couldn't tell them that. The producer doesn't have a say on the release schedule unless it's a provision in the contract. The commissioning outlet are the ones who decide that so As long as Netflix want to release all at once Marvel can't stop them.  The reason shows like this end up being weekly when Netflix is a commissioning party in it is they aren't the sole commissioner so the two parties have to decide a release schedule that both are happy with.
netflix,36xc10,wakey87433,12,Fri May 22 23:26:15 2015 UTC,"Of course it would have to be a provision in a contract, I kind of assumed thats what Herox meant.   If marvel wanted daredevil to air weekly, they would have included that in the contract/deal and netflix would have abliged.   I don't think anyone would assume that marvel would make that kind of demand post contract."
netflix,36xc10,orphenshadow,0,Sat May 23 00:22:45 2015 UTC,"My point was more they would have had to have demanded a clause that production companies never include for the commissioning outlet.  In normal TV the network that commissions it usually pays around 50% of the production budget for a new show. Without that it doesn't get made because the international rights and secondary market rights won't generate enough to cover the production companies costs let alone make a profit so they aren't in a position to really dictate when a show airs. It's why you see some commissioned and filmed shows either burnt off during the summer or never even aired.  With netflix it's a little different as their originals include some international rights (automatically in any country they have launched in) but one region is the commissioner of the content, usually the U.S. but some of the other regions have their own shows coming. That region pays the normal commissioning outlets licence fee. Any country Netflix is in when the show launches then pays an agreed upon additional international rights fee and the production company keep the rest. Again they aren't going to dictate to Netflix when to air it because if they do the show is dead and the profit that the production company can make from international and secondary market sales doesn't exists without Netflix picking up half the initial tab.  With a case like Between, Lillyhammer and Better call Saul the schedule agreement is made between the co-commissioning outlets outside the agreement they cosign with the production company. Netflix airing them weekly as in BCS and Between cases or a as a whole after the other party has aired it locally is the comprismise deal that Netflix has agreed with its partner not the production company."
netflix,36xc10,wakey87433,23,Sat May 23 11:00:54 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected, and thanks for information."
netflix,36xc10,HeroxGxDeal,15,Fri May 22 23:28:30 2015 UTC,"I don't wish for world peace per se, I just think if everyone learned this phrase and wasn't afraid to use it, peace would just happen."
netflix,36xc10,lolagranolacan,8,Sat May 23 00:51:28 2015 UTC,unless it's a provision in the contract   that's sorta what it would mean for Marvel to tell netflix to air a new daredevil weekly...

netflix,36xc10,iSmite,1 point,Sat May 23 03:40:36 2015 UTC,Disney has enough pull that they could make it weekly if they wanted to.
netflix,36xc10,wOlfLisK,0,Sat May 23 13:51:13 2015 UTC,"They don't have much pull though, not unless they either don't want the show to be commissioned at all or they want ABC Studios to have to fund it fully themselves and most likely then not make the money back."
netflix,36xc10,wakey87433,3,Sat May 23 14:00:04 2015 UTC,"Just to be technical about it, it's a co-commission. Netflix don't produce their own shows right now (HBO is one of the few outlets that do tbh) most just commission shows from other producers."
netflix,36xc10,wakey87433,6,Fri May 22 23:23:09 2015 UTC,Netflix has a growing list of shows that they produce.
netflix,36xc10,cdb03b,4,Sat May 23 01:42:04 2015 UTC,"But that isn't true at all. House of Cards, Bloodlines, Orange is the New Black, and Daredevil are all Netflix produced..."
netflix,36xc10,CoPSwords,12,Sat May 23 01:26:16 2015 UTC,"No they are not they are the distributor on all of those.  House of Cards is produced by Trigger Street; Bloodlines is KZK; Orange is Lion's Gate; and Daredevil is Goddard, Marvel and ABC."
netflix,36xc10,Furiou5,2,Sat May 23 01:53:23 2015 UTC,"Huh, looks like you are right. Sorry about that /u/wakey87433. I am wrong. Kind of blows my mind though, thought Netflix actually produced all those shows..."
netflix,36xc10,CoPSwords,3,Sat May 23 21:50:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly Production Companies is really 'Inside Baseball' stuff.  Most people don't know who actually produces the media they watch.  See Two and a Half Men and Big Bang Theory; both produced by the same company CLP yet have such different audiences that they were considered rival shows(honestly this goes for production of anything: see Dove and Axe body products).    As an owner of a small production company, most of us kinda like it that way. I'd much rather you watch my work and never know it is me.  Fame is for the birds; let someone else have a hard time going to the store without getting bothered."
netflix,36xc10,Furiou5,-1,Sat May 23 22:00:15 2015 UTC,You're looking at the UK version of House of Cards btw. Media Rights Capital produces the Netflix version.
netflix,36xc10,psu5020,4,Sat May 23 02:24:28 2015 UTC,No I am not Trigger Street is Kevin Spacey's company.  They do the lion's share of the production.
netflix,36xc10,Furiou5,5,Sat May 23 03:05:15 2015 UTC,"My bad, I read the wrong entry."
netflix,36xc10,psu5020,2,Sat May 23 03:22:18 2015 UTC,"so what role exactly netflix plays in global release of netflix shows like HoC, OITNB, Bloodline, Kimmy Schimdt etc? It has the sole rights to distribute?"
netflix,36xc10,iSmite,3,Sat May 23 03:43:13 2015 UTC,"Not even that. The production company still holds the distribution rights but Netflix get the first run rights and ongoing streaming rights in any country they have launched in at the time of the show starting. In any other country the producers can sell the first run rights and the subsequent streaming rights to anyone they wish as we have seen where a number of countries that Netflix has launched in do so without some of the Netflix originals that they commissioned. I've seen conflicting reports when it comes to Netflix getting the rights back in countries they later launch in, some say that Netflix have the option to take them back automatically for a set fee when the deals run out with the other outlet (They generally seem to be sold in none Netflix regions on a two season basis) while others things I've read say Netflix have to bid for them just like any one else who wants to snatch them from the original broadcaster in that country"
netflix,36xc10,wakey87433,-17,Sat May 23 10:36:09 2015 UTC,"That is the model they established, it is the model we purchased. Them changing that model is not giving us what we purchase. It being co-produced in Canada does not matter, if they cannot release it all at once they should wait till they can like all their other shows."
netflix,36xc10,cdb03b,1 point,Sat May 23 01:40:51 2015 UTC,They are doing it this way because they don't want to wait to give it to us. Im sorry that Netflix is trying to be nice to us and you don't like it
netflix,36xc10,minnick27,1 point,Sat May 23 10:14:39 2015 UTC,If they waited however then piracy would be an issue for Netflix meaning they would be willing to put up less of initial budget (or may drop out completely and just go after the cheaper second window streaming rights). Then you either put the show at risk of happening or the production companies may be able to get more selling the second window rights to companies on a country by county basis.
netflix,36xc10,wakey87433,18,Sat May 23 10:39:54 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with binge watching, like some. It's nice to be able to watch one episode every other night or so, like I did with the first season of House of Cards, but being forced to spread it out to one show a week is fine. Gives me something to look forward to."
netflix,36xc10,spriggig,4,Sat May 23 00:24:53 2015 UTC,there will always be pros and cons. Getting all shows at once is no exception. :/
netflix,36xc10,iSmite,8,Sat May 23 03:44:18 2015 UTC,"As others have said this is an actual show, not a Netflix show.  With that said, I'm one of those crazy people who prefers the once a week method.  It gives you something to look forward to, but most importantly it facilitates conversation with your friends and online.  When House of Cards comes out you can't really talk about it with your friends until everybody is done with the whole thing.  At that point you just have a conversation about the season as a whole and then it's done.  Compare that to Game of Thrones where I'll talk about it with my friends every single week for months.  The GoT subreddit has tons of content every week for every episode.  You don't get that when every episode is released at once."
netflix,36xc10,noelsusman,3,Sat May 23 05:06:45 2015 UTC,"This is my issue with the Netflix model as well. Everyone was watching daredevil, but at different times, so nobody could share the experience unless they've watched the whole season. Game of thrones is as much of a community event as it is because everyone is talking and guessing what will happen next week. Maybe they could release episodes a couple at a time, or one every few days. Doesn't have to be one a week."
netflix,36xc10,cantwejustplaynice,2,Sat May 23 14:02:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I like the model Yahoo has been using with Community.  I haven't checked back in a while but if I remember right they're releasing two episodes a week.  I think that's perfect since pretty much everyone can find time to watch a couple episodes within a day or two.
netflix,36xc10,noelsusman,7,Sat May 23 14:38:08 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with this. I watched 'under the dome' on prime. Each episode debuted on prime one week after it was on tv.   I don't have to pay for cable or a dvr, and I watch what I want faster than the normal one year wait. I would be ok if more shows were available this way."
netflix,36xc10,daonemanshow,15,Sat May 23 00:53:04 2015 UTC,"Don't think of it as you're getting the other episodes late, but that you're getting this particular episode(s) early."
netflix,36xc10,BraveSquirrel,3,Fri May 22 22:25:20 2015 UTC,"You're in fact complaining about getting a show as quickly as you can! For example, in the Netherlands we got Better Call Saul as it aired in the US. Should I be complaining I didn't get to watch the whole season before it even aired on AMC? That's what you're doing. The show hasn't aired fully; it's entirely possible they're still working on the episodes."
netflix,36xc10,tlvrtm,3,Sat May 23 09:56:18 2015 UTC,"i think its a great idea personally. builds suspense and interest in the show, and allows them to modify plotlines in the middle of the season if they're badly missing the mark"

netflix,36xc10,streamingcanada,7,Sun May 24 14:14:52 2015 UTC,"I realize this is a special situation because it is a Canadian show we are getting early. But even if they did this with some of their own productions I would be down with it.   Daredevil was an amazing show, but it has no community around it that talks about each episode and makes predictions about next week etc.  Shows like Arrow, Flash, and Agents of Shield have great fan communities around them. Daredevil was better than all those shows but it suffers from not having fans watch along together at the same time and discuss it.   Some shows, like Daredevil, would probably benefit from a timed release schedule."
netflix,36xc10,miggitymikeb,2,Sat May 23 01:50:16 2015 UTC,I would be more upset about it if the show was good.

netflix,36xc10,Nova277,3,Fri May 22 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"The reason for that was as an extension of the Breaking Bad second half of the final season thing. Essentially, everybody knew that people outside of the US would pirate the episodes immediately, since nobody would wait for it to get to them through legal channels, so Netflix got permission to air them almost simultaneously to at least capture some revenue and official viewership numbers."
netflix,36xc10,cakedestroyer,1 point,Sat May 23 01:11:44 2015 UTC,"So after reading through this It is not a Netflix production but is currently being broadcast on Canadian tv. Right?

netflix,36xc10,HalfADozenOfAnother,5,Fri May 22 23:47:15 2015 UTC,I thought the first episode was pretty decent. But a lot of other people disagree.
netflix,36xc10,littlebitojesus,0,Sat May 23 00:25:08 2015 UTC,It's one of those shows where the primary plot device is designed to make sure almost all characters are attractive teenagers. What do you think?  It's probably ok'ish if you're in the target audience or get off on high school drama but insufferable if you're looking for good sci fi.

netflix,36xc10,Juswise,1 point,Sat May 23 10:44:51 2015 UTC,Netflix could postpone until all the original episodes air then post them all at once but that would be silly.  Frankly I hope Netflix starts releasing their content in smaller chunks.  I'm too much of a binge watcher to savor shows like Daredevil or House of cards.  Doing this would also keep the shows in the conversation longer (ie free publicity) as Netflix seasons only gets one mention on media sites while shows like Mad Men or Walking dead get a mentions during their entire run.
netflix,36xc10,jebei,1 point,Sat May 23 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"There are pros and cons to making all episodes available at once. As with all things in life, it works better with some things than others.   HBO and AMC made Sunday nights ""appointment viewing"" to watch their best shows and frankly I wouldn't want it any other way with ones like Game of Thrones, Mad Men, etc. etc. Not only do you get a week to digest the latest episode, but you can discuss it and conjecture about what's coming next. The best shows prove themselves by going in directions you didn't think of.   Ironically, because Game of Thrones and Mad Men conflicted, we would skip weeks and watch 2 episodes of each on alternating Sundays. It was the best of both worlds: more than a single episode but not too much that you can't savor all the developments."
netflix,36xc10,Cinemaphreak,1 point,Sat May 23 18:40:40 2015 UTC,"The 100 was the same way, for season 1 at least - I lost interest part way into that season. A new episode would air on the CW, then be added to Netflix, or at least Netflix Canada."
netflix,36xc10,RambleMan,2,Sat May 23 01:12:28 2015 UTC,Yeah Netflix has a deal with some show where they put them up the day after they are on TV. What made you lose interest in it?
netflix,36xc10,Starrystars,0,Sat May 23 04:09:28 2015 UTC,The story and acting.
netflix,36xc10,RambleMan,2,Sat May 23 13:39:35 2015 UTC,"I lost interest too, then went back and jumped back into it after all of season 1 was posted, and binge-watched the rest of the season. It gets excellent after about episode 4 or 5 and stays really compelling after that. The teens get a lot less annoying, too. Good show.  Here in the U.S., Netflix doesn't do that, or hasn't until Between, as far as I know. It's a piracy-fighting technique to release each episode for streaming in other countries right around the time it airs in the U.S. But it's not as common for foreign shows to get pirated here in the U.S. since most of us haven't heard of them yet (until Netflix promotes them to us, that is).  Anyway, for a show like The 100, binge-watching really benefits it because it doesn't get good until a few episodes in. Normally I don't mind watching most shows traditionally, once episode a week, but shows that are just starting out with rocky pilot episodes and haven't figured themselves out yet often really benefit from having an entire season released at once."

netflix,36yvar,Hypetys,1 point,Mon May 25 06:21:11 2015 UTC,"Regarding documentaries vs movies vs series...

This is coming in a future version but I have to rework how i pull and store the genre details so not a simple fix.  Regarding the flags/country details on the title screen, I am working on some ideas for how this lays out in the next version but I haven't made any decisions yet.  Regarding seasons on ""what's new on netflix"" several people have asked for this and I am looking at how best to do it. Keep in mind that ""what's new"" is supposed to be for new to all of netflix and not a particular country or region.  So when I do get new seasons here, it will be when a new season comes to netflix as a whole.

There was no weight or gravity to anything,  especially the fact that half the cast had just lost mothers and fathers and other family--that text messaging scene was cringeworthy.

I really wanted this to be a fun show from the description,  but it was like Under the Dome all over again."

netflix,370fny,mike413,0,Sat May 23 18:46:42 2015 UTC,I watched every episode. It can be brought back to the full potential with major plot twists and more action
netflix,370fny,ike1,1 point,Sat May 23 20:05:07 2015 UTC,I disagree. The show lost its way by season 4.  Netflix won't bring this back -- it no longer has any buzz. Most of its fans have long since drifted away and moved on to other things.  (Also this show had a lot of charming elements but it also had possibly the worst case of Paper-Thin Bad Guy Syndrome I've ever seen. The villains had NO point and NO motivation. They couldn't have been less interesting if they were twirling mustaches and tying girls to railroad tracks. To call the villains cardboard cut-outs would be an insult to cardboard cut-outs.)

We know the companies can add new seasons the second they finish airing, so why wait until October to release the new season of It's Always Sunny when you could drum up buzz by releasing it in the summer when people are available?

netflix,36thyp,logicalnoise,2,Fri May 22 20:30:53 2015 UTC,Ok so I've been on the fence about watching this show. I often find that shows with superheroes come off a little vanilla when it comes to the atmosphere of the program itself. I prefer gritty television like walking dead and southland while it was on. Would this be a show that I might like?
netflix,36thyp,Hitech_hillbilly,2,Fri May 22 08:44:29 2015 UTC,In season 1 it's very much a show about one team by them selves taking on some powered individuals. About 4 episodes before the finale(the episode that ties into captain America 2) The show switches into high gear. The high gear sticks to non powered people dealing with spy thriller stuff. Season 2 keeps that going but starts introducing more powered people since they're becoming a major force in the marvel universe. The show is always about the main characters. I'd recommend it to anyone.
netflix,36thyp,logicalnoise,4,Fri May 22 11:08:42 2015 UTC,"I still recommend watching the entire season one. Sure some episodes aren't that great, but they do set up the relationships and identity of the team really well, and that pays off in season two in so many ways."

But there seems to be no CDC, and the military's allowed to operate domestically. No mention of it being the National Guard, or a governor or president ordering it.  There's a ""Ministry"" in charge of something, a Minister doing an announcement, but... there's a Department of Public Health instead?  Perhaps it's a local government unit, one thinks, maybe for some reason there isn't a federal government agency taking point and they've let the ""Lake District Department of Public Health"" in charge. Perhaps, a district is like a county level government unit. But then, the medical center is in the Central District.   This small town with 8000 people has several districts, and one district has its own department of public health?   Where is this thing set? I don't get it. Canada's ministers doesn't run Ministries of anything, they run agencies or departments. Is the government somehow more British?   I can only conclude that this is set in a world where the United States didn't gain independence, Napoleon didn't lose Louisiana and the British Empire and France are still major powers in North America, and the reason it just labels itself ""Pretty Lake"" with no province or state acronym is because it's using something like the current UK address format where they just have post towns.  Like Norwich doesn't get listed as ""Norwich, England"" like ""New York, NY"" or ""Ontario, BC"" might.  And what is with that kid that got into MIT thinking he can escape using bolt cutters and running directly at a fence?"
netflix,36vupp,Klompy,1 point,Sun May 24 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"So, the kid got into MIT. They seem American, somewhere in New England maybe. But there seems to be no CDC, and the military's allowed to operate domestically. No mention of it being the National Guard, or a governor or president ordering it.   Where did you get this impression that it wasn't the National Guard? I agree it's absurd that there's no CDC involved at this point though, my guess is that they bring them in during a future episode and didn't want to blow their wad the first episode."
netflix,36vupp,royaldansk,2,Mon May 25 01:01:39 2015 UTC,"They're just being so vague about their setting that it's conspicuous.  ""The Ministry"" is clearly not meant to be some church in charge of things, but it seems to be in charge of the investigation into it like the CDC might be.  When ""Minister Miller"" did her message, she mentioned experts from around the world, and usually writers on TV shows like to namedrop specifics like they did when they used ""MIT"" to indicate how smart that one kid is.   They just say ""our military"" when US government officials will tend to be very specific about which branch of the military it is that's been deployed, especially when it's on domestic soil. They're very sensitive about that sort of thing. But I guess the US military can be deployed to do this for public health reasons, so it probably doesn't have to be the National Guard.  Especially since if it's in the US, the Governor of the state it's in seems to have decided to pass the buck, letting some Minister be the face of the whole thing.   But again, Department of Public Health? So it is being handled at the state level?   But if there's a President, why wasn't he or she at all mentioned in the news bits? The absence of any mention of any state or provincial or federal officials was just conspicuous to me.  All I'm saying is, their attempts to be vague about where it's set has made it seem like it's set in a whole other version of North America, where there's government officials called Ministers, which are part of The Ministry, who seem to run cabinet level Departments and armed forces, and governors, secretaries, premiers, presidents, and prime ministers are just oddly missing."
netflix,36vupp,Klompy,1 point,Mon May 25 03:39:31 2015 UTC,"I'm only giving the show another episode to improve, but I hope you're wrong just because that would all be so terrible.  Edit: I also just went back and looked, you're right they left the military deliberately out of uniform."
netflix,36vupp,royaldansk,2,Mon May 25 04:18:22 2015 UTC,"They also deliberately have nothing that indicates where they are. Not on any logos, or city seals, or computer records.  All they have in the ""Lake District Department of Public Health"" server for ""Place of Birth"" is ""Pretty Lake.""  No State, no Province, nothing. No country, even. Exactly like how the British seem to do it, what with Harry Potter living in just ""Surrey"" and ""Edinburgh"" just being Edinburgh or Cardiff just being Cardiff. Like you're just meant to understand what countries those are in.    The only indication that they're on Earth is that they mention MIT. And I don't think they even say it's Massachusetts. TV writers often can't help themselves from having the dialogue include the guy's SAT scores and GPA when they're trying to establish that ""this guy is smart"" and yet they resisted. Those would have indicated they were in the US, wouldn't they?  It's just so weird that they've completely gone the opposite direction of making the setting seem like it's in this world. I get that maybe they're trying not to lock down a location because maybe there's a Canadian somewhere who will mind that it's not set in Canada, but who's ever minded that a show about a small North American town is set in the United States?   They don't have any brands, I don't think their text graphics indicate what company or OS the phone is using, they don't have any indicators of geography, their government system is all mixed up.  It's making me expect that that's going to be some twist in the end.  That it's not set on Earth after all. Or it's set in a world where the founding fathers lost, or the War of 1812 led to a different outcome.  Or maybe it's set in a world where everything is led by a church called the Ministry.  They just need to get over whatever it is that's keeping them from locking it into a specific country because it's making the writers not know what sort of government structure to use, which agencies and officials to write in, and what terms to use. Even Springfield isn't so vaguely located."
netflix,36vupp,sirshartsalot,2,Mon May 25 07:05:32 2015 UTC,"I'm falling asleep watching it. The plot is obvious, the characters are shallow, the show is overall boring.   I get that it's the first episode, but does every dialogue have to be expository? Someone needs to read some Stephen King, to learn how to write characters."
netflix,36vupp,aoifesuz,2,Sun May 24 00:20:54 2015 UTC,"The dialogue is laughable. It's totally transparent and totally unnatural. I think releasing it one episode at a time will kill it. I'm not particularly gone on it and I'm not sure I'll watch the next episode. In contrast, I wasn't gone on the pilot of Hemlock Grove and binged a few episodes as the quality picked up a bit. Unless the quality dramatically improves, I probably won't be watching it next week."
netflix,36vupp,Klompy,2,Sun May 24 21:29:55 2015 UTC,"I too was hoping for a better under the dome, but they had to throw in the exact same character that Dean Norris Plays in Under the Dome and I just can't stand it.  It's a lawless quarantined society, and in the very first episode this rich prick who earlier threatened them after his kid hits their car pulls a shotgun on them and intends to tar and feather them.  You're not going to live very long in that society behaving like that, as there's enough people like me who would just straight up turn around with the tar still on me after I grabed a rifle and killed him, but I'm sure just like Deans character in Under the Dome, this asshole will continue to survive, and nobody will have the balls to just do what's right and put a bullet in them on ~day 2."
netflix,36vupp,Shai23,2,Mon May 25 00:50:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't watch it because they are time-releasing the season? WTF Netflix? The big advantage of Netflix is that we can watch a whole season. If you are going to start doing this like normal television, I don't want to even hear about shows until their season is over.  Also, I read the show's premise: teenagers having to survive after a plague starts taking out adults and then the show's promo has a cast that seem like either adults or young adults in their 20s. Maybe they have kids as extras and the young adults are supposed to be teens? It's really weird when casting directors cast 23-26 y/os as ""teenagers"". . .  have you seen a 13-15 y/o boy? They are like little boys with long arms and legs. Not that there aren't some 18-20 y/o boys who don't still look like that, but they don't cast 18 y/o Michael Cera types. Instead it's some hot 25-ish guy the casting director slept with after a shared improv class who looks like a boyishly handsome 25 y/o."
netflix,36vupp,acrolos,2,Sat May 23 00:43:41 2015 UTC,This is a special case because it's a co-production with a Canadian company.  There are a number of American shows that are released weekly in other countries.   I'm kind of with you though.  I'd rather them just wait until the season was over and release it at once.
netflix,36vupp,Shai23,1 point,Sat May 23 01:04:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the shows released weekly in other countries aren't Netflix Originals.

Is there a Canadian television station that is getting this show at the same time as Netflix?   Btw, even though I'm disagreeing, I'm totally up-voting because your post was informative and I think people will want to read it."
netflix,36vupp,acrolos,2,Sat May 23 01:32:56 2015 UTC,"Yes,  there is a Canadian network that airs it an hour before it shows up on Netflix.  Not sure which one though.   I wouldn't mind this approach if it allows some more obscure (to America audiences at least) shows to show here as they air."

Grace & frankie has European Portuguese subs & italian etc (Portugal prefers subs Brazil Dubs thats why no dubbings are being made for european portuguese) So it is very likely that in addition to Japanese they'll launch in Portugal, Spain, Italy & Poland I estimate Czech Republic, Slovakia & Slovenia, Hungary & maybe even Greece are also coming soon... If you have noticed not all of these have both subs & dubs available in these new languages that's because they're making subtitles for lots of titles before launch & have not yet made onces for these specific titles"

Greece could be expansion country as well... If the European Union's Digital Single Market goes therough it'd be very wise for netflix to expand to all 28 member states (currently 9/28) & if they expand to Iceland as well (country with only 350K population which prefers subtitles) for the iceland they could easily add iceland rights Nordics rights (Fi, No, Se & Dk) so it would be 5 countries instead of 4 & cost of rights would probably remain the same or be just abt 5% or something more expensive   Netflix Plans to buy European wide rights even if the Digital Single Market fails, currently this is not true just some content is been bought Europe Wide (these so called originals; not all of them are European wide some just DACH & Benelux & France) & oprhan black for example is only Nordics & Netherlands  So if the Digital single market goes through it'd be lot easier to buy EU (28 countries) + Switzerland, Norway & Iceland rights / Global"

The best guess ratings system takes into account what you rate and what you watch, but weighs what you watch more heavily - which is how the general suggestion system that Netflix uses works. So why, exactly, is it guessing he would hate a TV show and yet also putting it into his top picks? is top picks based solely off of demographics and entirely separate from the best guess rating? The end user has no fucking idea. instead, you just see conflicting messages and are left wondering if netflix is incompetent or just fucking with you."

Can you give me more detail about some of these points?   some titles dont have my chosen subtitles they have some different one   Can you give me an example of a title which is missing the subtitles you'd expect, what exactly you do expect, and what you're seeing instead?   shows 1080 but it's not (basicully shows like 720 then 1080 like immediately even though it's either), when streaming   The PS3 will always output 1080p if that's what you've selected as the device's resolution. However we use something called adaptive streaming, where the actual resolution of the title you're streaming may start out as low as 240p (even though your TV will still report a 1080p signal), and then will eventually get to the maximum resolution your bandwidth can support. If the playback resolution is less than 1080p when you start, it can take around 15 seconds to ramp up to the best quality. Basically it's a difference of device resolution vs. video resolution.   The languages options are English even though they should be in Finnish (like English is Englanti in Finnish, not that i can't understand English but because that part is broken)   Thanks, I'll bring this up and see if it's working as intended."
netflix,36wbxd,working_at_netflix,-1,Fri May 22 18:46:47 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about what my tv displays yes it displays 1080p but the PS3 App info displays 1080 even when it's nowhere near that quality & could you please tell the engineers to add bitrate info to PS3 App like 1080 / 5800 kbps... Now they tell only resolution... 2 days ago the subtitles started to cut off the last word on lines on almost every dialog but not all i tested on many titles they all have the problem... Also please fix the continue watching HIDE the stuff ive seen like movies etc & please list like 3 if not more recent titles in order on that list so i can quickly continue with them & KEEP continue watching always at top & my list as 2nd... & Please playlist feature it's so hard to watch 20 tv shows so option to add episodes to playlist I could also draw my graphical UI Ideas for you if you'd want to & you could pass them: if you really work at netflix

netflix,36qhrn,caelumsixsmith,35,Thu May 21 12:56:24 2015 UTC,Seriously. I shouldn't have to hunt for the list I made myself of things I actually want to watch.

netflix,36qhrn,noyurawk,0,Thu May 21 18:29:22 2015 UTC,Why is it the most important if you almost never play from it?
netflix,36qhrn,wantonexplosion,3,Fri May 22 00:05:24 2015 UTC,Its still at the bottom on the new interface.
netflix,36qhrn,caelumsixsmith,5,Thu May 21 19:33:12 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what goes on the head of Netflix designers to think ""oh, I know! Let's put this extremely useful feature ALL THE WAY DOWN so people won't be able to find it unless they scroll through the whole page!""..."
netflix,36qhrn,sauerquint,1 point,Thu May 21 19:50:08 2015 UTC,I believe that's because it's part of their adaptive row ordering.

It's all over the place, sometimes top, sometimes bottom, at the moment it's 4 rows down, next time it may be 3rd from the bottom. I have the new interface too. I hate it bad. Netflix is about choices so why am I locked into things I don't want? grrrrrrr."
netflix,36qhrn,caelumsixsmith,2,Fri May 22 01:40:09 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on the whole design thing and think there's a lot of room for improvement on that front, in all honesty I'm probably going to send them an email telling them how stupid it is in a second. However, I'm not sure if you knew but if you hover over 'browse' at the top then you can view your list without having to scroll to the bottom. I'm not sure if that helps but anyway :)"

netflix,36qhrn,Schnabeltierchen,6,Thu May 21 13:42:01 2015 UTC,Are you really sure? Like on the screenshots? I guess you must be one of the very few that got the new interface very early..   I too use Netflix Germany (mostly) and it's still the old look. White background and so
netflix,36qhrn,THUMB5UP,2,Thu May 21 13:49:08 2015 UTC,"It's the black background and that exact interface. I always wondered why some others had a white background. Also, I got very hyped because IMO that black (and apparently new) interface is terrible. Can't tell however if it's better or worse compared to the old one."
netflix,36qhrn,Sle,1 point,Thu May 21 14:32:40 2015 UTC,It looks better to the old/current (at least for me and majority) design. What do you hate about it? I guess I will know it soon and hope that I will end up liking it.

netflix,36qhrn,Coast_watcher,2,Thu May 21 16:48:52 2015 UTC,It's because the checkbox for testing the new interface was already checked for you. I discovered the change a couple of months back and read on here that I have to go in to settings to uncheck it if I wanted the normal layout back.
netflix,36qhrn,katoninetales,2,Thu May 21 22:47:15 2015 UTC,Same for me (Brazil). That's how it has been for me for about 3 months. I was trying to understand what was new on these screenshots.

netflix,36qhrn,ikidd,15,Thu May 21 11:35:19 2015 UTC,It's standard (British) English.

netflix,36te78,spookytrustno1,1 point,Thu May 21 23:37:37 2015 UTC,I suspect there is the reason that accounts can't be secured with a pin and thats licencing rules. I get the feeling that as long as its secured by 1 password they can get away with profiles but the minute there is an individual password/pin it would get into licencing issues
netflix,36te78,wakey87433,1 point,Fri May 22 01:49:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think it has to do with licencing. Some countries (Australia, New Zealand and Germany) have a additional password system like OP wants, more to the point it's a pin system. I don't know how secure it is right now, IIRC it was the case that you could create a PIN protected profile, but you were still ablle to switch to one that wasn't protected from there. Could be changed now,"
netflix,36te78,Abyss_85,1 point,Fri May 22 04:01:37 2015 UTC,The fact some countries have it suggests even more so it's licencing issues then. Those countries that have it most likely have it due to legal differences in the countries which have changed thats impacting the licencing terms as rolling it out in all regions would be simple
netflix,36te78,wakey87433,1 point,Fri May 22 11:20:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just uninformed here, but how? How could a feature that comes from Netflix and I can't imagine someone having any rights on be a subject to licencing?
