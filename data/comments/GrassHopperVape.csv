GrassHopperVape,3e3hw8,wakka420,6,Tue Jul 21 17:53:17 2015 UTC,Just loaded the first chamber. Number is GT000017. So far it's very nice. Will report back with any new info.
GrassHopperVape,3e3hw8,tubasco,3,Tue Jul 21 17:57:23 2015 UTC,"Nice!  others' serial numbers say GS (Grasshopper ""Stainless?"") with a much higher number (5xx & 6xx) so i guess it's safe to assume they started the numbers over when beginning to build the Ti models. Is this plain Ti? Thanks for posting!! (also, fwiw, my theory on the 5xx & 6xx numbers:  5=may build & 6=june build... or perhaps 5th & 6th gen?  anyone else thinking this?) EDIT:  just saw your other post confirming Ti @wakka420 :)"
GrassHopperVape,3e3hw8,krazzykid2006,7,Tue Jul 21 18:41:28 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to bet that the serial numbers are already on the parts while they are in a bin, whichever number happens to get grabbed is the number used.

Got the Titanium version, which is confirmed with a serial number starting with GT, not GS. Tested it with some bud my buddy who is no longer with us had. Set it at 3 and went to town. Pulled pretty hard on it 4 times. The ABV looks pretty good, probably has a few left in it. Right now it is resting on it's charger, taking a little nap from it's super long journey. Pretty sure #17 (it's official name now BTW) needs the rest. All in all its a solid vape so far. I hope I don't have any of the issues that others have had with funny lights."

GrassHopperVape,3e3n6q,MyAccountForReddit,3,Tue Jul 21 22:18:44 2015 UTC,I'm using the silicone cap yes. I'm a sucker for accessories.
GrassHopperVape,3e3n6q,ADirtyHookahHose,3,Tue Jul 21 23:17:28 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add that I put some blue dream in, then topped it off with a dab some urkle haze wax. Set it to ""3"" and gave it a shot. My findings indicate that until they come out with the oils attachment, this will be the way to go about using wax in the grasshopper. It melted right into the blue dream, and maybe even made the load last a little longer."

GrassHopperVape,3e3n6q,ChiefLoudFlower,3,Tue Jul 21 21:31:38 2015 UTC,"Nvm, might be related to the malfunction: the heater on my unit doesn't work.   Both batteries will turn on the unit. Red light for 2 seconds, then steady blue, then auto-shutoff. After auto-shutoff, the unit will blink red light every 2 seconds.  I was testing for offgassing when I asked you that question. Afterwards, didn't see anything, loaded it up, and no heat came through."

GrassHopperVape,3e31qz,_dabnation_,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:32 2015 UTC,"Ti is slightly more matte than as it naturally develops a thin oxide layer. Anodizing it increases the thickness of this layer, and the color changes depending on the thickness. Darker colors will radiate heat more efficiently, though it is yet to be seen how noticeable this difference will be."
GrassHopperVape,3e31qz,GHWhatwhat,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:59:20 2015 UTC,This. I'm blown away by this thermal property! I'm very close to changing to dark grey and your comment has pushed further into bumping to an anodized gh!
GrassHopperVape,3e31qz,evergreenvelveteen,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:10:20 2015 UTC,"This color is anodized, so I doubt it would chip bc it literally changes the metal. From what I've seen the color is more matte-- the Ti is not really any less shiny, just a slightly darker metal (from what I've seen)"

GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,comments_more_load,3,Tue Jul 21 13:09:48 2015 UTC,Sux.  I wonder if this is this an assembly issue or manufacturing?
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,happyself,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:57:12 2015 UTC,I think they said it's something about manufacturing before but this might be a different issue
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,rllytired,0,Tue Jul 21 16:50:12 2015 UTC,"I ask because I'm wondering about the state of their assembly crew.  For whatever reason I have the impression it's a bunch of untrained people they showed how to assemble.  Old people, kids who need a job, dude who got fired from Jimmy Johns, etc etc."
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,happyself,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:48 2015 UTC,hahaha hopefully it's not completely like that but I could see it being that way
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,rllytired,2,Tue Jul 21 17:47:26 2015 UTC,"After all this careful planning that's 2 major problems, we know of, with the back end. Not to be pessimistic but what the shit were they doing with pre production vs. now that made this an issue?"
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,LWC3D,2,Tue Jul 21 12:22:47 2015 UTC,"Not scaling up production, is the major difference. That's the who reason you don't produce in huge amounts until you've got things pretty ironed out, because producing is larger amounts and faster offers its own unique challenges. It's don't in batches, which means that in that batch something may not have been machines properly"
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,ItsNobi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:09 2015 UTC,"Its strange because HL had working units for 5 months now and assembled units for longer, so how did their testing miss so many issues?"
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,anon_throwaway0,3,Tue Jul 21 13:53:41 2015 UTC,It was probably just assembled wrong.... Just because they had like 10 or so working units doesn't just automatically mean that they can just replicate that process to make 300x as many and not expect a few errors during assembly.
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,Reeces_Pieces,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:11 2015 UTC,"This.  These guys are making every one from scratch, with custom manufactured parts and all.   It's like telling you to carve the perfect chair.  Now carve 5,000 more."
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,averyminya,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:04 2015 UTC,And I'm sure the initial prototypes were hand made whilst these custom machines no doubt need some calibration.
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,Drivebymumble,0,Tue Jul 21 21:53:02 2015 UTC,We have only seen one machine operating and half of it had to be done by hand. I don't see your point.
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,averyminya,3,Tue Jul 21 22:00:31 2015 UTC,I truly enjoy the absolutely unshakable conviction here that nothing exists in the world unless it's been documented in video on a subreddit.
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,-naja-naja-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:36:09 2015 UTC,"I'll admit, I was being smart. What I was getting at though is that we are really in the dark as to how they are actually building these.   All we know for sure is that they have gotten parts from their different manufacturers in batches, and have one video of how they build screens. With other bits of photo evidence, how can we know whether they are using machines or if they found a way to have it built by hand?   I'm not saying it's either or, I'm just talking if anything :P"
GrassHopperVape,3e25vj,averyminya,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:46:01 2015 UTC,"Of course we are. A lot of the parts and processes are proprietary. They have shown photos of other custom build tools in past updates, maybe in their instagram. I imagine it's still a mix of hand assembly and machine."
GrassHopperVape,3e2fth,MyAccountForReddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:00 2015 UTC,Nice! What made you upgrade to the titanium version? I'm debating moving from TI to color (dark grey) but I'm worried that scratches will mare up the color one much more noticeably than the standard TI.
GrassHopperVape,3e2fth,_dabnation_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:43 2015 UTC,"Better thermal properties, lighter weight, stronger material, and included leather case. I felt like all of these were worth the additional $45. Plus I paid for my SS hopper back in March so the upgrade allowed me to spread the cost out a bit."
GrassHopperVape,3e2fth,apunchtothaface,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:59:50 2015 UTC,"I just upgraded for the same reasons. Seems like the SS is nice, but I think going with the thermally cooler ti now while the price is still low is the smart move."
GrassHopperVape,3e2fth,GHWhatwhat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:23 2015 UTC,The thermal properties of the Ti versus the Ss have not been quantified or even verified yet. Until tests are done comparing production units I would only consider the other benefits. Common alloys of each metal are in a similar range and the difference could be minor.
GrassHopperVape,3e2fth,Danky-pants,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:43:43 2015 UTC,I am really looking forward to some verified results on the thermal properties. That's the only thing that would compel me to upgrade to ti.

GrassHopperVape,3dzcbw,whoamulewhoa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:25 2015 UTC,Pay like 5 times the normal price for an unverified unit(could be a pre-production for all you know) all so you can get it a few months earlier and without the  (lifetime)warranty. Makes sense to me! /sarc off
GrassHopperVape,3dzcbw,Reeces_Pieces,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:09:42 2015 UTC,"Anyone confirm that bit about the warranty? Why wouldn't it follow the unit? If you gift one, does that void the warranty?"
GrassHopperVape,3dzcbw,whoamulewhoa,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:36:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know that for a fact, but that's just how most companies work. Companies typically don't want people getting warranty if they didn't buy the unit from them directly or some other company that they have an agreement with(but definitely not ebay). If it was a gift than the gift giver could just also let the recipient have and change the email and password on the grasshopper website which I'm pretty sure is how they keep track of who the owner is."
GrassHopperVape,3dzcbw,Reeces_Pieces,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:53:13 2015 UTC,"If it's a lifetime warranty, then they should be willing to honor it no matter how many times the unit changes hands and whether resold or gifted. I have several Stanley thermoses which I've had replaced by their lifetime warranty. They have never asked where I got them."
GrassHopperVape,3dxuz2,UMDterps23,2,Mon Jul 20 12:48:20 2015 UTC,I got the SS case when I backed. I thought it was cool how it was smell proof and had a place to keep ground bud.  I would at least make sure that whatever you use can conceal the smell well unless you're somewhere friendly in which case I am a little jealous.
GrassHopperVape,3dxuz2,Reeces_Pieces,2,Mon Jul 20 15:26:13 2015 UTC,"In Maryland, so somewhere in the middle on the friendliness scale. I agree the smell-proof feature is nice with the SS case, but where do you store your extras on the go? That's a huge factor for me"

GrassHopperVape,3drvx5,_dabnation_,4,Sat Jul 18 21:46:45 2015 UTC,Yea I'm super suprised that this sub reddit isn't filing up with pics and comments about the GH. Especially since so many people are finally receiving their units.
GrassHopperVape,3drvx5,D4FTPUNKF4N,3,Sat Jul 18 21:43:15 2015 UTC,I was wondering about that too actually. I think some of them have been a little mad about it taking so long but honestly I wouldn't not respond because of that though. I almost always leave feedback and this is one of those things I would with a passion. If I didn't believe in it I wouldn't of paid $180 for it.
GrassHopperVape,3drvx5,nishidake,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"How many is ""so many""? I think that's a bit optimistic. It also seems like there is a troubling percentage of unit failures in the wild."

GrassHopperVape,3drvx5,sock2828,-5,Mon Jul 20 21:50:39 2015 UTC,They're still too busy brooding and bitching over how long it took.
GrassHopperVape,3drvx5,hellomyfrients,5,Sun Jul 19 05:36:14 2015 UTC,"I had some QC issues with mine, specifically that it wouldn't charge or run with the top fully screwed on (had to be partially screwed for battery to make contact).  It seems to be resolved now, potentially some minor alignment issues with the contacts.  If it happens to me again, contacting support.  Otherwise it's been wonderful.  Love the appearance, clouds are huge, ABV and efficiency is great, and the included silicone tip doubles as a 14mm (and probably 18mm too, haven't tried) SonG adapter, which is how it should be.  Only complaints are the battery life (so far not great in limited testing), and that the vapor is very hot, even with the inlcuded silicone tip.  Lip burning hot.  Which are both to be expected from a pen convection vape.  For the price, very satisfied."
GrassHopperVape,3drvx5,Jerm56,3,Sat Jul 18 22:54:57 2015 UTC,"curious how it was resolved? did it fix itself, or did you have to do anything?"
GrassHopperVape,3drvx5,hellomyfrients,4,Sat Jul 18 23:40:10 2015 UTC,"It seemed to fix itself.  I figured out that it worked by partially screwing until it charged, and then screwing to full very slowly.  After another session it ""broke"" again - partial screwing required.  It also gets very hot during the session so I'm thinking it has something to do with the heat.  Going to contact support tomorrow."
GrassHopperVape,3drvx5,hellomyfrients,4,Sun Jul 19 01:54:59 2015 UTC,"For the curious, I think I fixed it permanently late last night.  I noticed some grime on the battery compound and wiped it off with an iso wipe, and some thick black residue came off.  I polished the contact, the battery, and the bottom contact as well with iso and it seems to work fully screwed now.  Otherwise still enjoying the vape!  Put it through many sessions last night and I think I finally have a good sense of it."

GrassHopperVape,3drvx5,Nottooshabby7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:03 2015 UTC,But other than that the actual unit/ heating etc works fine right?

As for the screwing needing to be partial, wouldnt it stop screwing at a natural point where it should make contact and charge properly or do you think you over tightened it?  Btw what date did you back the early bird?"
GrassHopperVape,3drvx5,ItsNobi,3,Sat Jul 18 23:41:55 2015 UTC,I was on it as soon as it went live. I don't remember the date. I really don't mind the heat from the vapor or even from the metal. I click take a hit click again. It works for me. I think overall it's the best product out there and for the price there's no  contest.

There is no overtightening risk.  The threads end at a point and the bottom seals with the steel below.  That's ""fully tightened"", and how it should be assembled.  When hot my product doesn't charge at that full tightness.   I backed on 11/16/13.  Estimated delivery date was February 2014 (close enough, haha)."

If you get the chance and you are willing to risk having to clean it, could you see if you can vape kief, ground hash, very finely ground weed.. I want to know if the screens, especially the chamber-screen can handle fine grinds, as hashish is what is predominantly available where I live"
GrassHopperVape,3djykk,PetNature,6,Thu Jul 16 22:15:58 2015 UTC,"Hey dude. I see from your post history that you're from Norway, I'm too, and I've tried to use hash in an Arizer Solo vaporizer before. I put some hash into a bit of cotton, and then vape.

GrassHopperVape,3djykk,TinoDiCipro,2,Fri Jul 17 00:11:58 2015 UTC,"Anything fine like a powder would be the same. My main concern is if it gets let through the screens either side or if the fine consistency makes it too hard to draw air from it, or that the material is vaped very unevenly. Also with hashish, a big concern is that it all melts together, not letting air through it and sticking all over the chamber, but I suppose that isn't something you use a lot of?"
GrassHopperVape,3djykk,TinoDiCipro,2,Fri Jul 17 02:58:51 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately not. When we ordered mine we also opted for the oils front end (when the front end was still the chamber).

GrassHopperVape,3djykk,dorian345,2,Sun Jul 19 17:33:55 2015 UTC,"Perhaps these could enhance the performance? I've already bought one for each side of the chamber, only concern is that they are very fine and'll probably get clogged easily"

GrassHopperVape,3djykk,ItsNobi,2,Fri Jul 17 02:46:40 2015 UTC,If that was what they were doing they may be sending out the number based on exactly when you ordered but shipping them out not in order.

GrassHopperVape,3djykk,YaGottadoWhatYaGotta,2,Fri Jul 17 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"I think it may have been a fluke. Maybe it didn't tumble in the chamber after the first draw, I'm not sure. However, since the video I haven't had that problem. Most of last night and today has been a even consistency. I do want to mention I used new material each time I tried a new temp in the video."
GrassHopperVape,3djykk,YaGottadoWhatYaGotta,3,Fri Jul 17 20:54:13 2015 UTC,"Just looked at the vid again, and listened: I think one of his problems was that he subjected too little herb to too much heat too many times. Had he used more herb to absorb the heat he subjected to the too little herb, his mouthpiece wouldn't have gotten as hot as it did, and he wouldn't have charred those few little granules. This is not to suggest that one can't use just a very small pinch of herb, but rather, if a very small pinch is used, then lower heat or fewer sessions should suffice, or higher heat and a short session is all that's needed. He needs to play with his new GH more to tweak technique to accommodate a very small pinch if that's his preference."

I trust what they are doing but I wish they would spend the money to pay a couple more people to make the vapes. Although it would probably put them in debt for a bit and slow down production while they are being properly trained I feel like making enough to the point where stores want them on their shelves would make them more than enough to go back into the green and make profit.
GrassHopperVape,3dfzz6,-naja-naja-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:55:39 2015 UTC,"Wait... what? You want them to fuck their finances and slow assembly for the IGG backers and preorders so that retailers can have them faster?   They offered a retail buy in. Any retailer who took advantage of that should sure as shit have the privilege of being ahead of the retail game. The rest of the world can wait. Pretty soon there will be several thousand out there and at that point, retailers will decide if they want them. Let demand drive supply, not the other way around."
GrassHopperVape,3dfzz6,can_a_bus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:10:50 2015 UTC,"Well it would only slow things down while they train new people.

GrassHopperVape,3d7vtt,Wholigan425,3,Tue Jul 14 07:00:52 2015 UTC,"Intuitively anodization should impact the emissivity of the device, or the rate of heat transfer from the surface. From a little research the actual thermal conductivity of stainless steel vs titanium is very similar depending on the alloys used, both of them an order of magnitude lower than aluminium for example. In this application I am unsure which is actually more desirable, it's not as simple as it first appears. Lower conductivity may actually be preferred in this case in order to keep the heat in the heater and out of the body of the device. I think proper scientific tests are in order once the resources are available. It's interesting to note that thermal properties are not mentioned in the feature list of the Ti model on the website.  Colour, weight and durability were enough on their own to make the decision in my my case at least. :)"
GrassHopperVape,3d7vtt,GHWhatwhat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:43:33 2015 UTC,I think ideally you would want all parts other than the mouthpiece to be as thermally conductive as possible. The increased resistance in the mouthpiece would mean the heat is pushed to where it will be emitted faster. Maybe the solution is a ceramic front end haha.
GrassHopperVape,3d7vtt,chelderado,0,Tue Jul 14 21:16:39 2015 UTC,Maybe v2 will have aluminium or copper incorporated into the rear of the device.
GrassHopperVape,3d7vtt,GHWhatwhat,3,Wed Jul 15 00:55:21 2015 UTC,"After Buzz Danklin's criticisms of the heat issue on the SS I upgraded my order to titanium. To me it feels like $45 extra for the best possible GH isn't that much extra, and at the time I was fairly certain they would eventually deliver the GH, so I was ready to spend the exta cash.  You'll be happy with either, but if you're buying a vape you're already getting a killer deal here, so I don't think you should sacrifice functionality if you can help it. That's just my .02"
GrassHopperVape,3d7vtt,chelderado,2,Tue Jul 14 05:12:29 2015 UTC,"Buzz's comments comparing the heat of the SS to Ti are not relevant since the SS was a pre-production model without the change in insulation that was added by the time he received his Ti Hopper.  One of the guys over at FC has tried both (though only briefly) and anecdotally seemed to think the Ti was not quite as hot though I think we'll need some additional reviews or better yet, objective testing with a thermocouple to know definitively.  Also keep in mind that the difference in thermal properties between the plain and anodized Ti Hoppers is likely to be greater than that between the SS and Ti."
GrassHopperVape,3d7vtt,trxz370,2,Tue Jul 14 05:52:00 2015 UTC,"True, but there are other benefits to the TI including durability and weight (though some like a little more heft I suppose). Also, I highly doubt that a few micron thick anodized layer will cause any noticeable difference. You're more likely to tell a difference by how you hold the GH than the coating. In any case I went for the bronze GH because the new muted colors look amazing."
GrassHopperVape,3d7vtt,chelderado,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:04:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, for sure, personal preferences should rule.  While no metalurgical expert, I did read somewhere however that the anodization actually does have a greater impact on the thermal characterization than the differences between SS and Ti (though that also depends on the exact grade of SS and Ti).  Durability of the oxide coating could be an issue too (but I hope not as I've got a Green Ti on order!). Weight again is subjective.  Time will tell but my guess is that all will be close in performance and people should just order what they think looks best or weight they prefer."
GrassHopperVape,3d7vtt,trxz370,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:27:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I suppose we'll have to wait for the reviews to find out for sure. I'm guessing the Oxide coating will hold up better than most people are familiar with (because most anodized coatings are done to aluminium not titanium) but I'm sure it will eventually wear. At the end of the day, I don't think anyone will be disappointed by their hopper regardless of what they receive."

For the most part, shipping has gone smoothly. We are working very hard to get everyone their Hoppers as soon as possible. A few backers have experienced an issue but some of that is to be expected with a new product. This has caused things to move a little slower than we would have hoped.

You can check your estimated ship date by logging-on and navigating to Account -> Order Status. Shipping address confirmations will be sent out 1-5 days before your order is shipped. When you receive the confirmation you'll be given the opportunity to update your address at that time. This is the best way to avoid updating your address multiple times. You may still email an address change to support@grasshoppervape.com but we will not update it on the website immediately to avoid spending unnecessary time changing addresses.  We understand the wait has been longer than expected and we are doing our best to get your Hoppers to you as quickly as we can. Over everything else we value a quality product and will deliver only that. All pre-orders delayed past their original estimated ship date will receive a free extra battery with their shipment. We have also elected to include the silicon mouthpiece with every pre-order.  There's a lot going on around here so we apologize for any slow customer service responses. We'll get to every message, but it might take a few days longer than normal. Please also note that the pricing on the Hoppers will be changing in the near future.  The response from those who have received their Grasshoppers has been overwhelmingly positive. It has been an incredible experience to see all the hard work we have put into this vaporizer paying off. We truly appreciate your support as the Grasshopper would not be possible without it.  Thanks,  The Grasshopper Team"
GrassHopperVape,3d3mme,anon_throwaway0,3,Mon Jul 13 07:36:41 2015 UTC,"I thought the mouth piece is already included with every order? There was even a discussion about this, or am I remembering it wrong?"
GrassHopperVape,3d3mme,p0pc02n,3,Mon Jul 13 09:16:17 2015 UTC,"They originally were planning to include the silicone mouthpiece condoms with every order but pulled back when they found that the production cost for a food grade silicone piece was much higher than the non food grade prototype they had used.  They then said that they would not charge people who had pre-ordered because of the higher price charged but left open charging $5 to backers since they had paid much less.  As an ""experiment"" they invoiced $5 to a few backers for the condom but immediately credited it back so it would appear that it's back to being included for everyone.   Perhaps some additional clarity will be offered in their 7/15 update."
GrassHopperVape,3d3mme,trxz370,2,Tue Jul 14 06:18:53 2015 UTC,"Not everyone would have heard about that, I'm not sure but this might be the first update that they mentioned it in."
GrassHopperVape,3d3mme,GHWhatwhat,2,Mon Jul 13 12:06:53 2015 UTC,"Before a certain date, yes. They also played with the idea of charging for it and refunded the money of the ppl who actually paid, because having mentioned that it would be included months and months before they honored that ONE email across the board. Looks like theyve extended this generosity.."
GrassHopperVape,3d3mme,asdfgtttt,2,Mon Jul 13 15:32:37 2015 UTC,"Well, generosity or not, according to 99.9% of ppl who have used it the tip does get uncomfortably hot after a few hits. Seems to me its more of a necessity than a luxury add on. It'd be like them sending the pen without a battery."
GrassHopperVape,3d3mme,anon_throwaway0,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:24:49 2015 UTC,"That's not even close to true. Had you been reasonable we could have a discussion, but your presentation is anecdote hyperbole. 99.9..."
GrassHopperVape,3d3mme,asdfgtttt,3,Mon Jul 13 23:01:24 2015 UTC,Actually it is close to being true. It's been stated a number of times the GH gets uncomfortably hot after 2-3 back to back hits. So the mouth piece is necessary.

Do you guys have an actual date for your estimated shipping? Or does everyone's just say a month"
GrassHopperVape,3d3mme,Mcurt,2,Mon Jul 13 08:11:21 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on if your new expected delivery date is later than your original expected delivery date. My original was May 2015 and now says August 2015, your order status should have both dates."

GrassHopperVape,3cvldi,LWC3D,2,Sat Jul 11 17:39:44 2015 UTC,Remember in the update where they said there was an issue that was causing units to fail?  Thats not a magic thing that just fixes itself.  They either have to manually make repairs or do a full new order of stuff.

GrassHopperVape,3cvldi,Drivebymumble,4,Sun Jul 12 05:44:56 2015 UTC,"Thats what I said.  They sent a few out to start the shipping.  Some had issues, they repaired the issues for the hoppers to send to them and replaced them.  Now they are likely working on the rest of the units to ensure they are all working before they start shipping them.  I am fine waiting, I ordered in November 2013, a few more months ain't going to kill me.  All the people acting like this is vaporware are the crazy ones, if they were not going to send stuff out the would have gone quiet 3 months after the campaign started."

After I paid the upgrade fee, I waited three days for the upgrade to appear on the site and when it didn't, I emailed again asking if everything was okay and if he could give me a firm shipping date - I backed on November 29th, 2013.  He upgraded me and apologized for the delay, saying that everyone was very busy trying to get GHs out. He said my shipping date was July which, of course, was already listed on the website - I was hoping to get a specific date or just get an address confirmation email.  His email was very brief and I got the feeling that the unwritten message was ""leave me the hell alone, I'm working was fast as I can!"" He wasn't impolite, but I got the feeling that that was what he WANTED to say.  My point ( yes, there is one ) is that I'm not sure that bugging him at this point is going to get your GH delivered faster - it might have the opposite effect."

I believe those rules apply only to the indiegogo backers, as the UCC does not govern 'donations' but instead the sale of goods. Thus, UCC protects the pre-orderers. At the time of pre-ordering and based on what Trevor/Matt themselves stated, there was no reason to believe the grasshopper was a long way from being on the market. Why? Trevor and Matt constantly misrepresent material facts which impact a buyer's (or would-be buyer's) decision to buy (a.k.a. enter into a contract). Hell, even 12 months ago, people thought it was ready for the market. Why? Misrepresentation of material facts. Over and over and over again."

GrassHopperVape,3cpupu,asdfgtttt,3,Fri Jul 10 10:58:31 2015 UTC,Have you found any that failed?
GrassHopperVape,3cpupu,asdfgtttt,3,Fri Jul 10 17:34:51 2015 UTC,Yes. Here's one:  http://www.longboardism.com/2013/01/nojack-skateboard-lock-trevor-vita-matthew.html
GrassHopperVape,3cpupu,-naja-naja-,0,Fri Jul 10 23:40:36 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but it would seem a wise decision to let that one go, no? The kickstarter numbers bear that out."
GrassHopperVape,3cku6l,averyminya,23,Wed Jul 8 18:16:50 2015 UTC,dont worry. by the time you receive your grasshopper you'll have a new jacket
GrassHopperVape,3cku6l,opium_of_the_people,2,Wed Jul 8 18:49:58 2015 UTC,lol
GrassHopperVape,3cku6l,happyself,7,Wed Jul 8 23:08:25 2015 UTC,"Global warming will be so advanced at that point, so no need for a jacket. You should make a pocket in a pair of shorts instead."
GrassHopperVape,3cku6l,Spancer87,3,Wed Jul 8 22:48:50 2015 UTC,specs are on their website: 0.55in X 5.50in
GrassHopperVape,3cku6l,p0pc02n,-2,Wed Jul 8 18:29:46 2015 UTC,"I've seen that, but I also know that those are predictions of the old versions and have probably changed since then. I'm just looking for the measurment of the current product, not the prototype specs. Thanks though I'll probably end up using those if I don't get another answer :3"
GrassHopperVape,3cku6l,Niggoification,8,Wed Jul 8 18:31:47 2015 UTC,the size stayed exactly the same. Only some inner parts changed
GrassHopperVape,3cn04w,owner220,7,Thu Jul 9 04:14:25 2015 UTC,"Yieah, I preordered the green Ti model but when I saw the official lineup it didn't come out quite like I hoped. The blue looked great, though, so I sent an email till customer support and asked if I could switch. He got back to me quickly, and other than the fact that I haven't gotten my hopper yet, I feel good about the company, overall. [7]"
GrassHopperVape,3cn04w,everest3348,3,Thu Jul 9 04:34:12 2015 UTC,"For a moment, I thought I wrote this!"
GrassHopperVape,3cn04w,saxyroro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:28:21 2015 UTC,Yes. As previously mentioned 135757 times.
GrassHopperVape,3cn04w,Danky-pants,-8,Thu Jul 9 04:26:16 2015 UTC,"OP didn't do a single search about his/her question first.  Downvote OP, not DP!"
GrassHopperVape,3cn04w,happyself,0,Thu Jul 9 09:08:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but it's not in the latest update. It just says you can change your address, and that you can add items to a previously used account, and they would ship together at no extra cost. Maybe that's why DP is being down voted. I've thought about changin to a color also so I just went and re-read the latest update."
GrassHopperVape,3cn04w,Mikeg7265,0,Thu Jul 9 18:00:54 2015 UTC,I did search and all I could find was changing an order by adding on to it. Nowhere did I find changing an existing order from one grasshopper to another.
GrassHopperVape,3cn04w,monkeychef,0,Thu Jul 9 15:01:33 2015 UTC,"Yea, just email Trevor and ask nicely. He should respond within a two days or so."
GrassHopperVape,3cn04w,monkeychef,0,Thu Jul 9 21:35:06 2015 UTC,He responded this morning and he just charged me the $5 extra for the upgrade! Very satisfied with how quickly he responded and how easy it was for me to do this.
GrassHopperVape,3cn04w,Cloudzeater,0,Thu Jul 9 22:01:56 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear it! They've been communicating really well with individuals and have been really flexible when it comes to orders, so I'm not surprised to see that you were able to upgrade. Blue FTW!"
GrassHopperVape,3cjsr3,TriquetraG,4,Wed Jul 8 13:41:03 2015 UTC,"HL have stated that the Ti cases, as well as oils front end etc, will not be taken care of until we are rolling in hoppers."
GrassHopperVape,3cjsr3,LWC3D,3,Wed Jul 8 15:28:14 2015 UTC,"I read on FC someone got an email response from Trevor saying that they will discontinue Ti cases and only focus on SS, so I doubt that they will have colored Ti. Perhaps in the distant future they will revisit Ti cases and try colored cases to add to their inventory."
GrassHopperVape,3cjsr3,ADirtyHookahHose,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:16:11 2015 UTC,"That sucks, I really and a dream lol"
GrassHopperVape,3cjsr3,GHWhatwhat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:36:00 2015 UTC,"I had an email a couple of days ago stating that, ""The Ti tube is still in development. We are not sure when it will be ready as it is a low priority."" I am sure once their plate is sufficiently cleared they will have a look at demand and go from there."
GrassHopperVape,3cjsr3,anon_throwaway0,2,Sat Jul 11 16:29:29 2015 UTC,Couldnt they like powder coat the ss cases?
GrassHopperVape,3cjsr3,chelderado,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"Yah the ti case is, at this point, an indiegogo exclusive."
GrassHopperVape,3cjsr3,GHWhatwhat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:41:44 2015 UTC,"I want a blue one, hopefully once things get rolling they will have time to complete development of these. I'm sure that if there is a demand for it they will make it happen eventually."
GrassHopperVape,3cjsr3,ass_hopper,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:49:51 2015 UTC,"Don't get your hopes up, I think only the original backers who ordered Ti cases are getting them, I believe SS will be the only option thereafter.  Even if they bring back the Ti option, I'd think it's very low on their priority list, let alone color.   So the answer is maybe eventually but no time soon.  It's a nice fantasy though, but I'm preoccupied just waiting for the gh itself!"
GrassHopperVape,3cjsr3,D4FTPUNKF4N,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:24:26 2015 UTC,"Damn I didn't order a Ti case when I had the chance, but I didn't really like how they looked without color anyway"
GrassHopperVape,3cjsr3,p0pc02n,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:37:15 2015 UTC,:( I knooow riiight?
GrassHopperVape,3cjsr3,happyself,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:44:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe one day, far ahead in the future, when Grasshoppers are being shipped and the oils front end + the waterpipe adapter are being produced, your colored TI cases might become a reality, too."
