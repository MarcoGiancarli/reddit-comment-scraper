If you want something truly different, go for Schwalbe Marathon Plus.  They have so much rubber, kevlar etc. that they weigh about 800 grams so they are mostly for commuting/touring. They are both a heavier and harder ride, compared to other tires. But not really enough for me to care.  I've been commuting on mine almost every day for the last 2,5 years and I usually also ride in the weekend as it is my only means of transportation. They have yet to puncture after what I'd estimate as between 3000 and 4000 km. Considering the level of wear, I will be wearing them out before they puncture.

FixedGearBicycle,3dyfei,Marc-DeMaco,8,Mon Jul 20 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I have always loved this style of navigation since I have a pretty good sense of direction.  Unfortunately it doesn't work very well in the Netherlands because of the density. Cramming complicated road and cycling infrastructure together and linking it to medieval agricultural planning means I cannot tell you the number of times I came to a cross roads and ended up going completely the wrong way because the road's direction varied significantly a few km further along.  Of course, everything is quite well labelled so you'll be fine if you pay attention to the signs. The problem is you really have to put your faith into them and not think too much.  I experienced this as well today doing some new roads where the sign says, ""[Town] is to the left, 7 km."" and I am thinking, ""Well, I was heading north-east-ish it should definitely be somewhere to the right, down that path.""  But nope, followed the sign, and sure enough, 100 meters down, past where I could see, the path doubled back on itself, went under the highway, and continued the to the town I was looking for. Inspection later revealed that if I had actually turned right, going by heading, I would have gone literally the opposite direction from the town as that road too curved around on itself, only over a way bigger distance."

FixedGearBicycle,3dukd3,HeartlandPedaler,2,Sun Jul 19 23:17:54 2015 UTC,"Will these be on your commuter or weekend ride?  Archetypes and Belgiums are both fine hoops, and I'd also like to offer up Pacentis. They've been praised for their high quality and consistency, and the SL23 and SL25 are cheaper than Belgiums. The SL23 and SL25 have a similar profile, but the SL23 is machined for a rim brake and would be perfect for a front wheel.   As for hubs, if you aren't concerned about weight, Phils are a beautiful choice. The DAs are also gorgeous, but would require more rigorous maintenance as they have loose ball bearings. All City recently came out with their New Sheriff SL hubs, which are reported to be some of the lightest track hubs in production. Though not as common, Victorie Cycles have an awesome selection of hubs that could make for a really cool build.   Sorry for the info vomit!"
FixedGearBicycle,3dukd3,clitoral_experience,2,Sun Jul 19 23:41:53 2015 UTC,Love my Phils for road/urban/everything use. Just tossing in that $0.02
FixedGearBicycle,3dukd3,illustribox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:27:36 2015 UTC,"A wheelset worth more than a few hundred bucks probably isn't worth putting on a Rush Hour, as some have said.  Since you're willing to build (deliberately read and understand Brandt!), I'd very much recommend doing so.  It's good to understand the physics of a wheel.  Especially for a first build, something basic like Formula/Miche hubs with maybe the DT R460 rim would be promising.  I wouldn't spend on super fancy parts for your first build.  Formulas are a popular recommendation since when the bearings wear out, you can replace them with some really nice ones and have a slightly heavy but robust and excellent hub.  The DT R460s will have some aero advantage due to the width at the brake track, and they'll be robust.  I just got a set of those, and the finish on them is amazing.  They're a $40 rim that seems like a good competition to something like the $130 HED Belgiums.  Since you have the budget, some swaged (""butted"") spokes would be desirable."
FixedGearBicycle,3du0wf,torvardi,2,Sun Jul 19 13:35:43 2015 UTC,Are you looking to get custom? And do you want a frame specifically built in LA/California area?
FixedGearBicycle,3du0wf,94rado,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:40:57 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be specifically built in Cali area at all, the prices are just a lot lower there than where I'm from (Tel Aviv).  I'm riding a Colnago Master Mapei Aluminum frame right now, which isn't built for fixed gear\SS at all, though the geometry and style of ride suits me. So I'm looking for something similar that'll be suited for fixed. Iv'e got all the parts, just need a frame and fork set."
FixedGearBicycle,3du0wf,asopaque,2,Mon Jul 20 09:09:13 2015 UTC,"If you like road geometry, and interested in a steel frame, then I might recommend getting in touch with Richard Snook from Wabi and asking if you can stop by and take a look at his products.

He has a small warehouse/shop right in Downtown LA.  wabicycles.com"
FixedGearBicycle,3du0wf,asopaque,2,Mon Jul 20 14:52:21 2015 UTC,"ahhh...reread your post and saw you prefer aluminum.  Are you visiting someone here in LA?  Best selection might be had by shopping online and having the frameset shipped to who you are visiting.  Citygrounds often does not stock the inventory you see online in their store.  They might have it in the warehouse (which is about 40 minutes from the store), and can have it in the store in a day or two for pickup, or they have to order it and it will be there in a few days."

When a saddle is like 1/8th the price can you expect it to be anywhere near as comfortable/quality as the original?  This is why we don't buy shitty parts.

I've thought about getting in contact with MashSF to get a donut one produced, but that is the type of thing where you have to know someone at Mash to do (/u/Jehu920?). Honestly, I don't think that it is worth the effort to make them, but if the sub wants them I'll do what I can to get them made.  We don't/wouldn't need a design for the first one. We already have our logo."

Also owning the rights to that donut isn't really a thing considering it's basically just a cartoon donut we've seen everywhere. Move some sprinkles, alter the edges of the icing slightly and bam the only one who will know it's not exactly like your cap is you and copyright laws."

It's not gonna go through the triangle. Only way to defeat this is to saw off the tire.   I will say that OP has the real estate in that lock to also thread the lock around the seat tube. That would also keep someone from wedging a 2x4 in there and levering that shit off."
FixedGearBicycle,3dmsgh,daiz-,0,Fri Jul 17 18:50:20 2015 UTC,"Sawing the tire is exactly the problem. The Sheldon Brown method is a bad way to lock up a nice bike. His little cable is doing more to protect his frame than the u-lock. You can saw through a tire in a matter of seconds.   He should have also gone through the seat tube like you mention, or other people use the seat stays as well. Your lock should always pass through and secure your actual frame."
FixedGearBicycle,3dmsgh,AptMoniker,2,Fri Jul 17 19:56:20 2015 UTC,"Surprizingly, I haven't actually heard of anyone doing it though. My biggest problem with the method is that it LOOKS like a shitty lock up. It invites a thief to repeatedly check because they're not seeing Lock plus Frame."
FixedGearBicycle,3dmsgh,daiz-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:52:14 2015 UTC,"I don't hear many details of most thefts, only ""my bike was stolen"".   I don't think this locking method is all that common despite having a name. It was quickly shot down as not being all that secure. I think most people with decent frames probably exhibit better sense, or those lacking any do far worse. I wouldn't assume that not hearing about it means it isn't happening."
FixedGearBicycle,3dmsgh,killjobs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:10:39 2015 UTC,I don't understand. A thief is going to ruin the second most expensive part of the bike (the rear tire) and possibly destroy the frame to steal it? I mean if that type of thief is going to take your bike I'm not sure any locking scheme is going to be safe. But fwiw if you got a large lock stick it through the seat post as well.
FixedGearBicycle,3dmsgh,daiz-,0,Fri Jul 17 21:26:58 2015 UTC,"If you're referring to the video I linked in another comment in regards to destroying the frame. He didn't have to do it that way, that was just a demonstration of speed. An insignificant bit more time and he could have just cut more and guided the lock through.  As for the argument about the the rear tire being the second most valuable component. That's an asinine point. If losing the back wheel was enough of a deterrent to stop a bike thief, you might as well just lock to the very rear part of the wheel. I mean what kind of bike thief would remove a wheel to steal a bike!"

FixedGearBicycle,3dl4vm,1000_Lemmings,4,Fri Jul 17 04:11:30 2015 UTC,It will be uncomfortable at best and there is honestly no reason to do that.  Just keep using whatever pedals you have until you can pick up some decent road shoes.
FixedGearBicycle,3dl4vm,1000_Lemmings,2,Fri Jul 17 14:14:23 2015 UTC,"I have those pedals.  Yes, they're nice.  They also require road shoes if you run them safely or even effectively.  That's why the pedals come with cleats.  I understand that you may be excited, etc., but those pedals will do nothing but bad things for you if you don't use road shoes with properly installed/fitted cleats.  I'm not dissing you here, I'm genuinely concerned: this is one of the most unsafe suggestions I've ever read in this sub.  I hope you don't do it.  You need foot retention when running fixed, even if you run a rear brake.  Save some $ for shoes, find a good deal then install & enjoy.  I got my first pair for $45 on a clearance site like Clymb:  Scott Road Pros that usually go for $125-150.  Until then, run platforms & straps.  Even if you don't have them, get some.  I swap my SPD-SLs for platforms & straps pretty often on my fixed gear."
FixedGearBicycle,3dl4vm,Jehu920,2,Fri Jul 17 22:03:09 2015 UTC,"I do realize this, and I'm holding back on installing them until I can nab a pair of shoes. Still, in the off chance I need to go a quarter of a mile for something small, I doubt I'd bother changing pedals."
FixedGearBicycle,3dl4vm,Hazzica,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:07:01 2015 UTC,No way.  I run those pedals on fixed & road bikes.  Keep an allen key & 25mm pedal spanner handy & swap them out for platforms & straps or toe clips.  The switch takes all of 5 minutes if you're slow.

FixedGearBicycle,3djr30,kimbo305,3,Thu Jul 16 22:09:39 2015 UTC,"We'll i'm definitely not riding faster but on singlespeed I usually put the power down. It's a confidence thing with fixed. I just can't seem to stop properly with my legs, not skidding just slowing down, which in turn makes me either use the brakes a lot more (lights, crossings etc) or ride a lot slower (snails pace) before I'm not comfortable with controlling it and braking."
FixedGearBicycle,3djr30,kimbo305,2,Thu Jul 16 23:26:05 2015 UTC,"If you're going at the same speeds, just relaxing your legs and letting the crank push them around will decelerate the bike more than coasting on a freewheel."

Needless to say, I went pretty damn slow everywhere.   Have you learned how to skid? It's a pretty good skill to learn even if you won't be doing it all that often.  Anyway, if you want to get rid of a brake dependency, just try slowing down a bit earlier with your legs, making sure you have enough time to stop. You can stop pretty quickly by standing up and doing a push / pull on your pedals and straps, while still not skidding.  tl;dr, practice using just your legs and only use your brakes in an emergency"
FixedGearBicycle,3djr30,Skitch_n_Sketch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:45:15 2015 UTC,"Not tried skidding yet, my trouble is more slowing down properly without using the front brake. I've done literally half an hour on fixed."

You have a brake, feel free to use it.  Keep riding fixed and you will understand as you get more miles under your belt.  Try shifting your weight towards the rear wheel, resist on the downstroke and lightly push down on the upstroke."

FixedGearBicycle,3djr30,HARSHING_MY_MELLOW,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid to REALLY use your legs to resist the forward momentum of the pedals.  To get a feel for it, just slowly increase the amount of power you use to resist the pedals each successive time you come to a stop/slow down.  Obviously use your brake if you need to, but make an effort to stop relying on it for comfort. Make sure you use both legs, front foot pulling up, back foot pushing down.  Eventually you will reach a point where you will probably do a tiny skid accidently, and from there you really start to learn how much power it actually takes to lock up the pedals to skid.  As long as you take it slow and don't try to jump from zero resistance to using all of your leg strength, you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly."
FixedGearBicycle,3djr30,athst,3,Sat Jul 18 01:10:11 2015 UTC,"It's more about resistance. It takes a whole different set of muscles to apply back pressure. If your talking about skidding, you can learn a couple ways: first if you still have a rear brake you can kinda tap it and lock up your legs to assist in learning, or you can shift all your weight over your front wheel and lock your legs out behind you."

By the look of your set up it looks like you're doing mostly road riding as apposed to track, what with the bottle mounts and phone/computer mount. I would recommend looking into some compact road drop bars.

Just my two cents though,  cheers!  Edit: bars not bats."

FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,amateur_soldier,-1,Wed Jul 15 22:37:36 2015 UTC,"Thickslicks are completely slick, and in the rain will give you next to no grip."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,ElectricFishFry,11,Wed Jul 15 23:18:21 2015 UTC,"its not cuz its slick, its because its hard shitty rubber ."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,snakesign,2,Thu Jul 16 00:58:15 2015 UTC,"That makes more sense, thank you."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,Chester_A_Arthritis,2,Thu Jul 16 01:29:36 2015 UTC,"In my experience the rubber compound isn't hard at all. My gatorskins are much harder and less grippy than my thickslicks were. Having said that, they weighed a metric tonne and weren't very puncture resistance despite being so beefy."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,rockets_meowth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:38:14 2015 UTC,"This. The rubber is super soft. It shreds and kinda balls up when you skid on it like when you roll glue off of something. Gatorskins are really hard, they dont snag the pavement like thickslicks but they last a lot longer. Ran through 2 slicks in a month, not more than 400 miles total between the two."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,Chester_A_Arthritis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"I got about 1,500 miles (hardly any skidding) out of my thickslicks before changing. However, by the time i changed my tires my rear looked like it had been shot with a shotgun."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,snakesign,3,Fri Jul 17 14:00:17 2015 UTC,Is this actually true? Aquaplaning speed for a tiny tire at 90psi is like 100mph+.
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,amateur_soldier,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:10:13 2015 UTC,"It's not quite aquaplaning as far as I know, it's just reduced traction due to wet surfaces providing less friction"
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,snakesign,3,Thu Jul 16 05:59:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, wet surfaces have less friction.  Treads on a bicycle tire do nothing to address that because the tire pressure is so high and the contact patch is canoe shaped.  So there is no way for water to become trapped between the tire and the road.  So tread does fuck all nothing for narrow road tires on wet asphalt."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,rockets_meowth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:57:27 2015 UTC,"This is correct. Maybe with 28s and above the tread helps move water away from the wider contact patch, but thin tires all have a like 2cm cobtact patch that is canoe shaped like you said"
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,74300291,-1,Fri Jul 17 13:53:35 2015 UTC,"It's less about hydroplaning and more about traction. I'm sure the same is true for a dress shoe, but you see people going much slower than that still slip."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,snakesign,2,Thu Jul 16 00:33:11 2015 UTC,"Dress shoes have leather bottoms, that is a difference in coefficient of friction."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,74300291,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:34:59 2015 UTC,"Right, so wet ground and wet rubber have lower coefficients of friction than when dry. Any grippy bit you have on your tread helps artificially augment the...grippyness."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,PapasMoustache,5,Thu Jul 16 00:44:18 2015 UTC,"Very classic look to it,  I quite like it. You're probably going to get some hate for the front thick slick but if its what you got, its what you got."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,PapasMoustache,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:54:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks, i just switched to fixed so im learning from reading this sub and trial and error."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,poxi,3,Wed Jul 15 22:31:16 2015 UTC,"The only real issue is that thick slicks are very heavy and non responsive. They have rubber for days and will last forever for skidding so they're a great choice for the rear but there's really no reason not to have a lighter, more supple tire up front to improve grip and road feel."
FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,PapasMoustache,2,Wed Jul 15 22:57:15 2015 UTC,I'd love to get a thinner tire but where i live the roads aren't so great so punctures are rampant.

FixedGearBicycle,3deiup,IM_SHIT_AT_MATHS,3,Wed Jul 15 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"Continental Grand Prix All Seasons.  It's made with the same nylon mesh/polyXbreaker stuff that the gatorskins have. It also happens to have the same Black Chili rubber compound that the Grand Prix series of tires have. So unlike gatorskins, you get a tire with excellent traction, low rolling resistance, and enough bite that you can slow yourself decently through the drivetrain."

Its fun but I only really do it if I'm waiting for a car to turn or people to cross the street and I can't get around"
FixedGearBicycle,3dgdea,ieabu,2,Thu Jul 16 22:41:13 2015 UTC,It becomes a personnal challenge. There's a lot of contruction here so the cops are controlling the lights. Sometimes they let the other light go for so long and you're just there struggling with your track stand that once it turns green BAM hello floor. It happened to me once. It really was long. Maybe 4-5mins.   I just like forcing myself to track stand until the lights change.
FixedGearBicycle,3dgdea,DurasVircondelet,2,Fri Jul 17 01:21:59 2015 UTC,The best is rolling up to class in front of a big group of people and trying to track stand before getting off. Can verify that you'll end with your body on the other bikes and your bike on the ground.

I'm 48 and probably in better shape than I was at 28.  Then, about 3 years ago, my bandmate said ""have you tried fixed gear?"".  Although the first ride was awkward, it soon clicked with the same 'always in movement' feeling and sense of propulsion that ice speed skating has.  I was hooked.

A slick puts more rubber in contact with the road, thus offers the most grip.   Lots of people like Thickslicks, personally I don't. I've seen em dry rot really quick. I do think there may be batch quality issues."

FixedGearBicycle,3dgauc,Nordok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:51:32 2015 UTC,I run Conti 4 Seasons. They're a racier version of Gatorskins with a better compound.
FixedGearBicycle,3dgauc,zondwich,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:00:27 2015 UTC,I would assume mostly for symmetry. I can't imagine why you would intentionally run two heavy ass tires.
FixedGearBicycle,3dgauc,JollyGreenGigantor,3,Thu Jul 16 05:20:40 2015 UTC,I can't imagine why you'd even run one.
FixedGearBicycle,3dgauc,PostedAgainstMyWill,-6,Thu Jul 16 10:20:40 2015 UTC,Its done so when the rear wears down it can be swamped with the front tire in the middle of a ride. I've also heard people say they wait for the rear tire to wear down then swap because the rear tire has lost a lot of weight making it an ideal front tire that matches.
FixedGearBicycle,3dgauc,NiggaLetsTryItOut,9,Thu Jul 16 11:02:52 2015 UTC,Swapping a shredded rear tire to the front is pretty dangerous.

FixedGearBicycle,3dfofz,that-freakin-guy,3,Thu Jul 16 02:45:20 2015 UTC,"Man, the heavy duty locks will help.  They're a bitch to carry, I lug around two massive Kryptonite u-locks, a small for my front wheel to body and a large for my body and rear wheel to whatever I'm locking to, and even though it's heavy I don't really worry much for short term situations.  I need to glue some bearings into my alan key holes to prevent my bars and seat getting stolen though."

Straps and flat, bmx style pedals are best for riding with just about any shoe, and toe clips are just a standard metal cage with a thin leather strap, whereas a clipless setup(bicycle specific shoes that literally click into the pedal) are a necessary part of high performance riding. Hope you don't feel attacked, it's just too many new folks riding around with only flat pedals."

But personally, I'm not a fan of the frame itself because it's got more of a road-oriented geometry.  Others may love that, so my criticisms are limited to just me and other ""classic track geo"" people.  A 43mm fork rake, 98.4cm wheelbase, and 42.5cm chainstay length on the smallest size frame?  This is a road bike with horizontal forkends instead of dropouts.  If they tightened up the geo, I'd consider one as my next frame."

FixedGearBicycle,3dbk2t,clitoral_experience,2,Wed Jul 15 00:36:55 2015 UTC,"First, check if it's your size and give yourself a rough fitting. Get some friends to help if you can/want.  If you can afford them, tougher wheels (high spoke count, usually 32 or higher) would be a great idea as most average wheels aren't built to support a rider of that weight continuously, typically these would be referred to as wheels for a  ""clydesdale"" which is a pseudonym for heavy rider. I'm sure you'll be fine if you don't hit pot holes or do anything other than accelerate and decelerate with them, but given that it's a bike from the lower part of quality, they aren't too strong. When I first got my Windsor ""The Hour"" I weighed about 265lb @ 6'1"" and my wheels would develop to be slightly untrue every month and a half or so. Eventually I upgraded to some proper wheels (miche pistard in the rear and mavic ellipse in the front) and experienced the problem only once in the rear when I had hit a pot hole by mistake.  Some high-spoke count B43s or at least Deep-Vs would be great for you. B43's are triple walled so they're really damn strong."
FixedGearBicycle,3dbk2t,Eutow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:48:54 2015 UTC,Any links to what you are talking about would be much appreciated. I don't know much about bikes with pedals.
FixedGearBicycle,3dbk2t,Eutow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:14:01 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. Before I begin, I HIGHLY recommend you check out the Global Cycling Network YouTube channel. These are ex-pros that share excellent knowledge applicable to all spectrums of cycling. Here is their playlist for their guide to bike fits.  If you'd like to give yourself a fitting, check out this fit calculator. It might seem a bit odd, but the way your body fits with the bicycle is incredibly important. Not at all riders have the same body, and not all riders of even similar features are comfortable in the same ranges of motion. The reason why you should check this out is to see if the bike is too small or too big for you. Since you said it was your gift I'm guessing you don't know if it's the right or ride able size for you. If there's any stickers on it that say a double digit number between 48-62(these aren't the only frame sizes but they are commonly produced), correlate that within a size either lower or higher from what the calculator tells you. Try and get as close as possible with the measurements so you get close to the right number, but do take it with a grain of salt as it won't be the same as getting a fit done from a professional.  As for wheels, since you are on the heavy side, I highly recommend to get a stronger set of wheels. The B43 wheels are from a company called Velocity and are a very, very sturdy rim (triple walled) and with a high spoke count will keep it strong. It seems like they aren't made any more, but they were popular as all hell so they won't be hard to find if you have a decently sized fixed gear community. Thicker spokes will be a benefit as well, but I think whatever comes standard on those should be okay. Don't worry about weight on the bike as losing weight from your body is far less expensive than low weight bike parts. Also, there are plenty of wheels to choose from, just start doing some research and you'll begin to find out what can work for you.   Also, www.sheldonbrown.com is the holy grail of bike information, check it out."

FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,Jehu920,5,Mon Jul 13 20:56:55 2015 UTC,Damn look at all those points.  Clearly he is not in the minority.  I guess my only question is why.  But just because you can always seems to be the answer.  I mean. It's a cool cruiser.  Is it even fixed?
FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,bigtoepfer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:53:22 2015 UTC,There really is no reason why. This is one of those bikes we'd see and say no one would buy this. That's why I was surprised to see that someone actually owned one.
FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,Jehu920,2,Tue Jul 14 03:06:48 2015 UTC,Clearly we are still in the minority somewhat the post itself has more upvotes than this comment string combined.
FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,bigtoepfer,2,Tue Jul 14 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"Regardless of its practicality, it is an interesting bike."
FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,Jehu920,2,Tue Jul 14 05:21:44 2015 UTC,"I guess..  My question is, is it actually fixed?  I mean with no brakes I guess it would have to be.  I don't see a coaster brake setup."
FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,bigtoepfer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:25:37 2015 UTC,The wheels look like track wheels and the absence of a brake makes me think so.
FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,velowrench,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:36:40 2015 UTC,That or coaster.  But I don't see the little setup needed to make a coaster brake work.  They do specifically sell this frame as a coaster brake setup.  I don't know that there is a coaster brake gates setup.   But this bike can be bought with normal ass chain drive.
FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,bigtoepfer,8,Sat Jul 18 04:23:52 2015 UTC,looks like a bike rack
FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,zambaccian,7,Tue Jul 14 01:57:39 2015 UTC,Velonia Viks frame. Gipiemme Pista wheels. Gates carbon drive belt.
FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,GeneralGlobus,4,Mon Jul 13 15:34:19 2015 UTC,Price? For the frame.
FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,heechum,2,Mon Jul 13 19:26:35 2015 UTC,It's not a frame it's got double the fork and half the frame.
FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,djmakk,7,Tue Jul 14 04:18:28 2015 UTC,How do you brake? I thought it wasn't recommended to brake (skid etc) with belt drive systems.

FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,SwedishChef727,2,Mon Jul 13 16:53:10 2015 UTC,"What's the diameter on those bars? They look like they may be too thick for grips, but I don't know how tape would look on a straight bar. And if the bars and tubing are an unusual thickness, does that make it harder for you to find lights and accessories too? Neat/Weird frame though!"
FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,SwedishChef727,3,Mon Jul 13 20:57:16 2015 UTC,I think about 2-2.5 cm. Yeah accessories are hard to find. But I think I'm going to wrap it with leather bar tape. Lights shouldn't be a problem..

FixedGearBicycle,3d4wvs,balls_draper,13,Mon Jul 13 16:03:47 2015 UTC,colnago frame at home   and it's not built up? C'mon Son!

FixedGearBicycle,3d5j3v,banchad,2,Mon Jul 13 18:50:25 2015 UTC,I'd recognize that uneven concrete anywhere!
FixedGearBicycle,3d5j3v,banchad,2,Mon Jul 13 21:41:04 2015 UTC,Dude whats your training routine? Jealous of your engines.
FixedGearBicycle,3d5j3v,banchad,6,Mon Jul 13 19:23:41 2015 UTC,"haha, my routine isn't exactly some traditional workout that people tend to do cause people seem to find it dangerous.  I have a few routes that I train on that have moderate traffic 3 lanes wide that move around 30-35 mph. I tend to wait on the side of the road for red lights and see if any cars pull up, then I pull up beside them holding a track stand and floor it as soon as the light turns green and try to ""race"" these cars for about 600 to 1000 meters depending on the stretch of road.  So to break it down, I'm essentially doing 6-8 sets of standing starts for 600-1000 meters on a 52 x 15 or 52 x 14 (91.3"" & 97.6"") over the course of an hour or 90 minutes.  Post workout, I take mass gainers and eat a lot and that's about it!   My endurance is alright, but point races, miss and outs, and all those other endurance races kick my ass, so I'm more sprint oriented."
FixedGearBicycle,3d5j3v,KayceS,2,Mon Jul 13 19:37:16 2015 UTC,"Damn son. I do 5x5 squats, deadlifts, cable rows and some core stuff but I'm nowhere near you. Do you use this bike to train on or do you use one with brakes/gears?"
FixedGearBicycle,3d5j3v,Jehu920,2,Mon Jul 13 19:42:56 2015 UTC,"I train on this bike.   I forgot to mention I did hit the gym and did squats, leg press, and dead lifts, and some box jumps but I haven't been able to go recently because of such a tight racing schedule.   Over the past winter I did do calisthenics, mainly pull ups and muscle ups. I found that my lats help out a lot during my sprint efforts when I'm pulling on the handlebars. Here's a video as an example of one of my calisthenic workouts.  I've got a bunch of my workout stuff posted on instagram if you're interested."
FixedGearBicycle,3d5j3v,citrons_lv,2,Mon Jul 13 19:48:54 2015 UTC,That video of you doing the pullup on your bike is fucking hilarious!
FixedGearBicycle,3d5j3v,KayceS,2,Mon Jul 13 19:53:48 2015 UTC,How'd you do?
FixedGearBicycle,3d5j3v,KayceS,3,Mon Jul 13 21:15:21 2015 UTC,"Got 3rd over all in the omnium, didn't do so well in the point a lap and 40 lap point races.   I got 3rd in the Miss and Out and Sprint Finals and 1st in the Keirin race.  It was hot, and legs were trashed from the day before during sprint night which I won 1st in the 5 lap and 10 lap scratch race.  Overall, I can't complain; made $140 over the weekend from racing! :)"
