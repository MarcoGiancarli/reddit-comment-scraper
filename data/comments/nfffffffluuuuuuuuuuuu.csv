nfffffffluuuuuuuuuuuu,3div02,Cylon2910,3,Thu Jul 16 17:00:22 2015 UTC,"For those new to football. In the 90's the Cleveland Browns, moved their organization to Baltimore and changed their name to the Ravens.  However as part of the move they forfeited all of the teams history and were a whole new ""team"" despite keeping personnel and players.  Years later the Browns organization would come back as an expansion team, however kept the teams history of wins and championships.  Yes they won many championships before the super bowl era."

Lynch's numbers showed he was not a sure bet at the 1, and I respected their decisions. But when Wilson claimed that God ""spoke to him on the third step""... Obviously God is a Pats fan."

nfffffffluuuuuuuuuuuu,3d94xr,FriendzonePhill,2,Wed Jul 15 02:28:51 2015 UTC,I can't wait for Bradys suspension verdict. There's going to be so many memes and outrages. It doesn't matter which way they decide.
