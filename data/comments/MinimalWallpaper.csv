When one on the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres; a force is transmitted through the stationary spheres and pushes the last one upward.

MinimalWallpaper,31xywz,T3hSpoon,2,Thu Apr 9 03:52:52 2015 UTC,"Photoshop. If you want to minimize the number of colors, make 2 to 5 Threshold adjustment layers with values ranging from 70 to 160. Then, use the results as layer masks for Fill layers. Make sure every Threshold layer is visible one at a time.  What this does is to filter color ranges and lets you add whatever color you want for shadows, midtones and highlights.  You can then apply a Ink Stamp Effect from the Filter Gallery to smoothen the edges, and that's about it. Since there are Fill layers, you'll be able to adjust the color palette to whatever you like. Though I recommend using palettes from colourlovers.com.  Optionally, you can apply a high pass to a texture copy the result over what you've done previously, then set it to Linear Light or Overlay with 70% Opacity, so it doesn't look too sharp.   Here's PSD sample I did with Rocket from GotG. >>"

MinimalWallpaper,2yxcaw,Surtur1313,10,Fri Mar 13 16:47:55 2015 UTC,Are these your own content?   They're gorgeous.
MinimalWallpaper,2yxcaw,sleepertime,7,Fri Mar 13 19:35:16 2015 UTC,They are indeed. I've been messing around with minimal wallpapers the past few days and these are a few of the 'better' looking ones. I'll likely have plenty more to post up in a few days of a much better quality.
MinimalWallpaper,2yxcaw,sleepertime,3,Fri Mar 13 19:38:41 2015 UTC,"I haven't even opened them on my desktop to notice,  but I agree, these need to be made in 2160p.   I also have a 4K monitor.     There's no reason not to make images in higher resolution than you need if you're working from scratch like this.       All my work is in 4K or higher just for the sake of making it compatible with any displays regardless of resolution."
MinimalWallpaper,2yxcaw,grizzleyadamsbeard,4,Sat Mar 14 02:10:37 2015 UTC,I really was only messing around with a few ideas with these. I'll get to work on making some higher quality 3840 x 2160 (/u/yayoranges) ones over the next few days. Thanks for the feedback!

MinimalWallpaper,2yxcaw,grizzleyadamsbeard,5,Fri Mar 13 19:43:54 2015 UTC,"These are awesome, any chance of making some at 3840 x 2160 or higher?"
MinimalWallpaper,2yxcaw,elinger_,2,Sat Mar 14 00:13:40 2015 UTC,These are great! Are there any higher resolutions available!?
MinimalWallpaper,2yxcaw,elinger_,2,Sat Apr 25 23:48:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks a ton! I've received a few messages over the past while about higher resolutions (/u/elinger_), and unfortunately I've come to a stand-still - my PC has died, and it seems likely to be a few more months before I'll be able to build a new one. For the moment, this means I have no way of really working on anything - however, in the future, when possible, I do intend to play around more with some of the ideas here. I'll be sure to post them in this sub when the time comes. Apologies!"
MinimalWallpaper,2yxcaw,Wombat_H,2,Sat Apr 25 23:54:02 2015 UTC,No problem! I completely understand and I'm really sorry to hear your PC died. I might be able to try and help you fix it if it's just a trivial hardware or software problem however.
MinimalWallpaper,2yxcaw,AnalogDan,2,Sun Apr 26 01:42:31 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately not trivial! Using a Lenovo ideapad (S400 Touch), and while opening it the other day (carefully, as always) it more or less snapped... The section where the power button is has completely broken, and a huge chunk of the covering has come off. I can no longer get it to power on. I've been planning out a PC build for some time anyway, I figure I'll take it as a sign!"
MinimalWallpaper,2yxcaw,LoarC500,2,Sun Apr 26 01:45:17 2015 UTC,"Aww, that sucks, but at least it finally pushed you toward building a PC! If you have any questions let me know, I've built 2 and have helped a friend build his. :)"

MinimalWallpaper,2xskvq,theonlytate,2,Wed Mar 4 05:36:39 2015 UTC,"I can't escape the feeling that the top triangle should have round corners, like the rest if the shell. It's probably just me but the pointy triangle looks a bit jarring."

MinimalWallpaper,2xskvq,GrundleFace,1 point,Sun Mar 8 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"The top triangle seems a little off-center or not pointing in the right direction..

Overall it's beautiful, definitely something I would use. Awesome job."

I can throw some gold your way in return.  Anyway, I think its really cool. Its interesting and minimal, which makes it an awesome wallpaper IMO."

Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist/co-writer Rob Liefeld, she first fully appeared in X-Force, vol. 1 #11 (June 1992).  In addition to her exceptional marksmanship and hand-to-hand skills, Domino possesses mutant probability-altering powers, similar to those of the X-Man Longshot. She often uses her skills as a mercenary, but has also been the partner, confidante, and lover of the superhero Cable, a lieutenant in his militant group X-Force, and a member of the X-Men.

MinimalWallpaper,1uhz36,Nitrous_Ninja,2,Mon Jan 6 00:40:27 2014 UTC,Those masks have been around for awhile. I think someone made a set of a few superhero posters and they made a shirt from it. Id just google them one at a time by searching like wolverine fan art or wolverine face and try to find the name of the artist or the style name.
MinimalWallpaper,1uhz36,diyfolk,2,Mon Jan 6 09:28:38 2014 UTC,I spent about 30 minutes googling without finding anything. This t-shirt is the closest I got.

MinimalWallpaper,1txerg,BlackBirdDk,1 point,Mon Dec 30 01:20:43 2013 UTC,"If you look closely around the edges, you'll see a sort of weird fuzzification thing with little blocks of ""off"" colour. This is because JPGs are both lossy (they get rid of data, like mp3s do) and their lossy algorithm is designed for photos, i.e., not solid blocks of colours with clean lines like this image. PNG on the other hand do not discard data in the compression process, and so reproduce a perfect copy of the original image, which means no nasty blocky/fuzzy around edges."

MinimalWallpaper,1e3zno,LooneyLopez,2,Sun May 12 03:10:25 2013 UTC,"This is Sugimoto's comment on his works:   Water and air. So very commonplace are these substances, they hardly attract attention―and yet they vouchsafe our very existence.  The beginnings of life are shrouded in myth: Let there water and air. Living phenomena spontaneously generated from water and air in the presence of light, though that could just as easily suggest random coincidence as a Deity. Let's just say that there happened to be a planet with water and air in our solar system, and moreover at precisely the right distance from the sun for the temperatures required to coax forth life. While hardly inconceivable that at least one such planet should exist in the vast reaches of universe, we search in vain for another similar example. Mystery of mysteries, water and air are right there before us in the sea. Every time I view the sea, I feel a calming sense of security, as if visiting my ancestral home; I embark on a voyage of seeing."

I made a separate post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1fyyek/i_just_made_a_simple_weatherbased/  First, you'll need to find out if you can install this somehow.  It runs on python, which you should have on mac.  You'll just need to put the executable somewhere like /usr/bin.  Make a file somewhere and pop in the code I wrote.  Make it executable.  Change ""#!/bin/zsh/"" to ""#!/bin/bash"".  (I didn't use anything in the code that is specific to z shell, and zsh isn't installed on OS X by default)  All you'll need to do is find a utility to change the wallpaper from the command line.  A little googling suggest you'll need to make an Automater script.  Make a few, one to change to ""Sunny"", one to ""Cloudy"", etc.  I don't really know how to use Automator, but if you need help, I could probably figure some stuff out.  (I'm dual booting mac and linux).  Get rid of all that ""FEH"" stuff.  That's supposed to change the wallpaper, but you won't have that program on OS X.  Replace the FEH line under each of the four sections with the automator script.  I think it should look something like ""automator /path/to/workflow"".    Hmm.. it appears other solutions for changing the wallpaper are here.    The next step is to run this with cron or another scheduling utility.  Last time I checked, cron has a replacement on Mac.  It's called launchctl.  Here's some info on scheduling utilities for Mac..  You'll need to make the main script run every once in a while; I have it set to updating every 15 minutes.  I hope that's enough info to get you started!  If you need help, just message me."
