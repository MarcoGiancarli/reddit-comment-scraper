powerwashingporn,3d4kur,AgDrumma07,7,Mon Jul 13 15:05:12 2015 UTC,"I'll try to get some street level shots later today, but they have scaffolding covering the entire sidewalk so nothing falls on your head. As for neighboring properties, here is the building on Google Maps with satellite view on. The front road is Michigan Ave, a major street. Two sides have alleys (Chicago is big on their alleyways), and the other is a relatively active street. The neighboring properties should be OK bar a bit of wetness here and there."

powerwashingporn,3cupir,Skbmcg7,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:29:35 2015 UTC,This is my first time power washing. Is it supposed to look so choppy?
powerwashingporn,3cupir,DiscoRage,11,Sat Jul 11 00:30:03 2015 UTC,"When you say choppy, are you talking about these lines? Either way, you need to change up your technique. Those lines are from pulling the trigger while aiming the nozzle at the surface, or from changing directions. The uneven pressure can even tear up the wood. Try pulling the trigger with the nozzle pointed away from the surface, then bring it down and across in a sweeping motion, then up and away before releasing the trigger.  It's a learning process, you'll get better with practice."
powerwashingporn,3cupir,pubmech,8,Sat Jul 11 03:22:58 2015 UTC,"Take a pump up sprayer or a brush and bucket and give it a good coat of bleach and water. 20% household bleach when the boards are dry will even it out and brighten the wood.  The marks are just from it being unevenly clean.  Hard to get uniform with a wand, and if you use too much pressure it will separate the fibers and give it a 'fuzzy' look.    Then as Skbmcg7 said; sand and seal!"
powerwashingporn,3cupir,gittenlucky,2,Sat Jul 11 01:58:47 2015 UTC,"I have found that if you hold it a bit further away you still get the pressure you need, but the finish is more uniform."

powerwashingporn,3c8tf5,Pseutri,2,Mon Jul 6 15:48:36 2015 UTC,A brush is much more likely to scratch the finish - pressure washers are used by a large majority of vehicle detailers and as long as you don't use it on compromised areas (where paint is already peeling) it doesn't damage the finish.

Assuming the accessory is capable of even flowing that much, that's moving a pretty decent amount of water.  One hour of constant spraying would be just shy of 1900 gallons.

powerwashingporn,3agifp,Jose_Monteverde,6,Sat Jun 20 01:11:24 2015 UTC,It will definitely clean a lot faster than most pressure washers. It would clean best by only using one or two machine instead of all four (3000 @ 7.8/15.6). This is a pretty special setup designed to move oil and sludge in tanks. It wouldn't damage your sidewalk though.
powerwashingporn,3agifp,JustCallMeEro,25,Sat Jun 20 01:42:01 2015 UTC,wouldn't damage your sidewalk though   Yeah... cause there wouldn't be any sidewalk left to damage ಠ_ಠ

When you're talking about that much water, you also have to look at other bottlenecks in the system, including the supply hose, swivel size (for a surface cleaner), etc.  You wouldn't need that much pressure for a sidewalk, as most don't require more output than your average Home Depot special."

A few details, for those who are curious:  We were using a 1600psi power washer, a good portion of the time not on full power (some of the grime was tricky to get off even at full though). Didn't look like it caused any significant damage to the paint that I could see, but we'll try our hand at waxing at some point and see if it can be salvaged. The paint doesn't look as good as the picture shows (the shine was from the water still on it), but it's exponentially better than before and I hope to get it in good enough condition for it to always look that way"

This was a cross post from /r/autodetailing   This is my 1998 Audi A4 Avant that I'm in the midst of rebuilding. These areas were cleaned so I could prep them later for a respray.  I used these products:  Chemical guy's All Clean +  McCulloch MC1385 Steam Cleaner  The steam cleaner helped break up the majority of the grime, and I was able to wipe it down with a bunch of rags. The all purpose cleaner helped speed up the process.   All this took me a span of about 3 days, going about 4-5 hours each day  The most time was spent in the engine bay.

powerwashingporn,39pvyc,HeadOfMax,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:13:19 2015 UTC,I spray the whole thing with dollar store oven cleaner and use a stiff brush to work it in then let it sit and hose it off.  I haven't found the steam cleaner to work too well on giant blocks of metal without the aid of chemicals as the metal will disperse the heat from the steam pretty quickly.  I have used the steam cleaner to rinse the oven cleaner off but I mainly use the steam cleaner for harder to reach places.  The steam cleaner with help but not do the entire job on its own.

powerwashingporn,39ip3b,Danilo_Mello,2,Fri Jun 12 01:47:34 2015 UTC,How did you start your business? Any tips or advice you can give out?
powerwashingporn,39ip3b,BurninatorJT,9,Fri Jun 12 01:52:42 2015 UTC,"We started doing homes and then eventually moved to stores/larger projects as we grew. We got an old trailer setup on the cheap to start but it was powerful enough to get us going/generate enough to buy better trailers in no time. Where we're from, no company uses trailers. They basically (by basically, I mean actually....) all use ones you can buy at Home Depot. That's what made us stand out from other companies.   We've actually been approached by a local company that does residential work asking if we did homes and they were extremely relieved to hear that we don't do homes anymore. One time when working out of state, our hoses were slashed by local companies while parked at a hotel (we do overnight work so we sleep during the day).   Other tips? Get. A. Surface. Cleaner. They will save you.   As for marketing, word of mouth was basically our starting strategy and it worked. If you're interested, have questions, etc, head over to /r/pressurewashing!"

powerwashingporn,39ip3b,IRPancake,3,Fri Jun 12 03:27:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, you keep it in great shape. It looks brand new! Some systems have an intake on the pump to selectively pull chemical from a separate tank. Or, you could have it go through a little electric pump with a separate hose reel and gun to make it a bit easier."
powerwashingporn,39ip3b,BurninatorJT,5,Fri Jun 12 03:41:55 2015 UTC,"That's because it basically was brand new in the photo ;D We mounted signs on the outside of it now but I didn't want to advertise so I didn't use a recent shot. However, because it's so convenient to clean, we keep them in immaculate shape!  Edit: Didn't see the other bit. Using sprayers seems to be the quickest for our purposes since we use barely any chemical to begin with but I see what you mean for heavier uses!"
powerwashingporn,39ip3b,IRPancake,2,Fri Jun 12 03:45:59 2015 UTC,That's the best part eh. Never have to take your truck to the car wash either!
powerwashingporn,39ip3b,BurninatorJT,6,Fri Jun 12 03:55:08 2015 UTC,"Not a bad looking machine. But to run 5800 PSI @ 12 GPM, you'll need about a 70 HP gas engine. Your machine is going to be running around 3500 @ 7.5 with a 23 HP. Two wire hose are rated either 5800 or 6000."
powerwashingporn,39ip3b,IRPancake,3,Fri Jun 12 01:39:05 2015 UTC,"According to this site, I'd need a 40 Horsepower engine to achieve that spec. I think the rating means that the engine/pump can dish out a max of 5800 PSI but not at 12 GPM and vice versa. But in any case, for typical jobs we lower the PSI and split the setup for two guys."
powerwashingporn,39ip3b,TheBlindAndDeafNinja,7,Fri Jun 12 03:14:33 2015 UTC,"That's for hydraulic motor which is different than a gas engine. We us this formula for gas belt drive (A x B) / 1014 and (A x B) / 1045 for gas direct drive. A = PSI, B = GPM."

powerwashingporn,394f13,digitalsciguy,4,Tue Jun 9 13:59:02 2015 UTC,This isn't a power wash. This is the result of ongoing refurbishment to the roof. I believe the contract was around £20m
powerwashingporn,394f13,tbeech20,2,Tue Jun 9 14:52:40 2015 UTC,Ah! Thanks for clarifying. That's about 30m USD and pretty much in line with what I'd expect for the refurbishment of a historical landmark; it's also about the same cost as the latest transit station to open in my city.

powerwashingporn,38y6zb,Hobbert99,6,Mon Jun 8 01:42:02 2015 UTC,I am strongly thinking about buying this one's larger brother (the 3100psi/2.5GPM one) since they just went down to $429 at  home depot.  How do you like it so far?  How loud is it?
powerwashingporn,38y6zb,Terrh,3,Sun Jun 7 21:48:49 2015 UTC,It's not too loud kinda quiet actually. Quieter than our previous one that was only 2500psi (water pump exploded.) This one is 2800psi and it was $299. You sure you need the extra power? This one cuts through literally everything. I must say though it seems to either be a gas guzzler or it has a small tank. Would definitely recommend however.
powerwashingporn,38y6zb,TopCop53,7,Sun Jun 7 23:59:07 2015 UTC,Small tank. Want to say it so while you refuel you are giving the pump a break from constantly running.
powerwashingporn,38y6zb,Terrh,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:01:22 2015 UTC,Very true. Never thought of this
powerwashingporn,38y6zb,Terrh,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:56:54 2015 UTC,It's $389 here so only a $40 difference. I figured I'd go for the extra power.

powerwashingporn,38tqka,pasaroanth,2,Sun Jun 7 16:07:43 2015 UTC,"Doesn't have any less power.  It's similar to a turbo tip in that it has a rotary arm with 2 heads that spins blindingly fast, but the actual spray nozzles on the arm only have about a 1/4-1/2"" swath.  It does a remarkably better job than using a fan tip as each spot is hit several times and is the finished product has basically zero light or dark spots.    I clean the concrete and decks annually at my rentals and since discovering this thing, I get the job done in probably 25% of the time (if not less)."

powerwashingporn,37cemw,MarathonShredder,15,Fri May 29 19:48:33 2015 UTC,"Not really that good.     Despite the inherent dangers involved in the industry, it can take a while before a window washer sees a soaring salary. A window cleaner washing storefronts or homes might only earn $12 to $15 per hour, Reinhart said. But someone doing larger commercial properties, including skyscrapers, could earn $15 to $25 per hour. In New York, where the risks are presumably higher because of the dizzying heights, it’s not unheard of for veterans with all the know-how to reach $29 to $35 per hour. Getting paid top dollar, however, requires months and years of experience with equipment and certification.   http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/window-washers-defy-death-can-start-making-just-12-hour-n247936"
powerwashingporn,37cemw,SocksForBreakfast,9,Tue May 26 17:33:35 2015 UTC,Your correct..I know because I'm a window cleaner. The most I've earned an hour was 15.5 doing high end residental. However when I work for myself I can make a lot more.

powerwashingporn,37cemw,iamzombus,14,Wed May 27 05:50:16 2015 UTC,I have no knowledge or experience to assume one way or the other..  but I can't imagine why they wouldn't peel off a protective coating either while installing it or before installing it.. that seems like a massive pain and expense to have to go back and peel it off the entire building 2 years after it was completed
powerwashingporn,37cemw,SocksForBreakfast,15,Tue May 26 17:16:54 2015 UTC,Holy crap... Has it been two years already?!
powerwashingporn,37cemw,iamzombus,14,Tue May 26 19:55:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, completed May 2013.  Opened 2014"
powerwashingporn,37cemw,SocksForBreakfast,3,Tue May 26 20:23:41 2015 UTC,"Correct.  It is just grime.  The problem with removable protective coatings is that they leave residue after sitting around for more than a few months.  Also, the risk of having it peel off in high winds and dropping to the street is not acceptable.  The film sheet for a window this large will way several pounds, and the city frowns on dropping such things from great heights."
powerwashingporn,37cemw,irishjihad,3,Tue May 26 20:31:09 2015 UTC,"There are channels that are part of the curtainwall (window) system.  The gondola (platform) has ""torpedoes"" (sliders) that run inside the channels to keep the rig from coming off the building in high winds.  The rig at the top acts like a crane to move the gondola around the facade and set it into the pairs of channels.  It then pays out the cable just like a crane.  As the rig transitions from one face to the other it uses temporary torpedoes to hold it while the main ones are set into the channels on the new face.  They are just taking off grime.  There is no protective film on the windows to remove.  Buildings get very dirty in the city, especially during construction.  This is just the first cleaning of the facade."
powerwashingporn,37cemw,irishjihad,1 point,Wed May 27 16:43:05 2015 UTC,"Cool system. Glad to know they aren't just hanging from a cable out there, but attached to the building too.

powerwashingporn,37cemw,iamzombus,4,Wed May 27 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"The equipment is pretty neat.  It has a centrifugal braking system in case the hoist motor fails.  The speed of the cable drum makes a weighted cam extend and trip the brake.  I can't find a video of the ones on one of these rigs, but here is something similar.  Time flies.  I left the company at the WTC four years ago.  Hard to believe.  The idea that 9/11 was almost 14 years ago is crazy.

powerwashingporn,37cemw,SolipsistRB,9,Wed May 27 01:16:54 2015 UTC,So you do years of research just to keep it to yourself? Seems a bit silly if you're going to instigate based on what you learned. Does that really mean that you don't accept questions about your findings?
powerwashingporn,37cemw,uxjackson,3,Wed May 27 01:28:39 2015 UTC,I'm going to reply again to light your envelope again. I asked simple non-argumentative questions. I don't deserve to know what you know? Seriously. I really would love to spend years researching something.
powerwashingporn,37cemw,uxjackson,-3,Wed May 27 01:44:12 2015 UTC,"I asked simple non-argumentative questions.   You did and i appreciate that but you already said you're not willing or able to put the time in to learn so what good will it do me to try to answer them? It's not really possible to condense multiple books of multiple hundred pages, hours and hours of audio and video, many many websites etc into one short reddit post.   I don't deserve to know what you know? Seriously.   I never said this (neither did i intend to imply it). You've just come up with this idea that i think I'm somehow superior or holding some kind of knowledge that i don't want to share which is not the case at all. You do deserve to know and so does everyone else. I am nothing special, I'm just a human being like all of us and all human beings are equal. I have stood there (in the 90s) and looked up at those WTC buildings, looked at them from the top of the Empire State building and from Liberty Island, read (and watched docs) about their construction and watch live (on TV) their destruction all day that day of 9/11/01 (luckily i was off work that day) and have been facinated about them and later what happened to them ever since so my interest has led me to find out everything i can. It doesn't make me in any way superior as a person just a person who learnt stuff no different to how someone that spent years learning about golf or the history of Sweden or some other subject i know nothing about would know more than me about those subjects."

powerwashingporn,36i49x,Minion91,33,Tue May 19 15:39:57 2015 UTC,"Hi Reddit.  I'm the friend this OP mentioned, ergo the owner of this house. First of all, thank you all for the kind words!  To give some more information and address some of the questions that came up:     Where is this?  The house is located in Ghent, Belgium, in the so-called ""Heirnis"" district.      Some background on the property  The house was originally constructed in 1899. It was designed by the eclectic architect J.G. Semey - he's not that well known, although he's constructed quite a few other beautiful buildings in this city. It actually consists of 2 rather narrow civil houses, which were joined together when my parents purchased the property in the 1970's. An old picture showing the way it looked before they modfied the facade to include a wooden port (garage) and just the single front door, can be found here.  Most of the interesting bits are rather typical for late 1800's civil mansions: two assymetrical crow-stepped gables make up the roof, iron-cast decorations are inbedded in the facade, and there is a white-stone panel in the middle saying ""Sijt vrolijc tes Gheworded dach"" - an old-dutch maxim meaning ""Be happy, for daytime has come"".  The inside structure was completely overhauled by my parents in the 70's and 80's. It now consists of 5 layers (including the 4-room attic but excluding the cellar), of which the middle 3 are ""tilted"" - not sure how to explain this, but stories 1st and 3d each have 2 ""low"" (2m30) rooms situated in the back part of the house, whereas the 2nd story has 2 rooms on the front side of the house, with high (3m40) ceilings. There's a small garden in the back.     About the renovation  The ""before"" picture shown above was taken in 2012 by a team of building inspectors from our provincial ""heritage watch"" department. The guy sitting on the right is actually one of the inspectors. They made an extensive study of the building's condition shortly after my mother passed away, when I inherited the property.   Because I have a bad habit of procrastinating, it took me awhile to get started on contacting contractors, but once I did so by the end of last year, things advanced rather swiftly. Mid-Marsh, they started encasing the facade in scaffolding, and by early May, I had a brand new roof, a fully power washed facade with all renewed joints between the bricks, cleaned up decorations and newly painted woodwork on the windows & port. I'm not 100% sure on what techniques they used since I'm not an expert on this stuff, but as far as I understood, the power washing was done with a low-pressure water beam enriched with sand. They experimented with some different techniques first, but high pressure washing proved to be too aggressive (especially for the white stone ornaments) and chemical washing didn't accomplish enough when it came to cleaning off the dark grout coming from car-emissions which have tainted the facade for as long as I can remember.  The front door was replaced and painted earlier by me, which explains why it is differently colored than the windows and garage-port.Slightly unfortunate, but something that can be fixed over time.  Someone noted the repaired windows on the top. Both of the windows in the attic were replaced in 2013; the original wooden windows from the 1900's were completely worn out and could no longer be saved, so now they've become modern PVC-windows with a wood-like finish on the outside so they wouldn't ruin the whole facade. Both of the windows have stone boulders horizontally and vertically. Originally, they were both shaped like a ""celtic cross"", as you can see on the left one (which still has the original boulders). Half of the horizontal boulder of the right one had come down in the early 2000's (crushing a car underneath...woops), so we decided to replace the whole thing and reinforced all cracks in the other tablets by chemically anchoring them. The new boulders in the right window haven't been sculpted to look like the original ones, so the ""celtic cross"" on the right is (unfortunately) lost.      ""I liked the dark brick better""  To be honest, I myself was quite surprised to see how light the whole thing came out of the power washing treatment. I had known this building to be dark brown / grey / black since the day I was born, and I'll admit that this gave it a certain ""tristesse"" which I somehow learned to appreciate over time.  However, what some others noted is certainly true: cleaning the whole thing definitely shows off the original intent of the buildings' architect. Also, quite a few subtle details which had become hidden in the grout are now once again fully visible, such as the different (black) colored stones that accentuate the top of every window and door.  Most importantly, the saying on the center panel is now way more visible from the street (even though my ""after"" picture really doesn't do any justice to it), and you can't deny that a maxim as joyeous as ""Be happy, for daytime has come"" feels better suited on a light-colored facade.     So once again, thank you for showing your appreciation. If you have any more questions about the whole operation or the building itself, feel free to drop them in the thread - I'll try to answer them to the best of my abilities.     Kind regards,  Tom"

powerwashingporn,36i49x,newmayhem,3,Sun May 24 14:25:42 2015 UTC,"The architectoral style is called ""Eclecticism"", which is really a nice way of saying the architect mashed together a bunch of different styles. The architect designed a few other houses in a similar style along the ""Vlaamsekaai"" (photo's), each devoted to a classic Flemish artist with citations and busts embedded in the facade. Mine is not quite as glamourous as some of those houses, but there are certainly common elements. The quote on the center panel here seems to come from an old dutch religious song, so maybe that could be a clue about what inspired him so design this house the way he did.  The iron cast decoration looks pretty random to me, it's shaped like a heart (or maybe a leaf) with branch/flower like things surrounding it and 2 spirals sort of weirdly jumping out."

powerwashingporn,36i49x,ems187,1 point,Tue May 19 17:19:28 2015 UTC,"Nope. the grey stonework and masonry detailing suggests this is was built around 1900. Right before/around Art Nouveau. You can see some of the same elements. The ""gevelankers"" seem to subtlely spell out 1900 too. As other have mentioned, this style is indeed eclectic, meaning they took some modern (at the time) architecture and mixed it with traditional local architecture (stepped gable) you'd find in the VOC times as well."

powerwashingporn,36i49x,Ahbraham,5,Tue May 19 20:12:35 2015 UTC,"I note the repair of the window at the top level of the portion of the home at the right.  I must say, really, that when a building is cleaned up then we get a truthful look at what the building looked like when its builders first created it, and a whole lot more appreciation for the builders comes into play.  When I first saw, for example, the OLV cathedral in Antwerpen, in 1965, it wasn't much to look at, nor were any of the buildings in the area, and there was virtually no tourist activity, no vitality or vibrancy in the area.  Today, with the OLV cathedral and the majority of the buildings all washed clean, the area is again filled with vitality, perhaps even as never before.  This is also true of Dendermonde, another city I'm familiar with.  Seeing all these buildings as they once were is quite the eye opener - and mind opener."

These rolls of plastic also work well to save your plants and grass if you are using a caustic stripper to remove statin and refresh a deck.   There is 4 Mil poly specifically for lead removal. Any house that was painted before 1978 could potentially have lead based paint on it. The EPA has steep fines (upwards of twenty grand) for anyone improperly removing lead based paint.

powerwashingporn,35anq5,breakplans,3,Fri May 8 17:38:52 2015 UTC,"Ehh, I'd argue that washing this building is a pretty big waste of water. I'm not an architect or engineer, so I'm not sure about the whole structural integrity thing (interesting, and I'd like to know if this is actually the case) but it's basically similar to ""needing"" to wash your car. Sure it looks good, but a little dirt or pollen on the outside of your car isn't really affecting its running capabilities.   Rain isn't a waste of water because it is the water supply. That's the best I can do in contesting your point!  As soon as I started reading your comments I figured you were nearing a [9] or so. So thank you, I was thoroughly entertained by some of the things you said! Don't regret the comment, it's pretty hilarious.

powerwashingporn,34ts5q,teadow,7,Mon May 4 14:29:39 2015 UTC,"I will never understand the logic behind what you see here.  That lift probably costs 300-350 to rent for the day, then you have to have the trailer and ability to pull something that weighs 12,000+ pounds, which is a very expensive set up.  Then, you are paying a worker an hourly wage to meticulously pressure wash the siding of a building that just has algae growth on it.  Instead of taking 5 gallons of bleach, diluting it, and spraying it (from the ground), followed by a rinse and being done in an hour, you'd save the cost of equipment rental, gas to tow such a large piece of equipment to the job site, plus lord knows how many hours wasted on that worker.  I swear some businesses just love to throw money around."
powerwashingporn,34ts5q,IRPancake,13,Mon May 4 16:56:00 2015 UTC,Because spraying bleach up the side of the building involves spraying harmful chemicals to the planting.
powerwashingporn,34ts5q,ill_tonkso,0,Mon May 4 18:42:49 2015 UTC,"Thats why you don't spray them on the plants, odd concept, I know.  I own a pressure washing and roof cleaning business, I'm well aware what bleach can do to plants.  If you're incapable of taking the minimal steps required to protect said landscaping, then you don't deserve to be in business.  Instead, you can waste half the job's profit on completely unnecessary and inefficient cleaning practices.  edit: Downvotes?  Really?  Last year I sprayed 2058 gallons of bleach before diluting, so probably closer to ~4500 gallons, and thats before I even started keeping track of it in March.  I've purposefully sprayed it on plants to see how they react on my own landscaping, my 'dead plant' count still remains at 0.  I understand this sub is mostly DIY homeowners, but understand that some people here do this for a living and have thousands of hours logged on a pressure washer, and literally use bleach on a daily basis.    If you really want to get technical, they're not even cleaning that building.  Pressure washing will remove the visible growth but the spores will still remain behind, allowing the algae to spread again quickly.  Bleach will kill everything off, lengthening the time between cleanings.  Its like people pressure washing tile roofs then complaining when they have to have it done again in 6 months.  That business will likely not hire that company again because their costs are being reflected on their bill and it will be back to looking like that in a relatively short period of time.  There is a right way and a wrong way to do things.  This is not only the wrong way to clean this property, it's horribly inefficient and from a business standpoint, a waste of money."
powerwashingporn,34ts5q,IRPancake,2,Mon May 4 20:51:08 2015 UTC,Just because it isn't directly on them doesn't mean it doesn't end up in the soil surrounding the plants?
powerwashingporn,34ts5q,GoghGirl,3,Mon May 4 22:31:29 2015 UTC,"Actually, it doesn't.  The diluted bleach that would be required to clean that building wouldn't be enough to affect anything nearby.  I've cleaned countless buildings, houses, etc with zero negative effects to surrounding landscaping.    I forget this sub is mostly filled with DIY'ers, which is cool.  But seriously, don't try to tell someone who does it for a living that they are the ones doing it wrong."
powerwashingporn,34ts5q,IRPancake,2,Mon May 4 22:59:53 2015 UTC,"I own a wash/roof cleaning biz as well and confirm this.  A downstreamed mix of chlorine and soap will kill mold and algae without killing landscape.  It's diluted during the rinse process as well.  My post history has a few vinyl fences that I used a 50/50 mix of chlorine on and pre wet the grass and diluted again while rinsing with no harm to the plants.  If you know how to wash, you can use chlorine to work magic and render it harmless at the same time."
powerwashingporn,34ts5q,pubmech,1 point,Tue May 5 00:36:02 2015 UTC,"I remember your username actually, but may have posted under my businesses name about the 1000' of 8' tall picket fence I pressure washed probably 8 months back.  I realized immediately after that job that I could have put a drop cloth behind the fence and sprayed a diluted bleach solution on to do 99% of the work  instead of attempting to pressure wash the entire thing (and paying the help to do it).  It's all part of the process as I'm sure you know, but why work harder when you can let something else do the work for you?    You're in Tampa area IIRC?"
powerwashingporn,34ts5q,IRPancake,1 point,Tue May 5 02:18:49 2015 UTC,"We're in Lakeland, between Tampa and Orlando.  I remember you mentioning the fence.  When we have real thick algae on vinyl, we spray our roof mix on the fence (40% SH) after wetting the grass around it.  Haven't had any problems on St Augustine grass or bahia, but we keep the over spray diluted."
powerwashingporn,34ts5q,pubmech,1 point,Tue May 5 02:26:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, people don't realize the minimal amount of bleach you're using is quickly offset by a relatively small amount of water.  It takes quite a bit to actually kill off any type of landscaping, even grass."
powerwashingporn,34ts5q,IRPancake,1 point,Tue May 5 02:40:35 2015 UTC,Do you use bleach on all surfaces?
powerwashingporn,34ts5q,probably_the_worst,1 point,Tue May 5 00:34:51 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.  Especially in Florida where its extremely humid, it's the perfect climate for algae to grow.  I have a regular customer who has me clean his house at least twice a year.  The first time I just pressure washed, then I got in the habit of using bleach on most surfaces, this last time (the 4th visit) I cleaned his house it was extremely easy because I actually killed off all the algae with bleach from the last time, so much so that I knocked the price back a little.  He was happy, I was happy, and I made more per hour than usual after expenses.    That being said, I used to be extremely against bleach on concrete surfaces like driveways/sidewalks because of the risk of killing grass.  I found out that if you pressure wash quickly with a surface cleaner, even leaving streaks, followed by rinsing all the crap dirt away, followed by a weak bleach solution allowed to work for ~10 mins, you've got a very bright, clean sidewalk that everybody is happy with and the bleach doesn't run off into the grass because you rinsed it prior to the application."

powerwashingporn,34ts5q,probably_the_worst,1 point,Tue May 5 22:37:20 2015 UTC,"No problem!    Bleach is your friend (among a few other chemicals), just be careful when applying them.  I buy big plastic tarps from walmart to use as drop cloths if necessary.  Another popular thing (especially in florida) are white screen enclosures, which get nasty with algae pretty quickly.  Protect the plants and go nuts with the bleach, this allows you to not have to pressure wash and risk cutting the screen, and whatever falls off the enclosure will land on what is usually a painted deck, cleaning it without having to resort to high pressure cleaning and risking chipping the paint.  A light pressure (white/green tip) rinse after to get the stubborn parts.    This same process is used for basically any exterior surface on a home, roof edging, soffits, etc.  Any other questions feel free to PM me!"

powerwashingporn,33z5sj,lilypots,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:24:34 2015 UTC,I've always been told that power washing wood before staining creates steaks and the wood won't take a stain evenly. I'm curious if this is true so you'll have update on how it goes :)
powerwashingporn,33z5sj,lilypots,3,Mon Apr 27 03:38:42 2015 UTC,I'm going to assume you meant streaks.  My sprayer isn't very powerful and I'm trying to be careful about going with the grain of the wood and trying to get it clean with as few passes as possible.   I've had to make multiple passes in some places due to darker stains and there is some stripping occurring.  One picket in particular looks hideous. I'm going to try solving the issue with some light sanding before staining it.  I think someone with a more powerful sprayer and an oscillating wand may not have this issue.
powerwashingporn,33z5sj,senoritaoscar,2,Mon Apr 27 14:12:00 2015 UTC,Streaks....yes that's what I meant. Thank you for your answer. I have a lot of fencing that needs staining and thought power washing would be easiest but all I get is people telling me I'll regret power washing it before staining. I certainly don't want to clean it all by hand (there's waaaay too much fencing to do it all by hand) but I never wanted it to look like garbage either. I guess it can't look any worse than it does now though so I'll follow your advice and go easy on it with a power washer.
powerwashingporn,33z5sj,joshwooding,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:37:22 2015 UTC,"Here's a good video to watch on the subject. They don't mention in the video, but all the other sources I've seen says you need to wait a couple days between washing and staining to let the wood dry."
powerwashingporn,33z5sj,senoritaoscar,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:53:43 2015 UTC,thanks. That makes sense too. I had a friend who power washed her house before she painted it and now has a ton of paint peeling off. She only waited a day between washing and painting.

powerwashingporn,32ggcn,pubmech,19,Tue Apr 14 01:08:39 2015 UTC,"You can mist it enough to remove the stains without any runoff.  Pre wet the surrounding flora, mist and let it lift the stains, then rinse well and it will dilute it to harmless levels.  We spray a lot of concrete to lift oak tree stains after we wash the concrete.  Makes a huge difference.  If you let the bleach dry, it leaves salt behind which is also easily diluted.   Edit:  If you can get a contractor grade trash bag over the drain, you can catch any runoff and dispose of it.  This is what we do on gutters when we're cleaning roofs. Only reason I suggest it is because no amount of pressure will remove some stains, but chemicals will."

The pump only puts out 60 psi, at 7 gallons a minute. I kinda shoot for the shingles to be evenly coated, just to the point of runoff, but not quite there. I have a guy on the ground keeping the plants wet, and protecting the landscape from over spray. Depending on how old the roof is, and how bad the algae is, is how heavy I mix my ratios, and how many coats it will take. The mix we used for this roof was 1 part sodium hypochlorite to 3 parts water, and a good amount of Gain Original scent dishwashing liquid. Sprayed a nice, even, light coat, then let it work it's magic for about 30 minutes. When it's colder, it takes longer. Applied a second coat, and it was beautiful after that. We rinse the roof with garden hose, for the instant gratification effect.  Holy cow long post. My bad. There's a ton of info online about it, but if you have any specific questions, feel free to ask, as I'm sure I left out a plethora of information."

Little tip on the surface cleaner and smaller machines. If you edge everything first, then do overlapping circles as you clean, you can help avoid ""tiger striping"" that will happen from running the surface cleaner in a straight line. Most of the time it happens on really dirty surfaces, the first time they are cleaned. Depends on how much pressure, and how many gallons per minute. Also, if you can get a hold of some 12.5% sodium hypochlorite  (bleach) and spray a really light coat after it has been cleaned, it will help with the stripes, and keep it cleaner longer. TL;DR if you edge first with green nozzle, then do overlapping circles, it won't stripe, and look great longer. This is a driveway we were called in to eliminate striping. Was done less than 4 months ago by the homeowner, no chemical afterwards. Looked great for about a month. http://imgur.com/IReOtfZ"

powerwashingporn,30a7xm,mkraft,12,Wed Mar 25 22:19:31 2015 UTC,"Wonder the legality if on public property.    I debated doing something similar for my pressure washing company,   just washing a small 'business card' onto random bits of concrete, but was worried if there were consequences."
powerwashingporn,30a7xm,IRPancake,13,Thu Mar 26 00:53:45 2015 UTC,"It's a good idea in theory, but even if it's legal and not considered vandalism, it's extremely unprofessional, especially if you're a well established business. I could tell you, if I were in charge of a piece of public property and this happened to it, it'd probably make me end up getting it powerwashed, but I definitely wouldn't use the company that did it."
powerwashingporn,30a7xm,Jabrono,9,Thu Mar 26 02:32:32 2015 UTC,That's actually a really interesting point. I don't THINK it'd be considered vandalism since you aren't applying anything to the sidewalk or damaging it. But I could be wrong. Seems like a gray area of the law
powerwashingporn,30a7xm,thelethalpotato,2,Thu Mar 26 01:29:18 2015 UTC,"It's not legal. There was a speight of advertising here in the UK a few years ago. Night clubs, bars, etc. were the most common. Walking around the town centre and bam, some wazzock they've paid a few pounds to has plastered them anywhere there's some flat grubby ground.  You're defacing public property whether you apply something or take something away. You're also advertising in locations you're not meant to, à la fly posting."

powerwashingporn,30a7xm,87red,2,Tue Apr 7 07:42:39 2015 UTC,"It was the defence trying to argue that point, not the decision of the court. It's illegal under the Criminal Damage Act 1971, as whether you apply or remove something from the surface, you are 'marking' it and defacing it. I expect they pursued them on the point of illegal advertising because it's a much easier case and was the end result."
powerwashingporn,30a7xm,atomcrusher,1 point,Tue Apr 7 11:39:28 2015 UTC,"Well it is applying a pattern. I mean you can wash off graffiti too, the problem is having to do the work to do so. Likewise work is required to remove this, so it's really no different in that regard. I would assume it would be considered vandalism since it is altering something you don't own without permission."

powerwashingporn,2ycwyb,mstacle,3,Sun Mar 8 20:22:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I meant. like, the splits and raised edges on the wood. This area just looks like not a lot of fun to be touching."
powerwashingporn,2ycwyb,kuppajava,6,Sun Mar 8 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, should sit down a bit when dry, but you could always go at it with a belt sander and some 80 grit."
powerwashingporn,2ycwyb,StumpyMcStump,3,Sun Mar 8 20:41:01 2015 UTC,OH that's a good idea. I really want to clean up her deck this spring because I'm always scared to walk on it barefooted.
powerwashingporn,2ycwyb,mrMouseR,3,Sun Mar 8 20:43:08 2015 UTC,"If you mean the gaps between the deck boards, I'm having pretty good success getting the moss and dirt and stuff out with a fine tip.  I'm planning on getting it cleaned up and then using deck restoration paint to seal it up."
powerwashingporn,2ycwyb,StumpyMcStump,2,Sun Mar 8 20:24:23 2015 UTC,I meant this area here. How do you fill that in so you don't get splinters?
powerwashingporn,2ycwyb,kuppajava,3,Sun Mar 8 20:39:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is what I have always wondered about too with PWP shots where people cleaned up wood.    I mean, before aging the wood looked like it does after a good cleaning, but eventually it turned into the before picture.  What is the next step to keep it looking good for a long time?    I would love to see a shot like this, then a shot of what it looks like when it dries, then sanded down, then with finishing products so you can know it is going to look good for a long time!"
powerwashingporn,2ycwyb,mrMouseR,3,Sun Mar 8 21:35:22 2015 UTC,A good solid stain holds it together pretty well
powerwashingporn,2ycwyb,E1M8S4K8F,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:49:14 2015 UTC,"You'd also need to seal this since its outdoor. Stain would make it look nice, sealing would make it last."

powerwashingporn,2ycwyb,StumpyMcStump,3,Mon Mar 9 05:45:00 2015 UTC,"For one, OP shouldn't be using such a high power nozzle and/or have the nozzle so close to the wood. You want to remove all the shit from the wood, you don't want to start tearing up and splintering the wood itself. Sure, OP's picture looks nice, but by next year it is going to be the same thing unless he spends time sealing it, and even then, if he continues to powerwash like he currently does, the life of the deck is going to be significantly reduced."
powerwashingporn,2ycwyb,WVFTW,2,Mon Mar 9 10:47:25 2015 UTC,They actually sell products for this such as Deckover. Once you reach a certain point though you will be better off just replacing the wood. Had to put new hand railings on my deck last summer and the railings looked very similar to as pictured.

powerwashingporn,2xqqpd,Kulos15,9,Tue Mar 3 03:09:52 2015 UTC,do you professionally powerwash?
powerwashingporn,2xqqpd,Motha_Effin_Kitty_Yo,12,Tue Mar 3 04:06:39 2015 UTC,"Yes!  Although it seems most of my business is roof cleaning, which I do chemically without any pressure.  I'm slowly branching off into doing commercial jobs, and my goal is to have contracts for a steady income.  Also looking into commercial kitchen exhaust vent cleaning in the future as well.  edit: My setup"
powerwashingporn,2xqqpd,Motha_Effin_Kitty_Yo,12,Tue Mar 3 05:31:51 2015 UTC,Can you tell us more about it? We see so many pictures here but I always wish that there were more discussions!    How did you get into the business? Favorite thing to powerwash? Can surfaces/driveways be damaged if an inexperienced person powerwashes?  Independent or through a company? if i may how much do you charge? Is it per foot? What surface is most often washed?
powerwashingporn,2xqqpd,Motha_Effin_Kitty_Yo,18,Tue Mar 3 05:35:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, I don't mind sharing my story!   I worked as a firefighter for 3 years in the area's largest department.  Don't let anybody fool you, their pay sucks.  One day I borrowed my dads pressure washer, did my driveway, and enjoyed it.  Then I got the crazy idea to buy a old Verizon fleet van, a pressure washer and misc equipment, and make some money on the side.  Long story short, I left the FD (for many reasons, not because of money), upgraded to that trailer (Trailer (in case you missed the edit), signed up for Angie's List and became extremely active on it.  The way they run their ""Super Service Award"", I was only on there for 7 months for their ""year"", and still won the award in both roof cleaning and pressure washing, which is only given to the top 5% of businesses in each category.  (Sorry, but I'll toot my own horn a little on that one!).   I don't pressure wash them, but I love cleaning roofs.  I've always been comfortable with heights, and its satisfying watching them come clean, it totally changes the appearance of a house.  If I had to pick my favorite thing to pressure wash though, it'd be regular old driveways, the surface cleaner is easy to use, with satisfying results. Regular old concrete can't unless you have a ridiculously powerful machine.  Mine is 7gpm 4000psi, and I could probably break concrete up with the 0* nozzle.  With a surface cleaner, the pressure is divided between 2 nozzles so its not as bad.  Anything that is painted can easily be damaged, especially if paint is old or on a rotting surface, which I've run into multiple times.  Customers are usually pretty understanding in those situations, as its usually their fault for not keeping up with their house. Independent.  I registered the company as an LLC middle of last year, I pay myself a paycheck and keep everything separate.  I'm proud to say I do it legitimate, because a lot of businesses around me sneak around and do things that will most likely catch up with them, its not worth the risk IMO.   edit: Prices are based on square footage, yes.  I programmed an excel spreadsheet where I can input the square footage of a house, roof, screen enclosure, ground surface, with various options, and it will figure out the price.  The price also varies, as the square footage goes up, price per square foot gets slightly cheaper, excel figures out the difference and adjusts the price per square foot automatically, which makes giving estimates over the phone quick and easy."
powerwashingporn,2xqqpd,Motha_Effin_Kitty_Yo,5,Tue Mar 3 05:45:29 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thats quite the rig, is the tank filled with water or a water/chemical mix? If water, how long does it last/where do you refill?   . Those surface cleaners? that you have in the picture look huge, how long does it take to do a typical driveway? Do you normally have to take multiple passes over the surface or can those do it in just one? Congrats! I assume that means you must live in a fair weather state for the constant business?"
powerwashingporn,2xqqpd,scdayo,10,Tue Mar 3 05:52:32 2015 UTC,"Since I didn't get my edit in in time:  Prices are based on square footage, yes. I programmed an excel spreadsheet where I can input the square footage of a house, roof, screen enclosure, ground surface, with various options, and it will figure out the price. The price also varies, as the square footage goes up, price per square foot gets slightly cheaper, excel figures out the difference and adjusts the price per square foot automatically, which makes giving estimates over the phone quick and easy.   That's just for water, there's a hose on the bottom that feeds the pump directly.  It all depends on if I'm using a surface cleaner versus gun, which nozzles, if I'm constantly spraying or just spot cleaning, etc.  It's a 525 gallon tank, and I'll use about 150 for a standard 2 car driveway/sidewalk, on average.  For residential jobs, I just use the customers water, since its not a massive amount, most people don't care and are under the assumption I'd be using theirs.  If it becomes an issue (which it hasn't yet!), I'd offer a $5-$10 discount, depending on how much I used.  If I'm doing a commercial job or a special situation where I can't use their water, I'll just fill up at home.  Might eventually look into filling from hydrants (which I'm very familiar with!) but that requires paperwork and approving from my understanding, it's not that important to me at this point. . They are 20"", and a regular driveway takes about 30 minutes including setting up and breaking down, they're quick!  I've recently adopted the technique of applying a light bleach solution after pressure washing, to avoid runoff into the grass.  This gets rid of any streaks left over by the surface cleaner, and gets rid of that little bit extra pressure washing alone can't get. I wish!  Florida gets unexpected rain storms, which can come out of nowhere and really screw up my day.  During the summer I was rescheduling jobs left and right, but I'm prepared for that this year but building in a 'make up' day into my schedule, hopefully it doesn't rain on that day either!   edit: I guess I should say yes, I have the ability to work outside year round, which is nice.  I can pressure wash in the rain (its just miserable), but I can't clean roofs, so I prefer a nice, maybe cloudy, windless day."
powerwashingporn,2xqqpd,SongAboutYourPost,7,Tue Mar 3 05:59:53 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, so the tank is just sorta a backup in case needed? Are sidewalks city owned or does the landowner control them? (If city, do they mind that you wash them?) Yeah, I can see how using hydrants would be an issue even as a firefighter, especially if a fire broke out and for liabilities. .  Runoff of what in particular to the grass? What chemicals do you typically use when washing or is it just straight water?  Haha, you would think the rain would only assist you...Is it because of the fear of lightning or because it would get the bleach/chemicals wet?"
powerwashingporn,2xqqpd,breticles,9,Tue Mar 3 06:08:34 2015 UTC,"Well, the pump is fed from the tank, so I just throw the hose up into the top and let it fill.  Sidewalks aren't technically the responsibility of the owner, but nobody else is going to clean them.  I've never heard of an issue arising from that so I'm not worried.  The hydrant is more to make sure the city knows who is taking their water and getting compensated for it.  Even though part of my job as a firefighter was opening them up to flush them out and wasting probably thousands of gallons at a time, they'll want their cut from me taking a couple hundred.   . I don't run any chemicals through my pressure washer, I have a separate tank in the back of my van with an electric pump designed to handle them.  Good old fashioned bleach is the best thing...ever.  Bleach will inevitably kill grass if it runs off, even if heavily diluted. It's also a bit problem when cleaning roofs if there aren't gutters to protect landscaping, I cover everything with big plastic sheets. When doing roofs its because it's only using bleach, and it would get diluted and run off the roof before it could work.  The results when cleaning roofs is almost instant, within a few minutes, but once the roof is wet and its even sprinkling, I can't do anymore.  Most of the time we just have showers, if it starts storming though I'm not risking that either, and I'll call it for the day or reschedule if I haven't started yet."
powerwashingporn,2xqqpd,SongAboutYourPost,3,Tue Mar 3 06:19:27 2015 UTC,I feel like Angies list is such a scam in that both the professional who wants to be found AND the consumer looking for a professional need to pay to use the service.
powerwashingporn,2xqqpd,frabax,3,Tue Mar 3 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"Without Angie's List, I wouldn't have a business, nor would many other people.  For consumers, it costs ~$10/month from my understanding, but it gives you access to a very established community of professionals with reviews to back up their service.  It almost guarantees that you will get good service because that person/business knows that their reputation can be hurt if they don't do a good job.  At the business end, you can be on Angie's List for free, and though you won't be 'featured' or the first to show up, you can still establish a review base.  I pay to advertise in 2 categories, on web, call center, and have a 2/3 page ad in their magazine, and it costs $865/month, BUT, that gives me enough exposure to make anywhere from 4-8k a month.  Advertising is a necessary evil for businesses.  Compare that to other advertising options, such as my local business magazine that comes by once a month, which is black and white, almost 500/month for a similar sized ad, with no website profile (which is the majority of my exposure), or reviews to show that I'm better than XYZ company, PLUS there are usually at least a dozen other pressure washers listed.  When you compare that to Angie's List members who are active in taking care of their home, willing to pay to do so, and care about reviews, it makes me stick out and often times wins me a bid between multiple businesses.    Honestly, I was hesitant at first, even to advertise in one category just on the website, which was $219.  That next day I booked my first 'big' job, which was a gorgeous 1920's Spanish styled home, instantly returning $600, my mindset was that's 3 months of advertising for free, the rest is gravy.  It's opened the door to individual jobs upwards of $2000, and has introduced me to a couple realtors who have thrown me quite a bit of work, as well as commercial jobs.  It's a great resource to establish a business, and if it keeps returning its investment so well, I'll continue to use it even as word of mouth increases."

powerwashingporn,2wtx5n,SirCrest_YT,90,Mon Feb 23 04:45:46 2015 UTC,"They remove it because it makes the touchdown surface incredibly slick in wet conditions. The rubber can build up into layers over 1/2"" thick. So thick it fills the grooves milled into the pavement that provide traction and drainage. Also after many thousand's of landings it obscures the touchdown and center line paint markings which help the pilots line up the planes for landings."

powerwashingporn,2wtx5n,Source_Australian,5,Mon Feb 23 16:14:44 2015 UTC,A few guesses: rubber is sticky/viscious in the heat. Extra rubber can cause undue wear on the tires of the plane. The runway can become uneven.

powerwashingporn,2wtx5n,Cryogenicist,18,Mon Feb 23 03:28:38 2015 UTC,Not a clue actually. I was out there for an inspection of the lights and they happened to be doing rubber removal at the same time.
powerwashingporn,2wtx5n,grnrngr,10,Mon Feb 23 03:44:48 2015 UTC,How often do they do this rubber removal?
powerwashingporn,2wtx5n,Juz16,20,Mon Feb 23 04:34:46 2015 UTC,It's very dependent on the conditions and how often the runway is used. There is an allowance for the surface conditions of the pavement. Every so often they will go out and do a grip/friction test. if the surface is slicker than allowed they will schedule removal. It's usually many months between removals because it's not cheap. That picture in particular i believe is somewhere around 2 years since the last major removal.   High pressure removal not only tales the rubber off but it removes the paint stripes on the pavement and destroys the joint sealant between the gaps in the concrete pavement sections. That gets expensive to replace plus sometimes it can be hard scheduling a shut down of a runaways for extended periods at major airports.
powerwashingporn,2wtx5n,usnavyedub,4,Mon Feb 23 05:23:21 2015 UTC,So wait is this just rubber off of the tires on planes or is it something that the airport purposely put down?
powerwashingporn,2wtx5n,usnavyedub,14,Mon Feb 23 07:47:30 2015 UTC,"rubber off the tire they go from not moving to what ever the landing speed of plane is in a second, if you ever see one land its the smoke that comes off the tires"
powerwashingporn,2wtx5n,rd757,7,Mon Feb 23 08:12:23 2015 UTC,I always wondered if it would end up saving them money if they had a motor spin the wheels up to approximate speed ground speed before touchdown.
powerwashingporn,2wtx5n,usnavyedub,3,Mon Feb 23 16:17:19 2015 UTC,"I would think that if one of the motors was not rotating properly, it might introduce an undesired force upon landing, one that can be avoided by just not having the motor.  Otherwise, if they can overcome that, it's a solid enough idea."

powerwashingporn,2wtx5n,kiwimark,3,Mon Feb 23 11:00:48 2015 UTC,This makes me wonder if they can't invent some way of spinning the plane tires to match touchdown speed.  Like vanes on the side of the tires like the wind speed things on a weather station.

powerwashingporn,2wtx5n,willbradley,2,Fri Mar 20 22:08:17 2015 UTC,"But I'm talking about the opposite.  When you touchdown the tires are turning 0 mph, and the ground is moving by at 100+mph  The idea would be to touch down with spinning tires instead of stationary tires."

powerwashingporn,2vogmj,Chalureel,31,Thu Feb 12 20:16:04 2015 UTC,You don't want to haha. It's messy as hell and dangerous. I'm wearing fresh air in this pic and rain gear. It was almost 100 degrees that day and there's no shade on top of a roof. It's definitely cool having all that power in your hands but it sucks after a while.
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,TortureSteak,5,Thu Feb 12 20:31:53 2015 UTC,is the pay at least decent?
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,TortureSteak,12,Thu Feb 12 22:43:34 2015 UTC,Not for what we do. It's not the worst though.

powerwashingporn,2vogmj,captainwelch,7,Thu Feb 12 23:56:31 2015 UTC,We do a lot of pressure washing too and it might seem easy to some people but it really is no joke. I think it hurts my back worse than high pressure stuff
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,IRPancake,2,Fri Feb 13 00:34:29 2015 UTC,"This process is a lot different than typical pressure washing from the looks of it.  I started my own pressure washing business a couple years ago, which has been great, but this looks like much more expensive equipment/insurance/training requirements/etc."
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,IRPancake,4,Fri Feb 13 03:29:02 2015 UTC,EVERYTHING is expensive in blasting. The pumps run from 200-500k. You can throw away thousands in seconds running them wrong
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,BurninatorJT,3,Fri Feb 13 03:37:25 2015 UTC,Holy hell!  It makes sense though considering that power required to do what they're intended to do.  I'll stick with my dinky 7gpm 4000 psi pressure washer :P
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,BurninatorJT,38,Fri Feb 13 03:39:56 2015 UTC,Whoa. Are you leaning into it to counteract the force of the spray pushing you back?
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,IRPancake,45,Thu Feb 12 19:46:57 2015 UTC,Yup! You can either try and muscle it or just use body weight. The body weight method is a little easier when you have to do it for 10+ hours a day.
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,SuperConfused,9,Thu Feb 12 20:28:29 2015 UTC,"Here's a stupid question, why not create a form of surface cleaner?"
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,IRPancake,19,Fri Feb 13 00:57:39 2015 UTC,Mostly because I'm not an inventor haha. They use chemicals and stuff to help break it down but you can't run stuff like that through these pumps because it will mess up the valves. We run it through a regular pressure washer on the final wash once the bulk is off though.
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,joecooool418,2,Fri Feb 13 01:04:53 2015 UTC,You'd be surprised how easily you could probably come up with something to take the strain off you and make your life a lot easier.   Do you apply the chemical with a separate system?
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,IRPancake,5,Fri Feb 13 01:26:34 2015 UTC,Well a lot of companies (including mine) are going to automated equipment. Which will basically get us away from the dangerous stuff and on our asses with a remote control. If you're curious look up automated hydroblasting. I'd link but I'm on mobile and I suck at reddit. Well just like any other pressure washer there's just place to put soaps/detergents. Honestly we mostly just use simple green and even dawn dish soap.  Edit: not sure if that's exactly what you were asking about using the chemicals or if you meant to ask if it's a whole different machine. Which it is. If someone could tell me how to put pics in comments on mobile I'd show you what the hydroblast pump looks like.
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,joecooool418,5,Fri Feb 13 01:34:05 2015 UTC,I find the technology with this stuff really cool. Have you ever used a 3D nozzle? Just ran one today with a high volume 15K to do the inside of a massive vessel in a morning. Most of the work now is rigging in.  Here's a 36K pump for the curious.
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,IRPancake,8,Fri Feb 13 03:26:04 2015 UTC,Yup we use hurricane 3d's I love em. Definitely better than crawling your ass in that vessel and shot gunning it
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,joecooool418,8,Fri Feb 13 03:34:35 2015 UTC,It's awesome. We have the same ones. Are you using a baracuda nozzle in your picture?
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,IRPancake,8,Fri Feb 13 03:36:32 2015 UTC,You know your blasting equipment!
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,varukasalt,1 point,Fri Feb 13 05:27:26 2015 UTC,"I was more asking how you apply the chemicals if you dont use the pump, unless it is a downstream system like a lot of pressure washers use.  I personally like to use a whole separate system so I don't have any chemical in the lines, but this seems to be the only thing you guys do so it wouldn't matter much I imagine.    The automated equipment sounds great, I'm all for reducing stress on workers, especially knowing how rough it is just using a standard pressure washer for hours at a time can be.  I'm sure many of us would love to see more about what you do, but I can't be of any help when it comes to the mobile stuff, I attempt not to let this site suck my life away when I'm not at home"
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,specofdust,1 point,Fri Feb 13 03:24:14 2015 UTC,Oh I see. Yeah we don't really apply chemicals if we aren't washing. But hydroblasting or Chem cleaning seems to be the biggest ways to do this stuff so far. Usually chem cleaning or acid washing as we call it is for internals more than externals though.  Yeah I absolutely love automated stuff. We flex lance as well and we recently started using automated tools for that. Let me tell you. Sitting in a heated cab and stabbing 5 tubes at once is so much better than getting soaked in the snow one tube at a time for 1000 tubes

powerwashingporn,2vogmj,themach5,2,Fri Feb 13 15:55:52 2015 UTC,Well I'll put it this way. I made just over 40k last year with a TON of overtime. 90 hours a week on some.
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,brawr,2,Fri Feb 13 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"Landa Waterjet, it's the best surface cleaner on the market."

powerwashingporn,2vogmj,STINKO_DE_MAYO,2,Fri Feb 13 15:54:33 2015 UTC,There is simply no comparison. The Landa unit is better in every conceivable way.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKzLnLsa_aQ
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,BP_Ray,2,Fri Feb 13 16:02:32 2015 UTC,"Except price, and looks, and from the looks of it, quality."
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,ifartmeat,2,Fri Feb 13 16:44:22 2015 UTC,That's a 15 year old unit you are looking at.   Still works.
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,say_fuck_no_to_rules,2,Fri Feb 13 17:01:23 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to be argumentative, but how often was it used in those 15 years?  Every day?  Once a month?  Couple times a year?  That, and maintaining equipment goes a long way for longevity too.  I still just don't see the justification in spending 6 times the price for something that does literally the same exact thing (minus 2 inches) as the General Pump surface cleaner."
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,TortureSteak,7,Fri Feb 13 22:07:24 2015 UTC,Yeah even a 4000 psi will give you enough pressure to lean against.
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,OpheliaPotts,1 point,Thu Feb 12 19:50:31 2015 UTC,Even? You ever seen what a few hundred PSI behind some steel can do? 4000 PSI is not exactly low pressure.
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,thtgyovrthr,18,Fri Feb 13 01:26:22 2015 UTC,"You're right, but honestly pressure doesn't have much to do with the amount of force it puts back on you. We run 40k pumps as well and they are way easier to hold than a 10k. That's because the 40k uses a lot less water. The more flow you have, the harder it is to hold. Most fire hoses are around 150-250 psi but they'll knock you on your ass."
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,varukasalt,4,Fri Feb 13 01:46:32 2015 UTC,"Damn, I am learning some interesting shit today."
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,varukasalt,2,Fri Feb 13 07:50:25 2015 UTC,"Thats what a lot of pressure washers, even professionals don't understand.  GPM > PSI.  Former firefighter as well, and a 3"" line will knock you on your ass at half the PSI, but it flows 4x as much as a 1 3/4"".  I think a lot of people use the wrong nozzle for their setup as well, you can get a lot more flow from the right sized nozzle"
powerwashingporn,2vogmj,aamanderp,1 point,Fri Feb 13 22:02:49 2015 UTC,"Pressure equals force divided by the area it exits though, no?"

powerwashingporn,2vogmj,BurninatorJT,1 point,Mon Mar 2 06:58:33 2015 UTC,"Force = mass * acceleration.   Water coming out of a fire hose may be moving at a slower speed, but there's so much of it that the total force put into the ground is higher than the 40k (very high speed, but low GPM).   Combined with one of Newton's laws (for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction), the hose is pushing back on you with the same amount of force. Like you said, a fire hose will knock you on your ass.   Hopefully this makes sense, it's been a while since I used Physics for anything but snarky comments on reddit"

powerwashingporn,2t88ht,dubbin64,7,Thu Jan 22 12:30:38 2015 UTC,Yeah it works well.  Make sure you don't spray it from the bottom as it could separate the rug in places. Spray the top and let it run off.

powerwashingporn,2sajrw,sabian92,17,Tue Jan 13 16:19:42 2015 UTC,"Looks good!  Don't waste your money on a 'pet friendly algae killer'.  As soon as it rains whatever chemical will be rinsed right off, and the algae will return as it would without it.  Not to mention algae is a living organism, to my knowledge theres nothing that would be truly pet safe that would also kill off the algae.    Next time if you don't feel like pressure washing the whole thing, mix up a weak bleach solution and let it sit on the surface for a few minutes, then rinse with a garden hose.  As long as the animals don't go out immediately after they'll be fine as it'll be absorbed into the ground"
powerwashingporn,2sajrw,IRPancake,5,Tue Jan 13 19:43:58 2015 UTC,"I thought it might wash away but for £7.99 off Amazon (probably around $12 if you're US based) it's hardly a huge loss if it doesn't work.  I thought about bleach but I thought it'd run down the garden and kill the grass. It's not my house so I didn't want to be responsible for laying their garden again with grass!  To be honest pressure washing it isn't a major deal, it'd probably take me 3 hours to do both of the patios so 3 hours every 6 months or so isn't a big deal. UK houses have far smaller gardens than US houses so it's actually not a bad job. Cold though, it was -1C/30F!"
powerwashingporn,2sajrw,pubmech,4,Tue Jan 13 23:23:23 2015 UTC,"Wet the grass before hand and you'll have no issues.  The water from washing more than dilutes it afterwards as well.  We use bleach on hundreds of houses and thousands of sq ft of concrete with no plant problems.  Chlorine bleach is the only thing that kills algae and keeps it from returning as quickly as ""eco"" products."
powerwashingporn,2sajrw,IRPancake,1 point,Wed Jan 14 03:11:58 2015 UTC,"True, but a gallon (assumed) won't cover much area unless its a concentrate, and even then those usually don't make that much.  Your time is what you value it at though, and if you like pressure washing, more power to you.  Diluted bleach wont kill grass unless you pour it on and rinse it thoroughly."
powerwashingporn,2sajrw,nearcatch,2,Wed Jan 14 03:44:13 2015 UTC,Any algae killer that attacks algal-specific proteins will be pet safe. There's a reason why when you take antibiotics you don't die along with the bacteria in your body.
powerwashingporn,2sajrw,IRPancake,6,Wed Jan 14 01:28:52 2015 UTC,"Sounds like expensive chemicals.  OP stated it was ~$12 US for probably a gallon, where bleach can be had for ~$2/gal.    edit: as a professional roof cleaner, I often times come behind (har) people that want to DIY and get the 'eco friendly' chemicals.  Know why they call me?  Because they don't work effectively."
powerwashingporn,2sajrw,balkenbrij,5,Wed Jan 14 03:41:34 2015 UTC,"i wonder, don't you have to resand (ot how do you call that) them when you do this? I once did my patio and all the tiles were getting loose so i had to spent another weekend refitting/sanding them again.  e: i also put on cleaning vinegar to keep the green away from it. Not sure if that's pet or garden friendly alhough the smell keeps them away from it and my garden is still doing fine."
powerwashingporn,2sajrw,balkenbrij,2,Tue Jan 13 21:11:48 2015 UTC,"I read about that too but I did try to avoid the gaps between the slabs. Worst comes to worst though, I can buy some and sand them again.  I'll try vinegar, thanks!"
powerwashingporn,2sajrw,hannibalateam,1 point,Tue Jan 13 23:24:33 2015 UTC,"it never harms, i wasn't aiming to shoot out all the sand and weeds either but it did move enough. The vinegar works quite well to keep it clean, i put it in a hand sprayer like this  e: you might want to keep it away from the grass though btw  I sprayed it in the summer when weeds began to show and rainfall was minimum so most gets soaked up between the tiles. I have a bush just besides it which handles it well but i don't know how grass wil work out, it tends to be sensitive."

I get on tile roofs to clean them as well, but I don't have to walk nearly as much on them to spray the bleach solution onto it, which makes it much safer.  That also reduces the risk of breaking a tile, and since there is no pressure, there is no risk of it getting up underneath the tiles and/or causing leaks.    Another thing people don't realize is you are not killing the spores that cause this discoloration by pressure washing.  They are still there, very much alive, which is why even your 'clean' areas are blotched and uneven, those darker spots are where algae/mold is still living, and it will spread quicker than if you exterminated everything with bleach, which is the proper and recommended way to clean a roof.    Not to mention on top of being unsafe for you, dangerous to the roof itself, and ineffective at completely removing the problem, pressure washing a roof would take an eternity compared to a chemical cleaning, which time = money as a business.  A <4000 sq ft house would take as little as an hour and a half roughly, using maybe ~$50 in bleach, and thats working alone, factoring in time to cover up landscaping too.     Just my $.02.  I still see so many people pressure washing tile roofs, it honestly scares me from a business and safety standpoint.  I just hope they have good insurance.    Sorry if this post came off sounding like an ass, that wasn't my intention."

powerwashingporn,2pbils,pubmech,4,Mon Dec 15 17:09:49 2014 UTC,"Spraying bleach on the roof will get it cleaner than this.  I don't walk away from a job or collect payment until the roof is completely clean and consistently even throughout.  Theres no benefit to pressure washing a roof and then following it with bleach, when bleach will do the work for you."
powerwashingporn,2pbils,grammo,3,Mon Dec 15 17:16:38 2014 UTC,"OP: Better yet, hire a pro roof cleaning company to clean it with zero pressure.  Will save you a lot of headache.  (My company does pressure washing and zero-pressure roof cleaning)"

powerwashingporn,2pbils,jaynasty97,3,Mon Dec 15 18:24:28 2014 UTC,"Don't waste your time with a backpack sprayer, you'll be out there for a week straight.  Go to Northern Tool if you have one nearby and buy a little chemical pump (2.2 gpm or more, probably around $100, make sure it has viton seals and santoprene diaphram), they usually have good specials and always have coupons floating around, just ask an employee.  Also pick up a spray gun from there, get the one with the 3/8 brass barb and metal wand instead of the all plastic junk one they have - $20.  Then go to craigslist and find yourself a plastic 55 gal drum for $20 bucks.  Buying hose online is cheaper than lowes/HD, get yourself 50-100 feet of 3/8"" tubing, if I had to guess would be about $100.  Depending how cheap you want to go, you can move the barrel around with a furniture dolly and borrow a battery from your car to temporarily power the pump (I run a 7gpm 100psi pump from my van's battery for over 2 hours without issue, so I wouldn't worry about it draining it too much unless its really old).    As far as buying the bleach, that'll be the biggest hurdle since you'll either have to transfer it from 2.5 gal chlorine jugs one at a time, or buying individual gallons of it.  I buy it in bulk from a pool supply place (for $.99/gal) but you have to register as a business with them, though it might be different in your area and their policies.    The first time around it'll probably cost about as much as it does to have someone come do it, but then you have all the equipment for the next time.  Just make sure you flush out the pump with water and you should be set for years to come.  Sorry about the roof leak :("

powerwashingporn,2p5gsw,chaeg,6,Sat Dec 13 06:02:58 2014 UTC,When I saw this I had to do a double take. I was actually here when the guy was washing it (not my house). A sealer was actually put over it after the driveway dried. It's this way for good. Or until they strip the sealer off and rewash it the right way.
