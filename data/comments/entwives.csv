We have it with children, animals, things in nature, co-workers, anyone or thing we end up caring for. True peace is when you find a way to be so happy for them to leave even if your heart is breaking, think of a mother seeing her son off to college or a momma animal who must kick her child out of her protection because it is the only way he will thrive in the world.

entwives,3dzlxn,melisseph,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:21 2015 UTC,"Blunts are rolled with cigarillo/swisher wraps (brown colored tobacco) versus joints that are rolled with papers (white/variety of colors). Smoke from blunts are generally harsher because of the tobacco flavor, but since the wrap is thicker than opposed to joints, they burn slower, making the weed last longer. Blunts/joints are great--super convenient for on-the-go purposes and easy to dispose of when finished. Although they require more weed and the smoke is harsher compared to from smoking out of a piece, it's often popular within large groups since it stays lit and makes the sesh go by more efficiently. Also! You can learn to do smoke tricks with them!? Personally, I stick with bowls as my typical daily method just because I don't have a lot of money to blow on trees, and leave joints/blunts for when I have a reason to celebrate or I'm just with a group of friends who all want to pitch in on one. I used to think rolling was unnecessary when I was first introduced to trees, but after a couple years as an ent, I've come to really appreciate it!"

I think if you're just real with them, it won't be an issue. You could say something like ""I'm going to pick up trees, if you guys want to smoke did you want to throw in and we can get some extra so we can all enjoy it?

I used to have terrible acne as a young teen & never felt comfortable with no makeup on but I realized baked last week how much my skin has improved over the years & how much I've grown into myself which has really boosted my confidence.

(And he has a sexy muscle car, which doesn't really matter, but it's certainly nice).  Did I mention that his favorite day is Halloween?  Did I mention that my birthday is Halloween.  When he was little, he wanted to be Frankenstein when he grew up.  He practically melted when I showed him a picture of me as The Bride of Frankenstein from last Halloween.  He texted my best friend a video of our date to tell her that he thought the date was going really well, and that he thought I looked beautiful when I was blushing.  We have like, a billion things in common, and we talked for hours, and have spent all day today texting, oh, and did I mention that we made out in an alley way?  Because that happened.

entwives,3d5btm,fatbirdturd,3,Mon Jul 13 23:41:26 2015 UTC,"We just started collecting seeds out of our nugs. We had 5 seeds and put them in their own pot with regular soil. We watered them and covered them with saran wrap to keep the humidity high.    Once they sprouted (took a couple days) we took the plastic wrap off. We are using CFL bulbs and they're getting 18 hours of light right now.  Our main mistake was having the lights too far when they were small. Put that light right on top of them, don't give them a chance to stretch and you'll be golden.    The rest of our issues stemmed from their stretching. We lost 3 of our seedlings to my dang rats and the 2 we have now were dug up but they look awesome now. We just re-potted them into 5 gallon buckets and they are FINALLY able to stand on their own. I had a fan blowing on them regularly to strengthen the stems but re-potting them deeper is what seemed to help.    We haven't been using any nutrients. I think we're going to take issues as they come. We've had low expectations this whole time so we're happy with how its going."

entwives,3d5btm,garbagedigits,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:20:21 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily true. More than likely the seeds are from a hermaphrodite plant which typically happens when a plant has been stressed. Cannabis plants are dioecious meaning there are male & female plants. Female of course is what produces the most potent cannabis. If no male plant is present to pollinate the female & the female is stressed by improper care it can produce male flowers during the flowering phase & self pollinate. Instead of continuing to produce more resin in an attempt to attract pollen, the plant now puts its energy into producing seeds. That's why on occasion you may get a bag with a few seeds in it.  These seeds are unfortunately not desirable since they are very likely to do the exact same thing in the later stages of flowering.   I've been growing cannabis legally for almost 3 years but have been a gardener for about 30 years. I only use seeds in my grows or I make my own clones. The problem with clones from outside sources is that they may be infested with insects or disease. I order my seeds online both from the Netherlands & UK & have never had a problem.   I recommend getting a good growers guide. There are hundreds to choose from. If you need help pm me & I'll do what I can to help you! Also get a fan on all those plants ASAP. It should be on low & be an oscillating fan. Just enough breeze to move them slightly. That builds strong stems & in a deterrent against insects. Peace."

entwives,3d37c8,tculli,3,Mon Jul 13 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know about anyone else, and I'm far from an expert. I don't even have kids. But personally, I've always valued the idea of two loving parents, regardless of the situation, over two angry or resentful parents. I've given this advice to many a friend in a failing marriage with children. I feel it's more important to instill support and love for the child and being a strong role model yourself. The pretense of marriage is overrated. A child doesn't need a marriage growing up. They need love and support and people to show the child to do what makes you happiest.   If it's any consolation, my mother and father separated around my first birthday and divorced when I was 2; my mom got full custody. She came out as gay shortly thereafter, had met a partner, and introduced her to us after a while and we eventually moved in the following year. My first memory is walking into her partner's house. That said, I grew up in a nontraditional household. It was the 90s and early 2000s (I'm 23), so people were becoming more open but it was still very tense. I personally never knew it was considered ""wrong."" growing up with two moms was totally normal to me. It wasn't until I grew older that I realized others judged us, but by that point, I was beginning to understand a lot and knew those that judged us were in the wrong. I knew my parents loved me, and gave me a good home, and weren't the fuckups everyone expected lesbian parents to be. And that's what was important to me. Years later, they divorced (when I was 19), but had troubles for years. I would have preferred if my mom had ended it earlier to achieve her own happiness than try to force it to work to be parents together. I didn't need married parents. I needed strong individual parents that could teach me to look out for myself and seek happiness.   Maybe your situation is too different to compare, but I like to think it would happen with your child as well. I think he or she wouldn't notice that it wasn't the traditional setting until they were older, and by that point, they're old enough to understand what it means. Most people would assume the parents are divorced but friendly, unless told otherwise. So there should be little to no trauma-inducing reaction. So personally I think you're fine!   Plenty of couples have had casual, sexual, non romantic relationships and gotten pregnant and decided to both raise the child. Some try dating to fit the traditional parent role, and it doesn't work out. Some decide to never date but raise the child regardless. I'm sure their children didn't turn out to be serial killers or anything.   Anyway, I'm not a professional by any means but I thought maybe this little testimony might help. Good luck!   Tl;dr: I think it'll be fine, and good luck :)"

My point was that its very hard to raise a child on your own in the sense that they may not be living under the same roof and she will be soley responsible for the care of said child when the child is in her custody, same deal with the father. Although you grew up in what you call a nontraditional household, it sounds to me that your mother had support. A spouse, another adult present to lean on and influence the children in whatever way the family feels is right. Whatever your non bio mothers role in your life was/is i dont know know, but no matter how involved, its very different to have another adult present."

entwives,3d37c8,igardenalot,2,Tue Jul 14 19:37:54 2015 UTC,"oh marriage schmarriage, thats what i say about that. Its kind of important to me now that i have the two children because my SO, their dad, is the breadwinner and if anything happened to him, I'd be screwed. Not being married throws a whole nother slew of legalities into the situation. Like, my name is not on the bank account even though i have access to it. What would i do?? i dont know. The lease for the house is iin his name, so where woud that leave us if something were to happen, you know? So youve got to think of that aspect as well, which i never even thought of before the kids came along and SO got a new job, a real job i guess haha, and had to fill out life insurance and next of kin paperwork.    Consistency and support is key imo. My dad was absent from my life. Parents split when i was two, didnt see him for years, until my mom took him to court for child support, he wanted visitation, do you think he visited with us?? a few times, then left us waiting at the end of my grandmothers driveway for hours with our overnight bags until my mom came from home work and we realized he wasnt coming. My /nana, his mother, was a very important part of my life growing up and was the only consistent connection to that side of the family i had.   i think that having mutual respect for eachother's personalities, differences and over all as human beings, being able to be supportive of eachother as well as eachothers parenting styles is very important. And consistency, consistency, consistency."

entwives,3d0ue3,hulahulagirl,3,Sun Jul 12 19:13:39 2015 UTC,That's true. But it doesn't sound like that friend has been very empathetic/understanding of OP's situation (from what we know). It just sucks to have people pour their emotional bad energy on you when you're already feeling drained. Like maybe she should consider OP doesn't want that extra stress/sadness right now. But that's just my take.
entwives,3d0ue3,LethargicSuccubus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm just extra empathetic because I tried to reach out to some friends recently and got shut down hard,"

entwives,3d0ue3,fartgravel9000,0,Sun Jul 12 21:46:53 2015 UTC,"It does suck to lose a pet. I really know that, I've had dogs my whole life and had to have more than one put down and it kills.  And thats part of why I can't comfort her through this. I can't handle any further sense of loss. I can't handle her grief too while I'm desperately trying to keep my own under control and help my parents with theirs. And its hard not to get upset when I'm telling her about my mother begging me not to blame her if she kills herself before the cancer messes her up too much, and then my friend answers with some trivia about her cats health problems.  I don't know. I get resentful at times. Her life is full of drama and I've helped her through so many things. I've always been there for her. And I don't often need her for anything. My family in general is a lot more stable than hers is, stories about her father would fit in well over at r/raisedbynarcissists. Stories about her brother, too. This is one of those times when I do need her support, though. Instead I got to listen to her sob and tell me about her cat and theres this pissy little voice in the back of my head shouting that shes just pissed the world isn't revolving around her this week. Its not nice and its not fair and I feel bad but... Yeah. Thats how it is right now."
entwives,3d0ue3,fartgravel9000,2,Sun Jul 12 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"Ideally friends should take turns being there for eachother, but I know that doesn't always work since I've lost a lot of my friends over the last few years.  I'm sorry you're not able to get the support you need, and I wasn't trying to make you feel guilty so I'm sorry if that's what I did."
entwives,3d0ue3,Donkeydonkeydonk,-1,Sun Jul 12 21:40:01 2015 UTC,"Its okay.

I wish I had some advice, but I don't. There are some times when you just have to grit your teeth and bare it until you can find a spot to cry about it. Keep crying, sometimes it really does help.   I'm also atheist, and I can't fucking stand when people say ""its all part of gods plan"" or some other line like that. It's possibly the worst thing people can say to me. I don't tell them that, but I know how annoying and infuriating it can be.   I hope you at least some silver lining in the weeks to come. Even if there isn't one, toke on. Get mad punch a bag.

If you get arrested, if you come into work acting batshit crazy, if you do something completely out of their acceptable spectrum for ethical behavior....they will have legal grounds to drug test you and legal grounds to terminate you based on positive result. So take it as you will. My view is that if they hire you, they are ok with how you are. If you work the way they expect you to based on their initial view, they won't have reason or care to drug test you ""randomly""."

I noticed he was flirting when we were texting but I didn't think much of it because I was newly single so I thought he was trying to figure out where I stood with him; I kept rejecting him though. Weeeeeellllll then we actually hung out and he made it obvious he:  a) wanted to hook up with me  b) possibly wanted to have a serious relationship when all was said and done  c) specifically liked girls of my ethnicity (he also hit on my friend before)  Yeah, no. I kept insisting that he go to bars, have wingmen, try other dating sites specifically for casual sex, etc. AND I kept saying that I didn't want to get involved with anyone for the summer season, but he did not understand any of my signals. Wilst all of this he mentioned he was going to pick up some weed, and I asked if he could get me some (this was before he made it obvious he was sexually interested in me). He asked if I wanted to be his ""fuck buddy"" right before I left and I was stunned. I made my feelings very obvious beforehand and I was trying to be as polite as possible, so I accidentally said ""I don't know"" and just left. I ignored all his requests to hang out more, and I'm trying to ask my best friend to come with me tomorrow to pick it up but she doesn't want to drive in a car with weed in it (I have a place I can put it in the back while it's in an opaque bottle).  I know I have to just tell this dude that I'm not into him at all, but I've never been in this situation before and I just want my green stuff that I paid for with no arguments or drama!! I wish I wasn't so socially awkward.  EDIT UPDATE: Got the stuff, safe and sound.

Saturday was going to be my celebration day since I'm working all day today. I'm sure I can still get the tattoo, but that means no going out for drinks or new clothes, no money for extra stuff at the festival or paying for the acid and weed I was planning to get for the night time.

entwives,3cl0im,fssybtterflyprincess,2,Thu Jul 9 21:09:17 2015 UTC,My husbent purchased a Buddha. I love it! I love that you can adjust the heat. The only thing I would charge is the whip. We just stayed with the one it came with. Now we are looking to get a longer whip. It's easy to keep clean. Easy to take with you if you want or need to. Plus the AVB can cook and make editables.

entwives,3cl0im,ellydee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:28:05 2015 UTC,"I went with the pax for a few reasons. The biggest factor to my fianc√© and I was the subtlety of the design. This ruled out any hose or table vapes. We were worried about the vape being left out around the apartment and someone seeing it. Like if someone had to come in due to an emergency, or if we had a surprise visitor, someone who didn't know what they were looking at would probably just think the pax was a remote control or some type of gadget. It had positive reviews based on performance so it seemed like the way to go. I didn't have any experience vaping and it was very easy to adjust to. The design is sleek and simple. Overall I have no complaints :)"
entwives,3cl0im,caracakes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:39:13 2015 UTC,I just got the arizer extreme q tabletop vaporizer two weeks ago and I have to say that it is the best vape I have ever used. I feel like I've been missing out on this whole other side of how vaping cannabis affects my body pains and stomach issues. It's simply wonderful. I got mine from overstock.com for around $160 with free shipping. It is by far the best investment I've made in a vape device yet. I've had multiple pens and even a pax and this is better. Plus- I almost have enough ABV to make some cannabutter and start making edibles!
entwives,3cl0im,RennesM,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"I really like this one, just based off of online reviews!  With this one though can you just casually take pulls out of it (every few minutes) or does it turn off automatically? Also do you have to use the bags/adapters or can you go straight out of the whip?"

entwives,3cfj8i,cheshirecait,9,Tue Jul 7 15:39:45 2015 UTC,"I'm chubby, I'm a daily smoker, and I live an active lifestyle.  I find activities that are enhanced by trees.  So, get home from work, right, and smoke your bowl to relax, then instead of taking to the couch, maybe take a nice walk around your neighborhood, then reward yourself after that with couch time.  Another great activity when you're high is belly dancing.  Nothing makes me feel sexier and more empowered than doing a belly dance routine.  I have a chubby belly, and instead of hating it, I've learned how to move my core, and find rhythm and make my belly into a sexy focal point.  Plus, it's a great workout.  Like, you feel it everywhere.  Amazon has some great DvDs for under $10.  Also Tai Chi.  Fucking great when you're high.  Follow a beginner's video.  I found it...almost addicting.  So soothing, so focused, and a great gentle activity.   If you can avoid the couch a few times a week and sub in something equally inviting and relaxing to do, then you're gonna do it.  See also: yoga, pilates, swimming.  If you have access to a beach or pool, smoke a bowl, swim laps.  Don't smoke a bowl and relax in the pool.  Smoke and set a goal.  Also, I found that a few months of that kind of routine, suddenly I find myself buying a fitbit, walking longer, setting goals.  Like, I'll be driving home from work, and see that there's something going on down at the beach a mile away.  So, I get home, smoke a bowl, put on my sneakers and walk down there to watch a high school volleyball game, or check out the free band in the gazebo.    Another thing I found was that once I started working this kind of stuff into my routine, suddenly going to the gym was no big deal.  So I'm the only chubby one there.  I know what I'm about.    Edit:  after typing this up, I got the urge to look for more DVDs on Amazon for belly dancing, and I just discovered that sometime recently they put a shit ton of good workouts up on Prime.  So, if you have prime, search for ""belly dance"" and you're off to a good start.    There's good yoga and Tai Chi there too."

The main idea is, find something that you enjoy enough that you won't make excuses not to do it.  Find something active that you prefer to do over sitting around."

I don't know where you live, but I either go running or cycling in the trails in my city, and then treat myself to mflb on the riverbed (or a grassy hill, or against a tree, whatever) after working out super hard. It's the best. Great motivator too."
entwives,3cfj8i,bamboosticks,4,Tue Jul 7 15:16:08 2015 UTC,"I do quick exercises while watching TV. Jumping jacks during commercials, pushups, running in place. On the weekends I prefer to bike/go for a walk, but I live near a beach and that's a pretty good visual motivator."
entwives,3cfj8i,mjane0214,2,Tue Jul 7 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe you actually signed up for an awesome gym and all of the thinner people have worked the chubby off before you signed up! I'm not sure that helps, but honestly, it's about perspective. Try not to focus on them and focus on you instead. You're not doing it to look good for them, you're doing it to feel good about yourself! And idk about them, but I personally don't focus on other people at the gym because I'm too busy dying from what I'm doing to myself.   I'm not very active, but I'm actually underweight so gym life isn't for me til I can get on a good diet to balance me out. But I do try to take walks and enjoy the outdoors when I can. I avoid the laziness by rewarding myself with trees! I'll roll a blunt to take with me on a long walk, or toke up as soon as I get back home. You could also take it a step further and set goals for yourself with rewards, like buying a new piece when you reach a milestone weight or X amount of miles run in a month or whatever.   Snacking is a huge issue for me! After a horrible break up, I turned to trees and ate the pain away. It's like I never felt full. I was always hungry, if I wasn't hungry I had the munchies, and I always ate regardless of the reason. I gained 25 pounds. But I started combating it by making myself drink a big glass of ice cold water when I felt munchies coming on. I chose snacks that appealed to me while high but were a little healthier (trading heaps of chips and salsa for a bit of sun dried tomato triscuits, for instance). Celery was a big one too, because I like crunchy shit when I'm stoned and it was refreshing. I also put myself on rations sorta... I made myself eat three meals a day, and I was allowed to snack, but I had to plan it out before I smoked.   I hope this helps!"

Seriously, you can do this."
entwives,3cfj8i,evryvillainislemons,3,Wed Jul 8 01:38:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not smoking so much anymore thanks to the job hunt, but back when I used to smoke nightly I made a rule for myself that I wasn't allowed to smoke until after I went to the gym. After work I'd go home, veg out a bit, then wait til the annoyance that I couldn't smoke overcame my reluctance to go work out. I know what you mean about it being intimidating - I usually lift weights with a partner, but there are some weeks he is out of town and I have to go alone. At first, being the only girl in the weight section coupled with not being that good since I just started was super intimidating, and it still is sometimes to be honest. I usually just go at a time I know it won't be busy, like late at night, and put in my headphones and make the nastiest resting bitch face I can so no one comes to talk to me. Plus, knowing I get to go home and chill and smoke afterwards is great motivation to get it over with.   Also, if you don't like your gym, is it possible to switch, or are you locked into a contract?"
entwives,3cfj8i,silchi,3,Tue Jul 7 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"So many great suggestions in the comments so far!   I've been talking about joining a gym for months now, but never bite the bullet. I just don't think it's for me, and that's why I haven't followed through yet.   I keep plenty active, though. Sure, there are plenty of times where I'll smoke and then become one with my couch with a cold beer in hand. But I try to keep that as the exception rather than the norm.  I do have some gym-type equipment at home - a recumbent bike, some weights, yoga mat, so I try to use those during the week, or if the weather is bad or it's too late at night. Otherwise, I like having a smoke and then wandering the neighborhood, or going to play frisbee with my boyfriend.   I also like to take camping/hiking trips on weekends, and that's a great way to stay very active, but still get your ent on."
entwives,3cfj8i,sherbets,3,Tue Jul 7 18:43:25 2015 UTC,"I am so bad with motivation to work out!! The only thing that has worked for me so far is to take a class - right now I'm taking a beginning strength and conditioning class at a very small gym. Taking a class that I have to pay for up front pushes me to show up because if I don't, that's wasted money! Working out with a buddy helps, too, for accountability.  I would also recommend finding a new gym. One of the reasons I picked my gym is that after a couple personal training sessions there, I noticed that a lot of the people who worked out there are the same body type as mine - they are strong and fit, but they look like normal people. Some of them have a little gut, or are pear shaped, and they don't look like models. It helps a lot to not feel like my totally normal body shape, gut and everything, is accepted. (Before I committed to coming to a class I did a few sessions with a personal trainer to check out the gym and get comfortable - maybe doing this will help you find a better gym?)  Unfortunately, none of my solutions have to do with trees. Right now I work out in the morning and smoke in the evening, but I think if I was working out after work I would save the smoking as a treat to help recover from a workout and reward myself. I know that for me if I smoked before working out, it would never happen!"
entwives,3cfj8i,lulaloli,3,Wed Jul 8 00:57:22 2015 UTC,"I like to get just a little bit toasted (like a [3]) off a sativa, put my headphones on, and rock out while I work out. It makes running so much more fun, and strength exercises feel a lot better. I use a vape because smoking before working out doesn't seem like a great idea to me.   I also do yoga first thing in the morning. I take a class at a local studio at 6 AM. I have 0 excuses for skipping, because what the hell else am I going to do at 6 AM? It's not for everyone, but I've found that I have a 50% success rate for actually making it to the gym after work, but more like a 90% success rate for getting my ass up and going to yoga in the morning. I am one of those mythical morning people though ;P"
entwives,3cfj8i,poopspeepsfartsbutts,2,Wed Jul 8 03:15:56 2015 UTC,"blech, I don't like the gym either. you could always get your gear on, role, then pack some dope music and your 30 minute walk can easily turn into a 2 hour walk. as long as you keep your pace up and your heart rate you will be fine. plus the walking is low impact and not so rough on your knees like running is."
entwives,3cfj8i,warmerbread,2,Tue Jul 7 23:23:48 2015 UTC,Ugh gyms are awful. I love to smoke and then go for a long bike ride - it's active and it feels great! Endorphins + trees = a good time. I'm also one for being couch locked while high but I find that if I decide I'll go for a walk or bike ride before I smoke then there's a better chance that I'll follow through. Another tip I was told was to write down what you want to do (ex go for a 5km walk) before smoking so even if you forget after you smoke due to foggy brain you'll have that slip of paper to remind you.
entwives,3cfj8i,mdmayy_bb,2,Wed Jul 8 14:03:57 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to chime in on something, I adore trees and am an ent till the end, but I read an interesting psychopharmacological article on cannabis and exercise. I'd link but I'm on mobile, it was from the book 'Buzzed' which compiles helpful info on almost every drug without being preachy or negative.  The book was explaining that exercising under the influence of cannabis is actually extra bad for the heart, because cannabis is a vasodilator, which means your blood pressure has to drastically raise to pump enough blood for exercise. I used to exercise high all the time, but I noticed my heart rate was extremely higher than it was sober. Sober, I could get to 170bpm with a lot of effort. High, my bpm would be like 195 after barely doing cardio.  I love trees, but made the choice to conserve my precious heart and only toke after I exercise - which is way more relaxing anyway! :D  Up to you, of course, but knowledge is power! :)  Edited to add: maybe make toking a reward you can only have if you've exercised that day. I promise, taking a fat bong rip before hopping in the shower after kicking my own ass at the gym, is almost as good as an orgasm!"

I'm in Lake Forest Park right at the northern point of Lake Washington, 15m north of downtown.  Double-hurray for legal weed!   I had a similar moment yesterday afternoon.  I've got a moss garden in my backyard - delightfully low-maintenance since you can let it go brown in the summer & it just resurrects in the fall when it starts raining again. Anyhoo, yesterday I decided that since it's been so dry, I'd let the moss get a refresher so I ran the sprinkler for 5m or so.  Then I sat down in the garden and smoked a bowl and suddenly life was ridiculously good. The moss not only completely revived to a vibrant green, it sponged up all the water so the ambient temp suddenly dropped by a good 5-10 degrees.  There were 2 squirrels fighting in the big maple overhead, birds were singing, a hummingbird zoomed by.  I was sitting in plain view of the road so any of my neighbors could see me smoking if they looked out the window, but none of them would care anyway.  It was a great way to finish off the weekend.  :)"

It's a great neighborhood, especially in your early 20s.  It always feels awake, like no matter what time it is, someone's up.  And it's on a direct busline to everything too, so that's handy.  Issaquah's obviously a lot more removed from downtown Seattle, but I think if you live out there, you don't really need to go into Seattle as much.  It's grown a ton in the last few years to service the Microsoft crowd so there's a lot more to do than there used to be. And it's convenient to working/entertainment in Redmond/Bellevue/Kirkland. It's definitely more of a suburban feel compared to the U-District.

Went from having relatively light periods, to having to change a super-plus tampon every half hour. (Try explaining that to your male line leader when you work in an assembly-line style factory.) It also resulted in really awful cramps (my cramps had been mild, previously.) and a HUGE increase in UTIs and yeast infections.   The first time I asked PP to remove it, they said it would cost $400. The second time, the gyno told me to breathe and prepare for a little bit of pain. She just grabbed the string and popped it out.   It was amazing. I'm on the patch now, and while it's not perfect (It comes off when using bath bombs! Lame.) it's WAY better than the copper cross was for me. I still had some residual side effects from the IUD for a few years after (mainly the increased infections. I continued having them fairly regularly for a year or two after it was removed.) but the bleeding and the cramps went back to normal after just a few cycles.  So if the IUD is making you miserable, I HIGHLY recommend going and seeing if they can remove it and replace it with something more appropriate for you."

I've gone from being a hypersexual person and wanting to do it 5 times a day to being unable to orgasm at all unless I'm high. It's very frustrating and really putting a strain on my relationship.

I have had several traumatic events happen in a short period of time (from ages 13-14, I'm now 22) and still suffer from PTSD. Therapy was the most helpful thing for me, has that been a part of your recovery? If not you should seriously look into it. Sometimes it takes a few goes to find a therapist you really connect with but when you do, it's life changing. Some kind of anti anxiety meds or sleep meds might help you too. I like to do things naturally (weed is my go to) but I still believe that sometimes medication can play an important role when times get really tough. If the panic attacks or sleep issues are really impacting your life, I'd look into it with your doctor.   Talking to a close friend or family member can also be really beneficial. It just lightens the burden a bit and helps you feel less alone.  When I start feeling overwhelmed or if I've had a panic attack I like to go into self-care mode. A hot bath, some comfort food, Netflix, a bowl or two, followed by a walk in the sun or a snuggle in bed depending on the weather. I might do a face or hair mask, or do my nails. Whatever makes me feel nice and does me some good. I dunno if you're into stuff like that but it helps me recover from bad days :)"
entwives,3c33r7,Laur-Ent,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:52:37 2015 UTC,"Thank for sharing. Knowing I'm not alone makes me feel less like a failure. People keep telling me I should be all better and it feels like I keep letting them and myself down by not being better.   I've tried several therapists, and I have a hard time really connecting. I have list of movement therapists in the area I'm going to try next. I've been using a form of dance as part of my physical recovery and it also helps my emotional stuff. But I think I need more guidance. I just hope I can afford it.   The reason I use weed is due to the fact that after the second incident I went back on sleep aids and anti-anxiety meds only to find that it did nothing. I would lay in bed for hours after taking 2 ambiens.   Thankfully I have my wonderful supporting husband and my crazy little dog next to me (he is sitting next to me right now whining as I weep).  I think I will try to take it easy on myself today. Thank you for sharing and encouraging me."
entwives,3c33r7,Laur-Ent,2,Sat Jul 4 15:38:55 2015 UTC,"You are not a failure. Anyone who says you should be over it by now is being insensitive and they don't know shit. Everyone deals with things differently and in their own way. When something so traumatic happens, it stays with you for a long, long time, and you'll never forget it. But as time goes on you get better at dealing with it and after a while the weight of it isn't so heavy. Then eventually you find you don't think about it every day. Then one day it just doesn't have power over you anymore, and instead of it feeling like something that's still happening to you, it feels like an old memory. It takes time, and lots of patience. Be kind to yourself and let yourself go through the process. Do it at your own pace. It isn't easy but this is the kind of stuff that teaches you the most important life lessons and makes you a stronger person.   When I was 13 I was sexually abused for 6 months. Then I lost ALL my friends when I needed them most, lost my good reputation at school, and was heavily bullied (physically, emotionally, online, they tore my life apart for the next 2 years). When I was 14 my family was involved in a serious car accident which left my much loved brother with a head injury. It was bad. He died a few times on the way to hospital but slowly made it back to us. The next 6 months was all about his recovery so I didn't really have time to deal with all my own issues. I bottled it all up but was dealing with some serious PTSD. I'd have flashbacks constantly, nightmares that I'd wake up from screaming, panic attacks, depression, I even considered suicide frequently because real life seemed too hard and unfair. My parents sent me to therapists but I never liked them so we never made real progress. I just said what they wanted to hear so I could go home. Then I started getting OCD because of the sexual abuse. I didn't want to touch anything that could have been touched by a man after he'd touched his own penis (eg. After using the bathroom and not washing hands, something my annoying, gross looking step dad did all the time). I washed my hands so frequently they'd crack and bleed. It got pretty bad and I was miserable. Eventually I couldn't even hug my own mother. Once I figured out where this fear was coming from (dick germs > hands > could transfer to my mouth = too similar to the blowjobs I was forced into at 13) I knew I had to speak up about those incidents. So I prosecuted my abuser and brought him to justice. After that I felt like I could start moving on because it was no longer unresolved. Then my mum found be this therapist who was amazing. She was very alternative and spiritual, and didn't have a conventional method. But she got to the root of my issues and helped me work through them. It was amazing. But I think it also helped that at that point in my life I was truly ready to talk about it all.   I never work well with male therapists because I obviously have some issues around men. And when I was 11 I had a male therapist who was pretty inappropriate with me which made me really uncomfortable. So I definitely understand how hard it can be to find a good one. But it is worth it. Sometimes you have to think outside the box, like my mum did. I've also heard there is very good free therapy at the university here because the psych post grads need experience, but are very smart and switched on. Maybe that's something you could look into it you have a university where you live?   Anyway, sorry this is so long. I just wanted to share my story with you in case it's at all similar to yours. I think talking to people who've gone through the same stuff is just as important as talking it out with close family or friends. While they can offer more personal support they might not understand what it's really like for you, but strangely, sometimes strangers on the internet can. And I promise you things will get easier. As long as you don't bottle it up. Acknowledging how you are feeling, and taking care of yourself, are two good first steps. And as I said, be kind to yourself. Appreciate the good things you have done, and give yourself credit where it's due. Even if you've had a panic attack, it's not a sign of failure. Think of it as a success that you got through it.   When I feel a panic attack coming on now I have things I do. First I try to keep my mind on track. If I start on a downwards spiral (mentally) I know it's gonna get bad, fast. So I try to just get through the next few minutes while thinking rationally and if I have to, I force myself to focus on one thing. Like the TV, or watching the clock, or counting. Alerting someone near by can help if they know what to do. Gently talking you back to reality is a good one. Taking deep, belly breaths is also important, so you don't start hypoventilating. I also try to change my body language. If I curl up on the floor I know it'll get bad. So I try to do the opposite, I sit up straight, hold my head up, loosen my hands/arms and open my chest a bit. I know I'm getting really stressed when my body starts shutting off from everything (clenched firsts, arms wrapped around my stomach or over my chest, legs squeezed together, head down, shoulders up) so it really helps change my mindset when I change my body language, open up, breathe deeply, and keeping my focus on something else. If I do this, the feelings will eventually pass and I'll feel OK again.   I don't know if that would work for you but it really helps me. It took a little while to be successful with it because once a panic attack starts it's so easy just to let it take over. But learning how to prevent it before it really sets in is key.   I hope I've helped in some way. Again sorry this is so long!"

Most of the time I feel crazy and alone.   I've been considering alternative therapy for a bit now. My husband has been encouraging me to get it going soon, and he's pretty persistent. I'm just always so hesitant, I'm much like you where I tell them what they want to hear and I move on. At first I think it helps, but then my body tells me something different. I hold a lot of my tension, anxiety and feelings in my hips and right now it feels like all my muscles, tendons and ligaments are so taught they might snap.   Thank you for your story, it definitely helped me."

I subconsciously hold my self quite tensely when I'm stressed and my muscles knot up like crazy. But I've found yoga to be super helpful! I know everyone's always like ""omg do yoga it's amaze"" but seriously, there's a reason it's been around for so long! Even if you don't have a yoga mat, looking up an easy yoga routine on YouTube can mean the difference between a good day and a bad day for me. Sorry if you already do this and I'm preaching to the choir haha. But I've had hip problems too (from the car accident) and there are some really amazing yoga poses for your pelvis/hip muscles."

I also self medicate for my OCD, which I was diagnosed with at 11, and anxiety. I've recently had to give up my beloved weed while job searching and it's made me miserable. The stress from the job search has turned my compulsive tendencies up 10 notches and I've been using marijuana so long that I don't know how to self manage it anymore like I used to.     I spent a few years in therapy but I remember hating every second of it. I might take the other commenters advice and try a few more out but my last psychiatrist left a bad taste in my mouth. I hate the pharmaceutical options; they turn me into a smiling, numb, stupefied version of myself. Sure, it quiets my brain enough that I can function but I feel like I lose ""me"". Maybe I should give a few more types of medication a chance, but I've found what works for me and let's me stay me while also letting me experience a feeling of normalcy. If it were even just medically legal here I would gladly go and get my medicinal card, but until then I guess I'll just find some way to deal with it.     Just know you're not alone and there are other options when cannabis isn't cutting it. I would explore everything until you find what works for you. I definitely second talking to someone, it can make all the difference in the world. Even just writing down what you're feeling if you're not ready to talk to someone can be cathartic. I wish you all the luck and happiness in the world and I hope you find something that helps you soon. And remember, you're not letting anyone down by feeling what you're feeling! Sometimes we experience negative things and it takes a long time to ""feel better"", so don't let anyone tell you what emotions you should be experiencing."

entwives,3bo04r,zanvansk,5,Tue Jun 30 21:54:44 2015 UTC,"So are you saying that you've never experienced couchlock and extreme horniness while high? Weed basically enhances sensations and perceptions, so it'll make whatever you're doing or feeling feel more intense than when you're sober. So if you're sitting on the couch, it makes it feel impossible to get up from the couch.  That said, weed is also a natural aphrodisiac, so not only is it easier to get really horny while high, sex and sexual pleasure feels better too.  EDIT: Forgot to add that, yes, both of those things happen to me, except I only get horny when I smoke with my boyfriend. lol"

I get the mad munchies when I smoke and I've found the best way to continue smoking while changing my lifestyle is to just not have the ultra yummy bad food around. When I buy groceries I buy all good food then healthy snacks such as fruits, veggies with hummus or other healthy dips, nuts, cheese sticks, turkey pepperoni, etc. it has helped so much to not have the temptation there.   I also prepare my dinner first before smoking. That way when I do have the munchies, I have a healthy dinner right there, already done.   If you are looking into possible diets, I would recommend /r/keto and /r/ketotrees. These have been great for me and helped me loose 30 lbs so far. Good luck! Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or are just looking for some support!"
entwives,3bjqk2,Cheezier11,7,Mon Jun 29 20:30:23 2015 UTC,"All excellent tips. I like the idea of cooking first. Before, what I'd usually do would be to order food, then smoke, so by the time it got here I was stoned and ready for it. I think maybe, eg, putting something in the oven, setting a timer, and then smoking, would have the same effect without, y'know, killing me.  I'm intrigued by keto, because I had some success in high school with Atkins. My current deal is 1500 calories, but no carbs except those I get in fruits, while I research plans and methods that will work for me. Thanks for pointing me to those subs, I'll defs be visiting."
entwives,3bjqk2,clover3k,5,Mon Jun 29 20:38:08 2015 UTC,"I'm on Keto, and let me tell you. Amazing. I don't need to count my calories and can naturally only eat one meal a day. When I smoke, it's usually at night and I have something around me (like pork rinds) to munch on and make sure to fall asleep ASAP. I also munch on the Atkins granola bars/candy bars (because they are so good they are essentially candy). So when I eat the one meal in a day, my munching at night doesn't stop my weightloss progress.   My cravings are REALLY helped by the lack of sugar in my diet. So even though I get munchies still, I can be easily appeased by cheese and meat and such, which actually helps my body to realize I'm full, anyway. The carb loading while high doesn't help the cravings. If you are interested at all or have any questions in the diet feel free to PM me! I'm always looking for Keto/diet/Ent buddies! :D"

Literally just snacks, candy, Mac n cheese, pizza....carbs, high fructose corn syrup, saturated fat. Even when Im not high, I'm lazy, and cooking is so much effort when you could just eat chips....plus low self control and serious munchies. It was bad.  So I literally only bought healthy food. Cheese sticks, yogurt, Apple snack packs, berries, ect. When I'm couch locked at home I literally have to be healthy. I lost about 40 pounds (still chubby but I don't mind) and have kept it off with no problems.  I don't work out but I try to at least be a little active. Park in the back of the parking lot, take the stairs, walk around the block after dinner, stuff like that. It at least prevents the whole ""getting winded going up the the stairs"" thing."

I started using trees to treat my fibromyalgia, and I've gained a pants size since, mostly because of munchies.    What I like to do is smoke and then get out in nature.  We have a network of trails by a creek close to my house, and I take the dog for a walk, the length of which depends on my pain level.  It gets me the exercise I need, I get to see and smell pretty things, and my dog is happy.    Also maybe examine what strains you're using.  I used to use a lot of rocky candy strains that didn't give me munchies, but my most recent buy was some Bruce Banner which gives me CRAZY cravings for salt and sweets.  If you live in a rec or med state I might talk with a dispensary employee and see what they think."

So I would pack my shit and go for long walks in national preserves. I lost all the weight and then some within a couple months. Like, 30-40 lbs. I never really changed my diet either, apart from avoiding munchies due to being outside and not having access to them.  Also, I'm not sure if this was mentioned, but go buy some fun, non fatty snacks to munch on. Watermelon, grapes, raw veggies and a light dip are all awesome to veg out with in front of the TV. also, drink shit loads of water, especially when you do smoke. Smoking makes you thirsty (captain obvious here) and sometimes we mistake thirst for hunger.  Best of luck to ya buddy!"

It's good to be physical and active but working off a chocolate bar is really really hard  get high then go for a walk, don't bring any kind of money/cards/whatever that way you can't be tempted.  moderation is literally everything. making all your favorite foods off limits isn't gonna work for most people.

My goal is a certain weight that is healthy for my height I have only 5 more left to get rid of. I didn't change anything regarding my lifestyle besides what I ate.   I counted my calories. Keep a food journal and make entries after you eat anything and use your phone to look up how many calories you need to consume every day to lose weight at a healthy rate. The key is to not starve yourself, if you do you won't see results because starvation fucks w your metabolism.    Once you have an understanding of what amount of food you need to eat every day you'll get comfortable portioning food you may not need to record it.   Cut out soda, that shit is so terrible for you even the so called diet stuff :)  Also a tip I use is to keep drinking water during the day. Sometimes I think I'm hungry between meals but it turns out I'm just thirsty.    You can prepare healthy snacks ahead of time. I cut up carrots, bell peppers, and other of my fav veggies and keep them in a container in the fridge. I eat them with a little ranch when I get the munchies. Veggies are low in calories, nutritional, and have essential vitamins. Fruit is good too but keep in mind sugar as sugar turns into fat? From what I understand. I replaced candy and baked goods w fruit. It's like what Chris said from Parks and Recreation fruit is ""nature's candy!!"" Good luck :D"

The combination of finding healthier alternatives to munch on and drink as well as just not buying the bad stuff have helped me tons - if it's in my house, I know I'm gonna wanna eat it so I try and make those choices when I'm sober.  For the times I do wanna treat myself to sweets, I've found that buying hard candy like Jolly Ranchers or Werther's Originals have helped, since you can only eat one at a time and I'm not a chewer so they last awhile. I also really like the Dreyer's Outshine fruit bars - they're really tasty popsicles mostly made with fruit juice, and they're not too bad on calories - like 90 for one. I'd recommend the creamy coconut or the peach!!  For drinks, I've been super into good flavored sparkling water, especially the Le Croiux brand stuff - their grapefruit flavor is so tasty, and no calories or weird extra stuff - just carbonated water and flavor (though maybe the ""flavor"" is bad, I dunno).

Cooking is the easiest way to save monehs and maintain a good diet! Also sometimes when you're hungry drinking a glass a water can sometimes curb your appetite!  Additionally, getting into the habit of buying healthy munchies also makes it much better! If youre gonna get the munchies may as well be with a bowl of fruit than bags of candy!  Although diet is huge, exercise will have a huge impact as well! Consider starting a work out routine.

Just a container of each. Then I load it up into a tupperware for a huge fruit salad. Fruit is delicious when you are sober and even better high. If you don't like fruit without sugar or something sweet pinterest has some good glazes/dressings for on top. I have a designated bowl I fill with a good amount every night and munch on that."

Every little think you eat, you write it down. Maybe when you get the munchies, you can reference that and decide whether or not you should eat."
entwives,3bjqk2,galactique,4,Tue Jun 30 00:55:25 2015 UTC,"I lost 25 lbs just using MyFitnessPal. The biggest thing for me was getting thirsty whilst smoking. Beverage choices are so important. Water is best, but if you need soda, go for calorie free soda. Coke Zero has a decent not-diety flavor and you've still got the fizz. Portion control, weight watchers  or lean cuisine frozen meals (mostly eat them once a day for lunch or dinner,) and diet soda are what did it for me. Good luck!!"

entwives,3bjqk2,conjunctionfunktion,2,Wed Jul 1 18:40:53 2015 UTC,"I actually lost weight when I started smoking regularly. I lost about 20 lbs over the course of a year and my s/o lost over 80. My s/o and I were going through a difficult financial time, and while it seems silly to start smoking then, it actually helped. Before, we would eat out all the time, binge drink all the time etc. We decided to cut all that, buy 1/8 every two weeks and spend $200 on groceries a month and having that little bit of joy helped us stick to our plan. What we found was that trees helped us to become very... uhh creative. Think about that show chopped and we were kind of doing the same thing but poor. I could write a whole poor ent's cookbook with the shit we did. If you're sitting and smoking in the evenings try to buy snacks that take a long time to mindlessly eat, but are lower calorie like shell-on pistachio nuts or sunflower seeds. Those cuties clementines are the BOMB high. If you're like me and end up on and endless salty-sweet-salty-sweet never ending cycle, pop in some hubbabubba bubblegum or brew some high quality coffee/tea to end it. Coffee is an appetite suppressant so it helps a lot. If you're day smoking, get up and do some activities. I live in a city and love to just walk around high. Get a lemonade/unsweet tea in a foam cup and walk around your city and tell me it's not the best thing ever. Find a casual sport and do that high. Hell, I go to the gym high. Basically, whatever lifestyle you're trying to adopt I honestly think trees can help with the transition."

I only smoke vape a few times a week, at most, and I tend to fall asleep pretty quickly after I do so. If I'm trying to eat less on a given night (especially if I've hit my calorie goal already), I make sure to have ice water ready, since usually that helps with the dry mouth. Fruits and veggies aren't very calorie dense, and they're really tasty, so those are good, too. Bananas, apples, strawberries, carrots, those kinds of things."

I went to visit Aurora about a month ago, and my city is about 10 feet above sea level and I can tell you that altitude sickness is definitely a thing. Even a flight of stairs was way tougher than normal. So for hiking, you should stop by a CVS when you're there and grab a can of oxygen to bring with you. This sounds crazy but they'll know what you are talking about. Be careful if you're drinking, too.  This is probably a no-brainer, but I am high sooo BRING A CAMERA. It's amazingly beautiful. If you end up in Denver, we had some to die for mussels at Beatrice & Woodsley. A little pricey but what an experience (treat yourself).

If you want to be within walking distance of bars, restaurants, and the like: stay near Pearl. Otherwise, you can still get to Pearl by car within a few minutes. All of my recc's are right in Boulder, but there is plenty outside of Boulder, too!  Coffee Shops: Ozo Coffee, Flatiron Coffee, The Cup, and Boxcar.  Ent: Fresh Baked is my favorite. Helping Hands is good, The Farm is huge, Karing Kind is a PITA to get out of the parking lot, but they have ""infused"" goodies.  Restaurants/Breweries: Mountain Sun. Fate Brewery. Walnut Cafe for breakfast/coffee (or The Buff, but you have to wait, usually).  As far as the altitude: just drink a lot of water.

entwives,3b18ra,blufootedboobielover,10,Thu Jun 25 03:48:30 2015 UTC,"Check out this study - the children whose mothers used cannabis to treat their symptoms developed as well or better than the children whose mothers did not.  Obviously, all things in moderation. But I know many, many mothers who have smoked during this phase of their lives and their kiddos are amazing. It makes me sad that you even have to doubt yourself, thanks to the propaganda machine.  Know your state's laws and make sure you're not subject to any drug testing as a new mother. Also, maybe try edibles so you don't have any residual smoke smell or potential irritants lingering. Much love."
entwives,3b18ra,katnip86,4,Thu Jun 25 05:50:06 2015 UTC,"Your supply should be fine.   With once daily use of a moderate amount, the amount of thc passed through your milk will be trivial. It's unlikely that the child will ever feel anything.  The negative impacts of marijuana on a developing brain are much more likely to occur and more likely to be detectable in  children who are exposed to THC in utero.   Legal issues aside, I would not stress about thc in your milk at all.  As to whether mj will help you: that really depends on your brain and its wiring. Not everyone responds positively to mj. Depression and anxiety can complicate your reaction.   I hope you are feeling better soon. hugs"

When my son was 5 weeks old my (what would have been) FIL committed suicide and we had to pack a 5 week old baby and ourselves into a tiny sedan and drive halfway across the country to handle everything. we were out there for 2 plus weeks. I had abstained thus far because they sent a social worker to the hospital and threatened to take my baby away because i said 'i may have smoked before i knew i was pregnant, but definitely not since' at my initial intake appointment. t/hey scared the shit out of me. But by the 6th day of sitting in a garage in the middle of east cuddy bum fuck with a bunch of missing teeth drunk rednecks (no offense they were some of the nicest and funniest bastards ive ever met) i gave in. i had to for my sanity. guess what, my son is fine. much better than if i was a ball of stress who couldnt care for him properly because of what was going on inside my head. If anything, being stressed and anxious all the time will affect your milk supply more than smoking a little weed would."
entwives,3b18ra,tculli,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:24:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know....  I really don't know. But I can tell you that with my second child I held the belief there comes a point where what I put in my body was riskier then what no breast milk would do to my child. My mom gut told me this decision is part of the difference developmentally that I see between my two children. (And I wasn't using mmj at all leading up to and durning my child birthing years)  Your child is 1 years old. Given the increase risks with MMJ use, not limited to the unknow of passing it on through milk to unsure how some crazy might react and risk loosing your kids. For me, I would look to weaning the 1 yr old first. Also, your body and mental health will change dramatically from weaning a baby........maybe all of this is a sign it is time to exit the child birthing/infant raising phase of life, for at least a few years, to get your own health back on track.  The really cool thing is that babies thrive when their mother thrives. All other things considered, a thriving mother is better then."

There are very few diseases that qualify...""cancer, HIV/AIDS, Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, damage to the nervous tissue of the spinal cord with objective neurological indication of intractable spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathies and Huntington's disease."". You even have to appoint a caregiver. It seems like such half assed attempt when they could make SO MUCH MONEY off of the taxes on recreational bud alone!

We would be lucky. I think NJ only has a couple and more central and north. At least from what I remember someone complaining about it.  I really hope it opens up and covers more things so all people could get the peace they want. I need to keep a better eye on what's going on state level.   Edit: The schools would also love all that tax money coming in! Newburgh is already in a court case with the state because they owe our district millions. Maybe then Cuomo would have to give the school districts what they are owed.

And it's frustrating because the ""committee"" is not really a committee but a closed down meeting of a couple well-connected medical companies that will be allowed to grow cannabis for medical purposes.

I bought 5 pairs of pants in a size 11/12 and after getting over the size, I was happy again that I found pants that fit me. I mostly wear skirts and dresses that don't show my tummy. And my boobs look fantastic. I can look into the mirror and see how awesome my boobs look and I really don't care about the rest of it.   Try to find that thing that you love about yourself and show it off and forget about everything else.  YOU ROCK! And I rock. And no one has to be perfect.

They know that I smoke, they know that I grow. Out of respect for them and their views it's just not something that comes up. I've tried a few times with my mom. She gets it, my dad is a close minded old codger who spends his time around old white men who watch Faux news. He's a really great guy but he's seriously delusional.   At some point I stopped thinking that I had to share every part of my life with them. Yes, I'm a stoner but I am more importantly their daughter.

entwives,3avdjf,turtree,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:42:51 2015 UTC,"My recommendation would be to wait a while. Let her see you with your kiddo, let her know beyond all doubt you are a good parent. When you do bring it up, try not making a commotion of it. I was able to kind of casually tell my mom, and it was much better than if I'd sat her down for 'a talk'. Good luck, and congrats on the move - so jelly of you legal smokers!"
entwives,3avdjf,Cravinn,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:13:53 2015 UTC,"I hid it for years, afraid of what or how my family would react. i remember my mom flipping out a few times when she came across my sisters 'supplies' as teenagers. shes younger and didnt try to hide it at all. So i was afraid to be open about it with her. we had two younger siblings and my sister would leave pipes out, bags and joint roaches. I hid it from my dads side because they seemed like such uptight not open minded judgemental people.  I later found out that my dad's side would sneak into the garden sed to smoke. Or everytime they 'went to the store' they would pack as many of them as they could into the car, and i never understood, most of the time they came back empty handed laughing their asses off for the rest of the night. Those bastards were going to smoke!!  My sister began dating this guy like, ten years ago or something, he ended up being one of the biggest suppliers in our area and had actually just got popped and was about to do some time in jail (his friend is the one who got caught, it was his stuff so he turned himself in to lessen the burden on his friend and his wife, hes a real good due, it was his friends carelessness that got them caught and he ultimately took the punishment no questions asked and did his time.) He was the nicest guy ever. He had a college degree. He changed the opinion of our family of what a weed man is like.  anyways, thats kind of when my sister and i started to be a little more open with it. Im starting to ramble here.   My advice to you is have a talk with them before you get home for good. Let them know how much it helps you, that they dont need to worry about your childs safety or well being, that you think it helps you to be a better parent for reasons xyz, and leave the door open that if they feel a problem is arising due to your smoking, they can feel free to openly let you know in a caring and effective way, not a judgemental, domineering way. I would say exactly what you typed up there to her. The whole margarita bit and all. I smoke because i can still appropriately take care of the kids high, but i cant if ive been drinking. I had one pina colada yesterday afternoon and was down for the night. seriously couldnt peel my ass of the couch.  Then dont have to condone it, or accept it, but they should accept you for you and everything that comes with it. i know its easier said than done, but you dont need negativity like that hanging around all the time. It will only make whatever anxiety you already suffer from much worse because you'll be nervous to have them in your house, always thinking what if?? what if??  Now, just because she knows doesnt mean you have to smoke around her. Everyone now knows we are avid marijuana users and advocates, in every shape and form. Hubby was active in the legalization efforts in our state so we didnt want to hide that. When family is around that dont condone smoking, we just take it outside or in the basement."

She seems like she is the type that thinks you just need to be stronger. Depress people feed off each other, so her depression might get much worse when she talks with you. You bring it out in her, so she views cutting off the relationship as a strong thing to do. The sacrifice you make to keep mental health.   Only.....that's not how it works......  So your sister may be a bitch to you, but that is most likely because she is just as broken on the inside. So don't take it personally, because in reality you should feel sorry for her."

I also just started experimenting with green dragon (made my first batch yesterday!) but I'm not sure how effective it is yet.  I've used a lot of the rock candy strains to good success (the flavor is slightly citrusy, like Sprite).    Nutrition and supplements are also really important, as is mild, low impact exercise like walking or yoga.  As my rheumatologist told me, fibromyalgia is not a sprain, it won't get better with just rest. As much as it may hurt in the beginning, if you don't move around, it will only get worse.  As far as supplements go, I use ribose powder for energy, and a herbal supplement called Zyflamend by New Chapter.  You can find both on amazon.  Anything with valerian (a natural muscle relaxant), turmeric (anti-inflammatory), and lemon balm (calms anxiety and helps with 'fibro fog') will be beneficial.

Smoking straight trees, Blue Dream is by far, hands down the very best! It hits all the points I need, pain relief, a creative pick me up, an easy come down. It also deliveries the same results each time and I can judge very well how long a does will last. This makes planning little things like shopping trips enjoyable again.

I would say that sticking with hybrids is a good choice for Fibro.  As far as edibles go, I think they do a really good job at calming the body down, which can be very nice in a flare.

My preference is to do ~2-3 bags at 210C and ~1-2 more at 230C (with the same bowl load) as it's a good middle-ground between efficiency and harshness for me.  It's also worth making sure that all of your connections are solid.  The black ring on top of the unit can become loose over time and leave a space for vapour to leak out of during filling."

The first thing I recommend is investing in the PA 2.0 at your earliest possibility. It revolutionized it for me. I used to only hit about a [5] on my best days. Since the PA, I get stoned as hell hahaha.    Try different ways of inhaling! When I hit mine, I hold the button for five seconds and then hit it. I hit it for one second, hold off for a second, hit it, let off, and hit it. Then I shake it - still holding the power button. Then I hit it, release, hit it, release, hit it, and let go of the button. Every time I hit it, it's for one second and release it for one second. Not the simplest, but I notice a big difference."

I was experimenting with that, and will continue to do so! I was interested to see how some ways of drawing breath were much more effective than others. I have a noob question: I'm confused as to what they mean when they say to ""release the battery"" at the end - do you have to take it all the way out to be properly released, or just stop pushing on it?"
entwives,3ad67x,mjane0214,2,Fri Jun 19 16:10:11 2015 UTC,"Just stop pushing on it! Yeah the batteries really don't seem to hold a good charge. That's another reason I prefer the PA.   That breathing technique is my new favorite.

The one I go to the most is in Lynnwood - it's awwwwwesome.  It's also ladies-only, so no swimsuits so you have to be a bit comfortable in your own skin.  But I've found that after a minute or two of ogling interesting tattoos, everyone stops paying attention to the nudity. They have 3 heated tubs and a cold plunge with a waterfall.  A dry sauna and a wet sauna.  And then there's a series of radiant heat rooms heated to different temperatures and lined with different materials with different benefits - charcoal, salt, jade, etc. I'm not sure if they really have healing properties, but they're lovely to lie down in after a good scrub.  Oh, and when you get a scrub, they're THOROUGH... not an area of your skin is left un-exfoliated. Oh and they have a tea room and a Korean restaurant in addition to the usual suite of spa services.  I haven't been to the Russian one, but I believe it's co-ed so swimsuits are required.  And they've got a tepid salt plunge that's supposed to be awesome after the sauna.  Oh, and they have these bundles of willow or birch branches.  I think you're supposed to have someone lightly brush or smack your skin with them - it's supposed to help with your circulation while the essential oils tone your skin, or something along those lines.

I have kind of a loose concept of recording my personal folk tradition--the songs my family sang on road trips, at renaissance festivals (we're a family band), and as lullabies. I'm not sure I want to take it any farther than recording folk covers from my bedroom, but as someone who has been trapped under a blanket of depression and anxiety for most of my life, this feels like the beginning of a new me.

entwives,3a8gpi,evileine,2,Thu Jun 18 14:36:21 2015 UTC,"I love making my green dragon! When I've got a surplus I like to let a ton of bud steep in a high proof vodka for a few weeks/months to really build a strong flavor and increase the potency. I bottle mine in little dropper bottles so you can add a few drops to a soda to spice things up or even put a drop or two directly under the tongue for max intensity. Letting it sit for a long time is best if you want to take it that way since it will burn like hell! :p  For a little less intensity if you don't have the time to let it sit, vigorously shaking the bottle will help infuse the THC into the alcohol, but be ready for the burn! I definitely recommend tinctures! :)"

I'm not 100% sure how exactly THC reacts with alcohol, but I know that most of the recipes I've seen for Green Dragon require the bud and alcohol to be boiled together in a glass, making the THC decarboxylate. I've also heard plenty of good things about your method, too - I just wonder how the potency would change between fresh/decarbed weed."

We had a few problems here and there (they said I was anti-social) and I'm high maintenance for wanting soap to wash my hands after using the bathroom or handling raw meat, which they had no hand soap in the entire house. I refused to have a big wedding because 1.) Most of my family is dead. I don't want to look at the crowd and be reminded of who isn't there. And 2.) I don't have the money, energy, or health to stand up in front of a bunch of people in a stuffy dress.   But I guess the straw that broke the camel's back was I made them a variety of homemade cookies and candies for Christmas and none of them even thanked me or acknowledged me in any way and it hurt a lot. I said nothing to them about it, but after we left I told (then)SO that it hurt. He called them and asked for an apology, they said no and said that I expect to be treated better than everyone else and they aren't going to cater to me. And some vague mentions of my lupus, though it really affected them very little. SO and I decided I never had to go to any more family functions if that's how they felt about me. He got drunk, he shaved his head, and in the morning he was gone and never came back. Broke off our engagement via text.   But it's for the best though. I learned a lot about what I need from a relationship. I met a much better man who is a much better fit for me. And I think my ex is married and has a baby now, which is wonderful for him.

Simple put, she was not getting the love and emotional support she needed, the environments she was in we're doing harm to her, but to take her out of those environments everyone flipped their lid on us.....the pediatrician gave me a long look and asked the important questions but I could tell she was unsure. Daughter just had a birthday and in we went for the annual well check up, she is amazing! Lots of issues have cleared up cause you know when you are not under constant stress and trying to deal with bullies all day you tend to thrive!   Yes, I gave up a six figure job (I hated working anyhow) Yes, I pulled her out of one of the best schools (but everyone is so kind there, gag) Yes, I challenged the sports league and no, some old angry man does not get to determine my daughter's fate.  Oh look at that, her old coach got the sherif called on him in the first 5 mins of a tournament.  Yes, you bet your asses my kid is still playing. Those grown ass men tried to cockblock her from playing anywhere. She hasn't even hit puberty yet, you fuckers!   Not every person thrives in the normal folds of society. We have to start recognizing that we are doing a shit ton of harm when we rage against people who don't fit into the perfect normal mold.   So Ya know what, fuck em. Fuck them all!

entwives,39jhfh,imeuru,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"Aaaaaaah well in that case, you need to get yourself on a low dose niacin regimen...250 mg once a day for the next week or two, stop one week before the test. Drink toooons of fluid, it doesnt matter what kind, as long as its water based. Cut the amount of fat in your diet down by half at least and Excercise! Sweat! Sauna!  Stop all of this except the fat intake one week before the test so you dont push anything into your system at the last minute. Do not smoke and do not drink alcohol until after the test.  Now for the most important part....buy a home test and take it three days before the test, if you can, get a two pack and take the first test without diluting. If you fail, take the other test while diluting, if you still fail, have some clean or fake pee as a backup.  I am sure you are aware that herb takes anywhere from 0-45 days to clear your system, but it depends on how much thc is built up/clinging in your fat cells, and how much fat you have. A skinny person with a high metabolism that only smokes on the weekends is probably clean by friday night. On the other hand, a fat person with a slow metabolism that smokes weed every day for a year would probably take at least 30 days to be clean. My first cleanse took me about 35 days and I am athletic with light padding. I also smoked weed every day for 15 years or so.  EDIT: If you need to dilute to pass be sure to take the creatine three days prior to give it time to metabolize, do not forget the b-12 for color, and do not go overboard!!!  CAUTION: Do not take the niacin and sauna at the same time! Even that low dose might be too much in a sauna. I prefer to take the niacin right before I go to bed, so if I get burny I'm already asleep.    Source: I was once a corporate lackey and I've had to take pre emp, and dept. of transportation drug tests all on relatively short notice...passed them all!"

We lingered over our meal, came home after dark (so naughty), and he coached me through smoking. I had never tried any drugs, I'd literally never even touched a cigarette. But I wanted to try it because I heard that it was helping people with similar problems. (Lupus, fibromyalgia, etc.)  It smelled bad. Tasted bad. Burned my throat. And I just got a little tingly in my body, not high. Not a great first experience.   I tried it a few days later and my body actually felt good for the first time in almost eight years. I tried more and it took away all of my pain for 4 hours!  Now (six-ish months later) I use pretty much everyday. It's given me my life back. I'm able to go out, go for walks, go exploring, go on car rides, go grocery shopping, do things for fun. Before I could only go out once a week at most, and that was only to go to doctor appointments. Since then I've lost sixty pounds, re-learned how to walk with my hip not out-turned, gotten a hell of a lot happier, and now I've finally got insurance again, so I'm hoping between weed and doctors I can get my lupus somewhat under control.   I don't have any sibs to smoke with, and since I was a ""good girl"" before I don't know if any of my current friends smoke too, and I can't get up the courage to ask. I'd like to smoke with someone other than SO sometimes. I've never done it with anyone other than him. Because of my lupus I live at home and although my dad is okay with pot, my mom isn't.

entwives,39a1ln,bearcatburrito,2,Thu Jun 11 23:09:50 2015 UTC,"I was 20 (2011) the first time I tried it. I coughed a lot and didn't really like the experience. The first time I ever got high was a year and a half later (by then I was 22). Both were with friends, though different people.   I didn't smoke with my older brother until a few months after that, and my dad a while again after. I was really glad I waited until I did to try it. I was also really glad my family members were not the ones to introduce it to me. I love smoking with them, but I feel like trees are something you have to discover and learn to love on your own. I also think it's better to wait until adulthood (no offense to you, OP, or anyone who tried it early on.) I view it like alcohol where you're supposed to wait, and so even kids who tried drinking when they were younger didn't start drinking around their parents until they were an acceptable age to do so.   If I had a sibling who was much younger, I wouldn't want them to be smoking until they were close to the legal age in one of the legal states, because I feel like it's more socially acceptable then. I do feel like trees definitely affected my brain, and would have had an even stronger impact on me had I tried them earlier on. I believe the studies that say it impairs some development in teens, even though many studies are scare tactics.  I'm not trying to judge you for starting when you were 13, though, I swear. I do think that even if your sister starts doing it at that age, and you find out about it, you should wait until she's much older to do it with her. Just like how you might refrain from buying a 13 year old alcohol and drinking with them, even if you drank it at that age.  So anyway, wow this is long, TL;DR: I think you should wait until she's older and has discovered it herself to do it with her. Treat it like you would alcohol."

I want to go on a trip with my husband for the first time and that's something we both want and need for our relationship. My 1 year anniversary of being married is on Saturday and we have reservations at a fancy restaurant we've never been to before so that's cool. I've kind of just been dealing with the ssa a lot the past month or so and I'm glad I don't have to call them anymore for a while. (I hope). Toking with my hubs now and getting excited for our sofa we've been paying off for 5 months thats going to be delivered tomorrow by my weed guy along with some new meds.

entwives,398pyd,DodgyBollocks,3,Wed Jun 10 10:58:00 2015 UTC,"patience is key when applying. They usually deny everyone on the first try, so you need to appeal the decision and then wait for the response. Always make sure to get them whatever papers they need by the deadline. If they deny the appeal then request a hearing. That's when you would want to get a lawyer. The wait for the hearing is usually 3-9 months. The lawyer takes their fee from the back pay you would be owed so you don't have to pay unless you win. The hearing was casual and not as intimidating as I expected it to be. The lawyer was able to tell that I most likely had won the case after the hearing, but I still had to wait another 2 months to get the decision letter, then another month before I got any money. It took forever and a lot of patience and persistence but it's worth it if you can't work due to mental illness. They need to see that you have been getting treatment for your disabilities. It's much harder if you haven't been able to get consistent healthcare but that's taken into consideration during the hearing. I wish you luck. Get started as soon as possible so that you've got the show on the road."

But it's good that you found a place where you can get yourself comfortable back on your feet, I'm so happy for you!   And I understand taking time off because of depression. I just went to college and overworked myself, pushing myself harder than I should. I realized I wasn't enjoying myself so I quit while my parents sent me some of their tax refund (so thankful for them, they're the best). I got a very low paying job at a mom and pop antique store that opened up in a cool part of town, and it's really low maintenance so it's been good for my depression.   So even though it's low paying and only part time, if we're anything alike I agree that it's just what you need (:"

Its funny that when you are ""in it"" you feel so alone and like no one could possibly understand your struggle, but in reality everyone has their own struggles and some are the same as yours. It brings me some comfort knowing that.   We can cheer each other on!   I have to turn down a really high stress high paying job today, and it is really hard to do. I feel super guilty because I am choosing me and my health over the extra stability of my family. I am sure it's the right thing to do, but those dollar bills though.. Adulting is rough"

Now, after my first ever performance review (rated 3/5), I got a whole 27 cent raise.  I had a 3 year gap in employment until this job (voluntary - hubby made enough money, then quit the vocation and we restarted our lives) and it was sketchy before that.  I got hired even though I was overqualified.  I stuck out shit hours for just a few months and now I'm getting paid more.  I've been employed since last July.  My life is awesome.   I'm still clumsy though.  I fell down literally in the middle of the road while walking my overly excited dog.  I'm a bit sore and scraped."

Well actually we'll probably cook at home because of food allergies, but he can get wax! Woop!   I'm doing my first sewing project on my new sewing machine and the bias tape around the curved skirt is a bitch. It's kind of at a stand still at the moment because...  Our AC should be fixed tomorrow, which is good seeing as its supposed to stay at 100F for a few more days and my German Shepherd still doesn't like his baby pool. I love being in a house that's 85-90F inside. Not.  Best news of the week though, my boyfriend is healthy! In the past few months, he's lost almost 30 lbs. It's super freaky because now we both weigh near 150lbs, I'm 5'6"" and he's 6'3"". Now he gets nearly 4000 extra calories via these not too nasty protein shakes.   We have the same laundry days!

Honestly, I think pinning everything together is harder than sewing it. I got some books from the library and my mom is insanely good at it. I've made things over the last 13 years, but like 1 every 2 years. The patterns are $5 to $15, but they're reuseable. Lots of the little things you need are pretty cheap, but it adds up. Fabric scizzors (how the fuck do you spell that?) Are kind of pricey and you can ONLY use it on fabric. My machine is a Brother that was like $500, but WE GOT IT ON SALEEEEEEE! There are much more reasonable ones though; I got mine as a present. I'm expecting to spend about $200 on materials for my first quilt though :/ gotta save up."

entwives,398pyd,BrittTheBrat,3,Thu Jun 11 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"LONG rant incoming!  I'm currently at my gran's house with my mom. My gran passed away the day after memorial day and we came down to her place (a couple of hours away) to do the memorial for her and get some of her things in order. My uncle has been living in her house for years and since we have lots of obligations and he doesn't he always comes up to visit us. Turns out why, we knew the house was messy but it's like a hoarder house! We've spent 90% of our time here since thursday cleaning the house and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I would LOVE a smoke right now to take the edge off but hard cider is the best I can get at the moment so that's been my night time relief.  I'm sad my gran is gone but I'm even sadder with the state my uncle has left her house in. Nothing has been repaired and his idea of fixing things is duct taping it together and hoping it stays. He says he doesn't have money to fix the gate or the yard or get the house painted but spends money on shoes and clothes and tons of things he doesn't need. If I sold off just the shoes still in boxes that he hasn't worn that are spread around the house I could pay for most of the things that need to be done but it's not my place to sell them. We're going home today and I feel like I've barely made a dent in the mess and it feels so hopeless. I know it won't make a difference, it'll be back to a wreck while we're gone and unless he wants to change there is nothing I can do to make him tidy up. This whole time mom and I have been cleaning like crazy he has done zero to help, we even bought the cleaning supplies.  I wish I had time to come back down and fix all the shit around the house but I can't afford it unless he feels like feeding me while I'm here. I want to work on the yard so badly and get it back to the way my gran liked it :("

I was going to check to see where you're at so maybe I could give you some meds and help pitch in around the house, but I'm glad to see you're going home today. Be kind to yourself, you're doing the best you can with what you're dealt right now. Hugs"
entwives,398pyd,ashmagic487,2,Wed Jun 10 16:30:13 2015 UTC,"I so relate to all of this! My grandma and grandpa lived together with my aunt and cousins (it's a pretty big house). It's absolutely a hoarder house but it has been my whole life. None of them have enough money or energy to sell or clean the place up. And now a few weeks ago my grandpa passed away and so it's been difficult knowing hes gone, the house is a mess, and now my grandma is alone because everyone moved out around the same time:/ I understand the struggle of wanting to clean up and help and not being able to, and I'm sorry your uncle is being so shitty, my uncle is the same way.  You can get through this girl <3"

My life isn't amazing right now, but I'm still alive, which counts for something.   Trying to find an apartment with my ent before our lease ends in July, coming up with next to nothing, but still hopeful on that front.  My ent was driving my car, which I only bought 6 months ago, and he found a break where my coolant is, so it can't be driven without overheating. Garage won't even look at it until Friday, let alone having it fixed. My 40 minute commute to and from work is now much more challenging. Let alone the improv show and practice I'm slated to get to this weekend  Finally, I recently lost an old friend to heroin, and feel pretty rocked by it. We were friends in middle school, and lost touch through high school and some college. It wasn't until a year and a half ago that we started talking again. She had been in a lot of abusive relationships, and was homeless for almost a year in the worst parts of my city. We both knew how much she wanted to be clean, but  when she texted me to see if I'd drive her to the methadone clinic 2 hours away I flaked. I'm playing over instances like that and wondering if anything would have changed if I helped her."

entwives,396cvv,texanprincess429,5,Tue Jun 9 16:02:56 2015 UTC,"Here's Norml's review of scientific literature of pot smoking during pregnancy. Dr. Dreher's study in particular seems to indicate that cannabis consumption is not harmful during pregnancy. A lot of studies that say marijuana use is bad during pregnancy don't account for tobacco and alcohol use, which makes the studies mostly useless. It probably won't hurt your child at all. In fact, iIrc, Dreher's study indicated some potential benefits. On the other hand, you do need to look into the legal ramifications if you're caught using for any reason. Women who stop using drugs when they find out they're pregnant are sometimes arrested when they go to get child care. Take a long time to think about it and be careful."
entwives,396cvv,abhainn13,4,Tue Jun 9 17:15:27 2015 UTC,"I did not use at all while pregnant. But....  I honestly think that cannabis would be far safer then some of the other medications I take.  I don't know where you are, but I don't know a state that doesn't drug test moms. In California by law they have to drug test mom before delivery or else they test baby. My Heath group gets the blood drug test done and out of the way the first trimester.  For me it comes down risk factors, I feel the risk is too high of getting caught and the natural consequences of being caught (loosing custody of your baby) is too high for me."
entwives,396cvv,PeacefulTreeLand,5,Tue Jun 9 16:26:27 2015 UTC,"Just something to think about here: if you've smoked in the past ~5 years, there will be cannabinoids in your breast milk regardless of whether you've abstained for the past 6-9 months. THC is stored in fat, which is metabolized to make breast milk. So I'm not saying you should definitely smoke during that time if you're not comfortable with it - do what feels right - but you won't be changing the composition of your breast milk much by not smoking."
entwives,396cvv,Mechiko,3,Tue Jun 9 16:38:32 2015 UTC,"I would advise avoid all unnecessary substances when you're pregnant.  Be it herbal, chemical, medicinal, etc.  The bottom line is that we don't know what amounts of what substances are safe or unsafe, and at what stage of pregnancy.  Your developing baby is too important, and you get one shot at ""growing"" that baby so why jeopardize it?  I say, take a tolerance break for 9 months and have a great time after the baby is born!  Another reason - if the baby is born with something wrong with it, you will ALWAYS blame yourself and wonder if the smoking caused the problem."
entwives,396cvv,SnarkSnout,2,Tue Jun 9 17:40:31 2015 UTC,"I quit when I got pregnant because it's what my husband wanted. His baby too, so I was fine with it. He was concerned because some studies say it's fine, others don't. But the biggest concern was cps.  I know plenty of ladies that smoked durig their pregnancies. They all stopped by 36 weeks. All of their kids turned out great. They know they failed drugs tests at prenatal visits, but they all were clean at birth. I worry about all of my entwife pregnant friends, though, because if they go into preterm labor, it'll be worse. They'll have a baby to worry about and they'll have cps up their butts."

If you're fine with potentially losing your child to the system, go for it. In terms of health, I honestly don't think it's a huge problem, as I've read about people vaping to get over morning sickness."

Based on the pictures you are getting close to your money's worth in product...but of course you are paying a little more for them to ring you new and exciting things.

Maybe you are so blanking drained that your body is using anything it can as an excuse to crash and withdraw from the world?"
entwives,392b2r,Bachstar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:57:40 2015 UTC,"The thing is I'm not exhausted. I sleep plenty, my job isn't draining, overall I don't do anything that is particularly energy depriving.   I smoke before playing video games or watching shows. Mostly I feel pretty good before smoking. And I feel pretty good for the first 30 minutes or so after smoking. But then my eye lids get heavy and I just wanna fall asleep and I lack energy to move or do anything.  I hear people feel a difference in sativa and indica highs and I so wish I could. No matter what I try (and I'm in a legal state so I know what I'm getting) it all feels like the exact same high. :/"
entwives,392b2r,TistedLogic,4,Mon Jun 8 20:34:26 2015 UTC,"I do find that I experience the difference in a sativa v indica high more if I'm engaging in the activities that are enhanced by one or the other.    Meaning that if I smoke some sativa and then start cleaning my house, next thing I know I'm dancing around the apt, singing with whatever music is playing and in general feeling full of energy & euphoria.  Or if I start doing something creative, I get more enthusiastic & sucked into whatever I'm doing.  Whereas if I smoke an indica and then go sit on my couch to watch TV, I generally get the mellow, lazy couchlock thing going.  Sometimes that makes me sleepy & super unmotivated, but it's usually intentional on my part.    I tend to use sativas during the day and indicas at night, so my body's kind of conditioned to respond to sativas as ""get up and go"" and indicas as ""nightynight time.""  Since you're in a legal state, you may want to just talk to your budtender next time you're in the dispensary and tell them that you're looking for something that won't knock you out, probably sativa-dominant, but you've noticed even sativas make you really drowsy.    A good budtender should be able to steer you towards a variety that's less sleep-inducing. I find that really strong sativas also make me paranoid & jittery, but it's all based on chemistry and your body chemistry might just work better with strong sativas."

In terms of the coconut oil, I weigh out my AVB, and use 10-20% of that weight of soy lecithin. I melt coconut oil and cover the herb. In a crock pot I heat up water to put the jar/jars in. Remember that your mixture is in the jar and heat it in the water for 5+ hours on low. (Last batch I did I let steep overnight on the keep warm setting.) After it cooks down, strain and bake or put it in whatever. I'm having a coconut buttered rum with it while the bread bakes.   I find that the ABV edibles in general are less potent than I'd like, even with the soy lecithin ( available on amazon and increases bioavailability of cannabanoids) but makes a nice mellow buzz. Of course this differs from person to person. The last batch of cookies I made, a bite was enough for my SO while I was consuming 1.5 cookies to float and focus nicely.  If you search trees and the AVB/ABV and treecipes sub's, there will be other suggestions too."

If it can be smelled, you can't tell where it is coming from.  Get the Smokebuddy, it is worth the $20.   The neighborhood deadbeats live nextdoor to me, I like them but well general society does not, it is pretty obvious when they are smoking because you can hear them coughing up a lung non stop. That gives it away more then the smell! So I would say keep things closed up while you smoke, then once you are down, open windows and turn on vent and then go to a different part of the house.

It will help a lot, and venting to an impartial person who is willing to listen and give advice is so helpful. I'm about to turn 23 and moved out at 19. It's not easy out there but I also understand that living with someone who has mood swings and is heavily medicated is definitely not easy.   That being said, she needs to accept that you're an adult now. You might try and sitting down with both your mom and dad and try to have a discussion. I know family talks are never easy, but this is important. You need to tell her how you're feeling and what you think might help make it better. You should have your bf there for support if they like him.   My best friend went through something similar with her mom over the winter except my friends mom kicked her out and she ended up staying with me for three months.

entwives,38jxwn,imeuru,3,Fri Jun 5 15:49:47 2015 UTC,"Older (30) Entwife reporting! I stayed with my mother FAR longer than I wanted or expected to. Due to the cost of living in my hometown (SF) it's not uncommon for people to live with their parents for a longer period however my mother's behavior, expectations and general hatefulness made it impossible to make it work. While I was stuck there I did a couple of things that made my stay a little easier:  *Minimize her control but minimizing your dependence on her- My mother used to lord the fact that she was the primary on my phone account over me and I hated. I turned that anger into drive to take that chip away from her. By saving and working extra hours I was able to get my own. I didn't even tell her. When she saw I didn't need her for that she stopped complaining about it.   Build a life outside of that house- I was lucky being in a major city and having a good social group. I always went out, even to the library to avoid being home. The longer I was out of her grasp of power the better I felt. Seek out free places to go and study, even hang out if it keeps you from having to be around her. Treat yourself to weekends away in hotels when able- Every month I'd book myself a weekend at some motel or inn then disappear. No contact, no checking in with my mother, nothing. You'd be surprised how much better you feel and how little things will hurt you when you have a couple of days away to reevaluate things. Use the summer to work extra hours and begin your savings for a studio- I'm not going to recommend you find a place with your boyfriend because he doesn't need to be the means of your escape. You have to do it for and by yourself It's harsh and it's hard but you don't want to go from being dependent on your parents to being dependent on your partner with no breathing room in between. If you guys break up and he moves out you'll be ass out and back to square one.    Also look into renting a room in a private house, living with roommates or overnight care for someone with disabilities. I was able to find a job where I got paid to sleep at my clients house 5 days a week. It really helped me avoid my mother's home. I really sympathize with you OP and wishing you a speedy escape from your unhappy situation. Everyone deserves to have a home they want to be in."

I actually just had a fight with my parents yesterday about it because the title is still under my mom's name. She ""promised"" she wouldn't use it against me but promises are easily broken in my house.. But I'm basically doing pretty much everything you suggested.. We love getting away from home, but I have bearded dragons (one who is very sick) that need a lot of attention, so we can't really stay anywhere for more than a day :/ we're working on finding ways to save money so we can get a place, and we've been talking to friends that also want to get away to hopefully get a place together.

entwives,38jxwn,Unicornucopias,2,Fri Jun 5 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"I have advice but it kinda depends on your mom. What is her disability? Does she need assistance in living? Can she live on her own, assuming money wasn't an issue? Has the government ruled she is disabled and therefore she gets disability payments and medical insurance? Does she have any other family, a sister or brother?  So there are ways to get you and your dad out, but I have a feeling mom's disability is hanging over you all. That's why I am asking those questions about mom."
entwives,38jxwn,Zixxer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:57:49 2015 UTC,"She just started receiving disability. She's got fibomyalgia and a whole lot of other issues. She can get around fine and I'm almost positive she makes it out to be a bit worse than it is. She's got my boyfriends family believing that she's totally helpless, when even he knows she's not. She's threatened to speak to social services because we supposedly leave her alone and don't feed her, but there's almost always someone home and we offer to help all the time. I almost want social services to come just so they can tell her she's nuts..."
entwives,38jxwn,Fozism,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:48:33 2015 UTC,"Ok, this is really good news! The fact that she is receiving disability takes a lot of the burden off of you and your dad. This means that if she ends up on her own, the government has already legally agreed to take care of her. She will only be on the streets if she chooses too.   Here is the thing, chronic pain changes you and it can make you a horrible person. Long term opiate use will lead to horrible behavior. I say this so that you maintain some level of empathy here. On a very real level, she is as sick as she makes it out to be. It is just there are a lot of things she could do to make daily living better, and she isnt.   You need to sit your Dad down and talk to you and ask him what the long term plan is. Dont like him say I dont know or we will figure it out. Say ""I dont like how mom is treating you or me, I dont know how we can go on like this for years""  My suggestion is that you and your dad work out a game plan and that plan includes best case and worst case. If you want to give your mom one more chance, then you both need to lay out to her that you expect her to go to family therapy and angry management classes. If not, then she needs to leave.  Tell your dad it is okay for him to divorce your mom. Tell him that if he does that you want to keep living with him and be supportive.   Start calling around until you find a group home or assist living that takes medicare. Tell your mom that if she doesnt change the way she is treating everyone then Dad will divorce her and we are not worried about social services because we have already called all these places who accept medicaid disability. If she cant live on her own she can live there, but she cant live with you! (Again, why it is awesome she is officially disabled) You and your Dad do not have to leave, she does.  Ok, all that tough love aside, I will tell you this. I have fibromyalgia and while it is horrible and I fully think it is completely disabling, the government does not fully agree yet. Which means she was most likely labeled as disabled for a different reason, means she is so bad she has something that got her full disability AND fibro on top of that. Her brain is on fire from the sensory overload, I am not shocked at all she is acting out. Is there anyway you can look at re-arranging the house and telling her why. Look, you are not nice to live with but we love you. The master room and bath is all yours, the guest room is all Dads and you stay out of there. We are now all roomates. Which means if you want to be mean or yell at people you can go to your room. Set up a sitting area with a TV for her in there.   You need to stand up to her, and I give you permission."
entwives,38jxwn,imeuru,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"I seriously have tried all of that. At the end of the day, my dad gets sick of dealing with the shit, kisses her ass, and things end up in her favor. I understand her disabilities, I've grown up essentially without a mom and have watched her deteriorate over the past 9 or so years... Its hard on me, but I honestly don't feel anything for her anymore because she literally doesn't do anything for herself. She's learned to be helpless and it drives me crazy. She ONLY drinks soda. And I mean plain old coke. Literally at least 5+ cans a day. She's been a smoker since she was a kid, and even though my grandmother (her mom) just died of lung cancer, she won't give it up. She doesn't exercise like the doctor tells her to, she lies to the doctor and says she's drinking more water and smoking less... I've had heart to hearts with my dad, we've confronted her multiple times and it's always ""you guys are ganging up on me it's always my fault blah blah blah"" and somehow my dad gives in, and I become the asshole when I get fed up with his wishy-washy crap.
