It'll be two years in a few weeks.  I was not aware of this letter template when I went about trying to get the charge expunged. Maybe it will work? But, if I were you, I would attend your first hearing that is listed on your citation.  There you will speak with the public defender assigned to your cases. They'll know the process like the back of their hand. You will talk with them there about the ""deferment program."" That is what it is called. They don't simply expunge your record. You'll have to agree to an alcohol education course, at least 20 hours of community service and a clean record for 6 months. Ask any questions you have about the program now, ask them about applicable places to preform your community service and ask where you have to take your class at. Get your attorney's contact information because it may be useful later.  They'll have you sign some paperwork and the attorney will speak with the judge. As long as your complete what your assigned, they'll take the PAULA off your record and you don't have to pay the fine (you still have to pay for the court fees and the alcohol course fee, but it's still cheaper than the fine.)  P.S. Come to your court appearance prepared and wearing some presentable clothes. PM me if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to help. PAULAs suck, but good luck!"

I was charged on (date) with (crime). 2. On (date) said charge was dismissed/verdict of not-guilty, and any and all statute of limitations has tolled as to the re-filing of said charge. 3.

Don't get me wrong there are some ""cool"" trails but I don't think they will span more than a mile or two, I could be wrong. Isn't the whole place 6,500 acres? The trails looked very well groomed and open. I'm sure if there was any rain conditions could be mildly muddy and maybe in a few spots sloppy suck your foot to the bottom of the earth mud. All in all the park is very well maintained. I think the perfect trifecta for me at brushy is kayaking, fishingand mountain biking. I love to hike too I just didn't get the feeling that I would be as interested. I'm also spoiled with outdoor stuff. I've hiked all over the USA. Have you checked out southern Illinois? It sounds like you would be interested in the river to river trail! An amazing hike! Panthers Den is my favorite place on that trail. Also I recommend going in winter when the bugs/ticks are not present though it is completely doable in the summer just hotter and more spiders  Edit: from their webpage looks like there is plenty of trails! TRAILS With approximately 50 miles of multi-use trails, there are trail activities for everyone including horseback riding, hiking, snowmobiling, cross country skiing, and mountain biking. Mountain biking is allowed on all multiple use trails. A map of these trails is on display at the information kiosks located in the equestrian campgrounds. When using the multi-use trail system: 1) Always call ahead (515)543-8298 for current trail conditions 2) Stay on designated trails only 3) Respect others' trail rights, 4) Report any trail problems to park staff, and 5) Enjoy!"

Also: I don't live in Iowa anymore. I live in Venice, CA which is very bike friendly with lanes and paths all over. LA tries to be bike friendly but there are still deaths/accidents almost daily.  I don't know why you guys downvoted me, I'm advocating for more bike lanes because drivers aren't suddenly going start driving safer/better."

If there is room to pass me, I hug the right. If it is unsafe to pass, hugging the right encourages drivers to pass unsafely - a lot of accidents happen this way. If I'm blocking a couple cars, and a good passing opportunity isn't coming up, I often hop onto the shoulder to let folks through.   I think the perceived annoyance of driving behind a biker, (even for an abhorrently long time, like two whole minutes) is FAR greater than any actual impact on travel times.  The biggest problem I have with your attitude is that you seem to think that the behavior of others somehow makes my healthy, legally protected, environmentally friendly way of getting around unacceptable.

Personally I would love to ride my bike around LA but I know the statistics and I've seen firsthand how shitty and inattentive people are when they drive (I got hit by a car while jogging, person didn't look right and was turning right) I'm not saying the current situation is right but a person should definitely consider if riding their bike on busy roads daily is worth the risk of their life just for some exercise and emitting less pollution. People aren't going to become more responsible with driving so something else needs to be done to mitigate risks.  There should be more bike lanes, but at the same time would it be worth Iowa's time and money to invest in them? You can only ride a bike so many days of the year due to winter and rain.

Either way, I'm not a hobbyist biker and I'm sure people who do bike, love to be on the open road, i would just hope they know the risks.

I find bicycle lanes terrifying.  Give me a road any day.  Lastly, RAGBRAI doesn't increase the risk of anything other than cyclist-to-cyclist collisions.  RAGBRAI's quantity of riders takes up an entire road or highway; there aren't any vehicles that travel on a RAGBRAI route aside from those who may live on those roads.  On a day of RAGBRAI last year, over 107 miles, 1 vehicle came down the road...at about 4 miles per hour because of the quantity of cyclists."

Iowa,3dswf0,spawny3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:00:31 2015 UTC,I believe Yellow River is the only place in Iowa that allows camping outside of designated campsites. If that's what was meant by hike in camping then spawny3's answer is the only correct one.   *edit to add:  I believe Hawkeye Area Council will rent out campsites at scout camps on a daily basis. I don't know if you have to have scouting history but I would check this option out because we have many beautiful campgrounds that are set aside for scouting and on the right weekend you may be the only person for miles.
Iowa,3dswf0,Fweebers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:05:38 2015 UTC,"camping outside of designated campsites.   You can camp at wildlife management areas and some various other county parks here and there that don't have designated areas.  However; you have to follow leave no trace, which makes having a campfire difficult."

They said they would not build it because it would add quadrillions to the national debt, and they asked why they would spend countless taxpayer dollars on a station with a fatal flaw that can be exploited by a one-man spacecraft. Among other excuses.  Personally, I see the lack of Death Star construction as one of the Obama administration's greatest failures.

Iowa,3di56f,Audpaudge,5,Thu Jul 16 13:58:19 2015 UTC,"Oasis (Greek food) in Iowa City   Okay, first, Oasis is Mediterranean/Israeli, not Greek. Second, go to Oasis. Get the falafel, get the fries, get the white cabbage and the orange sauce (mango) and the green sauce (slightly spicy) from the condiments bar next to the pop machine.   I have been to Israel and elsewhere in the region, where falafel was invented and is everywhere. I now live in the Detroit metro, which has the largest Arab population in the world outside of Southwest Asia. I have still never had falafel that comes anywhere close the quality found at Oasis. It's mystifying, frankly, but I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. Go get yourself some falafel and fries (I am not joking about the fries- a half order for one person, a full order for two hungry people) and rejoice."
Iowa,3di56f,ornryactor,2,Thu Jul 16 17:46:38 2015 UTC,If you live in the Detroit metro area now and want amazing falafel go to Jerusalem Garden in Ann Arbor. I like it better than Oasis.

Don't get me wrong, there's a whole ton of falafel that falls into the ""pretty dang good"" category when held up against Oasis, but like I said, nothing has come close. The best I've found is Haifa Falafel on the A2/Ypsi border (on Washtenaw Ave). I rarely get out to Ann Arbor, but I'll make sure to add Jerusalem Garden to my list. Thanks for the suggestion!"

It is wholly unreasonable that a mini-chain with two locations in Phoenix and two in Iowa City has amazing wings, but truth is stranger than fiction.  The Iowa City location is a little place on the southeast edge of downtown and is very much a dive-ish bar setting. The Coralville location is much larger, with ample parking, and is the one most people know; it's easily accessible from the highway if you're trying to get in/out quickly, and is much more of a restaurant/tavern setting, though still with a solid bar atmosphere."

Iowa,3di56f,Crumps,3,Thu Jul 16 20:48:57 2015 UTC,"I do this drive often.  First point...make sure you eat and gas up before entering northern MO, it is a desolate place.  For food, Mason City I would say Suzie Q for classic diner experience, the Quarry for something a little nicer, Bill's BBQ for ribs. You can also see a ton of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, including his only hotel that is still standing. Birdsall's Ice Cream is killer as well.  In fact, if you take 65 from Albert Lea to Mason, you could also go through Northwood and got up Mr. Taco, which is awesome authentic (like most employees don't speak English) Mexican.  Charles City has an amazing little hidden gem called 3 C's Bistro.  Waverly has the East Bremer Diner, and a great outdoor store called Crawdaddy Sports.  Cedar Falls has a great Main Street, no killer restaurants tho.   Waterloo I'm not as familiar with.  Cedar Rapids, I would say the place to go would be New Bo City Market, there are some great restaurants in there. Across the river is Czech Village, there is a Smokehaus type place (can't recall the name) that has amazing smoked meatloaf.  Iowa City....there are others who have much greater familiarity.  But really, stop and get gas in Donnellson, IA. There is a Casey's right there and there isn't a good place for gas for long time. Times I've made the trip I've generally been without cell service for hours at a time and have even lost radio. Like no stations at all.  Hannibal, MO is kinda a neat town to check out.

Iowa,3de51f,wildbill_hicok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:56:13 2015 UTC,Yes sir! Well spotted!
Iowa,3de51f,Hawk_Biz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:46:48 2015 UTC,Couple pics gave it away...
Iowa,3de51f,ladieaupair,3,Wed Jul 15 17:52:44 2015 UTC,Last photo: the man should be eating Casey's pizza not drinking Casey's coffee.
Iowa,3de51f,Torqueso,3,Wed Jul 15 17:57:13 2015 UTC,The Can Shed bag was the most Iowa thing about all of this.
Iowa,3de51f,boobyfartzz,3,Wed Jul 15 18:13:26 2015 UTC,These are just lovely!
Iowa,3de51f,dwightnight,2,Wed Jul 15 21:15:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks! :)"
Iowa,3de51f,mtutty,3,Wed Jul 15 23:59:43 2015 UTC,I love it.
Iowa,3de51f,Houston_Pipefitter,5,Thu Jul 16 00:57:27 2015 UTC,Thanks boobyfarts!
Iowa,3de51f,JQuick,3,Thu Jul 16 00:46:43 2015 UTC,Nice job. I'm driving up Saturday from FLA to spend a week taking care of sick parents.  I'll snap some with my phone and post on this thread as well.  You're pretty much spot on with what I remember growing up there. On Iowa.
Iowa,3de51f,Slette,2,Thu Jul 16 00:57:36 2015 UTC,"With the exception of #14, you nailed it.  I feel like I have been to every one of those pics."
Iowa,3de51f,DHDH1983,2,Thu Jul 16 01:46:26 2015 UTC,I'm going to miss Iowa when I leave. I'm up here for work and this state is filled with so much bliss.
Iowa,3de51f,nrith,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:17:32 2015 UTC,Plastic bag in a tree. Classic.
Iowa,3dgcrw,danwin,5,Thu Jul 16 01:33:14 2015 UTC,"I'll be there. Third year. First time was in '94 when I was 17. Second was two years ago, when I piloted a blind paralympian across the state on a tandem.   This year it's myself and a friend.  As a 17 year old, I did it with no training. As a 36 year old, I wasn't planning on it until two weeks prior but had over a thousand miles in by that time.   I have 1200 miles on my bike this year, but you'll be fine if you have half that, provided you've been doing 30-50 mile rides."
Iowa,3dgcrw,jondthompson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:43:31 2015 UTC,"I might have half that many miles in my 30+ year lifespan. Hopefully that works...  Although but seriously, I've been putting in 20 mile rides on the gym bike. Not the same I know but I don't have a bike where I live :/"
Iowa,3dgcrw,jondthompson,3,Thu Jul 16 02:43:42 2015 UTC,"What bike are you using?  Go slow. You have 12 hours to get to the next overnight. Even at 10 mph, you can get the karras loop for the century with two hours to spare.  Wear bike shorts and use butt butter. Your ass will thank you by Wednesday.  Don't drink to excess. A saddle is not a good place to nurse a hangover."
Iowa,3dgcrw,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:20:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice...I bought a road bike off of Amazon of medium quality. I've honestly never ridden anything but heavy city bikes and fitness bikes so I'm hoping the bike will feel like a breeze. And yeah, I've been advised about the bike shorts...last thing I need are ass blisters."

Iowa,3dgcrw,sndrsk,3,Thu Jul 16 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"I'll be there as well. This will be my 2nd year, but my first was in 2008.  I think training wise I am better off this time, but I probably could have cut back on the beer training."
Iowa,3dgcrw,Lollipop4point20,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:20:22 2015 UTC,"I'm doing the Storm Lake-Fort Dodge leg, and this is my first time doing RAGBRAI. I've been logging 40-50 mile rides the past few months and I feel pretty confident, especially considering you really have 10-12 hours to get to the next overnight town, and I'm planning on stopping in every town along the way."
Iowa,3ddbvn,LackingAHeart,2,Wed Jul 15 11:20:26 2015 UTC,While that's pretty dumb of the ACLU I'm still not really sure why Van Meter needs a second squad car or multiple police. I still remember the year we didn't have a town cop after ours was arrested for embezzlement. Good times.
Iowa,3ddbvn,mightytwin21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:48:42 2015 UTC,"I thought this was an awesome idea and hoped it would be brought up by closer, localities.  I would love to taze an Iowa City or Marion cop."
