TDK,3d3zq4,Prof_Ghibli,3,Mon Jul 13 09:54:19 2015 UTC,I just hope we can avoid Auto-Rel :( I really do hate the system working this way.
TDK,3d3zq4,ManiacL,3,Mon Jul 13 22:10:19 2015 UTC,Auto relegation really isn't that bad.  At least the team members can play with each other more.
TDK,3d3zq4,Pinkuu,3,Tue Jul 14 01:35:05 2015 UTC,"Even if we should get auto-relegated I will support this team anyways. The first few weeks was maybe too tough for Seraph/Kez and now there is no time to define their own style.  None the less I hope until the end of the split, we avoid Auto-Relegation and play against Team Imagine or something (just not Team Coast or Renegades). I want to see Seraph on Worlds 2016.   #TDKFighting #SeraphIsACarryToplaner"

TDK,3ck1rs,Lerry17,2,Wed Jul 8 14:54:52 2015 UTC,"If they just forget about the league pressure and calmly play their game, they could compete for number 1. I think Ninja and Emperor have been going for big, risky plays, and that the team will be better when they stop taking as many big risks."
TDK,3cazif,Lerry17,2,Mon Jul 6 14:28:16 2015 UTC,The expectations that TDK should focus on is playing and winning 1 game at a time.
TDK,3cazif,USN_Kopian,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:50:49 2015 UTC,I just don't see this team winning against TL CLG TiP. T8 and C9 are the only opponents we have to beat

TDK,3c53yf,Waex,2,Sat Jul 4 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"If TDK can win the rest of their games, they will be 7-11. That means either CLG AND/OR TIP would have to lose the rest of their games because both teams are 7-5 and can finish 7-11 if possible. If either or both of those teams lose all games and TDK somehow wins the rest of their games, then TDK can force a tie breaker with either or both of those teams.  TDK WILL NOT go to playoffs if CLG AND TIP wins at least 1 more game OR TDK loses 1 more game  I could be wrong, but that's all I know for now."
TDK,3c53yf,USN_Kopian,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:29:14 2015 UTC,Wait so we just need CLG to lose the rest of their games ?? I like our chances ...

TDK,3c53yf,ktriangle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:24:49 2015 UTC,"The best Score TDK can achieve is 8-10.  The first playoff spot is Place 6, TIP is on atm with a record of 6-5.   So if TIP wins 3 more games and all above them at least 2 it is impossible to make playoffs.   I think it should not be the goal to reach playoffs after that Season.  The maingoal should be to get the 7th Place this Split and go for Playoffs next season.   This is much more possible and the potential of this roster is really huge.  P.S. I'm happy for the performance yesterday.  You have to mention this was the second game the full roster played on stage against the best team in the league."
TDK,3c43m8,WindAeris,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:11:34 2015 UTC,i hope TDK can pull off the win but if they cant i just hope they can show they can stand up to teams like TSM

TDK,3bg721,sterninator39,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:13:58 2015 UTC,That was amazing. I'm new to the LCS and LoL as a whole and I recently chose TDK as my team because I wanted to follow a team that was rebuilding. Watching their new lineup beat Dignitas pretty well was great.

TDK,3b9wnp,ZH_Sparky,37,Sat Jun 27 04:34:37 2015 UTC,Might as well lose the bans seeing the results
TDK,3b9wnp,Mataresian,3,Sat Jun 27 09:21:54 2015 UTC,Why has tdk always lost bans? I understood for the first 2 weeks... but now?
TDK,3b9wnp,StephentheGinger,2,Sat Jun 27 16:23:14 2015 UTC,maybe same happened with mancloud + paperwork?
TDK,3b9wnp,mtstar2007,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:36:24 2015 UTC,They will lose their bans if they decide to put Emperor and Ninja in the team for this week as they are too late to declare them as players for this week.
TDK,3b9wnp,Mataresian,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:40:37 2015 UTC,What about last week though?
TDK,3b9wnp,StephentheGinger,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:43:03 2015 UTC,They changed their sub roster and didn't give the papers in quick enough again
TDK,3b9wnp,JDC31,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:20:12 2015 UTC,"I think the situation was pretty much that each week they planned on having Emperor and Ninja and when they were unable to get into the country, they changed their roster to the subsquad at the last second, angering the Riot gods and losing bans."
TDK,3b9wnp,UnrealBlackout,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:33:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Honestly, losing bans isn't that important. It's only slightly important if you're red side, denying blue side that all important first pick if there is a champion that's incredibly OP in general or one that the opponent has been practicing a lot. I think it would actually start hurting when Riot increases the bans to maybe about 5, where bans can have a much more greater affect when it comes to strategy where as now, it's very highly dependent on simply which champions you pick because 3 bans per side is easy to work around if both teams are versatile."
TDK,3b9wnp,PotatoPotential,3,Sat Jun 27 11:49:30 2015 UTC,"5 bans with more rules to them I hope, it wouldn't be fun for anyone if 10 adc's were to be banned."
TDK,3b9wnp,Mataresian,2,Sat Jun 27 13:20:43 2015 UTC,It might actually make the game more interesting by forcing unconventional carries.  Melee carry botlane the dream
TDK,3b9wnp,Neostopper,0,Sat Jun 27 15:15:11 2015 UTC,"For the new All-Stars event at the end of the year maybe, for conventional play, no just no, there are many more ways to achieve what you are looking for without destroying the whole gameplay."
TDK,3b9wnp,Mataresian,2,Sat Jun 27 16:41:53 2015 UTC,Off-meta = game destroying TIL
TDK,3b9wnp,Silivin,0,Sat Jun 27 18:22:10 2015 UTC,It wouldn't destroy the whole gameplay. It would certainly change how we play but not destroy
TDK,3b9wnp,laxboy119,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:53:07 2015 UTC,"Good point. Didn't think of putting a cap on roles, but definitely a must. What I want to see though is the initial 3 bans, half the picks, then 2 more bans so teams can adjust based on what they think the other team is trying to accomplish. I want more strategy, not just all the OPs banned so we never see them."
TDK,3b9wnp,PotatoPotential,-1,Sat Jun 27 18:47:03 2015 UTC,No.
TDK,3b9wnp,The_Eyesight,18,Sat Jun 27 15:47:19 2015 UTC,TDK is the most experienced team in LoL history at playing without bans. They should give it a try.
TDK,3b9wnp,Horoism,5,Sat Jun 27 10:12:21 2015 UTC,"I think they should just play them regardless.  As much as I love James Lattman, it hasn't given any results."
TDK,3b9wnp,Pinkuu,5,Sat Jun 27 09:25:40 2015 UTC,Theyve already played the majirity of the games without bans. Put them in.

TDK,3b9wnp,marjamrob,3,Sat Jun 27 19:35:10 2015 UTC,I think someone said they already scrimmed with Ninja and Emperor the season so far. I think in the state C9 is right now they maybe have a big chance of winning against them with their full roster. At least the loss of bans means more Power Picks available for both sides.  Sorry for my bad English.
TDK,3b9wnp,Lerry17,2,Sat Jun 27 10:12:23 2015 UTC,"According to smoothie, the team has around 4 hours of practice with their full roster"
TDK,3b9wnp,AlbertF1sh,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:21:18 2015 UTC,I'm asking myself what the Team was doing all the time if they only practiced for 4 hours with the full roster. Because last week seraph said they practiced 1 hour with the subs. I hope will go better from now on. I really want this team to succeed.

TDK,3b9wnp,ResistanceFox,2,Sat Jun 27 16:00:34 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be the most horrible thing if TDK excel with emperor and ninja but still get auto relegated

I think no matter what people think of tdk, the owner, seraph, kez, or alex ich the mostly agree that having a player get screwed despite massive personal improvement and learning English and carrying your team on your back throughout challenger series is pretty crappy."
TDK,3b9wnp,TakeOutTacos,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:19:49 2015 UTC,Atleast they can get their first win today.
TDK,3b9wnp,Diamond1Teemo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:11:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly playing without bans isn't the biggest deal. The other team has to account for the fact that you aren't banning so you loose the chance to ban one players really good champion, but in the process leave up a lot of the OP's that are always auto banned."
TDK,3b9wnp,ProdigalEden,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:33:33 2015 UTC,I still don't understand why they've struggled so much in getting their visa / residency permitted. Can anybody elaborate on what's caused the issues for these two players that other imports did not face?
TDK,3b9wnp,tikotanabi,2,Sat Jun 27 15:46:38 2015 UTC,I believe there were issues with the US Embassy in regards to all visas.
TDK,3b9wnp,Xxzx,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"Since riot pays the players, they need work visas not normal traveling visas which are much more difficult to obtain in a timely matter"
TDK,3b9wnp,tikotanabi,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:18:28 2015 UTC,What I don't understand is why these two particular players are having issues that take soooo much longer than the other player's visas took to get settled.
TDK,3b9wnp,Xxzx,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:15:49 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that they got the wrong kind of visas and had to start the process over again
TDK,3b9wnp,tikotanabi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:21:13 2015 UTC,"Even then they already have another Korean in Seraph who would have to regularly renew his visa at the beginning of each split. Somebody on the team SHOULD have been able to help them understand what they were supposed to be doing whether it be Seraph, management, or Riot Games.   Idk :\ Somebody was sloppy and dropped the ball maybe. What confuses me further is that they played in the Champion Series. >.<"

TDK,3acdse,Regrehtful,6,Thu Jun 18 23:27:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, I would be disappointed, but let's be real here: this wasn't going to be a good split for TDK regardless. Maybe I'll eat my words and they'll pull off a miracle 10-8 or 9-9 run and sneak into playoffs, but avoiding auto-relegation is the main goal here. As long as they can do that, they'll have the rest of this split and the many months between then and the start of spring split to solidify the roster (Ninja is on loan right now), and get some quality synergy going.  Just be patient, and have faith ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)."
TDK,3acdse,Discounted_Eggs,2,Fri Jun 19 07:30:45 2015 UTC,I knew it wouldn't be an amazing split but i had hopes for them to do well (I still have hope) and at least get some good experience as a team. Ninja being a loan is going to be a problem considering they will need a replacement after the split is over.    If I didn't have faith I wouldn't be here.
TDK,3acdse,blitzheart,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:03:03 2015 UTC,"Wrong subreddit bro, but kidding aside, You're right. I hope that Ninja's replacement after the split will have his visa (if he's an import) be fixed before the split.   I can't imagine how frustrated seraph, kez and smoothie to go this far only to be crushed by visa issues."
TDK,3acdse,blitzheart,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"Yea I hope everything will get sorted for next split assuming we dont get auto-relegated.
