kaleycuoco,29zhe4,che85mor,6,Sun Jul 6 20:25:27 2014 UTC,"Snell's law:       Snell's law (also known as the Snell‚ÄìDescartes law and the law of refraction) is a formula used to describe the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction, when referring to light or other waves passing through a boundary between two different isotropic media, such as water, glass and air.  In optics, the law is used in ray tracing to compute the angles of incidence or refraction, and in experimental optics and gemology to find the refractive index of a material. The law is also satisfied in metamaterials, which allow light to be bent ""backward"" at a negative angle of refraction with a negative refractive index.  Although named after Dutch astronomer Willebrord Snellius (1580‚Äì1626), the law was first accurately described by the scientist Ibn Sahl at the Baghdad court in 984. In the manuscript On Burning Mirrors and Lenses, Sahl used the law to derive lens shapes that focus light with no geometric aberrations.

She's only in her early 20s so she's still growing and rounding out.

kaleycuoco,29x7tt,FapNeedsHelp,10,Sat Jul 5 23:25:47 2014 UTC,Or it was for press.
kaleycuoco,29x7tt,dakboy,8,Sat Jul 5 22:06:45 2014 UTC,"Or maybe they just realized that they were romantically incompatible, had different ambitions in life, it was causing problems on the set, or they were otherwise better off just being friends.  The 10 year age gap between them may have been a factor there too. As time goes on, that may not seem significant, but when they started the show she was barely 22 - 10 years is a big gap there."
kaleycuoco,29x7tt,mtrkar,4,Sun Jul 6 17:42:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah, people tend to not realize how much certain age gaps matter. 22 is fun to fuck at 32, but those 10 years are some of the most crucial as far as developing who you are as a person and where you are at 22 might as well be a lifetime away from 32 in most cases."
kaleycuoco,29x7tt,battleship61,3,Tue Jul 8 02:18:08 2014 UTC,Stupid because a relationship ended and they remained friends?

kaleycuoco,29x7tt,dakboy,13,Sun Jul 6 15:25:50 2014 UTC,"He'll have royalty checks that will make seinfeld blush with not even expending a fraction of the effort/talent.   Not. Even. Close.  Seinfeld is estimated to have earned about $400 Million from syndication rights alone.  On top of that, he gets residuals when each episode airs, and more proportionally more than his 3 co-stars, because he's credited as   creator writer producer/executive producer (4 episodes only) story supervisor (oh yeah, almost forgot) star of the show   Not to mention the $1M per episode he was getting at the end of the run when it was still on the air (NBC reportedly offered him $5M to keep going, and he refused).  Nobody will be cashing in like Jerry Seinfeld has for a long, long time. Especially not a single member of a large ensemble cast who has no other credits on that program."
