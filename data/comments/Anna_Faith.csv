Anna_Faith,3czj3g,Just_Ice_Cream,7,Sun Jul 12 05:07:05 2015 UTC,her face is full of unnecessary foundation that it almost looks like it's photoshopped badly.
Anna_Faith,3cx6eo,rhcp88,3,Sat Jul 11 15:51:15 2015 UTC,I think she looks better with more understated makeup; might be the lighting though.

Anna_Faith,3crksp,Just_Ice_Cream,2,Fri Jul 10 05:13:03 2015 UTC,She wears too much makeup

Anna_Faith,3crksp,rhcp88,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:41:39 2015 UTC,How'd you find it?
Anna_Faith,3crksp,rhcp88,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:44:14 2015 UTC,I clicked on your profile after you commented on one of my posts and saw this picture ha.
Anna_Faith,3cl0x1,eXcapiZm,5,Wed Jul 8 19:02:15 2015 UTC,Lexie has nicer eyes and eyebrows.  Is she two years younger than Anna?
Anna_Faith,3cl0x1,mindnumbingfun,10,Wed Jul 8 21:02:47 2015 UTC,"I think Lexie is the prettier of the two. I mean, they're both gorgeous and I'd have a hard time saying one is more attractive overall, but I think Lexie has a nicer face and a nicer smile."
Anna_Faith,3cl0x1,kylekyleson,5,Wed Jul 8 23:48:48 2015 UTC,"It's because I actually think Lexie's smile is more natural and genuine.  Not saying all of Anna's are forced but, well, wasn't there a post here a bit ago talking about Anna suffering depression? Can't remember if it was a post or just a comment but I seem to recall a link to her Twitter or IG where she references depression and someone said that's a part of the reason she uses so much make-up and does the whole dress up thing to make others happy.  For some reason I just don't believe in a lot of her wide smiles and some seem very forced/unnatural. She's gorgeous but, I dunno, the sidebar picture of her sitting with a that small smile seems far more natural and genuine than many of her large smiles. And I think she's far more gorgeous in that picture than most others."
Anna_Faith,3cl0x1,You-Can-Quote-Me,3,Thu Jul 9 00:01:32 2015 UTC,thats because she doesn't modify her eyebrows. Anna fills her's in
Anna_Faith,3cl0x1,MisterScalawag,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:33:18 2015 UTC,Very Beautiful.
Anna_Faith,3cl0x1,tonman101,0,Thu Jul 9 14:01:25 2015 UTC,Lexie*
Anna_Faith,3cl0x1,Snkrhead19,0,Thu Jul 9 18:00:15 2015 UTC,Crop the picture to just their faces and the world gets flipped on its head. Without the bodies I wouldn't look twice.
Anna_Faith,3cmybb,shmeltyy1,2,Thu Jul 9 03:57:11 2015 UTC,Someone needs to make gifs of the good parts!
Anna_Faith,3cmybb,Ringmaster_2,2,Thu Jul 9 03:59:09 2015 UTC,For real because that was a terrible commercial. If it wasn't for Anna I would have clicked off easy.
Anna_Faith,3cmybb,thepasswordis-taco,2,Fri Jul 10 02:44:10 2015 UTC,I just couldn't do it. Too much cringe.
