A simple set up like this can produce very good results with stock freetype, and infinality (or fontconfig ultimate to be more precise) adds only make a marginal difference.

archlinux,3e40gh,bout10bucks,4,Tue Jul 21 22:14:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's all I've done to make them look like that. I actually use funtoo so I know it is just freetype, I have tried the infinality patches for freetype (use flags allow you to use freetype with or without infinality patches) and fontconfig-ultimate and I every time I try it I uninstall it pretty much straight away, there is an improvement with fontconfig-ultimate but it is very small and not enough to justify it for me. I also don't like some of the font choices it comes with so I end up modifying a lot so in the end it's easier to use my own config.   You've mentioned an important point though, a lot of people don't understand font configuration. I think it's one of the worst areas of linux in terms of how it is configured and managed, the fontconfig-ultimate thing does a good job in improving this a little but really just some simple rules are all that's needed. Check out some of the other examples on the arch wiki, I just saw one which was for the liberation fonts which looks almost exactly the same when I tried it. The croscore fonts are very nice though, I think Chrome OS has sent patches for their configuration upstream so they render quite well."

Ratpoison has a (GNU) screen-like interface.   One thing to consider is that it seems that i3 has a much larger user base, hence more resources, more config examples, etc. Also, apparently StumpWM is a successor to Ratpoison, so check that out too.  In the end, most tiling WMs are pretty much the same, differing mainly just in the language they're built on and the language they're configured in. I use XMonad because I like playing with Haskell.

I guess my original question is a bit openended. I'm mostly getting use to the wide variety of packages that are now so available. I have heard that its a good idea to read through the pkgbuild for AUR installs as to make sure nothing funny is being installed. I would ask for some cool packages I could install, but that really depends on what I want to do.

Nah, don't bother reading the the PKBUILDs, it's a waste of your time. okay caveat, depends on the package you're installing. If it's extremely popular? if it's on the archwiki? dont bother, it's used by enough people that you should be fine.

If you have more than one arch system (or plan to) pacserve is nice because it saves bandwith and lets you install updates faster."

Always be careful with external repos and the AUR   I was wondering what cool tricks and tips there were for arch?   If you'll be maintaining multiple Arch systems on the same architecture, take a look at repo-add. That will set up your own repo with your own packages.

Portage (the package manager in Gentoo) does the grand majority of the work when compiling packages, so if you're trying to gain a better understanding of how a *nix system is put together from scratch, I'd go with something like LFS.  I used a distro called Sabayon for a while that worked out well.  It is a hybrid distro based on Gentoo that has a binary package manager as well.  So in addition to being able to compile all the packages from scratch, you can also grab binaries from their servers if you're running short on time.  Kind of the best of both worlds."

I didn't make one when I set up my current machine - 16gb RAM, SSD for the OS - and haven't noticed any problems, but it sounds like it's better to recommend some small amount of swap rather than none, since the kernel's algorithms are built around it being there, even if the system has enough RAM not to need it.  Also - I kept meaning to look up the steps for making a swapfile but not getting around to it.

You should be able to set boot order from BIOS (write down your hardware numbers of the drives in case you guess wrong and have to switch them). Another method is looking at the SATA ports on your mobo and see if you see tiny numbers on them (like 0 to 4, or 1 to 5 or something). I think if you don't change the boot order in BIOS the numbers on the mobo indicate the natural ""boot device order"". Not sure though been a while since I've done that.

(After the install) Arch just seems easier to use, maybe because you configure it as you install it. No need to figure out why it's acting the way it is. Pacman is great. Yaourt is great. The AUR means that pretty much all packages are available.  I don't know. These discussions always seems a little futile. All else being equal (and they basically are) it's a matter of taste. I like to check out other distros but always end up back in Arch because it's what I'm comfortable with.  Edit: ArchWiki. Hands down the best feature of Arch. I have yet to encounter an issue I can't solve using the wiki, and I am way WAY less than an expert."

Documentation - This is the golden standard of how OSS should be documented. Package Management - Pacman should be reason enough to choose Arch. Easy to use, while not losing granular control, and of course, the actual repositories are kept very close to upstream. Modularity - Obviously, all Linux distributions are highly modular compared to Windows and Mac OS, Arch makes it a core philosophy. After a couple installs of Arch, the idea of preinstalling large bundles of software just seems archaic and imprecise."

archlinux,3dy4ls,Isoetes,2,Mon Jul 20 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"Fedora's had a history of being wildly inconsistent in quality between releases and having a lot of rough edges at times. It's part of why I left Fedora back in the day actually. Got tired of playing russian roulette between version upgrades. That and the policy on non-free software is, while admirable, a pain in the ass in terms of day to day usage."
archlinux,3dy4ls,archover,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"Fedora is a complete, out of the box experience and I'd wholeheartedly recommend you use Fedora if the only appeal you can see to Arch is the AUR.  Arch is not a consistent experience unless you are very well versed in Linux operating systems. I don't have a huge amount of knowledge of the subject area but I don't mind the inconsistency because I enjoy learning and have a lot of free time to tinker with my system.  It has its own unique benefits as an OS other than just being fun but in order to maximise your utility of said benefits you need to have a fairly substantial amount of prerequisite knowledge."
archlinux,3dy4ls,Isoetes,2,Mon Jul 20 14:32:25 2015 UTC,Arch is not a consistent experience    What would be a prime example of this?
archlinux,3dy4ls,archover,4,Mon Jul 20 15:29:58 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I have misworded that. The arch OS is consistent but the average user's experiences have quite a steep learning curve.   The idiosyncrasies of your hardware can produce issues with brightness or joysticks (these two gave me the most trouble) that I've not found with other distros out of the box. Luckily the wiki will yield answers if you're willing to go a few pages deep. There was a post on here the other day where a newcomer was completely overwhelmed by issues with Broadcom wireless cards, distros like unbuntu will install b43-fwcutter during the initial gui setup and you wouldn't need to give it a second thought.  There are also parts of the experience which you have to adapt to: For example on my first install I did not use the AUR sparingly and had a serious system error after installing too many conflicting packages. On other distros you can just use the package manager to your heart's content - you don't need to have the same level of engagement to have a consistently functioning OS.  Edit - the price you pay to enjoy a rolling release is the potential inconsistencies that can arise in your OS if you are not discerning when installing packages."
archlinux,3dy4ls,notagoodscientist,3,Mon Jul 20 15:44:25 2015 UTC,"Ok. Now I understand what you meant.   Your example about wireless treatment between Arch and Ubuntu affects many. Now, I know to avoid Broadcom.  Tks!"
archlinux,3dy4ls,questionetes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:19 2015 UTC,"What would be a prime example of this?    A great example is you might install a package, reboot and find your system no longer boots or you can't login or it's caused something (or a lot of things) to break.  The chance of that happening in arch is higher than it happening in fedora."
archlinux,3dy4ls,notagoodscientist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:39:01 2015 UTC,Yeah that's one of the things I'm considering however it's not all that often that you get an update which breaks your system
archlinux,3dy4ls,questionetes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:06:13 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but this is nonsense. I can't think of a single package which even could cause such a thing.
archlinux,3dy4ls,notagoodscientist,3,Mon Jul 20 22:40:53 2015 UTC,You must have missed when systemd was first put out because it broke a lot of systems around the world. Then there was the bug in the ext4 module that would cause data corruption and an unusable system.

Pacman will inform you of this (with pacnew/pacsave files, announcements, etc...), but will not help you fix the situation.

If you don't want a horizontal split, then tell it to do a vertical split. If you don't want a split at all, put it in a workspace or make a stacked/tabbed container.

Note that the Installation Guide also exists on the live media as install.txt  The other guys here has already given you some tips but another one is to use the command  # lspci -v   this command is part of your bread and butter when installing Linux. With the -v option it shows the devices your system has recognized and which driver is in use for each of them.  Make sure the wireless card/unit is recognized and that it has a driver associated with it.  This command can also be issued on the live media if you want to see which drivers are in use there.  edit:  Maybe you already knew that but you said you were a newbie so I thought I should mention it.

I used to complain a lot (A LOT) about windows doing stuff on its own, hiding things and telling you it knows better than you. I remember doing a bit less of that with ubuntu, but still it had layers and forced choices, etc. Now on the rare occasions I still get angry about something not working, I always end up slapping myself because I did something wrong, or overlooked something.

Even gaming isn't a problem, Steam works nicely, and there are heaps of great indie games for Linux now.  If you don't have a need for any programs which will only run on Windows/OSX then I don't think there's any downside to getting used to doing everything on Arch.

Got it running with nvidia drivers and all, it was beautiful. I just got a Lenovo as a replacement for my MacBook pro last year and the install was so easy, eveything just worked!  The only problem I had was with laptopmode tools trying to suspend my ssd when I unplugged the power, just disabled that feature. I find that linux runs smoother and though it might be trickier to setup, once it works it will work forever.

Quickly I ended up using the Arch partition even for games through the steam library of my Linux compliant games (as of now there's quite a lot of them actually), only going back to Windows for a few of them worth switching.  Then the HDD supporting the Windows partition died, I replaced it with a spare HDD from an old laptop (< 500 Go of storage space) and reinstalled Windows on it, but even by then I made no much use of it so I removed it from my desktop as it didn't properly fit correctly in anyway (it was a laptop-scaled HDD afterall).

One week ago I did a fresh install on my laptop, set up a dualboot with win 10 on my desktop and installed arch on a little home server.

Fragmentation: One, defragging is useless. Ext by default fragments massively. When a new file is written, it looks for empty spots it can write to. The gaps get narrower and narrower and eventually filled. Until your drive is full. His ""filefrag"" finding looks for files which are fragmented themselves (ie, file grows too big for it's spot, begins to write somewhere else. The system still knows where all parts are. I think this only affects speed and recovery from a broken FS table). ""e2freefrag"". Shows overall free space (as in, what you see as ""free space"" in your file browser). Lastly, ""e4defrag"". The only one that actually defrags (instead of all three, as he claims). I can't remember this being used, but maybe the system does that itself if neccessary.  Reboots: On arch, you might have to do those once in a while (kernel upgrades). He says when libraries get updated, they stay in memory (true) and often require a reboot (false). You just need to close whatever is using those libraries and start the program again. No reboot needed. Also, many computers (especially servers) run for years without reboots. I think centos can even run indefinitely without a reboot, but still running all ""up to date"" stuff (well, patches etc). It restarts stuff dynamically when it's not needed (and even the kernel).  Taking out harddrive and putting it somewhere else: I think this is the only point where he's actually kinda right. But how often do you put a harddrive in another computer?

archlinux,3drrgu,flaming_m0e,2,Sat Jul 18 20:52:00 2015 UTC,Do you mind elaborating? I have the avahi-daemon running which is supposed to resolve the name?
archlinux,3drrgu,du5tball,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:56:18 2015 UTC,"Easy (with a bit of networking background).  You have two options. If they are static (as in, forever and manually configured, not via DHCP-leases), you can enter them into /etc/hosts. The existing entries should give you a good start on how to write new ones.  The second one is for DHCP servers. Create a new file /etc/resolv.conf.tail and add ""domain <domainname>"". The domain name is usually determined by your router, i.e. Fritz!Box has ""fritz.box"" as it's domain. Meaning, whenever you browse to ""<name>.fritz.box"", the router resolves the name. However, this does not work in case you didn't configure the other machine right (by assigning it a hostname)."

archlinux,3drsdz,du5tball,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:51:40 2015 UTC,I have to keep it floating to be usable. I didn't know it's beta. I guess I'll just have to deal =P. I wish they had a miniturized version. Or a plugin-esque version for toolbars.

archlinux,3drsdz,GiraffixCard,2,Sat Jul 18 21:05:13 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I don't want floating. I would think that would be clear that I don't want fullscreen either. I am using a tiling wm for a reason, because I want tiles."

archlinux,3drsdz,heWhoWearsAshes,0,Sat Jul 18 21:11:17 2015 UTC,Well that's great for you! How about you post how you did it instead of being a condescending jerk! Because when it's tiled for me it just breaks graphically!
archlinux,3drsdz,heavy_crown,0,Sat Jul 18 21:12:25 2015 UTC,Neither I or anyone else can read your mind. I didn't do anything special to make it tile.
archlinux,3drsdz,lovelybac0n,3,Sat Jul 18 21:13:52 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/eycyf1C  Well this is what I'm dealing with.
archlinux,3drsdz,Jk0er,4,Sat Jul 18 21:16:24 2015 UTC,Pay for Spotify so you can use it via a client that doesn't suck like clementine  Use the website. It's possible to open a website in its own window with none of the normal ui like a url bar tabs etc. If you like I could explain that one further.  File a bug report with Spotify.  Automate floating it and expanding it to fill the workspace it's in and keep it in its own workspace. In i3 you would use for_window
