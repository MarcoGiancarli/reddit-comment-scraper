It was constructed by fugitive Jedi Knight Kazdan Paratus, who was on the run from the Galactic Empire. more reading here."

ImaginaryWastelands,3dif8a,Joseph_Zachau,3,Thu Jul 16 15:04:04 2015 UTC,"Or, not so imaginary - This is an actual photo from the Aral Sea. The massive fresh-water lake (25.000+ sq miles, larger than Lake Michigan), located on the border between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, was drained by Soviet irrigation projects. The vast majority (>90%) of the lake has turned into the newly formed Aralkum Desert."

The world that was so different from ours but they did it so casualy and normal. Giant flees for transport... its bloody insane but in the world its kinda like ""ye what else? Youd rather walk?""  My love for morrowind and its strange feeling is something thats subconsiously show up for me now and then while painting. :)"

ImaginaryWastelands,3ddnf7,GaslightProphet,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:10 2015 UTC,Great!!  Not what I expected. They look like they could reseed a wasteland pretty fast.  Is this part of a world you work in or is it a one-off kind of idea?  (they look like a couple of...FUNGIS...)
