LightNovels,3e3mr0,totokkk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:57 2015 UTC,I'd more expect it to trigger another evolution of the Austin Gryphon.
LightNovels,3e3mr0,Roflmaows,2,Tue Jul 21 19:12:06 2015 UTC,The teaser seems really interesting... I feel like the blue spirit might be the spirit of a weapon that can only be used by the worthy.

LightNovels,3e3mr0,chunwa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:15 2015 UTC,Blue sword and gold shield? Can he take both or just 1?

LightNovels,3e32qf,ictiongson,7,Tue Jul 21 16:09:32 2015 UTC,This story really has changed the way I look at slimes.

LightNovels,3e32qf,Pergius,4,Tue Jul 21 17:47:31 2015 UTC,Hope that Matthew gets sorted out by Ryouma soon. Might even escalate into a #fuckmatthew thing.
LightNovels,3e32qf,believingunbeliever,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:57 2015 UTC,Would be hilarious if Ryouma just complains about Matthew to the 3 gods and they smite the dude into dust
LightNovels,3e32qf,bbaabb,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:10 2015 UTC,"True, however this serie needs some sort of conflict in order to continue. So to conclude, it would be best if Matthew can continue being an antogonist just a little bit longer."
LightNovels,3e32qf,copy331,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:13 2015 UTC,"Lets see if it escalates a little more, I hope it does, I mean once he pulls out the elemental slimes and had time to train them, I doubt any beast Matthew may have will be swarmed by thousand of slimes easily."

LightNovels,3e32qf,Tuqui0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:37 2015 UTC,I was using an example of how whatever he trows at him Ryoumas slime could eat and grow.
LightNovels,3e32qf,llye,2,Tue Jul 21 17:20:34 2015 UTC,I don't get why he needs another tamer.  Can't he just do what Elia grandpa does and just leave the slimes in X location while hes in Y?
LightNovels,3e32qf,DaPancakeBandit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:36 2015 UTC,"I think they said that someone needed to ""take care"" of the slimes. Probably just helping them split and contracting the new ones so they don't go wild."

LightNovels,3e32qf,Guroga,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"A lot, but if you mean the types, he has Acid Slimes, Sticky Slimes, Scavenger Slimes, Cleaner Slimes, Healing Slimes, Blood Slime, Earth Slime, Dark Slime, Iron Slime, Metal Slime. As for numbers, you will have to check previous chapters. I only remember he's near 1k for Acid, and there's over 4k Scavenger, Healing only has 2 or 3, Blood 1, Earth 2, Dark 1, 1 Iron, 1 Metal."

LightNovels,3e2dfz,NeoWebNovel,6,Tue Jul 21 13:10:34 2015 UTC,That section kinda hops out at you. I was already snickering when he was petting the slime then burst out laughing when the dialog came up.

It doesn't seem to have anything to do with my RSS or my posts' date.  But the multiple chapter 20s popping out on aho today, is because I had to repost the chapter. I messed up the URL, so I couldn't just edit it."

LightNovels,3e28o6,Cheese_Ninja,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:37:24 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical of the ""there's a map skill she should have gotten"" theory because in most games the map is part of the HUD or menu screens or an item.  In her case since she can't pull up a status screen I don't think she has a map buried in some game menu.  On the other hand, when she was calling out random things to try to find skills she can get, only five were discovered (of which she's gotten 3).  While it's possible there exists a map skill she never tested for, it's just as plausible such a skill doesn't exist, especially since one thing she was aiming to find were skills that would be helpful in preventing surprise attacks."
LightNovels,3e28o6,Bagelson,2,Tue Jul 21 15:14:50 2015 UTC,"In most rpgs, the selfstatus would be a part of the HUD, or at least the basic information one would know. Also, it could work like in ""So What if it's a RPG world"" where the minimap was a perk you could acquire."

She's got an interesting personality, a bit crazy from isolation, a bit desperate, and clever when it comes to using the tools/skills she has available.  Some of these series I feel like the protagonists has so many cheats the author forgets about most of them and the MC fails to make proper use of their own abilities, but Kumoko is pretty much always scraping for each minor advantage."

LightNovels,3e1zv6,vl1996,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:44:03 2015 UTC,"Because she is ignorant about the world. Like a frog trapped in a well. All her life, she was taugh one thing, and so she believes it without questioning its nature. From the looks of it, she isnt suited for Acadamia. Especially a vital and essential academic institution that holds the future of their part of the region.

LightNovels,3e1zv6,Kougetsu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:07 2015 UTC,She acts really arrogant even though she is really weak. Arrogant teachers typically tend to be bad teachers unless if they are experts.

LightNovels,3e0vhs,japzone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:56:49 2015 UTC,I feel like that might backfire on them. Aren't the knuckles made from the magic steel that adjusts to the wearer. So after it adjusts it might end up being a horrifyingly powerful pair of weapons for Milim.
LightNovels,3e0vhs,StiozZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:30:34 2015 UTC,Not when they're specifically designed to weaken her power. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't make such a basic blunder.

Also Rimuru is being waaaayy too nice! Those 3 meals should cost quite a lot even in the Royal Capital! A japanese bath and toilet, those are things which should be rare in this world!

LightNovels,3e0hjk,shady8x,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:53 2015 UTC,"Because unless one has some sudden breakthrough, it typically takes half a dozen of those pills for average people to establish a foundation.

LightNovels,3e0hjk,Chillz717,0,Tue Jul 21 03:32:14 2015 UTC,"It doesnt take a half dozen of those pills. It takes just one. Meng Hao is different because hes shot up so many demon cores early on in his cultivation, his requirement is now much higher than everyone else. The reason Ding Yan didnt take the Foundation pill already is because once used, it paralyzes you for months, and he still needed to complete his mission and kill Meng Hao first. He would have taken it and gone into seclusion afterward had he succeeded."

He would have taken it and gone into seclusion afterward had he succeeded.   http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-1-chapter-68/   This Foundation Establishment Pill was one of the reasons Ding Yan just couldn’t believe that he would die. It had been made by his master and then gifted to him. Considering that he was at the ninth level of Qi condensation, if he came across a bit of luck in his travels, then he might be able to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage. He had kept it on his person so that he could have it handy when that critical juncture arrived.  Even in a great Sect in the Southern Domain, a Foundation Establishment Pill was not common. It was even less common for them to be distributed to disciples. The requirements to acquire one were very high. Even if more than the usual amount of pills were available, the supply would still fall short of the demand. Most people could not establish a Foundation with only one pill. Usually two or three were required. Some people with only average latent talent but the support of Sect Elders, might be able to break through with five pills.   Shangguan Xiu hasn't been able to establish his foundation in 50 years, making him an average talent at best."
LightNovels,3e0hjk,Chillz717,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:20:52 2015 UTC,Sangguan Xiu intentionally didnt enter Establishing Foundation stage. He could have done it 50 years ago if he wanted to.

Meng Hao went mental and chose to use the pill and its clones to break through to the ninth Qi Condensation level."
LightNovels,3e0hjk,bizarrehorsecreature,4,Tue Jul 21 01:00:03 2015 UTC,"I thought you use the pill at 9th condensation level to break through to Foundation? It said that Ding Yan was at the 9th level and his master expected him to use the pill to breakthrough. And even if he failed, he would make him another pill when Ding Yan returned to the sect."
LightNovels,3e0hjk,zuijiaperfectionist,3,Tue Jul 21 01:19:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you're right. I remember Ding Yan was already at the ninth Qi condensation, but hadn't used it since he wasn't at that point to break through to the next stage. Makes one really ponder your question now... especially when he said he could have established his foundation 50 years ago."
LightNovels,3e0hjk,leecherleechleech,3,Tue Jul 21 01:30:28 2015 UTC,He was probably looking for a technique or following a technique to establish a better/perfect foundation. i.e. a 9 crack foundation or whatever it was.

LightNovels,3e0l67,AtriusII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:30 2015 UTC,"Charm seems a bit too excessive.  Rage/Fury (same stuff he uses for the dragon armor skill) would be a good way to balance the skill, since I think 100 would empty it and he would have to kill stuff to get it back."

LightNovels,3e0yvy,gestahpo,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"Just by reading the first several paragraphs I could tell exactly who the author of this was. I've only read chapter 1 so far and will probably end up following the series cause of nothing else to read. But dear god I wish this author could write a story where the girls involved aren't some sort of unprecedented beauty on earth that makes every man around her drool and gulp and stare and unable to act as the normal functioning adult members of society that they should be.  For anyone who has read ahead on the raws, could you spoiler tag for me as to whether or not this novel is a harem?"
LightNovels,3e0yvy,bakuoni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:14:59 2015 UTC,"yeah that would be nice, it's getting kind of stale where every heroine is some earth shattering beauty. Why can't it be the girl next door or something at least maybe have the idea there instead of immediately going to the hot beauty... e.g. Coiling Dragon at least there there was someone that fit the girl next door type even though the romance failed."
LightNovels,3e0yvy,gestahpo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:28:09 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't be too bad. I just finished chapter 5 and actually really like the direction this novel has gone so far. While I still think its inevitable that his old guildleader will be some sort of romantic interest in the future, I'm hoping she remains as the only one and doesn't play a large role for quite a bit. As long as I don't have to deal with lines like ""But she just got a red face, so attractive like a ripe red apple, made people want to hold her and get a bite."" I think this could actually be an entertaining read.  I haven't read CD yet, partly because I'm waiting for it to be completely translated, partly because of how reviews say the women are portrayed. How annoying would you say it is to read through CD in regards to constantly having paragraphs about the beauty of women shoved in your face?"
LightNovels,3e0yvy,bludvein,2,Tue Jul 21 03:51:24 2015 UTC,"CD isn't that bad about women actually. The MC remains devoted to a single woman throughout the series, and she's pretty but not a ""stop and drool at"" goddess that no other woman could hope to match type.  On the other hand, don't expect women to have too much of an active role in things either."
LightNovels,3e0yvy,gestahpo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:02:04 2015 UTC,"Okay that sounds great, and you actually answered another question I had lol. I was worried they would be showing up frequently. If they are only around every once in a while I'm fine with an annoying description here and there. I like the way IET handles women in his stories for the most part, being able to make them important to the MC without needing them to be around all the time and without the MC being almost completely focused on them."
LightNovels,3e0yvy,kradusbarbus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:09:43 2015 UTC,"Lol i dont know where you read that shit about CD but CD has the least amount of ""beauty"" and other shity paragraphs like most of the novels , CD mostly focuses on battles and training , it does have some romance but its mostly 90% battles/training 5%other drama shit and about maybe 5% some slighty romance? You cant compare ZL   imature ""romance"" with CD ."
LightNovels,3e0yvy,DwarvenRedshirt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:05:39 2015 UTC,Remember the culture.  It's not like there's a lot of women for these guys to fantasize about there.

LightNovels,3e0yvy,gestahpo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:49:39 2015 UTC,"That is what I thought originally but its really just the first chapter that is full of that stuff so far. If you haven't already, read through the next couple chapters. I promise (up to what is translated so far) you don't have to deal with that all that bullshit. Maybe if the author makes the mistake of forcing a plethora of women into the story later on...but hopefully it won't turn out like his other works."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,Tuqui0,8,Mon Jul 20 19:38:34 2015 UTC,"It's interesting how the Demon Lord noticed how artificial Satou's powers are. I always wondered if anyone would ever notice how mismatched his skills are. He just activates skills that seem convenient whenever they pop-up, making his build extremely reactionary to his situations."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,japzone,7,Mon Jul 20 20:23:06 2015 UTC,It's pretty much only when he let's go. Otherwise he does his best to blend into the crowd as a true merchant.  The problem he's been running into is that his followers are starting to break out of their molds too. Not to mention the high end items they are receiving. So then there's this incongruity where his followers look like hero followers but he's just a merchant.
LightNovels,3dzdt4,Keshire,4,Mon Jul 20 21:05:38 2015 UTC,"I'm still waiting for him to actually start selling stuff.  I mean, he tells everyone he's a merchant, yet nobody asks to buy things from him and he doesn't offer to sell things.  If I was Liza, Tama, Pochi, Lulu, or Nana, I'd be wondering what the hell is going on with his merchant career.  Selfishly, I'd like to see how much his creations (armor, weapons, potions, etc.) could sell for."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,Jackie_Chan_Effect,6,Mon Jul 20 21:14:49 2015 UTC,"I think his party is already aware that he's not a true merchant, since they have seen how strong he is. However, since it is clear that Satou wants to hide his strength, they choose not to pry into his personal life (ex. the beast-trio decides to go with the flow, when Satou credits them for escaping from the dungeon).  For anybody else, he can just claim that he's making a long road-trip to transport cargo. I think he bought a bunch of dragonstones (forgot the name of the cargo) from Seryuu so he can sell it at Labyrinth City), and he can also claim to sell a bunch of other misc cargo."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,yggdrasil98,7,Mon Jul 20 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool fight scene, gotta thanks the translator a lot more on this one."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,Tw9caboose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:48:55 2015 UTC,I liked the scene but I feel like he probably shouldn't of had that hard of a time. Even with %99 damage reduction when the person is 250 levels higher than you it means nothing.
LightNovels,3dzdt4,WhatIsAnNSA,5,Tue Jul 21 02:09:46 2015 UTC,Level 120 Demon Lord. Weren't the townsfolk in the beginning of the story saying that his party of level 13's really strong?  OP.
LightNovels,3dzdt4,Guroga,3,Mon Jul 20 22:20:09 2015 UTC,So he call the demon lord an obstacle because he went out of his way to defeat it?  Arisa will yell for sure.

LightNovels,3dzdt4,MicksX,4,Mon Jul 20 20:15:31 2015 UTC,he'll probably forget about her just like everything else he stores in his inventory
LightNovels,3dzdt4,leecherleechleech,-5,Tue Jul 21 01:41:16 2015 UTC,"He could've just 1 hit kill it with Excalibur.  The fight scene isn't as good as the adventure story. Kinda reminded me of The Gamer, the adventuring part is pretty good, but the fight scene is really meeh."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,Shenfeng,4,Mon Jul 20 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe, maybe not.   He is far from having perfect grasp of everything in his possession. He gradually discovers and understands it, but as someone pointed out, it is like a newbie suddenly getting a character who broke the level cap in an MMORPG, and with an inventory filled to the brim with unique items.  Can he destroy everything ? Most probably. However, here is the catch, there is neither Help button for explanations, nor Online Wiki. And Friendly fire is activated by default.   His first ""magic"" was a fucking nuke, with which he unwillingly killed something akin to a country. Any average salaryman, which Satou is, would refrain from redoing such a ""mistake"".  And honestly, if you expect this novel to go the ""MC becomes OP and kicks cheeky people from their high horse"", you got the wrong novel. It belongs more to the slice of life, with occasional Hero part time job. The MC here is average, as average as his background is. He is no genius, no hard working typical chinese protagonist or no man child, and more importantly, he has no drive or motive. No revenge, no need to survive.   Coming from someone who reads the raws, if you expect this novel to go shounen style with fight based plot. You better drop this now unless you like being disappointed. Because you will get 30 chapters of slice of life mixed with exposition of the world's backgrounds for 5 chapters of action each arc.  So that might not be your cup of tea judging from your rant. Though it fits my taste perfectly, to everyone his cup of tea I guess."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,leecherleechleech,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:34:33 2015 UTC,"That's one of the reason why I'm so pissed!!  The author ability to wrote a fight scene is sub-par, so rather than wasting time writing a meeh fight scene he should focus more on adventuring scene, which is clearly his strong point!!  What I'm trying to say is, just kill the damn Demon Lord and go back and cook some more meat for Tama and Pochi!!   lol"
LightNovels,3dzdt4,Keshire,4,Mon Jul 20 23:49:53 2015 UTC,"He could've just 1 hit kill it with Excalibur.

LightNovels,3dzdt4,araere,6,Mon Jul 20 20:51:53 2015 UTC,"My equipped sword is Durandal, not Excalibur, it's not because I'm unwilling. I've stored dangerous amount of magic power inside Excalibur when I experiment with storing magic power, so I'm afraid that I would collapse the capital if I'm careless with it.   As you may have noticed, while he has ""mastery"" in his skills, he doesn't actually know how to use them well, as pointed out by the demon lord. His powers require him to experiment to figure out how to use them, but he spends most of his time experimenting with other stuff (crafting) rather than combat techniques.   I'm not sure if you've played many MMOs, but it would be similar to getting a max level character with the best gear without playing it from the start to max level. You can use the character to execute skills but you would have to learn how to do the rotations and the various applications of the skills.  You're right in that it is an excuse that Excalibur is charged up with magic power already, but not in the way you think it is; it's an excuse for the author to write a fight scene."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,leecherleechleech,-10,Mon Jul 20 21:08:40 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, I do think that Excalibur bullshit is just an excuse the author use to wrote fight scene, he has hundreds if not thousand of magical item and tools in his box, and If I remember correctly, it's all sorted.   Out of all the item, there's even loot from the Dragon God that even the Demon Lord afraid of, it's impossible to think that there's no magical item or loot that can be used to 1-hit K.O the Demon Lord.  ps: The fight scene is not even good."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,gg533,2,Mon Jul 20 21:14:00 2015 UTC,"Your grammar isn't very good, to be honest.  Yeah, he could 1-shot the Demon Lord probably, but then he'd probably also collapse the entire city due to destroying the entire fucking underground foundations of the fucking city."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,leecherleechleech,-7,Mon Jul 20 22:04:16 2015 UTC,"He has shit tons of magic skill, he even get two more Demon Lord Class skill, he can use it to destroy the freaking Demon Lord if he wanted to.  Stop using ""afraid that he might destroy the City"" as an excuse.  That's just bullshit.  ps: I'd appreciate it if you just point out my grammar error rather than trying to be honest, lol"
LightNovels,3dzdt4,gg533,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:38:51 2015 UTC,So you want me to baby you like you're in elementary school?
LightNovels,3dzdt4,Keshire,2,Mon Jul 20 23:13:42 2015 UTC,I don't think swinging it enough to split the Demon Lord would destroy the city.   Better safe than sorry. You'll notice that he gradually starts ramping up the power used to find an equilibrium of winning versus destroying everything around him.
LightNovels,3dzdt4,Therosfire,2,Mon Jul 20 21:15:56 2015 UTC,Its not the swing strength that's the problem. Its that he uses the sword to practice storing magic. A single swing will most likely unleash all the magic in the sword when he hits something. That explosion will destroy the city.
LightNovels,3dzdt4,leecherleechleech,-6,Mon Jul 20 21:13:57 2015 UTC,"Okay, let say that he can't use Excalibur due to that ""reason"".   What stopping him from using other OP item? I'm sure he has other Holy Weapon or Magical Item that he ""didn't stored dangerous amount of magic that could blow the the entire city"" that could 1-hit the Demon Lord."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,leecherleechleech,4,Mon Jul 20 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"He was using Durandal in this last couple chapters, which is almost up there with Excalibur."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,leecherleechleech,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:03:54 2015 UTC,"But he's at the maximum level, his exp bar is 999999999999999  He has a full map of Dragon Tribe loot and shitload of Magical Item that probably on par with Excalibur, I wouldn't even surprised if he has a freaking nuke, lol.   Not sure bout his stat though, but it should be very damn high since his regen is pretty much in instant,  He obtain Demon Lord Class Magic Skill and Resistance.  He could even punch the Demon Lord to death, but here he is, ""strugling""...It annoys me greatly."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,japzone,2,Mon Jul 20 22:57:18 2015 UTC,"He's struggling 'cause he doesn't know the extent of his power, i.e. he could use the Meteor Rain Spell and destroy the demon, but that would take the whole city too. Also, he's not at maximum level, would be silly if 310 was maximum level, his exp counter is just topped, he still gains exp but only shows a change on the % advance to next level, which is stuck as pointed out some chapters ago when he was farming exp for the girls. Also, I doubt there's many weapons/artifacts as strong as Excalibur, specially one that's been loaded with his magic power to the point that most other weapons would have exploded long ago."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,gg533,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:03:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's the mortal limit, the time he broke through the 9999999 limit he'll probably become God, lol"
LightNovels,3dzdt4,leecherleechleech,2,Mon Jul 20 23:05:52 2015 UTC,He mentioned that the sword he was using in this fight was the second strongest or something.
LightNovels,3dzdt4,gg533,2,Mon Jul 20 22:39:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was using Durandal for that specific fucking reason; because he didn't store magic power to the MAX."
LightNovels,3dzdt4,leecherleechleech,-2,Mon Jul 20 22:03:14 2015 UTC,"If he has the time to ""Oops"" and casually monologuing, then I say, he's fucking around rather than earnestly trying to kill the freaking Demon Lord."

I only have one critique; we only really see what characters are doing, so I think it would benefit the work if we could understand the characters' thoughts as well. You could change perspective or just say what the MC is thinking sometimes, haha. So far, the only thing we know about the MC in terms of character is that he can be resourceful, and he doesn't really care about killing, and I would love to figure out more of his personality, backstory, etc. I'm suprised he didn't spend his first night in this new world crying, haha."

Right now, we're trying to regulate releases so that they are more regular as opposed to having sporadic bulk releases. Therefore, 158 will be released tomorrow.

LightNovels,3dz2k3,ArtistsTech,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:34:46 2015 UTC,I also agree that I would prefer to wait for unfinished releases and have bulk posts of chapters.  I rather like when there is a slight buildup of releases and I get to read multiple at once.  Maybe a better solution would be to have one release day a week in which all complete chapters to that point are released. this way you regulate the release feq. while still having bulk posts.

LightNovels,3e0czk,porrridge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:08:03 2015 UTC,"The novel is more e-sports oriented rather than another path to OP godliness. In a competition, the game for one has to be well balanced and there must be a way of to show differences in skills. In VR style games, characters aren't usually balanced at all. Even if they are, the player's skill level is then based off of their martial arts expertise rather than actual gaming skills. A PC game works better for this type of story imo."

LightNovels,3dyih4,Edwardyhm,0,Mon Jul 20 17:20:06 2015 UTC,"woah this synopsis was like all over the place, it just seems like a bunch of ideas were thrown together and whatever stuck he used.  If he's hades shouldn't his goal be to kill Zeus or something cause you know they kinda hate each other??? Hades technically doesn't kill anyone he's a god of the underworld so he just guides/tortures the dead. Plus doesn't Hades get his wife through abducting and tricking her. So is that what's gonna happen?    Well maybe i'll check it out when its got 100+ chapters translated but oh boy, a Chinese messing with western mythology its very gutsy play but i'll wait awhile to see how it pans out."

Adding all the elements together this implies)  A) MC is more talented than the ultimate genius to a scary degree B) MC through tactical thinking    -caused a event within the spiritual road that affected the ultimate genius and potentially a lot of people   The intent I'd wager is likely a event that happened in response to or in defense of   -The girl involving -The ultimate genius.  Knowing all this and adding on what we do know about the spiritual road (its a bloodthirsty place where people get harmed to a extreme extent by other people) I'd wager the MC committed a large event enough to disrupt the spiritual road itself.

LightNovels,3dy1ak,Kr1py,3,Mon Jul 20 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"Well that if anyone saw those movements to begin with, basically a small guild, a pro player, and a few noobs are the only one who witness the MC prowness so far. In fact there's no video of him killing anything yet, so by that logic no one really seen much of him in game of his movements.

LightNovels,3dy1ak,Taylord123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:16 2015 UTC,"Strength in numbers, basically. If Zhan Long is anything to go by, the large guilds in China (at least in these novels) number in the hundreds of thousands of members. They can basically flood opponents lacking backing with enemies until they are too exhausted to continue. Also, this rich fuck is probably at least in the earth ranking, with stronger subordinates.   Ling Tian is defying common sense too, imagine you're playing an MMO and someone keeps dropping Epic/Legendary gear left and right just after game start. Common sense dictates he's lucky as fuck, not necessarily skilled.   Being recognized by the number 8 of the Heaven ranking doesn't mean much, either. It means he's good, but since there are seven people more powerful, two of them S rank, and that guy surely has access to one of the S ranks and one other Heaven dude, he wouldn't be too scared.   Remember, they have no idea that Ling Tian is SSS rank like Eve, since he's an unknown entity. And no one would surmise he is, since only one person other than Ling Tian and Eve knows that there's someone like that.   Nobody knows about the Lunar Scourge either, and just how cheat-like it is. Nobody would believe it anyway if they were told about it. A noob player gaining tan item that is the most important kind in the game and also practically surpasses Saint Destroyer level? Double the quality of the best known other item of it's king? Stacked with a Mysterious God level orb with cheat attributes? While the rest of the world (sans Eve) is happy with Silver grade equipment?  MC is more OP than imaginable, defying common sense and completely unknown. You can't really blame others for underestimating a person who completely breaks game balance."

LightNovels,3dxzpi,Gallappago,15,Mon Jul 20 13:32:55 2015 UTC,"I finally caught up with the latest chapters, and I have to say... Never before have I wanted to punch an authors face as much as I want to right now. Rant incoming.  I have never before seen an author trying to disguise a main character (and some other characters too) which are vain assholes and greed-minded as morally good characters.   The asshole things the main character has done to date:   He raised his prices of his moisture treatments from 1 gold to 100 times more and exclusively for aristocrats.  His damn beautification techniques are easy as breathing for him to perform and he uses them on only important people who are either powerful aristocrats or people who he owns in one way or another. And even then his price for the treatments would look like extortion from any sane man when they don't have any right to be (the techniques are easy with practice, only because no one knows about them can the MC charge this much).  He was being the stingiest bastard ever just because a woman doubted that a 8-year old kid could make you lose weight instantly when she had every right to doubt (it was planned all along, but it was still an asshole thing to do), which then lead to the upper point.  But the worst of all offenses to date was the fact that he started bulling his cute pet dragon because he was bored!   I only have to wonder the author's state of mind when he tries to display the main character as being in the moral right for his actions.   I mean if we compare main characters from other series, Duwei from Law Of The Devil makes no pretenses that he is an asshole and he is actively trying to be one to elevate his boredom. But Duwei is at least a FAIR asshole (and humorous), he doesn't screw with people that don't screw with him, that's why he's a more morally upright person than goddamn Suo Jia.  This isn't even going into the other egregious stuff about this novel like for example the fact that we are reaching chapter 100 and still no combat in sight when the novel is called Close Combat Mage.  I could go on and on, but I will still read this because I like these kinds of novels."
LightNovels,3dxzpi,bladestorm91,4,Mon Jul 20 14:15:47 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem in this Novel is the Author writing every chapter without any Clear plans for future chapter(Ending or Major arcs) and in that process he sometimes forgot or Change his mind about everything without caring about the chapters he Wrote before. And Also the major flow of this novel is the the author decided to make a Clever mature Kid without any Major foundation like Education Background, Experience and Major Event that force him to mature and Also What the fck when Sou Jia doesn't yet got in school he is always in house helping his mother and his mother is always the one who is managing the family money and expenses so how come Sou Jia is so Great at managing money?(Damn this....)  And Also if the Author just made it a REINCARNATED novel instead I won't mind his none Close Combat Mage and this novel will become fun instead and not become disappointing like this.(Just imagine A Reincarnated person who hate Ugly and want to make a change in this new world of his and make everyone beautiful, this will solve everyone problem in this novel)"

He is not running a charity so why should help people by selling his services for 1 gold when he could make a whole lot more by selling it to nobles. Which freaking MC has that much time wasting it helping poor people when he can use that time to train. Most CN characters are selfish and somewhat assholes like chu feng, yun che, etc. But thats what makes them more realistic cause lets face it humans are by nature selfish and in CN novels the characters only care about friends, family, and pretty girls. The others they could care less about. Also wasnt he trying to train his dragon for the competition wasnt really doing for fun (well not his intention but he might have secretly enjoyed it). Also dropped law of the devil cause of the MC extorting the mage elf.

If water mages were fewer and the technique was rarer then maybe but nothing add ups.
LightNovels,3dxzpi,Rickymex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:44 2015 UTC,Tbh the Author is implying that every Other Water Mages in the world are IDIOTS and only Sou Jia an 8yrs old Kiddo is the only one who is using his brain.

Judging by the amount of such web novels already written on syoetsu, the reincarnation into new world theme is very popular among Japanese readers.  So it's natural that more of those trickle down through translators.   Following Sturgeon's law, 90% of everything is crap, so novels are no exception. Also remember that most light novels are written (by mostly amateur authors) for young teenagers."
LightNovels,3dxwwy,ggrey7,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:18 2015 UTC,im not expecting them to be a best seller but they def lack the creativity to develop a plot that expands upon the premise of the story. theres some that are interesting enough and write likable characters or scenarios but then theres others that are so very dull

LightNovels,3dxwwy,reallybigshrimp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:06:57 2015 UTC,More of that monster taming is such a prevalent concept in these fantasy RPG setting I'm surprised all the ones I've read didn't touch on it at all. Also I was expecting it to go on that subject :x
LightNovels,3dxwwy,hehaaw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:04 2015 UTC,I figured they'd gain peoples trust by actions rather than act tame.  I think its because the authors are often trying to give us a story from another perspective. Also the fanstasy RPG setting also means that killing 'monsters' offers alot of potentially lucrative loot.
LightNovels,3dxwwy,RicelsASideDish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:54:21 2015 UTC,im not saying i wanted them to be tamed but i thought they would be able to participate in human culture without all the drama. more like its a world where humans can tame monsters so them joining humans in towns or w.e is completely fine and they just adventure and all that without so much drama from hostile humans attempting at their lives.
LightNovels,3dxwwy,hehaaw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:15:10 2015 UTC,But then whats the point of having a monster protag?  The humans are enemies theme in these stories are pritty much the bread and butter of monster protag stories even if not all humans are actually enemies.

LightNovels,3dv6co,ImTheJudgeandJury,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:50:50 2015 UTC,"The length of this arc depends on how long it is before he absorbs the Phoenix fragment/remnant, kills the mercenaries, and then has to kill and/or flee from the mercenaries' superiors.  That tournament the Princess mentioned will happen two or so years in the future, but until then, they can spend a lot of time out in the wilderness.

LightNovels,3dvabi,zi76,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:58:24 2015 UTC,"No, it wasn't.  Knights are sort of analogous to D&D Paladins, however, who can (I'm not up on D&D, I have to say) have mounts.  Spiritualists obviously summon beasts.  I would think that you can enslave a mount at a higher level.  I mean, LHC was told that he could beat down a dragon in the future and make it into his mount."
LightNovels,3dvabi,zi76,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:04:36 2015 UTC,"It was explained. Only the Knights have access to that special formation and mountain where they can grab a beast. It belongs to them, and they hoard it.  The assassins also appear to have their own formation as well, whatever Cai'er was doing with it.  Perhaps every temple group has their own special formation, but only knights have one where it's easy to get a mount. However, anyone can force a mount to submit and get a partner that way, only they will have to first become much stronger."
LightNovels,3dvabi,zi76,2,Mon Jul 20 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"That's just with their mountain.  Knights who aren't at least Grand Knights by the age of 20 can't use their mountain, so they have to go out and get a magical beast to submit to them.  We don't actually know if anyone can force a mount to submit, or if that's a knight-only contract.  Then again, we don't really know much about the world of Shen and how you become the different classes.  I mean, we don't know if anyone can become any class or anything, or if you can only be one class from birth."
LightNovels,3dvabi,Gamezob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:21:42 2015 UTC,"True, we don't know for sure that anyone other than knights can make a contract. But, it makes sense that it would be rare for other people of low rank to have them. If they have to make them submit under their own power, and they only get one beast, then no one would want to waste their one shot on a weak beast. I think it's a safe bet that that's the reason why only Knights in the tournament have their beasts (minus the summoners.)  But you're right, we don't know much at all about the SYWZ world, and it could be a Knight only thing, and we don't even know how people are chosen for their class."
LightNovels,3dul8w,Tuqui0,58,Sun Jul 19 17:01:58 2015 UTC,"And to think my most optimistic goal at the start of this week was to finish the tournament arc. I gotta translate less now, or you'll start having Expectations.  Our regularly scheduled love drama is now followed by Pumping Iron with Tang Hao.  Oscar is a manly man. Admit it.  For those of you wondering whether that's nine months later or after nine months in total. Nobody kno~~ws. Until next chapter."

LightNovels,3dul8w,DeltruS,6,Sun Jul 19 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"3 months for the first stage of training + 9 months for the second stage is conveniently 1 year. But the training is only 2 chapters long, far too short. There's gotta be more training.  I think the time skip will be 10 years, to match up with Oscar's training. Sigh, they won't be kids anymore. I will miss the childish aspect of the Shrek 7 Devils."

Or some of them just won't show up, and it will give us a look at how the [non-training montage chapter-receiving] devils are progressing. At least that's my guess."
LightNovels,3dul8w,bellrunner,3,Sun Jul 19 18:08:21 2015 UTC,Oscar asked Rongrong to give him 10 years before finding someone else. That doesn't mean he'll needs all 10 years to become a sausage tool spirit battle master.
LightNovels,3dul8w,Ogenki1978,3,Sun Jul 19 18:54:28 2015 UTC,"I remember that before they went to Spirit City, Tang San and Grandmaster were talking albout Sans desire ro roam the world freely, and the author wrote that it would be another six years of training for Tang San to achieve that. So there will probably be the meeting of the Devils (sans Xiao Wu and Oscar I guess) and then a year of fighting for some cause (with Tang San producing more reaction chapters than Chu Feng) and then we'll be done with training I think"

I can Oscar becoming a Spirit Douluo that eats his own sausage to fight."
LightNovels,3dul8w,kukelekuuk00,2,Sun Jul 19 19:16:27 2015 UTC,I'm expecting foods that give him battle power or something.  I can already imagine a battle system food spirit master. Dem reactions.
LightNovels,3dul8w,AtriusII,2,Sun Jul 19 19:28:12 2015 UTC,What im betting on is a support item that gives really good defense. This will mesh really well with his Auxiliary support type and it will give him the ability to defend Rongrong. I'm assuming it will be some insane buffs of sort.  I dont think going into offensive spirit skills would be wise since it would sort of depreciate the value of his previous 4 skills. And on top of that a support master like Oscar is already rare and immensely useful. I hope he wont abandon what he has done so far in favor of offensive power. It would even be better if became such an amazing support that it would cover the need for offense.

I've been doing quite a lot of translating lately, and there's really no chance of me getting to chapter 134 over the weekend.  Anyway, power up for Tang San. Since this is a training arc, I guess we should expect more of that.  Also, entirely new concept appears out of the blue. Or maybe not so new, psychic powers of this kind are typical for any xianxia, and it may be the author thinks we should be familiar with them already. Or he just felt like adding more powers, because hey, OP MC is OP. I guess the whole thing has been sort of foreshadowed by Tang San's previous use of mental attacks, but there I translated the same concept as 'mental strength', since it was pretty much only mentioned as defense against Tang San's psychic attacks.  Now returning you to your regularly scheduled love drama, The Sect Miss And The Sausage Uncle. That's a horrible title."

That being said, can't help but love stuff that make the MC potentially more awesome. Keep up the great work translating Bagel. We all really appreciate it man.

Because of the eye skill Tangsan already had, it became something with attacking power.  Yet, we can't assume that if Rongrong used that spirit bone, it wouldve given her an attacking power as well."
LightNovels,3dtrzn,huysje,2,Sun Jul 19 12:27:31 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  It might've enhanced her Aperture Heart ability, though, (although if it did that, it would also do that for Tang San) but that still wouldn't be an ability.  Hmm...I don't know what RongRong would've gotten for an ability."

Training Arcs are such a tease.  I wonder how the author will deal with the seven devils now that they're separated, will it be like IET in Coiling Dragon, where the 3 brothers of the magic academy are never mentioned and completely irrelevant? Or will it be more like Overlord where even the enemy seem to have as much screen time as the MC?  Hopefully the latter, in any case I have to thank you Bagelson, ATG and DD are the best Xianxia out there (frankly, the others are an entire realm below). Having chapters daily is a blessing, specially for me who is a reading addict.

LightNovels,3dts82,Pota2Lova,6,Sun Jul 19 11:34:53 2015 UTC,The author's playing up Vulcan quite a bit. Considering that most of the females in this story are stupid powerful it looks like Vulcan is going to be the first victim of that weak looking mercenary girl.  Edit: I hope that mercenary isn't Apostle Misa in disguise.
LightNovels,3dts82,Riftsaw,2,Sun Jul 19 12:00:23 2015 UTC,"Description of Misa(from chapter 44):  Misa had a cute face which still retained its youthfulness, a face that would suit a 17yr old bishoujo. From the point of view of the strict clergy, the high exposure level of her body would have been rage inducing,  and the modified robe further highlighted her beautiful feminine body line to top it off. From the tiara worn on her light pink hair, her whole body was decorated with shining ornaments, but rather than making her look overly dressed up, they only supported her sublime beauty. In fact, the shine of the numerous jewels seemed to be overshadowed in front her.   Ai's description(Chapter 80):  She had a cute face with blue eyes and long golden hair tied up in a twintails hairstyle. Although, it really failed in practicality as an adventurer. Rather an adventurer, she looked more like some town girl who decided to dress up as an adventurer. If she didn’t have her slender and small yet well toned body, she really would not have looked like an adventurer at all.   I'm not saying it isnt possible, but there would need to be some type of illusion or transformation magic involved for them to be the same person."
LightNovels,3dts82,Jaripsi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:06:13 2015 UTC,Looks like Hair color and body type are a miss. Eye color isn't mentioned on Misa's side but from the descriptions of the other apostles colors other than red are possible.  The silver bracelet the mercenary is wearing could possibly be a magic tool.   It's all guessing on my part though. I'm hoping it's not Misa because unlike Sariel she may just annihilate the lot of them Kurono included.
LightNovels,3dts82,Riftsaw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:15:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't think of that. It'd be interesting if she was, since Lily would probably end up wiping everyone except Kurono out as a result."

LightNovels,3dstge,MangoCrab,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:57:18 2015 UTC,I think the idea was that Linley's soul was way too weak and the adamant greatsword specializes in spiritual attacks. In terms of min-maxing it's more efficient for Linley to rely on his OP dragonform+physical attacks than try to use his God-level soul spiritual attacks.

If, say, it takes 5 trillion to refine a sovereign's might and he had 5.5 trillion, he'd have 500 billion left over. Not a ""huge fortune"" when compared to 5 trillion but still a huge fortune compared to what most others have.  Plus, he still had a ton of money even with the sovereign's might as evidence from that time he hired hundreds of fiends to travel."

LightNovels,3dv7vs,hebi912,7,Sun Jul 19 21:40:12 2015 UTC,First use the bait (Slice of life LN with decent plot) to catch the person.  After catching use the taser (tear jerking wuxia) to stun the person.  Then use some ropes (korean fantasy novels) to tie the person.  And finally use poison (xianxia) to finish the person.
LightNovels,3dv7vs,AtriusII,2,Sun Jul 19 22:35:00 2015 UTC,0.0 wow... that's exactly how it went for me. I didn't even realize it since I curated it all on my own.
LightNovels,3dv7vs,hebi912,2,Mon Jul 20 00:46:06 2015 UTC,I don't remember my first Japanese novel. First wuxia was condor heroes.  The first korean novel Moonlight sculpture.  And first xianxia Douluo Dalu.

LightNovels,3dv7vs,TUSF,3,Mon Jul 20 02:21:24 2015 UTC,"Mushoku Tensei:   Middle-aged jobless loser is kicked out of his family's house, only to die, and be reincarnated with a second chance at life. He decides to take life seriously this time. Also he has some destiny about having a lot of kids.  And polygamy is alright in this new world.  So is pedophilia. Just ignore it."
LightNovels,3dv7vs,Falark,6,Sun Jul 19 20:26:28 2015 UTC,"Lol, I think that would turn a lot of people away from reading Mushoku if you told them that, especially:   and polygamy is alright in this new world. So is pedophilia."
LightNovels,3dv7vs,Bananwar,2,Sun Jul 19 20:30:00 2015 UTC,"Well, it turned me away from it to be honest.   It was hard enough for me to read it when he was a perverted kid (at least the plot was interesting), but I dropped the series when it became essentially a RomCom with lots of fucking, submissive women, perverted thoughts in the most inappropriate situations  and an overall weird, penis-navigated MC.   I have issues with the depiction of women in all asian literature I've read so far though I can stand it as long as it's not  the basic plot, so I might be special that way lol."
LightNovels,3dv7vs,TheKitsch,2,Mon Jul 20 08:26:08 2015 UTC,my favorite cliche usually appears in CN where some random guy gets angry at the mc for being close to the heroine.

But the DD/MGA/CD addict in me would say epic tales of grand battles, revenge and the quest to attaining undying immortality and ultimate strength"

LightNovels,3duadl,believingunbeliever,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:57:05 2015 UTC,"It's about a Black Sorcerer called Orphen who travels around with his two buddies Cleo and Majic, that's basically the gist of it. But each story is pretty much self centered, except the first story since that's before he gathers his companions.  I recommend checking out the anime first, it'll give you a better understanding before you read it."
LightNovels,3duadl,madbil,3,Sun Jul 19 20:11:15 2015 UTC,Sorcerous Stabber Orphen   Now that's a name I have not heard in a long time.

LightNovels,3duadl,leecherleechleech,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:05:13 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure about the novel tbh, as I remember it for its bad english name and the anime which I've forgotten mostly about, it came out >10 years ago.  I think it was decent but it got overshadowed by alot of big anime released around the same time: onizuka, one piece, excel saga, digimon, initial D (among others). Well you get my point."

LightNovels,3dw0b9,JasonBuhat,8,Mon Jul 20 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"For the most part I don't mind the donations for extra chapters a week, as translating a novel is definitely a time consuming effort. The problem I have is with those translators that use this method and produce sloppy translations, or machine translate everything and try to force convert it to a readable English sentence structure.  But yeah, CD used to only have 2 free a week which was updated to 3 once Ren realized that he was offering the least amount of free chapters a week on Wuxiaworld lol."
LightNovels,3dw0b9,Exodus0128,3,Mon Jul 20 00:31:12 2015 UTC,"Actually Ren doesn't take donations for CD anymore, now what happens is the donations to other projects on WuxiaWorld count for CD as well, so if you donate 20 for MGA it adds 20 for CD as well."
LightNovels,3dw0b9,Rousen1991,2,Mon Jul 20 00:56:08 2015 UTC,"I know, never said anything about Ren specifically with donations, only that he now does 3 free up from 2.  I used free instead of regular because you're technically still paying if you want more sponsored chapters, just to other translators on WW. Don't get me wrong, I fully support all those translators and have donated to all of them, and Ren helping to support the work of the other translators is amazing, as it helps us get more of the Xianxia we all love!  But back to this Novel, Ze Tian Ji is great too. If its one of those series I look forward to reading every week, I have no problem hitting that donate button."
LightNovels,3dw0b9,Exodus0128,3,Mon Jul 20 01:03:32 2015 UTC,They have 3 regular chapters a week. its pretty little compared to the bigger ones like cd and stuff but its only because ztj is rly hard to translate apparently.
LightNovels,3dw0b9,Bananaman612,3,Mon Jul 20 00:18:37 2015 UTC,Cd has 2 regular chapters a week.  You crazy.
LightNovels,3dw0b9,Slightly_Misleading,2,Mon Jul 20 00:23:00 2015 UTC,I think he's updated it to 3 chapters a week.
LightNovels,3dw0b9,Jacobobob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:28:05 2015 UTC,"it's actually 2 free chapter a day till the end of translation,  a while ago Ren decided to stop taking donations and instead counts donations towards other wuxiaworld groups for the queue"
LightNovels,3dw0b9,bbaabb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:00:32 2015 UTC,"He stopped taking donations for cd, but donating for other novels on his site clears the queue for cd too. Which is why we were getting so many MGA and ATG chapters."
LightNovels,3dw0b9,Jacobobob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:29:10 2015 UTC,Yea people seem to forget how many donations have gone into keeping CD at maximum output for so long.
LightNovels,3dw0b9,jp3885,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:24:47 2015 UTC,oh. then mga
LightNovels,3dw0b9,Bananaman612,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:49:20 2015 UTC,CD only has 3 free chapters and it used to be less.  Its the that the Queue is always filled by its fans.  most are like that except for MGA
LightNovels,3dw0b9,NotoriusNC,2,Mon Jul 20 00:24:57 2015 UTC,"CD doesn't take anymore donations.  It is 3 chapters per week and any donations donated to the other projects at the site are also added to the CD queue.  However, it has seen a ridiculous amount of donations.  It was being translated at 3 chapters a day for 3-4 months with only 2 freebies a week."
LightNovels,3dw0b9,thinktank001,3,Mon Jul 20 00:37:07 2015 UTC,"Well last time i check it's not necessary to donate for a chapter, because he usually does atleast one chapter a day but if you do donate he'll do more  (last time i check was about 1-2 weeks ago so i might be wrong)"

LightNovels,3dskxm,ShadowDragon777,17,Sun Jul 19 01:28:56 2015 UTC,I like how he easily made friends with battle-crazy demon lord girl and the other two's reaction. The human group's meeting at the city should be amusing.

LightNovels,3dskxm,misogichan,6,Sun Jul 19 02:09:02 2015 UTC,and she staying on the side till she gets the ok from him.   That is literally the opposite of what I'm imagining.

LightNovels,3dskxm,japzone,5,Sun Jul 19 03:07:46 2015 UTC,"More like it's a requirement that she keeps it. It was already elaborated on last chapter that monsters and demons can't tell lies, especially higher ranked ones, without being erased room existence our something. So she has to keep that promise and her lack of a deceptive personality also prevents her from working around it. Theoretically."
LightNovels,3dskxm,misogichan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:23:57 2015 UTC,"I imagine whether it's a lie or not is determined by whether it's true or not by the monster's own definition.  I could be wrong but I'm guessing as long as Millim doesn't define what she does as ""make problems"" then she's alright.  And what do you know the next chapter's title is Millim's ""Commotion.""  See she's not making any ""problems."""
LightNovels,3dskxm,japzone,2,Sun Jul 19 03:56:03 2015 UTC,"True.  Though a commotion being caused by her is kinda obvious. Of course Rimuru walking in and saying, ""Look who came to visit, a Demon Lord!"" Would naturally cause a commotion."

He has emotions and can make us laugh but can still be a logical and methodical person(?). Better than a lot of the other MCs out there with stupid/robot personalities."
LightNovels,3dskxm,jp3885,9,Sun Jul 19 03:28:42 2015 UTC,The fact that he has no facial features as a slime probably helps with interactions.
