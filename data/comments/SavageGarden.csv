SavageGarden,3e3y1z,ps3isawesome,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:48:37 2015 UTC,"When people do that with roses they just use regular food-grade coloring, so yeah. Same stuff for making colorful cakes."
SavageGarden,3e3y1z,grottohopper,2,Wed Jul 22 02:01:59 2015 UTC,"When flowers are colored with dye, it's done with cut flowers, not whole plants.

SavageGarden,3e1jqn,james26685,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:54 2015 UTC,I have had one of these for a year now.. The main growth point died off and there are probably 30 or so plants popping up from the roots.  It really has a hard time on my grow rack under t5's even in live sphagnum. Think it is heat stress and humidity dropping down to the 30's that it does not like.  I am putting some of my new plants into a small terrarium to see if they fair better there.. Have also thought about making a humidity dome with a clear plastic cup for my ones not in a terrarium.

The odds of this happening are far slimmer than a male of any species and a female of any species being in bloom at the same time. Imagine having to gather up multiple separate clones of every species you want to work with and hoping you end up with a female (nepenthes are ~75% male).

SavageGarden,3e0ptk,Melvar_10,2,Tue Jul 21 01:43:31 2015 UTC,"you're doing well so far, the plants look good. the flytrap will definitely appreciate full sun, as long as you properly acclimate it to prevent sudden shock.  a good soil mixture is between 1/1 and 2/1 peat moss and perlite. I like to use a mixture of perlite and coarse sand myself but either will work. this soil will work for vfts and sarracenia. It helps to wet it before you put it in the pot. make sure you don't use products with added fertilizer, and no 'beach sand' that may have salt.  the sarracenia looks pretty happy, you could wait till next year to repot it, if you do repot it don't disturb the roots too much, just put the root ball in the larger pot and fill around with your new mix.  the flytrap I would repot soon, definitely before it goes into dormancy. you can see that the sphagnum is wrapped tightly around the bulb and over time that will suffocate it. [edited to add, on second look it doesn't look as tightly wound up as I feared, repotting is probably not urgent.] when you repot it you'll see that it'll have just a few long straight roots, simply poke a deep hole in the soil, dangle the roots down into it until the white parts of the plant are below the soil surface, and then push the soil closed around it.  Both of these plant will like a winter dormancy period. they might do ok outside in the winter, or might need special arrangements. how severe are the winters in your area, or what usda hardiness zone do you reside in?"
SavageGarden,3e0ptk,YourRealMom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:11 2015 UTC,"the flytrap will definitely appreciate full sun, as long as you properly acclimate it to prevent sudden shock.   Alright, thanks!   a good soil mixture is between 1/1 and 2/1 peat moss and perlite.   Can you explain this, idk what the whole 1/1 and 2/1 means sadly.   the sarracenia looks pretty happy, you could wait till next year to repot it   Alright, and when I do, should I do the peat moss mix? Because the current soil is working fine, so not sure.   how severe are the winters in your area   Its SoCal, San Bernardino. Winters rarely reach below 40F at night. And I'm not sure if we will have rain.   what usda hardiness zone do you reside in   Not sure what that means?  Thanks for the tips!"
SavageGarden,3e0ptk,YourRealMom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:07:43 2015 UTC,"ok, so 1/1 peat and perlite would be equal parts of each. so for say, a gallon of soil, you'd use half a gallon of peat and half a gallon of perlite. 2/1 would be two thirds peat and one third perlite.  some other growers from CA may be able to elaborate, but I would say they can stay outside year round. if anything my worry is that it might not get quite cold enough to induce a healthy dormancy. in which case you could put them in the fridge for a couple months a year, but 40s is probably ok as the seasonal daylength changes count more than temperature itself. you might also think about putting them in a partial shade location during severe heatwaves, anything over 100 and some partial shade will ease stress for them."

What about the freezer?   putting them in a partial shade location during severe heatwaves, anything over 100 and some partial shade will ease stress for them   Okay, it does get over 100F many times where I live. I'll make an area that recieve direct sun but also is shady for much of the day. That should be fine, right?

SavageGarden,3duf19,violated_tortoise,2,Sun Jul 19 22:14:53 2015 UTC,Often both. Usually the node just below the cut will put out a new shoot and sometimes new basal nodes will form as well.

SavageGarden,3dlrlw,lecramstar,2,Fri Jul 17 11:04:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the issue. It's best to feed them live prey, but it can be rather difficult. A method I successfully use is putting the container with a live insect in the freezer for ~15 minutes. It slows them down greatly, so you can easily put them in an open trap.   However, you can feed it dead prey if you stimulate the trap by gently rubbing if between your fingers after feeding it. I do not have a lot of experience with this method though.   A small side note to feeding Flytraps: Don't overfeed it and make sure the traps can completely seal, so the prey inside won't start to rot.   Have fun!"
SavageGarden,3dlrlw,lecramstar,3,Fri Jul 17 11:20:59 2015 UTC,Thanks. I tried to stimulate a spastic fly spasming and I think it may have worked. 15m in the freezer for me freezes the fly dead :( ill try 5 next time.

SavageGarden,3dgif5,james26685,2,Fri Jul 17 15:43:23 2015 UTC,here is a neat trick to discourage squirrels. Line the edge of your pots with plastic forks with the pointy ends sticking up. Also place them 3 inches apart throughout the soil. I snap off the length of the forks I don't need. Squirrels don't want to sit on pokey things when easier food is available. Think of it as the spikes cities use to discourage pidgins

The traps only have so long of a life span as they can only open and close so many times before they die off, we just use a sharp pair of scissors and snip it off as close to the base as possible.  I'm not sure what type of climate you have but if you have a winter it will need to go into dormancy, your plant looks like it's thriving so I would wait to replant it until after its just coming out of its dormancy.  As for soil, all we use is peat moss (make sure it's not enriched) and perlite and mix them at 50/50. This is not expensive at all where I'm from. They key is to not have any nutrients in the soil and never to fertilize, they get all their nutrients from the bugs they eat.  One last tip is we never water our VTR's from the top of the pot, we keep ours in about an inch deep tray and just fill the tray to the top as it is needed with rain water or distilled water, depending on where your from most tap water could kill the plant."

Remember that it can handle a LOT of water. Like I have mine in a small reservoir of water at all times.   As your plant grows, you'll see new leaves unfurl from the center of the plant, while the lowest ones slowly die off from the tip in. Clip them if you want, but I just don't bother with them anymore, since my one plant has become 6.   If anything, I'd say maybe keep your plant out of intense direct sunlight (i.e. 90º+ weather), as they can/will get sunburned (some of your yellow-ish leaves look so). I keep mine on a window sill (~10 hours of sunlight per day), and it grows like crazy."

It's not a problem if the plant is regularly repotted; the moss would just get discarded.  It can grow so thick and become so dense that it can squeeze and strangle the plant's rhizome and will kill seedlings.

SavageGarden,3d0ttt,SpaceTruth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:34:13 2015 UTC,"How did you adjust it?  Something like keeping it in shade, but moving it for increasingly long periods to direct sunlight?

For me, that was making sure the plant was happy on my windowsill, getting decent amount of filtered light throughout the day and dealing with shock of being shipped in a box.   Then I would just gradually increase the intensity of light, from a shady spot outside to full sun. I am located in NC.  I was inspired by :  http://www.nepenthesaroundthehouse.com/light.htm  ""All of my Nepenthes are grown in full sun except for my lowlanders...""  He (she?) talks about the importance of waxy coating that prevents Neps from losing too much water. I've also noticed this with my N. truncata, as it almost turned into a glossy cactus.  This was many years ago when I was in middle school though, so I would advise caution.  I'm actually now interested in perhaps buying one of those, since you have success germinating them.

It was the first thing you mentioned in your post so maybe you already suspect it.  If you change the water, change the dirt too because if it was the water, whatever was in it already has accumulated in the dirt.  Please describe more about how you're growing it, like where you have it and how much light it gets and what kind of light.  Light is VERY important for sundews because it takes a lot of energy to make dew, and it also needs photosynthesis to be able to make use of any food it gets.  I also don't have much experience with the growth habits of spatulata, but I know adelae spontaneously 'dies'.  When it does that I cut everything down to the dirt and the roots send up new young shoots after about a month.  I'm not sure spatulata does that though."

I repotted it into a mixture of LFS, perlite and white aquarium sand, I'm going to try to use distilled water . I've been using NYC tap water, because I read in the NYC 2014 Drinking Water Supply and Quality Report that the TDS of NYC water ranges from 41 - 63 mg/L, and I also found many nyc residents on flytrap and reef forum reporting their tap water TDS reading ranging from 43-53ppm.

I received a 'B52' a while ago and am still trying to locate it amongst the collection but there are too many to sort through. I've purchased from sites before that claim it's one thing and it ends up being another. It could also be from that.  Oddly enough I am finding that although many of the plants seem to be from the same grower, there is quite a bit of variety going on from plant to plant as they mature. This wouldn't normally be an issue but I could only assume that the grower is growing their stock via tissue culture, asexual propagation, or cloning (whichever one you want to call it) There just isn't enough uniformity with them as they mature. I wonder if they might even be growing their stock from seed which would explain the variety."
SavageGarden,3cv09z,Sashoke,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:48:11 2015 UTC,"As he said, each plant is a unique individual if it was grown from seed. There are so many ridiculous cultivars out there itd be impossible to tell you if this was one of them, and quite frankly it doesnt matter. Id just say its a ""typical.""  If the plants you get from him are of a very large variety in characteristics, its likely hes growing from seed, which isnt exactly unheard of, its the oldest way known to propogate something after all ;)"

SavageGarden,3cswrf,GliscorN,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:12:26 2015 UTC,Ebay is typically a pretty good place. Just make sure you're buying from someone who seems to be a lower volume seller and has good feedback.  ICPS seedbank is another good one. Flytrapstore.com sells seeds too.

SavageGarden,3cswrf,AaaaNinja,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:25:12 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like carnivorous plant societies. Most ship worldwide.   Some, like the Victorian Carnivorous Plant Society will sell some seeds to non-members. (Although, honestly, if you want some cool seeds, you should join. Just take a look at their list and you'll see why). Others, like the Carnivorous Plant Society limit the number of seeds you can buy per year.  There are also some private sellers who will ship worldwide.   Quite honestly, the key to buying seed is knowing when it was harvested.** If the seller doesn't know or doesn't list the date of harvest, don't buy it.** That seed is probably either fake or dud seed. Sellers should also be able to tell you how they store seed. If it's not in a manner that will lead to the seed retaining a high rate of viability, you shouldn't buy it. It will likely not germinate.  As a general rule, I try to avoid eBay seed, unless I know the seller."

Treat them like VFT seeds anyway and hope for the best because it's my experience that just about any type of seed will sprout under VFT conditions at least to test viability. What if they come from a giant VFT? And you didn't give them a chance? Or what if they turn into sesame grass?

My mixes came with separate envelopes it is not like they mixed nepenthes seeds with sarracenia seeds. I have been purchasing seeds through eBay sellers now for 3+ years and have never gotten burned. But you do have to know what you are buying, and spend some time researching the seller this is why they have a feedback tool.  Good luck finding any rare stuff (like petiolaris complex seeds) outside of eBay. Also it seems like 95% of the time issues (excluding the rainbow roses & keeping it carnivorous) are with vft seeds how often you see people getting burned on capensis seeds? So maybe be extra cautious if you are buying vft seeds? Also viewing what other items the seller is listing can be helpful. If they are selling other carnivores especially plants along side seeds they are probably legit if they are also selling rainbow roses, little shop of horrors Audrey plants or super Mario plants skip them."

This plant here needs more Sunlight. A LOT more.  Acclimate it to full Sun outside. Rain or distilled water only.
SavageGarden,3cfy2v,mobscura,2,Tue Jul 7 21:38:50 2015 UTC,It could reduce the amount of light for the plant. Keep it outside in direct sunlight if that's possible.

SavageGarden,3cfy2v,YourRealMom,2,Tue Jul 7 19:26:20 2015 UTC,"even though they let most visible light through, they reduce the intensity of light available for photosynthesis. In a window they'll need more sunlight than they would absolutely require outdoors, but even outdoors you can't give them too much. if you can't find a place with longer direct exposure, you can supplement with a lamp. get a cfl bulb with a color temperature of 65k (65000) or so, a desk lamp with a conical reflector is best, lining the reflector with something like aluminum foil will help squeeze out every available lumen. keep the bulb 8-10 inches from the plant and the lamp on for 12 hours a day in the summer, decreasing that as the days shorten in fall."
SavageGarden,3cfy2v,I_really_am_Batman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:09:33 2015 UTC,I usually kept it as a desk buddy next to my window. But yeah I want it to be healthy so I will try and move it to someplace outdoors.
SavageGarden,3cfy2v,YourRealMom,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:32:33 2015 UTC,"make sure you gradually acclimate if you move it to full sun, a week of partial shade first will help ease the stress.  windows are almost opaque to UV rays, so the huge increase in UV light is the most shocking part of the transition for the plant.  water will also evaporate a lot faster outside, so be prepared to adjust your watering regimen."

I see them being sold in tissue culture vials. But potted plants on the rare time you find them on eBay usually end up selling for $50.00+ I have even seen them listed with a $75.00 starting bid and still sell.  Whenever you find someone outside of eBay selling  them ( carnivorous plant nursery, Hawian botanicals) , they are always sold out. And I never see seeds for this one for sale anywhere.. I see seeds for other petiolaris complex dews from time to time, but never D. Falconeri unless it is hybridized.  No one has two genetically different plants to produce seed?"
SavageGarden,3ca1qc,james26685,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:21:00 2015 UTC,This is the only place I know to get one at a decent price and you will have the hassle of trying to acclimate something grown invitro to survive outside the jar.. Hard enough with something that isn't hard to grow in the first place. But if eBay doesn't work out at least you have options..

Leaving it as nutrient less environment and so no trees can grow because they don't get enough nutrients. It's the reason Venus fly traps catch their own food.

SavageGarden,3c1zbg,Wefferson,2,Sat Jul 4 00:44:14 2015 UTC,I've heard growing sundews from seeds are actually quite easy and wondered if it's possible with mine. The picture shows the whole stalk has almost all bloomed and I'm wondering if anyone might know the next steps to take! :) Thank you!
SavageGarden,3c1zbg,YourRealMom,7,Sat Jul 4 00:49:20 2015 UTC,"sure, cape sundews are pretty easy to grow from seeds and you should see the seedlings in around a month depending on conditions.  once the stalk has finished blooming, the seed pods will start to turn black or dark brown and dry out. once you see the pods start to split a little bit, you can cut them and put them in an open plastic bag or a jar or a folded paper sleeve to finish drying (whatever you use, allowing air is important to keep them from growing mold) allow a bit of time for the pods to dry and decide where you'll plant the seeds. an easy choice is to just spinkle some around in the same pot as your adult plant. or you can mix up some soil and prepare new pots. once the soil is prepared and the pods are dry, gently squeeze and roll the pods over the soil to spinkle out the tiny seeds. they're seriously like dust. you could also collect the seeds in a container or on a sheet of paper and then sprinkle them on the soil. either way, just sprinkle them over the surface, keep them moist, and wait! cape sundews are pretty forgiving, so you could let them sprout in full sun or partial, with a humidity dome or without, just don't use a humidity dome in full sun or it'll bake them. in a month you should have lots of tiny seedlings.  edited to add: plants look great by the way!"

SavageGarden,3bvx9r,yamirai89,2,Thu Jul 2 16:16:07 2015 UTC,yeah if it's aquarium stone it should be inert. I haven't used similar material myself so I can't speak to it's efficacy as a soil component but I can't see it causing any particular problems all else being equal.
SavageGarden,3bvx9r,YourRealMom,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:49:45 2015 UTC,I found that some aquarium gravel stones are enriched with chemical compounds for fertilizing water plants. I am not sure I wanna risk it. Anyway can I use only pure peat moss? I read it is too dense and there is no aeration.
SavageGarden,3bvx9r,AddictivePotential,4,Thu Jul 2 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not a savage gardener but I've been growing aquatic plants for about 2yrs now (and regular plants for many years). I've never seen a product in aquatic stores or online that has aquarium gravel + fertilizer. Do you recall the name of it? There are products like flourite, which looks like aquarium gravel. And there is sand with beneficial bacteria strains.   Any product like that will be muuuch more expensive and specifically say it's for aquatic plants. It will also have the fertilizer chemicals & their percentage listed on the back of the bag. So you'll be like, ""why is this bag of goddamn rocks $20? And why are there pictures of plants all over the packaging?""  Generally good aquarium products shouldn't ""give off"" any harmful chemicals/toxic levels of fertilizer, as animals like fish and shrimp are very sensitive to dissolved minerals and chemicals. Even so, we always rinse off products like sand, fluorite, and gravel with some tap water before we use it so that the dust/small particles are thoroughly rinsed away."
SavageGarden,3bvx9r,ButteredScrimp,2,Fri Jul 3 00:07:32 2015 UTC,Yeah youre right. Any cheap aquarium substrate is inert. The only stuff you would need to worry about is ADA substrate since it is packed with ammonia to help with the aquarium cycle. But that costs like $60 a bag.
SavageGarden,3bvx9r,Duckstiff,2,Fri Jul 3 04:32:32 2015 UTC,"Well where I live I am not sure where I can buy perlite. My mother has bought the gravel from aquarium shop for our snake. But they decided not to use it so i thought maybe it could be good idea to use it for the plants but firstly I always do a research. So what about this Wikipedia reference:  For freshwater aquaria, gravel is the most common substrate. When growing aquatic plants, the Cation Exchange Capacity[8] (CEC) is also an important thing to consider when choosing a substrate. CEC is the ability to absorb positively charged nutrient ions (so high CEC is good). This means the substrate will hold nutrients and make them available for the plant roots. It doesn’t indicate the amount of nutrients the substrate contains."
SavageGarden,3bvx9r,Zitroneneis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:49:01 2015 UTC,"Your gravel will be inert, it just means it will absorb and retain some nutrients from the water when in a fish tank. You can get super effective clay for this, like the above I have ran many. planted tanks.   In your plant pot, with rain water you will have no issue, though.  I would just give it a good rinse as its usually really dusty.   What I do is just buy a small bag of CP soil and then cut it with pebbles (like yours) and perlite. Lots of oxygen for the roots but can drain a bit too quickly. Fortunately where I live there is a lot of rain."

Would rather make species rather than hybrids so I'm stuck at the moment. Excited for you-- be sure to keep two or three individual plants of each species for future propagation of species seed!
SavageGarden,3btf88,phamdamfromnam,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:40:19 2015 UTC,"I will definitely keep a few plants for seed generation.  I got my D. Lanata here so probably clones. You should still be able to propagate through leaf pullings no?   Not sure if it works with D. Falconeri, I would love to get some seeds for those."
SavageGarden,3btf88,phamdamfromnam,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:14:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, leaf pullings are the normal way of doing things but if you've seen the entire complex, there is just way too much wonderful genetic diversity to just be satisfied with a single clone. Species like ordensis have different colored traps from yellow to orange to red as you jump from clone to clone. One of my favorites, that I still yet have to get is aff. lanata ""flying fox""  Falconeri is one of the easiest to propagate via leaf pullings. The trend is, the hairier the dew, the harder it is to propagate via leaf pullings. Such a shame since ordensis is so rare in most collections enough as it is."
SavageGarden,3bur5i,Kleinric,6,Thu Jul 2 08:59:59 2015 UTC,definitely scale insects. one simple way to treat the infestation is to use a q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol to wipe off the 'scales' which are actually tiny insects. you'll have to check and treat the plant regularly for awhile to make sure the population isn't coming back. it's definitely a good idea to put some space between the affected plants and the rest of your collection until you get it under control. the worst thing is that sometimes ants will carry the scale insects to new plants to expand their 'farm'.  more on pesticides and pest treatment for carnivorous plants

SavageGarden,3bt8jh,BetterButterflies,2,Wed Jul 1 23:22:35 2015 UTC,"if they're mexican butterworts (which I think they are) they can go into a pseudo dormant state, where they grow smaller succulent leaves which don't capture prey. typically what you want to do during this stage is reduce watering and humidity a bit, there's some controversy. some people just keep them in static condition and they do ok. I think it's generally agreed however that they don't do well in peat heavy mixes like venus flytraps do. many people grow them in mixes with more sand, perlite, pumice, or even turface and vermiculite, with very little or no peat or a small amount of long fiber sphagnum.  in any case, you can't keep them with the venus flytraps longterm, since venus flytraps need a cold dark dormancy and mexican butterworts do more of a dry dormancy without major temperature or light exposure changes.  there are a lot of good informative websites on the sidebar, spend a little time reading about mexican butterworts and then compare what you've read to the conditions you have to see what changes you might make."
SavageGarden,3bt8jh,YourRealMom,0,Thu Jul 2 03:50:11 2015 UTC,Butterworts are a tropical plant.  Venus Flytraps are a temperate plant.  If it's a mexican butterwort they like hot and dry conditions.  They look like they have crown rot.  There isn't really a very effective cure for it.  Why are there chunks missing?  Were you cutting the leaves off?

SavageGarden,3brbdw,lecramstar,3,Wed Jul 1 15:12:04 2015 UTC,"You just got the plant, it was growing in completely different conditions before you. It will go through an acclimation period where all the old leaves will brown and die.   If you can't ask the previous grower what kind of light conditions it had, assume it was in a greenhouse with shade cloth.

SavageGarden,3bprif,fappingisgreat,3,Wed Jul 1 04:10:26 2015 UTC,"There is only one pitcher that gets its water from rain; Sarracenia purpurea, and maybe some of its hybrids as well.  The rain-gathering variety uses bacterial action to help digest its prey.  Sarracenia leucophylla creates its own digestive enzymes.  If rainwater were to enter the pitcher, it would dilute the enzymes.  It would also make the pitcher heavy and knock it over; water is veeeery heavy.  You'll notice that the rain-catching varieties are very short and fat so they're able to support all of the weight of the rainwater that they catch.  You'll also notice that the not-rainwater-catching variety has lids positioned over their mouths to keep rain OUT.  I have never observed liquid in my own sarracenia.  it's too deep down to be able to see, but the plant is digesting its food just fine.  You don't have to worry about whether there is fluid in there at all.  It's not even where you are able to see it."

I literally still have the first Nepenthes I ever had; a sanguinea.  Truncata also grows great in windowsills.  They get direct morning sun.  Truncata has the potential to grow gigantic pitchers, but it's not very colorful, lol.  I got it because of the shape of the leaves, but once when it grew a pitcher as long as the length of my thumb I was impressed by the sharp red stripes.  Our ventricosa x 'Lady Pauline' is doing super well right now.  Every leaf is forming a pitcher.  I've only ever grown my nepenthes in a window.  Sanguinea definitely has done well in our window.  I don't know about ventricosa but our hybrid is doing great.  I have no experience with ventrata or miranda."
SavageGarden,3bgghq,AaaaNinja,2,Mon Jun 29 02:25:13 2015 UTC,"Adding to AaaaNinja's response, All of the species/hybrids you mentioned are great starters.    Ventrata is probably the fastest growing, and can quickly become almost like a weed in the proper conditions. The pitchers aren't all that showy, and they will be roughly 8"" tall on a mature plant, and 2-4"" on most starter plants.  Ventricosa, while an easy species, seems to be the slowest growing of the bunch. Its is one of the parents in the Ventrata hybrid. basically when you google N. ventricosa, what you see is what you get, not a ton of variation there. Pitchers will remain a bit smaller, with larger pitchers being around 6-8"" tall.  Sanguinea is also a bit slow growing, but not quite to the extent of ventricosa, at least in my experience. The pitchers are a bit more showy, especially under proper lighting conditions. As the plant matures, pitchers may reach up to 12"" in length. Miranda probably has the most showy pitchers, with red speckling and a bright mouth. It is very hardy, tolerant of almost all conditions, and grows fairly quickly. When smaller pitchers will only be a few inches tall, but when full grown, may grow larger than 12"".    As a note, I have grown all of these in almost full sun (they were right next to my vft's and sarracenia during the summer) as well as just a bright window. They take a little while to adjust to the different conditions, but once they do, they seem to do well regardless. The exception to this was the ventricosa, which did not seem to appreciate the extra sun and had to be shaded.   So which of these would I reccommend? probably the Miranda or the ventrata. These two seem to be the most hardy and tolerant of different conditions, and are also fast growers. Are the other options bad? no, but those are just the two I would recommend. All would probably do well, and so honestly, I would say just look around at pictures and see what you like best.   As far as where to buy, it doesn't really matter too much. As long as it is a reputable seller (see the list of nurseries posted in the sidebar), then they should be fine. It probably just comes down to cost and availability."
SavageGarden,3bgghq,bloks1995,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:32:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate the descriptions. It seems like most common varieties are a bit more hardy and easier to care for than I expected. I think I'll start looking for an N. Miranda online!"
SavageGarden,3bgghq,GliscorN,2,Mon Jun 29 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"As long as you don't let them fry/freeze/dry out, and can provide a reasonable temperature drop at night, then plenty of Nepenthes will do fine. The ones you listed are notoriously forgiving and definitely qualify as bulletproof, not that it's a bad thing though. There are lots of other beginner-friendly plants out there, for example most ventricosa/spathulata/mira/robcantleyi hybrids will be easy, and a bit more interesting than the standard factory-produced stuff. They're all pretty cheap, so I'd say just go with what you think looks nicest!"

SavageGarden,3b93jl,Bomberx57,2,Fri Jun 26 23:45:49 2015 UTC,You can mix orthene (fire ant killer) and water to make a spray that acts as a systemic pesticide. I think flytrap care has a guide on it. I ended up doing that and it's super effective. It's pretty nasty stuff though so make sure to read the guide for the exact details and take safety precautions.

It takes care of spider mites though."
SavageGarden,3b7ptz,Decapod73,5,Fri Jun 26 17:18:33 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, you should try to avoid having plants shipped to you when it is very cold where you are (or where they're shipping from) or very hot. Try to aim for spring or fall. That said, some plants are more often available at one time or another -   Seeds are most frequently available in the late summer/fall for Sarrs, VFTs, temperate Drosera, and other temperate plants. Seeds for Neps and tropicals are available year round.  Rhizomes are ordinarily divided when the plant is dormant. You'll see cheaper plants in spring or fall (at least for Sarrs and VFTs). Sarrs can be shipped as dormant tubers. Most VFT owners will only ship VFTs after they start growing a bit.  Pygmy Drosera are most often available as gemmae, and these are frequently available in fall.  The plants that don't go dormant are available year round."

SavageGarden,3b52wh,dennynnnnnn,5,Fri Jun 26 01:10:42 2015 UTC,"Many neps will grow a little slow while they are adjusting to new conditions, and if it is a N. ventricosa (likely if you said it came from lowe's) they grow a little slower than some others anyways. It looks fine, other than the leaves that are a little sunburnt towards the bottom. It should be fine as it makes new leaves though, and will begin to pitcher soon.

SavageGarden,3b52wh,bloks1995,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:27:14 2015 UTC,"usually the light from the window should be fine, but if you feel like it, some sort of light can be used. I'm not so sure how most people feel about ""grow bulbs"", but in the past I know that it was a good idea to avoid those, and just use a fluorescent bulb because they produce less heat and more of the light the plants need. That was several years ago, so things may have changed, so I would recommend either making a new thread about lighting or searching around for other opinions. Like I said though, as long as the window gets enough light, the plants should be fine. You will notice that the neps slow down dramatically in winter time, and this is completely normal."
SavageGarden,3b1aa8,ShittyDBZGuitarRiffs,15,Thu Jun 25 04:02:49 2015 UTC,"yeah, you can salvage them. first, dig the rhizomes out of the muck and rinse them well in distilled water. frankly, the soil they package those things with is not great quality anyway. if you can, rinse the sphagnum moss well and use it to wrap the roots, keep the wrapped up plants someplace out of direct sunlight until you can make some fresh soil mix. a day or even two will probably be fine.  a good simple soil mix is 2 parts peat moss and 1 part perlite. make sure they don't have added fertilizers. I like to use some coarse sand too, but it can be difficult to find the right kind of sand (no 'beach sand' which may contain salt). mix up the peat and perlite and then wet the mix well before you pot the plants. you want the crown of the plant to be at the soil surface. for pitcher plants that means the big root at or juuuust below surface, for the vft it means white parts below soil, green parts above.  while you're at it, and since you'll probably have the materials for a fairly large portion of soil, you should think about buying a larger pot for the pitcher plant and probably a deeper one for the flytrap. pitcher plants like about a cubic foot of root space and flytrap pots should ideally be six inches or more deep. if you get a big one you can plant them in the same pot."
SavageGarden,3b1aa8,YourRealMom,7,Thu Jun 25 04:29:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. I've dug up and rinsed the roots of both with distilled water and wrapped them with well rinsed moss.

When they go dormant (I don't know the climate of where you live) they should be repotted for the next growing season.  These plants can grow to fill a pot.  The venus flytrap has a lot of offshoots that look like they can be spread out when you repot, and the sarracenia has a rhizome that will grow new grow points and divide and stuff.  It also will spread to fill a pot.  They can be planted together."

I picked up a VFT and a Sarracenia, both pictured in the link.  I have some questions on their future.   Will the size of my plants (the number of leaves) increase as the plants get older? Will I need to increase the size of their current bowls? How soon? If I wanted to create a mini-bog container, should I plant these 2 plants together? or should they have separate pots? (it appears that they CAN be planted together, but whats the recommendation?) If I get a larger planter pot, should I get additional plants to fill the pot up? or will the plants grow to use the whole pot? Would it be stupid to plant these 2 plants by themselves in a large pot now?   Thanks!"
SavageGarden,3b1cg1,mobscura,3,Thu Jun 25 04:31:36 2015 UTC,"The answer to all your questions is yes.  do you intend to keep the minibog outdoors? if so the pitcher plant will spread and divide over a few seasons. probably in four summers it would fill a decent minibog container. the flytrap will also divide yearly, from the photo it looks to me like that one could already be divided into at least four plants, although I would wait till next spring to divide it.  I like planting vfts and pitchers together, it gives some variety to a large pot, and the vfts seem to do well even if they get a bit crowded by the pitcher plants. I just make sure none are getting too squished when I do my spring maintenance and repot the ones getting overrun.  if you repot this year, it's probably best to do a simple slip potting without disturbing the roots too much now that we're well into the growing season. with full sunlight and high temperatures, messing with the roots can mean dehydrated plants."

SavageGarden,3aueve,javamoss,3,Tue Jun 23 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"I wasn't going to mention anything, but I'm noticing it too. I'm totally open to feedback (negative or not), but the voting system here makes it so easy to be petty for little reason, unfortunately.  I've seen it happen frequently with blog links, so maybe the users here don't like those kinds of posts (even though we have a list of carnivorous plant blogs in the sidebar, and self-promotion isn't against the rules).   It's partially why I don't post my blog often here lately. But I'm still happy to answer questions and help new growers. That's all I'm really trying to do."
SavageGarden,3aueve,dalidala,3,Tue Jun 23 19:45:18 2015 UTC,"I have noticed this as well, it is always against blog posts (especially Natch Greyes' for some reason) I guess people dont like the self promotion like you said.  It might also be how weird the entry criteria was (liking facebook pages, tweeting about it ect.) seemed like free advertising.

SavageGarden,3aw7eq,simpleGREENZ,5,Wed Jun 24 00:14:32 2015 UTC,I think I'd just leave them be.
SavageGarden,3aw7eq,ephemer_al,2,Wed Jun 24 01:08:06 2015 UTC,ok. they're ugly but i guess they'll blow away eventually
SavageGarden,3aw7eq,grottohopper,3,Wed Jun 24 01:17:30 2015 UTC,"Leave them there, it would be worse for the plant if you accidentally trigger the trap. You could try gently blowing but I'd suggest leaving them since they are doing no harm. Maybe the husk will attract another victim."
SavageGarden,3aw7eq,YourRealMom,2,Wed Jun 24 04:28:46 2015 UTC,"if they're outdoors, they usually don't last long. if you're indoors you can try spritzing it with a spray bottle of distilled water to dislodge it. one quick squirt normally won't trigger the trap or stress it. tweezers are also ok but you risk a little more disturbance. still not the end of the world if you accidentally set it off."

SavageGarden,3aw7eq,yorrellew,2,Wed Jun 24 19:49:57 2015 UTC,Give them a blow or push the exoskeletons out with a toothpick or something like that. In nature the rain and wind is supposed to knock it out so you do the same!

SavageGarden,3apwda,ephemer_al,10,Mon Jun 22 15:24:56 2015 UTC,I belive that happens when the trap eats something too large for it to close properly. It's normal and nothing to worry about.
SavageGarden,3apwda,I_really_am_Batman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:04:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I read about this.  If the trap can't seal up its meal then bacteria and fungus have access to it and the meal decomposes.  Sometimes the trap succumbs.  Sometimes it's okay.  I've seen traps finish their meals safely even though its prey's legs are sticking out everywhere."
SavageGarden,3apwda,AaaaNinja,3,Mon Jun 22 21:54:03 2015 UTC,"It should produce new growth soon, if its getting enough sunlight etc. The traps will die back but the plant will survive if its a healthy one"
SavageGarden,3apwda,YourRealMom,2,Mon Jun 22 20:23:32 2015 UTC,Should the dying traps be removed?
SavageGarden,3apwda,I_really_am_Batman,2,Mon Jun 22 17:39:24 2015 UTC,If you remove them it won't hurt the plant and if you leave them on it also won't affect the over all health of the plant. I usually do for aesthetic purposes.
SavageGarden,3apwda,DannyFanny,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:54:06 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to mine, it had an insect in each trap and died within a week"
SavageGarden,3apwda,I_really_am_Batman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:10:46 2015 UTC,Each trap died or the whole plant died? And it had every trap over filled?
SavageGarden,3apwda,DannyFanny,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"The whole plant did. They weren't over filled, but each head had an insect in. Not sure of it's accuracy but I read somewhere if the plants quite small and all the heads are full, it can kill the  plant."
SavageGarden,3apwda,AaaaNinja,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:59:32 2015 UTC,The green parts are still photosynthesizing so just remove the black parts if you do.

SavageGarden,3amwvt,CarlosFromPhilly,4,Sun Jun 21 20:11:53 2015 UTC,What you have in the picture does not look like young moss growing. Rather that looks like algae on your LFS. Look up pics of moss sprouting and you will see.
SavageGarden,3amwvt,gill_za,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:24:59 2015 UTC,"That's actually a good point.  Just looked up a few pictures of sphagnum moss sprouting...  Oddly, a lot of the pictures i'm seeing do look sorta like what I have going on. I took two more pictures that might give you more to work with.  The first one looks like growing sphagnum, the second one looks like what you're describing:      http://i.imgur.com/G5lAmwh  http://i.imgur.com/azy9Muz  (sorry about the orientation... imgur is being weird, rotating the image with their edit tool isn't working)  Verdict?  Some parts do in fact look a lot like what i would imagine algae would be like, but other parts look sorta ""bud"" like.      I'll check it out tomorrow and see what it looks like, maybe move it to a better light for pictures.    That said, if it IS algae, is that a problem?  Is there anything i can do?  Or is that just a good indicator that i can ignore?"
SavageGarden,3amwvt,gill_za,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:40:33 2015 UTC,Not much you can do at this point except removing the LFS. If you make the planting soil mix yourself  in the future wash and soak LFS and peat very thoroughly in DI water. Wash everything in DI water :).  What you are experiencing is a common problem. It is not going to hurt your plants.
SavageGarden,3amwvt,YourRealMom,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:29:36 2015 UTC,it's probably some of both. Not much you can do about the algae but providing strong sunlight and good ventilation will help prevent it from becoming a problem.
SavageGarden,3amwvt,piceaglauca,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:34:47 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with algae.  It's going to grow where you have water and light in ample amounts.  You can stir your moss up a bit every once in a while if it bugs you, visually."
SavageGarden,3amwvt,YourRealMom,3,Mon Jun 22 23:32:42 2015 UTC,"yeah, it's fine for the moss to grow. live sphagnum will have less problems with mold etc anyway so I think it's preferable. you may have to trim off some of the growth occasionally."
SavageGarden,3amwvt,YourRealMom,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:19:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, cool.  anything i should keep in mind as far as keeping it ""out of the way"" of the flytraps?  Or will that not be an issue?    The flytraps have never been as tall as they are now (this new sun really is doing something magical), so it's likely that they'll be fine, but i have no idea what to expect from the moss."
SavageGarden,3amwvt,birdiesss,3,Sun Jun 21 20:22:45 2015 UTC,"I doubt it'll be an issue, just every once in a while you'll think, ""boy that moss is getting tall"" and then you can clip it a bit. repeat forever."

SavageGarden,3agxcc,phdintea,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:01:29 2015 UTC,"Now you'll have multiple plants that won't pitcher if you haven't actually solved your problem though.   However, if it's a humidity issue, once the bagged cutting roots, and if it does pitcher, that likely means your problem was low humidity. So that part of the experiment may give you an answer. That looks like it's Nepenthes 'Miranda'? It looks too green to me, have you tried giving it more light? What about putting it outside if it's summer where you are?"
SavageGarden,3agxcc,UseUrLogic,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:06:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions. Unfortunately moving it outside is not an option for me. One thing I had read before is that older plants sometimes have a harder time adjusting to new environments, so I am hoping that the young cuttings and nubs might pitcher in an environment that the older plant does not, simply because they have a new opportunity to adjust to the environment.   I was told it was a miranda x alata hybrid, but I don't entirely trust the garden center I bought it from. The new leaves do have a reddish tinge which I had hoped would indicate decent lighting and humidity, but it fades back to green over time. If the bagged cutting does pitcher and the others don't, then I'll definitely try to bunch the plants more together and see if it helps. I guess I'm wondering if just the older plant is not going to pitcher no matter what changes I try, simply because its too mature?"
SavageGarden,3agxcc,UseUrLogic,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:32:22 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as a plant too old to pitcher, they don't slow down with maturity. Actually the opposite is true, they grow faster the larger they are when well taken care of, as they have more leaf surface area to photosynthesize and larger pitchers to take in more nutrients. Although more sensitive larger plants may take longer to adjust to new conditions, they can and will, if the conditions are good and care is correct. Your plant is likely not on the ""too sensitive to risk trying"" list, and if the conditions are better, who cares if it takes some time to adjust if you aren't getting pitchers anyway? I guess that doesn't much matter if you can't try a different location though. How long have you had it? It can sometimes take months for more sensitive larger plants to adjust.  It's 90% likely either a lighting or a humidity issue, or maybe both. Have you taken a reading of either? What media are you growing it in and how long has it been growing in it?"
SavageGarden,3agxcc,UseUrLogic,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:49:25 2015 UTC,"I've had it since last fall, so around 9 months now. I think the humidity should be ok, I keep my windows open and it's about 60% humidity outside here, plus I try to keep it near other plants (as much as you can with big plants anyway). It's in a peat/sphagnum mix, and I haven't repotted it because I've also been told that they're sensitive to too much moving/jostling so I wanted to leave it alone to see if it adjusted. I'll continue to mist everyday and try to improve the lighting, but I guess one conundrum is deciding how long to wait to see if the adjustments help, or don't."
SavageGarden,3agxcc,AaaaNinja,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:16:02 2015 UTC,"Not too big a conundrum. After nine months of having it there, give it 2 leaves. As in after you make a change if the second new leaf made after the change doesn't at least attempt to grow a pitcher it probably isn't enough or wasn't the problem.  Misting doesn't raise the humidity but only temporarily so don't waste your time. 60% humidity should be enough if it's consistently 60%. Consistency is Nepenthes favorite thing. Even if the humidity is less than ideal, if it stays a consistent humidity day and a consistent humidity (preferably higher) at night it should be fine at 60% if everything else, temp, lighting, etc. is appropriate. So if you've measured and that's not it, lighting would be the next thing to look at only because it shouldn't be too picky about temps unless they're wildly out of range."
SavageGarden,3agxcc,tommytimbertoes,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the two-leaf rule is a timeline I can work in. I've moved it closer to the window where it will hopefully get more full sun, and will try the fertilizer suggested below. I'll get an official check on the indoor humidity as well, and bunch some more plants together if its below 60."
SavageGarden,3agxcc,AaaaNinja,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:33:12 2015 UTC,"Have you tried increasing the light?  South-east window sounds pretty good.  Direct sun from 7-noon...  I'm reading that Miranda needs A LOT of sunlight, to the point where the leaves gain a bit of 'bronze' on the leaves.  Have you tried moving it closer to the window?  Light from east-facing windows drops off quickly, so you want your plants to be close to the window.  The light from south-facing windows reaches further.  You say you have south-east but try experimenting with bringing the plant closer if you can.  You can do a test to see whether the light shining on your plant is filtered or true direct light.  Put a piece of paper in the same location as where the plant is growing.  If you use your had to cast a shadow on the paper from about a foot away, is the shadow blurry or is it well-defined?  You want it to be well-defined.  This test probably won't work very well on overcast days though, lol.  Do you have a lot of plants?  If you put them all together in the same growing area they can create their own pocket of humidity from the collective transpiration of their leaves.  By multiplying your plant perhaps you will end up being able to use them to create their own mini-climate and pitcher. ;)  My own pitchers all grow together on the window sill and I think they benefit from evaporation from their pots and leaves.  The humidity stays around 50% in that area."
SavageGarden,3agxcc,tommytimbertoes,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:29:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's a great idea on the light test, I tried it and my shadow is pretty defined, with slight blurry edges. So I'll try to move it to the window a little closer but its probably at a good distance. I do have an extra CFL light nearby also that I was using to give it more artificial light, but its such a large plant that I'm not sure the light was strong enough to help entirely, and having more lights would make my living room look lit like a football stadium.  I am coming around to the idea that the main problem is that its such a mature plant already. I want to be patient and see how things go through the summer, but if my cuttings or nubs do better I'll just cut everything back from the mature plant. Plus if I have a couple smaller plants that are doing well then as you said I can bunch them together for increased humidity."
SavageGarden,3aepo4,RawhlTahhyde,2,Fri Jun 19 14:55:36 2015 UTC,I have heard 50 or lower is fine. Personally I would try it with just one plant to see how it does first.
SavageGarden,3aepo4,tommytimbertoes,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"if you do, just be sure to rinse the soil occasionally. ie: water it from the top and allow the water to run down the drain instead of sitting in a saucer of water. This will help prevent trace minerals from building up over time. I would say rinse it once every week or two, let it sit in a tray of water as usual the rest of the time."
SavageGarden,3aepo4,YourRealMom,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:11:30 2015 UTC,They should be fine. I've had plants do just great using water up into the 50-70ppm range
SavageGarden,3aepo4,ashesnexus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:59:41 2015 UTC,"There are some varieties that are more sensitive, like akai ryuu.  Based on that I'd just say that the red cultivars in general are probably more sensitive and should only be watered with pure water.  As long as you repot your flytraps yearly then you shouldn't have problems with mineral buildup.  We have low-mineral water in my area too.  I watered mine from the hose last year and repotted them last month.  Just to be safe, though, I just added some fused-tooth flytraps to my pot so I'm going to try to just use pure water this summer."

SavageGarden,3ab9yr,james26685,3,Thu Jun 18 19:35:42 2015 UTC,Looks like you got two.  I see a second growth point at ~2:00.
SavageGarden,3ab9yr,NaughtyHobby,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:47:40 2015 UTC,Are you referring to the clump of super small traps? Why are they so much smaller? I've got the same thing with my VFT.
SavageGarden,3ab9yr,james26685,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:00:48 2015 UTC,"yes, you can  divide it preferably right before dormancy ends and have two plants.  It will eventually get just as large as the parent plant. No harm in leaving it where it is either, especially if you don't want to tend multiple pots."
SavageGarden,3ac4fs,_martin_,4,Thu Jun 18 22:10:36 2015 UTC,Ppm of what? If it's very low in total dissolved solids (<50 ppm) the tap water might work.
SavageGarden,3ac4fs,AllAccessAndy,3,Fri Jun 19 00:58:58 2015 UTC,I pick up my distilled water from the store.
SavageGarden,3ac4fs,SolarDub,3,Fri Jun 19 01:51:26 2015 UTC,"Any grocery store or target, etc. Should carry distilled water. Usually very cheap (like $1-2/gal).   Vfts need distilled water and a lot of it. Make sure that the soil is always very wet. Like enough to suffocate other plants. Fly traps are indigenous to the swampy, human South Carolinan woods, so lots of water!"
SavageGarden,3ac4fs,poor_decisions,3,Fri Jun 19 02:51:11 2015 UTC,"Water softeners doesn't really remove minerals, but swaps the minerals already in the water with a different mineral that doesn't accumulate in pipes as easily.  Usually sodium.  It doesn't reduce the mineral content, just substitutes one mineral for another.  If your water is already soft, what's the ppm?  If it's low enough you can use it.  Some venus flytraps like the akai ryuu is sensitive and can ONLY be watered with distilled.  Is it really that hard to find distilled water where you live?  Sometimes people think it's hard to get because they've never had a need for it and so they've never seen it before.  Maybe you should phone the grocery stores in your area and ask."
SavageGarden,3ac4fs,AaaaNinja,3,Fri Jun 19 04:48:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone here, catch rain water or buy it. If you know someone that keeps saltwater fish tanks and is really into fish keeping, they may have a small RO unit you could use to fill a gallon carton. High end reef stores also sell RO water which could be at a cheaper rate than the store but really buying from the store isn't that pricey when you compare to the price of the plant you are keeping. I'm lucky working at a lab to have access to one."
SavageGarden,3ac4fs,lablizard,5,Fri Jun 19 14:23:14 2015 UTC,"No, soft water isnt good enough, especially not for venus flytraps (These are a bit more picky with water than most) so Id definitely suggest getting distilled water or catching rainwater."

SavageGarden,3aads6,FugaFeels,4,Thu Jun 18 14:24:00 2015 UTC,It's still eating  Does it have good water & light?
SavageGarden,3aads6,insta,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:33:48 2015 UTC,"Full summer sunlight all day sitting on my back porch. Use the tray method for watering and refill everyday at noon if needed. Plenty of new growth, it's just the one trap that is confusing me..."
SavageGarden,3aads6,tommytimbertoes,4,Thu Jun 18 14:39:20 2015 UTC,Leave it alone. The plant knows what it's doing.
SavageGarden,3aads6,violated_tortoise,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:06:35 2015 UTC,"Some of mine take over a week to open, give it time."
SavageGarden,3aads6,Sashoke,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:40:14 2015 UTC,"Will do. Not really worried so much as I am just curious. Is there a correlation between trap size, food size, and time to reopen?"
SavageGarden,3aads6,Sashoke,2,Thu Jun 18 14:49:48 2015 UTC,"Yes there definitely is. Rule of thumb is, feed your trap with a bug 50% the size of the trap. So it fits comfortably and had plenty of room for digestive fluids. The bigger the prey the longer it takes to digest."
SavageGarden,3a81kw,Andymetoo,3,Wed Jun 17 23:21:48 2015 UTC,Great feeling huh
SavageGarden,3a81kw,whiskeymikie,2,Thu Jun 18 05:45:16 2015 UTC,Hence the name! Nice photo.
SavageGarden,3a81kw,tommytimbertoes,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:36:41 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know if it's safe to feed fly traps red harvester ants? I've only had my fly traps for about two weeks and about three days ago I fed an ant that happened to crawl inside my house to one of the traps and now the underside of the trap, exactly where the ant is, turned a sandy brown color, like a dead leaf. I don't know if it's just a coincidence or if maybe the venom from the ant burned the leaf."
SavageGarden,3a7det,ps3isawesome,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:22:46 2015 UTC,"It went from being the size of a quarter, to being able to eat a quarter!   Oh how the tables have turned."
SavageGarden,3a7det,Sashoke,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:44:37 2015 UTC,ya right? i didn't anticipate to have such fast growth. it was SOOOO small when i first got it
SavageGarden,3a6bfz,james26685,11,Wed Jun 17 15:55:42 2015 UTC,"One time, when I was a kid, I had a VFT in a nice little pot near the window. We were about to go out of town and I was under the impression that it would get ""hungry"", so I found a small caterpillar to place in one of the leaves. It closed, I was happy, and we left for the vacation.   I came back 3 week later. The entire plant was gone and there was a cocoon on the top of the enclosure. Turns out it was some asshole moth."
SavageGarden,3a6bfz,SmtDnny5,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"Lol and I was just reading yesterday that moths are the least nutritious bugs for these to dine on.  Funny how all the bugs (except flies) that you wish they would eat are bad for them.. With ants you have to worry about aphids, with slugs they turn the meal around and dine on your plants. I still feed caterpillars to my indoor sundews especially cabbage worms, they just lose their heads first making it hard to eat my plants and minimizing escapes. I think this was a bee or hornet."
SavageGarden,3a6bfz,ps3isawesome,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:24:32 2015 UTC,one of the best story ever
SavageGarden,3a8clg,natchgreyes,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:56:56 2015 UTC,How much was your robcantleyi?  I have been wanting one bad.
SavageGarden,3a8clg,piceaglauca,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:27:23 2015 UTC,"I think I paid around $30 for it. That species is very variable in price. (If you want a deal, there's a pretty large one available for $85 + shipping on Facebook right now)."
SavageGarden,3a629o,s3sebastian,7,Wed Jun 17 14:47:27 2015 UTC,"I have. First, it might not be a spider but a havestman and as you can see the body is the biggest part and close to the ground.  It just walked right in and the trap closed."
SavageGarden,3a629o,HawkEy3,2,Wed Jun 17 17:37:43 2015 UTC,I count 8 legs there so I'm inclined to say it's actually a ...  Cellar Spider  But they both walk in the same way
SavageGarden,3a629o,KserDnB,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:04:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the other possibility."
SavageGarden,3a629o,HawkEy3,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:57:10 2015 UTC,A harvestman also has 8 legs. theyre both arachnids. The difference is that a harvestman has one body segment instead of two and often have a single pair of eyes instead of 8 eyes and no venom or silk.
SavageGarden,3a629o,joker420,2,Thu Jun 18 07:11:09 2015 UTC,Wow i can't believe I never noticed they have 8 legs...
SavageGarden,3a629o,KserDnB,2,Thu Jun 18 12:21:36 2015 UTC,Why are they called Harvestman?  The only thing they harvest is my nightmares o_O
SavageGarden,3a629o,Sashoke,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:15:45 2015 UTC,Theyre most common to find in the late summer-early autumn during harvest season.   but yeah theyre creepy as hell
SavageGarden,3a629o,joker420,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:13:58 2015 UTC,Definitely looks like a harvestman.

SavageGarden,3a73a3,lecramstar,2,Wed Jun 17 19:11:16 2015 UTC,How are those even standing up?
SavageGarden,3a73a3,grottohopper,3,Wed Jun 17 23:46:54 2015 UTC,"You're gonna need a bigger pot for that thing pretty soon. It'll do best with at least a square foot of root space. Also, outdoors is best for most sarracenia, if they don't get enough sunlight the pitchers will get floppy. Wind also stimulates more rigid growth."
SavageGarden,3a73a3,YourRealMom,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:56:47 2015 UTC,"ooo thanks mom, didn't know wind stimulates more rigid growth"
SavageGarden,3a73a3,ps3isawesome,3,Thu Jun 18 00:38:20 2015 UTC,"yeah the stress induces more fibrous growth, but then I guess it's not so much more rigid that it completely outweighs the fact that, you know... wind blows stuff over. eventually they all succumb."
SavageGarden,3a73a3,YourRealMom,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:41:57 2015 UTC,yeah the stress induces more fibrous growth   I should place my indoor sarracenia on a shaking plate

SavageGarden,3a7rhc,AaaaNinja,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:03:32 2015 UTC,It's at the edge of the perimeter of the plant's foliage.  I can't tell if there happened to be a seed that got in it or if the plant propogated.  A mystery pitcher??
SavageGarden,3a7rhc,Sashoke,2,Wed Jun 17 22:05:31 2015 UTC,The picture is kind of a mess but it definitely looks like a Nepenthes seedling. Keep an eye on it! :)
SavageGarden,3a7rhc,leeser3551,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:45:46 2015 UTC,I'm going to see if I can keep it growing!  If it happens to be a highland seedling then it will still appreciate the nightly temperature drops.
SavageGarden,3a6jje,timekiller357,3,Wed Jun 17 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"It is a flower stem. It takes quite a lot of effort for the plant to produce these. It is often advised to cut them off if the plant is weak or small, but it is a little late for that now. So congratulations, you're a dad now!"
SavageGarden,3a6jje,Stormshaper,0,Wed Jun 17 17:06:55 2015 UTC,So what happens now?
SavageGarden,3a6jje,reddittays,3,Wed Jun 17 18:00:24 2015 UTC,"your plant dies in two weeks.  No, just kidding. I would cut the flower stalk off to prevent it from using up anymore energy. The plant should kick into full trap production mode and spend the rest of the growing season producing traps. Don't forget that these plants go into dormancy in the winter.  Just a side note, if you are a beginner or you really don't care about growing more plants from seed, cut these off when they form next season. I for one allow most of mine to flower and produce seeds to increase the numbers of my VFT army. I germinated this years harvest and currently have probably close to 100 VFT seedlings growing. Oh, and the parent plants that flowered are all doing fine. (VFT flowers should not kill your plants. Yes, they slow down growth; but if your plant is healthy, you shouldn't have any issues)"
SavageGarden,3a6jje,YourRealMom,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:13:24 2015 UTC,Thank you c:
SavageGarden,3a6jje,YourRealMom,3,Wed Jun 17 18:29:59 2015 UTC,"just fyi, that plant could really use a lot more light, that's why the traps are a bit thin and poorly formed."
SavageGarden,3a6jje,yorrellew,0,Wed Jun 17 20:29:39 2015 UTC,I keep it on my window sill at all time but unfortunately I only get sunlight in my window for a few hours every day.
SavageGarden,3a6jje,tommytimbertoes,3,Wed Jun 17 20:48:24 2015 UTC,"a CFL in a desk lamp about 8 inches above the plant, left on for 12 hours a day or so, would be a good supplement. color temperature of 65000 works well for me."
SavageGarden,3a3kz5,AaaaNinja,2,Tue Jun 16 23:23:09 2015 UTC,Nice! In a few years theyll be big enough to eat a fly!

SavageGarden,3a2l4p,ashesnexus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:03:11 2015 UTC,I think these are the coolest because you can actually see the plant consuming the insects when it begins to surround it with those sticky glands
SavageGarden,3a2oar,Duckstiff,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:25:23 2015 UTC,"I picked this Nepenthes up a few months ago from a garden centre, the woman who worked there was definitely clued up on the carnivorous plants.  Anyway  I've had it for a few months, it mostly sits in the corner of a room which is fairly brightly lit but doesn't receive direct sun light. (It's on the window sill for these pictures as the room its in is fairly messy.)  I'm considering putting it in my greenhouse outdoors to see if it encourages pitcher growth but at the same time I've read that changing the conditions it lives in can cause it to struggle.  At the moment all the tips of the leaves just curl up and grab onto other leaves/stems but no signs of pitchers.  Edit:  Does anyone know if pitchers do form, will it only be on new leaves?"
SavageGarden,3a2oar,AaaaNinja,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:28:44 2015 UTC,"It's okay to change the conditions if you're on a quest to find the right conditions.  No pitchers could mean not enough humidity (though most easy-growing species can adapt, but may or may still not make pitchers), or enough sun.  Mine stop making pitchers in the winter when there's less sun.  Sorry I can only give vague clues.  I don't know the species of pitcher plant or your conditions (humidity, temperature, which direction window it is).  I know the room looks a little dark but that's due to your camera's exposure settings when photographing near a window.  If it's a north-facing window it is definitely not enough light.  My own pitchers get direct sunlight in the morning in an east-facing window.  Some of the ones that are hard to get to pitcher are making pitchers now, so for them it was the light.  It does get a bit warm, but the plants do not care, looking at their leaves can be a good way to gauge whether the sun is too much.  A bit of red on the leaves is okay, it means it's getting lots of sun.  Big red patches would mean too much light (you might have to google what sunburnt leaves look like I guess.  I'm not sure what they look like either).  It gets tricky if it's a species that has red leaves (lol).  Oh yeah, the humidity where I keep mine is between 40-50%.  They can adapt to that and pitcher just fine, depending on the species."
SavageGarden,3a2oar,Nigelthornfruit,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:52:21 2015 UTC,"What season is it where you are now?   How moist is the soil?  Are you using rain or distilled water?  From my experience, pitcher growth kicks in seasonally. I have a plant just like yours in a similar place, but it has a ton of pitchers. Some plants have a varied amount of pitchers, or just grow them in a splurge after a while.   Edit: I forgot, humidity is very important. If the air isn't humid enough, the pitchers will not deploy as in nature this would be in a dry season and the pitchers would brown prematurely."
SavageGarden,3a2oar,Nigelthornfruit,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:43:45 2015 UTC,"Soil is moist but no where near as wet as my VFT/Pitchers, been using rain water to water them all.  It's summer in the UK at the moment, humidity I can't really comment on other than going off the weather reports which is roughly 65-70%.  I could put it in my greenhouse outdoors and the humidity is insane in there if it will help it."
SavageGarden,3a2oar,AaaaNinja,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:54:47 2015 UTC,"Yes do this, or keep it in a water tray that evaporates to raise humidity locally. Inside the house the humidity can be reduced significantly through various effects, so a hygrometer can only reveal. I keep mine in the bathroom and it does great. Yes, you can try greenhouse to see how it develops, maybe it will kick it into pitcher mode."
SavageGarden,3a2oar,AaaaNinja,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:04:04 2015 UTC,"Be careful about putting it in the greenhouse and then when the plant pitchers, giving credit to the humidity conditions, because you are also changing the lighting conditions.  Lighting is the other important factor that can affect pitchering.  If the plant you have is a lowland or intermediate species, they can adapt quite well to low-humidity indoor conditions."
SavageGarden,3a2oar,Subintro,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:38:36 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of putting it in a shaded part of the greenhouse, just concerned sometimes it can get pretty damn hot in there whilst not being all that bright.  Got some sundews that will be going in there in the next few days, plenty for them to eat."
SavageGarden,3a2oar,Scuipici,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:18:16 2015 UTC,"Here, let me show you what I mean by lighting.  Here are my plants getting blasted with full morning sunlight.  And yet they are not pitchering.  This is because the photo was taken in winter/fall.  Here they are in the same location pitchers everywhere.  The only factor that changed is the amount of light.  They're in the same location as before.  It's summer now, and the light they receive is more intense and there are more hours of it.  The humidity is about the same.  Around noon it's about 40%, I'm sure the direct light burns some of it off so the 40% would be around the low-end.  If you scroll around the rest of the album you will see that a variety of the plants are making pitchers.  While it's getting direct light, the temperature stays under the upper limit of about 32 C.  As you can see in the photo, several plants have a little bit of pink on the leaves and it's not increasing.  That means the amount of light it's getting is just right.  This is what real sunburn looks like"
SavageGarden,3a2oar,Luigidagawd,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:44:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I understand that as I get a narrow window when I can grow my chilies. This year has been a bit meh due to a lot of poor weather during the best of days.  This is my first Nepenthes so I've probably been a bit optimistic on whether I could grow this in the position I've had it in. It's throw leaves out non-stop just no pitchers. Most fruits/veg I grow will produce anyway even in poor conditions but just not as vigorous."
SavageGarden,3a0xvu,Nigelthornfruit,3,Tue Jun 16 10:55:10 2015 UTC,"Mine are doing the same thing in Melbourne, Australia.."
SavageGarden,3a0xvu,MattJak,2,Tue Jun 16 13:21:34 2015 UTC,Well in Australia you are approaching winter. So browning pitchers are normal.
SavageGarden,3a0xvu,tommytimbertoes,3,Tue Jun 16 14:39:48 2015 UTC,Are they sitting in water? How many hours of Sun a day?
SavageGarden,3a0xvu,tommytimbertoes,2,Tue Jun 16 14:40:18 2015 UTC,"They usually sit in at least 1cm of water as evidenced by the flourishing Sphagnum moss. They get around 6 hours of direct sunlight this time of the year, but of course this is seasonal such as Canada or Northern US (but only goes down to -5 degrees Celsius in the winter)."

SavageGarden,3a0xvu,AaaaNinja,2,Tue Jun 16 16:29:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not sure whats going on this year, I have several alicae drosera, some cape sundews, some sarracenias, and some big ol' neps and they ALL went brown this summer. No idea why. I didn't change anything from the previous years. VFTs, too. :|  They're all still alive and recovering, but barely. Only things that didn't seem to die out was my butterwarts."
SavageGarden,3a0xvu,Zeliek,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:06:20 2015 UTC,"Your alicae drosera might be okay.  Just keep watering it, as usual, because if the roots are still healthy keep taking care of it.  It'll send up more plants in a month or two.  It's kind of like a weed like that.  Cut off the dead plant to soil-level.  My own alicae dies off on its own occasionally and that's what I do.  I literally still have the same carnivorous plant that is the first carnivorous plant I ever had.  It's impossible to kill.  For venus flytraps, I don't know if there's a heat wave in your area but I learned that letting the roots get too hot can be stressful for flytraps.  Mine get afternoon sun but when I learned that, I moved mine to a part of the yard that got about the same amount of sunlight except from the earlier part of the day.  The Flytrap Store care sheet also mentions setting the venus flytrap pot into another pot and filling the space inbetween with perlite.  That would create an insulating layer against the pot getting hot from the sun hitting it."
SavageGarden,3a0xvu,AaaaNinja,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:23:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd heard about that with VFTs too. I actually have an interesting set up, my VFTs are in a water-sealed pot, which is sitting in the waterfall of my pond. No water exchanged, but the pond is really cold, so the pot is kept chilled from the running water. The roots of the VFTs are kept at around 65 to 70F, and the surface is nice and sunny in the 80F weather. (:   The VFTs have recovered significantly, but at the beginning of the season they took a rough turn. My other plants haven't really recovered, but the VFTs are coming along."
SavageGarden,3a0xvu,Zeliek,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"Awesome, it sounds like soil temperature isn't even an issue.  My pots got kind of baked last week so I wonder how the soil did.  One thing, though, since you said yours is water-sealed.  Last time I repotted my flytraps the old dirt smelled like a pond.  You know what kind of smell I mean?  Maybe it's an anaerobic smell.  I started adjusting how much water I have mine sitting in.  I have been thinking about my plant's roots a lot lately."
SavageGarden,3a0xvu,AaaaNinja,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"Aw, yeah. Mine were repotted within the last year."
SavageGarden,3a0xvu,AaaaNinja,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:30:29 2015 UTC,"It simply looks like the pitchers are all used up.  I can see some new leaves coming up.  All you need to do is cut them off.  That's the only reason your plants don't look like the kind you see in nursery photographs.  They cut off the brown ones.  It will also encourage the plant to grow more of the new ones.  Browning pitchers doesn't just happen at wintertime.  In your case, you simply went for a very, very long time without any pruning."

SavageGarden,39z6l2,Jack_Lambert,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:23:01 2015 UTC,"It was just shy of $40. That's about going rate in the US. EU you can get it for cheaper - 25 Euro or so. Importing, though, that'll probably bump it up close to $40 anyhow."

SavageGarden,39x81o,o0DrWurm0o,2,Mon Jun 15 23:46:25 2015 UTC,I'd guess it's the 'Big Vigorous' cultivar they advertise on their website. B52s usually develop very dark red mouths.

SavageGarden,39vxhs,jhamblin83,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:04:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much this varies in other countries. But in Australia, I find them in the nursery section of hardware stores and some nurseries. I've found Nepenthes (hanging pitcher plants), Sarracenia (pitcher plants), sundews, and venus fly traps. They tent to hide with the succulents and/or bonsais.  The caring basics: don't put them in the ground*, don't plant them in normal potting mix. They like sandy or boggy soils with little to no available nutrients. Feed them live insects if you want to feed them, not dead ones. You don't have to feed them. Lots of sunlight, keep their water trays topped up unless they need to become dormant... That's the absolute basics.  Sidebar seems to be pretty well decked out with instructions. Big fan of Carnivorous FAQ website, it gave me all my growing tips when I started. Lots of pretty pictures to look at too.  *Edit: just enforcing that they don't like normal soils. I have seen some truly spectacular bog gardens which are obviously in the ground."
SavageGarden,39vxhs,One_of_a_Kind,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:44:52 2015 UTC,Start with a book instead of a plant.  Savage Garden by Peter D'amato  or the carnivorous plant FAQ by Barry Rice at  http://www.sarracenia.com/faq.html you will find resources for buying under the resources tab as well as here in the sidebar.
SavageGarden,39vxhs,james26685,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:52:26 2015 UTC,"there are carnivorous plants from all over the world in diverse climates and ecosystems. The biggest thing they have in common is a sensitivity to dissolved nutrients. These plants are adapted to very nutrient poor soils and are easily burned by fertilizers or salts. For this reason, almost all growers use rainwater, distilled water, or reverse osmosis water. Some few lucky folks with very pure municiple water can get away with using it straight from the tap. Generally a TDS reading of less than 50 ppm is OK for most carnivores.  Most beginners start out with North American (North American pitcher plant, venus flytraps, some sundews), South African (cape sundew), or Southeast Asian plants (tropical pitcher plants).  North american plants grow well outdoors year round in temperate climates with a little winter protection. Since they need to go dormant in winter people in tropical climates often store them in a fridge between late november and february. Cape sundews and tropical pitcher plants need to be indoors in the winter unless you live somewhere where it never freezes.  Not all carnivorous plants are bog plants, which like to be in a pot sitting in a shallow tray of water. Tropical pitcher plants like their soil well drained but always moist. Soil mixtures fall into two broad categories. For plants that like to sit in water, most people use a mixture composed of peat moss, perlite, and sand, a bit more than half moss, the rest perlite/sand. This promotes aeration while still holding plenty of water. For plants that DON'T like to sit in water, most people prefer long fiber or live sphagnum moss with perlite or orchid bark mixed in.  there are lots of reputable vendors in the sidebar, although most are US based. I would personally recommend california carnivores or sarracenia northwest."

SavageGarden,39tvmn,whiskeymikie,4,Sun Jun 14 20:39:53 2015 UTC,Nope. Don't try it.  Check your local garden centers or indoor garden (growlights and whatnot) shop for buying perlite. You can get like 9 cu/ft for around $12. It'll last a long time.

I thoroughly rinsed the whole bag before I mixed it in though. Took a 5 gallon bucket, put some small holes in the bottom, and rinsed and stirred and rinsed and stirred and repeat for a pretty good amount of time with tap water, then did a final rinse with some DI water. I only did it because the closest place I could get good perlite was 1.5 hours away and I didn't want 3 cubic feet of it. My nepenthes is currently thriving in it."

Once you get your plant take some leaf cuttings if you are trying to get more plants quickly, you will still get to see them grow from something tiny,  or if you are dead set on growing from seed, just feed your plant well and it will flower.

I also grow a bunch of pygmy sundews, and burmanii, indoors.  don't worry, they won't attract a lot of bugs to your room, but will catch a few of the bugs that happen to wander in. If you've got a pretty bug-free room and you want to feed them, one leaf every two weeks is an ok schedule for most. insects housefly sized or smaller are ok food, or you can buy freeze dried bloodworms and rehydrate them with a drop of water. don't feed them meat as it spoils and fouls the leaf.  make sure to read up on their care requirements, only distilled or reverse osmosis water (or rainwater) and only mineral and fertilizer free soil. most people use a mix of sphagnum or peat moss and sand or perlite. the combination produces a very moisture retentive soil which at the same time has plenty of aerated pores."

SavageGarden,39o13i,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:19:18 2015 UTC,"hydroton is the expanded clay pellets right? I personally wouldn't go with the expanded clay because clay has a high ion exchange capacity, and can have adsorbed minerals that are gradually released into the water. carnivorous plants are very sensitive to dissolved minerals. clay media also tends to have a slightly basic PH effect, whereas carnivores prefer acidic media.  now, something like rock wool might work, or washed coconut coir, both of which are sometimes used in hydroponics.  the truth is that the normal carnivorous plant soil mix I mentioned is very much like a hydroponic setup already, in the sense that it's an inert medium which just holds water. it also is a little bit acidic, which most carnivorous plants like."
SavageGarden,39o13i,YourRealMom,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:28:44 2015 UTC,Turface is like crushed hydroton. It works okay as a media for Mexican pings.
SavageGarden,39o13i,james26685,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:11:33 2015 UTC,yeah I have some pings on a turface based mix. mexican pings are an outlier among carnivores for their calcium tolerance though.
SavageGarden,39o13i,YourRealMom,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:18:21 2015 UTC,"How do you like it as opposed to traditional medias (pearlite, peat moss .etc)? I have a few plantlets I separated from a P. Aphrodite and planted into turface  and am struggling with my water schedule.  I am not sure if I should be watering more as the surface of my turface :-) seems to get drier faster. Also I notice when top watering my water seems to go straight down and does not saturate the media so I have been using a mister to try getting more spread.  I hear some people grow them in straight pearlite but I would think it would try to float away on you when watering as well as not giving your plants very secure footing."
SavageGarden,39o13i,james26685,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:49:23 2015 UTC,"I mixed in some fine sand and crushed pumice, they sit in a half inch of water and do ok, but I think that's largely because of the small pore diameter of the fine sand encouraging capillary action.  once some moss gets growing on it it'll help a bit keeping the surface humid, in the meantime I would probably treat it like a bonsai, water daily and allow to drain."

SavageGarden,39mjk5,Decapod73,5,Fri Jun 12 20:08:45 2015 UTC,"So, for anyone else interested in buying seeds, here are some rules:   eBay is scam-bay. Anything from China will not be carnivorous plant seeds. If, by some miracle, you are sent carnivorous plant seeds, they will not be viable. Generally speaking, as far as eBay goes, unless it's someone who has sold a mix of plants and seeds or is from the area where the plants grow, you are probably not going to get what you pay for/want. Anyone selling ""5"" or ""10"" seeds of something, other than Drosophyllum or Roridula, is scamming you. Seeds generally come in well-defined measures. Nepenthes seeds are sold by ""pod."" Sarracenia seeds usually come in lots of 25, 50, or 100. No one, and I mean no one, is actually going to count Drosera seeds, so you should expect around 100+ seeds, unless it's a very rare species. VFT seeds usually come in lots of 20, 25, 30, or 50. Anyone selling seeds who does not list or is not willing to tell you the collection date is scamming you and/or selling seeds that are probably not viable. (Many plants have seed which is short-lived if not stored properly and it is only available at certain times, i.e. spring/summer/fall). Lastly, the best places to get seeds is either from a carnivorous plant organization that has a seed-bank (e.g. the ICPS), from another grower on a forum or some social media site, or from a nursery that also sells plants. (Seed often gets resold and held at ""seed-only"" nurseries and will not be viable by the time it reaches you, even if it is the right plant).    Regarding organizations with seed banks. Many organizations with seed banks are non-profits that encourage seed donations. They often go by the name ""____ Carnivorous Plant Society."" Often, they will give you credit at the seed bank for donating seed. You will often have to pay $20 - $35 to join the organization and get access to the seed bank. Depending on the organization, seed costs anywhere from $1 to $5 per packet plus shipping and/or handling (a.k.a. the cost of the envelope).   Because $20 - $35 + the cost of seeds/shipping is a pretty big expense for most people in this hobby, let me share my experience. As far as my experience has been, people are more willing to donate seed, buy seed, and participate in seed banks when prices for seed are lower. As a consequence, over the past few years in watching seed banks, I see higher turnover where the seed cost is lower. E.g. seed banks with a lot of $5 seed do not see a whole lot of new species compared to those with $2 seed. Personally, I think that makes a lot of sense. I, probably like most people, will buy a few packets of seed before donating any seed. If the bank has some cool stuff that I want and I can end up getting 5 packets instead of 2 for my $10, I feel a lot better about that organization and am much more willing to help it. My guess is that a lot of others feel the same way. But that's just my 2 cents."

SavageGarden,39h1xk,internetadventures,2,Thu Jun 11 17:45:04 2015 UTC,"http://www.sarracenia.com/faq/faq1740.html I believe the general consensus is that these plants are not efficient at insect control. So if that is the only reason you have for growing them you may want to look at other control options available to you. Also growing from seed will be a long endeavor so maybe in 3-4 years you will have a nep with a pitcher large enough for a roach to fit into. Also spend some time reading the rest of that FAQ and elsewhere before you start putting your plants into your compost or soil. Most of these plants want nitrogen poor soil, not rich. The insects they catch provide the nitrogen, not the soil."
SavageGarden,39h1xk,james26685,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:41:29 2015 UTC,"As /u/james26685 has said carnivorous plants are bad for pest control. They attract more bugs than they kill due to their sweet nectar and such. Ive actually attracted tons of ants into my 2nd story window due to all the Nepenthes I have growing there.  Nepenthes (and basically every other carnivorous plants) grow extremely extremely slowly. 2-4 years from seed before they could eat a roach (as said below as well) so growing from seed really wont be worth it.  On soil, youre going to want to plant them in nothing but sphagnum moss, anything else is likely to kill the plant. Whatever you have at your marsh is not good because it is nitrogen heavy, that will kill the plant.  If you still insist on getting one  (not for pest control but for interest in them) Id suggest N. ventricosa or N. ventrata, theyre both extremely hardy."
SavageGarden,39h1xk,Sashoke,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:57:27 2015 UTC,so growing from seed really wont be worth it.   But it is enormously rewarding though!  I've only had experience with growing sarracenias and drosera's and flytraps from seeds btw.
SavageGarden,39h1xk,Unidoon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:05:34 2015 UTC,"Yes rewarding, but I was going off of what the OP was desiring in the plant, growing from seed would not fit his description.  Ive grown a ton of Drosera and some Sarrs from seed and I agree, its pretty rewarding."
SavageGarden,39ghln,iProcreate,2,Thu Jun 11 15:45:34 2015 UTC,"If the flowers don't get pollinated, no seeds. Usually they self-pollinate, but it sometimes fails to happen.

Unfortunately, this would mean that my multiple plants are all clones of each other, even though I raised them from seeds...damn it!  I have the regular variety (T or Y shaped leaves), but every now and then they send up leaves with an extra fork or two, which is always a pleasant surprise.

I believe I have read that drosera's have evolved to pray on flying insects whereas dionaea's have evolved to pray on flightless insects. Once an insect as much as touches a drosera, he is a goner, whereas with a dionaea he needs to trigger multiple trigger-hairs within a certain amount of time and be in a bad position to actually get stuck. You could also consider a nepenthes but I would still go for the drosera because it has a bigger surface.  A cool clip of a drosera in action."

SavageGarden,3980f3,natchgreyes,2,Wed Jun 10 00:26:54 2015 UTC,"I think the only place left state-side that might have it is South Bay Traps. It's pretty expensive, though."
SavageGarden,398fzn,fappingisgreat,4,Wed Jun 10 00:29:53 2015 UTC,"If you look at their shipping info, you can see that they only ship plants on certain days. This is a common practice in the industry. I think it's to avoid plants sitting in warehouses over the weekend. If you placed an order last wed, my guess is it was shipped out yesterday. I've ordered 5 times from them and not once was the shipment delayed. Although delayed shipment isn't their fault anyway unless they didn't ship on the on time. One thing though, they are always super good at fast replies sooo i dont' know what happened there.  Here's the link http://www.growcarnivorousplants.com/help_answer.asp?ID=12 Also just curious, what did you order :)"
SavageGarden,398fzn,ps3isawesome,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:51:59 2015 UTC,"Additionally, most carnivorous plant nurseries only ship Monday, Tuesday, and/or Wednesday. This is often to prevent the plant from being stuck somewhere on Sundays. (Lots of times, packages will get stuck on a very hot or very cold truck over that day while they wait to get unloaded). Additionally, lots of nurseries are side-businesses. The owners have ""real jobs"" and don't want to spend every day working on packing orders. So, it is not uncommon to have to wait a week or two to get plants.  If you're ordering from overseas or part of a group order, you should expect an even bigger delay."
SavageGarden,395fhc,Mystikal91,2,Tue Jun 9 11:31:00 2015 UTC,"Hi there!   Your Sarracenia is a hybrid of some kind. However without a tag, there's no way to tell for sure. It looks  to have Purpurea or Catesbaei in it to me.   Those seeds are definitely not Dionaea. :( I've been seeing a lot of people get fake seeds which is just awful. Hate that there's so many dishonest sellers out there."
SavageGarden,395fhc,mobscura,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:06:53 2015 UTC,"That sucks... Well I think I'll let them grow, now I'm curious to see what they are.  I just can't find a grown Dionaea in my city but I'll search more. I don't want to play ""gamble seed"" another time"
SavageGarden,395fhc,GliscorN,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:37:32 2015 UTC,"Not a clue about the Sarracenia but there's definitely some purpurea in there. And those fake VFTs look identical to dragonfruit/Hylocereus seedlings (same germination rate and time too), so as a Nepenthes purist I'd say they're arguably more interesting!"
SavageGarden,395fhc,GliscorN,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:41:08 2015 UTC,"So, let's suppose they're what you think... Should I do something different (from seed of VFT) to grow them? I don't wanna throw them, even if they are the most boring plant in the world."

Nothing anything particularlly interesting in the subject, but the composition is really good (Almost 1/3 rule with the diagnol angle) and the entirety of the lid and peristome of the pitcher is in really sharp focus. The subtle lighting gives it a nice silhouette (might not be the right word) against the two toned background.  Really great shot!"
SavageGarden,393ji4,Nacho321,2,Tue Jun 9 00:22:33 2015 UTC,"There’s a post directly below yours (sorted by new) that says Nepenthes grow best in only partial sun. Since they’re a vining plant from SE Asia, they’re evolved to grow under large trees with leaves that block out direct sun. You can artificially provide suncover and create a more humid environment by covering your nepenthes with a green plastic container for a few months (a large soda bottle, for example).   I have zero experience growing carvinerous plants, but since no one had yet replied I thought this would, at the very least, be slightly helpful. Something similar occured to me when I was growing jasmine in Morocco - jasmine love full sun, just not Moroccan full sun! The leaves kept drying up and dying, and I ended up losing three leters of growth. Sad, sad day."

SavageGarden,393ji4,Sashoke,2,Thu Jun 11 20:51:04 2015 UTC,"Looks to me like too much light. That VFT looks very happy with the amount of light its getting, which tells me youre giving that ventrata BOAT LOADS more than it wants. Try putting shade cloth over it, or anything that will dim the light. Extra humidity would work well too, that is likely why the pitchers are not growing.  The leaves shriveling up is completely normal. How long have you had the plant? Nepenthes often will not pitcher or make many leaves for a long time until theyre used to their new enviroment."
SavageGarden,3916cs,Konstamokh,4,Mon Jun 8 14:27:12 2015 UTC,"Sarracenia like as much light as you can provide, nepenthes like partial shade/ afternoon sunlight, but not full sun. Pings I don't have any experience with I'm afraid. Also neps like to be kept moist but not sitting in water."
SavageGarden,3916cs,violated_tortoise,2,Mon Jun 8 16:10:37 2015 UTC,"Pings can grow in full, direct sunlight but most advice I've seen suggests partial sunlight. Mine get 3-4 hours of direct sun and shade for the rest. They're often recommended as a great windowsill plant!  If you do give them full sun, be careful not to get their leaves wet when watering. Water and direct sunlight can scorch their delicate leaves."
SavageGarden,3916cs,mobscura,2,Mon Jun 8 20:45:46 2015 UTC,That explains why mine turned brown. The sun after a rain hurt the leaves and therefore I'll put it back inside. Thanks for the advice.
SavageGarden,3916cs,violated_tortoise,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:49:33 2015 UTC,"The watering thing is good advice for most plants, water droplets on the leaves act like magnifying glasses and concentrate sunlight onto the leaves, leading to sunburnt spots."
SavageGarden,3916cs,yamirai89,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:36:33 2015 UTC,I put my sarracenia for two days in full sunlight and the top of the leaves got dry and brown so I am not sure that it likes whole day full sunlight. Where I live the temperature is 35 C during the day.

SavageGarden,38yel1,mwojo,2,Mon Jun 8 15:06:31 2015 UTC,"It could be a culmination of all the bright light you're giving it (sun + LED). It also has to do with plant genetics. Some stay green, others get just a pinkish tinge, and others are super red all the time.  It's also a seasonal thing. My traps get much redder later in the season, right before dormancy."

SavageGarden,38p2jc,crazylegs99,4,Sat Jun 6 00:55:37 2015 UTC,"If you think it could be tap water, then dump it. Otherwise it's ok. Most Sarracenia have a lid to keep rain out, but purpurea just have that big ruffle and naturally fill up with rain water, so it's fine."
SavageGarden,38p2jc,YourRealMom,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:42:05 2015 UTC,"Most sarrecenia produce their own fluids, but purpera catches rain water and uses that to dissolve prey instead. It will fill up when it rains."
SavageGarden,38p2jc,misogoop6,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:33:06 2015 UTC,"it's natural for purpurea species to fill with rainwater, once full microrgamisms and small invertebrates like mosquito larvae help break down the prey. did you know there's a species of mosquito that lives ONLY in purpurea pitchers? the adults don't drink blood, instead the larvae eat bugs that fall into the pitchers."
SavageGarden,38p2jc,giact,0,Sat Jun 6 15:22:33 2015 UTC,It'll produce it itself. Or rain will fill it up.
SavageGarden,38p2jc,YourRealMom,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:14:12 2015 UTC,Thank you for the info guys. It seems it's purpurea but I've checked the new leaf growing and it doesn't seem completely dry. It has few drops of thick liquid like glue along the internal side of the leaf. So I suppose it produces at least something like liquid. Should I dilute it with purified water the leaf is not yet fully formed and opened. The winters here are harsh - 15 C or 5 F. I suppose winter dormancy is needed.

SavageGarden,38pno4,dennynnnnnn,3,Fri Jun 5 19:54:00 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/dennynnnnnn dont pay attention to whatever asshole is downvoting you, some people here can be very unwelcoming/elitist about things. In general those ""grow your own"" kits are a scam at the best, stale seeds that wont germinate at the worst, but youve still got a chance to make something of it. Keep in mind it can take up to 6-7 years for a Sarracenia plant to fully mature, so I highly suggest you simply buy a Sarracenia for 10-20$ at any online nursery that sells them. Some good shops are californiacarnivores, and predatoryplants.   However if you insist on sticking with these seeds:  The 4 week date will have meant nothing if the seeds were dry. If you had them moist, then good.  Youll want to sow the seeds onto a peat/perlite mix and keep it HUMID. That is what that dome is going to be used for, you can choose to use it or not, I just use a sandwhich bag over the pot.  Once the seedlings are big enough, slowly take the dome off, maybe poke more holes in it every week until you can poke no more and then take it off. The reason for this is to acclimate the plants to the lower humidity.  If you have any more questions feel free to ask!  Edit: youll want to give them as much light as possible, so putting it outside would be best if you dont have any grow lights."
SavageGarden,38pno4,Sashoke,4,Sat Jun 6 08:08:06 2015 UTC,Hopefully this helps: http://www.carnivorousplants.org/howto/Propagation/SarraceniaSeed.php
SavageGarden,38pno4,james26685,2,Fri Jun 5 20:58:22 2015 UTC,Thanks! That helped a lot except for one thing. I dont know if I should use the clear dome it comes with.
SavageGarden,38pno4,UseUrLogic,2,Fri Jun 5 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"Either way you plan to try and germinate them you can use it, it has those little holes for aeration right? It'll help keep humidity up and keep the soil from drying out as fast. Dry soil = death for such small seedlings, so whatever helps. You don't have to use it though, it just can be helpful is all."
SavageGarden,38pno4,hiball2005,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:10:12 2015 UTC,"Use the clear dome, the high humidity is needed. DO NOT WATER IT ONCE PLANTED. the water will disperse the seed and the very few if any seeds that might grow will have no chance. The plants will need at least 5 hours of direct sunlight in a window preferably south south east facing. Avoid letting it sit in the yard on hot days as the sun will fry and over heat the container. Also avoid afternoon sun its far to hot. The dome will recycle the humidity and allow the few weeks to few months for the seeds to germinate. I used one of these and only had one of the sundews one VFT and two sarracenia actually grow. After the first two years they where about the size of a quarter. He will loose interest before then. Look into www.growcarnivorousplants.com and get a few young plants and your son will be in his glory and most likely be introduced into something not only fascinating but a life long hobby he will be able to wow his friends with for many years to come."
SavageGarden,38pno4,hiball2005,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:18:52 2015 UTC,"DO NOT USE TAP WATER, the chemicals and nutrients will kill them. I hope you didnt use tap for the stratification process.

SavageGarden,38pno4,james26685,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:20:50 2015 UTC,"I'm going to recommend that you get him some live plants. Sarracenia are wonderful plants, but it'll be 2 or 3 years before they really reach a respectable size grown from seed.   Venus flytraps are easy to grow, lots of fun, and pretty cheap. Sarracenia Northwest is my typical recommendation to noobies, as they've got extremely healthy plants that come pre-potted.   If you want to do some seeds too, get some tropical drosera seeds from ebay. They germinate and grow much faster than other carnivores, and are vibrant, beautiful plants.   For the sarracenia seeds, you can grow them for a while indoors, where they'll be better protected from extreme weather conditions. After a couple years, you can move them outside and let them start to experience growing seasons. I'd use your own plastic pots with drain holes and sow on a peat/silica sand mix or finely chopped sphagnum moss."

If you are, those are tropical pitcher plants, do not live in bogs, and would eventually rot placed in one. Not to mention they don't have a dormancy period.  Any temperate plants, Sarracenia, VFT, maybe Darlingtonia (depends where you live) and temperate species of sundew would work. If you want to make your bog unique, besides maybe having a mix of tall growing and squat species of the above, do some research on other bog plants. There are a great many flowering and just plain cool looking non-carnivorous plants that will grow alongside your cps and can really make a nice display.

Theyre very similar when the plants are young since x ventrata is a hybrid between ventricosa and alata. However they are still quite distinctly different.  At this age, ventricosa ""Red"" can be very similar to x ventrata, however there are a few very distinct features to the trained eye, one being ventricosa ""Red""s clam shaped lids are very shapely and distinct.  Look at the lid of my plant in the OP and compare it to this x ventrata: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Pitcher_tendril.jpg/220px-Pitcher_tendril.jpg"

SavageGarden,38e0bj,natchgreyes,3,Wed Jun 3 16:28:19 2015 UTC,"Hey Natch, I have a ~95% germination rate from over 300 specimens in the past year of B. Liniflora, B. Lamellata, and B. Gigantea. I found no smoke treatment necessary and seed freshness to be the biggest factor in germination. I currently have 100% germination of my Liniflora's (currently a stock of over 200 plants now) and 98% germination among the Gigantea (148/150 seeds only two weeks old after the seed pod blackened). I've double checked the flowers to Allen L's ICPS speech and his Carnivorous Plants of Australia to confirm they are indeed the species I've listed. I did this, because like you, I thought germination was tied to smoke compounds. This simply cannot be true as Gigantea and Lamellata can have multiple generations growing within the same season. My growing conditions are as follows. ~25,500 lumens at soil level with no sun on a 16/8 light cycle with the T5's 12"" from the pot (they're grown on a rack near a window, so the lumens increases dramatically depending on how sunny it is), 65-78% humidity (whole monthly range average for past 6 months), 66-77 degrees F (whole monthly range average past 6 months), steady ventilation and no cover to my germination pots, and only about an inch of water via the tray method. I never overhead water my byblis and usually I see germination within 3-5 days. After two weeks, or when the plant is an inch tall, I carefully over water the medium, remove the plant, and plant it in a mix of vermiculite/peat moss/LFS. Flowering takes 3 months in every species I've had. MaxSea fertilization at a concentration of 1 tablespoon per 8 ounces makes even liniflora grow to be 26""+. I currently have a ""rainbow bush"" as my girlfriend calls it, a 42"" liniflora with 22 growing points outside (I live in the PNW). I'm interested to see if the genus can tolerate a light winter."
SavageGarden,38e0bj,dispersado,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:03:05 2015 UTC,"Huh! That's pretty incredible! My seed is ~1-2 months old, I think. I have enough that I was running a bit of an experiment with different techniques. I'll have to try some with no treatment.   I've never had problems with B. liniflora. (Heck, I have some sprouting where I didn't even think the seed fell). That one doesn't surprise me too much. It's interesting that B. gigantea isn't tied to smoke compounds. Everything I've read suggests they pretty much decline in number until a brush fire goes through. Interesting."
SavageGarden,38e0bj,dispersado,2,Fri Jun 5 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing and couldn't find any literature to back up the results I was having. I've written Lowrie and D'amato to ask (Peter was kind enough to given e Lowrie's email) and am still waiting for a message back. Hopefully I'll get one soon that'll confirm that I indeed have a gigantea and whether or not smoke treatment is strictly needed (or if I have one that's mutated to not require, as I'm now in my second generation with no smoke treatment)."
SavageGarden,38e0bj,james26685,1 point,Sat Jun 6 08:34:43 2015 UTC,Please let me know what you find out. I found out a lot of my info from Adam Cross as he's done quite a bit of scientific work on Byblis germination.
SavageGarden,38eqmb,james26685,2,Wed Jun 3 18:55:56 2015 UTC,These are simply state restrictions. It's not the nursery's fault. They have to abide by the law. They list the restrictions on their website under the shipping page.
SavageGarden,38eqmb,bisnicks,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:58:16 2015 UTC,"I phoned them after posting this and was told it was because they (the nursery) did not want to have to pay for inspections or fines when they find infections (apparently ~$50.00/infected plant).  And also that they would have to send bare root (not a problem for me, but didn't sound like they wanted the hassle)."
SavageGarden,38eqmb,mobscura,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:11:50 2015 UTC,"Also it seems these restrictions are not followed frequently or maybe not enforced? Are eBay sellers exempt?  Case in point, I arrived home today to 2 identical boxes containing recent plant orders from different sellers one box was from Sarracenia NW located in OR, the other was from an eBay seller in VA. Both boxes were labeled live plants, and both were sent through USPS however the sticker on the SNW box looked like this: http://imgur.com/64DveWY and the one from the eBay seller looked like this: http://imgur.com/zTWKA03. The eBay sellers box traveled a lot more distance crossing through several states to get to me so would have more potential to infect things along the way no?"
SavageGarden,38eqmb,bisnicks,3,Thu Jun 4 00:51:54 2015 UTC,Rare Find Nursery is located in New Jersey. It's NJ state laws that impose these restrictions. Oregon obviously has different state laws that involve inspections they have to disclose.  It's got nothing to do with distance to the buyer. It's based on the seller's state government.

SavageGarden,38b124,YourRealMom,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:34:09 2015 UTC,"You don't need to fill them, they will produce a small amount of digestive fluid at the bottom. Purpurea like to be filled but others don't really.  Five inches of water is a bit much, I'd go with two or three. If you provide decent conditions it'll outgrow a six inch pot quickly, most sarracenia like a cubic foot of root space at minimum as they approach full size. Just something to consider next spring."
SavageGarden,38b124,bisnicks,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:06:38 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks"
SavageGarden,38b124,peoony,2,Wed Jun 3 23:04:50 2015 UTC,The only sarracenia that are supposed to hold water are S. Purpurea. Other sarracenia have hoods that help to keep water out so that they don't topple over from the weight of the water. S. Purpurea collects rainwater and uses enzymes to break down food. All other sarracenia can break down food without water in their pitchers.
SavageGarden,38b124,james26685,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"mine were empty when they were bought, but when i added a live ant to the empty pitcher it filled with fluid over a couple days, sarrencenia don't fill with fluid until they feel they have caught something. they do this to save energy"
SavageGarden,38b124,james26685,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:33:16 2015 UTC,"Except for S. purpurea which actually uses rain water collected via it's open hood traps to drown its prey.  Would be helpful if op posted a photo or named the species.  Also there seems to be some disagreement on if S. purpurea makes digestive fluids.  Barry Rice claims they do in the cp FAQ and says those claiming they don't have not been keeping up with current literature.  Both of my cultivation books as well as a bunch of online literature claim they don't, and use rain water combined with bacterial action to digest captured prey.  Even those claiming some digestive fluid is made initially still say that the main digestive action is bacterial. So you probably don't want to fill your S. Flava pitchers with water unless you want them to topple and not have the  digestive fluid concentration needed to effectively digest prey, however if you are talking S. Purpurea then you should fill with water if they are dry so that prey can drown and there is fluid there for bacteria."

I got one of those grow-your-own things from Lowes where the pitcher plant in it had gotten some sun or something and shot out some scraggly awful leaves that were all twisted just like yours there. See here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13781308/IMG_20140729_125841_607.jpg  If yours is also one of those grow-your-own things from Lowes then your twisted plant is a pitcher plant that I've heard is usually a S. rubra. Mine I think is a S. rubra too. The other is obviously a venus fly trap and that tall grassy looking one I think is just some weed. I've had little ones like that growing in a pitcher plant I got from Lowes but I always picked em before they got big.
SavageGarden,3857ex,notPelf,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:27:05 2015 UTC,"Yep its from lowes! My SO and I bought it pretty much as a joke. The thing looked so cheap, I never expected anything to grow. I just kinda threw it in the provided pot and I was surprised that anything was actually alive."

SavageGarden,3857ex,AaaaNinja,3,Tue Jun 2 01:52:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's necessarily sickly.  The Lowe's plants are propogated from tissue culture in test tubes.  It seems like instead of potting them up and giving the new plants time to ""normalize"" or grow into their normal shape before selling them, they're sold straight out of the flask.  So you just have to cultivate the plant for a while yourself to see what it actually looks like."
SavageGarden,3857ex,bloks1995,2,Tue Jun 2 06:52:49 2015 UTC,"A plant straight out of the flask isn't healthy in the sense that it can live in normal conditions. Also, for the plants I've seen come in death cubes, that looks ""sickly"" compared to some others. Normally the death cubes grow very wide, green leaves before they get to this stage. Not saying it's doomed, just not healthy right now. Given proper lighting, etc it will be fine, though it will probably limp along for a bit."

A quote from Barry Rice and his FAQ: ""To feed a dead bug to your plant, first drop it into the trap so the trap closes. Easily done. Next, ever so gently squeeze the two lobes of the traps between your thumb and forefinger, as if you were trying to pick up a delicate bit of...something delicate. Squeeze it a few times more, making sure the two lobes come into gentle contact with each other. This will flex all the trigger hairs inside the trap. Another method is to carefully insert a toothpick or blunt bit of wire (like a straightened paperclip) through the gaps in the loosely closed trap. Wiggle your tool a little, so the trigger hairs inside the lobes are stimulated."" http://www.sarracenia.com/faq/faq2460.html Also note that this FAQ is great for lots of good general information, some snarky humor, and every now and again some good old fashioned condescension."

SavageGarden,37ygdn,tommytimbertoes,1 point,Sun May 31 14:22:36 2015 UTC,"It's dangerous out there... (London) cold, rainy and marauding snails. :)"
SavageGarden,37ygdn,SFaustus,-3,Sun May 31 14:48:49 2015 UTC,Well it won't live long indoors. Good luck.
SavageGarden,37ygdn,tommytimbertoes,6,Sun May 31 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"Don't have that attitude please. It's not impossible to grow VFT indoors. Though as a note to the OP, since you said you're new at this, do make sure you have it in as sunny conditions as possible, and if that's tricky then I would suggest supplemental fluorescent lighting. Failing that, you may have an issue."
SavageGarden,37ydww,Lukanii,6,Sun May 31 13:10:05 2015 UTC,This is the same as a blue lotus or blue rose - fake.
SavageGarden,37ydww,piceaglauca,7,Sun May 31 13:19:52 2015 UTC,"It's scientific name is ""HOAX"". Or ""Ripoff""."
SavageGarden,37ydww,tommytimbertoes,4,Sun May 31 14:26:16 2015 UTC,It's a pygmy sundew with some photo manipulation.
SavageGarden,37ydww,YourRealMom,1 point,Sun May 31 16:54:10 2015 UTC,Thanks :)   How do you determine that it is a fake? So that next time I can know without asking you :P
SavageGarden,37ydww,AaaaNinja,2,Mon Jun 1 04:08:11 2015 UTC,Photoshop.  Apply the hue/saturation/lightness filter and slide the hue slider +108 until you get this: The plant's actual color
SavageGarden,37ydww,AaaaNinja,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:08:02 2015 UTC,Whoa thanks! What's the name of this plant?
SavageGarden,37vx6i,AllAccessAndy,3,Sat May 30 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"I received it in February with 4 tiny little pitchers. They quickly fell off, but it started to produce non-carnivorous leaves. It's been in a small terrarium that I just moved to my new desk at a new job and it has started to create new pitchers."
SavageGarden,37xdpz,Lukanii,2,Sun May 31 04:49:45 2015 UTC,"first one is just a connector, second just a filter (and not an RO one).  You need a complete system like this: http://www.amazon.com/Aquatic-Life-Reverse-Osmosis-100-Gallon/dp/B00DOG64FM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433053076&sr=8-1&keywords=aqua+buddy+ro"
SavageGarden,37xdpz,james26685,1 point,Sun May 31 06:20:05 2015 UTC,"For the second one, how did you recognize it was not an RO filter? I believe you but I'd like to know how to recognize them so I don't need to ask someone everytime.   Does there exist filters which do reverse osmosis completely including all stages?"
SavageGarden,37xdpz,Titular_Character,1 point,Sun May 31 13:03:11 2015 UTC,"Home Depot, Lowes, and Costco all sell decent RO units these days."
SavageGarden,37xdpz,Titular_Character,1 point,Sun May 31 08:44:27 2015 UTC,Do you know their prices?
SavageGarden,37xdpz,thuansb,2,Sun May 31 13:03:20 2015 UTC,"Home Depot's low-end one, $146. They go up from there."
SavageGarden,37ujg7,bisnicks,1 point,Sat May 30 14:47:19 2015 UTC,"WOW. Absolutely gorgeous, I think thats the most beautiful Sarracenia Ive ever seen!"
SavageGarden,37ujg7,Sashoke,1 point,Sun May 31 11:11:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks! They still hold a lot of potential. Once these pitchers mature, I'm hoping they look like some of these! It's a Sarracenia Flava var. Cuprea ""Copper Top""  https://www.google.com/search?q=sarracenia+cuprea&espv=2&biw=1680&bih=906&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=QS5rVfmHA8PLogSa8oHYBg&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg"
SavageGarden,37v873,iizbor3d,2,Sat May 30 18:00:49 2015 UTC,"looks like it's still viable, it's possible but by no means assured that it will make a comeback. I'd plant it with the other vft and do my best to ignore it."
SavageGarden,37v873,YourRealMom,1 point,Sun May 31 04:47:11 2015 UTC,I would actually like to see if it makes a comeback. So I will continue observing it in the small cup.
SavageGarden,37v873,tommytimbertoes,1 point,Sun May 31 14:31:22 2015 UTC,What kind of care is it getting? Indoor? Outdoor? What type of water? How much Sunlight daily? We need more info!
SavageGarden,37slj0,ThinkFastHippy,3,Sat May 30 01:31:39 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure daddy long legs (Opiliones) are a favorite food. I have some pretty neat pictures from last fall of some of my VFTs chomping down on them last year.
SavageGarden,37slj0,natchgreyes,2,Sat May 30 10:33:27 2015 UTC,"Despite the name, I think VFTs rarely catch flies.  In mine I often find beetle-looking half digested carcasses."
SavageGarden,37slj0,giact,3,Sat May 30 10:06:56 2015 UTC,Mine seem to only catch flies and an insane amount of them too. Very rarely do I actually see open traps
SavageGarden,37slj0,iProcreate,2,Sat May 30 10:11:17 2015 UTC,"I see! That's interesting.  Mine are almost always open. I live in north Italy, on the 6th floor of a building, if that makes a difference :D My droseras, on the other hand, are killing machines: they are packed with hundreds of corpses of tiny flies."
SavageGarden,37slj0,giact,1 point,Sat May 30 10:20:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/iProcreate. I wonder where that information started. I have plants outside in my yard that seem to only have flies trapped in them, and when they get larger midsummer it is not uncommon to find large wasps in the traps. I've also seen a handful of wild Venus fly traps and have seen a good amount of fly bodies within the reopened traps.  I did find it interesting though that one plant out of the handful of wilds ones had nothing but dead spiders in the traps. Not just young baby spiders that might have hatched nearby but actual adult spiders of the same species sticking out of every trap on the plant. For some reason local spiders were flocking to this one plant. Kind of weird."
SavageGarden,37slj0,reddittays,2,Sat May 30 13:56:13 2015 UTC,One of mine caught a snail a couple months ago. It must have come in on another plant and wandered into the trap as the plants were inside at the time.  http://imgur.com/4SGJWmh
SavageGarden,37slj0,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Sat May 30 20:54:32 2015 UTC,ya i catch alot of daddy long legs too

SavageGarden,37u2s9,natchgreyes,5,Sat May 30 11:53:04 2015 UTC,"Mainly because people with no education in certain plants don't know where to find them, outside of eBay.  It is the market everybody knows.    Honestly, I feel pretty educated on locating plants, but I wouldn't know where to go for fairly cheap tissue cultured Cephalotus, outside of eBay.  Hurts that there's no carnivorous plant forum containing the go-to market for hobbyist sellers."
SavageGarden,37u2s9,piceaglauca,2,Sat May 30 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"Hey, thecpforum.com is working on exactly that. A hobbiest seller marketplace. It's just getting started, check it out! Anyone can host sales. It will take a lot more people selling to make it the ""go to"" place, but that's the plan...  http://www.thecpforum.com/store/"
SavageGarden,37u2s9,UseUrLogic,3,Sun May 31 03:39:37 2015 UTC,"I make a lot of purchases on eBay, but most of the time they are from the same sellers cook's often list items on eBay that are not  available through his web page. Many times I am looking for something specific and resort to eBay after visiting a few web stores and finding it out of stock or just not available.  Some sellers (cook's) even list actual photos of the plant you are getting (not just a stock image).  And often there are deals to be had if you are patient and have the time to look.  That being said there are a lot of ripoffs waiting to happen, and anytime you are dealing with a new seller, time spent checking them out is time well spent.  Now just because I buy on eBay does not mean I am stupid about it..  For instance I wanted to acquire a D. Regia and no one has them right now.  So I looked on ebay and saw two listed with buy it now prices of $75.00 and $125.00 these prices are insane... So I ended up ordering 5 seeds and a two tissue cultured plants (in agar) from czplants.com for a grand total of $29.00."
SavageGarden,37tsmh,luckie_c,4,Sat May 30 09:28:31 2015 UTC,"They'll be fine, don't make a habit of doing it as some plants need a period of darkness to store ""food"" in the rhizome/sinks. However a single 24 hour photoperiod wont do any harm"
SavageGarden,37tsmh,violated_tortoise,1 point,Sat May 30 12:57:13 2015 UTC,Thank you!
SavageGarden,37trq7,violated_tortoise,2,Sat May 30 09:14:17 2015 UTC,Bayer advanced dual action rose and flower insect killer is what the guys at Sarracenia NW use. Make sure it is the pump sprayer and not aerosol can: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbRCdJ8ZNF0
SavageGarden,37trq7,james26685,1 point,Sun May 31 06:27:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I can't seem to find it in the uk though :/. I have Bayer provado, which has a different active ingredient, but it is a neonicotinoid like the one in the dual action spray. I might try it on one of my VFTs and see what happens."
SavageGarden,37trq7,tommytimbertoes,1 point,Sun May 31 08:48:20 2015 UTC,I believe Pravado is used by a lot of people. Check in the CPUK forums!

SavageGarden,37sn5j,GrandaddyFarooq,5,Sat May 30 01:46:02 2015 UTC,"Here's your answer, Steve_D at the Flytrapcare.com forums says: Leaves with no traps (just little pointed stubs where the traps should be) are normal anomalies for Venus Flytraps and nothing to worry about. They are very common during periods of rapid growth where a new growing crown is forming, or a new division, or in the rapid growth that often happens a few weeks after the stall that happens when producing a flowerstalk, or during the first growth of the season in the Spring. There are many anomalies of growth and leaf formation with Venus Flytraps; it's just ""normal"" for this strange plant. :)"
