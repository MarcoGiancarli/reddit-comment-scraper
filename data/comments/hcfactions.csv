HCF was way to strict on their rules, and that drove SO MANY PEOPLE away. I'd recommend rethinking EVERYTHING about HCF as a staff team along with highlife because this server was AMAZING before but it's dying a slow and painful death, which is kinda hard to watch since I played for so long."

hcfactions,3dzq32,StabbdNtheTumy,3,Mon Jul 20 21:04:32 2015 UTC,"I joined late map 7, not much was happening. I didn't have a faction I just thought the server was really boring.   Map 8 starts, I'm in a faction with Foxace, Nuboftheweek, Xeagu, JWLegacy, _Absurd, Chubbymoose, Malvist, Jacmag, and more. That fac is cool, until Fox gets banned for radaring which he was so meh. I am factionless for a lil bit, then Hedgz invites me to TCSP which had him, Micah, cowsofsteam, and a few more people. It is fun, but it gets boring and I leave that. I am LFF and not much is going on, until Livided gets me into Rome with foab and a bunch of other cool guys. Map 8 EOTW I join Baddies and die in like the second fight, I wasn't good at pvp then.   Map 9 rolls around and I start the map in ReCharge. It was the same core group of players from Arcane and it was fun at first. They were mean to Travisvv so I left and joined RankXI with Apache, Tethius, Jarl, Trigzy, Shaarrpp, Epicmursek, i360gfx, chris, and more. That was some of the most fun I had on the server. Fights were amazing. RankXI eventually disbands due to some conflicts and I join ReCharge again. I stay with them for a while, but I got Jarl invited me to Dharma so I joined that and stayed there until EOTW, in which I joined Alpha which was pretty much RankXI, Elite, and DerSheriffs faction. we split into 4 groups so we didnt have 40 people all talking in one mumble channel, and I happened to be put into the best group, group 2 :> We lose that EOTW, and there was some controversy going around, but it was still my fav EOTW so far.   Map 10 I join the infamous Strawhats, Dersheriff's fac. We dominated the map for like the first two weeks, then Apache and Dolan left because it wasn't fair and created flowr. We raided flowr a few times, it was fun, and then went raidable because xvslol had a pending invite and joined while we were on 1 dtr and killed himself. RIP The best base HCF was ever going to see :( Oh well, I stay in Strawhats that entire map and its fun, we lose EOTW so meh.  Map 10.5 rolls around and I stick with Strawhats. Was a really fun map, not much to be said. Similar to map 10 we had a rivalry with flowr.  Map 12: Im in RankXI again with Apache, unphair, jwl, and more. One of my top 3 favorite maps, I was always top 5 in rep and I tried really hard that map :P we won eotw.  Map 13: Im in ReCharge, we dominate. I sort of betray to spice things up but it is a fail. I just did it to get lives.  Map 14: Im in Foxden. We built spawn that map and it was fun.  Map 15: Im in foxden again, then join flowr. Was fun, that was the map where we lived right next to another power fac and had random ass fights.  Map 16: Im in flowr, then Absolution. I do EOTW with Lightbrigade and it was ok. Not my fav map because I had computer troubles with the new MC update.  Map 17: Im in FUNDA. It is FUNda but we go raidable and I end up joining TwilightZone for the rest of the map. we won eotw pretty sure, dont remember. I dsynced and died halfway through.  map 18: Im in foxden. we sort of win EOTW because we were allied with Desolate and they capped.   Map 19: I lead Koga for the entire map. Many people said Koga wouldnt last but it ended up lasting longer than almost all of the major power facs, not going raidable once. Def made HCF fun again. Nearly cap EOTW, but our cappers armor broke at 50 seconds :(   Map 20: I was in America at the beginning but quit that map early.   Map 21-Now: I dont remember any of these maps but  I know I was in Foxden for one of them."

hcfactions,3dzq32,Jarl_Herblings,2,Tue Jul 21 03:37:49 2015 UTC,"Map 8: Logged on and derped around for a second then got off, not really even worth mentioning but whatever.  Map 9: Joined SophieB120's faction on like 9 alts for dtr, barely played but learned about the gamemode a bit.  Map 10: Made a faction named Plawks with Dvart, Vartan2001, and CycloneMk2. Ended up going raidable 2 hours in, and made an EoTW faction named LonerCity a few weeks later with Chayne and RoundNightLord84, just to be slaughtered by a hacker.  Map 10.5: Joined NotKollusion, started playing rogue, and joined Reminisce for EoTW. Ended up being the leader of the MineZ skid alliance.  Map 12: Made WeenieHutJR. Left two weeks in to join Badlion, and later on became an officer after Conrawn betrayed. Lost EoTW because Ginie invited xvslol's alt to our faction.  Map 13: Joined Vandals as an officer. Ended up betraying for ReCharge, and made a small faction with Saunders named SofB. Allied Rebellion and rogued for them the rest of the map, and joined them for EoTW.  Map 14: Joined Rebellion. Didn't leave until we made Starfox for EoTW.  Map 15: Made WeenieHutJR, and had a nice time leading noobs. Eventually went on to create CookieHutJR with Vanilla for EoTW, and almost capped due to the low player count.  Map 16: Joined Absolution due to Kyd_Chroniik being a nice guy. Ended up becoming an officer before the big UlisesUN raiding us, and made some good friends. Joined Desolate after, and then became a Watcher later on in the map.  Map 17: Stepped down as Watcher a week into the map, and joined Bourgeoisie. Ended up leaving and joined Waterboys (Later known as Mallcops) after they capped palace. Left and joined PaulBlart with Kyle9/Apogon, and then left and created SixpoolSquad after our alliance with Mallcops was split. We terrorized Wayo and stuff, it was cool.  Map 18: Made GreasyGoons for the first time. Got banned in less than a week due to playing on Saunder's Evil Tower test server.  Map 19: Got unbanned a week into the map. Created LoliMilk, an ally of MegaMilk. Joined MegaMilk a few weeks in, and was a big supporter of the mega-alliance. Joined TwilightZone after the big betrayal by Apache and Tethius, and got kicked close to EoTW. Joined LittleTokyo, and then joined back with TwilightZone afterwards to help and cap EoTW.  Map 20: Made the GreasyGoons. Ended up leaving and joining Corndog with Travisvv, and swapped back and forth from the two. After getting pissed off with the gang, I left and created BlasterSquad with Senoxe. Left that faction later on to join America, to which I left a week before EoTW and created ReCharge with Phacad using the old Corndog base. I helped lead LittleGreaseCharge for EoTW, in which we got fucked.  Map 21: Joined ReCharge, and fucked up shit until Phacad ripped the faction for HCMemes. Ended up joining LittleTokyo and stayed until the next map.  Map 22: Created GreasyGoons, an actual power faction for this map. Ended up allying RittleRasia (Basically Rebellion), and completely dominating the map. We won EoTW, although I was on vacation.  Map 22.5: Played around 5 hours, disbanded the GreasyGoons faction because I'm stupid. Didn't play at all really, it was an awful map.  Map 23: Made a trading faction then quickly quit due to the many bugs. Later on joined Czonair's faction for a palace, but only played around 4 or so hours.  Map 24: Joined ReCharge just to have the faction fail in around two days. Created the GreasyGoons with a few friends, and found out about Wizard class from my trips to Evil Mines, and retrieving the tomes. Travisvv, ztask, and I made Desolate raidable using Wizard class, and ultimately put the server in the post-apocalyptic state it's in at the moment from all of the rage and quitting of big factions. We became a power faction after capping the next palace, and lost EoTW due to the Japanese alliance.  Map 25: Created the GreasyGoons and became a Watcher who could play on an alt. Lead the faction and capped palace with no contest until staff could no longer play on alts, to which I stayed a Watcher for the whole map.  Map 26: Stepped down as Watcher due to wanting to play and being sick of certain staff members. Made the GreasyGoons, and then merged with Corndog. Left Corndog and joined chinchin close to EoTW.  Map 27: Created the GreasyGoons with a large sum of people, and took it seriously for the first week or so. Ended up leaving with a few people and creating Sparklers, and later on gave the base to AlwaysLuke to contest the Japanese factions.  Read it if you wish, not that interesting but it's my history on here. RIP hcf."

hcfactions,3dzq32,xzElmozx,2,Tue Jul 21 17:20:36 2015 UTC,"Map 8: I join for the first time due to Justintb97 showing me the ropes of HCF. He got me invited to Rome where I met foab and Livided for the first time ever. Fast forward a little while and EoTw rolls around where I join some bigger faction. (Elite)? I remember raiding Badlion's bunker slaying ApacheBlitz with igotyou. I also remember fighting daeshik or Flint_Lock in some side room of palace and nearly dying. Then I kited like 7 Badlion with MrTwiggy and we ended slaying 1 and running away. I eventually yolo'd and died.   Map 9: The start of Map 9 was horrendous. I was invited to Elite with foab and justintb97. I remember it being a world painted map and a lack of trees so we ended up getting wood from an abandoned mineshaft. A week comes around and I was invited to RankXI with foab and justin. I remember fighting ReCharge outside their sphynx and shit talking Foxace36. I remember one time when I got in an enormous fight with them and my boots and helm were broken, when Tethius came out of a nether portal to save me. RankXI was such a fun faction. I met awesome people there such as Tethius,Ikel123,ZoveReign,i360GFX,chris752w, and of course ApacheBlitz. I invited my friends from Minerapocalypse to come over and they created Ethereal. We soon allied them. Most of the palaces consisted of RankXI,Elite,Ethereal vs ReCharge vs Badlion and Lightbrigade. My first ever Koth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fODa68bdZEs . One of the best palace fights of that map: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UACBqvjPoU&feature=youtu.be . After awhile RankXI disbanded due to internal conflicts. So I created Dharma with foab and Tethius. We allied Ethereal and we fought ReCharge A LOT. My first video ever recorded took place that map, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7jLnxH7eYk (This made me nostalgia all over my desk). My first 1v1 on HCF was against sNooPyO_O. Xvslol spectated and DIDN'T JUMP. I also 1v1'd ApacheBlitz that map and I used a prot VIII helm and got fucked. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESWIxsfj84k . Some other things to note is that ReCharge split and 2 and Phacad3 made a small faction out of RankXI's old base and HOLY SHIT were there fall traps everywhere.(Notably the one were there was a ditch going down to bedrock right under a small hill in front of their base. Fast forward to EoTw were Alpha,Dharma,Ethereal and Elite merged. That EoTw was a 50~ vs 50~ vs 30~. Alpha vs SwagLion vs ReCharge. Everytime we fought we focused Eum3,  https://youtu.be/taoiCV1RwYQ?t=51m25s . I eventually died on the capzone lagged out : (  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1LZnQHrQVc (RIP TWIGGY)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_0A0CqWTI  I'll type the rest some other time."

I made a bet to dividuum that I'd join fluffy some day, was a noob at this point.  16: Deez invited me to ShadowTrade, had loads of fun and made some very good friends with the fluffy guys, joined fluffy for  EoTW.  17: Hopped factions quite a bit this map, for some reason putting 'fluffy' as a previous faction makes you instantly trust able.  18 + : In Desolate/Skypeteam and fluffy during these maps and slowly stopped playing overtime.  TL;DR   Joining fluffy makes you an instantly reputable player and makes you known in the HCF world.  Excuse grammar."

Map 15 started and nothing really happened. Map 16 however was a massive changed and what made me fall in love hcf, we started a faction called Dinosaurs where i met many people who had a lasting impact me, Mig(Spanishpeeveepee) Vkz_IpredatorZ, Elunef and Stickwarrior. I later went and joined Decaden for EOTW and got 3v1'd and died lol. Map 17 was just drama with Detstef betraying us, Vk killing me because i tried to report a duping incident. Still fun map starting Belgian Potatoes with DetStef good times! Map 18 i made into Omnicous but then shitty betrayed us for Soupskidz and i was factionless for 2 maps (there was a period where Electroide got me into some random faction lol).

Me and Cumpass went off to fuck with strawhats and we got to there base. We see a few of them and I ask Cumpass if he wants to fight them. He tells me he already dipped so im left to kite from a few of them. This all happened right at a server reboot, so when I oppled I logged back in and the effects were gone somehow.  https://www.reddit.com/r/hcfactions/comments/1dy6gw/am_i_doing_it_right/ This is when people were drawing others and posting it and it was getting a lot of fame so I thought I would do my own with a twist. That is Cumpass btw.  http://i.imgur.com/Sb8yCYZ.png When I got some fan mail for ""cheeting"".  Map 9: Started out as a noob faction with a couple of friends from a different server, we didnt play much only got on to grind gear basically since it was vanilla. Went to EOTW solo and died instantly.  Map 10: Started out as a noob then got recruited by phacad into Pure which is basically flowr's mini faction. Soon phacad left for flowr and I join kyd_chroniik's faction. Me and the people I joined with were accused of betraying and so we got kicked (looking back on it the people I came with actually were betraying, but I wasnt in on it). Then joined Dinky with stabbd and a bunch of others and had a blast.  Map 10.5: Join petl which was a sub faction of flowr with kyd_chroniik and a bunch of others. Played that map out like normal then we ended up winning EOTW.  Played like 2 more maps then took a break from MC.  Map 16?: Joined Silverbacks/Rebellion and had some fun with sym and the guys.  Map 17?: Joined flowr the first week or so of the map and quarts built a huge hole in the ground and called it a base. We ended up going raidable and we split into 2 different factions (flowr and powr). I joined powr and we recreated the base but we got betrayed eventually and went inactive.  Played like 1 more map and took another break from MC.  Map 22: joined TheLads and had a good time but we then got taken out by Wayo........... gg  Map 23-25: Joined Desolate and chilled with them for a couple maps, had a bunch of fun. Occasionally I would swap to Stabbd's faction when they when inactive periodically. This is also when we all quit because of the wizard bug.  Map 26: Was drafted into Nick's faction which was a power faction untill they all went inactive, I then joined HCDetriot and had a bunch of fun and met some new people.  Map 27: Joined dogeclan and we ran the server for a couple weeks. We began to go inactive because of lack of players on the server. Then we went raidable and gg.

hcfactions,3dzq32,darksidedbeast,0,Mon Jul 20 22:20:14 2015 UTC,"I started out map 9.  I was in a literal shit shack with just a stair case down to a small farm with 2 wheat and one potato.  I didn't progress much farther than that before i died to someone i can't even remember.  I came back 9.66 and played with my brother until EoTW, and then started with my all time favorite map. Map 10.  During map 10 i made a solo faction, called faction (due to ignorance of how commands work lol) and actually worked my way up.  I had had minecraft for more than a year at this point but hadn't played in about 10 months before map 9 and didn't understand mining, enchanting, or brewing hardy at all.  So I had my brother help me and slowly picked up on the subtleties of HCF and how to operate best.  One day i invited a guy, Rowboht, to my faction.  He ended up being Xvslol and was just looking for a small faction to alt in, but I didn't find out it was him for a year later.  anyway the day after i invited him he left and joined Conan864's faction with the majority of my diamonds.  So i get to mining until Conan logged on and i just began cussing him out, saying he is a douche for having someone betray me, etc etc.  So conan, being the good guy he is, tells me come to his base so i can have all my stuff back and more, and even gave me 2 lives for my troubles.  Running there i got killed by mangitis with my only armor set and i had no pearls.  So i revive, get in iron armor, and run again.  I make it there and conan gives me tons of stuff and says i can have a base tour as well.  He shows me around and i asked if i could join, and he said of course.  So i asked him to come to my base so he could help me move stuff to his place, so he got his son online and all 3 of us headed out.  We got to my base safe and sound and got all of my valuables, brewing supplies, etc, on us and sat outside the base.  Conan went afk for like 5 minutes and i didnt know what to do, so i just stayed there, now in unenchanted diamond armor waiting.  So he comes back and types ""sorry about that"", and then i ask in chat if anyone wants a claimed base with a full enchant table and nether portal.  A noob says yes, so i invite him, and now 4 of us are outside.  Well what do you know, I see mangitis come over a hill, pearl at us, and pick up a quad kill, get all the things i worked 2 weeks to get, and kill me the second time in 2 hours.  I was pissed but i used my second conan life, joined LUCKY7, and f homed.  The next couple weeks were kind of a blur, i got an irl friend in the faction, we had like 11 people total and were pretty wealthy.  About a week and a half after i joined I log in to see a guy named Bacca2 in the base.  So i say hello, and he says he is the new recruit.  So conan gets on a bit later and bacca says ""FOLLOW  ME TO SPAWN, QUICK!"".  He was bringing us to EGG, our first ever, but conan and i thought he was trying to betray so we were careful.  Turns out egg was a lot of fun and my first of many.  So we get back to base and all is actually fine, so Bacca2 starts to make this ""conference room"" for the faction.  It was basically nether brick floor with melon block walls.  It was disgusting lol.  Anyways we had a great time and a few days later conan, myself, and Bacca went out to go get sand on 3 dtr in iron armor.  Jarl showed up and massacred us all and made us raidable.  I was pretty pissed so i used all 4 of my lives just to log in and punch jarl while he raided us.  Anyway we rebuilt and FastGhastBlast, Davisharr, toddgwozzd, and Soul818 joined our faction from the infamous Kingdomhearts.  Everything else went smoothly that map until Eotw where i got shot out of the water drop at our eotw bunker before capzone even went live lol.  Map 10.5 we did 8ball with some of my best friends I met here, andykay18, fast,  and conan.  It was really fun although the lives glitch ban kinda fucked up activity.  This helped me meet a ton of good friends like Joesziver, cmak, chaseair, jobre, xzElmo, eaglebagel, and vanillapockyfox.  It was a ton of fun and i got to go to eotw with strawhats, which was really awesome.    Map 12 i led my first faction, Lucky7, and this was probably my favorite faction to date.  We got betrayed a ton and raided even more, but ill be fucked if it wasn't a load of fun playing with an awesome group of people being in the middle of like 4 power factions of the map.  Was tons of fuckin fun and seeing the base as a koth a few maps ago was awesome to reminisce with.    Map 13 i did lucky7 again, and it was fun as fuck being allied to recharge. we got betrayed by 2 people who i am still friends with today.  Eotw was amazing and i got my first known player kill I had, which was Pattyo (lol)  Map 14 i was banned for most of it but eotw was fun and I got to meet my good pal CoreyRHS and do Bearclaw with spartan.   Map 15 was the 2 week map where phacad managed to get perm a 14 month ban.  So i did a 2 man fac with my brother, which i hadn't gone alone for almost a year, so it was awesome to get back to it.  It was hard and thrilling and i 1v1d 19 times this map and won 17 of them, so that was cool :^)  Map 16 was an amazing fuckin map.  Abso was awesome while it lasted and everyone in it was chill as fuck, too bad ulises v clipped.  Oh yeah btw deezneuces actually confirmed he did because Deez always had a minersmovies account above his base and went back and watched him vclip in.  Rip lol.  Anyhow after that I got to co-lead battletoads with glob, who, despite what most people say, is an awesome guy.  After that i joined flowr and got betrayed by acidnide after i grinded out 38 sets of prot 4 unbreaking 3 in 4 days.  Did lucror for eotw and died because my brother pulled the ethernet cable out of my computer.    map 17 was RAnkxi and it was fuckin awesome lol, while it lasted anyway.  Gotta meet some swell guys and had a ton of fun fighting, the competition between Rank, waterboys, sweatfest, TwilightZone, and Vietkong was one of the best and the fights were always fun.  It fell apart and i got back to Lucky7 for the first time that year and had a good time and combined with hogwarts for eotw.    Map 18 i was solo at first then joined soupskidz since Stimpy and i had become friends in rankxi.  was fun doing it for the map and playing the underdog for the majority, and ohana was fun to compete with.    Map 19 was soupskidz again and i co-lead with panda and stimpy this map.  I got some amazing friends like maqqle, qluso, minerjoe, warren, gumonkop, and more this map and it was a ton of fun.  We won like 2 of the palaces or something and got close at Eotw, and the tanky kit made fights awesome and long like they were back in map 10.  Map 20 was just okay, I didn't play a ton but we did soupskidz for the ""country"" map and we all lived close to each other.  We actually lived on top of cyanide lol.  Anyway the palaces were fun against america and the world paint was cool, but the EoTW was pretty plain and uneventful.    So map 21 comes around and recharge, who i hadn't played with in more than a year, returned.  It was fuckin awesome playing in a faction that 30 out of 30 of the members were cool and nice.  Eythx and i remade the map 13 base and the first 2 palaces were awesome.  Never forget the 21v96 recharge won in the first palace.  The fac died when everyone decided to go to HCMemes.  This is the only eotw i missed since i started playing, and it's only because no one went lol.   Map 22 i got grounded for the majority of it and only came back for eotw to lead lucky7 to suicide so i wouldn't feel bad about joining Eythx's faction later on in it.  It was a ton of fun having the old temple for eotw, felt a lot like map 15 and was really cool to play in.    Map 22.5 i was with deso and had a good time for the first couple weeks, but nothing happened really.  Eotw i just dicked around and joined amerinide for and actually became okay friends with Maihn.    Map 23 i did lucky7 again but the 1.8 map put a lot of people off,  so it was pretty inactive.  It was fun but we got raided 3 times because people don't know how to survive lol.    Map 24 was supposed to be recharge but then i joined katyperry, which was a lot of fun until wizard class came along.  The eotw was generally uneventful, but i invited a bunch of people and we raided the only power faction's bunker with like 8 of us and killed several of them.  Map 25 i did hyrule but there wasn't much competition. After the second palace everything from there was slow and boring  but somehow the eotw was a lot of fun.  We had like a 25 minute long fight or something near that where by the end we were just sprint jumping and using classes to get kills, and we picked up 23 kills in that fight.  Map 26 was the draft map that i put a ton of time into.  It was kind of a flop but it was really exciting to see life breathed into HCF again, and see the subreddit active and 400 people on for sotw.  Sure it failed in it's goal, but it was worth my time to have a couple more weeks of fun that I knew hcf had in it (:  Map 27, the current map, is and was pretty boring lol.  Nothing much to say, there are fun points but without sugar coating it it isn't a fun map.     It isn't the most interesting story, but HCF was the most fun i've ever had in terms of games and I wish it werent ending.  Thanks to everyone who made it was it was, because it was awesome (:"

hcfactions,3dzq32,Juliangs200,0,Tue Jul 21 04:19:23 2015 UTC,"Map 9: Joined DoctaShock's faction and was handed leadership, joined OCBP later on, stale map for me. got killed by MK325 while we were in mumble together and basically lost everything :)  A load of time passes.. I meet SectorOne, we play a SHIT TON of MineZ together and had the best experience possible.. Then we move on to HCF.  Map 13: Trueplex-  I join Trueplex which was basically SectorOne made by c8lluke on HCF. We are known as the bad guys of the server, we wreck shit up despite having very few members and being outnumbered.. We got raidable right before EOTW and I couldn't make EOTW cause of it.  Map 14- SectorOne  Once again, re-united. I join SectorOne in arguably one of my most fun maps, We have a load of fun fighting, grinding, etc.. We get betrayed by Lirky but we re-build.  We are once again outnumbered but still manage to win nearly all fights.. Very very fun map.  Map 15- Dench.  Dench was Cyanide's subfac. I once again have a lot of fun as we fight and go to Palaces with Cyanide. It was a really cool map, though I have had better. Still playing with the SectorOne dudes, which was the map where N3XT and Stain were in Cyanide while we were leading Dench. It was the map I met Driftinator and iiNuke, two really fun guys to talk to.  Map 16- Cyanide.  Didn't play that map really, joined Cyanide for 1 week, then quit.. Joined SkypeTeam later on in that map, but someone betrayed us and CrazySmokerDude just walked into my base with my facmate helping him and killed me, ended it all for me.  Map 17- SectorOne  Once again, a cool little map, I join SectorOne and we basically repeat everything that we did the past maps.  Map 18- MtnGoats.  Definitely top 3 most fun maps. I join MtnGoats which was a mix of one faction and SectorOne, we have a lot of fights, this time we were the ones outnumbering people sometimes although we did get outumbered at others.  Very nice time talking to the MtnGoats guys, had a lot of fun.  Map 19- pvpmen.  My best map by far, I met Syrate and Whoelie, two really nice guys.. I join pvpmen and I fought like atleast 3 times everyday.. It was a yolo faction so I was allowed to fight whenever I wanted to, Got trolled alot and raged in that map too... (fuck u tomo :D) I literally went to every single palace and we were allied with SkypeTeam, of which most of them really dont like me now, Koga, and SixOh, although we never really managed to cap due to how fucked up the kit was. But still an awesome map, got sniped by BL00DYT3ARS in EOTW though, my allly.. :( Worst EOTW because I was so excited for it and he ended everything.  Map 20- Germany and NicksTheViking's faction  I hated that map, I lost all my friends, Most of the people I talked DAILY with for more than a year came to hate me.. I was terrible in Nicks's faction, which was SkypeTeam and SectorOne. and I got kicked, I later joined the Cyanide's subfac, Germany, of which was lead by TheBominos and was enemies with Nicks.. I went to DragonKoTH with Germany and fought against my own friends :( :( :( I killed one of them, and then got banned from their teamspeak for a long, long time. I felt terrible about that map, as I lost so many great opportunities to play with SkypeTeam and.. all gone, all disliked me.  That was it for me, I loved this server so much, made so many friends, lost so many, and was hated by most. Although it played such a big part of my life.. It's actually unreal how a server can change one's life so much, Thank you all guys, HCF will always be alive for me. :("

Attended big events with other factions.  Map 10: Pytho with NotAPokemonPro and kydcronik, fun map, a lot of riguy hate.  Map 11: Joined Dharma, first time going to koths and palace in a decent sized faction. Great fun.  Map 12: Joined Bamphites, spawn fight pvp a lot, attended koths and Palace, one of my favorite maps.  Map 13: Joined Beta, my favorite map with a bunch of people i enjoyed talking to. Caesar58, Soccrdude, Alphaleads, Minerjoe, dickylickey, venk and some others. Attended many koths and palace's this map, I actually capped a palace this map! :D  Map 14: Joined TheLads (I think) but ended up not playing this map, became pretty bored with minecraft, so i decided to quit HCF.  Map 18: Made Swoobles with Twinxzy, markissocool1, MassiveORB and some others for nostalgic reasons, fun map, went raidable but came back.  Map 19: Not sure what I did this map xD  Map 20: Joined Brazil, did pretty decent in the beginning of the map, everyone became inactive and I joined ROFLCOPTER with Kyle9, xHippo, Atrain and others. Ended up joining America to loot Palace for my faction, but they ended up keeping me. We won EOTW and i was the FFA winner for the first time.  Map 21: Joined America again, did pretty well, not sure who won EOTW.  Map 22: I think i joined LIttleTokyo, not to many memorable things, learned a word or two of japanese though. xD  Map 23+  Ended up Joining Amerinide whenever they played on HCF, always ended up doing very well. Made my own faction, EliteMelons, during the draft map, we did alright, ended up going raidable due to EU's in our fac, met a lot of new people and it was fun.  I have played HCF for more than 2 years, its sad to see the server go but its for the best. I had a lot of fun here and met so many people, this will always be my favorite server, no clone of HCF will ever top it to me."
hcfactions,3dzq32,jjtt311,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:07:08 2015 UTC,"I started a long time ago on another account, map 12 i think. I played for an hour because I was like 10 and I didn't know how to get shit so yeah.  Then I came map 16 and was helped out by TeamDinosaur, but was fucked up. Started actually playing map 17, made a faction with TheCerealkill3r, minimus or _mini something like that, and my self. We constantly had fights with our neighbor eclipse but neither of us had shit so we would fight in iron. Then I met some men in kingdomhearts who would sit outside of my base for countless hours. So after that I decided to ask for some help, and this awesome guy named Russian_Octopus came and helped us kill them. Had my first diamond kill that day. Then I went on vacation and we went raidable but ok.  We then rebuilt again map 17 and I traded like 6 lives for 20 diamond blocks to 6pool cus I was a fuckin retard. Built next to Ohsoco, Rothien, RussianOctopus, HappyAmax, some of the best guys I played with. Then about 6 of MallCops pearled into my base, killed me, then t_destruction showed me where the hole was and let me go. Then played EOTW with some guy and killed some Kingdomheart fellas.  Map 18 we made our fac again, we invited RussianOctopus then later we all joined MooZ led my crazyman not crackershit. lol Then we fought Omnicious, killed Maks and they killed Cereal. We were pissed and hated each other. Then Cereal and I fucked over crazy and made KoolKats, then all of Omnicious joined us and we didn't invite maks I think because flyer thought timmy was gonna make him inside lol. Then anish stole all of our kills at eotw and yeah. Map 19 I joined Toga, i left because there were a bunch of fuckin retards in there. At this time i coulda sworn Tazz was like 18 but apparently not cus I just learned like a map ago that Tazz is a lot younger. Was not his voice I heard unless he used a voice changer. Then I joined QuakeIV and had a hell of a time. Met some cool people, was the shittiest fac ever but was fun. Then I learned about the cgoe and wholemilk1 brother fights and wholemilk1 had us get fucked up by pinecones several times. Then I joined DongerSquad and I insided them because they fuckin pissed me off, but I was a lot younger so I couldn't handle the shit I got and I made a post crying about it. Cgoe pressured an innocent 12 year old. I then ""quit"" hcf and went to Fohi.  Then I came back and made some small facs, I joined TheLads for a bit not sure which map but was kicked cus I never played.  Then I joined Titanic during the draft, we went raidable so I joined Poison, they never played so i joined KaBuM and had a shit ton of fun fucking people up at that palace even tho people talked shit to us every 10 seconds cus apparently we allied. We woulda capped that palace if we went to raid desolate after making them raidable haha.  Amazing server, whenever this server comes back in a few years I hope to see some familiar people around.  Is this subreddit staying?"

hcfactions,3dzq32,m0xyMC,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:30:19 2015 UTC,"REPOST STUPID AUTOMOD  In advance, sorry if things are inaccurate/sloppy doing this as fast as I can. Alright so first MineZ hehe,  I joined around map 7/8 just me running around with a couple of minez friends yoloing with stone swords didn't really know how the claiming system worked.  Map 9: Me and Brandon_y0 joined sotw and we got boats and he died from hitting an island and I died from rowing into wood and we were salty. (possible map 10 idk) Later, I joined trogs since I was in clique at the time, I remember us (vartan,adventures,soccerguy1515,souldemon,roundnightlord) all in iron in a snow biome and being forced to mine for our diamonds, and we would occasionally go out and go on the look out for raids and getting that occasionally naked kill. Pretty fun map I don't really remember too much.  Map 10: Me and Brandon_y0 go to strawhats base in pvp prot and make a dirt hut with a iron door outside their base and I forget who it was I think liftie or symotic or apache came to our house and kept trying to kill us. After we died I went on to make a small faction with my minez clan m0xy crew.  Map 10.5: Don't really know too much was a blur I think I played with my minez clan.  MY FAVORITE MAP!!! MAP 12: Alright, so me,brandon_y0,nathan5577,teexo run out to make a base and this was the first map to have horses I think so we all get horses and we make a base then get slaughtered by snakehunter23 on a horse. So I join Warhawks (prophettts and minecraftmatan's faction and a couple other maplez members in there) we were loaded it was a small faction and we were right outside RonPauls base who had the stronghold. I stayed in there for a bit then prophettt gets banned and matan is inactive so I leave to join Lucror (abstres faction who is a good friend of mine) and I shortly leave because no one was really in it to make my own faction Sion  you can see my base out there (the vine idea was abstres). Alright so anyways, I remember this clear as day I had a skelly spawner at the bottom and our farms were underground and our main chest room was on the 1st floor and our subclaims were on the top. There would always be ronpaul,badlion,rebellion?, and other factions camping us and we would occasionally get some archer kills on some known people and feel proud and what not. Then FanClub (alphaleads faction) came along, all they did was go out in archer and try to shoot into our base and hit pixels of our bodies thru the wall and damn did we hate them. We contested couple of koths, camped fluffy for noob kills, traded with that big trading faction (not fluffy some other faction). We also almost got betrayed I believe by cantsoar or powertaffy and ALMOST went raidable. I had tons of fun with this faction and think this is the most fun I've ever had in MC. OOOOO AND RONPAUL THE PERSON WHO KILLED YOUR HORSES WAS ME SORRY </3  Map 13: The tree map (Zerbia is what the minez skids called it). I believe I was in another faction of mine called The Hunchbacks which brandon_y0 led but soon gave me leadership after we went raidable to Jarl when someone tried to trap him in our base when we only had iron and he had full prot. None the less I had fun.  Map 14: I asked ekx to join Foxden, and he said no. I don't really remember too much from this map besides there was a volleyball court and a tower in spawn.  Map 15: I was in Lucror (abstres faction) I believe. Nothing too special.  Map 16: I made a faction by myself, got boring went inactive. Came back later and I had a bunch of palace loot and I was friends with a couple people in ReCharge and was invited by Codyos joined for around 6 days then was later kicked by Jboyd22(the biggest f@g0t alive jk), because he ""hated me"" and I've never talked to him. I was later invited to the subfaction then foxace became leader and went nuts and kick and killed everyone in the faction and I remember me being really good friends with someone whos ign was Shmurlly or something like that. Then I remember me being chased by AliBaba20 as soon as I stepped out of the door and I was only in iron and almost made it to spawn. Later joined Valor (ReavezZz faction) played until EOTW and join Lucror for EOTW and Backintown kept trying to spleef me off to my dead and I said to Abstre and backintown if he keeps spleefing I will leave and kill all the archers and I killed bashbog, and someone else. I went solo for that eotw then teamed with recharge members towards the end. I loved this map.  Map 17I made a faction with my good badlion lads (matt772 and Guru_Fraser) and we make the Badlion Tower outside of TwilightZone and just yolo this map until we were invited to TwilightZone. We won that palace and dominated the map later. I got kicked and then joined TurtleClan for EOTW. But before that I joined Hogwarts  Map 18: I am in danimals (faction led by KreepozZ) with a bunch of badlion ogs. I later get into foxden and a had a bunch good memories and we won eotw sorta we were allied with desolate and we helped them cap and we won the base building competition and props to darkshadow for building the whole underground of the base in a day.  Map 19 I was going to make my faction Sion , but half my roster was Cyanide who left to remake Cyanide, so I joined ReCharge, we were dominating the map but then haley6632 drowned in the base and then certain people blamed me and I guess everyone jumped on the banwagon and I got kicked and killed. Recharge then made themselves raidable.I then joined a bunch of eu friends.I then played EOTW with some ohana members.  Map 20: I was LittleTokyo, and then left to join swealcorp (dvarts faction). We would always yolo koths and go fight outnumbered fights, tons of fun.  Map 2(?): Watcher: )  Map 26: Made my own draft faction, pretty successful, and won EOTW."

hcfactions,3dzq32,Natfan,2,Tue Jul 21 22:55:27 2015 UTC,"Started HCF on Map 9 and joined globkako2's faction. /f home'd and suffocated. Ragequitted and didn't play until Map 11.  Map 11 I played with my friend CrashZombie and another guy. We were total noobs with only 3 diamonds. I remember when a faction was camping us and /u/ikel123 came and fought off the invaders. It was super scary seeing all those names above us as we cowered in our underground base. Shortly after a guy got into our base and slayed all of us. Ragequitted again.  Map 13 I think I managed to get in the Desolate Subfaction as I knew people from my MineZ days. It was either that or I was a basebitch in the Australian faction Electrolyte. I recall that we went raidable (Desolate) and as our leader ran out with all the valuables he fell down my fall trap.  I joined a few other factions but I was basically a random. Then I met /u/callum1370 on RPvP and we became friends. After a while we both got Admin on that server, but that's a story for another time.  Callum and I created CarpetTradingINC at around Map 15, a small trading faction with us and a few members of Clique, including /u/vartan2001 and Alyssa. We didn't do much that map, and went raidable after being baited by noobs who were griefing our base, only to be killed by a full diamond guy. We quit again.  Map 16 we recreated Carpet and invited Geopai/TheWhiteNinja123, who I knew from my Desolate days. He betrayed us (I think) and there was loads of drama. Can't fully recall what happened for the rest of the map, except for the fact that Ridgevales was our pet noob.  Map 17 I joined TwerkTeam and had loads of fun, even if they spoke Dutch 90% of the time. Our time together ended when Callum accused them of DDoSing him. I took the breakup quite badly, I recall. Sorry to the TwerkTeam guys, I'm sorry we didn't have more time together.  Map 18 was a big map for me. I created my own faction, CarpetTradingINC as a throwback to the olden days. We got about 5 members, one of which was Witte_Dwerg/Zaadlob, a noob who I befriended the map before.  We had a blast but I started talking to spazsquirrle, Zuergner, cmak and mtperry about becoming a Watcher. I applied using their advice and was accepted. I started mid Map 18 and stayed as a Watcher for 5 months until Map 21 (Aprox) when I was promoted to Admin.  As a player, a Watcher and an Admin I have seen the highs and lows of the server. I have had compliments and I have had abuse. I wouldn't trade any of it. It helped me develop as a gamer and a person. I will never forget the memories HCFactions has given me, and I hope for many more to come.  P.S. This was all written on mobile, sorry for any errors in both my spelling and my memory."

Map 13: had a small faction going with friends like TheOrangeBird and people i've long forgotten now, got raided by eaglebagel/daesium/lalskd + venk_ + minerjoe2 + alphaleads/walph and ended up moving to world border where i lived out the rest of the map, i ran around in archer a lot and went to desolates base after the raid  Map 14: didn't play too much but i distinctly remember pushing jessys horse outside of spawn and slaying it, giving the saddle to dan aykroyd and then being killed by glob outside of spawn a few minutes later.  Map 15:  start of the legendary MooZ faction played with friends who i had played with on minez for a while and we had our little faction and didnt do much that map, but got camped by chiki819 ohsoco rothien and jerebear345. was bummed out because map 14 was supposed to be a 2 week map but ended up being 8 weeks with this map being short instead.  Map 16: MooZ again, fairly rich this map with our experience from the map before, almost got raided by flowr several times, base got defended by sixpool a lot, got betrayed three times and broke open a window to kill vanillapockyfox and it worked, constantly had prot 1 until we had a grinder going. joined wayo for eotw.  Map 17: last map of mooZ, invited people i had met the map before, like KQouy/Qapitol who later left to join VietKong and YourBadM8.  it was by far mooZ's best map and one of the most fun for me, we went to a lot more fights (granted we were ass anyway) and started doing subclaims and stuff.  mooz eventually got betrayed by a couple core members and I ended. joined sixpool for eotw, and we did fairly well, suprisingly defeating recharge but ultimately being taken down by twilightzone(even though aparrently betrayed them he still thinks he won that eotw xd) pretty fun eotw and i met people like benh7 kyle9 tpot99 and ez_element.  Map 18: had a really rich solo faction and ended up joining TheVendors the second week in, we lived in close proximity to most powers (foxden ohana etc) and were usually peaceful with them, i fought with hotpockets in the end a lot and with the huge anti-ohana alliance at palaces, probably one of my favorite maps, ohana raided most of the other powers and it ended up with us recruiting tons of people and turning into a power, we allied foxden for palace and lost anyways.  desolate people left to make desolate for eotw and allied us/foxden and ended up capping, ohana was buttmad about their bunker too.  became good friends with kyle9 too.  Map 19: hated sixoh love u jackattack now.  joined azeron for the map, was around my vacation time so i missed a week or so of the map, kyle got banned at SoTw for world downloading evil tower the map before with sixpool and co. came back after vacation, got really rich but then got betrayed by someone in bearsquad or whatever.  met people like darkslay and others. kyle joined cyanide and i dicked around for a couple more weeks until kyle proposed a new faction, we tried and were raided by sixpool once, but i escaped with the goods and got away so we could start again.  we ended up turning into a semipower able to contest koths and such and allied koga until ratarta betrayed the alliance at koth. i met people like dest in the new faction. got denied from desolate earlier in the map and was sad (fuck u tom). we were really rich, had like a dub of each piece and like a stack of opples and plenty of valuables.  dope ass eotw bunker, burned all our shit and yolo'd against soupskidz.  Map 20: really shitty kit really shitty map but still played, made canada(azeron basically), built a dank as fuck base and merged with ronpaul, met xhippo, zyastra, apogon, bhird, randerson, rofl and tons more. had a fun time building and capping koths, left the faction for a bit when they allied jhalts faction, palaces were all pretty shit because of the kit, nothing too important happened, i joined skypeteam for eotw and met a lot of people i played with a lot after. we all starved to death because hunger was fucked and me and sloth were sole survivors, colonel cat killed atrain and gave his food and spared me.  Map 21: joined sloths faction for the first couple days, ended up leaving to join lvysaurs faction who i  met on k 0 h e e in lingling a couple months before, we were a pretty rich faction, met people like kingoros, hoodratcat, obeythefro, lots of octc people.  nothing much happened that map after recharge, we went archer to palace even though the class sucked and we were allied to everyone without anybody knowing it and killed fierceillusion and said it was an accident(sorry duckboys), ended up focusing to help recharge since they were outnumbered.  faction went inactive, joined zyastra, it was shit, then i joined sloth and yolo'd later on at eotw.  Map 22: one of my best maps, started off with ez element but was inactive so we remade lvysquad and mined our asses off, 13ish stacks of dblocks in the first week as a ~15 man faction, we had the enderdragon egg and tons of shit, merged with kyles faction and moved next to palace with an 100x100 claim. we stayed small and assisted banter bus at palace for the archer yolo and at koth when they went raidable to pvpwizards.  map ended up getting stomped by littleasia alliance, i received leadership of the faction at eotw, grinded out a dub of each piece and put together my faction full of skypeteam/desolate people and lead pretty much the only fights againt symotics faction at eotw, played with a lot of new people that map and had a pretty good time.   Map 22.5: first official map in desolate even though i played with them for a while now, got banned for a bit for xray(fuck you seek) got unbanned went to a couple palaces, started talking to people like stabbd darksidedbeast and aparrently more. northing much happened, map 12 spawn foxden came back some big fights, amerinide won eotw i think atrain led them to kill me and i yelled at him xd.  Map 23: 1.8, 4.0 everything sucked, a little after shitty admins were promoted didnt really play at all, meangirls for the last palace and eotw, everyone allied against us but ended up losing to the japanese because they really sucked. got accepted into meangirls for the next map.  Map 24: joined katyperry/meangirls played with a mix of desolate and other good people, dominated for the first week, dumb admins made wizard and refused compensation for their error, map pretty much died right there, ended up raided sixpools faction at eotw with stabbd and co (around 7-8 of us took their bunker of the 50 man alliance). nothing much happened since the admins fucked up so bad. joined littletokyo/supersaiyan for eotw maybe i think we won idk  Map 25: joined hyrule and played until raidable then i played with mymmeykos/guru got banned for xray because i didnt really care anymore, ended up coming back on alts the last week to play for palace and eotw (love you stabbd bro). noob admins kept banning me, frustrating but i went through many alts we won eotw and stuff i think yeah. didnt play that much though.  Map 26: led my draft faction WORLDPOLICE, met a couple new people who i actually liked in the draft faction, someone made us raidable when i wasnt on, dont really know what happened tbh, ended up joining exodus/desolate, had a great time in the faction especially at the palaces and when we went raidable and made paperboys raidable, overall pretty fun faction but the map wasnt all that great, but definitely better than 23-25. had a good time with my friends though.  Map 27: joined chicago pockets didnt play, joined dogeclan, went raidable to falltrap, blahblahblah idk pretty shit too"
hcfactions,3dzq32,rkawesome,0,Mon Jul 20 23:01:07 2015 UTC,"I dont know if kingstar is still active, but if he isn't that makes me the only known surviving Map 1 player.  How i got to HCF started in late 2010 for me. I joined a group called ""Minecrafters"" on the old Bungie.net forums(RIP), because my brother was in that group and had shown me minecraft. My brother eventually left the group to lead the largest group of Bronies on b.net(he's over it now, don't worry), so I was alone in this group. In this group were two people that anyone that played old HCSMP should know, Random902 and Scatcycle. Scat and I were best buds on the server, and we were both good friends with Random.  Fast forward to September 2011, and Scatcycle and Random both make posts, separate of each other, within 20 minutes of each other, talking about a new server called Hardcore SMP. The idea, as you all know, was that upon death you were banned for an amount of time, and on HCSMP it was until the end of the month. So I, along with 3 other players: Eldisty(who old HCSMPers would also know), Varrda and Trone, set off into HCSMP to make our way through the world.  Not long after this, I had set myself up as decently prominent within the community, enough so that multiple told me to try AmishSMP, a spinoff server of HCSMP, run by ScreamingAmish, because he thought the deathtimer was too long, and lowered it to 7 days. I spent most of my time after school splitting time between HCSMP and Amish. Eventually, I met xCoyote18 and zacski1 on Amish, and I started being a very well known member of the community, with the opinion of me falling fast after I killed Roob3rt/x2robbie2x. Coyote soon became an admin on Amish, so we went mostly back to HCSMP, where I met mcfluffykins, Rayzion/ZoveReign, xHippo, Iguana, Ryanrolls, cliffnerd5, TheSmallBones and so many other amazing people through zac and coyote.   Not long after is when Team AVO attacked KKMC, which, as an AVO fan, lead me to find and start playing the server. I spent my time wandering around spawn, talking with other players I knew from HCSMP/Amish, then I get a message out of the blue from an admin named vivamc. See, KKMC wanted people to not fight outside spawn then just hop back in when the going got rough, and they didnt have coders like Raifiki and company to code pvp tagging. So, they just surrounded the outside of spawn with flowing water. viva was the one who set this up, so he asked me to help test it, and warned people in chat before I left the spawn that if they killed me they would be banned. I died 5 times that day, 5 people were banned for like 2 hours that day and i was revived from a 15 day deathban 5 times that day. A couple weeks later, viva messaged me saying that he had started up a new server and I should check it out, which, of course, was HCF.  Map 1 was simply a gigantic clusterfuck of no one knowing half of what they were doing. This was not long after enchantments were added, so not many people knew them like they do today. rrowland is more of a meme on this server today, but he thought of the craziest shit back then. One of the specific reasons Highlife started HCF was because he didn't like how everyone had to hide their base, in fear of it getting raiding, so factions were supposed to be able to build beautiful bases openly. Except, of course, he forgot about tnt, which rrowland heavily abused. The server was rather small up until this point, and then Highlife makes his Greysoul Post and the server exploded.  Map 2, I did more noobish stuff before getting invited by TehSamace(I think?????) to RizingSun, where I am joined by none other than ZeroStar and Zuergner. We didn't do much, but it was a lot of fun.  Map 3 was probably one of my favorite HCF maps. I was in Hypnotoad with Travis, pk, supposed, ilikecheese, soggylettuce, whosnick Boweee, micahrichey, and someone named Dagale, who is known as the ONLY winner of the Player of the Week award(god damnit Highlife...). Although there were some problems, mainly being that Travis used an alt to store our valuables and cheated to make the faction powerful, I still had a ton of fun. Also I was a member of NorthKorea, Phinq's 60+ man faction that we made for EOTW.  Map 4 was when I rejoined with my buddies from HCSMP(I was still active there this whole time mind you) and we formed a faction called, HCSMP. I remember I pulled 3 straight all nighters in my old basement playing with them, and I was clean as a whistle that map, although pretty much everyone else in that faction hacked.   Map 5 was fairly uneventful for me, although I did spend some time in RONPAUL, which was originally formed in Map 3 while I was with Hypnotoad.  I barely played Maps 6 and 7  Map 8 was a pretty dead map, although that was when MineZ players started to join HCF, leading to one of the greatest maps ever.  Map 9 I got banned for alt-logging about 2 weeks in(Alt-logging was when you would do /logout then abuse a bug where if you pressed alt you would be frozen and you couldnt move, look around, or use your keyboard, and no one could damage you.). So i went onto an alt, can't remember which one, and formed a solo-faction called jessyiniowa, after jessy, who had blessed my base with her face.  Map 10 was another solo faction map for me, although I did end up allying with strawhats. Strawhats saved my ass that map, I had been talking to someone and told them I had gone mining, and me, being careless, had a wooden door being the only protection for my entryway into my house. I got back from the trip, and the door was gone, so naturally, I ran out of the house in fear, while messaging my strawhat friends that I thought i was in trouble. Of course, the person who I had talked to(honestly don't remember anymore) and his faction were crouched in my basement, so they chased me out and I ran towards spawn. Not long after, like half of strawhats dropped down from the sky and began trying to save me. I ended up dying, but someone on strawhats revived me and they guarded my base until I wasn't raidable anymore.  Map 10.5 I built right next to strawhats and made a sub faction for them, also in my top 5 maps.  Maps 11-18 are really vague, I remember maps 11-13 I was in Mako/tilidine with Sluttycow and mukmukbaws but I only logged in once or twice a map for 14-18.  By the end of Map 13, I had lost all interest in minecraft, and only logged in on my alts to see how the server was running. I was playing with a few people from Bungie around when map 19 started, and i accidentally tried to log into Shotbow, and I wasn't banned on rkawesome anymore. I thought it was strange, so I tried logging in to HCF, and i could log on. My permanent ban that had been levied  more than a year ago by akalen4u was lifted. Why I was unbanned, be it the system said it was a permanent and I was just banned for a year, I don't know and I don't want to know, but I was back in business.  I played with a few homies (Meangirls is the best) throughout Map 19, then Map 20 was the recreation of RONPAUL. This went terribly. People we wanted to play never played, I eventually left cause a few people who Hippo like were total douches to me.  I didn't play that much 21-26.  I made my quitting post while my old Watcher application was still being discussed, and i told the admins I was no longer interested in the position, even though I was. Then when I saw the dire state HCF is currently, I reapplied, wanting to make the server better.  I do not enjoy minecraft as a game that much anymore, which is why I quit in the first place. I would have never made a quitting post if I was accepted to Watcher before I decided to post it. I still love this community and I'm gonna put in all the work I can to help HCF come back better then it ever was before.  Excuse spelling/grammatical errors, I didn't feel like proof reading 8.8k characters"

hcfactions,3dpqn2,KingBumii,7,Sat Jul 18 06:39:44 2015 UTC,Hcf just cant compete with the other faction servers  also the same thing gets boring after 3 years
hcfactions,3dpqn2,Freshtoast15,3,Sat Jul 18 09:44:17 2015 UTC,Rofl be in a faction on any mc server guaranteed 2/3rds of any large faction r@dar at least. Most just stop there because tr1gger is so easy to spot but some do and aut0clicking is super common as well. I mean when it's a regular thing for you to be full invis mining and get dug straight down towards and killed you put yourself at a huge disadvantage. When shit like this happens regularly and you don't get any gear back of what you lost yeah I can see why so many people r4dar now. If you are a fair nonhacking player and don't have r4dar/×ray and you mine then you're likely going to die since people would just get the kill and not care about bans.    H4cks are like a virus because you need h4cks to beat h4cks and this just makes more and more people h4ck. Spreads continually.
hcfactions,3dpqn2,KingAntelope,2,Sat Jul 18 13:35:13 2015 UTC,same thing gets boring if it doesnt change for 3 years
hcfactions,3dpqn2,ikel123,3,Sun Jul 19 04:28:37 2015 UTC,"This isn't why HCF failed. Although the lack of enforcement amongst obvious cheaters was a definite turn off for most serious players, it wasn't the deciding factor in anything. I can personally say that I'm disappointed in how minimal an anticheat has to work to catch some of the people who regularly played this server for years. The competition is doing better not only from paid advertisement but also because they actually listened to those paragraph long recommendation/feedback posts I made. itsjhalt took my recommendations and used them to perfect a game-mode that was already pretty good, and now he wins. Last problem is Shotbow brings no sense of competition anymore. HCF shares a lobby with Anni, MineZ, Smash, and whatever else is actually still there. That makes HCF look like a minigame, not a 'high-level adrenaline pumping competition'.   Also I'm not sure what you think 'the best' are, but let me explain some stuff I found while looking throughout private clients. Ethylene was developed under FrozenOrb LLC and was written for Minecraft 1.7.2 as a Forge Mod. From what I can tell it was developed sometime back in the middle of 2014 for FrozenOrb to use, not test. It's obviously not a 'anti-cheat test' mod in the way it was written and was used by itsjhalt in the time he played HCF along with clients such as Flare."

hcfactions,3d3nxv,cgoe,2,Mon Jul 13 16:15:43 2015 UTC,"We always want to control how the server works as a community and that slowly destroyed it and it's our fault. If we rejoin hcf, create a few big factions we'll be alright and slowly gain members to play on it again. People with high sub youtube, connections, and friends (lol not me) could get all their followers to join hoping to lead atleast 120+ each day next map, that would skyrocket the numbers because i have began to play on it again. With 1-9 people constantly online it doesnt have the pvp but you can still see the chances it has to come back. So it is our job too as the consumer to help out the company producing, they don't have the money like they used to because so many people switched servers so it maybe hard to advertise.

hcfactions,3ctpxm,Johnzeh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:05:09 2015 UTC,"It looks cleaner. I can sit here and explain it to you but it's honestly preference. I wanted my videos to look higher quality then everybody else's in both CS and MC so I scaled both my monitors down to 1280x720 for recording/streaming purposes. Another pro to that is doubled FPS due to my graphics card working half as hard. You can use these exact settings with 1920x1080, but you're product is going to look much more different. Here's my testing it: https://youtu.be/r5kpeL1xOpo?t=38"
hcfactions,3ctpxm,TopShadow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:18:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, wasn't even thinking when I said that.  I forgot you can't scale game resolution down like you do in CS:GO, I do the same for CS:GO so I agree."

hcfactions,3ctpxm,JTB248,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"So you got a 120 or 144hz monitor? If not, you aren't recording at 120fps.  Also, if you do have a 144hz monitor like me, make sure you set the refresh rate to 144 in windows, or else it will be at 60hz by default."
hcfactions,3ctpxm,JTB248,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:48:57 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure im still recording at 120 fps without a 120 fps monitor
hcfactions,3ctpxm,thebiggestgamer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:22:58 2015 UTC,"So you currently have a 60hz monitor and can only see 60 fps no matter how high an fps you get in any game. Action when recording shouldn't be able to record more than 60 fps(unless it is creating extra frames somehow?) and if you can watch the video after, it is in 60 fps or else your monitor would make it seem choppy as it is double the refresh rate of your monitor. Also as YouTube only allows 60 fps videos there is no point in recording in 120 fps even if you have a 120-144hz monitor besides for slow motion purposes, otherwise it is pointless as it will look no different."

hcfactions,3cpt1i,Samstag1,2,Fri Jul 10 17:30:04 2015 UTC,"From my experience from my past vacations (went to bed at 3 am and slept until 1 pm) ot sounds to me like you meesed up your sleep schedule.  What always helped in that case was to stay completely awake for one night (you'll be tired as hell the next day, but bear with it) and then go to sleep at 8 pm. You'll more than likely won't sleep very good and wake up early, but from then on continue to go to bed at 8 pm to 10 pm. After a while your body should automatically readjust due to the fatigue every evening and it basically telling you to go to sleep.  I started that always 3 to 7 days before the end of my vacation (depending on how long the messed up sleep schedule went on for) and it has helped me most of the time.  Mind though that everybody is different - it may not help you as well as it did me."

Maybe do some GoT type shit and have houses instead of factions, and make it so each house has a large amount of land that they can build on and shit, and let people capture other houses etc"

hcfactions,3cghdr,_Domidamn_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:01:28 2015 UTC,"The archer is a great idea! But I feel that you can maybe do bigger things, for example the suggestion by jjt to recycle old maps or suggestions like the 1v1 arena everyone keeps asking for ( I've even seen some designs for it on Czonairs build server even :P) I know you guys probably have a lot of discussions about potential yolo's, but I think you peeps lack the confidence to actually implement these yolo's. So why not put the hcf dev back up and test some of these out while simultaneously running the hcf map, it would be a good way to see if the community likes it if you aren't to confident about an idea. (sorry for travelling a bit of topic lol)"

hcfactions,3bu7bc,Eringikun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:01:13 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this a while back.  First of map server is busy and full...then when people/factions go raidable people just quit instead of rebuild and the map loses players.  If the regeneration time was lower...their base would not be a hole in the ground and maybe there would be some incentive to rebuild instead of just starting over or quiting.  And to make it somewhat easier and to not take away from the hardcore aspect...when admins are on towards middle end of map..spawn a cow in the wild here and there.  Plant some reeds.  Spawn a few chickens.  Don't advertise the location or anything.    Part of the problem imo is its easy to get started...hard to very rebuild do to the lack a resources.  If you don't get cows, chickens, wart etc at the beginning of the map your screwed.  Let alone rebuild a base and gather resources to be competitive.  Lower the regeneration time...just to get unraidable and have a base to at least try to rebuild might give some incentive to stay and rebuild instead of just bailing.  There would still be time to loot and pillage.  Not saying make it hard to go raidable...just don't be raidable for so long...then they might have something to come back to and have an incentive to stick around.  I dunno...just brainstorming."

hcfactions,3bsnky,ImRainwater,2,Thu Jul 2 01:00:51 2015 UTC,Maybe not shut down completely. Keep a kit map up which is something that doesn't require a lot of maintenance (besides banning cheaters which could be done by watchers)

hcfactions,3bsnky,SwissRabbitLoL,2,Thu Jul 2 03:06:42 2015 UTC,"Factions is fun if it's actually about Factions and not raiding. A faction is a group of people. Badlion map 8 was an actual honest to god faction: there was trust, friendship, and we had people who had nothing at all to do with the hardcore stuff for the most part like yourself and Tea. It's fucking minecraft, player stickiness is going to come down to social interaction, not mechanics, most of the time."
hcfactions,3bt4n8,Chocolate_Bomb,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:51:00 2015 UTC,if this is something that happens i think there needs to be a better or more accesible tutorial or intro into at least how the server works with dtr and such because i feel like new people are less likely to keep playing when they die right away because they don't even understand how hcf works  perhaps tho this would just be counter-intuitive to making it more hardcore
hcfactions,3bt4n8,preflora,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sure we could get some sort of tutorial out there. I'll see if we can have another contest or competition for who's claiming tutorial/overall tutorial is best, and give some XP."

hcfactions,3bt4n8,preflora,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:25:17 2015 UTC,"Hcf is pretty hardcore as it is; this is part of the reason why hcf is slowly dying. Other servers have been introducing a toned down version of hcf featuring 2 hour deathbans, cheaper crowbars, etc. Increasing the difficulty and ""hardcore-ness"" of hcf would only deter more people from playing, sure you'll get the usual 50-100 people to come try it out but it will slowly die out as it goes along.   theses are all my opinions btw, who knows maybe this could be the answer to the server's misfortunes..."

The only way to get hcf popular again is appeal to younger people (the majority of Minecraft) who are not ""pros"" like most people here at minecraft/pvp. Also you say the staff are not active? Whenever im on there is at least 1 staff on. They are normally vanished so you cant see them in tab.  Also everyone wants a shorter deathban so they can pvp more. Who would ever pvp if you cant play for 5 days after."

hcfactions,3bpi6r,TheStickWarrior,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:44:17 2015 UTC,"I though b4 map 10 there was no fac cap  If the server is going to remove the fav cap you also need to remove corners in cap zones because with 100+ players in a middle stack could be difficult to knock  it seems the only way to make the server come back to glory is to increase the faction cap, during map 22 the cap was 40 and many people played  depending on how much the cap is DTR should be adjusted otherwise"
hcfactions,3bpi6r,SwissRabbitLoL,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:33:49 2015 UTC,It was capped at 60 lol

hcfactions,3bqjcg,Sweetman96,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:11:12 2015 UTC,"Chinese Australian:       Chinese Australians (traditional Chinese: 華裔澳洲人; simplified Chinese: 华裔澳洲人; pinyin: Huáyì àozhōu rén; Jyutping: wa4 yeui6 ou3 jau1 jan4) are Australian citizens of Chinese ancestry. Chinese Australians are one of the largest groups of Overseas Chinese people, and is the largest Overseas Chinese community in Oceania. Many Chinese Australians are immigrants along with their descendants from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, as well other countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore who have immigrated from Southeast Asia that include large populations of the Chinese diaspora. Chinese Australians are also a subgroup of East Asian Australians and represent the single largest minority in the country constituting approximately forty-percent of the Asian Australian population.    As a whole, Australian residents identified themselves as having Chinese ancestry make up around four percent of Australia's population or approximately 865,000 people as of 2011.  The early history of Chinese Australians had involved significant immigration from villages of the Pearl River Delta in Southern China. Less well known are the kind of society Chinese Australians came from, the families they left behind and what their intentions were in coming. Many Chinese were lured to Australia by the gold rush. (Since the mid-19th century, Australia was dubbed the New Gold Mountain after the Gold Mountain of California in North America.) They sent money to their families in the villages, and regularly visited their families and retired to the village after many years, working as a market gardener, shopkeeper or cabinet maker. As with many overseas Chinese groups the world over, early Chinese immigrants to Australia established Chinatowns in several major cities, such as Sydney (Chinatown, Sydney), Brisbane (Chinatown, Brisbane) and Melbourne (Chinatown, Melbourne).

hcfactions,3bo99z,Johnzeh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:36:36 2015 UTC,HCF hooking into Shotbow was somewhere around 2-3 years ago when the only hardcore faction server was HCF. I can't even count on both my hands how many HCF servers there are now.

hcfactions,3bo99z,Ruhzzy,3,Tue Jun 30 21:02:23 2015 UTC,Fuck that shit. We didn't sit around in map 7 and 8 and just accept the server was going to die. We asked the admins for help and worked with them to figure out a good way to attract new players and keep them.
hcfactions,3bo99z,TheStickWarrior,2,Tue Jun 30 21:08:59 2015 UTC,"You seem to be always living in the past, times have changed man.

I hope you guys know regardless of all the crazy things said, I care. You're not left in the dark. Lighten up on our team a bit. I know we make mistakes or some of us aren't around.. but everyone works hard, and putting us down is only going to make things worse, not better. <3"
hcfactions,3bo99z,SaltySavvy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:35:18 2015 UTC,"I understand that you guys are working on it and that you care. But when admins are playing on other servers instead of helping on hcf. HCF is literally on life support, the only new people coming are from shotbow. It is not enough to keep going. At peak times there maybe 20 people on. I understand holding meetings and then giving each other a few days to think things over, but when its literally on the brink of death you have to move quicker. Atleast give the community something, or else they'll just cut it all out and move on.    Lighten up on our team a bit   Sure thing, but the reason why you guys are getting all this heat is because it seems like nothing Is getting done."

As to other servers where the server owners just do it    I've already explained this to anybody who's asked about working with shotbow: Shotbow is not a hub-styled community for servers like MineZ and HCF or even a Practice Server like ihok. MineZ and HCF would be far more successful if they were ran as standalone servers. Nobody honestly cares if shotbow's ranks are still in place and if you'd still have to pay for anything in-game through shotbow, it's just the fact that HCF is treated as if it's a minigame. Minigames are something short and sweet, gamemodes like HCF/MineZ that take days to weeks are something that need to be treated far more seriously. A server 'sponsored' by shotbow would look a lot better."

Fraps and Banicam are bad to use cause they hook into your CPU to much so unless u have like 4.7 GHz CPU don't use it cause it will hurt minecraft since minecraft uses more CPU then memory to run.  I use Action (One of the best out there ATM) it uses a multi threading system where it breaks the recording function into different cores of your CPU so it doesn't kill your computer when you hit record.

Because that is a config thing and we need a lead admin/dev, who have lives and are living those lives to do that, so sorry you had to take the harder way out (ironic, it IS a hardcore server) and deal with a full 30 minute cap time.  Put together your staff team revamp, I don't care, but there will be NO staff team that fits your liking I hate to tell you. Once they start being strict and enforcing rules as they're to be enforced they won't be your favorite anymore, hate to break it to you."
hcfactions,3bd0wb,Davidss10001,7,Mon Jun 29 19:38:12 2015 UTC,So what going to be done about the dying server?

hcfactions,3bd0wb,CrackerJack7209,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:12:48 2015 UTC,"He's not a lead developer, he's just a developer who doesn't have as much access as the other leads.   Honestly it can't be anything we're doing wrong at this point. I'll face the fact that we're slowing dying down but at this point it can't be anything we're doing. We nearly bend to every single request of a player, and if you are so upset about having to stand 30 minutes on a red square because you want to get back to playing your other servers than I don't really care to hear you guys bitch about it."

I guess.."
hcfactions,3bd0wb,Davidss10001,3,Sun Jun 28 03:33:10 2015 UTC,"Your kidding right?!!? The admin team is hardly on, except when they pop in a few times a day.

hcfactions,3bd0wb,TheStickWarrior,2,Sun Jun 28 03:57:33 2015 UTC,"Watchers are glorified chat mods and you know as, as does everyone.  When people say they need an admin in chat, it's usually because they need an admin to ban someone, watch them so they can ban someone, need dtr back, etc.  Not a watcher who can give their opinion on something."
hcfactions,3bd0wb,StabbdNtheTumy,2,Sun Jun 28 04:06:50 2015 UTC,whats even funnier is the fact that (at least last I knew) watchers don't even have the ability to move to private rooms in the ts. So how are they supposed to reach the admins any better than us messaging them
hcfactions,3bd0wb,TheStickWarrior,3,Sun Jun 28 04:43:02 2015 UTC,"It's the admin team's fault that the server is dying because there's nothing being done.

It takes a thick skin to take on our community.  I was available the whole time for palace and did not lower the time when first asked because it was earlier than we ever lowered it. After a couple more hours I lowered it. It has nothing to do with who can or can't do that.  For those that think the lack of players is only because they feel our admin team is unwelcoming, that's quite silly. Sure that might be the case for a choice few of our passionate players. But assuming a small team can offend that many players is silly. Others servers are new and hyped. Nothing wrong with wanting to try new things.   What are we going to do to fix the situation? We are actively brainstorming on just that."

I was a general and I had like 8000 custom games played, 4000 ranked games , 1000 normal games. I went on gamebattles and played a bunch of ""clan"" matches but it was usually me 1v6ing because all of my clan members were either colonels,commanders, or brigadiers. One of my favorite moments of playing halo 3 was playing on the map guardian and it was a custom game but there was around ~10 people on the other team while I was solo and I went like 25-1 or somewhere around there. Overall, Halo 3 was my all-time favorite game ever just so many things to do in customs i.e. duck hunt , and what not.  TL:DR: idc read it"
hcfactions,3bay6u,m0xyMC,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:53:13 2015 UTC,Halo 3 was my jam. The fact that the cross hair didn't bloom at all made it so much better. I think only reach was better.

hcfactions,3bay6u,Erectifyy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:52:25 2015 UTC,"Here is what I am saying. On the competitive level, Reach had more to offer. You payed for being inaccurate because of reticle bloom and the abilities gave another way to be strategic with your plays."

I went to Anaheim during the middle of the blops season and that was the first and last event I went to. When blops2 came around I was pretty much just a gb star because I got bored of the game. I sold my gb account when it was rank 249 for 600$. It's now banned but the guy dropped it all the way to 2000~ before it got banned lol

hcfactions,3bdsum,ImRainwater,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:01:00 2015 UTC,15 is like the average drinking age in Sweden. Don't know about the US but here in Europe a lot of people start drinking when they're 13-15 but I guess it depends on where you live. I live in the city so 13-15 is a normal age to get drunk on here but I can imagine the avg. age in the country side being higher.

They become so submissive to me, they do whatever I want. Just last night one chick said to me, ""I got chills. They're multiplying. And I'm losing control cause the power you're supplying. It's electrifying!"""

hcfactions,3axzdw,thehappypianoman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:35:02 2015 UTC,"We recently had a meeting where we brought up many ideas regarding the future of HCF.  I can't tell you much, but at some point there will be a post to inform the players.  I agree that there is literally no hype right now, but as we get more things finalized, we will definitely try to maintain a hype for the next map. Keep in mind we are still discussing many things, and it may be a little longer before anything really happens."
hcfactions,3axzdw,Gr33nfield,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:03:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you very much for the update :)"
hcfactions,3axzdw,dividuum,5,Thu Jul 2 08:22:06 2015 UTC,"Might as well copy and paste what I wrote on another thread as it pertains to this one as well.  I posited my views with LH8608 and might as well include em here.  The issues with the player activity on the server is quite clearly multi faceted and not easily surmised. It is most likely simply due to the popularity of the genre getting stale and people moving on.  I wish to argue this: If you want to cut this map short then fine. It makes sense as people are still between school and summer vacation. If we start the next map in the full swing of summer then people may be willing to stick around.  However, and this is my most important point (and quite possibly my only real one), the next map should be at the very least 6 weeks in length. AT MINIMUM.  The reason for this is that these short map cycles only really benefit the veterens who love pvp. It completely ignores the new people on the server (my beloved Newbs) who often are way too intimidated by the 1337 pvp players and wish to focus on just surviving and building a nice base.  If they know the map will end in a couple weeks then they have zero incentive to stick around. As such the vets decry the lack of players and they dont stick around.  This current map is kind of nice since many of the vets arn't around. I'm constantly getting a bunch of new players engaging and asking questions. Without the vets around to skewer them they actually have a chance to stay alive long enough to develop an interest in the server (with the exception of when Guava decided to murder 4 newbs in a masacre that is so grewsome I cannot get into details about....but for shame!).  While many of the older players may be getting tired of the genre. Minecraft will be here to stay for a very long time. Its simplicity is so great an appealing that a new younger crowd (like my 7 yo daughter) will be drawn to it.  We should appeal to these new people (maybe not 7yo but my daughter is pretty great at base bitching) and while not ignore the loud and vocal vets. Realize they are a vocal minority and shouldn't completely speak for the entirety of the servers player base.  Again not saying the vets should not be heard. There just needs to be a balance and the vets tend to only be interested in the first couple exciting weeks of a map and then want a fresh start. This is not good for new gamers."
hcfactions,3axzdw,BasedBaguette,2,Wed Jun 24 15:25:40 2015 UTC,"How long is the current map? My group of friends and I played HCF 2 years ago and had a blast building a huge elaborate base with traps, a self-sustaining farm, hidden vaults, a minecart rail system etc.  We're back in the server now and doing the same, but I think we all assumed the server would be up for 2-3 months like it was back then. If this current map is going to end soon we might jump ship since it won't be worth it (as we have a LOT planned and it will take a while, we also all have jobs now).  But yeah, thought I'd give my perspective, since I think it aligns with what you're saying. I'm legit worried now since you seem to be saying that this map is only going to be up for a few more weeks."
hcfactions,3axzdw,Gr33nfield,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:32:09 2015 UTC,"Hey way to completely backup what I was saying :). This, I imagine, is how many new players and casual players feel. If these guys dont have a reason to stick around then the vets will have nobody left to kill."

hcfactions,3axzdw,TheStickWarrior,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:29:51 2015 UTC,"I was only going to kill one but then they all came after me lol. I left like 10 signs saying sorry xD, I got my noob thirst out of the way for this map. If u need some materials I'll gladly give u some to make up for me killing ur noobs haha.  Also, the main reason (in my opinion) that hcf is dying is due to lack of exposure, and advertisement. For example I went on a factions server yesterday which is really badly made (it's laggy and there isn't anything special about it) however youtubers with 200k subs play on it so it is very popular. Hcf needs to add some incentives for youtubers to play on here and record, it would add a whole new player base."

hcfactions,3axzdw,cgoe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:09:10 2015 UTC,"Although I agree with a lot of the points made there, the map length shouldn't really matter too much.

People hated prot 4 maps because you had to grind out Unbreaking, Simple prot 4 sharp 5 should be fine.   Ok   yes, This span is shit, they need simple and open spawns that look good. if this spawn was not in a giant pit, and it was not all water I would say this is a great spawn."
hcfactions,3au6v1,ztask760,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:00:25 2015 UTC,This is a really good idea and I honestly think this would be a good map that would hopefully bring new and old players back to HCF
hcfactions,3au6v1,Matteojo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:00:05 2015 UTC,"I posited my views with LH8608 and might as well include em here.  The issues with the player activity on the server is quite clearly multi faceted and not easily surmised.  It is most likely simply due to the popularity of the genre getting stale and people moving on.  I wish to argue this: If you want to cut this map short then fine.  It makes sense as people are still between school and summer vacation.  If we start the next map in the full swing of summer then people may be willing to stick around.  However, and this is my most important point (and quite possibly my only real one), the next map should be at the very least 6 weeks in length.  AT MINIMUM.  The reason for this is that these short map cycles only really benefit the veterens who love pvp.  It completely ignores the new people on the server (my beloved Newbs) who often are way too intimidated by the 1337 pvp players and wish to focus on just surviving and building a nice base.  If they know the map will end in a couple weeks then they have zero incentive to stick around.  As such the vets decry the lack of players and they dont stick around.  This current map is kind of nice since many of the vets arn't around.  I'm constantly getting a bunch of new players engaging and asking questions.  Without the vets around to skewer them they actually have a chance to stay alive long enough to develop an interest in the server (with the exception of when Guava decided to murder 4 newbs in a masacre that is so grewsome I cannot get into details about....but for shame!).   While many of the older players may be getting tired of the genre.  Minecraft will be here to stay for a very long time.  Its simplicity is so great an appealing that a new younger crowd (like my 7 yo daughter) will be drawn to it.  We should appeal to these new people (maybe not 7yo but my daughter is pretty great at base bitching) and while not ignore the loud and vocal vets.  Realize they are a vocal minority and shouldn't completely speak for the entirety of the servers player base.    Again not saying the vets should not be heard.  There just needs to be a balance and the vets tend to only be interested in the first couple exciting weeks of a map and then want a fresh start.  This is not good for new gamers.  Edit  Forgot obligatory plug for NewbSanctuary...  If you are feeling lonely, tired, hungry and just plain beat up in this harsh unforgiving reality that is the end times......  THEN HAVE NO FEAR FOR GR33N IS HERE!  NewbSanctuary is here for all your basic needs.  We have food, melons, wart, and everything else to start up your faction.  Just come on by to X1200, Z 100 and we'll set you up nice and on your way!"

That may be the cause of your weight loss. Also, BMI doesn't calculate your muscle, which if I remember right, you wor out alot. BMI is a good place to start things, but don't always rely on it.

hcfactions,3ahkck,ieatpie2000,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:41:19 2015 UTC,"This isn't all that similar, but I've been having trouble with weight for a while too. It's not that I think eating less will improve my looks- I know I'm very skinny and it looks terrible- but I have trouble eating enough for some reason. I'm guessing (I know guessing with calories doesn't really count for much) that I usually eat under 1500 per day, and I'm 17/5'8/115lb. Sorry just hoping typing this out will help me in some way.  That sounds very stressful not being able to participate in activities [that it sounds like] you love.  You'll get through this! It's good you're taking time to work through a very difficult issue.

hcfactions,3ahkck,ImRainwater,2,Mon Jun 22 05:17:11 2015 UTC,Hey man I totally understand you. What I'm doing to eat more without hurting myself is this: I'm personally blessed to have really caring and loving parents who are willing to help me. So they've stepped up to dish my meals and snacks every time so it's ensured that I'm eating enough. I would also recommend drinking protein shakes and supplement drinks if you need to cram in those extra calories. Also visit /r/gainit for other advice. If it continues see a doctor.

hcfactions,3ahkck,Rob_1089,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:23:19 2015 UTC,It can't but for anorexia I think it could help because it's given to cancer patients during chemo to increase appetite so they will eat the normal amount.

hcfactions,3ag5po,Driftinator,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:22:51 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? You can turn the lever off to stop the potions from moving down the chain of brewing stands.  The best way I have found to use this brewer is add in a set amount of ingredients, say like 15 of each item into the brewing stands, then load in 45 water bottles (15 * 3) into the top chest. When it is all done you will have no leftover bottles or ingredients and it will be ready for the next batch of potions."

hcfactions,3a7hjk,Whos_Giddes,2,Thu Jun 18 07:26:49 2015 UTC,"So your definition of fun is not having to be cautious about what you do on a hardcore server lest someone kills you because you chose to act like a complete idiot and then decided to paint yourself as the victim when every action taken was warranted? Seems to me like you should head to /r/carebearfactions.  If anything, you are the scumbag. Not only did you trash-talk sixpool and failed to mention it in the ""backstory"", you went ahead and made it seem like he was the one who initiated the incident despite you guys being ""allied"". You are acting like a little kid over something as minor as that and then have the gall to claim that he is a scumbag who is ruining your fun. Everything he did to you was warranted.  Maybe if you didn't act like a bitch in the beginning, maybe, sixpool wouldn't have killed you. Maybe if you didn't challenge him to it, he wouldn't have killed you.   Its HCF, killing eachother is part of the game. You willingly chose to play the game knowing that the number 1 rule of HCF is to never trust anyone. That's like saying that someone is a scumbag for killing you while you played Call of Duty. It makes no sense. Why play HCF if killing others/getting killed isn't part of the fun? Or is it only okay for you to kill that noob? Do you think to that noob it was fun for him to die, if it wasn't for you? Not only are you acting like an entitled dipshit, but you are also being hypocritical. If it's part of the fun for you to kill that noob, then it is part of the fun for sixpool to kill you. What about all those guys you have ever killed on HCF? Is their fun not important either? Are you so important to everyone that we should not do anything against you so that you can experience your fun while others do not get the same treatment? Is that how we want to play? Or is it how you want to play? Because we obviously are going to cater to your feelings.  Tl;Dr: quit acting like an entitled prick"
hcfactions,3a7hjk,Whos_Giddes,0,Thu Jun 18 08:55:00 2015 UTC,The scumbag part refers to many past events combined with this one I am just showing another scumbag event that he did. Would you wait at spawn for half an hour to kill an ally just because he trashed you in ts? I wouldn't. Yes he was aloud to do what he did but he shouldn't have.   He used his position as watcher to let his faction glitch into my base without getting banned. I trashed him because he was complaining in shotbow ts that someone glitched into his base. Him being a Hypocrit like that pissed me off so I fell my trash talk is justified.   As for the treatment thing that noob was an irl friend of mine who came on to let me kill him. So I am not a Hypocrit.   You should get your facts straight before you start spouting shit kid.

hcfactions,3a55et,Gr33nfield,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:25:22 2015 UTC,Already on it ;)  However to say the server is dead I think is a stretch.  I think the server is currently underpopulated by the regular veterans who think it is dead.  With summer soon aproaching i've been noticing an influx of newbs who have never been on the server before.  With the vast ammount of veterans staying away I think this is a good opportunity for the new players to flourish instead of meeting a quick demise and giving up on the server.

hcfactions,3a1uk3,minecraftme123,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"I just remember when I played regular factions nobody every betrayed  us.  There was one solid reason, one we all used skype.  Second, the leader of the faction was um someone you didn't want to mess with.  He pretty much said he'd fuck anyone up who betrayed.  Nobody betrayed, it did work.  The guy wasn't bullshitting either as before I was in his faction my brother pissed him off (when my brother played also) and we got hit off for a while.  I'm not saying this is a recommended strategy, or one to brag about, but that is just one thing that really doesn't make me want to inside.  There are others, but being hit off is not a fun thing.  Just a little tale from my old times of regular factions xD.  Inb4 I get banned for sharing my little story.  Just remember, the amount of people in this game now that have booters, theres a lot.  Even if its a shitty one, they're so easy to access now that it isn't even funny.  So, I'd watch out in any faction, I mean this guy had his own net but thats something else."
hcfactions,3a1uk3,rkawesome,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:19:19 2015 UTC,"+1  Players these days don't get that betrayals were always on the back of our minds when we invited someone back in the old maps. It took people 5+ maps to regain trust if they betrayed. Hell, one of the server's most famous moments was the classic double betrayal by Pikaoku.  If betraying get banned, I will be severely disappointed. We aren't playing an SMP community server, this is hardcore factions.   Rule #1 of this server has always been don't trust anyone."
hcfactions,3a1uk3,tomo4864,2,Tue Jun 16 16:07:11 2015 UTC,+1 I remember if you even had a betrayal in your history it was very hard to find a faction. It literally scared people into not betraying because they didn't want to be factionless.

If someone new wants to start playing then there is no easy way for them to be able to do so if betraying is allowed. This means more people will be playing other ripoff  servers to hcf such as hcjhaltddosteams instead of HCF."

hcfactions,3a1cne,tomo4864,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:02:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, i would really recommend having backup stuff in protected chests and only give officer to people who you know won't betray.  Being in a successful faction relies alot on trust, every faction will have it's occasional betrayers.  Along with protected chests you also want to have a welcoming atmosphere in your faction.  I have found that this has a huge impact on people who may just betray otherwise.  If everyone feels like they are wanted and they are an important part of the faction they won't betray.  Overall it's all about trust ad if you are getting betrayed alot of time you just have to work through it and figure what the real problem in your faction is."

hcfactions,39yk1d,MXZHCF,2,Mon Jun 15 20:59:21 2015 UTC,Just get a sticky piston and pull it out of the wall. Not that difficult.
hcfactions,39yk1d,AlmostALawyer,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:53:24 2015 UTC,"If that works, it sounds like a bug. The road should be protected land and you shouldn't be able to pull stuff out of it. But it's worth a try I guess.  He might also use the diamond to create picks with huge ""diamond mined"" numbers ;-)"
hcfactions,39yk1d,dividuum,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:44:45 2015 UTC,It worked on diamonds in spawn not that long ago. I was able to pull diamonds 2 to 3 blocks deep in spawn out using multiple sticky pistons and using regular pistons to push redstone blocks in to activate the sticky pistons.
hcfactions,39yk1d,AlmostALawyer,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:08:02 2015 UTC,hrhr. Nice. You should be able to pull from up to 12 blocks deep then?
hcfactions,39yk1d,dividuum,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:32:58 2015 UTC,"Technically, but it would be quite time consuming, and it is only worth doing so if the vein is visible (either along the spawn wall or in a reachable cave). Also, you have to take account of the risks of someone discovering you through legitimate and illegal ways. But, you could always create safety pockets within spawn by just pulling blocks out, so that mitigates the risk."

hcfactions,39sa10,gizzletinks,3,Tue Jun 16 11:08:49 2015 UTC,Well said. Let's keep this as less cancerous as possible.
hcfactions,39sa10,Qazzy1122,2,Sun Jun 14 11:39:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the topic of going civcraft style and allowing radar should seriously be discussed. As hcf has said, they will never screenshare.   Without screensharing, its impossible to catch someone with radar that has any common sense apart from watching them for hours each day, which isnt feasible.  Allowing radar would level the playing field. It worked for civcraft, it can probably work for hcf."
hcfactions,39sa10,ImRainwater,2,Sun Jun 14 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"I have two things to add to that.   It's technically feasible although not quite so easy to have the server not send packets for players who are sneaking/invisible and behind a non-transparent block. The math has already been optimized for GPUs so if there were a GPU co-processor on board with with server they could use culling math to do this. But still that's not something you can just whip up real quick. Just something that could be done. ""its impossible to catch someone with radar that has any common sense"" True, but this is also true for screensharing. Anyone can keep multiple MC instances running, one with and one without radar. Once you're being inspected you could just delete the radar instance or hide it. Hell, you could have them screen-share into a VM if you wanted. All it takes is a little common sense. The idea that screensharing eliminates radaring is ridiculous. I'm sure it catches some rookies, but so does normal radaring when you're an idiot and get yourself caught in game."
hcfactions,39sa10,8noremac,2,Sun Jun 14 22:16:54 2015 UTC,I always get viruses when I screenshare with hackers how do i fix
hcfactions,39sa10,gizzletinks,2,Mon Jun 15 05:47:34 2015 UTC,"The only reason allowing radar on civcraft works is because the world is fucking giant, it's not focused on PVP, snitches, and the player render is honestly tiny so it barely helps you anyway."

hcfactions,39qmgm,teaearlgraycold,5,Sun Jun 14 15:12:47 2015 UTC,However we all know exactly how other factions find the end portal and their spawners every map :^)   So we need to cheat now I guess? Glad you're no longer in the faction.  Cheating doesn't make our faction any better. HCFactions isn't primarily about being the first to get an end portal or the first to get a base with a grinder or anything like that. XRaying/Radaring hurts the integrity of your faction more than anything else.  You said I betrayed the faction by helping provide proof against Lena. I'd say that the faction was already betrayed - by Lena and potentially others by their usage of cheats. I won't tolerate that kind of bullshit. Maybe other factions want to radar/xray to get an advantage. That's fine - that means in every koth/palace we cap without cheats we beat our opponent against the odds. I don't care about our faction winning everything all of the time. We should be here to have fun.

From my perspective I'm strongly against our faction cheating. So when I saw what looked very much like an XRay'd spawner and asked Lena if she had XRay'd she said she did to some extent. Because of this and you trying to appeal her ban I (and apppple I suppose) wanted to make sure the admins had all of the information we had."

hcfactions,39eu3f,tomo4864,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:02:02 2015 UTC,This is true.
hcfactions,39eu3f,Consuelo13,9,Thu Jun 11 16:12:11 2015 UTC,"The reason the server/minecraft in general is stale is because it is all about pvp now. People don't want to take the time to grind and have fun, they would rather be pvping. Even earlier Jerm, jeffrocks, jobre and I tried to have a fun ""fight night"" and consuelo showed up and just wanted to pvp. People don't know how to have fun in this game anymore besides pvping and it kind of sucks. Another reason hcf is failing is because it is too hardcore compared to other servers.. Some things aren't just given to you like they are elsewhere. This all leads to the main subject of people not willing to grind out the things they need so they just move to an easier server that claims to be hardcore. One of the most fun servers I ever played on was this server with a 20k by 20k map and a one month death ban. There were no factions. It was basically vanilla besides a nocheat plugin and a tpa plugin. This server was so enjoyable because dying was so risky. Minecraft will never be how it used to be and people just need to accept it and move on."
hcfactions,39eu3f,darksidedbeast,5,Thu Jun 11 07:17:40 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. It's so disappointing that so many people only log in to do koths or  palace. The trend to basically treat the server as ""kit map with factions"" started somewhere around map 18 I think. I'm not really sure why. Maybe one reason is that the admins get shit every time a decision related to that is made. I read this statement from an AAA developer a while ago and it summarizes the situation nicely.    What I also noticed is a real lack of new players. Since we basically have the same ""free food"" setup on one of the roads we expect to see the same number of players using it. This number has been going down dramatically also since after map 16 (I think). It doesn't look too good without new players and the old players leaving to easier/simpler servers. Maybe the server just needs more advertising. Some of the noobs always stick. I feel like this hasn't happened for a while now.   one month of death ban [...]   hcsmp? We played on that too. It was so scary. But both our two little bases got raided since players just x-rayed it. So we searched for a similar experience with the ability to protect the base and ended up here."
hcfactions,39eu3f,dividuum,2,Thu Jun 11 08:40:55 2015 UTC,Yea I think it was hcsmp. I played a few years back and I remember having a small island out in the middle of the ocean. One time some people attacked us by boat and we fought them off. It was fun times.

hcfactions,39eu3f,Gr33nfield,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:43:20 2015 UTC,That statement from the AAA developer is gold.  Having the strong vocal few chases away the quiet majority.  You need newbs to keep the server alive.  But when newbs come on and find a toxic clique type atmosphere they just move on.  I found enjoyment in being that newb and newb helper.  But now the maps are so short there is no reason for anybody to actually stick around and learn the map.  They find the map after a couple weeks in.  Ask how much longer it will last.  Find out its only a couple of weeks and they must move on.  So essentially the maps start up and tons of elites duke it out and then just wait till the maps reset and try at it again.  Slowly losing more and more elite players but gaining absolutely no newbs.
hcfactions,39eu3f,dividuum,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:19:42 2015 UTC,"That's it in a nutshell. And that the feeling of community got lost somehow. In earlier maps members of big factions were online even if there wasn't a koth running - to build, chat, and joke around. Now it's: log in for koth, ""Ez Ez Ez"" and log off. And if anything interesting happens certain members of the ""toxic elite"" verbally harass admins because they don't get their ""deserved win"". I don't think we're going to play in the future."

hcfactions,39eu3f,pherrera_,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:18:13 2015 UTC,This.  making hcf more hardcore wont bring back the majority at all and it will just make it less appealing and they will just stick to the other servers where they can pvp. Yeah a lot of people like the risk and actually being scared to die but in the long run people want the easier and less hard way
hcfactions,39eu3f,jjtt311,2,Fri Jun 12 03:40:29 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer! The grind is too numbing to be rewarding and other servers sure have made it easier to acquire items.

We were so scared to lose sets, or die even. I honestly miss being scared to walk outside of my base, and I play hcf because it's harder than the other servers.  Heres what I think, make the server as fucking hardcore as you want, which would make it more fun for those of us who have played HCF for a while, honestly I would play an extremely hardcore server even if there were 50 on a day  However I doubt there would be 50 on a day, considering on other servers I see people begging for them to make the server more hardcore."

HCF back then was much more appealing because there wasn't any other server like it, what other servers had kits,spawncannons, and koths? Answer:NONE Minecraft is slowly dying and being invaded by h4ckers/ch3aters and people that use tweaks like regedit and what not which just make everything stale. IMO, This is why I think HCF is dying.  edit: sorry for spelling errors or any missing parts im on my phone and don't want to spend too much time on this since everyone knows the main idea"

hcfactions,39eu3f,GoldenYawkie,4,Thu Jun 11 16:25:15 2015 UTC,"Alright.  People aren't not playing hcf because its 'not hardcore enough'. They're not playing it because they've moved on, HCF does not have an influx of new players like other servers with youtubers to back them up. HCF only has the shotbow network and even then it hardly brings it that many people. The actual factions who wish to play see there is 20 people online and they think 'fuck that ill go play somewhere else where my efforts will be seen and I can get more action'.  People play to pvp now as well. They go sweat out practice servers and try climb the hierarchy of factions whilst creating youtube channels to be noticed by people. Whether this means they have to trigger or not isn't relevant to them. People play hctms and cohee because the server has dedicated players who will continue to play every map, hcf doesn't have those players anymore. They've moved on from minecraft or maybe they've just moved to another server after all the chances they gave HCf. Lots of people have personal issues with the staff team as well, I know a lot of people who have left for that reason."

hcfactions,39eu3f,Kempje,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:11:24 2015 UTC,If we could have a no enchant map and somehow revert it back to double sprinting no toggle sprint it would make you have to have skill to PvP again. It also  would make it hardcore for the people wanting that.
hcfactions,39eu3f,Eythx,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:26:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's very easy to use the admins as a scapegoat for the lack of activity on HCF, but the fact of the matter is that a ""perfect"" staff team could never bring activity along with it.  (I have no problem with the current staff team, and believe that they will get shit for doing exactly what the community wants)  Along the same lines, the few flaws in HCF are not what is causing the influx of players to other servers and out of HCF.    Now I didn't join incredibly early on (started map 14), but when I did join HCF was still very popular.  For anyone who cares, here's my two cents:  I completely agree that the various other servers which have popped up offering essentially the same experience, but in some cases easier and in most cases more popular, is what has pulled the life out of HCF.  The best way to combat this is to bring new and old players alike onto HCF.  In my opinion, advertisement is the key.  Whether that be advertising to the Shotbow community who doesn't currently play HCF or advertising to the Minecraft community as a whole, more players can revive this server.  Also, those of us who know people who used to play HCF or may be interested can and should ask their friends to come and play.  Another huge problem is the lack of risk in dying in that whenever a player dies on HCF, they can just go and play on another server.  The best way to solve this is to make HCF unique in as many ways possible.  I'm not the one with those ideas, but maybe we can get the ball rolling.  Sorta became a rant, sorry about that :D"
hcfactions,39eu3f,kllr_bee,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:45:48 2015 UTC,"The real reason for all of this? The average age of the ""hardcore"" player has dropped.  There's nothing you can really do at this point, the community is completely full of much younger players than it used to be.   This isn't necessarily bad, but it does mean that the way the community works and the way servers are run won't be the same again."

hcfactions,39eu3f,TheStickWarrior,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:30:09 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate admitting it, the only real reason why HCF as a game mode isn't what it used to be, is because the people who played and enjoyed the days of the real ""hardcore"" HCF, are all moving on with their lives now.   These new HCF servers are only catering to their player base through community suggestions and what the community wants. As HCF became popular, the community grew, until it was apparent that new servers had to be made to accompany all these new people who wanted to play an HCF server.  If you think about it, HCF is simply a spin-off of a normal factions server, utilizing aspects of the game to make it feel ""hardcore,"" and people loved it at the time. These new HCF servers in turn, are spin-off of HCF itself, again changing aspects to cater to their playerbase, having more pvp, practice servers and whatnot.  What i'm trying to say is, things change, this game is always evolving whether you choose to believe it or not. A few years ago, I bought this game to casually play singleplayer, and play on private worlds with friends. Never would I have imagined that a game like this, played as a building and survival game, would ever turn into a competition for becoming the best pixel boxer. This game has evolved in so many ways for me, just as HCF will continue to evolve and change as well, for better or for worse."

Thank you for voicing your opinions on the forums and on reddit, if you didn't voice your opinions we would have allowed it and gotten flack from it.  Also spammed all posts so this can be seen."
hcfactions,39d7yb,mymmeykos,3,Thu Jun 11 01:36:28 2015 UTC,So childish. Get Symotic to stepdown instead of trying to blackmail the HCF team lmao.
hcfactions,39d7yb,CrackerJack7209,0,Thu Jun 11 00:51:50 2015 UTC,"no, it's a post for admins to be able to moderate the server and play the game, not step down, which quite frankly is a load of shit and shouldn't be allowed"
hcfactions,39d7yb,Johnzeh,-4,Thu Jun 11 06:41:51 2015 UTC,"This poll is for admins being able to play if they wish. My comment explains my point. The only admin who has taken any interest in playing is Symotic. At this point down the line, I'm not interested in making another faction unless Symotic, Bruno, and Billahh are there. No exceptions. If Symotic can't play, we're all not playing."
hcfactions,39d7yb,DatAsiimov,4,Thu Jun 11 01:38:31 2015 UTC,So... why doesn't Symotic step down? Even for just the map
hcfactions,39d7yb,Johnzeh,-4,Thu Jun 11 02:00:19 2015 UTC,"Because he's good. If our faction is having any problems we wait for either Symotic or Laura to get on because the last time we tried getting help from ABU he told me our factions just shit when we died to getting invalid pearls on the roof of the road. This poll is just everybody assuming Czonair and Davids are coming into the game when I honestly do not know who would pick them up. This poll is pretty much about Symotic and as I said, if he can't play our whole 30-man roster isn't going to. I like to have fun, as it stands right now my faction gets allied against every fight because people assume we're ch3ating with regedit or autoclicking. If I can't have the people who make my faction fun then I don't want to take part in playing here. It's not like HCF's the only server anymore."
hcfactions,39d7yb,BALLSTOYOUSIR,6,Thu Jun 11 21:25:56 2015 UTC,I like to have fun  Refuses to play if admins don't give him what he wants   Seems like it
hcfactions,39d7yb,Johnzeh,-5,Thu Jun 11 01:42:53 2015 UTC,How does that not make sense? If we can't have the roster we want on this server we'll just go do something else. Why stress myself out trying to build a roster full of people I don't know/like?
hcfactions,39d7yb,BALLSTOYOUSIR,3,Thu Jun 11 16:16:46 2015 UTC,"Then go do that, if you're willing to quit over something as small as not having 1 person out of your 30 man roster it's not like you care about the server in the first place."
hcfactions,39d7yb,TheStickWarrior,3,Thu Jun 11 02:32:44 2015 UTC,"We're talking about one person here, symotic, not your entire faction"

hcfactions,39d7yb,DatAsiimov,3,Thu Jun 11 04:00:39 2015 UTC,"Why stress myself out trying to build a roster full of people I don't know/like?   Say you build the entire Rebellion roster and then take out Sym. Say in this hypothetical situation, you guys don't mind not having Sym. You get 1 missing Rebellion member, not ""an entire faction of guys I don't know"".   That's what he meant.  I believe that the only compromise is having Sym step down as admin to play as a player. The prospect of having him abuse for you guys or having a bias towards you guys in any issue involving cheating or anything of the sort is far too important to allow him to play and have a say in the server's running. Not to say he will do it for sure, just the fact it's possible."
hcfactions,39d7yb,TheStickWarrior,3,Thu Jun 11 04:13:03 2015 UTC,"why stress myself out trying to build a roster full of people I don't know/like  symotic = no rebellion. No rebellion = no johnzeh, brunotheminer, billah + chinchin's active member   these contradict each other. If you don't have symotic you would only have to fill 1 spot, based on the first sentence"
hcfactions,39d7yb,chaseair11,3,Thu Jun 11 04:30:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, with that attitude.. That's not really what is needed on the server"
hcfactions,39d7yb,TheStickWarrior,3,Thu Jun 11 04:33:28 2015 UTC,"Its a double edged sword. If admins are allowed, you guys will play and we'll have another power faction. But other factions that are against having admins play may quit. So we'd gain one to lose one. So if symotic is allowed to play, and your faction is having any sort of problems. Are you going to go straight to sym? I believe you should have to get another admins opinion or it may be biased."
hcfactions,39d7yb,Johnzeh,-4,Thu Jun 11 04:37:36 2015 UTC,"I've already said what I need to say, if we don't get to make the 'Rebellion' roster we have no reason to play."
hcfactions,39d7yb,DatAsiimov,3,Thu Jun 11 04:44:00 2015 UTC,You guys aren't the only players though. Threatening to not play probably doesn't faze the admin team when the potential of having more people quitting is on the table.
hcfactions,39d7yb,Johnzeh,-3,Thu Jun 11 04:55:03 2015 UTC,"lmao kk, like I said, we're doing what we're doing."
hcfactions,39d7yb,DatAsiimov,3,Thu Jun 11 04:57:52 2015 UTC,so why doesn't he step down?   because he's good    That doesn't really answer the question
hcfactions,39d7yb,CrackerJack7209,3,Thu Jun 11 05:07:56 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with an admin stepping down for a map or whatever to play, but not actively playing w/ a faction and the staff team."

What had happened there has no tie to the fact i was an admin.   The same thing would've happened if i was a player. Though, you wouldnt be bringing it up now to try to stop other staff members by playing.  The issue at hand is if there is a concern of a possible abuse of power.

hcfactions,39d7yb,tomo4864,2,Thu Jun 11 15:36:07 2015 UTC,"Im sure fastghastblast would be able to fill you in more. As far as I know zpapz was on his player account (I believe that was who it was) and let his faction block glitch to kill fastghast's members who were in a saferoom. He sat there and watched them do it, and im not 100% certain but I believe he gave them then green light to do it."
hcfactions,39d7yb,StabbdNtheTumy,2,Thu Jun 11 01:40:44 2015 UTC,It wasn't block glitching it was a minecraft vanilla exploit to where you could shoot his hitbox from the corner of the saferoom. However hcf staff don't know what they're doing so banned us.
hcfactions,39d7yb,ZPapz96,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:03:10 2015 UTC,"No they demoted zpapz because he block glitched jasz to stop his /logout time, which then made it so you could arch him legitimately."

And what you did resulted in jasz's death and our fac going raidable, so it wasn't a wrong punishment on you"
hcfactions,39d7yb,lh8608,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:12:03 2015 UTC,I don't see why you had to play prosecutor for an hour. I had been completely transparent with what had happened then. Im not denying that i shouldnt have been banned.

hcfactions,39d7yb,TheSixPool,0,Thu Jun 11 02:06:43 2015 UTC,"You speak as if you were there at the moment. No ""green light"" was given by me. My faction members saw the opportunity to make them raidable and took it. They didnt care if they got banned for it. Some of them even did get banned, including me.  The question at hand is if admins could play. What had happened with me wasnt an abuse of my admin powers. I didnt give unfair info to my faction. I broke a rule that wasnt clear to me. A mistake that any player could've made."
hcfactions,39d7yb,ZPapz96,0,Thu Jun 11 02:48:22 2015 UTC,"Which he could've done on his admin account as well. That isn't abusing, that's just poor judgement. What these guys are complaining about is something different."
hcfactions,39d7yb,zanotam,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:54:37 2015 UTC,Which is why im trying to stress the fact that what had happened with me shouldnt be held against other admins because it wasnt even something that has to do with me being an admin.
hcfactions,39d7yb,TheSixPool,2,Thu Jun 11 03:45:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes it was. I mean, ffs, my original banning was because I was bringing up the cases of admin aboose outside of the map 5 fiasco with Travis and he didn't want people to know about all the additional cases of abuse that he personally had done (let alone the questionable actions and cases of other admins that had happened between map 4 and map... 11ish)."
hcfactions,39d7yb,zanotam,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:31:09 2015 UTC,"Not with this staff team. Yes it was abused in the past, but not with this current staff team. We can't out people that haven't given us a reason to."

I feel like this could be a very unique addition to hcf. ""I like to raid, and if it helps raiding then lets do it"" - Stabbd. It would also add more strategy to the game, as you would have to build a base that has traps (if you don't want to go outside and actually fight).    Highly abuse-able   I don't know how it would be abuse-able, it would just increase factions fight factions on ones land, and not at place/koth.    I feel if we were to add this we would get nothing but flack about it.   So are we just not going to add anything any more, because no matter what your going to upset someone."
hcfactions,392z1p,TheStickWarrior,3,Tue Jun 9 03:33:43 2015 UTC,What about an expensive bard effect that you can only buy from spawn. The item wouldn't be stackable. I don't know if this is possible but the effect wouldn't go away until the enemy is say 30ish blocks away from the portals. So if the faction being camped wanted to use their portals they would have to drive them away. The bard affect shouldn't have a cool down in my opinion. This is because if the item isn't stackable then it would take up more room for pots. Just my 2 cents

hcfactions,392z1p,FPSHater,2,Mon Jun 8 22:36:11 2015 UTC,The bard would have to be 30ish blocks away from the portal. So they would have to go out and kill it or drive it away. But yes the bard could log off and log back on and the effect would be gone.

Yes my day was that shit that a small thing like the re-uploads of his videos made my day alittle bit better. But then I look at the comments only to see your reddit tag. I didn't look at the flair to see who it really was. But now that I'm getting shit from my faction, my parents, my friends which I don't know if I even have anymore, and from people that don't know me.

hcfactions,38qnqk,Davidss10001,2,Sat Jun 6 00:19:47 2015 UTC,"I was one of the first admins of Kohi, which tried to work off of the flaws of Shotbow and the HCF staff at that time. I would like to just elaborate on the issues of the previous admin team and how it differs from the current admin team.  I think that anyone who played during the time of akalen and Travis would agree that they had no business being in a position of authority. They had their own agenda, and it clearly showed. I saw their personal opinion of me affect their decisions in bans related to cheating, which is a very serious offense. They ensured that my bans remained active, despite my very strong counter claim and evidence to support that. In fact, Travis once extended my ban 14 days after watching one of my documented videos, claiming that I was using hacks that were not visible in the GUI. This is the video in question. I'll let you decide if I was cheating or not. Keep in mind, he claimed I was togglesprinting and rebinding F5. Even if I had rebinded F5, if it was not a offense that could warrant a ban. I cited the rules to him several times.  With that being said, they did enforce the rules, but did so in an immature and corrupt manner. I guarantee that if you write clear and concise rules, and enforce them, you will attract a mature player base. These are the players you want, because you can trust that they will give feedback that will genuinely help the server. This is something that HCF did successfully, but from what I witnessed, they were driven away by off-putting staff.  What the admin team needs to do is take a second look at the rules. Judge what rules you want to keep, remove, or modify to ensure that players will have amiable interactions. The competitiveness in games will naturally bring trash talk, but the line needs to be drawn somewhere. Make this clear and enforce the rules. Some rules will need to be enforced programmatically to substitute in the case of a lack of admins.  Lastly, the current admin team is hundreds time better at communicating with the community from when I last played, but changes do need to be made to revive the server. There are more points that I could elaborate on, but I believe to be out of the scope of this post. If you would like me to expand on this more, PM me."

And on a non-chat related note, you guys need to start doing screenchecks like your competitors because cheating on this server is getting absolutely rediculous."

Shotbow would need to downgrade as well, and I don't see that happening at all, so we would need to have a direct server IP and disable /hub. After a while Minecraft servers stop supporting certain versions, if 1.5 hasn't already been dropped from that we are very close to it."

It's a lot more than just changing the numbers on the server. We have code made specifically for 1.7 that was 1.8 that we downgraded.   With code changes comes bugs, and there will be a lot, and we will get complaints from everyone.   And besides, if we were to downgrade, Kohi and HCT would still have more players because no one wants to downgrade to play a server, just like they didn't want to upgrade to play a server.

If used correctly, you could easily fight outnumbered fights or use it strategically to kite or trap people. Knockback II was very balanced while dualswording in my opinion and if you didn't play carefully enough and watch your step it could easily stab you in the back and get you knocked to your death. Example Knockback II also allowed people to knock without the clusterfuck we have now when someone tries to knock something. I'll touch on this more later. In my opinion, knockback II should be allowed but not knockback I because it seemed very unreliable. Dualswording is a valid tactic in my opinion.   pls 4 knockback 2  Dual wielding truly brought another level to pvp, and that's something this server needs."

Really sad the melon blocks all got changed though :(   A lot of your description of why you liked map 12 though sounds similar to the reasons why I personally liked map 8 (although, let's face it, rogue was bullshit then and the experimental kit was a wee bit too tanky), but it comes down to the interactions between players with high skill ceiling and a focus on 'good fites' without too much of a worry about consequences, much lower risk than the current factions implementation (okay, not actually true as the numbers are borked and small factions are literally safer than they've ever been).  And contrary to what you claim, there is, at least to a certain extent, a way that the admins can fix the community. The game influences how people interact and the factions system itself is a huge part of that. I do agree with you though that the ideal state is one in which there's an 'endgame fantasy' to be achieve by players where they can basically just fight as much as they want (except for deathbans, which should be partially avoidable in event zones) and not give a shit about going raidable because they are now focused on the social and meta gaming aspects: winning Palaces, KotHs, and other events; dealing with betrayal, trust, morale, and intrafaction drama; and then the bit where a serious 'power faction' needs to be actually putting in the effort to keep a stable faction capable of competing at the top level with PvPers, miners, base bitches, and"

hcfactions,38ekj3,TheStickWarrior,2,Thu Jun 4 00:39:32 2015 UTC,"I could see this being a problem back in the old days. But the way people are now, they only camp factions that are smaller or have the numbers on them. I remember back map 12, power factions would camp other power factions. Now a days that doesn't really happen, unless the faction being camped is like 1 dtr. Power factions don't camp other power factions because theyre afraid to lose a fair fight. Archer towers help out these smaller factions by driving away enemies. It certainly shouldn't be a 1 hit kill, but maybe a 2 hit kill and theyre dead. Kind of like how it is when your on the ground."
hcfactions,38ekj3,zanotam,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:25:40 2015 UTC,"I could see this being a problem back in the old days. But the way people are now, they only camp factions that are smaller or have the numbers on them.   That's actually the reason why pure vertical damage was originally removed from archer. You'd show up to one of the two factions possibly worth raiding and someone from another faction would start dropping arrows from max y level and one-shotting people. The major factions spent pretty much all their time fighting at KotH's (no deathban and a different dtr system meant that people would go to a KotH to fight even when it wasn't up sometimes). Big factions though had the area cleared around their base most of the time and archer towers set-up so they could always defend themselves, but such things were mostly deterrents against concentrated assaults/camping by other power factions."
hcfactions,38ekj3,darksidedbeast,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:59:56 2015 UTC,The poison idea is way to op... 15 seconds of poison 3 will get you to half a heart in a couple seconds.

hcfactions,38ekj3,IkeForPresident,0,Wed Jun 3 21:50:00 2015 UTC,Never mess with archer to an extent where it doesn't rely on range to increase damage that is how it is and should stay forever. Only thing that should be changed is the damage numbers for each range I think now it's good caped at 5 hearts but it shouldn't do that until 65 blocks with the max power bow and it should do 0 hearts from less then 15 blocks.

The dyed armoir is great though. How red armour could be like the Minez heal bow, light blue for speed, green for poison, orange for fire resistance, magenta for strength, brown for slowness, dark blue for weakness.

hcfactions,38c4rv,Derwent99,10,Wed Jun 3 07:05:22 2015 UTC,"Legit, ending the map on friday is the BIGGEST joke since TravisArmstrong  Not only is having a 3 week map an absolute joke and waste of time for everyone who has played so far but its also a giant kick in the nuts to everyone who is playing or has things going.   One of the reasons HCF is ""Dead"" right now is finals and graduation for NA. AU has some aswell. I think EU does also. Give it 2 weeks and people will be up again.  3 weeks for a map is literally no time to do anything and is a massive joke. Its embarassing for the server and the amdin team if they end it on friday and I can guarantee they will lose players because of it"

hcfactions,38bvpc,Bubbanator63,3,Wed Jun 3 15:38:39 2015 UTC,Hello my name is Bubbanator I have fought for long time and I have clicked with the absoluter best this community has to offer. I also like to grow food and place stone all over and make torch and light up this great mine craft universe we live.  Let me tell you a little about myself. Since I was 13 I have always wanted to be be a fighter like in the old England days but since I am not born back then I have to settle with the best simulation of combat this gaming generation has to offer. I like mine craft pvp because you can not die just because you get stabbed which I like because I am like one hundred percent sure I could take a stab to the chest anyday anyways if you feel bad in mine craft pvp you just throw a pot down and you feel better no to mention the ability to drink a blue pot and run quick with solid diamond armor which honestly I like because I could run fast if I wanted to and the blue pot really unlocks my potential. Ok anyways since map 8 I was in small factions like hashbrown where a couple of guys could have fun and hang out and mine and click and stuff. Wow what an opportunity arose when I joined Apache blitz faction and oh boy it was great so many people that I have seen in big videos are now close to me and they can't click me. After that I followed those buds around but eventually hcfactions slowed down and pretty much zero people came on so I moved onto other games but a fire inside of me as bright and hot as the sun has arisen and since Apache can't click anymore I have to take his place so please accept me so that I can fulfill my destiny to be the best clicker please don't ask me to rate myself on your stupid scale there are so many aspects to pvp that you can't put them in one empanada.  Thanks for reading pleas accwpeterino

hcfactions,38auh1,opterionianiaco,2,Wed Jun 3 01:23:26 2015 UTC,Hell's kitchen is a real neighbourhood in New York that's used in a tonne of different media because it was a lower class area with a lot of crime and a sweet name. That doesn't stop it from being a reference to whatever you know it from though.   But Zuergner would never reference a Marvel comic. Batman or bust.

hcfactions,38b5un,lh8608,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:41:55 2015 UTC,I was asked multiple times about EOTW. I promised a poll on the 3rd week and thought with all the situations that came up the majority might want a fresh map with factions built around their friendships.   We will definitely take into consideration if the poll remains as close as it is. I will also be looking into the play time of those voting.
hcfactions,38b5un,ThatRangaKid,6,Wed Jun 3 14:54:54 2015 UTC,I think its time to re evaluate the method in which you poll issues.  perhaps think about better wording with potentially multiple polls in order to achieve and accurate and more realistic vote

These three week maps won't happen on a regular basis.

Or even something like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/hcfactions/comments/1jkvb9/visualizing_faction_rivalry/  Sharing code is nice, so I just uploaded my overviewer crawler. You can use it to download map files from any overviewer powered map and create images for a given coordinate and zoom level: https://gist.github.com/dividuum/2ee993f037c9e0cb3376  You can use that to (for example) build something like we did on a few maps: https://www.reddit.com/r/hcfactions/comments/20hprn/map16_base_animations/"

I hope you still browse the reddit on your phone and message us every now and than, and even pop in game.   Hang in Kirby, I can't wait to see you again because I know everything is going to go great as long as you push through. Sorry I'm late and all, but better late than never.

hcfactions,37mnxn,Win546,7,Thu May 28 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"A little too nerfed. 55 blocks does 3 1/2 hearts when it should be doing a little more. I say make it so you can 2 shot someone (with full health) from 60-65 blocks away (60 blocks = 5 hearts)  Edit: Also there shouldn't be a max damage of 5 hearts, that's ridiculous. Make it at LEAST 7.5 hearts but have that only possible to hit from 75-80 blocks away (trust me as someone who has been playing archer since map 9, that's not an easy shot by any means)."
hcfactions,37mnxn,realMK325,3,Thu May 28 23:01:02 2015 UTC,No more bow spamming.   qq
hcfactions,37mnxn,SoliiD_StriiK,2,Thu May 28 22:25:51 2015 UTC,"The main issue everyone complains about is when archer can shoot into cap zones at koths/palace. Why not apply this nerf to those areas virtually making archer useless at KOTHs however everywhere else in the world it stays as it was. Otherwise if I am to hit a 100 block shot out of my render with a general gist of where the opponent is I deserve that kill, not a piddly 5 hearts. Thoughts??"
hcfactions,37mnxn,IkeForPresident,2,Thu May 28 21:51:40 2015 UTC,I think this is ok but. It could be better cap damage at 8 hearts from 100 blocks it should do 1 heart until 35 blocks. from 60 blocks it should do 3 hearts Then at 80 blocks it should do 6 hearts. That way it reward players from further distances and means that if an archer gets a ez kill it's not ez because they have made a godlike shot.
hcfactions,37mnxn,vexx31,2,Thu May 28 22:17:50 2015 UTC,"holy shit archer is actually so ass right now I refuse to play it and some factions feel it isnt worth the risk to bring a squishy class for ass damage. People that keep crying just don't know how to play the game OR have never played archer. Archer is a class that requires more skill than just pew pew kill, you have to know where you are positioning and be wary of everyone in a team fight.  It should do a lot of damage but be a squishy class like it was. You just have to find a middle-ground. Archer should do stacking damage every hit but this should still be implemented in a way that it doesn't encourage bow-spamming, and it needs to do more damage than it currently does. NOBODY IS FORCING YOU TO BRING A ROGUE, IT IS JUST A COUNTER TO THE CLASS. DIAMOND CLASSES CAN KILL ARCHERS TOO.  Just my biased opinion as a former archer main who is now nearly forced to play diamond class if I want to have fun or kill something eventually."

IF you're not paying attention, someone could dig a giant hole outside of your faction's base and everyone could run into it. Should all traps not on your own faction's land be banned then?"
hcfactions,37jmj2,zanotam,1 point,Thu May 28 03:38:15 2015 UTC,"For once im agreeing with you. Nether portal traps should be legal as long as you can get out of the actual portal.

hcfactions,37e4bj,zanotam,1 point,Wed May 27 01:30:18 2015 UTC,"I am always open to changing the potion/kits around. We have a lot of options. (Though I think it should roll with new maps)  Same goes for opples. Throw a poll up!  I've been keeping a close eye on the DTR over the last couple days. As of right now once regenerating you will gain one power per online faction member. It's roughly 430 max power and most drop to the 250-350's with average game play. So, with that technically a 35man faction can gain power very quickly with 35 points every 5mins. Now I know that is only best case scenario. Let's give it another day with that in mind. I definitely want to encourage factions to pull offline members to participate but also don't want to hurt smaller factions or those with a lot of inactive players.  Please give me feed back tomorrow night. I'll adjust if necessary. :)   Thanks, guys!"

Besides, it seems clear to me that the rest of you are equally salty because your comments were directed towards me in a hateful and rage-like manner (excluding a few)."
hcfactions,3761vi,opterionianiaco,1 point,Tue May 26 05:42:46 2015 UTC,"Plenty of worse things get said all the time both on the server and the subreddit, that's irrelevant. You didn't just ""say things how they were"", you sarcastically insulted people and their playstyle in a joke thread. What you said wasn't that bad but there's actual anger/hate/malace to your words. In response to a joke thread.    the rest of you are equally salty because your comments were directed towards me in a hateful and rage-like manner   Salt begets salt. You can't come into a friendly thread with a comment as salty as yours and then complain when people are salty in response."
hcfactions,3761vi,TTSWumboMZ,0,Tue May 26 19:40:28 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly too lazy to find where i ""complained"" about people being salty, but i'd love for you to point it out to me because i dont ever remember complaining about it. Also, i dont know this person ""jerm"" therefore there is no way for me to know whether this is banter or the complete opposite. I responded with said ""Hate/Malace"" because of what i thought he intended. Put yourself in my shoes and give me the benefit of the doubt. I just got raided because my faction was dumb and i see a reddit post saying that it was a bad idea to join my faction and that players in my faction would've been better off in another faction. I defended what happened to make us not seem like the ""noob"" in this situation. Im not encouraging trashtalk as much as i do enjoy it, i simply felt it needed to be done because of what i thought he was implying with that message."
hcfactions,3761vi,opterionianiaco,1 point,Wed May 27 03:21:09 2015 UTC,"Really? I quoted the part I thought you were complaining in the previous comment. It's already been pointed out. You don't have to not be lazy, just need to read all 6 sentences of my previous comment.   I think you completely misinterpreted the original post. Reread it. Not knowing Jerm doesn't excuse your overreaction or huge misinterpretation. Jerm never said it was a bad idea to join your faction or that you would have been better elsewhere. He never implied anyone was bad or inferior. You're defending yourself when no one is attacking you. Even if he was, it's ok to be the noob in some situations (like going raidable to a falltrap), you don't need to defend yourself all the time. When someone bests you just say gg and go next.   Jerm was saying he got revenge on Bobo. That's it.   Chill broseph. Don't hate, appreciate."
hcfactions,3761vi,Axle3_piehunter,0,Wed May 27 03:47:03 2015 UTC,"Words are very unique in the fact that they can be arranged and rearranged and mean different things to everyone.   I took that post one way being in the mind set of someone who had just gotten raided and that does not make it an overreaction especially considering i didn't say anything too terrible to him. While it may not seem like an attack to you, it did to me and the meaning of words is purely opinionated, like analyzing the meaning of a poem. I will admit that i do not like to admit defeat though.   Also, the part when i said ""the rest of you are equally salty because your comments were directed towards me in a hateful and rage-like manner"" was not a complaint, i was merely pointing out that if i was salty, everyone else was too. Dont take me the wrong way either, i dont like these people to see me out as a bad person but i dont care either. I simply enjoy the defending of what i believe is right until you can somehow fully prove that i did wrong. I love the prospect of a dispute or debate where i use my mind more than mindless trashtalk. Why do you think i didn't say something along the lines of ""fuk u lol, ur bad""?"
hcfactions,3761vi,Ysbra,1 point,Wed May 27 04:22:34 2015 UTC,"Jerm is a wordsmith and a poet, but this is not one of his texts that need deciphering. The meaning of words is not purely opinionated. There can be more than one meaning, but they usually they mean something specific. Thinking the original post was an attack is a huge misinterpretation, this was the first thing you did wrong.   I misinterpreted your observation about others being salty as a complaint. I was wrong.   On a scale from ""Dispute or debate where I use my mind more than mindless trashtalk "" to ""fuk u lol, ur bad"", your original comment was much closer to the later. This was the second thing you did wrong. You aren't even defending yourself, you're attacking their playstyle and insulting them. You're also sarcastic and condescending, which got you downvoted because it makes you appear extremely salty.   This second wrong thing you did was done because of the first wrong misinterpretation you had.    Dont take me the wrong way either, i dont like these people to see me out as a bad person but i dont care either  i see he got the squad to come on reddit LOL    Jerm doesn't downvote brigade.

hcfactions,373a92,tennisruler11,3,Sun May 24 13:51:17 2015 UTC,I got you.   First cap attempt was desolate. They held it until 30 seconds.  And like 5 factions went to knock. They went raidable but admins refunded dtr because it was supposed to be .5 dtr loss but they hadn't implemented it. After that nothing really happened for a while. Desolate started capping again but powerrangers knocked and went raidable. MeowMix had a cap attempt and they got it down pretty low but Ohana knocked. Putting both factions on 2 dtr and out for a while. Either desolate or kabum started capping. One or the other knocked and desolate Ended up going raidable (for real this time). KaBuM had a couple of cap attempts but desolate knocked them (yes while raidable) Desolate kept on using lives and regeared to harass any faction that was capping. Then eventually elite wiped out desolate. LawyerDucks had a cap attempt and elite knocked and made them raidable.  Basically every faction was low dtr besides MeowMix. MeowMix started capping and 5 of KaBuM tried knocking but failed so MeowMix capped
hcfactions,373a92,Evilpie2,2,Sun May 24 14:14:57 2015 UTC,^ pretty much all of it.  Deso's pretty smart tbh (if that's how you describe it).. if they hadn't kept fighting we woulda capped right there.

For unanswered appeals, i have no explanation for that."

hcfactions,371579,celooooxia,-9,Sun May 24 17:13:35 2015 UTC,"yes i betrayed you that's what thats called  What actually happened is I died the first time because they all bailed a fight and as we were going back to base I got knocked into a grief hole, and they all refused to help and just watched 10 blocks away, despite us outnumbering them. After I died, they mustered the courage to jump in and kill one of the people and make the rest run. Their fault I died.   Second time I was 1v1ing around our base and got glitched/hit INTO a block and couldn't move. My fault.   Last I went to palace because they had no plans to this time, and we were at 3 DTR. I was chilling with Desolate and then the great 200 v 30 happened, where we all died in glory. Didn't even drop your DTR due to half loss.   You had no plans to do anything and were going to base bitch all evening anyway. Don't bitch about how you were going to go to palace, and don't make it seem like I made you raidable."

You never said don't go outside because you were part of the group fighting five minutes earlier. You ran inside, said you'll be back, and logged. The rest of us continued fighting. Hell, you wanted to go to End with five people. You would've gotten dropped.    2nd death: You died as we were regenning DTR when I had made it clear to everyone not to leave the base, once again you didn't listen.   As I already said, I own this one and it's my fault.    Except you had been in TS with us for the past half hour discussing our plans for palace and how we planned to go once DTR regen'd, and your death was the only thing that stopped us from going.   Yes I heard your plans for MAYBE going to End to grind while everyone else is at palace. Be my guest and go do that, there's nothing stopping you from doing that, except the fact you lacked the numbers throughout the evening.   And no, you should be at 3 DTR. I explicitly checked and made sure if I died you would still be at 3 DTR due to half DTR loss at PK. If that didn't happen, talk to the admins, though talking to them is way harder than telling me what to do."

Yes I heard your plans for MAYBE going to the End   Nothing maybe about it. We set out a clear plan to go once we had regenned dtr, and you decided you were too important to listen so not only did you lower our dtr you also prevented us from regenning.

Which reaffirms my point that everything you did at that point led us to believe you wanted to fight them.    I don't think somebody who dies 3 times in 6 hours is in any place to trash talk :o)   Funny, I rolled with desolate fighting people all day, and the only time I died was when I was forced to rely on your faction.

hcfactions,37294a,pidoalt,2,Sun May 24 14:47:00 2015 UTC,"Okay let's assume you're right, which you're not, but still let's assume you are. If archer were a support class, then the class still shouldn't be needed to hell. Archer should still be able to do at most 8-9 hearts of damage in one shot. However vertical distance shouldn't be included in the math if the archer is more than 10 blocks above the target. If you think I'm wrong and you think archer shouldn't do then I'll present an ""analogy"". Team Fortress 2 has 3 class groups. Offensive defensive and support. Sniper is s support class, however it can one shot almost any other class. And if you use the huntsman you can ""spam"" arrows."

The whole scoreboard system is being rewrote as we speak by Adam. (One of our Shotbow Devs)  I never stopped listening to you guys. I wish you could take a look behind the scenes and see just how much work has gone into this draft. I know you guys are upset with me and a lot of our team. Honestly, I am disappointed too.   As for the time of Palace. I was  told that the majority wanted it to be 4pm yesterday because of betrayals and a confirmation post going up fast enough.   I think we need to get a lot more staff on board that you guys trust and respect. I'm going to be going over all applications tomorrow. So, please if you think you can make a difference. Apply :)"

hcfactions,371z8b,Jarl_Herblings,6,Sun May 24 02:54:15 2015 UTC,oh tyty jarl i appreciate the welcoming. very warm very warm indeed. Man i wish i knew how to modernday pvp. i think i know how to but let me get this straight:   Always have another faction to jump your fights for you Pretend archer is a support class Spread cancer to other players   Did i get everything? or am i missing some key things. Actually now that i think about it here's some more   Trade lives for cs:go skins because having cool things in a video game is cooler than having cool things irl Become Global Elite in cs:go so you can officialy rekt little kids Completely disregard females and acquire all forms of currency   I think that settles it if i come up with anymore questions or ideas for how to modernday pvp i'll let you know

We were rightfully refunded. If you were in our position you'd be doing the same as we are. So the only thing here that is actually bias is this post smh

hcfactions,36wlb1,StabbdNtheTumy,1 point,Fri May 22 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"Hitting someone once and watching them fall to their death with little to no effort is not equivalent to fighting in an open area where both parties have the chance to fight back. Yes, a faction can kill the trappers, but its members are only made aware of their presence after the first kill--the trapper has ample time to escape before the faction that he is trapping is able to bypass their portal in order to catch him. Do you expect us to check our nether portals from the back each time we go through them?  Camping nether portals should be legal; fall trapping them should be banned."

Stop whining for the admins to change the rules to make it more 'fair' and figure out a way to outsmart your opponents.   First of all, most of the portal trapping that I have seen is power faction on power faction. It is not limited to smaller factions; all players have the ability to trap a portal under the current system.    To be safe, you probably should. Otherwise, if you get lazy and complacent, don't be surprised when you end up at the bottom of someones pit of death.   So everyone should be forced to walk around either create a new portal each time or fall to their death upon entering the old one? Sounds like an arbitrary waste of time-- valuable time which could be spent elsewhere.    Again, this is supposed to be a hardcore server. Says so right in the name.   Exactly!

hcfactions,36kq58,MrKurbyDude,1 point,Wed May 20 02:40:13 2015 UTC,Make the end exitable while tagged and it just TPs you outside of spawn like 150 blocks on the road or some shit. Just so players can kite and not have to just run around in the end because they cant exit at all.
hcfactions,36kq58,TheSixPool,1 point,Wed May 20 02:49:35 2015 UTC,No that encourages running. So much God dammed running. This end is good because it makes end fights happen. Fuck the ko ko hi way
hcfactions,36kq58,Retronaut-,1 point,Wed May 20 12:12:01 2015 UTC,"I think it was talked about last map to get rid of the 5 second tag in the end, not sure if anything came of it."

hcfactions,36kwwb,Freshtoast15,2,Wed May 20 16:42:13 2015 UTC,I was there for a month. You don't win because you can't ace every round and you have the worst teammates ever.
hcfactions,36kwwb,Seek_y0,1 point,Wed May 20 17:56:55 2015 UTC,Literally you'll be on a 2 to 3 game win streak and you'll get a team of dipshits who cant kill a bot.
hcfactions,36kwwb,Freshtoast15,1 point,Wed May 20 18:13:09 2015 UTC,Why blame your team? Do you think only YOU get those bad players?  No the enemy team will also get them.
hcfactions,36kwwb,Seek_y0,1 point,Wed May 20 22:03:39 2015 UTC,"Your kind of twisting my words. But yes I agree that the other team does get bad players, which is most likely the reason why I get 2 to 3 wins in a row. And trust me, since you obviously haven't been in silver lately, when I say that these players don't have a clue what theyre doing."

hcfactions,36ky75,Retronaut-,2,Wed May 20 04:09:24 2015 UTC,Thank you sir.  Many people are in exams so i think it is fair if they are inactive for a bit.
hcfactions,36ky75,Consuelo13,0,Wed May 20 04:19:32 2015 UTC,"I've realized it has only been 4 days. But people haven't been on in like 3 days. People get home from school at what 3:30 pm? They go to sleep at around 9:30 if they are good little boys and girls? That gives a long time to at least get into the ts to at least say ""hey, I'm busy, sorry!"" They don't even do that. They haven't been on for at least 5 hours in 4 days. If they don't play now, they might play just a little bit more in the summer, when the first 2 palace things are already over, which I'm guessing is half of the map."
hcfactions,36ky75,Retronaut-,3,Wed May 20 04:21:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, some people actually put schoolwork before minecraft. Finals are going on for a bunch of people, and I sure as hell wouldn't be playing e-legos if I could be studying to get a better grade. Some people might feel nervous going in teamspeak to tell their faction members (some of which are threatening to kick them, like you) that they can't play as often as they'd like. Just give it some time. Let the people who are new get to know you and make sure they have a good time. Give them a reason to be more active."
hcfactions,36ky75,Retronaut-,0,Wed May 20 04:34:08 2015 UTC,"We would much rather have someone come in the teamspeak to tell us what is going on.   I don't think people actually study for 6 hours straight, 7 days a week.   If they aren't going to be active then they can tell us that. Half of the people that signed up for our faction came in the ts once or twice and they didn't even speak."
hcfactions,36ky75,PrimeTimePVP,2,Wed May 20 04:49:16 2015 UTC,"Well tell them that, not me. Communicate with your faction what kind of experience you want to get out of it.   And people may not, but there are tons of extracurriculars that people take part in as well. Again, talk to you faction members about it. Instead of inviting all your friends, try and make new friends with the people who were drafted into your faction!"
hcfactions,36ky75,AlwaysLena,0,Wed May 20 05:01:59 2015 UTC,"We can't make friends with people who barely know English and come into the ts 3 times in 4 days. We tell them to get on more and they don't.   I'm telling you this so you realize what is going on with our faction and probably many other people's factions.   Hopefully more people get on in other factions during summer, if not, staff should consider merging."

hcfactions,36f06q,Retronaut-,1 point,Tue May 19 00:11:07 2015 UTC,"I don't want to write another novel right now, so I'll make it short and sweet. Basically two draft factions kicked a good amount of their random draft picks and combined into 1 larger, more active faction. Instead of sticking with their picks and trying to make something with the players they had, they opted to break the rules of the draft to form one faction full of their friends, which they could have easily done if they hadn't entered the draft. But they did, and they broke the rules, so there have to be consequences. So they have a power faction full of friends while everyone else has a handful of experienced players and then a bunch of randoms and noobs."

I mean, they should have just moved next to each other imo, but any veteran from the original draft map could have told you that you were going to have massive issues and banning people and trying to be all mean about it is not the right stance to take imo (it's backfired in the past for HCF)."

hcfactions,36f06q,zanotam,0,Mon May 18 22:53:34 2015 UTC,"How is this a problem? The factions which became badlion in map 8 that were both draft factions lived next to each other and worked together in map 7.

hcfactions,36f06q,Retronaut-,3,Tue May 19 00:14:25 2015 UTC,That is not accurate.  Only one of the factions was a draft faction.  Archy's faction was composed of people who chose not to participate in the draft.

Everyone else would have done the same thing and kicked all of their random members to invite their friends, but that defeats the purpose of the draft. And it's not the allying that I have a problem with, they would have done that anyways (they probably still will if they are split up). It's the fact that they purposefully bypassed the rules in order to be in a faction with their friends. They kicked people who didn't deserve to be kicked and now these people are missing out on the opportunity they were promised when they signed up for the draft.   Also, I don't think map 7 is a good reference for things, judging by how well that map turned out :/"

Now that I think of it; what if they create a plugin where every name you see that is not in your faction are black or created names like (Minecraft user) or something along those lines which will prevent people from knowing who not to hit. It might sound stupid but in practical terms it could be done and it might work.  (will be hard to focus people tho)"
hcfactions,36hdt2,_Yawpton_,1 point,Tue May 19 12:48:22 2015 UTC,What are you going to suggest? Ban people who ally?
hcfactions,36hdt2,_Yawpton_,0,Tue May 19 12:57:39 2015 UTC,"Yep!  You know the consequences of allying and if people still do it the appropriate punishment should be made to Leaders/Officer who were on at the time.   Let's put this on an extreme scale, murder. If someone murders another human and it is intentional they knew the consequences beforehand but he managed to still do it. There is obviously a big problem regarding allying and as a faction who allied, I feel that punishments should be in place so it doesn't happen again.  Now with a punishment as far as banning a player for a (map?) there must be clear evidence of two big factions allying against others. It'll be obvious when they do that so it shouldn't be difficult for the staff team to distinguish an ally from a friend (allying a solo faction or smth)."
hcfactions,36hdt2,flaming_dog_66,0,Tue May 19 13:04:19 2015 UTC,I'm an ally between 3 large factions. I don't honestly care about allying. Doesn't bother me. And why are you comparing a block game to murder?

hcfactions,36hdt2,Eythx,2,Wed May 20 02:11:57 2015 UTC,"To be honest, allies can be a thing if handled correctly by those who organize it.  Generally the leaders.    All alliances should be formed in defense and never permanent.  If there is a faction at palace with 20 online and all the other factions only have 6, 3 of them could ally to contest.  No, don't have 4 of them ally to outnumber.    If it is only done when necessary, basically if they are made to fight (not to win or lose), they are fine.  If that starts to be forgotten and people get 90 people alliances so they don't have to worry about contests then we can revisit this."

Allying is really only fucked when people start doing it to win, getting a 60 person ally so no one stands a chance.  If it is only used to level playing fields, which I can do my best to orchestrate, then it should turn out fine."

What we want most is to have as many people as possible playing HCF and having fun. That is the end goal that needs to be kept in mind when deciding what should happen to them.  This means that banning them if they don't comply may not be the best option. However letting it go on as it is with 20-25/35 people active isn't the way to go either. Why don't we set a limit on the group of people playing with them on a faction cap of 15-20. Heck if they want they can make 2 and be allied (Leaning towards 15 with this one.) That way they can play together, but be handicapped by not having as high a maximum DTR, and hitting each other in fights. It isn't the best solution, but it's something that could seriously work.  This idea could also go towards the draft map as a whole, non-draft factions being handicapped to only 15-20 slots. Thoughts?"

If there's no room for them, then let them wait, they did break the rules after all.   This would be very harsh towards them, but I have yet to see them offer up an idea of how to fix the problem.

hcfactions,36f40o,PrimeTimePVP,1 point,Tue May 19 00:53:11 2015 UTC,"They shouldn't just be split, they are the reason for other factions thinking they can disobey the rules and invite whoever they want. They ruined the entire point of a Draft Map when it was clear how it would work. And their faults should come with a price, possibly clearing a lot of their items or etc."
hcfactions,36f40o,Captainmike15,1 point,Tue May 19 01:06:25 2015 UTC,Don't ban them unless they refuse to split. If they refuse then fuck 'em.

hcfactions,36f40o,elot_trel,1 point,Tue May 19 17:06:25 2015 UTC,"Do nothing.  Rules weren't enforced, a lot of people joined in factions they shouldn't be in and nothing was done about it. It's too late now. Learn from it and do it better next time if you don't want move people away from the server. While it does piss me off that people that should be in my faction joined others you guys simply weren't being strict enough.  After all you suceeded reviving the server but failed when it comes to the Draft. When it was announced that people can make picks it was obvious that they will try to recreate their factions for the most part. Factions should have been completely randomnized if you want people to actually play with new people."
hcfactions,36f40o,TrailScape,1 point,Mon May 18 23:18:43 2015 UTC,"Every other faction has randoms/new people and they are dealing with it.  That is why there needs to be the change.  Also what this is is an attempt to enforce the rules and allow the players to have Input, because one of HCF's biggest failures has always been when a higher up makes a decision with consulting the people it affects"
hcfactions,36f40o,Balditron,0,Mon May 18 23:21:24 2015 UTC,"split them. your just showing jhalt how weak we are when we cant even enforce our own rules for 3 days. They always get there way. They've had staff abuse, barely any checks for hacks/macros, and most of them are toxic. Barely anyone wants them on the server please split them up."

hcfactions,36f40o,ROFLMC,2,Mon May 18 22:24:04 2015 UTC,You are all being really immature by asking to get banned. People like you guys are the people who ruin the community. No one even said anything about bans unless they were joking or the stray few who wanted you to get banned. I do think you guys need to be split up because if you have no noticed we are in a draft map and if you wanted to create amerinide you could have just made a non-draft faction...
hcfactions,36f40o,ReaVeZz,0,Tue May 19 12:17:55 2015 UTC,They are asking to be banned now but once they realize they've actually been banned they'll have nowhere to go since the other hcf servers are not as active or as fun as HCF right now. I agree not everyone from Amerinide should be banned but some of the members are being such a nuisance and ignorant/immature about the situation.
hcfactions,36f40o,ROFLMC,0,Tue May 19 00:35:16 2015 UTC,They broke the rules. Map ban them.
hcfactions,36f40o,ROFLMC,0,Tue May 19 01:04:34 2015 UTC,Just let them have their own faction and draft the abandoned players to other factions. There are plenty of factions that has a lot of players who didn't show up and players who hardly logs on so it's not like there isn't any room for the abandoned players.

I'm sure there's some truth to that, but you have to realize, you broke the rules. Plain and simple. There have to be consequences to that or else more people will be inclined to break the rules.   And it is unfair. Every other draft faction drafted around 10 (could be more, could be less) ""known""  players and then filled the rest with random people. Your faction ignored that and invited all your friends. Instead of trying to make the best out of what you had, you guys instead chose to ignore the rules and form a faction of all your friends. You guys could have done what everyone else is doing and try and make this map great for both yourselves and the noobs who got drafted into your factions, but instead you all took the easy way out."

hcfactions,36cw36,BeingMed,2,Mon May 18 11:20:11 2015 UTC,I don't see it's fair how we have to kick members (Nakawaski) while Amerinide can just combine members not on their draft roster. Keep in mind we only add Naka because 76trombones wasn't allowed to play the draft map anymore.  Then we have people like Bhird that drafts people in the last rounds that didn't even sign up for the draft map.
hcfactions,36cw36,elot_trel,2,Mon May 18 13:08:39 2015 UTC,"Rules say because they combined, you can now invite anyone you'd like you just can't kick the drafted players you already have. So invite nakawaski again they can't actually stop you elite."
hcfactions,36cw36,Irish_Wreckage,2,Mon May 18 13:20:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess, but it's pathetic how people bug the admins for a draft map then don't actually play by the rules when their request has been met."

hcfactions,36cw36,_VanillaFace_,7,Mon May 18 11:45:55 2015 UTC,That doesn't fucking matter. The point of the draft map was to play with other groups of people and not with your friends. Excluding several others because you'd much rather play with your friends isn't in the spirit of the draft map and ends up making palace (among other events) a fucking curb stomp.

hcfactions,36ezly,_VanillaFace_,6,Mon May 18 21:48:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think you realise that you winning isn't the problem.  It's you guys cheating the rules of the draft.  It's you guys kicking the members who actually should be in the faction due to drafting.  It's you guys pushing the rules as far as you can get them even when there was some room allowed for you yesterday  Personally I feel you guys can't lose at minecraft. Before the merge you guys were completely fucked, the faction had gone raid able and colonel was basically crying because every single other leader was doing better. Since he can't lose at this block game and it shows that he can't lead a group of people he resorts to just inviting all of you. That's my opinion"

And I understand you all want to play with your friends, but you all shouldn't have signed up for the draft if that was the case. And activity isn't just based off who's online at one point. People can get on at different times of the day than the majority and still be active. And everyone else was in the exact same boat as you when it comes to activity. That's what you signed up for when you wanted to be part of the draft. So just man up and fix whatever you guys did and we can all have a fun map."

Recently, the National Association of Chickens contacted all servers and suggested that Minecraft was creating a hostile, violent perception among gamers towards chickens.  As a result, we quickly implemented a chicken protection plugin, which no longer allows you to have huge chicken farms.  The result? Rather than kill hundreds if not thousands of chickens, you now kill the same chicken over and over.  While this is unfortunate for that feathery target, we've reduced chicken murder by 10,543%.

Be patient, and don't go giving ill-advised criticism when they server is doing the best they can to keep the quality still playable."
hcfactions,366kxl,Prateon,1 point,Sat May 16 17:49:33 2015 UTC,In my post I never mentioned adding more slots to the queue.
hcfactions,366kxl,Prateon,2,Sat May 16 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"Let players who want to play in   the majority of people who are online are either part of the draft, or are making their own faction. Ultimately not everyone is forced to participate in the draft, and it's unfair to deny them the playing experience because they won't want to do the whole draft thing."
hcfactions,366kxl,Prateon,1 point,Sat May 16 17:53:50 2015 UTC,"Most of the people who are joining have not even played HCF before and are very likely to quit in the next 3 days, are you saying that the people who went through the time to participate in the actual Draft map, the applications, and have participated in HCF in the past don't deserve to get higher priority? The purpose of this entire map is for Drafting and you know its true that most of the people that didn't even bother to get drafted probably are going to quit, taking up essential server space of the players who have a draft faction to play with."
hcfactions,366kxl,TopShadow,3,Sat May 16 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"No they don't. Every player should be seen in the same basis, since HCF isn't even officially calling it a draft map. It's just map 26, that coincidentally has a draft portion of it. This whole ordeal with the server being full has occured for the past 3 years that I've played HCF. Sure- people who are going to quit might get in, but who knows, maybe they might be the next power faction, or the next elite mineman. The truth of the matter is that it'd be bias for the admins to prefer a specific playerbase, when this isn't just a draft map. It's a regular hcf map, where regular factions will be created, and regular pvp will happen, it just so happens that it coexists with stabb's draft that he organized, that he setup, that he went and made the process.   Most of the people in the draft will likely quit in the next 3 days, and many have never played HCF before."

hcfactions,366iok,Nitaraa,4,Sun May 17 02:47:18 2015 UTC,"Feel free to optimize your own plugin. Let me give a comparison to badlion UHCs. 350 people all spawning in a world, but that is with extremely limited plugins that have been optimized to their max extent. The shotbow box is just as good, and it has a lot more plugins, many of which weren't written that well.  If you want 800 people playing on a server choose a different game. Minecraft is shitty as fuck when it comes to its code, and you shouldn't be spewwing shit out of your ass, when realistically they are doing the best they can."
hcfactions,366iok,Dellerror,2,Sat May 16 21:46:37 2015 UTC,"Yes because stabb's #1 priority is to make the server money. A player organized map isnt going to turn away everyone after the server cap limit has reached.   Highlife has already said,  ""However, we will have ALL HANDS ON DECK for this launch. If issues do come up, we will be proactively fixing them. Even if we are stable at 300, that still isn't good enough for me. This box is powerful. It is the best processor you can buy, and as such we should see it hitting 400 players or more just fine. So my hope is that even if we have to cap it at 300, what we learn from this SOTW will allow us to reach 400 or beyond for the next map."""

hcfactions,366ima,domolisha,2,Sat May 16 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"No other server network can make it any bigger. Minecraft is a horribly coded game, that wasn't made to handle such stress, and there isn't a box money can buy that can help facilitate the lag that'd happen if 800 people were on it. But I'm glad that someone as knowledge about setting up major networks is giving your helping hand on fixing the issue rather then complaining."
