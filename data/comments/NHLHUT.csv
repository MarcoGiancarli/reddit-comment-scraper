So make sure you still have those bronzies around with full contracts so you can swap them around when contracts run out. Shouldn't be a problem with 500+ players, but someone like me, who has used almost all contracts on the cards from collection packs, I am in a point where I don't have any other gold cards with contracts other than the team I use to play rare online game here or there.

NHLHUT,3e2g86,Tacsi,4,Tue Jul 21 13:11:05 2015 UTC,"We can intercept passes consistently now on D?  Thank fuck.. the last few years have been garbage in that regard.  The only way a cross-crease (or any other pass) should ever get through a perfectly positioned d-man in this game is via manual saucer pass.  This makes me excited for 6v6.  Also, this is about fucking time:   They finally corrected the “line change bug”, so when you’re trying to change lines when defending you can finally keep pokechecking.   Can't believe they didn't fix this with a patch for '15..."
NHLHUT,3e2g86,Jeembo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:04:28 2015 UTC,"I'm good with this as long as it's relative to player ratings and positioning. If you're giving high end players like Giroux for example time to line up a pass and just standing still in the lane, he's going to thread that through at a much higher rate than someone more along the lines of David Backes. Just like Duncan Keith should do a much better job deflecting and intercepting passes than Dustin Byfuglien.  Similarly, there should be a big difference in the success rate between intercepting a slow 30 foot pass that you have all day to line up and skate into, versus a quick short pass.  I'm all for removing the randomness where the same pass gets forced 10 different times until it eventually connects, as well as the situations where you can read the 50 foot stretch pass a mile away but it squirts passed you, but I also think eliminating passing opportunities should be more about covering the intended receiver and taking time and space away from the puck carrier instead of just standing still."

There are too many players and two few ratings to create real disparity amongst everyone.  Even if you nerf overalls there are still going to be  a ton of ""good, not quite elite"" players grouped together.  What difference does it make if their overalls are 87 or 90?"

NHLHUT,3e2g86,xenongamer4351,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:51 2015 UTC,"Well yeah but even if that's my point, which its not at all, why would Giroux or anyone like Giroux ever be an 87?"
NHLHUT,3e2g86,mike7oo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"Because people are complaining that lower valued cards aren't worth anything.  Make a player like Giroux an 87 (and all of the other players of his caliber 87s - Kesler, Kessel, Hall, etc.) and boom, now you have lower rated cards that are worth something.  So if that isn't your point, what is your point?"
NHLHUT,3e2g86,xenongamer4351,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:30 2015 UTC,My point is that I hope NHL doesn't do what Madden did and start flooding the market with 99's making players under a 95 or so go extremely cheap. I literally have no idea why you started saying to lower guys like Giroux to 87.
NHLHUT,3e2g86,mike7oo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:52:06 2015 UTC,My point is that the lower you start the more room you have to make improvements on player overalls so that you won't reach the 99 overall cap.
NHLHUT,3e2g86,xenongamer4351,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:28 2015 UTC,"Difficult to grasp? Why are we jumping to insults here? All I was trying to say was I hope it doesn't become like Madden where they have so many 99's on the market from events like Easter or the Pro Bowl that Elite players such as say a Josh Gordon base or a Jarvis Landry Elite card can be had for like 2k because comparatively speaking there are so many 95+ cards at their position actually using either of them puts you at a severe disadvantage. That's all I'm saying. Regardless of if Giroux is an 87 or a 90, it's literally not even the point I was trying to make. I don't even disagree with you, all I'm saying is that what you're saying isn't what I was saying."
NHLHUT,3e2g86,mike7oo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:26 2015 UTC,"My bad.  I thought you were being sassy with me.  I read it now, and I see it differently.  I agree with your statement, but in a different way.  I just hope they don't flood the market with tons of versions of the same cards again.  Like Jagr really doesn't need 11 cards.  They could have grouped his MS cards together, and created less versions that would've carried more weight and understandable value.  So to me a 86, 89, 92, 94 and 97 versions would have made more sense, rather than always going +1 per card.  Same thing happened with Kane, Getzlaf, Voracek.  That's the part I don't like about how HUT does special cards.  So in a way its the same issue that Madden has, but because NHL cards start with lower overalls than they do in Madden we're just getting flooded with 93s, 94s and 95s as opposed to 99s.  At the end of the day I think we agree, and are probably on the same page now."

NHLHUT,3e2g86,Jimmyjam1979,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:06 2015 UTC,"directioning the pass is sometimes hard and randomic wrong passes are not uncommon   Ben Ross (senior producer) posted on the forums about the changes in passing as they are looking to bring it more in line with previous releases. It may take some getting used to but should be better than some of the junk passes we had to deal with in 15.  It sounds like the window for pass targeting with pass assist is smaller which would lead to some of the off-target passes you saw.   We have added back manual control over pass power by holding down pass, however, we have raised the min speed so that you can snap the puck around a bit easier which was sometimes difficult in 14 due to having to power up after each reception just to move it quickly to the opposite point man as an example.  We have added back more accountability over being in control so that passing out of a glide is better than passing in stride and passing as soon as you receive a puck isn't as good as passing when already in control. This is all graded against your players ratings as well so some players will be better than others.  The other big change is in pass assist. We want to make sure you can pass to players you expect but also want creativity to be there as well. To do this we changed the pass assist angles to move off of where you plan to lead the player rather than the intended player's current position being in the target area. We then also take your requested pass speed into account so that you would aim closer to the receiver the harder you pass and further ahead the softer you pass when they are moving -- if you don't hit that spot to target the player in stride, we release it as an untargeted pass in the direction of your left stick. With that, you can bank passes off the boards or pass pucks down into the corner with the level of assist that is on in Hardcore. If you really want FULL control, you can use Manual Saucer pass but the regular pass is pretty free for most uses like it was in 14."
NHLHUT,3e2g86,Mellakka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:34 2015 UTC,"THANK GOD. The pass assisting was so jacked up in 15, to me it was one of the most infuriating things in the game. A normal pass could only be sent directly to where the player was at the time of the pass, aim anywhere else and it would send it deep in the zone off the boards or pass it back out of your zone."

Brodie is a 87 - that is a +4 upgrade from his base.  Gaudreau - talked about ad nauseum- no base card so can't even count it.  Ramo went from an 85 -> 88. Jones, Backlund, and Stajan all have minor upgrades.  Bottom line is the Flames were not expected to do well this year - so their base ratings of players were poor -> can't blame EA for that as many expected us to be in the McDavid sweepstakes.  Overall they had numerous players upgraded as mentioned above - but since their base ratings were so poor, it doesn't seem as substantial."

The more and more I hear about the Hamilton scenario, the more I realize he got what he could for him.   His drafting remains to be seen. But all in all I'm not even mad anymore."

Play games (maybe even rookie games against Great Britain with a bronze team or something) and stack up coins, and when you got coins you should work the market while making coins from games.  Also buying packs will probably be worth it because of the high prices of cards."

The code you will get will be for the US PS Store, so you will have to contact Amazon / Sony about changing it to a EU code, and they did not like that.  These things may vary, so your best bet for getting accurate answers is contacting Amazon's customer service."

Or is that not available in Europe either.  UK Amazon used to list NHL16 Deluxe edition (which was not available when I checked it couple of times), but it's gone now. I emailed them about a week ago and asked if they are going to be selling the Deluxe Edition and got their typical bullshit email ""Some items will become available, some won't, we can't know for sure now"" blabla.  And at least UK Gamestops are not selling deluxe edition, at least from what I know."

He retired a year ago (+1 year), he missed half a season due to 94-94 lockout (+0.5 years), a full season in 04-05 lockout (+1 year) and finally another half season in 12-13 lockout (+0.5 years), that all comes to 3 years out! Plus he also took half a season break after 2007 Cup, so that's pumping Teemu to 3.5 seasons out of the game. Yet, he still managed to play 1400+ games, score a hair short of 700 goals (684), 700+ assists and 1400+ points, he was exactly 1.00ppg (well 1457 in 1451, pretty close to exact).

NHLHUT,3e2gsq,KamiCollie,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:33 2015 UTC,"no one knows yet, legends for NHL16 has not been revealed yet 3 cards. Base Legend (92 ovr), Milestone (93) and Stanley Cup Edition (94) You can own all of them, actually multiple of them, but you can have only one in the lineup. Also, you can only have 1 per version in your collection, rest of them will be in your inbox, but it doesn't really make any difference where they are. I would recommend buying the Legend base card and put a Captain card on him. Captain card adds +2 to everything and I would assume if he is your favorite player, you want him to be your captain. And Legends have quite stable market in my opinion, so you can still sell him, if you get more coins so you can make the swap for Milestone card later."
NHLHUT,3e2gsq,Mellakka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:34:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I saw yesterday afternoon he went for 25k. Hoping he's still that today.
NHLHUT,3e2gsq,Mellakka,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:52 2015 UTC,"no problem. I just checked and there's two up now at 30k buy now, which is not too bad I guess. Or just keep checking the auction house for a cheaper one. One good way would be to use the trade threads here, you might be lucky find someone giving you a good deal."

NHLHUT,3e045e,IYolkTheGarden,2,Mon Jul 20 22:49:36 2015 UTC,Actually for shootouts I think almost my entire lineup is lefties. It does seem easier in shootouts to go with lefties for me for some reason. Righties in every other game situation though
NHLHUT,3e045e,AlexGrr,2,Mon Jul 20 22:52:50 2015 UTC,I'm the other way around. Right shot in real life but better at everything in nhl with lefties.

NHLHUT,3e045e,flanny0210,2,Tue Jul 21 01:40:18 2015 UTC,I'm the opposite.  Right handed in real life but just on how the right stick is its much easier to shoot with lefties for me.
NHLHUT,3e045e,Beaustrodamus,2,Tue Jul 21 01:46:47 2015 UTC,"Handedness doesn't really affect me too much, but I definitely feel more comfortable bringing the puck up from the right side or the center of the blue line."

NHLHUT,3e045e,Skylightt,2,Tue Jul 21 09:52:15 2015 UTC,I'm a righty but because so many players in the NHL are lefties I've become slightly better using lefties than righies

NHLHUT,3dza80,GaiRui,8,Mon Jul 20 19:12:04 2015 UTC,"GREAT post, thank you for that level of detail. UPVOTE THIS MAN!!!   my players don't seem to be in position all the time when I'm playing behind the net   I HATE behind the net, and can never seem to get it to work. It sounds to me like you want ""Crash the net"" even if you'd like to work from behind the net.    My players seem to miss the puck or hit a really tame shot   Do you let them get set up (are they kind of paused, facing you), or are they moving still? Try spending an extra half/full second letting them get set. watch this video I made about this exact topic. Look for when I could have passed and he wouldn't be ready, then when I could have passed to have the pass blocked, then find where I could pass and he's set up AND I have a clear passing lane. I think one timers are often a patience game.   I basically have 120,000 to spend on improving my team   D looks sound, goalies look alright (I'd use Bishop as my backup). You can use some offensive help.   4th C: Joe Thornton (4k or less) - easy swap. One of the best faceoff guys, great at holding the puck, elite passing, great shot, a little slow 2 LW: Jeff Carter (8k or less) - another easy one. GREAT shot, very good at holding the push. I like the way he moves and finishes one timers 1 C: Pavel Datsyuk (38k or less). Great faceoffs, elite handling, amazing shot, great passing, amazing defense, he's your new favorite player 1 LW: Jamie Benn (25k or less). GREAT snipey shot, larger guy so can muscle into the slot easier, beauty at finishing one timers 2 C: Patrice Bergeron (28k or less) or Legend Eric Lindros (45k or less). Lindros if you like big guys (he's phenominal). I prefer Lindros 4 LW: Patrick Sharp (12k or less). Better shot, faster, higher defense.   You're now SOLID down the middle for a long while. Top line is a two way beast line, with plenty of snipe power, passing, and size. Second line can now pass better, has some finish on the left side, improved faceoffs, and size. I didn't touch your grinder line, but if you want more finish replace Joel Ward with someone like TOTW Cammeleri. Fourth line Thornton can now act as a PK top line center with Sharp at his side, passes roll easier, better shots and speed, more defense."
NHLHUT,3dza80,anonmarmot,5,Mon Jul 20 20:33:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! I think I'll go ahead and get datsyuk, thornton, and sharp. As for one timers I haven't been giving them enough time to set up I guess.   I'm new to ice hockey and all the terminology, what exactly is crashing the net?"
NHLHUT,3dza80,anonmarmot,3,Mon Jul 20 20:49:00 2015 UTC,"I also recently editted my comment to include a video demonstrating the one timer patience thing, not sure if you saw it.  crash the net is essentially where you tell your forwards that when you shoot, or are looking to pass, they should skate at the net. It's really good for getting rebounds, and creating a lot of motion around the net. I find having people skate at the net leads to good things like open guys for passes, and rebound goals."
NHLHUT,3dza80,McSnipeAlot,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:03 2015 UTC,these are all very good recommendations!  the estimated prices are a little on the high side as most of those guys are a bit cheaper these days.

NHLHUT,3e1dfx,Cowtownboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:40:53 2015 UTC,Sí. The team modifier goes up if it is an all bronze squad. And you have to be playing an NHL team or Team Canada or USA to get
NHLHUT,3e1dfx,Bennguins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:55:24 2015 UTC,"Actually that's false, can be any team, just have to win on superstar with 5 goals - 4 goals nets about 1100 coins, 3 - 1000.. And so forth. Now if you are actually trying to make coins, an all bronze team is more economical meaning if you spend about 100 per contract, the cost of a game is just under 400... So you earn over 800 a game. If you use an all gold team and net 1200 coins, you might barely break  if a gold contract is about 600-650 coins (which is what it seems to be selling for nowadays)"

NHLHUT,3e0nvp,EJrex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:47:18 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. If every user opens the same amount more players = more packs = more supply. More people play it on one

NHLHUT,3e0idj,NotFoley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:26:54 2015 UTC,"I found that I can run two full lines with upgraded bronze players in order to cut the cost of running my team down to a profit. Getting contracts for them is basically free (buy the 600 coin packs and sell everything but the contracts; torso and leg injury cards mean the pack actually made you money). I can buy the rare gold contracts for 1250 for every player and still make a profit every game.  PS: Never, under any circumstances, buy non rare gold contracts. They are absolute ripoffs when you can find the rare contracts (and over twice the games) for a couple hundred more coins."

I've got the 92 and he is absolutely unreal and would be your perfect 1C. Lindros is also very good but a 1st line of Voracek-Dats-Bure would be quite well balanced i reckon so he may be more suited to the 2nd line.   I wouldn't pay the price for +1 on Duchene personally. Backstrom is also very good for the price but he is weak on the faceoff. Buying 91/92 Datsyuk and TOTW/MS Lindros would be a good upgrade on your team I reckon."
NHLHUT,3e0yr1,magicking610,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:57:00 2015 UTC,Try out some better faceoff guys at the center spot. I suggest Bergeron and Kesler. It can make all the difference in a game.

NHLHUT,3e0cs5,BaconSlapShot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:18:45 2015 UTC,I use it to trick them into skating more center to defend while my guy slows down. It also makes him shoot harder I think.   It does seem to maybe drag the goalie center a bit too? That part might just be from drifting center
NHLHUT,3e0cs5,BCHaze,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:37 2015 UTC,The way you skate in a straight line then cut in holding it back makes it look glitchy

NHLHUT,3dxwgk,anonmarmot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:59 2015 UTC,"anonmarmot covered most of your answers but to add on 4. a bit. It can be beneficial to use bronze cards on your 4th line, but I would do it only if you are really struggling with coins. Otherwise, PK guys like anonmarmot suggested would be a better way to go. And definitely do not use bronze cards on 3rd d-pair, unless they are like TOTY cards (technically not bronze cards anymore). You should use 3rd d-pair a lot more than 4th forward line, which makes it a bit more sensible to use bronzes on the 4th line."

NHLHUT,3dxwgk,ShowelingSnow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:43:23 2015 UTC,"More noob questions;  I've already asked a similar question which was perfectly answered but I'd now like to change the parameters a bit.  Assuming you are not using Real Money at all, you have 3k coins available, your lines look like the following (sorry at work);  Forwards: 1: gold, gold, gold 2: gold, gold, gold 3: silver, silver, silver 4: bronze, bronze, bronze  Defense: 1: Gold, gold 2: Gold, gold 3: Bronze, bronze  Goalies: Gold, Gold  All my gold cards are lower than 85 overall (about 400 coins or less), my silvers are whoever has contracts to be played (I needed to purchase one from each team for a collector trophy so I have many), so I'm rotating them out when their contract expires, and the bronze guys are static (based on height and speed), average 65 ish.  Without having many coins, it's hard to make coins.  I'm constantly heading to the AH after every game to buy a gold contract or 2 and occasionally some bronze ones.  As mentioned, the silver guys I rotate out for new silver guys (so I save three gold contracts every game).  I'm not even really paying attention to chemistry that much, etc.  I recently got to Div 3.  So what would be the first thing you pros would do (or an example of picking up a 95+ player, say 100k coins worth)?  When I read people saying they've completed a FULL collection (all teams) a few times..  I'm blown away.  I feel the game can sustain itself (at least up to DIV 3) without spending real money, but if I want Price for example (at 40K or whatever it is at now) I feel it'll take me weeks.  (I'm not new to NHL, but I'm really new to HUT and the AH).  Thanks in advanced for dealing with my scenarios!  If more details are needed - please let me know."

NHLHUT,3dzidk,Mellakka,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:39 2015 UTC,"I would probably get rid of Bjugstad and Vermette and get some better cards there for their price. In addition to already mentioned Lindros and Bergeron, you could consider Kesler as your 2C. A good all around center, good at faceoffs as well and fast enough, comes with a cheaper price tag than Duchene.  You could try promoting Bossy to 2nd line LW? Also, get a better 1st line LW, unless Hanzal is really breaking the bank for you. I think he would be ideal 3rd line winger. Maybe someone like Kessel, Seguin, Kurri could work there very well?"

AI has gotten worse, collision physics are a joke, strategies don't make a huge difference in the gameplay because the AI doesn't react accordingly; unless you're playing the neutral zone trap and collapsing the net, and player movement feels clunky and unresponsive at times (online). There's a few other things I can get into, but don't have enough time in the day.   Johnny Superbman pretty much nailed everything in his new video that I've been complaining about all year."

It's awful compared to this. The skating is better in 15, the shooting is more realistic; you can actually lose the puck on a wind-up slap shot, the dekes are more fluid. Maybe the goalie mechanics are a little shaky, but proper defence wins games. Strategies do make a huge difference, you're probably just changing the wrong ones. The only way they fucked up 15 was removing game modes and stripping features. Everything else is people complaining because they can't figure the game out."

The only thing that I'm looking forward to this year is couch co-op, the revamped GM mode, and playing EASHL. Maybe a little HUT if the gameplay is less clunky. To each their own.

NHLHUT,3dx724,anonmarmot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:46 2015 UTC,"Wow! Never heard of any of these. Alesmith Ale sounds somewhat familiar though. As far as pricing goes, I live in Montgomery CO. MD. One of most wealthiest counties in the states (top 5), and the tax hike here on tobacco and alcohol is ridiculously high anyways. A 6 pk. of common domestic beer here that used to cost 4.99-5.99 is now 6.99. After tax it's 8 bucks. Oddly enough, some of the more common imports like Heinekin, Becks, ect. are still only 8.99-9.99. So now if someone is looking for an ok cheap bargain beer, they can still only find stuff like Natty light, Milwaukee's Worst, and Busch as cheap alternatives instead of having the option to pay a dollar more for Coors Lt, Bud, and Miller. Even the aforementioned college beer went up a dollar in price. The rise in oil/transportation costs made everything skyrocket. Even though the price for a barrel of oil has dropped dramatically, the prices of alcohol never goes back down. Nothing really goes back down except fuel costs.  I guess I can't be mad because I'm still paying less for an IPA per beer from a sixer, vs. going out to a bar and getting a 16oz domestic. So there's that...LOL"

NHLHUT,3dx724,JerBear81,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:22:59 2015 UTC,"""You're expecting a bona fide hockey simulator ain't cha'?""  Well that's sorta the whole goal and point to this game isn't it? To be able to have the most authentic gameplay and choices in game? ""It's in the game"" is EA's slogan. Meaning, they're supposedly striving to put out the most authentic, realistic sports games possible. If I wanted to play a nonsimulator hockey game, I'd play Hitz, or find another alternative. Tired of hearing this excuse.  As far as the shooting, skating, deking is concerned...  It seems that EA tried to make certain aspects of these things better, but failed miserably by not fine tuning them properly. Skating is clunky. Especially when trying to stop, start, and turn. Speed and acceleration is also out of whack. I shouldn't be getting caught up ice by a 6'3"" 220lbs plus defender 30-40 ft out when I'm a player like Hagelin or Cogliano. The lag compensation in online games only makes this worse.  Some of the deking aspects are also off. Especially when it comes to protecting the puck. You should be allowed to TRAMPLE over a guy that's off-balanced, holding the puck out to the side. Somehow, you're allowed to mash the right stick to the 4 o'clock/8 o'clock position and get away with not being bulldozed to the ice. If I go to lay a hit, and you're in that said animation (pulling the puck back to the side), my checker will slide right off the guy as if there were an invisible force field shielding you ftom a check.   IMO button deking configurations need to be changed. Too many times I'm trying to do one thing, and I wind up pulling off an unintentional toe drag, or doing a horizontal stride deke. Not always an issue, but the configuration should be changed around a bit.  Deking itself isn't the biggest issue, but when your allowed to deke through 3 of my AI defenders, without them putting up a fight... that's definitely a cause for concern. More of a AI problem than deking.   Another issue is trying to switch players on defense. BIG ISSUE! When I'm trying to select a certain player to get back on defense, 9/10 it always selects the player closest to the puck. A big flaw with this game that leads to GA because you can't select the appropriate player for defending. Never had these problems with past iterations of this game.  Passing and penaties.?  Don't even get me started. I'm sure you're aware of these issues.  ""Strategies do make a huge difference, you're probably just changing the wrong one's"".  I kind of chuckle at this comment seeing as 90% of the HUT population I play against only uses the 1-4, 1-2-2 passive/1-3-1, and plays the neutral zone trap while collapsing to the net. Which seems to be what 90% of players in div 1 do. These exact type of settings should only be available to players who are on the PK. Not throughout the entire game.   Sure there are workarounds to combating these strategies, but if you're playing with any sort of lag, or a veteran spammer, it's makes for a very boring game, with low shots on net; all while you're chasing down someone who does nothing but play keep away while spamming the right stick.   Besides... I played hockey professionally for many years, so I think I know what I'm trying to do strategically.  Calling these ""strategies"" is laughable at best.  ""Everything else is people complaining because they can't figure the game out"".  In some cases, you maybe right. If you're referring to casual players who may not be familiar with all the finer points of hockey. I know for a fact that seasoned veterans of this game (like myself), although may be good at the game, do not like '15' very much - and with good reason. I think it's easy for people (like yourself) to defend this game. Especially If you're mainly playing HUT, and probably dumping extra money on the game. It makes it easier for people to make excuses for it. I also take opinions of people who play HUT 90% of the time with a grain of salt. Chances are, you're just used to playing with specialty HUT players a majority of the time who are all 90 and above. Not a good way to make a solid judgement call on the gameplay imo.   If you like this style of play, cross-crease goalscoring, and betalike gameplay, then have at it my man..."

I'm also not bitching for the sake of bitching on a subreddit dedicated to a game mode that you clearly aren't a fan of.

Nor that '14' blows '15' out in all aspects. My original point being was that '15' looks better then it plays. '14' being better as far the gameplay functionality goes (how the game feels while playing), in' 15' It feels very unrefined, and it seems like they're heading down that road again for another season.  Furthermore, I'm a top 200 ranked player in HUT, so I do dabble there a bit. Not a dime spent either. '15' may be heading in the right direction in certain aspects (visually), but In other ways, it's just not. Never said that '14' was the holy grail that EA should repeat either.  Also, my comments have nothing to do with me being ""spoiled"" or entitled. If we are paying for a product as a consumer, it should be good. Or at least worth spending time and money on. If not, there's no point in paying for it now is there?"

It's on a new system and being run by a new engine. Things aren't going to be perfect for you right out of the gate, especially with the challenges the NHL dev team experienced, providing a game for 4 different systems.

They completely took away the ability to have full control of where the puck is going to go when you hit that RT or R2. You've never tried to throw the puck behind the net along the boards and had it go towards the guy standing in front of the net only to be intercepted? You haven't noticed how your players will fuck up trying to receive a soft pass along the boards behind your own net like at least 50% of the time?

NHLHUT,3dwtaa,leflur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:31 2015 UTC,So let me get this straight he makes a big deal about how strategies should be re-mapped on the controller...... then a few points later he is ranting about how strategies don't do anything and should be removed?  When you start contradicting your complaints you are just digging for anything to whine about for the sake of whining IMO.  Also hard to take somebody seriously that puts that much value in shootouts.    Had no clue who he was but not a fan.  Quickly found myself blocking him out and just watching the pack openings but even then closed it long before the end.  Pack openings are only fun to watch if somebody cares about them or at least pretends to.  On the positive side I got much younger since anybody who disagrees with him is just a dumb teen.  Nice to have my youth back.   So far Famox is the only NHL YouTuber I have subscribed to.  Oddly I find myself liking the FIFA YouTubers more even though I don't play FIFA much.  Sure there are some others I would like and have yet to discover though.
NHLHUT,3dwtaa,Hayabusa85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:48:12 2015 UTC,Fifa youtubers make NHL YT'ers look like middle school multimedia students making their first ever video projects. Someone other than Bacon and a couple others need to step their game up.
NHLHUT,3dwtaa,jkendall27,0,Mon Jul 20 13:16:56 2015 UTC,true.   but they also make much more money because of so many more views and stuff
NHLHUT,3dwtaa,panthersgods,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it's not just cause more people play Fifa. Their content and ideas are so much better, it's not just pack openings and gameplay commentaries."
NHLHUT,3dwtaa,jkendall27,0,Mon Jul 20 16:52:32 2015 UTC,i agree their videos in general are way better.  but it is actually because more people play the game lol  over 30x as many people play fifa compared to nhl
NHLHUT,3dwtaa,panthersgods,0,Mon Jul 20 16:57:28 2015 UTC,I don't see how that has to do with Fifa YT'ers coming up with better ideas and providing more entertaining content for there viewers.
NHLHUT,3dwtaa,jkendall27,0,Mon Jul 20 17:35:55 2015 UTC,"no i know, i agreed with you their videos are way better.  but the views are also way more beause there is a way bigger target audience, impossible to deny that.  More views means more money, more money means more competition, more competition forces better content.  at least in my head thats how it works"
NHLHUT,3dwtaa,panthersgods,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"That could be the case. However there are quite a few NHL YTers but no one has really stepped up their game. Fifa has the advantage, but NHL still needs to start coming up with better content."

NHLHUT,3dwtaa,Iknowwhereyoualllive,3,Mon Jul 20 14:18:37 2015 UTC,"Dynamite observation sir.  I just watched the video, and I couldn't understand why he'd want any version of shootout mode.  Sure it was some fun, but not a make or break feature.  Then I saw how many of these he does, and its probably easy for him to make videos just by talking over these.  Having shootouts doesn't make the game that much better; he just wants it for selfish reasons."
NHLHUT,3dwtaa,mike7oo,0,Mon Jul 20 20:01:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's probably mostly for personal gain. I like shootout mode, but I didn't play it much this year when I was on 360.

NHLHUT,3dvvwt,Blobbles890,2,Sun Jul 19 23:37:40 2015 UTC,"Great post, reasonable rankings, nice and conservative.  I think Hanzal, Kesler, Vatanen, Bieksa, Monahan, and Kane could all be a tick higher.   Also think that if Bergeron gets knocked down to a 90 then Getz/Perry should only be a 91. But that's nitpicking."
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,Qualarious,2,Sun Jul 19 23:48:55 2015 UTC,"Great post and good ratings! I'll just put my imput for the Bruins, in no way am I saying you did bad though!  Marchand- his stats really didn't drop off that much so I would put him at a 86  Krejci- when he is healthy he is an elite player in the game, he missed so much time this season I don't think he will drop 2 because of it, I'll say an 88  Hayes- went from 11 g and 7 a being an 82 overall this year to 19 g and 17 a, so at least a little bump to 83-84ish  Spooner- this one is tough, defense stats will keep his overall down big time, he started to break out this season though, 18 points in 29 games and as a fan watching you can see just how well he played, his speed his hands his offensive IQ, all very high, 82  Connolly- even tougher... Playing 4th line minutes in Tampa he ranked 5th I think it was in the entire league for 5on5 goals per 60minutes, ahead of many other superstars, he also had some other nice fancy stats have to give him 80-81  Pastranak- 18 years old, rookie, 27 points in 46 games, in the same boat as spooner with speed but even better hands, kid was dangling in and out of defenders, 80 is a good guess for sure but might see him get an 81 maybe 82 depending on defensive stats  These are just some of my thoughts, let me know what you think!"
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,THE-IRON-STUB,3,Mon Jul 20 08:33:40 2015 UTC,"Really, Lindholm over Vatanen?"
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,Todpe,2,Mon Jul 20 12:50:33 2015 UTC,Kesler should remain a 90.  Vermette an 86.  Gio a 90.
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,DxGxAxF,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:45:43 2015 UTC,"I bumped Kesler down simply because the ratings as a whole should be dropping this year (at least, that's what I believe).  I can probably bump Vermette to an 85 and Giordano to an 89 though."
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,DavidAresta,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:50:23 2015 UTC,Accompanied with the already changes I think Andersen could be an 87 88 to help with gm modes as the ducks are always awful in mine otherwise it's pretty spot on good work I really want to see the rest
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,etrain95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:03:41 2015 UTC,"I think if Frolik is an 85 then marchand should at least remain an 86, or bump frolik down. Also, Hamilton's potential is probably greater than any D in the league right now with the team change so I think with the first roster update he will be minimum 86"

NHLHUT,3dvvwt,kapxis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:56:36 2015 UTC,I'm thinking Vatanen 85 and Gaudreau 87
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,ThunderrToast,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:35:08 2015 UTC,"86 isn't so bad for gaudreau, they'll still have him with very high speed/shot/deking etc, but any physical attributes will be quite low for him.  Although he has good awareness so maybe he will go higher in spite of that."
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,TheFantasticFinn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:48:01 2015 UTC,"I'd take Smid out completely haha. He's on the LTIR now so Engelland would probably be there instead.  I would bump Wideman down, he has a good shot and skates dece but his defence is kiiiiinda shotty. Maybe a 83? And Raymond would be probably around 79 or 80. Kid skates great but can't really do too much else and he gets completely rattled when he gets hit. Jones and Staj are definitely better than him.  Other than that, my Flames look pretty accurate :)"
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,Tkavil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:45:42 2015 UTC,A few notes for the Ducks.   Bieksa shouldn't be higher than Vatanen. Lindholm is their #1 defenceman so you can basically switch his and Fowler ratings. Silfverberg is 85 and Stewart 83.
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,LurtisCazar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:26:37 2015 UTC,I recall them saying that in general ratings will be lower so you could expect Crosby to be like a 91 or 92 and someone like getzlaf at 88 or 89
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,Quacksnooze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:58:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of these, however ill share the few one's i would change:  Despres 81>82  McGinn 81>83, great top 9 player, bad year  Ristolainen 80>82, probably Buffalo's best or atleast 2nd best defenceman going into next year  Fowler 86>84, he will get there eventually, but still plays soft and doesnt bring enough to the table to be considered a #1 quality dman on a contender (maybe why anaheim hasn't made it to the finals?, not him specifically, but lack of that true #1D man)  Hanzal 86>85, never been a scorer 85 makes him a top of his class 3rd liner  Beleskey 85>83, Average bottom 6 player, good year (the anti-McGinn)  Also Gionta should be better than legwand, legwand might be amongst the slowest non-tough guys in the league. Completely burnt out and done while gionta is still a fine player"
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,TheFantasticFinn,0,Mon Jul 20 07:42:51 2015 UTC,"Well, here's what I believe the Penguins will be rated at:  Perron (87) - Crosby (95) - Hornqvist (87)  Plotnikov (84) - Malkin (93) - Kessel (90)  Kunitz (84) - Sutter (85) - Bennett (83)  Dupuis (84) - Sundqvist (81) - Rust (79)  Määttä (86) - Letang (90)  Pouliot (83) - Cole (84)  Dumoulin (80) - Lovejoy (81)  Marc-Andre Fleury (90)  Jeff Zatkoff (82)  Keep in mind that the 4th line is still in the air, so it's pretty likely it actually won't be the same in reality."
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,Quacksnooze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:20:52 2015 UTC,"Wrong thread. But anyway, Hörnqvist, Plotnikov, Dupuis and Sundqvist won't be that high."
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,TheFantasticFinn,2,Mon Jul 20 11:33:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I just thought this would be the best place to post this instead of making a new post. And you're right about Hornqvist, my bad.  I believe Sundqvist is going to be near 80's if he makes the roster. If not, then he'll definitely would be lower. For Plotnikov I tried to get it relatively close where I believe he will land, still he's unproven so we propably won't know until season starts. I don't also believe Dupuis has lost that much edge, yeah he's been injured for the past two seasons pretty much but he's been training hard and I believe he can get close to Kunitz' level. Maybe 83 would be better for him then.  These are just my honest opinions, and I'm propably biased a bit since i'm Pens fan. Still, I didn't mean these would be absolute ratings, but rather tried to get them relatively close by a few points."
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,Quacksnooze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:39:48 2015 UTC,"Wrong thread because OP is going to make 6 threads, discussing 5 teams in each one.  Wasn't Dupuis 82 in 15? You should expect 81 or maaybe 82.   With Plotnikov you should remember that Kontiola got a 67 rating after being the leading scorer in the KHL. Something around 81-82 is more likely.  Sundqvist has never played in the NHL. Comparable guys on the Sharks (going into last season) were Goodrow, Tierney and Karlsson and they were 78s."
NHLHUT,3dvvwt,TheFantasticFinn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:48:20 2015 UTC,"Nope, Dupuis was 85 in NHL 15. Yeah, I do agree but the main reason contributing behind Kontiola's low rating is because he didn't even make the AHL roster and he's relative physique was pretty weak. I can agree on Sundqvist being in the 78's though."
NHLHUT,3dx0a4,doubleaa1232,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:02:59 2015 UTC,"Rask and Kessler if you don't mind, bonus if you have rask experience both boosted and not boosted"
NHLHUT,3dx0a4,FrankenBerryGxM,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:28:48 2015 UTC,"for goalies i wont give a ""professional review"" bc i feel telling my experience is better  sure ill start off with rask. i have boosted rask when i first got him and let me tell u that he plays absolutely awful boosted. Rask is currently 64 - 21 for me with a 1 GAA and 90% SV. He is the best goalie i have used this year.  He can stop anything from anywhere, he makes those crazy saves that would make u want to watch the replay.  rask stops most snipes and is more than decent for 1Ts, the number 1 goal he lets in are floaters.  random shots from the half often go in and its very frustrating.  overall i highly suggest using rask as he has won me games that i did not deserve and is my favourite tendy.  RYAN KESLER   i play him with the C so for reviewing purposes i took it off and played with him for 10 games.   SKATING: 7/10  Kesler is neither fast nor slow. He has enough speed that he doesnt feel the least bit sluggish, but more than likely he will get caught on a breakaway. He cant make quick turns that cogliano or kessel could. Kesler has great endurance which keeps him a solid speed whenever hes on the ice.  SHOT: 8/10  Kesler has a great shot that in my experiences is better than bergy. He can snipe it short side most games but its either a hit or miss as he misses the net often.  the number one way i score with kesler is 1Ts. He has amazing positioning and is always set up.  HANDS: 8/10  85 hands does not do him justice. in my experience kesler has a fine set of mits. he can easily windmill and through the leg deke out his opponents. his passing feels fine aswell so nothing more to say really.  CHECKING: 8/10  Kesler has good strength on the puck. Hes not the easiest to knock off but dont expect defenders to bounce off like they would on boyle. When he gets hit he often takes the opponent down with him and he can lay the hit aswell. I also noticed he gets quite a few penalties with his hits as ai.  DEFENCE: 10/10  I use him on my first PK as his poke check and defensive positioning is outstanding. he rarely gets a tripping penalty and his ai is greatly positioned always. often in the other end kesler would cause a turnover that would lead to a goal. im pretty sure he has 90 faceoffs which is amazing and shows on the dot with him winning a majority of faceoffs.  Overall i think any hut player who doesnt have kesler is missing out big time. HES 15k, for that price there is no thought required on wether to buy him or not. i also prefer him to bergy."

NHLHUT,3dwrir,Fluff118,2,Mon Jul 20 04:25:50 2015 UTC,"Marleau is a pretty good skater for his size, his 91 is like 60k I think. Or TOTY Hudler is in your price range, I got his 91 in a colletion pack and he plays well for me, very quick and agile."
NHLHUT,3dwrir,Zach0o,2,Mon Jul 20 07:19:15 2015 UTC,"I'd also say go for it. Try and buy him a bit low so you can make your coins back if you don't end up liking him too much, but Kane is a lot of fun to play with...those hands"
NHLHUT,3dwrir,Bennguins,2,Mon Jul 20 07:20:37 2015 UTC,Kane is really fun to play with but I ended up selling him for malkin. 90 MS Modano is pretty damn good for me and he's slightly cheaper
NHLHUT,3dwrir,johnmcginnis94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:06:31 2015 UTC,Any idea what Malkin is going for on One?
NHLHUT,3dwrir,johnmcginnis94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:34 2015 UTC,He floats around 200k on xbone. Plays like a bigger guy but has better skills than most big guys

NHLHUT,3dwrir,Bennguins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:53:33 2015 UTC,I have roughly 100k available
NHLHUT,3dwrir,cinntwist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:18:45 2015 UTC,I would say grab a 92+ St Louis card.  Matches play style and at 92+ I noticed a big difference over his base card.
NHLHUT,3dwrir,Deaconfrost13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:46:32 2015 UTC,By the team you have I'd say just save up cause your team is already amazing as it is. I only have 3 90+ players and I'm constantly stucj in D2 and occasionally go to D1 and get demolished. But for D2 your perfect my 4th line right now has base burakovsky and Horton. And 3rd D lime ference and dusty. With that stacked team you should still be able to win easy bud so just save up
NHLHUT,3dwrir,Rick121212,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:29:40 2015 UTC,"Personally i would swap Hossa and Zetterberg. Both very solid but I think Zetterberg is better. As for Kane, I love the guy, really fun player and would probably fit your playstyle. I would probably drop Modano or Parise for him but I think he is worth the money and a Kessel/Dats/Kane line would be deadly.   I would also recommend Keith-Pietrangelo for your 1st line D as they are unbelievably solid and I think would improve your defense."

NHLHUT,3dwh91,bthompson04,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:52:45 2015 UTC,hmm.. i thought for sure sum one here would win something cause he's giving away like 20 things... but your right guess at best thats still only a 75% chance of someone here getting 1 thing and than even slimmer that the person would post about it
NHLHUT,3dwh91,Pensfan2987,2,Mon Jul 20 03:04:58 2015 UTC,"If you assume full participation of both /r/NHLHUT users and Bacon subscribers to the giveaway AND assume that all of us here also subscribe to Bacon, then if he's doing 20 giveaways, the odds that one of us wins something are about 53.3%.

NHLHUT,3dtbft,mike7oo,7,Sun Jul 19 06:47:49 2015 UTC,You might've lost because you don't have any defensemen or goalies. Although that probably brings your rating down... Letting the ice tilt kick in. Smart thinking.

Try these guys (All special editions of course):    99 Ovenchicken  -  100 B.Cosby  -  99.9 Bane 99 Stamcoach Fiddler  -  99 Toes  -  98 Malskin 99 Lemon-Limeux  -  69 Illuminati Confirmed Gretzky  -  420 Bure 99 Getzlovakian  -  97 Bergerloin The Sirloin  -  999 Puff Nuts      Most of these guys are pretty rare and can only be found in Jumbo Rare Super Special Premium Silver™ packs that cost anywhere from 69-420 million coins. It's worth it though.

NHLHUT,3dv35t,TheFantasticFinn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:35:33 2015 UTC,such as?
NHLHUT,3dv35t,TheFantasticFinn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:38:00 2015 UTC,"Mainly,   Does everyone have to buy all the players in HUT for their NHL team? How does the draft work? Which players do you pick from? How do trades work? A players' rating does not necessarily match the price when compared to another player."
NHLHUT,3dv35t,FrankenBerryGxM,2,Sun Jul 19 19:43:14 2015 UTC,"Basically, if you want to join my league, I take you and 24 other people, put them into a draw to select a team. If your pick comes, and you select Chicago, you have the rights to all of Chicago's collection players.   There is a draft where anyone from the 5 ""Free Agency Teams"". Which will be the 5 left over teams after all 25 participant have chosen their teams. You can draft any player you want from those teams, and nobody else can use them.  However, if someone (let's say Colorado) really wants Hossa, he can trade you the rights to Landeskog and McLeod (as an example) for the rights to Hossa. After that, Chicago will no longer have the rights to Hossa, but Colorado does. So Chicago can't use him anymore."
NHLHUT,3dv35t,McSnipeAlot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:46:11 2015 UTC,"Again, if you are Chicago, you don't HAVE to use Toews, but you can only use players in Chicago's system, Free Agent pick up's, or players that you've traded for."

NHLHUT,3dukwf,D-Rock41012,3,Sun Jul 19 20:13:20 2015 UTC,Personally I'd say for the fun of it and complete randomness it would be interesting if you put every team in one hat and the 16 players competing in another hat. Draw a team and draw a player and that's their team for the tournament. Could be interesting and just post on here who their team is so the opponent knows.

NHLHUT,3duub1,KyleSpratt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:45:36 2015 UTC,But then you gotta watch all the stupid replays and the goalies always freeze the puck so instead of it being 5min periods plus a min in between for the after period replays and 30 sec intermission you are probably doubling it
NHLHUT,3duub1,Garism,2,Sun Jul 19 23:37:01 2015 UTC,What's the best way to get the puck away from their player when this happens? I always find it hard when they are just standing there which is ridiculous
NHLHUT,3duub1,mattmatt93,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:08:42 2015 UTC,"I just lift their stick. A well timed/placed poke check does the trick also. Side note, not sure if EA can detect players actually playing and penalizing them in coins. The only reason why people don't outright quit is for the coins at the end.   Like for instance if they lose by more than 5 they don't get any coins etc. is that type of punishment too steep?"

He told me to check my inbox and asked me if I received his player and still had mine. I did. Therefor I thought it worked.

NHLHUT,3ds7tv,ChelWizard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:26:01 2015 UTC,My understanding is it's based off the entire teams overall. Your offense rating is dependent on your offenses overalls. Same with goalie and defense.  I wouldn't worry about it at all tho almost everyone 4 star team you will face has just swapped their backup goalie for a low rated one and that usually takes your team from 4.5 down to 4

NHLHUT,3dtga8,NHLBeLeafer,10,Sun Jul 19 07:55:09 2015 UTC,There is no chance stamkos and malkin are under 90
NHLHUT,3dtga8,hutmaster,-3,Sun Jul 19 08:02:03 2015 UTC,Alright they can both be 90
NHLHUT,3dtga8,Pensfan2987,4,Sun Jul 19 08:04:00 2015 UTC,"Stamkos and Malkin should be around 91-92, same with Tavares"

NHLHUT,3dtga8,NoizCrew,-2,Sun Jul 19 15:43:53 2015 UTC,Sigh ok but I DID say that Tavares is 88/89/90 but I'll take off the 88 and make him just 89/90

NHLHUT,3dtga8,Bennguins,-2,Sun Jul 19 08:27:55 2015 UTC,Stammers choked in the Finals give him a 75 non shiny gold card as punishment.   Edit: he choked in the post season all around not just the finals. If I had to vote for most disappointing playoff performance it would go to Stammer. Or most disappointing finals performance can sit on Patty Kane's shoulder while he drinks sangria out of Lord Stanley
NHLHUT,3dtga8,b0nkify,4,Sun Jul 19 16:42:17 2015 UTC,"Pfft, Benn an 88? He won the Art Ross this year and you'd downgrade him? For shame!  I may be a little bit biased here"
NHLHUT,3dtga8,b0nkify,-2,Sun Jul 19 08:08:42 2015 UTC,"I can see that with your name lol, and I said Benn an 88/89, if we put every player that is similar to Benn a 90 then we would have the same ratings as last year, with like 20 guys 90+ overall. EA wants to nerf the ratings, make it more like FIFA, you know? In fifa there are only like 3 90+ overall rated players"
NHLHUT,3dtga8,5cotland,2,Sun Jul 19 08:15:41 2015 UTC,Skill parity is different in these two completely opposite sports you're comparing.
NHLHUT,3dtga8,MrMerkles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"There are no players similar to Benn, oh captain my captain.  In all a seriousness I'm fine with dumbing down ratings so we don't end up with 15 or so 99 OVR players by this time next year. Toews is great and has the cups to back it up but the guy's only put up like, what, one 70+ point season? I mean he does have those ""intangibles"" and is one of the best players without the puck but still, I'd prefer 89 over 90. And McDavid? ""Potential"" is just a word until it manifests into results. I'm sure he'll be good but starting him off at such a high rating feels cheap to me."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,FrankenBerryGxM,-1,Sun Jul 19 08:31:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's why I only put him as an 85/86 maybe, I mentioned that it was up to McDavid and how he played in the start of the season. Maybe he will tear it up like Crosby and get an 87 or 88 card or maybe he will progress slowly and be an 84 or something or maybe he just becomes a star like 86."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,TheFlappyGiraffe,3,Sun Jul 19 08:38:28 2015 UTC,"Where did you hear that EA is lowering the ratings of everyone?   Not trying to bash, just read an article about NHL 16 where they stated that ratings are still ""sky high"" like in NHL 15. I can try to find it if you want.    If they are lowering the rating,s I agree with most of yours. Stammer and Geno should be 90s IMO. Benn also should be at least an 89 since he won the Art Ross and is a pretty complete player."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,TheFlappyGiraffe,-4,Sun Jul 19 16:54:22 2015 UTC,They are the same? I heard from a bunch of people that EA are nerfing the ratings.... I'll try to find an exact source for you too.
NHLHUT,3dtga8,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Sun Jul 19 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"Here's the article I read.  Could be two different versions of the game. I think at the E3 demo that they used the same stats from NHL 15, but the overalls were different."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:09:05 2015 UTC,Tanner Glass 98. If he would have scored 1 more goal then id give him the 99 but he didnt so 98 it is.

NHLHUT,3dtga8,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:20:03 2015 UTC,I hope they lower the ratings anyway. Gives a little more room for the special cards....Didn't like all the different 98s they had to put out
NHLHUT,3dtga8,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:17:00 2015 UTC,"I think only having 3 people 90+ would be awesome, I don't think a team of 88's should be as easily attainable as it is."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,Fer6y,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:00:08 2015 UTC,"But then again the players that I listed as 87/88/89 are just the stars, there are still a lot of other NHL players who will be near the middle."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,Fer6y,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:48:34 2015 UTC,"Ben should be 90+, he led the league in points last season."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,FredTheKing2000,-4,Sun Jul 19 16:27:37 2015 UTC,"Like I SAID, EA are toning down the player ratings by a lot, ya can't have every body that's a star be 90+ overall like NHL 15. Benn deserves a 90 at most, I'm pretty sure Benn isn't as good as Malkin or Stamkos or Kane."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,TheFantasticFinn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:35:24 2015 UTC,"He was in 2014-15, the season they go off of for overalls."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,TheFantasticFinn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:14:05 2015 UTC,"For my own team.  Forwards Pacioretty 89 Plekanec 86 Gallagher 86 Galchenyuk 85 Eller 84 Desharnais 84 Kassian 83 Smith - Pelly 81 Bournival 80 Mitchell 78 De La Rose 78 Flynn 77 Defensmen Subban 90 Markov 86 Petry 85 Beaulieu 83 Gilbert 82 Emelin 82 Tinordi 80 Pateryn 80 Goaltending Price 93-94 (due to Hart Trophy boost)  Tokarski 80 I don't know what EA is doing. They are pretty sporadic and switch up ratings on a yearly basis, but I think this would work if they used last years rating system."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,TheFantasticFinn,-3,Sun Jul 19 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"For Price idk about 94, 92-93 is good, Paccioretty should be an 87/88, I mean Kessel is an 88 so... Subban is good although maybe he should be 89/90... Just my opinions"
NHLHUT,3dtga8,Cammi_Granato,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:03:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Price was 92 before the Hart, so I assumed he would get a bump of 1 or 2. And Subban was a 90 last year and had a better season this year. So I was assuming he would remain the exact same. No reason to drop him. Also Pacioretty put up another high scoring year, so it wouldn't surprise me if they gave him an 89, considering he was the leading winger among Selke votes as well. Don't know if they factor that in though. An Kessel was a 90 last year I believe."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,TheFantasticFinn,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:28:19 2015 UTC,"I think Subban would drop 1 or 2 overalls because I heard EA are nerfing the overalls for every player. And I know Kessel was a 90 last year, in my predictions he is going to be an 88 so Paccioretty should be like 87/88. If EA were using last year's ""scale"" then Pacc would probably be an 89 or a 90 and Kessel 90 or a 91."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,Cammi_Granato,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:01:05 2015 UTC,"I personally think Pacioretty and Kessel should be equal ratings. I mean I'd argue Pacioretty is a better goal scorer, albeit not by much. However Kessel is overall a better offensive player and Pacioretty is a better defensive player. So it all evens out. I'd say they are both 89's. Also where did hear that? Because there has been no word at all of that. Do you have a source."
NHLHUT,3dtga8,TheFantasticFinn,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:17:03 2015 UTC,"Not really a source, just something I heard from various NHL youtubers. Maybe it was a hoax / I heard wrong idk, but it certainly does make sense to nerf player ratings to me. There are like 20 90 overall players in NHL 15"

NHLHUT,3dsvfq,tornfightstrap,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:19:55 2015 UTC,"Doesn't make a lick of difference but the best goalies in the game are hybrids. Standup is an old school style and only good goalie that uses it is brodeur. Butterfly let in less low/mid shots, more bar down goals go in.   Just grab a goalie you like, in the end it's all about your defense, you can slap just about anyone in net and do well.  Edit: fat fingers"
NHLHUT,3dsvfq,ChelWizard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:27:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that defense is 99 percent of the battle, but I'm just trying to learn more about the really detailed ins and outs of building a team since I'm having fun with that, and goaltending is the only thing that has stumped me because it is not something that is easily tested.  I know that a lot of people talk about height as if it has a huge effect on a goaltender's in game performance. Which is part of the reason why I wondered if style would have an effect beyond overall.  If Hybrids are the best goalies, wouldn't that mean that it does make a difference?"
NHLHUT,3dsvfq,quigs17,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:40:16 2015 UTC,Well think about this.  You could have a stand up that never let's in top shelf but struggles low a butterfly who never let's in low shots but struggles high or a hybrid who is decent at both but not perfect at either

NHLHUT,3dryy7,bthompson04,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:00:08 2015 UTC,Lol. That's awesome.
NHLHUT,3dryy7,bthompson04,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:01:27 2015 UTC,"But in all seriousness, it gives people something to complain about. EA gives players many ways to build teams. Some guys get lucky with packs, some are incredibly good at working the market. Others choose to put real money into the game. Your team, your method. It can get a little frustrating when the other team is so good since the AI is so disciplined and can be a little overpowered.  But it doesn't necessarily make the guy controlling them any good. I beat a dude today with all TOTY players (I'm assuming, since they happened to be all players with TOTY cards) with a team full of nothing but gold base cards, not one of which was a 90 or better."
NHLHUT,3dryy7,anonmarmot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:06:43 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm just tired of replying to them. Most of my players are base ( Legend ) but I don't have anything too crazy. I got lucky with some collection pulls and pack luck. Sold something, added some coins via real money and bam this is the team I ended up with."

NHLHUT,3dryy7,Aciearl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:25:40 2015 UTC,Assuming someone's entire team is made up of TOTY cards is a bit much dude.  lol.  Just saying

NHLHUT,3dryy7,FrankenBerryGxM,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:04:40 2015 UTC,"I can't confirm, obviously. It was just an assumption because every single guy on his team also has a TOTY card."
NHLHUT,3dryy7,FrankenBerryGxM,2,Sun Jul 19 00:34:09 2015 UTC,Never seen anyone have both bergy and Kesler in their lineup but neither at C. That's sacrilege
NHLHUT,3dryy7,FrankenBerryGxM,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:38:10 2015 UTC,I keep them in my line up mainly for PK purposes. I find Kesler performs better for me on the wing.
NHLHUT,3drygo,JGilroy74,3,Sat Jul 18 21:51:32 2015 UTC,"If you go from 15 to 16, you get packs as a reward. 20k pucks is 1 pack, 50 players in your collection is a pack, and 50 games played is a pack too.  You can only get 30 packs, 10 for each area, so 200k is 10 packs, 500 players is 10 packs, and 500 games played is another 10 packs"

NHLHUT,3dru4z,OneEyedMcGee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:20:29 2015 UTC,Seems like a lot of cards were steals lately or people are just tryingvto sell very high.  I seen it on some of the cards I was looking for the last few days.  Like double the lps.
NHLHUT,3dqntt,Symys,3,Sat Jul 18 14:52:55 2015 UTC,"I had Mov Ryan for a awhile, and let me start off by letting you know Ryan is one of my favorite American players so this might be a bit biased.   For me he was a really good, solid, all around player. The type of player that doesn't particularly excel at any one thing, but does the job with everything above average.  His speed in my opinion is not what it says on his card, he seems slightly slower than what his rating suggests.  His wrist shot was great, slap shot not so great, and he would occasionally miss the net for me, but not often and nothing crazy. The upside to his shooting was he would (I'd say 6/10 shots) rip off an Ovi style snipe with a fast and accurate wrist shot.   He was a great passer, and I could dangle all day with him so hands were never an issue.  He also laid down some MONSTER hits for me while I had him. Hits that I didn't expect him to make, and leaving players injured.  His defense is passable, best I can say is I never noticed it, which to me means he had no glaring issues but he made no standout defensive plays.  So to sum it up I payed 175k for him and I felt his Mov card was worth it, and he stayed on my team, on the first line, up until I did my giveaway."
NHLHUT,3dqntt,GetBourqued,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:53:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I felt about him, probably not as fast as you think but will add some much needed size to that line"
NHLHUT,3dqntt,Zach0o,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:37:00 2015 UTC,I've used both TOTY Ryan and base Kessel and honestly Kessel was so much better for me. Still use him.
NHLHUT,3dqntt,leflur,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:18:44 2015 UTC,I had toty ryan for maybe 20 games. In those 20 he had 2 assists an that was it. I found that he was invisible every game an his shot the reason why he's out there I found to be very average maybe even less so.
NHLHUT,3dqntt,atheis09,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:23:56 2015 UTC,I like him a lot
NHLHUT,3dqntt,Sir-Nicholas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:53:35 2015 UTC,One of those players I didn't have much success with but fear playing.  For whatever reason I seem to give up more goals to Ryan than anybody else.  Something about those Sens since Anderson is one of the goalies I struggle the most against too.
NHLHUT,3dqntt,Hayabusa85,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:03:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for rhe feedback guys
NHLHUT,3dqntt,moistmahogany1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:35:57 2015 UTC,Base ryan did really well for me. His TOTY has been nothing short of disappointing.

NHLHUT,3dqvv5,DOPE_ASFUCK_USERNAME,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:54:44 2015 UTC,"Gibson was too small for me.  Anything upstairs is a goal.  Sounds cliche, but he was pretty bad.  Thomas was good for me in some offline HUT games.  Haven't used the other 2 very much."
NHLHUT,3dqvv5,JGilroy74,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:48:31 2015 UTC,Forgive my ignorance but why do you mention maintaining a 4 star rating? Does the start rating of a team really matter?
NHLHUT,3dqvv5,Voide03,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:13:59 2015 UTC,I doubt it has much effect but it seems that I match up against less stacked teams. When I had a 4.5 star team I couldn't even stay in D1 but now I never drop out and I've won the title twice. Not saying I've improved due to the 4 star team but now it's a mental thing for me
NHLHUT,3dqvv5,Voide03,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:29:00 2015 UTC,It might be the same for me as well. I boosted a goalie which I hardly ever do and I ended up having a 4.5 star team as a result. I haven't won a game since.

It sucks there aren't any major changes aside from play a friend, but they really needed the other game modes to get back on track. Aside from offline season and play a friend, I expect HUT in 16 to be very similar to 15.

NHLHUT,3dqucb,ShowelingSnow,5,Sat Jul 18 16:06:33 2015 UTC,"Okay getting downvoted gives you negative karma, visible on the top right hand corner of your profile. I'm just saying, saying ""hey this guy is downvoting me, is only gonna make him downvote you more."
NHLHUT,3dqucb,IYolkTheGarden,-3,Sat Jul 18 16:13:13 2015 UTC,"yes i pointed out already that i seen the number.  getting closer to answering that question - does it actually mean anything??? lmao.  (if it doesnt... then why would i care if he downvotes me, if it does then the mods should probably ban people who just downvote because they get butthurt, no?)"
NHLHUT,3dqucb,IYolkTheGarden,3,Sat Jul 18 16:17:23 2015 UTC,Its internet points you really can't use them for anything you're not gonna put them on a resume nor brag to friends about and the only way people can see how much karma you have is to go to your profile i believe which many people at that point really could care even less
NHLHUT,3dqucb,mike7oo,-3,Sat Jul 18 16:23:47 2015 UTC,"lol no i know.  but if i were to go negative, does my account get locked, i cant post or something negative happens because someone just got mad over nothing and decided to downvote everything ive ever posted?  thats all im asking"
NHLHUT,3dqucb,anonmarmot,2,Sat Jul 18 16:25:09 2015 UTC,"No, if you go negative nothing (as far as I know) will happen. All that's gonna happen is that your karma will be negative. That may change the way other users look at you but nothing will happen to your account"

NHLHUT,3dpnyz,EatYoTots,2,Sat Jul 18 12:12:43 2015 UTC,My guess is because he just noticed it.  I just noticed it to the other day myself but didn't think much of it.  But I'm thinking you just want to troll and try to think you are scoring points in your ear against ea.

I'd love it if we could have some sort of quick view of our current lineup from within the auction house. It would be nice while shopping to be able to see which positions could be improved.

I've never had a big problem with the time it takes to switch between menus. Sure it could be a little faster but it's not bad. The grid idea is perfect. I've always thought having number placeholders was the perfect solution to the horrible left/right system they have now. How hard would it be to do this? Would save soooo much fucking time it's crazy. You could set a bin of 955,450 in a matter of 5 seconds vs 30 seconds+"

NHLHUT,3do0th,ChelWizard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:41:39 2015 UTC,Rinne seems to be more about quickness as dubnyk is more about taking up alot of space. Rinne seems to move much quicker as dubnyk uses his body to take away chances imo.

NHLHUT,3dp6uj,bthompson04,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:46:46 2015 UTC,This is a GIGANTIC problem in this game. The AI is brutal in front of the net. You basically need to be diligent in not chasing the puck carrier around and trying to block the pass with whatever guy you're controlling. Occasionally I'll throw a stick lift on the guy in front so he needs to re-position himself.
NHLHUT,3dp6uj,bthompson04,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:02:53 2015 UTC,I can't stick lift results in a penalty 9 out if 10 times so I try and not use that lol  anyways hope they fix it in 16

NHLHUT,3dnn3u,IYolkTheGarden,2,Fri Jul 17 19:54:12 2015 UTC,"I think the whole fiasco is ridiculous. So much shit throwing from all directions. Yeah Bruins was in the middle of it but at the same time people like Russell and HutGod kept egging him on. Also, I feel that if someone's accused of something that would result with them getting thrown out of the tournament then some form of proof should be required."
NHLHUT,3dnn3u,Bennguins,3,Fri Jul 17 20:16:29 2015 UTC,"HUTGod literally is doing his job as a satire joke account, that's just how it is. The only one I see at fault for egging on is JR tbh."

NHLHUT,3dnn3u,hutmaster,2,Fri Jul 17 21:39:31 2015 UTC,If a satire account is shit-talking then why would it be taken seriously?
NHLHUT,3dnn3u,Bennguins,2,Fri Jul 17 20:34:50 2015 UTC,"Look at the guy's upvotes on his negative comments directed at Bruins. I'm not saying he should be taken seriously but at the same time that's not an excuse to add fuel to the fire. If we're gonna get hung up on the whole satire account thing, that account was created to mess with hutmaster. In that capacity, the shit talking makes sense as its part of the joke, but outside of that it looks like regular old shit talking to me."
NHLHUT,3dnn3u,Bennguins,0,Fri Jul 17 20:44:19 2015 UTC,Maybe the upvotes weren't for the negative comments but because some people enjoy the character? An account named HutGod making comments like that to an account named Hutmaster should point to a joke. Not his fault that Bruins didn't realize.

NHLHUT,3dnn3u,Smac205,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:23:35 2015 UTC,Yes I understand the concept of a joke account and its appeal. My point was I don't think it makes much of a difference when it came to heckling Bruins like JR was
NHLHUT,3dnn3u,13igbadw0lf,2,Fri Jul 17 22:30:07 2015 UTC,Pretty sure HutGod is a joke account and while Johnny was egging him on he didn't need to be a dick to everyone else.
NHLHUT,3dnn3u,hutmaster,3,Fri Jul 17 20:20:59 2015 UTC,"Joke account or not he was still taking jabs at Bruins, as was everyone really. I mean, a large portion of the comment responses in the post I looked through were people actively rooting against him or cheering when he got knocked out, plus all the shit talk coming from both sides. It's not like Johnny was the only user poking the bear. (haha get it, do you all get my joke? Please tell me that you get my joke. Please.)"
