DaftPunk,3e1qoa,The-Disco-Phoenix,8,Tue Jul 21 13:21:58 2015 UTC,Maybe it's the different releases of each CD (American and European releases often have different manufacturers and stuff).
DaftPunk,3e1qoa,weso9980,6,Tue Jul 21 14:21:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, and maybe they have bonus tracks like the Japanese  edition of RAM"

At the time I didn't know who Daft Punk was, but I knew I had to satisfy my craving for that funky rhythmic slamming bass.  I heard One More Time at a Sonic after school one day in 2005.  That was inception.  The rest of the year I would listen to the dance and electronic Yahoo music station, my secret obsession as I wasn't sure how my friends would feel about music that was inherent to LGBT culture.  Eventually One More Time came on and now I have a name for the artist.  Then a while later Around the World came on.  That was the one that made it solid for me.  I looked up everything I could on Daft Punk and everything I read about them and everything I listened to spoke to me.  For the next two years every day before and after school I listened to Daft Punk.  I'll never forget how I fell in love with Daft Punk."

The first time I heard Daft Punk was when a guest radio DJ spun ""Da Funk"" on a hip hop station, and the main radio host blurted out ""I-- is that house?"" Years later Discovery came out and I listened to it through a friend. To me it sounded like a multi-artist greatest hits album. The moment I realized that ""Da Funk"" and those Discovery songs were released by the same artist, my fandom was locked in for life."
DaftPunk,3dykea,jhsounds,5,Mon Jul 20 18:29:11 2015 UTC,Well at least the station understood how DP said Da Funk sounded like Hip Hop

Eventually I saw alive 2007 in the comments and decided to give it a look. I think most people have heard a bit of daft punk even if they are not fans, as had I, but that concert totally blew me away. Songs that I loved were different and cut up with even more amazing songs I hadn't. It was a wonderful process to go through their back catalogue and see what came from where and what was made just for the shows and how it all fit. I can't wait to see if they do an alive 2017."

I think a couple of months later I saw it on the internet, can't remember where. After that I listened to HBFS, and around the world, because those were the songs I knew from the radio.  A friend of mine knew Daft Punk better than I did, and sometimes we talked about it. He came to me when Get Lucky was released. At the time I only listened to that song. I think it was half a year later that I discovered that it was not the only song on the album. Now I have their complete discography on my phone (including live performances)."

Whatever the case, I actually thought the song was really weird and annoying, but it was catchy.  Over the next several years I heard songs like ""Around the World"" and ""Technologic"" and found out they were all by the same band.  As I learned more about them I thought their whole concept was neat (robots making techno music) and just gradually became a bigger and bigger fan."

In any case, after Kanye sampled their song, I remembered the music video for One More Time and listened to a lot of their stuff in this grand binge of the Robots.

I had also found out they did Around The World which I heard in a commercial for Raving Rabbids 2, which had also clicked with me too, as well as HBFS. It wasn't until i heard Too Long that i immediately fell in love with them. At first i had only heard the beginning, laughing at the fact Romanthony (who i thought was white at first and just a singer beforehand) sounded like he was saying ""tits"", but as I listened more to the song it wasn't until the middle of the song that I just submitted myself to them. It was unlike anything I've ever heard or felt before. Those magical synths, the beat, Romanthony's soulful vocals, the soul in general, it was the greatest experience of my life. If it wasn't for this song I wouldn't have stayed to listen to DP, or french house/house in general. They've opened me up to so much and I couldn't be more grateful for that."

It was so simple, yet so entrancing. Eventually I just listened to all of their albums..and then I when I heard how masterfully they combined their sounds in Alive 2007 pretty much cemented them as one of my favorite artists of all time.

Also see what you mean but I find it a bit weird that over the course their entire career they've never played some songs. I know High Fidelity has some unorthodox parts but when it's at its peak energy it's pretty great, same with Phoenix.  I know they hold themselves to a high standard so maybe they just choose not to play songs that barely made it onto the album."
DaftPunk,3dnuhq,mrhoosteen,5,Fri Jul 17 23:27:49 2015 UTC,"Idk they've said Phoenix is an important track, and they probably wanted to play Fidelity live but it was impossible to recreate on the samplers?"

DaftPunk,3dnuhq,JoeyBACON,2,Sat Jul 18 16:19:32 2015 UTC,"I mean, they've really only had 2 sets (assuming the 1997 tour used a similar set for each show like 2007).  In 2007 I think they were trying to feature as many songs as they could. Phoenix was actually featured here (listen closely)   and they did feature Revolution 909 in the alive 1997 sets like you said.  I don't think DP is opposed to playing any track live as long as they can make it work. (I'm not trying to hear Teachers live tbh)"
DaftPunk,3dnuhq,mrhoosteen,2,Mon Jul 20 16:46:14 2015 UTC,"They've only released 2 of their sets as albums, but they've played a lot of sets, most of which are recorded and accessible.  I did hear the percussion from Phoenix in there, which I hadn't noticed before. I want to hear those string hits though, so much energy!  Also, I think Teachers could be cool live if mixed with something, I'm sure they'd make it work. I'd also love to hear Emotion mixed too, love that song."

HAA is weird in the fact that it's in this weird zone of being detailed at times while also having a strong emphasis on copy and pasted loops.

DaftPunk,3dduua,TehKazlehoff,3,Wed Jul 15 16:06:50 2015 UTC,Sorenzo did his giveaway here too... idk why you guys downvoting me
DaftPunk,3dduua,Nikolaki8,2,Wed Jul 15 17:31:48 2015 UTC,"This. This is a quality creator of helmets that is giving away free items.  Would it be more appropriate to be posted as a self post with the instagram link? Yes.  Is this an acceptable bending of the rules? I think so. But, I welcome disagreement."
DaftPunk,3dduua,Rexcinerum,-1,Thu Jul 16 03:24:50 2015 UTC,"Probably because:  a) Sorenzo makes extremely high quality products which look much better than these.  and  b) This giveaway is only for the helmet kit, not the finished chrome version.   I know it's hypocritical but this is most likely why."
DaftPunk,3dduua,Nikolaki8,3,Wed Jul 15 21:28:50 2015 UTC,"Why would you say my helmets are of bad quality? Canal + and BBC used my guyman for the documentary and other prop makers from rpf complimented me for my work. I love Sorenzo's work, but what you said there is straight up rude and short-sided... I don't know how long you've been a daft punk fan for, but Artfunk and Sorenzo both gave out kits before. And just because I decided to GIVE AWAY FOR FREE not the most expensive item I sell, doesn't mean my GIVE AWAY is worth nothing."
DaftPunk,3dduua,HobbesClone,3,Wed Jul 15 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"Not sure why he's insulting your products. I don't own one, but I've seen them.  They are DEFINITELY quality products. Not every Daft Punk fan knows about the prop-making world and the artistry that goes into making these items."
DaftPunk,3d84dt,dovaharp,25,Tue Jul 14 06:37:55 2015 UTC,A lot of these are great but that Minion one is just plain awful.

DaftPunk,3de0bq,Ready_For_The_Robots,4,Wed Jul 15 15:46:05 2015 UTC,"They are most likely doing a remix of Random Access Memories, in this interview of Antoine Chabert https://youtu.be/MI3UH2Fq6O0 (aka Chab), the guy who did most of the mastering on RAM, he says accidentaly at 19:04 (translated from French ofc) ""For the mastering we go even further, because the remixs are made in the studio Gang (the studio in front of his studio), we try to don't have any support between the two consoles (the studio's and his) so we run cables across the (arenas ?  lol) yard to do that.

I want them to take that time to make yet another masterpiece.  Also they are more than likely getting ready for another world tour in 2016/2017."

DaftPunk,3de0bq,sackman66mode,21,Wed Jul 15 15:17:19 2015 UTC,What makes you so sure? It may be unlikely but it's definitely not impossible.
DaftPunk,3de0bq,sigmastorm7,5,Wed Jul 15 15:45:05 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but I really agree with this guy. People on here keep throwing the fact that the TWO TOURS THEY HAVE EVER DONE were ten years apart as if that's concrete evidence that it's going to happen in another ten years. Think of it like this: look at the numbers 2, and 4. Depending on how you look at it, the next number could be 6 or 8, IF IT EVEN FOLLOWS A PATTERN."

DaftPunk,3de0bq,Sirius_Crack,-13,Wed Jul 15 15:44:24 2015 UTC,Because Daft Punk doesn't give a fuck about you and what you want.

DaftPunk,3de0bq,mrhoosteen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:26:31 2015 UTC,"While I agree, let's be realistic here. It's very optimistic to think that Daft Punk have zero interest or drive in making more money."
DaftPunk,3de0bq,Nikolaki8,0,Thu Jul 16 04:20:25 2015 UTC,If they cared about your money they would've been touring non stop since 1997

DaftPunk,3d9qoo,GoodEnough4aPoke,2,Tue Jul 14 16:34:32 2015 UTC,"It comes on in between artist unknown - ""And Da Beat Goes On"" and DJ Funk & Gerald - ""Hold Up"". It may not be an actual track. It does get me bumpin' though."
DaftPunk,3d9qoo,UpYourFidelity,3,Tue Jul 14 16:37:28 2015 UTC,So my guess are because to be honest I'm not sure. Dj Deeon - Extacy Green Velvet - Fake & Phony I'd say it's Fake & Phony because you can hear a 'hey' vocal in the background which to me sounds like the vocals in this track. I hope this helps.

DaftPunk,3d7b8u,612WolfAvenue,5,Tue Jul 14 11:48:43 2015 UTC,"R.A.M. and Discovery have very pop-oriented structures, with verses and choruses. The majority of people don't care for music that strays too far from that idea, plus not as many people are fans of mechanical music. It just sounds very different from normal instruments.   Homework era Daftpunk isn't anymore real than R.A.M. era Daftpunk, plus people are allowed to listen and like whatever they want. I don't like Homework or HAA, but I don't think they're bad albums. They just aren't for me."
DaftPunk,3d7b8u,Nikolaki8,-4,Tue Jul 14 03:20:24 2015 UTC,I feel exactly as you do on HAA. It was to basic. Homework was more experimental and now it hasn't aged well.
DaftPunk,3d7b8u,Nikolaki8,3,Tue Jul 14 11:50:47 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree. If anything, people are blinded by love for the old albums and just dismiss RAM as being 'pop music'."
DaftPunk,3d7b8u,110010001,0,Tue Jul 14 05:54:11 2015 UTC,I don't even think of it as pop music. I don't understand why people call it that. It seems to be more based on the older rock hits of the 80-90 with a Daft Punk feel.

DaftPunk,3cupyh,Rallerboy888,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:57:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I blindly assumed it to be that. I was on mobile, so I couldn't really listen to it.

And about how you talked about replicating it: I meant I tried changing the tempo and length of the very final ""After All"" of the song to match the quicker one. Sorry for forgetting to mention that. My question was if anyone has been able to isolate that quicker varient or if anyone has a full isolated vocal version of the song. Much appreciated anyways."

Over time, the entire screen would eventually be filled with pictures Newman. At the time I thought the idea was funny for some reason and was pretty proud of myself for coming up with it.   Then I did a search for it on YouTube and some bastard had the exact same idea as me and had already done it. It's eery how similar both our ideas were. The worst part is there is no way I can ever prove that this story is true."
DaftPunk,3crxk6,Nikolaki8,3,Fri Jul 10 14:06:21 2015 UTC,"Well I found your youtube comment on the ""Newman after all"" video. This gives credence to your claim. Though not complete proof, I'm going to choose to believe you outright."

I don't think that Alive 2007 being performed when it was gives any insight as to when the material was actually produced. For all we know elements of that show were produced during the Discovery or even the Homework sessions. With how cohesive Alive 2007 is and with the fact that Discovery didn't get a tour, it really wouldn't surprise me if they truly spent that much time putting a live show together. I'm sure they're working on something now as I'm sure they've never ceased their creative process but to say that they're working on anything specific is just baseless assumption."

DaftPunk,3cnqmo,Nikolaki8,3,Fri Jul 10 08:00:35 2015 UTC,"""Mastering was done from the analogue tapes by Bob Ludwig in Portland, Maine, while some additional mastering work was also done in Paris by Antoine Chabert at Translab. After all this time and effort, not to mention a bank balance drained of a million dollars, the Daft Punk team were understandably precious about their final master tapes, so Peter Franco, with the help of Daft Punk crew member Sam Cooper, offered to drive them from Los Angeles to the East Coast, in a move worthy of a Hollywood road movie. ""It was the only way to make sure that nobody else would touch these masters,” explains Franco, ""and that they wouldn't go through radar or metal detectors and so on. We had put so much energy into this project that we didn't want to hand it over to a courier company. It would have been like handing over your own child. We were just really happy to have come this far, through a process that had been great fun. There was no point at which we felt lost or scared. Everything we were doing felt really right, and everybody was on the same page. We were all the time in the studio with great people and great musicians, and it always felt like a family setting, like going to a summer camp with a lot of really fun and interesting people. It was a magical experience, and I think this filtered through in the end product.”  SOURCE:  http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul13/articles/daft-punk.htm"

DaftPunk,3cmbfj,franciscocrz,2,Thu Jul 9 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"I saw them here at the DNA lounge about two years ago. Gnarly venue (but its OUR gnarly local venue) but the vibes were great. The bring out this mini Pyramid that they sit on top of very similar to the Alive tour and pretty much just play the Alive 2007 mix song for song in order like the album. Right near the end they dig into a bit of the TRON soundtrack with a special ""visual"" surprise.  I saw them about 2 weeks after RAM was released and they snuck in a few songs, but nothing seriously mixed or anything. I am sure by know RAM has been incorporated much better.  Overall its a good time for any Daft Punk fan, if you are about the music, its a chance to see it played through a decent set of speakers with other fellow fans which makes for a great time no matter how DIY the setup may be."

DaftPunk,3ci3kk,rustypete89,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:33:06 2015 UTC,"Might have been, but his ""mixing"" was a bigger portion of the song then either of the songs he were sampling. I felt it made the song pretty dull."
DaftPunk,3ci3kk,PanRagon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:30:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't disagree with you. The two songs have potential to be a great mash-up and he really missed the mark.
DaftPunk,3ci3kk,rustypete89,2,Wed Jul 8 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"Um, no. There's clearly a song that's not either One More Time or MSBWY."
DaftPunk,3ci3kk,The-Disco-Phoenix,0,Wed Jul 8 12:15:12 2015 UTC,"Um, there's clearly a remixed sample of Stardust that you're attributing to another song.  Like... When people make mash-ups they generally list all the major tracks sampled. If it's not listed, it's most likely just mixing."
DaftPunk,3ci3kk,rustypete89,2,Wed Jul 8 18:00:12 2015 UTC,sigh.  I heard One More Time. I heard Stardust. I heard both of them in this version.  I was asking about the chord/arpeggio that starts in the beginning and continues throughout. It turns out it's the Re-Discovery remix of One More Time. So the song posted is a mash-up of that remix and MSBWY.

DaftPunk,3cipmf,multitrackmaster,6,Wed Jul 8 05:37:33 2015 UTC,"This is copied from my post here:  ""It was good. Not amazing, not terrible, but good.   The main issue I had with the film was that it didn't explore the construction and production of their albums nearly enough, it focussed more about the legacy and reception of them. I really enjoyed Nile Rodgers' and Peter Franco's segments because they actually explained what went into the creation and development of RAM, however even those parts weren't that in depth.   The other issue I had with the film were the useless candidates for the interviews. Don't even get me started on why they even bothered to get Kanye for the movie if they aren't even going to ask him questions about the duo. The most relevant thing he said the entire time was something along the lines of 'Daft Punk is a cool name'. Talk about your collaboration with them for God sake's. I read an interview with A-Track that wasn't even about Daft Punk and he provided a tonne of insight about the production of 'Stronger'. He probably would've actually been interested in commenting about their music unlike Kanye was in this film.   In Kanye's defence I feel like the interviewers weren't very good in what questions they were asking the interviewees. I have little to not recollection on what Paul Williams had to say and Skrillex provided information that is already readable on his Wikipedia article. Similarly, I agree that Eric Chédeville and Pete Tong were excellent in the film, providing a good balance between the anonymity, shyness, and humanity that the duo embody.  All in all, the film was well constructed in it's pacing and editing, as a BBC documentary usually is. It was interesting to watch, engaged me for most of the viewing time and did provide some new information that I personally didn't know about the duo before.""  7/10"

DaftPunk,3ccsdy,daftpunkies,14,Mon Jul 6 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"I like the one that they did at the actual Grammys more.  This one is a great performance, but it's lacking atmosphere and is... dare I say it... robotic.  The one at the actual Grammys wasn't perfect, but it was still fantastic. There were people dancing everywhere and everyone was having a good time. It's not often you see Beyonce and Jay Z and Katy Perry and Steven Tyler and Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono and Ringo Starr all dancing to song at the same time. It was just like a big party and made me feel happy that music can make everyone happy like that."
DaftPunk,3ccsdy,JoeyBACON,7,Tue Jul 7 00:53:58 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong but I think Pharell rushed Steve in the live performance. In this rehearsal, there's a whole 4 bars of intro before Steve sings and in the live performance, Pharell cues Steve as if he was already late.   I love the live performance so much more but this gave me some closure as to the why the sloppiness happened at the start."
DaftPunk,3ccsdy,Kenissis,2,Tue Jul 7 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"Hmm I just listened to both performances at the same spot and it sounds like to me that Pharrell adds an extra ""we're up all night to get lucky"".

DaftPunk,3ccsdy,NazDaBaz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:24:03 2015 UTC,Yes. Just like the Grammys in 2008. Probably the result of DP's perfectionism.
DaftPunk,3ccsdy,thefourofusaredying,0,Tue Jul 7 14:30:50 2015 UTC,"See from 3:50 to 4:05. Stevie is playing the keyboard, but not much is heard. Thomas seems to be doing something, and suddenly the keyboard is way too loud. Thomas head goes up, almost as if he is saying: ""oh fuck, that was me"".  I've both of these movies tons of times now and analysed them to the bone, I guess. I used to think Guyman is ""playing"" notes, but since he's controlling the Behringer BCR-2000's in his corner, there's not much notes to play on there. It looks as if he's doing something, and finger-drumming in the mean time, in between pressing buttons or turning knobs on the BCR. He's not doing this finger-drumming in the rehearsal, probably because he's less nervous."
DaftPunk,3ccsdy,ChiIIout,0,Tue Jul 7 15:10:58 2015 UTC,No one finger-drums in a performance dude. There are loops for that. Which is all they do. Mashup loops/tracks and trigger different ones at different times.

DaftPunk,3ccsdy,The_Elder_Steak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:27:55 2015 UTC,How are pushing buttons to trigger samples any different from someone pressing keys on a keyboard to produce a note?
DaftPunk,3ccsdy,Nikolaki8,3,Tue Jul 7 09:40:19 2015 UTC,Were they really sampling it live in this performance? I thought people were saying the button pushing was random and inconsistant.
DaftPunk,3ccsdy,PanRagon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:41:21 2015 UTC,"It's not. You're right. If someone like Madeon went on to a talk show, I wouldn't be critical because he is renowned for doing live performances on a MIDI controller. But Daft Punk in this video, and most electronic performers in TB broadcastings, don't do it live. Why would you? It's safer to key it in and make it prerecorded. Daft Punk wasn't pushing anything that contributed to the song or added any layers in this. Then DJs in TV broadcasts tend to stand behind a mixer and pretend to do something for one song, but that doesn't make sense because the essence of mixing is too mix multiple songs for a coherent and fluid set. That's largely why I'm critical."

DaftPunk,3c5htv,koshtex,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:25:10 2015 UTC,"The riff you are speaking is not a sample, it was made made using the roland tb-303. The riff from the beginning of the vid was being played out live on the 303."

Always knew the Punks were total gearheads, they work those drum loops hard. Can't wait for DaftLegends to upload more footage.

DaftPunk,3c5psh,DreadPiratesRobert,5,Sun Jul 5 03:22:05 2015 UTC,"sample is... Claude François ""Cette Année Là""   fun fact: one day I sample the same part to make a french house music, without knowing Thomas did the same before. A friend told me I sampled Colosus, I told him no I sampled Cloclo (as we call Claude Francois in French), then my friend told me Thomas also sampled that track, I was like: ""so cool"""

He made a remix called ""Fuck Technologic"" where he used the technique to make the technologic acapella sounds like ""fuck it fuck it..."" Then in Bercy Daft Punk were doing the same !! (In 2006 they were doing Touch It Touch it.. instead of Fuck it)"

DaftPunk,3bygjr,Riederbirk,9,Fri Jul 3 11:45:04 2015 UTC,It was more of a spur of the moment club thing. I don't think it was ever intended to be a consistent new group.
DaftPunk,3bygjr,IrrelevantLeprechaun,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:08:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed, pretty much what I was going to say. Like a one-off collaboration, which they gave themselves a group name for on the record, but they probably didn't have any intention of making any more tracks together, at least they didn't have plans to."
DaftPunk,3bygjr,spanieldaniel,4,Fri Jul 3 20:40:44 2015 UTC,"I remember reading an Attack magazine interview with Alan Braxe that said he didn't want to pursue the Stardust fame, that could have been another factor."

DaftPunk,3bygjr,110010001,2,Thu Jul 9 10:19:17 2015 UTC,"Same reason any DJs in the 90s released original EPs, just to get some of their own stuff in their lineup and help their mix."

DaftPunk,3bw1o8,kpop_closet,8,Fri Jul 3 15:02:15 2015 UTC,There is no official 'pure mix' without the crowd noise. There are however a lot of fan remakes on Soundcloud.
DaftPunk,3bw1o8,darkeststar,2,Thu Jul 2 17:02:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know about this. I mean for the full album sure. But I've come across many a remix compilation that has what's called something like ""Harder, Better, Faster Stronger, (2008 Club Mix)"" and it's the mix of the song used in Alive '07 without crowd noise. I'm pretty sure however, that it's just a version that isolates out the crowd noise and silences it, I'm not super sure. I did find another in my collection that's called Touch It/Technologic (Alive Club Mix) and it is the same way. Alive '07 version without crowd sounds."
DaftPunk,3bw1o8,MrChestnut,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"Nope, they're all fan recreations! At least from what I recall people have tried to isolate the crowd, but it's mixed in with the music instead of around it, making it difficult to remove the crowd without removing the music as well."
DaftPunk,3bw1o8,darkeststar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:21:35 2015 UTC,"If that's true, it's fucking remarkable how great it sounds. Alongside these remixes there were the seemingly exact replicas of the a capella files for each remix, and it's absolutely spot on."

Can anyone confirm?"

I used sample techniques and the actual model of synthesizer they used (on stage) for these. https://soundcloud.com/burnerman54/sets/daft-punk-alive-2007-remakes  Some remakes i made are missing due to content claims."

DaftPunk,3bucpt,CyaSteve,3,Thu Jul 2 05:42:54 2015 UTC,Sounds like a synthed up version of Instant Crush

DaftPunk,3bucpt,TheChosenJuan99,2,Thu Jul 2 06:06:58 2015 UTC,Yup that one was easy and I tried going from there as well.  I'm not sold on the ~1:00 sample being from Daft Punk it just kind of resonates with me that it is.
DaftPunk,3bucpt,steel13,2,Thu Jul 2 06:11:26 2015 UTC,Sounds like a remixed Robot Rock for the main riff at 1:00

DaftPunk,3bozgi,Nikolaki8,11,Wed Jul 1 00:40:01 2015 UTC,"I would bet new album, Homework-style, before any tour.  I don't think they wouldn't do a Alive + RAM show.  it wouldn't fit perfectly."
DaftPunk,3bozgi,rafael000,8,Thu Jul 2 03:26:24 2015 UTC,You may've forgotten they've released the TRON Soundtrack and worked on multiple other side projects since the last tour such as tracks on 'Yeezus' and 'Nightcall'. Not to mention all the tracks they didn't use on the last tour from their previous albums.
DaftPunk,3bozgi,Nikolaki8,4,Thu Jul 2 03:39:23 2015 UTC,I can't even imagine a TRON/RAM remix. What would it sound like? I bet it would be awesome. They could pull some crazy shit
DaftPunk,3bozgi,PerogiXW,2,Thu Jul 2 04:46:45 2015 UTC,"yeah, but I think those tracks/projects don't represent their essence in a deep way.  not enough to make an epic show like Alive.  also, RAM was about music played by people. It would be contradictory to make a show with sample music and not live music for RAM."
DaftPunk,3bozgi,rafael000,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:21:57 2015 UTC,"Discovery, HAA and RAM all featured elements of live instrumentation so I don't really see what the issue would be. I really doubt they're going to go on tour with everyone featuring from the album, however if they did I would lose my fucking mind."
DaftPunk,3bozgi,Nikolaki8,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:28:13 2015 UTC,"yeah, but RAM was build around the concept of live instrumentation. on RAM it's not just elements. it's the full album.  I'd lose my mind if they did a RAM only show, from beginning to end, with all the guys from the album. Like once I saw Roger Waters performing the whole Dark Side Of The Moon."
DaftPunk,3bozgi,rafael000,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:49:16 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they said they wouldn't do live music, and anyway, RAM was produced the same way as any of there albums, just with artists making the samples."

Since Alive 2007 was a fusion of HAA, Discovery, and Homework, hopefully their next show will be a fusion of Discovery, RAM, and (insert new album).   Honestly it depends on what kind of show they're going for. I think Discovery lent itself to a banging show like 2007, and I don't think RAM necessarily does. I can't see them mashing up the lyrics from Fragments of Time or Instant Crush with huge thumping kicks. Perhaps they'll go for a more relaxed approach but I don't think that's the Daft Punk way."

DaftPunk,3bnu71,IAmArique,2,Tue Jun 30 20:05:03 2015 UTC,Yeah and global gathering but the doesn't mean it will happen again.
DaftPunk,3bnu71,DexterFoley,2,Tue Jun 30 20:41:38 2015 UTC,Coachella was part of their tour. They did many shows in 2006 before 2007.
DaftPunk,3bnu71,VonDozier,6,Wed Jul 1 02:04:29 2015 UTC,They probably just sent an invitation like Coachella used to do every single year.
DaftPunk,3bnu71,SadGalaxy,4,Tue Jun 30 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"They've been on Glastonbury and Coachella call lists even before Alive 2006/2007, and they won't be off that list until they disband. Shows you just how great their strategy works.  I wouldn't be surprised if they said yes for next year. At this point it's not a matter of when they do a tour, but what they're going to do in the tour (music, lights, collaborators, etc.)."
DaftPunk,3bnu71,thefourofusaredying,3,Tue Jun 30 19:26:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I screwed up the title – it is 16/1 not 1/16 chance. Carry on."
DaftPunk,3bnu71,Auntfanny,4,Tue Jun 30 22:07:54 2015 UTC,It's 16/1 not 1/16.  The difference is that the betting odds are that every £1 you bet get £17 pounds back if confirmed.  The way you wrote it is shorter odds which is for every £1 you bet you get £1.06 back.  The shorter the odds the more likely it is to happen.  16/1 is considered an outside bet.  The only thing I would say is that when they did the Alive 2007 festival they played the Itunes Download festival as part of that tour.  However I don't think they will tour RAM.  There are too many collaborators on their most recent albums.

DaftPunk,3bhpqr,MadCoke,23,Mon Jun 29 08:58:22 2015 UTC,"It's not that they're any more ""mainstream"", they already are ""mainstream"" because they've topped charts numerous times in the past with songs like One More Time and HBFS. Their work is popular again because RAM is a more recent album - it's more current. IMO, Daft Punk made a lot of artists they collaborated with popular again. Notably Nile Rodgers, who has collaborated with many artists (such as Mystery Skulls), who's style has inspired a lot artists (Knife Party's ""Superstar"" and Maroon 5's ""Sugar"") and brought back Chic. Giorgio has also been much more active now."
DaftPunk,3bhpqr,iiRockpuppy,28,Mon Jun 29 15:18:50 2015 UTC,"I read an interview some time ago where DP stated that they think EDM is lacking innovation and the ""magic"" DP connects with producing music. They were kind of critical about producing music only with the PC and said that you miss out on the feeling of beeing in a studio etc.    So DP trys to make something different and new and the outcome is something way easier to listen to by a wider audience than for example homework. Like my mum likes ""Get Lucky"" but not ""Rollin' n Scratchin'""    I don't think it's wrong to say they are more mainstream now, but I seriously doubt they did it for larger succes/more money."
DaftPunk,3bhpqr,RolleRolleRolle,27,Mon Jun 29 10:31:16 2015 UTC,"anytime someone tells you DP is getting mainstream, remind them that One More Time is the most pop/mainstream song they ever made...."

DaftPunk,3bhpqr,theReluctantHipster,8,Tue Jun 30 01:45:41 2015 UTC,"Daft Punk have always walked a fine line between pop and electronic music/whatever you wish to call their music. Pop/mainstream is a bad word to some people, in my case it's not, as I love a lot of pop music and pop sensibilities. They did reach a larger audience with RAM, but just like with everyone else they have done that has reached a larger audience, they did so on their terms. It's funny to listen to Daft Punks biggest singles, because you can hear them the way a casual listener may hear them, as a candy coated pop single. But simultaneously their hits are amazing artistic accomplishments as well. One More Time is a great economic pop song, HBFS has such an unorthodox quality to it, and the vocal work on that song is a testament to their technical proficiency.  Get Lucky as well, a lot of my friends wrote it off right away as some mainstream, cheap hit single. Well, thats not the case. In reality, Get Lucky is a harmonically sophisticated disco song, with an infectious groove, an incredible r&b vocal performance courtesy of Pharrell (Guy-Man likened his performance to a lot of singers from the 70s) and overall the song just feels so much more ALIVE compared to pretty much everything else on the radio."
DaftPunk,3bhpqr,SAKEHUNTER1991,9,Mon Jun 29 19:38:18 2015 UTC,"I guess the big question is not: ""is DP getting more mainstream"" but: ""Is it wrong to be popular?"". I don't think it's wrong. It's not like the Robots made an album that was guaranteed to be a big hit / David Guetta style. And even if they did something to please their audience, it's still the artists' choice..."
DaftPunk,3bhpqr,ChiIIout,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:49:40 2015 UTC,"What's really remarkable about DP, IMO, is that yes, they are mainstream, but they've always made a very pointed effort to insulate themselves from the frenzy of the Hollywood/celebrity culture (in more ways than just wearing helmets)--which enables them to maintain their artistic integrity. This was one of the main themes in Daft Punk Unchained. They are extremely methodical in business decisions, be it with record labels or collaborations, and they reinvest their money into their art. To have the clear sense of vision they've had for 20+ years, and to not pander to the desires of anyone but their own, is what make them such incredible artists to me. And of course, the MUSIC!"
DaftPunk,3bhpqr,kaitykk,3,Mon Jun 29 21:26:26 2015 UTC,"""They're getting mainstream"" is another way of saying ""apparently other people listen to this group I'm into now"". They've always been releasing quality mainstream dance music, though many of their tracks wouldn't qualify as mainstream or danceable. Each albums had a radio friendly chart topper. RAM is probably one of the most experimental albums of theirs (Giorgio by Moroder, within, beyond, motherboard, doin it right) where they take what everyone is doing at the time (EDM) and do the opposite."
DaftPunk,3bhpqr,ben1am,5,Mon Jun 29 21:50:42 2015 UTC,They won AOTY. They're mainstream.  But why would that bother you?

DaftPunk,3bhpqr,JoeyBACON,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:07:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, regardless of financial success, recent or further in the past, I think that it seems to me that almost no matter what DP does, it comes from a place that I an enjoy and identify with. Take Elektroma, for instance. It isn't just clean, well made, and freaky. It has a message that anyone can relate to about trying to be something that you are or aren't, and the ways some of us cope with that process. It is sad and soul searching (in my opinion). What I am saying is that it was ""real"" in that they communicated with their audience the way they ""always do"" and that connection is palpable. They could produce a country and western album, and while that genre of music couldn't appeal to me less, I am willing to bet they could make something real and easy to relate to out of it."
DaftPunk,3bhpqr,Nintendroid,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:07:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think they ever make music with the main goal to be inventive or innovative.

DaftPunk,3bhpqr,N13P4N,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:38:10 2015 UTC,How can Daft Punk be mainstream if they only make a new album every seven years?
DaftPunk,3bhpqr,Sleek_Bones,0,Wed Jul 8 22:48:18 2015 UTC,"With each new album they become more of a household name, but they seem to occupy a space that not too many bands get to: Anything they put out will sell like crazy, and they insist on maintaining creative control of their music, so any label that would try to tell Thomas and Guyman what to do would essentially be burning a bridge and losing money.  Seriously, how many artists would have the balls to put out Human After All, knowing it's the exact opposite of their megasuccess, Discovery? And how many artists would wait four years to do it? Most people would just make Discovery 2 within one or two years.  As for RAM's commercial appeal, the only songs that have single quality are Instant Crush, Lose Yourself To Dance, Get Lucky, and MAAYYYBBEE one or 2 more. The rest of the songs are pretty odd.   DP have achieved their status by doing what want creatively (and those robot suits don't hurt).  I guess what I'm trying to say is I have 100% faith in their creative process no matter the level of fame they achieve. I can't say that about too many other bands."

It sounds distinctly like Nickelback, and the disco/funk elements that they have incorporated do not sound like any Daft Punk song I know.  A general trend in pop music has been to incorporate disco/funk elements and instruments into other genres of music. Though Daft Punk did this recently, they are far from the first musicians to incorporate Disco/Funk into their own genre of music (but they have been some of the most successful both in their execution and reception).  If anything, Nickelback is on the late end of a funk revival, doing what they do best: sucking."
DaftPunk,3bki5v,n1nj4_v5_p1r4t3,-1,Fri Jul 3 14:44:03 2015 UTC,"My sentiments exactly. The closest thing in this video that maybe been inspired by the duo are the sequined guitars and even that is a bit of a stretch.   Nickelback don't seem to understand that funk and disco are all about the groove. Anyone can strum a guitar like a Nile Rodgers wannabe and make an eight bar bass line that resembles a funk tune, but once you start plastering the song with random shit like completely blatant product placement and a phaser-filtered rock guitar, you lose all sense of immersion that you once had.   No one can dance to this song and no one can rock to this song. They've created this weird fusion that really appeals to nobody. It's a completely shameless cash grab."

They didn't change the sound afterward (appart mastering), you can here the little mistake they made on steam machine before around the world.  The songs were prepared before (because they had to keep in sync with the video using SMPTE code), but they were playing the effects and synths parameters live.   However the music use a lot of audio loops, from the simple fact that Daft Punk used a lot of samples. For exemple they don't have access to the original guitars of Robot Rock, because they didn't create the original sound themselves. They did circumvent that limitation by using creative effects and adding 4 Moog to their setup.   EDIT: spelling"

It might sound like nothing, but in Bercy you could really feel something was off. Because with the volume power in Bercy you hear a lot more the difference with basses. So if the Daft Punk tell you the beat is (0 = no bass, 1= bass, space between number is the timing, bold is the beat weird, and the italics following are half the bass):   0 1 0 1 11111111 1 0 1 0 10000001 1 1 1 1  then around the world starts.

DaftPunk,3bbr1e,kirby824,2,Sat Jun 27 23:04:08 2015 UTC,"All this time I thought my version of that album had that mistake, with every other torrent of it having he same mistake. Looking up the whole live album on YouTube the mistake is there, did someone on YouTube clean it up?"

DaftPunk,3bbr1e,DELB_,3,Sun Jun 28 09:01:12 2015 UTC,"Daft Punk was working with XL VIDEOS at that time: http://www.apple.com/pro/profiles/xl_video/ (it's offline but you can use the webarchive to find it back.  ""Daft Punk wanted the most dazzling visuals they could get for their latest tour. XL Video provided a few eight-core Mac Pros running Catalyst v4 and Final Cut Pro. “They came to us with a pretty fixed idea of what they wanted,” says Burford. “They wanted to mix live video with effects. Using the eight-core Mac Pros, we were able to take in eight digital sources and treat them as video streams. Then they could use Catalyst to coordinate the video with lighting effects and add their own effects in on the fly. The final digital video streams ran to LED screens.”  And here: http://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/2006/08/leds-create-pyramid-showcase-for-daft-punk.html  The video content – which runs for 95 per cent of the Daft Punk show - – is stored on and played back via two dual output V4 Catalyst digital media servers, with two running as ‘hot’ backup. These are triggered by Phillips’ Hog iPC lighting console, in turn receiving SMPTE from the band.  Since XL VIDEOS went to Deadmau5 after Daft Punk stopped touring, and recently he was bitching about being locked up by that: http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deadmau5-clarifies-press-play-comments-about-fellow-djs-20120625 and here: http://deadmau5.tumblr.com/post/25690507284/we-all-hit-play  . . but doesnt give me a lot of 'lookit me im Jimi Hendrix check out this solo' stuff, because I'm constrained to work on a set timeline because of the SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers timestamp).""  I'm assuming without too much risks that the Daft Punk were ""limited"" in the same way, that they had to play the live in one order, because technically they could not do differently.  Which is not much a big deal for them because their liveshow was supposed to look more like a movie than a concert of Hendrix. BUt if you don't want to play the same tracklist over and over, SMPTE isn't the way to go.  Feed Me for exemple use another solution to drive his visuals while keeping the freedom to choose how to play his liveset.  TLDR: SMPTE forced them to have a fixed timeline."
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,steo0315,16,Sun Jun 28 09:28:24 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for more live concert with similar creativity, I'd suggest the Justice live albums."
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,pattybak3s,8,Sat Jun 27 18:54:24 2015 UTC,AAA?
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,pattybak3s,10,Sat Jun 27 18:58:22 2015 UTC,A cross the universe is also very solid.
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,Sutfin,4,Sat Jun 27 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"Much more solid. Rabid Justice fan here, and AAA sounds hollow compared to ACTU. It's just the sound, it doesn't feel as personal as the first live album, which is a treasure beyond belief. I can't believe Cross is almost ten years old."
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,Kiowa707,3,Sun Jun 28 02:30:52 2015 UTC,"Hard hitting as well. My favorite part ACTU is the second half of ""NY Excuses"" where it just punches you in the chest so hard."
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,RolleRolleRolle,2,Sun Jun 28 03:07:51 2015 UTC,"Also, that Live DVD."
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,jhsounds,8,Sun Jun 28 08:26:55 2015 UTC,"Quick answers off the top of my head:  The album Alive 2007 was from a single show recorded during their gig at the Bercy Arena in France. The performance was a mixture of pre-recorded elements (acapellas, instrumentals, album tracks, etc), stage-generated synths, and live effects. Daft Punk controlled all the stuff with various hardware and software (including Ableton Live and MIDI controllers iirc). As far as I can tell, the only post-production touchup for the album was the removal of the Close Encounters of the Third Kind jingle. It was used in the live show to signal Daft Punk entering the stage at the start. Breaks of silence may have been shortened too, I'm not sure."
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,steo0315,4,Sat Jun 27 18:45:56 2015 UTC,Yep! Ableton Live 6 at the time + BCR 2000 + Lemurs + MOOG Voyager
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,DrQuarters,4,Sat Jun 27 19:00:36 2015 UTC,They added Burnin' into the Alive 2007 tour and Stardust at the end for the encore. They just kept the Around The World parts going for a little longer in between the two.
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,steo0315,3,Sun Jun 28 01:12:30 2015 UTC,"They also created a better version of Too Long / Steam machine with an awesome chord progression, also more beats of Phoenix near Forget About The World."
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,mguzman011,7,Sun Jun 28 02:32:46 2015 UTC,"It's from the Bercy, Paris performance.   Sound should be mostly from the actual performance I'd imagine.   It's hard to say how much stuff was done live or was prepared before. I would imagine that the whole sequence of tracks was definitely planned out, but was then performed live. Most of the performances in the Alive tour had a mostly similar layout.  I believe in one of their performances, there's a part where one of the synths during Short Circuit (IIRC) dies out and they have to restart it. So it was definitely done live."
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,staticvariables,3,Sat Jun 27 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure that all loops and sounds were constructed and triggered live and that there was no point A to B or pre-recording. When listening to the different shows, you could hear major differences in terms of effects but only minor changes in samples and loops. Because of the lightshow there had to be an excessive amount of precision and synchronization and I'm guessing the rig spent many days at rehearsal as the crew tried to tune the show into perfection for the first performance. Between the '06 and '07 shows many improvements was added, both visual and audible."
DaftPunk,3bbr1e,kpop_closet,4,Sun Jun 28 05:51:04 2015 UTC,"The whole album was recorded at one show. The sound you hear is live, they added in the crowd noises by placing microphones at different places in the crowd. They wanted the album to feel alive, hence the name (source: an interview).  It is said that the whole show was prepared before hand in a program like Ableton and they just had to que the songs.   So all the shows they did are almost the same, however in some shows some small parts differ (added in acapellas of one song if I remember correctly?).  Still an amazing show and arguably their best work. And welcome to the club, I hope their music will help you in your life just like it has for us."
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,steo0315,7,Sat Jun 27 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"It was good. Not amazing, not terrible, but good.   The main issue I had with the film was that it didn't explore the construction and production of their albums nearly enough, it focussed more about the legacy and reception of them. I really enjoyed Nile Rodgers' and Peter Franco's segments because they actually explained what went into the creation and development of RAM, however even those parts weren't that in depth.   The other issue I had with the film were the useless candidates for the interviews. Don't even get me started on why they even bothered to get Kanye for the movie if they aren't even going to ask him questions about the duo. The most relevant thing he said the entire time was something along the lines of 'Daft Punk is a cool name'. Talk about your collaboration with them for God sake's. I read an interview with A-Track that wasn't even about Daft Punk and he provided a tonne of insight about the production of 'Stronger'. He probably would've actually been interested in commenting about their music unlike Kanye was in this film.   In Kanye's defence I feel like the interviewers weren't very good in what questions they were asking the interviewees. I have little to not recollection on what Paul Williams had to say and Skrillex provided information that is already readable on his Wikipedia article. Similarly, I agree that Eric Chédeville and Pete Tong were excellent in the film, providing a good balance between the anonymity, shyness, and humanity that the duo embody.  All in all, the film was well constructed in it's pacing and editing, as a BBC documentary usually is. It was interesting to watch, engaged me for most of the viewing time and did provide some new information that I personally didn't know about the duo before.   7/10"
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,Nikolaki8,3,Sun Jun 28 04:33:45 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't give their production secrets away so easily.  Though if you look hard enough I'm sure you will find how they produce their tracks.  You know where that A-Track interview is at?  I'd like to give that a read.  Also yeah, Todd Edwards did some good stuff in it and I liked the old footage that hasn't been seen before of DP.  Especially Guy-Man and Thomas in Darlin' (as well as Laurent Brancowitz).  To be fair though, I mean, we're like pretty die-hard DP fans so we'd know about this stuff already, people who like Daft Punk's music, but who aren't hardcore DP fans, wouldn't really know a lot of this stuff -- which I think we take for granted because we already know.  Think the ""Get Lucky"" generation of DP fans, most probably aren't even aware that DP used to make rave music which subsequently makes me feel sort of old."
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,DELB_,2,Sun Jun 28 07:32:25 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't give their production secrets away so easily.   I understand that, but I meant more of the writing process and process of discarding of tracks that didn't meet the final cut, examples more along those lines. Even if they did show off some of the secrets of RAM's creation, such as showcasing the monster synth they used, it wouldn't matter as it was custom built for them and the information wouldn't really be of use to anyone.   Though if you look hard enough I'm sure you will find how they produce their tracks.   That's kind of my point, there is hardly any information on this, however if you know of something don't hesitate to inform me.   You know where that A-Track interview is at? I'd like to give that a read.   A-Track interview is found here, scroll down a little until you get to the 'Stronger' section: http://genius.com/A-Trak   To be fair though, I mean, we're like pretty die-hard DP fans so we'd know about this stuff already   This is fair, although I can't help feel disappointed that a lot of the information presented in this film is easily accessible through a couple of Google searches.   Just to be clear, I didn't dislike the film, I actually enjoyed it a fair bit, but I couldn't help but feel that it fell sort in its interviewing and content. This partially comes down to no fault of the BBC's own, the duo are notorious for their secrecy. However you run the risk of these shortcomings when you produce a biography, a recount of someone's career, about a subject that is practically anonymous."
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,Nikolaki8,5,Sun Jun 28 07:59:56 2015 UTC,"Well, what do you want to know about their production?  I know some stuff.  I'll summarise it for you quick, they make their music on TR-808s, TR-909s, TB-303, Linndrum, Juno 106, Minimoog, lots of vintage synths and they are gearheads (meaning they don't make stuff on the computer, they only use hardware meaning real instruments).  Also, they sample using an SP-1200 drum machine, it is known for it's crunched-up samples due to it being 12-bit meaning lack of fidelity, meaning that sampler had low memory because it's old, and so in-order for the sample to get stored in there, you had to pitch up the record on a turntable and import it into the sampler, and pitch it down in the sampler.  Kanye also uses an SP-1200.  Daft Punk never really used Akai samplers apart from the Akai S01 during Homework which they used on Homework and in some of their live shows, in the documentary you'll see them use it when the Daftendirekt song is playing in the first half our of the doc.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_GsiAf2qj8  Watch this, you will undoubtedly hear what I'm talking about when he shifts down the pitch of the sample -- I seriously think DP used this on One More Time.  The pumping kick sound comes from an Alesis 3630 with sidechain, it's a cheap compressor that Daft Punk used on Discovery and even Alan Braxe uses one if you look on his rack shelf.  The information is out there but you'll have to find a lot of it yourself by Google Searching -- there's way too much stuff that goes into their albums.  Go on Gearslutz and you'll find a lot of information.  Both members of Daft Punk are so, so good at using gear in different ways.  Read this interview Guy-Man did with Mixmag:  http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/daft-punk/372628  Quote from Guy-Man: ""We use the big ones that were used in the '70s, like the Juno. It depends on how you use it — if you put a distortion effect on a Juno, you can't tell it's a Juno,"" yeah, that's Rollin' & Scratchin':  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJyMBfQz4_8  The information is out there.  Search harder.  Thank you for the A-Track interview."
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,DELB_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:03:47 2015 UTC,"Creativity.  That is the whole point of Daft Punk and how they produce their tracks.  Taste, experimentation, putting things together that haven't been put together before.    Forget about kit lists, you are only chasing your own tail.  Make a big-band house stomper with a Linn drum.  Or look at the track Alive - recorded on just a shitty Alesis microverb and a budget Roland sound module.  It's not about kit, it's their talent and priciples that elevate them.  Bangalter could destroy in Fruity Loops"

DaftPunk,3bbuhd,Nikolaki8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:28:51 2015 UTC,I think it touched on it at times.  But overall their 'creative process' is so broad and informed by many different aesthetics and approaches to fit in the documentary.    I do agree the doc was too populist and repeated a lot of known stuff - maybe it was aimed at more the entry-level fan ...

DaftPunk,3bbuhd,aarol01,2,Sun Jun 28 22:34:33 2015 UTC,Kraftwerk are about as German as they come. I haven't seen the documentary but did it make out Kraftwerk to be American or something? :P
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,spanieldaniel,2,Mon Jun 29 15:56:26 2015 UTC,They also had a contest where you could program your robot dog to do a dance to Technologic. There were three winners. Only one dance was really good in my opinion.
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,DrQuarters,2,Sun Jun 28 01:22:58 2015 UTC,"i laughed when they used HBFS as the example of what sampling is. the guy goes on about how it should take a snippit of music and loop it, and in turn it becomes it's own thing/unrecognizable. while i don't mean to knock HBFS, of all their sampled works they picked that one, instead of face to face or digital love which actually do a lot more with the samples they used.   not a big deal, i guess, just a poor choice IMO. it's a good doc, and we got darlin' footage that i never thought would actually see the light of day.  Edit: forgot an L"
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,jessaa,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:02:48 2015 UTC,I disagree. The intro and breakdown of HBFS make the original track unrecognisable while also incorporating the looping mechanic in the bulk of the song. Not to mention the vocals which very well may be one of the most complex melodic endeavours the duo have created.   EDIT: autocorrect
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,Nikolaki8,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:12:12 2015 UTC,"While the vocals were no doubt genius you can't honestly say that the intro is unrecognizable, it's almost literally the same thing."
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,The-Disco-Phoenix,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:09:09 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ, the intro consists of four different micro samples in itself."
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,Nikolaki8,0,Thu Jul 2 01:03:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, HBFS and Robot Rock are basically rip-offs of the original song.  They just sampled a 5 second snippet and looped it and cut it up and with Robot Rock they just literally ripped from it...  lazy and shoddy work by Daft Punk I've got to admit.  One More Time...  now that is genius sampling and even when you listen to the original song (Eddie Johns - More Spell On You) it is very hard to spot the sample."
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,DELB_,2,Sun Jun 28 07:36:16 2015 UTC,"Robot Rock maybe, not HBFS, the second part of the track is still based on the sample and is incredible"
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,DELB_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:54:53 2015 UTC,"The song's good yeah, but it's still a 5 second snippet in some parts of the song.  It is catchy though and it was the song that hooked me to Daft Punk and it is absolutely an incredible song."
DaftPunk,3bbuhd,spiritualsummer,2,Sun Jun 28 10:07:29 2015 UTC,"I liked it! I love their stuff because Alive was the soundtrack between when I was like 18-20years old. When I went out with friends at night that CD would always be playing.  RAM made me like the duo even more, and this doc. made me seem them in an even more interesting light. Especially the bit about the 2006 Coachella performance, because I had no idea how revolutionary the setup was, as I only found out about it much later. I do agree that it fell a bit short in the sense that you don't really learn much about the creative process, but to be fair that wouldn't necessarily be very easy to demonstrate without the band's input. All in all, a very good watch for a dude that didn't know that much about their journey."

I've tried it myself and if my shitty mixing skills can make it sound good then I have no idea how well the robots could do it.   Also I don't see why tracks like 'Nightcall' shouldn't be allowed. Seeing them mix that would be amazing!
DaftPunk,3b1etn,Nikolaki8,3,Thu Jun 25 06:11:02 2015 UTC,Nightcity (Nightcall vs Rack City) is a really good remix for exemple. Or Midnight Life (Midnight City vs Good Life). Musics which come from different worlds can lead to an epic remix !

It starts in the early 90s and follow their history, step by step. There are a lot of interviews, most of them with the ones who contributed to RAM. No interview from the Daft Punk, but it was said in a newspaper that they didn't prevent the autor of the documentary anything. He was totally free to do whatever he wanted. I learned a lot about the group. How the clip of Harder, Better .. contributed to their celebrity for exemple. I noticed it talks two times about Coachella, in 2006 and 2013. Pharrel says ""We were in the crowd and nobody knew it, when they released the 30 seconds of Get Lucky, and it felt incredible""  A really good documentary :)"

DaftPunk,3aua1j,spanieldaniel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:29:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Daft Punk's remixes that are called remixes but generally barely sound like the original song at all only sampling a small snippet of it, are called such as they were featured on the single vinyls of the original songs; thus, you'd have to get the single vinyl (or a variant repress) to get the Daft Punk mix on wax. (Back in the day especially it was commonplace for electronic artists to do this, and even to this day with CD singles it's a thing.) Allowed Daft Punk to produce a wicked stand-alone mix, helped to promote the single, helped to promote Daft Punk (also giving them more material for later compilations/live sets), win-win situation!"

DaftPunk,3aua1j,OutsideOwl,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"I don't remember the exact details so you'll have to look it up yourself because I'm lazy right now but as far as I remember a particular press of Homework vinyls skipped on Da Funk (and I think possibly in another track also, bad pressing), whereas other presses didn't so obviously they're more valuable and desirable. Hence it's not /u/OzTane's turntable that's problematic in this case, rather the record itself. Don't know about Alive 1997, could be the record but try /u/BongSmoker1's and other tricks, and your new turntable when you get it if that doesn't work, to see if it's your setup (could be a bad press also, anyone else with the record can confirm?)."

DaftPunk,3ahmqg,Throwthis322,8,Sat Jun 20 06:55:11 2015 UTC,Since the vocoder vocals in LYTD are panned you probably could find a half-decent a cappella from a stereo-cancelled version of RAM somewhere and add them over the instrumental section of LYTD. It'd sound pretty average but that's probably as close as you'll get. I wish the duo released a stem package for RAM.
DaftPunk,3ahmqg,Nikolaki8,3,Sat Jun 20 14:09:53 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I don't believe there is. If you did find one, it wouldn't sound very good and there'd still be artifacts of his voice."

But I want to ask you a question, what is the pad you used in the beginning and at some parts of the song, I have always wanted to recreate that kind of a sound, it's amazing!"

Yeah I know I wasn't sure how to do the vocals, I tried vocoding them all but it sounded pretty terrible haha yes I got the pad sounds from making a patch in Arturia's version of the CS80, the trick is to play around with the filters. Daft Punk are complete wizards for creating space and movement with filters."

Yeah I think the live version is most messed up by Mr Wonder accidentally singing the chorus wrong and then towards the end with the La-La-La part they say ""up all night to get lucky"" sort of out of breath and not into the mic. So yeah this one was really good. Loving it."

DaftPunk,39qeao,acardenas913,3,Sun Jun 14 15:14:31 2015 UTC,"Harpejji:       The harpejji is an electric stringed musical instrument developed in 2007 by Tim Meeks, founder of Marcodi Musical Products, and is a descendant of the StarrBoard.   The instrument aims to bridge the gap in sound and technique between the guitar and the piano. The playing surface has an isomorphic keyboard layout arranged in ascending whole tones across strings, and ascending semi-tones as the strings travel away from the player with a five octave range from A0 to A5. The first harpejji model, the 24 string d1, was produced from January 2008  through May 2010. It was subsequently replaced by the k24 which also has 24 strings. The latter model includes updates to the internal electronics, a simplification of the fretboard marker system, and a change from maple to bamboo as the primary wood for the instrument. In January 2011, the g16, a smaller 16 string model with a four octave range (from C2 to C6) and mono output, was introduced. All harpejjis use an electronic muting system to dampen unfretted strings and minimize the impact of sympathetic vibrations.

As for sounding like Daft Punk though, has more of a Giorgio (particularly the lead synths) and Justice (particularly the bassline) vibe to me personally. Not really relevant to this sub but I think any electronic music appreciator should at least like this haha. It has a bit of dreamy, sci-fi video game feel to it that could work well in something like a Sonic game, love the atmosphere."

DaftPunk,39ony8,ironicredditusername,2,Sun Jun 14 00:43:44 2015 UTC,The subreddit is fairly inactive and we honestly don't need a post asking us if the water sounds like fluidly shit.
DaftPunk,39ony8,daftdawg28,2,Sun Jun 14 00:44:50 2015 UTC,"But I mean, it's still a question about a Daft Punk track.   Does everyone really take this that seriously?

DaftPunk,39h8vh,pst0102,16,Thu Jun 11 18:24:42 2015 UTC,I wonder what they're doing.
DaftPunk,39h8vh,stnmtn,-8,Thu Jun 11 19:00:13 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't really like the direction they are going. I like the glory days with Alive, Homework, Discovery, and so on."
DaftPunk,39h8vh,Mr_Bagels,-4,Thu Jun 11 20:11:16 2015 UTC,I agree. They're going in this weird jazz indie direction and it just doesn't suit them. I would prefer they go back to their house roots.
DaftPunk,39h8vh,IrrelevantLeprechaun,14,Thu Jun 11 21:28:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as long as they produce good music, I wouldn't care what the genre is. I think they took a chance and it turned out to be great with R.A.M"
DaftPunk,39h8vh,Connor_Cleve,6,Thu Jun 11 21:49:57 2015 UTC,Jazz and indie are some of the worst words to describe RAM.
DaftPunk,39h8vh,Nikolaki8,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:09:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. Jazz maybe, but if you were to put it into a genre it would be disco and definitely electronic."
DaftPunk,39h8vh,Connor_Cleve,8,Sat Jun 13 18:59:44 2015 UTC,Why isn't R.A.M on there?  EDIT: I know you can find it on their VEVO but it seems odd that it wouldn't be on there with the rest of their albums.
DaftPunk,39h8vh,Connor_Cleve,9,Thu Jun 11 21:27:27 2015 UTC,Probably has to do with the fact they changed producers/record labels.
DaftPunk,39h8vh,Lark_vi_Britannia,5,Thu Jun 11 23:34:34 2015 UTC,"Huh, The Strokes's channel did the same thing. They uploaded all the stuff,deleted it and re uploaded again."

I think what they did was add a bunch of versions of albums from different countries (or a computer did), and then someone realized they were just duplicates of the same album, so they were deleted"
DaftPunk,39h8vh,Ammarzk,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:55:50 2015 UTC,Do they have separate accounts for other languages or are they sticking to English?

DaftPunk,39cznq,pattybak3s,6,Thu Jun 11 06:01:28 2015 UTC,It's expensive but you want most of their discography in Hi-fi. If you are not looking for full HD sound quality you can go with Spotify.
DaftPunk,39cznq,djberto,2,Wed Jun 10 23:05:24 2015 UTC,"I'm already using Deezer premium, and I think it's about the same price as Tidal"
DaftPunk,39cznq,OutsideOwl,4,Wed Jun 10 23:09:57 2015 UTC,Just use Google Play Music.
DaftPunk,39cznq,emgirgis95,2,Thu Jun 11 00:17:36 2015 UTC,"As others say spotify and googlemusic are probably the best. both in UI and amount of artists they offer. Tidal has limited libraries of most artists other streaming platforms have entire discographies. Tidal's UI is very slow if you are using it on any device older than 2 years, and payment is a bit confusing but their hifi streaming is barely noticeably better  warning: if you plan on canceling your Tidal subscription good luck. I couldn't figure it out and they dont have ANY support lines or emails. Had to cancel it twice through iTunes and it still charged me after canceling.  edit: to cancel you have to go to subscription under your account, if you got it through itunes you have to cancel through itunes reoccurring payments"

I'd tell you if the HIFI quality was good or not, but my 60mbps internet couldn't even load it without having to buffer every few seconds. Spotify has the same music and it actually loads so I'm sticking with it. It's also a good bit cheaper."

If you want more than just the song get tidal."

DaftPunk,39761e,Nikolaki8,5,Tue Jun 9 19:53:30 2015 UTC,I'm not a legal professional or anything but would they not need to acquire the rights to put all the content into one box set? Even if they could it'd be way too overpriced. Not a practical idea.
DaftPunk,39761e,dilettanteTunesmith,3,Wed Jun 10 03:47:01 2015 UTC,"It's a fun idea, in theory, but in real life, it'd be a $1000+ idea. Alive 1997/2007 on vinyl were over $100, add together the other albums, plus a record player, and other things, that'd be one heck of a price tag. Not to mention that this would, in theory, be their last thing ever; no doubt they'd slap an extra couple hundred dollars on there for ""sentimental value"" or ""limited edition status""."
DaftPunk,39761e,Nikolaki8,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:58:49 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that it doesn't look like they're retiring any time soon. If they did it'd not only be a disappointing loss for the music community, but huge potential financial loss for them too. After RAM, there's no doubt their next album is going to attract hundreds of thousands of buyers."
DaftPunk,39761e,PanRagon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:23:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Daft Punk could afford to quit whenever they want. They should both be in very financially stable positions.
DaftPunk,39761e,Nikolaki8,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:46:01 2015 UTC,"Obviously, but the opportunity to make more money is always a reason for them to continue to work. Who knows, maybe they want to open up a charity, make another feature length film or maybe even develop a clothing line. They could retire now easily but knowing them, they want to continue to expand on their work."
DaftPunk,39761e,PanRagon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:50:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not suggesting they're going to quit yet, they have of course just hit another stride. But saying they won't be able to quit now because of financial reasons isn't really true, they've made enough from RAM alone to support them for the rest of their lives. Still, I wouldn't imagine they're any close to quitting soon, they love what they do and they can milk live performances for a ton.  Still, if they'd want to quit, they could very easily do that now and still continue living the high life."
DaftPunk,39761e,Nikolaki8,2,Wed Jun 10 07:10:31 2015 UTC,"I think you may have misunderstood what I wrote earlier:    ""If they did it'd not only be a disappointing loss for the music community, but a huge potential financial loss for them too.""   What I meant was that the opportunity to make more money would be lost if they retired now, not that they financially need more money to pay bills or mortgage or whatever."
DaftPunk,39761e,PanRagon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:27:36 2015 UTC,"Don't really know why you're being downvoted, but ok. The thing is it wouldn't cost them as much as you seem to think, the value of money declines incrementally, yes they'll probably earn a lot of money if they keep milking their stride, but they're already so well off it doesn't necessarily matter that much."
DaftPunk,39761e,sackman66mode,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:40:32 2015 UTC,"but the opportunity to make more money is always a reason for them to continue to work   Nikolaki8, I always see your posts and I respect your thoughts and opinions, but I disagree with this greatly.  Perhaps money is a motivator for the average artist, but for Daft Punk I don't perceive this as fact.  Maybe I'm too disillusioned with how much of a pedestal I put them on in my mind.  I really believe they don't make their art for the sake of making a buck.  If anything I think they see it as a an added bonus; something that allows them to continue on to their next project.  To say money is the reason just doesn't jive with their entire persona."
DaftPunk,39761e,Nikolaki8,2,Wed Jun 10 15:06:10 2015 UTC,"I honestly think a lot of people here are disillusioned by thinking that money is not a motivator for Daft Punk making music, of course it is. That's why they have managers. I'm not saying that it's the only reason they make music, I understand how they make music from heart more so than most other musicians out there today. But when you make comments like ""they see it as an added bonus"", I honestly think you may be a little out of touch on how they, or another artists for that matter, operate. Like I said before, they may need more money to open up bigger ventures such as a charity."

An official documentary produced by the BBC about the duo is scheduled to be released sometime this month. Guy-Man's band 'Le Knight Club' was resurrected briefly to produce a track for a new movie featuring Mike Tyson.   Daft Punk appear as characters played by actors in the movie EDEN which is set in the Homework era.  Rumours about the duo making a new house-oriented album have been floating around.   Anyone feel free to continue to add to this.   EDIT:   Rumours that the duo were going to score TRON 3 until its unfortunate cancellation. - /u/Rallerboy88"

DaftPunk,38wcw3,Rallerboy888,4,Sun Jun 7 12:59:32 2015 UTC,"Kinda makes sense. Tron Legacy cost a lot of money and didn't go over well with the masses. I heard that Tron 3 would have taken place in the real world more and I can only assume it was because they knew the CGI budget wouldn't be there... But then what is a Tron movie without being inside the computer.  First Tron was at the forefront of CGI. Tron 2 takes it even further using IMAX and 3D. If anything, Disney will shelve Tron 3 for another decade once VR theaters are in fashion so we can all shit our pants simultaneously when we go inside the computer. For now, they've got Lucasfilms and Marvel to cash in on."

In case you guys didn't know US 36 and US 40 stand for the chest measurement in inches. I myself go between a 42 and 44 depending on my weight. You can typically add 6 inches to your waist size to get a chest size unless your are very athletic (ripped) then you want to add 7 and sometime 8 instead. I sold suits for a while.

There's something undeniably 'Homework-y' about it all... from the grainy fidelity of the advertisements (which seems to recall the gatefold of the Homework LP), the use of the original red and black logo and the fact that they're basically producing the timeless toys of a lost generation (skateboards, yoyos, frisbees, etc). Again, all of these items seem to hark back to the gatefold of Homework- the adolescent desk of Thomas or Guy-Man, strewn with all of the accoutrements of a Parisian teenager growing up in the 80s/early 90s. Not sure if I'm reading into all this a bit too much, but are Daft Punk currently in a process of transitioning back to their early aesthetic? It would kind of make sense- after ""Random Access Memories"", an album that consciously tried to recreate the music that inspired them in the first place, it seems logical that they'd want to establish a continuity between the vibes of the 70s and the 90s..."

It's great to listen to each of Daft Punk's songs individually, but after listening to Alive 2007 you realise that each song is just a template, and so much more can be done with them. I absolutely love the last track on the album, when ""Music Sounds Better With You"" by Stardust starts playing its so amazing. I have fingers crossed for 2017, and I can't wait to see what they can do with RAM."

It's an unofficial rip afaik that was taken from the sound board; it's completely different from Alive 1997 and is super good."

DaftPunk,37zc78,KrunchoKing,3,Mon Jun 1 02:12:23 2015 UTC,"What a great story!  I pretty much grew up with DP - they roughly came on the scene around the same year when I was born (me - 1996, homework - 1997), my sister who is 5 years older than me loved them growing up, but I was never really aware of who they were. I loved HBFS and... well, that's pretty much the only song I had of theirs for the longest time. In fact, it was one of the first songs I purchased with my own money on iTunes at a very young age! Kanye West's ""Stronger"" sparked them into existence once again because my sister was crazy for the song, but still no clue how significant DP really was to me growing up.  First time I was really conscious of who they were was when Tron: Legacy. The news of Tron getting a sequel was plastered every where - oddly enough, I only knew of the original Tron thanks to Kingdom Hearts - and one article stated the soundtrack was going to be done by Daft Punk. Hold on, same guys who did HBFS? Woah, blew my little 12 year old mind! I was psyched to go, I really couldn't shut up about it.  I took my first step into listening to their first album just a couple years back with the release of RAM. It occurred to me... wow, these guys are really talented! They really influenced my musical taste and who I am today. Why wasn't I already listening to all of their music? I made the effort to get every one of their albums and start right at the beginning. What I would do to listen to Alive 2007 for the first time...   Now I own three of their vinyls, a few posters hanging up in my room, have dressed up as Guy-Man for halloween, and now putting on a full fledge tribute event at my school for my senior year. Daft Punk has a profound impact on me as a whole and have broadened my taste in music in so many ways. I could never appreciate Chic or Justice now if it weren't for Daft Punk. I'm truly grateful for them"

Daft Punk also kicked off my addiction to physical media and now i dump all my money into cd and vinyl"
DaftPunk,37zc78,macks1138,2,Mon Jun 1 05:21:36 2015 UTC,"For me it was RAM, two years ago from now. My friend (who's a long-time Daft Punk fan) was listening to it when I came over to hang out, and I knew right away that it was something special. Hearing the splendid combination of electronic, funk, rock and R&B on the album was really intriguing. I instantly fell in love with Get Lucky when it was on the radio that summer, and I never got tired of it. I decided to get the album, and I listened to it a lot on summer road trips that I took with good friends. RAM forever has a special place in my heart, because it reminds me of good times and good vibes with loving company, which I think is such a big part of the album's message anyway.  Then when Pentatonix did their Daft Punk medley, I knew I had to explore the rest of their music. The rest is history, and now they're easily in my top favorite musicians."
DaftPunk,37zc78,OtakuMusician,2,Mon Jun 1 16:51:42 2015 UTC,I can't believe RAM was two years ago already.

DaftPunk,37zc78,heydelinquent,2,Mon Jun 1 17:56:45 2015 UTC,"One More Time is what did it for me, but it wasn't until around 2005 that I got REALLY obsessed."

DaftPunk,37zc78,coscorrodrift,2,Mon Jun 1 21:07:08 2015 UTC,Always liked them but fell in love with Random Access Memories.
DaftPunk,37zc78,discoponeh,2,Mon Jun 1 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"I've always been more of a song guy, so I didn't use to check out artists (my brain hadn't made the ""good song must have been made by good artist, therefore look up artist"" connection),  but I had heard or seen the Harder Better Faster Stronger song/ Daft Bodies video, and liked them both quite a lot (still one of my top songs) I started to look for more songs by them (my brain was now able to comprehend the ""artist"" concept,  but albums were new to me) and found out some rad songs (Around The World, Robot Rock, Technologic).  Later on, the Tron movie came out,  and a friend told me the soundtrack was done by Daft Punk, but I still wasn't familiar enough with them to recognize the name in casual conversation. I saw the movie and the soundtrack was freaking amazing,  with Derezzed airing on TV as a single with that amazing music video. This was when the ""Daft Punk"" name stuck in my head.   Some time after that, I read online that Daft Punk was going to make a new album, and I started to get hyped. The Get Lucky teaser was uploaded,  and it was really cool,  with the ""mexican monkey"" robot vocals. Then the full album was released,  and Get Lucky started sounding on the radio fairly often. I tried to listen to it for free, and liked some songs, but when I was given a Note 2, Samsung Music gifted albums, and one of them was RAM, so I downloaded it, and listened to it legitimately.  That was what I consider to be my first album, and one of the few legit ones I had (and still have, now in physical copy, since Samsung closed that service ). I truly love RAM and DP not only because they're freaking fantastic but also because they've introduced me to the album concept. Now I own several albums, and not just singles."
DaftPunk,37zc78,omararod,2,Wed Jun 3 13:41:45 2015 UTC,"My older brother started playing Discovery in his room all the time, and Crescendolls caught my ear every time.  ""What is that song where they yell ""yeah!"" and it sounds really happy?""  He gave me the album and then Digital Love won my heart the rest of the way."
DaftPunk,37zc78,OtakuMusician,2,Wed Jun 3 17:55:05 2015 UTC,"Back when I went on a plane for the first time in awhile. Get Lucky was just getting popular, and if you've ever flown on JetBlue, they always have this one song they play the whole plane ride; thus that song was Get Lucky. best song I've ever heard, when I got home I went on spotify and I discovered more of their stuff because I was using that 'Top Songs' thingy. Then, I ended up here. :)"
DaftPunk,37zc78,foxh8er,2,Thu Jun 4 20:19:06 2015 UTC,"I should clarify before I start that I was also starting to get into Anime around this time as well, but when I was about 13 or 14, my family and I were passing a clothing shop in a mall and One More Time was playing. It sounded familiar, so I think vocally, ""Hey, I know this song!""  My sister informs me that this is Daft Punk, and she insists that I check out the music video because it's ""anime-ish"" (her words). When we got home I looked it up and discovered a whole new interest that would soon become a part of my life for the next eight years."
DaftPunk,37zc78,daft_rat,2,Thu Jun 4 20:39:32 2015 UTC,"This Apple commercial. Then I forgot about it. Then I discovered Stronger in 2009 after watching Akira, then I realized the song it sampled was also fucking amazing. The rest is history."
DaftPunk,37zc78,blacktieaffair,2,Fri Jun 5 01:44:21 2015 UTC,"Saw Technologic iPod commeercial, checked it out, which led me to discovery songs. Then I heard HBFS, and that sealed the deal for me."
DaftPunk,37zc78,Ankaph,2,Fri Jun 5 04:00:59 2015 UTC,"My first song was One More Time too. I want to say I was in the 6th grade. I got up every morning and watched VH1's music video block, and they often played the One More Time cut from IS555 (it had just been released in the last year I believe). I was kind of immediately in love. I went out and bought their CD. I thought I would like it because it had rainbows on it. (12 year old logic: Rainbows are awesome, therefore a band that puts rainbows on their album must be awesome. Conclusion: Daft punk is awesome.)  I listened to the album on repeat at night in bed for days on end. I formed many of my impressions on love, peace, and other deep emotions based on some of the music from Discovery. Something About Us and Nightvision had a profound effect on me. All of the songs did, really. It was the first time I had ever sought out an artist on my own and fell in love with it. It was the first time I had found my music.  I think in 7th grade I sent my morning alarm to be One More Time, so every time I hear it, a little pang of decades-old nostalgia hits me.   I can't remember when I listened to Homework, although I had it probably by the beginning of high school. I didn't listen to Human After All until college! And then, MY FACE WAS ENTIRELY MELTED BY ALIVE 2007 in college as well. I was a fan before, but I became a SUPER fan after listening to that. I realized they weren't just good electronic music artists, they were musical geniuses.  Now I'm planning on getting a Daft Punk sleeve when I am old enough to not give a shit about tattoos. I want to regard them as my favorite band of all time. <3"

I was a huge fan of TRON:Legacy even if the story and such was a bit iffy, just because of the art style, effects, and of course the music. A new TRON film, even if it didn't have a Daft Punk soundtrack, would've been awesome, so it's a shame we'll likely never see one."

I can't shake this feeling that OP is insinuating that Skrillex being interviewed is a bad thing - I could be wrong and I don't mean to be so insinuating - but I don't see that as a bad thing at all. It's always good to have such a wide spectrum of people interviewed. Skrillex may be completely different genre than Daft Punk, but I believe he will be able to provide another angle on the EDM culture. This film is looking very promising, they've done their research. I also really enjoyed BBC's documentary on Nile Rodgers, so this is shaping up to be an incredible film."
DaftPunk,37ten3,iiRockpuppy,5,Sat May 30 11:33:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, I am by no means a fan of Skrillex but he's dons quite a lot for making the EDM genre bigger. I think it'll be interesting to hear what he has to say about the robots and their influence."

All the others have worked with and have been associated with Daft Punk in quite a big way, so it makes sense to have them interviewed. Skrillex just doesn't fit."
DaftPunk,37ten3,MrChestnut,22,Sat May 30 07:33:13 2015 UTC,"But how would it be informative to just interview individuals who simply worked with Daft Punk? I like the idea of Skrillex being in there not for what he has done for mainstream music, but to be able to hear how such a world renowned musician was affected and inspired to create his work by only hearing Daft Punk perform."
DaftPunk,37ten3,Nikolaki8,5,Sat May 30 07:44:01 2015 UTC,"I have no doubt Skrillex will have interesting things to say, but the fact is that this documentary wouldn't be as interesting unless people that are directly related with the duo are involved, especially since Thomas and Guy themselves aren't appearing."
DaftPunk,37ten3,MrChestnut,2,Sat May 30 09:04:21 2015 UTC,"But I still have to disagree to the notion that this documentary would be more interesting if it interviewed more people ""directly related"" to Daft Punk. There's only so much that can be said about the robots themselves. It's obvious that each individual that is being interviewed brings a unique view to the world of Daft Punk, but if we don't have someone who's on the outside, who's like one of us, the story won't be complete. And what's special with Skrillex is that while he is a listener like us, he is also lauded by many to be on the forefront of the broad genre we call electronic music. He's a perfect example of someone who isn't directly related to Daft Punk but is directly related to the realm of music Daft Punk cohabits."
DaftPunk,37ten3,Nikolaki8,-2,Sat May 30 10:34:19 2015 UTC,"It is a Daft Punk documentary, not a electronic music documentery or a French house documentery. I completely agee with you that it's necessary to have someone on the outside to contribute to the documentery, but like I said before, the duo themselves are not appearing in it. Making most of the interviews being with their collaborators will honestly be the best and most interesting way to go about creating this film."
DaftPunk,37ten3,iiRockpuppy,2,Sat May 30 10:57:57 2015 UTC,"Daft Punk is so influential to EDM music as a whole. They set a standard with Alive 2007, some people regard that and Coachella 2006 was the tipping point of EDM. I think it's incredibly important to have someone who was so central during the rise of the EDM movement, so Skrillex definitely fits that."
DaftPunk,37ten3,Nikolaki8,1 point,Sat May 30 11:31:28 2015 UTC,And I completely agree. Information and events such as that will hopefully make this documentary textbook.
DaftPunk,37ten3,iiRockpuppy,1 point,Sat May 30 12:23:32 2015 UTC,"There's plenty enough people on there as is. And I'm sure that's not even the entire list, they're just spotlighting the popular people. Todd Edward and DJ Falcon will most likely be included."
DaftPunk,37ten3,Nikolaki8,1 point,Sat May 30 11:28:33 2015 UTC,I theres gonna be exclusive interviews with the duo themselves
DaftPunk,37ten3,VonDozier,3,Sat May 30 10:23:47 2015 UTC,Really? I thought I read that they had no involvement in the film. Do you happen to have a source?
DaftPunk,37ten3,QuartrMastr,0,Sat May 30 10:29:49 2015 UTC,Crap whoops...must've read the article wrong...i cannot confirm =\
DaftPunk,37ten3,QuartrMastr,2,Sat May 30 10:33:57 2015 UTC,"He is a huge persona in modern electronic music, and was directly influenced by Daft Punk. It'd be stupid not to have him say a few things."
DaftPunk,37ten3,iiRockpuppy,4,Sat May 30 21:36:40 2015 UTC,I wonder what Romanthony would have to say...
DaftPunk,37ten3,QuartrMastr,-1,Sat May 30 22:51:25 2015 UTC,Umm...you know he's dead right? And if you're trying to be funny that's not cool man
DaftPunk,37ten3,iiRockpuppy,1 point,Sun May 31 03:35:19 2015 UTC,I'm not trying to be funny. I loved the guy and I miss his voice in music.
DaftPunk,37ten3,QuartrMastr,-2,Sun May 31 04:24:34 2015 UTC,What does that have to do with anything?
DaftPunk,37ten3,antkappa,2,Sun May 31 03:19:44 2015 UTC,He was involved in one of their hits! I just want to know how he felt about Daft Punk's growth as musicians.
DaftPunk,37ten3,nebjammer,1 point,Sun May 31 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to tell you this if you don't already know, but unfortunately Romanthony passed away in 2013 passed away from a kidney disease.  See, I thought you were wondering what would Romanthony think of Skrillex getting interviewed if he could still share his thoughts. Apologies."
DaftPunk,37ten3,Caseman984,2,Sun May 31 04:30:53 2015 UTC,I was here when the news was heard. He was a good soul gone.
DaftPunk,37ten3,iiRockpuppy,2,Sun May 31 04:36:34 2015 UTC,They've mentioned in the past they have a lot of respect for Skrillex so no surprises.
DaftPunk,37ten3,SIMULATIONTERMINATED,1 point,Sun May 31 11:14:43 2015 UTC,"Sigh... I get tired of this circlejerk of hating an artist's music, specifically Skrillex's.   I could write books on how fucking bad I hate Five Finger Death Punch all fucking day, but that doesn't mean I should act like a total jackass when they're brought up in conversation.   What is it? You hate mainstream? Is that it?  You know what's worse than mainstream? You being into that one band that literally no other person has heard of before, and that band will not ever see the light of day, no matter how hard you try to get other people to see it, they never hit it big, they disband, you don't get to hear more of your favorite music. You can't talk to other fans of that band because they don't exist.   That's what you deal with if there is no mainstream."
DaftPunk,37ten3,iiRockpuppy,-5,Wed Jun 3 07:12:14 2015 UTC,It'll present a nice comparison between people with talent and that jackass.
DaftPunk,37ten3,SIMULATIONTERMINATED,0,Sat May 30 16:46:20 2015 UTC,Is there something wrong he did that would make you say that?
DaftPunk,37ten3,iiRockpuppy,-5,Sat May 30 19:08:42 2015 UTC,Yes he made terrible music
DaftPunk,37ten3,SIMULATIONTERMINATED,2,Sat May 30 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"I don't see how someone who made ""terrible music"" could be among one of the ""world's richest DJs"", alongside Daft Punk. The fact that he has so much popularity absolutely proves that a wide portion of people appreciate his work. We all just have different tastes is all. I don't see how that makes him a ""jackass"" though."
DaftPunk,37ten3,iiRockpuppy,0,Sat May 30 23:36:13 2015 UTC,Wait so just because he's rich that means he is talented? Fuck that logic. There are so many shitty musicians who are loaded.
DaftPunk,37ten3,SIMULATIONTERMINATED,2,Sun May 31 00:53:30 2015 UTC,"He earned his royalties because people enjoyed his work. If enough people enjoy someone's work, they will go to the artist's concerts and tours and that artist will gain a huge amount of money. Money = Power. Plain and simple."
DaftPunk,37ten3,Sleek_Bones,0,Sun May 31 01:00:47 2015 UTC,Uh yea I know how income works. Just because someone is wealthy it doesn't make them a good artist.
DaftPunk,37uaox,GreenNoivern,19,Sat May 30 13:23:33 2015 UTC,Digital Love and Discovery. Digital Love has been my favourite song since the moment I first heard it... nothing's ever replaced it.

DaftPunk,37uaox,tray2012,5,Sat May 30 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"I think End of Line from TRON:Legacy is damn good - the bassline in particular. It is very well done, and perfectly mastered. Also, Ouverture from Daft Club is something that just hits the spot when I'm in the mood for something else.  Discovery is my flavourite Album"
DaftPunk,37uaox,Rallerboy888,5,Sat May 30 15:37:04 2015 UTC,Favorite song is Something About Us and favorite album is a tie between Discovery and Random Access Memories.

DaftPunk,37oj5q,JamesLiptonIcedTea,28,Fri May 29 17:26:32 2015 UTC,"An argument over what their best album is has no place in this subreddit or even the music culture in general. Everyone has a personal opinion of what good music is and that is really what makes music so interesting and fun to dissect.   My personal self still says that Discovery is their best. I have many reasons for this claim. The sampling, the cord the progressions, the game changing synth structure, and even the order of songs. SAU -> Voyager -> Veridis Quo.... Doesn't get much better imo.  RAM is absolutely amazing in its own respect. The production value and work that went into it is incredible and that's that. Like most of you said ""it is well polished"". Doesn't mean it's their best or that it sucks. Again, it's all about preference when it comes to ""what is the best"". Motherboard rules!!!"
DaftPunk,37oj5q,BugsJits,8,Fri May 29 21:24:23 2015 UTC,I still like Discovery the most

DaftPunk,37oj5q,foxh8er,8,Fri May 29 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like on RAM they are doing their best to sound like the bands which influenced their earlier work, instead of sampling them to create something new and unique.  When it first came out, I thought RAM was incredibly boring. It has grown on me a little bit but Homework and Discovery are still far superior in my opinion."

DaftPunk,37oj5q,juangod1,4,Fri May 29 10:42:47 2015 UTC,I dont think you've ever done drugs if you think that  Nah but I just think Discovery is a million times better
DaftPunk,37oj5q,afferik,4,Fri May 29 16:36:41 2015 UTC,"People actually say this? RAM is a goddamn masterpiece, and probably in my list of best albums of all time."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,snackdaniels,18,Fri May 29 16:52:33 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what your personal preferences are, RAM is their best album critically. The production, the melodies, the mixing, the composition... no other album of theirs matches RAM. I'm not saying you're wrong in thinking that Discovery or Homework is their best album, not at all. That's the beauty of their work, every fan is divided on what they think is their best. However, if you look at the album critically instead of personally, regardless if you love or hate RAM, it is the better album."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,Nikolaki8,12,Fri May 29 13:10:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. There was a lot of hype surrounding RAM and it's much more universal in its appeal, whereas Homework was a pure house record & Discovery was still a fairly niche dance record when it was released. There's no doubt that Discovery had more cultural impact with the number of big tunes on that album and its regularly featured in the top lists for the year or decade, upon reflection.  I just don't think RAM will have that same legacy and be remembered in the same way, it is too polished and not as exciting. It has amazing immersive moments but I haven't found myself returning to it much to be honest, bar maybe 3 absolutey brilliant tracks."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,digitag,8,Fri May 29 06:01:45 2015 UTC,"When RAM came out, a lot of pop and mainstream radio started to become heavily influenced by funk and nu-disco sounds. While this might not be completely attributed to RAM, it definitely was a major influence in this sudden and refreshing change of pop music in the mainstream radio.   I personally do believe RAM will have a legacy. I'm going to assume that you grew up listening to Discovery and Homework, which is most likely a contributing factor to why you prefer those albums over RAM. You loved the distinct polished production yet the unworked overall sound which gave those albums their own unique flair. RAM came out and was a disappointment to you and many other older Daft Punk fans. However, the amount of people who discovered and loved Daft Punk from RAM will think exactly the same as you in the future when they start to release other music that sounds distant from their other work.   Also, while it might not mean a lot to you, RAM won a tonne of awards, much more than any of their other work which will inadvertently make people remember the album more."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,Nikolaki8,4,Fri May 29 08:13:55 2015 UTC,"Well I guess we'll see won't we. I did kind of grow up with them but didn't properly get into the albums until my late teens/early 20s I'd say. It was a gateway into a lot of dance music for me, but my taste is very eclectic so I'm not just into house music.  Thing is, even though I didn't get massively into Discovery as a kid, the songs were everywhere, on the radio, in clubs etc. Even now you put on One More Time, HBFS, Digital Love and everyone knows what's going on. RAM only really has Get Lucky and Get Lucky isn't a very good song. RAM's best moments are when it gets more experimental: Giorgio By Moroder, Touch etc. but a lot of the rest of it is filler for me. It doesn't excite me emotionally or interest me musically as much so I found it listenable but a bit dull after a while (with the exception of those really fascinating, more experimental songs mentioned above)"
DaftPunk,37oj5q,digitag,1 point,Fri May 29 08:26:56 2015 UTC,"Yup I agree with you, RAM won't have a lasting legacy. I'm going to get hate, but I absolutely loathed RAM, I was soooo dissapointed in th album it's not even funny.  Starting October/Nov 2012 I was all over the net to try to find new info on this upcoming album. I heard the Get Lucky teaser, and I was in coachella when more of the teaser was released. Finally   The Album was leaked on torrents about 4/5 days before release date (that's why the album was put up on itunes streaming I guess to combat the leak) and I was sooo dissapointed. I went upstairs and showed my sister the album, and her first words ""Wtf is this shit"" I didn't tell her who the artist was.  Same with a lot of ppl who liked daft punk they were all dissapointed. The fact that pissed me off more is how during the marketing they had those pics of them doing the same pose as MichaelJackson, while the album was NOWHERE near the caliber of MJ.  I understand what the album was trying to do, but at the end of the day the album was simply... Dull, It doesn't have that upbeaty beat that Disco has (get lucky does have this), the album is nowhere near the level of the works of bee gees, sister sledge, MJ, KC & the sunshine etc etc., compared to all of these artists RAM sounds dull as fukc. ""BUt YEAh BRO!!!! I'm like on my 4th listen and I'M starting to like it, you just dont understand it.    But still motherboard is still one helluva of song  My closing comments Compare RAM to Discovery (as in songs that ppl know)RAM most ppl only know of Get lucky and Lose yourself to dance (which the latter has the cheesiest lyrics ever which is why I didn't like the song at the end of the day) vs discovery which had: Face to face, One more Time, Harder better..., Aerodynamic, Crescencedolls, RAM just doesn't compare at all, I truly believe RAM was a hit only because it was created by daft punk.  ALso why isn't chromeos white women getting a bunch of accolades as well? it's a better version of RAM"
DaftPunk,37oj5q,That0nekid1,4,Fri May 29 08:37:15 2015 UTC,"""RAM won't have a lasting legacy""   Like I said in a previous comment:   ""I'm going to assume that you grew up listening to Discovery and Homework, which is most likely a contributing factor to why you prefer those albums over RAM. You loved the distinct polished production yet the unworked overall sound which gave those albums their own unique flair. RAM came out and was a disappointment to you and many other older Daft Punk fans. However, the amount of people who discovered and loved Daft Punk from RAM will think exactly the same as you in the future when they start to release other music that sounds distant from their other work.""   ""The fact that pissed me off more is how during the marketing they had those pics of them doing the same pose as MichaelJackson, while the album was NOWHERE near the caliber of MJ.""   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that was fan created image so I don't think that's a very fair argument. Also they weren't really trying to be MJ, they wanted those 'west coast' sounds such as Hall and Oates and they definitely succeeded in that respect.   ""but at the end of the day the album was simply... Dull, It doesn't have that upbeaty beat that Disco has (get lucky does have this), the album is nowhere near the level of the works of bee gees, sister sledge, MJ, KC & the sunshine etc etc., compared to all of these artists RAM sounds dull as fukc.""   Again, my point is they didn't listen to the Bee Gees and KC to get inspiration for the album. I'm not really sure what you mean with RAM being 'dull'. Contact and GBM are monsters of songs when it comes to excitement.   ""Lose yourself to dance (which the latter has the cheesiest lyrics ever which is why I didn't like the song at the end of the day)""   So songs like Emotion, Robot Rock and TRTN all get a free pass because they have deep lyrics? This is Daft Punk we're talking about here. LYTD is a dance song, the lyrics are catchy, the groove is dance-y and the buildups and crescendos are incredible. I don't think it's fair to completely disregard an entire 6 minute track just because the very few lyrics that aren't artistic marvels. Also more people know Instant Crush than they do LYTD.   ""I truly believe RAM was a hit only because it was created by daft punk.""   This is the one argument about RAM that actually gets me angry. I strongly and firmly believe that no other artist or band but Daft Punk could've made an album like RAM. Sure, their marketing campaign helped with the album's popularity, no question. However, the accolades it received, the praise it got, and the hype that was surrounding it was because it simply was a fantastic album. The amount of detail that was put into creating this album is like no other I've heard. The production is simply incredible. The mixing and mastering is brilliant and the songwriting is fantastic. This album was popular because it was great, not because Daft Punk made it.   ""ALso why isn't chromeos white women getting a bunch of accolades as well? it's a better version of RAM""   Comparing White Women to RAM is like comparing Justice's first album to their second, arbitrary because they're completely different. You can't assume they are similar justice because they fall under the umbrella term of funk or electronic music. It can't be a 'better version of RAM' because it isn't even close to being any version of RAM. Also they came out in separate years which might explain why you think WW isn't getting as much praise. That and Chromeo isn't exactly a headliner band..."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,Nikolaki8,6,Fri May 29 20:32:13 2015 UTC,"For me it is lacking a true incredible track like Da funk, around the world ,hbfs ,something about us, human after all, make love, technologic.   I love all the tracks of ram (instant crush not so much) but I won't put any of them in my top 5 of daft punk tracks.  The three tracks in my opinion that are nearly as incredible as the ones on previous albums are give life back to music, within, and lose yourself to dance."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,steo0315,7,Fri May 29 22:06:57 2015 UTC,"Really? That's interesting. Contact, GBM and LYTD I think are probably in at least the duo's top ten.  I feel like nostalgia and catchiness plays a big part in people's opinions of their previous albums. Obviously there's nothing wrong with that, but RAM isn't an album you listen to for the first time and love every song straight off the bat. It grows on you over time. You end up appreciating it more and start finding more and more subtle details every new time you to it.   As with tracks like Around the World and HBFS, while fantastic songs, you loved listening to them the first time you heard them, correct? I feel like that kind of indicator shows how mature RAM is in comparison to what else they've put out over the years. I'm not saying catchiness automatically equals immature, but I am saying that 1997 and 2001 Daft Punk could not make a track even close to as detailed, refined and mature as Touch or GBM."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,Nikolaki8,4,Fri May 29 07:11:21 2015 UTC,"I did love every track of RAM on first listening (not instant crush). I hated most of Homework and Human After All at first listening. Because these two albums were really a new kind of music (at least for me). I like to say Homework / HAA are about the future (especially Homework) and Discovery / RAM are about the past (respectively using samples of music the robots loved when they were children, and trying to feel the time before the internet again).  I really hope their next album will be about the future again."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,steo0315,2,Fri May 29 07:39:52 2015 UTC,"Hate when people say things like this. ""You can totally have your own opinion, bruv, but X is objectively their best album."""

DaftPunk,37oj5q,shabutaru118,1 point,Fri May 29 10:36:49 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way, everyone loves The Room because the whole ""so bad it's good"" mentality. Personally, all those people love that movie! It's fun to watch with friends and it's a good time all around. Critically, however, the movie is one of the worst ever made. From an artistic standpoint, everything about the movie is terrible.  There is a massive difference between personal and critical opinion, I don't see why people such as yourself get so worked up and aggressive over trying to understand my point of view."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,Nikolaki8,2,Fri May 29 22:56:36 2015 UTC,"personal and critical opinion,    Because you're literally saying your opinion is correct because it is ""critical"".  That is all you are doing.  The definition of the word ""critically"" is; inclined to find fault or to judge with severity, often too readily.  Just because you insert some extra word doesn't mean you can argue RAM is the best album.  You're just a pretentious fuck."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,shabutaru118,2,Fri May 29 23:54:16 2015 UTC,I stand by my comments 100%. Is it really so hard to understand what I'm trying to convey here? You defining the word critically doesn't really prove anything you're trying to say. I don't understand why you're being so hostile.
DaftPunk,37oj5q,Nikolaki8,-6,Sat May 30 00:06:15 2015 UTC,if you can't look into their other albums and find that the construction of some of the songs shits on RAM 20 times then i have a problem with you
DaftPunk,37oj5q,boxenstien,4,Sat May 30 01:11:15 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure what you're trying to say?
DaftPunk,37oj5q,Nikolaki8,-4,Fri May 29 07:17:31 2015 UTC,look at the way songs such as High Life are crafted and get back to me
DaftPunk,37oj5q,boxenstien,6,Fri May 29 07:31:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, the micro-sampling used for the track is extraordinary and honestly I don't think many electronic musicians today can make something as complicated and unique as High Life, however the 'structure', as you call it, is pretty... well, boring (for this track in particular).  The 'structure' pales in comparison to every song on RAM  for sure (aside from maybe Motherboard which can get a little boring even though I love the track), especially in tracks like Touch and GBM.   Not sure why you seem so agitated over my comments."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,Nikolaki8,-4,Fri May 29 07:43:06 2015 UTC,"i'm not agitated lmfao ram just isnt the masterpiece that people make it out to be, imo."

I understand you may think different to me but you haven't addressed a single point I made in my response to you. It doesn't seem very fair that you blatantly disregard my opinion with no explanation when I'm doing the exact opposite to you."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,Nikolaki8,7,Fri May 29 07:52:43 2015 UTC,"It's not bad per se, it's just really different from their traditional style. For a robotic duo it felt too much like jazz hip hop than house like they used to make. I can appreciate it in its own right but its not very daft punk like."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,IrrelevantLeprechaun,6,Fri May 29 07:58:32 2015 UTC,"RAM itself is decent. It's not bad by any means, but it's certainly not the God sent people make it out to be. On a personal level, I still believe Discovery to be Daft Punk's master piece. I don't think they'll ever make something that flows so perfectly from front to back.  My real grip with this album is WHY it did so well. Yes, we can attribute a decent portion of it to Daft Punk's skill in general, they're very good at what they do. But I still feel that this album only REALLY did well BECAUSE it was by Daft Punk, and because of all the hype it got, being Daft Punk's first new studio album in roughly eight years.  What I'm saying is, that if RAM were not released by Daft Punk, and instead was released by some new, no-name band, with no hype, no where near as many people would have cared, and no where near as many people would be praising it."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,NightShark62,3,Fri May 29 13:53:15 2015 UTC,The progression from Homework through RAM becomes intuitive when you're about the same age as the robots and have grown up as they have. I was a DJ and raver when Homework came out. I'm a dad who works in IT now.  RAM made perfect sense to me. The albums are like my kids: I love them all equally for what they are.
DaftPunk,37oj5q,evannever,3,Fri May 29 14:51:58 2015 UTC,"Personally, nothing has ever even come close to topping Discovery for me, Daft Punk or any other artist for that matter. So none of the other albums are comparable to me. RAM is a good album, but I can't lie and say I wasn't disappointed when I first listened. It's actually still in the CD player of my car to this day, since its release two years ago. It definitely grows on you, and Doin' It Right was/is an instant favorite for me, but Discovery was truly a masterpiece and I don't think it will ever be bested (IMO of course).  tl;dr - it's as good as the other albums not named Discovery"
DaftPunk,37oj5q,BadNewsBryant,3,Fri May 29 14:49:22 2015 UTC,"i don't think its bad compared to other albums, i just think it is not as good. Nothing can even come close to Discovery and Human After All is near perfect. so again not bad but not as good."

DaftPunk,37oj5q,baldgye,8,Sat May 30 03:58:04 2015 UTC,"I started listening to Daft Punk for their electronic house; RAM was a huge letdown for me, it's not what I was looking for at all.  It's a great piece of art, but it's not catchy electronic house that I can jam to for hours at a time. I tried to let RAM grow on me, I listened to it as much as I could. However, unlike previous albums, RAM just started to grate on my ears the more I listened to it.  It's just so far from my expectations, and combined with my disappointment of missing their 'glory days' of loud, bright, electronic festivals, RAM just felt out of touch for me."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,Tehelee,5,Sun May 31 10:57:08 2015 UTC,"I think this is mostly why some people don't like it, and I can certainly understand the sentiment. It's not what is expected from an artist like Daft Punk.  But for me RAM was very exciting and represents further evolution and musical growth for them. The songs are not as repetitive and are more developed. Live instruments are used much more, giving it more of a jazz feel and showcasing the great musicianship of the guest artists.  I guess it just depends on the person and what you expect from the album."
DaftPunk,37oj5q,Mortos3,6,Fri May 29 06:21:40 2015 UTC,"I too understand the desire for music of the type that made them amazing, but this is what I love about Daft Punk: They never rest on their laurels.

Im not surprised it took ten years to find it. I think the main reason on why it took so long was because most of the older vinyl isnt uploaded to youtube, even less 10 years ago.

The friends that were driving (11 hours each way) were leaving too early and I couldn't bail on work, so I bought a flight to Victoria, BC then took the ferry from Victoria to Seattle.   Foolishly I didn't prepurchase my ferry ticket so I had to go stand-by. I literally got the LAST seat on the ferry and these wanker yanks weren't going to move their bag to let me sit down, so I had to ask a porter to ask them to move it because it was the only seat available on the entire ferry.  If I had to wait for the next boat I'd have missed the beginning of the show.  It was a good trip, but ended up being pretty pricey, luckily I was able to catch a ride back with my friends so I only had to pitch for gas."

DaftPunk,37j0b0,MyBrotherTypedThat,3,Thu May 28 00:34:42 2015 UTC,"Naw, this is definitely an audio-only interview that they cut a bunch of footage over. For one, the audio is too clear to be recorded on location, it sounds like they're talking directly into mics in a studio. Also, all the parts where it would seem that they're talking are way too over the top, and it's clear that they're just pantomime talking. I don't see any extended segments that actually suggest they're being interviewed in this video.   That being said, it was really enjoyable, and I had never seen this vid before!

DaftPunk,36vp03,s0r00t,12,Fri May 22 20:16:17 2015 UTC,took 5 seconds of googling to show that it's one of many accepted forms.
DaftPunk,36vp03,doomsday1216,6,Fri May 22 21:39:29 2015 UTC,"Well it does. It's been a while since I took Latin, but I know the phrase"" in vino veritas"" means ""in wine there is truth"".   If I recall correctly veridis actually means ""green"". Quo has a lot of meanings, probably the most important one is the adverb ""where"" from qui, or the ablative pronoun and adjective forms of qui ""who"" or ""which"", and then also the interrogative ablative pronouns from quis ""who?"" or ""which?""   It's been a while since I took Latin though, so I'm probably not 100%."
DaftPunk,36vp03,fliphopanonymous,1 point,Fri May 22 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"""Another theory suggests that the expression originates from the Latin (as a word play too, not as a grammatically correct origin) in which Veridis is derived from the Latin word veritas, which means 'truth', and the word Quo which designates the concept of 'place', resulting in the full meaning of the phrase as «where truth is found»."""
DaftPunk,36vp03,s0r00t,1 point,Sat May 23 11:50:18 2015 UTC,Yeah that's a great theory but Thomas even said that it wasn't meant to mean truth. I can't remember the interview exactly but he pretty much couldn't remember what it meant anymore.   It's most obviously just a play on the phrase Very Disco and Discovery. Occam's Razor is the best justification for that.

DaftPunk,36vp03,dogstarman,31,Fri May 22 15:17:26 2015 UTC,"Thomas Bangalter on Veridis Quo-November 24, 2000:  Veridis Quo is really wierd because we can't really remember the meaning of this track anymore at all. Veridis, there is different explanations for veridis: It could be close to veriatas which is truth, you could check in latin, but its not really that so we re still looking to see what etymological sense there is to it because veridis does not seem to have a proper match in Latin. ... I dont know if we appreciate the wierdness or not. I think the state of being somewhere and realising you are in some place can be funny and can be very scary or just mystical.... I think this track is also about the loss of time and reality and space and time,. Space Continuum, A void. Like you said it was like Giorgio Moroder but it can sound like classical music but at the same time it can sound like futuristic music so its really wierd to see the future and the past like shoooo, circling. So from something that might be the music of the future, like electronic chord and harmony, but also music from centuries ago, and i think we like this idea of linking both ends. And you just get lost in the void.  Source"

On the road away Rome, he comes across a resurrected Jesus, which is weird because Jesus had been killed years ago.  Peter asks Jesus, ""Quo Vadis?"" which means, ""where are you going?"" Jesus responded, ""Romam vado iterum crucifigi,"" ""To Rome, to be crucified again.""  Jesus' conviction to suffer on behalf of his follower convinced Peter to face the music."

DaftPunk,365mnh,TheHostessTruck,3,Sat May 16 11:38:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much, but I don't understand yet the original source.  This is ""The Game Has Changed"" on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/track/44OU8uZ2h9xVcJgKPJKU77  It's slightly different, even the lenght is different.  If you don't have Spotify:  this is one version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqJkdsqeDxw (according to Spotify it is the song in the Album)  this is another version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fIdIp4xSM[2] (which I can't find on Spotify)"
DaftPunk,365mnh,TheHostessTruck,5,Sat May 16 11:47:19 2015 UTC,I remember when that video was released as it was one of the first videos of the new daft punk. It is seemingly a shortened promo that someone found online and The Game Has Changed is the full thing.

The drum machine isn't something like a 909 that house producers like LKC would use. TLNH on the other hand is very much like classic LKC, especially the chords and production."

DaftPunk,35yc6h,VeloCity666,2,Thu May 14 19:01:05 2015 UTC,I love me some breakbot! All his live sets are full of good disco too!
DaftPunk,35yc6h,railking39,-1,Fri May 15 04:17:35 2015 UTC,"No offense but I don't think breakbot is what OP is asking for. Breakbot just sounds too fast and overproduced, especially compared to Daft Punk. Breakbot just sounds really bland they don't really do anything new I haven't heard better before. Just my opinion.   Newjack - Justice  DANCE - Justice   My opinion is a much better fit"
DaftPunk,35yc6h,jimyt666,1 point,Fri May 15 04:00:27 2015 UTC,Downvoted for having an opinion... at least it contributed to the discussion. I'd say Breakbot has elements that Punk also has but am inclined to agree that they aren't quite the same. It's more like a Michael Jackson produced record if Daft Punk helped.
DaftPunk,35yc6h,Thisisyoureading,1 point,Fri May 15 09:57:48 2015 UTC,I agree with you 100℅ on the Michael Jackson comparison. Who IMO does it far better than breakbot has haha. Gotta love reddits voting system to stifle opinions

DaftPunk,35vatc,Replies_With_GIFs,3,Wed May 13 20:27:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know about European copyright law, but here in America they could get away with it if they called themselves a tribute band and either  A) played straight DP tracks, paying the performance royalties to the proper people (which is easy if the venue has the right license) or  B) played remixes of DP tracks, which they could sell/perform as their own, but would have to pay for the initial use of DP tracks in the remixes, which is more expensive than A.  Regarding the helmets, I don't think there's a such thing as an ""official DP impersonator"" (which could actually work well for the robots in the future) so they could get away with it until Columbia sends them a cease-and-desist letter, which I don't think has happened for DP groups. Again, tribute bands are usually safe, as long as they present themselves as a tribute band."

DaftPunk,35vatc,mother_of_joe_biden,0,Thu May 14 02:15:15 2015 UTC,Thats a dumb idea.
DaftPunk,35vatc,SweetTooth115,2,Mon May 18 13:56:49 2015 UTC,These guys do have a point. Daft Punk never perform any more and tbh they owe the fans enough to at least let acts like this thrive until they come out of hiding again and go on tour.   I don't see the issue here. They aren't advertising themselves as Daft Punk and it's clearly obvious they aren't the actual duo.
DaftPunk,35vatc,Nikolaki8,1 point,Fri May 15 05:18:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, IMO I think they're really cool for trying to give DP fans what we've wanted from the actual DP for years. This tribute band wouldn't exist if Thomas and Guy-Man were more interactive with their fan base and did more gigs. I respect the fact that that isn't the lifestyle the robots want, but I also respect this tribute band for being the Daft Punk that Daft Punk fans want."
DaftPunk,35vatc,thisisumum,1 point,Sat May 16 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"Here's another interview with Eugene of the tribute duo - He briefly addresses the legality of what they're doing:  ""...We hired a solicitor to check the legality. Basically as long as we don't use their intellectual property and play in a licensed venue we're fine.""  Also, if anyone is interested - here is a short video of the tribute duo's live set."
DaftPunk,35vatc,nagget,1 point,Thu May 14 22:44:19 2015 UTC,You also have the One More Time tribute band which does the same thing (although a bit better)  Also: lol at the guys DJing on a Hercules RMX DJ Console— that what I first DJ'd on in my life!
DaftPunk,35ujc4,kougabro,2,Wed May 13 17:00:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely not made by Daft Punk. It's falsely credited to them from a fake EP called ""Complete Reboot"" which is  just a fan-made album simply created to make people think it's an actual EP full of unreleased Daft Punk tracks."

DaftPunk,35od6z,Trevmiester,4,Mon Jun 1 22:54:22 2015 UTC,"funny to think all these redditors commenting were born almost at the same time this song was being released.  I don't feel old at 30, but electronic music in 1985 was completely different from 1995. maybe even more than from 1995 to 2005 or 2015."
DaftPunk,35od6z,rafael000,1 point,Tue May 12 14:33:57 2015 UTC,"Electronic music in 1995 was much more diverse than what is 'popular' electronic music in 2015. There is more electronic music now and still a ton of good songs being produced, but a lot of it is derivative or solely made to be played by a DJ...not as many electronic albums being released nowadays."
DaftPunk,35od6z,240ZT,5,Tue May 12 16:26:16 2015 UTC,"There's still a shitload of good music out there, but just as then, you have to dig deep for it."

DaftPunk,35od6z,retrofag,6,Tue May 12 16:06:25 2015 UTC,"That was the track that really got me into electronic music. I was listening to grunge, metal, & industrial. I saw Da Funk on MTV late at night during the summer of 1995 followed by Chemical Bros Leave Home or Life is Sweet and I went to Tower the next day and bought both singles.   I got really into drum & bass after buying Metalheadz Platinum Breakz the next year. I haven't really listened to any rock since then and never looked back."
DaftPunk,35od6z,240ZT,2,Tue May 12 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're describing my transition perfectly into electronic music at nearly the same time.  For me, it was Orbital's the Box (1996) and Setting Sun by the Chemical Brothers (1996).  I heard Da Funk around the same time. I was 18.  I was listening to a lot of grunge and punk at the time.  I hardly touched the stuff since.  I started DJing in 1997 and now I'm raising my 3 kids on the culture of electronic music."
DaftPunk,35od6z,drmeattornado,2,Tue May 12 18:16:58 2015 UTC,"Orbital was very influential for me too, but Daft Punk was really my first exposure to dance music. I bought 2 Technics 1200s within a year of buying Homework on CD.  I still love dance music and my 5 year old hears a lot of it."
DaftPunk,35od6z,evannever,1 point,Tue May 12 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"I had always listened to electronic music, like 2 Unlimited, Snap, Captain Hollywood, etc, but at that point it was just music.  Setting Sun was the track that made me realize what electronic music was, and my taste in music hasn't been the same since."

I could listen to that song nonstop for my whole life, it's perfect in any situation; you can chill to that song, dance, just go about your day, whatever. And something about those synth timbres and that chord progression really gets me.  Least Favorite: Barring intro/transition songs, as I don't say those would count for anything other than setting a mood, I'd say Teachers. And even then, I don't really hate it, I do like it a good deal, just the vocals are kinda ""mehhhh...?"" sometimes for me. But it's still got a pretty funky beat, and I like the concept."

If you count the Humans in the second part, they add up to 15 for each repetition.

You need to transpose one of these tracks so they harmonize.  One song is in B, and the other is in F, which don't mix well together.  This is what DJ's refer to as a key clash.  Mashups work well together when they are in either the same key or in a harmonious key.  The Camelot Wheel is very helpful for this.  I use this all the time in my own production efforts:  http://www.harmonic-mixing.com/Images/camelotHarmonicMixing.jpg  http://www.thedaftclub.com/features/daft-punk-song-tempos/  EDIT:  Corrected the actual keys of the song.

DaftPunk,34ycgp,foxh8er,4,Mon May 11 05:04:43 2015 UTC,"This is going to get a lot of downvotes, but to me it sounds like he probably has a lot of younger mixers and masterers to do the actual tracks. I can hear his influence in the synthesized strings part, but if you listen closely just the baseline and the way there is ping ponging from R to L and super compression -- it sounds just like everything out right now by Max Martin and Co. Now, I love what Georgio did for music and his innovation back in the day; but I'm unsure this newer stuff is totally him doing the music. I wonder if it's his name; but a lot of younger guys working for him and along with him doing the technicalities of the track. I mean on the daft punk track, he didn't do it at all! That was totally just daft punk. Anybody else agree?"

DaftPunk,34vld3,Maximus837,1 point,Tue May 5 00:42:59 2015 UTC,They were eclectic but that was a reference to their Heros not music they could play in a set. The sets were far more house based and traditional. This is in the mid 90s when DJs were king rather than musicians. While it was house or techno they played they would play a lot of esoteric shit too. A bootleg of themselves and Madonnas holiday for instance but usually pretty heavy with none of the funk or hip hop as Homewerk was their only release. It was 4x4 all the way.

DaftPunk,34jdj1,reddcube,9,Sat May 2 05:35:30 2015 UTC,"You want Pink Floyd. Honestly I could harp on this forever, but I really look at Daft Punk as a modern day Floyd. They're conceptual, large scale, and they tread the line between real art and popular culture in a way that very few have managed to do so. Floyd's been through a lot of eras, the most accessible of which is probably The Dark Side of the Moon, and that's the kind of record that you listen to from start to finish the same way you would Alive 2007. Everything is just so complimentary that if you don't give it that kind of attention you're really robbing yourself. As far as Horizon goes, I think Shine On You Crazy Diamond off their album Wish You Were Here is probably your best bet, but again, the album rewards you for listening to it as a whole. I'd also recommend It's What We Do off their latest and first album in 20 years, The Endless River. This one, again, benefits from added context. I'd recommend listening to tracks 1-3 from that album. Awesome, masterful music making. You might say that these guys were as important to rock music as Daft Punk was to dance music. So damn much rich history behind the project. The texture tends to be a lot different than Daft Punk but on an intellectual level I think the bands have a lot more in common than meets the eye. Let me know what you think.  Edit: Marooned"

""Electroma"" inspired sets, like the duo's Ferrari. ""Interstella 5555.""   Im pretty sure the people at lego arent oblivious and would obviously consider the alive 2007 stage."

DaftPunk,34ekut,ak_toxik,93,Thu Apr 30 14:38:49 2015 UTC,"Copy pasted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes for the lazy: 102 Processing     As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet. This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.  302 Found     This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was ""Moved Temporarily""), but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.  417 Expectation Failed     The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field.  409 Conflict     Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the request, such as an edit conflict in the case of multiple updates.  424 Failed Dependency     The request failed due to failure of a previous request (e.g., a PROPPATCH)  418 I'm a teapot (RFC 2324)     This code was defined in 1998 as one of the traditional IETF April Fools' jokes, in RFC 2324, Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers.

DaftPunk,34b74d,Ready_For_The_Robots,53,Wed Apr 29 19:29:34 2015 UTC,I almost had a heart attack until I realized this was from November. I really hope we will get to hear more about this song.
DaftPunk,34b74d,Finial,23,Wed Apr 29 19:40:18 2015 UTC,"I wonder how much CD space figured into decisions to leave songs off. Like maybe they didn't have enough tracks for a double album, but still had too many for a single album.  They've had multiple opportunities to release the song. They could have at least thrown it onto the high-res flash drive that came in the expensive set, so maybe they just don't like it. Here's hoping other plans are in store, though."
DaftPunk,34b74d,BBGrunt1235,13,Wed Apr 29 22:01:58 2015 UTC,"Considering how small Daft punk's body of work is, it leads to reason that they don't release something they aren't completely happy with. They don't do ""cutting room floor"" extra tracks."
DaftPunk,34b74d,IrrelevantLeprechaun,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:38:05 2015 UTC,"And still, they are yet to disappoint"
DaftPunk,34b74d,NazDaBaz,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:58:03 2015 UTC,Wasn't Daft Club pretty much exactly that?
DaftPunk,34b74d,socialite-buttons,7,Thu Apr 30 09:13:12 2015 UTC,No that was almost all remixes by others. It was related to the online music club and was also released to promote the  Interstella 5555 film.
DaftPunk,34b74d,Mortos3,1 point,Thu Apr 30 09:48:22 2015 UTC,"Idk about Ouverture (probably a standalone track), but Aerodynamite was a B-Side to Aerodynamic. The rest are remixes (Basement Jaxx's is WTF)"
DaftPunk,34b74d,mrhoosteen,2,Sat May 9 21:14:01 2015 UTC,"Well you gotta remember daft punk is mainly a vinyl group. The reason Horizon got released as a Japanese bonus track was because they didn't have room for it on the vinyl without messing up the track orders. So they released it in a country with no vinyl market. But still, I think the reason they didn't release this song is because it just wasn't good enough."
DaftPunk,34b74d,Andman17,4,Fri May 1 20:47:02 2015 UTC,Hopefully it will resurface soon!
DaftPunk,34b74d,schugi,-12,Wed Apr 29 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a song that could have lost the album of the year to be honest. I mean that in a good way. I'd probably like the track, but the masses would have been confused (like they are with most house tracks lol)  Edit: Are you guys fucking kidding me? Get your head out of your asses. I'm not saying anything controversial here. A track was left out of the album for a reason. The song don't fit and we got a beautiful untarnished album in the process."
DaftPunk,34b74d,Takeabyte,12,Wed Apr 29 20:41:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, house music is suuuper obscure and unpopular, only the enlightened among us listen to it ;)"

DaftPunk,34b74d,113mac113,13,Thu Apr 30 02:22:49 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a song that could have lost the album of the year to be honest...   If Julian and the duo like the track, there's no reason it would've done badly other than it not fitting with the rest of the album.    ...the masses would have been confused (like they are with most house tracks lol).   Lol what're you talking about? None of RAM is even close to being house music. How can you say people would be 'confused' when the track isn't even released yet?"
DaftPunk,34b74d,Nikolaki8,2,Thu Apr 30 03:07:55 2015 UTC,"This is off topic but I'm still a bit chuffed that RAM didn't have any house music at all on it, especially considering every other album had house elements.   Sometimes when I listen to RAM I forget it's Daft Punk for how far it strays from their previous albums.   Side tangent over. Continue."
DaftPunk,34b74d,IrrelevantLeprechaun,-6,Wed Apr 29 21:37:22 2015 UTC,"You're two replays contradict themselves. As we both agree, this unreleased track would not have fit in with the rest of the album. We get to that guess because of the way Julian describes the track as very repetitive and weird. Sounds like a house track to me."

DaftPunk,347eeb,GoodEnough4aPoke,2,Wed Apr 29 05:16:02 2015 UTC,"Could you go into a bit more detail with what they are? So far, I've found that they had a section toward the end of ATW/HBFS that included Technologic in one; there was another that I can't confirm atm but there was a small intro of Steam Machine on another track; I think it was ATW/HBFS. It used the studio synth sounds of Steam Machine, not just the vocal to transition."
DaftPunk,347eeb,GoodEnough4aPoke,4,Wed Apr 29 14:12:59 2015 UTC,"Only reason why I know is because I use to check youtube after each show and would gather the differences from attendee footage. Coachella 2006  was the first show and a good benchmark to see the changes from the first show to the final product (07 tour)   Yeah,  ""Burnin'"" was not featured in the 2006 set (instead there's a cool brief technologic/around the world mashup leading into ""Too Long"").  Some other things I remember off the top of my head:   When the beat of ""Television Rules the Nation"" hits, there was no ""World...World...World"" like there is with the final set version. Although I'm pretty sure they made this change right away into the 06' Tour. ""Phoenix"" was not featured in the set (leading into Prime Time of Your Life). Although Phoenix doesn't get title credit in ""Aerodynamic Beats/Forget about the world"", it's there    The end of Da Funk / Daftendirekt is a little different. No Encore   The visuals may have been different during some parts as well."

DaftPunk,34503h,Need_a_Ladder,1 point,Wed Apr 29 10:56:38 2015 UTC,What? Mark Ronson and Bruno fit into funk like a glove. IMO it perfectly emulates the style of music and era they were going for. You don't have to like the song but it does its job perfectly.
DaftPunk,34503h,Nikolaki8,2,Wed Apr 29 11:25:46 2015 UTC,"Well I'm biased against Bruno Mars anyway, so my opinion of his music doesn't count for much."

DaftPunk,34503h,sackman66mode,10,Tue Apr 28 23:35:26 2015 UTC,"Personally I think that it is a fantastic album. Nothing by daft punk has ever crossed into so many territories and their mastery of using electronic sweeps and filters has transcended anything comprehensible. It was a perfect amalgamation of all of their influences and their previous works including tron drawing from everything from classical to 1920 jazz, to whatever the fuck was contact. I could discuss this album for ages. Don't think that I'm not a fan of the classic edm of discovery. But this outclasses that album and is so far from a cheap thrill. Discovery is over of my to favorite 15 albums. I only hope Ram gets better with time. Comments would be greatly appreciated."

DaftPunk,34503h,-dolantello-,4,Tue Apr 28 13:16:57 2015 UTC,"When I first heard Get Lucky, Giorgio by Moroder etc I was kinda disappointed at Daft Punk's departure from their traditional, more electronic style, and only gave it a trivially brief listen before consigning it to the ""albums I don't like by artists I like"" pile, but after so long(Too Long you could say) I came back to it just to try it, and I love it. New funk and disco elements done in a somehow typically Daft Punk manner. Now that I properly listen and think, I can see how much of a typical Daft Punk-esque sound it is."

DaftPunk,34503h,razor5cl,4,Wed Apr 29 21:12:28 2015 UTC,I think it was great to have another album. But I do miss the robot vibe that doesn't seem very prevalent in ram.
DaftPunk,34503h,Need_a_Ladder,3,Tue Apr 28 20:48:45 2015 UTC,"Experimental isn't how I'd describe it, they had a good idea of the sound they wanted to produce for each song. It's my favorite album by Daft Pink as of yet. It brought them to a new level of music making."

DaftPunk,34503h,Mazlr93,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:06:56 2015 UTC,Love it. Before I ever even heard of Daft Punk I was a major fan of funk/disco music. I have never found something disco/funk that I like more than this album. Its unique blend of electronic and disco just makes me want to dance (and I'm not exactly such a dancer). Gold. Absolute gold.

RAM is extremely good music but I feel like Discovery was an extremely good adventure."
DaftPunk,34503h,DoYouHowShroom,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"Well I'm in the opposite side, I really did not enjoy RAM that much.  When I heard they were going to release a new album I was extremely ecstatic, like most Daft punk fans we were looking forward to something as epic as Discovery, Not discovery 2.0, but something just as good.  After a lackluster HAA (when album was released I always thought it would go be great to remix as the sounds ""were there"" and look at alive 2007 masterpiece) and a surprisingly good Tron soundtrack I was really looking forward to something good.  I remember when the album was leaked on torrents and I downloaded it, I was sooo dissapointed.  My fears from the teaser (get lucky) were correct. When I heard it in coachella I was like F yea, albums gonna be sick thinking hell yea this album is going to sound like this very groovy and sick, but a couple of day later I thought hey what if this is the best song in the album and all the other ones are nowhere near close.  After hearing the album I went up to my sister and showed her the album and she didn't like it either. The album isn't ""dancy"" to me, only songs that I can see as Dance songs in this album are: Get lucky, Lose yourself to dance, and give life to music, everything else is too slow and ""chill"" to dance to, this is an album that you just sit down and listen to and enjoy. But even for me the songs dont feel like they have substance, they're not great. My bar for Daft punk is set very high but this album was just lackluster (and no it's not because It's not EDM, I'm ok with change, as long as said change is ACTUALLY good)   After hearing the album, and talking to people in the following days I decided to go online and see what the ""online community"" had to say about the album and my mind was fully blown.  People saying how amazing the whole album was good ""yea, I mean Lulz you just don't like it because it doesn't have wubbzzz and lazers, it's because its different"" and my personal favorite ""Yea man, like, you sorta have to listen to it a couple of times, I'm on my fourth listen and I'm starting to enjoy it more"", if you eat a burrito and you don't like it the first time, decide to try it out a second time to see if you like it, yet you don't like it again, will you eat it a third time? it's as if people were forcing themselves to like it.  ""The album is masterful, the usage of instruments and the way it sounds is good"" yes the album production was Excellent (thanks to Peter Franco & Mick Guzauski), but just because it sounds really good it doesn't mean it's really good.  I believe this album was such a utter success because 1. it was daft punk and 2. The marketing.  This album was a marking behemoth, the way this was marketed was as if to make it seem as if Daft punk was Mainstream and as if EVERYONE is a daft punk fan, yes Daft punk have always been sorta mainstream (not in the sense of their sound, but popularity), but not SUPER mainstream, everyone knows who they are, but not everyone really listened to them as other mainstream artists. and if the WHOLE album was masterful, why is it that I heard Get lucky 70-80% of the time on the radio and everywhere else, and lose yourself to dance the remaninig %, while the rest of the album got no air time?  Also if this album is being breath as ""a game changer"" and it's getting so much recognition, why didn't Chromeos White women get the same critical aclaim? https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZqsyBiYZFQ2qgg5yNX4Qc5Cb5t_dfyJx  TLDR; album = dissapointing to me.  Give me: Around the world, harder better..., Crescensedolls, Short circuit, Da funk, fresh, Indo silver club, voyager (my fav daft punk song), alive, burnin, Technologic, face to face, too long, high life; give me any of that over anything in RAM (except Motherboard, sorry get lucky I got burned out in you because of the millions of time I heard on the radio and parties.)  Also, Discovery > Homework > HAA > Tron (had an epic adventurish sound that took me away somewhere else) > RAM  also Am I the only one that felt that Giorgio by moroder kinda felt tronish in a way?  EDIT: Don't hate the whole album but I enjoyed: Fragments of time, motherboard, contact, giorgio by moroder, Get lucky, Lose yourself to dance, and horizon (intrumental only) (I didn't like the lyrics, the way they are sung and what the are, is WAYY too cheesy for me)"

Imagine creating the set from the ""Lose Yourself to Dance"" video and placing the band on top... kids would have a blast throwing a DP concert for all of their LEGO dudes... Anyway, I feel like I've talked too much. Just want to see this become a reality is all.  EDIT 1: 3 more days and we are at 9053! AMAZING! WE CAN DO THISSS!  EDIT 2: It's the second most supported project on the LEGO page!!  EDIT 3: Go check out /r/deadmau5 they've been super supportive and have helped us out immensely  EDIT 4: WE DID ITTTTTTTT!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYONE! We all got together and made this thing a reality! Daft Punk promoted the link on their official FB page, so we can thank them for that.

DaftPunk,33v9pu,Paragade,6,Mon Apr 27 07:33:29 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go as far as that. They both have established trademark sounds. The average music listener thinks Skrillex when they hear dubstep just as the average music listener thinks Daft Punk when they hear vocoders/talkboxes.
DaftPunk,33v9pu,Nikolaki8,6,Sun Apr 26 00:25:18 2015 UTC,"Plus he's been moving far away from typical brostep in the last two years or so, his stuff with Diplo as Jack Ü is pretty awesome."
DaftPunk,33v9pu,Nikolaki8,3,Sun Apr 26 06:32:09 2015 UTC,"But that's kind of what I mean. Even if Skrillex makes a metal album next, people will still associate him immediately with dubstep."

Anyway I'm assuming that voting for all three is acceptable, because they're all so fucking brilliant. Though if I HAD to rank them I'd probably go Musique > Mothership Reconnection (feat. Parliament & Funkadelic) [Daft Punk Remix] >  Chord Memory (Daft Punk Remix) (which actually fits with the current poll rankings so far). Incredibly close choices though, Daft Punk's (few) remixes are damn solid. Quality over quantity, after all."
DaftPunk,33q9c7,ETMart,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:52:15 2015 UTC,"The idea and topic was there, the vocals were good, but the execution was sloppy, awkward and just plain bad.   Part of what makes the 'Chicken Tonight; parody work so well is that it was simple, yet well executed, just like the original song. Doin' it Right is sparse in terms of instrumentals, so they had to nail every part, including the lyrics to make the song work."

DaftPunk,33ni28,marcAnthem,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:03:48 2015 UTC,"Going to disagree about the vocals. The vocals in that song are complicated as fuck, not to mention the super long solo at the end. People bag the track for being a 'lazy' song because of the sample that was used, but in reality the vocals compensate more than enough for the lack of original material used."

I remember when it was first announced that Nile Rodgers was going to be working with Daft Punk. This was around Fall 2011. Every single youtube video of anything with Chic mentioned Daft Punk just because we were all picturing what the album would sound like. Then we got news of Chilly Gonzales, Panda Bear, and Paul Williams working with the duo afterwards. I still remember the pic of Guy Man, Bangalter, and Nile Rodgers with Nile saying, ""Currently in the studio!"" (The duo only shown with no head) and that was around February 2012.

DaftPunk,33eiaj,Nikolaki8,3,Wed Apr 22 07:33:59 2015 UTC,But i thought Tiesto didn't like Daft Punk?
DaftPunk,33eiaj,NazDaBaz,3,Tue Apr 21 22:47:06 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they were a huge influence on him but because they were fucking destroying a lot of EDM music when RAM came out, people like Tiesto felt threatened and needed to piggyback on their success by saying something controversial that would make the news, drawing people to listen to his music."

DaftPunk,33a4r5,Good4Josh2,55,Mon Apr 20 21:28:29 2015 UTC,I could see them release it early for stream on Tidal and then come out with a wide release. It would be more of a timed exclusive. It could be a bit similar to how they had Random Access Memories to stream on iTunes before it came out.
DaftPunk,33a4r5,davatsk,34,Mon Apr 20 21:49:11 2015 UTC,That itunes stream was the most life changing time I ever listened to that album.
DaftPunk,33a4r5,mrrobopuppy,15,Tue Apr 21 01:25:05 2015 UTC,It was the first time I ever listened to an album completely from front to back all in one go. Normally I jump around or stop halfway through and move to something else.   RAM was the first. And then I did it again so many more times for that album.
DaftPunk,33a4r5,IrrelevantLeprechaun,12,Tue Apr 21 06:24:40 2015 UTC,Then you need to listen to Discovery beginning to end

DaftPunk,33a4r5,DancezWithMoose,67,Mon Apr 20 21:36:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be released exclusively in Tidal. Has any of their albums been released exclusively on Spotify, iTunes, or Amazon? I'm not Daft Punk, but I doubt they would restrict something as big as an album behind Tidal, maybe a single though."
DaftPunk,33a4r5,AndrewTheShinobi,56,Mon Apr 20 21:43:54 2015 UTC,"If it's an entire album, it'll most likely be a timed exclusive. There's no way they'd cut off the majority of their fanbase for Tidal."

DaftPunk,33a4r5,papersorplastics,19,Tue Apr 21 00:04:12 2015 UTC,Why is it called Tidal? Because it makes it easier for pirates to sail.
DaftPunk,33a4r5,Hugo_ijslijk,14,Tue Apr 21 08:05:52 2015 UTC,That's what Lilly Allen said. One of the best anti-Tidal comments I've seen from a celebrity. And there have been quite a few.
DaftPunk,33a4r5,CabbieRanx,9,Tue Apr 21 02:44:46 2015 UTC,I find Tidal to be a joke to begin with. It's just a scheme for the rich to get richer while screwing over the poor.
DaftPunk,33a4r5,IrrelevantLeprechaun,10,Tue Apr 21 06:23:22 2015 UTC,"Do they own Spotify, iTunes, or Amazon?"
DaftPunk,33a4r5,NazDaBaz,5,Tue Apr 21 00:00:57 2015 UTC,They might exclusively release it on Tidal because it's partly their company. They have a monetary incentive to do so
DaftPunk,33a4r5,Agent-Two-THREE,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:00:47 2015 UTC,Parts of Tron are exclusive on certain platforms and their contract with TIDAL makes certain things exclusive.

DaftPunk,33a4r5,TwentySeventh,32,Mon Apr 20 22:09:20 2015 UTC,1) Very skeptical  2) Even if its on Tidal it will be available on torrents at most an hour later in which I'll download then purchase the album through Amazon or their webstore

DaftPunk,33a4r5,djaeke,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:24:32 2015 UTC,I doubt they wanted to from an artistic standpoint
DaftPunk,33a4r5,Kelsig,2,Tue Apr 21 04:32:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe so but it's not like a huge blemish on their discography. If any artist deserves a 'Best of' album, it'd be Daft Punk to show how they've evolved over the years."
DaftPunk,33a4r5,Nikolaki8,2,Tue Apr 21 11:09:28 2015 UTC,"Well, the rumour stems from something Paul Johnson has said, so it's likely this new album will be something more on the Chicago/French House side. In a lot of their RAM interviews, they talk a lot about how they aren't interested in modern EDM styles, so people fearing the robots turning to big room house or dubstep have nothing to be afraid of."

DaftPunk,33a4r5,speewave,3,Tue Apr 21 00:07:12 2015 UTC,I'm seeing some other sources saying Tidal streaming exclusivity.

DaftPunk,33a4r5,EpsilonSigma,2,Tue Apr 21 03:19:24 2015 UTC,I'll shit out my eyeballs if Daft punk doesnt release an album and go on a world tour in 2017. They do it every 10 years. I get that Daft punk haven't ever made an album within 3 years of each other but after the Grammy wins and increased spotlight I think it's given them a new found drive.
DaftPunk,33a4r5,Smokeeye123,1 point,Tue Apr 21 05:21:27 2015 UTC,They might tour earlier than 2017. We only have two points of reference to assume they only tour every ten years.

DaftPunk,33c8zr,iwaskylester101,2,Tue Apr 21 21:08:50 2015 UTC,"It was used in some of their Daftendirektour sets (fucking LOVE it! :D) but it's currently still a mixing mystery (coining that one :P). I'm doubtful that it's taken from Revolution 909 or Colossus, it's much more likely that it's from an 80s funk/soul track like You're My One And Only (pitched, reversed, EQ'd etc. from the sound of it). The sample's so short and sweet and downright obscure, it'll take some ear to find it. That's one thing I dig about Daft Punk's Homework-era sampling, some of it's practically untraceable."

DaftPunk,33aztp,osorioace,18,Tue Apr 21 01:31:24 2015 UTC,"I think you're taking the rest of their work at face value, especially with such a bold statement on some of their greatest hits like Robot Rock, AtW and OMT. Daft Punk is primarily house, which is exactly repetition, but there is structure and multilayered and ""progession"". RAM is a tribute to all their inspirations  (Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams) and close friends (DJ Falcon, Todd Edwards) who they actually got to collaborate with. RAM is by far their most meticulously constructed album as it took over 5 years to produce, but that doesn't mean the same level of quality is not present in their other work.   You aren't in the minority I don't believe, I think the majority of the fan base considers Discovery to be their best album. Thing is, DP's style thus far has changed from album to album, so there's nearly every kind of variation of house music for anybody to enjoy.   Daft Punk is typically people's first exposure to house music because they're so popular, so they're like a gateway to house music. Because of Daft Punk, I've been exposed to so many facets and genres of - not just house but disco as well - and more bands, to name a few, Justice, Boys Noize, Shook, Calvin Harris, Gorillaz, deadmau5, MGMT, Giorgio Moroder, Chic, Chromeo, Earth Wind &amp; Fire, Stevie Wonder, tons and tons more. I would probably never have the same level of understanding and appreciation for these artists and genres if it were not for Daft Punk."
DaftPunk,33aztp,iiRockpuppy,3,Tue Apr 21 02:14:39 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, but Discovery took the same amount of time as RAM to produce and I believe was even more meticulously worked on than RAM from some of their old interviews I've seen. Spot on analysis though."
DaftPunk,33aztp,SirNarwhal,2,Thu Apr 23 16:25:20 2015 UTC,"I had no clue! Thanks for the info.  I think you have to consider how many more people they collaborated with in RAM as opposed to Discovery. Even as established they were by the time they started RAM and people were eager to work with them (including Giorgio's interview), it does take a lot of coordination to schedule the collaborations."
DaftPunk,33aztp,iiRockpuppy,2,Thu Apr 23 16:34:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, for sure, I've heard some of the backstory behind RAM at my job and it was a ton of work, but a lot of their songwriting and producing was much more streamlined for RAM compared to Discovery where they would spend months trying to get the exact sounds they wanted. Two different types of time consumption haha."
DaftPunk,33aztp,SirNarwhal,2,Thu Apr 23 16:37:51 2015 UTC,That is true. More time was spent perfecting the music for Discovery where as more time was spent collaborating with other people with RAM. Makes sense.
DaftPunk,33aztp,iiRockpuppy,2,Thu Apr 23 16:47:02 2015 UTC,"RAM is tied for me with Discovery, but yeah it seems like people who legitimately love RAM aren't as vocal in the sub."

DaftPunk,32rqsa,D_Cruse223,18,Thu Apr 16 04:29:47 2015 UTC,"Tough to say. My personal favorite is Discovery, but the great thing about Daft Punk is that each of their albums shows their progress as producers. Not necessarily that each one is better than the previous, but that each one is different and you can tell how they have evolved as a group through time. Each album is clearly identifiable from the others with a unique sound (for me at least) and they are all exceptional. But to answer your question, I do not think they have released their absolute best."
DaftPunk,32rqsa,highlander24,3,Thu Apr 16 05:24:35 2015 UTC,"Fantastic post.   Not necessarily that each one is better than the previous, but that each one is different and you can tell how they have evolved as a group through time.   Couldn't have said better myself. It's irrelevant if their next album is better/worse, but rather what will they do and how well will they execute it.  But for the sake of this post, If they continue to go down the route of using analogue equipment with emphasis on production and mastering, then I'd say they could make an album better than RAM. However this would depend on the quality of the songwriting/collaborators.  If they revert to more Discovery-era songwriting, which is still great, I'd say they've already released their best."
DaftPunk,32rqsa,Nikolaki8,2,Thu Apr 16 06:03:57 2015 UTC,"Each album is clearly identifiable from the others with a unique sound (for me at least) and they are all exceptional.   I agree with all of your points, but there's definitely some overlap between album sounds, IMO. For example, ""Contact"" would be right at home on Discovery, and ""Make Love"" would probably sound right on all four albums."
DaftPunk,32rqsa,TheBrainwasher14,2,Thu Apr 16 11:22:43 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with that, artists will definitely have some overlap in their sounds no matter how long they have been around. But I meant that as entire albums, the feel of each compared to the others (Homework vs. Discovery vs. Human After All vs. RAM) is quite different."
DaftPunk,32rqsa,highlander24,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:44:16 2015 UTC,The earlier version of Contact I can see being released on Homework but the version of a contact on RAM would not sound right on Discovery. Make Love would fit perfectly on RAM if the track progressed more and if the production wasn't so thin.
DaftPunk,32rqsa,Nikolaki8,7,Thu Apr 16 12:32:21 2015 UTC,"The album that I was most amazed about, and still am today, is Alive 2007. And here's why. I loved Homework, especially with its 90's house sound, a big classic. I loved Discovery with its super disco feel and the amazing use of sampling. I had mixed feelings of Human After All. I really feel that this album lacked what the others felt. It had a few songs but most were just ok. After going through all of there albums, i got to know all the songs and begin to love each one.   Then I listened to Alive 2007 and was absolutely stunned. DP's mixing of their songs is one of the coolest things musically I've ever heard, the way they use bits a pieces from different songs to make a super song. For example, with the Technologic mix toward the beginning, they used the vocals from Technologic and then introduced Robot Rock's guitar, then after that, they bring in the guitar from Voyager and finally finish it with the signature Technologic synth drop.   With each song, hearing something from other songs is just so awesome, its really hard to explain, and being able to even pull something like that off is amazing.  Anyway, thats why I think Alive 2007 is the best of their works"

DaftPunk,32j2qv,OutsideOwl,3,Tue Apr 14 04:51:40 2015 UTC,Nice! But why would they put Encom Part 2 before Encom Part 1?
DaftPunk,32j2qv,greenturnedblue,2,Tue Apr 14 04:49:46 2015 UTC,"If you dig Tron so much you should check out Tron: Uprising if you haven't already. It's not perfect and Daft Punk's music isn't used, but they make a legit effort to emulate the musical style and expand on the universe in a believable and interesting way. Since they're making a Tron 3 now the plot may get incorporated/played off of as well (since it was made by Disney). Also the Tron: R3C0NF1GUR3D album of DJs remixing DPs tracks (though if you don't like Daft Club it might not be your speed)"

DaftPunk,32imvc,VonDozier,2,Tue Apr 14 13:25:44 2015 UTC,"It was good! The set was short - like and hour and 20 minutes at best, but it was worth it nonetheless! They played stuff from practically every album and a lot of mash ups."

I love Digital Love and I feel like this song just gave it a subtle flair with the minor mixes and I love it for that. Opinions though
DaftPunk,32ks52,NazDaBaz,2,Wed Apr 15 01:30:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah opinions, but i just feel like daft punk closed their eyes and threw darts at a bunch of remixes to choose which ones go on the album..."

DaftPunk,32co5f,TR33_FaT,9,Mon Apr 13 05:26:05 2015 UTC,"She has what I call ""unrequited music taste love"" where she's actually a fan of a lot of acts I like, but none of said acts can stand her.  I remember hearing a story about Morrissey being very diplomatic upon finding out she was a fan of his through Russell Brand. It actually came out that she's got a pretty decent taste in music.  I see Katy Perry as an actress doing a musical more than anything else. I don't define Anna Kendrick by the character she plays in Pitch Perfect, either.   Just as I don't want to see Pitch Perfect, I don't want to see Katy Perry perform. But I might want to go to a show with them or send youtube links back and forth to cool songs."

DaftPunk,31zngd,saiferoth,15,Thu Apr 9 19:51:58 2015 UTC,I get that. I bet they just wanted to make it easier for people to find the song.

DaftPunk,31zngd,Nikolaki8,0,Wed Apr 15 16:49:24 2015 UTC,"Tbh I really hate this music video. It doesn't fit the song at all and, like a lot of music videos, takes away from the music."
DaftPunk,321uec,Koveryl,4,Thu Apr 9 22:13:08 2015 UTC,"This is probably the highest quality available (for RAM) - http://www.qobuz.com/gb-en/album/random-access-memories-edition-studio-masters-daft-punk/0886443927087  Original 'Studio Masters' in 24bit-88.2KHz  My friend bought this edition, I got a normal CD, they sound identical to me.  All other albums, I'm not aware of anything beyond standard CD quality, except discovery, where there are 5.1 versions available from Interstellar 5555."
DaftPunk,321uec,Cashback-,2,Fri Apr 10 15:59:54 2015 UTC,They sound the same because the extra frequencies encoded in a 24-bit/88.2kHz audio file are inaudible compared to standard CD audio encoded at 16-bit/44.1kHz.
DaftPunk,321uec,Otsel7,3,Fri Apr 10 22:35:04 2015 UTC,There's 24/96 vinyl rips of all the albums if you look in the right place

DaftPunk,321uec,Ruud-v-A,5,Thu Apr 9 22:23:28 2015 UTC,"Well you get very high quality with that, but Random Access Memories for example has 88 24 flacs available in the collectors edition usb. I'm wondering if for the other albums there's higher quality flacs available than what you'd get from a CD/vinyl rip, like Random Access Memories."
DaftPunk,31xffp,GPK_Ethan,7,Wed Apr 8 22:26:12 2015 UTC,"What quality would you guys like it at? I have the 24 bit 88.2 kHz version of RAM, and I can just do the phase cancellation myself, assuming it is what I think it is.  Edit:  Mp3 (320 kbps)  Flac  If anyone wants and of the other albums phase cancelled, just ask."

DaftPunk,31xffp,Spaciouz,2,Thu Apr 9 22:04:47 2015 UTC,"Basically you go into audacity, split the two channels (left and right) to mono, then you pick a side and invert it."
DaftPunk,31xffp,Nikolaki8,2,Fri Apr 10 01:59:22 2015 UTC,What is Phase Cancelled?
DaftPunk,31xffp,Spaciouz,2,Thu Apr 9 19:23:29 2015 UTC,I doubt I'm using the term right but its when you take out the mono channel while keeping everything thats on the left/right channel
DaftPunk,31xffp,Nikolaki8,2,Thu Apr 9 20:22:38 2015 UTC,It's like removing the central speaker while keeping the mono left and right speakers of the sound.  EDIT: Discussion from the original submission.

How about contributing a single for the end credits music? That way, they could dip back into the Tron sound without committing fully. They could even finish ""Computerized"" (without Jay Z, ideally)."

DaftPunk,31dpwr,NazDaBaz,9,Sat Apr 4 16:37:38 2015 UTC,thats cool. Do you know how long they had the album before it was released? I remember checking the internet every day for possible leaks and what not before it got released. Good Times.
DaftPunk,31dpwr,Mil_HouseMD,7,Sat Apr 4 04:13:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't remember. But it must've been at least a good few days if they needed a notice like this"
DaftPunk,31dpwr,AdrianwithaW,4,Sat Apr 4 07:08:19 2015 UTC,"Worked in a music store for 3 years, big albums would often come in before release, never more than a a couple of days early. A Friday before a Monday release was pretty standard.  Was working there around the release of Metallica's St Anger and people got wind we had it stocked out back. The die hard fans came in begging to buy it or at least have a listen but we were told it was a $10,000 fine to break embargo."
DaftPunk,31dpwr,MonkahBoy,4,Sat Apr 4 11:58:54 2015 UTC,Get a large group of fans and make them pay $200+ each to listen to the album early. Profit!

DaftPunk,31607w,SimplyBalling,17,Thu Apr 2 06:50:03 2015 UTC,"I would honestly love for them to go back to making quality house and electro bangers, drawing on their previous signature sounds and styles but still pushing forward with something fresh and excitingly new, but I don't really see that happening anytime soon; as /u/DelayedBalloon said they'll probably be sticking more along the lines of RAM's direction for the time being. According to this Rolling Stone article (which is definitely worth a read by the way, gives some interesting insight):   Bangalter says there aren't even plans in place to tour the new album: ""We want to focus everything on the act and excitement of listening to the album. We don't see a tour as an accessory to an album."" (When they do finally hit the road, he adds, it will be with a career-encompassing set list, not one overly focused on the new material.)   So take that as you will; don't know if they're going to be working on any new electronic music but fingers crossed; at least they might come out with some more material following on from RAM, and hopefully they'll tour once again before they put down their helmets for good!  At the end of the day, no one knows. This isn't Daft ""hey look at what we're going to do next"", this is Daft Punk."
DaftPunk,31607w,spanieldaniel,11,Thu Apr 2 11:04:22 2015 UTC,I kind of want them to go back to the french house sound...i really enjoy listening to Homework.
DaftPunk,31607w,NazDaBaz,1 point,Thu Apr 2 11:45:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I still listen to their pre-Discovery stuff a lot (Homework especially is more leaning towards Chicago house than French/disco house although they were pioneering the French house sound at the time and Homework has a lot of elements of it)."
DaftPunk,31607w,spanieldaniel,11,Sat Apr 4 18:06:03 2015 UTC,A fusion of RAM and Discovery is what I am hoping for.
DaftPunk,31607w,iamemran,15,Thu Apr 2 13:23:52 2015 UTC,"I think they'll continue to make music along the same lines as RAM, but I have a feeling they'll alter the tone and overall sound in some aspects. I'd still like to hear a 'Discovery 2' but I can't see them focusing on electronic music straight after RAM."
DaftPunk,31607w,DelayedBalloon,18,Thu Apr 2 10:11:08 2015 UTC,I'd honestly prefer more electronic and house music.
DaftPunk,31607w,Walksonthree,3,Thu Apr 2 12:40:15 2015 UTC,I think it's entirely possible - they did some raw electronic beat music for that kayne album

DaftPunk,311ipm,7screws,15,Wed Apr 1 12:43:00 2015 UTC,"what I see happening is the that Tidal's artists will pull their music from Spotify, then you will have to decide which service you want more 10 bucks for Spotify or 10 bucks for tidal. Spotify will win, because of the sheer number of users and agreements they already have, if they want they could roll out the hi-fi option too I'm sure, if it ever really caught on, which it won't. Tidal will have some big named artists and that's it. take Daft Punk for example, am I really going to sign up to Tidal because they are a part of it? fuck no, for one months subscription price, I can just buy their new album and listen to it that way. I like Spotify not because they have Kanye West or Daft Punk, but because I can find new music on there, something I don't see happening (at least happening any better on Tidal). I guess with Tidal, I just don't see the point. If its about artist making more money, I mean, really? If Daft Punk was hard up for money, they could go on tour and make a shit ton of cash, or sell their song to a Toyota commercial or any other number of things. maybe I'm missing the point of Tidal, if I am, ignore my long winded comment."

Show me how it's better than spotify, Rdio, Google Music, et al. Use numbers and prove that I'm actually putting more money in the pockets of the artists that I listen to when I stream on Tidal vs. Spotify & its ilk. I don't give a fuck about financing Jay's next Bentley, especially if I'm not streaming his tracks, but I'd love it if [insert your favorite band] got a few more pennies for being on my daily playlists.  My problem is that they haven't done that, and on top of that, all the ""artist-owned"" press material that I've run across seems to be carefully worded to not actually mention better per-stream compensation than the competition. If it were true that their artist compensation model is game-changing and pro-artist, it would be an obvious and huge selling point. That it isn't a focus tells me that it isn't true, and if that's the case then frankly, fuck them, because many people are going to read their press materials and assume that all these famous faces and ""artist-owned"" means that they're running a better, more artist-friendly business, when really they've done nothing to prove that it's even sort of true.  Literally all it would take for me to switch to Tidal would be proof of a markedly better compensation model for all (or hell, even most) artists, and an equivalently capable mobile app. That they haven't shown us that yet, even after that dumpster fire of a press conference and product launch, is concerning. I know I'm in a design subreddit at the moment, but aping Spotify's visual style isn't even close to my primary reason for not being able to get behind Tidal."

DaftPunk,311ipm,doomsday1216,1 point,Thu Apr 2 10:24:19 2015 UTC,How many indie artists do you think care about being rich versus having their music out there? Grimes has at least been know on the internet since 2012.
DaftPunk,311ipm,Sirius_Crack,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:23:29 2015 UTC,Im sure Grimes signed to Jay-Z's label in 2013 and gave up indie status because she didnt want to be rich. All indie artists would gladly take better compensation for their efforts. Spotify is a scam for the artists and poor artists will tell you that to the same degree as rich ones.
DaftPunk,311ipm,KimKarkrashian,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:41:20 2015 UTC,If they stream exclusively off any one service there will always be YouTube videos and illegal downloading services.

DaftPunk,311ipm,jxl180,3,Wed Apr 1 16:01:00 2015 UTC,No. A new CD is around $19.99 and I'm not bringing a CD case on the train.   The only CD I've bought in the last decade is the original soundtrack to There Will Be Blood. I'm using studio speakers and I still don't hear the difference between the CD and Spotify Premium. I do like the cover art for it though.
DaftPunk,311ipm,Ended_84,2,Wed Apr 1 21:37:52 2015 UTC,"I buy CDs of the artists I really like (daft punk included) and rip them to my computer as high-quality MP3. I want the case, art and the disc. In case something happens to my file, I have the CD to fall back to. I stream my own ripped collection over Google Play for free. I feel that spotify is too disconnected from the source for me. You lose internet, you lose your music. That makes me uncomfortable."
DaftPunk,311ipm,jxl180,2,Wed Apr 1 22:05:01 2015 UTC,Spotify has local download for offline listening. That's how I listen on the subway.
DaftPunk,311ipm,spanieldaniel,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"Sure, so does Google Play. What I am saying is that you don't actually ""own"" that file in Spotify. I don't mean in the legal sense. I mean that you cannot take that music file out of Spotify, put it on you computer, transfer it to another device or manipulate the file or archive it or anything. It's like renting something with a rope tied to it and the rental place can pull the rope at any time. It's just not for me, that's all. :)"
DaftPunk,311ipm,themactastic25,2,Wed Apr 1 23:19:16 2015 UTC,"But..you wouldn't need to take the time to move it to a different device. The point of the service is that it shows up on every device. Can't archive it? The entire service is one big archive and you can create unlimited playlists. It's clearly not for you, but you are clearly not their demographic. A big demographic is people who listen on bus rides to work, and then listen off their phones at work for the next 8 hours. Why would most people care about messing with the files. Not having to mess with the files is the main reason I have Spotify."
DaftPunk,311ipm,radio__bro,2,Wed Apr 1 23:22:14 2015 UTC,"I still buy CDs of my favourite albums (when I can afford them; regular 16 year old student here :P just bought The Day is My Enemy which is incredible!) because I want to actually own a tangible copy of the album case, cover art and inlays, disc(s) with the track files that I can rip, etc., and support and show love for the artist(s), out of respect and admiration for their work (I also rarely buy digital downloads because they're generally not much cheaper than physical copies).   However, I stream most of the music I listen to (primarily through Spotify Premium on mobile and PC, but sometimes through YouTube, SoundCloud etc. when the music isn't available on Spotify) as I just can't afford to buy everything straight away (I'll eventually have more purchasing power as an adult but even then I'll only be able to buy so much), and it's a convenient way to swiftly get access to music wherever. I'd like to switch to Tidal because I'm all for supporting artists, but it's like double Spotify Premium's monthly fee and my Saturday job doesn't exactly leave me rolling in dough. Additionally I could buy a lot more CDs if I stuck with Spotify (as it's like half the price), and I have other interests I'd rather finance. Just my two cents."

DaftPunk,315uir,Koveryl,3,Thu Apr 2 05:40:16 2015 UTC,"""So Much Love To Give"" was released on CD:   http://www.discogs.com/Together-So-Much-Love-To-Give/release/170930  it also rarely shows up on ebay and it's decently expensive when it does.  You can set up email search alerts for item key words like ""together, thomas bangalter"" etc. on ebay.    Together (the single) was never released on CD, only vinyl, and does not even show up on ebay hardly ever.  Everything is of course always on discogs if you're willing to pay discogs prices for used stuff: http://www.discogs.com/Together-Together/release/8094  There is a place to pirate FLAC vinyl rips, and it has them both, also the original DJ Falcon and Thomas ""Call On Me"" in FLAC but I don't endorse pirating, so you'll have to figure that one out on your own and it will be very hard to even get in the site.

I mean it's a god damn full length movie how can you even be annoyed that it costs money.   And if you don't want to, wait some time until the exclusives (this is again referring to music) are available elsewhere and listen it there... Tidal is a company. They need costumers to run it and exclusives get them there.

DaftPunk,30xmkz,612WolfAvenue,4,Tue Mar 31 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"Well they did say they weren't going to tour for the album.   And in terms of time, HAA came out 2005, Alive was 2007. RAM is 2013, Alive 2015 confirmed? plz"

DaftPunk,310ghl,Koveryl,17,Wed Apr 1 03:42:01 2015 UTC,"My personal favorites:  -JUSTICE. These guys are Daft Punk's counterparts, and for a good reason. They make some pretty awesome songs, and even better live shows.  -Röyksopp. By this point I'm as big of a Röyksopp fan as I am a Daft Punk fan. I suggest checking out their album Junior first, and then listening to Melody AM, The Understanding, and their newest release The Inevitable End.  They have a similar style to Daft Punk, but are a lot more chill, laidback, and at times, eerie. Many of my favorite tracks come from this duo.  Other artists you should definitely check out are Kavinsky, SebastiAn, Mr. Oizo, Lemaitre, Breakbot, possibly Crystal Castles (though their music is more angry sounding), and Madeon's new album, Adventure"

If you want some more stuff like Discovery, there's a number of great artists that contributed to their independent label projects where you can hear their style developing from Chicago-style house to French touch style. I'm thinking Alan Braxe, Roy Davis Jr, Paul Johnson and DJ Sneak. I'm personally fond of the work of Guy-Man's brother, Play Paul.   I also have a big soft spot for their sorta-kinda ex-rivals, AIR. They have a number of notable contemporaries such as Digitalism, Breakbot and Kavinsky that have that funky sound."

DaftPunk,30x5kl,NazDaBaz,62,Tue Mar 31 12:55:08 2015 UTC,"Bingo.    The entire premise for the platform is hype. The reason many of the artists involved are pushing it so hard is because they want the ability to extort their listeners. Once you buy an physical album, it's ""yours"" forever. But, when you use a subscription service, you're at the artists mercy (see Taylor Swift). Essentially, they're trying to change the market from a buyer's market, to a renter's market. It's just a power play by big name artists to ensure future profits.     They are essentially selling ""music insurance""."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,gwschultz,36,Tue Mar 31 13:28:08 2015 UTC,It makes me sad that Daft Punk is so heavily involved...

DaftPunk,30x5kl,Andman17,5,Tue Mar 31 15:30:29 2015 UTC,"I think it goes along with what Tom said regarding ""Wanting to do something they'd already done with their new album"". There was a service for music owned by an artist before this, it's name was daft club. Also, they wore their RAM helmets with their HAA gear so it's reasonable to think that this album will combine the joy of fame they got from RAM with the harsh things that go along with RAM. The outfits they wear on stage look RAM/HAA esque too. Perhaps i'm getting over hyped but I could see it happening."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,Shaaru,14,Tue Mar 31 19:25:16 2015 UTC,"/: I have hope. Daft Punk has always been genuine and I have always had a special place for them aside main stream artists. Seeing them amongst them, especially Thomas taking off his helmet, then main essence that separates the human Thomas to the art he created, kindof hit me in a sad soft spot. Almost like I was betrayed. We'll see though."

DaftPunk,30x5kl,Pakaran,-2,Tue Mar 31 17:59:44 2015 UTC,"Unless he had a mic inside and some effects to robot out his voice. Or like Hawking has, a lil keyboard and a computer to do all the talking."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,n1nj4_v5_p1r4t3,2,Tue Mar 31 18:38:42 2015 UTC,That would be ridiculously inconvenient for everyone involved.   Did you know it takes Hawking many minutes to write a sentence?
DaftPunk,30x5kl,Andman17,-1,Wed Apr 1 01:53:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, he does not have a full sized keyboard and I think picks out one letter at a time. Such a great mind. My bucket list includes reading his works."

DaftPunk,30x5kl,Kelsig,16,Tue Mar 31 20:42:47 2015 UTC,"I personally am not into the whole online streaming for music. I download all my music, and store it on my various hard drives. Storage is cheap, so why not? I don't need to pay anything, I don't need a good internet connection, or one at all, since everything is offline.  I understand if you're at work, or on the go, or in a situation that you can't keep your music on file, then by all means, streaming makes sense. And some people just like streaming it.  I personally, would only use Tidal for it's high res capabilities, since my entire collection of music is in FLAC.   [16/24 bit, 44.1/48/88.2/96/192/352.8 Khz].   And honestly, I already have all of Daft Punk's music in FLAC anyways, I see no point myself in using a service like Tidal. And how does it differ from Spotify or Pandora? I've read and heard many good things about Spotify; this seems like a more expensive option.  At the end of the day, I like to keep all my music offline, and free for me to access. I for one, do not see a reason for me to use Tidal."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,RecurzionPC,2,Tue Mar 31 15:41:48 2015 UTC,"Tidal is $10 for 320 kbps, and they say it pays artists more."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,Kelsig,2,Tue Mar 31 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"Is that good? Decent? I have no idea how Spotify compares, in terms of paying the artist, and quality.  I've always heard Spotify does not pay much to the artist, given how many song plays the artist may have. And I don't believe Spotify provides lossless either? I could be wrong though."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,RecurzionPC,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:37:31 2015 UTC,"Spotify is notorious for being shitty to artists, and is 320 kbps."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,Kelsig,2,Tue Mar 31 16:48:17 2015 UTC,"So the stories and what not I've read/heard have been true. I remember a poster on reddit, mentioned how a song of his had been played like 30,000 times or something, and he only recieved like $16. I could be way off, but I remember the ratio of songs played to actual compensation was insanely low.  And 320 makes sense, but I believe that is only for subscription users, correct?"
DaftPunk,30x5kl,RecurzionPC,2,Tue Mar 31 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"Correct, free users get 160 I think"
DaftPunk,30x5kl,jxl180,2,Tue Mar 31 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"That seems reasonable. I remember reading that free Pandora users get 64 kbps, although I think that means they don't listen to commercials.  I almost choked when I read that. 128 kbps is really the lowest you want."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,RecurzionPC,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe it pays the artists more. But if Tidal continues to grow with more artists, then the amount they earn will probably dwindle or will result them in having to raise the subscription price."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,jxl180,2,Tue Mar 31 17:08:56 2015 UTC,How do you do it legally without paying anything?
DaftPunk,30x5kl,RecurzionPC,3,Tue Mar 31 16:34:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I meant, as in I already have a hard drive, and in my case, multiple, and I already have the music files, so by free, was I don't need to pay a subscription fee or anything to access my music. It's all local and offline my case.  I sort of worded that strangely, my bad. I can see the confusion."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,jxl180,2,Tue Mar 31 17:28:47 2015 UTC,Do you just listen to the same music on repeat? What about music discovery?
DaftPunk,30x5kl,RecurzionPC,3,Tue Mar 31 17:34:18 2015 UTC,"I have a friend that we constantly send new artists to each other. I find music from Youtube, the radio, movies, games, TV shows, and other random places. I update my library quite often, as I download something new and add it to my WinAmp library. I think I'm at 10,000 songs; and it's probably 98% FLAC.  Funny enough, I was playing Euro Truck Simulator 2 a few days ago, and I was driving a modded truck. While driving, I found out I can activate a hidden song, through the dashboard. Some research into the files, and it turned out to be 'Marooned' by Pink Floyd (The Division Bell, 1994).  I downloaded the album (for some reason, I've yet to down the entire Pink Floyd discography), and now I'm listening to other songs from it.  Reddit is also a great place to discover new music. I understand that streaming is great in the way that it shows similar artists, but I seem to do fine on my own. SiriusXM is also a good place to find new music."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,jxl180,2,Tue Mar 31 18:56:08 2015 UTC,"Now, do you purchase the songs? If so that's great, if not, then it's not a fair comparison between a legal service that makes music easily and legally accessible, and just illegally downloading music.   (and I'm not calling you a bad person for it, just saying it isn't a fair comparison.)"
DaftPunk,30x5kl,RecurzionPC,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:58:52 2015 UTC,"I buy some it, other stuff I don't, or can't. I have a friend who gives me quite a bit of stuff he finds as well.  But how is comparing a streaming service versus downloading your own music not fair? I don't think I quite understand your question?"
DaftPunk,30x5kl,jxl180,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"Downloading vs streaming is fair but torrenting entire discographies vs a streaming service isn't fair, especially if money is the factor.  It's like saying, I could buy these shoes... But it's more cost effective to stuff them in my backpack and steal them."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,Blunkus,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:58:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. Yeah, I can see what you mean. To buy or download an entire discography, versus streaming an entire discography, obviously streaming would be cheaper.  I still like my offline, local music. I would only use Tidal for it's hifi selection, but again, I don't like streaming, mainly because you don't have the file yourself, you just pay to access it."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,RecurzionPC,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"Spotify has local download/offline play.  If I'm underground I still have access to my play lists that I have downloaded from spotify. Although you can't physically do anything with the files, what more do you want with them beyond listening?"
DaftPunk,30x5kl,RecurzionPC,2,Tue Mar 31 20:10:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, same here. I like having the ability to play my music whenever and wherever. I sometimes use Spotify for the social experience since you can see what others are into. For me as a DJ, its also a great way to keep up with modern music and keep a fresh list of tunes to spin."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,RecurzionPC,2,Tue Mar 31 15:46:03 2015 UTC,"My brother uses it and raves about it. Most songs I talk about, he can find them. I mean, I've got some obscure stuff that Spotify probably won't have, and Tidal definitely won't have, but for the most part, Spotify sounds pretty great, and I see no reason to use Tidal over Spotify.  But in the end, I'd much rather have everything offline. I really dislike this cloud, always online DRM, streaming world the tech market has been moving towards. Cloud storage is great, but I still like my subscription-less, no internet requires, local hard drive. I use WinAmp for everything, and it plays my FLAC flawlessly, and supports global hotkeys.  I don't know if Spotify supports global hotkeys, but I can't live without them."

DaftPunk,30x5kl,theReluctantHipster,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:13:58 2015 UTC,"Well first reference, I download in .FLAC or higher, and Spotify does not offer that.  Also, why are you replying to a comment that's almost two weeks old?"
DaftPunk,30x5kl,lrggg,13,Mon Apr 13 22:51:04 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you guys are looking at it the wrong way. It's either:   the artists cutting out the middle man, a la ReverbNation meets Spotify or the record companies trying to kill Spotify, which is a bad move.   Given that DP is involved, I'm hoping that it's the first one. Their talk about consumers coming to the artist is evidence that the artist might get a better cut of the profit than Spotify. Or, at least, these investors will."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,RennieMackintosh,7,Tue Mar 31 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"The only thing is, these artists really aren't cutting out a middle man. They still will have to pay their labels and whatnot. They just aren't sharing it through another service (spotify, iTunes, physical copies)."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,southave,2,Tue Mar 31 18:46:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the best would that they actually own the service themselves and that they make it a new independent label. That could be something actually worth supporting.  I'm a bit disappointed though that their group only includes well-known artists, and has no sign of being open to smaller ones."

DaftPunk,30x5kl,Artemis2,10,Tue Mar 31 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"I wrote this in a different thread, figured i'd share it since it applies:   Yesterday music history was made. A group of artists empowered with a combined wealth that exceeds the annual gross domestic product of the world's 9 poorest nations joined together and declared... a fucking declaration. They announced an announcement. They signed a contract. As is customary with most music contracts artists sign, nobody read the agreement or knows what it says. We, the music loving public, got to literally watch the ink dry on the agreement, in real-time. Pretty riveting stuff here. For added effect, the contract was signed during a press conference. With press. Lots of it. They said words. Adjectives. 15 minutes of them. Big, hyperbolic, paradigm shift promising exposition was spewed in the name of ""change"". Some of the words were literally, completely misused (I'm looking at you, Alicia). Artists who care deeply about music expressed their passion the way the recording industry has taught them-by starting a company that provides a service that already exists, charging listeners more money, and commoditizing music. Together they shouted the faux revolutionary words ""we can charge more""...""Are you with us?"". This intrepid group of fabulously successful artists argued that by launching a service that sells other artist's music, they created an ""artist owned platform"". But an artist owned platform would suggest that the artists all owned the platform, or at least their own music, wouldn't it? Not the case with Tidal, which is simply more of the same shit. As the press conference unfolded there was a moment of genuinely disingenuous enthusiasm when a guy in the back of the room paid by Tidal to ""woooo"" shouted unexcitedly as the only lady on stage nobody ever heard of bellowed ""all the same technology, all the same problems, twice the price"". Never in the history of the recording industry have a group of musicians joined together to figure out how to screw fellow artists exactly the way the record labels screwed them. Many speculated it would be impossible for even Jay Z( a proudly self described former crack dealer) to find a way to ruthlessly peddle a product with no regard for anything other than money. But then again, nobody would have ever thought a product of an unjust system could rise to the top, accumulate fabulous wealth, and brag about perpetuating the very same system that marginalizes all the people he grew up with. As always, Hova fuckin' delivers. In the soulless pursuit of profit record labels have prostituted artists, converted art to commerce, and deprived musicians of their fair share. The IP laws that govern music rights are not meant to favor artists or listeners. We do not respect these laws or these corporations. We shouldn't be working with misguided artists that do not own their music. We shouldn't promote a system of voluntary economic slavery. We should be creating an alternative ecosystem and inviting true artists to join us in liberating listeners, emancipating musicians, and freeing music for all. We should reject the bullshit idea that because Jay-Z can grow rich, we should celebrate his wealth and fetishize the culture that affords him this privilege. We should understand that the 1% is, by definition 1 OUT OF 100 PEOPLE. We should not give the 1% the ability to dictate the lives of the 99%. We should not expect that given the opportunity, the 1% will generously favor us with democratic, populist ideas. In fact, they never have, and never will. Jay-Z and company are just more of the same."
DaftPunk,30x5kl,Xiriz,4,Tue Mar 31 18:34:28 2015 UTC,"Seems to me that Jay-Z wants to develop a good competitor for Spotify, one where there's more control on the artists' end. Fair enough. It's an interesting business move and I can see why he would think it's a good idea. I'm also sure all the related artists will continue selling mp3 files, CDs and albums, so this isn't the death of physical output for these artists.   Personally, I won't be biting. I don't even use Spotify all that much and the features they're shining the spotlight on to seem like the better service don't really matter to me. I appreciate and understand Thomas' belief that artists are unfairly treated like chess pieces and their work are commodities in the bloodthirsty pop music battledome...but I'm a poor student and the price is always king."

DaftPunk,30x5kl,lovaas,2,Tue Mar 31 18:40:25 2015 UTC,From the first day I saw DP as intruders in this Tidal thing.   Because they are actually good musicians! (Jack White too)
DaftPunk,30x5kl,mrhoosteen,3,Tue Mar 31 22:12:22 2015 UTC,"Know what I've been dreaming of lately? An place where you can find new music for free, and give money - any amount - directly to the artist. Zero middlemen. Digital busking. An online tip jar for every artist.  Tidal ain't that. For starters, it's a service you pay a monthly fee for.  From an article I read: ""If Tidal had re-launched as an egalitarian, open service where anyone could upload music and profits were split among all artists based on the ratio of plays their tracks attracted, then this would truly be something radical"".  I'm thinking even more radical than that. Forget tracking the number of plays and redistributing your pool of subscription money to the popular artists. This is what's fucking wrong with music today, the industry is obsessed with rigging what's ""popular"" and it's created a race to the lowest common denominator. Egalitarian isn't ranking your artists, that'll lead to more of the same garbage. Why are people always trying to make music competitive?  All Tidal is doing is turning the most powerful artists into music execs, you think they'll be unbiased and egalitarian? You think they won't be giving themSELVES fucking top billing? Come on.  I'm talking about a place where everything the content creators choose to upload is free to stream... and when you find something you really like, you have the option to give your money DIRECTLY to the artist. Any amount you choose, even microtransactions. When you do, if you want to download the track, you can then have your own totally guilt-free, super hifi copy of it for your devices. There won't be a need for you to stream, which has either poor quality or takes up high bandwidth, and crucially: isn't PRIVATE. Part of the reason I don't like streaming services - even youtube - is that people and their code, from various organizations, god knows who - are tracking my every click and hover, building a profile on me, throwing annoying suggestions at me, and making a goddamn living off spying on my taste, trying to take apart what makes me tick. How do they get paid when the artist doesn't? Fuck that. People want to listen to their music in private, so let them download. They want to feel like they OWN something, so let them download. And they don't mind paying the artist, as long as they know it's going to them, so there should be a way to do that, too. Nobody even has to know how many times the track has been downloaded or how much money it has brought in, if the artist doesn't want that.  I bought In Rainbows and King of Limbs off Radiohead, I bought Sound City off Dave Grohl, I bought shows from Louis CK and Bill Burr. I LOVE that my money went straight to them. But so far, it has only been established artists who have been able to make that work.  Somebody needs to build a template that will let anyone do it.  Coming from someone who's still stubbornly making music and has always been ambivalent about the politics of self-promotion, I'd rather know there's been 100 streams of my song, so it has been voluntarily enjoyed - with one listener downloading it and giving me one real fucking cent in my paypal account or wherever - than beg the hyenas to please take advantage of me too."

DaftPunk,30x5kl,xmith,3,Tue Apr 21 10:37:02 2015 UTC,"Nothing but a money-making scheme to get money out of people who buy music even more.  Considering that today's popular music is pretty dire, I think this is a load of bullshit.  gwschultz is absolutely right with what he said.  It's nothing but getting more money out of people who buy CDs, vinyls or albums on iTunes.  I am slightly disappointed with Daft Punk by them participating in this.  But they're doing it for their buddies Kanye and Jay-Z most likely, but still, pretty disappointed.  I can't blame Daft Punk though, they're in this for the money too no matter how much they think creative control is important and they are one of the very few who manage to achieve it in today's music business."

Sony launched Spotify on PS3/PS4 yesterday too. Seeing how DP is signed to Columbia, which is owned by Sony Music Entertainment, it all ends up in the same pocket. I want to think that Columbia receives the money from Tidal before being payed out to DP. Tidal is just a new way for the artists to sign to an new company and be an investor. I wonder how other small artists will be signed to Tidal though. They will probably not be investors like the current artists and maybe get the same terms as Spotify."

I don't think anyone in that room actually gives a shit about Tidal other than Jay-Z.   As far as people saying how genuine Daft Punk are, I think that ended with the whole merchandising thing they did since RAM came out. I remember pre-RAM, I would always boast DP to my friends as being real artists that just put out albums and don't get involved with t-shirts/posters/novelty items... same reason they hide their identities, so all the focus is on the music. Although, ultimately I don't care what they do, as long as they keep making music, I don't think of them being as pure as they were pre-columbia."

DaftPunk,30z99i,zaviex,-1,Wed Apr 1 08:58:21 2015 UTC,This won't happen. Piracy rates dropped well before streaming was a thing. Piracy rates dropped because services that made it super easy and mainstream were killed in court. Piracy as a significant problem died with frostwire. Torrenting could've taken over but it was too complicated for normal everyday people to understand. So it's still where it was then and largely only done by repeat users.
DaftPunk,30z99i,zaviex,5,Wed Apr 1 12:49:43 2015 UTC,"Huh? you got a source on that?  piracy is at an all time high, and has been rising every year for over a decade.  http://www.go-gulf.com/wp-content/themes/go-gulf/blog/piracy.jpg  Streaming sites are fine and all, but once you have 5 different mainstream sites, with artists picking and choosing where the music will go, requiring the paying customer to shell out five times more money for what they were already getting for less, all while never actually keeping or owning anything... that's the kind of stuff that drives piracy."

Spotify was created with freemium in mind to help stop piracy. Now with this, artists are gonna start having exclusives with one or the other and it's just gonna make pirating be where it was again."
DaftPunk,30un4g,JadedDarkness,11,Tue Mar 31 02:27:47 2015 UTC,"Remember that this isn't the first time the music industry has toyed with exclusives. Look on iTunes and you'll see a whole bunch, although I wonder if the number of exclusives has dropped with the advent of Spotify and other streaming services.  I'm willing to wager that they won't stay exclusive for long. I don't think any artist would knowingly split their fanbase like that, especially in favor of a relatively unknown service (I only hear about it through /r/headphones). They'll probably be timed exclusives. It won't be the first time music has done timed exclusives, either; I see ""iTunes exclusive"" singles in the Zune (yes I know) marketplace all the time."
DaftPunk,30un4g,TheAverageOne,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:41:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's definitely not the first time exclusives have been in the music industry, but it's the first time for streaming services. Spotify and Pandora are free streaming services that allow for people to listen without paying anything. This accessibility helped reduce the amount of pirating significantly. Having an exclusive on a freemium service like Spotify actually wouldn't be too big of a deal because people could still listen for free. However, having content exclusive to Tidal is just like the iTunes exclusives you mentioned as they are premium. I think people would rather pay for an album/single from an artist they like directly on iTunes (or similar service, even physical versions) rather than pay for a month subscription to a service just to listen to this exclusive music."

DaftPunk,30un4g,SirNarwhal,2,Tue Mar 31 05:10:13 2015 UTC,"My point is, Spotify isn't a perfect system, but it helps in a way. A service like Tidal being premium only isn't going to help with what Spotify has already done. It's just turning back to having to pay to listen. I understand that Spotify doesn't pay out the big bucks to artists, but it's better than nothing.  I'm pretty sure most artists would rather make some money off their music being played for free than just having it pirated with no gain."

DaftPunk,30un4g,SirNarwhal,0,Tue Mar 31 05:57:01 2015 UTC,"You may be right, but you don't have anything to back that statement up so I can't really respond. Listening to music is changing. People used to be slow about getting music. Now, everything is instantly available and when it isn't, people go straight to whatever the fastest and cheapest option is. With the internet, people have been spoiled with the ability to listen before buying. Sure, some people may never buy but that's because they don't have a desire to own a physical copy or the actual files downloaded. Personally, if I listen to music I really love, I like to buy an actual form of it so that I can not only support the artist, but have a copy of my own. Services like Spotify aren't ruining the industry, they're shaping it. I'm not gonna support Spotify to the grave because I don't own the company, I just know that it's truly the new iTunes and consuming music will never be the same. EDIT: The reason I'm passionate about this topic is because I fucking hate exclusives. Exclusives are only good for business. They completely fuck over consumers. If Daft Punk were to do exclusive music for Tidal, it really would be annoying because the only way to pay to listen to it would be to buy a subscription to Tidal. I highly doubt anyone out there would pay 10-20 dollars to listen to a few exclusive songs of their favorite band i.e. Daft Punk, no matter how passionate of a fan they are. If artists want to be successful, they can do exclusive deals and make money that way, but if they want to be nice to their fans - they'll put their music on every platform they can. I want Daft Punk to be successful because I fucking love their music, but it will truly suck if they do exclusive releases to Tidal."
DaftPunk,30un4g,JadedDarkness,1 point,Tue Mar 31 06:14:26 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think that TIDAL only illustrates how every market can be segmented into niches. Music steaming services can actually be accomplished in many types of models, but companies are afraid to enter a market that is dominated by a few firms. With TIDAL, these freemium business models now aren't going to have as much power as others. Also pirating isn't decreasing, and why should it it cant be stopped and it is virtually free. Whats different is level of convenience, and I think that not having to designate insane amounts of space for music files combined with the easy access to broaden music tastes and not have strong convictions for new music has definetely increased my appreciation for these services. I am a Spotify premium member and proud to be one. While currently I dont really have the budget to pay for TIDAL, as I understand the importance of music file quality I will definetely be subscribing. And to conclude my final point is TIDAL is for a niche market, and tbh that market isn't going anywhere, audiophiles are everywhere. Not to mention cult like music fans."

DaftPunk,30un4g,LambsAnger,6,Tue Mar 31 00:29:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting, do you think TIDAL will get exclusive rights to any music?"
DaftPunk,30un4g,empw,22,Tue Mar 31 00:44:29 2015 UTC,"If they really wanted to make a giant splash, they would have a new album or EP that would be exclusive to TIDAL. Even if it was a new Daft Club or something."
DaftPunk,30un4g,McChiken116,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:15:58 2015 UTC,"Seriously. If each of the artists involved were to make similar music only to be released through tidal, it would have been better"
DaftPunk,30un4g,Walksonthree,3,Tue Mar 31 04:49:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, that would be terrible for consumers."
DaftPunk,30un4g,Hugo_ijslijk,1 point,Tue Mar 31 09:58:24 2015 UTC,Similar music as in a few songs each.Then there would be more hype around it.
DaftPunk,30un4g,Walksonthree,2,Tue Mar 31 11:24:36 2015 UTC,Of course they will. They will get right for something great like Nicky Minaj.
DaftPunk,30un4g,kaneua,39,Tue Mar 31 03:01:55 2015 UTC,This whole TIDAL thing has done nothing but make me think of Daft Punk and Jack White as sellouts.
DaftPunk,30un4g,ForTheWolf24,14,Tue Mar 31 01:35:25 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Daft Punk did this because they have seemed to be on relatively good terms with both Jay-Z (having some unreleased tracks with him) and Kanye (having been rumored to have helped with some tracks on Yeezus, plus Stronger) so they were supporting their fellow artists. Jay-Z supposedly is a major player in Tidal's upbringing."
DaftPunk,30un4g,SirFrederickWinston,8,Tue Mar 31 04:32:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's even more; almost every artist here is on the same label or a part of RocNation."
DaftPunk,30un4g,SirNarwhal,0,Tue Mar 31 04:58:21 2015 UTC,Many more reasons than that.
DaftPunk,30un4g,SimplyBalling,26,Fri Apr 3 05:22:43 2015 UTC,I agree. I was incredibly surprised to see them at this.

DaftPunk,30un4g,Doctor_cheetos,4,Tue Mar 31 03:26:47 2015 UTC,Maybe there is a reason for it. Not all business are evil.
DaftPunk,30un4g,Takeabyte,7,Tue Mar 31 04:01:18 2015 UTC,Maybe there is a reason for it.    $$$$$$  Jay Z paid each artists a million dollars plus equity. Hell deadmau5 is there and you know he's all about the money.
DaftPunk,30un4g,PimpinPedo,5,Tue Mar 31 05:14:32 2015 UTC,So... wouldn't you do it if Jay Z offered you that?
DaftPunk,30un4g,Takeabyte,16,Tue Mar 31 05:27:51 2015 UTC,"They were sellouts long ago. Just think of all the advertisements they've been part of in the past. GAP, Apple, Disney, Adidas, DJ Hero... I mean, come on. Name one successful artist who hasn't sold out"
DaftPunk,30un4g,Takeabyte,8,Tue Mar 31 04:13:22 2015 UTC,"Right, but if they release exclusives to Tidal like Jack White is already planning to, that's a lot different than doing a goofy commercial for GAP."
DaftPunk,30un4g,JadedDarkness,4,Tue Mar 31 04:39:56 2015 UTC,What's so bad about offering a product in your own store though? These artists are part owners of this site.
DaftPunk,30un4g,Takeabyte,0,Tue Mar 31 05:21:15 2015 UTC,"True, but imagine if Apple suddenly made some of their products only available in their own store. If they did this from the get-go, it wouldn't be a big problem, but suddenly making things exclusive that weren't before isn't fair to the fans."
DaftPunk,30un4g,JadedDarkness,4,Tue Mar 31 05:47:38 2015 UTC,"As someone who has worked for a number of Authorized Apple Resellers and worked at Apple for a few years, I can tell you this right now... that is a horrible analogy. Apple constantly offers products at their own store that no other store gets to sell. They are also doing a very good job at eliminating all but the largest of resellers, effectively limiting where people can buy Apple products from. unfortunately, the only people who notice or even care are the ones who want to offer the exclusive products.  If a consumer wants something enough, they will buy it from the store it's available at."
DaftPunk,30un4g,Takeabyte,0,Tue Mar 31 06:01:46 2015 UTC,"I know that Apple does have some exclusives, what I was saying is what if they made the next iPhone only available in their own store. That would have a significant impact. My real point here lies within digital music. To pirate something in the real world would be to directly steal from a store. That isn't as easy as pirating a song on the internet. People buy products in the real world because stealing is the harder option. With digital music, pirating is very easy and accessible, so it's still a viable option for some. If pirating were as hard as it was to steal an iPhone from an Apple Store, we'd have a very different situation."
DaftPunk,30un4g,JadedDarkness,2,Tue Mar 31 06:22:08 2015 UTC,"They've done exclusivity with Daft Club online service before. AND they've been big proponents of high fidelity music... it only makes sense for them to support something like Tidal. If signing with the likes of Jay Z brings it to the masses, then why not?"
DaftPunk,30un4g,TwopackShaker,1 point,Tue Mar 31 06:08:06 2015 UTC,Tidal is marketed towards audiophiles... GAP is for the masses... I don't understand how the former is worse.
DaftPunk,30un4g,TwopackShaker,1 point,Tue Mar 31 06:09:43 2015 UTC,"I'm confused... I never said one was better than the other. I was just saying that they're two very different things. Those other things were advertisement deals, Tidal is a music service that may or may not lead to exclusive music."
DaftPunk,30un4g,JadedDarkness,2,Tue Mar 31 06:17:42 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, I respect them ( DP and Jack White) so much. I can't help but feel that they really think this is a good and worthy idea. But I don't, or at least not entirely. There is nothing about this idea that is new or game changing."
DaftPunk,30un4g,DorkusHorribilus,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:31:19 2015 UTC,"I can see Daft Punk, but Jack is friends with JayZ plus he's really into audiophile stuff. And he never had his music on Spotify in the first place. I wouldn't say he's selling out. He believes in the project."
DaftPunk,30un4g,Clayh5,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:18:07 2015 UTC,"No, Daft Punk did this because they genuinely believe in the premise and its a very good premise. They are trying to change the industry for the better, whether you believe it or not. They want more control over their music, and why wouldn't they? Because right now in the industry, they have very little control. They are quite the opposite of sellouts."
DaftPunk,30un4g,SimplyBalling,13,Fri Apr 3 05:21:54 2015 UTC,This really makes me loose a ton of respect for DP. I'm sad to see that they're apart of this marketing scheme.
DaftPunk,30un4g,mrkrabz1991,8,Tue Mar 31 04:23:16 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of TIDAL until today, an already I have a pretty good idea of what it is and know a favorite group of mine is in conjunction with it. That's some damn good marketing, right there."
DaftPunk,30un4g,papersorplastics,-3,Tue Mar 31 01:44:19 2015 UTC,I've never heard of TIDAL until today   because it was launched today.
DaftPunk,30un4g,MyPenisBatman,5,Tue Mar 31 08:01:20 2015 UTC,"Generally, people are supposed to know about products before they launch. This sells the product."

DaftPunk,30un4g,Kakuz,2,Tue Mar 31 12:13:55 2015 UTC,Is this their first appearance in the mechanical flesh since the Grammys?
DaftPunk,30un4g,Andman17,2,Tue Mar 31 13:33:51 2015 UTC,Are people just ignoring the 10$ option? You get more content for your money and DP actually sees that money.
DaftPunk,30un4g,jessaa,2,Tue Mar 31 15:58:05 2015 UTC,Why all the hate for this product? It sounds like a good service. It's owned by the artists (Daft Punk included) and provides downloadable/streamable CD-quality music.
DaftPunk,30un4g,Takeabyte,2,Tue Mar 31 05:15:58 2015 UTC,"We have spotify, which couldn't be better. and has a lot of artists already"
DaftPunk,30un4g,krissipo,2,Tue Mar 31 11:19:09 2015 UTC,Why can't there be competition then?
DaftPunk,30un4g,nathanialf,3,Tue Mar 31 13:48:12 2015 UTC,Feel like this is just gonna make the consumer experience worse in this case. Exclusivity and pay walls. We'd just about killed piracy and now we're heading back that way making people pay potentially twice as much just to have what they had for one fee a few months ago.
DaftPunk,30un4g,retnuh730,2,Tue Mar 31 14:52:21 2015 UTC,I don't think that because some company adds a bigger pay wall and timed exclusives will change piracy and Spotify. As someone who just buys music and doesn't stream it all seems stupid to spend my money on. People who pirate will continue to pirate or move to Spotify or tidal. I don't think people will start pirating because there is competition in the streaming market.
DaftPunk,30un4g,nathanialf,2,Tue Mar 31 15:09:48 2015 UTC,"I pay my $5 a month happily for Spotify but if it comes to losing artists like daft punk or Kanye or other ones I like and being forced to use two services, I'm probably going to cancel and go back to the old fashioned ways of getting music or streaming Pandora"
DaftPunk,30un4g,retnuh730,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:20:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah because it there was just one place to shop that sunk to the lowest common denominator it would make things so much easier. I'm sick and tired of having to go to a grocery store to get fruit when I also need to buy new underwear today.... I'll just shop at Walmart, there's too many other choices when it comes to shopping now a days."
DaftPunk,30un4g,Takeabyte,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:45:54 2015 UTC,So glad that Walmart decided the best fruits will no longer be sold there and I now have to go to Sams club to buy them while paying the membership fee. So glad I now have more choices and have to go to two stores to buy the same fruit I could get from Walmart last week. I'm really benefiting as a consumer here.
DaftPunk,30un4g,retnuh730,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:56:42 2015 UTC,You don't have to buy the fruit if you don't want to or if it's too hard for you.
DaftPunk,30un4g,Takeabyte,0,Tue Mar 31 20:31:16 2015 UTC,But that's the point. Spotify pays artists jack shit and the audio quality is nowhere near what a CD gives.
DaftPunk,30un4g,Takeabyte,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:47:49 2015 UTC,$20.00 a month.
DaftPunk,30un4g,BaconNinja89,3,Tue Mar 31 15:08:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's not bad for what it offers.   Come on guys, you can't have it both ways. You can't hate Spotify and Pandora for paying the artists so little and then bitch and moan about pricing when a new service meant to support artists comes around.  Seeing as how a CD is anywhere between $10 and $20, if you are someone who buys a CD every other week or every month, this is a great deal.   I spend more on coffee a month and that shit literally becomes piss and shit down the toilet."

I know adding additional value to what they create seems to be their modus operandi and they're sensitive to audio quality and small details and such, so in a strange way, this makes sense for them.

DaftPunk,30wsui,spanieldaniel,3,Tue Mar 31 10:39:41 2015 UTC,"The deals on Discogs are decent; this factory sealed copy's going for €43.70 with €5 shipping to the UK ('Europe and Asia' under Seller's Shipping Information), which is currently £35.23 in total (planning to buy it!). Anything >£50 (including shipping if applicable) for even mint is a bit of a ripoff at the moment from the looks of it. £700 is bloody ridiculous haha."

Both free.  Also, to be honest here a vast majority of music listeners don't care about quality all that much.  At least from my experience.  This service is going to be incredible for audiophiles (like myself) that love have the highest bitrate possible, but I just find this hard to catch on to the mainstream public."

To be fair, if I buy a set of bookshelf speakers I'll probably go a lot harder on the vinyl - my surround system just does a lousy job on playback. Plus, once I move back home where my vinyl and deck are, that amount will likely increase too.  But, on a separate and also relevant note, as someone with 1 GB of data a month, HQ streaming audio is pretty much useless to me unless I have WiFi."

DaftPunk,30uphn,NazDaBaz,3,Tue Mar 31 02:16:03 2015 UTC,Yeah that's pretty surprising. I guess they realized their RAM look wasn't very functional/practical.
DaftPunk,30uphn,NazDaBaz,2,Tue Mar 31 02:17:40 2015 UTC,Will they ever release the full video? I hope so...
DaftPunk,30uphn,bhran,4,Tue Mar 31 01:37:21 2015 UTC,I'd like to know how scripted that whole thing was. I wouldn't be surprised if it was mostly pre-written.
DaftPunk,30uphn,NazDaBaz,5,Tue Mar 31 01:56:35 2015 UTC,Yeah i think so...and i now i might get downvoted but i honestly feel like this whole Tidal things is a really big deal/gimmick for something we already have for a lower cost.
DaftPunk,30uphn,epiclinkster,2,Tue Mar 31 02:03:25 2015 UTC,"people buy $400 headphones that cost $15 to make, people will buy a $240/year subscription if they think it gets them closer to the artist, to their fashion, to their world perspective.   Tidal is not going to flop, but its market share won't be great, and that's OK, they're not planning for it. I can just hope for a future where this service raises the bar to the point the cheaper ones start to realise that's what the users are looking for."
DaftPunk,30uphn,CunderscoreF,2,Tue Mar 31 04:58:31 2015 UTC,"Not just the price tho, but they are saying ""It'll make history"" yet all it is is another music streaming service"

In all honesty it won't affect me in anyway as I have all there records on CD and vinyl, but it still seems shitty for them to doing all this just for some streaming service that's selling point is 'high end' ...plz"

DaftPunk,30ti3q,Nikolaki8,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:05:35 2015 UTC,They are very big on vinyl and it'd be career suicide for an act as big as them not to release CDs or downloads on iTunes. I wouldn't worry about it.
DaftPunk,30ti3q,IrrelevantLeprechaun,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:20:37 2015 UTC,I think tidal is just for streaming exclusivity. Can't imagine that would include physical paid copies.

DaftPunk,30ti3q,BrandonTSpringer,-10,Tue Mar 31 03:56:30 2015 UTC,"Well, nobody can take away the music. I'm fine with them massively selling out as long as they keep making the world's best choons.  I look at it this way, RAM was an extremely expensive album. I want more RAMs. Therefore anything they do to horde money and funnel it into their next project, like Alive 2017 for example, is totally cool."
DaftPunk,30ti3q,SkipMonkey,6,Mon Mar 30 21:45:47 2015 UTC,Do we even know enough about this to say that they are doing anything even close to selling out?
DaftPunk,30ti3q,dizzi800,10,Mon Mar 30 16:38:11 2015 UTC,If Daft Punk sold out it was because of this   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGJy822geAg  NOT Tidal

DaftPunk,30v0c0,ImUnderYoBed,8,Tue Mar 31 02:09:57 2015 UTC,Max bitrate for the 9.99 is 320. I checked the FAQ to make sure. Only thing you lose is the lossless quality.

DaftPunk,30v0c0,gwschultz,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:50:42 2015 UTC,Problem is that they have no yet given any hard numbers about their artist cut nor they cost of operation of other fees.  I'm a bit afraid that they will run the marketing campaign of giving a bigger but to artist while working out a profitable difference through service fees.
DaftPunk,30v0c0,zaviex,13,Tue Mar 31 21:44:50 2015 UTC,Or you can buy their ENTIRE discography on Amazon for less than two months of Tidal.
DaftPunk,30v0c0,n1nj4_v5_p1r4t3,4,Tue Mar 31 02:49:49 2015 UTC,/r/headphones or /r/audiophile for the people looking to take advantage. OP Bose is generally not considered high quality since the headphones they make have massive deadzones in the mids
DaftPunk,30v0c0,Koveryl,-2,Tue Mar 31 09:18:32 2015 UTC,Even still! They're much better quality than what most people use. Not many are willing to buy 100 dollar headphones. I also have the 500 dollar computer bose speakers which I also used to contrast between TIDAL and spotify streams.

DaftPunk,30umtg,Zyxos2,10,Mon Mar 30 22:21:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I was really surprised since they've always stayed so anonymous before. Maybe they've decided to appear more in public since RAM.
DaftPunk,30umtg,IrrelevantLeprechaun,3,Mon Mar 30 21:34:27 2015 UTC,Yep you are correct. In fact the article stating that was on this very subreddit. Guy-Man admitted that being mysterious and silent for HAA was perhaps a mistake as it hurt publicity and may have contributed to HAA's poor sales.
DaftPunk,30umtg,burritobitch,3,Mon Mar 30 23:12:56 2015 UTC,Business is business! Respect for the publicity tho
DaftPunk,30umtg,MrTuxedoMan,3,Tue Mar 31 03:53:08 2015 UTC,I've loved Daft Punk for a long time and I was really surprised that they joined with Jay Z and other top music stars for a streaming service. I understand the higher quality aspect of music files (FLAC) but what I hope for is that they don't take their stuff out of Spotify and put it on Tidal.
DaftPunk,30umtg,IrrelevantLeprechaun,3,Mon Mar 30 23:31:11 2015 UTC,The whole point of Tidal is that their new material will stream exclusive on Tidal initially.

DaftPunk,30vl5e,NazDaBaz,2,Tue Mar 31 09:27:48 2015 UTC,"My theory is that daft punk doesn't want to do something that's already been done. Alive tour is exactly what you see when you go to any edm show nowadays (God I hate that term). I think they're just trying to come up with something new and different to revolutionize their performances.  Couldn't agree more with this post though, I think it about getting more power in the artists hands and not letting the execs set the rules.  RESPCT THA ARTISTRY!"
DaftPunk,30uwhc,stfsu,7,Mon Mar 30 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"The only reason I'm excited about this is because it implies that Daft Punk will release new material.

Also, YouTube significantly compresses audio; if you listen to ~320kbps Ogg Vorbis audio on Spotify or, even better, lossless audio on Tidal (which I've yet to try myself, but this is what I've heard), you'll hear the difference."

DaftPunk,30qk20,pattybak3s,13,Sun Mar 29 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"Yup. Some songs got ruined to me because of some association like yours. One of them is a Daft Punk song too, unfortunately. But in the bigger scheme, eh, it really doesn't matter. No one needs to like every single Daft Punk song just because they're a Daft Punk fan. It's alright to not like a song."
DaftPunk,30qk20,Alien_Enema,4,Sun Mar 29 21:32:17 2015 UTC,"Oh well, I don't like it as much as the rest of the album either for a number of reasons. the song is great but not for me.  Teachers, now there's a hard one to listen too. It's something about the voice in both of those songs."

DaftPunk,30qk20,BaconNinja89,2,Mon Mar 30 04:21:32 2015 UTC,I also prefer most of the other tracks on RAM to Instant Crush (though I do really like it); interesting how you guys aren't big on Teachers. Just wondering if you're able to describe what about it more specifically doesn't really do it for you (as I'm assuming you like the rest of Homework)?

DaftPunk,30qk20,astroman74,3,Mon Mar 30 02:15:19 2015 UTC,"Part of it could also be that it doesn't really seem like a daft punk song to me. I like the strokes but this song seems more like a strokes song rather than something daft punk would make. It's almost too normal. It has 2 full verses, a chorus, and a bridge, which is the regular song format, but the daft punk I think of rarely follows this format."
DaftPunk,30qk20,ogcm,3,Mon Mar 30 03:02:34 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't like RAM at all, but I love every other Daft Punk production more than I like most music I listen to. They just had a different sound this time around and I just wasn't able to vibe with it. Nothing wrong with the fact that you don't like something just because you expected to like it. Or that just because you like a band or an artist doesn't mean you have to love everything by them, you know?"

I was depressed in highschool, but then I watched Interstella 5555, and then I watched it again, and again, and again.  It changed everything and made me feel like the world was a really special place.  Now when I see it I get tears in my eyes.  It is so amazing.  Sit and watch it by yourself, it doesn't need to be shared with others, it is all about your emotions and reaction.  You might not like it the first time, but the second time, sitting at night in front of your computer, experiencing the film again, you will feel everything when the camera pulls away to the record player."

DaftPunk,301py7,EwanMe,24,Mon Mar 23 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"I think the most they did in terms of a ""video"" would be the third SNL Ad."
DaftPunk,301py7,Gana0,13,Mon Mar 23 19:54:28 2015 UTC,God that brings me back.
DaftPunk,301py7,cheesecakezombielama,14,Mon Mar 23 20:19:14 2015 UTC,Wow I can't believe it's been 14 years since 2013 when that came out.
DaftPunk,301py7,Stalast,2,Mon Mar 23 22:58:21 2015 UTC,In 13 years you will see this comment and feel sad (and old).  =(
DaftPunk,301py7,rprandi,-1,Tue Mar 24 03:15:17 2015 UTC,"But what do you think VH1 used? Because that was a full video, I'm pretty sure. Not that there was a lot more different footage as I remember."
DaftPunk,301py7,CindySoLoud,3,Mon Mar 23 21:21:07 2015 UTC,Maybe the video MTV made with scenes from Interstella 5555 and the SNL ad?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoB9OiTJw40
DaftPunk,301py7,CindySoLoud,3,Mon Mar 23 21:58:41 2015 UTC,I remember when it first aired on vh1 and this sub was in an uproar because it was in fact a fan made video. What you're looking for is not official!
DaftPunk,301py7,Sp0de,9,Mon Mar 23 22:44:27 2015 UTC,"There isn't one, just the SNL ad"
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,D_Cruse223,40,Sun Mar 22 18:19:26 2015 UTC,I think we will have another at least 8 year wait before we hear anything from the robots.
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,coldpause,12,Sun Mar 22 19:33:04 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I've had to experience the pain of waiting for a new album from them because the song that got me to really like them was Doin it Right, so all of their albums were already out. After hearing all of RAM I'm sure the older fans thought it was worth the wait though. I hope I think the same thing when their 5th album comes out"
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,DyJoGu,5,Sun Mar 22 20:05:36 2015 UTC,"It's the best feeling in the world though. I started listening right after Alive 2007, and had been waiting basically throughout middle school and the summer of my sophomore year, but it was worth it. Nothing will beat coming home that day, turning off all the lights, and just listening to every song without any interruption."
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,free_airfreshener,3,Mon Mar 23 12:21:08 2015 UTC,"This applies to when any record arrives at my doorstep. It gets listened to with all my energy focused on it.   I'm a massive Daft Punk fan, just like you, but what you said applies to everything worth listening to."
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,DyJoGu,2,Mon Mar 23 13:00:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, of course! I'm not saying it doesn't, I'm simply saying I never buy albums, so it's sort of a rare thing for me to ever really experience, plus just the feeling alone of having the newest Daft Punk album is part of that greatness."
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,AlmostVentured_,-22,Mon Mar 23 23:28:51 2015 UTC,No it was not worth the wait to hear the radio friendly pop that was RAM
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,ThunderWaffles,18,Mon Mar 23 04:45:24 2015 UTC,"Touch, Giorgio by Moroder, Contact, Beyond, Motherboard, Game of Love, Give Life Back to Music...all of these are anything but radio friendly. The only songs on RAM that could be considered ""radio friendly"" are Instant Crush, Lose Yourself to Dance, and, obviously, Get Lucky. Idk what you're on about."
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,RedditDestroysDreams,15,Mon Mar 23 05:01:48 2015 UTC,He's just too cool to listen to some radio trash
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,datnewguywithashoe,8,Mon Mar 23 06:43:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly most of their critically acclaimed best work has been ""radio friendly pop"" and it is to no surprise because music that is ""radio friendly"" is catchy and allows for multiple plays in a short period of time. Around the world, One more time, Harder Better Faster Stronger, and the modern day behemoth Get Lucky are all good examples."
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,iscariot_13,4,Mon Mar 23 06:51:44 2015 UTC,"The Tron Threequel starts filming either this fall or next(can't remember, was announced very recently).

Also Cassius will release their new album as well. Thus going about a world tour starting with Kavinsky -> Cassius -> Sebastian -> Justice -> Daft Punk. The show will set records for selling out in the matter of seconds. Playing in huge arenas, in just about every city in the world."
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,coldpause,16,Sun Mar 22 19:53:38 2015 UTC,I thought the new justice record was in 2016.
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,avengeance,11,Sun Mar 22 20:06:57 2015 UTC,yeah being how they are though it'll probably be delayed
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,Grubster11,3,Sun Mar 22 20:09:02 2015 UTC,They came out with a new live album last year though....
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,thwt,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:20:11 2015 UTC,The album came out last year but the live show was finished ages beforehand
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,Grubster11,2,Mon Mar 23 12:41:08 2015 UTC,Less than a year between the concert and the album. Sounds totally OK with me.

DaftPunk,2zxb8u,Nic_240sx,8,Mon Mar 23 14:46:31 2015 UTC,SebastiAn 60 song album?
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,popkorn9898,4,Sun Mar 22 23:17:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm wondering about this too. Is this true?
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,Kelsig,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:36:25 2015 UTC,He's getting it mixed up with Total which originally had that many songs

DaftPunk,2zxb8u,mrrobopuppy,9,Thu Mar 26 10:13:16 2015 UTC,If you count tron: legacy they have roughly 4 year wait between releases so we probably won't be getting anything until 2017
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,ANormalSpudBoy,6,Sun Mar 22 19:51:02 2015 UTC,"I would like to see at least two more studio albums and one more live tour out of them before they decide to call it quits. I don't care how long it takes, or how many side projects they do in between.  I need to see them live before they or I are gone."
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,booch12,4,Mon Mar 23 00:12:34 2015 UTC,I would really like to hear them on the next Tron movie that is supposedly happening.
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,SUPEREPICFAIL45,4,Sun Mar 22 23:10:35 2015 UTC,They're making their next album when they're 80 years old. They're planning to make it a classical music album.
DaftPunk,2zxb8u,chivomaximus,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:55:14 2015 UTC,If we ever get a new live show I will expect it to be the last one. In terms of studio albums it could be either 1- or maybe even 3. It all depends on how long they want to keep going and if they still feel the energy to make new stuff.
DaftPunk,300mbr,lerkbothways,4,Mon Mar 23 14:57:28 2015 UTC,"I straight up did not like this cover.  I do not like her voice or the backup vocals. The guitar makes it feel so slow, not as funky as the original. Just my preference."
DaftPunk,300mbr,iiRockpuppy,3,Mon Mar 23 15:13:27 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed everything after the really bad intro. Just my two cents.
DaftPunk,300mbr,throwaway_the_fourth,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:47:42 2015 UTC,"Yea the intro is weak, the hook in her cover has grown on me."
DaftPunk,300mbr,methshin,2,Mon Mar 23 16:02:37 2015 UTC,"Nothing about this cover brings me any sort of pleasure.  I wanted to like it, one of my favourite tracks on the album, but she sucked all the emotion out of it and left us with the equivalent of a bland, flavourless, Manhattan."

DaftPunk,2ztrhf,phnk_,16,Sat Mar 21 18:49:46 2015 UTC,I wonder if they -DP and their crew- knew that this show would influence the aesthetic of modern electronic shows and festivals.
DaftPunk,2ztrhf,Mr_Viper,7,Sun Mar 22 01:13:22 2015 UTC,"Looks like Coachella, too.... So this was the first show!"
DaftPunk,2ztrhf,C3L3STIALB3ING,2,Sat Mar 21 19:10:20 2015 UTC,That pyramid should be a worldwide landmark.   I wonder what become of it. Anybody know?
DaftPunk,2ztrhf,swaggs262,9,Sat Mar 21 20:29:37 2015 UTC,"A long time ago, some guy showed up here, with proof that he had access to a Daft Arts storehouse. I guess the pyramid is somewhere there."
DaftPunk,2ztrhf,DeusExMachina810,8,Sat Mar 21 22:54:22 2015 UTC,Probably just taken apart. The LED panels were used in another production most likely and then the pyramid part was either scrapped or used in another way.
DaftPunk,2zuhc1,Leetanidus,7,Sat Mar 21 22:05:24 2015 UTC,What is screen printing. If you don't mind me asking

DaftPunk,2zuhc1,mewe123,3,Sun Mar 22 11:53:13 2015 UTC,That explained every thing perfectly. thank you I kind want to try that now. :D
DaftPunk,2zuhc1,DonnieOttway,2,Sun Mar 22 16:28:09 2015 UTC,You should! It's a lot of fun and can even get very precise images and thin lines when you use a dark room and expose screens with photo emulsion you can basically transfer anything you print and turn it into a stencil burned onto the screen. There is usually a class in the art department at your local community college and if not you can look for classes at art stores or small local art studios.
DaftPunk,2zuhc1,Zephusa,3,Sun Mar 22 21:15:34 2015 UTC,Damn haha I'd buy one of those you should send me one
DaftPunk,2zuhc1,Connor_Cleve,2,Sun Mar 22 15:52:47 2015 UTC,I need them in my portfolio as a full series until class ends in May but I'll message you around then if pure still interested.
DaftPunk,2zuhc1,Reclaimer_117,3,Sun Mar 22 21:16:40 2015 UTC,that's really good!  Is this a college class?  I remember in high school we had a little 2 week thing on Screen printing but if it's offered in higher education I would take it in a heartbeat
DaftPunk,2zuhc1,Kinkymoose5,4,Sun Mar 22 20:03:12 2015 UTC,"I'm going to community college in Southern California and we have screen printing 1 and screen printing 2 and also a print making class which is different, but has other cool ways to transfer images onto paper without painting or drawing"

DaftPunk,2zvjil,RigganAntioch,3,Sun Mar 22 04:23:14 2015 UTC,I am extremely impressed with this. When it started I wasn't so sure but as it got going I loved it. Daft Punk helped write and produce Black Skinhead so it makes it all the more special.
DaftPunk,2zvjil,Finial,4,Sun Mar 22 04:41:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not so impressed. I feel like this could have been so much better. It mostly sounds like both songs playing at the same time to me, rather than a legitimate mash-up..."
DaftPunk,2zvjil,cannellbd,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:28:54 2015 UTC,"My understanding of mashup creation is that the best ones are made when the artist can actually get their hands on the stems for the tracks, does anyone know if the stems for DP's song are available anywhere? It sounds like Black Skinhead is being played with just the vocoder from PTOYL, which isn't necessarily just the two being played over each other."
DaftPunk,2zvjil,janimationd,2,Sun Mar 22 22:37:56 2015 UTC,If this was actually edited it would be AMAZING...

DaftPunk,2zdphb,timeddilation,2,Wed Mar 18 00:59:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think they ever fully disclosed their setup, but they've let known a few pieces of hardware.   Alesis 3630 compressor, mentioned in an interview: http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/daft-punk/372628  I imagine they use(d) a Roland MC909, considering they have song named after it: http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar03/articles/rolandmc909.asp  They've mentioned they use keyboards and synthesizers in other interviews. They also likely used any MPC (other than the 909) that was available at the time. If you don't know, MPCs can be used to take the small samples you saw in the video, and some MPCs have built in filters, compressors, etc, but they likely had other bits of hardware to give these effects where the MPC was not able to. I know for certain the 909 gives you the ability to stretch samples too.  I am 99% certain they were taking samples from vinyl, which they have also mentioned in other interviews (about their parent's records). You can feed the line out from a turntable, through a preamp, and directly to the MPC and record the whole song, save to flash in .wav format on the MPC, and make your samples on the interface.  To get those high quality sounds you hear on the album, it would all have to be hardware. Or on a bumpin' computer and all your songs are .wav, but as far as I know, ableton introduces certain artifacts with the virtual filters and compressors that are distinctly different from their hardware counterparts. The fun thing with hardware, is every piece is different, and sounds subtly different, which adds to the originality of the sound.  To get an idea of what their set-up might have looked like, this guy has some similar hardware: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_GsiAf2qj8&t=61"

You can't deny that the reason her music is showing up is because the only thing that links Awolnation and DP is that they have both had singles on the radio in the past couple years. Pandora is extrapolating to show you other singles that have been on the radio in the past couple years. If you really want to stop Pandora from bridging the gap you should separate your genres into different stations."

DaftPunk,2yyobs,Nikolaki8,11,Sat Mar 14 03:00:41 2015 UTC,"I never really liked ""Human After All"" I consider this to be their weakest album, but when I heard Alive 2007 and how they mashed up their songs, I started to think that Human After All was an ""incomplete"" album or like an Ikea sort of Album, that it needs to added to others.  I think Daft Punk and their label released it as a throwaway album, I mean the title ""Human after all"" kind of goes with flaws and making errors, they put in the booklet that the album it was recorded and produced in 5 weeks, there was no commercial or  marketing.   Ultimately, I think it may have be disguised as an ""eff you"" to some institution, but was included in their Alive 2007 tour and album to show they still got it."

I don't remember the exact dates, but both the press release and ""Robot Rock"" surfaced somewhere late November/early December. The entire album leaked by January. Someone went as far as to create a full remix album before the HAA CD was officially released, which is more unusual in 2005 than it is in 2015."

He's somewhere between a misunderstood genius and an ambitious entrepreneur with peter pan syndrome. Either way, his understanding of music reaches outside of just the notes on the page. When he makes music, he is always thinking about where the songs take you, a lot like Daft Punk does.   Watch this clip from ""The Black Album"" Documentary, about Kanye working on Jay-Z's ""last"" album. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdyyNJcNavw  Even more than a decade ago, Jay-Z could see his genius. He can be heard here saying ""Are you taping this? Get this on camera."" and Kanye is trying to play a beat that'll put Jay in that zone. He was always a producer first and he doesn't get much credit for that due to his recent musical pursuits being less than vanilla."

DaftPunk,2ymhry,discoponeh,8,Thu Mar 12 00:44:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for sharing this.  The art of sampling has so many angles.  I am continually challenged to question the way I understand ownership because of it.    I remember I used to always get ridiculously pissed about the fact that Eric Prydz took the ""Call On Me"" sample that Thomas and DJ Falcon used for their track and literally make the same song, but he got hype and shit cuz there was a sexy music video and everyone forgot about DJ Falcon's song.  Or Fedde Le Grand doing the exact same copy-thing of THomas and Falcon's ""So Much Love To Give.""  I still like the Thomas and DJ Falcons infinitely better in both cases, but who am I to say what you aren't allowed to do.  Hell, DJ Falcon probably didn't ask for any rights for the Call on Me sample, meanwhile, Prydz went so far even to ask Steve Winwood to rerecord his own vocals of the original hook.  But if the product is dope, then that's the end goal, and I can't judge someone else's tastes.  If we wanna try and be the police about ownership and what's 100% ""pure,"" then most of Daft Punk's material is in the garbage, and I can't live with that kind of mindset.    That I think is one of the huge huge commonalities between the robots and Kanye.  They are both so focused on making quality material... that rules, ownership, attitudes, it seems nothing can stand in their way of making good final products.  And they know they can win anyone's hearts over by the end of it all because the product is so dope.    for reference:  Bangalter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzzJB1oh7qE  Prydz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_fCqg92qks"

I used to have a similar mentality with things like this, judging some commercial house or popular tunes, always looking for underground tracks, when in the end it was ridiculous, because as you said:   if the product is dope, then that's the end goal, and I can't judge someone else's tastes   Also, IIRC about Thomas Bangalter & DJ Falcon's ""Call On Me"" it had something to do with Daft Punk starting to get big and Thomas not wanting to risk Daft Punk's future over an unauthorised (if thats what you call it) sample. Basically the stakes were to high so he dropped it and let Eric Prydz have it. Also, though it is the same track essentially, I think Eric Prydz did an excellent job with his version. Sure its the same sample and beat, but I still find that his sounds much cleaner if that makes sense. I love it! Basically, I wouldn't say the success comes entirely from having a hot music video, but also because the song is just amazing !  I'm listening to Call on me whilst typing this and I'm getting so nostalgic!!!"

DaftPunk,2y9g4b,ma-avro-dyne,3,Sat Mar 14 11:19:46 2015 UTC,"Going off from what I remember from various interviews, Guy-Man is the singer for HBFS, and Something About Us is a duet. Thomas sings most of Digital Love... but Guy-Man has one line in it. Judging from that voice, Guy-Man most likely sung Make Love. Other than that, it's a toss up. They both sound pretty similar and they can manipulate the robot voices to sound how they like."
DaftPunk,2y9g4b,KiD_ENZO,5,Sun Mar 8 04:22:23 2015 UTC,"Beyond is a good example. The beginning lyrics have a lighter tone and and are a little bit higher vocals. Those are Thomas' vocals, but the deeper, slower vocals are Guy-Man's, you can tell because of his deeper voice and thicker French accent. Most of the time when you here a very deep thick accent in Daft Punk songs, it will more than likely be Guy-Man."
DaftPunk,2y9g4b,fretlessrick,1 point,Sat Mar 7 19:40:30 2015 UTC,I think this is the only concise answer imo
DaftPunk,2y9g4b,coldpause,2,Mon Mar 16 23:27:45 2015 UTC,I think Guy Man might have a slightly deeper voice.

DaftPunk,2y39qc,timinator456,10,Fri Mar 6 03:08:16 2015 UTC,"In my personal opinion:   Homework - French house mixed with a bit of acid house? Discovery - French house mixed with disco elements Human After All - Rock mixed with dance music. The only real French house themes in this LP is the repetitveness. Random Access Memories - Disco mixed with funk, dance, soft rock and electronic music   I don't think nu-disco is the right genre to label RAM under as for most of the time, the LP stays very true to its roots.

DaftPunk,2xxpln,NatNoBrains,1 point,Wed Mar 4 22:17:08 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this by saying that I've been a memer since they first appeared on 4chan circa 2006 (ages ago in internet time). I remember refreshing /b/ all afternoon with the hope that someone would make a new meme. I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny. Do you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them. In fact, you have only submitted two posts to adviceanimals garnering a total of just 4 points and have not commented there any time recently. So please, respect my judgement regarding the shittiness of your post using memes I have held dear to my heart for nearly 7 years but you have no strong feelings for. Thanks."

DaftPunk,2xychk,funkysnave,9,Wed Mar 4 23:43:36 2015 UTC,I think they purposely don't offer somewhere to send fan mail.  Not because they don't want to hear stories from people like you or care about fans but rather they don't want to be idolized and have a million demos sent their way...  they want privacy.  Perhaps trying to contact their 'manager' Paul Hahn may work... though I would guess he would filter a lot of messages and not want to deal with the legions of fans that thought of contacting him for purposes similar to this.

DaftPunk,2xm904,autowikibot,11,Mon Mar 2 18:57:30 2015 UTC,"That picture illustrates DNR (Dynamic Range) compression, which has nothing to do with digital/analog, except for the fact that digital usually has a hard limit on the wave's height due to how it's encoded, but vinyl is no more infinite. The mastering is what counts here far more than the medium, on the left is a good master, on the right, a bad one with DNS compression, seemingly falling victim to the Loudness War. Again, nothing to do with the medium.  The problem with digital is actual compression (not DNR compression), which is why 320kbps MP3s sound somewhat worse than e.g. 16-bit@44kHz FLACs, which are equivalent to CDs, but digital media is fully capable of higher bitrates, the higher of which will probably always sound better than vinyl with the right playback devices (admittedly, built-in DACs on many motherboards are not exactly capable of outputting 24bit sound I hear), due to e.g. less underlying noise, lack of effects of static, skipping and so on."

Increasing loudness was first reported [by whom?] as early as the 1940s with respect to mastering practices for 7"" singles. The maximum peak level of analog recordings such as these is limited by varying specifications of electronic equipment along the chain from source to listener, including vinyl record and cassette players.

Well you might hear vinyl because of static, noise, fluctuation, etc. But if you do work in audio engineering you would with lots of time spent listening to the difference.

Volume is not as loud on the Vinyl, but you maintain all the frequencies so you get a much more accurate representation of the audio itself."

DaftPunk,2xm904,Team_Braniel,1 point,Mon Mar 2 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"Your question actually confirms my point. Since FLAC is by definition lossless, it should be indistinguishable from it's source. FLAC's audio quality is entirely dependent on it's source, since it's uncompressed , lossless audio. My point being, Digital vs Analog is a moot argument these days, considering with Digital its all a matter of how much storage you want to allocate to the sound file.   This is all regardless of whether or not you can actually hear a difference, mind you. IIRC there have been studies that have shown that, unlike the current state of video recording, digital audio has reached a point of being indistinguishable from the source at a reasonable threshold. I, personally, prefer FLAC when listening on my headphones, but I couldn't tell you whether or not I actually hear the difference between it and WAV versions of the same file. And when I'm in my car, a CD with MP3s on it is fine, because my car stereo isn't exactly studio quality sound. AFAIK the only thing we can do to make sound more ""real"" digitally is to add more channels and increase the directions that the sound comes from. In other words 7.1 surround is better than 5.1, which is better than stereo, which is better than mono."

Totally subjective.   vinyl is the only media which allows us to listen to uncompressed music.   Totally incorrect.  For starters you can compress the dynamic range before mastering onto vinyl just like you can for any medium, there isn't a real reason to but you can.  Also vinyl has a built in limit to its range, but so does any non-digital medium.  See this for uncompressed and lossless digital compression.   But the really sad thing is, when the CD mastering gets on the vinyl with reduced loudness...   Which gets us back to the point... its the mastering which sucks here, not the format.  Dynamic Range Compression has nothing to do with the medium and everything to do with how the album is produced and mastered.  It can be put into Vinyl, CD, DVD, Bluray, MP3, a Video Game, Cassette, or any place a song is saved.  For more reading check out this wiki  What it really comes down to is who the person doing the mastering is marketing for.  People with Vinyl are clearly audiophiles and wont stand for that shit.  People who buy CDs are stuck in the 90's and clearly don't know WTF they are doing.  MP3s are such a mixed bag right now its hard to call, some people live off of ripping MP3s from extra shitty Youtube videos (double plus extra horrible) but some MP3s are mastered very well and have minimal or lossless digital compression.  But the fight really has little to do with CD vs. Vinyl and more to do with shitty work in the music industry."

DaftPunk,2xm904,n1nj4_v5_p1r4t3,-7,Mon Mar 2 21:34:43 2015 UTC,"CD's are only 16bit sampled at a measly 44kHz, and studios can record 24bit at 192kHz. CDs suck balls, but there are other much better lossless versions of digital music (not necessary by DP)."
DaftPunk,2xm904,janimationd,7,Mon Mar 2 00:56:03 2015 UTC,"You must not understand what the ""bit"" number means. The bit number refers to the precision with which amplitude information is stored. 16 bit means there are 65,536 different possible amplitude levels that can be stored in the file. Do you really think you're able to tell the difference between a volume of 65536 and 65535? No, the human ear can't possibly tell. Bits per sample is fine at 16 bit, which in itself is already pushing it. Also if you can actually tell the difference between CD grade 44kHz and 192 kHz then you must be some sort of deity in terms of hearing ability."

DaftPunk,2xn3sb,Starpryme23,4,Mon Mar 2 08:08:15 2015 UTC,"1) Discovery 2) Tron: Legacy 3) Random Access Memories 4) Human After All  These are the four albums I listened most to and so they appear in my ranking.  On Discovery I love every song, which has my most favorite 'Aerodynamics'.  The Tron album is so rich sounding and has the perfect balance between orchestrial and electric elements.  Random Access Memories is great, but was sadly overhyped. It was the album which didn't surprise me very much. Touch and Giorgio by Moroder are my really good, but then there are songs like Get Lucky and Lose yourself to dance with which I was fed up really quickly.  Human After All is an overall good album and has some rebellious tunes in it."

DaftPunk,2xn3sb,JadedDarkness,2,Thu Mar 5 07:22:30 2015 UTC,Haha that's pretty weird! I always thought I was a black sheep when it came to ranking their music. Nice to see that others think the same way! :)
DaftPunk,2xn3sb,Nikolaki8,3,Thu Mar 5 09:49:08 2015 UTC,"Discovery  RAM Homework HAA  Homework has a lot of good songs, but it also has a lot of filler. HAA isn't long enough and half the songs aren't that good."
DaftPunk,2xn3sb,cyan101,2,Mon Mar 2 06:02:47 2015 UTC,"Homework - I remember seeing that music video for ""Da Funk"" on MTV and being hooked on it. It was one of the first songs that got me really into electronic and house music. The album was raw, loud and packed with catchy singles like ""Around the World"" and ""Burnin'"". I love the more aggressive-sounding tracks like ""Rollin' & Scratchin'"" and ""Rock 'n' Roll"" that has since been absent in later DP releases. Easily my favorite album of theirs. (Favorite tracks: Honestly, every track is a gem. Gonna have to cop out and say they're all great!) Discovery - The hype for this album escalated when ""One More Time"" dropped. I appreciate the change of pace of implementing more funk and soul samples as with Thomas Bangalter's solo work and Guy-Manuel's Le Knight Club project. When it first came out, it was hard to adjust to the more pop-oriented sound, but in later years it grew on me. Hearing the album alongside Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem is a fun experience as well. (Favorite tracks: ""One More Time"", ""Aerodynamic"", ""Digital Love"", ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", ""High Life"", ""Something About Us"", ""Short Circuit"", and ""Face to Face"".) Random Access Memories - Arguably their most divisive effort, but I'd say if you enjoyed Discovery for its disco-inspired approach, you'll dig RAM. The live instrumentation and heavier emphasis on lyrics is perhaps the most striking change. While that is the case, it adds much-needed diversity into the songs themselves. Although it's second to last in my own list, it's a good album in my book. They deserved that Grammy! (Favorite tracks: ""Give Life Back to Music"", ""The Game of Love"", ""Lose Yourself to Dance"", ""Get Lucky"", ""Doin' It Right"", and ""Contact"") Human After All - HAA had potential, but I just find it extremely repetitive and mindless, though you could say it is the intended effect. I just expected more. There was a clear rock-driven sound throughout which I enjoyed when I first heard ""Robot Rock"" until you realize you heard all the track had going for two minutes in. Again, I love seeing artists venturing in to different styles of music and not necessarily doing the same thing over and over again, but I think DP missed the ball here. (Favorite tracks: ""Human After All"", ""The Prime Time of Your Life"", ""Robot Rock"", and ""Technologic"".)"

DaftPunk,2xn3sb,datnewguywithashoe,0,Mon Mar 9 08:28:37 2015 UTC,Idk they haven't used drum machines in a while which I thought they were virtuoso's at. While Omar Hakim adds so much life to the drums in RAM I still miss what they did with sequencers and drum machines.

I also love Interstella 5555  RAM was a very good album, I love it.  Homework has awesome songs in it, but I often get tired listening to it, as it is a long album, with songs that are all very similar to each other. Homework was originally just singles anyway, they just packed all of them into one album. Still rises above HAA, because it's a legendary album, and all the songs are great, it just doesn't work as an album that you listen from the beginning to the end.  HAA is the last, even though the theme of the album is very strong. The songs are just very basic and half of them are just fillers. You really can hear that it was produced in a very short amount of time, was it two months? Two weeks? I don't remember :D"

A recomendation is to cut out the around the world vocals once the HBFS vocals come in. And every once in a while tease the beginning parts where the synth first comes in. Good luck!

DaftPunk,2x4pn3,iiRockpuppy,0,Thu Feb 26 04:51:36 2015 UTC,I've always heard vinyls should be set straight up and down. Stacking them flat causes the weight to warp them and at an angle beds them slowly as well.

DaftPunk,2wwkww,Signaturenation,2,Mon Feb 23 20:08:36 2015 UTC,"Justice - D.A.N.C.E.  Sebastian - Embody  Sebastian - Tetra  Tepr - Minuit Jacuzi (Data Remix)  DJ Mehdi - Signatune (Thomas Bangalter Edit)  Danger - 9h20  La Roux - In For The Kill (Danger Ocean Remix)  Chromeo - Tenderoni (MSTRKRFT Remix)  Justice is probably going to be your bread and butter. When they blew up in the mid-00s a lot of people considered them the second coming of French electronic music, and there was even some speculation that it was Daft Punk themselves producing music under a new alias (not actually the case, mind you). Like others have said, Cross is a great album. A lot of the harder edged electronic music that exists today probably owes a debt to that album. Their live albums A Cross The Universe and Access All Arenas are also top notch and they relate to the studio albums pretty much exactly the same way that Alive 2007 relates to Daft's studio albums. That being said, I'd go Cross>A Cross The Universe>Audio, Video, Disco>Access All Arenas. The change between Cross and AVD is kind of jarring but they work really well together on the second live album. Also check out the Planisphere EP.  I'd also recommend checking out Nero's BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix from 2010. They operate between heavy electro and dubstep but they borrowed a lot of their aesthetic from Daft and Justice. The whole mix is great in my opinion, but if you're mainly interested in the French electro vibe you should focus on the 0:38 to 1:06 mark."
DaftPunk,2wwkww,st0567,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"The best way to think of Cross and Audio Video Disco is that cross is to Homework as Audio Video Disco is to Discovery(in terms of sound, not in terms of quality, I personally think AVD has a few of justices best songs, but Cross is a more consistently good album)"

Here's a comment I made a while back if you want to get into Chromeo:   Jealous (I Ain't With It) - Catchy single, Chromeo's equivalent to 'Get Lucky' Night by Night - Possibly their best single melodically, production and lyric wise. Chords are similar to 'Beyond' Mercury Tears - Also reminiscent of a track like 'Beyond' with vocoder vocals. It sounds like a very early electronic-era song Over Your Shoulder - Solid funk track with a few sexual lyrics Needy Girl - Their first single incorporates possibly their best bassline which melts into the track so well that you barely notice it, even though the production makes it a very prominent instrument  Fall Back 2U - A Jamiroquai-esque track with its sharp 80s strings. Possibly the best song on their new album in my opinion   Have fun!"

DaftPunk,2wvzbw,SIMULATIONTERMINATED,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:29:49 2015 UTC,I send and e-mail and got one back saying they'd    send these out today via First Class post   I'm a little impressed actually Ö

DaftPunk,2wx8nc,77jamjam,2,Mon Feb 23 22:46:37 2015 UTC,On the super heroes part with the power work is never over I would make it ha most a bit more quite. Not enough to where its not there and not to much where it take a over the part. And I would have it fade out in the end of it as well instead of a complete stop. Great job though man I love this I would also say the fatter richer sound would be cool. But I really like what you did man keep it up! :D
DaftPunk,2wx8nc,mewe123,0,Tue Feb 24 18:24:04 2015 UTC,Thanks :D
DaftPunk,2wx8nc,aarol01,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:00:03 2015 UTC,"It sounds nice, it doesn't have enough bass and fatness to my taste, but that often happens to me also when I make tracks. Mastering is hard and I have never really got that great sound from my tracks. Also the Human after all sample in the end should have been a few beats different, I can't explain it in English. However, it's a very nice mashup and a good concept. I'll leave a like :) (I am sorry if i misheard it, I am listening in a car with earbuds, so the sound might not come perfect for me.)"
DaftPunk,2wx8nc,Nikolaki8,1 point,Tue Feb 24 09:10:50 2015 UTC,"If it was equalised better, if HBFS was on key with Superheroes and if HAA came in a beat earlier or so this would've been an amazing mix.   Good concept, not great execution unfortunately."
DaftPunk,2wsr0j,DesolatePhant0M,1 point,Sun Feb 22 21:20:12 2015 UTC,Beautiful. How much was it?
DaftPunk,2wsr0j,retrofag,3,Sun Feb 22 23:44:01 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I got mine for $10 on a boardwalk in Ocean City. Same as the online store. It's hanging above my records, just put it up last week actually. Great find, good condition - I got another DP one there as well, so if you're in the area I would check it out (forgot the specific store, sorry)."
DaftPunk,2wsr0j,iiRockpuppy,3,Mon Feb 23 05:14:33 2015 UTC,"Damn dude, 10 dollars? I was expecting something like 30, nice find! What does the other poster have?"

DaftPunk,2wsymt,Shroomulated,7,Mon Feb 23 04:21:21 2015 UTC,It's a bootleg movie
DaftPunk,2wsymt,Nikolaki8,1 point,Mon Feb 23 05:02:39 2015 UTC,For 9.99 I would have went for it.
DaftPunk,2wtgr5,phonusQ,5,Mon Feb 23 00:42:09 2015 UTC,"Assault? Indo Silver Club pt 1? ...Drive? That's all the obscure Daft Punk tracks I know. If we're talking about pre-Discovery, your mystery tune could be a Roule or Cydamoure release if you can't find it on Homework. I know Thomas on Roule was prone to experimental strangeness."

DaftPunk,2wtgr5,Zoleol,2,Mon Feb 23 11:32:45 2015 UTC,"Could it be ""Extra Dry"" off of Thomas Bangalter's Trax on da Rocks, Vol. 2? As u/ma-avro-dyne pointed out, it could have been either TB's solo work or a Le Knight Club track. It's prominently synth-y as your description said in the comments. I'll keep looking to help you out!"
DaftPunk,2wtgr5,ClosetBronydom,1 point,Mon Feb 23 03:05:48 2015 UTC,Perhaps Revolution 909?

DaftPunk,2wtgr5,AndrewTheShinobi,1 point,Mon Feb 23 08:17:37 2015 UTC,I'm thinking Indo silver club with how the sample shifts once the beat comes in it feels like a time signature change.
