I owned the 2nd gen Moto G for a bit and it was $175. So for basically $100 dollars more, I got a few more apps, and terrible memory management. For $80 you get a decent camera, 5 inch screen, great battery life and guaranteed upgrade to windows 10. That's a fantastic deal."

windowsphone,3dzpeo,TheOneTheTwo,13,Mon Jul 20 21:00:03 2015 UTC,"I have a 1520 and many apps like Tubecast and Readit take 10-30 seconds to load up fresh.  The new Windows 10 apps load blisteringly quick, though. And yes, resuming behaviour is much better. Apps don't reset in the background nearly as much anymore."
windowsphone,3dzpeo,graphiteshard,16,Mon Jul 20 21:48:09 2015 UTC,"Yup,  W10 uses something new called .Net Native that gives you ""the speed of C++ using C#"" which should lead to about 60% less startup time and 25 less memory requirements. AFAIK all W10 apps will by default be compiled into .Net Native by microsoft in the store.  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/04/24/dotnetnative-performance.aspx"
windowsphone,3dzpeo,jippmokk,3,Tue Jul 21 05:30:02 2015 UTC,"As you said, the differences lie only in startup time and memory footprint, not in raw speed.  And yes, it is a requirement for all W10 apps."
windowsphone,3dzpeo,JabNX,0,Tue Jul 21 11:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but seems they might optimize it further so might lead to more performance gains down the line.   Also the dead code isolation might be really useful if you're using a lot of projects at reducing footprint, and less footprint should mean it can keep the app easier in Ram and reduce/eliminate the ""resuming delay"""
windowsphone,3dzpeo,jippmokk,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:39:05 2015 UTC,"If we ever get performance gains, it won't be linked to .NET Native improvements. The only thing it does is to compile your app 'ahead-of-time' instead of 'just-in-time', meaning that your phone won't compile the app when it launches it like any .NET app do. So faster startup time is obvious (no compilation step) and I assume the reduced memory footprint comes from not having to store the compiled app somewhere in RAM."
windowsphone,3dzpeo,JabNX,3,Tue Jul 21 14:37:56 2015 UTC,"That's not strictly true.   JIT compiles  MSIL into machine language. Ngen for instance does that step in advance so it doesn't have to be done on the fly.   .Net Native however runs the IL against a C++ compiler which optimizes better.  .Net Native also analyzes the whole app rather than just JIT it, and optimizes it based on that, which enables it to do stuff like throw away code that isn't used.  That being said, discounting the advantages of taking upp less memory and starting faster the other potential performance gains are probably small. Most performance bottlenecks has more to do with things like IO and the GPU rather than processing.   I'm a little unsure if it might have an impact for things like heavy string manipulation or byte processing for stuff like serialization.  I'm really psyched for it anyways since it will get rid of all bloat that comes with using big libraries.  Here's a good video about it https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/DevRadio/NET-Native-Performance-Optimizing-Your-Windows-Apps-with-NET-Native"
windowsphone,3dzpeo,jippmokk,7,Tue Jul 21 15:03:40 2015 UTC,Both Readit and Tubecast are old Silverlight apps. So no wonder they have poor performance compared to the new Universal apps written in WinRT.
windowsphone,3dzpeo,asm8086,0,Tue Jul 21 06:59:21 2015 UTC,This explains a lot.  Love both of these apps but even on 8.1 they are slow to load when I first launch them.

windowsphone,3dzqr6,Carfar_Farcar,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:30 2015 UTC,"I think it potentially makes sense on phablets like the 1520, on a 930 the 6 across is about as small as I think they dare make it and on smaller displays that definitely looks and feels funky (at least to me).    It would definitely be nice to have the number scale depending on the screen size though, that goes well with their current ""works across everything"" mentality."
windowsphone,3dzqr6,itsmeee,0,Tue Jul 21 03:09:13 2015 UTC,"When I first installed the W10 preview eons ago on my 1520, I wigged out when I saw the 8 tiles across. But now I love it. Had to reflash 8.1 to upgrade to one of the builds and the tiles seemed absolutely, retardedly huge."
windowsphone,3dzqr6,gdebug,3,Tue Jul 21 05:49:11 2015 UTC,"On a side note, the there are no grid lines on folder tiles anymore!"
windowsphone,3dzqr6,sabichos,3,Tue Jul 21 04:24:09 2015 UTC,It looks worse without them! at least put a tiny bit of space between the icons in the folder.
windowsphone,3dzqr6,laughingplague,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:13:37 2015 UTC,yay! that looked horrible
windowsphone,3dzqr6,jippmokk,0,Tue Jul 21 09:50:52 2015 UTC,"I already have 8 small tiles on my 1520, so the news here is that we don't just get to choose between 6 and 8 (or 4 and 6 on smaller devices) or whatever the numbers now are, but that we get to choose everything in between as well."
windowsphone,3dzqr6,zicoz,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:40:17 2015 UTC,Looks cluttered imo. I already get enough comments saying how cluttered my phone looks.
windowsphone,3dzqr6,swantonsoup,6,Tue Jul 21 02:35:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, how people feel about my phone's home screen keeps me up at night too."
windowsphone,3dzqr6,Reddeadinsider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:01:00 2015 UTC,"It just matters because it makes people uninterested in the platform. I love the way it looks but if thats the 1st comment people give, its a bad sign for how people feel about WP."
windowsphone,3dzqr6,swantonsoup,3,Tue Jul 21 10:03:46 2015 UTC,"I don't really care how other ppl view my home screen. I have it organized with a shit ton of folders and I know exactly where everything is, and I'm really excited about cramming more into the home screen, because it means less scrolling to get to the stuff towards the bottom."
windowsphone,3dzqr6,the_boomr,2,Tue Jul 21 03:07:41 2015 UTC,Are you offended by others commenting on the state of the home screen on your phone? Lmfao
windowsphone,3dzqr6,bitchesandsake,0,Tue Jul 21 04:18:39 2015 UTC,no
windowsphone,3dzqr6,swantonsoup,-2,Tue Jul 21 10:03:53 2015 UTC,"Can someone please, please, delete that contacts tile?"
windowsphone,3e1kb4,markyyy999,3,Tue Jul 21 06:31:46 2015 UTC,Here maps have been replaced by Microsoft Maps haven't they?
windowsphone,3e1kb4,pepdavies,3,Tue Jul 21 10:40:51 2015 UTC,Totally think the Here app suite is totally inferior to the default Maps nowadays.
windowsphone,3e1kb4,hohosaregood,2,Tue Jul 21 10:41:55 2015 UTC,Not sure if it actually is but the lack of public transit directions kills it for me. I need my HERE Transit back...
windowsphone,3e1kb4,Pycorax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:25:54 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, I was talking about W10(dunno if there's public transit in W8.1). That definitely has public transit directions and they're pretty well done. Not perfect but getting there."
windowsphone,3e1kb4,hohosaregood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:37:21 2015 UTC,I was too. I think it's a regional issue then. Do you live in the US? It doesn't show the option for public transit here in Singapore.
windowsphone,3e1kb4,Pycorax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:01:22 2015 UTC,I see it in the UK. AFAIK Windows maps uses Here data so the differences should be minimal
windowsphone,3e1kb4,Mkeallison,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:06 2015 UTC,"Naw. Here would let me redirect my path. I don't see any options for that... Including the options to avoid tolls, highways, and other occurrences in traffic."
windowsphone,3e1kb4,xconomicron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, although I think the maps are provided by HERE."
windowsphone,3e1kb4,Endzeit_now,3,Tue Jul 21 20:51:27 2015 UTC,"Go to Marketplace > My Apps.  You should wait for all the apps (that you've ever had, sorted by recency*) to list. And then you select the apps you wish to install on the device, and hit install.  *I know this word doesn't exist.. :P"
windowsphone,3e1kb4,namoraesir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:13:22 2015 UTC,"Nope didn't work, says HERE maps is no longer available."
windowsphone,3e1kb4,xconomicron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:07:26 2015 UTC,I have the same problem.
