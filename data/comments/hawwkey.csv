hawwkey,3bvacd,TyPiper93,7,Thu Jul 2 13:05:16 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if I haven't had enough caffine or what but I have no idea what the title or tweet are trying to say. Something about putting Datsyuk and Zetterberg back on the same line but other than that I'm lost.
hawwkey,3bvacd,TangyRaptor,8,Thu Jul 2 14:52:58 2015 UTC,"Red Wings signed C Brad Richards so Datsyuk and Zetterberg can be linemates. IIRC, they are pretty close buddies off-ice."
hawwkey,3bvacd,Drithyin,3,Thu Jul 2 15:18:55 2015 UTC,"Red Wings signed Richards to boost their center depth.  This allows datsyuk and the beard to play together again, since they won't have to each be centering a separate line.  At least, that's how I'm interpreting this."
hawwkey,3bvacd,tasteofflames,3,Thu Jul 2 15:17:33 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I see it now.  ""Datsyuk was told by Holland that the Wings signed Richards so that Pavel and Henrik could play on the same line again""  Thanks!"
hawwkey,3bvacd,TangyRaptor,6,Thu Jul 2 15:34:49 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what the tweet is saying... for years, the Wings have ""struggled"" with consistent centers so they've had to break up Z and Dats otherwise known as the Euro Twins, those two are dynamite together. Wings recently signed Brad Richards who will fill in as a vet on probably the 2nd line and Dats back on first with Z. GM Ken Holland actually met with Datsyuk to specifically tell him that he and Z will be back on a line together."
hawwkey,3bvacd,TangyRaptor,2,Thu Jul 2 18:12:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the in depth clarification. There were a couple of things that went into my confusion:   I hadn't heard about the Wings signing Brad Richards yet and the first Richards that came to mind was Mike I forgot that Holland was the new coach  GM of the Wings so I read it as the ""Holland Wings"" team It was early and the wording seemed odd"

hawwkey,2xxo76,downhillcarver,5,Thu Mar 5 07:11:25 2015 UTC,I can't for the life of me figure out why two NHL goalies would be switching sides like that. What's happening here?
hawwkey,2xxo76,hambwner,11,Thu Mar 5 14:56:12 2015 UTC,"Glass broke with a minute left in the first. Instead of waiting to fix it with no TV timeouts left they end the period. Well sorta. They come back for the second but need to finish the last minute of the first. So they do the first period with the remaining time left, then they have to switch sides for the second period so they had to cross paths. Make sense?"
hawwkey,2xxo76,TheeVande,5,Thu Mar 5 15:53:54 2015 UTC,So basically there was a 19 minute period and a 21 minute period?

hawwkey,2pgnz8,Verisade,10,Tue Dec 16 18:57:09 2014 UTC,"Why I love Tyke Hockey! [0:57]   My youngest daughter, Amara (age 4), is the smallest player on the Gore Bay Tyke hockey team. She is quick to tell you that she is #12 and actually plays in games, not just practices. Depending on the arena she is playing in, she can not watch the game because she can't see over the boards. She sometimes has to be lifted onto the ice. But you can hear her cheer from anywhere in any arena. We thought that Amara was the smallest in the league until we met Arabella (age 3) from Manitowaning, who also happens to be #12. My daughter was awarded her team's player of the game because of what happened in the video. I would like to thank her coaches, Clayton Best, Darren Nodecker, Chad Chevrette and Shane Ingram, for helping instill these kinds of values into these young players.
