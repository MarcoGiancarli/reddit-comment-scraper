I imagine that he has been getting a lot of flack when New Horizon showed that pluto was larger than they originally thought (i think like 2-3% larger). Most likely people are asking if pluto can be a planet again.   The other reference is from Pulp Fiction. It's the scene in the college kid's apartment where Samuel L. Jackson is pointing a gun at a guy who is fumbling with his words and keeps saying what, and jackson points his gun at him and says, ""Say what again. Say what again.

wallpaper,3dmee0,byehiday,6,Sat Jul 18 05:52:15 2015 UTC,"It's like 2 or 3% larger from what I read. Anyway the fact that it's now a dozen miles larger in diameter than Eris(which is still more massive than Pluto) doesn't really make for any argument to return pluto to planet status, since they decided on the key factor for planethood being a ""cleared orbit"""
wallpaper,3dmee0,Assumer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:03 2015 UTC,He.. What?  I don't think Tyson is a part of the International Astronomical Union (the group in charge of planetary status).  He just supports their re-classification. Same as any other scientist.
wallpaper,3dmee0,AtomicSteve21,7,Fri Jul 17 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"From his wikapdeia page:  ""As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keepPluto from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on The Colbert Report, The Daily Show, and BBC Horizon that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.[41] In 2006, theInternational Astronomical Union (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the dwarf planet classification.""  So no he wasn't on the actual board, however he had a direct influence via papers and interviews prior to the unions decision. He was a big proponent of plutos declassification. He, himself likened it to ""driving the get away car."""

He happens to be an astrophysicist (one full PhD, nine honorary), director of a prominent planetarium, a prolific writer on the subject of astronomy, and has served on several commissions tasked with advising congress and government agencies with respect to the future of space policy.

wallpaper,3d5ac7,m1g1d,15,Mon Jul 13 19:46:38 2015 UTC,I was a big fan of Legend of Korra. I'm not sure which on I like better just because they're so different. Korra is a lot more serious of a show compared to the origionals.
wallpaper,3d5ac7,Stephenishere,11,Mon Jul 13 20:59:21 2015 UTC,I personally like Korra more. The fights were waaay more epic and the unique bending has been really developed by this point. Lava bending and Metal bending were awesome.
