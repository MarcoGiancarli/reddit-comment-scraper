bapcsalescanada,3e43p4,devilmonk,2,Tue Jul 21 23:12:14 2015 UTC,"I've been using the MX 3000 for a while, theres some things you should know.   While there are LED lights on the top and side of the mouse, only the side ones can be turned off. The LED lights on the top of the mouse are very bright, I often cover it with a small cloth while watching tv shows or movies. Its a bit small, I had to adjust from a palm-style grip to a claw-grip. This was a natural change that I didn't even notice, but a warning none the less. Its DPI goes up in increments. If I recall it was 500, 1200, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, 8000. You cannot change the dpi presets or have a custom dpi setting. while it appears to have three programmable buttons on the left, the middle one can not be reprogrammed. It is only for changing the color of the light the mouse emits.   Edit  While my comment seems fairly negative, I have been using this mouse for over a year without any problems. Its cheap, has adjustable weights, and the dpi adjustment is very convenient. I'll be playing a game that forces your mouse sensitivity to lower while your scoped, and I can easily adjust it to a comfortable level. Its great for certain situations and very helpful. You just have to get used to the big jumps within the increments. Nothing is broken in the mouse.  A good program to get used to a higher dpi setting is OSU by the way. I'm comfortable with up to 4000 dpi now for everyday use."

And the leds are excellent.   Pic of build with lights off  I reccomend them. Just take note that they are NOT silent fans.
bapcsalescanada,3dyqmu,foxtrot1_1,-7,Tue Jul 21 15:23:06 2015 UTC,"Why does anyone want LEDs etc in their cases? It seems to be a thing that everyone enjoys, according to the products I see. My computer sits on the floor and I don't want to draw attention to it. A window is cool but I don't need funky lighting to highlight my l33t build."
bapcsalescanada,3dyqmu,THEJAZZMUSIC,8,Mon Jul 20 17:13:49 2015 UTC,Some people do want to draw attention to their computer. *shrug*

bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,arikv2,4,Mon Jul 20 13:51:08 2015 UTC,"Damn, 1 USD = 1.30114 CAD.  Oil price is sinking the dollar."
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,l33tdude,-3,Mon Jul 20 13:54:16 2015 UTC,Yup...And high end graphics cost an arm and a leg.  Canada is heading into a recession and there's nothing we can do about it.  I'm sure our Conservative majority will use it as an excuse to cut more government programs and scientific spending...
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,arikv2,5,Mon Jul 20 14:53:33 2015 UTC,"Recession? Hardly. Certain parts of Canada are having hard times, but a low dollar increases exports exponentially. So where the oil sector hurts, the manufacturing sector excels. Also, it pretty much kills cross border shopping and keeps more money in Canada."
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,Zergom,9,Mon Jul 20 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"As a rule of thumb,  a recession is defined as a drop in the GDP for 2 consecutive quarters. A couple days ago the government announced that we had a ""mild contraction in our GDP for the first half of the year"". So yeah, we're technically in a recession."
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,Mybootsareonfire,4,Mon Jul 20 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"Well they started by freezing tuition costs, raising the minimum wage, and removing corporate money from government.  I would say that's as good a start as any party would ever have the balls to do."

bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,10GuyIsDrunk,3,Mon Jul 20 16:09:23 2015 UTC,"What? You built a PC in December and because hardware prices are going up after they no longer matter to you, you're going to sell it and just play on consoles? At maximum, in an amazing deal, if you sell now, you'll profit what? $500-$1000?  And you're doing this so that you can play on console where games are now $80 as a standard? Sometimes as ""cheap"" as $70?  Am I understanding you?"
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,Fuckoff_CPS,0,Mon Jul 20 17:53:12 2015 UTC,Profit maybe $400. I already own the console and the games I want to play so i'd essentially be making $400 to stop playing games on the computer. That's how i'm looking at it.
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,10GuyIsDrunk,2,Tue Jul 21 00:51:38 2015 UTC,"You couldn't pay me $400 to stop playing games on PC for the year even if I got to keep my PC, and I already own the consoles and a bunch of games too.  Your call though man. Seems like a waste of an effort to buy and build the PC and of the money you've put into PC games since they won't be getting played at all."

bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,arikv2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:38:08 2015 UTC,"Fanless idle isn't that big of a deal unless it's beside your ear. I've done silent computer for years, I even have a fanless psu. Chances are your psu has a louder fan than new gpu idles anyway."
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,rockasaur123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:27 2015 UTC,Psu fan isn't on at idle ;) I'm going for truly silent. So does this gpu have it or not do you know?
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,medium_red,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:15 2015 UTC,"I know the gigabyte g1 970 can't go below 34% fan speed. Pretty sure they introduced the silent idle on the 960 and then carried it over to the 980 ti.  So 960 and 980ti have silent mode, 970 and 980 do not."
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,rockasaur123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:37:01 2015 UTC,Now if only the 980ti wasn't 1k after tax
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,arikv2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I have a 980 Strix.  Keep in mind these 0db cards have high idle temps.  My 980 idles at 60c because it doesn't run fans until it hits 60c.  I also have a 144hz monitor so that might contribute to high idle temp."
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,rockasaur123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:26:31 2015 UTC,"Higher idle temps dont bother me. After tax I can get this for $680 so I'm very tempted, heard they overclock like a beast. But without 0db its a huge turnoff."
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,arikv2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:08:40 2015 UTC,"Well keep in mind 0db is only at idle.  Under load I don't usually hear the video card but on hot days sometimes I do, and this is overclocked.  It overclocks okay.  Above the factory overclock I got an additional 150mhz with the extra voltage but I don't modify bios because that's just silly."
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,rockasaur123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:31 2015 UTC,"I know it's only at idle. I'm looking for a silent idle pc, while also fairly quiet under load obviously too. Price on this is decent imo, being as 980ti is 1k after tax."
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,arikv2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:01 2015 UTC,You might want to check out Ebay if you are willing to risk it.  I just picked up a 980 for 500$ not to mention you don't have to pay tax on Ebay if it's a private seller and not a business.
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,rockasaur123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:25:26 2015 UTC,EBay sketches me out idk. Good deal though
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,arikv2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:35:11 2015 UTC,"To be fair you are paying less because it is higher risk.  But considering you can just as well get a DOA card from etailers in Canada and they are jerks about replacing it, you might as well try Ebay since they have an excellent return policy if you're unsatisfied with your buyer."
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,10GuyIsDrunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:00:29 2015 UTC,No I don't believe gigabyte chose to go with silent-idle on this or their 970.
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,l33tdude,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:04:55 2015 UTC,Wow sweet price!  Looks like flash sale:  Special price ends 07/22/2015. Limited quantities will not last long.
bapcsalescanada,3dxy0l,SaySorry,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:15 2015 UTC,It's like $10 off from what it usually goes for? I don't get the hype. The 980 has always had a $200 gap from the 970.
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,TwoEmosOneRazor,5,Mon Jul 20 04:37:03 2015 UTC,"That's actually cheaper than America (495 after MIR), and that's before our MIR. Wow, shocked."
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,AttackOfTheThumbs,4,Mon Jul 20 04:47:38 2015 UTC,$495 USD = $643 CAD  I'm honestly surprised that we got a cheaper high end card than the US due the low dollar.
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,forsayken,4,Mon Jul 20 04:56:28 2015 UTC,Deal isn't super duper.  MSI 980 for $620 with no MIR.  http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127840&cm_re=gtx_980-_-14-127-840-_-Product  The EVGA is pretty overclocked though. All depends how much you want to deal with a MIR.
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,devilmonk,4,Mon Jul 20 13:33:33 2015 UTC,meanwhile
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,quadraphonic,3,Mon Jul 20 08:38:04 2015 UTC,"Still 1.5x the price of a GTX 970 without 1.5x the performance. If this card is in the budget, I'd say it's worthwhile to save a touch more for a 980 Ti."
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,atfsix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:10:52 2015 UTC,So 970/390 would be a better deal than this?
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,quadraphonic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:50:31 2015 UTC,"IMO, yes, given price/performance. For 1080, either would be fine, for 1440 the 390 makes a bit more sense given its extra memory."
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,miloheej,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:17:50 2015 UTC,"Just saw this in my email too, it looks like a decent deal especially because EVGA seems like a great company."

bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,Krayeton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:04:50 2015 UTC,"Happened to me too. It was only for $10 so I didn't really bother complaining about it. Still, the PNY and ASUS ones came through for me."
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,AttackOfTheThumbs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:11:40 2015 UTC,I did the math and at check out it was $744 so with the MIR if it does go through i'll only save like $13 am I missing something? sorry i'm super tired and don't want to fuck up.
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,THEJAZZMUSIC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:14:13 2015 UTC,Are you comparing the same cards? There are cheaper 980s. Windforce 3 was on for 600 somewhere.
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,karmapopsicle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:27:44 2015 UTC,Are you looking at the classified edition on amazon? Are you looking at your total at checkout or just the sticker price on amazon?  $779 for this card on amazon.ca is quite a leap.
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,Krayeton,3,Mon Jul 20 17:21:12 2015 UTC,"Good deal on this particular card? Yes. Good deal in terms of performance for your dollar? Not even slightly. If you're going Nvidia, stick to the 970 at ~$400, or jump up to the 980 Ti at ~$800.   The 980 only offers about 15% more performance than the 970 for 50% more money."
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,karmapopsicle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:16:20 2015 UTC,So I should wait and go for the 980ti if a sale shows up?
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,miloheej,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:09:56 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd just stick with a 970 and keep the $400. It will give you a great experience.   I used to try and chase maxed settings in all games, but I realized I was spending more time tweaking/overclocking/etc than actually enjoying my games."
bapcsalescanada,3dwsnc,glork13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:14 2015 UTC,Pretty solid deal. You probably won't find much better than this in the near future.

It still works wired, it still has a touch pad so your hands don't have to leave the controller unless you need to type, the D-pad still actually works, and it's still a better controller in the sense of shape and feel.

I've already pre-ordered the Steam controller, if it ends up being the better PC controller than that'll be great, but that'll still leave the DS4 as the best dual analog-stick controller."
bapcsalescanada,3dujzy,10GuyIsDrunk,2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:56 2015 UTC,Then you should know controllers are a matter of preference and hand size better than others.

When I say that the DS4 is the best dual analog-stick controller on the market I am obviously speaking my own personal belief and opinion.

To me, I have no warranty, it is used, have zero expectation of credibility of the seller, and have lost the consumer experience, as intangible as thing as that is. I won't buy a used component if I'm not saving at least 25%. Too many markets are full of buyers too eager to save $20, which costs the buyer all their power.   Try out other Kijiji locations. When I was living in Ontario, I used to be close to London and had all kinds of problems with sellers wanting costs comparable to new. I checked Kitchener area and found it to be far friendlier to the buyer."

They jacked up the starting bids like crazy for all the cards they have.. maybe they noticed that a few had been going away cheap? (the other 280 went for 170).

Guy said it still has the warranty and the card just didn't fit in his case. I trusted him and it works great! I sold my 7870s for $120 and $100 so the card effectively cost me $80 which I'm very glad for. I was actually about to drop like $600 on a 390X but I thought about it hard and saved myself like $300+ for similar performance. This is my first time selling/buying second hand cards and it's just so much more reasonable for me.

The crazy thing is that the prices in the states were so much lower and a 290 was much cheaper than a 390 in the US, but here in Canada the difference was barely $50. So why not go for the newer card?  I kept agonizing over what to do and then I realized I'm agonizing over $50 which is going to be ammortized over at least 3 years of use.... so in the end it wasn't worth worrying about.

Due mostly to our dollar, it sucks that holding out for the 3xx didn't pay off at all. Complete rebrands with no advantage worth the money over their 2xx counterparts.  Everything would be a bit better if our dollar wasn't so bad compared to US but it's not looking like that will improve any time soon. You'll probably just have to suck it up.

After all that waiting and, IMO, disappointing results from AMD, I pulled the trigger on my build.  I knew it would be a touch higher given our exchange rate, but just set price thresholds for my  parts and price matched where I could, buying parts over a 4 week period.

bapcsalescanada,3dmmp0,newmetaplank,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"I was in the same shoes as you. I waited until after the announcement and the club3d cards went up to from 200 to around 240 for the 280 models.   I ended up looking through local kijiji sales for 280x's/HD7970's and found one for 170 the day after the prices rose. Luckily, the seller lived about 10-15 minutes away and just walked over and picked up the card.   I think going the used cards route might be a good alternative to waiting for the dollar to fall though there are some easily mitigated risks involved with buying used, such as checking out for any significant coil whine, interfacing, or physical damage."

I'm gonna hold out until the R9 Nano's out. Might get that if I can get more performance than my 280x and use less power to do so.

There are a ton of games on GOG that I want to play, which should work perfectly fine.    I can easily afford a card, but I am trying to figure out how much power I actually need.  Coming from PS3, I would be satisfied with less than 60FPS on medium settings at 1080p for most intensive games, but also want the card to last a while.   I have also become a bit obsessed with finding a deal, which kind of absurd because in the end I will only save $30."

bapcsalescanada,3dqyw6,kardkoach,2,Sat Jul 18 16:40:24 2015 UTC,Too expensive for such little features.  144hz and gsync are the selling points here.  Everything else in the monitor is worth 150$.  Are those 2 features worth 330$? I would say probably no.
bapcsalescanada,3dqyw6,arikv2,2,Sat Jul 18 17:25:33 2015 UTC,"You wont even find any 144hz monitor for 150$. The bare minimun is the Acer GN246HL for 259, and it lack a lot of features that is common on the $300-350 range.  Also, this OP monitor has gsync. You can argue how much you would pay on it, but it usually raises $150-200 on the final price.  For last, this is the cheapest gsync monitor you can find today. I'm really tempted to buy it.  EDIT: You can get a $50 dollar gift card by adding the 50FGC500 on cart."
bapcsalescanada,3dqyw6,Benegripe,2,Sat Jul 18 22:20:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on what features you want.  If it's gotta be G-Sync @ 144Hz then it does appear to be one of the cheapest as of right now.

With the cashback and other rewards it's less then 10$.  BIG UPDATE, ok you get 10000 Bonus points AND the membership gives you 10000, that's 80$ plus a 50$ gift card AND special prices for example the 8350 is 214$ if you are a SSS member it's 206$.

bapcsalescanada,3dm09e,GhilliedFox,7,Fri Jul 17 10:59:22 2015 UTC,"CC has very poor CS as do NCIX and Newegg and Tigerdirect. Though Newegg has the fastest shipping (usually not free) and ncix probably has the most walk in stores. Newegg also cancelled their iron egg price guarantee recently, so NCIX would be the most likely to PM of those 4. And avoid Tigerdirect at all costs, they're corrupt as fuck. I haven't dealt with the others."

In store there are a very small percentage of employees who are genuinely happy to help you, others are just well, doing their job. I never understood that in the industry."

bapcsalescanada,3dm09e,windrixx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:08:23 2015 UTC,Their customer service is fine. Sometimes it is good and sometimes it is bad. I don't think a blanket statement can characterize it.

Though, if I'm going in store I know exactly what I'm getting, and I've made sure they have it in. The only times I browse is if the mrs has to go somewhere nearby. That being said I'm quite a regular at their Mavis location haha."
bapcsalescanada,3dm09e,Jogawild,2,Sat Jul 18 00:12:07 2015 UTC,"TigerDirect is an utter shithole. Doing business with them is a nightmare. They haven't been able to setup my business account properly yet. NCIX did that shit up in less than a minute. NewEgg doesn't have a business program in Canada, but they have everything on their website. TD has the shitiest products and for the shitiest prices."

Don't go by their website price because it is often not updated. Request a quote and if you find it cheaper somewhere else they will beat or at least match the price.  Canada Computers customer service is very poor if you have issues with hardware.  NCIX has decent pricing, but if you have issues with orders or products the customer service can be hit or miss...  Newegg charges a lot for shipping, but they are not bad to deal with.  I have never purchased from Vuugo.  The other option is Amazon Canada.  Not always the cheapest pricing, but the customer service is usually pretty good."

I used to work at a CC and I like to think my store was one of the best if not the best. Prices are good, MRSP is usually the same as online competitors TG/NewEgg and they can have some pretty awesome weekend sales.  They have a 10% restocking fee on most items, and you can't return headsets.  Anyways CC is great if you have one nearby and you know what you want/need, you can go in store and get either same price/slightly more expensive items without having to pay or wait for shipping. Some staff are super knowledgeable some staff give shitty advice so personally I wouldn't ask any one else to help me pick something. It's also nice to be able to actually view display items, mice/keyboards/Monitors/TV's, they even started selling DXracer chairs."

bapcsalescanada,3dm09e,Jakewadewood,2,Sat Jul 18 13:48:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I can give any tips, just be some one they want to work with lol.  The only really tip I can give is make sure you know all components that go into building a pc, and some general knowledge of other tech they sell. When interviewed they will run a sales scenario where you have to ""sell"" them a build from the ground up. So know some bassic sales tactics.  -Introduce yourself, ask if they need assistance ""I want a custom computer""  -Ask what it's use is for, gaming? Browsing? Media work?  -Ask what price range they would like to keep it in.  -Do they want to take the parts home and build it themselves?  -Do they need a monitor? Mouse? Keyboard?  -From there go around with them picking parts and explaining why in layman's terms ""I would recommend an i5 and here's why""   And probably the most important part(sadly) of any sales job and a way to really impress your interviewer, upsell some software/Warranty.   Even if you don't know what they sell in terms of either, just mention ""Would you be interest in an anti virus and our 3 year warranty on these parts?"" All tech stores live on upselling, especially  warranties, you will have to ask every customer on every purchase that can be warrantied, if not you have a lazy supervisor. Personally I didn't push any warranty or product I didn't think was worth it, but I also had high sales numbers and decent warranty numbers so I never got in shit. But people who don't try get canned real quick.  The discount is after 3 months probation you pay what the store pays everything can be bought at cost, you're also eligible for partnership programs, for example I was able to buy my Wacom Tablet directly from bamboo for 60% after a week of working there because they have discounts for retail employees, and you're part of intels retail edge where you can get hexa cores for like 100$."

The guy told me about a Gigabyte MIR I didn't know about, which shockingly was approved (they aren't listed as an authorized retailer).

bapcsalescanada,3dha73,DragonEarth,3,Thu Jul 16 17:57:43 2015 UTC,"Eh. Depends on so many factors all I can say is that its people selling stuff. You meet up in public, I have never had any issues. Common sense goes further than a rulebook will."
bapcsalescanada,3dha73,GoodGoyimGreg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:11:51 2015 UTC,I already have my kijiji alert setup for this :D
bapcsalescanada,3dha73,aeclasik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:03:02 2015 UTC,"I think that's incredibly optimistic. Almost all of them on kijiji right now are $100+ with three in the GTA being $80. On Amazon, even including used, I don't see anything under $150.  People said this about Assassins Creed IV, COD Ghosts, and Battlefield 4 when BesyBuy was giving them away (practically) after they all sold out. Didn't happen. They were definitely being sold, but for at least $40 in almost all cases.   The reality is there's no reason for anyone to sell it for less than they paid, and little reason not to sell it for more than they paid, since the going price is above what they paid. You might nab a deal, but you'll have to be watching kijiji like a fucking hawk."

Strangely enough, I learned only a few months ago that you can often get portable/enclosed drives often cheaper than bare drives, because companies usually put their slower drives in these.

bapcsalescanada,3dha73,jengajinga,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:58:34 2015 UTC,"Ex-UPS employee here. You probably live in an area that has been deemed unsafe for driver release. This typically happens if a lot of stolen packages have been reported in your area in the past, or you have a very small or non-existent porch.  As for the not knocking, drivers will always knock if they aren't allowed to driver release the package on your porch. For a job that is almost always 8-14h a day in brutal, shit work, the drivers like to complete their work as quickly as possible. It is always faster to get a signature than scan, enter non-delivery to alternate delivery location, and then write the delivery notice."

Not insane but $100-$120 for a 250GB drive is good. And Crucial make good drives.

There was a 1 hour period after midnight PST or 3am EST to purchase yourself a blue yeti. It was even announced in the megathread in this sub approximately 30minutes after the sale started. Sure you can blame me because I stocked up thinking it was some bug as it was 50% off 50% or you can blame yourself for deciding, ""Oh hey, maybe the good deals wont be sold out the moment it starts because thats how black friday works right?""    I don't plan on saying sorry for reselling 3 of the extras I bought and I hope you guys come to your senses before you start blaming someone on the internet for you being unable to stay awake fully knowing there will be a sale.

Stop blaming users that stay up,  its like boxing day, don't blame those that stay in line since midnight, because you have your important beauty sleep.  There was approximately 1 hour after the sale started to get yourself a mic, and it was announced in the megathread 30 minutes after the sale started. YOU HAD 30 WHOLE minutes of notification to purchase it assuming you were awake.

Went on shop.ca and found the 850 EVO 256 GB for 149.99 and after the coupns from the thread it came down to 99.99 with free shipping.  Only annoying thing is the $50 coupon credit is applied after taxes, not before, so the taxes are applied to the 149.99 instead om the 99.99.   Final checkout price paid is $107.49 CAD (including 5% sales tax (Alberta)).  I then went on Amazon and cancelled the order for the MX100."

I have run into problems where the keys no longer work after a reinstall or something, likely because all the keys associated with a specific account the seller was using became blacklisted. The sellers there are pretty straightforward though, they are aware that sometimes their keys will fail after some time and will provide you with a replacement.      I wish I knew about this beforehand, because I bought like 50 keys from /r/softwareswap when they were doing it and several keys went bad. Honestly, for me, I'd rather just crack them or buy it  legitimately, but everyone has different opinions on that matter. Chances are, the one key you buy from there will be fine."
bapcsalescanada,3dgc18,GameOnTurtle,4,Thu Jul 16 02:56:22 2015 UTC,I've never had a problem with the 10 keys I've purchased from /u/s5ean. I often use them for new builds for friends/my own builds. IMO if you want a cheap key that's real this is the best way to go about it

I think it's a fair deal to pay for the copy, but some people might have an issue with constantly running testing software as production.

bapcsalescanada,3de34j,Zalgroth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:05:23 2015 UTC,"If you are not a competitive gamer who really cares about a few milliseconds of response time. I always recommend IPS panel which has more vivid color and wide viewing angle. Also try to get a PWM-free monitor if possible, it will not flicker and will not cause fatigue to your eyes. For under 200 I dont think you can get 1440P or 144 Hz so I'd say do your research and get an IPS."

bapcsalescanada,3demy2,unstabLe_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:19:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the source. So I should just aim for CL9 (Or lower, but haven't found any) and as much clock speed as possible while keeping the price low? I'm trying to pair it with an ASUS Z97-A unless I find a better mobo."
bapcsalescanada,3demy2,YouShouldBeProud,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:20:28 2015 UTC,"There are only certain combinations of ram speed and latency available. My advice is look for a reliable brand and avoid CL11 or above/ 1600Mhz or below. Also 1.5 V Rams are considered better than 1.65V ones.   Ram is least likely to be your systems bottleneck so get anything you like, a colour scheme that matches your build or a design you like beats a frame or two in games any day."
bapcsalescanada,3demy2,unstabLe_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:26:27 2015 UTC,Great! I would pull the trigger except the page is tripping out now. It won't let me add to cart. Keeps going to $140 and back down to $58.  Edit: Think it's gone.
bapcsalescanada,3demy2,YouShouldBeProud,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"Z97-A is a very solid choice. I got mine for 160. Runs fantastically and it can charge my phones via USB even when system is turned off so I really like it. But as most mobo, it handles anything above 1866Mhz in OC mode anyway so you don't need to aim for a super high speed. If you buy a 1.5V ram you can OC you ram anyway."

bapcsalescanada,3db00u,ssabrila,3,Wed Jul 15 01:39:17 2015 UTC,Very bad sale just looking at it. Looks no different from a monthly sale.
bapcsalescanada,3db00u,Zren,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:52:26 2015 UTC,They're really hyping up this sale for really shitty marked down items that no one regularly buys even on sale....

bapcsalescanada,3db00u,Zren,4,Tue Jul 14 22:18:16 2015 UTC,It sounded like you were jokingly threatening him with a sb. That was my initial thought with the first one I saw here.  You should probably add some context if you're going to warn people.

bapcsalescanada,3db00u,Portaljacker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:13:45 2015 UTC,unless you can get it across the border the duty fees and shipping are going to kill most .com deals for canadians.

bapcsalescanada,3db06v,Mohzillator,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:50:50 2015 UTC,Thought we might get a better deal from Amazon today but this item isn't even Prime eligible. Tempting.... does anyone know the difference between buying from Newegg/buying from their eBay account? I'm a bit skeptical that they don't have this deal on their own site.
bapcsalescanada,3db06v,Chiizukeeki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:12:26 2015 UTC,I don't know. It still has a 5 year warranty and in the page they state they offer the same Newegg customer service.
