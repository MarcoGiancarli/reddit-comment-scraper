justneckbeardthings,3dyj46,Pathosphere,4,Mon Jul 20 17:20:54 2015 UTC,The problem with these people is that they're usually fractally wrong. You can't possibly undo their errors without intense and rigorous discourse on how their entire worldview is wrong at every level and that takes dedication by both parties.
